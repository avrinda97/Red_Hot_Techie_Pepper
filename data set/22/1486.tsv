2010-06-30T08:12:00.000Z	ABBADON		Hi, I think I'm having problems with either X or GNOME, I'm not sure which.  I am using an HP desktop with 10.04 and kernel version 2.6.32-22-generic  with an Intel Celeron 2.50GHz processor.  It crashes after logging into a GNOME session occasionally, and definitely crashes after anywhere between a half hour and 8 hours of actual use.  I've tried reconfiguring X, I've tried searching...
2010-06-30T08:12:00.000Z	ABBADON		...Google, searching various forums and still have not found a solution.  Has anyone help me figure out the cause of these random reboots?  I can provide logs if needed.
2010-06-30T08:14:00.000Z	ABBADON		It seems as though X is crashing, but considering how it doesn't power off when I shut down without issuing a sudo init 0 command, I'm guessing it could be rebooting.  How do I figure that out?
2010-06-30T08:15:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ABBADON	start by looking through /var/log/Xorg.0.log, and older versions of the same...
2010-06-30T08:17:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	should I post my xorg.0.log to pastebin if I can't figure it out?
2010-06-30T08:17:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ABBADON	sure
2010-06-30T08:18:00.000Z	ABBADON		Will do.
2010-06-30T08:25:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	I'm getting quite a few errors in the various Xorg.* files.  Is it alright if I cat them into one log file and put them into pastebin for you to see?
2010-06-30T08:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ABBADON	sure
2010-06-30T08:26:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	Will do.
2010-06-30T08:35:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	This may take a bit, for some reason Pastebin thinks I'm a bot and I'm giving them the right combinations every time.
2010-06-30T08:43:00.000Z	ABBADON		Ok, I've gotten my Xorg logs up on pastebin, I had to take out every single instance of "http://" for them to accept it - their Captcha system seems to be broken.  Anyway, here are the logs catted into one file: http://pastebin.com/uFMzh8kW
2010-06-30T08:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ABBADON	unfortunately, I don't see anything blatently wrong there. There are some errors and warnings, but they're fairly insignificant.
2010-06-30T08:50:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	Thank you for taking a look at them - knowing that really helps.  Is it possible that there's something going on with GNOME then?
2010-06-30T08:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ABBADON	Hard to say I'm afraid. The complaint is that X dies, correct?
2010-06-30T08:52:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	Correct.
2010-06-30T08:52:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	At least, that's what I assume is going on.  What would I look for in the system logs to determine what's going on?
2010-06-30T08:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ABBADON	but when it does, the system continues to operate? Do you get a console login prompt?
2010-06-30T08:53:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	Nope.  In fact, it acts just like it does when I try to shut down.
2010-06-30T08:54:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	I even try getting a tty and I get nothing.
2010-06-30T08:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	ABBADON	Is the video adapter built in to your motherboard?
2010-06-30T08:55:00.000Z	ABBADON	greezmunkey	I think so.  It's an Intel card, I believe, so I'm assuming it's built onto the motherboard.  This computer is about 10 years old.
