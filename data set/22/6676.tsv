2007-01-06T13:58:00.000Z	mikeconcepts		perhaps iptables is what I need to understand, since I've having trouble using x11vnc, I can connect and see the screen on my edgy box, but can't so anything, can't click, noo keyboard
2007-01-06T13:59:00.000Z	mikeconcepts		so I need to research iptables, perhaps port 5900 is bolcked
2007-01-06T14:00:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	not if you didn't block it yourself. are you behind a firewall or router now?
2007-01-06T14:02:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	beryl will not work with x11vnc
2007-01-06T14:02:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	tried that myself last week. all other WM's work
2007-01-06T14:04:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	I will go turn off beryl and see if that fixes it, thanks, I'll let you know how it turns out
2007-01-06T14:23:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	bery lrunning is exactly what was causing me to not be able to x11vnc into edgy, turned off beryl and works fine now
2007-01-06T14:24:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	that's what I thought. somehow beryl does not use convential ways to build the windows and detect mouseclicks. Only had this prob with Beryl so it took me awhile to figure out as well :)
2007-01-07T15:00:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	are you thre? I have the answer to using bery with x11vnc
2007-01-07T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	sounds like fun. :)
2007-01-07T15:01:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	it works!
2007-01-07T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	fill me in. what is needed?
2007-01-07T15:02:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	ok, will fetch the exact link I found, but basically when you run x11vnc just add the switch -noxdamage, simple as that
2007-01-07T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	trying to find it in man x11vnc
2007-01-07T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	ah, got it. will try it out
2007-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	http://bugs.beryl-project.org/ticket/385
2007-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	yep. works fine. I would never know to use that option even after reading the man page for it. thanks for letting me know!
2007-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	I never forget a helping hand
2007-01-07T15:10:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	you're lucky. i am good connecting names to faces but terrible with names in general if I have nothing but text to go after. runs in the family that disability.
2007-01-07T15:12:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	naw, you're as good, I just have logging turned on in xchat, and looked up who the kind person was that helped me with the beryl/x11vnc issue
2007-01-07T15:13:00.000Z	Jowi	mikeconcepts	that's cheating. but I will start to do the same I think :)
2007-01-07T15:13:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	Jowi	until I do Jowi, works for me :)
