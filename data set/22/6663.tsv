2006-08-28T08:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	ok...i guess try it again. do you see anything that says "keycode"?
2006-08-28T08:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	first, install xev

2006-08-28T08:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	sweet. can you open a terminal?
2006-08-28T08:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	and then type "xev" (no quotes)
2006-08-28T08:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	then click on the xev window, and you'll see lots of output in the terminal
2006-08-28T08:06:00.000Z	thompa	ladydoor	btw i can find anumber of hp keyboards to choose from in system:keyboard, but all same functions
2006-08-28T08:07:00.000Z	thompa	ladydoor	right im there
2006-08-28T08:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	and then press your www key, and look fr something that says "keycode somenumber." write down "somenumber"
2006-08-28T08:07:00.000Z	thompa	ladydoor	ok then what?
2006-08-28T08:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	you got somenumber?

2006-08-28T08:11:00.000Z	thompa	ladydoor	no keycode anyway
2006-08-28T08:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	hmmm. it should give you one. you're not using an hp are you?
2006-08-28T08:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	aha. i am too, and for some reason i can set up all my other ones but that one doesn't seem to "exist"
2006-08-28T08:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	here's something you can do, though
2006-08-28T08:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	you can set up a keybinding to run firefox (or whatever). i think that'll be in the gnome menu
2006-08-28T08:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	thompa	yeah
2006-08-28T08:13:00.000Z	thompa	ladydoor	ive used keybinding before, thanks again
