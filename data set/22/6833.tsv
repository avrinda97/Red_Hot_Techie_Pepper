2006-11-26T16:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		!irssi
2006-11-26T16:44:00.000Z	hou5ton	Paddy_EIRE	  I'm looking for that possibility, but can't find where I might be blocking anything.   Any suggestions?
2006-11-26T16:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	do u use anything like "noscript" or "Adblock"
2006-11-26T16:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	also do you have the java and flash plugins installed in firefox correctly
2006-11-26T16:46:00.000Z	hou5ton	Paddy_EIRE	  maybe that's it ... I think I do ... but how can I check
2006-11-26T16:46:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	about the java and flash plugins
2006-11-26T16:46:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		?

2006-11-26T16:47:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	try playing a video from youtube thats a good way to check
2006-11-26T16:47:00.000Z	hou5ton	Paddy_EIRE	  YouTube works fine
2006-11-26T16:48:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	ok, then you are sure there are no other firefox extensions that are for blocking content
2006-11-26T16:51:00.000Z	hou5ton	Paddy_EIRE	  what video player would I use to watch that?
2006-11-26T16:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	it seems to be in there own player?? but i would suggest mplayer
2006-11-26T16:53:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	"sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer"
2006-11-26T16:55:00.000Z	hou5ton	Paddy_EIRE	  already have that installed
2006-11-26T16:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	hou5ton	ok, this is a weird one.... I wonder what could be missing
2006-11-26T16:57:00.000Z	hou5ton	Paddy_EIRE	  yes .... I'm looking for everything ... YouTube works great

2006-11-27T17:02:00.000Z	hou5ton	Paddy_EIRE	  like you said ... this is so weird. I don't care about Fox news website that much, but now it's just the principle of the matter.  :-)
