2008-01-26T03:59:00.000Z	alinon		has anyone here tried Wubi?
2008-01-26T04:00:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	do you have a specific question about it ?
2008-01-26T04:00:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	I don't understand it, it is actually installing ubuntu - there seems to be some difference
2008-01-26T04:00:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	 So i guess that's my question, am i going to lose anything by using it?
2008-01-26T04:01:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	as far as I know, it creates some kind of "fake" linux partiton image on your ntfs/windows partiton and runs ubuntu from that,   you can'T just remvoe windows and run only ubuntu afterwards,  and you can'T access your ubuntu partiton from a live cd
2008-01-26T04:02:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	Oh right I think i read that ubuntu runs a bit slower because of that right?
2008-01-26T04:03:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	probably,  it's not like a real install,  but I think you can run it whitout booting windows, just not sure,  it's not like a virtual machine , but a bit similar
2008-01-26T04:03:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	dl the live cd and install,  there is no issue dualbooting
2008-01-26T04:04:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	My vista installation never shows up during the install of ubuntu, so if i install it messes with the MBR
2008-01-26T04:05:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	I would look in the forum on this,  I know there are fixes, it's just a matter of adding a couple of lines to the /boot/grub/menu.lst file
2008-01-26T04:06:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	 I've read that you can change something in the advanced options to prevent Grub from taking over any other drives - but i don't know what to put in the box for my paticular setup
2008-01-26T04:06:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	are you isntalling ubuntu on a sepreate drive ? that is easy enough
2008-01-26T04:06:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	yes it would be a second drive
2008-01-26T04:08:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	you have two options, depending on how squeemish you are,  1 change the boot drive in your bios to the drive you want to use for ubuntu and just proceed with the install as usual , 2  open the box and unplug the vista drive for the duration of the installation,  ( still making sure the ubuntu drive will be the boot drive )
2008-01-26T04:08:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	I don'T allow private msg, please talk to me in the channel
2008-01-26T04:09:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	 Yeah i considered that, but i'd rather not open my case for it
2008-01-26T04:10:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	just change the boot drive then,  I have a 2 hdd setup myself,  and the ubuntu installer recognised xp on my second hdd,  so I hve both in the grub menu,  and should I decide to remove either hdd the other one can boot with no issue
2008-01-26T04:11:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	yeah it reconizes xp fine, but it don't see my vista which uses a different type of special boot loader
2008-01-26T04:11:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	as a general rule of thumb , with a 2 hdd setup you want the ubuntu drive set to boot when you install,  otherwise you overwrite the mbr of one hdd with stage one of grub ,which refers to stage two on the other drive and then you can't boot if either is removed
2008-01-26T04:14:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	 It was my understanding that regardless of boot order, if ubuntu see the drive it will write over the mbr/bootloader - which has been my experience
2008-01-26T04:15:00.000Z	Pelo	alinon	you can specify the drive to install grub on in the final screen before the install begings, where you get a summary of your choices,  my way is just a bit safer since you don'T need to figure out the grub naming skeme for your hdd
2008-01-26T04:16:00.000Z	alinon	Pelo	 so your 100% sure that if the hdd that i want to install ubuntu on is listed as the first boot devices in the bios then ubuntu will not effect vista which is on a different drive?
