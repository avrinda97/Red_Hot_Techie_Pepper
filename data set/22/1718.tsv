2010-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	RPG-Master		My fonts are missing!
2010-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	RPG-Master		:O
2010-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	RPG-Master		Everything, besides Liberation Serif and Sans, and Linux Libretan
2010-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	RPG-Master		Also, sorry but I really can't remember what I did last that could have caused this sudden loss of fonts :/
2010-04-15T09:22:00.000Z	RPG-Master		ALSO, all the fonts are still in ~/.fonts/ and /usr/share/fonts/
2010-04-15T09:23:00.000Z	RPG-Master		Also, reinstalling the fonts did nothing :(
2010-04-15T09:23:00.000Z	RPG-Master		would this have something to do with the font.config?
2010-04-15T09:23:00.000Z	RPG-Master		And would someone please respond? :P
2010-04-15T09:24:00.000Z	kuttans	RPG-Master	can you come again pls with your problem
2010-04-15T09:25:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	All my fonts are missing. Everything, besides Liberation Serif and Sans, and Linux Libretan
2010-04-15T09:26:00.000Z	kuttans	RPG-Master	try to do a dpkg-reconfigure *.deb replace * with the font package, i dont remember the exact package name,
2010-04-15T09:26:00.000Z	kuttans	RPG-Master	may be the font cache is corrupted so pls do a reconfigure and you may get it back
2010-04-15T09:27:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	I'll try that.
2010-04-15T09:30:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config did nothing :(
2010-04-15T09:30:00.000Z	kuttans	RPG-Master	not fontconfig-config there must be a package for all your fonts you have do a dpkg-reconfigure for that not the config itself
2010-04-15T09:33:00.000Z	kuttans	RPG-Master	: there is a command named fc-cache
2010-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	none of the different fc-cache options fixed it :(
2010-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	want the error log?
2010-04-15T09:44:00.000Z	kuttans	RPG-Master	open the synaptic and try to do a reinstall, try after removing it completely so that you download the latest version, this should fix that
2010-04-15T09:44:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	http://paste.ubuntu.com/414724/
2010-04-15T09:44:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	Which package? Fontconfig?
2010-04-15T09:48:00.000Z	RPG-Master	kuttans	OK, did it, nothing has changed. Should I log-out/log-in or reboot?
