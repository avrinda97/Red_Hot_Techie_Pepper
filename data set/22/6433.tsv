2006-11-10T14:35:00.000Z	RVman		hey all :) can someone please explain whats so good about this "ubuntu" thing? all of my friends are talking about it and saying how great it is, and i wanna understand some more about it...
2006-11-10T14:35:00.000Z	RVman		what is exactly that... "ubuntu" :D?
2006-11-10T14:36:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	it's a linux distribution, aimed at being user-friendly
2006-11-10T14:36:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	lot of things are automated, it's debian-based
2006-11-10T14:37:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	nothing is ``better'' than anything else
2006-11-10T14:38:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	choosing an operating system is a choice of personal taste and what you want to do with your machine
2006-11-10T14:38:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	first of all, linux is free, non-proprietary, open source. everyone may use it and you don't need to pay for licenses
2006-11-10T14:39:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	one drawback is that there are still many apps that you simply don't have when you use linux
2006-11-10T14:40:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	and under windows, the ``device driver thing'' is a lot easier
2006-11-10T14:41:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	wine is, as a matter of fact, still in beta state, not really finished
2006-11-10T14:44:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	better pastebot it
2006-11-10T14:46:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	do you have aptitude or synaptic running?
2006-11-10T14:47:00.000Z	RVman	ChaosFan	no
2006-11-10T14:48:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	hm, but looks like it... one moment
2006-11-10T14:50:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	if you really don't have anything running, you could `sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock`
2006-11-10T14:50:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	and then try again
2006-11-10T14:51:00.000Z	RVman	ChaosFan	wait i will try
2006-11-10T14:51:00.000Z	RVman	ChaosFan	the truth is i can't even run synaptic, everytime i open it, it gets closed by itself
2006-11-10T14:51:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	while that lock-file exists no front-end to apt-get will start
2006-11-10T14:53:00.000Z	RVman	ChaosFan	thanks, it works now
2006-11-10T14:53:00.000Z	ChaosFan	RVman	np
2006-11-10T15:24:00.000Z	RVman	ChaosFan	what do i do when a program tells me "Could not open /dev/sequencer. and another program is probably using it"?
