2005-12-23T13:51:00.000Z	ejofee		folks, can anybody please help me with this ?: http://pastebin.com/468769
2005-12-23T13:52:00.000Z	force	ejofee	what is /dev/ddd1? ls -l /dev/ddd1
2005-12-23T13:52:00.000Z	ejofee	force	i handwrote it... i guess it actually was hdd1... (in fact i am pretty much sure)
2005-12-23T13:54:00.000Z	force	ejofee	what major and minor is the device node
2005-12-23T13:54:00.000Z	ejofee	force	sorry, i don't understand the question
2005-12-23T13:56:00.000Z	force	ejofee	if you type ls -l /dev/ddd1 (or whatever device you used) it will give two sets of numbers, what are the numbers you have used?
2005-12-23T13:57:00.000Z	force	ejofee	grubs device numbering system is different to linux's, perhaps reading a grub howto would help?
2005-12-23T14:00:00.000Z	force	ejofee	theres the problem ;)
2005-12-23T14:00:00.000Z	ejofee	force	where?
2005-12-23T14:00:00.000Z	force	ejofee	install on the MBR
2005-12-23T14:00:00.000Z	ejofee	force	if grub can only be installed on the mbr, then why does ubuntu / grub offer me the option?
2005-12-23T14:01:00.000Z	force	ejofee	i'm not sure sorry
2005-12-23T14:01:00.000Z	ejofee	force	then are you sure *this* is the problem? (not having it installed on the mbr)
2005-12-23T14:01:00.000Z	force	ejofee	yes.
2005-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	ejofee	force	how do i install it on the mbr? any easy hint? tell me the config file responsible for this, please
2005-12-23T14:07:00.000Z	force	ejofee	i think it depends on how hold your machine/bios is, most bootloaders require the second stage bootloader in the first 512 bytes of the disk
2005-12-23T14:07:00.000Z	ejofee	force	lilo seems to be much less picky
2005-12-23T14:09:00.000Z	ejofee	force	how do i apply changes after i modify the grub config file?
2005-12-23T14:09:00.000Z	force	ejofee	this is related to redhat, but its relevant http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.2-Manual/ref-guide/ch-grub.html
2005-12-23T14:09:00.000Z	ejofee	force	thanks a lot
2005-12-23T14:10:00.000Z	force	ejofee	yeah man grub-install ;)
2005-12-23T14:10:00.000Z	ejofee	force	thanks :) hope it's as straightforward as lilo... just changing the config file and then running lilo..
