2007-09-01T11:01:00.000Z	MYTHBUNTU	z0rz	How do i do the rebuild?
2007-09-01T11:03:00.000Z	z0rz	MYTHBUNTU	Try Xorg -configure
2007-09-01T11:05:00.000Z	MYTHBUNTU	z0rz	tried the Xorg -configure = cannot move old log file

2007-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	MYTHBUNTU	z0rz	yes xserver fails to load, thus gdm wont load
2007-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	z0rz	MYTHBUNTU	Right.. but does it say why xserver is failing to load?
2007-09-01T11:11:00.000Z	MYTHBUNTU	z0rz	graphical interface

2007-09-01T11:24:00.000Z	MYTHBUNTU	z0rz	paste.stgraber.org/3258 has my xorg log, maybe this helps, 3257 has the xorg.conf
