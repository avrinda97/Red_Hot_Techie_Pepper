2007-03-26T16:26:00.000Z	MrX|ubu		can i hard code the ip addresses into ubuntu like "iptables" in windows?
2007-03-26T16:26:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	you mean like HOSTS?
2007-03-26T16:26:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	gues where HOSTS comes from :p
2007-03-26T16:27:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	it's a posix/unix thing (hence why it's in <blah>/etc/HOSTS ion windows)
2007-03-26T16:34:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	gotta edit it via sudo
2007-03-26T16:37:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	shouldn't need to
2007-03-26T16:37:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	 unless you're renaming your machine
2007-03-26T16:40:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	what's the problem you're having?
2007-03-26T16:42:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	cat you "dig archive.ubuntu.com"
2007-03-26T16:42:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	I'm interested if it gives a warning message when you do that command
2007-03-26T16:43:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	may not be what I thought it might be then;  last thing though, what brand of router are you using?
2007-03-26T16:45:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	it sure sounds familiar
2007-03-26T16:47:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	find out what your isp's dns is, and enter it by hand rather than using 192.168.1.1, or whatever the router's ip is
2007-03-26T16:48:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	router config page should tell you
2007-03-26T16:49:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	 yep, secondary is probably good to have too
2007-03-26T16:50:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	network config, the dns page
2007-03-26T16:51:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	brb
2007-03-26T16:53:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	back
2007-03-26T16:53:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	I think there's an option you can enter for dns to have it ignore some weirdness that your router is doing
2007-03-26T16:53:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	but it's been about a year since I ran into someone with this problem
2007-03-26T16:54:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	"worked around" is the technical term :p
2007-03-26T16:55:00.000Z	cwillu	MrX|ubu	if your isp ever changes their dns, you'll have to update it by hand, just try to remember that if things break again
