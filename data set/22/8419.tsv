2005-08-22T07:29:00.000Z	Unununium		I installed Ubuntu replacing plain Debian when I had a gigantic mess of unsatisfiable dependencies
2005-08-22T07:30:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	how'd you install?  overwriting?  or by *cough* changing repos?
2005-08-22T07:30:00.000Z	Unununium	reka	backed up /home, reformatted, and installed
2005-08-22T07:31:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	and you're getting the dependency issues when using your apt interface?
2005-08-22T07:32:00.000Z	Unununium	reka	I got them from dselect
2005-08-22T07:35:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	so *that's* what that button is for. :)
2005-08-22T08:23:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	what are the urls for bp and extras in sources.list?
2005-08-22T08:25:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	they seem ok....and you've done an apt-get update?
2005-08-22T08:25:00.000Z	Unununium	reka	I'm trying to do so, byt apt-get update Ign's every -extra and -backport
2005-08-22T08:50:00.000Z	Unununium	reka	your nick reminds me of rpgworld
2005-08-22T08:51:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	you'll have to explain that :)
2005-08-22T08:52:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	oh, ok :)
2005-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	seeing as you're a console buff, do you know if it's possible to change the refresh rate?
2005-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	60Hz is hard on the eyes
2005-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	heh, not sure to be honest
2005-08-22T09:25:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	so what'd the next step be after working out which mode?
2005-08-22T09:26:00.000Z	Unununium	reka	is it text or framebuffer?
2005-08-22T09:26:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	framebuffer i think
2005-08-22T09:27:00.000Z	Unununium	reka	no, VGA does text as well as graphics.  What option did you pass?
2005-08-22T09:28:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	vga=0x318, which is apparently 1024x768
2005-08-22T09:28:00.000Z	Unununium	reka	fbset will let you do whatever you want
2005-08-22T09:28:00.000Z	reka	Unununium	thanks, will look into it
