2009-01-08T10:54:00.000Z	Baz_		my computer is randomly freezing after some use - is there anyway to find out what is the culprit through ubuntu - or whether it is maybe some driver in ubntu?
2009-01-08T10:55:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	issues like that will never have a general solution
2009-01-08T10:56:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	i know and its making me sad, but maybe i can start by looking at some logs or running some commands to see what the computer was trying to do before freezing?
2009-01-08T10:57:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	does it freeze using linux only?
2009-01-08T10:57:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	haven't tested windows
2009-01-08T10:57:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	and how does it freeze
2009-01-08T10:59:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	its the purest freeze you could imagine, i am would working on something then the mouse and keyboard and OS stop responding, the image freezes wherever it was at - there are no sounds or msg's or anything
2009-01-08T11:01:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	hmm ever tried booting the machine console based? could the crash relate to video driver issues?
2009-01-08T11:02:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	i would love to be able to test that out, thing is i cant reliably reproduce it without just using it for like 10 mins
2009-01-08T11:02:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	is that a clue?
2009-01-08T11:03:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	i cant tell but i'd try "text mode"
2009-01-08T11:03:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	maybe i should call geek squad :-0
2009-01-08T11:08:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	is there some obvious things i can look for in the logs?
2009-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	ifconfig?
2009-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	internal meaning?
2009-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	i was thinking the system logs... how would ifconfig help
2009-01-08T11:10:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	sry i read the wrong line!
2009-01-08T11:11:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	heh
2009-01-08T11:12:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	you on an apache issue or do i mix up things?
2009-01-08T11:12:00.000Z	Baz_	tenX	i'm the guy whose computer randomly freezes after a random amount of use :)
2009-01-08T11:12:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	sorry :)
2009-01-08T11:13:00.000Z	tenX	Baz_	got distracted and the alc guy is starting to take over again.
