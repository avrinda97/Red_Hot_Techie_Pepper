2007-12-31T23:19:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	vlc can do wmv
2007-12-31T23:19:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	so can mplayer I think
2007-12-31T23:21:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	and what plugins do i need for vlc? for mozilla?
2007-12-31T23:22:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	not sure...I think I just set up vlc as an external app to handle all that
2007-12-31T23:22:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	ok, i'll try that
2007-12-31T23:23:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	10x
2007-12-31T23:24:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	I have some notes on how to do that. If you want I can pastebin it for you.
2007-12-31T23:25:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	sure
2007-12-31T23:25:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	 10x
2007-12-31T23:26:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	ok...quick and dirty notes...but they usually help....http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50296/
2007-12-31T23:34:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	vlc, like most things in linux, is installed in parts in different locations. Are you looking for the executable command?
2007-12-31T23:35:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	yes
2007-12-31T23:35:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	the exe
2007-12-31T23:35:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	to find the full path of the executable just type 'which vlc' in a terminal
2007-12-31T23:35:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	not exe....how windowish ! <smile>
2007-12-31T23:38:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	i followed thoese steps but nothing, can't get vlc to play win media player streamings
2007-12-31T23:39:00.000Z	th0r	x_zeuss	you need to install the nonfree codecs...there is a factoid for that...wish I could remember it...hope someone iwll trigger it for me
2007-12-31T23:40:00.000Z	x_zeuss	th0r	when i go on that site i get a message in mozilla that additional plugins are needed, i click install missing plugins and then at the plugin finder i get Unknown Plugin ( application/x-ms-wmp)
