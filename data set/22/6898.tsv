2006-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	lophyte		anyone know where I can download additional gnome panel applets?
2006-08-23T05:56:00.000Z	lophyte		anyone know how to recover deleted files in ext3?
2006-08-23T05:58:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	hmm, it's a bit rough. were they deleted with rm?
2006-08-23T05:58:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	no, mv
2006-08-23T05:59:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	right, well can't you just rename the file you mv'd with mv?
2006-08-23T05:59:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	anyway, people say good things about this: http://www.stellarinfo.com/linux-data-recovery.htm though it's proprietary.
2006-08-23T06:00:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	I mv'd them somewhere and then lost them
2006-08-23T06:01:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	oh, so you don't know where they are? you could try a 'sudo updatedb; locate name-of-your-file'. you could also hit CTRL-r in the terminal you mv'd them in, and type 'mv'. that will give you the last mv command you did in that terminal (or just use the up-arrows).
2006-08-23T06:01:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	no, I lost them as in the directory I mv'd them to is gone
2006-08-23T06:02:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	right, so you rm -fr the directory?
2006-08-23T06:02:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	I was doing the tutorial on storing your gpg keys on an encrypted fs on a USB key..
2006-08-23T06:03:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	but the filesystem I created is gone for some reason
2006-08-23T06:04:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	hmm, well it doesn't look good really. there is very little in the way of ext3 recovery, without prior backup.
2006-08-23T06:04:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	unless I can recover the encrypted fs.. but I don't know what the problem is
2006-08-23T06:04:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	where _should_ this fs be?
2006-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	its in a file called disk.img on my USB drive... but when I try to mount it, it says bad fs
2006-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	ahah.. what is the exact error output?
2006-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	lophyte	delire	and gparted says there's no partitions on it
2006-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	you might want to check it's not already mounted. perhaps type 'mount' and see if it there. if so, then 'sudo umount -l /path/to/usbtick'
2006-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	them remount it manually.
2006-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	mount it and run an fsck /dev/mapper/usbkey
2006-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	delire	lophyte	by the way, is that really the name for your mountpoint?
