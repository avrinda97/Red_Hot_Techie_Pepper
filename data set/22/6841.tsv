2006-07-15T07:47:00.000Z	jersymike		i9 must be retarted or something i cant figure this crp out for my life
2006-07-15T07:48:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	I have missed what your problem is, do you mind saying it again?
2006-07-15T07:49:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	when you installed your system, you created a user account with a password
2006-07-15T07:51:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	 then you did not complete the install, your system will reboot once during an install if I remember correctly but it will tell you when you are done
2006-07-15T07:52:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	I used to use mandriva, ubuntu is faster and it seems that it is friendly toward everyone
2006-07-15T07:53:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	I suggest going through the install again
2006-07-15T07:54:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	sure
2006-07-15T07:55:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	then use the desktop cd
2006-07-15T07:56:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	 thats great
2006-07-15T07:58:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	once you get the desktop running, its really not much to get the server apps on it, through synaptic or apt-get
2006-07-15T07:59:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	the ubuntu install disc is a livecd, it will run off of your cdrom
2006-07-15T07:59:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	yes you will
2006-07-15T08:00:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	or a flash drive or something
2006-07-15T08:48:00.000Z	jersymike	riddlebox	i put in the destop live cd and it went straight for loading something now im at a blank screen with a mouse.. did i do something wrong?
2006-07-15T08:49:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	reboot it, then when the cd asks you which to start arrow down to the second choice
2006-07-15T08:50:00.000Z	jersymike	riddlebox	start in safe grafics mode?
2006-07-15T08:52:00.000Z	jersymike	riddlebox	what is it doing now? it says oading hardwaredrivers and is stoped
2006-07-15T08:53:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	just give it a minute
2006-07-15T08:57:00.000Z	jersymike	riddlebox	now im at a screen where it says mindow mannager at the bottom and ubuntu at the top right
2006-07-15T09:29:00.000Z	riddlebox	jersymike	hows that install going?
