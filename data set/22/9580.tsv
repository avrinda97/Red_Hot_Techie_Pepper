2005-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	crimsun	setite	if you have questions, /join #alsa and ask me there.
2005-01-24T06:32:00.000Z	crimsun	setite	creating an .asoundrc and restarting your ALSA applications takes approximately one minute.
2005-01-24T06:33:00.000Z	crimsun	setite	that's because that page attempts to tell you a lot of information, and it's not streamlined.
2005-01-24T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	setite	like I said, if you need help, /join #alsa and I'm glad to assist you.
2005-01-24T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	setite	yes, but you need a newer version of ALSA than what is available in warty
2005-02-04T13:22:00.000Z	crimsun	setite	ora.com has articles and various books.
