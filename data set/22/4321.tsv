2008-01-21T21:27:00.000Z	tanath		my desktop is nonexistent. how can i get it back?
2008-01-21T21:27:00.000Z	tanath		tried logging out & back
2008-01-21T21:28:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	how did you do that!
2008-01-21T21:28:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	well, my computer blew up... that might have done it, lol. had to buy a new power supply
2008-01-21T21:29:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	jrib , but it worked before, even after that
2008-01-21T21:31:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	you could try nautilus --replace, and if not the perhaps you need to reinstall, try: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop nautilus
2008-01-21T21:32:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	i believe i already did reinstall it. i reinstalled lots of things to be safe
2008-01-21T21:32:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	Unknown option --replace
2008-01-21T21:32:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	that's strange, nautilus --replace should always work...
2008-01-21T21:32:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	soz I mean metacity --replace
2008-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	running compiz, but it and metacity run fine
2008-01-21T21:33:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	erm...
2008-01-21T21:34:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	it's not the WM
2008-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	it appears to be nautilus. it's responsible for the desktop
2008-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	you could try making a new test user to see if it's a bad config somewhere
2008-01-21T21:36:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	*sigh*. that's a PITA
2008-01-21T21:37:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	it's the easiest thing you can do to test, because it would show if it was user based, or something more serious, it will only be a 50MB, if not, then you could just do rm ~/.gnome* but you would use any custom settings
2008-01-21T21:37:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	rm -rf ~/.gnome* or rm -rf ~/.nautilus*
2008-01-21T21:51:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	any luck?
2008-01-21T21:51:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	any luck?
2008-01-21T21:53:00.000Z	tanath	azexian	sorry, a couple things came up. i'm busy for a few mins. will try soon
2008-01-21T21:53:00.000Z	azexian	tanath	that's fine
