2009-12-24T21:00:00.000Z	Ziber		I have radvd installed, but I dont want it to start on boot. How can I achieve this?
2009-12-24T21:01:00.000Z	Ziber		How can I set it so it doesnt start on boot?
2009-12-24T21:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 either disable it in /etc/init if its ran by upstart. or in /etc/rc2.d if its handled by the sysv system
2010-01-23T06:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 state the connection type. Wired or wireless..
2010-01-23T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 has any live cd's worked with networking?
2010-01-23T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 that is very very odd then, Hmm any idea what NIC you got?
2010-01-23T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 could be theres some kernel module youi need to load. How old is this machine?
2010-01-23T06:58:00.000Z	Ziber	Dr_Willis	the machine is about 2 years old, i think. maybe a bit more...
2010-01-23T06:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 see if dmesg output mentions the network cards at all. i had a Marvell NIC that the kernel dident like too well
2010-01-23T07:03:00.000Z	Ziber	Dr_Willis	what can i search for in /var/log/dmesg to see if it found NIC?
2010-01-23T07:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 not sure what pattern to sue
2010-04-09T17:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 there were some alternatives to screen. that worked basically the same way. but i cant recall their names. 'twin' used tobeone . but i dont think its in the repos any more
2010-05-02T21:40:00.000Z	Ziber	Dr_Willis	:/
2010-05-02T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 what iso did you put on the flash drive? Server? alternative? xubuntu desktop?
2010-05-02T21:39:00.000Z	Ziber	Dr_Willis	ubuntu 9.04 server
2010-05-02T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 thats the problem then.. server cant do a flash-drive type install
2010-05-02T21:40:00.000Z	Ziber	Dr_Willis	none of the server editions?
2010-05-02T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 none that i know of.
2010-05-02T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 i see this asked in here about 3 times a week. its possibel there may be  a way to do it with grub2 and booting the iso file. but ive never tried
2010-05-02T21:41:00.000Z	Ziber	Dr_Willis	do you know of any way to install a server edition without a cD?
2010-05-02T21:43:00.000Z	Ziber	Dr_Willis	might've missed your response, or you might've missed my question. is there any way to install ubuntu server without using a CD?
2010-05-02T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ziber	 perhaps grub2 booting the iso file.. or a netboot.
