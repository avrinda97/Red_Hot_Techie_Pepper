2009-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	bilbogus		Alright, so, once I have network-manager installed, how can I launch it. I can't seem to find it anywhere.
2009-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	its the networking icon in your panel. if its missing then either your notification area is missing, nm-applet isnt running, or you hit that bug where it disappears while nm-applet is still running
2009-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	How would I launch nm-applet?
2009-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	check and see if its running "ps -ef | grep nm-applet"
2009-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	Grep just gets stuck when I try that.
2009-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	I'm not getting any output from it.
2009-08-31T05:16:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	ok then try typing "nohup nm-applet &"
2009-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	nonup command not found. :(
2009-08-31T05:20:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	Is nonup something that should work in 8.04? I'm getting a command not found error.
2009-08-31T05:20:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	nohup not nonup
2009-08-31T05:21:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	er but dont capitalize like Dr_Willis did :P
2009-08-31T05:21:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	Now I feel like an idiot. :)
2009-08-31T05:21:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	it happens to everybody :)
2009-08-31T05:22:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	Oh dear... cannot run command "nm-applet": No such file or directory.
2009-08-31T05:22:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	Am I looking at a reinstall here?
2009-08-31T05:26:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	are you sure network-manager-gnome (i think thats the name) is installed?
2009-08-31T05:26:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	apt-get says it is.
2009-08-31T05:27:00.000Z	maco	bilbogus	sudo aptitude reinstall?
2009-08-31T05:28:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	and then try nohup again?
2009-08-31T05:30:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	It's all still failing. I think I'm gonna try reinstalling.
2009-08-31T05:45:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	It seems my install disc isn't complete. I guess nicking one off a friend wasn't a good idea.
2009-08-31T05:45:00.000Z	bilbogus	maco	Thanks for all your help.
