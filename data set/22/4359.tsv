2010-05-02T17:19:00.000Z	glaucous		URGENT: while running virtualbox (I need windows for work), after a while my whole computer will lock up.  then it will sort of come back but I'll have no more title bars, no more network, and system monitor shows Load at 100%. only fix so far is to reboot.  I've been using lucid since alpha3 and this just happened in the past couple days. please help!
2010-05-02T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	glaucous	i really wouldn't use a new release for work dude
2010-05-02T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	glaucous	if you press ALT+F2 and run: metacity --replace    do the bars come back
2010-05-02T17:21:00.000Z	glaucous	ActionParsnip	Alt+F2 doesn't work
2010-05-02T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	glaucous	then log off and log on to command line level and reinstall ubuntu-desktop
2010-05-02T17:23:00.000Z	glaucous	ActionParsnip	I'll try that, thanks
2010-05-02T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	glaucous	i'd just backup your virtualbox config etc and reinstall if worst comes to worse
2010-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	glaucous	ActionParsnip	I'm just surprised it's able to completely hose my system
2010-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	glaucous	its software, so anyting can
2010-05-02T17:30:00.000Z	glaucous	ActionParsnip	I know, but I've become accustomed to more stability with linux :)
2010-05-02T17:35:00.000Z	glaucous	ActionParsnip	I logged out and tried switching to a VC and I don't have any.  just a blinking cursor top-left
2010-05-02T17:36:00.000Z	glaucous	ActionParsnip	rebooted and still don't have any VCs
2010-05-02T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	glaucous	not sure then dude
