2005-08-27T05:06:00.000Z	topyli		i'd like to advertise something like that: "the NEW generation with SHITTY performance"
2005-08-27T05:06:00.000Z	michele	topyli	I have that!
2005-08-27T05:09:00.000Z	topyli	michele	that's why i buy matrox cards
2005-08-27T05:09:00.000Z	topyli	michele	and old ones too :)
2005-08-27T05:09:00.000Z	michele	topyli	you know, you can't really decide what's in your laptop
2005-08-27T05:09:00.000Z	michele	topyli	back when I used desktops I also used matrox too :)
2005-08-27T05:10:00.000Z	michele	topyli	I have a G400 in the PII box, which replaced the G200
2005-08-27T05:10:00.000Z	topyli	michele	i'm still at the desktop era. carrying machines around is silly, something like a nokia communicator is good enough
2005-08-27T05:11:00.000Z	michele	topyli	I want laptops because they're small and quiet
2005-08-27T05:11:00.000Z	topyli	michele	so is my phone (not so small, but pretty quiet :)
2005-08-27T05:12:00.000Z	michele	topyli	I doubt your phone runs eclipse, though
2005-08-27T05:12:00.000Z	topyli	michele	no, but it runs putty, nethack and doom. good enough
2005-08-27T05:13:00.000Z	michele	topyli	as I said before... "work" ;)
2005-08-27T05:13:00.000Z	topyli	michele	depends on the "work" :)
2005-08-27T05:14:00.000Z	topyli	michele	a communicator is no more expensive than a laptop though
2005-08-27T05:14:00.000Z	michele	topyli	well, a work that requires you to run doom and nethack should be pretty fun
2005-08-27T05:14:00.000Z	michele	topyli	well, but I hate symbian and nokia
2005-08-27T05:14:00.000Z	topyli	michele	i love it!
2005-08-27T05:15:00.000Z	topyli	michele	symbian does suck though
2005-08-27T05:15:00.000Z	michele	topyli	I'd like the 770
2005-08-27T05:15:00.000Z	topyli	michele	yes, once it becomes a phone (voip is planned for the future)
2005-08-27T05:16:00.000Z	topyli	michele	i also like the communicator's keyboard and display
