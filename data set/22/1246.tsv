2010-08-02T02:41:00.000Z	edbian	warren94	What does sudo iwlist scan   say?  Should show you wifi networks in range.
2010-08-02T02:42:00.000Z	warren94	edbian	i dont know im new to ubuntu. what do i do?
2010-08-02T02:43:00.000Z	edbian	warren94	Open a terminal and type "sudo iwlist scan" without quotes.
2010-08-02T02:43:00.000Z	edbian	warren94	sudo - escalates you to root, iwlist - command line wifi utility, scan - look for wireless networks.

2010-08-02T02:45:00.000Z	edbian	warren94	Did your wifi networks show up?
