2006-04-17T14:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	#ubuntu-offtopic for either pasta or your love life, OK?
2006-04-17T14:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	yes
2006-04-17T14:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	adding Debian binaries to Ubuntu is a good way to break your Ubuntu...
2006-04-17T14:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	k3b is in Ubuntu's repos, anyway
2006-04-17T14:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	do you have the Universe/Multiverse repos enabled?
2006-04-17T14:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	if you've already added Debian stuff to your sources.list, that's probably why k3b's depends are all messed uo
2006-04-17T15:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	yes, you just need to edit your sources.list back to sanity
2006-04-17T15:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	2nd URL in the bot's post above ^^^
2006-04-23T11:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	plug it in and see what happens?
2006-04-23T11:28:00.000Z	blindx	Madpilot	nothing happened :x
2006-04-23T11:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	so much for the easy way - I know zip about wireless, so you'll have to ask around here
2006-04-27T08:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	blindx	it's not usually that hard to untwist (unless you bork sudo, it seems like...)
