2011-05-10T04:16:00.000Z	linuxrealm		here trolly trolly, good little trolly crumbs for you, yum yum,,
2011-05-10T04:17:00.000Z	linuxrealm		what kinda of question is that?
2011-05-10T04:17:00.000Z	linuxrealm		sounds loaded
2011-05-10T04:18:00.000Z	stlrocker	linuxrealm	can you tell me why the clock/weather behaves differently between custom/admin user accnt and "user" accnt?
2011-05-10T04:19:00.000Z	stlrocker	linuxrealm	both are using gnome classic
2011-05-10T04:19:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	no
2011-05-10T04:20:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	are you connected to the net as Root?
2011-05-10T04:20:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	whats the heck is a custom/admin user?
2011-05-10T04:21:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	are you saying you have two users, one is custom and the other is a very low privilege user?
2011-05-10T04:21:00.000Z	stlrocker	linuxrealm	when your first user is created... it is "admin" and is under "custom"   when I created the second accnt on the machine.. I put in group "users" only
2011-05-10T04:22:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	i undertstand... continue...
2011-05-10T04:22:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	how did you put it in? gui or manually
2011-05-10T04:22:00.000Z	stlrocker	linuxrealm	gui
2011-05-10T04:22:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	did you use adduser
2011-05-10T04:23:00.000Z	stlrocker	linuxrealm	yes
2011-05-10T04:23:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	and you simply put your "other" user in group what?
2011-05-10T04:24:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	stop right there!! do not addusers or groups on the fly like that... the way ubuntu/gnome has put things together, its all intertwined, and you really should readup a little bit on perms in a gui b4 treading there...
2011-05-10T04:25:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	so your question was, the diff between how the clock/weather is configured? correct
2011-05-10T04:26:00.000Z	stlrocker	linuxrealm	yes.. it there is weather display and pref choices in admin account but not the "user" account
2011-05-10T04:26:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	thats cuz the programmers figured they dont want an unpriv user mucking with the clock settings, makes sense
2011-05-10T04:27:00.000Z	linuxrealm	stlrocker	the diff, they are perm'd differently. add weather with the "admin" user, and the "other should be there after logging in
2011-05-10T04:35:00.000Z	stlrocker	linuxrealm	and jstoone   thanks for your time  i'll keep playing with this
