2009-05-10T15:23:00.000Z	Armageddon		Do you think the new kernel update will be considered in the updates of ubuntu ?
2009-05-10T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	what update ?
2009-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	kernel
2009-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	what kernel update though ?
2009-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	they just released a new version :/
2009-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	who has ?
2009-05-10T15:25:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	dude there is a new kernel release go check it out
2009-05-10T15:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	who has release a new kernel update ?
2009-05-10T15:26:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	the kernel team
2009-05-10T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	do you mean the generic kernel.org kernel release ?
2009-05-10T15:27:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	yes :/
2009-05-10T15:27:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	do other teams release new KERNEL ?
2009-05-10T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	it is very doubtful ubuntu will adopt a kernel release update, they rarley have done in the past unless there is something critical
2009-05-10T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	yes, funny enough , distributions and pacakges release kernel updates, hence why I was asking "who"
2009-05-10T15:28:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	oh ok :/ they shouldnt call it kernel, but iv heard it makes the boot faster by 6 seconds !
2009-05-10T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	ha ha ha, I doubt that VERY much
2009-05-10T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	boot time is machine and configuration specific
2009-05-10T15:28:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	i meant the kernel load
2009-05-10T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	the kernel load is dependant on individual machines/hardware and packaging - so as I said "thats nonsese"
2009-05-10T15:29:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	well thats what i'v heard at least :D
2009-05-10T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Armageddon	I very much doubt that
2009-05-10T15:29:00.000Z	Armageddon	ikonia	ok :D
