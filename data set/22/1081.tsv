2010-10-16T20:38:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	it seems that grub isnt pointing to the boot partition. how many hard drives do you have
2010-10-16T20:39:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	can you please tell me how to point grub to the boot partition?
2010-10-16T20:42:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	i have limited experience in this, but there should be guides on how to perform a grub rescue or edit the startup to point to the correct partition. maybe booting in iwth the live usb stick and then confirming which partition is the boot partition, then writing it down, then booting the system off the hdd while holding shift to modify the grub loadup menu would allow you to get into the system and then modify it permane
2010-10-16T20:43:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	thanks for your help, i have tried a few guides on the internet about restoring grub with the livecd but they haven't worked.
2010-10-16T20:44:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	ok. what is your partition setup? i will look further
2010-10-16T20:44:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	i just need to start the machine up again from the livecd give me a few minutes
2010-10-16T20:52:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	did you mean disk utility? i cannot see a Disk Manager
2010-10-16T20:52:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	yes, disk utility. it show partitions
2010-10-16T20:54:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	it says i have a Recovery partition and a NTFS partition but no linux partitions? Yet I have just finished the Ubuntu installation?
2010-10-16T20:54:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	ok, maybe grub wasnt pointed to the right partition
2010-10-16T20:55:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	what is the name of the windows partition
2010-10-16T20:55:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	its sda2
2010-10-16T20:57:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	is the recovery partition sda1 or no designator? and you chose the install side by side option?
2010-10-16T20:58:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	yes i chose the side by side install and the recovery partition is sda1
2010-10-16T21:00:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	im not sure what happened with grub, but i tend to choose the advanced menu during the install to point grub to install to /dev/sda (the whole disk) and not to a partition like /dev/sda3. maybe that is what happened. it needs to be /dev/sda. can you click on sda3 and then set the flag to "boot"?
2010-10-16T21:01:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	there is no sda3 visible?
2010-10-16T21:02:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	ok. did you resize the partitions during the install to shrink windows?
2010-10-16T21:02:00.000Z	James-Blaze	magicianlord	yes
2010-10-16T21:02:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	and it went through the install process?
2010-10-17T01:17:00.000Z	magicianlord	James-Blaze	did you fix that issue with grub
