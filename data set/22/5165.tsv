2007-11-21T22:15:00.000Z	_Lucretia_		mental thrashing, keyboard locks up, mouse dead slow, display does shag all
2007-11-21T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	whathardware is this running on
2007-11-21T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	why are you making binutils
2007-11-21T22:17:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	binutils is tiny and takes no time to finish
2007-11-21T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	make -j3 will hammer your machine
2007-11-21T22:17:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	Intel Duo Core 2 E6600 2GB RAM, ATi X1950XT
2007-11-21T22:17:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	1.) binutils is core to ubuntu so I hope your not thinking or replacing it 2.) make -j3 will kill your machine for the duration of build
2007-11-21T22:18:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	cross compiling
2007-11-21T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	thats why your machine is getting hammered
2007-11-21T22:18:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	It shouldn't last an hour tho, binutils will build in a few minutes on this machine with j3
2007-11-21T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	unless a thread isn't finishing, have you checkted for example with top to see whats hammering your box
2007-11-21T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	what are you cross compiling for
2007-11-21T22:19:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	I can't do anything with the keyboard, so how am ?I supposed to do that?
2007-11-21T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	your keyboard hangs for an hour ? maybe ssh in see if something like that responds
2007-11-21T22:20:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	a test and arm-0elf
2007-11-21T22:20:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	can't no other machine to ssh in from
2007-11-21T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	could try running top in one widow and running the make see if the top window freezes or stays live
2007-11-21T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	run 2 top sessions one on memory one on cpu see what is being eaten
2007-11-21T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	careful on the language please
2007-11-21T22:22:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	is it possible you have a disk issue ?
2007-11-21T22:23:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	ikonia	nope, cos it did it on my old machine and it's a new drive
2007-11-21T22:23:00.000Z	ikonia	_Lucretia_	very interesting
