2007-05-20T13:42:00.000Z	digital_k	nom_	it should be noted that some themes will not install that way because they are multipart, you have to extract them then install them. usually the authors will say if thats the case, just a heads up :)
2007-05-20T13:49:00.000Z	digital_k	nom_	delete everything in there EXCEPT gtk2 and metacity
2007-05-20T13:50:00.000Z	nom_	digital_k	in the skin files?
2007-05-20T13:50:00.000Z	digital_k	nom_	open the gtk folder
2007-05-20T13:54:00.000Z	digital_k	nom_	back the folder that you extracted.

2007-05-20T14:28:00.000Z	digital_k	nom_	sudo apt-get autoremove and sudo apt-get autoclean work for me.
2007-05-20T14:29:00.000Z	nom_	digital_k	sudo apt-get autoclean, and the other, how to run them?
2007-05-20T14:30:00.000Z	nom_	digital_k	I know that. Ok, that will run the actual program, or just get it.
2007-05-20T14:31:00.000Z	digital_k	nom_	its a command line, the only way to run it is in terminal.
2007-05-20T14:32:00.000Z	digital_k	nom_	lol the commands tell the computer to get rid of junk, thats what they do. there is no graphical program, no.
