2008-10-04T22:57:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Tim1_	why do you need to go thro windows machine
2008-10-04T22:58:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Tim1_	just specify the dsl router as the gateway in the linux machine and you're through
2008-10-04T23:00:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Tim1_	then the router isnt configured as such it is configured as a transparent bridge
2008-10-04T23:02:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Tim1_	you need to check what your route -n says
2008-10-04T23:07:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Tim1_	what did your route -n say?
