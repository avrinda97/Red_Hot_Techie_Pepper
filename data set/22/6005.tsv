2007-01-04T11:20:00.000Z	sHd0w		silentdis yes
2007-01-04T11:22:00.000Z	sHd0w		silentdis i have been able to connect to mysql from outside my router so dont think it's the router
2007-01-04T11:22:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Do you have your permissions set up propperly?
2007-01-04T11:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	You might find that the user you created can only log in from localhost.
2007-01-04T11:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Here, what are you trying to do?
2007-01-04T11:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Ok, Comcast blocks port 80, so that's going to be a little difficult to do.
2007-01-04T11:26:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Ok, so you've got port 80. And you can access it from outside the router
2007-01-04T11:26:00.000Z	sHd0w	rukuartic	yes
2007-01-04T11:27:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Ok, but the problem is, (if I heard it right) that you can't access mysql outside of the box?
2007-01-04T11:29:00.000Z	sHd0w	rukuartic	http://customwebsitez.com I have the dns pointing to my  webserevrs ip
2007-01-04T11:29:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Try using source-o-matic to get a sources.list
2007-01-04T11:29:00.000Z	sHd0w	rukuartic	how do I do that??
2007-01-04T11:29:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	What happens when you try to "apt-get install <some software name>"?
2007-01-04T11:30:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Sorry. I'm lost man, what's the problem again?
2007-01-04T11:30:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Ok, I think those are in the global repositories.
2007-01-04T11:31:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic/ go here, and you should be able to get what you need. It will generate a sources.list
2007-01-04T11:31:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Place those files into /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-04T11:31:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Type in "apt-get update" and then you should be able to "apt-get install webalizer"
2007-01-04T11:32:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	Probably not.
2007-01-04T11:39:00.000Z	rukuartic	sHd0w	You could use putty, but Ubuntu has its own ssh client built in.
2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	sHd0w	rukuartic	thanks alot man ive been having problems with this for 3 days thanks so much man
