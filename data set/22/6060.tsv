2009-05-20T08:53:00.000Z	FluxD		Hi, this is my setup, http://i39.tinypic.com/b4f4a9.jpg I cannot boot to Ubuntu, please help in reisntalling grub
2009-05-20T08:54:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	What happens when you boot?
2009-05-20T08:55:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	I was using the vista bootloader to boot but it somehow messed up and doesnt let me boot in now
2009-05-20T08:56:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	ah, if you still want to use the vista bcd bootloader I would recommend using EasyBCD from within vista to configure, otherwise install grub.
2009-05-20T08:57:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	I did try with easybcd it wont let me boot into ubuntu still after removing and readding ubuntu
2009-05-20T08:58:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	That's bothersome... I dodn't know how to fix it through BCD then... does it give any messages when trying to boot into ubuntu?
2009-05-20T08:59:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	it gets stuck on Loading partiton image, and it says something about bootpart
2009-05-20T09:12:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	I think you might have lost the grub mbr on the partition, did you change the partition to which grub has written it's mbr recently?
2009-05-20T09:13:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	I did few weeks ago, but it was fine till I shutdown yesterday havent touched any partition for weeks
2009-05-20T09:13:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	hum, odd...
2009-05-20T09:14:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	usr13 raylu Can I delete my xp and vista partitions and free up space will that help? I actually need files from the FAT32
2009-05-20T09:15:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	Probably not with the boot issue... by the way how did you setup easybcd in the first place?
2009-05-20T09:16:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	xp and vista were auto added, and Ubuntu using the Linux tab
2009-05-20T09:17:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	how did you install ubuntu, with grub bootaloder etc.?
2009-05-20T09:18:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	installed vista first, then xp, then ubuntu, and installed grub to sda6 only I think
2009-05-20T09:24:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	you might want to try root (hd0,5) instead, if you still want to try to get bcd up.
2009-05-20T09:25:00.000Z	FluxD	arand	what do you mean?
2009-05-20T09:26:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	when using the commands you put in pastebin, that should install grub to mbr on sda6... I think
2009-05-20T09:30:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	That is your output? In that case it looks it might work...
2009-05-20T09:30:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	th0r: not within grub i don't think
2009-05-20T09:31:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	Now I think you could try configuring BCD again...
2009-05-20T09:31:00.000Z	arand	FluxD	exactemundo :)
