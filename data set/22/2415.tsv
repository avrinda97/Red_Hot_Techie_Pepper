However, everytime I print its stuck on processing and If I go to printing properites in ubuntu, I get "unable to connect to CIFS host

2009-06-25T06:33:00.000Z	bazhang	knasto	and the printer is connected to an XP box, and printer is set to allow sharing there?
2009-06-25T06:34:00.000Z	knasto	bazhang	yes the printer is set to allow sharing and all my xp firewalls are off.
