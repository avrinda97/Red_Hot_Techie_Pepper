2008-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	bidget		ok so one last question before I find something new to ask questions about
2008-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	bidget		I start steam from a terminal window, but once steam has started, is it ok to close the terminal?
2008-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	bidget		or will that close the whole thing
2008-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	bidget		oh hmm
2008-04-10T09:31:00.000Z	bidget		wine steam.exe
2008-04-10T09:32:00.000Z	bidget		gotcha
2008-04-10T09:32:00.000Z	bidget		well eventually I will just make a script so I can have like a quicklaunch shortcut type deal, I can do that, right?
2008-04-10T09:32:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	is this a steam server or client
2008-04-10T09:53:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	nautilus is not running, you can restart X and it should fix it
2008-04-10T09:53:00.000Z	bidget	hti_pro	what is nautilus?
2008-04-10T09:54:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	ubuntus window manager....also a file manager
2008-04-10T09:54:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	you can run nautilus from the command line, but you'll be left with an open terminal window
2008-04-10T09:55:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	if you close the window it will still terminate
2008-04-10T09:56:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	as someone mentioned earlier that only backgrounds the process
2008-04-10T09:56:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	did you use compiz --replace or nautilus
2008-04-10T10:01:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	thats exactly what i was gonna recommend
2008-04-10T10:02:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	are you running steam client or server
2008-04-10T10:03:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	f1,f2,f3.....
2008-04-10T10:03:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	does it run well, I have not had alot of luck performance wise with wine
2008-04-10T10:04:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	even simple non-graphic progs run slow
2008-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	definitely, pm me and tell me how it hoes, I am takin my a$$ to bed
2008-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	hti_pro	bidget	...goes
