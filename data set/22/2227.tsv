2011-04-10T07:28:00.000Z	Ben64		don't need nohup
2011-04-10T07:28:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	I believe you do need nohub
2011-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	Ben64	smw	nope, i just tried
2011-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	I just tested it right now
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	it did not work without nohup
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	test it again
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	Ben64	smw	how are you closing terminal?
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	smw		with the X button
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	smw		why?
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	Ben64		oh. i use CTRL+D
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	ah. typing exit works.
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	learn something new every day :-)
2011-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	Ben64	smw	so we're both right :P
2011-04-10T07:31:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	so I guess bash kills it when it gets a kill signal.
2011-04-10T07:31:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	but if it stops of its own volition, it does not kill the process.
2011-04-10T07:32:00.000Z	Ben64		i tend to use keyboard way more than mouse, so i never exit from the X
2011-04-10T07:33:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	makes sense. I normally exit from the X because I consider it a window function which is always done with a mouse :-P
2011-04-10T07:33:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	But I don't like to use the mouse either :-P
2011-04-10T07:33:00.000Z	Ben64		i love terminal
2011-04-10T07:33:00.000Z	Ben64		don't like using windows cause it's command line is terrible
2011-04-10T07:34:00.000Z	Ben64		uh oh
2011-04-10T07:34:00.000Z	smw	Ben64	that is why I use linux.
