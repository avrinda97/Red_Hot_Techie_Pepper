2008-04-07T02:21:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo		 i plugged in camera to usb, powered on camera, but no icon on desktop. when i do the same with my iPod, it works. lsusb indicates recognition of camera
2008-04-07T02:22:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	is camera setup to work as usb drive? otherwise check if it works with some pics program as PTP.
2008-04-07T02:22:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	i don't know. how do i figure out answer to your question?
2008-04-07T02:27:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	you there?
2008-04-07T02:28:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	yes, sorry, not watching channel much.
2008-04-07T02:28:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	question: how can i figure out whether my camera is set up to work as USB drive?
2008-04-07T02:29:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	can you check in camera's settings? my old hp had that setting there
2008-04-07T02:29:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	you mean on my camera itself?
2008-04-07T02:29:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	what type of camera you have? and yes, on camera, not pc
2008-04-07T02:30:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	canon powershot a60 ... is rather old.
2008-04-07T02:32:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	my canon works in PTP mode. try open f-spot and if that can recognize it.
2008-04-07T02:35:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	i don't think my canon powershot a60 has a "usb drive" option in the camera's settings.
2008-04-07T02:36:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	yes, i don't think either, i think canon cameras work only in PTP mode. therefore you won't see it as usb drive on your desktop. but it should pop up with "what you wanna do" if you connect.
2008-04-07T02:36:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	what do you mean by  "what you wanna do"
2008-04-07T02:37:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	basicaly will ask you what you want to do, if download pics etc. similar to windows popup windows if you wanna play/download, open folder etc..
2008-04-07T02:38:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	if you plug camera in, type dmesg in command line, if you get any output bout camera
2008-04-07T02:39:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	goin away for a bit.
2008-04-07T02:42:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	no i don't get that "what would you want to do" window.
2008-04-07T02:46:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	you back yet? i did dmesg, but don't know if i found camera
2008-04-07T02:47:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	it should tell you bout new usb being attached to pc. is cable ok?
2008-04-07T02:48:00.000Z	redwhitewaldo	bubu1uk	cable itself is ok. indeed, lsusb indicates recognition of camera
2008-04-07T02:49:00.000Z	bubu1uk	redwhitewaldo	have you tried to do it thru f-spot if you can download pics?
