2007-11-21T12:58:00.000Z	Creationist		Anyone use Enlightenment or able to tell me how to install it?
2007-11-21T12:59:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	sudo apt-get install enlightenment, or use synaptic
2007-11-24T22:38:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	right click on menu, select edit menus... , and check if that item is disabled
2007-11-24T22:39:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	Yeah, it's not listed there either.
2007-11-24T22:45:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	gksudo /usr/sbin/gdmsetup
2007-11-24T22:45:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	Thank you.
2007-11-24T22:46:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	Okay, how do I change to GDM when it's currently using KDM?
2007-11-24T22:47:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	not sure, maybe a sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm would do it
2008-01-19T15:22:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	Ah yeah... sorry.
2008-01-19T15:29:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	no not at all
2008-01-19T15:30:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	Well, I know a whois reports they are in the same state as me.... thought the first two sets of numbers being the same would mean we were using the same gateway, so-to-speak
2008-01-19T15:31:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	no it doesn't mean that at all, especially with comcast, there are only 255 or less to a subnet, each subnet is a separate gateway
2008-01-19T15:32:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	Oh... well crap.  Guess I'll just have to call them.  All I need is a city and I'd know who it was lol
2008-01-19T15:33:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	you can tell more by doing an nslookup on the ip address, the string after the ip should be city and state
2008-01-19T15:34:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	I don't see anything like that.
2008-01-19T15:34:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	This is all it says after the IP: .hsd1.mi.comcast.net
2008-01-19T15:35:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	guess it depends on the area then
2008-01-19T15:36:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	And gmail doesn't include the sender's IP address so I can't compare it that way.... hmm
2008-02-06T13:12:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	you probably want libqt4-dev or libqt3-mt-dev depending on which version it is using
2008-02-06T13:15:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	it's probably in qt4-dev-tools
2008-04-28T17:51:00.000Z	Creationist	astro76	What does YOUR name have to do with Ubuntu?  Aren't YOU in the wrong channel? ;)
2008-04-28T17:51:00.000Z	astro76	Creationist	:D
