2009-05-10T03:13:00.000Z	deek_		exciting, i booted from my ubuntu 9.04 USB stick and it blew out my vista partition
2009-05-10T03:13:00.000Z	deek_		well the partition is still there, but it won't load
2009-05-10T03:14:00.000Z	deek_		is there a gptsync for ubuntu 64?
2009-05-10T03:15:00.000Z	deek_		is there a gptsync for ubuntu 64?
2009-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	deek_		my system was running osx and vista 64 using the chameleon bootloader on an EFI partition...    i booted from a ubuntu USB drive and it deleted the boot loader
2009-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	deek_		i got the chameleon bootloader reinstalled on the efi partition, but it won't load vista, something about the bootbcd
2009-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	deek_		i'm here asking about this because its ubuntu that broke it
2009-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	deek_		someone recommended i try gptsync, but i can't find it for ubuntu 64
2009-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	deek_		so nobody has any input then?

2009-05-10T03:19:00.000Z	LadyNikon	deek_	you have tried to recover the boot loader by checking out grub?
