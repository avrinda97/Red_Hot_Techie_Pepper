2007-07-28T10:50:00.000Z	captine		hi all.  am serously struggling to install 64bit 7.04 on notebook
2007-07-28T10:50:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	any more details?
2007-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	acpi=off might be a better option.  also "pci=routeirq".  for someone else with a compaq acpi=off helped.
2007-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	wish i new that 2 years ago :)
2007-07-28T10:52:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	no worries you will get it working, probably
2007-07-28T10:53:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	shot.  will try now.  takes sooo long with the graphical instaler.  must admit, prefered the previous one
2007-07-28T10:53:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	use the text mode installer
2007-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	do i need the alternate cd to get text installer?
2007-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	yea
2007-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	try acpi=off on normal one
2007-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	it may be faster
2007-07-28T10:55:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	am trying
2007-07-28T10:58:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	eish, it takes long to boot the desktop cd.
2007-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	the cd booted, but has a logon screen..  is there a standard username?
2007-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	just wait 30 seconds
2007-07-28T11:07:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	by 30seconds, do u mean wait for u to finish helping other? or that it should auto login?
2007-07-28T11:07:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	auto ogin
2007-07-28T11:09:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	sorry to hound, but any idea of the username? or should i restart?
2007-07-28T11:10:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	username for what?  where?
2007-07-28T11:11:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	live cd giving me logon screen?
2007-07-28T11:11:00.000Z	xtknight	captine	it says at the bottom usually.  wait 10 seconds or a minute
2007-07-28T11:12:00.000Z	captine	xtknight	no such thing.  will reboot
