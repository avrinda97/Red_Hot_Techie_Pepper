2012-06-29T22:24:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	not that it really matters.. anyways..
2012-06-29T22:25:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	but we can tell your english has grammatic issues but we understand you
2012-06-29T22:26:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	people dont look into how to hack a live-linux cd or usb. You should install the real ubuntu..

2012-06-29T22:28:00.000Z	kav	jagginess	 : i already tried
2012-06-29T22:28:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	I don't know if the latest supports this, but maybe. Maybe the latest 'pangolin' iso, you can do-> cat <iso>  >  /dev/<YOUR USB DEVICE>    (Everything on your usb gets DESTROYED)
2012-06-29T22:29:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	does your bios support usbboot ?
2012-06-29T22:30:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	did you successfully install ubuntu on a usb? that i'm not sure because you say "2.install ubuntu 12.04 on it by making persistence of 2gb "
2012-06-29T22:30:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	your grammar does not indicate if you installed ubuntu
2012-06-29T22:32:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	oh I see, you're trying to use the internal harddrive as a storage for your live-usb.. nobody here does this..
2012-06-29T22:32:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	you'll have to join a mailing list for that.. (but you'll have to google)
2012-06-29T22:34:00.000Z	jagginess	kav	don't do that..
