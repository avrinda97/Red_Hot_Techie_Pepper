2012-04-12T00:13:00.000Z	Felishia		help... I need a video file player that doesn't depend on any other library
2012-04-12T00:13:00.000Z	Felishia		it's asking me for libavcodec53
2012-04-12T00:13:00.000Z	Felishia		but I can't get it installed
2012-04-12T00:14:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	Have you tried VLC? It bundles its own libraries as far as I know
2012-04-12T00:14:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	Why can't you install libavcodec package? It's part of the default repository
2012-04-12T00:14:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	What error do you get?
2012-04-12T00:20:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	It's possible to download the files on any OS directly from the Ubuntu website. And then just put them on a USB flash disk, and open on Ubuntu
2012-04-12T00:23:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	What error did you get when trying to install the .deb manually?
2012-04-12T00:25:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	It should tell you that. Do you get any messages if you try installing it via the command line? (sudo dpkg -i package.deb)
2012-04-12T00:29:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	Sorry, not sure what else to suggest... You could try the Windows installer of VLC with Wine I guess?
2012-04-12T00:29:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	Can't you watch it on the uni computers? You can download standalone VLC to run from a flash drive
2012-04-12T00:30:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	It shouldn't make a difference. Only the desktop environment is different, all the software is identical
2012-04-12T00:31:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	Without wanting to be patronising, did you download the right libavcodec for your particular version of Ubuntu?
2012-04-12T00:33:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	Do you know which version you're on? I can send you a link
2012-04-12T00:33:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	You can get packages from http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libavcodec53 but the interface is a bit confusing
2012-04-12T00:33:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	There are links on the upper right to switch between different Ubuntu versions, such as oneiric, precise etc.
2012-04-12T00:34:00.000Z	Felishia	SharkMuttleworth	11.04 it was the lasted released... I think so
2012-04-12T00:36:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	Do you know if your computer is running 32 or 64 bit? There are different packages for each
2012-04-12T00:37:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	You could try http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/liba/libav/libavcodec53_0.7.3-0ubuntu0.11.10.1_i386.deb
2012-04-12T00:38:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	You're right, it lists a few dependencies on the page http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libavcodec53 so it might complain without them. Unfortunately Ubuntu software assumes Internet Connectivity, without it's a real pain in the ass
2012-04-12T00:43:00.000Z	SharkMuttleworth	Felishia	There probably is some clever way to download a lot of deb's at once for offline usage. The problem is there are so many, it would be massive unless you filter it to a specific selection
2012-04-12T00:44:00.000Z	Felishia	SharkMuttleworth	multimedia and 3D
