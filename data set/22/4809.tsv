2007-10-03T08:22:00.000Z	BioPod		how stable is it? gusty beta.
2007-10-03T08:23:00.000Z	BioPod		I'm actually a fan of Kubutnu... any feedback on it?
2007-10-03T08:25:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	to continue this discussion, please join #ubuntu+1, as gutsy is offtopic here.
2007-10-03T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	yes
2007-10-03T08:18:00.000Z	BioPod	soundray	and did you managed to get it runing?
2007-10-03T08:19:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	yes, but it was fairly involved
2007-10-03T08:19:00.000Z	BioPod	soundray	farily involved? meaning it was very complicated?
2007-10-03T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	you will have it a bit easier, because I can tell you what to do.
2007-10-03T08:20:00.000Z	BioPod	soundray	:)
2007-10-03T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	first of all, are you planning to move to gutsy soon?
2007-10-03T08:20:00.000Z	BioPod	soundray	yea,
2007-10-03T08:21:00.000Z	BioPod	soundray	 (gusty is the 7.10, right?)
2007-10-03T08:21:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	then it might be worth downloading the beta live CD and see if your card works "out of the box" with it. If it does, it's probably not a good use of our time to compile the drivers for it now.
2007-10-03T08:22:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	yes, Gutsy Gibbon = Ubuntu 7.10
2007-10-03T08:22:00.000Z	BioPod	soundray	ok, i'll give it a try then. wouldnt want to waste your time (and mine)
2007-10-03T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	by definition it's not stable yet -- I download quite a lot of updates every day.
2007-10-03T08:24:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	you can download a Kubuntu Desktop CD to test your rt61 just as easily.
2007-10-03T08:42:00.000Z	BioPod	soundray	can I steal a few minutes of you to explain guide me through the rt61 thing without diving into the beta world?
2007-10-03T08:52:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	sure... still here?
2007-10-03T08:57:00.000Z	soundray	BioPod	hello, I'm back
