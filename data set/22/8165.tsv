2005-10-10T05:12:00.000Z	poningru_study	morbidi	if its cordless you absolutely need drivers
2005-10-10T05:12:00.000Z	morbidi	poningru_study	?
2005-10-10T05:12:00.000Z	poningru_study	morbidi	I need the model number for that
2005-10-10T05:13:00.000Z	morbidi	poningru_study	ok, but does logitech gives the drivers ?
2005-10-10T05:14:00.000Z	poningru_study	morbidi	you have to search for it
2005-10-10T05:15:00.000Z	morbidi	poningru_study	where does it say that ?
2005-10-10T05:15:00.000Z	poningru_study	morbidi	no clue it could be on the packaging or on the bottom of the mouse
2005-10-10T05:17:00.000Z	morbidi	poningru_study	there's a bunch of numbers
2005-10-10T05:17:00.000Z	poningru_study	morbidi	hmm
