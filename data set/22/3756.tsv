2008-10-26T05:08:00.000Z	sugi		Is it possible to make a bash file and have it edit a text document and save it?
2008-10-26T05:10:00.000Z	unop	sugi	you mean a bash script?
2008-10-26T05:11:00.000Z	sugi	unop	yea, sorry. can i make a bash file edit a text document and save it.
2008-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	unop	sugi	there are a multitude of ways - depending on what you want changing, where you want changing, etc .. but as sugi said, sed it probably best
2008-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	sugi	unop	is sed a probably or a command?
2008-10-26T05:13:00.000Z	unop	sugi	sed is a command, yes
2008-10-26T05:14:00.000Z	sugi	unop	_2, so sed /home/sugi/Desktop/test\ document
2008-10-26T05:15:00.000Z	unop	sugi	no, I suggest you read a sed howto/tutorial

2008-10-26T05:28:00.000Z	unop	sugi	you probably aren't using the right path to the file - if the filename has spaces, you will need to escape them properly
2008-10-26T05:30:00.000Z	sugi	unop	_2, I am using the correct path. I have copy the path from the terminal )when i need to cd to it's location.) and i can't open it with nano or egedit from the terminal, but if I use the GUI it's able to see it and open it.  I have tryed ti open it from the terminal for the last 3 days now.  i think it's more that a human error
2008-10-26T05:30:00.000Z	unop	sugi	what's the full filename?
2008-10-26T05:32:00.000Z	sugi	unop	nothing too stange. /home/sugi/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Lineage\ II/system/Option.ini
2008-10-26T05:35:00.000Z	unop	sugi	what happens when you do this?   ls  -l  /home/sugi/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Lineage\ II/system/Option.ini
2008-10-26T05:35:00.000Z	unop	sugi	or better.  ls -l "/home/sugi/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Lineage II/system/Option.ini"
2008-10-26T05:36:00.000Z	unop	sugi	 if that fails, make sure you have the right case in the filename, i.e. capitals, smalls, etc
2008-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	unop	sugi	if you want to debug a bash script - include this line, possibly after the first one,   set -x
2008-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	unop	sugi	that will give you a step by step breakdown of what the script is doing
2008-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	sugi	unop	doesn't bash files usually have terminal outputs?
2008-10-26T05:45:00.000Z	unop	sugi	no, not unless needed
2008-10-26T05:48:00.000Z	unop	sugi	yea, that's the idea
2008-10-26T05:28:00.000Z	sugi	unop	_2, I got the bash file working now.  it took a bit of editting and everything.
