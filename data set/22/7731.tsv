2006-05-15T05:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	deep	kopete can become very minimalistic quite easily, while still having so many options :)
2006-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	deep	for example with my amarok now I have kopete set to automatically change my status message to the song I'm playing, and to change my photo to the album cover of the song that's playing, too =)
2006-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	deep	apokryphos	MSN messenger - like ^^
2006-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	deep	it doesn't change your photo though, does it? :)
2006-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	deep	apokryphos	Yes, i have just switched to linux. ^^
2006-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	deep	yup, kde applications are configurable easily like that :P
2006-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	deep	apokryphos	Okay, you convinced me. Im trying that out NOW! ^^
