2006-08-27T11:03:00.000Z	R0bin		Enemy Territory by id software
2006-08-27T11:03:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	you don't need to run that as root
2006-08-27T11:04:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	install it to your home directory
2006-08-27T11:04:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	just run the installer, and it should see that you are not root and offer to install it in ~
2006-08-27T11:06:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	did you chmod it? what does ls -l *.run say about its permissions?
2006-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	chmod +x whatever.run && ./whatever.run
2006-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	obviously you'll need to change the "whatever" part
2006-08-27T11:09:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	You can also use tab-completion, type the first few letters of a person's name, then hit tab.
2006-08-27T11:15:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	that enables the execute bit
2006-08-27T12:24:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	that is not the game executable.
2006-08-27T12:25:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	gnomefreak: listen to me.
2006-08-27T12:25:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	`did you download the source?
2006-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	R0bin	Agrajag	Yes but I thought it was compiled 2 in the bin directory? :/
2006-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	did you compile it?
2006-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	R0bin	Agrajag	no
2006-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	then you need to do that
2006-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	R0bin	Agrajag	what is the command
2006-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	R0bin	first you need to install build-essential.
