2011-10-29T14:46:00.000Z	catson	hrolf	do that and then see if you can adjust your gamma setting
2011-10-29T14:47:00.000Z	hrolf	catson	From where should I download them? Ubuntu Software Centre or should I check my manufacturers website?
2011-10-29T14:47:00.000Z	catson	hrolf	which dist are you running
2011-10-29T14:47:00.000Z	catson		10.x or 11.x i assume
2011-10-29T14:47:00.000Z	hrolf		Ubuntu 11.10
2011-10-29T14:47:00.000Z	catson		should be under additional drivers then
2011-10-29T14:47:00.000Z	catson		just type that in the unity search
2011-10-29T14:48:00.000Z	hrolf	catson	Okay, let me see.
2011-10-29T14:48:00.000Z	catson		retrograde79, do you know a way I can completely reinstall Unity? it went totally haywire after i installed compizconfig
2011-10-29T14:49:00.000Z	catson		like it will not show up when I log in all :(
2011-10-29T14:50:00.000Z	hrolf	catson	I think I have Addtional Drivers already installed
2011-10-29T14:50:00.000Z	catson		see about video settings then
2011-10-29T14:50:00.000Z	hrolf	catson	Is this the thing you were referring to "jockey-gtk 0.9.4-0ubuntu10" ?
2011-10-29T14:50:00.000Z	catson		gamma should be somewhere in your video settings
2011-10-29T14:50:00.000Z	catson		no, haha
2011-10-29T14:51:00.000Z	hrolf	catson	It's the version I got from Ubuntu Software Centre
2011-10-29T14:51:00.000Z	catson		Well i'm almost positive jockey-gtk isn't a driver
2011-10-29T14:52:00.000Z	catson		gtk is a gui thing
2011-10-29T14:53:00.000Z	catson		makes sense
2011-10-29T14:54:00.000Z	hrolf	catson	Also, if I view in System Info -> Graphics the Driver is listed as "Unknown" which must mean that it wasn't able to find the right driver.
2011-10-29T14:55:00.000Z	catson	hrolf	what card do you have
2011-10-29T14:57:00.000Z	hrolf	catson	How do I check that?
