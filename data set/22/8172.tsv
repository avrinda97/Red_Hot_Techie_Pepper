2005-11-17T14:00:00.000Z	lightsource		where can I find my firefox directory?
2005-11-17T14:01:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	you mean, where it stores profiles?
2005-11-17T14:03:00.000Z	lightsource	njan	well I want to update it to 1.5RC, and I noticed that the files that they give me in the tar.gz are all directory files, so I figured that I would just replace them
2005-11-17T14:04:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	do you have a particular reason for not upgrading through apt-get/synaptic?
2005-11-17T14:04:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	installing packages through tar.gz files is particularly messy..
2005-11-17T14:04:00.000Z	lightsource	njan	synaptic only updates my firefox to 1.0.7 but I want 1.5. And I forgot how to apt-get..
2005-11-17T14:05:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	synaptic == apt-get, for these purposes
2005-11-17T14:05:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	either read the README in the .tar.gz and it should tell you how to install, or just wait - I'd just wait if I were you
2005-11-17T14:05:00.000Z	lightsource	njan	thanks
2005-11-17T14:05:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	installing packages outwith apt-get really is really messy, it leaves crap all over the filing system and they're hard to uninstall
2005-11-17T14:05:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	and you risk breaking things that are then hard to fix
2005-11-17T14:06:00.000Z	lightsource	njan	"==" meaning the program I want right?
2005-11-17T14:06:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	I mean, synaptic and apt-get essentially do the same thing, so if it isn't available via synaptic it won't via apt-get
2005-11-17T14:06:00.000Z	lightsource	njan	should I close everything I have open if I'm about to upgrade to 5.10?
2005-11-17T14:07:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	I wouldn't - nothing should break, apps might just die if things they're dependent upon suddenly change and get reloaded mid install.
2005-11-17T14:07:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	but again, read the upgrade guide ;)
2005-11-17T14:07:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	there's a pre-upgrade step or two, and some common problems listed iirc
2005-11-17T14:07:00.000Z	lightsource	njan	I took the pre-upgrade steps
2005-11-17T14:09:00.000Z	njan	lightsource	go for it, then. Good luck. :)
2005-11-17T14:09:00.000Z	lightsource	njan	thanks
