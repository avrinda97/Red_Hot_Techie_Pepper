2008-10-23T05:39:00.000Z	csilk	redheat_	that may of looked bold to you, but not to anyone else
2008-10-23T05:41:00.000Z	csilk	redheat_	yes, and twice no-one replied because a) people are busy b) people dont know c) you didnt give nearly enough info to rouse anyones attention
2008-10-23T05:47:00.000Z	csilk	redheat_	 someone will answer when they are ready, and you still havent given neough info to fic your problem anyway
2008-10-23T05:48:00.000Z	redheat_	csilk	I can't find a solution for this problem..simply I can't login to my wireless network...
2008-10-23T05:49:00.000Z	csilk	redheat_	thats a crap question
2008-10-23T05:49:00.000Z	redheat_	csilk	you read the question before, you don't wanna help that's fine, no need for crap talking please
2008-10-23T05:50:00.000Z	csilk	redheat_	I'm just trying to tell you to stop being a whining petty child and respect the fact NO-ONE has to help you. eben though at some point someone will, now do some legwork and turn off your wep/wpa and tell me if you can login with no security
2008-10-23T05:51:00.000Z	redheat_	csilk	that's crossing a line..show some respect..you don't wanna help fine, just don't cross the line..
