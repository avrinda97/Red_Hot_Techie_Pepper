2007-03-17T05:43:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	I am running beryl... love it.  Don't really use the features to much, but it looks cool for when my friends as what I'm use.
2007-03-17T05:43:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	has it crashed yet?
2007-03-17T05:44:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	not sure about compiz, but the only thing I don't like about beryl is that my shortcuts are overridden and only the beryl shortcuts work...
2007-03-17T05:44:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	i guess that is a problem when you know the shortcuts :). i am trying to get my parents on, and they will probably never use the shortcuts
2007-03-17T05:44:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	at first I had some difficulty... it never crashed my computer, but I had to revert to metacity (I think that was it)... i've been running it for some months now without a hitch
2007-03-17T05:44:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	rgr :O)
2007-03-17T05:45:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	so i guess apt-get install compiz should do it? (I use FC btw, so i am also completely new to the ubuntu scene)
2007-03-17T05:46:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	sorry, beryl
2007-03-17T05:46:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	i have used compiz, so I know immediately when i was running compiz and when i was not
2007-03-17T05:46:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	well I am completely new the whole whole scene period.  To be honest, i forget how I got it... I know I did a TON of reading to get it... took me a few weeks, but I wasn't comfortable w/ the command line.  I will try to find the site I used... it was very easy with all the steps.  The problem i had was that most of the tutorials ended up with bad repositories.
2007-03-17T05:49:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	in regards to the beryl vs compiz, I think beryl is more active... not sure about now, but that was the reason I went with beryl... they had  more stuff and it was (I read) more developed considering how long it had been running (i.e. not as advanced and compiz, but when compiz was where beryl was, it was way behind... does that make sense?)
2007-03-17T05:51:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	well, i have not been able to find beryl screenshots, so i really have no idea how it looks
2007-03-17T05:51:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	as such i thought that compiz was better organized
2007-03-17T05:51:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	oOo, hmm... yea, not sure on that, that's just what I read and it was awhile ago
2007-03-17T05:52:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	a youtube will be good
2007-03-17T05:52:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	rgr, one sec
2007-03-17T05:56:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	this one is lengthy... i was trying to find the one that really make me decide on beryl but I couldn't find it, sorry, anyway:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOWeeVvhiAw
2007-03-17T05:57:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	np! let me check this one out
2007-03-17T05:59:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	it looks jumpy, but I think that's the recording software as mine runs smooth as could be, but doesn't look nearly as good when I record it.
2007-03-17T05:59:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	i will view it soon. i need to step out now..
2007-03-17T05:59:00.000Z	SubMOA	dhaval	rgr, bye
2007-03-17T05:59:00.000Z	dhaval	SubMOA	:( bye
