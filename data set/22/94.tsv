2012-07-30T00:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	hmm, thats odd
2012-07-30T00:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	lspci | grep -i vga
2012-07-30T00:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	ah, how new is it?
2012-07-30T00:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	are you on 12.04?
2012-07-30T00:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	i think arch uses beta drivers (i'm on arch at the mo)
2012-07-30T00:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	that card is likely a bit too new for 12.04
2012-07-30T00:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	whats stopping you keeping arch?
2012-07-30T00:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	considering that is older than 12.04 i doubt it
2012-07-30T00:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	i don't use ppas
2012-07-30T00:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	ask in #ubuntu+1
2012-07-30T00:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	inv_	what do you mean by that?
