2010-10-20T03:12:00.000Z	goltoof		how would i copy all contents in file to clipboard?  with terminal
2010-10-20T03:13:00.000Z	goltoof		ie,  copything /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
2010-10-20T03:14:00.000Z	goltoof		then i can just paste wherever i want
2010-10-20T03:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	doubt it's possible!  there are like 3 running clipboards in linux!
2010-10-20T03:15:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	 thanks  :)
2010-10-20T03:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	using the middle mouse key is a common example for #2 - try by highlighting text in terminal then (most likely) clicking your mouse wheel (it's separate from gnome) - i forget the third
2010-10-20T03:17:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	 good to know
2010-11-06T06:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	good question.  not that i personally know of, but hoping someone has an answer for you.  good luck man.
2010-11-06T06:42:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	sounds like something someone can write pretty easily
2010-11-06T06:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	well considering vimtutor is just a text file opened in vim - i'd say yes ;)
2010-11-06T06:43:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	  heh.... you know what i mean
2010-11-06T07:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	+1
2010-11-10T04:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	FYI it's "ps aux" if you look at the top of your "ps -aux" you will see an error about the "-"
2010-11-10T04:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	i used to use -aux all the time until someone pointed it out to me
2010-11-10T04:27:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	  noted
2010-11-10T04:28:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	  it's logical  to use  -     as it is in most things
2010-11-11T23:17:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	  perhaps i should reconsider :)  it's all i ever tried really
2011-01-13T20:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	sounds like it's is logging into the xterm option instead of gnome - something that is selected after you click your username at the GDM screen, session at the bottom - be sure it is set to ubuntu-desktop
2011-01-13T20:46:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	 i have no such option, at login it only lets me enter a username and pwd, doesn't default anymore
2011-01-13T20:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	for that i have no idea - good luck man.
2011-01-13T20:47:00.000Z	goltoof	ZykoticK9	 thx anyway
2011-01-29T03:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	goltoof	you could try "eject /dev/cdrom" and replace cdrom with the various options
