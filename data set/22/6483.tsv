2006-12-08T15:21:00.000Z	brussel		Why on edgy desktop isn't there a menu item to start up vim?
2006-12-08T15:21:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	it's there, it's just disabled
2006-12-08T15:21:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	How do I enable it?
2006-12-08T15:21:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	if you have gVim installed, you can right click Applications, and click edit menus
2006-12-08T15:22:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	it should be under Accessories
2006-12-08T15:22:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Is gvim a package I can load with Synaptic?
2006-12-08T15:22:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	vim-gtk
2006-12-08T15:22:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	sorry, yeah, vim-gnome
2006-12-08T15:23:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Thanks, I'll download it now
2006-12-08T15:27:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Where does vim-gnome show up on the menu system? I've looked twice and I'll be darned if I can see it.
2006-12-08T15:28:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	when you first install it, it will be disabled, you'll have to edit the menu, it's under the Accessories category
2006-12-08T15:28:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	I should add I just installed it.
2006-12-08T15:29:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	That brings up an interesting question.. How do edit the menu?
2006-12-08T15:29:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Sorry for the stupid question, I should have looked first.
2006-12-08T15:33:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Ok, I enabled the gvim, I'm not sure what is different about it other than I can get to it without first starting a shell. Now for the real problem....
2006-12-08T15:34:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	has mouse wheel support, only thing I like about it
2006-12-08T15:34:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	When I hit the escape key in gvim I get a <F6> instead of just an escape into command mode.
2006-12-08T15:35:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Is there some system keyboard mapping program that I can fix this. It seems my USB keyboard isn't sending the right strokes...
2006-12-08T15:36:00.000Z	orion2012	brussel	Sorry, I'm not sure. What keymap are you using?
2006-12-08T15:37:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Not sure. When I installed Ubuntu last night I told it to use the American keyboard style.
2006-12-08T15:38:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	It says "US English" in the keyboard preferences.
2006-12-08T15:39:00.000Z	brussel	orion2012	Oh, cool, it has a way of selecting which keyboard you are using in the panel. I'll play with that...
