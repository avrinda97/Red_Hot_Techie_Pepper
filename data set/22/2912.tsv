2009-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	donavan01		anyone know why my audio just keeps kicking the bucket ... works fine for a day or so then it craps out and I have to reboot
2009-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	hardy? intrepid? jaunty? karmic?
2009-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	 8.1 (can't remeber which one that is)
2009-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	intrepid if it's 8.10 (the trailing zero is significant, since it stands for october)
2009-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	didnt know that ... but yeah its 8.10
2009-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	how does it "kick the bucket"? are audio apps just inaudible? does the machine freeze?
2009-07-10T05:29:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	no sound but the system seems to think its playing them just fine mp3 video and even flash
2009-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	seems like the audio driver or something gets all goofy and a reboot reloads them ... bad memory allocation or something wasnt sure is anyone knew of anything ... I was thinking about just biting the bullet and upgrading to 9.(whatever it is)
2009-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	that description seems like a simple mixer setting becoming set (incorrectly, e.g., being zeroed and/or muted)
2009-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	next time that happens, please check the output from 'amixer -c0'
2009-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	its doing it right now
2009-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	what am I looking for
2009-07-10T05:34:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	Playback items that are muted, namely PCM, Master, Front, Headphone, Surround
2009-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	everything looks OK but could you take a look I just incase (im still a semi-noob) http://pastebin.com/d40d2b69d
2009-07-10T05:39:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	are you actually experiencing the problem _right this moment_?
2009-07-10T05:39:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	if not, that output won't help us
2009-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	donavan01		yes
2009-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	yes right now
2009-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	are you using speakers or headphones?
2009-07-10T05:43:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	 speakers (5 mains and a sub)... the speakers are fine I can hear the pop/crackle noise from the volume knob and like I said its 100% as soon as I reboot so it cant be the speakers
2009-07-10T05:46:00.000Z	dtchen	donavan01	did you try unmuting Headphone, PC Speaker, Line, or LFE?
2009-07-10T05:49:00.000Z	donavan01	dtchen	... yeah tried that on but those are actually for the jacks on the front of my case I think I have something 10 total in/out jacks on this mobo... its a nightmare trying to get the surround sound plugged in the right jacks
