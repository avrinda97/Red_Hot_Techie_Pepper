2008-10-18T10:17:00.000Z	jclbrt		hey I am trying to install aura GTK engine and I followed the directions on http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-778611.html
2008-10-18T10:19:00.000Z	jclbrt		however when I get to the part where it says i need to type in "make". I get the following: " make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop."
2008-10-18T10:19:00.000Z	jclbrt		why doesn't it work as the directions imply it should
2008-10-18T10:20:00.000Z	FAJ	jclbrt	have you read the INSTALL in the dir?
