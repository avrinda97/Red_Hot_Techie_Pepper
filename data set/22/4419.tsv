2009-01-19T10:40:00.000Z	Rencx		please snyone help me with encrition and keyring
2009-01-19T10:41:00.000Z	Rencx		i need remove it
2009-01-19T10:41:00.000Z	Rencx		it starts show up
2009-01-19T10:41:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	that would be a very silly idea indeed
2009-01-19T10:42:00.000Z	Rencx	Paddy_EIRE	why it started to show up?
2009-01-19T10:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	why not?
2009-01-19T10:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	read the webpages nightrid3r already showed you
2009-01-19T10:45:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	how is that a problem
2009-01-19T10:46:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	everytime?
2009-01-19T10:47:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	hmm.. and when you enter the details normally does it connect without issue?
2009-01-19T10:48:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	can you tell me what you have perhaps done in between it working an not working?
2009-01-19T10:48:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	that would be it
2009-01-19T10:48:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	on moment please
2009-01-19T10:51:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	could you please try this first http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/07/12/automatically-unlocking-the-default-gnome-keyring-pam-keyring/
2009-01-19T10:52:00.000Z	Rencx	Paddy_EIRE	it also make my wireles not work
2009-01-19T10:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	it would not be wise to remove the keyring for something so trivial.. yet it is annoying
2009-01-19T10:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	try that first
2009-01-19T10:53:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	you see by default the keyring associates your user password along with the keyring password.. as far as I know that has been depreciated but it seems to be what you are suffering with
2009-01-19T10:54:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	if that method fails we will try something else
2009-01-19T10:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Rencx	you are not making much sense.. also look here http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/07/06/clearing-or-resetting-the-gnome-keyring/
