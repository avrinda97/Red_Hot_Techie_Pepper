2010-03-04T04:52:00.000Z	smrln		Anyone know why dd would be copying at a rate of 2.8 MB/s between two 3gb/s sata drives? :(
2010-03-04T04:53:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	are they internal or usb?
2010-03-04T04:54:00.000Z	smrln	dacorr	both internal, but the source is a partition
2010-03-04T04:54:00.000Z	smrln		I'm beginning to think the drive has gone bad
2010-03-04T04:54:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	are you running dd on a drive and storing the image on the other?
2010-03-04T04:55:00.000Z	smrln	dacorr	I ran this command dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1
2010-03-04T04:57:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	so your imaging a drive that will slow things down a bit
2010-03-04T04:58:00.000Z	smrln	dacorr	I really didn't want an image, but the exact file structure, because I'm copying my broken windows partition on to another drive
2010-03-04T04:58:00.000Z	smrln	dacorr	should I restart the process differently, because this is painfully slow
2010-03-04T04:59:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	imaging or a bit by bit copy will be slow, especially if the disk is damaged, ie bad sectors etc
2010-03-04T05:00:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	i image drives a fare amount and depending on size it can take most of the day or longer
2010-03-04T05:00:00.000Z	smrln	dacorr	will it matter that the source partition is larger than the destination, but the amount of data on the source is less than the destination partition
2010-03-04T05:00:00.000Z	smrln		I don't want to get to the end and see an error
2010-03-04T05:01:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	i am guessing its not for forensics, what exactly are you trying to do?
2010-03-04T05:02:00.000Z	smrln		I have a 50GB drive, with a 350GB windows(ntfs) partition and a 100GB ubuntu partition.  Windows went bad, so I booted into ubuntu to backup the windows partition to another 250GB drive I have
2010-03-04T05:02:00.000Z	smrln		500GB*
2010-03-04T05:04:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	are you going to reinstall windows?
2010-03-04T05:04:00.000Z	smrln	dacorr	yes
2010-03-04T05:05:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	if ubuntu can read the drive then copy the files you need to keep, only us dd if there is problems reading the drive
2010-03-04T05:05:00.000Z	smrln	dacorr	ok thanks
2010-03-04T05:06:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	dd images or copies everything that can be read and attempts to recreate on the destination
2010-03-04T05:10:00.000Z	dacorr	smrln	also keep in mind linux ignores windows permissions etc and will add the permissions of the user account copying and same when writing back to windows although easier to manipulate on ntfs
