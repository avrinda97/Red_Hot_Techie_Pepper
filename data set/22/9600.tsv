2005-04-11T13:59:00.000Z	bob2	aod	did you run it as root?
2005-04-11T13:59:00.000Z	bob2	aod	dpkg -L ndiswrapper | grep bin
2005-04-11T14:00:00.000Z	bob2	aod	what does that print out?
2005-04-11T14:02:00.000Z	bob2	aod	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/ndiswrapper
2005-04-11T14:29:00.000Z	bob2	aod	dude
2005-04-11T14:29:00.000Z	bob2	aod	are you reading the URL I gave you or not?
2005-04-11T14:30:00.000Z	bob2	aod	you read the howto I pointed you at?
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z	bob2	aod	because I don't see anything in that page that mentions installing "ndiswrapper-modules"
2005-04-11T14:31:00.000Z	bob2	aod	please just read the howto again (http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/ndiswrapper)
2005-04-11T14:32:00.000Z	bob2	aod	seriously, read that page, it explains it all
2005-04-11T14:34:00.000Z	bob2	aod	seriously, read the howto
2005-04-11T14:35:00.000Z	bob2	aod	yes
2005-04-11T14:36:00.000Z	bob2	aod	which step are you up to?
2005-04-11T14:38:00.000Z	bob2	aod	I'm not sure how you got that error
2005-04-11T14:39:00.000Z	bob2	aod	nothing seems to depend on ndiswrapper-modules-1.1
2005-04-11T14:39:00.000Z	bob2	aod	ignore sourceforge
2005-04-11T14:40:00.000Z	bob2	aod	you get that error when installing the "ndiswrapper-utils" package?
2005-04-11T14:40:00.000Z	bob2	aod	can you show us the EXACT error (in #flood)?
2005-04-11T14:46:00.000Z	bob2	aod	where did you get ndiswrapper-utils from?  ubuntu.com?
2005-04-11T14:47:00.000Z	bob2	aod	you need to get it from ubuntu
