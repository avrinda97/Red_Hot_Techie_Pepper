2006-08-22T07:26:00.000Z	WildChild		I want to install Dapper Drake on a computer that has a 3dfx voodoo 3 3000 video card. I had some problem showing the framebuffer but I solved it. Now, X starts in 640x480 mode and the installer is too big to be shown completely in the screen. Is there any way to make a text install with Dapper Drake?
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	Inferus	WildChild	you can do a server install
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	Inferus		which is text-only
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	WildChild	Inferus	will I be able to install X with the server install?
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	WildChild		same program installed?
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	Inferus	WildChild	not initially
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	Inferus		but once it boots up
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	Inferus		you login
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	WildChild		grrr :)
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	Inferus		and then type
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	Inferus		sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	WildChild		i know how to install x
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	Inferus		and it'll sort it out
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	WildChild		with dpkg
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	Inferus		no
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	Inferus		just do that
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	Inferus		sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	WildChild		ok
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	Inferus		and it'll install the bits you're missing
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	Inferus		=] 
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	WildChild		that suck because with 5.10 I was able to install without any problem...
2006-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	Inferus	WildChild	i would personally recommend kubuntu-desktop it is very nice :D
