2012-04-25T09:01:00.000Z	Derpadong		Oh yeah

2012-04-25T09:02:00.000Z	Derpadong		Im deciding on If I should scrap this Windows 7 install for a *buntu distro or not
2012-04-25T09:03:00.000Z	Derpadong		Ive mainly been doing 'Arch' and 'Debian net installs'
2012-04-25T09:04:00.000Z	Derpadong		Mhm
2012-04-25T09:04:00.000Z	cfedde	Derpadong	install whatever linux you want on a separate partition as dual boot.  Or install virtual box on windows and one or more vm in that.
2012-04-25T09:04:00.000Z	Derpadong		I wish my netbook did SATA drives but does SSD instead
2012-04-25T09:05:00.000Z	cfedde	Derpadong	How is that a problem?
2012-04-25T09:06:00.000Z	Derpadong		Cause I have a crap load of Sata drives in my room lol
2012-04-25T09:07:00.000Z	cfedde	Derpadong	it's easy enough to hook one up to the lappy with a usb to sata adapter.
2012-04-25T09:07:00.000Z	Derpadong		Its very tricky for this netbook
2012-04-25T09:07:00.000Z	Derpadong		Its the original cr48 lol
