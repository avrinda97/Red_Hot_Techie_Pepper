2009-08-19T19:22:00.000Z	QuantumKaos	g3org3s	u just remove it after install and put wicd or whatever u like
2009-08-19T19:24:00.000Z	g3org3s	QuantumKaos	if i install it , my pc wont connect to internet, wont have access to remove it
2009-08-19T19:24:00.000Z	QuantumKaos	g3org3s	thatz impossible, if u dont have access itz a question of permissions
2009-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	g3org3s	QuantumKaos	its not me .. its the server farm where it is , they have their settings .. so when network manager is installed .. the old settings are gone = no more acces no itnernet
2009-08-19T19:26:00.000Z	QuantumKaos	g3org3s	so what r u exactly trying to do?
2009-08-19T19:26:00.000Z	QuantumKaos	g3org3s	r u trying to upgrade ur sys, to switch to ubuntu from kubuntu? what r u exacly trying to do?
2009-08-19T19:26:00.000Z	g3org3s	QuantumKaos	i want to install gnome .. then vnc to my server ... it has a fresh ubuntu install , no graphical itnerface
2009-08-19T19:29:00.000Z	g3org3s	QuantumKaos	so can i install it and not include the network manager ?
2009-08-19T19:30:00.000Z	QuantumKaos	g3org3s	dont think so, ubuntu comes with nm out of the box, but u can try to find on google some software that allows u to customize ur ubuntu installation cd so u can exclude nm from it
