2007-01-02T06:25:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	msn, icq, aol, jabber?
2007-01-02T06:26:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	ok, there's a program called "amsn" that works pretty well
2007-01-02T06:26:00.000Z	phr34ck	doviende	thanks .. will give it a try
2007-01-02T06:27:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	why, do you see something that's wrong?
2007-01-02T06:28:00.000Z	phr34ck	doviende	no .. but I feel like I need to do something ... It's like I'm downloading 2, 3 programs for the same job
2007-01-02T06:29:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	if you see some programs you don't want, then you can remove them
2007-01-02T06:29:00.000Z	phr34ck	doviende	I don't know how to remove programs ;p
2007-01-02T06:29:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	ok, what did you use to install programs?
2007-01-02T06:30:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	you can do    "apt-get remove somepackage" to remove it
2007-01-02T06:31:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	you could browse through stuff with a graphical program like Synaptic
2007-01-02T06:31:00.000Z	phr34ck	doviende	doesn't synaptic gives me the packages installed?
2007-01-02T06:31:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	or in text mode you can do "dpkg -l" to list every single package installed
2007-01-02T06:31:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	yes, synaptic lists the packages installed, and can install new ones or remove stuff
2007-01-02T06:32:00.000Z	phr34ck	doviende	so programs are packages in herE>
2007-01-02T06:33:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	packages are a nice way to keep track of all of the programs and libraries that are installed.   it's like "Add/Remove Programs" in windows, but better
2007-01-02T06:33:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	sometimes in windows, you install a program and it doesn't show up in "Add/Remove Programs".  in ubuntu, if you always install software using packages, then it's very easy to remove it later too
2007-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	phr34ck	doviende	I know that Linux is a decended of Unix. Since Unix is used on servers.
2007-01-02T06:36:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	ya, apt knows how to find packages on the ubuntu website and download them, and then technically uses dpkg behind the scenes
2007-01-02T06:41:00.000Z	doviende	phr34ck	unix gets used as a generic term.  so linux is sorta like a type of unix
