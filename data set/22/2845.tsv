2009-02-18T17:18:00.000Z	illumin8	ActionParsnip1	Thanks yet again :)
2009-02-18T17:34:00.000Z	illumin8	ActionParsnip1	Being rather new to linux i find myself lost alot in the linux versions of commands that im accustomed to in Windows. I just wanted to inform you that I really appreciate your help over the past few days.
2009-02-18T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	np man, who knows you could help me one day, it's what makes the world go round
2009-02-18T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	you can make aliases of commands if you really want but moving to a system without will blow yourr mind
2009-02-18T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	close enough
2009-02-18T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	its a terminal command, try it
2009-02-18T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	true but one line will identify your soundcard
2009-02-18T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	you can grep it too
2009-02-18T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	lspci | grep -i vga
2009-02-18T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	its great when someones h/w doesnt work, tells you what it is
2009-02-18T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	it makes the sound work apparently
2009-02-18T18:36:00.000Z	illumin8	ActionParsnip1	I notice some people use ; and some use && to seperate commands in terminal, whats the diffirence
2009-02-18T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	; means "do this, then that" && means "do this then ONLY do that if this passes successfully"
2009-02-18T18:37:00.000Z	illumin8	ActionParsnip1	good to know, so its a if then command (&&)
2009-02-18T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	yeah just makes sure all previos steps passed ok
2009-02-25T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	illumin8	its on the repos so as long as your system has the oficial repos (more than likely does) it can be installed with: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
