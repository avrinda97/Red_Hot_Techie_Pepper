2007-04-15T13:11:00.000Z	kapputu		just installed Feisty on my Thinkpad. I can see my windows network but I'm not being authenticated
2007-04-15T13:12:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	what method of authentication are you using?
2007-04-15T13:12:00.000Z	kapputu	neozen	The Windows machine has an account for this ubuntu user.
2007-04-15T13:13:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	ok.....
2007-04-15T13:13:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	are you trying to access a share on the windows machine or actually log into the windows machine?
2007-04-15T13:13:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	do you have anything crazy like smart-cards turned on or something?
2007-04-15T13:14:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	on the windows box
2007-04-15T13:14:00.000Z	kapputu	neozen	nope. It ain't accepting my username/password. I'm still using the live cd. Does that matter?
2007-04-15T13:14:00.000Z	kapputu	neozen	Also, I've connected using Edgy before though I've had to configure Samba by hand
2007-04-15T13:14:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	aaah... you're trying to use samba
2007-04-15T13:15:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	didn't see the response
2007-04-15T13:15:00.000Z	kapputu	neozen	yeah, Feisty apparently comes with Samba by default which is very cool
2007-04-15T13:16:00.000Z	kapputu	neozen	haven't had any problems with authentication before
2007-04-15T13:19:00.000Z	kapputu	neozen	any ideas?
2007-04-15T13:20:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	no ideas actually
2007-04-15T13:20:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	other then perhaps a broken version of samba in feisty
2007-04-15T13:20:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	that would suck though
2007-04-15T13:21:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	head over to #ubuntu+1
2007-04-15T13:21:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	they'd be able to help you
2007-04-15T13:21:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	this room doesn't officially support feisty .... yet
2007-04-15T13:22:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	after feisty gets released on the 19th ... feisty support should be here as well
2007-04-15T13:22:00.000Z	neozen	kapputu	sorry
