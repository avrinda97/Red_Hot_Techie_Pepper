2009-07-18T00:03:00.000Z	zortec		Anyone have ideas on how I can enable cdrom in ubuntu? It doesn't seem to be detected by the kernel in dmesg
2009-07-18T00:04:00.000Z	zortec		I was told that I would have to reinstall ubuntu, but if I can I would like to just install the packages needed to make the cdrom work
2009-07-18T00:06:00.000Z	zortec		DasEil: No it doesn't
2009-07-18T00:08:00.000Z	zortec		Do I need to reinstall ubuntu for the 5th time? I can't use the main iso because it doesn't recognize my onboard and so  a user in here told me to use the minimal install
2009-07-18T00:09:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	doesn't recognize your onboard what
2009-07-18T00:10:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	It doesn't recognize my onboard video geforce 7300 nforce graphics, and I was in the irc room for 2 days trying to figure it out so I had to use a cli interface and manually download all the packages and now I don't have a working cdrom
2009-07-18T00:19:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	does dmesg |grep CD  give you any info on it?
2009-07-18T00:19:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	nothing comes up
2009-07-18T00:20:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	how about dmesg |grep DVD
2009-07-18T00:20:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	nope
2009-07-18T00:20:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	it's like the kernel didn't even load a cd/dvd drive
2009-07-18T00:21:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	it's not even seeing it in the bios
2009-07-18T00:21:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	if it's not in dmesg somewhere
2009-07-18T00:21:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	it does see it in my computer bios and it was working with no problems in windows, just when I booted into ubuntu there is no drive
2009-07-18T00:22:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	can you just run dmesg and find a reference to it
2009-07-18T00:22:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	I can't find any references
2009-07-18T00:23:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	is it usb or something?
2009-07-18T00:23:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	It's a sata cd drive I believe, let me check

2009-07-18T00:26:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	does sudo lshw -C disk show it?
2009-07-18T00:27:00.000Z	zortec	bucky	That is showing my sata 320GB hd
2009-07-18T00:28:00.000Z	bucky	zortec	it sounds like this problem here http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-850397.html
