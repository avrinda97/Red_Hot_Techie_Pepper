2010-03-06T23:40:00.000Z	Petskull		google is magic!
2010-03-06T23:41:00.000Z	Petskull		hey- I'm kinda desperate here.. anyone have a favorite grub emergency resource?
2010-03-06T23:42:00.000Z	Petskull		I've recently abandoned Geany for Code::Blocks
2010-03-06T23:42:00.000Z	Petskull		but there's little info on what to do when it fails
2010-03-06T23:43:00.000Z	Petskull		can't
2010-03-06T23:43:00.000Z	Petskull		have to deal through it
2010-03-06T23:43:00.000Z	Petskull		got no other boot options but the HD
2010-03-06T23:44:00.000Z	Petskull		trust me- not booting from usb and the optical drive is hosed
2010-03-06T23:44:00.000Z	Petskull		bios doesn't support booting from usb
2010-03-06T23:45:00.000Z	Petskull		?
2010-03-06T23:46:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	PXE boot, google it
2010-03-06T23:46:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	yep
2010-03-06T23:47:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	because it will
2010-03-06T23:52:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	yea, you're better off booting from a Live CD image (.iso) with grub
2010-03-06T23:53:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	why can't you boot into it? Is the partition corrupted?
2010-03-06T23:53:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	I wouldn't trust the windows drivers for ext3...
2010-03-06T23:55:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	yea...see Grub installs itself to the MBR. From there it goes and hunts fown files that it needs to boot. With no viable CD drive and a messed up grub the only suggestion is to attach HDD to a friend's PC so you can fix things
2010-03-06T23:57:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	give it a shot. Specify root (hdx,y)
2010-03-06T23:57:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	but it sounds like you need to reinstall grub
2010-03-06T23:57:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	gonna need a space there
2010-03-06T23:58:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	well then I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you're going to have to reinstall grub.
2010-03-06T23:59:00.000Z	chowder	Petskull	np
