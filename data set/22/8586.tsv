2005-10-29T06:49:00.000Z	Thunderguy		I have a really bad problem with ubuntu that no matter what I do, I just can't troubleshoot it, I cold booted the system after a crash, ran e2fsck ( on unmounted partition ) then gnome didn't load I reinstalled gnome completely and erased all the configs before installing it, and it still didn't load, so I installed kubuntu-desktop, and KDE doesn't even load.
2005-10-29T06:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	can u try with a direct startx ?
2005-10-29T06:52:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	startx just loads a vanilla X display without any desktop, just the black-white background with X shapes cursor.
2005-10-29T06:53:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	can u install fluxbox and try again?
2005-10-29T06:55:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	same with fluxbox installed I still get a vanilla X.
2005-10-29T06:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	then check your /var/log/Xorg.log
2005-10-29T06:59:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	Is it a good sign to have about 40-50 messages with video card in the Xorg.0.log?
2005-10-29T06:59:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	look for lines with E or at the end
2005-10-29T07:01:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	look for the file ~/xsession-errors
2005-10-29T07:04:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	approximitly 60 pages full of .xsession-errors
2005-10-29T07:06:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	about 1/2 a page, summarized though: Failed to open transport listener for ISC.
2005-10-29T07:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	weird
2005-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	I figured out what caused it now, but it is still weird, I had a network outage during boot one time it lagged on "configuring network" so I C-c and it skipped that for that one time.
2005-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	That has to be what messed up the configuration, but that shouldn't have happened, seems more like a bug.
2005-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	that shudnt be an issue, really...i do it all the time :)
2005-10-29T07:12:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	try this, 'rm -rf ~/.ICEauthority' and try again. That's what i usually do
2005-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	yeah, that didn't work with me.
2005-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	sorry man, that is the most extreme i usua have to go
2005-10-29T07:27:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	I don't know how or why it happened, but it just started working.
2005-10-29T07:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	well, ubuntu works in mysterious ways
2005-10-29T07:28:00.000Z	Thunderguy	robotgeek	but what is more wierd is I had 0 opengl support, opengl crashed my system, in KDE I have full video acceleration and full opengl support, I'm very perplexed.
2005-10-29T07:28:00.000Z	robotgeek	Thunderguy	very nice :)_
