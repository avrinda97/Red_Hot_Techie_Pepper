2010-03-13T00:00:00.000Z	Vhozard	scott_ino2	I have ati drivers, only when I use smplayer --> preset opengl (ATI CARDS FAST) I get NO tearing
2010-03-13T00:01:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	but i don't want opengl playback, as Xvideo is a lot more friendly on CPU
2010-03-13T00:01:00.000Z	Vhozard	scott_ino2	Opengl or tearing, your choice
2010-03-13T00:01:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	that's what im getting at ;)
2010-03-13T00:02:00.000Z	Vhozard	scott_ino2	What cpu do you have?
2010-03-13T00:02:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	3.4 GHZ quadcore so yes i can afford the overheat, but would rather not have to
2010-03-13T00:03:00.000Z	Vhozard	scott_ino2	xD, 3.4 ghz quadcore, just use opengl and get over it
2010-03-13T00:03:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	;)
2010-03-13T00:03:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	but i shouldn't have to is what im getting at.. that's all
2010-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	Vhozard	scott_ino2	Using the opensource drivers and 2.6.33 gives decent 3D
2010-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	they made it work?
2010-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	if they did then im excited as i hated the fglrx driver
2010-03-13T00:08:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	what chipset do you have
2010-03-13T00:09:00.000Z	Vhozard	scott_ino2	Not using ubuntu, but with arch linux and xf86-video-git + libdrm-git + mesa-git + 2.6.33 I got decent performance (nexuiz 25 fps on ultra settings)
2010-03-13T00:09:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	ahh i see... excellent glad they stabilized that driver
2010-03-13T00:09:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	im gonna have to try it out
2010-03-13T00:09:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	this is the radeon driver correct that you speak of?
2010-03-13T00:10:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	sweet... good to know
2010-03-13T00:11:00.000Z	Vhozard	scott_ino2	And KMS works for me too, finally...
2010-03-13T00:11:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	im using a radeon HD 3400 which i believe is a R6xx chip, so that's why i was always in a pickle before now i suppose
2010-03-13T00:11:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	wow nice... that's sweet
2010-03-13T00:11:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Vhozard	true, but still wasn't very stable at least when i tried it about 4 months ago
