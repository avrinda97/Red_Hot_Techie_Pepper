2010-01-13T08:01:00.000Z	Rodensky		Hello. To who do I go to with something I think should be incorporated in the next version of Ubuntu, such as mass rename of files? :-)
2010-01-13T08:03:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	"man rename"
2010-01-13T08:05:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	i meant something more simple and understandable... you know... like the mass rename you do with a single click of the mouse in windows....
2010-01-13T08:07:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	I'm sure there are handful of GUI Mass Renamer apps in the repo. It is just a matter of finding them and testing them to find one you like.
2010-01-13T08:10:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	i think that's something basic that should be incorporated in the system like it is in windows, it sounds stupid that you need a man or software downloaded for that....
2010-01-13T08:12:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	You can install it -- Not everybody have the needs for mass file renamers.  My grandpa does not.
2010-01-13T08:12:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	it has nothing to do with what i'm saying... you should be anti-any-idea-just-because-it-exist-in-windows
2010-01-13T08:13:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	please... you know as well as i do that it is a basic thing... :-)

2010-01-13T08:14:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	that's what i use for more then a year
2010-01-13T08:15:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	It all depends on the users. When you're working on a project, you would want to think globally, not local. In that case, it is best to keep simple and less hassles than installing stuffs "just because they ought to be there".
2010-01-13T08:15:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	Meh? Why did you ask for Mass Renamer then? :-)
2010-01-13T08:16:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	I'm asking for it to be interated in the system simply like in windows, without the need to install a program for it, specially when every time i need to open the program in a separate process in order to do so
2010-01-13T08:18:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	i'm asking for something to be simplified, and i don't believe ubuntu was built and developed with every developer in canonical saying "my grandfather doesn't need that, and anyway there is a command for it"
2010-01-13T08:19:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	You could "integrate" it by using nautilus-actions and place the "mass rename" script.
2010-01-13T08:20:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	i'm a simple user - what you said right now is chinese for me
2010-01-13T08:20:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	Okay, I'm saying that the feature you're hoping for is solely is up to nautilus -- the file manager.
2010-01-13T08:21:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	i don't care how they do it... as long as they do it :)

2010-01-13T08:22:00.000Z	Rodensky	kinja-sheep	i really don't want to mess with things i don't know...
2010-01-13T08:23:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	Use Pyrenamer. It get the job done (for most situations) and we don't spend all times renaming things. We watch/read things. :)
2010-01-13T08:30:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Rodensky	I'm trying nautilus-script-collection-svn -- See if it got that "mass renamer" script in.
