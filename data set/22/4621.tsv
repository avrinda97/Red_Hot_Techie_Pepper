2008-02-08T06:14:00.000Z	raichlea		pelo, now I get this:
2008-02-08T06:14:00.000Z	raichlea		raichlea@gilgamesh:~/java$ java practice.java
2008-02-08T06:14:00.000Z	raichlea		The program 'java' can be found in the following packages:
2008-02-08T06:14:00.000Z	raichlea		 * cacao
2008-02-08T06:14:00.000Z	raichlea		 * j2re1.4
2008-02-08T06:14:00.000Z	raichlea		 * kaffe
2008-02-08T06:14:00.000Z	raichlea		 * jamvm
2008-02-08T06:15:00.000Z	raichlea		can anyone suggest one?  It seem to be a problem with the java install on ubuntu... not so much java per se..
2008-02-08T06:15:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	 you installed   sun-java6-jre  and   sun-java6-plugin (on x32?)
2008-02-08T06:16:00.000Z	raichlea	nickrud	yes and sun-java6-jdk
2008-02-08T06:16:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	then ran sudo update-alternatives --config java  ?
2008-02-08T06:17:00.000Z	raichlea	nickrud	raichlea@gilgamesh:~/java$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
2008-02-08T06:19:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	I can see that you don't have the sun jre selected, but you might have the jdk selected ....
2008-02-08T06:20:00.000Z	raichlea	nickrud	I will try to reinstall the jre
2008-02-08T06:21:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	java -version should tell you what you're running ...
2008-02-08T06:30:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	##java apparently requires same
2008-02-08T06:39:00.000Z	raichlea	nickrud	 I found the java file, it was in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.03/bin/java  is there a way to alias that so I don't have to type that every time?
2008-02-08T06:41:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	if you have the   update-alternatives set properly, you end up with /usr/bin/java  pointing at  /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java
2008-02-08T06:42:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	which is a link to the one you speak of
2008-02-08T06:42:00.000Z	raichlea	nickrud	how do set the update-alternatives?
2008-02-08T06:43:00.000Z	nickrud	raichlea	sudo update-alternatives --config java , and press the number on the same line as the sun-java6
2008-02-08T06:45:00.000Z	raichlea	nickrud	seems to have worked, thanks
