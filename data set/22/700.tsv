2011-09-12T17:51:00.000Z	AFD		Any reason the root user on ubuntu would be able to open PDFs and not other users?
2011-09-12T17:52:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	sure, if the read permission bits on the file are set poorly.
2011-09-12T17:52:00.000Z	AFD		the permissions on the PDF file are definitely ok for the user
2011-09-12T17:52:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	and the containing directory?
2011-09-12T17:52:00.000Z	AFD		yep
2011-09-12T17:53:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	don't suppose we can get you to paste some details?
2011-09-12T17:53:00.000Z	AFD		they can read and write all files in their home folders (the same goes for all 30 users we have on this server) - it's just the root user that can open PDFs. All other file types seem ok
2011-09-12T17:54:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	how are they attempting to open the pdfs?
2011-09-12T17:54:00.000Z	AFD		just a double click
2011-09-12T17:54:00.000Z	AFD	sipior	thanks for helping btw
2011-09-12T17:54:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	can we get an example permissions list?
2011-09-12T17:55:00.000Z	AFD	sipior	I think you might be on to something actually
2011-09-12T17:55:00.000Z	AFD		just double checking permissions now
2011-09-12T18:00:00.000Z	AFD	sipior	the permissions did seem wrong but that is corrected and the problem remains
2011-09-12T18:00:00.000Z	AFD		anything else to help troubleshoot?
2011-09-12T18:00:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	can we get an example permissions list?
2011-09-12T18:01:00.000Z	AFD		If I ls -l or right click I can see the permissions are now correct
2011-09-12T18:01:00.000Z	AFD		the user and group is both cman1
2011-09-12T18:03:00.000Z	AFD	sipior	the permissions are now correct... can you help me troubleshoot a little further please
2011-09-12T18:04:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	you expect me to spend my time helping, and then ignore any question i put to you. you've wasted enough of my time, i think.
2011-09-12T18:05:00.000Z	AFD	sipior	I said please and pointed out that the permissions were now correct... How would you like your favoured evidence of a "permissions list"
2011-09-12T18:05:00.000Z	sipior	AFD	i wouldn't. i have other things that need doing.
