2006-06-13T11:38:00.000Z	Dirge		Am I supposed to go into terminal and use su in order to save a file I was editing in a GUI?
2006-06-13T11:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	no, your gui should save somewhere
2006-06-13T11:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	if it's a file you need to write as root, save it to the Desktop and then copy or move it to the proper place with sudo
2006-06-13T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	no, that is the definition of permissions
2006-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	linux does not write to ntfs for one simple reason: microsoft has not published the specs needed for reliable writing to ntfs
2006-06-13T11:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	and the problem with that is?
2006-06-13T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	its supposed to be that freaking way. You (a simple user) are not root (the master of the universe, in the case, your os)
2006-06-13T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	no.
2006-06-13T11:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	once you wrap your head around who get's permissions to write where, you will very glad that you have to use sudo to write to /etc/X11
2006-06-13T12:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	I see your point about that; try cd /etc/X11 , it will give you easy access or xorg.conf, you won't have to prepend /etc/X11 to xorg.conf every time.
2006-06-13T12:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	just do: sudo apt-get install sun-java5-bin sun-java5-plugin . This is not windows. do not expect it to be.
2006-06-13T12:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	then read !components & !universe following:
2006-06-13T12:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	don't. Learn linux, don't expect it to be windows.
2006-06-13T12:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	fix your sources
2006-06-13T12:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	apt-cache policy sun-java5-bin
2006-06-13T12:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	fix your sources. Basically, replace everything in /etc/apt/sources.list with the contents of http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666
2006-06-13T12:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666
2006-06-13T13:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	there's a bot who hold info here, ! tells him it's a question he should answer
2006-06-13T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	sure it does, to the right
2006-06-13T13:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	make sure you're using xchat, not xchat-gnome
2006-06-13T13:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	it's in universe, sudo apt-get install xchat
2006-06-13T13:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Dirge	it's a target for hackers. They probably won't try to force the password of a random user on a machine that has admin privs
