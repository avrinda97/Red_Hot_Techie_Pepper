2008-11-03T17:52:00.000Z	AzizLight		hi everybody
2008-11-03T17:53:00.000Z	AzizLight		I have a samsung screen from an old desktop pc (last year) and it just doesnt work with ubuntu. I tried it on a mac and on a pc with windows and it works fine but with ubuntu it justrefuses to work! is that normal?
2008-11-03T17:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 using  DVI or VGA conector? You using a KVM switch or anything else weird?
2008-11-03T17:54:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	I tried both dvi and vga and it doesnt work
2008-11-03T17:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 thats very weird.. ive  always had 100% success with my various dvi monitors.
2008-11-03T17:55:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	the screen isnt even detected so I cant even see what's happening
2008-11-03T17:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 Hmm..  you dont have 2 monitors attatched do you? or a monitor + tv out?
2008-11-03T17:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 what video card anyway?
2008-11-03T17:56:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	and no I only have one screen
2008-11-03T17:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 im out of ideas then..  Unless you need to move  the thing to the other video output on the cards.. but i imagine you tried that..
2008-11-03T17:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 if the thing has a tv out.. id be curious if that worked..
2008-11-03T17:59:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	I lost hope a long time ago. Im here to get a suggestion, I want to buy a new screen and I will use it with vga output. Can you suggest something with a good quality/price ratio that will work for sure with a gefore 7600 please?
2008-11-03T18:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 i would suggest using DVI and  not using vga at all. dvi give smuch better output. Ive had no issues with my Samsung 226BW
2008-11-03T18:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 any new monitor - i would be sure to get DVI and HDMI input for it also.. to keep up with what will be on most new video cards
2008-11-03T18:02:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	in my experience vga gets detected automatically and dvi doesnt, besides, I dont play games, I dont watch dvd on ubuntu and ... I dont play games so the quality is not THAT important to me
2008-11-03T18:02:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	but I dont have a lot of experiece so I could be totally wrong
2008-11-03T18:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 my experience is the exact opposite.. Ive had machines with vga  get the res's totally wroong.. and dvi  does.. DVI will give better text/font/crisper output.. thats not just for 'games' :)
2008-11-03T18:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 ive takken the same monitor and hooked it to the same pc only my video card has 1 dvi and 1 vga out.. the dvi text was much more readable. and  most every linux disrto got the res right from the start.
2008-11-03T18:04:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	I will try again to connect the screen tonight and ill come back but I have absolutely no hope
2008-11-03T18:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 if it has a tv out - i would be curious if that worked on the thing..  I cant imagine why both  outputs would not work under  at least the console for ubuntu
2008-11-03T18:07:00.000Z	AzizLight	dr_willis	earlier this summer I tried with an old flat screen with only vga output and it worked like a charm... btw is there know compatibility issues with the Samsung SyncMaster 961BW because I think that's the one I have
2008-11-03T18:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	AzizLight	 none that i have ever seen/heard.. i wouls day hit google.. could be samsung has some bad monitors out.
