2007-12-18T10:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek		isnt it nessicary to compile kernel modules nickrud?
2007-12-18T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	I actually saw one that included the necessary stuff from the headers, it was *very* specialized :)
2007-12-18T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	nah, just include the necessary files from the particular kernel you are building against, and set --include correctly
2007-12-18T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	you're right it's samba
2007-12-18T11:49:00.000Z	MasterShrek	nickrud	but why doesnt he have a /etc/init.d/samba file then?
2007-12-18T11:50:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	because it isn't installed?
2007-12-18T11:50:00.000Z	MasterShrek	nickrud	he says it is...
2007-12-18T11:50:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	apt-cache policy samba tells all
2007-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	that's nothing without your heroic crap
2008-01-15T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	strange to say 'lucky' in the same sentence as broadcom, isn't it
2008-01-17T12:10:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	you are skilled (I'll leave the smart to you)
2008-01-26T12:00:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	I hear it's apps->system tools
2008-01-26T12:05:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	you could give xchat-gnome a shot, get your feet wet in gnome ;)
2008-01-26T12:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	nickrud	do they recommend using the command line at all? :)
2008-01-26T12:12:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	yeah, something about the 'uber-geek' package management people saying apt-get is getting updates and don't guarantee aptitude will keep up. Not sure of the details
2008-01-26T12:52:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	first time the kernel changes device id's out from under you, you will come in. Maybe kicking and screaming, but come in :
2008-01-26T12:53:00.000Z	MasterShrek	nickrud	why and when would the kernel do such a thing? ive compiled many many kernels and never had a problem with it
2008-01-26T12:54:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	I'm not really up on all the stuff, but that's why the uuid's are coming in. And it is kinda nice. I split a partition in two (before my linux partitions) and didn't have to edit fstab even though the /dev/hdX changed for everything (did have to make one change to grub, though)
2008-01-26T12:56:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	as soon as grub uses uuid's for (hdx,x) in it's stanza's it will really be good
2008-01-26T12:57:00.000Z	MasterShrek	nickrud	i suppose, it will make it much less confusing when configuring grub since it starts at 0 instead of 1
2008-01-26T12:58:00.000Z	nickrud	MasterShrek	the only real pain I've run into is dd copies over the uuid to the new partition. Confuses the heck out of linux
