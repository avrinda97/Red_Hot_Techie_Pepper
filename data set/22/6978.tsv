2007-11-05T17:28:00.000Z	sysop		Anyone know how to change the link destination on a set of links Ie: * -> /bla/* becomes... * -> /bla2/* can someone help???
2007-11-05T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	recreate the link
2007-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	I have like 100 links to do the same thing to... any better suggestions???
2007-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	you want to change 100 links?
2007-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	something like that
2007-11-05T17:30:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	its a bunch
2007-11-05T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	write a for loop to do it for you.  Or (kind of dumb) link bla to bla2.  Hard to suggest something better without more details
2007-11-05T17:34:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	ok, I want to create a /usr/lib/jvm/default to point to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun but I want to move the links in /etc/alternatives
2007-11-05T17:36:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	does 'update-java-alternatives' affect that?
2007-11-05T17:36:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	no
2007-11-05T17:37:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	the "default" is something I am creating... thats for new vm's
2007-11-05T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	you want to make a link '/usr/lib/jvm/default -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun'.  What do you want to do with the links in /etc/alternatives?
2007-11-05T17:39:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	I have the first part, the second /etc/alternatives currently  point to  /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun but I want them to point to /usr/lib/jvm/default
2007-11-05T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	why?  it seems like you are circumventing the alternatives system for some reason
2007-11-05T17:41:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	yep, I want to be able to easily switch java versions, as I am a Java developer, and will be working on the compiler
2007-11-05T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	ok, but why would you not use the alternatives system to do that then?
2007-11-05T17:42:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	so as the alternative switching does not support MY version of java...
2007-11-05T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	add it
2007-11-05T17:42:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	jrib how?
2007-11-05T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	'man update-alternatives' explains how to add alternatives.  I'm not on ubuntu atm, so cannot tell you how update-java-alternatives works, but it should be similarly documented
2007-11-05T17:44:00.000Z	sysop	jrib	thanks thats going to take some reading, but I can do that!
2007-11-05T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	sysop	yeah, I think that's the /nice/ way
