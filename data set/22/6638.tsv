2006-09-01T13:00:00.000Z	hockyhair		hwo do i change the hostname for good.. i did hostname "name" but after a restart my cpu started using the old hostname again
2006-09-01T13:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	someone may know the "right" answer, but i'll tell you what i did when that happened (on debian, i think)
2006-09-01T13:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	say the old hostname was foobar
2006-09-01T13:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	sudo grep -r "foobar" /etc/* | less .... see ay file that string shoiws up in, then edit it ... you may find /etc/mailname or something is the culprit
2006-09-01T13:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	also, i found that some things like my mailer had been told the old name, and it gave me the chance to change those
2006-09-01T13:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	see any file, rather
2006-09-01T13:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	no, you're looking to see any place that old string is, so you can change it:  sudo grep -r oldnamehere /etc/* | less
2006-09-01T13:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	/etc is where configs live, so that's why you look there, and the list of answers may be long, so that's why the pipe to "less" ... anything else there unclear?
2006-09-01T13:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	oh and "q" to get out of less, but somehow i got the impression you're not a newbie to linux?
2006-09-01T13:08:00.000Z	hockyhair	eyequeue	ty.
2006-09-01T13:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	cool
2006-09-01T13:16:00.000Z	hockyhair	eyequeue	you dont by any chance know how to get identd working do ya?
2006-09-01T13:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	have you installed any of the identd packages?
2006-09-01T13:17:00.000Z	hockyhair	eyequeue	oidentd
2006-09-01T13:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	something like sudo apt-get install oidentd, but pick the one you like if you have a preference
2006-09-01T13:17:00.000Z	hockyhair	eyequeue	i got oidentd already, but it has yet to work
2006-09-01T13:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	okay, my next guess would be that your firewall may be blocking port 113?
2006-09-01T13:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	there really is an answer, i know it, but you're talking to someone who always has to wait for it to timeout when i connect to freenode :(  sorry ... if you find out though, please tell me?
2006-09-01T13:20:00.000Z	hockyhair	eyequeue	you got it.
2006-09-01T13:26:00.000Z	hockyhair	eyequeue	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-227857.html
2006-09-01T13:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	sad that the package doesn't do that itself (someone file a bug yet?) but i'll have to try it now here :) i hope my upstream machine doesn't block 113 and does forward it to the lappie
2006-09-01T13:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	hockyhair	thanks for the howto :)
