2012-09-19T00:04:00.000Z	xibalba		1st step is to always install vm tools
2012-09-19T00:05:00.000Z	Pazzie	xibalba	this you mean? sudo apt-get install vmfs-tools
2012-09-19T00:05:00.000Z	xibalba		install the ones from your vm esxi box
2012-09-19T00:05:00.000Z	xibalba		mount the installed, copy from /cdrom  or /mnt/cdrom, run those tools not the vmfs-tools
2012-09-19T00:05:00.000Z	Pazzie		just mount it?
