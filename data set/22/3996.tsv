2008-04-16T04:52:00.000Z	MrStitch		If I want to install a new piece of hardware, do I need to contact the manufacturer for linux drivers, or does Ubuntu have some other type of system?
2008-04-16T04:53:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	the last place you'll get drivers from is the manufacturers, they usually ignore linux. The vast majority of hardware already have drivers in the kernel courtesy of volunteers
2008-04-16T04:54:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	probably not for this. Is there a way I can find out if something exists for my card?
2008-04-16T04:56:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	I'd do a google search for    ubuntu <exact hardware model>  , then fall back on linux <model>
2008-04-16T04:56:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	what exactly is it?
2008-04-16T04:57:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	it's an Echo Mia audio card, used for multi track recording
2008-04-16T04:57:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	and the exact model ?
2008-04-16T04:58:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	is that the one using an hda-intel chip?
2008-04-16T04:58:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	don't think so... Looking right now.
2008-04-16T04:59:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	if it's plugged in, lspci  will show all the cards
2008-04-16T05:00:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	it just says "Echo Mia 24.96 Digital Recording", and on the back it says it has a On-board 24-Bit Motorola DSP.
2008-04-16T05:01:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	is it plugged in?
2008-04-16T05:01:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	no... I took it out the last time I had to reload winBlows
2008-04-16T05:03:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	either way, if I want to use this card, I still need to hunt down actual linux-based drivers.... correct?
2008-04-16T05:04:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	yup. Didn't find anything in the first pass. You can ask on #alsa, they're the experts on sound
2008-04-16T05:04:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	that channel on this server?
2008-04-17T14:32:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	do you ever sleep man?
2008-04-17T14:33:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	insomnia tonight.
2008-04-17T14:33:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	same here.....
2008-04-17T14:33:00.000Z	nickrud	MrStitch	I swear, I was just asking if it's always thsi quiet :)
2008-04-17T14:35:00.000Z	MrStitch	nickrud	I remember waaaaay back in the day using IRC. I thought the traffic would've slowed down by now..... apparently not.
