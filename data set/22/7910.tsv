2006-12-17T15:10:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	if the windows shell dies you are dead in the water. in linux you have the command line as a last resort, without having to boot the install cd in recovery mode to access it ;)
2006-12-17T15:11:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	same with ctrl+alt+backspace
2006-12-17T15:11:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	You are not dead in the water if the shell dies. You have task manager. Always
2006-12-17T15:12:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	ctrl-alt-del on Windows takes me to a fail-safe GUI that allows me to kill rogue tasks in a user-friendly manner. ctrl-backspace does not
2006-12-17T15:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	which isnt realy helpfull in bringing the shell to live again, without killing stuff in a similar way to ctrl+alt+backspace
2006-12-17T15:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	ok, well thats a point...
2006-12-17T15:13:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	ctrl-alt-del allows you to bring up task manager. From there it tells you which apps are not responding and allows you to kill them.
2006-12-17T15:14:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	though i must say, if the problem is rouge tasks i dont think ive ever seen those hang the shell. i dont see how linux handles them any diffrently than windows.
2006-12-17T15:15:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	unix is very user friendly. its just picky about whom its friends are ;)
2006-12-17T15:16:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	That's true!
2006-12-17T15:16:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	have you filed a bugreport?
2006-12-17T15:17:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	I'm a bit fed up of filing bug reports on OSS and getting royally slapped down for suggesting things. So no.
2006-12-17T15:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	what was the feature you where missing then?
2006-12-17T15:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	also, if anyone gives you a harder time than you deserve just slap them right back with the ubuntu coc ;)
2006-12-17T15:20:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	A keystroke that will bring up system monitor even when gnome-panel is hung/dead. That way, it can be used for killing/restarting gnome-panel in a dire situation.
2006-12-17T15:22:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	i don think the task manager in gnome is dependant on the panel, so just bind the shortcut you want :) file a bugreport suggesting making ctrl+alt+del the deafult shortcut
2006-12-17T15:23:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	i cant realy say if itll work when gnome-panel is hung - since i dont use gnome but xfce - but there is realy nothing to loose in trying
2006-12-17T15:25:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	I'm impressed that Launchpad has a much easier bug page than bugzilla.
2006-12-17T15:25:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	yes its nice isnt it :) and it integrates projects very well too :)
2006-12-17T15:31:00.000Z	RichB	nolimitsoya	oskude: Thanks for your help. #76214 filed.
2006-12-17T15:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	RichB	thank you very much :) bugreporting is what keeps this project going :)
