2007-08-16T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	xjkx	sudo deluser HIM admin
2007-08-16T06:08:00.000Z	xjkx	jrib	ok, i want to add him on sudo to execute only ONE command, like cp /x /y can i do that?
2007-08-16T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	xjkx	edit /etc/sudoers.  I don't know the syntax offhand, but the manpage for sudoers talks about it (man sudoers)
2007-08-23T13:35:00.000Z	jrib	xjkx	the redirection is done by your shell which only has your user's rights.  Instead, do echo 1 | sudo tee /blah/blah
2007-08-23T13:38:00.000Z	xjkx	jrib	 echo 1 | sudo  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward (says command not found, of course :>)
2007-08-23T13:39:00.000Z	jrib	xjkx	you forgot the "tee"
