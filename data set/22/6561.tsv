2007-12-29T07:50:00.000Z	facted		root@username-desktop
2007-12-29T07:50:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	your still root
2007-12-29T07:52:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	what is the name of the account you want to be logged in as?
2007-12-29T07:52:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	don
2007-12-29T07:52:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	don
2007-12-29T07:53:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	don't change any of root's permissions
2007-12-29T07:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	that isn't your account
2007-12-29T07:55:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	try this: log out, when you see the box, type your username/password (where the username isn't root) , come back here
2007-12-29T07:55:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	ok :)
2007-12-29T07:56:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	I'm just confused how when you don't login as root, your logged in w/ uid 0
2007-12-29T08:02:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	if you find the bash history file, it will tell you what you did, and you could put it in the pastebin...
2007-12-29T08:07:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	do you see your username after you run this command:  cat /etc/passwd | cut -d":" -f1
2007-12-29T08:10:00.000Z	compwiz18	facted	press alt+f2, then type gnome-terminal
