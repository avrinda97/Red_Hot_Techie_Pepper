2009-05-06T06:50:00.000Z	Name141		Would it be possible for me to revert back to the e1000e (100?) version driver for my NIC that was in Hardy?
2009-05-06T06:50:00.000Z	Name141		I can't get my NIC to work in anything higher than Hardy
2009-05-06T06:50:00.000Z	goose	Name141	it's possible, you have to do it in repositories

2009-05-06T06:58:00.000Z	Name141	goose	ok, it shows that e1000, and e1000e is "supposed" to make it work in 8.04 (and it does)
