2006-08-08T15:48:00.000Z	Pulshion		using mencoder what options would i use to conver test.mov to test.avi please could someone help me. Everytime i do it i get an empty avi file.
2006-08-08T15:49:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	I would use "mencoder -ovc xvid -oac mp3lame -xvidencopts bitrate=128 -lameopts br=64 -o output.avi test.mov" (maybe "-lameopts b=64")
2006-08-08T15:50:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	Obviously you change the bitrates
2006-08-08T15:50:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- thanx
2006-08-09T06:53:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	That gives an AVI using the Xvid codec, and MP3 for sound. Make sure you have those codecs available in your media player
2006-08-09T06:54:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- it cannot open the file, i have those codecs
2006-08-09T06:54:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- i think it gets corrupted or something
2006-08-09T06:55:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	Try playing it with mplayer, since mplayer should be able to handle anything mencoder can output
2006-08-09T06:55:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- i always use it and it says seek failed
2006-08-09T06:58:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- it says "Seek Failed"
2006-08-09T06:59:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	I don't know what would cause that then, sorry :( (maybe try a different codec, but I only use xvid in mencoder. "man mencoder" is HUGE by the way)
2006-08-09T07:00:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- do i need to install any other apps?
2006-08-09T07:01:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	I wouldn't know. I try to use ffmpeg2theora to encode my movies (that obviously encodes them to theora, not avi though)
2006-08-09T07:01:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	You may try vlc
2006-08-09T07:01:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	VLC can "play" into a file, so you could tell it to play into an AVI file
2006-08-09T07:02:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- is there a program that is user friendly something like Movie maker in windo$e? I was trying to slowmotion like 20 frames in wmv
2006-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	VLC would probably do that. It has loads of options, all in a graphical interface. There is an option to save to a file, and there is probably an option to change the play speed (heck, it can even make the movie wave up and down!)
2006-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- ok thanx, ill play around with that...
2006-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	Rhythmbox is collection-based. You could try drag 'n' drop (I don't use Rythmbox much so I am no sure)
2006-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- whats the best music player?
2006-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	Warbo	Pulshion	Personally I use Listen, Amarok and XMMS
2006-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	Pulshion	Warbo	-- k thanx, drag and drop worked, i just had my blonde moments haha
