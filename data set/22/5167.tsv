2007-07-24T12:38:00.000Z	sparrw		Can anyone recommend WYSIWYG page layout software that can visibly arrange text across multiple pages that will be trimmed?  For making banners and such.  I know a lot of graphics programs can "just do" that sort of printing, but I want to see where the page breaks will be while editing.  InDesign can almost do it.  Scribus apparently can't.
2007-07-24T12:40:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	if you're adventurous, you could try LaTeX
2007-07-24T12:40:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	oh wait, not wisywig
2007-07-24T12:41:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	latex would still rely on something that can print it properly.  and the wysiwyg problem
2007-07-24T12:41:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	well, I'm assuming you would have a printer, since you obviously need one for a banner
2007-07-24T12:42:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	i meant software
2007-07-24T12:42:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	i could live with latex + [something that can print preview it] , if that was the only option
2007-07-24T12:42:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	you can use pdflatex to generate pdfs, and you can preview pdfs with evince or Adobe reader
2007-07-24T12:44:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	ok, ill keep that in mind as a last resort
2007-07-24T12:44:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	I suppose you've already tried inkscape?
2007-07-24T12:45:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	i have.  its one of the programs that will "just do" it without showing me where  :(
2007-07-24T12:47:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	can't you just define the pages as being, say, 1 inch smaller than the real pages, and then get the printer to print them centered on the page?
2007-07-24T12:48:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	im not sure how to define fake page sizes in any of the programs
2007-07-24T12:48:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	except inkscape, but its lacking elsewhere
2007-07-24T12:48:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	take scribus for example: new>>page size>>custom
2007-07-24T12:49:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	ill give that a try, thanks.
2007-07-24T12:50:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	in scribus, how do i define a multi-page document with pages in a grid instead of sequential?
2007-07-24T12:52:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	you mean it has to be a 2 dimensional array of pages??
2007-07-24T12:54:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	im going to, for instance, wallpaper my room with letter sized sheets of paper, and i want to print them all from a single huge document.
2007-07-24T12:55:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	wow, that's a unique project
2007-07-24T12:55:00.000Z	sparrw	pete83	i hear that a lot :-p
2007-07-24T13:01:00.000Z	pete83	sparrw	ok, I think you should just buy a bigger printer
