2008-05-17T18:49:00.000Z	yamanickill		i like to keep one that works out the box just incase i get any problems...i use an LM technologies USB one and it works perfectly...just seems to be laptop ones i've had problems with
2008-05-17T18:49:00.000Z	yamanickill		but...having said that..i've never not got one to work...eventually they all work with me
2008-05-17T18:51:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	yes, but with how much hassle (or ndiswrapper)
2008-05-17T18:51:00.000Z	yamanickill	wols	only one took longer than 10 mins
2008-05-17T18:58:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	pretty much all videocards have 2 connectors nowadays
2008-05-17T19:00:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	then it's useless and your 8400gs will be way better, even when it's a crappy card itsel
2008-05-17T19:00:00.000Z	yamanickill	wols	so you think i should get one card that has 2 outputs rather than 2 cards?
2008-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	yes. and a decent one. what mobo/cpu?
2008-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	and what usage for the PC?
2008-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	the 8400gs will be as fast or faster than your built in card
2008-05-17T19:02:00.000Z	yamanickill	wols	the pc is just a general home computer
2008-05-17T19:02:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	play _any_ games?
2008-05-17T19:03:00.000Z	yamanickill	wols	only xmoto really
2008-05-17T19:05:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	yes I understand, but: what mobo is it?
2008-05-17T19:05:00.000Z	yamanickill	wols	i was basically asking...is the nvidia 8400GS any good lol
2008-05-17T19:05:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	not really but your needs are very simple
2008-05-17T19:05:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	however builtin graphics will cost you performance of your CPU/memory bus
2008-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	yamanickill	wols	Intel 946GZ + ICH7
2008-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	ick. what cpu?
2008-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	yamanickill	wols	Intel Dual Core E2180
2008-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	I have a e2160. very nice CPU but on a p35 board
2008-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	wols	yamanickill	I'd advise you to get one as well
