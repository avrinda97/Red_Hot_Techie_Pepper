2004-12-07T14:51:00.000Z	calamari-		just curious.. what does Applications > Accessories > Text Editor point to?  Is it nano?
2004-12-07T14:52:00.000Z	calamari-		how about Applications > Multimedia > Music Player (hopefully xmms?)

2004-12-07T14:56:00.000Z	ogra	calamari-	for mp3 playback see also this: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2004-12-07T14:57:00.000Z	calamari-	ogra	I think I'll get xmms.. I like its interface since I'm so used to WinAmp
2004-12-07T14:57:00.000Z	ogra	calamari-	then better take beep-media-player its the successor
2004-12-07T16:48:00.000Z	ogra	calamari-	wine is there, not by default though
2004-12-07T16:49:00.000Z	calamari-	ogra	ahh, didn't see it in the cd package list.
2004-12-07T16:49:00.000Z	ogra	calamari-	oh, i'm not sure if its on the cd
2004-12-07T16:51:00.000Z	calamari-	ogra	Doesn't seem like it.  I know it'd be in Debian's archive.  I'm still curious, can I download a DEB file and have it be installed by synaptic so that it knows about it, can be upgraded, uninstalled, etc?
2004-12-07T16:52:00.000Z	ogra	calamari-	nope... the dependencys could break....99% of debian packages are in universe/multiverse
2004-12-07T16:52:00.000Z	calamari-	ogra	I don't quite understand.  If I install universe/multiverse packages I could break the system dependencies?
2004-12-07T16:53:00.000Z	ogra	calamari-	nope, but if you install debian packages :)
2004-12-07T16:54:00.000Z	calamari-	ogra	oic.. is there any option for someone like me with a slow connection to download the universe/multiverse packages I need elsewhere and then install them later on my machine?
2004-12-07T16:54:00.000Z	ogra	calamari-	there was a thread on the mailing list....
