2005-11-20T13:39:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	applications > accessoris > terminal
2005-11-20T13:44:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	not in here please
2005-11-20T13:55:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	nikosUbuntu  needs to go in your hosts file on the same line as 127.0.0.1 and localhost
2005-11-20T13:56:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	write down the instructions right now. then restart your machine in 'rescue' mode and edit that file
2005-11-20T13:57:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	after you are done editing, immediately restart the box into regular mode
2005-11-20T14:01:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	and add your hostename to the line with 127.0.0.1 and 'localhost' in them
2005-11-20T14:01:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	it'll be near the top
2005-11-20T14:02:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	if you are in the rescue mode, dont use sudo, just nano /etc/hosts
2005-11-20T14:03:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	anywhere on the line will do
2005-11-20T14:23:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	i have no idea what you are trying to do
2005-11-20T14:46:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	please watch your language
2005-11-20T14:50:00.000Z	nalioth	gnocchi	the pretty pictures tell lies
