2012-05-28T12:18:00.000Z	weiyang		some configured bond interface on ubuntu?
2012-05-28T12:18:00.000Z	weiyang		can i bond one eth and one wlan?
2012-05-28T12:19:00.000Z	Cerrdor	weiyang	yes but the wifi will have to be in monitor mode
2012-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	I looked at the document in kernel source,
2012-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	and find one example on ubuntu distro, could it work?
2012-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	Cerrdor		ok?
2012-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	Cerrdor	weiyang	its possible
2012-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	not tried yet...
2012-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	Cerrdor		but what would be the reason
2012-05-28T12:23:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	i tried "lsmod | grep bond", while shows nothing
2012-05-28T12:23:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	this means i need to install the module first?
2012-05-28T12:24:00.000Z	Cerrdor	weiyang	what are you trying to do? Why do you need both eth0 and wi0?
2012-05-28T12:25:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	ok, I installed the bonding module
2012-05-28T12:25:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	I want to set up a bonding interface
2012-05-28T12:25:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	while I just have one eth interface and one wlan interface :(
2012-05-28T12:25:00.000Z	Cerrdor	weiyang	you want to bond your wifi withe your eth?
2012-05-28T12:26:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	 no, because the limitation of my hardware...
2012-05-28T12:26:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	I don't have two eth interface on my machine...
2012-05-28T12:26:00.000Z	Cerrdor	weiyang	It is not clear what or why you want to do it so I cannot really help
2012-05-28T12:26:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	 while I need to test this ....
2012-05-28T12:27:00.000Z	weiyang	Cerrdor	 test how to set up the bond interface ...
