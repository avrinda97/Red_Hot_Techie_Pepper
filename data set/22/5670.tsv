2007-04-23T05:01:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I know Banshee and Amarok have good iPod support.
2007-04-23T05:02:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Hmm.
2007-04-23T05:03:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I don't know what wvdial is, though you could probably pin it and make sure apt doesn't upgrade it in dist-upgrade.
2007-04-23T05:03:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I just don't remember how to pin packages.
2007-04-23T05:03:00.000Z	SeveredCross		:-X
2007-04-23T05:04:00.000Z	SeveredCross		BTW!
2007-04-23T05:04:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Wait.
2007-04-23T05:04:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Before you go, be warned you will have the same X problem.
2007-04-23T05:04:00.000Z	SeveredCross		When you dist-upgrade to Feisty
2007-04-23T05:04:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Are you using an ATI card?
2007-04-23T05:04:00.000Z	WannabeNewbie	SeveredCross	I didn't have any issues upgrading that way.. Everything worked fine
2007-04-23T05:05:00.000Z	SeveredCross	WannabeNewbie	I couldn't get X to start without installing fglrx.
2007-04-23T05:05:00.000Z	WannabeNewbie	SeveredCross	Hmm! I didn't have to do anything like that
2007-04-23T05:05:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Well, better safe than sorry: install fglrx first.
2007-04-23T05:05:00.000Z	SeveredCross	WannabeNewbie	Did you already have fglrx installed?
2007-04-23T05:06:00.000Z	WannabeNewbie	SeveredCross	I agree with you on better safe than sorry. Yes I already had it
2007-04-23T05:06:00.000Z	SeveredCross		That's why you didn't have the issue.
2007-04-23T05:06:00.000Z	SeveredCross		I didn't have fglrx installed, and the version of X11 in 7.04 crashes.
2007-04-23T05:06:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Barfs out on ATI cards, says no valid screens found.
2007-04-23T05:06:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Unless fglrx is in use.
2007-04-23T05:06:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Then it's fine.
2007-04-23T05:06:00.000Z	WannabeNewbie	SeveredCross	Your right, sorry, didn't mean to overstep on you there.
