2009-08-11T18:52:00.000Z	jiohdi		whats the best ubuntu compatible movie editor?
2009-08-11T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	best is an opinion so isnt concrete
2009-08-11T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	best does not exist at any time excepting for an evaluation of a product to your own (and only your) requirements
2009-08-11T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	why not try a couple, see which you think is best
2009-09-04T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	has that sorted it?
2009-09-04T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	erm i think so yeah
2009-09-04T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	use tab to complete my nick ;)
2009-09-04T18:19:00.000Z	jiohdi	ActionParsnip1	sorry :)
2009-09-04T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	np bro
2009-09-04T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	wired or wireless?
2009-09-04T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	possibly if they can capture the service they cacapture the rights of the process, hence why running irc as root is as dumb as it gets
2009-09-04T18:21:00.000Z	jiohdi	ActionParsnip1	I do not run it as root as far as I know
2009-09-04T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	if you run: whoami    it wil tell you
2009-09-04T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	if you run: ifconfig eth0    you should have an ip address assigned by dhcp, if not then check connections. You can also run: sudo lshw -C network to see what chip it uses and diagnose using websearches
2009-09-04T18:22:00.000Z	jiohdi	ActionParsnip1	 I ran gnome-failsafe and the network connection works just fine
2009-09-04T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	then you will need to find out what you can and cant do using various pings to see what you can and cannot do
2009-09-04T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	you may need to use gconf to apply settings
2009-09-04T18:37:00.000Z	jiohdi	ActionParsnip1	I do not have any program nor command called gconfig
2009-09-04T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	i'm not sure dude, you could try setting static IPs in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-09-04T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	ive had this before but it was AGES ago (Gutsy) and I just reinstalled
2009-09-04T18:40:00.000Z	jiohdi	ActionParsnip1	I do believe that the problem lies in a corrupted start up script, I need to know how to fix that
2009-09-04T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jiohdi	theres the startup items in the admin menu, or you can check wats going on with bum
