2011-12-12T03:45:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	try refreshing your package list
2011-12-12T03:45:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	and make sure its not locked
2011-12-12T03:46:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	apt-get update
2011-12-12T03:46:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	to refresh.
2011-12-12T03:46:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	you using sudo?
2011-12-12T03:48:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	um, you don't have another package manager open right?
2011-12-12T03:52:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	what package are you trying to install again?
2011-12-12T03:54:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	did you add the restricted packages to your list?
2011-12-12T03:54:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	its not in the default list
2011-12-12T03:56:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	ok, go to your package manager and check the rest of the repos. Its in one of those.
2011-12-12T03:57:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	I haven't used gnome in forever, so I don't know what package maanger it uses anymore
2011-12-12T03:58:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	you are trying to get flash correct? I believe its included in chrome automatically.
2011-12-12T03:59:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	yeah, its there. Adobe Flash plugin
2011-12-12T04:00:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	if you enable those other package locations and search for flash, you will see it.
2011-12-12T04:01:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	unfortunately, I gotta go. Hopefully you figure it out! If not, I am sure someone else can help
2011-12-12T04:01:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	umm, yeah, its under "settings" in whatever your package manager is
2011-12-12T04:02:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	should be a bunch of check boxes under sources or something like that.
2011-12-12T04:02:00.000Z	Alonea	ali	look around
