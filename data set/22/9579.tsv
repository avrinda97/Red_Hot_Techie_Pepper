2004-10-09T08:57:00.000Z	ema		anybody knows why php works only with scripts owned by root?
2004-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	HcE	ema	try setting mode 644 on the script?
2004-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	ema	HcE	nope, it doesn't work
2004-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	HcE		what user does your webserver run as?
2004-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	ema		www-data
2004-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	HcE		hmm
2004-10-09T09:00:00.000Z	ema	HcE	morevoer, it seems that the installation of php4 don't change anything in /etc/apache/modules.conf
2004-10-09T09:00:00.000Z	HcE	ema	you run apache1 or 2 ?
2004-10-09T09:00:00.000Z	ema	HcE	I had to manually run apache-modconf
2004-10-09T09:00:00.000Z	ema	HcE	1
2004-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	HcE	ema	weird, I would gess it has something to do with eiter a directory rule or some mode problem
2004-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	ema	HcE	running php4 scriptname.php works fine, though
2004-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	HcE		seems like a bug in your apache config?
2004-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	ema	HcE	it is the default one
2004-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	HcE		h
2004-10-09T09:04:00.000Z	HcE		don't have any experience with apache1 in ubuntu, I'm just a "new" user like everybody else
2004-10-09T09:04:00.000Z	HcE		I would look into the default settings and check for some strict rules
2004-10-09T09:08:00.000Z	ema	HcE	the server name was localhost rather than the machine name, pointing the browser to http://localhost/ works fine even with scripts owned by a normal user
2004-10-09T09:09:00.000Z	HcE	ema	ok, changing the servername will make it work for the ServerName?
2004-10-09T09:10:00.000Z	ema	HcE	yep. it does not explain why scripts owned by root worked fine...
2004-10-09T09:11:00.000Z	ema	HcE	but it works :)
2004-10-09T09:11:00.000Z	ema	HcE	thanks
