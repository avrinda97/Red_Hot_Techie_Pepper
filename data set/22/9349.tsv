2012-11-27T22:11:00.000Z	Hondusa		any idea on how to recover a root password? or can someone explain the difference between a root password and a log in password? i set up ubuntu yesterday with a password, chose the option to encrypt the data, loaded the laptop with family videos and now i cant log into ubuntu!
2012-11-27T22:11:00.000Z	Hondusa		i didnt know i set a root password
2012-11-27T22:12:00.000Z	Hondusa		the password i use when i log on to ubuntu - is that a root password?
2012-11-27T22:13:00.000Z	Hondusa		when i start up ubuntu - before i log on - im prompted for a password - my password wont work
2012-11-27T22:14:00.000Z	Hondusa		i remember the password - but it doesnt work - even when i load the live cd - i cant access the hd because its encrypted and my password wont work
2012-11-27T22:14:00.000Z	Hondusa		and im new to linux so im a bit confused
2012-11-27T22:14:00.000Z	Hondusa		ok
2012-11-27T22:14:00.000Z	Hondusa		correct
2012-11-27T22:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 and your passphrase for that is known?
2012-11-27T22:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 by default ubuntu has no root password. the first user has admin/sudo rights.
2012-11-27T22:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 you can reset that users password using differnt methods
2012-11-27T22:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 then what users password are you refering to?
2012-11-27T22:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 No... root is a specific user..
2012-11-27T22:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 if you login as 'billgates' thatn thats billgates password.
2012-11-27T22:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 why do you need to reset the password? did you forget it?
2012-11-27T22:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 your encrypted home pass phrase is NOT the same as a login password...
2012-11-27T22:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 Not that i am aware of. I never use encrypted homes.. causes to many issues
2012-11-27T22:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 there may be ways to moiunt it via the cli to give you more info./feedback/error messages.. I dont use the feature. so i dont know how its done.
2012-11-27T22:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 i would try booting into the text/single user mode and seeing if you can access anything in your /home/ partition
2012-11-27T22:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 sounds like you encrypted the whole drive?
2012-11-27T22:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	  you could try the single user mode i guess.. or a live cd. http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-mounting-your-encrypted-home-from-livecd/
2012-11-27T22:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hondusa	 is this a laptop or a desktop?
