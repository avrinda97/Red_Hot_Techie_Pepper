2005-08-06T14:40:00.000Z	Diddi		lo lo folks =)
2005-08-06T14:41:00.000Z	Diddi		anyone here to talk to about the shipping-version of ubuntu?
2005-08-06T14:41:00.000Z	Diddi		oks
2005-08-06T14:41:00.000Z	Diddi		I'm running the live-cd right now, and I like it =) though I have a few ideas about it.
2005-08-06T14:42:00.000Z	Diddi		My idea was to order a couple of hundred cds or something, to give away and try out for schools etc. and for that I think it can be changed a little bit, to make it easier for new ppl =)
2005-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	Diddi		the user likes to have "easy-access" to things, like their homedir, mail/www etc.
2005-08-06T14:45:00.000Z	topyli	Diddi	those are design decisions that are very elemental to ubuntu. you need another distro :)
2005-08-06T14:45:00.000Z	Diddi		 I see
2005-08-06T14:47:00.000Z	Diddi		my thought was to "catch" new users as fast as possible :) though it might be confusing for the old "windows-user" to take a big step as having an empty desktop etc. at once :P
2005-08-06T14:47:00.000Z	Diddi		just some spontanous ideas, dunno if it's better. but that's what I've heard :)
2005-08-06T14:48:00.000Z	Diddi		aha :P
2005-08-06T14:48:00.000Z	Diddi		yeah, though they have icons atleast for their homedirs =)
2005-08-06T14:48:00.000Z	Diddi		and www
2005-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	Diddi	there's an icon for the web in the panel
2005-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	Diddi	the desktop is something the user should populate, not anyone else
2005-08-06T14:49:00.000Z	Diddi	topyli	huh?
2005-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	topyli	Diddi	didn't your gnome panel come with a firefox icon?
2005-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	Diddi		yeah
2005-08-06T14:51:00.000Z	Diddi		no trashcan =P?
2005-08-06T14:52:00.000Z	Diddi		gah, I'll be right back :P the live-cd is killing my hardworking computer =P
2005-08-06T14:52:00.000Z	topyli	Diddi	customize away! your ubuntu desktop gives you the perfect chance
2005-08-06T14:53:00.000Z	topyli	Diddi	here's mine: http://siltala.net/comp/Hoary-desktop.jpg
