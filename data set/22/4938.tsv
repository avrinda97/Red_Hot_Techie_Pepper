2007-09-05T14:57:00.000Z	paradigm		there's an option in there for raise on mouse over
2007-09-05T14:59:00.000Z	paradigm		In Compiz Fusion, its under general options -> Focus & Raise Behaviour.  Not sure exactly where it is on Beryl, I haven't used it in quite some time.
2007-09-05T15:00:00.000Z	paradigm		Sure thing
2007-09-05T15:01:00.000Z	paradigm		brown-cat - the cd to install fresh, or to move from a current ubuntu install?
2007-09-05T15:02:00.000Z	brown_cat	paradigm	I have the ubuntu CD but it is not installing fast - it has been going for over 24 hours - I currently have ms windows 2000 pro and can wipe it
