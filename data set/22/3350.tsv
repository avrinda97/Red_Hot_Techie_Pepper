2008-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	jemark	Ax4	check also the volume in Volume control and in preferences to Alsa mixer
2008-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	Ax4	jemark	still nothing
2008-11-03T03:29:00.000Z	jemark	Ax4	have you installed the backports modules and the outstanding issues regarding intrepid in your soundcard?
2008-11-03T03:30:00.000Z	Ax4	jemark	nope, I'm a plug-and-play kinda guy, what should I install?
2008-11-03T03:30:00.000Z	jemark	Ax4	which sound card do you have?
2008-11-03T03:31:00.000Z	Ax4	jemark	00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02)
2008-11-03T03:31:00.000Z	Ax4	jemark	newegg has it listed as Realtek ALC888
2008-11-03T03:34:00.000Z	jemark	Ax4	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/217789
2008-11-03T03:36:00.000Z	Ax4	jemark	I had the audio working a few days ago, nothing has changed since then :-\
2008-11-03T03:37:00.000Z	jemark	Ax4	i though you just installed intrepid?
2008-11-03T03:38:00.000Z	Ax4	jemark	yea few days ago, then i was gone for the weekend, started the machine back up and it's broken
2008-11-03T03:39:00.000Z	jemark	Ax4	it's probably the latest kernel? im sorry, i can't help more. there will probably a fix for this. you can check the bug reports or report a bug yourself if you don't see any. i have to go now
