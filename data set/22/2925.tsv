2009-05-23T23:09:00.000Z	linux		my sda1 has ubuntu and today i installed opensuse to sda3,
2009-05-23T23:10:00.000Z	linux		which now lets my computer boots to sda3's grub, and that grub can't boot kubuntu well
2009-05-23T23:10:00.000Z	linux		i want to let sda1's grub take control back. now i have set active partition to sda1,
2009-05-23T23:10:00.000Z	linux		but when rebooting the computer says "hard disk has no system"
2009-05-23T23:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 with more then one linux on a machine.. you proberly need to pick ONE os to handle grub. then manually edit that os's menu.lst to  boot all the other os's on the box.
2009-05-23T23:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 when grub got reinstalled.. it points to the new 'menu.lst' on   the new os.. You could take the menu.lst from sda1 and  manually edit the   other os's menu.lst and include the proper info from the first one. :)
2009-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 i think thats just saying the ata controller drive is 'ready' 'drdy' is there an actual problem? or just you seeing that message?
2009-12-27T06:28:00.000Z	linux	Dr_Willis	During boot, I get the ata1.00 status {DRDY} followed by two other error-like lines and it just keeps looping - I've been going back and booting in rescue mode
2010-04-18T12:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 use the root user to set the proper ownership of the files via 'chown' command
2010-04-18T12:28:00.000Z	linux	Dr_Willis	who do I do that for the whole /home directory?
2010-04-18T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 each user has theor own /home/username  dir. it  and the files in it have to be owned by them to work properly
2010-04-18T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 try 'echo $USERNAME' and see if it prints your username...
2010-04-18T12:33:00.000Z	linux	Dr_Willis	I got nothing
2010-04-18T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 use the proper name foryour user then.
2010-05-30T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 dont forget that Case Is imporntant in Linux filename/paths.
2010-06-19T20:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 ubuntu by default has no firewall rules. so no ports are blocked.
2010-09-03T21:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 you can set up an apt-cacher service on one main box. and set the other machines to get packages from that box. saves download ussage
2010-09-20T22:04:00.000Z	linux	Dr_Willis	Error of "Network Management disabled". I am unable to connect to internet..
2010-10-20T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 clarify the problem.
2010-10-20T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 you could also try the command line.. 'sudo apt-get update' 'sudo apt-get upgrade'
2010-10-20T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	 eh? :)
2012-06-12T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linux	i doubt if you hae a serial printer
