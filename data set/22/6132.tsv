2009-08-30T23:39:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	I have 1 and it works great for me
2009-08-30T23:39:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	which chipset is yours?
2009-08-30T23:39:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	its the 690v chipset
2009-08-30T23:40:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	I am looking into one similar to this one, too... is this mobo good for ubuntu
2009-08-30T23:40:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	I've been using it for 6 months or so and no issues other then the onboard ati card not being supported but it does have a PCI-e slot
2009-08-30T23:41:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	I paired it with a 5200+ chip and 2 gig of ram and it works great
2009-08-30T23:41:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	Funny though, I am on a foxconn right now, it is 690V chipset SB600, and the ATI radeon card works out of the box
2009-08-30T23:42:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	it works fine unless you go to 9.04 or Debian Testing
2009-08-30T23:42:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	are you using the x1200 or a different on board ati?
2009-08-30T23:43:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	the X1200 chip
2009-08-30T23:43:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	you running 9.04?
2009-08-30T23:44:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	I am on 9.04 live CD
2009-08-30T23:44:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	ok, thought I had tried the live cd and 9.04 didn't like it
2009-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	it is working here... but like abhifx said... not all features work.... i am sincerely thinking on getting a nvidia on-board based mobo
2009-08-30T23:45:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	I'm getting over 1200 on glxgears with Debian lenny
2009-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	Seriously thinking in getting the ECS GF8200-A
2009-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	I usually go for stability over latest features so I'm happy with what I have now
2009-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	1200 FPS using the geforce card on the PCI slot
2009-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	nice
2009-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	djzn	Halitech	I asked... lol
2009-11-04T19:59:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	what video card?
2009-11-04T20:00:00.000Z	Halitech	djzn	if it works okay with the ubuntu driver then se it, if not, get the ati driver
