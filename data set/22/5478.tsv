2007-05-31T09:48:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	my experience is that KDE will clutter your menu's and then you have to remove all that stuff from your gnome menu
2007-05-31T09:48:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	yeah, i don't think i'm going to actually put kde alongside..was just curious
2007-05-31T09:49:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	I tried it and never really got into it.  But there are some people who swear by KDE... who knows you may be one of them.  You can always uninstall if you don't like it
2007-05-31T09:49:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	yeah, i've used kde before and did like it..somewhat...im pretty sure i'm just going to stick with ubuntu
2007-05-31T09:52:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	:-) If you want to have some fun, try a bunch of windows managers.  I recommend Enlightenment and looking glass... they're very different though still not practical (give 'em a year or so development time)
2007-05-31T09:52:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	i may have to look into that :)
2007-05-31T09:53:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	do you have links to those two programs?
2007-05-31T09:53:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	there's a enlightenment repo for Ubuntu... ubuntuguide.org/ubuntu_festy has it
2007-05-31T09:54:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	i was wondering cause i would like to see some screenshots and more information about them if its possible
2007-05-31T09:54:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	if not then www.get-e.org may have a repo... if you want to compile the latest version then www.enlightenment.org
2007-05-31T09:54:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	thanks!
2007-05-31T09:54:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	images.google.com search for looking glass, or enlightenment
2007-05-31T09:54:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	sounds good
2007-05-31T09:55:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	err.... enlightnment gives you religious stuf.... search for "enlightenment desktop"
2007-05-31T09:56:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	i used enlightenment ubuntu and got some images - how stable is it, and does it use a large chuck of resources?
2007-05-31T09:57:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	Enlightenment uses about as much resource as GNOME, though more than some other ones XFCE
2007-05-31T09:57:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	Looking Glass uses a TON of resources... it's REALLY intense, and 3 dimensional, etc. etc.
2007-05-31T09:57:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	ah thanks for the info
2007-05-31T09:57:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	my pleasure.  I know I had a lot of fun looking at those two, so I'm just passing on the joy
2007-05-31T09:58:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	does it play well with Beryl?
2007-05-31T09:58:00.000Z	hendrixski	sainzeo	no.  neither of those do ... but with Looking Glass you don't need beryl, it's already 3D
2007-05-31T09:59:00.000Z	sainzeo	hendrixski	ah, i see
