2012-04-09T21:53:00.000Z	salaria		Hi, I have a package which is in compress file .tar.gz, how can i install that program! im using ubuntu 10.04 plz help
2012-04-09T21:54:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	tar zxvf foo.tar.gz
2012-04-09T21:54:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	generqally though, prefer to install software from the repository (software centre I suppose)
2012-04-09T21:56:00.000Z	ssta		umm, mounting an iso takes no diskspace
2012-04-09T21:56:00.000Z	salaria	ssta	tar zxvf is used to extract files of install?
2012-04-09T21:56:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	yes
2012-04-09T21:56:00.000Z	salaria		*or install?
2012-04-09T21:57:00.000Z	salaria	ssta	 I want to install the package not extract?
2012-04-09T21:57:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	extract it, then look inside there for a README or INSTALL file or something.  They all install differently
2012-04-09T21:58:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	but installing from the repository is generally much better
2012-04-09T21:58:00.000Z	salaria		i have wampserver's package
2012-04-09T21:58:00.000Z	salaria		do i need to compile the source code
2012-04-09T21:58:00.000Z	ssta		I thought archive mounter could mount them GUIwise?  That's default installed I believe?
2012-04-09T21:59:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	is that a LAMP stack?
2012-04-09T21:59:00.000Z	salaria	ssta	 yes it is but few softwares are not available under ubuntu software center
2012-04-09T21:59:00.000Z	salaria		its wamp
2012-04-09T22:00:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	LAMP is the same thing, but for Linux I believe.  You can install a LAMP stack from the software centre
2012-04-09T22:01:00.000Z	salaria		i went to wamp's website and found that they have a linux package as well... so i downloaded... well, its all ok I ws just keen to know about installing tar.gz like files and got solution i believe.
2012-04-09T22:01:00.000Z	salaria		:)
2012-04-09T22:02:00.000Z	salaria		now I have configured web server manually using apt-get install apache2
2012-04-09T22:02:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	sudo tasksel install lamp-server
2012-04-09T22:02:00.000Z	ssta	salaria	as easy as that...and you have all the package managed advantages and none of the heartache
