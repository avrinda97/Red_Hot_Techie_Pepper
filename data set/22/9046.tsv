2005-03-25T11:40:00.000Z	meldroc		dammit, the nvidia drivers do not want to work!  when I try enabling the nvidia drivers instead of the nv drivers, I get an NVidia splash screen, then I get a few pieces of the kdm login screen on top of it.  absolutely will not work correctly! >_<
2005-03-25T11:41:00.000Z	meldroc		i had this exact same problem on my older debian unstable box - started happening when drivers updated to 6629.  i reverted to 6111 to make it go away.
2005-03-25T11:41:00.000Z	meldroc		anyone know where I can get 6111 drivers for ubuntu?
2005-03-25T11:42:00.000Z	meldroc		6629 is utter crap!  nvidia should never have released it in that state.
2005-03-25T11:42:00.000Z	meldroc		thanks tritium
2005-03-25T11:44:00.000Z	meldroc		ew, the morgue.ubuntu.com interface makes it impossible to find anything
2005-03-25T11:44:00.000Z	meldroc		does anyone know if the new 7167 nvidia drivers fix the bugs in 6629?
2005-03-25T11:45:00.000Z	meldroc		other than that, anyone know where i can find 7167 or 6111 nvidia driver packages?  i'm pretty sure that 6111 will work.  haven't tried 7167 yet...
2005-03-25T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	I doubt Hoary will get 1.0-7167
2005-03-25T11:50:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	keep in mind you'll be treading a thin line if you continue to update Hoary, then
2005-03-25T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	whenever l-r-m or nvidia-glx or xorg* (and more packages) are updated, you'll have to reinstall the Nvidia drivers/libs
2005-03-25T12:10:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	no
2005-03-25T12:11:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	do not symlink
2005-03-25T12:11:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	tell the Nvidia installer to use /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
2005-03-25T12:12:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	read the README that's distributed with the Nvidia installer
2005-03-25T12:12:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	particularly the advanced options
2005-03-26T10:49:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	did you run update && upgrade at all yesterday?
2005-03-26T10:50:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	you _really_ ought to install apt-listchanges
2005-03-26T10:50:00.000Z	meldroc	crimsun	- what does apt-listchanges do?
2005-03-26T10:50:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	an update of linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) went in yesterday
2005-03-26T10:51:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	it lists changes to updated packages before they're installed
2005-03-26T10:51:00.000Z	crimsun	meldroc	same recommendation for apt-listbugs
