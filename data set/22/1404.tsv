2010-06-15T05:22:00.000Z	tmas		My ubuntu install is sticking at 5%, any ideas on how to fix it?
2010-06-15T05:22:00.000Z	tmas		Yes, I'm installing 10.04.
2010-06-15T05:23:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	what do you mean "sticking"?
2010-06-15T05:24:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	troubleshoot.  did you checksum the iso and the burned install disk?
2010-06-15T05:25:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	I did a checksum on the iso, but how do I checksum a burned disk? Make an image and get the checksum of that?
2010-06-15T05:26:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	no checksumming the burned iso is a little different.  see the tutorial i sent your way
2010-06-15T05:27:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	btw, if BOTH check out, i'd suggest downloading and using the alternate installation iso just to avoid the gnome hiccups
2010-06-15T05:28:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	I need to burn a new cd, it looks like. I just took out the cd and glanced at the bottom, then realized that I had found the thing on my desk under some papers and stuff. Covered in scratches!
2010-06-15T05:28:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	well i guess that MIGHT effect things...:)
2010-06-15T05:29:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	Well, yeah. If the disk can't be read, it's unlikely to install properly.
2010-06-15T05:33:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	I swear, I just looked at the bottom of that scratched disk and saw "MICROSOFT". I immediately threw it away and remembered that my computer originally ran windows.
2010-06-16T01:50:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	still?  did you try the alternate install distro?
2010-06-16T01:50:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	I've gotten 10.04 installed on the same computer before, but I'm installing to a USB disk now.
2010-06-16T01:51:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	installing to usb or creating a usb startup disk - NOT the same
2010-06-16T01:51:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	I've got to go for a couple minutes, back soon.
2010-06-16T02:14:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	Back
2010-06-16T02:16:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	I'm installing to a USB harddrive, not creating a USB boot disk.
2010-06-16T02:20:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	restate the issue for the board.  Personally, I think just creating a start up disk is a whole lot easier than the USB install.  but that's me :)
2010-06-16T02:20:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	How  would I set up a USB boot disk?
2010-06-16T02:21:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	System>Administration>Startup Disk Creator
2010-06-16T02:21:00.000Z	tmas	acerimmer_	On livecd?
2010-06-16T02:22:00.000Z	acerimmer_	tmas	yes
