2009-06-06T04:32:00.000Z	Apollo2366		http://paste.ubuntu.com/189323/ this is the terminal command and output
2009-06-06T04:33:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	have you got libstdc++ installed?
2009-06-06T04:34:00.000Z	Apollo2366	boss_mc	probably not, Synaptic right?
2009-06-06T04:34:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	it's cos you're building with gcc when you're using c++ code
2009-06-06T04:34:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	use g++
2009-06-06T04:35:00.000Z	Apollo2366	boss_mc	Do I have to install it? Is the terminal command any different?
2009-06-06T04:35:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	if you installed build-essential then you have it
2009-06-06T04:35:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	the syntax is basically the same (it's exactly the same for your purposes)
2009-06-06T04:36:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	yep
2009-06-06T04:46:00.000Z	Apollo2366	boss_mc	This might seem stupid, but when I compile with g++, how do I specify a seperate directory for the output file? Because I did g++ -o ..\bin\Hello Hello.cpp and it just made it a hidden file named ..binHello in the src directory.
2009-06-06T04:46:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	linux uses / where windows uses \
2009-06-06T04:46:00.000Z	Apollo2366	boss_mc	OH ok thanks
2009-06-06T04:46:00.000Z	boss_mc	Apollo2366	switch your slashes (\ is for escape codes which is why they're getting ignored)
