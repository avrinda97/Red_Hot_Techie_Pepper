2008-01-07T10:10:00.000Z	ionstorm		i have a quick question regarding traceroute, is there anything wrong with this trace? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51050/
2008-01-07T10:10:00.000Z	ionstorm		for some reason after my gateway there is a 192.168.100.113 ip
2008-01-07T10:10:00.000Z	ionstorm		anyone good in networking?
2008-01-07T10:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ionstorm	There's nothing wrong with that...
2008-01-07T10:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ionstorm	How is your net setup?
2008-01-07T10:12:00.000Z	ionstorm	Cpudan80	I have a modem, then my 2wire gateway is running in direct ip or dhcp mode and im connected through wifi
2008-01-07T10:13:00.000Z	ionstorm	Cpudan80	why is that 3rd hop a local ip range after my gateway ip
2008-01-07T10:13:00.000Z	ionstorm		it just looks odd to me, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51050/
2008-01-07T10:13:00.000Z	ionstorm		wifi-router-modem-yahoo
2008-01-07T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ionstorm	It's not
2008-01-07T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ionstorm	Your IPs are 192.168.1.XXX
2008-01-07T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Or I think that's what they are - based on your paste
2008-01-07T10:15:00.000Z	ionstorm		yes mine is 1.66
2008-01-07T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80		That is .100.113
2008-01-07T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80		.1 != .100
2008-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	ionstorm		3rd hop is 192.168.100.113
2008-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	ionstorm		why?
2008-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ionstorm	It's just some other IP out there
2008-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	ionstorm		ah ic, im wondering why it is in local ip range then
2008-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	ionstorm		k
2008-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ionstorm	It's not in your local range
2008-01-07T10:17:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ionstorm	Your local range is 192.168.1.0-255
