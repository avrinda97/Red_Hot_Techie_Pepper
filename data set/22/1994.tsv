2009-10-30T21:56:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	/join #channel-name
2009-10-30T21:57:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	explain more, please
2009-10-30T21:58:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	I KNOW, RIGHT? NO NEED TO SHOUT.
2009-10-30T21:58:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	Further IRC-related questions go to #freenode.
2009-10-30T21:59:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	so I just type "#freenode"?
2009-10-30T21:59:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	...no.
2009-10-30T22:00:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdelOne: Thanks guys, but, obviously, I am new to this thing :)
2009-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	To join a channel, type /join #channel-name
2009-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdleOne: will I leave this "room" and not talk to you guys anymore? (I sort of like the talk here)
2009-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	If the channel did not exist, it will be created automatically.
2009-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	So now join #freenode.
2009-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	No, you can be in as many channels as you want.
2009-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	(Technically, there _is_ a limit of channels per network, but it doesn't matter yet.)
2009-10-30T22:02:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdleOne: I feel at home already! So, IRC works, really! Cool stuff man!
2009-10-30T22:03:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdleOne: Thanks a million guys and (grawity: thanks for accepting my apologies!)
2009-10-30T22:07:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdleOne: I successfully joined the freenode ... but it's sort of quiet in there ... :)
2009-10-30T22:07:00.000Z	grawity	dawit	#freenode is a help channel - and it's only active when people ask for help
2009-10-30T22:11:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdleOne: Now I get it!
2009-10-30T22:13:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdleOne: internet is sort of slooow here and the lines are freezing on my screen; but here's a question how can I install 1)a webcam [logitech] on Ubuntu 2) a ZTE wireless modem 3G?
2009-10-30T22:19:00.000Z	dawit	grawity	& IdleOne: thanx but cnxn is really bad; will try again later! g'd nite!
