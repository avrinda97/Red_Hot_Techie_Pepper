2010-06-14T00:47:00.000Z	mushy1		how do you do it if you want to make make install in 1 line? do you use |
2010-06-14T00:48:00.000Z	mushy1		xchat
2010-06-14T00:48:00.000Z	mushy1		its not in ubuntu software center
2010-06-14T00:48:00.000Z	mushy1		i didnt feel like using apt-get
2010-06-14T00:48:00.000Z	mushy1		it is not there
2010-06-14T00:49:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	also Synaptic is almost as easy as Software Center.
2010-06-14T01:02:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	I'm seeing xchat-gnome in synaptic.  Synaptic is  a great way to install/uninstall packages.
2010-06-14T01:03:00.000Z	mushy1	nUboon2Age	what about the default ubuntu software center i do not see it in there, i also do not see anything about more sources i think i have all the sources checked
2010-06-14T01:03:00.000Z	mushy1	nUboon2Age	is synaptic that much better?
2010-06-14T01:04:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	Synaptic is kind of the next step into the details of apt-get from Ubuntu Software Center.
2010-06-14T01:05:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	So the easiest is Software Center, next is Synaptic, next dpkg, next command line apt-get, and much, much harder is building from source.
2010-06-14T01:06:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	I'll check and see if I got it from a different repository.
2010-06-14T01:06:00.000Z	mushy1	nUboon2Age	i have looked i see xchat on synaptic, i will add it to my list of apps over the default ubuntu soft center
2010-06-14T03:13:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	did you look at http://xfce-look.org/
2010-06-14T03:14:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	I know what you mean re: terminal transparency.  I used to have Xubuntu installed, but not right now, so i can't check it, but
2010-06-14T03:16:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	when you're looking at your terminal in xfce, does it have an edit menu?
2010-06-14T03:16:00.000Z	mushy1	nUboon2Age	yes and profile pref i will settle for cheap background transparency
2010-06-14T03:18:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	so when you look at "Background" does it give you the option to use a transparent background?
2010-06-14T03:18:00.000Z	mushy1	nUboon2Age	yes but just to the desktop image i was asking about it showing everything under it
2010-06-14T03:20:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	in the gnome terminal I have in front of me, there are three options, transparent being the third.  Do you have that?
2010-06-14T03:21:00.000Z	mushy1	nUboon2Age	yes dont worry about it i got it
2010-06-14T03:22:00.000Z	nUboon2Age	mushy1	I was in kinda the opposite situation last night where I couldn't figure out how to get away from transparent terminal.  I didn't really figure it out, but changed theme and it was ok.
