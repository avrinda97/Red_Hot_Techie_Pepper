2010-04-09T07:33:00.000Z	Golumm		I was upgrading my ubuntu to 9.10 but suddently my network disconnected. How can I resume the upgrade???
2010-04-09T07:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	Golumm	restarting the upgrade and letting it calculate what it needs to download would probably be best
2010-04-09T07:34:00.000Z	Golumm		Idle0ne there is no upgrade button in the update manager and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade didn't work
2010-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	Golumm	try sudo apt-get -f install
2010-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	Golumm	is apt-get upgrade giving any errors?
2010-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	Golumm		Idle0ne no.
2010-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	Golumm	it's an O not a 0
2010-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	Golumm	IdleOne	sudo apt-get -f install didn't work as well
2010-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	Golumm	didn't work? in what sense?
2010-04-09T07:37:00.000Z	Golumm	IdleOne	zero packets updated.
2010-04-09T07:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	Golumm	ok you went from 9.04 to 9.10?
2010-04-09T07:38:00.000Z	Golumm		No, I'm still in 9.04
2010-04-09T07:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	Golumm	do lsb_release -a make sure
2010-04-09T07:38:00.000Z	Golumm	IdleOne	yeah, Jaunty 9.04
