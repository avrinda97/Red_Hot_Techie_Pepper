2006-05-26T11:44:00.000Z	Arrick		anyone, I installed the default install, how do I get it so the gui doesnt automatically start?
2006-05-26T11:45:00.000Z	mwiggins	Arrick	remove *[gk] dm from /etc/rc2.d
2006-05-26T11:46:00.000Z	Arrick	mwiggins	will that still allow startx to run the gui?
2006-05-26T11:47:00.000Z	mwiggins	Arrick	yes, it just wont start the display managers automatically, you could still start them with /etc/init.d/gdm start
2006-05-26T11:47:00.000Z	mwiggins		or with startx
2006-05-26T11:47:00.000Z	Arrick	mwiggins	ok, is that a command that has to happen with sudo, or do I need to edit a text?
2006-05-26T11:48:00.000Z	mwiggins	Arrick	both commands i told you require superuser access
2006-05-26T11:48:00.000Z	Arrick		ok thanks
2006-05-26T11:48:00.000Z	mwiggins		except for startx
2006-05-26T11:48:00.000Z	mwiggins		which technically was the third
2006-05-26T11:49:00.000Z	Arrick	mwiggins	its saying "sudo: remove: command not found
2006-05-26T11:49:00.000Z	mwiggins		hehe
2006-05-26T11:49:00.000Z	mwiggins	Arrick	 you need to remove the file in /etc/rc2.d that starts the display manager
2006-05-26T11:49:00.000Z	mwiggins		'rm' removes files
2006-05-26T11:51:00.000Z	Arrick	mwiggins	would that be S13gdm?
2006-05-26T11:51:00.000Z	mwiggins	Arrick	yes
2006-05-26T11:51:00.000Z	Arrick		ok
2006-05-26T11:53:00.000Z	Arrick	mwiggins	why wont it allow me to delete or remove that file?
2006-05-26T11:53:00.000Z	mwiggins	Arrick	use sudo
2006-05-26T11:53:00.000Z	Arrick		it says del and remove are not found in command line
2006-05-26T11:53:00.000Z	mwiggins		sudo rm /etc/rc2.d/s13gdm
2006-05-26T11:54:00.000Z	Arrick	mwiggins	sorry, not used to linux any more
