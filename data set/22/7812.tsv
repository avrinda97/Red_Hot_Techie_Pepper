2007-08-04T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	will you stop spamming the channel with your error messages please
2007-08-04T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	if it's urgent, it's particularly important that you stick to the rules and don't alienate the people here.
2007-08-04T06:06:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	all the more reason to listen carefully to the replies, especially IdleOne's
2007-11-27T00:13:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	rsync comes to mind
2007-11-27T00:21:00.000Z	richard__	soundray	rsync user@name.server.com: /local/dir --compare-dest=/local/dir/ ?
2007-11-27T00:21:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	not sure what you're trying to do, but that doesn't look right
2007-11-27T00:22:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	have a look on the web for rsync tutorials -- there are plenty.
2007-11-27T00:22:00.000Z	richard__	soundray	trying to compare the files i copied locally from a remote server that's failing to make sure they copied properly...
2007-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	I would use rsync to just copy them again. Rsync won't re-transfer files if they are already present in the destination.
2007-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	richard__	soundray	ok thx
2007-11-27T00:26:00.000Z	richard__	soundray	rsync -avHK user@source.host.com:/opt/backup/ /local/backup?
2007-11-27T00:27:00.000Z	soundray	richard__	that's looking better. Try with the -n or --dry-run option before you launch it in earnest.
