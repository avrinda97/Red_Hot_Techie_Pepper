2012-10-30T06:15:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	sorry, windows .exe
2012-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	.exe does not work in linux
2012-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	that's why I'd use pol and wine
2012-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	unless you use embedded solution swhich are damn slow
2012-10-30T06:18:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	why not???
2012-10-30T06:18:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	I have no idea
2012-10-30T06:19:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	what ubuntu are you using?
2012-10-30T06:19:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	I'm on maverick (yes I know)
2012-10-30T06:20:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	why still use such an old release?
2012-10-30T06:20:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	I'm gonna switch but I need time and I don't have it ...
2012-10-30T06:21:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	camon you dont need so much time
2012-10-30T06:21:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	also, I'm having major problems with recent releases when using them via liveUSB
2012-10-30T06:21:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	I at least need to do a backup
2012-10-30T06:21:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	you have a very simple solution-> dd
2012-10-30T06:22:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	I don't have a disk to welcome the datas
2012-10-30T06:22:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	usb sticks are chip
2012-10-30T06:23:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	maybe for you ...
2012-10-30T06:23:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	camon, you can by a usb stick 8GB for 10â‚¬
2012-10-30T06:23:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	still you can go for a dvd
2012-10-30T06:25:00.000Z	simplew	kujablak	thats another story...
2012-10-30T06:34:00.000Z	kujablak	simplew	by the way, one of the reasons why I don't upgrade is because the more I go into recent releases, the slower my laptop gets and less and less accessories are working
