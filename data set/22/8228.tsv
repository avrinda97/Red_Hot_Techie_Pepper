2009-02-02T02:41:00.000Z	helpme2		Hey guys, I switched to ubuntu about a year ago and have been very happy. However, the other day I had to format and reinstall windows and this deleted the Grub bootloader. I am currently running a live cd of 8.10 and trying to follow a tutorial to reinstall grub on my windows partition hd0,0.. However, when i type  setup (hd0) in terminal after writing sudo grub then root (hd0,0(, i get an errro that says Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition. how can
2009-02-02T02:42:00.000Z	helpme2		i fix this . Thanks
2009-02-02T02:42:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	which partition is your linux one
2009-02-02T02:42:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	is it /dev/sda5
2009-02-02T02:43:00.000Z	helpme2	dean	I dunno, its not on the master drive
2009-02-02T02:43:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	what is it then
2009-02-02T02:43:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	if you donit know try find /boot/grub/stage1
2009-02-02T02:44:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	then don't do setup (hd0)
2009-02-02T02:44:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	root (hd1, ...)
2009-02-02T02:44:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	because it is sdb it is the second hard drive
2009-02-02T02:45:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	so using hd1 instead of hd0 should work
2009-02-02T02:45:00.000Z	helpme2	dean	but i thought I had to install grub on the partition where the windows bootloader is. Also, I have a different partition for /home /root
2009-02-02T02:47:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	ok do root (1,1) and setup (hd0)
2009-02-02T02:47:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	yes
2009-02-02T02:48:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	http://orgs.man.ac.uk/documentation/grub/grub_3.html
2009-02-02T02:48:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	at section 3.2 it says to use the partition which has your /boot directory for the root
2009-02-02T02:49:00.000Z	helpme2	dean	ok i will try it
2009-02-02T02:55:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	so now when you try to boot you always go to windows
2009-02-02T02:55:00.000Z	helpme2	dean	yes, that is correct
2009-02-02T02:57:00.000Z	dean	helpme2	install grub to the Linux drive, then use the bios boot menu to select OS
2009-02-02T03:19:00.000Z	helpme2	dean	kylek, IM back, i installed GRUB and grub loaded up after a bit of trouble, however after selecting any of the ubuntu 8.10 or 7.10 options i got error 17 cannot mount selected partition. What could be the problem?
