2005-08-24T11:03:00.000Z	tgnb		the howto said something about driver version 8.12.10 being available in breezy.. can i install the newest drivers 8.14.something via the apt-get or do i have to somehow manually install them
2005-08-24T11:05:00.000Z	tgnb		man page is the "manual" for a given command
2005-08-24T11:05:00.000Z	tgnb		type man man
2005-08-24T11:05:00.000Z	tgnb		or man yourcommand
2005-08-24T11:05:00.000Z	tgnb		you dont have to look at it to compare distros
2005-08-24T11:06:00.000Z	tgnb		then linux is not for you :)
2005-08-24T11:06:00.000Z	tgnb		you like it but you dont want to learn about commands.... um ok
2005-08-24T11:06:00.000Z	tgnb		whatever
2005-08-24T11:06:00.000Z	Luna-Tick	tgnb	come on
2005-08-24T11:06:00.000Z	Luna-Tick		The whole point of Ubuntu is for people who don't want to live in the command prompt
2005-08-24T11:06:00.000Z	tgnb		i was trying to help him :)
2005-08-24T11:07:00.000Z	tgnb		he asked what a manpage is and why he has to read them to compare distros. i gave clear answers :)
2005-08-24T11:07:00.000Z	Luna-Tick		Rock: Ubuntu is getting there but is new, Mandrake is pretty good
2005-08-24T11:07:00.000Z	Luna-Tick		for real beginners
2005-08-24T11:08:00.000Z	Luna-Tick		(like me...)
2005-08-24T11:08:00.000Z	Luna-Tick		Rock: I suggest that you give mandrake a go
2005-08-24T11:08:00.000Z	Luna-Tick		I found it more user-friendly
2005-08-24T11:09:00.000Z	Luna-Tick		Yes - It can, but you will have to edit an 'fstab'
2005-08-24T11:09:00.000Z	tgnb		well Luna-Tick if you can tell me how i can install ati-drivers with working acceleration support in ubuntu on a fresh install on a Thinkpad laptop.. i'll be happy to hear it.. without the command line ;)
2005-08-24T11:10:00.000Z	Luna-Tick	tgnb	What I meant was not that it is possible to do everything without the command line, but that this is the point of Ubuntu
2005-08-24T11:11:00.000Z	Luna-Tick	tgnb	Anything that requires the command line is a shortcoming of Ubuntu
2005-08-24T11:11:00.000Z	tgnb	Luna-Tick	ok fair enough :) i still need help with that though.. even on a command line. Razor-X ... can i use apt-get to install the latest drivers or do i have to manually install them
