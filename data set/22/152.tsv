2012-06-14T20:41:00.000Z	mdpatrick		How do I upgrade on php beyond 5.3.2 on Ubuntu using apt-get??? This version is a bit old
2012-06-14T20:41:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2012-06-14T20:42:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	lucid, 10.04
2012-06-14T20:42:00.000Z	mdpatrick		Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS
2012-06-14T20:42:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	 i gotcha there.  which version of php were you aiming for?
2012-06-14T20:43:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	at least 5.3.3, but basically as up-to-date as I can get without deviating too far from what I should be using on this version of ubuntu
2012-06-14T20:45:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	sorry, my connection got interrupted. may have missed your response.
2012-06-14T20:46:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	I want at least php 5.3.3, preferably installed with aptâ€¦ or as up-to-date as I can get without screwing anything up or inviting the devil into my VPS. I'm using lucid 10.04.4 LTS ubuntu.
2012-06-14T20:46:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	welcome back.  you missed nothing.  well... the latest version of PHP in Lucid is what you see, there is no newer version in Lucid.  There are newer versions in natty and onwards, did you try downloading the natty package and installing it
2012-06-14T20:46:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	and don't repeat ;P
2012-06-14T20:47:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	Ah. Hmm. That sounds like I might be inviting trouble there.
2012-06-14T20:47:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	you could have someone try and repackage the newer package for lucid
2012-06-14T20:47:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	Right?
2012-06-14T20:47:00.000Z	LordOfTime		but the reliability of that is... ...iffy
2012-06-14T20:51:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	OK, that helps a lot. I contacted our VPS support to ask them what approach we should take. Thanks for your input, very helpful.
2012-06-14T20:52:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	i dont think that'll help you though
2012-06-14T20:52:00.000Z	LordOfTime		your "VPS" support is probably limited to basic support
2012-06-14T20:52:00.000Z	LordOfTime		not systems updates
2012-06-14T20:52:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	^
2012-06-14T20:53:00.000Z	mdpatrick	LordOfTime	Probably, but I'd bet they can at least shoot me some appropriate links. Setting apache, and php up on a clean install shouldn't be too bad. We also have a sysadmin on staff that would probably better be able to accomplish this than myself, and I can rely on him to some degree. Regardless, I'm satisfied with knowing I should probably progress no further until I get feedback from the both of them.
2012-06-14T20:54:00.000Z	mdpatrick		That is, support, and our in-house sysadmin
2012-06-14T20:54:00.000Z	LordOfTime	mdpatrick	i hope he understands packaging ;P
