2007-10-16T05:58:00.000Z	FluxD		Hi, my external drive is not automounting. Any suggestions as to what could be wrong?
2007-10-16T05:59:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	FluxD	What format is it? NTFS?
2007-10-16T05:59:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	yea
2007-10-16T05:59:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	FluxD	Are you using feisty?
2007-10-16T05:59:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	yep
2007-10-16T06:00:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	FluxD	Then you need to install ntfs-g3. Just go the Add/Remove programs and search for "ntfs"
2007-10-16T06:01:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	but it used to automount even if it was read only
2007-10-16T06:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	FluxD	Did you try going to System -> Preferences -> Removable Drives and Media and see if auto-mount is enabled?
2007-10-16T06:04:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	it was automounting fine until I installed ntfs-3g but apparently after that it would never automount so I uninstalled it and after that its always like this
2007-10-16T06:05:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	FluxD	ntfs-3g is considered rather buggy in fiesty. However, it has been fixed in Gusty.
2007-10-16T06:05:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	it was working fine for me in edgy
2007-10-16T06:06:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	any other way so it can automount on plugin ?
2007-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	FluxD	Not that I can think of. But I'm not a guru. So I'm very sorry I couldn't help you much. :(
2007-10-16T06:07:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	np but ty for the help
2008-04-20T06:46:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	FluxD	did you do with sudo?
2008-04-20T06:46:00.000Z	FluxD	Odd-rationale	how do u install ubuntu-desktop with all dependencies?
