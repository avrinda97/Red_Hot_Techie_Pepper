2011-01-14T16:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	archana	the proxy settings in synaptic also include authentication settings
2011-01-14T16:33:00.000Z	archana	sacarlson	ok but i am getting forbidden error all over when i use sudo apt-get update
2011-01-14T16:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	archana	that is cli not synaptic
2011-01-14T16:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	archana	are you running desktop edition?  or do you only have cli?

2011-01-14T16:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	archana	if your running desktop why not just use synaptic?

2011-01-14T16:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	archana	does anything work on your proxy?  like firefox?
