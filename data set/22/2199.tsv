2009-08-27T10:18:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	ciao :)
2009-08-27T10:22:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	well, I knew how to help you. But I think I'll pass
2009-08-27T10:23:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	comp sci students love linux because comp sci students are avdersarial by nature, and you dont know how to help me
2009-08-27T10:23:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	nah, comp sci students love linux because they are usually smart enough to figure out their problems on their own.
2009-08-27T10:24:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	you're a rude sod and shouldnot be ina  hel channel if you thnk everyone should figure out thier own problems
2009-08-27T10:24:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	I didn't say that. I commented on comp sci students in reply to your observation
2009-08-27T10:25:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	uhhh yes you did
2009-08-27T10:25:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	OMG you're the one that just said everyone who isnt a compsci student or whoneeds occasional help with a problem isnt smart
2009-08-27T10:25:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	maybe you could get someone in the channel to teach you how to use "ignore"
2009-08-27T10:26:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	news flash you troll, some people have other things in thier life
2009-08-27T10:26:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	I'm sure if you ask nicely they could walk you through it
2009-08-27T10:26:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	yes. Please cease this OT conversation. Thank you
2009-08-27T10:26:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	if they make me shut up when i go off topic they should makre you shut up, but they didnt because you were jerking it about how awesome linux was
2009-08-27T10:36:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	please remain on topic. This is a support channel :)
2009-08-27T10:36:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	which is what i'm trying to do but for your harassment
2009-08-27T10:38:00.000Z	belcher	Innomen	as I said, get someone to teach you how to use "ignore". It shouldn't take you too long - a couple days or so.
2009-08-27T10:39:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	idont ignore people oin principal, its akin to censorship
2009-08-27T10:39:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	i just wanted whoever was in charge here ot tell you i didnt have you kicked so you could leave me alone
2009-08-27T10:41:00.000Z	Innomen	belcher	uh huh, that why you're still sending me a steady stream of 12 year old hate mail and you're still calling me names, but still, even you have a right to free speech, since i'm pretty sure you know i wasnt the one that kicked you by now, i'm done, but somehow i suspect you'll have more to say :)
