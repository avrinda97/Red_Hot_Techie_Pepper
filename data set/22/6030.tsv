2007-03-25T07:37:00.000Z	tuqann		anyone can help here?
2007-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	tuqann		I followed tutorial instructions, asked the question on the channel before and still getting the mesa drivers, which is causing my system to halt whenever I shutdown or restart, I'm asking if anyone knows what configs I have to do to get rid of Mesa and get ATI drivers running instead
2007-03-25T07:39:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	are the ati drivers not working?
2007-03-25T07:40:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	do they not work at all or does direct rendering not show up under ati?
2007-03-25T07:41:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	and this is happening with Vesa?  please answer the above questions
2007-03-25T07:43:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	type "glxinfo | grep rendering"  and see if it says Yes or No
2007-03-25T07:45:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	are you running the ati drivers right now?  "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep fglrx"
2007-03-25T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	ok you are using the slow open source one right now.  but you said you had trouble shutting down, why did you think it was the video driver?
2007-03-25T07:47:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	ok we can try.  you have followed these instructions?
2007-03-25T07:48:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	is it any slower with Mesa/FGLRX than with ATI?
2007-03-25T07:48:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	and even though it's mesa, does it solve your shutdown issues?
2007-03-25T07:49:00.000Z	tuqann	xtknight	whct do you think is my shutdown problem?
2007-03-25T07:49:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	i have absolutely no idea, sadly
2007-03-25T07:49:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	but do the fglrx drivers fix it..?
2007-03-25T07:50:00.000Z	tuqann	xtknight	I really don't know if the fglrx drivers would fix it, but I'm attempting to set them up and check if my shutdown problems would be solved, I seem to miss a step that keeps using the mesa drivers instead of the ATI, mine is an x700 mobile
2007-03-25T07:50:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	but you typed fglrxinfo and said there was mesa...implying you had tried fglrx.  otherwise you wouldnt have fglrxinfo right?
2007-03-25T07:52:00.000Z	tuqann	xtknight	yes, I installed fglrx, first I installed an ati-driver.run from the ATI website, then I installed using the method in the !ati tutorial, but nothing changed yet when the shutdown
2007-03-25T07:53:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	i just need to know if you ever had the fglrx drivers running though
2007-03-25T07:54:00.000Z	tuqann	xtknight	I'm typing gflrxinfo in the terminal and I'm getting "command not found", though I could have sworn it worked before
2007-03-25T07:55:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	ok well then i guess you did have them loaded at one point.  that's what i was woneirng
2007-03-25T08:01:00.000Z	tuqann	xtknight	I have DISABLED_MODULES="fglrx| in the linux-restricted-modules-common, is that correct?
2007-03-25T08:02:00.000Z	xtknight	tuqann	eh?  i guess so.  it sounds like you're disabling the built-in fglrx, and that sounds right to me if you're trying drivers off ati.com
