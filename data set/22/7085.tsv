2007-06-02T07:19:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	how do you suggest?

2007-06-02T07:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	can i ask you about vmware... is it like a live cd or can i while i'm in one virtual os or another use it and have it use hard drive to save programs/applications and music and documentation and lose it when i exit?
2007-06-02T07:44:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	it's just like having a separate, new computer (with its own harddsk) the only difference is just that it is /virtual/ using resources of your actual computer
2007-06-02T07:52:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	given you have at least 512 MB of am in that Notebook
2007-06-02T07:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	i sure do, infact gonna increase it to 1gb to be on the safe side
2007-09-06T16:46:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	consider that ubuntu / kubuntu / xubuntu count as three distros on DW.... so to have correct numbers you'll have to sum that up. PCLOS is /far/ behind if you look at that
2007-09-06T16:47:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	ahhh.... good point.... is ubuntu stable though.... i've just had someone tell me it is... also that ubuntu doen't give true root priviledges
2007-09-06T16:49:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	1.) stable software is an illusion :-)  2.) ubuntu has its rough edges, but the most usable day to day distro on the desktop yet (what else do you expect to hear in #ubuntu? :-o ) 3.) ubuntu uses sudo instead of a root account
2008-05-11T14:36:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	select alsa output for vlc, not automatic. This will bypass this half broken pulse crap
2008-05-11T14:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	| rutgermasi ok, i see everything was set to autodetect... this is pulse crap... i didn't know, so select alsa, yes?
2008-05-11T14:38:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	right.. then save and restrt vlc to take the change to effect
2008-05-11T14:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	no joy
2008-05-11T14:41:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	check alsamixer if all levels are set (not to 0)
2008-05-11T14:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	Default Mixer Tracks can be set to HDA Intel (Alsa Mixer) or Capture: Alsa bla bla bla...
2008-05-11T14:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	what do you mean by alsamixer levels set not to 0 ?
2008-05-11T14:45:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	just check that your sound is not muted
2008-05-11T14:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	oh, no of course it isn't
2008-05-11T14:46:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	check for zombie instances of vlc and kill them, they might still hog the soundcard
2008-05-11T14:47:00.000Z	livingdaylight	stefg	even after a clean reboot?
2008-05-11T14:47:00.000Z	stefg	livingdaylight	err.... no
