2011-01-31T14:19:00.000Z	VF_123		Hi, does anyone know how to setup a Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY [14e4:4315] (rev 01)
2011-01-31T14:20:00.000Z	VF_123		I know
2011-01-31T14:20:00.000Z	VF_123		I followed those steps
2011-01-31T14:20:00.000Z	VF_123		I can connect for about 5 minutes after boot
2011-01-31T14:20:00.000Z	VF_123		then I lose connection, and I have to reboot
2011-01-31T14:21:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	what are you using to connect with? network manager or wicd?
2011-01-31T14:22:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	and you're sure network manager has been completely disabled?
2011-01-31T14:23:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	by checking the process list
2011-01-31T14:34:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	so wicd isn't running?
2011-01-31T14:34:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	okay, then they are likely cancelling each other out - you need to run one or the other, but not both
2011-01-31T14:35:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	and if you run this in a terminal:  ps axf | grep wicd
2011-01-31T14:39:00.000Z	VF_123	Gnea	should I do a reboot?
2011-01-31T14:39:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	did you find it in the ps list?
2011-01-31T14:41:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	okay, you have no wicd running, it's only using networkmanager. do you have nm-applet installed?
2011-01-31T14:44:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	UTP?
2011-01-31T14:44:00.000Z	VF_123	Gnea	an iwconfig wlan0 gives wlan0     IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:"dd-wrt"
2011-01-31T14:44:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	yes.
2011-01-31T14:49:00.000Z	VF_123	Gnea	It's working atm, I had to do a reboot. If it doesn't lose connection in a few minutes it should be solved.
2011-01-31T14:58:00.000Z	VF_123	Gnea	I didn't really know where to start, so I think that was right after boot.
2011-01-31T15:01:00.000Z	VF_123	Gnea	have you had a look at my pastebin?
2011-01-31T15:09:00.000Z	VF_123	Gnea	I suppose you don't find a solution to my problem?
2011-01-31T15:10:00.000Z	Gnea	VF_123	I'm afraid not, have you tried searching ubuntuforums.org? there's usually a lot of people using broadcom chips with issues and solutions there
