2010-04-23T07:50:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	u didnt get me
2010-04-23T07:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	 Wubi uhmm
2010-04-23T07:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	well better to use real partitions really
2010-04-23T07:51:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	i wanna use real partition only but i could not install through cd/dvd its not reading
2010-04-23T07:51:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	its directly taking me to windows... no booting options shown
2010-04-23T07:51:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	its not even taking from usb
2010-04-23T07:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	no I mean you can maybe make a bootable Ubuntu USB, and install from that
2010-04-23T07:52:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	I know that. i made bootable usb but still its not working
2010-04-23T07:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	 You may need to go into the bios of the computer and tell it to boot from CD
2010-04-23T07:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	or go into the bios and tell it to boot from USB
2010-04-23T07:53:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	only booting from first hard drive option is there in bios
2010-04-23T07:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	make the CD or USB whatever you want to boot form, the first boot device, if you can
2010-04-23T07:54:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	i cannot.. only first hard drive option is there to boot
2010-04-23T07:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	There is another way Ubuntu can be tried, well if the hardware can handle it, e.g. enough RAM
2010-04-23T07:56:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	ram  is jut 512 mb
2010-04-23T07:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	there is a program that can convert to a real partition, but it seems someone was saying that isn't easy
2010-04-23T07:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	ok  this other thing I was thinking of would probably work, but be a bit slow
2010-04-23T07:56:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	whats that, tell me.. will give a try
2010-04-23T07:57:00.000Z	candy_	sebsebseb	what?
2010-04-23T07:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	also I really do mean "try"  when I suggest doing Ubuntu inside Windows in a virtual machine.  Realy useauly it should be Windows inside Ubuntu, not the other way round.
2010-04-23T07:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	candy_	Wubi it seems can only read the Windows files, not write to them.  Also it may be a tiny bit slower than a proper partitioned install, but other than that, when it works, I guess it's ok really
