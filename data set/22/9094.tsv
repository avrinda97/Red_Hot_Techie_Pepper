2005-03-16T06:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	basically similar to ipmasq
2005-03-16T06:09:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation
2005-03-16T06:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	there is room for both free and proprietary software me thinks
2005-03-16T06:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	and yes, what Quest-Master said
2005-03-16T06:23:00.000Z	Ziggity	Xenguy	: but If wanted to open a startup developing bespoke software for others ( businesses ) -- whats the business model?
2005-03-16T06:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	the business model is definitely changing -- people are *not* going to pay for all software anymore.  Those days are gone IMO
2005-03-16T06:25:00.000Z	Ziggity	Xenguy	Then how does one make money from it.. By money I mean a profitable business.
2005-03-16T06:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	you need to seek a niche, a specialized software product where there is no free software that can do the same job...
2005-03-16T06:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	at the same time, you look to providing programming *service*, instead of just trying to sell/clone your code for profit
2005-03-16T06:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	but honestly I don't really think there is a problem because free software gives everyone (including you :-) the tools to program stuff for people who will pay you to do it...
2005-03-16T06:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	Ziggity	I am a firm supporter of free software BTW -- people should not have to be ripped off by some foreign (to me) wannabee monopoly corporation just to check their email ;-)
