2007-04-22T12:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	surviver	i don't know, last 3x I've installed Ubuntu, it just installed automatically, w/o giving a choice
2007-04-22T12:11:00.000Z	surviver	IndyGunFreak	try to install with u choice partitions option maybe u can set a partition for grub
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	surviver	IndyGunFreak	he installed the os its on his machine only the grub is wrong placed or configured
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	surviver	i know that, but if he's booting the second hard drive first.. and grub isn't loading, its probably not there.
2007-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	surviver	IndyGunFreak	jup that can explain it he can also try to reinstall and set choice of grub to hd0
2007-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	surviver	again, several ubuntu installs, and i've never been given a choice where to install grub.
2007-04-22T12:16:00.000Z	surviver	IndyGunFreak	maybe in his grub file there are this # marks in front so they dont show ? possible?
2007-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	surviver	no..
2007-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	surviver	he has grub, its on the other drive, why he's not restarted like i todl him to, i don't know.
