2009-07-04T11:14:00.000Z	enneract		Hey, I'm getting the error 'modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.28-11-generic/modules.dep: No such file or directory' on install attempt... any ideas?
2009-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	enneract		I'm getting the error 'modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.28-11-generic/modules.dep: No such file or directory' on install attempt... and I just verified that modules.dep is there....
2009-07-04T11:17:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	did you upgrade the kernel without rebooting?
2009-07-04T11:17:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	did you just install updates?
2009-07-04T11:18:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	when does that message come up?
2009-07-04T11:19:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	Ubuntu 9.04?
2009-07-04T11:20:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	are you booting off a CD or usb key?
2009-07-04T11:21:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	ah. I had a similar problem I think booting 9.04 Ubuntu off of a USB key, but Kubuntu worked fine. Don't know about netbook remix, though
2009-07-04T11:22:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	what model is your tablet?
2009-07-04T11:22:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	ah, with the ntrig digitizer?
2009-07-04T11:23:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	do you have a link? I've been trying to get the touch working but with no luck
2009-07-04T11:23:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	I have an HP model, but with the same digitizer. My ATI card works fine with the restricted drivers
2009-07-04T11:24:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	I think it's an ATI 3200HD
2009-07-04T11:24:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	but do you have a link to the article you were reading with the patches?
2009-07-04T11:25:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	ah, thanks. Missed it up there
2009-07-04T11:27:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	the older versions don't support the newer kernels you'll probably need for your digitizer
2009-07-04T11:37:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	yeah =/
2009-07-04T11:37:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	although, the OSS driver might work ok
2009-07-04T11:38:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	yeah, that's the one
2009-07-04T11:43:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	IIRC 8.10 might have a working graphics driver for that card as well, I think 9.04 was when they dropped support
2009-07-04T11:47:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	http://www.ubuntumini.com/2008/10/installing-ubuntu-netbook-remix.html <-- for dell mini but should be applicable
2009-07-04T11:49:00.000Z	adam7	enneract	and the HP tx2 line, which has ATI cards too
