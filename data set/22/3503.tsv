2008-09-08T07:07:00.000Z	icedwater		Hi guys, how do I make usplash stop looking for higher resolutions and go straight to 1024x768 ?
2008-09-08T07:08:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	I'm not sure, but i thing it has something about the kernel parameters
2008-09-08T07:09:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	so you can do that usplash thing :S
2008-09-08T07:10:00.000Z	icedwater	N0_Named_Guy	would love to help, but I need to know more?
2008-09-08T07:11:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	at the moment I can't help you more, I'm sleep drunk... :(
2008-09-08T07:11:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	I think I have some doc about that, in my files
2008-09-08T07:11:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	wait a moment plz
2008-09-08T07:17:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	got it
2008-09-08T07:17:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	just change the /etc/usplash.conf
2008-09-08T07:17:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	to the values you want ;)
2008-09-08T07:19:00.000Z	icedwater	N0_Named_Guy	I've tried it, it doesn't work.
2008-09-08T07:19:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	does your monitor and vga support that resolution? :S
2008-09-08T07:19:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	maybe it's some argument that is not passed to the kernel in boot time
2008-09-08T07:20:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	i can't tell the names right now... but I thing it has something to deal with the framebuffer thing...
2008-09-08T07:20:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	I think you must the framebuffer resolution :S
2008-09-08T07:21:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	u must change, I mean
2008-09-08T07:21:00.000Z	icedwater	N0_Named_Guy	my monitor supports 1024x768, but it tries two higher resolutions first
2008-09-08T07:22:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	in the grub's menu.lst pass to the kernel the arguments to put the framebuffer at the desired resolution
2008-09-08T07:22:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	that commands in particular I don't know by memory
2008-09-08T07:22:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	and aren't accessible to me right now :(
2008-09-08T07:23:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	yes
2008-09-08T07:23:00.000Z	N0_Named_Guy	icedwater	that stuff
