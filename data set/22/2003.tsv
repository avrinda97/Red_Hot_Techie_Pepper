2009-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		Skype isn't working on ubuntu 8.04, I get sound, but I cannot send sound?
2009-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		So, my friends won't hear me.
2009-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	Snicksie	x3r13x1z	you should change a little bit ;)
2009-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		change color of my text?
2009-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	Snicksie	x3r13x1z	try to set the sound settings to pulse, that should help ;)
2009-10-28T19:54:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		The sound is set to pulseaudio, and I can't change it
2009-10-28T19:56:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		?
2009-10-28T19:57:00.000Z	Snicksie	x3r13x1z	can't you change it? weird ;)
2009-10-28T19:58:00.000Z	Snicksie	x3r13x1z	do you have a screenshot of your exact problem? my skype works perfectly. i got pavu installed by the way, that helps imo to get the sound harder, sometimes it is not hard enough, perhaps that's the problem.  Try to install pavu ;)
2009-10-28T19:58:00.000Z	Snicksie	x3r13x1z	sorry, i mean pavucontrol; sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
2009-10-28T20:02:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		Thanks snicksie, I'll try that, just a moment
2009-10-28T20:06:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		Microphone, Speakers and Ringing, they are all set on "PulseAudio (local)", and I can't change any of them

2009-10-28T20:10:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		ok, I'll  test that
2009-10-28T20:11:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		There's no such thing as that in the Applications>Sound and video menu?
2009-10-28T20:11:00.000Z	x3r13x1z		:S
2009-10-28T20:14:00.000Z	x3r13x1z	Snicksie	I don't get it, I installed pavucontrol just as you said, but it isn't in the applications>Sound and Video menu?
2009-10-28T20:15:00.000Z	Snicksie	x3r13x1z	hm, here it was, try terminal -> pavucontrol
2009-10-28T20:16:00.000Z	x3r13x1z	Snicksie	Oh, now it worked =D
2009-10-28T20:25:00.000Z	x3r13x1z	Snicksie	Thanks sooo much! I changed the sound controls a bit and now it's working perfectly fine!!! =D thanks again!
