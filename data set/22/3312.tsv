2008-11-10T04:40:00.000Z	charles		Hello folks. I'm brand new to Ubuntu and would really appreciate some help regarding a technical issue.
2008-11-10T04:41:00.000Z	winferno	charles	Just ask your question, since it's a busy channel. If someone can help they probably will. =)
2008-11-10T04:43:00.000Z	winferno	charles	oh strange... is this using NFS or Samba? It sounds like a permission problem at first glance.
2008-11-10T04:47:00.000Z	charles	winferno	It's installed and seems to be working flawlessly to access all my other windows machines.
2008-11-10T04:48:00.000Z	winferno	charles	I'd double check the permission settings. I forget where samba looks for that though.
2008-11-10T04:48:00.000Z	charles	winferno	As i say, I can see the root directory, just can't go deeper than that
2008-11-10T04:48:00.000Z	winferno	charles	can you read or write from the root that you have mounted on the remote machine?
2008-11-10T04:49:00.000Z	charles	winferno	there's the smb.conf file. I've run a conparison between that file in 8.10 and the same file in 8.04 and there doesn't seem to b a difference.
2008-11-10T04:50:00.000Z	charles	winferno	I agree that it looks like a permission issue but I'm at a loss on how to correct it.
2008-11-10T04:50:00.000Z	winferno	charles	you might want to search smb.conf for any occurances of a machine name or IP. It might be allowing only the other machine you *can* access the share from.
2008-11-10T04:51:00.000Z	charles	winferno	Can I read or write.... ? I'll try.
2008-11-10T04:51:00.000Z	winferno	charles	I ask because if you can, I'd say you can more or less rule out a network problem.
2008-11-10T04:51:00.000Z	charles	winferno	okay. I'll look for that.
2008-11-10T04:53:00.000Z	charles	winferno	I can't write to the root directory of the external drive. I get an error saying "not supported by backend"
2008-11-10T04:56:00.000Z	winferno	charles	you may want to set up another share on the same machine that's not on an external drive, in a low-risk directory, then turn off all security on the share (there are some examples in smb.conf), and see if that works. If it does, you can work backward from there.
2008-11-10T04:57:00.000Z	winferno	charles	and by low risk I mean, no important files there.
2008-11-10T05:04:00.000Z	charles	winferno	once I make changes to the smb.conf file, do I need to restart samba?
2008-11-10T05:12:00.000Z	charles	winferno	You mentioned about setting up a share on the sam machine that's not on an external drive, but the external drive I have is a network drive and not connected to a machine. It's connected directly to my router
2008-11-10T05:15:00.000Z	charles	winferno	I think I've turned off all the security in smb.conf and restarted samba but still not dice. Perhaps I just have to satified with accessing as an ftp connection.
2008-11-10T05:16:00.000Z	charles	winferno	Any other thoughts?
2008-11-10T05:18:00.000Z	charles	winferno	Are you still there?
2008-11-10T05:22:00.000Z	charles	winferno	Thank you for you're help. I'll keep trying. Worst case scenario I guess I can always reinstall 8.04. That works on my other machine. Thanks again.
