2004-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	koko775		<--trying to get azureus installed
2004-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	koko775		the computer can certainly tell
2004-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	koko775		it isn't a comprehensive test, of course
2004-11-24T13:33:00.000Z	koko775		i went to java.sun.com
2004-11-24T13:33:00.000Z	koko775		but i'm not sure how to install it
2004-11-24T13:33:00.000Z	koko775		the bin just extracted stuff
2004-11-24T13:34:00.000Z	visor	koko775	just install the bin, symlink the java binary and the plugin to the mozilla plugin directory and youre done
2004-11-24T13:34:00.000Z	visor	koko775	by default jre 1.5 installs on /usr/java so that'll do it
2004-11-24T13:35:00.000Z	visor	koko775	i did that
2004-11-24T13:35:00.000Z	visor	koko775	i run azureus very well
2004-11-24T13:35:00.000Z	visor	koko775	with jre 1.5
2004-11-24T13:37:00.000Z	visor	koko775	i guess you can pass something to the installer, for me /usr/java is better
2004-11-24T13:41:00.000Z	visor	koko775	hey, did you installed it in the default prefix?
2004-11-24T13:44:00.000Z	visor	koko775	i did nothing and azureus ran well
2004-11-24T13:44:00.000Z	koko775	visor	well
2004-11-24T13:44:00.000Z	visor	koko775	azureus has a shell script wich looks for the java bin in /usr/java
2004-11-24T13:44:00.000Z	visor	koko775	what file youre opening?
2004-11-24T13:46:00.000Z	visor	koko775	thats not
2004-11-24T13:46:00.000Z	visor	koko775	the one
2004-11-24T13:46:00.000Z	visor	koko775	you should open the shell script, not the jar directly
2004-11-24T13:48:00.000Z	visor	koko775	well something maybe that has to do with libraries, i have warthy
