2006-10-22T15:58:00.000Z	wweasel		macrosoft: uhhh...I'm trying to think what could cause that
2006-10-22T15:59:00.000Z	wweasel		macrosoft: do you know what dependency issues you are having?
2006-10-22T15:59:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	ubuntu-desktop: Depends: lftp but it is not installed
2006-10-22T16:00:00.000Z	wweasel		macrosoft: For what reason did you uninstall lftp? Do you want to reinstall it?
2006-10-22T16:00:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	i never uninstalled it
2006-10-23T16:01:00.000Z	wweasel	marcrosoft	alright. Well, there seems to be an error with it somehow. Try reinstalling it.
2006-10-23T16:02:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	the first error message that i posted is that is happening when i try to reinstall lftp
2006-10-23T16:03:00.000Z	wweasel	marcrosoft	try "sudo apt-get install --reinstall lftp" tell me what it does
2006-10-23T16:04:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	dpkg: parse error, in file `/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 3232 package `lftp':
2006-10-23T16:04:00.000Z	marcrosoft		 missing version
2006-10-23T16:04:00.000Z	marcrosoft		E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)
2006-10-23T16:05:00.000Z	wweasel	marcrosoft	ok, same thing. I am not an expert in this, so I am trying to look it up
2006-10-23T16:06:00.000Z	wweasel	marcrosoft	I found this: http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/faq.en.html#comp-general.dpkg-parse-error
2006-10-23T16:08:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	ok, going to try that
2006-10-23T16:09:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	that messed it up worse
2006-10-23T16:09:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	getting Segmentation fault (core dumped) ... now for anything to do with apt
2006-10-23T16:10:00.000Z	wweasel	marcrosoft	Crap. I didn't want to suggest that straight off because it was slightly different from your error message. Did you make a backup of your original file before overwriting it?
2006-10-23T16:11:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	normally i do.. but i didn't think it would mess it up that badly
2006-10-23T16:12:00.000Z	wweasel	marcrosoft	erg..I don't know what to tell you and I wish I could help, but that's uncharted territory for me.
2006-10-23T16:12:00.000Z	marcrosoft	wweasel	well thanks anyways..
2006-10-23T16:12:00.000Z	marcrosoft		brb
2006-10-23T16:14:00.000Z	wweasel	marcrosoft	Hold up a sec, it seems like that shouldn't have changed anything. Fink (the software the link I sent you was about) is for Mac OS X. /sw/var etc. doesn't exist. so if you followed the "solution" it proposed, it shouldn't have changed anything on your computer
