2008-03-31T19:19:00.000Z	unop	hischild	man kill :)
2008-03-31T19:19:00.000Z	hischild	unop	i didn't even know what program to use for it :P besides, ljl is very helpful today ;-)
2008-03-31T19:21:00.000Z	unop	hischild	man renice :)
2008-03-31T21:37:00.000Z	unop	hischild	use the --no-desktop option
2008-03-31T21:38:00.000Z	unop	hischild	man nautilus :)
2008-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	hischild	unop	tried it and then it just doesn't do anything
2008-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	unop	hischild	errm, nautilus --no-desktop /path/to/dir/  # works a charm here
2008-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	hischild	unop	odd ...
2008-03-31T21:39:00.000Z	hischild	unop	i'll try to see why it is refusing here then
2008-03-31T21:40:00.000Z	unop	hischild	maybe add --browser too .. nautilus --browser --no-desktop /path/
2008-03-31T21:40:00.000Z	hischild	unop	alright, let me try it
2008-03-31T21:42:00.000Z	hischild	unop	thing i found a problem which is why it doesn't do anything ... it just won't do anything, even without options at all
2008-04-05T13:47:00.000Z	unop	hischild	you could use file -s on the device . file -s /dev/sda1
2008-04-05T13:47:00.000Z	hischild	unop	i know but i prefer to give him GUI tools on it.
2008-04-05T13:47:00.000Z	unop	hischild	ahh ok
2008-04-05T13:55:00.000Z	hischild	unop	pajamian: you can start synaptic without sudo. You can mark stuff, change stuff, but can't apply those changes, yet you can only export them.
2008-05-02T21:48:00.000Z	unop	hischild	errm, some versions of unix allow -20 too
2008-05-02T21:48:00.000Z	hischild	unop	yeah, but it's about which value is higher or lower priority. Negative means higher right?
2008-05-02T21:49:00.000Z	unop	hischild	right -20 (is allowed on linux too) is the highest while +20 is the lowest
2008-05-02T21:50:00.000Z	hischild	unop	thank you.
2008-07-29T13:57:00.000Z	unop	hischild	otherway around.
2008-07-29T13:57:00.000Z	hischild	unop	^
