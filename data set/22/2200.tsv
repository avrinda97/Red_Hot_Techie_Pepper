2009-09-02T18:46:00.000Z	cmp		first of all you dont have right to tell me stop idleone
2009-09-02T18:46:00.000Z	cmp		also i must push to get the answer idleone
2009-09-02T18:47:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	only thing you push is being ignored
2009-11-11T15:11:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	speed up system for fast idling?
2009-11-11T15:17:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	since you're new to linux, go and use your system a while. if you see it slows down, come back and ask again (you won't)
2009-11-11T15:19:00.000Z	cmp	llutz	, iam using it for about 6 months now - and i mentioned that its slowing down by time - iam sure that there is some way to change something like RegEdit in XP which can make your OS faster
2009-11-11T15:20:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	it isn't. check dmesg and other logs for errors
2009-11-11T15:20:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	linux != windows
2009-11-11T15:22:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	"dmesg|less" and try learning to translate what you see
2009-11-11T15:22:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	and check your attitude here please
2009-11-11T15:24:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	no i had to learn all that too, about 15 yrs ago
2009-11-11T15:24:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	using linux means reading/learning, nothing else
2009-11-11T15:25:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	you have all ressources you need, called internet today
2009-11-11T15:26:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	not to argue with whining kids EOD
2009-12-02T16:10:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	 youtube-dl
2009-12-02T16:10:00.000Z	llutz	cmp	and stop talking to the bot. it's a bot, just a bot
2009-12-02T16:13:00.000Z	cmp	llutz	i dont know what are you talking about and i dont care if its bot or not - i really got pissed off by this people who are showing off here - and i got really bored by this linux system - and the only reason for keeping me working on it thats is more safe
