2008-02-03T07:57:00.000Z	jfkdsljio		what about kde or gnome, whats better?
2008-02-03T07:58:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	Gnome has less bloat, KDE has more features.
2008-02-03T08:12:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	I use CrossOver Office.
2008-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	jfkdsljio	K_Nine	I don't like that app, its too far behind wine .9.54
2008-02-03T08:14:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	There must be a reason for it. You have to pay for it. It must do something that wine won't.
2008-02-03T08:15:00.000Z	jfkdsljio	K_Nine	it has perfected code for a small range of applications, whereas wine focuses on implementing the full windows API.
2008-02-03T08:15:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	I used it for Photoshop.
2008-02-03T08:16:00.000Z	jfkdsljio	K_Nine	what version?
2008-02-03T08:17:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	It will only go up to 7. I have CS3 extended on the Windoze machine.
2008-02-03T08:17:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	After 7, you need an XP emulator.
2008-02-03T08:18:00.000Z	jfkdsljio	K_Nine	if you install wine .9.54 you can install Photoshop CS2.
2008-02-03T08:18:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	Neat. I'll have to try that out. thx.
2008-02-03T08:18:00.000Z	jfkdsljio	K_Nine	yeah, It was listed as "gold" on appdb, but the things reported not working work great for me, on Mint Linux.
2008-02-03T08:34:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	I just did a wine --version in a terminal and I have 9.46. So I'll try CS2 tomorrow.
2008-02-03T08:41:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	Can it be downloaded?
2008-02-03T08:41:00.000Z	jfkdsljio	K_Nine	I dunno I installed alsa on sidux and alsaconf came with it.
2008-02-03T08:47:00.000Z	K_Nine	jfkdsljio	 Here is why they removed alsaconf from ubuntu. https://bugs.launchpad.net/alsa-utils/+bug/29597
