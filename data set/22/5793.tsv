2007-12-19T09:11:00.000Z	Quiane		hey everyone
2007-12-19T09:11:00.000Z	Quiane		i've got a torrent question to pose to anyone listening
2007-12-19T09:12:00.000Z	Quiane		okay....here is the deal..i'm running gutsy...and deluge.  ports have been forwarded..no firewall is running...i get about 30k/s download..but i should be getting up to 500k
2007-12-19T09:13:00.000Z	Quiane		i've read all about port forwarding..i think it's an update of gutsy...
2007-12-19T09:13:00.000Z	verb3k	Quiane	it depends on the number of seeds and peers
2007-12-19T09:13:00.000Z	Quiane		but i can't nail it down...
2007-12-19T09:13:00.000Z	Quiane		yeah..i've got too ratio's
2007-12-19T09:13:00.000Z	Quiane		on the same torrent i was getting speeds of 90+ kps...
2007-12-19T09:13:00.000Z	Quiane		then i restarted
2007-12-19T09:14:00.000Z	verb3k	Quiane	if there are 100 seeds and 500 peers, it won't be that fast
2007-12-19T09:14:00.000Z	Quiane		can't break the 40k
2007-12-19T09:14:00.000Z	Quiane		10 seeds, 28 peers 24kps
2007-12-19T09:14:00.000Z	verb3k	Quiane	should be slow XD
2007-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	Quiane		hmm..nothing? i know about torrents...these are not the speeds i should be getting
2007-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	verb3k	Quiane	to know if the problem is from that file or not, try downloading ubuntu torrent and see the difference
2007-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	Quiane	ubuntu	torrent? like the default bittorrent client?
2007-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	Quiane		i've tried azerus, ktorrent and deluge
2007-12-19T09:16:00.000Z	verb3k	Quiane	no no ...I mean download the ubuntu ISO from the official torrent
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	Quiane		i have learned about port forwarding and nat..as far as i can tell it's all forwarded..iptables is disabled...the port is open
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	Quiane		upnp is running
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	Quiane		by all accounts i should have good speeds..that's why i'm in here
2007-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	verb3k	Quiane	just try and see http://releases.ubuntu.com
