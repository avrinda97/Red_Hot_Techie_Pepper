2012-01-02T10:06:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	Oh i didnt see you lols ^^
2012-01-02T10:07:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	So are you able to get a connection over ethernet or wireless?
2012-01-02T10:08:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	you need to find out what card you have
2012-01-02T10:08:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	Theres a command you can type that will tell you the name, unfortunetly im not sure of it. i just started linux yesterday
2012-01-02T10:09:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	are you duel booting back and forth or are you on a 2nd PC?
2012-01-02T10:10:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu?
2012-01-02T10:13:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	Kay, I have some instructions for installing your card on debian, i think. I dont think anyone here would aprove of debian instructions but :P Lols
2012-01-02T10:15:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	Actually, before i say this, take into account that i have no fckn clue what im talking about. try "sudo modprobe -r ath5k" followed by "sudo modprobe ath_pci"?
2012-01-02T10:17:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	Well... Sorry about your luck lol. There's this http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/ath_pci#Lenny but
2012-01-02T10:17:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	It's debian instructions, i dont think ubuntu even comes with apptitude
2012-01-02T10:21:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	Dont care of i send you risky, bad advice? :o Lols
2012-01-02T10:25:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	i may have another idea
2012-01-02T10:25:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	it DOES have internet access yes?
2012-01-02T10:26:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	http://wiki.debian.org/ath5k#Installation
2012-01-02T10:26:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	I think ur solution is right there. change a bit to fit ubuntu instead of debian, but thats it i think
2012-01-02T10:28:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	"sudo apt-get linux-backports-modules-intrepid"
2012-01-02T10:28:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Atheros
2012-01-02T10:29:00.000Z	Bunie	thomedy	Theres an actual Ubuntu documentation on your driver. a bit dated, but may work.
