2010-04-09T19:40:00.000Z	Insomniaque		And my Windows 7 laptop asploded. =P
2010-04-09T19:41:00.000Z	Insomniaque		The bigger question is can the desktop be reasonably fixed.
2010-04-09T19:41:00.000Z	Insomniaque		I couldn't find the problem with it after a year of trying to figure it out.
2010-04-09T19:42:00.000Z	Insomniaque		SOmething else is, causing the CD burner to not work.
2010-04-09T19:42:00.000Z	Insomniaque		=P
2010-04-09T19:42:00.000Z	Insomniaque		Have my USB drives don't work, my PC thinks my proc is 1GHz when it's 2
2010-04-09T19:42:00.000Z	Insomniaque		Half*
2010-04-09T19:43:00.000Z	Insomniaque		I'll see if I can just get a CD and burn it from my mom's laptop.
2010-04-09T19:43:00.000Z	Insomniaque		Though she thinks I put keyloggers and spyware on her computer when I'm fixing it. =P
2010-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	Insomniaque		Not to mention, I got a ton of segfaults the other day, ran memtest 86+ and got over 14million erros, ran it a second time and got no errors.
2010-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	chao06	Insomniaque	maybe try a different distro... i've had computers that have completely different problems with different distros...
2010-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	Insomniaque	chao06	You should have seen it on Windows. -_-'
2010-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	Insomniaque		Linux Mint worked, Backtrack sucks, I want Ubuntu. =P
2010-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	chao06	Insomniaque	yeah, like windows ever works lol
2010-04-09T19:45:00.000Z	Insomniaque	chao06	Haha, my comptuer would freeze when I tried to do anything with a .msc, (and frozen at any other point too.)
2010-04-09T19:45:00.000Z	chao06	Insomniaque	have you tried any non-Debian based distros?
2010-04-09T19:46:00.000Z	Insomniaque	chao06	Thought about trying Gentoo, Mandriva or Arch.
2010-04-09T19:46:00.000Z	Insomniaque		But I'm not sure.
2010-04-09T19:46:00.000Z	Insomniaque		Mandriva annoyed me since it became... not open-source or something?
2010-04-09T19:46:00.000Z	Insomniaque		I remember there was something weird about it. Arch sounds interesting and my friend swears by it (and it's ability to install from git repos.)
2010-04-09T19:46:00.000Z	Insomniaque		Gentoo sounds neat too, but I don't know anything about it.
2010-04-09T19:47:00.000Z	chao06	Insomniaque	arch is very nice if you can get it to work right... haven't tried gentoo... and i've been thoroughly unhappy with any rpm distro i've tried
