2010-09-02T23:26:00.000Z	felicity		if i sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, will that upgrade my kernel as well?
2010-09-02T23:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	What version of Ubuntu are you on?
2010-09-02T23:26:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	karmic
2010-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	ok 9.10 is still supported untill the end of April next year,  but yes if you upgrade to 10.04
2010-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	you also get a later kernel
2010-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	thanks
2010-09-02T23:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	in certain ways 9.10 is the better release, but this is personal opinion as well
2010-09-02T23:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	Why do you want to upgrade the kernel anyway?  I mean whats wrong with the 9.10 kernel?
2010-09-02T23:28:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	you think so?hmm, i was having problems with my alsa so i decided to upgrade.will see, i still have the iso around just in case
2010-09-02T23:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	also not properly supported, but you could probably find a ppa for a later kernel, that you could install into 9.10
2010-09-02T23:29:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	will have a look.its been 3 years since i used ubuntu,so am a little rusty
2010-09-02T23:30:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	my alsa however, it kept "forgetting" my sound levels even after an alsactl store!
2010-09-02T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	oh you been doing stuff with alsamixer?
2010-09-02T23:31:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	yes.and now, my sound is always "going" and i have to reset it, eh
2010-09-02T23:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	I have this issue with another distro, but doesn't bother me that much, since using alsamixer is easy
2010-09-02T23:32:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	i know, i just thought maybe it'll solve it for me, gave me quite the scare
2010-09-02T23:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	gave you quite the scare?
2010-09-02T23:33:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	yes, as in it freaked me out!lol
2010-09-02T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	how so?
2010-09-02T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	upgrading the kernel probably won't really help much with an alsa issue, if at all, by the way
2010-09-02T23:35:00.000Z	felicity	sebsebseb	oh snap! well it used to work with arch linux so i thought the same would happen.well i'll see and i'll come ask for help after i get tired of googling
2010-09-02T23:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	felicity	Ubuntu since 8.04 uses pulseaudio by default, but I assume you disabled that and are using alsa instead?   You could upgrade to 10.04, but I have a feeling that won't be of much help for your issue either, but it might be, so worth a try I guess.
