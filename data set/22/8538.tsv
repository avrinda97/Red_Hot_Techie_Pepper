2005-09-08T11:30:00.000Z	Alia26		Hi.. Can i get some help? Last night i installed ubuntu from the official cd. I got alot of Trying to fix it, but a reboot is needed. A friend of me told me to run memtest86 to see if there was some problems with my ram. If i'm gonna run memtest86 from the livecd. what do i type on the boot: line?
2005-09-08T11:32:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	if you installed, grub should give you a memtest boot option
2005-09-08T11:32:00.000Z	Alia26	brenner	hmm.. so i don't need a livecd?
2005-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	well, _i_ have a memtest boot option
2005-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	Alia26	brenner	hoary, right?
2005-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	not sure how you would run memtest through live anyways
2005-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	correct
2005-09-08T11:34:00.000Z	Alia26	brenner	hmm this is odd. how do i operate memtest then?
2005-09-08T11:35:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	you chose the boot option in grub?
2005-09-08T11:38:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	what does the config look like in menu.lst?
2005-09-08T11:42:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	i have this:  title          Ubuntu, kernel memtest86+ <newline> root           (hd0,2) <newline> kernel         /boot/memtest86+.bin <newline> boot
2005-09-08T11:42:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	you might need to change the (hd0,2) line
2005-09-08T11:42:00.000Z	Alia26	brenner	how?
2005-09-08T11:44:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	i thought you get nothing when you ran it?
2005-09-08T11:45:00.000Z	Alia26	brenner	when i installed source i got Trying to fix it, but a reboot is needed
2005-09-08T11:46:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	er, and a reboot doesn't fix it?
2005-09-08T11:47:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	er, what programs?
2005-09-08T11:48:00.000Z	Alia26	brenner	if i'm gonna reinstall all packages again, how do i do that?
2005-09-08T11:49:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	if lots of programs are crashing on you... i don't see how reinstalling would fix things..like your friend said, try and do a memtest
2005-09-08T11:50:00.000Z	Alia26	brenner	I am trying to do so, but you seem to ignore me. I need help on how to do so.
2005-09-08T11:50:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	not ignoring....just a little confused...sorry.   ok, so running memtest gives you a blank screen?
2005-09-08T11:56:00.000Z	brenner	Alia26	googling...i'm not sure if that's an error, or if so...what it means
