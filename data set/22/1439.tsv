2010-05-14T15:08:00.000Z	circuitman		how to how to configure firefox to setup a proxy server
2010-05-14T15:08:00.000Z	circuitman		i installed the squid,but dont know how to configure the browser
2010-05-14T15:08:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	edit->preferences->advanced->network
2010-05-14T15:09:00.000Z	Orteko		and then you want the "connection settings"
2010-05-14T15:09:00.000Z	Orteko		which should let you put in a proxy
2010-05-14T15:10:00.000Z	circuitman	Orteko	ya,i know that.but about the proxy address,url and other things
2010-05-14T15:10:00.000Z	Orteko		well that depends on how & where you have set up the proxy :)
2010-05-14T15:10:00.000Z	Orteko		is it another machine?
2010-05-14T15:10:00.000Z	Orteko		or locally?
2010-05-14T15:13:00.000Z	circuitman		Orteko:i cant understand.all i want is to use proxy server to speed up my internet access
2010-05-14T15:14:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	in that case the best option is to use your isp's proxy server if they have one
2010-05-14T15:14:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	if you check their website it should have information about it if they have one
2010-05-14T15:14:00.000Z	circuitman		Orteko:i dont know if my ISP provider has a proxy server
2010-05-14T15:15:00.000Z	circuitman		Orteko:i think they dont have one
2010-05-14T15:15:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	if they don't have one you could set one up locally, but if you are the only one using it there isn't going to be very much benefit
2010-05-14T15:16:00.000Z	Orteko		all it will do is cache information that you've already accessed, and that information will probably still be in your firefox cache next time anyway
2010-05-14T15:17:00.000Z	circuitman		Orteko:i'm the only one who's going to use it. nobody is connected to my network
2010-05-14T15:18:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	not really a lot of point in having one then, it would probably be far simpler to just increase the size of your cache in firefox
2010-05-14T15:18:00.000Z	circuitman		Orteko:so the proxy server is of no use to me
2010-05-14T15:19:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	correct - with only one person using it, it's not much use.
2010-05-14T15:20:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	just goto edit->preferences->advanced->network and increase your disk space size for caching
2010-05-14T15:20:00.000Z	Orteko	circuitman	it will have much the same effect
