2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	domi007		action: i would like to use remote desktop from my  pda to control my ubuntu pc
2010-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	did u enable the RDP
2010-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	whats the problem then
2010-01-20T04:22:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	did you goto internet > then remote desktop viewer? normally it will display the name of the PC there automatically without having to type in the address, it should scann for open ports 5900
2010-01-20T04:23:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	okay... sorry, did u try using the web browser based UI?
2010-01-20T04:24:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	type the IP of the rdp server with :5900 into the browser
2010-01-20T04:25:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	hmm usb connection? so does the PDA get an IP address on the same subnet etc as the server?
2010-01-20T04:27:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	i dont really know how that "activesync" stuff works
2010-01-20T04:28:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	see this thread, it will explain how to get an IP address over ActiveSync, you need to use "VxUtil" http://www.geekzone.co.nz/forums.asp?ForumId=6&TopicId=2556
2010-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	the first step would be to try pinging the program outside of this activesync software, but like ActionParsnip__ i dont know much about this either
2010-01-20T04:32:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	does it ping?
2010-01-20T04:33:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	okay, well you may want to set up an IP bridge
2010-01-20T04:35:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	domi007	good luck, some hacking of the PDA may be involved in that
