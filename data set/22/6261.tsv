2012-06-09T00:33:00.000Z	Jordan__		Damn.. that didn't work either. Still hangs forever at SYSLINUX.
2012-06-09T00:34:00.000Z	Jordan__		I don't think the problem is getting an OK image on a stick. I think it's with whatever happens afterward ;-;
2012-06-09T00:36:00.000Z	Jordan__		So.. does anybody have suggestions? My netbook seems to refuse to use any ubuntu installer made by unetbootin lili or UUI. Always hangs at SYSLINUX
2012-06-09T00:36:00.000Z	Jordan__		I've tried formatting it as everything, exFat, FAT32, NTFS.. couldn't get anything to work.
2012-06-09T00:38:00.000Z	Jordan__		Just install ubuntu on a new netbook. It's got windows, no cd drive, and seems to be allergix to linux.
2012-06-09T00:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	I would recommend trying to use grub instead of syslinux.
2012-06-09T00:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	Do you have any machine that you can boot GNU/Linux from (even from a LiveCD/USB)?
2012-06-09T00:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	Then you can use that machine to install grub to the flash drive.
2012-06-09T00:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	Since you're getting to thhe point that you see a message from syslinux, the problem is not a missing boot flag.
2012-06-09T00:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	If you'd like to try grub ping me.
2012-06-09T00:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	No.
2012-06-09T02:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	Again, ping me if you want to try grub.
2012-06-09T02:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	It sounds like we'll be working from another computer booted via LiveUSB. Do you have more than one USB drive?
2012-06-09T02:34:00.000Z	Jordan__	Jordan_U	Sadly no I don't
2012-06-09T02:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	That's OK, that just means that if we fail the first time you'll have to re-run unetbootin (or whatever utility) to get back to a working Ubuntu environment agian.
2012-06-09T02:35:00.000Z	Jordan__	Jordan_U	Eh, no big deal
2012-06-09T02:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	Is your USB drive big enough to hold both the unextracted Ubuntu .iso file and the extracted (by unetbootin) version at the same time?
2012-06-09T02:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	OK. Create a directory called "boot-isos" on the USB drive and copy the Ubuntu iso file into that directory (as a file, do not extract it).
2012-06-09T02:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	Then boot from the USB drive and pastebin the output of "mount" and "grub-install --version".
2012-06-09T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan__	Jordan_U	Where would I enter mount or grub install? I never have the option to do anything
2012-06-09T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan__	Jordan_U	It immediately freezes at that syslinux screen. I cannot input anything
2012-06-09T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jordan__	This is all instructions for you to follow on another machine, to make a bootable USB drive using grub.
