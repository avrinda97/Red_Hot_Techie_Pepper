2004-10-30T09:59:00.000Z	CraHan		hi, something I discovered just the other day
2004-10-30T10:00:00.000Z	CraHan		in gnome, when inserting a cd it doesn't get automounted and shown on the desktop, but when I install debians gnome-volume-manager deb instead of ubuntus, it works fine
2004-10-30T10:00:00.000Z	CraHan		is gnome-volume-manager broken in ubuntu?  Cause I doublechecked and only the debian version works here
2004-10-30T10:01:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	do you use an USB CD-ROM?
2004-10-30T10:01:00.000Z	CraHan	pitti	no the builtin cdrom
2004-10-30T10:01:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	so the CD-ROM is not in /etc/fstab?
2004-10-30T10:02:00.000Z	CraHan	pitti	yes it is
2004-10-30T10:02:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	pmount /dev/whatever fails, I guess
2004-10-30T10:02:00.000Z	CraHan	pitti	when I click on the cdrom icon in nautilus; it'll mount it
2004-10-30T10:02:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	oh, even with the Ubuntu g-v-m package?
2004-10-30T10:02:00.000Z	CraHan	pitti	yes
2004-10-30T10:02:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	ah, I know what could be wrong
2004-10-30T10:03:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	can you please look in device manager (or lshal) whether media_check_enabled is true for the CD-ROM?
2004-10-30T10:04:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	we have a similar bug https://bugzilla.ubuntulinux.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2265
2004-10-30T10:07:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	plese use the Ubuntu version of g-v-m and check again
2004-10-30T10:07:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	we have a meeting now, can you please return to me in about an hour?
2004-10-30T11:45:00.000Z	CraHan	pitti	are you back from that meeting?
2004-10-30T11:46:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	still running
2004-10-30T11:46:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	but I currently can't contribute much
2004-10-30T11:46:00.000Z	pitti	CraHan	any news?
