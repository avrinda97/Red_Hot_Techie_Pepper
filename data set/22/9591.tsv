2004-09-05T09:30:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	What does "Totally Rad Laptop Support" actually involve?
2004-09-05T09:36:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	currently, laptop mode, some acpi stuff that doesn't send machines to sleep permanently, etc
2004-09-05T10:14:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	ipw2{1,2}00 you mean? we will do
2004-09-05T10:14:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	yeah
2004-09-06T09:52:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	What happened to the dreadful laptops?
2004-09-06T09:55:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	Ultra-rad laptop support should include netapplet
2004-09-06T09:55:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	i was thinking that
2004-09-06T10:13:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	3D failure?
2004-09-07T15:57:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	you have debian support for network manager? where? :-)
2004-09-07T15:57:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	Should be in CVS
2004-09-11T13:18:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	Found a laptop without ACPI or a dmi table
2004-09-11T15:08:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	I have an "interesting" laptop for you
2004-09-11T15:08:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	yeah, that looked kinda scary
2004-09-11T15:08:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	what is it?
2004-09-11T15:08:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	It's a Digital Hinote - circa 1997, at a guess
2004-09-11T15:10:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	seems a reasonable move
2004-09-25T16:15:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	But we all know that jdub is Australian and therefore wrong
2004-09-26T06:20:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	You know you can just hit F11 on boot and choose the boot device you want?
2004-09-26T06:24:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	yeah, but that still takes longer than stopping the dhcp server :-)
2004-09-26T12:43:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	Dude, why isn't laptop-detect arch:all?
2004-09-26T12:43:00.000Z	thom	mjg59	arch specific dependencies
2004-10-02T08:58:00.000Z	mjg59	thom	Or that the driver wasn't loaded
