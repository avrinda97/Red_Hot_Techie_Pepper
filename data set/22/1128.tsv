2010-09-30T20:29:00.000Z	krisphillips		Yeah, chances are, all you need to do is reinstall GRUB to the Master Boot Record
2010-09-30T20:29:00.000Z	krisphillips		and have it redetect the partitions
2010-09-30T20:30:00.000Z	krisphillips		Now, does anyone know how to keep usb from sleeping using acpi or something similar
2010-09-30T20:30:00.000Z	krisphillips		I need to let the machine still sleep, but keep the usb ports alive
2010-09-30T20:30:00.000Z	krisphillips		or restart all the usb ports
2010-09-30T20:30:00.000Z	krisphillips		or SOMETHING
2010-09-30T20:31:00.000Z	krisphillips		because my keyboard and mouse don't work after coming out of sleep sometimes
2010-09-30T20:31:00.000Z	krisphillips		ANYBODY!?!?!  Gosh, I feel like I'm talking to a wall
2010-09-30T20:32:00.000Z	krisphillips		!repeat
2010-09-30T20:33:00.000Z	krisphillips		I don't understand why disabling usb sleep is such a hard task for anyone to have any advice what so ever
2010-09-30T20:33:00.000Z	jrib	krisphillips	not sure what you think... do you think we know but are purposefully ignoring you?
2010-09-30T20:34:00.000Z	krisphillips		I think that I would rather have someone say they aren't sure, but you COULD try thi
2010-09-30T20:34:00.000Z	krisphillips		or SOMETHING
2010-09-30T20:34:00.000Z	krisphillips		I mean, I don't care if your idea makes no sense at all
2010-09-30T20:34:00.000Z	krisphillips		I just wish someone would help me bounce ideas on how to fix my problem instead of just letting me ask the same questions over and over
2010-09-30T20:34:00.000Z	jrib	krisphillips	if no one answers you, it means we don't know.  It doesn't make sense for 1000 people to say "I don't know"
2010-09-30T20:35:00.000Z	jrib	krisphillips	try giving more details, rephrasing your question, etc.  I have no clue what "usb sleep" is
2010-09-30T20:36:00.000Z	krisphillips	jrib	Well, basically, what happens is when the monitor goes to sleep, so does the machine.  Its the timeout at the log on screen that makes the computer sleep and turn off the monitor, drive, etc.  I need to let the machine continue to go to sleep so that the screen doesn't burn in, but the keyboard and mouse don't reinitialize sometimes when the computer wakes up.
2010-09-30T20:37:00.000Z	krisphillips		So I need to let everything sleep but the USB ports
2010-09-30T20:37:00.000Z	krisphillips		Which I know is possible, because Windows has an option for it.  HOWEVER, linux is so stuck on command line that solving an issue like this is entirely hack and slash, it feels like
2010-09-30T20:37:00.000Z	jrib	krisphillips	check bugs.ubuntu.com for an existing bug.  I had something similar happen to my touchpad on my macbook a few releases ago.  The workaround was to remove and then modprobe the relevant module, but the bug has since been fixed
2010-09-30T20:38:00.000Z	krisphillips	jrib	I tried removing the module for the usbhid to see if it fixes it, however, ubuntu 10.04 doesn't like that.  It doesn't reinitialize the usb devices when I reinsert the module
