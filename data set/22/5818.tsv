2007-03-04T10:10:00.000Z	riaal		what is the difference between kubuntu and ubuntu? =S
2007-03-04T10:10:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	Kubuntu uses the KDE 3 GUI, while Ubuntu uses GNOME
2007-03-04T10:10:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	There are different GUI programs that run on each.  Like Ubuntu has the Synaptic Package Manager, and Kubuntu has Adept Package Manager
2007-03-04T10:12:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	oh okey, bacecly the "graphical engine"?
2007-03-04T10:12:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	Mostly.  The kernel and most of the command line apps are the same
2007-03-04T10:12:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	I tell people to choose based on the cosmetic difference.  So whatever is more appealing to your eyeball is probably good for you
2007-03-04T10:14:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	Im using ubuntu, but when I was going to download Amarok, it said "for kubuntu"
2007-03-04T10:14:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	Can I use it whit ubuntu 2?
2007-03-04T10:15:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	I don't think so.  It looks like it's a KDE application
2007-03-04T10:15:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	okey, thanks for the help mate
2007-03-04T10:15:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	Something you can do though, is if you want, install the kubuntu-desktop package, which installs KDE
2007-03-04T10:16:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	sounds difficult?
2007-03-04T10:17:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	It's really not difficult
2007-03-04T10:17:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	will it slow down everything or messup something? =P
2007-03-04T10:17:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	It will take up some memory, but you can choose which GUI to use when you login
2007-03-04T10:18:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	in a terminal: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-03-04T10:18:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	wow, thats sounds relly cool, what about my programs etc.?
2007-03-04T10:19:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	The only problem with installing more than one destkop is that the menu buttons from both desktops will be included in the menu when you are using one of them
2007-03-04T10:19:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	But the last time I did it I could run KDE and GNOME apps on either of them, since the right stuff was there
2007-03-04T10:19:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	oh, witch one do you use?
2007-03-04T10:20:00.000Z	ingrix	riaal	I prefer GNOME
2007-03-04T10:20:00.000Z	riaal	ingrix	think I will stick to it for a while as im new to this, thanks for the help!
