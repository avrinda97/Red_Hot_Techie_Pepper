2005-08-06T06:42:00.000Z	pvanhoof		there's a new series of xfont related packages in my upgrade queue
2005-08-06T06:42:00.000Z	pvanhoof		do they mean that mkfontdir is now installed?
2005-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	breezy?
2005-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	ah, well enjoy yourself ;) I'm sticking with hoary for a while
2005-08-06T06:44:00.000Z	pvanhoof	thoreauputic	I managed to fix my breezy. But I'd prefer breezy not to start fooling around with the fix OR have the packaged fully worked before upgrading :)
2005-08-06T06:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	why not use the -d switch to apt-get to just download the packages?
2005-08-06T06:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	*shrug* at least you could look at the packages
2005-08-06T06:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	 dpkg -L <packagename>
2005-08-06T06:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	what are you doing messing with breezy without knowing that? :)
2005-08-06T06:47:00.000Z	pvanhoof	thoreauputic	bleh. I've been using many package systems etcetera. I don't remember every switch of all of them :)
2005-08-06T06:47:00.000Z	pvanhoof	thoreauputic	and asking here was the simple solution .. making you guys find it out for me ! :D
2005-08-06T06:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	*cough* that one is pretty basic
2005-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	he has 56k dialup :/
2005-08-28T07:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	he wants a local mirror i suppose
2005-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	pvanhoof	thoreauputic	so he wants canonical to send a new cd evertime they upgrade a package?
2005-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	no I think he means he will be getting bandwidth soon
2005-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	it's a bit hard to communicate :)
2005-08-28T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	surely canonical would be interested in helping an Indonesian Ubuntu promotion? It's ahuge country in population...
2005-08-28T07:19:00.000Z	pvanhoof	thoreauputic	if the gov is really serious about this, they would have given frans-th a huge amount of bandwidth
2005-08-28T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	well, i gather things move slowly in Indonesia :)
2005-08-28T07:20:00.000Z	pvanhoof	thoreauputic	you can't put an engineer on that job if you give him only a 56 kb modem
2005-08-28T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pvanhoof	of course
