2010-04-06T11:46:00.000Z	theadmin	robertzaccour	It's not like Ubuntu at all
2010-04-06T11:46:00.000Z	robertzaccour	theadmin	you tried it?
2010-04-06T11:46:00.000Z	theadmin	robertzaccour	Ahem, it's just not even debian-based if i recall correctly
2010-04-06T11:46:00.000Z	robertzaccour	theadmin	i thought it is debian based
2010-04-09T12:26:00.000Z	theadmin	robertzaccour	what about all those Jabber/Gtalk things? :P And Skype is huge anyway :/
2010-04-09T12:27:00.000Z	robertzaccour	theadmin	how is skype huge? seems to run pretty quick. it installs faster than almost anything
2010-04-09T12:27:00.000Z	theadmin	robertzaccour	Well, maybe it's just that i last tried it quite long ago

2010-05-11T12:29:00.000Z	robertzaccour	theadmin	i know that, just thought i'd enlighten him about one thats more user friendly so that he'd have LESS questions lol
2010-05-11T12:30:00.000Z	theadmin	robertzaccour	Maybe he doesn't have a X
