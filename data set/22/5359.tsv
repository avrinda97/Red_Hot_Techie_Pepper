2007-05-16T14:59:00.000Z	sokomizer		I want to configure ny graphics card and to adjust the resolution to 1400x900
2007-05-16T15:00:00.000Z	sokomizer		I've edited the xorg.conf file with the horizontal and vertical hz
2007-05-16T15:01:00.000Z	sokomizer		now I've got another question
2007-05-16T15:02:00.000Z	sokomizer		Whtn I start a session in Ubuntu, it doesn't recognize the mouse
2007-05-16T15:02:00.000Z	sokomizer		sometimes it works but...
2007-05-16T15:02:00.000Z	dappis	sokomizer	what kind of mouse?
2007-05-16T15:02:00.000Z	sokomizer		it's a usb mouse
2007-05-16T15:03:00.000Z	sokomizer	johns^	yeah, I've tried with that, but It only works when I reboot or when I start Windows and then I go to ubuntu
2007-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	sokomizer		yes, I've installed Ubuntu 7.04
2007-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	sokomizer	johns^	yes
2007-05-16T15:05:00.000Z	dappis	sokomizer	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade
2007-05-16T15:06:00.000Z	sokomizer		I will try to update another time, but I think I've made that
2007-05-16T15:06:00.000Z	sokomizer		thanks anyway
2007-05-16T15:08:00.000Z	sokomizer		what about beryl in ubuntu 7.04, is easier to install than in 6.06?
2007-05-16T15:08:00.000Z	dappis	sokomizer	beryl is nice eye-candy, but it is always a risk
2007-05-16T15:08:00.000Z	sokomizer		I know is a risk
2007-05-16T15:09:00.000Z	sokomizer		I've installed it in 6.06 and I know that it has some important bugs but...
2007-05-16T15:09:00.000Z	sokomizer		Is compiz better than beryl?
2007-05-16T15:09:00.000Z	sokomizer		ok
2007-05-16T15:10:00.000Z	dappis	sokomizer	check ubuntuguide.org there 7.04 and search "eye candy"
