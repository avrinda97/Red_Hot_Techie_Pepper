2004-10-13T14:05:00.000Z	burner_		:)  mounting /dev/sda worked!!
2004-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	burner_		the whole reason I went to ubuntu was for gnome 2.8's auto picking up adn mounting usb drives though :\
2004-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	burner_		so i guess that's next steap
2004-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	burner_		step even
2004-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	burner_		i could
2004-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	burner_		but as long as I can mount /dev/sda, who cares
2004-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	burner_		awww
2004-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	burner_		well... i really have no idea how gnome works in terms of it's hal/dbus stuff, but it's worth a shot :)
2004-10-13T14:09:00.000Z	burner_		w00t :)
2004-10-13T14:09:00.000Z	burner_		i mounted /mnt/sda after putting in the fstab line... and i get an icon on the desktop that says 'usb0' now
2004-10-13T14:09:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	sda is the whole device, i made /dev/sda1 with fdisk, then it automounts
2004-10-13T14:10:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	yes :(
2004-10-13T14:10:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	so did I that was not the way to do it
2004-10-13T14:10:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	yes it works ok in windows
2004-10-13T14:11:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	if you use vfat
2004-10-13T14:12:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	no
2004-10-13T14:13:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	in time it will
2004-10-13T14:14:00.000Z	burner_	plovs	thanks for the help btw
2004-10-13T14:15:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	np
2004-10-13T14:36:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	usb doesn't work if it is not partitioned, it's a bug
2004-10-13T14:37:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	can you mount it by hand?
2004-10-13T14:38:00.000Z	plovs	burner_	then unmount, use fdisk to make a partition, pull it out, put it back in, make vfat partition, out again, in again and it will/should work
