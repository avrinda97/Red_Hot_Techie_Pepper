2007-03-03T07:05:00.000Z	agliv		Greetings all :) does anyone know of a good guide to mounting local HD from a LiveCD? or perhaps know the mount options off hand?
2007-03-03T07:07:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	what version are you using?
2007-03-03T07:13:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	of Ubuntu? 6.06
2007-03-03T07:14:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	yes, what was your problem?
2007-03-03T07:18:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	trying to mount my local HD from a liveCD... how do I list my local HD partitions... I'm not sure about the name... thought it was sda8 but mount is complaining...
2007-03-03T07:19:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	go to your system, administration, disk mangaer, got that far yet?
2007-03-03T07:20:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	device manager or disks?
2007-03-03T07:20:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	disks to mount it.
2007-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	for example, create you a folder on your desktop call mount, then within disks manager find your drive that you want to mount. then within the options select mount point, mount it to /home/yourname/Desktop/mount
2007-03-03T07:22:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	then mount it, easy.
2007-03-03T07:23:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	attempting now...
2007-03-03T07:29:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	thanx it seems to be working ;)
2007-03-03T07:36:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	good job agliv so what are you needing to do?
2007-03-03T07:37:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	that's a very long story... but at the moment I want to burn some data from the HD to a CD... currently trying to get k3b installed properly ;)
2007-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	k3b is alright, gnomebaker's good too
2007-03-03T07:39:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	I like k3b or nero4linux best... just have to work out all the dependencies ;)
2007-03-03T07:40:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	never tried nero4linux, do you know if that supports lightscribe?
2007-03-03T07:42:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	I'm sorry, I don't... have more expierence with k3b...
2007-03-03T07:42:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	i use k3b because it is sorta integrated with amarok.
2007-03-03T07:43:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	never heard of amarok...
2007-03-03T07:44:00.000Z	Jarhead756	agliv	its a music player, the best out there, if you like k3b, you'll love amarok, give it a try, but there are like 100mb of dependencies if you don't already have kde base
2007-03-03T07:47:00.000Z	agliv	Jarhead756	my sound card isn't working yet so I haven't looked into music players for my system...
