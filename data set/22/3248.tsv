2008-11-01T10:27:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	one sec pleae
2008-11-01T10:30:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	it appears that you have the same card as the eeepc and these instructions should work https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC/Fixes#Wireless
2008-11-01T10:31:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	was about to recommend ndiswrapper as well
2008-11-01T10:31:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	can you pastebin ifconfig -a please
2008-11-01T10:33:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	yep
2008-11-01T10:34:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	put it in #flood or pastebin.com
2008-11-01T10:35:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	yes, you are not allowed to post large blocks of text in this channel. Either put it in flood or pastebin.com
2008-11-01T10:36:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	okay there is no wireless devices there in ifconfig -a. You can try to fix ndiswrapper or remove it and follow the link I gave you earlier
2008-11-01T13:06:00.000Z	Petester	ziroday	are you here?
2008-11-01T13:07:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	for a short while, yep!
2008-11-03T17:00:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	a real shot in the dark, are the madwifi drivers loaded in lsmod?
2008-11-03T17:01:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	err not sure what its called, pastebin it please
2008-11-03T17:02:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	that, I believe shouldn't be running if you blacklisted ath5k but as I said, really really not sure
2008-11-03T17:03:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	is the line blacklist ath5k still in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2008-11-03T17:07:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	type in sudo rmmod ath9k, it seems ath5k still started
2008-11-03T17:09:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	try do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2008-11-03T17:11:00.000Z	ziroday	Petester	bummer, well that was my shot in the dark. Sorry
