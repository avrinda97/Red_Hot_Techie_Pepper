2008-03-11T18:49:00.000Z	faileas		the hell?
2008-03-11T18:49:00.000Z	faileas		there's no make file
2008-03-11T18:50:00.000Z	faileas		ok...i'm TOTALLY lost
2008-03-11T18:50:00.000Z	faileas		it looks like they have a binary driver, and instrutions for compilation
2008-03-11T18:51:00.000Z	faileas		only a bunch of .ko files
2008-03-11T18:51:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	what is this that you want to compile?
2008-03-11T18:51:00.000Z	faileas	mneptok	well, i'm trying to install drivers for a rt73 based wireless network card
2008-03-11T18:52:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	Debian drivers should work. have you tried them?
2008-03-11T18:53:00.000Z	faileas	mneptok	they are kernel modules. i was under the impression they are supposed to be compliled against mt kernel?
2008-03-11T18:53:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	you are correct
2008-03-11T18:53:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	what kind of card is this? PCI? Cardbus?
2008-03-11T18:53:00.000Z	faileas	mneptok	USB
2008-03-11T18:54:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	personally, with the hassle you will face, i'd get a supported adapter
2008-03-11T18:54:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	*every* time Ubuntu updates your kernel you'll need to recompile the drivers.
2008-03-11T18:54:00.000Z	faileas	mneptok	i got it cause i thought it was supported
2008-03-11T18:54:00.000Z	faileas	mneptok	i'm fine with that, actually
2008-03-11T18:55:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	does it need to be USB, or is PCI(Express) or Cardbus or PCMCIA OK?
2008-03-11T18:55:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	k
2008-03-11T19:00:00.000Z	mneptok	faileas	the USB sticks will be tricky. they are made with lowest common denominator hardware, which usuallt means Broadcom.
2008-03-11T19:00:00.000Z	faileas	mneptok	ubuntu detects it as a ralink, and it has drivers for linux on the
2008-03-11T19:01:00.000Z	faileas	mneptok	it has drivers for linux on the disk. obviously compiled by someone clueless ;p
