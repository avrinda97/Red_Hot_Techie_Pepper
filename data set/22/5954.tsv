2007-02-07T11:04:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 check the mod_userdir documentation for apache
2007-02-07T11:06:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_userdir.html
2007-02-07T11:36:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 i think you need to set /home/yancho/public_html to be execCGI for a .php file in that location to be executale
2007-02-07T11:37:00.000Z	Yancho	unop	from where pls shall i do that ? :)
2007-02-07T11:38:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#options
2007-02-07T11:39:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 edit the site config file and for the location directive of  /home/yancho/public_html (create one if it doesnt already exist) set the execcgi option in it
2007-02-09T15:12:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 what do you mean exactly?
2007-02-09T15:12:00.000Z	Yancho	unop	want to do this : http://cartoweb.org/cwiki/DebianPackages
2007-02-09T15:13:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 the instructions are there on the page .. arent you reading it? :)
2007-02-09T15:15:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 you arent reading it properly, slow down and make sure you undertand it well -- it says "To add in your /etc/apt/sources.list:" ... :)
2007-02-09T15:16:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	Yancho	unop	u have a clue about these errors pls? : http://www.pastebin.ca/346350
2007-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 I have a feeling that that repository you just added has packages that require odd version numbers (those for debian)
2007-02-09T15:31:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 well, have you installed any software yet from that repository?
2007-02-09T15:34:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	 ok cool,  I think all you need to do is install the map-server packages from this repo and everything else from ubuntu's repo -- comment out this line in sources.list, run apt-get update , install the ubuntu packages like apache, php, postgres etc .. and then add the line back and then install the mapserver packages
2008-03-22T21:14:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	can you paste again please?
2008-03-22T21:16:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	does the command work on sdb2 ?
2008-03-22T21:18:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	any luck with the command on /dev/sdb2 ???
2008-03-22T21:19:00.000Z	Yancho	unop	: no record for 'sdb2' in database (sorry i pasted without highlighting u)
2008-03-22T21:20:00.000Z	Yancho	unop	/ tanner / danand_ was thinking of updating the rule to this : SYSFS{serial}=="222262A50472",KERNEL=="sd*",SYMLINK+="usbhd%n"
2008-03-22T21:22:00.000Z	unop	Yancho	I would cut this down to simplicity to test whether it works -- maybe just SYSFS{serial}=="222262A50472"  for now
