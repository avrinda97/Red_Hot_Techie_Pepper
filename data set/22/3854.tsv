2008-05-12T17:29:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	are you refering to a commandline?
2008-05-12T17:29:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	Yes, search on ubuntu forums to 'rsync'
2008-05-12T17:32:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	i'm looking at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync. is this the right thing?
2008-05-12T17:34:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	take a look at http://howtoforge.com/mirroring_with_rsync
2008-05-12T17:34:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	i doubt that this works with FTP
2008-05-12T17:35:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	It uses ssh
2008-05-12T17:36:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	does using ssh mean being able to do it via FTP?
2008-05-12T17:37:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	No, why do u want ftp, ssh is fine and securer
2008-05-12T17:37:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	it'd be what i were using now if i can. for reasons too many to say, all I have right now is FTP..
2008-05-12T17:38:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	other possibility is subversion
2008-05-12T17:39:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	will this help u: http://howtoforge.com/ftp-backups-with-duplicity-ftplicity-debian-etch
2008-05-12T17:42:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	it will, eventually. thanks. but i'm looking tor sync tools to improve Web design workflow. so i could migrate the whole design process into Ubuntu purely. my company is currently using Adobe ColdFusion. I was wondering if I could have that same functionality in Ubuntu
2008-05-12T17:44:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	u still in here?
2008-05-12T17:49:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	Im still here, but as a company i should use subversion
2008-05-12T17:49:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	noted. i'm looking into it right now. thanks
2008-05-12T17:51:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	u need a subversion server, just search on ubuntu forums ;)
2008-05-12T17:53:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	turns out subversion has a room on this very channel, #svn.. checking out
2008-05-12T17:53:00.000Z	rutgermasi	babolat	what do u want to say with #svn?
2008-05-12T17:54:00.000Z	babolat	rutgermasi	ask,that's all. http://subversion.tigris.org/ is their website right?
