2008-09-13T13:08:00.000Z	dooglus	dr_willis	when I take screenshots, it puts them in ~/Desktop/.  firefox saves stuff there, etc.  I don't want to config every little app not to use Desktop - I just don't need to see little pictures of my files

2011-09-07T08:26:00.000Z	dooglus	dr_willis	it's a USB device - doesn't that mean it won't have a distinct kernel module?
