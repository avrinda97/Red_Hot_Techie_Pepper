2007-05-07T05:15:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	are you on feisty?
2007-05-07T05:16:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	yes, indeed
2007-05-07T05:18:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	maybe you haven't enables some repositories
2007-05-07T05:18:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	i've enabled all of them, including universe which is the one it's supposed to be in
2007-05-07T05:18:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	the kernel itself is even there, but not the restricted modules
2007-05-07T05:18:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	what mirror are you on?
2007-05-07T05:19:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	nah that would be too unlikely
2007-05-07T05:19:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	no.archive.ubuntu.com
2007-05-07T05:19:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	can you paste your sources.list to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-05-07T05:21:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19597/
2007-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	tried the main universe repo now, no difference, as expected
2007-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	it differs slightly from my original one from fresh install
2007-05-07T05:23:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	in any ways worth mentioning?
2007-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	weird, i haven't touched mine at all since the fresh install :/ i'll check it out now
2007-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	not sure, look yourself, I don't know how repos are handled. looks like those 2 multiverse lines are missing in yorus and sometjhing down below
2007-05-07T05:28:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	with your sources.list, i find the package. i'll try to find out what's wrong
2007-05-07T05:28:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	ok
2007-05-07T05:34:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	i don't get it, we've got the same repos and all, in a slightly different order, but still i need your setup to get the package
2007-05-07T05:35:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	maybe it is still the mirrors
2007-05-07T05:36:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	no it's not, i just think i'm misunderstanding the syntax of the file, seems i didn't have multiverse
2007-05-07T05:39:00.000Z	preglow	predaeus	thanks anyway
2007-05-07T05:40:00.000Z	predaeus	preglow	I only ticked all repositories in the update manager or where that was. maybe it not only uncomments them, but adds them. no idea
