2006-02-23T16:08:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Cryptid	did you try right clicking, configuring? and see if there was anything with dimensions?
2006-02-23T16:10:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	Cryptid	the boxes you see, are all supposed to be transparent. You maybe be able to set it or the size of the boxes in configurations.
2006-02-23T16:11:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha		but i doubt it. so then it can mean your video card isnt functioning properly, or you have an unstable version of gDesklets and i would uninstall and dl a new one
