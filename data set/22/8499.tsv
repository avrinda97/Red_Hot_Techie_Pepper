2007-10-30T23:11:00.000Z	albert_		tom i also need network/torrent related advice, if somebody could tell us where we could go to find out
2007-10-30T23:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	whatever client you use, the Azureus wiki has good torrent info
2007-10-30T23:14:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	im using two clients and have the same result which is that my upload speeds are zero altough my ports are open according to firestarter
2007-10-30T23:15:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	do you know another room where i might be able to get help?
2007-10-30T23:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	I assume your ports are properly forwarded etc. Does your ISP do evil things with bit torrent ?
2007-10-30T23:17:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	not that i know because i was getting excellent speeds on windows with azureus
2007-10-30T23:18:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	the only thing is that im not sure if i forwarded my ports correctly in linux, im using firestarter and im asuuming that opening the ports through firestarter is good enough
2007-10-30T23:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	 are you using UPNP ? I have found that manual port forwarding works best
2007-10-30T23:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	you need to make sure the ports are forwarded from your router
2007-10-30T23:19:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	no upnp is turned off in both clients, it has to be something in linux because its the same problem with two different torrent clients
2007-10-30T23:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	if your port forwarding is wrong, nothing will work, of course :)
2007-10-30T23:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	if you trun the firewall off ( clear iptables), does it work?
2007-10-30T23:21:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	how do i clear iptables
2007-10-30T23:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	 might be best to just turn the firewall off through firestarter
2007-10-30T23:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	if you aren't familiar with iptables
2007-10-30T23:23:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	yeah im still a linux newbie and because of that am not yet familiar with iptables
2007-10-30T23:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	sure - just use the firatarter front end GUI then
2007-10-30T23:25:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	ok turning it off isnt doing anything unfortutanetly for either client
2007-10-30T23:26:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	my download speeds are also not up to par but ill worry about that later. right now the thing thats bothering me is that my upload is not going at all
2007-10-30T23:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	if you are not uploading at all then it is almost certainly a port forwarding issue
2007-10-30T23:31:00.000Z	albert_	thoreauputic	yeah  well my router is set up as an accesspoint with NAT disabled and i therefore cant set up portfowarding on the router, could that be the problem
2007-10-30T23:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	albert_	yes :)
