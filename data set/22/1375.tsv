2010-06-03T14:59:00.000Z	levene_		I am trying to upgrade 8.10 to 9.04 with the Update Manager. The process appears to have stopped. It says it is "Getting new packages" and the progress bar is one pixel from completion, but it's been stuck like that for about ten minutes and there's no significant CPU activity. What should I do?
2010-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	levene_		see http://imagebin.ca/view/Pd-Bj48.html
2010-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	levene_		hm, OK
2010-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	levene_		the last activity in /var/log/dist-upgrade was 35 minutes ago...
2010-06-03T15:01:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	wait like 30 minutes to an hour....
2010-06-03T15:02:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	you'd be surprised
2010-06-03T15:03:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	it's always better to backup important data and do a full install from scratch
2010-06-03T15:04:00.000Z	levene_	ZachK_	define better. it takes a long time for me to get things working as i want each time i install from scratch. i was hoping the upgrade path would do all that for me
2010-06-03T15:04:00.000Z	levene_	ZachK_	it worked last time...
2010-06-03T15:05:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	well it installs a much more "Clean" system...Updating can cause a mess...much like sweeping the dirt under the rug instead of putting it in the trash can
2010-06-03T15:05:00.000Z	levene_	ZachK_	clean and less full-featured. yes.
2010-06-03T15:06:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	I can understand the reason for not wanting to do a full install but it's definitely better than an update
2010-06-03T15:07:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	not sure actually
2010-06-03T15:12:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	see? not so bad is it
2010-06-03T15:13:00.000Z	levene_	ZachK_	right. it shouldn't have hung, though
2010-06-03T15:13:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	it happens
2010-06-03T15:13:00.000Z	levene_	ZachK_	evidently. i'll be upgrading to 9.04 -> 9.10 -> 10.04. so i have lots of fun times ahead, it seems
2010-06-03T15:14:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	in that case i'd just do a full install man...
2010-06-03T15:14:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	that many upgrades can and most likely will cause an issue
2010-06-03T15:14:00.000Z	levene_	ZachK_	thing is, i also have non-ubuntu software in /opt which i want to keep
2010-06-03T15:16:00.000Z	levene_	ZachK_	well, i guess the worst that can happen is that things don't really work and i have to do a reinstall after the fact. but i reckon there's a reasonable chance that it will work as advertised. so i'll try it this way first
2010-06-03T15:16:00.000Z	ZachK_	levene_	alright...
