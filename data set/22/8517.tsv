2005-07-27T06:23:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	maybe try 'man syslogd'
2005-07-27T06:23:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	possibly the '-m interval' option
2005-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  Yeah it's just that I'm not sure where that would be located.  It seems to be different for Ubuntu.
2005-07-27T06:25:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	well, man page says /etc/syslog.conf ... but i you don't want that, right?
2005-07-27T06:25:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  On a Mandrake system it's located in /etc/sysconfig/syslog which is not the same as /etc/syslog.conf
2005-07-27T06:26:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	it wouldn't be ... they're different distros :-/
2005-07-27T06:26:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  oh, and yes, I have the man page!  Thanks anyway.
2005-07-27T06:26:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	np ... 'm a bit puzzled though :)
2005-07-27T06:27:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  I've googled it a couple of times and have come up empty-handed thus far.
2005-07-27T06:28:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	from man page: "Setting the interval to zero turns it off entirely"
2005-07-27T06:29:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	so maybe run: 'syslogd -m 0'
2005-07-27T06:33:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  Well, not knowing where to put specify option, I stuck the following in /etc/syslog.conf:  SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-m 0 -r"      Hopefully that'll do it.
2005-07-27T06:33:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	i was under the impression running syslogd would alter the conf file. :-/
2005-07-27T06:34:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  So far, so good.  No complaints from the logger upon restarting sysklogd...
2005-07-27T06:37:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  Anytime I've modified my /etc/syslog.conf file, the changes have stayed so not sure what you're referring to...
2005-07-27T06:38:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	nvm ... i'm probably just confused.  you seem to have fixed it anyway. :)
2005-07-27T06:38:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  Hopefully :-)  Time will tell.  Anyhow, thanks!
2005-07-27T06:54:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  Are you still around?
2005-07-27T06:55:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	what's up?
2005-07-27T06:55:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  I figured it out I think!  The options go directly in the init script for sysklogd as a startup argument!
2005-07-27T06:56:00.000Z	robert_pectol	reka	  Anyway, just in case you were interested...
2005-07-27T06:56:00.000Z	reka	robert_pectol	hehe, thanks.
