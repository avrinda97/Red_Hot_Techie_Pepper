2009-04-02T04:31:00.000Z	zhurai		normally, how long does it take for wubi to install?
2009-04-02T04:32:00.000Z	zhurai		cause I have someone that is taking 2-3 hours, and still on 15%
2009-04-02T04:32:00.000Z	zhurai		:|
2009-04-02T04:32:00.000Z	zhurai		that might be why
2009-04-02T04:32:00.000Z	UKGent	zhurai	  depends a bit on your connection speed but that seems very long - in my case on ADSL it took about 45 mins
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	zhurai		hmm
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	zhurai		<Akatsuki> still 15% there
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	zhurai		<zhurai> huh, how long have you been at it O_o
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	zhurai		<Akatsuki> 2-3 hours o_O
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	zhurai		<Akatsuki> it says scanning files
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	UKGent		and that included getting the updates after install really
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	zhurai		oh
2009-04-02T04:33:00.000Z	zhurai		<Akatsuki> it's done the downloading part quick
2009-04-02T04:34:00.000Z	zhurai		<Akatsuki> just the scanning of the files
2009-04-02T04:34:00.000Z	zhurai		<Akatsuki> or it just froze
2009-04-02T04:34:00.000Z	zhurai		o_O
2009-04-02T04:34:00.000Z	zhurai		you mean you lost your panels?
2009-04-02T04:34:00.000Z	zhurai		...did you delete them maybe by accident?
2009-04-02T04:34:00.000Z	UKGent	zhurai	- I found xubuntu quicker though - which is what I installed - because it does not download Open Office during installation. That is what takes most of the time. He might want to consider xubuntu if connection is slow
2009-04-02T04:34:00.000Z	zhurai		he says it already dled
2009-04-02T04:35:00.000Z	zhurai		it's "scanning"
2009-04-02T04:36:00.000Z	zhurai	UKGent	it's already dled he said, and it says it's scanning, for 2~3 hrs ish
