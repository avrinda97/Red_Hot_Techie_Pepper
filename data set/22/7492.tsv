2006-04-21T06:31:00.000Z	pvd2006		I have a question about linux, I know windows has problems with burning audio/movies if you try doing other stuff while its burning, is linux any different with this?
2006-04-21T06:32:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	you can do whatever you like, as long as you watch for buffer underruns
2006-04-21T06:32:00.000Z	pvd2006	amphi	I am using serpetine audio creator
2006-04-21T06:33:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	dunno anything about it - just give cdrecord or whatever a large buffer and you should be ok
2006-04-21T06:33:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	is that a FE to cdrecord?
2006-04-21T06:34:00.000Z	pvd2006	amphi	Im not sure, I dont see anywhere where I can set a buffer for it though
2006-04-21T06:34:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	if so, you can specify a buffer size with CDR_FIFOSIZE=whatever in /etc/default/cdrecord
2006-04-21T06:35:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	I only use cdrecord
2006-04-21T06:38:00.000Z	pvd2006	amphi	do I run the cdrecord program
2006-04-21T06:40:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	you probably can specify the buffer size on the command line (see man cdrecord), but better put it in /etc/default/cdrecord
2006-04-21T06:40:00.000Z	pvd2006	amphi	it shows it as 4megs
2006-04-21T06:40:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	I have 8, which is probably overkill
2006-04-21T06:50:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	I let cdrecord do as it likes WRT speed
2006-04-21T06:50:00.000Z	pvd2006	amphi	it snot good to write a music cd at 40x though is it?
2006-04-21T06:51:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	perhaps not; I find cdrecord's reported speed varies a lot depending on what I'm burning
2006-04-21T06:52:00.000Z	pvd2006	amphi	Oh ok, I was making sure it wasnt going to do that
2006-04-21T06:54:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	you need to convert to cdda
2006-04-21T06:55:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	man cdrecord has examples for doing this sort of thing; also the cd writing howto at tldp.org
2006-04-28T16:56:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	I like cdrecord
2006-04-28T16:57:00.000Z	pvd2006	amphi	I was learning cdrecord, but I never got down to it.  I guess Ill look around for some articles on how to use it.
2006-04-28T16:58:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	there's a cd writing howto at tldp.org, and man cdrecord has examples of various things; it helps if you set up /etc/default/cdrecord
2006-04-28T05:03:00.000Z	amphi	pvd2006	man cdrecord has an example of the pipeline for doing that
