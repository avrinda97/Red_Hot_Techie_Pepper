2009-03-15T16:54:00.000Z	devon		but it opens *.cpp instead of all the cpp files
2009-03-15T16:55:00.000Z	devon		yup
2009-03-15T16:57:00.000Z	devon		failed to execute child "cd"
2009-03-15T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	devon	you're original command should be working.  Pastebin the entire terminal session
2009-03-15T16:57:00.000Z	devon	jrib	it works in terminal
2009-03-15T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	devon	right.  weird that you are writing a launcher like that.  Anyway, write a shell script and launch that script instead
2009-03-15T17:01:00.000Z	devon	jrib	how do i write a shell script?
2009-03-15T17:01:00.000Z	jrib	devon	put the commands in a text file, make the first line "#!/bin/bash"
2009-03-15T17:03:00.000Z	jrib	devon	provide more details...
2009-03-15T17:04:00.000Z	devon	jrib	wine tryes to lunch the script.. and it says no "no windows program.."
2009-03-15T17:05:00.000Z	jrib	devon	wine tries to launch the script by itself randomly?  Or do you do something?
2009-03-15T17:07:00.000Z	jrib	devon	what is "it" in your sentence?
2009-03-15T17:07:00.000Z	jrib	devon	see if it works in the terminal first
2009-03-15T17:08:00.000Z	jrib	devon	make the file executable
2009-03-15T17:09:00.000Z	devon	jrib	it is, through wine..
2009-03-15T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	devon	no.  Give the file executable permissions is what I mean
2009-03-15T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	devon	chmod +x /path/to/file
