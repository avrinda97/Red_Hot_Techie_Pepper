2009-05-30T06:35:00.000Z	fryguy		why not just run quake in native linux?
2009-05-30T06:36:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	fryguy	actually youre wrong, i am running xp as host
2009-05-30T06:37:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	so you are running ubuntu in a virtual machine and trying to run quake in native linux in a virtual machine?
2009-05-30T06:37:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	fryguy	yeah
2009-05-30T06:37:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	fryguy	i am benching cpu stuff
2009-05-30T06:38:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	so you have a native linux environment to work with, just run strace and go through the code and see what is causing sigsegv
2009-05-30T06:39:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	fryguy	you just fried my head
2009-05-30T06:40:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	lol
2009-05-30T07:00:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	fryguy	it seems like this sig11 is bullcrap
2009-05-30T07:00:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	it's not
2009-05-30T07:00:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	so like i said a while ago, use strace and trace through the code and find what's causing it
2009-05-30T07:01:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	or try manually debugging by eliminating possible causes
2009-05-30T07:02:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	none of those things are conclusive enough to eliminate that as a cause
2009-05-30T07:03:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	have you checked any of the forum posts about this yet?  There's 20,000+ results on google about signal 11 with your program
2009-05-30T07:04:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	none of the 20,000?
2009-05-30T07:04:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	really?
2009-05-30T07:06:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	i'm sure it gave you a lot more than that
2009-05-30T07:11:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	so it's unable to go to fullscreen mode
2009-05-30T07:12:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	you get the exact same strace output?
2009-05-30T07:14:00.000Z	fryguy	JohnnyVbox	if you are getting the same output, then it isn't trying to run in windowed mode
2009-05-30T07:26:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	fryguy	can i limit my download bandwith on ubuntu?
2009-05-30T07:26:00.000Z	JohnnyVbox	fryguy	so my brother wont get mad at me cause i am lagging him
