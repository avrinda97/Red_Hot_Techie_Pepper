2007-09-10T09:51:00.000Z	yaser		hi, im trying to instal a package but it depends on "libwnck18" wich is not available in Gutsy repos, what are my options?
2007-09-10T09:51:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	google.
2007-09-10T09:53:00.000Z	eyec0n		anyone know if theres a tool (pref. with a frontend) for encoding files into wma? Verizon doesn't believe in free formats :/
2007-09-10T09:53:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	the problem is that if i find the package in google i get lost in a sea of extra dependecies
2007-09-10T09:53:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	cant i do some repo thing using feysty repos
2007-09-10T09:54:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	did you try just searching for that library first?
2007-09-10T09:54:00.000Z	eyec0n		dont worry about the package, find the library
2007-09-10T09:54:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	yea
2007-09-10T09:55:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	yea you can for sure use a repo to download the app you just gotta find it :p
2007-09-10T09:55:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	if you find it on a repo it will have all the libraries and stuff with it
2007-09-10T09:56:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	you are using gutsy isnt it?
2007-09-10T09:56:00.000Z	eyec0n		yeah
2007-09-10T09:57:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	havent you tried to install avant dock?
2007-09-10T09:57:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	no I think the avant dock is ugly
2007-09-10T09:57:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	I want more of a launcher than a nifty task list
2007-09-10T09:58:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	do you really think so? (http://tuxlink.wordpress.com/2007/07/13/la-barra-de-leopard-en-ubuntu/)
2007-09-10T09:58:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	that Leopard style is looks very pretty
2007-09-10T09:58:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	sure but it just doesn't do what i'd want it to do
2007-09-10T09:59:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	wich one do you use?
2007-09-10T09:59:00.000Z	eyec0n	yaser	I just use straight gnome. eyecandy got old after a month or two
2007-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	i could install libwnck18 but now it kep with the same dependency problem, even when im sure the library is installed
2007-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	yaser	eyec0n	what can it be?
