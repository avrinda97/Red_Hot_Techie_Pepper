2007-06-20T09:29:00.000Z	aurynn		so what would I look at as to why 7.04 x86-64 wouldn't boot on my AMD64 system?
2007-06-20T09:30:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	the error message
2007-06-20T09:30:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	none; it starts loading and goes to a black screen.
2007-06-20T09:31:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	uh-huh, what about the lights on the cdrom and hdd?
2007-06-20T09:31:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	None. It goes quiet. This is the 7.04 livecd
2007-06-20T09:31:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	okay, do you have anything other than ther keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers plugged in?
2007-06-20T09:32:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	no
2007-06-20T09:33:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	do you have another computer?
2007-06-20T09:33:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	only the one x86-64
2007-06-20T09:33:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	oh. what cpu is it?
2007-06-20T09:34:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	AMD Sempron 64. It ran 6.04-x86-64 without a problem
2007-06-20T09:34:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	AFAIK, 7.04 isn't a final stable release yet.
2007-06-20T09:35:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	you may need to tweak the boot options for the kernel
2007-06-20T09:38:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	i really don't know what else to suggest other than try a 32bit image
2007-06-20T09:39:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	the 32-bit image is working fine
2007-06-20T09:39:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	try expert mode
2007-06-20T09:39:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	would it be worthwhile to reburn the image?
2007-06-20T09:40:00.000Z	Gnea	aurynn	i would try to get the cd to boot with verbosity turned on (so you can see everything that's going on) and without X starting up
2007-06-20T09:40:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	all right
2007-06-20T09:41:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	how do I get to expert mode?
2007-06-20T09:48:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	I got it to boot to system
2007-06-20T09:49:00.000Z	aurynn	Gnea	my bets now would be on X failing to come up properly
