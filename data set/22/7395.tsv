2006-11-06T15:27:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	it used to work, even after I installed edgy, I don't know what happened
2006-11-06T15:27:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	how can I tell?
2006-11-06T15:29:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	aplay --list-devices

2006-11-06T15:30:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	try this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToConfigureSoundBlasterAudigySEinBreezy
2006-11-06T15:30:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	... did you manage to fix it?
2006-11-06T15:30:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	no.
2006-11-06T15:32:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	is it normal that I install a driver? I mean it was working untill 2 days ago (When I last tried it)
2006-11-06T15:33:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	same here
2006-11-06T15:33:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	ordinarly it would have come with it
2006-11-06T15:34:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	another thing, here the author is talking about some application that may have muted the sound, which seems a reasonable cause, is there a way I can check?
2006-11-06T15:35:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	it depends on what you're running. try this: cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp at a terminal. cryptonic: if you have to ask you don't want to know. abo: stop the static by hitting ctrl-c at a prompt
2006-11-06T15:36:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	 cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp gave no sound, what does this test mean?
2006-11-06T15:37:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	I'll restart in windows to eliminate all possible hardware issues
2006-11-06T15:37:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	don't
2006-11-06T15:37:00.000Z	abo	hyperactivecrond	other suggestions?
2006-11-06T15:37:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	abo	it probably will take a few bug reports
