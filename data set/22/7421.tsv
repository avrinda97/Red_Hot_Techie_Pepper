2006-04-03T11:40:00.000Z	harisund		is there a way I can change the default Gnome window manager from metacity to something else?
2006-04-03T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 yes you can change it. :p
2006-04-03T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 what ya wanting to change it to - is the big Q.
2006-04-03T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 i think ya just fire up the gconf editor and chagne it in there some where.. ive had bad luck changeing it in the past.
2006-04-03T11:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 i say check the ubuntu wiki/forums
2006-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 'mondo/mindi' is very good. but takes some learning.
2006-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	I don't mind learning at all. After all, how steep can the learning curve be :) ?
2006-04-21T10:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 it lets you backup a system to nfs/samba/cd/dvd and have a bootable restore disk set.
2006-04-21T10:10:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	Wow I am ready for all 4 actually.
2006-04-21T10:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 I think ya can even boot one of the cd's then make it restore off the nfs/samba :P so ya dont need to burn all the dvd/isos unless ya need to.
2006-04-21T10:11:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	I just apt-cache searched mondo and both mondo and mindi sound awesome. I am going to try tha.t
2006-04-21T10:13:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	Sure. I agree, GUI is idiot-friendly, but you can know what exactly is going on with the CLI, especially if you turn on verbose output options.
2006-04-21T10:13:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	Agent_bob and Warbo: I am going to try out both mando/mindi and dd. Thanks so much !
2006-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	I agree with you there.. there will come a time I am sure, just that it is not now :)
2006-05-03T09:56:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	I am sure there are a lot of people using bluez-utils, but I am sure there are  a lot more who don't.
2006-05-03T09:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 edit the grub boot line and append 'single' i think
2006-05-03T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 like 'spice' ?
2009-11-01T13:17:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	SingAlong This is one of those situations where configuring through the command line and not using the GUI is much better :) I hate setting up a Synergy server on Windows especially, which is the trouble SingAlong is having
2009-11-01T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 dpms command i think can do it.. or the xrandr command
2009-11-01T13:34:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	I am not running X since I don't have enough memory for it. I am using the laptop for strictly command line apps, IRSSI, torrent, file sharing etc. And I want the LCD turned off :(
2010-03-19T05:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	harisund	 you can set it to use a 'blank' password. so it saves your passwords.. but dosent ask for one at startup
2010-03-19T05:51:00.000Z	harisund	Dr_Willis	I see.. Interesting that's good to know thanks :)
