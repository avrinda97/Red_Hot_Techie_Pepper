2006-10-01T12:52:00.000Z	RAMiN_		btw, guys do you know about that easy ubuntu stuff
2006-10-01T12:53:00.000Z	RAMiN_		the package that comes with all the ubuntu plugins
2006-10-01T12:53:00.000Z	RAMiN_		and .mp3 plugins for all the players

2006-10-01T12:53:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	It's not a package.
2006-10-01T12:54:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	A wiki page.
2006-10-01T12:54:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	Yes.
2006-10-01T13:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	Haha.
2006-10-01T13:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	Try #debian
2006-10-01T13:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	And if you think that's crowded, try #gnome on gnome.org :)
2006-10-01T13:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	I prefer Debian Stable for servers.
2006-10-01T13:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	As many as you want.
2006-10-01T13:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	Most people use a netinst CD for Debian, which is like, 100MB.
2006-10-01T13:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	For servers, you only need the console.
2006-10-01T13:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	Whatever for?
2006-10-01T13:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	My server doesn't even have a monitor attached.
2006-10-01T13:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	RAMiN_	Infact, I've pulled the video card out of it.
