2011-08-25T02:55:00.000Z	BarkingFish		if you're running kubuntu, try service kdm start
2011-08-25T02:56:00.000Z	BarkingFish		hm.
2011-08-25T02:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	fyi kubuntu mobile != kubuntu
2011-08-25T02:57:00.000Z	BarkingFish	zykotick9	ok, sorry - I didn't realise the two were different.
2011-08-25T02:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	you don't have to be sorry, i just wanted to point out why your command wasn't working
2011-08-25T02:59:00.000Z	BarkingFish	zykotick9	I'm relatively new to kubuntu, about 4 weeks in, so if I bugger something up, I appreciate being told :) Thanks!

2011-10-13T02:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	it could be ANY time on the 13th
2011-10-13T02:33:00.000Z	BarkingFish	zykotick9	Mneumonic> what time zone is ubuntu in.  I'm having trouble figuring out when 11.10 is releasing
2011-10-13T02:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	the time is never specified
2011-10-13T02:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	really?  they specifically said midnight?  wow.
2011-10-13T02:35:00.000Z	BarkingFish	zykotick9	There we go. That info is up in the release party channel
2012-01-20T00:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	do you happen to know the difference between 11 and 9?  I've never seen 11 used before, and "man kill" telling  "SEGV      11   core" doesn't mean anything to me ;)
2012-04-20T04:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	use "!ops | NICKINQUESTION reason after" ;)
2012-10-02T06:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	be aware that CCSM can break Unity
2012-10-02T06:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	be aware that 12.04 is the last unity2d
2012-10-03T03:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	IF you don't get an answer here, you might want to try asking in #kubuntu
2012-10-03T03:02:00.000Z	BarkingFish	zykotick9	the reason I'm asking here is what I have is not part of kubuntu :)
2012-10-03T03:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	i realize that.  but, unity people would have no idea what's in kde.  i figure a kde user must have run into this issue before.
2012-10-03T03:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	best of luck man.  you might get an answer here, patience is a good thing.
2012-10-03T03:13:00.000Z	BarkingFish	zykotick9	anyone else who can help - the thing I'm pointing to in this screenshot is what I'm trying to identify from unity/gdm > http://imgur.com/YRim6
2012-10-03T03:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	BarkingFish	that looks like the scroll bar to me (i don't use unity or kde, so have no idea)  good luck.
