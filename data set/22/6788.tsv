2010-11-24T13:04:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	you need to decompress/detar it
2010-11-24T13:04:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	I can do that but whats next?
2010-11-24T13:05:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	I did this using right click on the file > extract here.
2010-11-24T13:06:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	hmm it should appear as a directory once succesfully extracted or you get lots of files I think
2010-11-24T13:06:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	yes, I have two folders and one file called install.py
2010-11-24T13:08:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	looks like you'll need to run install.py from the console for better output
2010-11-24T13:10:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	I did this, I got a message telling if i want to install files for the current user, after typing yes and enter the terminal was closed
2010-11-24T13:11:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	I suppose you double clicked on the install.py file? Then I suppose the files would have been installed as your current login (unless you want to put it somewhere else like for example around the rootfs
2010-11-24T13:12:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	It works!! Thank you very much.
2010-11-24T13:13:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	heh np

2010-11-24T13:57:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	When I install the program in usr/bin/zimbra mail the desktop icon is locked and I can't access it, is it because of the installation folder
2010-11-24T13:58:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	hard to say, that could just be mode issue, I'd check the permissions
2011-01-05T11:30:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	no, not passively
2011-01-05T11:30:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	I can do this on windows using norton so is there in program that I can use?
2011-01-05T11:31:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	well I don't know how norton works
2011-01-05T11:32:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	I want to shutdown a remote machine.
2011-01-05T12:33:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Syria	maybe you don't have ownership to that file/directory
2011-01-05T12:33:00.000Z	Syria	psycho_oreos	Actually the folder uploads was not existed, wordpress did not create it automatically as usual. thank you
