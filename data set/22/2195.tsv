2009-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	I use google chrome on linux
2009-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	Do you know how to enable flash?
2009-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	it isn't quite as snappy as it is in windows, but hey, it is just a developement release
2009-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	edit the launcher
2009-09-17T06:51:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	add --enable-plugins
2009-09-17T06:51:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	How do I edit the launcher?
2009-09-17T06:51:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	where do you launch it from? the "Applications>Internet" menu?
2009-09-17T06:52:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	I have an icon on the desktop, I assume it would be in the internet section though.
2009-09-17T06:52:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	just right click on the launcher and there
2009-09-17T06:53:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	Okay.. I'm confused.
2009-09-17T06:54:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	what has you confused?
2009-09-17T06:54:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	the edit the launcher part. I don't know what the launcher looks like.
2009-09-17T06:54:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	that icon on your desktop that you click when you want to open google chrome, that is the launcher
2009-09-17T06:54:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	how do I edit it?
2009-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	right click on it, click Properties
2009-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	in the place that says "Command"  add --enable-plugins
2009-09-17T06:56:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	So flash'll work now?
2009-09-17T06:57:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	it shouldn't be long before plugins are enabled by default, the OS X developement version has plugins by default now
2009-09-17T06:57:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	yes, after you close all of your google chrome windows
2009-09-17T06:57:00.000Z	demonspork	aj_444	and relaunch
2009-09-17T06:58:00.000Z	aj_444	demonspork	Okay. Thanks.
