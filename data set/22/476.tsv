2011-09-05T23:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	past the address you're trying to wgwet
2011-09-06T03:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	look in synaptic to see if it is even there.
2011-09-06T03:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	only one downloader open at a time as well.
2011-09-15T11:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	they are on the pppa but if you run a update you will see the missing ones there is a command to load them.
2011-09-15T11:33:00.000Z	Dollz	urlin2u	this one ? add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name
2011-09-15T11:35:00.000Z	Dollz	urlin2u	thanks
2011-09-15T11:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	no if you run a update you will see a set of letter and numbers. this is the command sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys
2011-09-15T11:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	that command one space then the key from the update.
2011-09-15T11:36:00.000Z	Dollz	urlin2u	K,  will try that now
2011-09-15T11:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	but ActionParsnip  is correct in that the first will load both.
2011-09-15T11:38:00.000Z	Dollz	urlin2u	yes , I ran it and got in the return msg : --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv D687A54E147F6B81BF3D2E914FEC4
2011-09-15T11:38:00.000Z	Dollz	urlin2u	ops , are these keys meant to be secret ?
2011-09-15T11:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	there are the gpg signing key to secure your getting the right stuf basically.
2011-09-15T11:40:00.000Z	Dollz	urlin2u	like checksum md5 hash ?
2011-09-15T11:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	in a sense yes but, this probably explains it better http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html
2011-09-15T11:41:00.000Z	Dollz	urlin2u	thank you
2011-09-15T11:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	Dollz	no problem.
