2008-01-31T10:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	How did you remove it?  Uninstall or just delete it.  #Winehq has answers for most wine issues
2008-02-08T06:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	Did you just end up with a blank screen or something like that
2008-02-08T07:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	Have you made any changes to your sources.list
2008-02-12T07:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	They should not.. what are you showing for sources
2008-02-12T07:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	Did you ever post your sources.list
2008-02-12T07:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	HAve you installed much from outside official repos? it might not be a problem with the dl and it may be something else

2008-02-12T07:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	It is the checksum of a good copy of gimp
2008-02-14T17:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	The list of packages yes
2008-03-13T04:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	yes...  /var/cache/apt/archives has all the debs that are dl'd
2008-03-13T04:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	aptoncd has an overall size limit from what I rmemeber
2008-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	no, aptpn cd does more, it creates the list of packages etc as if a full repo..
2008-03-13T04:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oboy03	Yes, then manually copy them to that same folder as needed.. see clone or automate below
