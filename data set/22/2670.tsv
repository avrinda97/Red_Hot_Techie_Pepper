2010-10-15T05:47:00.000Z	stercor		Is there a command like MS-DOSs dir that gives the total space used by the files in the directory.  ls -l doesn't do this.
2010-10-15T05:47:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	du
2010-10-15T05:47:00.000Z	stercor	Skaperen	ty
2010-10-15T05:48:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	you might use the -s option with that, too
2010-10-15T05:51:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	if using bash, add this line to your .bashrc file:   alias dir='du -s'
2010-10-15T05:52:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	but Da_Wrecka's point is valid ... check what dir does first
2010-10-15T05:52:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	that alias might get used by scripts that expect another behavior (more like ls)
2010-10-15T05:53:00.000Z	stercor	Skaperen	Thanks.  I did, and it did.
2010-10-15T05:53:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	what netbook?
2010-10-15T05:53:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	can't get into BIOS?
2010-10-15T05:54:00.000Z	stercor	Skaperen	Yes I can do that.
2010-10-15T05:54:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	then get into BIOS setup and boot from a CD
2010-10-15T05:54:00.000Z	stercor	Skaperen	I don't have a CD.
2010-10-15T05:54:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	then a USB memory stick?
2010-10-15T05:57:00.000Z	stercor	Skaperen	SD card = flash drive?
2010-10-15T05:57:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	so no CD drive (USB one since netbooks don't have builtin) or USB flash drive handy ... bummer
2010-10-15T05:57:00.000Z	stercor	Skaperen	But I still have my trusty rusty desktop with only Ubuntu on it.
2010-10-15T05:57:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	yes, an SD card can be used in most machines ... in some they are USB ... in others they are special but BIOS often knows how to boot them anyway
2010-10-15T05:58:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	how did you install onto the netbook in the first place?
2010-10-15T06:02:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	you need to stock up on USB memory stick flash drives ... I have 7 of them and need more
2010-10-15T06:03:00.000Z	stercor	Skaperen	:-)
2010-10-15T06:05:00.000Z	Skaperen	stercor	I have different versions of 10.10 on 5 of my USB memory sticks ... the red one has u-i386 ... green one has u-amd64 ... purple one has ku-i386 ... blue one has ku-amd64 ... cyan one has u-netbook-i386
