2011-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	Defusal		the idea is, the laptops battery will protect it against downtime due to power failures
2011-09-19T11:48:00.000Z	Defusal		but now, after removing the network-manager and rebooting, i still only have local network access... with the dns server added to /etc/resolv.conf, it resolves the ip of external addresses but cannot reach them... sigh
2011-09-19T11:48:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	use tmpfs for all folders that contain cache contents that can be discarded upon shutdown
2011-09-19T11:49:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	is there an easy way to set up the system to use tmpfs for all temp things, such as the swapfile?
2011-09-19T12:00:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	it's largely a manual job of searching out folders that are frequently written to.
2011-09-19T12:00:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	try using an external usb hdd, then your problems should disappear like snow in the sun
2011-09-19T12:02:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	yeah well, i'll see how performance goes, i dont have money for an external 2.5" drive right now, and a powered one would defeat the point of the laptops battery being a backup in power failures
2011-09-19T12:03:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	startup the dhcp client manually
2011-09-19T12:03:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	i need manual static configuration
2011-09-19T12:04:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	get a double header external usb-case, should only cost $5 or $10 insert an old hdd.
2011-09-19T12:04:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	then use ifconfig
2011-09-19T12:05:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	i dont have a spare old laptop hard drive, else i would be using that.. inside the laptop
2011-09-19T12:05:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	how is that supposed to help anything? i can see my configuration is correct...
2011-09-19T12:36:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	if you are using a windows server with network sharing the ballgame has changed. The windows network sharing only share with computer that got it's address from it's dhcp
2011-09-19T12:38:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	are you reading all comments that contain your name ? they are usually highlighted.

2011-09-19T12:39:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	sorry, i may have missed some due to all of ikonias spam, i will read up once i have responded to private messages
2011-09-19T12:39:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	you are spimming in here with your windows sharing crap
2011-09-19T12:40:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	you are spimming in here with your windows sharing crap
2011-09-19T12:40:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	that is incorrect, i have used this windows gateway for many years for all sorts of operating systems and i only use static addresses on my network
2011-09-19T12:41:00.000Z	lapion	Defusal	in that case make sure you turn off the firewall (ufw) in ubunut
2011-09-19T12:42:00.000Z	Defusal	lapion	i didnt think that could block IMCP packet responses, but i will try
