2006-08-05T11:41:00.000Z	oxez		How would I give my user permissions to change permissions on a FAT32 filesystem? I managed to give myself rw access, so I can move my data to that new hard drive, but I can't set permissions..
2006-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 you got to mount the partition with umask 0222 normally for that.
2006-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 and you DONT set the permissions on the folders/files indivitually - you set them on the drive at mount time. and thats how they stay
2006-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	I'll try umask=0222.. I currently have umask=000
2006-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 000 is a little unsafe.
2006-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	I can no longer create fils with 0222
2006-08-05T11:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 check your fstab/mount command then.
2006-08-05T11:53:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	I can change permissions, but only as root.
2006-08-05T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 its proberly fakeing it :)   if you want all users to be able to access that vfat, use the users and user options and umask=022  (I think)
2006-08-05T11:54:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	I don't really want to "use" permissions. It's only SVN trying to sets file in read-only
2006-08-05T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 http://wiki.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=ntfs-en#can_i_mount_an_ntfs_volume   for examples.  (for ntfs, but vfat works also)
2006-08-05T11:54:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	files in .svn directory
2006-08-05T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 Hmm..   keeping that stuff on a vfat may not be a good idea.
2006-08-05T11:54:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	why's that?
2006-08-05T11:55:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	I plan to share /dev/hdb1/www between my windows and linux systems
2006-08-05T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 for the exact problems you are having for one. :P
2006-08-05T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 you can set windows to read/write to ext3/2 drives. :)
2006-08-05T11:55:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	I tried it, didn't work with TortoiseSVN
2006-08-05T11:59:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	I got it: I added uid=1000
2006-08-05T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 ok - thats  just setting the dir to be owned by the user 1000, if you used the 'user' option . it would do the same. :P IF that user mounted the dir.
2006-08-05T12:00:00.000Z	oxez	Dr_Willis	alright. Now I'll just have to test if it works for windows
2006-08-12T12:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oxez	 reserved for root/lost+found
