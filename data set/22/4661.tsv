2007-11-17T00:11:00.000Z	PiterDeVries		any idea how to stop kubuntu 6.1 boot at the login point? without running X? Add. info: I don't have shell so I can't edit any cinfig files
2007-11-17T00:11:00.000Z	PiterDeVries		hmm, ok yes :)
2007-11-17T00:13:00.000Z	PiterDeVries		at the boot I switch to text mode, receive few msgs and just after showing the login: it tries to switch to X and everything halts... any idea how to avoid that?
2007-11-17T00:13:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	boot to single user
2007-11-17T00:15:00.000Z	PiterDeVries	BlueDevil	how can I do that without being able to edit anything

2007-11-17T00:20:00.000Z	PiterDeVries	BlueDevil	I don't think I can do the single-user. I can't get to "grub screen" it simply boots ubuntu. The instalation was a bit weird (I didn't even had a chance to pick packages)...
2007-11-17T00:21:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	you don't get a chance to pick packages during the initial install
2007-11-17T00:21:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	AFAIK
2007-11-17T00:21:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	you need to press "Esc" to get the grub menu
2007-11-17T00:25:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	what video card are you using?
2007-11-17T00:26:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	change the video driver to "vesa" in xorg.conf
2007-11-17T00:26:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	you compiled a custom kernel?
2007-11-17T00:27:00.000Z	PiterDeVries	BlueDevil	live CD seemed to try to boot with vesa but with same result as regular boot
2007-11-17T00:27:00.000Z	PiterDeVries	BlueDevil	not now. Now I'm using live DVD kernels
2007-11-17T00:27:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	what video driver do you have not in xorg.conf?
2007-11-17T00:28:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	uname -a
2007-11-17T00:29:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	what ubuntu release are you running?
2007-11-17T00:31:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	you would have to do several upgrades
2007-11-17T00:31:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	you're better off with installing the latest from the start rather than upgrading
2007-11-17T00:32:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	try what sfears said
2007-11-17T00:33:00.000Z	BlueDevil	PiterDeVries	[21:33] <sfears> see if you can set the display to 600x800 or vesa or something or other
