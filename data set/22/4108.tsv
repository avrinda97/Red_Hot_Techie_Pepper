2008-03-20T09:21:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		what would be a good way to delete my XP from one hard drive and then move my ubuntu partition to that hard drive?
2008-03-20T09:21:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		and get grub right
2008-03-20T09:22:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		that's it?
2008-03-20T09:23:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		so when i format the xp part it won't get rid of the grub?
2008-03-20T09:24:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		why would you install linux inside windows?  kinda defeats the purpose
2008-03-20T09:24:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	for the inverse of the reason you install windows within linux i suppose :)
2008-03-28T15:06:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	it's to do with whether you want the daemon to run all the time or just when a connection is made to the listening port
2008-03-28T15:08:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	unop__	yeah that's why i was saying, if you don't have alot of connections use inetd, i guess if you have the ram, use standalone
2008-03-28T15:08:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	i suggested he use the standalone setup as it's probably easier  for him to setup and have running
2008-03-28T15:23:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	kopette might save some configuration data or chat data under ~/.kde/ somewhere
2008-03-28T15:27:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	i think you might need to explicitly set timeo to something .. and it's in 1/10 of a second, so 14 would be 1.4 second, i'd try something like 100 maybe
2008-03-28T15:28:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	unop__	on server right? exports?
2008-03-28T15:28:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	errm no, this is a mount point option
2008-03-28T15:29:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	timeo is a value for the kernel to detect when the filesystem is unavailable
2008-03-28T15:30:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	yep
2008-03-28T15:30:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	mount -a
2008-03-28T15:31:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_network/x-087-2-nfs.mountd.html
2008-03-28T16:08:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	unop__	was that you saying timeo is not in seconds?
2008-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	unop__	well i have it at 100, i open nautilus and it sems like it does take 100 seconds for it to actually display the files
2008-03-28T19:52:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	depends on the session -- one of 590x
2008-03-28T19:56:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	again it depends on the session -- hostname:1 connects to 5901, hostname:2 to 5902, etc
2008-03-28T21:44:00.000Z	unop__	kindofabuzz	what happens when you click or right click in the screen? maybe you are in the TWM window manager that vnc servers use
