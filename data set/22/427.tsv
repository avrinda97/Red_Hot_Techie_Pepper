2011-10-13T05:20:00.000Z	jeangray		see the thing is, when i install the proprietary drivers for my laptop, restarting would just give me a boot hang and i wouldnt know what to do after
2011-10-13T05:20:00.000Z	jeangray		does anyone else encounter that problem?
2011-10-13T05:20:00.000Z	jeangray		and im talking about the proprietary drivers for the graphics card
2011-10-13T05:21:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	what part of the boot sequence does it hang?
2011-10-13T05:21:00.000Z	jeangray	mendota	basically after i choose which kernal to run, it just stays black
2011-10-13T05:21:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	yeah...that's not good
2011-10-13T05:22:00.000Z	mendota		none of the kernal options work, jeangray?
2011-10-13T05:22:00.000Z	jeangray		mondota: from the last time i remember, not even the recovery loaded
2011-10-13T05:22:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	and this started after installing new drivers?
2011-10-13T05:22:00.000Z	jeangray	mendota	yes
2011-10-13T05:23:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	and, i have to ask, you're sure you got software from a trusted source?
2011-10-13T05:23:00.000Z	jeangray	mendota	im downloaiding it right off the additional drivers from ubuntu
2011-10-13T05:23:00.000Z	jeangray	mendota	i hope thats trusted
2011-10-13T05:23:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	well that's weird then. ubuntu repos should be pretty safe
2011-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	jeangray		well im going to try installing the one from the amd graphics website
2011-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	jeangray		ill see what happens
2011-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	but i've also heard of boot-sector viruses, especially today in my own troubleshooting
2011-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	jeangray	mendota	boot-sector virsues?
2011-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	yeah, proprietary is okay to try too.
2011-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	i've got a laptop that won't boot HDD, and that was one cause tossed around in old forum posts
2011-10-13T05:25:00.000Z	jeangray	mendota	oh okay, yeahwell ill come back and hopefully everything will be working, thank you for your help
2011-10-13T05:26:00.000Z	mendota	jeangray	no problem. good luck and everything
