2010-04-25T02:03:00.000Z	Inde147		Alright, if so could walk me through this it would be AWESOME.
2010-04-25T02:03:00.000Z	Inde147		I have a CDROM in drive E of my computer, which currently runs Win98
2010-04-25T02:03:00.000Z	Inde147		The Win98 is glitchy as a ll hell
2010-04-25T02:03:00.000Z	Inde147		So I'm trying to install Ubuntu off a CDROM
2010-04-25T02:04:00.000Z	Inde147		I told it to boot from  CDROM in Bios, which did not work
2010-04-25T02:04:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	drive E ? :s
2010-04-25T02:04:00.000Z	Inde147	ibuclaw	Allegedly
2010-04-25T02:04:00.000Z	Inde147	ibuclaw	what should it be? :(
2010-04-25T02:05:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	oh, you are talking about Windows drives ... confused me for a moment. :)
2010-04-25T02:05:00.000Z	Inde147	ibuclaw	yea, sorry
2010-04-25T02:06:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	how did you burn the CD?
2010-04-25T02:07:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	so if you open the CD for reading, do you see a bunch of files ?
2010-04-25T02:08:00.000Z	Inde147	ibuclaw	I havn't opened it for running, should I try in Windows? I've been trying to boot from it.
2010-04-25T02:09:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	I'd check the contents of the CD first
2010-04-25T02:09:00.000Z	Inde147	ibuclaw	Alright....
2010-04-25T02:10:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	just name a few files/folders that you see
2010-04-25T02:11:00.000Z	Inde147	ibuclaw	The file is called "ubuntu-9.10-desktop-i386.iso. It does not open. Does that mean I did it wrong?
2010-04-25T02:11:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	that is on the CD?

2010-04-25T02:11:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	then as far as I can tell, you did it wrong. =)
2010-04-25T02:12:00.000Z	Inde147	ibuclaw	tried it, I'm on a school computer and DiskUtility is locked
2010-04-25T02:27:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Inde147	try booting it then =)
