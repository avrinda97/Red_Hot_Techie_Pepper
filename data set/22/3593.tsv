2008-07-25T04:50:00.000Z	stuck1		I can't connect to wireless with my broadcom on a dell inspiron.
2008-07-25T04:50:00.000Z	stuck1		any help?
2008-07-25T04:50:00.000Z	stuck1		the light won't turn on on the hardware, either.
2008-07-25T04:51:00.000Z	stuck1		It's a Broadcom B43 wireless driver
2008-07-25T04:52:00.000Z	stuck1		In "Hardware Drivers" the check box is enabled, and it says In use
2008-07-25T04:52:00.000Z	stuck1		but when I right click on the network icon and select networks, nothing shows.
2008-07-25T04:53:00.000Z	stuck1		The ATI driver is working great, compiz is up and running beautifully.
2008-07-25T04:53:00.000Z	stuck1		The laptop is a Dell Inspiron 1721, I'm sure this problem is not unusual.
2008-07-25T04:54:00.000Z	stuck1		I looked up ndiswrapper stuff, but I'm not sure if I need it since the hardware is listed under the Hardware Drivers applet.
2008-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	stuck1		Has anybody gotten their little LED to light up under hardy?
2008-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	crimsun_	stuck1	lspci -nv|grep -i broadcom
2008-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	crimsun_		er
2008-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	crimsun_	stuck1	lspci -v|grep -i broadcom
2008-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	stuck1	crimsun_	thanks.
2008-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	crimsun_	stuck1	what does the latter command give you/
2008-07-25T04:56:00.000Z	stuck1	crimsun_	BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 01)
2008-07-25T04:57:00.000Z	crimsun_	stuck1	you don't need ndiswrapper.  That chipset works fine with 8.04.1's b43 driver and b43-fwcutter.
2008-07-25T04:57:00.000Z	stuck1	crimsun_	OK, so how do I turn it on and connect to a network then?
2008-07-25T04:58:00.000Z	stuck1	crimsun_	Does the LED ever come on?
2008-07-25T04:58:00.000Z	crimsun_	stuck1	see the wiki.  Yes, it does.  Sorry, I need to run.
2008-07-25T04:58:00.000Z	stuck1		where is the wiki?
2008-07-25T04:58:00.000Z	stuck1	crimsun_	where is the wiki?
