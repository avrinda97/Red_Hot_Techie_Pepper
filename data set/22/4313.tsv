2009-04-07T03:45:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	I have no idea what htscanner.so does
2009-04-07T03:46:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	you might want to ask the ispconfig people
2009-04-07T03:46:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	histo	where? I tried #ispconfig and it's invite only...
2009-04-07T03:51:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	histo	what is pear?
2009-04-07T03:51:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	a fruit silly
2009-04-07T03:53:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	its a redistrubution system for reusable php components
2009-04-07T03:53:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	and framework
2009-04-07T03:54:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	you do realize that ispconfig has their own support community you are offtopic
2009-04-07T03:54:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	histo	okay, but I'm worried that when I changed my php.ini 's I didn't do it right. I thought they might, but WHERE DO I GO?
2009-04-07T03:55:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	I would look on the ispconfig page possibly the support sectioni
2009-04-07T03:55:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	http://www.ispconfig.org/support.htm
2009-04-07T03:57:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	maybe look for a channel on irc then that is about ispconfig rather than askign in #ubuntu
2009-04-07T03:57:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	they would be able to better answer your questions than anyone here
2009-04-07T03:57:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	histo	sorry, I'm installing on ubuntu, so I started here.
2009-04-07T03:57:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	histo	anybody know anybody in #ispconfig that can get me an invite?
2009-04-07T03:58:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	No i hear you. I've been there. I'm just trying to point you in the right direction. Chances of getting help on specific stuff like that here are slim to none.
2009-04-07T03:58:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	histo	especially with all this noob chatter. This chan is slammed to day
2009-04-07T03:59:00.000Z	histo	q_a_z_steve	not really noob chatter but default support channel.
2009-04-07T03:59:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	histo	whatever, that's why I came, you never know what you're going to find.
