2008-10-05T00:53:00.000Z	Luminerd__		WTF!!! Now my external drive is not in /dev nor can gparted see it
2008-10-05T00:54:00.000Z	Luminerd__		Actionparsnip: I can.
2008-10-05T00:55:00.000Z	Luminerd__		LOL wow now after that command gparted sees it
2008-10-05T00:55:00.000Z	Luminerd__		Thanks heh
2008-10-05T00:57:00.000Z	Luminerd__		Ok so I still have the problem of I have 20 identical machines, 1 has ubuntu, and I need them all to have ubuntu, and partimage doesn't seem to be doing the trick
2008-10-05T00:58:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	Imaging isn't the answer unless you have identical machines. Preseed installations via PXE, or some other boot method is the best approach I've found.
2008-10-05T01:00:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	I didn't see that. Hard to follow conversations with all the noise. There really ought to be a newbie channel so we can filter out the "Where is my email folder?" types of questions. I wasted a lot of time fiddling with Clonezilla and FAI. Both require more time to understand than I cared to commit, especially since preseeding is the official Debian/Ubuntu way of doing scripted installations.
2008-10-05T01:03:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	I'd still go with preseeding. It's actually reasonably easy to set up.
2008-10-05T01:03:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	Do you have a reference system?
2008-10-05T01:06:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	No reference system, no big deal. If you can install one system via preseeding, you can install 1000. The whole point is repeatability.
2008-10-05T01:07:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	One tip that will save you hours, use the example-preseed.txt from the Ubuntu site as a starting point.
2008-10-05T01:07:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	I'll get you a URL. Give me a few minutes. I have to move to another machine.
2008-10-05T01:09:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	Are you an experienced sysadmin on any other OS, say Windows?
2008-10-05T01:16:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	partimage would be fine if you're doing one machine at a time, I suppose. How many machines do you have?
2008-10-05T01:18:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	Preseeding in a nutshell, download that example-preseed.txt. Modify to suit. Put the modified file on a web or ftp server somewhere. To test, take an Alternate boot CD and pass the URL to the preseed file to the kernel (hit F6).
2008-10-05T01:19:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	It's not necessarily just over a network. You can use preseeding with any installation method, CD, USB key, network, whatever.
2008-10-05T01:20:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	All preseeding is doing is providing answers to all the questions for which you'd normally be prompted during installation. I can get from bare metal to complete KDE desktop machine in under 10 minutes by answering one question during installation and that one question, I'm sure I can preseed away too.
2008-10-05T01:21:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	All installing over a network is going to do instead of a CD is make the installation even more automatic. You can do 20 machines in under 30 minutes because you won't have to run around to each one individually.
2008-10-05T01:22:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	You can add user accounts to the preseed file.
2008-10-05T01:23:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	Not really. There's a bunch of complexity to other schemes too. You just don't know them yet. :)
2008-10-05T01:24:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	So what "simple" method were you considering?
2008-10-05T01:25:00.000Z	cilkay	Luminerd__	Do you already have a disk image? (That's what I meant by a reference system.)
