2011-05-18T00:03:00.000Z	floww	nit-wit	 Windows 7 loads automatically , Ubuntu boots by pushing a key while booting

2011-05-18T00:04:00.000Z	floww	nit-wit	 no both intern
2011-05-18T00:05:00.000Z	floww	nit-wit	 ill just try to boot and look if its going
2011-05-18T00:06:00.000Z	nit-wit	floww	what some random person told you about a key I have no idea. But I suspect they were talking about the key prompt at power on the computer to get to a boot from menu that looks like the bios menu to change what is read first. this other is outside of the bios
