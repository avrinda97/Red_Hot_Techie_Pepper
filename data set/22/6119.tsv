2008-01-17T22:35:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> you can always tail a log file written to ... man tail please
2008-01-17T22:36:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> look at your web.xml of your app or tomcats own web.xml ,  see the sample apps where and how they use loggers
2008-01-17T22:37:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> i assumed you wrote your own webapp, so you must know how to use loggers, and not stdout
2008-01-17T22:37:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> tomcat comes with example webapps, see how it uses the loggers
2008-01-17T22:38:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> i dont know what flex data services is, but if its a webapp running on tomcat, it should have the correct hooks to use the loggers, look for its config files how it logs
2008-01-17T22:40:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> webapps are not supposed to be logging to stdout, webapps should not be accessing stdout only loggers
2008-01-17T22:42:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> i am not sure if you are following me, webapp servers are not normally doing output to stdout,  only spits out output to log files
2008-01-17T22:43:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> look here maybe? {Tomcat}/webapps/samples/WEB-INF/flex/logs/flex.log
2008-01-17T22:44:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> then do a tail of this log file
2008-01-17T22:44:00.000Z	bkar		astronaute-> it should be the same as in windows,  you have a tool to configure webapp settings via the web..
2008-01-17T22:45:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	you are right there is flex.log i will dgg it thank you ! :)
2008-01-17T22:33:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	yes i need to debug some flex app, but cant find how to set stdout path :/
2008-01-17T22:34:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	stdout.log in fact is supposed to be generated too, well how can I monitor it over terminal please ?
2008-01-17T22:35:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	my problem is that I cant find that file
2008-01-17T22:37:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	i dont have any but ill try to figure it out
2008-01-17T22:38:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	no it is about flex data services, i need to see its logs because there is some problemes on launch
2008-01-17T22:39:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	it logs in stdout file normally, but where i dont know "ConsoleTarget"
2008-01-17T22:41:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	it is a logger : flex.messaging.log.ConsoleTarget
2008-01-17T22:42:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	weird thing, i have stdout.log on windows but not on ubuntu (with flex logging)
2008-01-17T22:42:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	same webapp
2008-01-17T22:43:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	thats it, but it is simply not normal that on windows i get that log file and not on my ubuntu
2008-01-17T22:43:00.000Z	astronaute	bkar	there must be some place to configure it, on windows it is simple in its service GUI but ubuntu im lost
