2006-10-29T12:14:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 great :] 
2006-10-29T14:46:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 i'm afraid i don't know much about windows
2006-11-04T11:27:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 /etc/resolv.conf
2006-11-04T11:30:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 the system should automatically use the servers in /etc/resolv.conf to resolve DNS
2006-11-04T11:31:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 can you ping the address?
2006-11-04T11:32:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 can you ping the DNS servers in your /etc/resolv.conf ?
2006-11-04T11:35:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 are you downloading with bittorrent or other p2p ?  your upstream may be saturated
2006-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 it does sound like you may have DNS problems - your dns servers may be slow in responding
2006-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 what about the host command    host www.example.com     for example, does it reply quickly?
2006-11-04T11:39:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 maybe try different DNS servers if you can.  It seems like they are not responding well
2006-11-04T11:40:00.000Z	wastrel	AlanHaggai	 call your ISP :]    i don't know any public dnsmachines.
