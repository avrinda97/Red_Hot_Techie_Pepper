2009-05-09T03:45:00.000Z	guycook		Can ubuntu upgrade itself?
2009-05-09T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	yes
2009-05-09T03:48:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	I get "Could not download all repository indexes" in the update manager on this older install of x64 ubuntu
2009-05-09T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	how old? what version?
2009-05-09T03:48:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	don't remember how to check
2009-05-09T03:49:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	the Update manager says " New distribution release 7.10 is available"
2009-05-09T03:50:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	open a terminal, run "lsb_release -a"
2009-05-09T03:50:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	ah, this is 7.04
2009-05-09T03:51:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	that might have gone out of date.. so the repos are gone
2009-05-09T03:51:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	ah, that makes sense
2009-05-09T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	actually it doesn't.. personally I think it's a bad move by canonical.. but hey.. it's their distro, they can do what they want =)
2009-05-09T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	the repositories are still around.. they've just changed the url.. something like oldreleases.ubuntu.com.. I can never remember what the exact address is
2009-05-09T03:56:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	it appears to be LOTS to do to upgrade from 7.04 to the latest version, should I not consider it but instead just get the newest version DVD and install that instead new?
2009-05-09T03:58:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	I would consider reinstalling
2009-05-09T04:00:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	I agree, just I am worried since this is an old drive I mounted long ago and it dual boot for XP 64 also, a reinstall will remove that correct?
2009-05-09T04:00:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	nope.. xp will still be there
2009-05-09T04:01:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	glad we talked about that, then the fresh install will only touch the part of the drive that is running ubuntu x64 correct?
2009-05-09T04:01:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	well.. it will only touch the parts you tell it to touch.. you have to take care what you tell it
2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	correct I'll make sure of the environment first that makes sense
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	I'm not really sure..
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	guycook	Slart	ok well thanks, I'll do some investigating now
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	Slart	guycook	do so, good luck with the reinstall =)
