2009-06-25T11:50:00.000Z	Travo18		warrigal: ahh if i was to create a partition on my laptop of ubuntu and then ghost that image to the drive in my pc do you reckon that that would then be able to load?? does ubuntu run the same way as windows? it just looks for particular files to boot?
2009-06-25T11:50:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	Try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2009-06-25T11:51:00.000Z	Travo18	mobi-sheep	where am i typing this??
2009-06-25T11:52:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	In TTY.
2009-06-25T11:52:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	Remember -- IMPORTANT -- CTRL + ALT + F7.
2009-06-25T11:53:00.000Z	Travo18	mobi-sheep	so do i type this in all or one of these or what
2009-06-25T11:56:00.000Z	Travo18	mobi-sheep	how do i know that it has run??
2009-06-25T11:56:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	If the command didn't display any error messages, then you'll know it work.  You may get some configuration screen though.
2009-06-25T11:57:00.000Z	Travo18	mobi-sheep	it has come up saying like loading hardware drivers and loading kernel module checking file systems is that what it is supposed to do
2009-06-25T11:58:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	It'll ask you configuration questions.  Just answer them best to your knowledge then that is that.
2009-06-25T11:58:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	Then go back to F7 and see if it does work.
2009-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	We're at 9.04 now.
2009-06-25T12:02:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	The chance is that you won't have any issues with X with 9.04.  There were lot of configurations in the old day but almost everything works right away out of the box.  9.04 is around 700MB, I think.
2009-06-25T12:03:00.000Z	Travo18	mobi-sheep	i think it has finished but when i press ctrl+alt+f7 it sends me to a blank screen with a grey flashing cursor
2009-06-25T12:03:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	It's easier and less time-consuming to do a clean install than upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.
2009-06-25T12:04:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	What graphic card?  Old machine?
2009-06-25T12:04:00.000Z	Travo18	mobi-sheep	yeh it is a rather old computer
2009-06-25T12:05:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	I suggest you grab a copy of 9.04 and test it out.  More drivers + more hardware supports, etc etc.
2009-06-25T12:05:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	End of life.  See? :3
2009-06-25T14:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	What was the name of ISO you downloaded?
2009-06-25T14:19:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Travo18	What image did you download? ubuntu-9.04-alternate-amd64.iso?
2009-06-25T14:20:00.000Z	Travo18	mobi-sheep	no it is the normal one it just says ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso
