2010-01-18T10:59:00.000Z	Dishtroyer	keepsake	Oh crud. Now ubuntu won't let me mount drives. It says I'm not authorized
2010-01-18T11:00:00.000Z	keepsake	Dishtroyer	Have you tried reconfiguring xserver-xorg?
2010-01-18T11:01:00.000Z	Dishtroyer	keepsake	I'm as noobie as they come when it comes to linux..
2010-01-18T11:01:00.000Z	keepsake	Dishtroyer	I am too, don't worry. Try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2010-01-18T11:02:00.000Z	Dishtroyer	keepsake	OK I did that.
2010-01-18T11:02:00.000Z	keepsake	Dishtroyer	Did the reconfigure work?
2010-01-18T11:03:00.000Z	keepsake	Dishtroyer	Only one way to find out.
2010-01-18T11:03:00.000Z	keepsake	Dishtroyer	Get used to it =P It's part of using Linux
2010-01-18T11:10:00.000Z	Dishtroyer	keepsake	this is freaky. It wouldn't let me in on the first try but it did on the second..
2010-01-18T11:20:00.000Z	keepsake	Dishtroyer	No problem =) I'm not even really sure what I did =P
