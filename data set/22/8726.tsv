2005-09-30T16:51:00.000Z	Vixus		I need a php/html/text editor that can do FTP load/saves.
2005-09-30T16:51:00.000Z	Vixus		ok
2005-09-30T16:53:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	Emacs can go that too
2005-09-30T16:54:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	the editor with the most functionality is Emacs, but it has quite a steep learning curve
2005-09-30T16:54:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	"C-x (" to start recording, "C-x )" to stop, "C-x e" to playback
2005-09-30T05:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	you need to "sudo apt-get clean" sometimes
2005-09-30T05:01:00.000Z	Vixus	dooglus	Is there any output?
2005-09-30T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	I don't think so
2005-09-30T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	it empties the apt cache
2005-09-30T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	type this: "du -sh /var/cache/apt/archives/" to see how much space it would save you
2005-09-30T05:02:00.000Z	Vixus	dooglus	cool, thanks
2006-11-19T16:49:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	if you have separate partitions for everything in / then you don't need / to be very big at all
2006-11-19T16:50:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	I only have 3.6G for the whole system, including /home, and am only using 3.2G.  I have KDE, GNOME, XFCE4 all installed no problem
2006-11-19T16:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	the point of having a separate partition for /home is that you might well fill up /home, but you don't want to fill up / because it can damage the OS
2006-11-19T16:52:00.000Z	dooglus	Vixus	but no, you don't have to have a separate /home partition, and I don't
