2010-02-16T05:55:00.000Z	titan_ark		hey, i tried adding the ppa for the latest OOo 3.2 and i am getting errors while doing the update, any idea how i can set it right?
2010-02-16T05:55:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	could you start by postbining the errors?
2010-02-16T05:59:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	i get a few ignores for the OOo and then a 404 error. I removed the ppa from the software sources list but even now i get a few Ign for Ign http://ppa.launchpad.net karmic/main Translation-en_US and similar

2010-02-16T06:00:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	huh, I don't know why it would do Ign
2010-02-16T06:01:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	even I cant figure that out
2010-02-16T06:01:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	you're trying to install the latest OO.o?
2010-02-16T06:02:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	well i was, i found a link that said to add the ppa and try but it dint work. and those 404 errors came up which i could clear out after removing the OOo ppa.
2010-02-16T06:02:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	would you know how to install the latest OOo via terminal so that I can get updates
2010-02-16T06:03:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	I wouldn't want to install from source either -- but I haven't tried getting the latest one, only the one in the standard repos
2010-02-16T06:03:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	any particular reason why you want the lastest one?
2010-02-16T06:04:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	why would you not want to install the latest from the source? I am unable to open MS Office's .***x format files
2010-02-16T06:05:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	installing from source can be difficult -- though it's often very easy. Have you tried opening those files up in the standard Open Office?
2010-02-16T06:06:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	Yes I can on my windows box
2010-02-16T06:06:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	what about the version of open office in the standard repositories?
2010-02-16T06:07:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	or is there a way i can uninstall the current OOo and reinstall?
2010-02-16T06:07:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	just a  sec
2010-02-16T06:09:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	to uninstall Open Office and re install it -- the first thing to do would be open Synaptic, and search for Open Office, then remove the ones that are selected
2010-02-16T06:10:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	I need to reboot into ubuntu, brb
2010-02-16T06:10:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	but how would i know which all i need to install, i have tried looking at the list but its huge
2010-02-16T06:10:00.000Z	titan_ark	semitones	okay np
2010-02-19T11:15:00.000Z	semitones	titan_ark	you can also use quotes around the path
