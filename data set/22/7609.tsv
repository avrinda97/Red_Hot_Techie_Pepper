2006-07-16T11:30:00.000Z	Enverex		How easy/hard is it to make a package for ubuntu (of a program obviously)?
2006-07-16T11:32:00.000Z	Enverex		Aww crap, the Ubuntu DesktopCD and Alternate CDs neither see my RAID properly, they just see both drives individually, can anyone help?
2006-07-16T11:34:00.000Z	Enverex		So much for friendly distro
2006-07-16T11:35:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	onboard raid?
2007-04-25T16:53:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	this is where you realize why everyone recommends using a separate home partition
2007-04-25T16:53:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	heh, true
2007-04-25T16:56:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	I'd split the partitions but then I wouldn't be sure how much to use for each then murphys law says I'd make one too small
2007-04-25T16:59:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	Isn't it just infiniately easier just to put / and home on the same?
2007-04-25T16:59:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	no, it's infinitely more difficult. i usually use 5 to 10gb for OS partitions and it never causes me any trouble.
2007-04-26T15:16:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	/lib32/libdl.so.1 is in libc6-i386
2007-04-26T15:17:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	I have that package installed :/
2007-04-26T15:20:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	I have libdl.so.2 but not .1 :/
2007-04-26T15:22:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	eh.. try a symlink :] 
2007-04-26T15:23:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	Change in .x normally indicates an ABI change doesn't it?
2007-04-26T15:23:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	ah, i just realized i have libdl.so.2. i seem to remember i had the same problem originally and created the symlink.
2007-04-26T15:23:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	i doubt there are significant abi breaking changes in libdl. dlopen, dlclose, not much to break ;)
2007-04-26T15:26:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	This just goes on and on, I'm on like the third one now :/
2007-04-26T15:29:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	nspluginwrapper is a mess really, but there's no alternative if you need flash :/
2007-04-26T15:30:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	What ****es me off is how there are a few zealots on the amd64 Ubuntu forum that harp on about how it's so easy and Flash isn't a problem on AMD64 >.<
2007-04-26T15:31:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	well, once it's setup it just works. didn't experience any crashes or other quirks, so i'm quite happy with it. adobe should just compile a real 64bit flash, of course.
2007-04-26T15:39:00.000Z	Enverex	void^	Hit a wall, it's asking for a lib I don't have now (libmlib)
2007-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	void^	Enverex	strange, the only remotely similar thing my flashplayer.so uses is libm.so.6
