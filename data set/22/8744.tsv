2005-06-15T06:14:00.000Z	Hajuu		Im using wine and trying to install Warcraft 3.. but it says windows 95 isnt supported.. how can I make it think im using a higher grade of windows? (98 or above)
2005-06-15T06:15:00.000Z	Firetech	Hajuu	run "winesetup"
2005-06-15T06:16:00.000Z	Hajuu		no it doesnt but it works in cedega
2005-06-15T06:16:00.000Z	Hajuu		but cedega isnt for installing stuff
2005-06-15T06:17:00.000Z	Firetech	Hajuu	you can't install it in wine and then use it in cedega (in an easy way), you CAN install it using cedega.
2005-06-15T06:17:00.000Z	Firetech		But using grapevine (free) or Point2Play (not free, comes with cedega) is even easier
2005-06-15T06:19:00.000Z	Hajuu		mmm cedega is all screwy
2005-06-15T06:19:00.000Z	Hajuu		ill try doing it natively with wine
2005-06-15T06:19:00.000Z	Firetech	Hajuu	how do you plan to play it in cedega if you install it with wine?
2005-06-15T06:20:00.000Z	Hajuu		How do you mean?
2005-06-15T06:20:00.000Z	Hajuu		Warcraft 3 doesnt even need registry entries or anything..
2005-06-15T06:20:00.000Z	Hajuu		no, it doesn't.
2005-06-15T06:20:00.000Z	Hajuu		I am certain of it.
2005-06-15T06:20:00.000Z	Firetech		You try to install it in WINE but then use it in cedega... They don't use the same fake_windows folder.
2005-06-15T06:21:00.000Z	Hajuu		I understand
2005-06-15T06:21:00.000Z	Hajuu		But you ignored what I said.
2005-06-15T06:21:00.000Z	Hajuu		It doesnt require the registry entries.
2005-06-15T06:22:00.000Z	Hajuu		It is. I used to copy it across my windows network and play it on computers completely free of its registry entries.
2005-06-15T06:22:00.000Z	Hajuu	psychonate	 I am not alking about cedega doesnt need its registry. I am saying the game doesn't.
2005-06-15T06:24:00.000Z	Hajuu		Why? if it doesnt need the registry, what other logical reason is there for it not to work?
2005-06-15T06:25:00.000Z	Firetech	Hajuu	You have to atleast move it
