2006-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	rabbit		Whenever I boot my wireless doesn't work until I 'deactivate' and then 'activate' my wlan connection     (before I also had to do "iwconfig wlan0 mode managed"  but I put that in a startup script)
2006-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	rabbit		what's the easiest/best way to update firefox?
2006-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	to 1.5?
2006-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	yeah
2006-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	It won
2006-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	and I will tell you WHY
2006-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	whaat?
2006-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	A lot of packages depend on Firefox for HTML rendering, CSS, etc. So upgrading Firefox touches more packages than you would think
2006-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	 so I shouldn't touch it?  just wait for the ubuntu update?
2006-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	you can...install alongside the Breezy Firefox
2006-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	arg..  I shouldn't update firefox?
2006-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	that method will basically put two versions of Firefox on your system
2006-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	the link spiregrain gave says it's not recommended, (as you said, it breaks some things)
2006-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	yah
2006-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	 so I'll avoid it
2006-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	unless there is some killer thing you need in 1.5, I'd stick with 1.0.7
2006-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	when you update ubuntu it updates firefox?
2006-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	yah
2006-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	rabbit	Kyral	is there a difference between windows and linux firefox profiles? can I migrate my windows profile to here?
2006-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	I don't know I haven't touched windows in over 6 months
2006-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	some of them are
2006-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	Kyral	rabbit	mainly if they interface with a windows program
