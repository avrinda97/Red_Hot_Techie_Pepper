2009-07-01T11:29:00.000Z	painted		hey folks, i'm using smplayer and i get slightly visible horizontal tears when there's a lot of action on the video, can anyone help?  I really love ubuntu but not if i can't play video right... :(
2009-07-01T11:30:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	i get the same thing as well
2009-07-01T11:30:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	what care are you running/
2009-07-01T11:30:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	card
2009-07-01T11:32:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	i've had this problem for a long time, finally gave up on fixing it, but it seems to get better as the drivers improve
2009-07-01T11:33:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	sniff..... it's a video card driver issue?  find it hard to believe ubuntu can't even play video right
2009-07-01T11:33:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	it's an nvidia issue with not providing drivers that work
2009-07-01T11:34:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	so ATI cards play video fine?
2009-07-01T11:34:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	I had a nice ati before this nvidia - it had other issues, but the playback was slightly better
2009-07-01T11:35:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	this is really frustrating....
2009-07-01T11:36:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	even crappy intel integrated gpu doesn't have a problem with video playback
2009-07-01T11:36:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	video works great on windows 7 = /
2009-07-01T11:36:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	yeah, but it's still windows
2009-07-01T11:37:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	yeah but video playback is important to me... sniff
2009-07-01T11:37:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	i'd rather deal with slightly bad video playback before using that.  I did just install FF3.5 and HD videos from vimeo seem to have a much smoother playback
2009-07-01T11:39:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	i'm not having a problem with flash video play back... it's with xvid/h264/mpeg files
2009-07-01T11:39:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	I have it w/ that also, just noting that flash did improve with new ff
2009-07-01T11:40:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	which I guess is better than having neither working well
2009-07-01T11:40:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	yeah but i'd rather bite the bullet and just use an OS that has flawless video playback
2009-07-01T11:41:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	have you tried virtualbox at all?  I wonder if you could get better playback in a virtual windows7 or if it's the same
2009-07-01T11:41:00.000Z	painted	poocorner	i tried running kmplayer thru wine, it barely worked = /
2009-07-01T11:46:00.000Z	poocorner	painted	nope the same - bad scaling issues
