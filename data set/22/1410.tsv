2010-06-18T00:05:00.000Z	Benkinooby		hi, i installed bootchart. after uninstalling it (aptitude) i still see some bootchart processes being terminated during boot up
2010-06-18T00:05:00.000Z	Benkinooby		how can i fix this (completely remove bootchart)?
2010-06-18T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	sudo aptitude purge bootchart ?
2010-06-18T00:07:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	thx. it did "something"... let me see the result.... i'll be back ;)
2010-07-25T15:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	are you memeber of plugdev and fuse?
2010-07-25T15:35:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	yes
2010-07-25T15:36:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	~$ groups [username] adm dialout cdrom plugdev fuse lpadmin admin sambashare
2010-10-06T20:24:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	hwo do i check if i am cloaked?
2010-10-06T20:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	17:24 -!- Benkinooby [~Benkinoob@unaffiliated/benkinooby]
2010-10-06T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	get a cloak in #freenode
2010-10-06T20:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	join the channel and ask politely for an unaffiliated cloak. that way the ip is hidden
2010-10-06T20:09:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	Dr_Willis thank you. seems to be a far easier (->better) solution than a proxy
2010-10-06T20:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	no problem
2010-10-06T20:25:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	how do you do that?
2010-10-18T13:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	becouse runlevel 0 has been shutdown traditionaly and rl 1 single user ( with all servises down )
2010-10-18T13:44:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	ok, thank you! when i want to modyfy my bootup beahvior (i don't want gui login) i have to work within these folders by renaming/creating files with required names. i might use update-rc.d to hae it a bit easier
2010-10-18T13:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	no; there are tools to manage all of that for you. and anyway now that ubunu uses upstart all those things about runlevels are obsolete in many ways
2010-10-18T13:46:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	ah, this might be also the reason why it sometimes complains about some scripts during boot and that they are obsolete. thank you for the upstart hint. considering the tools, i want to do as much as possible from hand to understand the system better.
2010-10-18T13:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	to make the system start without gui you can disable the /etc/init/gdm.conf or add textmode or text ( forgot exactly what ) to grub's kernel options ( /etc/default/grub )
2010-10-18T13:50:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	i was allready reading something in that direction but for some methods it was pointed out that the service might be running in the background but not used
2010-10-18T13:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Benkinooby	correct. you can have a ssh server running and use it only once a week ;P
2010-10-18T13:54:00.000Z	Benkinooby	erUSUL	what i wanted to say is that some ways of disableing services at startup are not disableing them but only hiding them. e.g the boot up splash screen can be hidden with ctrl-alt-bksp during boot up.
