2007-06-26T16:47:00.000Z	rgl		I've installed ubuntu, but when it tries to boot from HD nothing happens... can you guys help me out troubleshoot this?
2007-06-26T16:47:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	did you install boot mgr like grub
2007-06-26T16:48:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	the normal install did install grub.  but nothing happears, no prompt at all :|
2007-06-26T16:49:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	did you set hd boot priority in BIOS
2007-06-26T16:49:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	yes, I did.
2007-06-26T16:49:00.000Z	Zyxus		rdl do you have dual boot on this hd
2007-06-26T16:50:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	nope.  I've got this: http://pastie.caboo.se/73405
2007-06-26T16:51:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	I'm using a /boot partition on the first HD.  then, I'm using LVM on the two HD.
2007-06-26T16:52:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	LVM boot disk is problematic... never messed with LVM on boot
2007-06-26T16:52:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	I got /boot on a non-LVM partition
2007-06-26T16:54:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	you installed grub to sda
2007-06-26T16:55:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	ubuntu install does that, no?
2007-06-26T16:56:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	if there is not boot loader, the BIOS halts with a message, no?
2007-06-26T16:56:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	sometimes it just hangs
2007-06-26T16:56:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	without a message at all?
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	run live cd and then install grub to sda1
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	yes i have had no grub in MBR and it just hangs..no msg
2007-06-26T16:58:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	you can run grub-install or from cmd line run grub
2007-06-26T16:59:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	I'll try to install it.  its just grub-install /dev/sda ?
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	Zyxus	rgl	grub-install to sdaX and root=/dev/sdaY
2007-06-26T05:03:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	sorry?  like this: grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/sda
2007-06-26T05:14:00.000Z	rgl	Zyxus	oh.  I've installed grub, but no luck.  man, from the livecd I can access the disk, etc.  but no boot :-(
