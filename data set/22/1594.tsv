2010-05-17T12:49:00.000Z	lambrecht		anyone can help me  i have ubuntu server 9.10 and some services dont start but they are configured to start
2010-05-17T12:50:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	might help to say which don't start
2010-05-17T12:51:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	and why do you think they are set to start?
2010-05-17T12:52:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	are there links for them in  /etc/rc2.d?
2010-05-17T12:54:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	what does   sudo /etc/init.d/apache start   return?
2010-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	it is   sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
2010-05-17T12:56:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	it is a path to the link   /etc/init.d/apache2 start
2010-05-17T12:58:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	it might still run - do   ps aux | grep apache
2010-05-17T13:01:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	so it is running - in /etc/rc2.d   does the apache link have a k or s at the begginning?
2010-05-17T13:10:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	afaik those services should be in the 2nd runlevel - run sysvinit-rc-conf again and check pls
2010-05-17T13:25:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	nothing in there to indicate why you have your trouble
2010-05-17T13:29:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	nothing in there to indicate why you have your trouble
2010-05-17T13:30:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	but it wouldn't show apps not starting - that ubuntuforums link suggested editing a file - did you do that?
2010-05-17T13:31:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	when did this prob start?
2010-05-17T13:32:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	you could try an apt-get update && upgrade maybe
2010-05-17T13:33:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	yep :]

2010-05-17T13:35:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	is there a file   /etc/inittab   ?
2010-05-17T13:40:00.000Z	gottto	lambrecht	it sure is strange
