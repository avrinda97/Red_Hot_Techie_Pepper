2006-02-26T13:30:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	sudo dpk-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-02-26T13:31:00.000Z	exxpert	ompaul	is that really just the resloution of the startup?
2006-02-26T13:32:00.000Z	exxpert	ompaul	you know then ubuntu is starting up and loads things..
2006-02-26T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	ahh
2006-02-26T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	let me look that one up I think you can do something with it
2006-02-26T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	you have to be able to, because the live CDs all offer different font sizes
2006-02-26T13:36:00.000Z	exxpert	ompaul	Sure thing! when i installed, i got to choose between "VGA" and many other resolutions.. the first install i did when things died i got 1280x1024 in the whole install and startup,, then i messed it up and installed again and forgotten to choose 1280x1024, just VGA and now ots booting in 640x480

2006-02-26T13:37:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	not a normal question, however for X that command I gave you works, well your asking and I know it must be possible I am just trying to find the syntax that impacts it - I can't even get a command yet - but hey it will come
2006-02-26T13:39:00.000Z	exxpert	ompaul	I know..:-),,tricky,, thanks for helping me out..:-)
2006-02-26T13:44:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	well you got me stumped, I have tried booting a live CD there a moment ago (if you have the ram for it qemu -cdrom file.iso) and I have gone through the menu nothing jumped out at me
2006-02-26T13:45:00.000Z	exxpert	ompaul	i give up!:-),, thanks for your efforts!
2006-02-26T13:46:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	if it was a dog it would have bitten us
2006-02-26T13:47:00.000Z	ompaul	exxpert	on the development version it works like this press F3 right at the beginning if that impacts an already older and installed system I have no idea
