2006-12-18T06:22:00.000Z	un_operateur1		 deb http://deb.opera.com/opera etch non-free
2006-12-18T06:22:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	you might not want to do that - library differences
2006-12-18T06:23:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	there are no differences here  -- the only candidate that matters for opera is non-free
2006-12-18T06:23:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	as in : http://deb.opera.com/opera/pool/non-free/o/opera/
2006-12-18T06:23:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	the Qt libraries could be different.
2006-12-18T06:23:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	but they arent
2006-12-18T06:24:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	and opera doesnt maintain Qt
2006-12-18T06:24:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	maybe not today, but tomorrow maybe - better to get the Ubuntu debs from opera.com. Mixing Debian and Ubuntu reps in general is risky.
2006-12-18T06:24:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	which has what relevance?
2006-12-18T06:25:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	there is no relevance -- there is only one candidate that opera maintains i.e. non-free -- its the same used in debian or ubuntu -- and opera doesnt maintain any libraries Qt or otherwise -- as for relevance, you tell em
2006-12-18T06:26:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	it *uses* Qt.
2006-12-18T06:26:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	or do you think that it has no dependencies?
2006-12-18T06:26:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	and you get libqt-xx from your ubuntu/debian repos not operas :)
2006-12-18T06:27:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	my point exactly, it could have significant differences.
2006-12-18T06:27:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	if you want to risk running multiple distro repositories, go ahead, but if you recommend it to someone else don't expect me to not mention the problems in doing that.
2006-12-18T06:27:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	why dont you head on over to opera's pool and see how many packages they maintain -- and whether they maintain different packages for ubuntu and debian
2006-12-18T06:27:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	they do on opera.com
2006-12-18T06:28:00.000Z	un_operateur1	EdLin	I am talking about opera's own repo -- http://deb.opera.com/opera/pool/
2006-12-18T06:28:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	yes, but it specificially has an etch tag.
2006-12-18T06:29:00.000Z	un_operateur1		Edlin, which has no effect really becuase there are no etch or edgy packages on that repo
2006-12-18T06:29:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	that's true, because it gets the dependencies from the normal etch repos
2006-12-18T06:30:00.000Z	EdLin	un_operateur1	I think I've spent enough time arguing about mixing Debian and Ubuntu repos before breakfast... :-)
