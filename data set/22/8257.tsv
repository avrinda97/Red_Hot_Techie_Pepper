2005-12-09T17:40:00.000Z	eobanb		if i wanted to boot from /dev/hdd, what would be the root entry in grub?
2005-12-09T06:03:00.000Z	eobanb		is there any way to install windows after an ubuntu install without wiping grub from the mbr?
2005-12-09T06:04:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	if you have multiple hdd's yes.
2005-12-09T06:06:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	i do
2005-12-09T06:07:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	set bios to boot the other disk and install win then set bios back.
2005-12-09T06:08:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	it is not that hard to reinstall grub after a windows install tho
2005-12-30T13:45:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	pico is a link to nano on ub.
2005-12-30T13:45:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	right.  i meant the real pico.
2005-12-30T13:48:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	every *nix system i have ever seen, ever, has had vi.
2005-12-30T13:49:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	what operating systems?
2005-12-30T13:52:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	if it installed vi and you uninstalled it, that doesnt count..
2005-12-30T14:00:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	it will slow gnome down noticably if the network is not what gnome thinks it should be.   i have seen that.
2005-12-30T14:09:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	it seems like he would have noticed an overdrive problem as soon as x started
2005-12-30T14:10:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	no you can push the monitors limits for long enough to cause premature failure.
2005-12-30T14:10:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	eh maybe, seems like that would only happen with really old hardware though.
2006-02-25T09:54:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	i could do it with one disk.....  but it would require tons of time.
2006-06-01T13:03:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	arguably
2006-06-01T13:05:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	so if i try to hack your box and i use user name eoban  and you have used sudo in the last 15 minutes i have full root access ?
2006-06-01T13:06:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	first of all the box i'm running on right now is a powerbook with mac os x.  second of all, you'd have to know my user's password.  third of all, i'm not running ssh on here.  fourth i've changed sudo's config to be five minutes instead of 15
2006-06-01T13:06:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	but you're welcome to try anyway...
2006-06-01T13:07:00.000Z	intelikey	eobanb	i'm no hacker.   but you pointed out that, you do not use the 'default' sudo setup.    that's all i was about.  the default is not more secure.
2006-06-01T13:08:00.000Z	eobanb	intelikey	then again, ubuntu doesnt run sshd by default, so i think the point is fairly moot.  if you care to discuss it more i'm in #ubuntu-offtopic
