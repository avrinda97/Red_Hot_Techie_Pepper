2004-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	pdaoust		LifeSizeKenDoll: wow, this is a confusing command. does it allow me to specify an editor like nano instead of vim, or does it just allow me to specify a different location for vim?
2004-11-23T11:49:00.000Z	pdaoust		LifeSizeKenDoll: (i.e., does the replacement program have to be VI-compatible?)
2004-11-23T11:51:00.000Z	pdaoust		oho! I see... I took a look in the /etc/alternatives directory and it has a bunhc of symlinks... so I use update-alternatives to change the location of those symlinks, eh?
2004-11-23T11:51:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	yes.
2004-11-23T11:51:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	oooh. In for a treat (and some frustration initially)
2004-11-23T11:52:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	you owe yourself to check the debian documentation. There's a policy document, which gives a lot of background info
2004-11-23T11:52:00.000Z	pdaoust	ermo	I like it already. Moved from Gentoo, which I stuck with for so long because of its lovely package manager. But after a hard drive crash, I had to get everything up and running as quickly as possible. So I checked out Ubuntu, because it was all the rave and I wanted something apt-based (it was a toss-up between Fedora and Ubuntu)
2004-11-23T11:52:00.000Z	pdaoust	ermo	I sure like not having to compile my packages ^_^
2004-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	funny. Sounds like we have the same pattern of usage.
2004-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	pdaoust	ermo	really? are you an ex-Gentooer?
2004-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	was considering fedora too. Haven't used gentoo for a while...
2004-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	yes.
2004-11-23T11:53:00.000Z	pdaoust	ermo	cool. So why did you choose Ubuntu over Fedora?
2004-11-23T11:54:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	I've used debian on my servers for years.
2004-11-23T11:54:00.000Z	pdaoust	ermo	so it was just more familiar then.
2004-11-23T11:54:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	i'm used to the layout, the package tools, the administration model.
2004-11-23T11:54:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	in a sense yes.
2004-11-23T11:55:00.000Z	pdaoust	ermo	so here's another question: why did you choose Ubuntu over, say, MEPIS? (I guess the real question here is: do you prefer GNOME over KDE?)
2004-11-23T11:55:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	I'm a gnomer, yes. Ever since I grasped the vision of gnome2 and the people dedicated to that project, I was a goner.
2004-11-23T11:57:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	guess you could say that the gnome philosophy appeals to me.
2004-11-23T11:59:00.000Z	pdaoust	ermo	yeah, same here... I like the 'Just Works' philosophy (if I had the money, I'd buy a Mac)... I guess I'm sick and tired of thirteen zillion different tools for the job.
2004-11-23T11:59:00.000Z	ermo	pdaoust	lol. I could've said that, verbatim.
