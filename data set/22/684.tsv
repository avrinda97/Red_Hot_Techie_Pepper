2011-07-27T00:19:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2		anyone here a crontab expert? I can't seem to get any of my crontabs to run
2011-07-27T00:20:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	man crontab.
2011-07-27T00:20:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	take a look at the existing ones in /etc/cron.*
2011-07-27T00:21:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	tdn	I have looked, everything seems fine.
2011-07-27T00:23:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	paste the crontab you are trying to get to work.
2011-07-27T00:23:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	do you install your crontab using crontab -e ?
2011-07-27T00:23:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	if it is a user crontab, you should not specify the user in the crontab.
2011-07-27T00:24:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	tdn	I do crontab -e
2011-07-27T00:25:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	paste your crontab here: http://p.adora.dk
2011-07-27T00:26:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	ok. Do this: add this line:  * * * * * date >> /tmp/crontest
2011-07-27T00:26:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	did you do that?
2011-07-27T00:27:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	then quit editor to install crontab.
2011-07-27T00:29:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	tdn	the file was made but is empty
2011-07-27T00:31:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	tdn	I am getting permission denied errors
2011-07-27T00:32:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	when quitting editor after crontab -e?
2011-07-27T00:33:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	tdn	no, it sent mail to my /var/mail/root file
2011-07-27T00:34:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	ok. Is /tmp world writable?
2011-07-27T00:34:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	tdn	it says the script is denied. How can anything be denied to root?
2011-07-27T00:35:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	which script?
2011-07-27T00:35:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	please use the line I wrote above.
2011-07-27T00:35:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	check permissions on your script /opt/scripts/sqlBackup.cron
2011-07-27T00:36:00.000Z	tdn	Snicers-Work2	if it is to be executed, yes.
