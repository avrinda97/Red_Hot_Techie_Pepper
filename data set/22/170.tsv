2012-04-30T12:00:00.000Z	shani0610		umm can anybody tell me the problem here, I need to find out why unity is not loading... here is the link: http://paste.ubuntu.com/956878/
2012-04-30T12:01:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	did it work before?
2012-04-30T12:01:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Did unity ever work before?
2012-04-30T12:02:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	It seems that your computer doesn't support unity. Use unity 2d.
2012-04-30T12:03:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	At the login screen, change the session to unity 2d
2012-04-30T12:03:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	or you can launch it from a command line with the command unity-2d --replace
2012-04-30T12:04:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	then install with apt-get. sudo apt-get install unity-2d
2012-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Are you still there?
2012-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Install unity-2d with apt-get install unity-2d
2012-04-30T12:12:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	are you root?
2012-04-30T12:14:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	run apt-get install unity-2d-launcher unity-2d-panel unity-2d-places unity-2d-spread unity-2d
2012-04-30T12:15:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Try upgrading to ubuntu 11.10, it comes with unity 2d preinstalled.
2012-04-30T12:17:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	I think you can upgrade from the command line with apt-get dist-upgrade
2012-04-30T12:21:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	No, they can both be installed, it seems you have a strange system. Would you be willing to upgrade to 11.10?
2012-04-30T12:22:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Then upgrade to 11.10, which comes with unity-2d.
2012-04-30T12:23:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	If you get 12.04 you get unity 2d.
2012-04-30T12:24:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Good luck!
2012-04-30T12:25:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	unity uses a 3d redering engine whereas 2d doesn't, so yes.
2012-04-30T12:27:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	your original dump said your graphics card wasn't good enough.
2012-04-30T12:27:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Unity 2d works on everything :)
2012-04-30T12:29:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	Your welcome, and good luck!
2012-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	neattoast	shani0610	It isn't usually all that safe to upgrade packages mannually, but I would say (I don't know apt-get very well) apt-get install libgcc
