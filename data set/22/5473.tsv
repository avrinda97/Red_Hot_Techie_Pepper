2007-09-10T13:02:00.000Z	eyec0n	kostkon	thanks for answering my question
2007-09-10T13:03:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	add medibuntu to your repositories list
2007-09-10T13:03:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	http://medibuntu.org/ you will find istructions there
2007-09-10T13:03:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	then from synaptic install ffmpeg
2007-09-10T13:03:00.000Z	eyec0n	kostkon	I found it :)
2007-09-10T13:04:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	then search for a gui for ffmpeg, i recommend a simple one, like WiFF, search google to find it
2007-09-10T13:04:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	w8, the version from the official repos it does not have support for many proprietary format activated
2007-09-10T13:05:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	you have to get the medibuntu version
2007-09-10T13:05:00.000Z	eyec0n	kostkon	I got ya... i'm on the medibuntu site reading the howto...
2007-09-10T13:06:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	ok!
2007-09-10T13:08:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	don't worry adding medibuntu to your sources list. it's a safe repository, it has a semi-official status anyway
2007-09-10T13:09:00.000Z	eyec0n	kostkon	believe me i'm not worried about it man
2007-09-10T13:09:00.000Z	kostkon	eyec0n	ok
