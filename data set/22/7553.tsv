2006-03-15T07:38:00.000Z	mikebot		is there a way /in ubuntu/ (so this is not off topic) to make it so the people watching my network wont be able to tell that i'm torrenting?
2006-03-15T07:40:00.000Z	rukuartic	mikebot	best not to bittorrent in universities
2006-03-15T07:40:00.000Z	mikebot	rukuartic	ah, but the other p2p stuff for ubuntu isn't very good...soulseek for windows orked very well, but for some reason nicotine sucks

2006-03-15T07:48:00.000Z	mikebot	rukuartic	probably, yeah
2006-03-15T07:49:00.000Z	rukuartic	mikebot	dpkg -list | grep nicotine
2006-03-15T07:50:00.000Z	rukuartic	mikebot	Sorry, its actually dpkg -l | grep nicotine
