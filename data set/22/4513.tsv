2007-12-18T11:07:00.000Z	fregger		alt F2 isnt opening anything
2007-12-18T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	try clt-alt-f1 , do you get a text console?
2007-12-18T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	that was a test to see if your machine was frozen
2007-12-18T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	are your borders still gon?
2007-12-18T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	are you running compiz?
2007-12-18T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	and finally, are you typing in the gui right now?
2007-12-18T11:16:00.000Z	fregger	nickrud	yes
2007-12-18T11:16:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	do you see the panel? does it respond at all?
2007-12-18T11:16:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	for example, the applications menu
2007-12-18T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	ok, press alt-f2 , you should get a run dialog box. If you don't see it, look in the window list
2007-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	ok, type metacity --replace
2007-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	in the box, of course :)
2007-12-18T11:18:00.000Z	fregger	nickrud	your a god
2007-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	fregger	nickrud	thanks a lot man. kudos
2007-12-18T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	yw
2007-12-18T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	I don't have a clue how to fix that, it just suddenly started working for me one day
2007-12-18T11:27:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	yes, I'd just do the alt-f2  compiz --replace   dance
2007-12-18T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	lol,
2007-12-18T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	what conflict?
2007-12-18T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	ok, try sudo aptitude install emerald compizconfig-settings-manager , when that's done try alt-f2   compiz --replace  &&  emerald --replace  (that will start compiz, and start up the emerald theme manager)
2007-12-18T11:39:00.000Z	nickrud	fregger	then I'm not sure what your problem is, but something isn't right with your compiz. I've pretty much told you everything I know
