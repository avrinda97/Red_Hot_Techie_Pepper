2006-08-17T10:08:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	how old is "hoary"?
2006-08-17T10:08:00.000Z	DBO	nopcode	about a year
2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	ic.. how do i upgrade to dapper drake? just change the apt-sources?
2006-08-17T10:09:00.000Z	DBO	nopcode	it would be faster to reinstall if thats not an issue, otherwise you have to upgrade to breezy-badgery, then to dapper-drake
2006-08-17T10:10:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	can't, it's a remote server
2006-08-17T10:10:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	ok, how do i upgrade then?
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	DBO	nopcode	the bot has sent you a message with the concept
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	ok thanks
2006-08-17T10:12:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	that update manager thing... i'll still need to do the other stuff before?
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	DBO	nopcode	basically you need to change your sources from hoary to breezy, then upgrade
2006-08-17T10:13:00.000Z	DBO	nopcode	once you are all up to date for breezy, you need to change your sources agian to dapper, and upgrade again
2006-08-17T10:19:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	It is recommended that you have the "ubuntu-desktop", "kubuntu-desktop", or "edubuntu-desktop" metapackage (depending on which distribution you're running exactly) in order to ensure that you have the full set of default packages.
2006-08-17T10:19:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	hm, why would i have to install gui stuff on a remote server :|
2006-08-17T10:19:00.000Z	DBO	nopcode	you can ignore that
2006-08-19T06:31:00.000Z	nopcode	DBO	could you join #foobar? i have a question
2006-08-19T06:31:00.000Z	DBO	nopcode	im there
