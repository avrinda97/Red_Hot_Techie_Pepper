2011-10-18T19:22:00.000Z	fritsch	g0bl1n	you could try: unity --reset
2011-10-18T19:23:00.000Z	fritsch	g0bl1n	this reset everything to default
2011-10-18T19:23:00.000Z	g0bl1n	fritsch	is unity --reset safe ? :-)

2011-10-18T19:25:00.000Z	g0bl1n	fritsch	yes, but installing indicator-datetime made me install evolution libraries
