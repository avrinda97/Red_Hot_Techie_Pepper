2012-04-03T14:20:00.000Z	Tradie96		i need help with a ubuntu live usb install
2012-04-03T14:22:00.000Z	Tradie96		can anyone help with ubuntu live install not finding my harddrives
2012-04-03T14:22:00.000Z	Tradie96		no i cant
2012-04-03T14:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	in live boot sudo fdisk -l ;  does that show any drives like sda or sdb ?
2012-04-03T14:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	is it like an eeepc or some notebook with solid state disks?
2012-04-03T14:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	oh but fdisk -l ; should have show the un mounted disks also,  maybe the disks are scsi drives,  oh how about look at sudo lshw
2012-04-03T14:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	if we might take a peak at the sudo lshw | pastebinit ;  might help ,  you will have to install pastebinit to do that,
2012-04-03T14:35:00.000Z	Tradie96	sacarlson	how do i install pastebinit
2012-04-03T14:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	apt-get install pastebinit
2012-04-03T14:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	oh so no network connection?  can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
2012-04-03T14:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	ok and how about the same for our sudo lshw;  pastebin that if posible
2012-04-03T14:41:00.000Z	Tradie96	sacarlson	pastebin it all?
2012-04-03T14:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	sure why not
2012-04-03T14:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	I see a sata disk controler but no disks on it are seen
2012-04-03T14:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	I'm not sure try reboot and see if they return?   maybe try another sata port for the drives
2012-04-03T14:48:00.000Z	Tradie96	sacarlson	ive rebooted multiple multiple times, and nothing has changed, ive tried changing ports also. i think ill go to bios and see what mode the harddrives are in
2012-04-03T14:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	I don't see anyone having any problems with that sata controler in linux or ubuntu,  I have no idea
2012-04-03T14:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	that shouldn't stop it from being seen
2012-04-03T14:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	yes a software raid could cause a problem
2012-04-03T14:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	but most of those are also supported as they run in bios I think
2012-04-03T14:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	Tradie96	yes I would think they should still see something
2012-04-03T14:53:00.000Z	Tradie96	sacarlson	im using a live usb
