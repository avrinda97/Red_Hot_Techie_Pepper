2007-09-20T07:44:00.000Z	Jeruvy		how come when I right click on a folder and select properties and then permission then change the permissions, 'nothing happens'???
2007-09-20T07:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	Do you have permission to change those permissions?  Are you using gksodu nautilus or something to get root access?
2007-09-20T07:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	gksudo nautilus                       but be careful .. big tools make for big mistakes
2007-09-20T07:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	What permissions does it say the folder has now
2007-09-20T07:49:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	read only
2008-05-14T21:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	yes...
2008-05-14T21:31:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	thanks
2008-05-14T21:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	firestarter is not a firewall..  it is an iptable manager.
2008-05-14T21:34:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	I understand that, but is there anything better?
2008-05-14T21:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	guarddog perhaps, or just learn how to setup iptable manually
2008-05-14T21:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	are you trying to do something specific, or is this a Windows HAngover..
2008-05-14T21:35:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	I've used lokkit.  I can also use iptables directly via python.  But its not for me :)
2008-05-14T21:36:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	I have a desktop to give out and they didn't like firestarter.  I don't think my choices are very good so I'm seeking alternates
2008-05-14T21:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	Perhaps you are not explaining it to them well enough .  Most new users are less safe with firestarter or any iptable manager than if they just let the system take care of things by itself
2008-06-20T18:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	did you check the list of supported hardware to make sure your printer was in there and if people were having problems
2008-06-20T18:43:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	well I'm not sure, the drivers are official for hardy, they install fine, but they do not print and I encounter another error with the doc queue as noted.
2008-06-20T19:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	what make and model of brother printer

2009-01-12T21:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	that bcm43 xx chipset seems to have endless revisions/versions
2009-01-12T21:54:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	oh, it's that damn b43 chipset.  That explains a bunch.
2009-01-12T21:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jeruvy	not for  sure.. but highly suspect that it is
2009-01-31T23:16:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Jack_Sparrow	breaking stuff would be my guess :)
