2007-06-08T05:53:00.000Z	waterloo		ok so very quickly.....the extended partition is a 20gig fat32 with a logical drive of the same sie in it......and there's 20gigs of free space....where i can't create more than two partitions....deleting the extended partition is not an option cuz i have data i need there
2007-06-08T05:53:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	make the extended partition (but not the logical partiion inside) bigger
2007-06-08T06:00:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	do you have gparted?
2007-06-08T06:00:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	well that uses gparted for the normal installer so thats fine
2007-06-08T06:02:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	im just checking
2007-06-08T06:04:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	you can move sda2 to the beginning of the drive
2007-06-08T06:05:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	then move sda5 back as far as poss and expand it to get the free space inside the extended partition then make new logical partitions in the extended partition at the end fo the drive
2007-06-08T06:05:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	of course - backup first
2007-06-08T06:22:00.000Z	waterloo	hjmills	u there?
2007-06-08T06:23:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	am now,
2007-06-08T06:28:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	you shouldn't need to change mountpoints or anything, just move the partitions about on disk
2007-06-08T06:28:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	its a bit like the hanoi towers puzzle i guess
2007-06-08T06:29:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	also, if you address your messages to me (type my name at the beginning of the message) my irc client will make sure I notice the message
2007-06-08T06:29:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	try right clicking on it
2007-06-08T06:29:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	you are using the desktop installer (gui), not the alternate (text) installer
2007-06-08T06:30:00.000Z	waterloo	hjmills	yes desktop
2007-06-08T06:31:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	hmmm - maybe the gparted installer used in the desktop cd is limited in functionality
2007-06-08T06:31:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	try edit
2007-06-08T06:33:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	that will sort it
2007-06-08T06:33:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/documentation.php
2007-06-08T06:34:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	I have to go eat lunch now but other people should be able to help you if you need more help
2007-06-08T06:34:00.000Z	hjmills	waterloo	that site should help guide you through gparted
