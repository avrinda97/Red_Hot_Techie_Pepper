2010-10-27T02:06:00.000Z	commodoor		what are the benefits of puting home directory in a different partition?
2010-10-27T02:06:00.000Z	commodoor		does a reinstall overwright the home directory?
2010-10-27T02:07:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	if it is not on a separate partition - yes
2010-10-27T02:09:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	look at the link you got from ubottu
2010-10-27T02:09:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	reading it thnx
2010-10-27T02:14:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	ubottu how much should i give the system is 100Gb enough?
2010-10-27T02:15:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	ubottu is a bot :-)
2010-10-27T02:15:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	lol didn't know haha
2010-10-27T02:16:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	ah see it now
2010-10-27T02:16:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	but 100Gb is enough ? i have 500Gb so the rest is for home
2010-10-27T02:16:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	lets say, use 20 GB for the system, the rest for /home  --- if you choose tu use LVM it will be more flexible
2010-10-27T02:17:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	i'm gonna use home encrypted because it's my laptop so if it's get stolen i know i will be safe
2010-10-27T02:18:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	100GB for the system is probably too much, especially on a laptop
2010-10-27T02:19:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	in that case take a look at http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7568/1.html about encrypted home dir
2010-10-27T02:19:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	thnx gonna read it
2010-10-27T02:20:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	and make certain to write down that pass phrase and keep it in a secure/safe place
2010-10-27T02:23:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	thnx, im gonna reinstall ubuntu
2010-10-27T02:23:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	with the passphrase i can mount the encrypted home, right?
2010-10-27T02:24:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	have fun -- and *don't ever loose that passphrase*
2010-10-27T02:24:00.000Z	commodoor	guntbert	thnx for the help
2010-10-27T02:24:00.000Z	guntbert	commodoor	you're welcome :-)
