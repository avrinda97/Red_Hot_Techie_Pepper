2010-06-18T01:13:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	You need to add them to the group 'root'  (or edit the sudoers file using visudo.. but that's getting complicated.)
2010-06-18T01:14:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	 sudo adduser <username> admin     is this what i need?
2010-06-18T01:14:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	That could do it
2010-06-18T01:14:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	great!
2010-06-18T01:26:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	sudo adduser <username> admin  gave me output about adding the user to the group root. i still get: sudo: must be setuid root   when trying to run stuff with sudo.
2010-06-18T01:26:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	Did you look at the ownership and permissions on the sudo executable?
2010-06-18T01:30:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	It shows that someone did at some point screw up the permissions on your sudo file.  It should be -rwsr-xr-x 2 root root 145K 2010-04-13 18:37 /usr/bin/sudo
2010-06-18T01:30:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	run this: sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo
2010-06-18T01:30:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	mgolisch it's a new EC2 instance
2010-06-18T01:30:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	let me try
2010-06-18T01:31:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	so sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo  will not helpL
2010-06-18T01:32:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	It will be helpful, but it might not be able to run without booting off of a CD image.. because you can't seem to execute sudo commands.
2010-06-18T01:33:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	your command helped! so what is the s i see here: -rwsr-xr-x
2010-06-18T01:34:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	it changed from x to s
2010-06-18T01:34:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	If it changed from x to s.. that's probably fixed it.
2010-06-18T01:35:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	yes, but what does it mean?
2010-06-18T01:35:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	That command set the SUID bit. (Well. the "user sticky" bit really.. but in that instance..that's what it does.)  Can you run sudo without the error now?
2010-06-18T01:36:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	yes
2010-06-18T01:36:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	Well, that seems to solve that. :)  Whee!
2010-06-18T01:36:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	it's a production machine so i want to make sure it's secure and i know what i did.
2010-06-18T01:37:00.000Z	Heebie	owen1	Well, if you want to make sure you know what you did, you want to make sure you turn on a lot of logging for sudo.. and you should avoid doing a sudo su - to get to a root shell. ;)
2010-06-18T01:39:00.000Z	owen1	Heebie	ok. thanks a lot!
