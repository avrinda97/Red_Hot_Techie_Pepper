2012-03-02T02:01:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	output of "cat /etc/apt/sources.list" and "cat /etc/issue"
2012-03-02T02:06:00.000Z	codeperl	iceroot	what i have to do?
2012-03-02T02:06:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	use the commands and paste the output to pastebin
2012-03-02T02:11:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	that are not the commands i told you
2012-03-02T02:12:00.000Z	codeperl	iceroot	here is the result of 1st command
2012-03-02T02:14:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	you installed some debs by hand?
2012-03-02T02:14:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	or always using apt-get/synaptic?
2012-03-02T02:15:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	what is the exact "apt-get install" line you are using to get that error?
2012-03-02T02:18:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	my guess is that some of that packages you are trying to install is not in the mainrepos but one of the package in the main-repos as a suggestion of one of them so apt-get knows the package (else you would get cant find package foobar)
2012-03-02T02:18:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	solution: go to packages.ubuntu.com look in what repos all the packages are and enable that repos
2012-03-02T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	i already have them
2012-03-02T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	also no need to start your line with ! that will wake up our bot ubuntu
2012-03-02T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	codeperl	also no need to start your line with ! that will wake up our bot ubottu
2012-03-02T02:20:00.000Z	codeperl	iceroot	ok
2012-03-02T02:21:00.000Z	codeperl	iceroot	so, what i can do now can you please say? i am very new.
2012-03-02T02:24:00.000Z	codeperl	iceroot	what is the problem actually? how can i solve?
