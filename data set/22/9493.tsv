2005-04-07T09:49:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	what is the error you get?
2005-04-07T09:51:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	we need more detail :
2005-04-07T09:52:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	at least the first few errors
2005-04-07T09:59:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	no, that was for projectmayhem
2005-04-07T10:00:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	have you put a # as first character on the Load "v4l" line?
2005-04-07T10:01:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	does the line now read: #   Load "v4l"
2005-04-07T10:01:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	hit <ctrl>O to save the file
2005-04-07T10:02:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	and then <ctrl>X to exit
2005-04-07T10:03:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	and reboot :)
2005-04-07T10:08:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	what is the error now?
2005-04-07T10:09:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	open the file again with nano
2005-04-07T10:12:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	you must be mistaken :)
2005-04-07T10:14:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	is there maybe another line tht contains "v4l"
2005-04-07T10:17:00.000Z	Seveas	harpis	i'm out of options then, maybe someone else can help
