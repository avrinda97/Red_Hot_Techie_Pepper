2011-07-21T11:28:00.000Z	obeyance		Ubuntu 11.04
2011-07-21T11:29:00.000Z	obeyance		Ill be installing Win7 from a USB Flash drive
2011-07-21T11:30:00.000Z	obeyance		How?
2011-07-21T11:31:00.000Z	obeyance		Its like Alcohol 120% for windows?
2011-07-21T11:31:00.000Z	obeyance		Just a virtual drive.
2011-07-21T11:31:00.000Z	obeyance		Oh heh.
2011-07-21T11:31:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	make some space unpartitioned. while installing windows, create a partition there and install it. reinstall your grub2 bootloader /msg ubottu fixmbr
2011-07-21T11:33:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	I told you above how to install windows after ubuntu. what's unclear about it?
2011-07-21T11:36:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	if you want to play games 5 years and older it can work. for current games it does not
2011-07-21T12:22:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	you can resize your ext4 partition and make it smaller
2011-07-21T12:23:00.000Z	obeyance	wols_	thats what im trying to od.
2011-07-21T12:25:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	you want to boot from a live cd. resizing a live filesystem is not good at all
2011-07-21T12:30:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	you boot from the ubuntu live cd and run gparted there
2011-07-21T19:06:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	no it's not. I think (not totally sure) you can install windows from harddisk, but this is a windows question and off topic here. go and ask ##windows
2011-07-21T19:08:00.000Z	obeyance	wols_	Well i know you can install from virtual drive, in windows environment, but i dont know if the same is possible in Linux.
2011-07-21T19:09:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	no it's not. how to install windows is NOT a ubuntu question and you CANNOT install it when running a LInux OS. go away with your question
2011-07-21T19:09:00.000Z	obeyance	wols_	Take off the word windows and the question still remins.
2011-07-21T19:10:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	if I take off that word then you don't have a problem anymore. so it's solved. now go away
2011-07-21T19:15:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	I tell you a third time since you apparently don't read: you cannot do what you ask. you can however install windows from harddisk. but NOT from a loopback device when you run Ubuntu. NEVER gonna happen. NEVER
2011-07-21T19:16:00.000Z	obeyance	wols_	so my choice is to boot from a bootable device but i cant not run from ISO while the linux kernal is up?
2011-07-21T19:19:00.000Z	obeyance	wols_	Is it possible to make a full install to HDD with virtual machine somehow?
2011-07-21T19:19:00.000Z	wols_	obeyance	please stop asking me anything. you don't read what I tell you so please don't waste my time
