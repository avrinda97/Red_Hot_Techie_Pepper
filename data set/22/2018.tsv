2009-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	dogon		hello
2009-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	dogon		I need a little help
2009-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	dogon		I can't run an executable
2009-10-25T05:57:00.000Z	dogon		Hello, I'm trying to run an executable given to me by my teacher, but for some reason it doesn't work...
2009-10-25T05:57:00.000Z	Billiard	dogon	what is the error?
2009-10-25T05:58:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	one sec, let me copy it
2009-10-25T05:58:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	The error is "bash: ./referee: cannot execute binary file"
2009-10-25T05:59:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	But it is an executable file, I can see it in the file type when I look at the file
2009-10-25T05:59:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	And the instructions by the teacher clearly say it's a unix executable
2009-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	Billiard	dogon	try the file command
2009-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	vlt: The file command says "ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.4, not stripped"
2009-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	Billiard	dogon	maybe you are supposed to use this file on machines at school which are running x86-64?
2009-10-25T05:08:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	vlt: well, we do have a couple of 64 bit linux machines at school...
2009-10-25T05:09:00.000Z	Billiard	dogon	that must be what the teacher expects you to use it on, i dont think he would assume you have a 64 bit machine at home, my teachers dont assume we even have a computer at home
2009-10-25T05:10:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	I just downloaded a virtual machine, installed ubuntu and I was thinking that I will have no problems running the executables
2009-10-25T05:11:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	but thanks for the help :)... I'm pissed off at my teacher AGAIN, but at least I know what's going on
2009-10-25T05:11:00.000Z	Billiard	dogon	you would need a 64bit machine and a 64bit guest os installed, then it would work
2009-10-25T05:12:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	vlt: My OS and computer are 64 bit, I guess I'll have to install the 64 bit VM and get the 64 bit ubuntu
2009-10-25T05:12:00.000Z	Billiard	dogon	yeah then it should work
2009-10-25T05:13:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	vlt: or I could just install the stupid ssh client and remote into the school computer every time I want to run the program
2009-10-25T05:17:00.000Z	dogon	Billiard	vlt: anyway, thanks for all your help! I really appreciate it!
2009-10-25T05:17:00.000Z	Billiard	dogon	np
