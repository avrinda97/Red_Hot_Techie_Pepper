2011-04-12T13:57:00.000Z	parapan		hi there fellows; Opera browser was freezing; I made Left Mouse button > close; after that, tried to restart again and is saying that the program is still running; I checked with System Monitor, it's active, taking 500 Mb from the memory and 90% processor load; went to terminal sudo killall opera ...nothing changed .....then, sudo killall 2391 ( the process ID ) but  is says 2391: process not found - anyone has a clue ??
2011-04-12T13:58:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	If opera is still on the screen, try "xkill" and click on Opera.
2011-04-12T13:58:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	nope it's not on X ...I don't have it on screen anymore
2011-04-12T13:59:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	it's only on the process list on system monitor interface
2011-04-12T13:59:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	"htop" -- It list processes.
2011-04-12T14:00:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	another command ? htop must be installed
2011-04-12T14:00:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	You have to reboot. I think you're experiencing zombie process.
2011-04-12T14:00:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process (Sounds like it?)
2011-04-12T14:01:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	can do that but I'm annoyed by this .....the only way to detect the process is when checking the system monitor ...cannot ,use any command to kill this process; from System Monitor can be done but wanted to do that from terminal
2011-04-12T14:01:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	Okay. htop is nice CLI system monitor.
2011-04-12T14:02:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	If you're experiencing too many opera crashes/bugs/leaks... Chromium is always nice. :)
2011-04-12T14:02:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	sound exactly like a zombie process ...
2011-04-12T14:03:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	Okay. Then you can't kill them off. You have to reboot. :)
2011-04-12T14:03:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	yeap ...got used to opera ....most bookmarks I have in it; I also use chrome and firefox from time to time :D
2011-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	Backup/Transfer the bookmarks. Some people use Xmarks.
2011-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	but I CAN kill the process; but only using the system monitor > right click on process > kill ....but NOT from terminal
2011-04-12T14:05:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	Confirm that it's long gone -- Relaunch system monitor when you try that. I wonder if it's just GUI (although I never tried it).
2011-04-12T14:08:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	installed htop ..lokks nice ....the process is shown ...opera / ID: 2391 ....selected press F9 ...didn't stopped
2011-04-12T14:09:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	Try it with system-monitor. Kill it. Start system-monitor again. Is it really gone?
2011-04-12T14:10:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	yeap with sys monitor it works ...tested again for at least 10 times ....my problem is ....what if I do nat have X - like on the server for example ...
2011-04-12T14:11:00.000Z	parapan	red2kic	anyway thanks alot ...kill-it with sys monitor .....those zoombie processes ..:D
2011-04-12T14:11:00.000Z	red2kic	parapan	Well, do what you have to do. I'd say to that problem. :)
