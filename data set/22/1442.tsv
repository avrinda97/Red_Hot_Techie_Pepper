2010-06-15T22:24:00.000Z	Uggis		guys, i have .ko file that i need to use in insmod to get my wireless adpter working
2010-06-15T22:25:00.000Z	Uggis		how i could make ubuntu do it in start?
2010-06-15T22:25:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	It works already?
2010-06-15T22:25:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	Put the insmod command with full path to the kernel object in /etc/rc.local
2010-06-15T22:26:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	Whatever is in this file should get execuated as root
2010-06-15T22:29:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	what patch i sould put it for example :D
2010-06-15T22:29:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	huh?
2010-06-15T22:30:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	 how i would find path to some file?
2010-06-15T22:30:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	You should already know where the file exists on your filesystem
2010-06-15T22:32:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	well sould i use like uggis/filename.ko for example?
2010-06-15T22:33:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	or do i need to use like /home/uggis/drivername.ko
2010-06-15T22:33:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	In /etc/rc.local, just make a new line before exit 0 with insmod /path/to/your/module.ko
2010-06-15T22:34:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	Obviously, you will need to make that path whatever it is on your system
2010-06-15T22:35:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	i get what you are saying, i just dont know ubuntus file system realy well..
2010-06-15T22:35:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	Ok, what is the exact insmod command you have to run every time you boot?
2010-06-15T22:36:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	i do cd desktop -> cd folder -> insmod drivername.ko
2010-06-15T22:37:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	Does this show the file?  ls $HOME/Desktop/folder
2010-06-15T22:38:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	ls /home/uggis/desktop/folder shows it
2010-06-15T22:39:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	Yes, all you have to run is insmod /home/uggis/desktop/folder/drivername.ko
2010-06-15T22:39:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	thank you so much :)
2010-06-15T22:41:00.000Z	Uggis	soreau	i tested it and works perfectly :)
2010-06-15T22:42:00.000Z	soreau	Uggis	Great! :D
