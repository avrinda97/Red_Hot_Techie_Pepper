2007-06-19T12:41:00.000Z	jikanter	capitalist	ok, so you need to have your headers on your environmental variable $PATH if you want it to work
2007-06-19T12:42:00.000Z	capitalist	jikanter	where can i read about doing this?
2007-06-19T12:43:00.000Z	jikanter	capitalist	you are programming in C, correct?

2007-06-19T12:46:00.000Z	capitalist	jikanter	yeah i figured because they are looking for stdio.h, but none of the madwifi tutorials mention having to do any strange things to compile it
