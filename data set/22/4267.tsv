2008-05-29T13:07:00.000Z	ntolo	holycow	i dont know the commands,my application menu is not working for some reason and there are some applications i want to launch.

2008-05-29T13:10:00.000Z	ntolo	holycow	Its does not.

2008-05-29T13:13:00.000Z	ntolo	holycow	with fi it gives me options but with application it does not.
2008-05-29T13:13:00.000Z	holycow	ntolo	what do you mean? i type in fi into terminal press tab several times and it gives me 40 options
2008-05-29T13:14:00.000Z	holycow	ntolo	are you typing it into terminal or?
2008-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	ntolo	holycow	with fi it gives me options too but when i type "appli" i get only appletViewer.

2008-05-29T13:15:00.000Z	holycow	ntolo	well, thats all it can autocomplete
2008-05-29T13:16:00.000Z	ntolo	holycow	then does that mean application is not working somehow ?

2008-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	ntolo	holycow	Am not that good with the terminal so i rely heavily on the application menu.
2008-05-29T13:17:00.000Z	holycow	ntolo	well you can add/reomve apps from terminal as well
2008-05-29T13:18:00.000Z	holycow	ntolo	sounds like you lost your desktop? is that right?
