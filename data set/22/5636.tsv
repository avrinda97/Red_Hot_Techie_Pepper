2008-12-14T14:40:00.000Z	Boohbah	raylu	i would guess you are missing some dev libs
2008-12-14T14:40:00.000Z	raylu	Boohbah	i would too. but configure says i'm fine
2008-12-14T14:42:00.000Z	Boohbah	raylu	hmmm, can you pastebin the error?
2008-12-14T14:42:00.000Z	raylu	Boohbah	it's a make error about X11/something.h not being found
2008-12-14T14:42:00.000Z	raylu	Boohbah	but i had libx11-dev installed, and configure agreed
2008-12-14T14:45:00.000Z	raylu	Boohbah	nobody "wants" the headache that is samba
