2007-05-30T12:55:00.000Z	insmod	Lapinux	:)
2007-05-30T13:00:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	don't know if you can help me or not on this, but on that same question, if i remove usplash can i go into menu.1st and change the text mode for boot?
2007-05-30T13:01:00.000Z	insmod	Lapinux	change it to what?
2007-05-30T13:02:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	a higher res, if the default looks like crap
2007-05-30T13:03:00.000Z	insmod	Lapinux	sure can i forget the switch though -- i say it on debian posts and redhat post and  kubuntuforums etc
2007-05-30T13:04:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	i would have to look it up, but i remember doing it before... just wasnt sure if i could do it in ubuntu's menu.1st as i saw it says its auto generated kernel list....
2007-05-30T13:05:00.000Z	insmod	Lapinux	ya it is just the same old grub :)
2007-05-30T13:05:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	ok, thanks
2007-05-30T13:10:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	thanks, im gonna do some digging now that i know it upslash that takes care of the boot
2007-05-30T13:11:00.000Z	insmod	Lapinux	what's wrong with the boot
2007-05-30T13:11:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	i just like to see whats going on :)
2007-05-30T13:11:00.000Z	insmod	Lapinux	ctrl alt F1
2007-05-30T13:11:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	i would like to see it everytime, as default
2007-05-30T13:12:00.000Z	insmod	Lapinux	ah
2007-05-30T13:37:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	i got the usplash thing taken care of nicely, and was easier than i thought it was going to be
2007-05-30T13:38:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	just has to remove "splash" from the end of kernel line in menu.1st, then i added "vga=791" for 1024x786 res
2007-05-30T13:39:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	only thing is is menu.1st is updated i will have to go back and change it i believe
2007-05-30T13:40:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	i didnt know if i did that if something else would complain or break....?
2007-05-30T13:40:00.000Z	Lapinux	insmod	i would think, only a major update would rewrite grub?
