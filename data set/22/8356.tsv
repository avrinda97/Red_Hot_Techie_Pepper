2006-01-11T13:11:00.000Z	Diablo69		I liked my old nick 2 :(
2006-01-11T13:12:00.000Z	Diablo69		could I blacklist hotplug?
2006-01-11T13:13:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 you can add modules to hotplug's blacklist
2006-01-11T13:13:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 hehe... could be worth upgrading to dapper.
2006-01-11T13:13:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 in dapper there is no hotplug, its udev that manages it now :)
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 but if not, hotplug can be deactivated at boot, as it is an init.d service that runs
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 dapper is the unsbale version, to be released stable 04/06
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 sudo update-rc.d remove -f hotplug
2006-01-11T13:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 open a console and type away ..... but write down what it says in case you need to put it back.
2006-01-11T13:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 or even better, install bum and deactivate it without removing it from the rc.S
2006-01-11T13:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 can you boot in safe mode?
2006-01-11T13:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 what stage are you at? did uit finish the installation?
2006-01-11T13:17:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 ok. when you boot your PC, press ESC as soon as grub flashes up (just before it starts booting linux)
2006-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 you can choose the 2nd option, linux kernel with a number + recovery mode
2006-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 are you on the same PC in dualboot now?
2006-01-11T13:19:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 what cd did you download to install your ubuntu?
2006-01-11T13:20:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 ok, thats not nice of it ;) newest? was it called breezy or 5.10 ?
2006-01-11T13:21:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 ok, do you see any other kernels availabe in that list (when you press ESC), or just 2 entries (one with recovery mode) ?
2006-01-11T13:21:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 argh ok.
2006-01-11T13:22:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 i would recommend you getting the dapper flight 2 cd, its unstable, officially, but relatively stable to use.....
2006-01-11T13:23:00.000Z	aftertaf	Diablo69	 however, you *could/* have a duff ubuntu CD or some hardware problem
