2007-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	spasticteapot		I don't want to use sudo - I want to use Root.
2007-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Thanks!
2007-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Thanks!
2007-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Wait...confused now...
2007-02-03T12:29:00.000Z	spasticteapot		First, I sudo passwd root to entern my root password.
2007-02-03T12:29:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Ah.
2007-02-03T12:30:00.000Z	spasticteapot		CokenCode: Yes. But only for the purpose of setting up Samba.
2007-02-03T12:30:00.000Z	spasticteapot		I'm going to turn off X-windows after I get it set up.
2007-02-03T12:30:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Oh...duh.
2007-02-03T12:31:00.000Z	spasticteapot		We need a #ubuntu-networking.
2007-02-03T12:32:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	and you want to automatically mound on every boot?
2007-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	i usually use a line like: '//colossus/durchzug     /mnt/durchzug   smbfs   users,username=guest,password=bar,uid=1000,gid=1000'
2007-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	but don't ask me why. it just works here.
2007-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	rdz	I'm somewhat confused.
2007-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	rdz	How do I set a root password?
2007-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	sorry, i didn't want to confuse you. it works here without being root
2007-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	but you need to be root to edit the /etc/fstab-file
2007-02-03T12:31:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	did you already install smbfs?
2007-02-03T12:31:00.000Z	spasticteapot	rdz	Yes.
2007-02-03T12:32:00.000Z	spasticteapot	rdz	Yup.
2007-02-03T12:32:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	ok, you need to edit your /etc/fstav
2007-02-03T12:34:00.000Z	rdz	spasticteapot	i am afraid, not
