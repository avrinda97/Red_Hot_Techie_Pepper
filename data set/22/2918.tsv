2009-05-31T10:42:00.000Z	gartral		how do i tell what recomendations a package has after iv'e installed it?
2009-05-31T10:42:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	apt-cache show will tell you i think
2009-05-31T11:04:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	http://sourceforge.net/projects/lkl/
2009-05-31T11:05:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	lkl is way to buggy for reliable usage..
2009-05-31T11:06:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	so then try a hardware keylogger
2009-05-31T11:06:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	or contribute some patches to the project to make it better
2009-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	i'de rather do it at kernel level, or possibly through grep or the like
2009-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	so then do that
2009-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	i dont knopw how... i tryed greping /lib/udev/devices/stdin to a file, but that didnt do anything..
2009-06-01T06:15:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	there is no such thing as a "gdm session"
2009-06-01T06:20:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	use w, find the shell that's running, and kill that ssh session using the kill command
2009-06-01T06:21:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	w shows no PIDs
2009-06-08T02:12:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	depends on the program, probably just write an init.d script for it
2009-06-08T02:13:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	can you run things as root that way?
2009-06-08T02:13:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	if you want
2009-06-08T02:13:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	running a daemon as root is almost universally a bad idea though
2009-06-08T02:14:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	ok, i need to run noip2 as root because it won't read the script any other way (even though my perms are 770 for the settings script)
2009-06-08T02:15:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	770 means "no permissions for anybody outside of user/group"
2009-06-08T02:19:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	it would seem Root owns that config script
2009-06-08T02:23:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	i got it
2009-06-11T06:40:00.000Z	fryguy	gartral	the html5 spec isn't done yet, so good luck finding anything usable
2009-06-11T06:41:00.000Z	gartral	fryguy	im looking for *any* rendering capability
