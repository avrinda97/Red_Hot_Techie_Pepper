2009-05-01T07:29:00.000Z	nikor		hi - Trying to Internet Explorer v.6 in Wine - Anyone know the best way to do this ? ?
2009-05-01T07:30:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	in windows
2009-05-01T07:31:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	I do not care for IE personally - trying to get NetFlicks to work with watching movies over the internet.
2009-05-01T07:32:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	I thought that netflicks had a linux portion.. could be wrong.. how bout installing virtualbox and then install windows in that.. ?
2009-05-01T07:33:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	in the mean time.. www.hulu.com :)
2009-05-01T07:35:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	That is probably the only way - Not up to running any Windows app on Intrepid box anyway. Thanks for the idea though.
2009-05-01T07:35:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	vbox runs native.. I need ie6 for work.. that's my way.. and I can use vbox to check out other distros
2009-05-01T07:37:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	yea - what a pain sometimes - the netflicks uses silverlight instead of regular flash as well.
2009-05-01T07:38:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	there is a silverlight linux version.. moonlight? something like that
2009-05-01T07:38:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	hmmm - might check it out might be a work around ...... thx
2009-05-01T07:45:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	Found the moonlight - installed plugin & restarted FFox - went to netflix - but alas it is a no go - tried :o( - If I get ambitious will go with VBox ....
2009-05-01T07:46:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	Thanks for suggestions and help appreciate it....
2009-05-01T07:47:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	no problem.. I was just looking too.. looks like vbox is the only solution.
2009-05-01T07:51:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	yea - I got IE6 running from a terminal window but Netflix complains about having have cookies enabled - but no toolbar etc or place in this funky IE to get this to happen < http://bookmarks.honewatson.com/2008/12/17/ie6-internet-exporer-install-ubuntu-ibex-intrepid-wine-tricks/ >
2009-05-01T07:52:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	a constant struggle
2009-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	That's ok I still love run'n my ubuntu box verse's a spyware ridden windows box any day of the week - just keep trying right?
2009-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	yep
2009-05-01T07:55:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	Are you running ubuntu-offtopic as well?
2009-05-01T07:55:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	not currently ..
2009-05-01T07:55:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	just wanted to mention something - but this not right forum for it
2009-05-01T07:56:00.000Z	scunizi	nikor	I'm there now
2009-05-01T07:56:00.000Z	nikor	scunizi	ok
