2008-05-06T15:03:00.000Z	Stormcr0w		Hello all. I have an internal SATA disk that does not auto-mount at startup... I can find it under "My Computer", but all shortcuts to it are inactive until I actually click on it to display its contents the first time. How can I make it automount at startup?
2008-05-06T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	you'll need to add it to /etc/fstab
2008-05-06T15:04:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	thanks, I'll look at it now
2008-05-06T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	before you play, backup the fstab file
2008-05-06T15:05:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Sure will do! Thanks,
2008-05-06T15:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	then you can easiy restore (use sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
2010-05-05T17:38:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Ah, ok, thanks. And download UBCD...
2010-05-05T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	do you eventually get a desktop?
2010-05-05T17:30:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Yes, I do.
2010-05-05T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	your kern.log doesn't have any massive gaps which you describe, strange, is there anything suspect in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2010-05-05T17:32:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Let me have a quick look. Please see the vid, to see what I mean. My suspicion is that the gap comes before the log begins to be taken.
2010-05-05T17:34:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	This is my Xorg.0.log: http://pastebin.com/XiQvZKAH
2010-05-05T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	very weird, well its before the kernel is loaded and after grub.  Have you tested your ram for errors? I also suggest you pull down the ultimate boot cd and check your drive for issues
2010-05-05T17:37:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Test RAM for errors? Through the BIOS you mean?
2010-05-05T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	no, its in the grub menua (hold shift at boot)
2010-05-05T17:40:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Which drive test tool do you recommend from the UBCD?
2010-05-05T17:43:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Also, do you thing it might be a problem with Grub?
2010-05-05T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	the CD has the main manufacturers tools on there, use the one for your make to low level test
2010-05-05T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	could be but ive never messed with grub except to disable ipv6
2010-05-05T17:44:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	I see, thank you all the same. I am downloading the cd now. Will restart and test. Will let you know if you are still here when I get back.
2010-05-05T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Stormcr0w	remember to md5 test ;)
2010-05-05T17:45:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	ActionParsnip	Indeed
