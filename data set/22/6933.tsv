2008-11-13T00:48:00.000Z	facefaceface		dist-upgrade that is... I figure I'm missing a repo...
2008-11-13T00:49:00.000Z	facefaceface		I knew clicking that tempting 'upgrade' button would end like this ;-)
2008-11-13T00:51:00.000Z	facefaceface		sudo apt-get install -f -> acpi-support: Depends: xset but it is not installable -> E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.
2008-11-13T00:51:00.000Z	facefaceface		among others...
2008-11-13T00:51:00.000Z	facefaceface		there are several problems
2008-11-13T00:52:00.000Z	facefaceface		sudo apt-get install -f
2008-11-13T00:53:00.000Z	facefaceface		http://pastebin.com/m7bb77003
2008-11-13T00:55:00.000Z	facefaceface		It is impossible to install or remove any software. Please use the package manager "Synaptic" or run "sudo apt-get install -f" in a terminal to fix this issue at first
2008-11-13T00:55:00.000Z	facefaceface		I'll try synaptec
2008-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	compengi	facefaceface	it seems you have install a package that was brocken, you would need first to run sudo apt-get install -f to correct your package manager and then you could install/remove whatever you want
2008-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	facefaceface	compengi	the -f still fails
2008-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	compengi	facefaceface	what's the failure message?
2008-11-13T00:57:00.000Z	facefaceface	compengi	I pasted it...

2008-11-13T00:58:00.000Z	facefaceface		^^^ compengi
2008-11-13T01:00:00.000Z	compengi	facefaceface	what package you've tried to install?
2008-11-13T01:00:00.000Z	facefaceface		synaptec ... the following packges have unresolvable dependencies... x-core for example... tried distro-upgrade ;(
2008-11-13T01:00:00.000Z	facefaceface	compengi	distro-upgrade
2008-11-13T01:00:00.000Z	facefaceface		My repos are broke I guess
2008-11-13T01:06:00.000Z	compengi	facefaceface	try sudo aptitude remove distro-upgrade
2008-11-13T01:06:00.000Z	facefaceface	compengi	OK
2008-11-13T01:08:00.000Z	facefaceface	compengi	its doing something...
