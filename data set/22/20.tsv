2012-11-15T07:11:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	open your system monitor, click on the 1st tab. Or, in a terminal, give:  cat /etc/lsb-release
2012-11-15T07:12:00.000Z	SierraAR	kostkon	thanks. Another question - Is it better to stick with the 32bit version of 12.10, even though my hardware supports 64 bit (I originally had windows 7 64 bit on this laptop), or should I switch to 64 bit? I've gotten mixxed signals from google searches
2012-11-15T07:13:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	my recommendation would be, if you can, switch to 64.
2012-11-15T07:14:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	is there anything specific that concerns you, are you worrying about something that might not work on 64bit?
2012-11-15T07:15:00.000Z	SierraAR	kostkon	mainly I've read that programs designed to work in 32bit won't run in ubuntu 64bit due to missing 32bit libraries
2012-11-15T07:16:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	actually, ubuntu has had multiatch support since 12.04. It measn that you can run 32bit programs in your 64bit OS.
2012-11-15T07:17:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	or maybe since 11.10.
2012-11-15T07:18:00.000Z	SierraAR	kostkon	ah cool, thanks. Is there a way to install the 64bit version without losing everything thats already setup?
2012-11-15T07:18:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	do you have a separate partition for you home?
2012-11-15T07:19:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	if not, then I think you'll have to do a clean install.
2012-11-15T07:20:00.000Z	SierraAR	kostkon	I don't think so. I didnt set any partitions up when installing.
2012-11-15T07:20:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	then, just backup and reinstall :/
2012-11-15T07:24:00.000Z	SierraAR	kostkon	alright, thanks.
2012-11-15T07:52:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	the new menu in ubuntu is the dash ;)  so it modifies the entries in dash and the launcher
2012-11-15T07:52:00.000Z	SierraAR	kostkon	weird, because the files and stuff listed in the main menu program arent anywhere in the dash that I can find, they dont show up when searching either
2012-11-15T07:53:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	yeah, there are some new generation gtk menu utilities in the software centre that are written specifically for unity. Just do a search in USC.
2012-11-15T07:54:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	2-3 of them
2012-11-15T07:55:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	and i meant gnome menu, not gtk menu :/
2012-11-15T07:56:00.000Z	SierraAR	kostkon	explains why I only got one search result, that being 'terminal' xD
2012-11-15T07:58:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	just search for "menu". Check this for example, https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/menulibre/
2012-11-15T07:58:00.000Z	kostkon	SierraAR	but, it's only for 12.04 ok :/
