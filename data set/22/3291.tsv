2009-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	Deadboys	LtL	how do i force re-install
2009-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	mdg is right, or use the gui
2009-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	Deadboys	LtL	gui is not an option
2009-01-05T10:09:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	youre missing the adduser in /usr/sbin/ try apt-get adduser
2009-01-05T10:10:00.000Z	Deadboys	LtL	it says i already have it
2009-01-05T10:10:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	your whereis output doesnt agree with you
2009-01-05T10:12:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	that doesnt show the adduser binary, just the conf and man pages
2009-01-05T10:12:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	somehow its lost, force re-install w/apt-get
2009-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	let me look
2009-01-05T10:15:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	try sudo apt-get install adduser --reinstall
2009-01-05T10:16:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	i may have that syntax out of order
2009-01-05T10:17:00.000Z	Deadboys	LtL	should i just do a fresh install of Ubuntu?
2009-01-05T10:21:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	no i don't think thats needed. hang on
2009-01-05T10:22:00.000Z	Deadboys	LtL	i got it sorted out
2009-01-05T10:25:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	you need to be root/sudo to  install ircd
2009-01-05T10:26:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	just install/edit  config and start as root.
2009-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	once installed, use your ircd pass for priveleges
2009-01-05T10:27:00.000Z	Deadboys	LtL	what do you mean by that
2009-01-05T10:28:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	give yourself an O-line  with htpasswd and ip in ircd.conf  edit that file carefully
2009-01-05T10:29:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	just read the ircd.conf carefully.
2009-01-05T10:30:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	it will be a root owned process thats all.
2009-01-05T11:44:00.000Z	LtL	Deadboys	try rm -rf
