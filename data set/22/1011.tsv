2010-11-27T08:22:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	did you try sudo nvidia-xconfig?
2010-11-27T08:22:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	command not found
2010-11-27T08:23:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	did you already uninstalled the driver?
2010-11-27T08:23:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	no i have not done anything yet
2010-11-27T08:24:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	and so you need to download from nvidia site, isn't that what you mean?, but I think it's better to install nvidia-current package
2010-11-27T08:24:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	when i installed nvidia-current package...i got black screen after reboot
2010-11-27T08:25:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	it blinked to or 3 times and brought you to shell isn't it?
2010-11-27T08:25:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	yes
2010-11-27T08:26:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	when you reach the shell login
2010-11-27T08:26:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	i was stuck in shell - i reinstalled ubuntu because of it....
2010-11-27T08:26:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	then type sudo nvidia-xconfig
2010-11-27T08:27:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	then restart you system, that might be enough, if not, come back here using Live CD
2010-11-27T08:28:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	that is what I have.... it is OPTIMUS nvidia card
2010-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	should I use proprietary drivers ?
2010-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	that is I said, nvidia-current
2010-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	so the one i have currenty is fine ?
2010-11-27T08:31:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	now does compiz works well?
2010-11-27T08:31:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	yes it works fine so far....
2010-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	then don't get your PC damaged once more ;),
2010-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	okay... but i want to be able to use all features for the gfx card
2010-11-27T08:33:00.000Z	pksadiq	krunal	if compiz works well, that does mean your graphix card is detected and being used
2010-11-27T08:34:00.000Z	krunal	pksadiq	okay cool. Thank you!
