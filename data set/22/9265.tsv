2005-05-07T05:07:00.000Z	poningru		thnx got it
2005-05-07T05:07:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	you don't care where the files go. you just run the program
2005-05-07T05:08:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	for what it's worth, binaries go to bin, libraries go to lib and so on
2005-05-07T05:12:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	if you do want to mess with some files, they're probably configuration files in /etc
2005-08-06T07:18:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	for web sites, httrack is really sweet
2005-08-06T07:19:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	well it's not all that sweet, but works :)
2005-12-10T14:35:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	minix? i sure hope not. that would be a huge stepback :)
2005-12-10T14:35:00.000Z	poningru	topyli	have you seen the improvement tanenbaum is doing on it?
2005-12-10T14:36:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	no, except the license improvements
2005-12-10T14:38:00.000Z	poningru	topyli	how do you change that cache time?
2005-12-10T14:39:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	no idea
2005-12-10T15:10:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	doesn't mean it will work for everybody. naturally, it is supported by mozilla.org though.
2005-12-10T15:10:00.000Z	poningru	topyli	um why wouldnt it work?
2005-12-10T15:11:00.000Z	topyli	poningru	no, i mean 1.5. it's unsupported, therefore the risk is yours :)
