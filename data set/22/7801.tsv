2006-01-07T10:51:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	if the stuff on the drive is useless
2006-01-07T10:51:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	ok
2006-01-07T10:53:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	ok what drive is the windows partition on?
2006-01-07T10:54:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	do you know what device it is?
2006-01-07T10:55:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	that's where it's mounted
2006-01-07T10:57:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	cfdisk /dev/sda
2006-01-07T10:58:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	that's just info.  don't worry about it
2006-01-07T11:00:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	in fdisk just type m
2006-01-07T11:01:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	type "m", hit enter and find the commands for what I'm telling you
2006-01-07T11:18:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	what didn't work?
2006-01-07T11:21:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	you must do
2006-01-07T11:22:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	while in a terminal
2006-01-07T11:27:00.000Z	Jared	ssstormy	how do i get it to let my non root account write on my hdd without sudo?
2006-01-07T11:27:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	can't do it
2006-01-07T11:28:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	although you can use a root terminal
2006-01-07T11:28:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	if you right click on the applications menu, and edit menus
2006-01-07T11:29:00.000Z	ssstormy	Jared	see the thing is, if someone hijacks the computer through the account you're using, you don't want them to be able to mkfs.ext2 /dev/hda1, cause you'd be dead
