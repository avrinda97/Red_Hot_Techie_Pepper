2010-08-10T18:07:00.000Z	happydonut		hi, in ubuntu server 10.04, why can't i: sudo apt-get install mysql; stop mysql;
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		1) dbus isn't installed, why?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		2) when I install dbus, I get the error about sending message, why?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		but mostly, why can't I: sudo apt-get install mysql; stop mysql in an out of the box ubuntu 10.04 LTS server?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		you can in 9.10
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut		I've done all of those, and they also recommend the new "upstart" way, and pass to that
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut		so I've done all those forms
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut		all give the same error, all use dbus, dbus is not installed
2010-08-10T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	happydonut	it means don't use enter to end a sentence as it scrolls the channel to agressive
2010-08-10T18:11:00.000Z	happydonut	ikonia	I know what it means, i am not doing that, I am saying things in a normal fashion, individual statements, you are just making noise by invalidly trying to state that I don't undestand this
2010-08-10T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	happydonut	you where doing that, it would be helpful if you could try not to, I do it myself so I know how easy it is
2010-08-10T18:13:00.000Z	happydonut	ikonia	I also dislike it, although I think I wasn't doing it. I agree you can slip into it, I will refrain from doing it. I want to convery my question as efficiently as possible. My main thing is now, I've seen the "hack" to remove these errors (you must know of them, mysql is a highly used package) but where is the update?
2010-08-10T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	happydonut	update for what ?
2010-08-10T18:14:00.000Z	happydonut	ikonia	update for not having dbus installed, and the update for the misconfigured upstart
2010-08-10T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	happydonut	I don't see those errors at all
2010-08-10T18:15:00.000Z	happydonut	ikonia	fresh install, install ubuntu server 10.04, apt-get install mysql, then just stop mysql, that works for you?
2010-08-10T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	happydonut	by mysql you mean the package "mysql-server"
2010-08-10T18:16:00.000Z	happydonut	ikonia	yes, apt-get install mysql-server
2010-08-10T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	happydonut	yes, I can do a service start/stop for it, no problem
2010-08-10T18:17:00.000Z	happydonut	ikonia	I've been getting dodgy installs from this server co., they insist now that this is a 100% virgin 10.04, from ubuntu servers, ubuntu server edition... and I've read that other people get these errors, so are you completely sure?
2010-08-10T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	happydonut	%101
2010-08-10T18:18:00.000Z	happydonut	ikonia	I read that as mod 101, or 101% in some RPN form
