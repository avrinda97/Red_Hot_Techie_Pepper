2005-07-14T10:35:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	crimsun	nalioth tried helping with that and compiling it from source... but couldn't get it to work cuz of my 64

2005-07-14T10:36:00.000Z	crimsun	MidNightRaVeN	it's available from deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ sarge main
2005-07-14T10:36:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	crimsun	but how do i install it?
2005-07-14T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	MidNightRaVeN	you should add that line to /etc/apt/sources.list, then sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install libdvdcss2
2005-07-14T10:38:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	crimsun	im bad at the whole source list thing... so let me try
2005-07-14T10:41:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	crimsun	like i said... i stink at the whole source list thing... how should it look in the source list file?? like ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ and something before and after it?

2005-07-14T10:43:00.000Z	MidNightRaVeN	crimsun	does it matter that it says "The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available" ?
