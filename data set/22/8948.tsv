2005-04-19T14:32:00.000Z	cycom		I'm used to emerge --search <pkg>
2005-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	cycom		hehe. I'm a gentoo user. none of this 'precompiled' crap.
2005-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	cycom		that'd be too easy!
2005-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	I came from gentoo :D
2005-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	the only reason I'm not on gentoo on my laptop is because it's impractical to compile across wireless with distcc and then have to wait because the laptop is only 400mhz with 128mb of ram
2005-04-19T14:35:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	yeuch
2005-04-19T14:35:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	I don't suppose you know if gentoo supports VIA sound onboard devices now?
2005-04-19T14:35:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	this box (which I am sshed into from ubuntu) is a dual PIII with 1gb of ram, 18gb scsi, 160gb IDE.
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	I call it 'Beast'. IT gets gentoo, and does distccd for my other boxes
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	hehe :D
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	when I installed gentoo, it didn't support my sound :(
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	I'm trying to get the drivers for my little prism card updated for moniter mode, hence the kernel
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	when was that?
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	2004.1 release
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	you have more than one box?
2005-04-19T14:37:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	yeah
2005-04-19T14:38:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	it was probobly a glitch.
2005-04-19T14:38:00.000Z	cycom	kakalto	they've fixed a lot
2005-04-19T14:38:00.000Z	kakalto	cycom	which is why I want to find out it it's fixed, then download
