2008-07-10T19:52:00.000Z	dxdemetriou		where is the rc script for ufw and how can I check it that works? it's not on the services
2008-07-10T19:52:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	ufw just modifies iptables
2008-07-10T19:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	which is part of the kernel
2008-07-10T19:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	sudo iptables -L, to check there are rules there
2008-07-10T19:55:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	PriceChild	there isn't any rule until I do "ufw enable" on each boot
2008-07-10T19:56:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	sudo nano /etc/ufw/ufw.conf
2008-07-10T19:57:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	that file has an option you can change (pretty obvious what) ctrl+x then y to save
2008-07-10T19:57:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	PriceChild	it is already "ENABLED=yes"
2008-07-10T19:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	odd... /etx/init.d/ufw should check for it
2008-07-10T20:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	do you have a /etc/init.d/ufw? Could you ls -l /etx/init.d/ufw please?
2008-07-10T20:03:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	PriceChild	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 6358 2008-04-08 00:19 /etc/init.d/ufw
2008-07-10T20:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	and the same for the other file?
2008-07-10T20:05:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	PriceChild	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 67 2008-07-10 14:32 /etc/ufw/ufw.conf
2008-07-10T20:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	well if you're sure its enabled in that file, and it still doesn't work when you reboot then i have no idea
2008-07-10T20:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	I'll do a bit of googling
2008-07-10T20:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	seems you're not the only one with this issue
2008-07-10T20:07:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	PriceChild	I don't remember exactly, but I think that on clean install of ubuntu hardy it works
2008-07-10T20:07:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	yep i'm seeing that
2008-07-10T20:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	have you blacklisted ipv6?
2008-07-10T20:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	nevermind, that should be fixed now
2008-07-10T20:09:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	PriceChild	do you have any idea what else to search? I searched for iptables, init.d, rc scripts, he new dkmr for kernel..
2008-07-10T20:09:00.000Z	PriceChild	dxdemetriou	i'm not sure sorry :/
