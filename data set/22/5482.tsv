2007-07-23T10:59:00.000Z	rhoruns		bah
2007-07-23T10:59:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	still working on that failed download?
2007-07-23T11:00:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	ok, you should just be able to run that command it mentioned, and it'll resume from where it left off
2007-07-23T11:00:00.000Z	rhoruns	balleyne	it says that i can not run the command without superuser prilileges.
2007-07-23T11:01:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	:)
2007-07-23T11:01:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	np
2007-07-23T11:02:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	this is the best explanation of sudo - http://xkcd.com/c149.html
2007-07-23T11:02:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	it gets funnier each time I see it, but maybe that's just me
2007-07-23T11:03:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	hehe
2007-07-23T11:06:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	gah... I don't have any experience with any virtual machines really, so I'm not sure how that would effect things... what happened when I had that problem though, the installation was cut off, and that command just kinda picks up where it left off and finishes things... at least that's what it's supposed to do =\
2007-07-23T11:08:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	hmm... sudo is supposed to be able to do anything really, not sure what permissions problems you could be having...
2007-07-23T11:09:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	woah, nm
2007-07-23T11:09:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	I'm new to IRC, lol
2007-07-23T11:10:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	um, so, 'cat' will display the contents of a file, 'vim' is a command line editor, 'gedit' is a graphical editor
2007-07-23T11:10:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	so, '<program> <myfile>' should do the trick
2007-07-23T11:11:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	but, if you don't have proper permissions, 'sudo <program> <myfile>'
2007-07-23T11:11:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	... well, your file
2007-07-23T11:33:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	hehe, don't worry, that stumped me for a bit too the first time I saw something like it
2007-07-23T11:37:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	what, Tux Racer isn't good enough? lol
2007-07-23T12:00:00.000Z	balleyne	rhoruns	yes, linux is uber-multi-user
2007-07-23T12:01:00.000Z	rhoruns	balleyne	oh ok. well, i have my main user 'rhoruns'  in the main group 'rhoruns', but how do i also put him in my vbox group?
