2009-06-09T11:02:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	just use a PDF reader.  I recommend using something like epdf or Okular or something open-source.. Adobe has horrible security issues.
2009-06-09T11:03:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	whats the smallest to install?  I only have low monthly quota,. hence why I tried to avoid having to download 60MB of Adobe
2009-06-09T11:03:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	open Synaptic and search for PDF readers
2009-06-09T11:03:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	ok ty
2009-06-09T11:06:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	will it let you download the PDF file?  Or does it force you to use your browser for viewing?
2009-06-09T11:06:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	no, doesnt allow download of PDF
2009-06-09T11:06:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	it only allows download in MS Money format file
2009-06-09T11:07:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	It only allows to download statement in these formats: OFX, QIF and CSV
2009-06-09T11:07:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	yeah then unfortunately you are going to have to install adobe reader.
2009-06-09T11:08:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	any readers in ubuntu that can read OFX, QIF and CSV?
2009-06-09T11:08:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	yes
2009-06-09T11:08:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	what one? how I install it?
2009-06-09T11:09:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	sudo apt-get install gnucash
2009-06-09T11:09:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	what format does gnucash read? OFX, QIF or CSV?
2009-06-09T11:09:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	you not sure it reads OFX, QIF and CSV?
2009-06-09T11:10:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	I need to know for certain.. its 30MB of multiple files to be installed
2009-06-09T11:11:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	it does both QIF and OFX
2009-06-09T11:12:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	any other programs that can read OFX, QIF or CSV?  Because gnucash wants to install 50 files, about 30MB worth
2009-06-09T11:14:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	TomTommy	try sudo apt-get install grisbi
2009-06-09T11:15:00.000Z	TomTommy	FeasibilityStudy	its ok,  I download CSV and OO spreadsheet reads it
