2005-05-06T07:06:00.000Z	ShaneAu		lol
2005-05-06T07:07:00.000Z	ShaneAu		If I do that, things don't work at all
2005-05-06T07:07:00.000Z	ShaneAu		:-s
2005-05-06T07:07:00.000Z	ShaneAu		I don
2005-05-06T07:08:00.000Z	ShaneAu		It's crazy, the only way to make the internet share is for this linux box to have a DCHP server running wihch only assigns an IP for the netgear router, then I have to turn a DHCP server on the netgear router aswell, otherwise things will just timeout while trying to get an IP (thigns connected to the netgear router\_
2005-05-06T07:08:00.000Z	ShaneAu		yes
2005-05-06T07:08:00.000Z	ShaneAu		Two nics
2005-05-06T07:08:00.000Z	ShaneAu		no
2005-05-06T07:08:00.000Z	ShaneAu		Oh wait
2005-05-06T07:09:00.000Z	ShaneAu		I can ping  192.168.1.254 (the router)
2005-05-06T07:09:00.000Z	] BreliC[	ShaneAu	then there's definitely something wrong in your setup.. you should not need linux to run DHCP if the router has one
2005-05-06T07:09:00.000Z	] BreliC[		it's redundant
2005-05-06T07:09:00.000Z	ShaneAu		but I cannot go to 192.168.1.254
2005-05-06T07:10:00.000Z	ShaneAu		:(
2005-05-06T07:10:00.000Z	ShaneAu		Yeah?
2005-05-06T07:10:00.000Z	ShaneAu		ok
2005-05-06T07:11:00.000Z	ShaneAu	holycow	how would you do it
2005-05-06T07:11:00.000Z	ShaneAu		Like I have Linux box (192.168.1.2, DCHP server running)
2005-05-06T07:12:00.000Z	ShaneAu		Then Netgear router , (DHCP client running, it gets given 192.168.1.254)
2005-05-06T07:12:00.000Z	ShaneAu		Then I need DHCP server running on that aswell :s
2005-05-06T07:12:00.000Z	ShaneAu		hum
2005-05-06T07:12:00.000Z	] BreliC[	ShaneAu	i would turn off the DHCP router on Linux.. you don't need it
