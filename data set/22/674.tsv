2011-05-25T11:51:00.000Z	JoeR1		ok, for some reason my hard drive is not being recognized
2011-05-25T11:52:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	  did you try    df -h  in terminal
2011-05-25T12:08:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	  are you installing  xubuntu-desktop?
2011-05-25T12:09:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 so  you did   sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop  ...yes?
2011-05-25T12:10:00.000Z	JoeR1	coz_	no, I am using a live cd
2011-05-25T12:10:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 mm I am confused,, is ubuntu already installed?
2011-05-25T12:10:00.000Z	JoeR1	coz_	no
2011-05-25T12:11:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 ah ok  what you might want to do is to use the mini.iso image  instead,, at one point you will get a list of things to install and you can choose xubuntu  as the desktop environment
2011-05-25T12:11:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 if you go here   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD   download the mini  and burn it
2011-05-25T12:11:00.000Z	JoeR1	coz_	I have no cd's left to use and this system must be operational by morning
2011-05-25T12:12:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 ah ok
2011-05-25T12:12:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 can you install ubuntu and then ,, after rebooting    sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2011-05-25T12:12:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 or is this the xubuntu  live cd
2011-05-25T12:23:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 that is an easy utility for creating  bootable usb.. just point it to the iso and thats it
2011-05-25T14:13:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 cool  what was the issue before?
2011-05-25T14:15:00.000Z	JoeR1	coz_	because I had used UNetBootin to make the HDD a bootable install disk Gparted and the Xubuntu insatller decided it must be a CDROM so I used MSDOS FDISK to wipe the drive and then started again and the installer gave me formatting options and installed to the 500 gig
2011-05-25T14:16:00.000Z	coz_	JoeR1	 excellent ,, glad you got this worked out :)
2011-05-25T14:17:00.000Z	JoeR1	coz_	I may not be a Linux master but thank god I am proficient enough to realize when I made a stupid mistake
