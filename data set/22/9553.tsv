2005-02-02T11:38:00.000Z	subterrific		warty ships with 0.9, thats why
2005-02-02T11:40:00.000Z	subterrific		the . is a seperator, not a decimal point
2005-02-02T11:40:00.000Z	subterrific		think of it like - in a phone number, or / in a date
2005-02-02T11:41:00.000Z	subterrific		hehe
2005-02-02T11:41:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	what was puumba upset about?
2005-02-02T11:41:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	i had trouble telling from the log
2005-02-02T11:42:00.000Z	subterrific	mako	he wouldn't say really
2005-02-02T11:42:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	and does puumba realize that *i* am from the us? :)
2005-02-02T11:42:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	i guess people from the us might think that saying they take selves too seriously would be offensive.. but c'mon :)
2005-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	subterrific	mako	i tried asking him why he was offended, but i think that offended him
2005-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	subterrific		;)
2005-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	subterrific	mako	cause he wouldn't answer, asked why i was asking and then went on about how people don't have to explain their feelings
2005-02-02T11:44:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	well.. yeah.. hard to be responsive to something you don't know
2005-02-02T11:44:00.000Z	subterrific	mako	which he completely didn't understand.
2005-02-02T11:44:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	i'm happy to go out of my way to try to not offend people. but if i'm not even sure what i could different, it's hard :)
2005-02-02T11:44:00.000Z	subterrific	mako	i'm from the US also, and i thought it was funny
2005-02-02T11:45:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	it's annoying travling in the americas and not beining able to say "i'm from america" or anything really sane
2005-02-02T11:45:00.000Z	subterrific	mako	i wouldn't worry about it. the guy obviously has some issues
2005-02-02T11:46:00.000Z	subterrific	mako	just say you're from the "you ess"?
2005-02-02T11:46:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	well. if puumba shows up again, i can try to talkto him/her :)
2005-02-02T11:46:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	yeah, i do that or "the states"
2005-02-02T11:46:00.000Z	mako	subterrific	or (best) i just say "seattle" or "new york"
