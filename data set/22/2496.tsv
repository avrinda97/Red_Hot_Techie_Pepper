2010-09-26T03:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	sweetpi is correct, to be a valid test you need to run the command in a subshell, like "(echo test >&2) 2> /dev/null"
2010-09-26T03:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	You're welcome.
2010-12-30T02:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	What are you trying to accomplish?
2010-12-30T03:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	like: a='abcde' and d='a'
2010-12-30T03:01:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	then echo *magic* on $d should give 'abcde'
2010-12-30T03:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	a='abcde'; d="$a"
2010-12-30T03:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	I wouldn't call that "double dereferencing", I would call that two assignments, where the second is dereferencing a variable.
2010-12-30T03:03:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	i have a scenario like: for i in t a A ; do echo $i "=>" *magic* on $i ; done
2010-12-30T03:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	Please explain what you are actually trying to accomplish. I have no idea what you mean by "*magic*".
2010-12-30T03:06:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	ok, refer to http://paste.ubuntu.com/548656/ line 108 to line 116
2010-12-30T03:07:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	Im trying to set audio file metadata tags a tag at a time
2010-12-30T03:12:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	oh, the easier way: I want to do this but for variables with any characters values: first='3'; second='first'; echo "$[second]"
2010-12-30T03:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	That code desperately needs comments, I'm still not completely sure what you're trying to do but I think this page will be usefull to you: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/006 . Please read an carefully consider the "Obligitory Note" section.
2010-12-30T03:17:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	thank you very much for that link. It gave me a second opinion!! cheers
2010-12-30T03:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	You're welcome.
2011-02-03T03:07:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	thats NOT clever
2011-02-03T03:08:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	sometimes I had dedicated a partition to /tmp folder and made /etc/defaults/rcS to not delete /tmp files
2011-02-03T03:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	"clever" in the context of computer science is often used as an insult rather than praise :)
2011-02-03T03:08:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	now if they will be deleted by programs, especially video which costs bandwidth do download it again, then there is a problem
2011-02-03T03:09:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Jordan_U	ok, i understand
2011-02-03T03:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mkanyicy	Kyle___: its-me-again: And anyone else interested in my script to undelete flash's temporary files, http://pastebin.com/LHxGWq7D replace "chrome" with your browser of choice.
