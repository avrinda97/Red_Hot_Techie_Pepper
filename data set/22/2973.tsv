2009-01-11T20:01:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	there seems to be just one cd :)
2009-01-11T20:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	If it is just the one cd and a windows game at that then it isnt a  problem with ubuntu.
2009-01-17T19:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	Can you give an example of that -c etc.. very cool..
2009-01-17T19:29:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	well "grep -C 2 <string>" also outputs 2 lines before and after the line where the string is found
2009-01-17T19:32:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	same here :)
2009-01-24T19:18:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	yes, i used that link before.. however it just does not "go to" the external monitor.
2009-01-24T19:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	SOme laptops do not support running as dual
2009-01-25T21:58:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	I checked (what you said to mr galvanize, who's already gone btw) .. creating a new user results in a new homedirectory with 755 mode.
2009-01-25T21:58:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	sure, one can change this, but 755 seems default
2009-01-25T21:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	I am aware..  but curious as to what his default was
2009-01-25T21:59:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	ah, ok... we'll never know I guess :/
2009-01-25T22:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	It made no sense to me that all users could browse the others /home
2009-01-25T22:02:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	by default they can. I get new /home/dir in 755 mode.. thereby accessible by others
2009-01-25T22:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	read but not write and exe..\
2009-01-25T22:02:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	true
2009-01-25T22:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	Ok, so he could make a folder in his home that only he and root could access
2009-01-25T22:03:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	we can have tons of nice suggestions, but he's gone now :s
2009-02-12T20:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	Still nice to know when something worked..
2009-02-25T19:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oCean_	Hey nice to see you
2009-02-25T19:06:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	:)

2009-03-01T21:34:00.000Z	oCean_	Jack_Sparrow	aye! :)
