2009-02-19T09:38:00.000Z	VieQ		Hi all, I have noticed something but I am not sure of
2009-02-19T09:39:00.000Z	VieQ		When I was running 8.04.2 Could't install some apps from the repo's untill I upgraded to 8.10
2009-02-19T09:40:00.000Z	mattofak	VieQ	did apt throw an error back at you?
2009-02-19T09:41:00.000Z	VieQ		yes
2009-02-19T09:41:00.000Z	VieQ		missing deps Couldn't be found
2009-02-19T09:41:00.000Z	mattofak	VieQ	did you run an apt-get update before you attempted to install?
2009-02-19T09:42:00.000Z	VieQ		yes :)
2009-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	VieQ		I just wanted to stick with LTS but the system seemed to like normal release
2009-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	mattofak	VieQ	just thought I'd make sure, i'm guessing canonical added another couple repo's to the apt config; or you were attempting to update packages that the core system needed
2009-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	mattofak		what exactly were you attempting to install
2009-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	VieQ		You have gotta rephrase that sentence so I make sure I fully understood it
2009-02-19T09:46:00.000Z	mattofak		vieq: sorry; two possibilities in my mind: a) with the update to 8.10, some more repositories were added to the apt configuration, or b) the packages you were attempting to update are system packages (though thats unlikely since an explicit install should tell apt to piss off)
2009-02-19T09:47:00.000Z	VieQ		well Pidgin is not a system package, & I may have enabled some repos from those are added by default
2009-02-19T09:49:00.000Z	mattofak		good call; pidgen eh... thats wierd, something I can't explain because thats definitly in the default repos
2009-02-19T09:50:00.000Z	VieQ		I have noticed this since I tend all the time to install new apps from time to time
2009-02-19T09:50:00.000Z	VieQ		If I am using normal release every thing works fine
2009-02-19T09:51:00.000Z	mattofak		well, on a vanilla system that i just happen to be installing anyways, (its server x64 8.04.2) pidgin install just peachy
2009-02-19T09:54:00.000Z	VieQ	mattofak	like I said I have noticed this since along time
2009-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	VieQ		even lately I had a Friend how could not install many thing until he upgraded to normal release
2009-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	mattofak		vieq: its something ive not experianced, nor know how to diagnose; it almost sounds like theres something in your additional repos that's conflicting; have you tried installing it without those repos enabled?
2009-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	VieQ		Nobe
2009-02-19T09:58:00.000Z	VieQ	mattofak	I know this would not be the appropriate channel to say this
