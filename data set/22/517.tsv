2012-02-05T04:35:00.000Z	daniel___		I'm having trouble with my usb ports in Ubuntu. When I plug in it either won't detect it or partially detects it but can't mount it. lsusb will freeze when I try it
2012-02-05T04:36:00.000Z	daniel___		Can someone help with getting Usb drives working?
2012-02-05T04:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	Whats going on?
2012-02-05T04:39:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	I'm trying to connect my Droid X and Fuze v2 to my Ubuntu laptop. The usb is working very sporadically, one day things connect the next nothing. When I run lsusb it will freeze sometimes or detect the device but I can't mount it.
2012-02-05T04:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	I thought you meant HD's  I'm not  familiar in that area. :)
2012-02-05T04:41:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	k, is there any where I can get some help because this started up randomly when I somehow updated to 11.04 without knowing it and it's a pain in the butt
2012-02-05T04:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	some help here I assume your running ubuntu, there is alsp ##linux, being specific of the devices is helpful. :)
2012-02-05T04:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	are you unmounting with a right click safely remove device as well?
2012-02-05T04:45:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	it won't even mount them. when I remove them I safely remove them usually
2012-02-05T04:45:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	but lets assume I didn't once
2012-02-05T04:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	cool, hard to say if that is a factor but personaly I'm retentive with my externals that way.
2012-02-05T04:47:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	anyways I'm normally pretty good about safely removing
2012-02-05T04:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	ubuntu is pretty forgiving there but the devices may not be, just guessing though.
2012-02-05T04:50:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	I'll check the devices for errors on windows but there shouldn't be anything wrong with them. I've recently reformatted the fuze and it was working fine then just stopped
2012-02-05T04:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	you have to rember though that linux and windows are completely different so no erors in windows is not a cause and effect in linux.
2012-02-05T04:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	have you been in the #android channel as well? you know how to search for or get a channel list I assume.
2012-02-05T05:05:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	I'm back and my device mounted. I had to have it plugged in before Ubuntu started up
2012-02-05T05:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	hmm, do you have it in fstab?
2012-02-05T05:06:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	One second
2012-02-05T05:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	I wouldn't just wondering.
2012-02-05T05:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	daniel___	cool hope it continues to work.
2012-02-05T05:07:00.000Z	daniel___	urlin2u	I have a strong feeling it will stop working next time I restart without having something plugged in like this
