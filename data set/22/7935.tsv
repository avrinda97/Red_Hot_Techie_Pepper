2006-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	Mrono		make a fat32 partition outta my linux, well part of it
2006-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	I think you can rerun install from cd and use the partitioning tool to resize...write changes and then abort install after the partition is resized
2006-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	from what I have read yes
2006-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	are you planning on reinstalling ubuntu?
2006-03-03T11:48:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	simple thing would be to reinstall ubuntu if you have no data presently on ubuntu partition that you wan tt o keep
2006-03-03T11:49:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	is this two seperate drive or one with two aprtitions?
2006-03-03T11:49:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	can you get into ubuntu and back up to dvd or cd-r?
2006-03-03T11:50:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	what happened that made ubunut install unreachable?
2006-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	Mrono	navarone	I have enough space to backup my files
2006-03-03T11:54:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	are you able to mount the ubuntu partition and access files? Plus are you able to run gparted or similar and resize windows partition to make fat 32?
2006-03-03T11:55:00.000Z	Mrono	navarone	gparted?
2006-03-03T11:56:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	dl sysrescuecd and boot and use qtparted...you can resize the windows partition and have a shared parttion for windows and linux then transfer files
2006-03-03T11:56:00.000Z	navarone	Mrono	qtparted and gparted are like Partition Magic
