2005-05-05T11:05:00.000Z	pestilence		is there a good program to manage mp3's, something that will help me rotate the songs that are on my portable mp3 player from the songs that are on my hard drive?
2005-05-05T11:05:00.000Z	pestilence		i'm looking at rhythmbox, but it doesn't seem to have the capability to actually *move* mp3's
2005-05-05T11:06:00.000Z	pestilence		perhaps i'm wrong, in which case, somebody please correct me.
2005-05-05T11:06:00.000Z	nickrud	pestilence	rhythmbox is a *player*, nt a mangar
2005-05-05T11:06:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	you should tell that to whoever put "management" in the about screen ;)
2005-05-05T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	pestilence	the about box was written by "management"
2005-05-05T11:07:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	nice.
2005-05-05T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	pestilence	no, that's not what you mean :)
2005-05-05T11:45:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	it depends on how many 9's there are.
2005-05-05T11:45:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	if there are enough nines, it is actually 2.
2005-05-05T11:45:00.000Z	nickrud	pestilence	and you can never step into the same river :)
2005-05-05T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	pestilence	I wasn't being flippant, it's an old greek philosophy joke
2005-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	oh, i don't get it.  in any case, i was being a math nerd for a second.
2005-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	nickrud	pestilence	then you know that you can always halve the distance, and never reach the destination :)
2005-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	sure
2005-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	ok
2005-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	what's so special about thomas guide that makes it difficult to use under qemu?
2005-05-05T11:54:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	huh?  can't you set the command line paramter telling it to map /dev/cdrom to the d: drive?
2005-05-05T11:54:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	i don't have much experience with qemu, but i successfully installed windows 2k off a cd.
2005-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	strange.
2005-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	pestilence	nickrud	how about copying an installation over the network into qemu?
2005-08-09T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	pestilence	I se what you mean, sorry about that
