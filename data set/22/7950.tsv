2006-07-14T13:03:00.000Z	filemover		hi i keep on gettting Authentication failure when trying to change to root in a terminal but I know for certain what my password is can anyone help
2006-07-14T13:03:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	how are you "trying to change to a root terminal" ?
2006-07-14T13:03:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	the root account is disabled use sudo
2006-07-14T13:04:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	don't do that
2006-07-14T13:05:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	just use sudo -i if you need a root shell
2006-07-14T13:05:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	but in general it's advised to just prefix your commands with sudo
2006-07-14T13:05:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	then type sudo /path/to/priviliged/command
2006-07-14T13:06:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	then type your password
2006-07-14T11:10:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	be careful moving things around as root
2006-07-14T11:11:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	are these files/directories in your home directory?
2006-07-14T11:11:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	just use chown -R youruser:youruser /home/youruser
2006-07-14T11:12:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	but put sudo in front of it
2006-07-14T11:12:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	that will fix it
2006-07-14T11:12:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	it's the same as your username usually
2006-07-14T11:14:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	yes
2006-07-14T11:18:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	right click the file and tell me what the permissions are
2006-07-14T11:18:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	and the owner/group
2006-07-14T11:19:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	and what directory is the file in ?
2006-07-14T11:20:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	ok, what are the permissions on the My Music directory?
2006-07-14T11:21:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	 and your user is the owner/group for the files and directories?
2006-07-14T11:23:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	what did you see?
2006-07-14T11:30:00.000Z	polpak	filemover	chmod changes permissions chown changes ownership
