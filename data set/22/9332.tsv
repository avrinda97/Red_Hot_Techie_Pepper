2006-09-20T05:56:00.000Z	Daynah		sudo fdisk /dev/sda
2006-09-20T05:56:00.000Z	Daynah		Unable to open /dev/sda
2006-09-20T05:56:00.000Z	Daynah		And then I pout at my computer. I literally say "pout"
2006-09-20T05:58:00.000Z	Daynah		No, the problem was it wouldn't mount. And then the problem was it was NTFS or something and the NTFS mount thing wouldn't work so I said fuck it it's backed up and used the gui formatter, and it stalled and wowuldn't do anything (my computer wasn't making normal "formatty sounds") so I rebooted to try again using fdisk, and the gui stopped letting me press the format button and knowing the size and then fdisk said that. I fear I broke it. I got a good deal o
2006-09-20T05:59:00.000Z	Daynah		Vor, what am I looking for in dmesg | less cause it showed a lot?
2006-09-20T06:01:00.000Z	Daynah		OH HEY I can scroll down! You'd think after a year I'd be able to figure out terminal... ~slaps her face~ Okay, Vor. Monkey... type monkey do.
2006-09-20T06:03:00.000Z	Daynah		Vor, and now that I've scrolled -_-' dearie me I need some tea, no there's no sda there, but lemme do the cfdisk
2006-09-20T06:04:00.000Z	Daynah		Vor: AH! We should go back to fdisk! this one calls it a fatal error! FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive
2006-09-20T06:04:00.000Z	Daynah		                          Press any key to exit cfdisk
2006-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	is your drive plugged in properly and functional?
2006-09-20T06:06:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	does "dmesg | grep disk" say anything useful?
2006-09-20T06:07:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	what about "dmesg | grep sd" - are there any useful error messages?
2006-09-20T06:08:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	i'd check to see that the disk is properly plugged in. Is it recognised by the BIOS?
2006-09-20T06:10:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	preesing all of the buttons usually works! :)
2006-09-20T06:11:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	iirc, SATA drives should have 2 cables attached to them - a thin one and a fatter one. Check they are both attached
2006-09-20T06:12:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	that would be sensible
2006-09-20T06:14:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	i have no idea what a health disk is
2006-09-20T06:15:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	well, it doesn't sound as if it would hurt ;)
2006-09-20T06:19:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	success?
2006-09-20T10:27:00.000Z	mcphail	Daynah	sounded like a hardware problem :(
