2012-01-17T19:02:00.000Z	maslen		Is it possible to reserve some memory to be used for 'new' applications?
2012-01-17T19:02:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	not sure what you mean
2012-01-17T19:02:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	Considering I have 4 GB of RAM, and am not using Unity, that's kinda sad.
2012-01-17T19:03:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	that's not correct behavior. either you simply *are* maxed out, and you need to keep fewer programs open (or use swap), or there is a bug.
2012-01-17T19:03:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	what does "free" report?
2012-01-17T19:03:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	Mem:       4055972    2699184    1356788          0     157872     802752 , -/+ buffers/cache:    1738560    2317412
2012-01-17T19:04:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	Note that I did close an ubuntu 11.10 VM, which was using ~1GB.
2012-01-17T19:04:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	But even with that running, I should of had significantly more RAM available .
2012-01-17T19:04:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	hm pastebin the output of "ps aux" then
2012-01-17T19:05:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	http://pastie.org/3201410
2012-01-17T19:06:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	I had looked through that, but didn't see any obvious problems.
2012-01-17T19:11:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	yeah me neither, but i think the sums are correct. if you sum all the RSS from your processes, the result is 1698189. that, plus 802752 of cache, is  about 2500000, and your used memory is only slightly above that
2012-01-17T19:11:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	so really, the stuff *is* taking up all that memory, and there's not much you can do about it
2012-01-17T19:12:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	do you have any swap? it could help (or it could make things thrash, i dunno)
2012-01-17T19:13:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	I do. Barely any of it's used though, because RAM is available :)
2012-01-17T19:13:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	I don't think ps is including the 'freeable' RAM.
2012-01-17T19:14:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	what do you mean by freeable RAM? VSZ is what the processes have allocated - and it's *not* really assigned to physical memory until it's needed. RSS is what actually needed to be written into memory.
2012-01-17T19:15:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	I was under the impression the OS expands to fill as much memory as possible, to limit the required amount of disk accessess.
2012-01-17T19:16:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	yes, it does, that's the "cache", but that's *already* freed automatically (or swapped out) when required
2012-01-17T19:16:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	it's those 800mb "free" is reporting
2012-01-17T19:19:00.000Z	LjL	maslen	but, if that "cache" is still at 800mb (or still high, anyway) after you try to run Eclipse and it fails, then something is wrong.
2012-01-17T19:22:00.000Z	maslen	LjL	Thanks for trying.
