2011-03-22T17:13:00.000Z	Jinxed-		Is there a way to start a program when your computer boots up that is NOT crontab related?
2011-03-22T17:13:00.000Z	Jinxed-		with root
2011-03-22T17:13:00.000Z	Jinxed-		privliages
2011-03-22T17:13:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	yes
2011-03-22T17:15:00.000Z	Jinxed-	czardoz	what is SUID program
2011-03-22T17:16:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	a program that runs with root privilages, but it is NOT recommended
2011-03-22T17:16:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	for security reasons
2011-03-22T17:17:00.000Z	Jinxed-	czardoz	it is from my vendor... if I could get it to run at regular privlages I would love that
2011-03-22T17:17:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	you mean you just want it to run at startup?
2011-03-22T17:18:00.000Z	Jinxed-	czardoz	correct... it is my mpeg encoder
2011-03-22T17:18:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	add it to your ~/.xinitrc
2011-03-22T17:19:00.000Z	Jinxed-	czardoz	I'm not familar with that how would I do that... that is actually something I haven't tried yet
2011-03-22T17:19:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	it is just like any other bash script
2011-03-22T17:27:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	no
2011-03-22T17:28:00.000Z	Jinxed-	czardoz	how will I be able to run my script with sudo rights then?
2011-03-22T17:29:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	as I said, SUID programs run with root privilages whenever they are run
2011-03-22T17:29:00.000Z	Jinxed-	czardoz	I'm sorry I don't understand what you mean
2011-03-22T17:29:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	google for step by steap instructions :)
2011-03-22T17:30:00.000Z	Jinxed-	czardoz	holy cow... are you saying I could just do sudo chmod +s /my/program
2011-03-22T17:31:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	yes indeed :)
2011-03-22T17:37:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	if you set the SUID bit, it'll run as root :)
2011-03-22T18:39:00.000Z	czardoz	Jinxed-	good for you :o)
