2007-07-23T10:30:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		oh right. Still, for a noobie Synaptic is great.
2007-07-23T10:30:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		its great for non noobs too :D
2007-07-23T10:31:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		Anyone know if I need to restart anything to make new users useable?
2007-07-23T10:31:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		I just made a user but she cant login on the network.
2007-07-23T10:32:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		lol
2007-07-23T10:33:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		if you're loggin in ubuntu from windows, you shouldnt need admin rights should you?
2007-07-23T10:34:00.000Z	burner	nicholaspaul	define "loggin in" ssh? http? ftp? vnc? nx?
2007-07-23T10:34:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	burner	Login thru Network Places.
2007-07-23T10:34:00.000Z	burner	nicholaspaul	in that case, it depends on the security of the files and if the user has access or not... you don't need to be admin by any menas
2007-07-23T10:35:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	burner	oh i see. Where do I check off which files can be accessed by the new user? Basically, its a whole folder (pictures).
2007-07-23T10:35:00.000Z	burner	nicholaspaul	right click, properties
2007-07-23T10:36:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	burner	so for 'Others' (under permissions) it should read 'Read and Write' ?
2007-07-23T10:37:00.000Z	burner	nicholaspaul	sure... you added that user to the samba users list via "sudo smbpasswd -a username" right?
2007-07-23T10:37:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	burner	no, i just added the user with the User Groups GUI
2007-07-23T10:38:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	burner	AHHHHH of course.....LOL thanks mate! [slaps forehead![
2007-07-23T10:38:00.000Z	burner	nicholaspaul	it's simply "sudo smbpasswd -a username" to add a new user :)
2007-07-23T10:38:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	burner	oh. . . . . right.. . . . .i knew that... :S Thanks again :)
2007-07-23T10:38:00.000Z	burner	nicholaspaul	np, have a good one
2007-07-23T10:39:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	burner	U2
