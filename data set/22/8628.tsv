2005-06-25T10:57:00.000Z	vHintswen		hello
2005-06-25T10:57:00.000Z	vHintswen		finally someone who can help lol
2005-06-25T10:57:00.000Z	vHintswen		i dunno how to install ubuntu
2005-06-25T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	you need to be way more specific
2005-06-25T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	configure your bios to boot the cd
2005-06-25T11:00:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	depends entirely on the bios
2005-06-25T15:15:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	if you want help, you need to ask clear, informed questions
2005-06-25T15:16:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	where? for example?
2005-06-25T15:17:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	"don't work"?  you can't see anything printed when you type?
2005-06-25T15:18:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	so, what command?
2005-06-25T15:18:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	most commands don't print anything at all
2005-06-25T15:19:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	(unless something went wrong)
2005-06-25T15:19:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	well, of course, that means there's no file called psaux in /dev
2005-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	ls /etc
2005-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	you're just confusing everyone by claiming things like "isn't responding to commands", which is clearly untrue
2005-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	really? what about when you run 'vim'?
2005-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	vHintswen	bob2	can i pm you?
2005-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	why?
2005-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	what's your native language?
2005-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	just explain in here
2005-06-25T07:35:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	right
2005-06-25T07:37:00.000Z	bob2	vHintswen	you haven't explained your problem yet
