2008-07-10T10:23:00.000Z	Shady		howdy folks
2008-07-10T10:24:00.000Z	Shady		I am wondering if anyone can help me out a problem installing Ubuntu as a dual boot on a RAID0?
2008-07-10T10:24:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	yea i have done that
2008-07-10T10:26:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	oh are you using a RAID chipset instead of Software raid?
2008-07-10T10:27:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	ok i might suggest sticking with software raid.  it'll be a lot easier to manage
2008-07-10T10:27:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	 contrary to belief, the software raid will be as fast because most on-board RAID chipsets still use the CPU anyway.
2008-07-10T10:28:00.000Z	Shady	xtknight	ok i even tried to use Partition Manager to break it up but it never actually made the partition, it just did nothing
2008-07-10T10:28:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	you will have to dissociate the drives from your RAID controller or install them as JBOD ("Just A Bunch Of Disks"(nonraid) to the controller)
2008-07-10T10:30:00.000Z	Shady	xtknight	so basically if i want to use my RAID setup, I still have to lose everything and reinstall OS's?
2008-07-10T10:30:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	you can not use windows on a linux software raid
2008-07-10T10:30:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	it will have to be on a separate 'drive'
2008-07-10T10:31:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	you need the Alternate CD to use Software raid
2008-07-10T10:34:00.000Z	Shady	xtknight	(and others helping =), I am already using XP on a RAID0 setup, AM I correct in interpreting this all to mean that in order to achieve dual boot I will have to start over and reinstall the OS's?
2008-07-10T10:34:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	that depends if your RAID0 has already spanned the entirety of any disk space you have left.
2008-07-10T10:35:00.000Z	Shady	xtknight	I doubt that because i have 500GB and barley a quarter of it used
2008-07-10T10:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	with the alternate disc then you can choose to create two partitions on each disk, and flag these as RAID.  you then enter the RAID (mdadm) Configuration
2008-07-10T10:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	you need to make sure your current raid0 partition is not allocated to the whole disk
2008-07-10T10:37:00.000Z	Shady	xtknight	I did allocate the entire disk for the RAID
2008-07-10T10:38:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	basically, your RAID controller is called 'fakeraid'
2008-07-10T10:38:00.000Z	xtknight	Shady	so in a way if you can get ubuntu to recognize your raid, you can resize down your windows paritions and install linux on the same raid controller
2008-07-10T10:39:00.000Z	Shady	xtknight	and M_Cheevy; ty guys i will look into that for a while =)
2008-07-10T10:40:00.000Z	Shady	xtknight	and M_Cheevy, would you suggest that I dissolve the RAID and just use the 2 disks seperately, partitioning one for both file systems and partitioning the other for their respectives storages?
