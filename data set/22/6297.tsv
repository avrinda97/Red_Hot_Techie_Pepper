2006-11-17T10:42:00.000Z	ion		can you guys tell  which kind of software I  use for graphic manipulation..?
2006-11-17T10:43:00.000Z	haxality		it's in Applications > Graphics
2006-11-17T10:43:00.000Z	ion	haxality	something more powerfull...
2006-11-17T10:43:00.000Z	haxality	ion	the gimp is nearly on par with adobe photoshop.
2006-11-17T10:43:00.000Z	haxality	ion	what is it that you want to do that it can't do
2006-11-17T10:44:00.000Z	haxality		yeah
2006-11-17T10:44:00.000Z	haxality		heh
2006-11-17T10:44:00.000Z	haxality		it obliterates MS paint, that's all I know!
2006-11-17T10:44:00.000Z	ion	haxality	like I wanna edit some pics...
2006-11-17T10:44:00.000Z	haxality		right.. but how do you want to edit them?
2006-11-17T10:45:00.000Z	haxality	ion	you have to be a little more specific, afaik the gimp can do most generic image editing things
2006-11-17T10:45:00.000Z	haxality		so.. does anyone know how to configure Network Manager?
2006-11-17T10:45:00.000Z	haxality		:O
2006-11-17T10:46:00.000Z	ion	haxality	like take all things in the pic apart and rebuild it again but in another way...
2006-11-17T10:46:00.000Z	haxality		ok, ion, the gimp can definitely do that
2006-11-17T10:46:00.000Z	haxality	ion	have you ever used photoshop or any semi-complex image manipulation program before?
2006-11-17T10:47:00.000Z	haxality		ahhhh, thanks MarcN
2006-11-17T10:47:00.000Z	haxality		I couldn't find that ANYWHERE on the entire internet
2006-11-17T10:48:00.000Z	ion		haxality:yeah but I don't wanna buy photoshop and I don't have it..that's the point...
