2009-06-23T00:25:00.000Z	xiven		Why is my wireless soo damn slow.
2009-06-23T00:25:00.000Z	xiven		My wireless is at 64%, but I'm not getting much out of it at all
2009-06-23T00:25:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	Please mind your language here.
2010-02-25T21:46:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	LTS releases are supported for 3 years on the desktop, 5 on the server. Normal releases are only supported for 18 months.
2010-04-08T07:59:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, how did you 'manually remove' a package?
2010-04-08T20:57:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	Please mind your language.  Yes, it is.
2010-04-08T20:59:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	What are you trying to reconfigure?
2010-04-08T21:41:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	Most people don't have any issues.  If you have a specific problem please ask.
2010-04-08T22:23:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	The config files are in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
2010-04-08T22:23:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	Is that what you're asking?
2010-04-08T22:25:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	use   sudo a2enmod php5    this will setup the necessary files in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
2010-04-08T22:29:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	File a bug.  I don't understand why you think this is broken though.
2010-04-08T22:30:00.000Z	xiven	Pici	because apache had been trying to download php files with fresh installs of Apache2+PHP5 which were according to wiki instructions! And I tried on 4 fresh installs...
2010-04-08T22:35:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	php5 with apache worked out of the box for me.  I personally haven't been able to recreate this weird problem myself. (note, I'm not an Ubuntu developer)
2010-04-08T22:35:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	Sorry to hear that.
2010-04-08T22:36:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	Have you filed bugs?
2010-04-09T00:01:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	Have you restarted apache since installing those other php packages? (not sure if they're called modules in php)?
2010-04-21T21:00:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	You may want to start in #kubuntu-devel
2011-05-09T20:47:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	How would sshfs help you there?
2011-05-09T20:55:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	sshfs is for mapping an outbound ssh connection on your server to a mountpoint. It won't help any other clients that ssh into it to get access to files on the server.
2011-05-09T21:01:00.000Z	Pici	xiven	If you're talking about browsing the contents of your server from a Windows client, you can use any program that supports scp or sftp. Filezilla and WinSCP are two popular free programs that can do that.
