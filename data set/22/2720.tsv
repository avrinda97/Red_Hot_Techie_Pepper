2009-03-26T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	bluenzo	read that please: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecommendedSources for the recommended way to set up your repositories

2009-03-26T01:48:00.000Z	guntbert	bluenzo	no need to be sorry (was just a hint to make life easier for all of us)- as for 3rd party repos: I don't trust them generally, but if I "need" something I add the repo to my sources
2009-03-26T01:50:00.000Z	bluenzo	guntbert	are most apps free?
2009-03-26T01:50:00.000Z	bluenzo		are there any closed source apps? lol
2009-03-26T01:50:00.000Z	bluenzo		oops :S
2009-03-26T01:50:00.000Z	bluenzo		sorry i did it again
2009-03-26T01:51:00.000Z	guntbert	bluenzo	look at the link I sent you, there different kinds of repos, but *most* are free (as in free speech)
