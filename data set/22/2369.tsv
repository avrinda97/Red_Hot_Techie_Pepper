2010-09-23T15:33:00.000Z	tas	vnc	but when i open bluetooth here on computer, it says its turned on, because I can see it showing "Turn off bluetooth"
2010-09-23T15:34:00.000Z	vnc	tas	do you have any other bluetooth enabled device to test if its the computer end or awkward bluetooth protocol stacks?
2010-09-23T15:34:00.000Z	tas	vnc	I don't have it right now.
2010-09-23T15:35:00.000Z	tas	vnc	and I have 9.10
2010-09-23T15:39:00.000Z	vnc	tas	it would be best to try another bluetooth device to ensure the computer end is working as some devices dont see each other due to the bluetooth firmware they run
2010-09-23T15:39:00.000Z	tas	vnc	>.< ok
2010-09-23T15:39:00.000Z	tas	vnc	thankyou btw
