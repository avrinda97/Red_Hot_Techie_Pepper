2007-08-01T15:50:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	pike__	that worked, thanks.
2007-08-01T15:55:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	pike__	now I don't get a login screen
2007-08-01T15:56:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	what did you delete?
2007-08-01T15:58:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	mkdir /home/heather; chown heather:heather /home/heather
2007-08-01T15:58:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	using sudo
2007-08-02T16:02:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	pike__	that worked, thanks, can you tell me what was wrong?
2007-08-02T16:02:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	it needed to create the .config files but couldnt make them as the path didnt exist
2007-08-02T16:04:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	unlike windows you dont have a registry all the user config stuff is stored in your home. it is very convenient acually because if something is screw you dont have to hunt for it just delete the .config file and reopen the app. its like you opened it for the first time. ls -a /home/heather to see the hidden . files
2007-08-02T16:15:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	pike__	still no luck, sometimes I get to desktop, sometimes I get a gnome error, this last time panel opened about 10 times trying to login
2007-08-02T16:16:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	can ya sudo apt-get install fluxbox   i mean at least give her another window manager for now or xubuntu-desktop
2007-08-02T16:18:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	egads
2007-08-02T16:19:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	sudo chown -R heather:heather /home/heather
2007-08-02T16:31:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	pike__	what does sudo chown -R do?  It seems to of worked.
2007-08-02T16:31:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	so any subdirectories and files are also chowned
2007-08-02T16:33:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	yeah the only issue would be symlinks and thats not a huge deal. wont really break anything i dont think
2007-08-02T16:34:00.000Z	pike__	MilitantPotato	safest way is http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/29/move-home-to-its-own-partition/
