2006-10-11T14:24:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	you want a picture for your terminal?
2006-10-11T14:26:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	I just want to change the gnome background image on a computer via ssh
2006-10-11T14:26:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	id start looking in USER/.gnome
2006-10-11T14:27:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	first step, how to change my own background image using a command in a terminal that i've openned on gnome?
2006-10-11T14:28:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	ask yourself do you need to change a background image from a terminal?
2006-10-11T14:29:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	that doesn't answer my question
2006-10-11T14:30:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	look for the gnome config file for your user most likly, not sure where it is do a ls -a in your home dir
2006-10-11T14:30:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	but if your using SSH you dont see a background so you might as well wait till your home and have the gui to when you will actaully see the change
2006-10-11T14:31:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	I know that
2006-10-11T14:31:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	It's not for me
2006-10-11T14:31:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	ill look around for the location of the file
2006-10-11T14:31:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	It's to make a joke to my girlfriend actually :)
2006-10-11T14:32:00.000Z	Goomie		cd .gnome
2006-10-11T14:32:00.000Z	Goomie		ls
2006-10-11T14:32:00.000Z	Goomie		whoops
2006-10-11T14:35:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	still there
2006-10-11T14:35:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	should be an xml file in ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background
2006-10-11T14:36:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	I found it
2006-10-11T14:37:00.000Z	Goomie	kuoylam	where was it at?
2006-10-11T14:49:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml
2006-10-11T14:51:00.000Z	kuoylam	Goomie	but there should be a command line to do that
