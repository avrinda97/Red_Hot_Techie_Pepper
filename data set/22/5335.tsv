2007-05-31T09:56:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	rococo	i dont want to extract it
2007-05-31T09:56:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	rococo	i want to install it
2007-05-31T09:57:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	usually when you download software to install from those files, they contain directories that you need to configure and install from source (there's usually a README in the directory that tells you the best way to go about this in a few easy steps)
2007-05-31T09:58:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	rococo	lol i extracted it and its a exe file
2007-05-31T09:59:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	that's... rather unusual for linux. there's no install instructions from wherever you downloaded this file?
2007-05-31T10:00:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		rococo kindof
2007-05-31T10:01:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	and?
2007-05-31T10:01:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		oh god!
2007-05-31T10:02:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	rococo	well i have no idea how to do this since the file has no apparent extension
2007-05-31T10:02:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	rococo	it just says its an executible in properties
2007-05-31T10:02:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	I thought you said it was an .exe file
2007-05-31T10:02:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	ah
2007-05-31T10:02:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		did the niven server die?
2007-05-31T10:03:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	if you trust the source, you can just run it from command line by typing "./filename" or "/path/to/filename"
2007-05-31T10:04:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	I mean, as long as it's a proper standalone executable and not an install file of some sort. If you want to be able to run it from command line at any time, put it in one of your paths, such as /usr/bin (you'll need to do this as sudo)
2007-05-31T10:04:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	but I'd say try running it first to make sure it works
2007-05-31T10:05:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		rococo it looks like its working so far, (the coding looks like perl ,so i should be able to edit it anyways)
2007-05-31T10:06:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	oh, yeah, perl is fine since it's interpreted. you can run perl scripts using the "perl" command, but you see that line at the beginning that says #!/usr/bin/perl? That tells UNIX how to run it without you needing to specify
2007-05-31T10:08:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		rococo i know im a perl programmer
2007-05-31T10:09:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	rococo	great now it says my mouse is nonexistant
2007-05-31T10:10:00.000Z	rococo	Comrade-Sergei	well, that sounds like a problem with the program
