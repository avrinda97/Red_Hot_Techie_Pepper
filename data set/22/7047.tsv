2006-06-18T06:26:00.000Z	tsarkon		hello. one thing I can't understand is why XGL with all the plugins don't include the "sorter" plugin (the one that resembles expos in MacOSX with sorting windows)
2006-06-18T06:26:00.000Z	tsarkon		is it too experimental, so it's not enabled by default? is it possible to enable it without a recompile?
2006-06-18T06:27:00.000Z	tsarkon		evince is GNOME's
2006-06-18T06:29:00.000Z	snoops	tsarkon	expose is the one which takes all windows, then resizes them and shows them on the current desktop right?
2006-06-18T06:29:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	yes
2006-06-18T06:29:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	it doesn't work
2006-06-18T06:30:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	well, I am using the cvs builds from 2006-06-17
2006-06-18T06:32:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	    Version: 0.0.13+cvs20060617
2006-06-18T06:32:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	is that the one you are using?
2006-06-18T06:33:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	%Bsudo aptitude show compiz-vanilla
2006-06-18T06:33:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	sudo aptitude show compiz-vanilla
2006-06-18T06:36:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	oh.. thanks
2006-06-18T06:40:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	I am using compiz-vanilla, compiz-vanilla-gnome .. I think that's why
2006-06-18T06:41:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	alright
2006-06-18T06:42:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	ah
2006-06-18T06:43:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	alright.. so am I in a moment
2006-06-18T07:26:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	hello again
2006-06-18T07:27:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	this is a much more instable version of Compiz
2006-06-18T07:27:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	I had to disable "dock" and "fade"
2006-06-18T07:28:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	now I need to stresstest this version for a couple of days before I can decide whether to keep using it, or switch back to the vanilla version
2006-06-18T07:59:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	well.. I didn't know the more fancy version worked so well
2006-06-18T07:59:00.000Z	tsarkon	snoops	this stress test of mine clearly shows that I can trust it. I should just in case, though, make all these idle in the background at night, while asleep and check back at the computer afterwards
