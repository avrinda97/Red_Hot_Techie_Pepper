2007-04-10T15:06:00.000Z	infoclog		how can anyone know what user and groups the webserver is running on ??
2007-04-10T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	"anyone"?  inside or out?
2007-04-10T15:07:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	i mean..i as an admin..how can i know  which user and group the webserver is run with
2007-04-10T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	apache or apache2?
2007-04-10T15:08:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	apache2
2007-04-10T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf under all the type config stuff, and above the logformat stuff ,theres a "user" and "group" directive
2007-04-10T15:11:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	found it. another question...what is the signifigance of this user and group ?
2007-04-10T15:13:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	that's the user/group that apache runs as.  Apache does everything as that user.  Um, if a file in /var/www isn't readable by www-data, the webserver can't read it, etc
2007-04-10T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	the user is already created.
2007-04-10T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	you'd want to make that directory owned by www-data:www-data and make it so it's only readable by it's owner and/or group
2007-04-10T15:15:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	thats what i did.. i created a dir with www-data.www-data ug+rwx
2007-04-10T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	where is that dir?
2007-04-10T15:16:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	but i cannot enter this directory now.
2007-04-10T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	that's correct.  You don't have permission.
2007-04-10T15:16:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	this dir is in /var/local/
2007-04-10T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	why not /var/www?
2007-04-10T15:17:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	would it not the same.. whats the signifigance of /var/www
2007-04-10T15:20:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	/var/www is the web data directory
2007-04-10T15:20:00.000Z	Flannel	infoclog	apache is already serving /var/www, anything you put in there will be accessible by people who browse to your computer
2007-04-10T15:21:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	hmmm..lets see . i am checking
2007-04-10T15:46:00.000Z	infoclog	Flannel	even after putting the directory into /var/www, i as an admin cannot go inside the directory
