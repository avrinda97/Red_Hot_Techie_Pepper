2004-12-12T17:59:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	I'm sure it's the same with emacs
2004-12-12T06:00:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	But I can't really tell
2004-12-12T06:00:00.000Z	nessmuk	theine	a while back I was flush and bought a Dvortyboard for my linux box. It's cool but I'd like to know how to change the keymap
2004-12-12T06:02:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	I always forget how to change the keyboard layout, but it's very easy
2004-12-12T06:02:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	take a look at /usr/share/keymaps/i386/dvorak
2004-12-12T06:03:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	in the console, you can just do ``loadkeys dvorak'', and something very similar under X...
2004-12-12T06:04:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	why not just use the gnome keyboard preferences?
2004-12-12T06:06:00.000Z	nessmuk	theine	I tried loadkeys but it didn't work. Can't see the option to select in the gnome prefs
2004-12-12T06:07:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	it's under ``desktop preferences -> keyboard -> layouts''
2004-12-12T06:07:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	there are several dvorak layouts in the right hand side
2004-12-12T06:32:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	What's wrong with the keyboard preferences?
2004-12-12T06:32:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	...under gnome?
2004-12-12T06:10:00.000Z	nessmuk	theine	I only see scandinavian layouts, no English
2004-12-12T06:14:00.000Z	nessmuk	theine	when I ls in /usr/share/keymaps/i386/ it shows dvorak as one of the files
2004-12-12T06:14:00.000Z	nessmuk	theine	how do I load that?
2004-12-12T06:20:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	just use the keyboard preferences under gnome, that works for sure
2004-12-12T06:30:00.000Z	nessmuk	theine	I can see dvorak in /usr/share/keys but I get an error when I try loadkeys in the console
2004-12-12T06:30:00.000Z	nessmuk	theine	it says Couldnt get a file descriptor referring to the console
2004-12-12T06:32:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	yes, loadkeys doesn't work under X
2004-12-12T06:34:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	now i know, do ``setxkbmap dvorak''
2004-12-12T06:34:00.000Z	theine	nessmuk	instead of ``loadkeys dvorak''
