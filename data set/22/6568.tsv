2006-12-06T12:03:00.000Z	vcef		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild is outdated
2006-12-06T12:03:00.000Z	vcef		what package do I need to instal to be able to do make xconfig
2006-12-06T12:03:00.000Z	vcef		or at least make menuconfig
2006-12-06T12:04:00.000Z	ArrenLex	vcef	when you run ./configure, it will tell you what it needs.
2006-12-06T12:04:00.000Z	vcef		there's no configure script in my kernel source dir
2006-12-06T12:04:00.000Z	vcef	Lin	I did
2006-12-06T12:05:00.000Z	vcef	Lin	what do you mean? it's not compressed
2006-12-06T12:08:00.000Z	vcef	Lin	thank you but I know how to uncompress archive file and I know the difference between archive file and uncompressed directory which is full of files
2006-12-06T12:08:00.000Z	vcef		all I am asking is what packages do I need to be able to do make menuconfig or make xconfig
2006-12-06T12:09:00.000Z	vcef		I presume that these would be some kind of developer libraries for curses or qt or whatever
2006-12-06T12:10:00.000Z	vcef	Lin	well. now I remember. You're right. I've installed it yesterday, unpacked, erased and forgot
2006-12-06T12:10:00.000Z	vcef		what download?
2006-12-06T12:11:00.000Z	vcef		sure.
2006-12-06T12:11:00.000Z	vcef		But I'm still no step further to making my configuration.
2006-12-06T12:11:00.000Z	vcef		cause I refuse to manually edit config file or run oldconfig
2006-12-06T12:12:00.000Z	vcef		crap
2006-12-06T12:12:00.000Z	vcef	Lin	thank you very much.
2006-12-06T12:13:00.000Z	vcef	Lin	May be so bold to ask also for package for compiling graphic configurator?
2006-12-06T12:14:00.000Z	vcef		I'm missing both - qt and gtk dev packages
2006-12-06T12:15:00.000Z	vcef	Lin	I should porbably learn how to search for package which provides certain file ...
2006-12-06T12:15:00.000Z	vcef		that'll stop all these silly questions of mine
2006-12-06T12:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	vcef	you can do that using the second box on packages.ubuntu.com
