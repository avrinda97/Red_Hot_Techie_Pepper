2007-07-08T05:16:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D		Hi all! Is there a way, when I try to enable desktop effects in Feisty, to stop package manager from installing nvidia-glx ?
2007-07-08T05:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	Why do you want nvidia-glx not installed?
2007-07-08T05:18:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	because I installed the latest 100.14.11 from nvidia.
2007-07-08T05:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	You can just tell it not to load the one from restricted modules
2007-07-08T05:19:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	how do I do that ?
2007-07-08T05:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	I believe it's in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
2007-07-08T05:24:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	I should edit linux-restricted-modules-common not to download? where exactly in the file? do you happen to know?
2007-07-08T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	add it to where it says DISABLED_MODULES
2007-07-08T05:26:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	so I add "nvidia-glx" in DISABLED_MODULES ?
2007-07-08T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	Yes
2007-07-08T05:27:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	thank you very much I'll try it (lol sorry but i'm a noob :) )
2007-07-08T05:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	No problem :) You know that you have to re-install whenever there is a kernel upgrade if you don't use the Ubuntu package for nvidia right?
2007-07-08T05:30:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	yes I know that, but LOL I don't know how to tell when a kernel update happened and what exactly is a kernel :D
2007-07-08T05:30:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	I have installed Ubuntu Feisty for about .... 10 days now, I'm an UBER-Noob
2007-07-08T05:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	That is why I generally recommend people use the Ubuntu packages even if they are a little older
2007-07-08T05:31:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	you have a point but the problem is that 'I have problems with X module and Nvidia kernel module
2007-07-08T05:32:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	whenever I try to enable Desktop Effects I get the error message GDM Failed to start
2007-07-08T05:33:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	both nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-new
2007-07-08T05:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Judg3_Dr34D	Was that only with the packaged drivers?
2007-07-08T05:34:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	yes, or at least I think so [missed an a there] 
2007-07-08T05:35:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	so I did sudo nano /etc/x11/xorg.conf and change driver to "nv"
2007-07-08T05:36:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	Jordan_U	:) Yeeeaaay! I learned something new today... tab completion :D thanks
