2011-01-19T13:49:00.000Z	Zaca12		Hi there, I currently have a drive in my machine that i need to mount
2011-01-19T13:49:00.000Z	Zaca12		how could I check which file system its using?
2011-01-19T13:50:00.000Z	Zaca12		dont i need something more specific than that in order to mount the drive?
2011-01-19T13:51:00.000Z	Zaca12		thanks, trying that now
2011-01-19T13:53:00.000Z	Zaca12		and now since the first harddrive has been mounted, can i check and make sure which file system it is because i need to actually replicate these drives exactly. I am trying to make a copy between the two
2011-01-19T13:54:00.000Z	Zaca12		I was thinking about using 'dd' what would you say is the best method?
2011-01-19T13:54:00.000Z	Zaca12		yes, do i need them to be mounted to use dd?
2011-01-19T13:54:00.000Z	rumpe1	Zaca12	no
2011-01-19T13:55:00.000Z	Zaca12		in order to use dd, would i need to format the new file system?
2011-01-19T13:56:00.000Z	rumpe1	Zaca12	no... dd copies bit-by-bit...
2011-01-19T13:56:00.000Z	rumpe1	Zaca12	but don't forget to set a high enough bs(blocksize)... otherwise it will last forever ^^
2011-01-19T13:57:00.000Z	Zaca12	rumpe1	how would i set the blocksize?
2011-01-19T13:57:00.000Z	Zaca12		im currently doing something like this:dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/dev/sdb .. but haven't started it yet
2011-01-19T14:14:00.000Z	Zaca12		one last question
2011-01-19T14:14:00.000Z	Zaca12		ive run dd from a drive with a file system to another drive which has no file system
2011-01-19T14:14:00.000Z	Zaca12		is that ok?
2011-01-19T14:15:00.000Z	Zaca12		or should i have formatted the drive to empty status before running dd to give it a file system?
2011-01-19T14:15:00.000Z	rumpe1	Zaca12	yes ... dd copies everything, no matter what...
2011-01-19T14:15:00.000Z	Zaca12		oh thanks a lot! was just making sure
2011-01-19T14:15:00.000Z	rumpe1	Zaca12	formatted partitions are also just bits on the disk... they will be overwritten by dd
2011-01-19T14:16:00.000Z	Zaca12		im running dd with a blocksize of 32768k and the drives are both 1.5TB each, how long could we guess this should usually take?
2011-01-19T14:16:00.000Z	rumpe1	Zaca12	hmm... one hour? two? ... depends, how fast the connection is
