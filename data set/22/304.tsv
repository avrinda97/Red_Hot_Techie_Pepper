2012-01-11T15:32:00.000Z	r4vn		Hello. I downloaded my printer driver. and trying press on install.sh but nothing happens
2012-01-11T15:33:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	most printer drivers are already included with Ubuntu, are you sure you need to install a blob like that in the first place? what printer is it?
2012-01-11T15:33:00.000Z	r4vn		scx-3205w
2012-01-11T15:34:00.000Z	r4vn		yea.. couse when i pluged in it shows that cant find drivers.. and it even doesnt work for me ;?
2012-01-11T15:35:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	ugh, that particular printer does seem like a nightmare to install. anyway start install.sh from the terminal, not from the desktop.
2012-01-11T15:37:00.000Z	r4vn	LjL	it shows error: root privilegies requared, something like this
2012-01-11T15:37:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	then start it with "sudo"
2012-01-11T15:37:00.000Z	r4vn	LjL	what is sudo?
2012-01-11T15:37:00.000Z	r4vn		program?
2012-01-11T15:37:00.000Z	LjL		!sudo | r4vn
2012-01-11T15:38:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	"sudo install.sh" will let you execute it as root.
2012-01-11T15:45:00.000Z	r4vn	LjL	sry, but i dont know how to use sudo :/
2012-01-11T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	err, i just told you, just type "sudo install.sh"
2012-01-11T15:45:00.000Z	r4vn	LjL	where to type?
2012-01-11T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	in the terminal.
2012-01-11T15:46:00.000Z	r4vn		it shows: sudo: install.sh: command not found
2012-01-11T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	you need to go to the directory where you downloaded install.sh first.
2012-01-11T15:47:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	anyway this is going to be very complicated i suspect, just installing that won't work according to the forums i'm reading.
2012-01-11T15:48:00.000Z	r4vn		so what should i do? LjL, maybe ill try to install first
2012-01-11T15:48:00.000Z	r4vn		how to go to that directory?
2012-01-11T15:49:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	"cd ~/Downloads" or whatever the relevant directory is
2012-01-11T15:49:00.000Z	LjL	r4vn	but as quiescens says, you'll need to type something like "sudo bash install.sh" instead, my bad
