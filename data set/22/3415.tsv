2011-12-03T18:14:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	Yes, why not?
2011-12-03T18:15:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	it will wear out the drive faster, you should probably use ext2
2011-12-03T18:16:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	Wear out... There were 24/7 tests with 3y duration not able to actually wear it out...
2012-04-07T22:34:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	no it's not...
2012-04-07T22:35:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	by default on ubuntu, members of the admin group have sudo privileges
2012-04-07T22:35:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	ack
2012-04-24T20:23:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	Reboot into another kernel, and remove it the same way you installed it (hopefully dpkg).
2012-09-15T14:37:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	You cant use su at all on Ubuntu be default, since by default, there is no root pw set.
2012-09-15T14:37:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	yes...
2012-09-15T14:38:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	jhker has messed up the ownership of his /etc/sudoers so he can no longer use sudo
2012-09-22T04:18:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	zivester: No.
2012-09-22T04:19:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	eh?
2012-09-22T04:19:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	that would only affect the new terminal
2012-09-22T04:20:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	An no existing terminal - and why not just continueing in the new terminal?
2012-09-22T04:21:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	this is a possibility sure.  Depends on what he wants to do.  For example, he may need the PATH to be changed in his gui environment or he may need to open many new terminals and does not want to have to keep sourcing ~/.profile :)
2012-09-22T04:48:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	After sourcing, you dont need to execute the .profile, since it isnt even executable by default.
2012-09-25T22:47:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	haha, wow
2012-09-29T02:53:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	there is a way, but it's not as convenient (ctrl-z, bg, disown)
2012-10-05T20:14:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	You're facing people mixing up VIRT, RES and SHR :)
2012-10-06T23:06:00.000Z	jrib	bekks	stop stealing ubottu's thunder!
2012-10-06T23:06:00.000Z	bekks	jrib	I am selling it to newbies. Without ads, I am making money of them ;)
