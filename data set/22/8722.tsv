2005-08-25T11:33:00.000Z	glick		i dont get what thats about
2005-08-25T11:33:00.000Z	glick		linus asking for license fees to use the linux name?
2005-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	yeah, I found that weird also
2006-03-20T16:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	what is wrong with the output you see for 'w' ?
2006-03-20T16:03:00.000Z	glick	Xenguy	my friend is currently logged in via ssh and i do not see him
2006-03-20T16:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	w and who should show all users :-/
2006-03-20T16:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	if it were me, I would run 'chkrootkit' and 'rkhunter' just to be on the safe side
2006-03-20T16:09:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	no, chkrootkit
2006-03-20T16:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	2 programs that scan your system for security breaches (it's just a precaution, don't panic yet :-)
2006-03-20T16:11:00.000Z	glick	Xenguy	is it hard to use chkrootkit?
2006-03-20T16:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	no, very straightforward
2006-03-20T16:12:00.000Z	glick	Xenguy	just runn it?
2006-03-20T16:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	just: sudo chkrootkit |less
2006-03-20T16:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	I also recommend 'rkhunter' e.g.:  sudo rkhunter -c
2006-03-20T16:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	you will return to a prompt
2006-03-20T16:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	press spacebar to page down
2006-03-20T16:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	you will need 'universe' and/or 'multiverse' enabled for that one perhaps
2006-03-20T16:17:00.000Z	glick	Xenguy	i do have them both enabled
2006-03-20T16:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	yer right - I don't see rkhunter now either
2006-03-20T16:19:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	I believe it was in the archives at one point (I have it on my system)
2006-03-20T16:19:00.000Z	Xenguy	glick	is this breezy BTW?
