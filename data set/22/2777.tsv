2009-03-23T00:22:00.000Z	neeteex		I there, any one that can help me to find out why my CPU is at 100% under with firefox + monitor ?
2009-03-23T00:24:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	There is a bug in monitor, it reads cpu usage, like, 100 times a second, instead of 5 times a second.
2009-03-23T00:24:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Use htop instead, or set it to read much less often
2009-03-23T00:25:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	this might not be the only problem for me : same thing with htop :(
2009-03-23T00:25:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	and the words I write here appera with 1 or 2 seconds of delay while typing !
2009-03-23T00:26:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Hmm, are you running anything particularly CPU/memory intensive in firefox? I know that there is a memory leak in flash (I once had flash using over 2G of memory, just because I left it running for several hours)
2009-03-23T00:28:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	I don't realy know, but i could cope without flash for a start. How to cut that ?
2009-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Well, if you aren't running a flash app, that probably isn't your problem.
2009-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Does firefox tend to freeze up?
2009-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Like, go a darkened often?
2009-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	yes it does freeze, but not only firefox : it might be more general
2009-03-23T00:33:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	not realy darkened, only taking a while to react to commands (click, keyboard...)
2009-03-23T00:34:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Does htop/whatever report that firefox is using 100/99/etc CPU, or does it just report maxed cpu usage?
2009-03-23T00:35:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	it says cpu goes from 1 to 90%, so it often overcome with other apps
2009-03-23T00:35:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	96% on last peak !
2009-03-23T00:36:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Ok, next time firefox peaks in its usage, run strace -pXXX > straceout.log (Replace XXX with the pid of firefox)
2009-03-23T00:37:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	Then, look around in that log file to see if anything obvious is happening.
2009-03-23T00:37:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	One other thing: Do you have beagle installed?
2009-03-23T00:38:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	I don't know, never heard of beagle
2009-03-23T00:39:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	try sudo apt-get remove beagle  Beagle often caused problems with high CPU usage for me\
2009-03-23T00:39:00.000Z	mbrigdan	neeteex	I have to leave now, but keep asking around, the community is very helpful
2009-03-23T00:53:00.000Z	neeteex	mbrigdan	sorry for disconnection : my pc crushed while under strace command (did'nt find how to stop it !)
