2008-03-19T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	you can't upgrade straight from edgy to gutsy.  You need to upgrade to feisty first.
2008-03-19T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	We're willing to take a look at it.  Pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-03-19T06:05:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	Pastebin (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2008-03-19T06:07:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	Now you need to give us the URL that you get after you submit
2008-03-19T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	Have you actually used automatix?
2008-03-19T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	alright, well, before upgrading, it's recommended that you backup your data, since automatix has been known to cause problems while upgrading.  There's no guarentee that it will, but its a possibility.
2008-03-19T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	as for the list, it all looks in order as far as the ubuntu repos are concerned.
2008-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	Which servers is it saying it can't connect to?  It should give you a URL, I just need a few.
2008-03-19T06:17:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	alright, its the third party wine repo that is failing.  You should, if you plan on using third party wine in the future, use the winehq repo.  Here's a new sources.list you can use: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/60116/
2008-03-19T06:23:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	Do you have a GUI on the machine?
2008-03-19T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	alt-f2, then gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-03-19T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	What did you do to get out of it?
2008-03-19T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	ctrl-alt-f7 will get you back, if you ctrl-alt-f[1-6] to get out of it.
2008-03-19T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	no, alt-f2 just opens up a run window.
2008-03-19T06:26:00.000Z	Flannel	carol	ctrl-alt-f2 takes you to a full screen terminal, and to get back, ctrl-alt-f7
