2007-01-24T13:25:00.000Z	Marupa		just a small question of mine, goodgerster.
2007-01-24T13:25:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	go on
2007-01-24T13:26:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	does amarok give a specific error, for instance in the terminal?
2007-01-24T13:27:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	well, what happens when it's run?
2007-01-24T13:28:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	that's an error. what version of ubuntu are you on?
2007-01-24T13:31:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	good point. have you tried reinstalling amarok, googling with the error, checking that you've got all the dependencies correctly installed, checking that you've not used Automatix or similar?
2007-01-24T13:31:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	has anything changed since then?
2007-01-24T13:32:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	has the problem persisted across sessions and reboots?
2007-01-24T13:33:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	goodo
2007-01-24T13:51:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	apache2
2007-01-24T13:56:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	sudo apt-get install apache2
2007-01-24T13:57:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	well, to set it up you type "sudo apt-get install apache2" and then close the window...
2007-01-24T13:57:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	after that, put your files in /var/www
2007-01-24T13:58:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	well, you don't want anything different for "just sharing a few files"
2007-01-24T13:59:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	indeed, most people don't want anything different for "just hosting a fortune 500 website"
2007-01-24T13:59:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	why would the developers ship an insecure default configuration?
2007-01-24T14:00:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	why, indeed, would they make it possible to make it insecure by means of non-default configuration?
2007-01-24T14:00:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	this is not windows, one is not expected to spend eight hours making the software fit for purpose
2007-01-24T14:01:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	fire away
2007-01-24T14:02:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	yeah, there's a rhythmbox extension for ahavi which does all that
2007-01-24T14:03:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	oh, I see. you want to broadcast online? I'm not aware that ubuntu can do that, but you can certainly google it. shoutcast is good on windows
2007-01-24T14:04:00.000Z	goodgerster	Marupa	ahavi is built in. you just need to enable it in rhythmbox
