2009-01-16T06:17:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	you mean you are missing a file ?
2009-01-16T06:17:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	yeah i am trying to install slapd,adnd there is no slapd.conf in /etc/ldap :(
2009-01-16T06:19:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	yeah i am trying to install slapd,adnd there is no slapd.conf in /etc/ldap :(
2009-01-16T06:20:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	I'm confused I was thinking of slapd.args for the conf
2009-01-16T06:21:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	the slapd.conf i in /etc/ldap
2009-01-16T06:21:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	yeah,but its not their after doing an apt-get install slapd
2009-01-16T06:22:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	I think it is coming from openldap
2009-01-16T06:23:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	don't you have one in /etc/openldap/ ?
2009-01-16T06:23:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	/etc/openldap/slapd.conf.default
2009-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	let em check ,i beleive it is in /etc/ldap
2009-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	nothing like that
2009-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	you don't use openldap ?
2009-01-16T06:24:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	its same ,its known as slapd
2009-01-16T06:25:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	what I mean is that slapd.conf is coming with the installation of openldap as sldap.conf.default
2009-01-16T06:26:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	yeah but its not in .y /etc/ldap
2009-01-16T06:26:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	have you installed the clients ?
2009-01-16T06:27:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	because 'm pretty sure if you install the openldap-servers you have a sldap.conf
2009-01-16T06:27:00.000Z	lonel	jp_sf	oh is it
2009-01-16T06:28:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	well you know this kind of things you do once and after you keep using it
2009-01-16T06:28:00.000Z	jp_sf	lonel	I'm pretty sure yes
