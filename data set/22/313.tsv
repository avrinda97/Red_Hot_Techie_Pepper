2011-12-31T03:49:00.000Z	nythrow		Hello guys. Could anyone advise me; what DE should I install for a person who has no idea about Linux?
2011-12-31T03:49:00.000Z	Kiten	nythrow	uhh why not use ubuntu's default gnome ?
2011-12-31T03:50:00.000Z	nythrow		But wouldn't GNOME3 too difficult?
2011-12-31T03:50:00.000Z	Kiten	nythrow	no
2011-12-31T03:50:00.000Z	Kiten	nythrow	gnome3 should be very very easy to navigate
2011-12-31T03:51:00.000Z	nythrow		I will try gnome3.
2011-12-31T03:51:00.000Z	Kiten	nythrow	what are you needing ? are you wanting to make applications ?
2011-12-31T03:52:00.000Z	nythrow	Kiten	I mean. It is a person who needs printing, browsing web etc. No special prefers.
2011-12-31T03:52:00.000Z	Kiten		gnome3
2011-12-31T03:53:00.000Z	Kiten		if they are coming from windows KDE would be pretty similar to it
2011-12-31T03:53:00.000Z	Kiten	nythrow	kubuntu uses kde its pretty similar visually to windows, but if they are ok with something new gnome3 is pretty easy to navigate
2011-12-31T03:54:00.000Z	Kiten	nythrow	i feel obligated to tell you that you can install other DE's without having to reinstall ubuntu
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	nythrow	Kiten	KDE4 is too heavy.
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	Kiten		so you need a lightweight DE/wm
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	Kiten		?
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	nythrow	Kiten	I'm not Ubuntu user, c'mon. I'm arch user.
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	Kiten		oh then
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	Kiten		eff gnome3
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	nythrow		But I don't know what's easy too new Linux users. :P
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	Kiten		oh nvm then
2011-12-31T03:55:00.000Z	nythrow		*to;
2011-12-31T03:56:00.000Z	Kiten	nythrow	xfce is lightweight and similar to gnome
