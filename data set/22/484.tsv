2011-10-19T06:47:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	Did you set up a recovery key in the window that popped up when you first booted?
2011-10-19T06:48:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	I am not sure , bro
2011-10-19T06:48:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	I thought I didn't
2011-10-19T06:50:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	Wouldn't be very secure if you could decrypt without knowing any of the authentication details, no?
2011-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	the thing is I wanna get it back. That is my personal laptop. I need to use it
2011-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	Did you keep a backup? If you encrypted your home, forgot the passwords and did not set a recovery, it is stuck encrypted
2011-10-19T07:11:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	so what do I do ?
2011-10-19T07:12:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	 using boot live CD, can i do something ?
2011-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	You may be able to log in to the account using the steps at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword
2011-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	 What I am so disappointed, whenever I changed password for account with encrypted home folder, why would that happen ?
2011-10-19T07:16:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	Do you know the password for the account?
2011-10-19T07:16:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	yes.
2011-10-19T07:20:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	So you change the login password, but it did not update the encrypted passphrase so your home will not unlock?
2011-10-19T07:23:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	bro, I am still not successfully logged inside.
2011-10-19T07:24:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	 as I have only one account
2011-10-19T07:26:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	How did you change the password, was it on the command line with passwd or in the gui?
2011-10-19T07:26:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	it was changed using command line , passwd username
2011-10-19T07:27:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	That is the cause of your trouble, passwd does not update the encryption passphrase (the gui does)
2011-10-19T07:27:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	if you know the old password, if you change the used password back to that it should work, or you could update the encryption passphrase but you must know the old password
2011-10-19T07:38:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	As I still cant login, how can I change pwd ?
2011-10-19T07:41:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	linocisco	I sent you a link to the LostPassword link. Login as root, change the user's password back to the old one with passwd, and it should unlock the drive when you login
2011-10-19T07:42:00.000Z	linocisco	Stupendoussteve	ok I will try bro
