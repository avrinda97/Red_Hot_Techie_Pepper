2009-07-09T20:34:00.000Z	SnowRaptor	stratocaster	ster you created the server using vncserver, connect to it using vncviewer <yout ip address>:1
2009-07-09T20:25:00.000Z	SnowRaptor	stratocaster	you must styart the server on your machine via the vncserver command

2009-07-09T20:28:00.000Z	SnowRaptor	stratocaster	thhe steps are: install x11vnc or tightvnc-server or whatever; then you msut set your router (if any) to forward the port correctly; then you msut set a password using the command "vncpasswd"; then start the server via "vncserver".
2009-07-09T20:28:00.000Z	SnowRaptor	stratocaster	"vncserver" will return a display number, probably ":1"
2009-07-09T20:29:00.000Z	SnowRaptor	stratocaster	your party must then connect to your.ip.add.ress:1, for examplo
