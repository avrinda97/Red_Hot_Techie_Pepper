2007-03-24T12:35:00.000Z	thezenmaster		can anyone give me a hand with fakeraid? it's getting on my nerves....
2007-03-24T12:35:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	fakeraid is a waste of time in linux
2007-03-24T12:35:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	so i have read, but i can't erase my WinXp partition now
2007-03-24T12:36:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	its just not worth the effort
2007-03-24T12:37:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	what do you recommend then? i need a WinXp instalation
2007-03-24T12:37:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	buy a new hard disk for ubuntu
2007-03-24T12:50:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	is there a way of dual-booting two SATA hd's?
2007-03-24T12:51:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	you mean the raided drives ?
2007-03-24T12:51:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	i have a RAID0 and a separate SATA HD where all my downloads music and stuff go, I can make a partition for ubuntu there
2007-03-24T12:51:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	sounds a good call
2007-03-24T12:52:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	i only found guides for SATA+IDE, is the process for SATA+SATA(RAID) the same=
2007-03-24T12:52:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	just treat the raid as a sata disk
2007-03-24T12:57:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	i was told it boosted (a bit) perfomance, so i did it lol it's just that.. if it is possible to unRAID the disks without losing data i don't see any problem with doing it and then i would have one HD for Win, one for Ubuntu and another for trash (maybe a NTFS and a EXT3 partition or something)
2007-03-24T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	you can do it but its easier to do under windows
2007-03-24T12:57:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	im on windows right now
2007-03-24T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	there are some guys in #windows who can help you do that
2007-03-24T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	it can be done though
2007-03-24T12:58:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	do you think the windows people are frinedly enough to help? lol
2007-03-24T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	most of them, some have helped me out a lot i the past
2007-03-24T13:05:00.000Z	thezenmaster	ikonia	it seems the only way to do it is through a process of Backup, unraid, re-install and resotre
2007-03-24T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	I thought there was another trick to do it
2007-03-24T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	thezenmaster	still thought there was another way
