2011-04-12T05:29:00.000Z	bassgoon		so I have some linux/unix experience, I want to boot off the ubuntu disc and reformat a multi-part sd card that my android phone ate and it can't be seen by the phone or in windows. What tool could help me?
2011-04-12T05:30:00.000Z	Ben64	bassgoon	you might be able to repair it. what do you mean "multi-part sd card"?
2011-04-12T05:30:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	it has an ext3, swap and fat32 partition
2011-04-12T05:31:00.000Z	Ben64	bassgoon	and just the fat32 is messing up?
2011-04-12T05:31:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	no, the phone can't see any of it
2011-04-12T05:31:00.000Z	Ben64		could the phone normally see ext3?
2011-04-12T05:32:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	yes, it could see all the partitions
2011-04-12T05:32:00.000Z	Ben64	bassgoon	well you can probably fix it with fsck
2011-04-12T05:32:00.000Z	bassgoon		hmm
2011-04-12T05:33:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	i'm fine with repartitioning it
2011-04-12T05:33:00.000Z	Ben64	bassgoon	but now i'm interested... whats the advantage of ext3 and swap on a sd card in a droid? my sd is fat32
2011-04-12T05:34:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	well I'm too in to fiddling, but I have it set up using a tool to run apps from the ext3 partition off the sdcard
2011-04-12T05:34:00.000Z	bassgoon		since i have a large/fast sd card
2011-04-12T05:34:00.000Z	Ben64	bassgoon	nice.. well you can use parted or gparted to repartition in ubuntu, but all info would be lost
2011-04-12T05:34:00.000Z	bassgoon		I'm assuming all is lot anyway
2011-04-12T05:35:00.000Z	Ben64	bassgoon	its likely just a little error and totally recoverable
2011-04-12T05:36:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	well I do have access to fsck on the phone
2011-04-12T05:36:00.000Z	bassgoon		i just can't figure out the device name
2011-04-12T05:37:00.000Z	Ben64	bassgoon	/dev/block/mmcblk0p[0-2]
2011-04-12T05:37:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	hmm
2011-04-12T05:41:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	wanna help my on the syntax?
2011-04-12T05:42:00.000Z	bassgoon	Ben64	maybe it doesn't..haha
