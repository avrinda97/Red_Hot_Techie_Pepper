2011-12-23T01:52:00.000Z	newubuntuuser		System-Administration-Hardware drivers won't offer me a proprietary nvidia driver to be installed like https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia says, what should I do?

2011-12-23T01:55:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	do you want to say I might need to add a third party repo for proprietary driver to become available?
2011-12-23T02:01:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	universe and multiverse repos seem to be enabled by default in vanilla /etc/apt/sources.list, I have no idea what to add to that file. Searching for "repo" on wiki page about proprietary nvidia driver returns no matches
2011-12-23T02:02:00.000Z	TiMiDo	newubuntuuser	paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to paste.ubuntu.com
2011-12-23T02:04:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	http://paste.ubuntu.com/779110/
2011-12-23T02:04:00.000Z	TiMiDo	newubuntuuser	lol remove line 1 to 3
2011-12-23T02:05:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	I don't understand, but line 1-3 are commented
2011-12-23T02:06:00.000Z	TiMiDo	newubuntuuser	is your ubuntu cdrom is inside your laptop or computer?
2011-12-23T02:07:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	this is a new computer, they put an ubuntu into it so it's not empty. computer has no cd drive at all
2011-12-23T02:09:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	did that, ran apt-get update, do I need a restart again before trying system-administration-hardware drivers?
2011-12-23T02:10:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	still nothing, hardware drivers window is empty
2011-12-23T02:13:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	just lspci or you want it with those verbose arguments? video card is geforce gt 430 btw

2011-12-23T02:15:00.000Z	TiMiDo	newubuntuuser	sudo apt-get install nvidia-xconfig and then sudo nvidia-xconfig and you are good
2011-12-23T02:17:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	first one tells me it can't find such a package to install
2011-12-23T02:18:00.000Z	TiMiDo	newubuntuuser	i just give you the answer
2011-12-23T02:19:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	by "first one" I meant I did "sudo apt-get install nvidia-xconfig" and it said couldn't find package nvidia-xconfig
2011-12-23T02:22:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	installed nvidia-settings
2011-12-23T02:24:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	what filename to use when saving? /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
2011-12-23T02:25:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	i did not install the nvidia driver, sudo modprobe nvidia fails
2011-12-23T02:30:00.000Z	newubuntuuser	TiMiDo	I am confused. that hardware drivers window is supposed to tell me what driver to install, yet it remains empty. probably i can do it manually using apt-get install, but i don't know the package name for the driver for my video card
