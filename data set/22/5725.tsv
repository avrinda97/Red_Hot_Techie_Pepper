2007-03-12T07:36:00.000Z	cimenta		any one could help me with setting up my mic?
2007-03-12T07:37:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	you can adjust levels in alsamixer or the little speaker by the clock.
2007-03-12T07:40:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	I adjusted it to max but it's still not enough
2007-03-12T07:41:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	isn' there a boost in alsamixer
2007-03-12T07:42:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	yeah there is a micboost in alsamixer
2007-03-12T07:42:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	or if you double click on the speaker by the clock.
2007-03-12T07:43:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	and then?
2007-03-12T07:43:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	then you can click edit > preferences and check box the mic boost 20 DB box to have it show in the normal properties
2007-03-12T07:44:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	I can't find anything like "check box the mic boost 20 DB box"
2007-03-12T07:45:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	well it says Mic Boost 20db  and there is a little box next to it?  Click the little box to check it
2007-03-12T07:45:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	that is under preference for the volume-manager

2007-03-12T07:47:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	double click on speak icon opens Volume Control window. I just  can't find any boost box in thre
2007-03-12T07:48:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	then click on edit and preferences in the volume control window
2007-03-12T07:49:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	how can I send you my screenshot?
2007-03-12T07:50:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	did you click on edit then preferences?
2007-03-12T07:50:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	yes
2007-03-12T07:52:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	http://www.kxuk.net/bucket/show_comp.php?id=c24302041&name=Screenshot.png
2007-03-12T07:53:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	hrm... close that and open run alsamixer in a terminal.  You can move the right or left with the arrows and adjust the levels with up or down.  To exit hit esc.  Go to the right in there and look for mic boost.
2007-03-12T07:59:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	nothing like mic boost in there. I tried external mic and it
2007-03-12T08:00:00.000Z	cimenta	h1st0	and it's better but still not great
2007-03-12T08:02:00.000Z	h1st0	cimenta	hrm... maybe a post on the forums http://www.ubuntuforums.org with your problem and your sound card model would help?  Did you try following the instructions from ubotu for sound problems?
