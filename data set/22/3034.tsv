2008-12-29T03:57:00.000Z	Glenshope		Question...  I seem to have some form of connection problem, for instance it takes firefox 10 seconds to look up www.google.com not load the page the actual time it takes to look up the page
2008-12-29T03:58:00.000Z	Glenshope		And when I ping a website using the network assist it locks up intermittently
2008-12-29T03:58:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	how long does it take when you use nslookup www.google.com ?
2008-12-29T03:59:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	 what nameserver are you using?
2008-12-29T04:00:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	paste /etc/resolve.conf
2008-12-29T04:03:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	perhaps you could enter the *put your provider here* nameserver for lookup
2008-12-29T04:04:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	or simple wait
2008-12-29T04:04:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	restart your router could be a solution
2008-12-29T04:23:00.000Z	Glenshope	arj1	Nope didn't help
2008-12-29T04:29:00.000Z	Glenshope	arj1	I'm back after resetting the router still having the same problem and confirmed it is a problem with the network or internet because firefox responded very quickly when accessing the pages for my router settings
2008-12-29T04:30:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	so welcome back. so you could enter a temporary faster nameserver in resolv.conf
2008-12-29T04:31:00.000Z	Glenshope	arj1	 if I wanted to do that I would need to reset my modem, but I'm pretty sure that isn't the problem
2008-12-29T04:31:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	whY that?
2008-12-29T04:32:00.000Z	Glenshope	arj1	 I just checked, my sister who is running an older version of Ubuntu doesn't have this problem
2008-12-29T04:33:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	mmh, strange
2008-12-29T04:33:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	sorry, i cannot help you any further. perhaps others are more familiar with that ;)
2008-12-29T04:36:00.000Z	Glenshope	arj1	 what do you mean?
2008-12-29T04:36:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	have a look at /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-12-29T04:36:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	are you familiar with that?
2008-12-29T04:37:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	pastebin?
2008-12-29T04:38:00.000Z	Glenshope	arj1	 pastebin?
2008-12-29T04:38:00.000Z	arj1	Glenshope	sorry ;) can you simple copy/paste the contents of menu.lst?
