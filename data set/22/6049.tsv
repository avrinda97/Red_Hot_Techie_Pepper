2007-02-21T16:33:00.000Z	burepe		I am looking for a command to unzip a bunch of tar.gz files in one directory in one shot.  Lill' help?
2007-02-21T16:35:00.000Z	burepe		sorry. Can'T follow last 2 parts
2007-02-21T16:35:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	What do you mean?
2007-02-21T16:36:00.000Z	burepe		what is this? for i in *.tar.gz; do tar zxf "$i"; done
2007-02-21T16:37:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	'for i in *.tar.gz; do .... ; done' is a look that takes every file that matches *.tar.gz and puts it in the variable "$i" one by one to 'do' something with it.  the command in the middle is the unzip command for .tar.gz files
2007-02-21T16:39:00.000Z	burepe	Ferret	I am sorry but I do not follow how to execute any of those commands. I am cd to the directory already.
2007-02-21T16:40:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	Oh I see, you want to do it using the graphical thingy; have to find someone else to help you with that then
2007-02-21T16:40:00.000Z	burepe		no
2007-02-21T16:41:00.000Z	burepe		I want to do it in the command line but I enterd the commands and get nothing
2007-02-21T16:41:00.000Z	burepe		I am missing something
2007-02-21T16:41:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	Do you mean they printed nothing, or that no files have appeared?
2007-02-21T16:42:00.000Z	burepe		no return , no output
2007-02-21T16:42:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	Well, no output means it was successful. o.o
2007-02-21T16:43:00.000Z	burepe	Ferret	where did it unzip to?
2007-02-21T16:43:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	The directory, like you said...
2007-02-21T16:43:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	unzip commands on linux generally extract to the current directory (so you cd to it first)
2007-02-21T16:44:00.000Z	burepe	Ferret	I am in the directory. There are no files from an unzip
2007-02-21T16:45:00.000Z	burepe	Ferret	so I should copy that line and execute it as is?
2007-02-21T16:47:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	Are the .tar.gz files in the same directory?
2007-02-21T16:47:00.000Z	burepe		yes
2007-02-21T16:47:00.000Z	burepe		I am in the directory
2007-02-21T16:50:00.000Z	Ferret	burepe	then the 'for ..... done' command should work
