2010-03-21T08:31:00.000Z	RUXA		Does anyone have experience with setup CDMA mobile phone and internet in ubuntu 9.10?
2010-03-21T08:32:00.000Z	dominickpastore	RUXA	i have done this with my own phone, but my experience is that it can involve quite a bit of research, depending on your phone.
2010-03-21T08:34:00.000Z	dominickpastore	RUXA	some phones are supported by default if you plug it in and just look in the NetworkManager Applet's menu. others, like mine, take a little more work. i had to install an extra piece of software on my phone, for example.
