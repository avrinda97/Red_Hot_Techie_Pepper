2007-10-06T13:20:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	according to that page, it does NOT work under 7.04. :(
2007-10-06T13:20:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	research still in progress
2007-10-06T13:21:00.000Z	DenysLins	javaJake	Ok man
2007-10-06T13:24:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	I recommend you report this as a bug, however, before giving up on 7.04. It just looks like this card doesn't have a lot of attention, but a call to the Ubuntu developers may help you out
2007-10-06T13:24:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	No
2007-10-06T13:25:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	if you do create a bug report, let me know! I'll want to track its progress as well
2007-10-06T13:27:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	very interesting....
2007-10-06T13:28:00.000Z	DenysLins	javaJake	 it's link
2007-10-06T13:28:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	hmmm, yep. Soudns like a driver issue
2007-10-06T13:28:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	I still say you need to report it as a bug.
2007-10-06T13:30:00.000Z	javaJake	DenysLins	right, I saw that online
