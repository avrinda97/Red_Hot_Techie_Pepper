2010-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	UnknownException		hey everyone. does any1 play warcraft on Garena client?
2010-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	Viking667	UnknownException	hm? never played it. I'm assuming you mean WoW?
2010-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	yes i mean wow. basically this is for playing Dota and not Wow. but still using Frozen Throne
2010-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 using a client called GArena which connects gamers.
2010-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	Viking667		Given I don't know what "Dota" means, I'm assuming it's a mod for Wow:Frozen Throne
2010-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 Dota is just a map
2010-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	Viking667		ahh.
2010-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 but it has become so popular now.
2010-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	Viking667		heh. The good maps do that.
2010-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	Viking667		The only thing that holds me away from WoW is the subscription... and as that's not going away any time soon (and I suppose, neither should it) I won't ever be seen on the shards
2010-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	hehe. yeah. so my problem is, i got this program called Play on linux, that helped me Run the WIndows garena.exe using Wine. But through Garena i am having problem starting war3.exe. I can start war3.exe from the terminal using Wine.
2010-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 i never started on Wow. and dont plan to. Its too much.
2010-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	Viking667		Does Garena act as a server chooser for Wow?
2010-09-19T05:53:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 yes for all games now. CS to Wow. But just acts as a lan emulator. Not wow. But maps that u can play on local area
2010-09-19T05:53:00.000Z	Viking667		ah, okay.
2010-09-19T05:53:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 it has support for a lot of games and millions of users now
2010-09-19T05:53:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 millions might be an exaggeration.
2010-09-19T05:54:00.000Z	Viking667		heh. Given WoW has millions of users, at least some of those may well be using the Galena client.
2010-09-19T05:54:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 They are. but mostly use Windows.
2010-09-19T05:55:00.000Z	UnknownException		Viking I have it working using Wine and Play On lInux. But stuck at the last step, Just need Garena now to be able to run War3.exe
2010-09-19T05:56:00.000Z	Viking667		Ah, sorry. Garena (galena is a chemical in the periodic table, I think... used to dope transistors with)
2010-09-19T05:56:00.000Z	UnknownException	Viking667	 hahahaha.. I dont think Galena is an element. But will take your word for it.
