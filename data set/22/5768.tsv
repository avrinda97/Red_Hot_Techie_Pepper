2008-09-20T20:04:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	why?
2008-09-20T20:05:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	have you read and completed the tasks detailed in http://reconstructor.aperantis.com/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Docs/Using_Reconstructor ?
2008-09-22T01:52:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	view -> show hidden
2008-10-12T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	use alt-f2 to run it?
2008-12-12T21:17:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	can you give more details?
2008-12-12T21:19:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	I installed Wubi on this Viista computer. I removed it after there were incompatiabilities. However, I haven't got the disk space it was in back, and I can't find any of it's files. Any ideas?
2008-12-12T21:20:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	try ##windows or ask the wubi forums
2008-12-12T21:20:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	ok
2009-01-11T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	man tune2fs  I don't recall the syntax offhand
2009-01-11T17:26:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	Do I type that in a terminal?
2009-01-11T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	though if your computer is crashing because of fsck, you should find the bug report or file it if it doesn't exist yet.  Yes, it gives you documentation when you type 'man tune2fs'
2009-01-11T17:29:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	I've tried typing in "tune2fs -i 999999" (no quotes and a high enough number to not be reached any time soon) but it's just coming up with the help screen for tune2fs (The one with the syntax for the commands) And not working
2009-01-11T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	how would that command know what partition to apply it to?  Read the documentation more closely
2009-01-11T17:35:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	: How do I find out the name for the partition I'm using? hda1 doesn't work. I'm running Ubuntu on an unpartitioned HDD
2009-01-11T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	type 'mount'
2009-01-11T17:41:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	: It's come up with a list of drives. Which one will it be?
2009-01-11T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	the one you want it to stop checking.  It tells you the mount points
2009-02-03T00:22:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	nautilus ~/.fonts    You may have to create it first.
2009-02-03T00:23:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	tHANK YOU :)
2009-03-28T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	Jampiter	dpkg-reconfigure gdm  should be enough...
2009-03-28T16:00:00.000Z	Jampiter	jrib	Excellent. That worked. Thank you :)
