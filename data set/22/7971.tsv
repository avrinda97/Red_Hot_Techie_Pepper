2006-08-04T08:00:00.000Z	greenwom		I lost my wireless card //// I didn't do a kernel upgrade.  It looks like it still is working (sending packets) driver adm8211 is present (lshw)  My laptop can see the singnal in the same spot but the card stoped working (sencond time it happened, last time I reinstalled_)  what next
2006-08-04T08:01:00.000Z	greenwom		any help??
2006-08-04T08:01:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	so, what did you do to loose your wireless card?
2006-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	greenwom	Plouj	the only thing I think of is install samba
2006-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	greenwom	Plouj	that's the last thing I can think of
2006-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	and it used to work perfectly, before?
2006-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	greenwom	Plouj	yes
2006-08-04T08:04:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	I'm curious, the previous time you lost your wireless card, did it happen after installing samba as well, or something else?
2006-08-04T08:05:00.000Z	greenwom	Plouj	can't say I was putting the card in to replace a crappy prism card and had the same problem driver pleasent but no go (same card worked out of the box on other systems)
2006-08-04T08:06:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	well, I dunno how to help you, but you could search dmesg for errors
2006-08-04T08:07:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	no need to repeat yourself
2006-08-04T08:08:00.000Z	greenwom	Plouj	I'm stuck and desperate man :)
2006-08-04T08:08:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	what kind of troubleshooting have you done so far?
2006-08-04T08:10:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	if the live CD gives you the same problem, try powering down your card+ computer for a minute to let it completely loose it's internal memory state, then try again
2006-08-04T08:10:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	did the live cd work work good at first, before you installed samba?
2006-08-04T08:10:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	then your card must be broken
2006-08-04T08:11:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	if it's a laptop, try completely taking the card out
2006-08-04T08:11:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	answer my last question about the live cd
2006-08-04T08:12:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	yeah, did the wireless card ever work with the live cd?
2006-08-04T08:13:00.000Z	greenwom	Plouj	never had to use it before so it's not a great check
2006-08-04T08:14:00.000Z	Plouj	greenwom	I'm out of ideas
2006-08-04T08:15:00.000Z	greenwom	Plouj	thanks for trying.... I need to get it up.  I'm taking the laptop on a long trip and my wife needs the desktop up and running
