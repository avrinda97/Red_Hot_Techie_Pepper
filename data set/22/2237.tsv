2009-08-15T17:19:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	no

2009-08-15T17:22:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	The keyring password is usually the same as your login password.
2009-08-15T17:22:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	If you cannot remember it, you can delete the keyring.
2009-08-15T17:22:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	but it's not working , i am giving the password , that password to install something with sudo aptitude "
2009-08-15T17:23:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	how can i delete the keyring ?
2009-08-15T17:23:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	Open Accessories -> Passwords and Encryption Keys. Then click the "Passwords" tab. It should list at least one keyring... right-click and delete.
2009-08-15T17:23:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	Then restart Empathy.
2009-08-15T17:24:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	from the password tab , or other encryption... ?
2009-08-15T17:25:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	The program should have four tabs - choose the last one, named "Passwords".
2009-08-15T17:27:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	Did you find and delete the keyring?
2009-08-15T17:27:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	i deleted the key from the password tab
2009-08-15T17:28:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	Now restart Empathy. It should ask for your IM passwords (Yahoo, MSN, others) and store them.
2009-08-15T17:31:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	thank you very much
2009-08-15T17:40:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	how can i stop displaying offline friends in empathy ?
2009-08-15T17:41:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	There should be an option in the menus...I don't have empathy at the moment, so you'll need to find it yourself.
2009-08-15T17:42:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	view offline contact > view but it is unchecked , still the offline friends are in display . should i check this ?
2009-08-15T17:42:00.000Z	grawity	ircfine	Try toggling it... maybe they are online actually :\
2009-08-15T17:43:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	i checked the offline contacts , nothing happens
2009-08-15T17:47:00.000Z	ircfine	grawity	can't login for an yahoo id , network error
