2006-05-27T11:38:00.000Z	cyphase		hmm, no custom requests in ShipIt anymore
2006-05-27T11:39:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	Dapper is too near release
2006-05-27T11:39:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	what do you mean?
2006-05-27T11:39:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	that is my guess.   June 1st Dapper will be released. so there will be NEW CD's
2006-05-27T11:39:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	i know..
2006-05-27T11:40:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	with previous versions you could set a custom number of each cd
2006-05-27T11:40:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	ahh sorry
2006-05-27T11:40:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	not the version :)
2006-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	I hate it.  MS tried that bullsh|t with:  My Documents, My Music, My p0rn, etc...
2006-07-03T08:35:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	you hate it personally, or you'd hate for it to be created at all?
2006-07-03T08:37:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	I hate the force-fed behaviour.  I liked my docs in:  c:/docs/$topic my music was in m:/mp3 and my videos in v:/movies    _I_ want my stuff organized MY way.
2006-07-03T08:37:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	i'm not at all suggesting you be forced to follow that structure
2006-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	if you make it too easy for the sheep, then you are stuck with those patterns.  Make these fcukers learn the OS.
2006-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	huh? make them learn the OS? what's that have to do with anything?
2006-07-03T08:40:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	it was an Option in Windows for My Documents..
2006-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	not central storage for central storage's sake
2006-07-03T08:43:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	what would you like to see happen?  (I am not familiar with Mac so don't refer to them please)
2006-07-03T08:44:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	i'm not either, i just know about that program. but anyway..
2006-07-03T08:45:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	ahh
2006-07-03T08:45:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	that sounds awefully like a KDE kind of thing.
2006-07-03T08:46:00.000Z	Rug	cyphase	having DCOP style command manage everything
2006-07-03T08:48:00.000Z	cyphase	Rug	something like this: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/ubuntu-media-center
