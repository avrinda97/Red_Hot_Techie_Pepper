2011-02-16T04:15:00.000Z	aveny		hi there
2011-02-16T04:15:00.000Z	aveny		If I have a patch and I want to modify it, is it possible manually, and above all is it simple? I don't want to write another patch.. just modify that patch
2011-02-16T04:16:00.000Z	hv	aveny	yes, only if you are careful.
2011-02-16T04:16:00.000Z	hv		(try to apply the modified patch to a clone of the target and see if it is fine)
2011-02-16T04:16:00.000Z	aveny	hv	ok, what's the most common error? because I have modified it but I get errors
2011-02-16T04:17:00.000Z	hv	aveny	be careful about the line numbers showing the begining of a chunk. maybe you deleted one line accidentally.
2011-02-16T04:18:00.000Z	aveny	hv	are you speaking about things like: @@ -1870,19 +1925,21 @@
2011-02-16T04:18:00.000Z	hv	aveny	yes, that shows the line numbers in a chunk. just be careful about things like deleting a line after that. you know what I mean.
2011-02-16T04:19:00.000Z	aveny	hv	yup I know :(
2011-02-16T04:20:00.000Z	aveny	hv	there are lines that starts with + and lines that starts with - and I know what are.. the thing that I don't know is: what are the other lines that have not symbols??
2011-02-16T04:21:00.000Z	hv	aveny	they are a few lines before and after a chunk that build up "the context". those are the ones I warned you not to delete.
2011-02-16T04:22:00.000Z	aveny	hv	ah ok ok
2011-02-16T04:22:00.000Z	aveny	hv	I didn't modify them, I tried this: http://pastebin.com/MYnij0AB but it didn't work
2011-02-16T04:24:00.000Z	hv	aveny	heh! you deleted the other lines. you have to update the line number bits
2011-02-16T04:24:00.000Z	hv		(and the context, too)
2011-02-16T04:24:00.000Z	aveny	hv	no I didn't delete anything! I just commented those lines
2011-02-16T04:25:00.000Z	hv	aveny	sorry, lemme see again
2011-02-16T04:25:00.000Z	aveny	hv	np
2011-02-16T04:28:00.000Z	hv	aveny	you have to correctly modify the line number bits. read about the unified format here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format
2011-02-16T04:28:00.000Z	aveny	hv	ok
2011-02-16T04:29:00.000Z	aveny	hv	one last thing: does my correction make sense? I want to erase those lines but it seems that it is erased using the patch.. or not?
2011-02-16T04:29:00.000Z	hv	aveny	in short, change the last number (number of line additions)
