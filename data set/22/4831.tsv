2009-01-06T10:31:00.000Z	Quagmire		I'm running into a small problem getting the correct codecs installed for my 8.10 install. I have only loaded the two gstreamer plugins that were suggested when I tried to play an mp3, but then again ...I did run all those updates that ubuntu wanted run when I got it up and running, so that is the problem. When I tried to install "Ubuntu restricted extras" it gave me an error that said I had a conflict.
2009-01-06T10:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	how did you install the first codecs and from where
2009-01-06T10:32:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	I tried to play a mp3 and it suggested the 2 gstreamers and I installed them and the mp3 played just fine
2009-01-06T10:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	please paste.ubuntu.com with the command and errors you are getting to install the extras package
2009-01-06T10:34:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	but when I first got ubuntu up it wanted to install a bunch of updates 216 to be precise
2009-01-06T10:34:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	the errors on on another machine, so I will have to type it out by hand
2009-01-06T10:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	could you summarize then
2009-01-06T10:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	then best remove them via synaptic and try again
2009-01-06T10:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	synaptic will give more info
2009-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	I have it open now what?
2009-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	mark ubuntu-restricted-extras for installation and apply
2009-01-06T10:40:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	ah HA
2009-01-06T10:40:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	Thats just WAY too simple BLUSH
2009-01-06T10:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	you fixed it?
2009-01-06T10:41:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	I think I'm well on teh way ...it will take a little bit for everything to finish
2009-01-06T10:45:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	helping others can be a very satisfying feeling. I'm a mod at another irc spot that has nothing to do with Ubuntu, but it is a very good feeling when I know I've helped people, but the thing that always feels good is when someone says Thank You. and so now I'll say Thanks to you!
2009-01-06T10:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	glad you fixed it
2009-01-06T10:49:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	I'm not so sure I'm done just yet ..I tried to open the dvd and it started to play, but hung up on the FBI screen ...I'm assuming that I still need more in the way of codecs?
2009-01-06T10:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Quagmire	libdvdcss2 from medibuntu.org (just the package not the repo)
2009-01-06T10:52:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	Oops I reread that again ...I'll sail over to medibuntu
2009-01-06T10:54:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	my computer appears to have hung ...remember that I have 2 pcs, the one I'm on here and the ubuntu pc
2011-07-15T06:21:00.000Z	Quagmire	bazhang	I'm not sure if I stayed muted after my accidental flood or not, but I'm trying to fix my ICEauthority problem.
