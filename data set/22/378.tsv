2012-11-16T08:18:00.000Z	marun	ansi_	yeah, Most probably your unity is crashed/misconfigured. unity --reset will reset the settings

2012-11-16T08:24:00.000Z	ansi_	marun	no, i cant still logon normally.. the logon screen appears again and again
2012-11-16T08:25:00.000Z	marun	ansi_	Ok, may be you should remove unity and install it again. I am not 100% sure if it works. But if I were you, I will do that. Please make a decision :)
2012-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	ansi_	marun	will that delete data???..
2012-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	marun	ansi_	If you are not sure, please backup your data to safe location from /home/<your username>/Desktop . It shouldn't cause any harm to data. But just in case
2012-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	marun	ansi_	you said, you were able to open folder on your desktop. open the folder and navigate to /usr/bin/ and double click on firefox binary. Thats it
