2004-12-11T15:21:00.000Z	twisted_steel		anyone know which package has the socket library?
2004-12-11T15:22:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	for perl ?
2004-12-11T15:23:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	for C
2004-12-11T15:26:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	there is a libdmsocket-0.32.5-0-dev could it be this one ?
2004-12-11T15:27:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	nope, I need libsock
2004-12-11T15:32:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	you mean the package that provides libsock.h i guess....there seems to be none....
2004-12-11T15:33:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	you can install apt-file and do reverse searches in the packages with it
2004-12-11T15:33:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	i.e. find files you search in packages..... neither libsock.h or libsocket.h can be found....
2004-12-11T15:50:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	I hate to do this to you, but can you do a quick search for 'socket.h'
2004-12-11T15:51:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	heh, linux-kernel-headers: usr/include/linux/socket.h
2004-12-11T15:52:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	blast
2004-12-11T15:52:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	thanks anyway :)
2004-12-11T15:53:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	there is a lot more...but all in subdirs below include/ in which else should it be ?
2004-12-11T15:54:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	it should go in /usr/include
2004-12-11T15:54:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	and needs the library as well :/
2004-12-11T15:55:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	apt-file search usr/include/socket.h returns nothing
2004-12-11T15:56:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	hmm, actually the header seems to be there, perhaps the library has some other name
2005-01-04T11:36:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	you know you are supposed to be dressed in librarys ?
2005-01-04T11:36:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	ohhhh, that's why :)
2005-01-04T14:27:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	depends on your cpu ;)
2005-01-04T14:27:00.000Z	twisted_steel	ogra	that's true, I wouldn't want to try it on a p1
2005-01-04T14:28:00.000Z	ogra	twisted_steel	imagine 486 ;)
