2009-04-29T02:04:00.000Z	noah		windows-key + middle-click + drag used to resize the window for me; now, in jaunty, it does a zoom in thing.... where is that configured?
2009-04-29T02:05:00.000Z	demon012	noah	that is by default alt + middleclick not windows button
2009-04-29T02:05:00.000Z	noah	demon012	ok.. i have it set to windows key though... so... ?
2009-04-29T02:05:00.000Z	demon012	noah	you can set it to windows button by going to system->preferences->windows though
2009-04-29T02:06:00.000Z	noah	demon012	i'm particularly interested in configuring the magnification shortcuts, where can i do that?
2009-04-29T02:06:00.000Z	demon012	noah	you have to install ccsm (long name is compizconfig-settings manager) (gimme a sec will get the exact name of the package for you)
2009-04-29T02:07:00.000Z	noah	demon012	ah!
2009-04-29T02:07:00.000Z	demon012	noah	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-04-29T02:07:00.000Z	demon012		that will do the trick
2009-04-29T02:07:00.000Z	noah	demon012	got it
2009-04-29T02:07:00.000Z	demon012	noah	then if you go into there you should see enhanced zoom desktop
2009-04-29T02:08:00.000Z	demon012		click that and it will have the current shortcuts
2009-04-29T02:08:00.000Z	demon012		or if you don't want the zoom just untick it to disable it
2009-04-29T02:08:00.000Z	demon012		brb
2009-04-29T02:09:00.000Z	demon012		bk
2009-04-29T02:09:00.000Z	noah	demon012	thanks much... looking around this config
2009-04-29T02:10:00.000Z	demon012	noah	np m8
2009-04-29T02:10:00.000Z	demon012	noah	have fun with it you can do some whacky things with compiz (but be careful as compiz is probably the thing most likely to crash X nowadays)
2009-04-29T02:11:00.000Z	noah	demon012	yeah there's a million things here
2009-04-29T02:11:00.000Z	demon012	noah	have a look at some of the animations you can do on window close (I like the one that makes the window catch on fire =) )
2009-04-29T02:11:00.000Z	noah	demon012	i found mine, "zoom box"
2009-04-29T02:12:00.000Z	demon012	noah	aha conflicting shortcut eh?
