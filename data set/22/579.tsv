2012-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	Ben64		its probably due to your lsb-release and what else was changed at the same time
2012-03-22T08:42:00.000Z	Ben64		you'll need to undo whatever happened to change lsb-release or ... reinstall
2012-03-22T08:42:00.000Z	Ben64		ubuntu
2012-03-22T08:43:00.000Z	Ben64		how did you install 1.2
2012-03-22T08:45:00.000Z	Ben64		he also said /etc/lsb-release had info pertaining to linux mint
2012-03-22T08:47:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	I suspect it was the first PPA's fault
2012-03-22T08:47:00.000Z	Ben64	MestreLion	really?
2012-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	can you hibernate?
2012-03-22T10:29:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	being able to shut down without losing the session
2012-03-22T10:30:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	great when you have dozens of windows and files and apps .. and you're about to go out for the weekend
2012-03-22T10:39:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	maybe a kernel upgrade from regular repos... update-manager only starts once a day (or week)
2012-03-22T10:40:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	using update manager is better...
2012-03-22T10:41:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	no, it's an app
2012-03-22T10:44:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	humm, nice...
2012-03-22T10:54:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	i'm curious.. do you have any RESUME-UUID= in your /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume ?
2012-03-22T10:55:00.000Z	Ben64	MestreLion	RESUME=UUID=0c1ad202-ef41-4c32-a4c8-5c149e0b20c0
2012-03-22T11:01:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	does not work like that... RAM usage is fragmented, it need to dump all of it to be safe
2012-03-22T11:28:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	command-what? GUI ftw :P
2012-03-22T11:28:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	bash scripting ftw :P
2012-03-22T11:30:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	scritping commonly used vb actions
2012-03-22T11:31:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	for example, I did some scripts to "trim" the virtual hdds to their actual used space + 10%, since that, as you said and I admit, is a pain to do in command line
2012-03-22T11:32:00.000Z	MestreLion	Ben64	and it *requires* command line
