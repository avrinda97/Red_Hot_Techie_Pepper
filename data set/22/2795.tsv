2009-03-03T13:01:00.000Z	paulSterio		anyone know what l_renderPM_libart is for reportlab?
2009-03-03T13:02:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	do you have gcc installed?
2009-03-03T13:03:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	apt-get install gcc?
2009-03-03T13:03:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2009-03-03T13:04:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	that as well - done - yes
2009-03-03T13:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	pastebin the output again please
2009-03-03T13:05:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	I get the same "gcc" error with my mac as well
2009-03-03T13:05:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	 and I've installed the python-dev kit
2009-03-03T13:07:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	u got any idea how to fix that
2009-03-03T13:07:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	apt-get install libc6-dev
2009-03-03T13:08:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	do apt-get install libc6-dev and let me know after you try again
2009-03-03T13:09:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	 system already has that installed
2009-03-03T13:11:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	cd to the source and tell me if there is a configure file in there
2009-03-03T13:11:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	your output would indicate something "non-standard" is going on
2009-03-03T13:14:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	because easy_install is good for breaking stuff
2009-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	I wasted 2 days trying to break this and all I needed to do was grab it from the repo
2009-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	be happy it works then ;) rejoice and enjoy beer
2009-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	Yea!
2009-03-03T13:20:00.000Z	paulSterio	tyler_d	 ok I know this isn't ubuntu related - but I grabbed the repo from the site for my MAC, but I get this unable to execute gcc error again. Do you know if I need to get xcode for the mac?
2009-03-03T13:20:00.000Z	tyler_d	paulSterio	no idea about the mac... and mind the lang man
