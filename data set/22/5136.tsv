2007-10-02T09:17:00.000Z	sanrag		hi ...can anyone help me ... i am having trouble with scp
2007-10-02T09:18:00.000Z	sanrag		whenever i scp a file to my ubuntu system...it's lost... i mean i can't locate it in my home directory
2007-10-02T09:18:00.000Z	sanrag		what do i do
2007-10-02T09:18:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	what syntax do you use with scp? Please quote literally.
2007-10-02T09:19:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	it goes to your home directory. Places-Home Folder
2007-10-02T09:20:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	I bet it does.
2007-10-02T09:21:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	how are you checking?
2007-10-02T09:25:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	try 'ls -lart $HOME'
2007-10-02T09:31:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	there's nothing to explain. Just use the scp command before, but on the target machine, with localhost as the destination.
2007-10-02T09:32:00.000Z	sanrag	soundray	not working
2007-10-02T09:34:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	okay, try this: create an empty file: 'touch foo'. Now copy that empty file locally with 'scp foo bar'. Now check if bar exists: 'ls -l bar'
2007-10-02T09:35:00.000Z	sanrag	soundray	yes, bar exists
2007-10-02T09:38:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	sec, phone
2007-10-02T09:41:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	now try 'scp foo sanrag@localhost:barbar'. Does barbar exist after that?
2007-10-02T09:44:00.000Z	sanrag	soundray	couldn't find barbar
2007-10-02T09:46:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	did you get a password prompt when you tried that?
2007-10-02T09:49:00.000Z	sanrag	soundray	yes, i git
2007-10-02T09:52:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	does 'ssh sanrag@localhost' give you a bash prompt?
2007-10-02T09:54:00.000Z	sanrag	soundray	yes it does, not only from localhost but also from other ips
2007-10-02T09:55:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	try the original scp command with the -v option. It should tell you more about what it does then.
2007-10-02T09:57:00.000Z	sanrag	soundray	have to go ...can i contact u after half an hour
2007-10-02T09:57:00.000Z	soundray	sanrag	no, sorry
