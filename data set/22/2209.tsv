2009-08-21T22:07:00.000Z	dos|equis		but, my question is, can I remove files that are not being used
2009-08-21T22:08:00.000Z	di||itante	dos|equis	like what?
2009-08-21T22:08:00.000Z	dos|equis		I don't know what are these files

2009-08-21T22:09:00.000Z	dos|equis	di||itante	: what sample?
2009-08-21T22:09:00.000Z	di||itante	dos|equis	of a file you want to delete
2009-08-21T22:10:00.000Z	dos|equis	di||itante	: That's my problem. I don't know which file(s) to delete.
2009-08-21T22:10:00.000Z	di||itante	dos|equis	then do them all and see what happens
2009-08-21T22:10:00.000Z	dos|equis	di||itante	: I really want to learn linux. This will be my strength if ever I graduate in college.
