2005-10-27T07:45:00.000Z	rixth		"configure: error: you need the GStreamer or the xine-lib development packages installed" <<< I have libxine-dev though? Any ideas?
2005-10-27T07:45:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	what are you trying to compile?
2005-10-27T07:46:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	totem 1.2.0 using the sources from Gnome
2005-10-27T07:46:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	get all dependencies by doing apt-get build-dep totem
2005-10-27T07:47:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	maybe, even totem-xine :)
2005-10-27T07:47:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	The only reason I'm not using the package is because I want TV out :)
2005-10-31T10:08:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	isn't it in the repos?
2005-10-31T10:08:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	version 38 is, but I need 39 to play online.
2005-10-31T10:09:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	if u still want to compile it, apt-get build-dep scorched3d
2005-10-31T10:09:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	the source is not available.
2005-10-31T10:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	that just builds the dependencies
2005-10-31T10:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	for building
2005-10-31T10:10:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	I'm aware of that. E: Unable to find a source package for scorched3d
2005-10-31T10:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	gimme a sec
2005-10-31T10:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3630
2005-10-31T10:14:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	thanks!
2005-10-31T10:15:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	nope, still get the error.
2005-10-31T10:17:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	do you have that openal thing installed?
2005-10-31T10:17:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	openal0 & openal-dev yes.
2005-10-31T10:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	then either file a bug report on the openal package, with this error message. meanwhile, you might want to try compiling the openal package yourself
2005-10-31T10:20:00.000Z	rixth	robotgeek	yeah, a compile or the source of openal (less than 30 seconds) fixed it!
2005-10-31T10:21:00.000Z	robotgeek	rixth	cool, and not fun
