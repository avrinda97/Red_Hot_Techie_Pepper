2011-11-19T19:08:00.000Z	juhsis		hey guys i cant join gcc channel so i try to ask here, how can i manually link shared libraries in gcc command?
2011-11-19T19:09:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	Why cant you join that channel?
2012-07-29T13:50:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	You cant do like you want it. Obviously you dont have a hardware raid0 controller, but a windows-based software-raid-controller, which is unusable in Ubuntu.
2012-07-29T13:51:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	: so what can i do?
2012-07-29T13:51:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	Eithe your set up a software raid in Ubuntu (while installing) or you just use two seperate disks.
2012-07-29T13:52:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	And since you formatted both disks in Windows, for using them as RAID0, you have to kill that entire setup.
2012-07-29T13:53:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	i connect them in boot menu, not with windows..
2012-07-29T13:53:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	i have p8p67 mainboard, a brand new version with brand new technologies..
2012-07-29T13:54:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	so as i think, it is hardware controlled raid0
2012-07-29T13:54:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	And that mainboard does not have a hardware raid controller, but relies on a windows driver to create a windows-driver-based software raid.
2012-07-29T13:54:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	ahh ok
2012-07-29T13:55:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	i can format it if i will have both ubuntu and windows installed on my disk
2012-07-29T13:55:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	but if possible i want to use it as raid0 in future..
2012-07-29T13:56:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	Only as software raid, not as hardware raid. And without a backup, a RAID0 is pretty close to suicide ;)
2012-07-29T13:57:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	so you suggest me to use them seperated, right?
2012-07-29T13:57:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	Yes.
2012-07-29T13:59:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	Thats a plain dual-boot setup. No rocket science :)
2012-07-29T13:59:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	i want to see OS selection menu, on startup..
2012-07-29T14:00:00.000Z	bekks	juhsis	That is called Dual-boot.

2012-07-29T14:00:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	thanks :)
2012-07-29T14:00:00.000Z	juhsis	bekks	thats what i seek :)
