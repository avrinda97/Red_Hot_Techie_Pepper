2007-01-13T12:33:00.000Z	croatoan		i get really poor frames with the MESA drivers
2007-01-13T12:33:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	*everybody* does... it's software
2007-01-13T12:33:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	so installing the ATI drivers for OpenGL is the right thing to do:?
2007-01-13T12:33:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	I would say yes
2007-01-13T12:34:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	well i installed them, but fglrxinfo is still telling me that i'm using the mesa drivers???
2007-01-13T12:35:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	you need 3 things to get hardware OpenGL : 1. kernel video driver 2. Xorg video driver 3. hardware OpenGL driver for Xorg
2007-01-13T12:36:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	you're missing one or more
2007-01-13T12:36:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	i'm missing the OpenGL driver for Xorg
2007-01-13T12:36:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	then you haven't got fglrx, no ?
2007-01-13T12:37:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	well now i look and I see that I actually DO have that driver
2007-01-13T12:37:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	glxinfo | grep direct
2007-01-13T12:38:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	did you configure opengl ?
2007-01-13T12:38:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	what's the command?
2007-01-13T12:39:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	what is the command to configure OpenGL?
2007-01-13T12:40:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	not sure, but the wiki should certainly have it
2007-01-13T12:40:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	well it said to run aticonfig which i did
2007-01-13T12:40:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	and what did that tell you ?
2007-01-13T12:42:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	not sure
2007-01-13T12:43:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	I think that for some reason Ubuntu is still using the original fglrx instead of the ATI version, if that makes sense
2007-01-13T12:43:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	i followed the wiki verbatum
2007-01-13T12:43:00.000Z	adaptr	croatoan	none whatsoever - fglrx == ati == ati only
2007-01-13T12:43:00.000Z	croatoan	adaptr	sorry....nib here
