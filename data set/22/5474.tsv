2007-04-25T14:54:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	you only need to ask once. just change the mount point in fstab.
2007-04-25T14:54:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	just make sure you copy ALL of the files from your current /home directory to the new one, including all dot folders and files.
2007-04-25T14:55:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	and you shouldn't have a problem.
2007-04-25T14:56:00.000Z	paritosh	Nubbie	Sorry there mate, i added /dev/hda4 /home reiserfs rw,auto 0 0 to fstab. then i relogged in with gnome. it couldn't load a session
2007-04-25T14:56:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	did you copy the files from your old home directory to the new one?
2007-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	including all hidden folders/files?
2007-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	paritosh	Nubbie	it would let me login..:S
2007-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	you don't need to be logged in :D
2007-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	your old /home directory still exists, correct?
2007-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	okay you'll need to mount the old home directory again.
2007-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	it doesn't matter where you mount it.
2007-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	then just do a sudo cp -R /path/to/oldhome /path/to/newhome
2007-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	paritosh	Nubbie	its already mounted. im using the old home directory again.
2007-04-25T14:59:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	okay... is your new /home directory mounted? mount it inside your old home directory.
2007-04-25T15:00:00.000Z	paritosh	Nubbie	ok
2007-04-25T15:00:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	you have your new reiser partition mounted inside your /home directory?
2007-04-25T15:01:00.000Z	paritosh	Nubbie	just a min
2007-04-25T15:02:00.000Z	Nubbie	paritosh	you with me?
