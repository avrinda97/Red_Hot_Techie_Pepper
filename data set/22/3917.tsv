2008-04-29T23:12:00.000Z	balle_		i'm having problems installing the proprietary drivers for my nvidia grafix card, would the free alternative be any easier to install or have better odds of working?
2008-04-29T23:13:00.000Z	engywook	balle_	use envy instead, it sets it up for you
2008-04-29T23:14:00.000Z	balle_	engywook	envy as in the free stuff right? thx, thought that, but there is not a big risk of it messing up my system or what?
2008-04-29T23:14:00.000Z	engywook	balle_	nah, it's a program that downloads the right driver and sets up xorg.conf for you. just back up xorg.conf if you're worried
2008-04-29T23:15:00.000Z	balle_	engywook	found envy allright, ehm... how du i back up xorg.conf again?
2008-04-29T23:16:00.000Z	balle_	engywook	well i know what to do now, i will try it. thx for the help
