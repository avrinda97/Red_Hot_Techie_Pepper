2007-12-08T19:06:00.000Z	SpookyET		Hello
2007-12-08T19:07:00.000Z	SpookyET		my / partition is full. I had about 50 megs left yesterday on it. now, it's full. no config file can take 50 megs. How can I give a search command to see all files that were created on / yesteday?
2007-12-08T19:09:00.000Z	SpookyET		I'm trying to figure out how / got full.
2007-12-08T19:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	50 megs isnt much free these days...  burn var/cache/apt/archives to a cd or dvd to make room
2007-12-08T19:10:00.000Z	SpookyET	Jack_Sparrow	 /var has its own partition
2007-12-11T21:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	I use the dd command
2007-12-14T21:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Not a good idea to put it in the freezer.. condensation will most likely kill it.. (although 2 minuts is hardly long enough to get it cold enough)
2007-12-14T21:07:00.000Z	SpookyET	Jack_Sparrow	Cold enough to trick acpi into booting
2007-12-14T21:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Still not a good idea..
2007-12-19T04:06:00.000Z	SpookyET	Jack_Sparrow	tar has no concept of sliced archives. You can't untar somefile01.tar.gz and expect it to open somefile02.tar.gz and continue until the end
2008-01-23T08:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Thanks, but did you have a question or need help...
2008-01-23T08:04:00.000Z	SpookyET	Jack_Sparrow	the question is at that link
2008-03-10T23:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	gconf editor?
2008-03-10T23:16:00.000Z	SpookyET	Jack_Sparrow	it's a settings editor
2008-03-10T23:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Yea, I know
2008-03-10T23:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Yea, I know gconf-editor
2008-06-11T04:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Still there.. http://getdeb.net/
2008-06-11T04:55:00.000Z	SpookyET	Jack_Sparrow	that's not a repository.
2008-06-11T04:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	getdeb has never been a repo
2008-06-11T04:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Let me rephrase that.. not an official one that I am aware of
2008-06-11T04:57:00.000Z	SpookyET	Jack_Sparrow	of coarse there is not an official one, but there was one. now, it's empty
2008-07-02T20:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpookyET	Bogaurd   Please take that to a private chat
