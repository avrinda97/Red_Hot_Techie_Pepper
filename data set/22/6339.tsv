2006-11-10T07:02:00.000Z	ThomasPorter		Hey all, I need to copy a .htaccess file using a skel folder (the folder is providered by VHCS called 'domain_default_page')... But it doesn't seem to copy. I assume this is because of the nature of the filename... the dot infront of htaccess makes it root readable only.. how would I overcome this problem?
2006-11-10T07:04:00.000Z	ThomasPorter		Don't make any typo's with that rm -rf command :|
2006-11-10T07:06:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	there you can see it :D
2006-11-10T07:05:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	try ls -lia in the directory
2006-11-10T07:06:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	Its there: 3190951 -rw-r--r--   1 root     root      111 2006-11-10 23:36 .htaccess
2006-11-10T07:07:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	But I want to copy it from that dir, to another dir ;)
2006-11-10T07:07:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	cant you copy it ?
2006-11-10T07:07:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	No, cp doesn't allow it.
2006-11-10T07:07:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	Nor does using the skel directory
2006-11-10T07:08:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	I think because .something is root only, and the skel directory (for my isp cp) uses the user nobody
2006-11-10T07:08:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	chown --help
2006-11-10T07:09:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	chown username .htaccess
2006-11-10T07:09:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	Ah, how can I find out the username owning a file?
2006-11-10T07:10:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	you have root access dont u?
2006-11-10T07:10:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	Yes I do
2006-11-10T07:10:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	whoami
2006-11-10T07:11:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	chown username .htaccess  the username is your username
2006-11-10T07:12:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	-rw-r--r--  1 www-data root 111 2006-11-10 23:36 .htaccess So it should copy now right?
2006-11-10T07:13:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	 have u chown the file? if u have,then it should be your file,not root file anymore
2006-11-10T07:20:00.000Z	ThomasPorter	sc4ttrbrain	4 drwxr-xr-x   2 www-data root     4096 2006-11-11 09:42 .layout How would I change it so it says www-data www-data instead of www-data root, because it doesn't copy as is.
2006-11-10T07:28:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	sorry,ok,first go to the directory,chown www-data .layout to make the file owner www-data
2006-11-10T07:30:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	ThomasPorter	the easy way is if u use nautilus, click view hidden files, click propertise change it to what u need
