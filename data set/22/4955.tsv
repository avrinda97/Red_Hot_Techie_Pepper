2010-01-13T06:02:00.000Z	RandomUsr		does anyone have decent experience with Samba?
2010-01-13T06:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 its very well documented and theres 10000's+ of people that use it
2010-01-13T06:04:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	I'm not able to connect using smbclient from Linux to a window's share
2010-01-13T06:04:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	could you provide some guidance?
2010-01-13T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 try connecting via ip  not the machine name.
2010-01-13T06:05:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	do you think that dns issues are common?
2010-01-13T06:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 samba takes tgweaking to use DNS proplery. it has its own alternative. I just cheat and edit the /etc/hosts with the right ip/names most of the time
2010-01-13T06:06:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	would you look at that? it works
2010-01-13T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 Ive had issues with  windiows/linux box's and samba lately. seesm to work better now  that i enabled the wins server featuire in teh samba configs.
2010-01-13T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 i was able to access via ip. but not hostname - now that i got wins enabled. its working via hostname
2010-01-14T05:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 if yiu mean openoffice writer the command is like oowriter  i think
2010-01-20T07:29:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	how so?
2010-01-20T07:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 check the ip/network the virtual machine is on. Some are set up to keep the vm's on their own Subnet.
2010-01-20T07:27:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	it's Not. I can see the Linux Guest, but the problem is when I attempt to browse the Linux Machine
2010-01-20T07:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 i always share the users HOME on my linux box's and enter the full url to it in the file managers.. that seems to straighten things out.. or browse it by ip# not hostname
2010-01-20T07:28:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	could you look at my smb.conf? http://pastebin.com/m5f0cd3fc
2010-01-20T07:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 last i had issues seeing shares and stuff. it was not the smb.conf that was the fault. it was the windows os that was being dumb
2010-01-20T07:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 windows wouldent access my machines UNLESS i used  the \\\192.168.1.\sharename     but not always... some times i could use teh machine name.... go figure
2010-01-20T07:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 even now i cent access the windows machines on the lan that are using wireless.. (i think) not sure why that is.
2010-01-20T07:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 but they can access the linux shares.. :) it gets all weird.
2010-01-20T07:31:00.000Z	RandomUsr	Dr_Willis	Could NAT be the issue?
2010-01-20T07:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RandomUsr	 not sure. I not tracked down all teh issues. I enabled teh 'wins' server on one of my linux box' and the network seems to work a little better now.. Wireless still causes a block. but that might be the router
