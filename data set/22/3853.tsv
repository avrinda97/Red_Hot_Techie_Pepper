2011-12-29T21:52:00.000Z	becker_11		my sound had departed the building tonight after working flawlessly for nearly a month I have rebooted and checked everything I can think of with no luck
2011-12-29T21:52:00.000Z	becker_11		does anyone have a suggestion on how to fix my sound please
2011-12-29T21:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*
2011-12-29T21:55:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	okay but what happens after I remove pulseaudio
2011-12-29T21:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	pulseaudio isn't removed, the process is merely killed, it will restart after a few seconds
2011-12-29T21:55:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	okay I'll try it
2011-12-29T21:58:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	Thankyou so much that worked perfectly
2011-12-29T22:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	np :), you just gave the sound default settings. helps a lot
2011-12-29T22:01:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	I've saved it too an evernote note so it's ready if I ever need it again
2011-12-29T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	could make it a script :)
2011-12-29T22:03:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	to run at startup you mean?
2011-12-29T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	no, just to run when needed
2011-12-29T22:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	or make an alias instead
2011-12-29T22:04:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	I guess I could
2011-12-29T22:04:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	I'm better with aliases
2011-12-29T22:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	see if you need it again, might not be required
2011-12-29T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	unity uses Gnome3 as it;s DE if you are using Oneiric
2011-12-29T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	Unity isn't a DE
2011-12-29T22:10:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	okay I didn't know that so is it possible to get vanilla gnome 3 sans unity?
2011-12-29T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	there is a method to make it look like Gnome2 if you wish
2011-12-29T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	becker_11	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/how-to-make-ubuntu-11-10-look-and-feel-like-gnome-2/
2011-12-29T22:12:00.000Z	becker_11	ActionParsnip	thanks I'll check it out
