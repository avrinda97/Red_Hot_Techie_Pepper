2004-10-16T13:26:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	was that to me?
2004-10-16T13:26:00.000Z	crimsun	mxpxpod	half-jokingly, yes
2004-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	my hard drive is crashing, so I need to get an image of my drive that I can use to restore my drive if the place I'm taking it to can't back it up
2004-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	so I looked here: http://www.cpqlinux.com/ddbackup.html and it says to go into rescue mode (or another one told me that)
2004-10-16T13:28:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	cool :)
2004-10-16T13:28:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	also, check if there's ssh in rescue mode if it exists
2004-10-16T13:35:00.000Z	crimsun	mxpxpod	there doesn't appear to be :/
2004-10-16T13:35:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	:(
2004-10-16T13:35:00.000Z	crimsun	mxpxpod	could try busybox on the second console, though
2004-11-22T09:34:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	awesome
2006-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	was that for me?
2006-05-13T14:19:00.000Z	crimsun	mxpxpod	yes
2006-05-13T14:19:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	thanks
2006-05-13T14:19:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	any known problems?
2006-05-13T14:20:00.000Z	crimsun	mxpxpod	sorry, but I don't maintain Malone bugs in my brain =) . Seriously, I don't know offhand, but I'm sure there are a couple.
2006-05-13T14:20:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	ok, sorry
2006-05-13T14:20:00.000Z	crimsun	mxpxpod	shouldn't be anything release-critical, however
2006-05-13T14:20:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	gotcha
2006-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	mxpxpod	crimsun	I'm going to get a new computer for the office, so I'm looking at all the newest stuff :)
