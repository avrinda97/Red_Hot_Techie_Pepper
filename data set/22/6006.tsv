2007-01-04T15:54:00.000Z	Snakesonatrain		Any clue stef?
2007-01-04T15:56:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	were you using a different machine with this ISP recently?
2007-01-04T15:57:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	power cyle the modem for ~5 minutes. your ISP has probably done a MAC address assignment.
2007-01-04T16:00:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	youi need to turn the modem and any machines connectedi to it off. for 5 minutes.
2007-01-04T16:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	so ask your ISP what is wrong with their DHCP
2007-01-04T16:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	"they say"
2007-01-04T16:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	you have evidence it is not
2007-01-04T16:07:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	that logic is somewhat flawed
2007-01-04T16:09:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	sudo dhclient eth0
2007-01-04T16:10:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	it. is. the. ISP.
2007-01-04T16:13:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	ls /dev/eth*
2007-01-04T16:17:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	"Your DHCP server seems to expect certain clients, namely Windows. My money goes to companies that support standards, not break them. Please use RFC-compliant DHCP or lose my business."
2007-01-04T16:17:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	ls /dev/eth*
2007-01-04T16:17:00.000Z	Snakesonatrain	mneptok	that dir doesn't exsist on my machine
2007-01-04T16:18:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	what kind of NIC?
2007-01-04T16:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	what kind?
2007-01-04T16:19:00.000Z	Snakesonatrain	mneptok	Intel nic. Tha'ts about all I know.
2007-01-04T16:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	if the drivers for that NIC are binary blobs, then the drivers are not installed
2007-01-04T16:23:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	no
2007-01-04T16:29:00.000Z	Snakesonatrain	mneptok	.. bash lo command not found
2007-01-04T16:30:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	lo is the name of the loopback interface ;)
2007-01-04T16:30:00.000Z	mneptok	Snakesonatrain	you're not pinging the NIC. you're pinging lo.
