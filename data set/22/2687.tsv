2009-09-07T01:52:00.000Z	zealiod		how can i run a shell script on boot?
2009-09-07T01:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	add it to your startup items in prefs or put it in /etc/rc.local if it needs root
2009-09-07T01:57:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	i dont have an rc.local dir?
2009-09-07T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	its not a folder, its a file in /etc
2009-09-07T01:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	put the commands / script call above the exit line
2009-09-07T02:00:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	So do I just put the path to the shell script...
2009-09-07T02:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	use the absolute path, from /
2009-09-07T02:01:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	doesnt that run on every run level?
2009-09-07T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	it runs after all thats done dude
2009-09-07T02:08:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	on start up?
2009-09-07T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	indeed
2009-09-07T02:09:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	and not on shutdown?
2009-09-07T02:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	no,just startup
2009-09-22T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	rarp is a defacto standard
2009-09-22T18:41:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	But its not available in my kernel...
2009-09-22T18:42:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	i need to obtain an ip addres from a mac address on my LAN
2009-09-22T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	try dig
2009-09-22T18:50:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	Is dig really suited to LAN lookups?
2009-09-22T18:51:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	had a read through the man and did some tests... not sure thats going to work
2009-09-22T18:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	it will use your listed nameservers to give the details
2009-09-22T18:52:00.000Z	zealiod	ActionParsnip	but the addresses are private...
2009-09-22T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zealiod	mac addresses are needed for the final hop so are required, dig (i think) gets that
