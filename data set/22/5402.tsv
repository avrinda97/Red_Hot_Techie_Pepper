2007-05-08T15:30:00.000Z	Mutal1ty		is there a channel for sound help?
2007-05-08T15:30:00.000Z	Mutal1ty		my card is AC-97 compatible and i must "enable" <M> Intel/SiS/nVidia/AMD/ALi AC97 Controller
2007-05-08T15:31:00.000Z	Mutal1ty		but I have no idea how to go about htis
2007-05-08T15:31:00.000Z	Mutal1ty		this*
2007-05-08T15:31:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	it is already in the ubuntu generic kernel
2007-05-08T15:32:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	check that the module is loaded
2007-05-08T15:32:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	lsmod | grep ac97
2007-05-08T15:34:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	what about lsmod | grep snd
2007-05-08T15:35:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	err, you don't have any sound moduels loaded at all
2007-05-08T15:37:00.000Z	Mutal1ty	eck	How do I load the Modules?
2007-05-08T15:37:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	you can load them manually if you figure out what hardware you have, but they _should_ but automatically loaded if your sound card was seen by the kernel
2007-05-08T15:39:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	i would start by checking the ubuntu forums to see if anyone has any threads on your card
2007-05-08T15:39:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	you ought to have the module, try "sudo modprobe snd_ac97_codec"
2007-05-08T15:40:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	what kernel are you running?
2007-05-08T15:41:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	what about uname -a
2007-05-08T15:42:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	maybe it's a 64 bit thing, i'm not sure
2007-05-08T15:42:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	i guess you could download the x86 live cd, and see if you can play music on that
2007-05-08T15:43:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	see also dmesg
2007-05-08T15:45:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	i guess you can grep it, but you probably just want to scan through and look for anything that seems to be an error loading sound things
2007-05-08T15:46:00.000Z	eck	Mutal1ty	maybe you need to reinstall your kernel package?
2007-05-08T15:52:00.000Z	Mutal1ty	eck	you there?
2007-05-08T15:52:00.000Z	Mutal1ty	eck	you there?
