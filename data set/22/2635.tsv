2009-08-30T20:10:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	legend2440	cp: cannot stat `RT2860STA.dat': No such file or directory
2009-08-30T20:10:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	you have to be in the dir where the dat file is
2009-08-30T20:19:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	does lsmod show it already installed?
2009-08-30T20:19:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	legend2440	There is a driver there, but it's an older version. My WPA/WPA2 network won't work on it, hence why I'm upgrading it.
2009-08-30T20:20:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	what command are you using to install new one?
2009-08-30T20:20:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	legend2440	insmod
2009-08-30T20:22:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	try what arand said
2009-08-30T20:28:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	what version is new one?

2009-08-30T20:37:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	i downloaded  2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_WebUI_v2.1.2.0.tgz and inside there is an  install.sh script that will compile and install the module

2009-08-30T20:39:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	legend2440	Thanks! :D
2009-08-30T20:40:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	legend2440	Uhm, that's the file I was working on, can't find a install.sh file in there :/
2009-08-30T20:42:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	really? i'm reading it.  there are four files in there and one is install.sh
2009-08-30T20:42:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	legend2440	Sorry, my mistake, downloaded the wrong one again xD
2009-08-30T20:44:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	yes i counted wrong
2009-08-30T20:45:00.000Z	Mr_Kaizer	legend2440	So I ran the install file, not much happened... do I run the run.sh, or am I done and can just reboot?
2009-08-30T20:47:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	i think you have to run  sudo ./install.sh so it has root permissions to mkdir and install
2009-08-30T20:48:00.000Z	legend2440	Mr_Kaizer	unfortunately they didnt include a README or Install file with directions
