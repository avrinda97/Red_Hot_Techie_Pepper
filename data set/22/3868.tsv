2008-05-24T09:43:00.000Z	CLEARviewF		hi!... does anybody know what is the Rythmbox IRC channel?
2008-05-24T09:43:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	What's the problem?
2008-05-24T09:44:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	i can not edit my tags in Rythmbox
2008-05-24T09:44:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	Any of them?
2008-05-24T09:45:00.000Z	CLEARviewF		When i sue Amarok, all my tags are edited like i want, but, when i see the same Collection with Rythmbox, the collection is diferent and bad configured, why?
2008-05-24T09:46:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	That's an ID3/metadata problem. You're just editing their face values in the given program, not the actual file itself.
2008-05-24T09:46:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	i have a relative big collection, 7700 songs
2008-05-24T09:46:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	I do not know if MusicBrainz works in Linux, but it is an excellent auto-tagging system. One moment, let me check for you.
2008-05-24T09:47:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	and around 700 have lost his tags in rythmbox, why?
2008-05-24T09:47:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	Hang tight one moment bud.
2008-05-24T09:49:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	Ok do this for me. Go to http://musicbrainz.org/doc/PicardDownload and download the Linux version, install it and pull it up. I'll provide a guide on how to use it in just one more moment...
2008-05-24T09:50:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	i can see MuzikBrains in Amarok but i made a .asoundrc file to duplicate my stereo channel to 4.0 and now i can not use Amarok because it crashes, someting about Xine, i am in Hardy, using ALSA instead of PULSE because PULSE is buggy in Hardy :)
2008-05-24T09:52:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	Obviously Musicbrainz did not rewrite the ID3 tags of the files when used in Amarok. I personally do not use my Amarok/Musicbrainz extension, I just use the program itself. Try downloading it and using that itself.
2008-05-24T09:52:00.000Z	Y		CLEARviewF:
2008-05-24T09:53:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	i dont use MuzikBrain in amarok, i use the program all the time to edit my tags
2008-05-24T09:54:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	I don't use Rhthymbox, but you'll probably need to update your collection some how. If you use Picard then it's re-written the metadata and the files, despite their face names, should load properly in any music player.
2008-05-24T09:54:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	When i reinstall another Linux Distribution and use my old Collection in Amarok, all the tags are fine and in the place these has to be, but in Rythmbox it doesn't work.....
2008-05-24T09:58:00.000Z	Y	CLEARviewF	Hmmm... Try uninstalling RB and reinstalling it is all I can suggest.
2008-05-24T10:00:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	you mean, i do: sudo apt-get remove --purge rythmbox* ?
2008-05-24T10:04:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	eythmbox has an IRC channel?
2008-05-24T10:05:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	i am installing Picard using the repo for Ubuntu
2008-05-24T10:37:00.000Z	CLEARviewF	Y	how do i set the album cover with Picard in the tag of the album?
