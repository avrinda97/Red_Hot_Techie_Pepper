2012-07-03T11:31:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	It looks like you don't have the packages installed...
2012-07-03T11:37:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	it should now ask you if you want to continue y/n
2012-07-03T11:39:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	type "ls /etc/my.cnf"
2012-07-03T11:41:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	what, exactly, was the output when you pasted that apt-get line I last sent you?
2012-07-03T11:45:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	also, can you paste the output of the apt-get line to paste.ubuntu.com for me
2012-07-03T11:51:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	okay, type ls /var/log
2012-07-03T11:55:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	did you send me the url of your paste?
2012-07-03T11:58:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	okay. good. apache is definitely installed then
2012-07-03T11:59:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	so type tail -n 30 /var/log/apache2/error.log
2012-07-03T12:01:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	the log file is empty?
2012-07-03T12:05:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	just paste this "tail -n 30 /var/log/apache2/error.log" into your command console.
2012-07-03T12:08:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	so you get a file not found error when you paste that line?
2012-07-03T12:13:00.000Z	moj0rising	samir	I have to go as well. Sorry I can't stay to help you more. I think once you see the contents of your error.log file, it wil become more clear as to what the matter is.
