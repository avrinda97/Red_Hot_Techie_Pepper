2008-06-03T03:48:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	yes
2008-06-03T03:38:00.000Z	STSX	tommy_	You probably need to add it to your /etc/fstab file to mount on startup--is that what you are looking for?
2008-06-03T03:39:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	im looking for my internal NTFS HDD which Ubuntu 7.10 used to show .  What do I add to /etc/fstab?
2008-06-03T03:39:00.000Z	STSX	tommy_	Well do you want to just temporarily mount it or do you want to have it automatically mount at startup?
2008-06-03T03:40:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	i want it to always be shown as it used to be on 7.10
2008-06-03T03:40:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	but how do I temporarily mount it?
2008-06-03T03:42:00.000Z	STSX	tommy_	OK, how about posting the contents of your /etc/fstab file first? Just post it to paste.ubuntu.com. If you need more specifics on that let me know.
2008-06-03T03:43:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	I found a solution.  it was simple.  I just sudo apt-get install ntfs-config and ran "sudo ntfs-config
2008-06-03T03:43:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	ntfs-config did all the work for me and added it to /etc/fstab
2008-06-03T03:43:00.000Z	STSX	tommy_	That's great--I forgot about that solution for Windows partitions. Thanks for the reminder. :)
2008-06-03T03:43:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	why did you just recommend ntfs-config instead of all the hard workaround?
2008-06-03T03:44:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	OK :)
2008-06-03T03:44:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	i have 1 more question
2008-06-03T03:44:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	7.10 used to show my hidden NTFS partition.  How do I get Hardy to show that?
2008-06-03T03:45:00.000Z	STSX	tommy_	What do you mean "hidden"?
2008-06-03T03:46:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	Acronis Trueimage enables a person to create a hidden partition to store all the backup images.  7.10 Ubuntu used to show this partition on my desktop.  How I tell Hardy to do the same?
2008-06-03T03:48:00.000Z	STSX	tommy_	If you do a "sudo fdisk -l" does it show that partition?
2008-06-03T03:48:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	its my /dev/sda2 thats hidden.
2008-06-03T03:50:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	sudo cfdisk say its my /dev/sda5 thats hidden.  how I tell Hardy to show it?
2008-06-03T03:50:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	before I ask you any more questions.. are you a noob or experienced Ubuntu user? :P
2008-06-03T03:51:00.000Z	STSX	tommy_	I'm experienced, but I don't claim to be a super-authority or anything. If you would rather have someone else's help I won't be offended.
2008-06-03T03:52:00.000Z	tommy_	STSX	nice comeback to save face and your pride, seeing you cannot answer me and have no idea :P
