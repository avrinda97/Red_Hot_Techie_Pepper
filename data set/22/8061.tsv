2005-10-24T08:54:00.000Z	sector10		i cant seem to adjust synaptics touchpad in xorg.conf
2005-10-24T08:55:00.000Z	sector10		is it so simple that i have to recompile kernel?
2005-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	sector10		supposidly the touchpad is now part of kernel with no chance to configure.
2005-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	sector10		that makes it simple but dead!
2005-10-24T08:04:00.000Z	sector10		there seems to be no way to easily configure synaptics touchpad
2005-10-24T08:04:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	sector10	you're right - I have the same problem.
2005-10-24T08:05:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	what do you have for equipment?
2005-10-24T08:06:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	sector10	I'm using an ASUS laptop with a synaptics touchpad.
2005-10-24T08:06:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	sony vaio with nvidia here
2005-10-24T08:06:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	do you got windows opening on accident becuase its too sensative?
2005-10-24T08:07:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	sector10	yes. It also randomly starts scrolling up and not stopping.
2005-10-24T08:07:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	same here, and my typing is jumpy
2005-10-24T08:08:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	Ubuntu should have done something about it.
2005-10-24T08:08:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	there is no utility which works
2005-10-24T08:08:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	its in the kernel im afraid
2005-10-24T08:09:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	xorg.conf is not really correct, you can add tap time etc to no avail
2005-10-24T08:09:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	the driver for synaptics is not there its in the kernel I think
2005-10-24T08:10:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	this is why ksynaptics, qsynaptic all dont work
2005-10-24T08:10:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	look in synaptic package manager
2005-10-24T08:11:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	you should try them, if they dont function or complain of missing driver...
2005-10-24T08:13:00.000Z	sector10	YukiIkyuta	earlier kernel versions allowed for the ksynaptics gui to configure touchpad. Now I read its supposed to be part of the kernel and there is no way to change anything. So its broke.
2005-10-24T08:13:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	sector10	I would try it, but I can't restart X right now.
