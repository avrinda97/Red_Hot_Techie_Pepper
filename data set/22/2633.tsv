2009-04-23T04:26:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	I did actually mean to add that. Silly me.
2009-04-23T04:31:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	I the only unstable part of Ubuntu.. pretty much ever, are the proprietary drivers.
2009-04-23T04:31:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	Err sorry. I meant for ME.
2009-04-23T04:31:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	My friend had Vista/Ubuntu dual-booted.
2009-04-23T04:31:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Somehow he made Ubuntu corrupt the tiniest bit of data.
2009-04-23T04:31:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	I hear those two do not play well together.
2009-04-23T04:31:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Then he booted Vista and vista managed to hose the ENTIRE partition table.
2009-04-23T04:32:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Vista just hates everything, including itself
2009-04-23T04:32:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	I have unstable builds of Win7 here though, because of my dad, and its much better.
2009-04-23T04:32:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Under NDA though so I can't say more than that.
2009-04-23T04:33:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	I still haven't tried Vista even.. I only have XP for games, and the benchmarks frown on Vista performance numbers compared to Xp
2009-04-23T04:33:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	For non DX10 games of course. I hope Win7 is a little less bloat than Vista
2009-04-23T04:33:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Win7 is so much better. I love it.
2009-04-23T04:33:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	The beta is only a glimpse of the improvements. Its actually really high quality stuff.
2009-04-23T04:34:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	Oh ok cool. I'll give that one a try then. It means more to me when it comes from a *buntu fella.
2009-04-23T04:34:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	As much as I hate M$, (seriously), win7 actually excites me.
2009-04-23T04:34:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Its kind of funny when you work for Microsoft and you're son is an open-source advocate who hates Microsoft. Its an interesting dynamic.
2009-04-23T04:35:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	Well as a network tech, i'm just interested in how well Win7 plays with others.(Groupware squites, AD.. that sorta thing)
2009-04-23T04:35:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Can't tell you much on that. The network stack has seen some improvements.
2009-04-23T04:35:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	WS|Thermal	I HATE fighting with WIndows on job :(
2009-04-23T04:35:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	I suggest you grab a leaked build of win7 off some torrents, if you need to test it
2009-04-23T04:35:00.000Z	WS|Thermal	Lord_Devi	Install it on a VM or a non-production machine though.
