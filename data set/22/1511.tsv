2010-04-29T02:04:00.000Z	StephenWins		and when I do sudo umount /media/Free... it just tries and tries and doesn't stop (on terminal)
2010-04-29T02:04:00.000Z	StephenWins		I don't get an error message, or nothing
2010-04-29T02:05:00.000Z	StephenWins		10.4, is it some strange bug?
2010-04-29T02:05:00.000Z	StephenWins		that doesn't work
2010-04-29T02:06:00.000Z	StephenWins		what's FS? there's no files in them
2010-04-29T02:06:00.000Z	StephenWins		in any of them
2010-04-29T02:06:00.000Z	StephenWins		nothing in them
2010-04-29T02:06:00.000Z	StephenWins		any
2010-04-29T02:06:00.000Z	StephenWins		no
2010-04-29T02:07:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	you want to umount?
2010-04-29T02:11:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	when the system things the removeable drive is still mounted while it is unplugged, next time you plug that removeable device again (while the system is still under that confusion), you will have another folder that differs from the first by a number and sometimes with an underscore at the end
2010-04-29T02:11:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	thinks
2010-04-29T02:12:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	that should be battery settings
2010-04-29T02:12:00.000Z	StephenWins	mkhanyisi	yeah, it does an underscore
2010-04-29T02:13:00.000Z	StephenWins	mkhanyisi	system -> preferences -> power management?
2010-04-29T02:14:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	ALT+F2 then type gnome-power-preferences
2010-04-29T02:14:00.000Z	StephenWins	mkhanyisi	yeah, I don't see the "ask for password" or "go on standby" or any of that, it's not there
2010-04-29T02:15:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	I thought you want to disable sleeping altogether
2010-04-29T02:16:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	under On Ac Power there is a "Display" section
2010-04-29T02:16:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	Remember this has implication on your battery life
2010-04-29T02:17:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	I mean if your laptop does not sleep and is always 100% bright (esp On Battery)
2010-04-29T02:18:00.000Z	mkhanyisi	StephenWins	I dont think  its a problem for On AC Power mode
