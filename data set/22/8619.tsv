2005-09-22T16:32:00.000Z	Kyral		Anyone know a good interface to IpTables?
2005-09-22T16:32:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	for a desktop box? try firestarter. nice and easy.
2005-09-22T16:39:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	"up /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -s ! 128.153.0.0/16 -p tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT"  in /etc/network/interfaces 9under eth0) would see you sorted too. it'd get reloaded each boot.
2005-09-22T16:40:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	That rule would block all tcp traffic to port 22 if it didn't originate at 128.153.0.0/16
2005-09-22T16:40:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	only rhe bit inbetwene the double quotes is relevant
2005-09-22T16:41:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	This would currently be appened, so it would probably not override anything.
2005-09-22T16:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	"up /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -s ! 128.153.0.0/16 -p tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT" in /etc/network/interfaces associated with the iface eth0 stanza.
2005-09-22T05:01:00.000Z	Kyral	cafuego_	that line about the redirecting the denied SSH probes won't affect my legit ones?
2005-09-22T05:01:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	It will if you use the faulty rule I posted
2005-09-22T05:02:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	.. so don't use that one :-)
2005-09-22T05:03:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	Use the exact same rule, but use '-j MIRROR' instead of '-j REJECT'
2005-09-22T05:04:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	It is. I usedit to redirect back orifice and MS SQL worm requests
2005-09-22T05:04:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	if it's in the interfaces file, yes
2005-09-22T05:05:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	it's not the ideal way for a complex firewall, but with a single rule, it works fine.
2005-09-22T05:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	Yes, it ONLY affects incoming non-lcoal ssh
2005-09-22T05:09:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	Does it work when you run it by hand?
2005-09-22T05:11:00.000Z	Kyral	cafuego_	 iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
2005-09-22T05:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	try -J REJECT instead of MIRRRO and see if that helps (maybe you don't have mirror target support)
2005-09-22T05:15:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	Okay, kernel doesn't have MIRROR enabled. Ohw ell :-)
2005-09-22T05:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	Easy enough, but probably not worth it.
2005-09-22T05:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	 :-)
2005-10-19T05:19:00.000Z	cafuego_	Kyral	By fetching the source deb and building it on your own machine.
