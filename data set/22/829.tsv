2012-07-04T08:01:00.000Z	joaojeronimo		Anyone else having their flash video in an unwanted fast-forward mode in every website ?
2012-07-04T08:03:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Hmm. Nope, Try reinstalling the flash-plugin
2012-07-04T08:03:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	let me try that..
2012-07-04T08:05:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	is the package's name flashplugin-downloader ?
2012-07-04T08:05:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Yes :), try "sudo apt-get purge flashplugin-downloader && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-downloader"
2012-07-04T08:07:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	I did that and restarted the browser, but no success... Maybe I should try Flash-Aid (the firefox extension) ?
2012-07-04T08:08:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	also, I noted it was installing flashplugin-downloader:i386.... and it should be installing the amd64 or 64bit version I think...
2012-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Hmm, did you try right clicking on some flash content and making sure that the "fast-forward" option isnt checked?
2012-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	oh I'm sorry I didn't even know there was a fast-forward option... I'll check for that..
2012-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Nevermind aha, there isn't. I'm thinking back to 5-10 years ago when shockwave was still used.
2012-07-04T08:15:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	oh... well I tried the Flash-Aid options and none of the options seem to work with me (either the beta version from adobe or the stable version from the repositories...)
2012-07-04T08:16:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	in the flash website it says the global settings of flash in Linux/Gnome systems are in System > Preferences > Adobe Flash Player... but I can't find that... do you know where they are ?
2012-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	No, I can't either. Hmm
2012-07-04T08:20:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Try going into Sound preferaces and disabling hdmi, also try flash-aid
2012-07-04T08:20:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	already done that...
2012-07-04T08:24:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Dang.. I really don't know
2012-07-04T08:24:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	funny thing, after trying both the 32bit stable version from the repositories and the 64bit unstable version from Adobe Labs (through Flash-Aid), the videos on Firefox are now slow with some lags all the time, despite all the video loads ok... On chrome it's still in the weird fast forward mode.
2012-07-04T08:27:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Weird. I'm on 64-bit 12.04 gnome-shell and mine fine
2012-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	same here... This started yesterday I don't know if it was because of some update or not but if you're ok then it's not a bug...
2012-07-04T08:36:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	very weird: I purged everything related to flash, and now Chrome works fine but Firefox says there's an add-on missing... Does this mean Chrome has it's own bundled version of flash ?
2012-07-04T08:37:00.000Z	NictraSavios	joaojeronimo	Yes, it does. Google chrome even has its own bundles libraries
2012-07-04T08:37:00.000Z	joaojeronimo	NictraSavios	ohh... amazing...
