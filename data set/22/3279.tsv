2008-10-23T19:46:00.000Z	stevenbinion		anyone here a developer with eclipse and subversion for c/c++ and idl
2008-10-23T19:47:00.000Z	stevenbinion		did you try in console to type :> sudo apt-get install xchat ?
2008-10-23T19:48:00.000Z	Dextorion	stevenbinion	not using idl
2008-10-23T19:49:00.000Z	stevenbinion		thanks, Dextorion cause my development setup seems find. I just seem to be missing the idl to c++ compiler or eclipse is looking for /usr/local/bin/idlc anyway.
2008-10-23T19:49:00.000Z	stevenbinion		I gather svn updates and all.
2008-10-23T19:51:00.000Z	Dextorion	stevenbinion	no idea what idl is
2008-10-23T19:51:00.000Z	stevenbinion		thanks any way, I do some more searchs on ubuntu & idlc then
2008-10-23T19:52:00.000Z	stevenbinion		I know c/c++ and all I know is idl is another set of coding they're using on the project that I get off the SVN host
2008-10-23T19:53:00.000Z	stevenbinion		ummm
2008-10-23T19:55:00.000Z	stevenbinion		I'm currently using Ubuntu 8.04.1 anyone know when 8.10 will be ready for final release?
2008-10-23T19:55:00.000Z	Dextorion	stevenbinion	alrighty. Find out where you get the idl compiler from and install.
2008-10-23T19:55:00.000Z	stevenbinion		sweet.
2008-10-23T19:56:00.000Z	stevenbinion		working on that and trying to work at the same time...
2008-10-23T19:58:00.000Z	stevenbinion	Dextorion	there was one other issue I was having on another box of my, I set both up the same way, except the one is a CD install, the other is a VMware image
2008-10-23T19:58:00.000Z	stevenbinion		but the cd install that I setup from scratch. when I try to start an SVN project in Eclipse it says it can't find the default svn client
2008-10-23T19:59:00.000Z	Dextorion	stevenbinion	sudo apt-get install svn
2008-10-23T19:59:00.000Z	stevenbinion		lol.. ok. I tried close.. heheh only I thought I needed to be specific
2008-10-23T20:00:00.000Z	stevenbinion		I did sudo apt-get install rapidsvn
2008-10-23T20:00:00.000Z	stevenbinion		it was a subversion client
2008-10-23T20:00:00.000Z	Dextorion	stevenbinion	just a guess. But i guess the machine just doesnt have the svn client installed.
2008-10-23T20:00:00.000Z	Dextorion	stevenbinion	ah
