2006-07-15T06:04:00.000Z	sam_		how do you install kde under ubuntu?
2006-07-15T06:04:00.000Z	sam_		ta
2006-07-15T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	hold on...
2006-07-15T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	if you want a complete kde environment, install kubuntu-desktop
2006-07-15T06:10:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	don't listen. Playing mp3s does not require paying royalties.
2006-07-15T06:11:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	developing an mp3 player does require payments to the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in some legislatures.
2007-11-19T05:14:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	getting help here is a privilege, not an entitlement
2007-11-19T05:16:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	sorry, but I can't "acknowledge" every question about some exotic software by saying "I don't know". And I guess other participants here feel the same way. It's got nothing to do with ignoring you.
2007-11-19T05:17:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	so if nobody knows about devhook here, you'll have to bite the bullet and search somewhere else.
2007-11-19T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	you still don't understand how this channel works.
2007-11-19T05:18:00.000Z	sam_	soundray	yes, i do.
2007-11-19T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	your behaviour proves that you don't
2007-11-19T05:18:00.000Z	sam_	soundray	what behavior?
2007-11-19T05:19:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	<sam_> PLEASE HELP MEEEEE!!!!!
2007-11-19T05:19:00.000Z	sam_	soundray	yes, all caps gets peoples attention
2007-11-19T05:20:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	they can get you kicked as well
2007-11-19T05:21:00.000Z	sam_	soundray	if someone were to say ¨ Sam no one knows about that here try to find another channel¨ i would be fine but instead i send 100000 of those help messages being ignores and i sit here wondering if anyone sees what im saying or if im being ignored
2007-11-19T05:21:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	how would anyone know what everyone else on the channel does or doesn't know though?
2007-11-19T05:23:00.000Z	sam_	soundray	ok im sorry i got an attitude im just frustrated after searching google for 3 days and im sick of people ignoring me
2007-11-19T05:24:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	okay. Perhaps what you need to do is contact the developers -- they'll be interested since this is a regression (failure after upgrade).
2008-03-07T05:56:00.000Z	soundray	sam_	'sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop'
2008-03-07T05:56:00.000Z	sam_	soundray	thanks
