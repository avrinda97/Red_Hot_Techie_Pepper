2008-02-25T01:20:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	try right clicking on the volume control app (may have to double right click), then select preferences, then select PCM as item to control.
2008-02-25T01:33:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	Didn't work :(
2008-02-25T01:35:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	hmm...try opening up the mixer, by double clicking the speaker icons (with left button this time), when it is up, see which controls move when you use the computer buttons
2008-02-25T01:37:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	They don't budge
2008-02-25T01:38:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	Oh yeah... it's a capture thing that moves
2008-02-25T01:38:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	which controls do you have
2008-02-25T01:38:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	on the mixer :)
2008-02-25T01:39:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	Huh? There's a lot here...but the settings is set to PCM
2008-02-25T01:39:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	weird
2008-02-25T01:39:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	agree, if settings are set to pcm, should work...
2008-02-25T01:48:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	You know if there is any config-file which controls the mapping between the volume buttons and the channel it controls?
2008-02-25T01:49:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	Do I have to restart X to make the configuration change ?
2008-02-25T01:49:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	should not have to restart X...let me look around some
2008-02-25T01:54:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	i found an rc file: ~/.gnome2/gnome-volume-control, but all it has in mine is where to dock at :(
2008-02-25T01:54:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	can you check again by right clicking on the volume control, doing preferences, and see what is selected as item to control?
2008-02-25T01:55:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	hehe.. it's still PCM
2008-02-25T01:55:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	you got me...sorry
2008-02-25T01:56:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	hmm... is there any way I can run this with sudo ?
2008-02-25T01:57:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	dunno, a lot of the gnome/gtk stuff doesn't like to run as root
2008-02-25T01:58:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	I'm just thinking I might have done it before, and sat the preferences wrong
2008-02-25T01:58:00.000Z	robdig	MrMist	sounds likely then
2008-02-25T02:07:00.000Z	MrMist	robdig	I'm giving up for now... thanks though :)
