2007-11-25T08:50:00.000Z	majyk		why doesn't Ubuntu ship the latest Firefox? I just installed Ubuntu and I have 2.0.0.8 but 2.0.0.9 is out.... why is there a lag?
2007-11-25T08:51:00.000Z	majyk		why don't they just ship the latest official Firefox
2007-11-25T08:51:00.000Z	majyk		instead of doing whatever it is they do
2007-11-25T08:53:00.000Z	majyk		for instance Glade 3 is broke, will there be a fix for it?
2007-11-25T08:55:00.000Z	majyk		I'm holding out for the Ubuntu that evolves like Gentoo
2007-11-25T08:56:00.000Z	majyk		I want a binary distro like Ubuntu that evolves not stagnates for 6 months
2007-11-25T08:57:00.000Z	majyk		anyway just don't realize why Ubuntu doesn't ship the latest version of Firefox
2007-11-25T08:58:00.000Z	majyk		I mean is it really too much to ask to have the latest Firefox? Sure I could download a binary
2007-11-25T08:58:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	I'm sure theres a reason why.
2007-11-25T08:59:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	If you dont have any support questions and just want to complain, you are free to leave at any time.
2007-11-25T09:00:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	We don't need that kind of attitude here.
2007-11-25T09:00:00.000Z	majyk	Pici	I'm not complaining
2007-11-25T09:00:00.000Z	majyk	Pici	I don't have an attitude
2007-11-25T09:02:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	I'd tell you, but our issue/package tracking system (Launchpad) is currently down for planned maintenance.
2007-11-25T09:03:00.000Z	majyk	Pici	I see most people see my words as a complaint which tells me that I am not the only one to mention this
2007-11-25T09:04:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	I dont know right now.  I can't access the information.  But I'm sure that theres a logical reason why.
2007-11-25T09:06:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	If you want to look yourself in a bit, you can look at the firefox package's bug reports on bugs.ubuntu.com, but its scheduled to be down for right now.
2007-11-25T09:08:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	Security updates almost always get through, I'm sure theres a logical reason why this didn't.
2007-11-25T09:10:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	At this point the subeject is offtopic, please move to #ubuntu-offtopic :)
2007-11-25T09:10:00.000Z	majyk	Pici	I am not going to continue this
2007-11-25T09:11:00.000Z	Pici	majyk	okay :)
2007-11-25T09:11:00.000Z	majyk	Pici	the point is I like Ubuntu, I just don't agree with the 6 month release cycle, I think it's really outdated
