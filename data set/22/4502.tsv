2008-03-30T07:31:00.000Z	khaotik	webtoe	could you tell me if i am doing something wrong trying to install my broadcom driver?
2008-03-30T07:32:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	I might be able to but I don't have a broadcom chip so I can only offer adivce, not tell you what to do
2008-03-30T07:40:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	what was the way you did it before?
2008-03-30T07:52:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	you need to install ndiswrapper
2008-03-30T07:42:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	it could. Depends if the version has changed. When it does its called a regression. let me have a look at that look and maybe i can help. Otherwise maybe keep googling?
2008-03-30T07:46:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	then tend to the girl. I'll wait. My girlfriend never does! I know the feeling
2008-03-30T07:47:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	so have you receive any errors? if so what are they?
2008-03-30T07:50:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	can you type sudo ndiswrapper -l and tell me what it says
2008-03-30T07:50:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	does it say driver present. device presetn
2008-03-30T07:52:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	so what does it say way you type ndiswrapper?
2008-03-30T07:52:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	yeah go through the method described in that thread you posted
2008-03-30T07:54:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	ok
2008-03-30T08:10:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	good!
2008-03-30T08:10:00.000Z	khaotik	webtoe	hey i appreciate your time you gave me
2008-03-30T08:10:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	not a problem
2008-03-30T08:12:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	what help do you want... my gf is training to be a midwife,... :P
2008-03-30T08:14:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	no but just googled it. Seems like a purely ethical choice to me
2008-03-30T08:16:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	probably because they didn't include th proper gnome .desktop files in the package? should start fine from the terminal
2008-03-30T08:17:00.000Z	webtoe	khaotik	yes you can. don't know how
