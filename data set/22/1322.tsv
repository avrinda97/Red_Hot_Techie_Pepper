2010-06-27T16:55:00.000Z	RealBadApple		can anyone help me figure out how to get my new vaio vpcee23fx to recognize the alps touchpad so I can ditch this shitty microsoft mouse I am using?
2010-06-27T16:56:00.000Z	RealBadApple		anyone?
2010-06-27T16:56:00.000Z	RealBadApple		HELP! sony vaio touchpad is not recognized with 10.04
2010-06-27T16:57:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	Take it easy. Your system is probably configured to support a Synaptics touchpad.
2010-06-27T16:58:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	What does "cat /proc/bus/input/devices" output?
2010-06-27T16:58:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	give me a second and I get it
2010-06-27T17:02:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	here is the output "http://pastebin.com/j3qcKHdM"
2010-06-27T17:07:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	Hard to tell, but try this out: gconftool -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/touchpad_enabled true
2010-06-27T17:08:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	I'll give that a try and be back in a minute
2010-06-27T17:13:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	that did not work
2010-06-27T17:15:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	What kernel are you running?
2010-06-27T17:16:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	2.6.32-22
2010-06-27T17:17:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9329402&postcount=3 was the best I could find. So try updating the kernel to 2.6.34
2010-06-27T17:17:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	That is regarding the scroll whell, of course, but it might help.
2010-06-27T17:18:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	I am not sure if it matters but I am running the 64bit ubuntu
2010-06-27T17:19:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	Are you sure that it's not turned off through some hardware setting? For instance FN+F9?
2010-06-27T17:20:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	I don't have a hardware shut off in the form of a fn combo
2010-06-27T17:22:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	Have you checked this out: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingTouchpadDetection
2010-06-27T17:24:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/known-ubuntu-10-04lucid-lynx-issuesbugs-with-workarounds.html check number 5
2010-06-27T17:24:00.000Z	mei	RealBadApple	Not that you have the same problem, but similar.
2010-06-27T17:35:00.000Z	RealBadApple	mei	thanks for your help but nothing is working so far!
