2012-09-13T02:36:00.000Z	Adie		hi
2012-09-13T02:36:00.000Z	Adie		I accidently sudo chmod -R adie:adie /
2012-09-13T02:36:00.000Z	Adie		:(
2012-09-13T02:36:00.000Z	TML	Adie	LOL
2012-09-13T02:37:00.000Z	TML	Adie	I laugh because I did it once myself - 20 years ago, on a SunOS box.
2012-09-13T02:37:00.000Z	Adie		:D
2012-09-13T02:37:00.000Z	Adie		I was told to try to take ownership of my home folder to try to fix my logging in problem
2012-09-13T02:38:00.000Z	Adie		I did it wromg, lol
2012-09-13T02:38:00.000Z	TML	Adie	AFAIK, the only solution to that problem is "recover from most recent backup"
2012-09-13T02:38:00.000Z	Adie	TML	not even a big deal right now
2012-09-13T02:39:00.000Z	Adie		ubuntu is like a really hard game to me. I keep trying over and over, and each time I get further
2012-09-13T02:39:00.000Z	Adie		but I keep dying and have to restart the level
2012-09-13T02:39:00.000Z	Adie		I haven't lasted 3 days yet -.-
2012-09-13T02:40:00.000Z	Adie		I think MOST of my issues relate to my gpu >:U
2012-09-13T02:40:00.000Z	Adie		I keep trying to make my gpu work right, and I keep breaking the whole OS
2012-09-13T02:40:00.000Z	TML	Adie	I have a solution to that one for you
2012-09-13T02:40:00.000Z	TML		Stop installing X
2012-09-13T02:40:00.000Z	Adie		:(
2012-09-13T02:40:00.000Z	Adie		I like X
2012-09-13T02:41:00.000Z	TML		Ah. Well, probably not your favorite suggestion, then :)
2012-09-13T02:41:00.000Z	TML	Adie	I've been using *nix without X for almost 25 years - it's great
