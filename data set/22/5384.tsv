2007-08-11T13:38:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	its true though, ive had bad experience with amorak on gnome :/
2007-08-11T13:36:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	theres a DAAP plugin
2007-08-11T13:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	horsehockey, it works fine with Gnome.
2007-08-11T13:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	?.. thats not a problem, all you have to do is remove it from the tray, just like 90% of the apps on Windows and several on Gnome/KDE.
2007-08-11T13:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	then thats fine, but don't say its crap for that reason, it just apparently isn't for you.. but its probably the best media program out there
2007-08-11T13:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	then you've done something wrong .., i've always used it with gnome, never a problem...
2007-08-11T13:39:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	IMO anyway, its also feature bloated :(
2007-08-11T13:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	well, you're opinion is losing face pretty quickly with me, as everythign you say is pretty much based on your personal experience, and overall, its completely false.
2008-06-15T04:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	i agree w/ that.. i never upgrade, but if he's gonna upgrade, going from 6.06 to 8.04 will be easiest
2009-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	not w/ gnome(unless you use compiz)... but w/ KDE it can work
2009-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	i am using compiz :D
2009-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	its an option in there somewhere...i don't use compiz, so not sure where
2009-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	well theres a wallpaper option, but it wont let you auto-rotate after a period of time
2009-05-17T06:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	ok... there was a program in the repositories that i installed (I think in 7.04) that did that
2009-05-17T06:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	i knew there was one.. just couldn't remember what it was called. .. not sure how good iti s nowdays htough
2009-05-17T06:29:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	drapes doesnt do what i need it to do, it won't work with compiz and separate workplaces
2009-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	oh ok, gotcha
2009-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	i'm currently using wallpaper-tray which works nicely, but is a little buggy, and won't have different wallpapers for separate work places
2009-05-17T06:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	ok.. wallpaper try was my next suggestion, but you're right about the different wallpapers
2009-05-17T06:32:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	well, its not a HUGE concern... it'd just be nice if there was a visual cue to inform me when i change workplaces :D
2009-05-17T06:32:00.000Z	m0u5e	IndyGunFreak	i really like the new workplace switch feeling, where the windows switch rather than the wallpaper... but its hard to tell when I switch now :(
2009-05-17T06:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	m0u5e	yeah, i been there myself.
