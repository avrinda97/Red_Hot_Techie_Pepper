2010-01-07T01:30:00.000Z	roof	guntbert	is the gnome manger the best one to use for wireless?
2010-01-07T01:31:00.000Z	guntbert	roof	well - I use the nm-applet - but I guess you jumped to conclusions - I hope you can recover
2010-01-07T01:33:00.000Z	roof	guntbert	ah a breakthrough, since install wicd, it appears that when the card is inactive, it effectively decides to sleep, as the connect button comes up and it appears disconnected
2010-01-07T01:34:00.000Z	guntbert	roof	don't know if thats good or bad :-)
2010-01-07T01:35:00.000Z	roof	guntbert	i am successfully sending packets to the AP but the wifi is showing as disconnecting all the time

2010-01-07T01:38:00.000Z	roof	guntbert	now it can ping C, yet A cant ping C on the same segment, lol
2010-01-07T01:39:00.000Z	guntbert	roof	my concentration is weakening - please ask the channel again
2010-01-07T01:48:00.000Z	roof	guntbert	why are drivers not subject to GPL rules?
