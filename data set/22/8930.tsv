2005-05-02T08:05:00.000Z	geargolem		What would happen if I changed my kernel from xserver to xfree86
2005-05-02T08:05:00.000Z	geargolem		?
2005-05-02T08:06:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	I don't understand your question.
2005-05-02T08:07:00.000Z	geargolem	frank_	xfree86 supports the SIS driver, xserver does not
2005-05-02T08:08:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	you mean xorg does not?
2005-05-02T08:10:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	SIS integrated graphics you mean? Youre sure xorg doesnt support it?
2005-05-02T08:11:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	I just found that xorg supports sis so there is a way
2005-05-02T08:12:00.000Z	geargolem	frank_	 how?  I'ved tried everything
2005-05-02T08:13:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	I don't know exactly how but what does not work now? video acceleration? or nothing works at all?
2005-05-02T08:15:00.000Z	geargolem	frank_	 glxgears does not, blender...
2005-05-02T08:18:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	install xbase-clients package
2005-05-02T08:19:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	never mind you probably have it already
2005-05-02T08:21:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	open /etc/X11/xorg.conf   to check if xorg is using the sis driver
2005-05-02T08:22:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	what error message do you get while running glxgears?
2005-05-02T08:24:00.000Z	geargolem	frank_	 I get xlib:  "GLX" missing on display : 0  0
2005-05-02T08:25:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	Section "Module"  is Load "glx" there?
2005-05-02T08:25:00.000Z	geargolem	frank_	yes it is
2005-05-02T08:26:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	I really don't know much about this. I don't know what to do
2005-05-02T08:27:00.000Z	geargolem	frank_	how do you comment out something on xorg.config?
2005-05-02T08:28:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	with a #
2005-05-02T08:30:00.000Z	frank_	geargolem	before the line starts. Look at the top of the file
