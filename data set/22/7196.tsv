2006-05-24T05:26:00.000Z	jonuk		I'm on Windows right now.  I have a 40GB hard drive that is completely taken by Windows.  I have a 250GB hard drive with nothing on it that I want to make a small partition on and install Ubuntu 5.10.  When I start the installation, it gets to the "Starting Partitioner" stage and loads to 100% and then the screen goes blank.  If I hit Ctrl+C, it starts loading again and hangs at 52% everytime.  Any suggestions?

2006-05-24T05:26:00.000Z	jonuk	unfo	no, just 2 hard drives on 1 computer
