2008-05-06T08:41:00.000Z	martman		what happen to the screen configuration util in 8.04?
2008-05-06T08:41:00.000Z	martman		i dont see it
2008-05-06T08:42:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 I think it's hidden by default, you can re-enable it by editing the menu
2008-05-06T08:43:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 nm, it's the "screen resolution" program now
2008-05-06T08:44:00.000Z	martman	JohnPhys	that doesnt let you set up monitor settings or anything
2008-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 It should let you decide if you clone output or not, set resolutions and refresh rates and rotation of displays.  What exactly are you looking for?
2008-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	martman	JohnPhys	i cant have a resolution higher than 800x600
2008-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	martman	JohnPhys	i used to be ble to use that tool to say i have a big crt display, then it would let me pick higher ones
2008-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 I'm guessing you tried the "detect displays" button in there already?
2008-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 do you use nvidia?
2008-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	martman	JohnPhys	ati
2008-05-06T08:49:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 I think the tool you're looking for is now under "other" in the applications menu, but hidden.  Try re-enabling it
2008-05-06T08:50:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 and I'm seriously not going to help you again if you keep ranting, not cool.
2008-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 I think the tool was fine if you only used free drivers, but with the nvidia non-free drivers, it was awful
2008-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 I'm actually glad they hid it, it was awful with nvidia graphics, and didn't indicate taht it was until it messed up the xorg pretty badly.
2008-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	martman	JohnPhys	have to use there tool for everything?
2008-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	JohnPhys	martman	 I don't understand your question.
2008-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	martman	JohnPhys	is the program just that bad when you have a nvidia card, or does nvidia somehow force use to use there config tool thingy?
2008-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	martman	JohnPhys	i have mostly atis but never had a problem with it actualy...
