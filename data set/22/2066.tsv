2009-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	I'd wait until your distro releases a package for 3.7.
2009-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	Linuxteacher	torn	Well, i love to beta test everything :P
2009-10-07T08:40:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	here's the source code for Linux: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/
2009-10-07T08:40:00.000Z	Linuxteacher	torn	I am on the site
2009-10-07T08:41:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	you tried using Brasero?
2009-10-07T08:42:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	on different .iso files?
2009-10-07T08:42:00.000Z	Linuxteacher	torn	Yes. I tried GParted.iso a while back. And lately Fedora 11 iso. Both failed
2009-10-07T08:44:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	what error do you get when it fails?
2009-10-07T08:45:00.000Z	Linuxteacher	torn	I get the following Error: "Can not burn with current set of plugins. Please insert a supported CD."
2009-10-07T08:45:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	this is with Brasero?
2009-10-07T08:45:00.000Z	Linuxteacher	torn	Yes. Gnomebaker gives me no error, just said "Failed"
2009-10-07T08:46:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	and using this same CD/DVD drive, and the same .iso files, with the same brand discs, it works under Windows when you burn them?
2009-10-07T08:46:00.000Z	Linuxteacher	torn	Yep.
2009-10-07T08:48:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	that is really bizzare.
2009-10-07T08:48:00.000Z	Linuxteacher	torn	I know right? haha. It is verrrry. But ah well. Firefox 3.7 is compiled by mozilla through their PPA: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ppa
2009-10-07T08:50:00.000Z	torn	Linuxteacher	have fun crashing your system with 3.7! Hehe.
