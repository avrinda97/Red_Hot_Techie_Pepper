2010-09-20T22:03:00.000Z	somutpop		hi all!
2010-09-20T22:04:00.000Z	somutpop		sudo ./UBUNTUCLEANER.SH this code works from termianl. but when i make a launcher by slecting "application terminal" the same code is not working. can someone help me please ?
2010-09-20T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 make the launcher run somthing like 'gksudo xterm -e /path/to/cleaner.sh' perhaps...
2010-09-20T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 unless it has a gui. :)  then ya dont need the xterm -e bit,.. but you proberly want the full path
2010-09-20T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 try full path to the script..
2010-09-20T22:07:00.000Z	somutpop	Dr_Willis	'gksudo xterm -e /path/to/cleaner.sh' is not working. the script doen not have any gui.
2010-09-20T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 theres some option to xterm to make it launch a terminal with a command. it may not be -e
2010-09-20T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 you did uyse the actual path? and the proper name for the script?

2010-09-20T22:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 you have to quote the command to pass to gksudo.. ie: ---->     gksudo 'xterm -e 'watch free''
2010-09-20T22:11:00.000Z	somutpop	Dr_Willis	can you please tell me me how to add a launcher for this script ?
2010-09-20T22:11:00.000Z	somutpop	Dr_Willis	you write me something that i can not understand :)
2010-09-20T22:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	   right click on the desktop, add launcher, and tell it the command to run
2010-09-20T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 you may not want to be using such scripts if you dont understand the basics.
2010-09-20T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 so replace 'watch free' what  '/path/to/whatever/your/scrptis.sh'
2010-09-20T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 an example...
2010-09-20T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 try it and see..
2010-09-20T22:13:00.000Z	somutpop	Dr_Willis	gksudo xterm ./UBUNTUCLEANER.SH or gksudo xterm -e ./UBUNTUCLEANER.SH is not working.
2010-09-20T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 you MUST quote the things.. thats the whole trick.
2010-09-20T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	 and use the full path...
2010-09-20T22:14:00.000Z	somutpop	Dr_Willis	it worked. thank you so much :) !
2010-09-20T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	somutpop	  learning how quotes work = somthing worth readign up on :)
