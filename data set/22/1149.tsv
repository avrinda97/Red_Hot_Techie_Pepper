2010-09-27T16:42:00.000Z	Propel		I'm wondering if anyone uses STEAM on ubuntu
2010-09-27T16:42:00.000Z	Propel		and how the gameplay is
2010-09-27T16:43:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	I use it with Crossover Games and it works very good.
2010-09-27T16:47:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	I use Crossover, which is based on Wine. I currently play Counter-strike Source now and then. Been meaning to try Team Fortress 2 also, since I played that a while back on windows.
2010-09-27T16:49:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	please mention my nick it you are talking to me. Yes, the gameplay is good.
2010-09-27T16:49:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	Crossover has a free trial you can try. You can also use Wine yourself but there's no guarantee it will work as well.
2010-09-27T16:50:00.000Z	Propel	maedox	yeah, i heard wine wasn't very good emulating steam.
2010-09-27T16:50:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	Crossover has tweaked it a lot so it plays nice with Ubuntu.
2010-09-27T16:50:00.000Z	Propel	maedox	is it almost like you're playing on Windows, it's that good on Crossover?
2010-09-27T16:50:00.000Z	Propel	maedox	like 100fps?
2010-09-27T16:51:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	I guess it depends on your setup, but I believe it is very close.
2010-09-27T16:51:00.000Z	Propel	maedox	what are your computer specs?
2010-09-27T16:51:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	Core i7 930, 6 GB RAM, old 8800 GTS gfxcard.
2010-09-27T16:52:00.000Z	Propel	maedox	I have core2Quad, 3GBs RAM and 8600GT
2010-09-27T16:52:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	been meaning to get a new gfxcard also but I play more and more on PS3 instead.
2010-09-27T16:52:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	that should work very well.
2010-09-27T16:53:00.000Z	Propel	maedox	is there a way to get Crossover (non trial) for free?
2010-09-27T16:55:00.000Z	maedox	Propel	I don't think so. I got a 50 % discount in my email inbox after signing up for the trial. You should try that and just wait until the trial is over. A representative or auto-email might be sent giving you a discount. Or else you can send a nice email to them asking for a student discount or something like that.
2010-09-27T17:53:00.000Z	Propel	maedox	what version of CrossOver linux do you use?
