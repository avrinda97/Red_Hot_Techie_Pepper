2006-07-19T11:11:00.000Z	Bonez		i have a fat32 partition mounted but i can not read/write to it from within nautilus, but i can read/write from a terminal. anyone know how to fix?
2006-07-19T11:12:00.000Z	Bonez		/dev/hda6      /media/d    vfat  codepage=850,iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0 0 0
2006-07-19T11:14:00.000Z	Bonez		ok cool :)
2006-07-19T11:14:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	if you can do something in terminal but not in the GUI, then the problem cannot be with the mounting.  Unless, of course, you are mistaken about being able to do it in terminal :-)
2006-07-19T11:15:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	yes that is what i was trying to explain to n3rdism :)
2006-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	the partition is mounted ok, but i just can't write to it from within a gui
2006-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	and it's weird, because i have another fat32 partition which works fine! (read&write in GUI)
2006-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	are you sure you're accessing the same thing in Nautilus as you are in terminal?  Perhaps one is a symlink to something while the other isn't. or perhaps they're completely different things?  GUIs can be confusing.
2006-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	100% sure... it's mounted in /media/d
2006-07-19T11:16:00.000Z	Bonez		i can rm files or nano files in /media/d
2006-07-19T11:17:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	another thing to keep in mind is how nautilus decides to display things
2006-07-19T11:17:00.000Z	Bonez		but if I try to do it through nautilus or thuner i get no write access
2006-07-19T11:17:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	when I open /media/d in nautilus i get a screen full of padlocks :(
2006-07-19T11:18:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	gnome-conf contains some settings (which I don't fully understand yet) which tell it when to display an icon for a mounted filesystem and when not.  These are *magic* icons that appear not because the corresponding objects are in the directory being viewed but because the config says Nautilus should display them.  Perhaps the malfunction is with the config of those things?
2006-07-19T11:19:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	not too sure, however even when I run nautlius or thunar as sudo, I still can not write to the partition, and it tells me in the permissions that I am the owner of the files... go figure? :P
2006-07-19T11:20:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	another possibility is that Nautilus is somehow not up to date with teh state of your filesystems.  Try shuttting down X and restarting it.
2006-07-19T11:20:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	been there, done that :( the only other thing i have had suggested to me is to boot into windows and run a chkdsk
2006-07-19T11:21:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	chkdsk is a good housekeeping plan.  But it wouldn't explain this behaviour.  Nautilus shouldn't really know anything about filesystem corruption.
2006-07-19T11:22:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	yes this is a good point. I am thinking of moving all data over to another drive and reformatting it as ext3 anyway, so maybe i'll just take the easy way out and do that? :)
2006-07-19T11:23:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	spend some time in gconf-editor looking at settings that affect Nautilus.  See if you can make some sense of them.  The GNOME documentation might help, though I haven't read much of it and cannot affirm it will
2006-07-19T11:23:00.000Z	Bonez	ic56	thanks for your help!
2006-07-19T11:24:00.000Z	ic56	Bonez	yw and good luck!
