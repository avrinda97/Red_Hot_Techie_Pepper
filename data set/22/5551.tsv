2007-08-24T07:05:00.000Z	ceil420		what's the lspci-type command to show hard drives? :x
2007-08-24T07:07:00.000Z	ceil420		that doesn't show me anything
2007-08-24T07:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	That was for you
2007-08-24T07:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	Sudo
2007-08-24T07:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	That should give you a full listing of drives and partitions
2007-08-24T07:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	Are you getting an error
2007-08-24T07:08:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	it doesn't say like "Western Digital" or anything tho
2007-08-24T07:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	Does it show partition and drive info
2007-08-24T07:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	Thats what it does. You want it to show make and model?
2007-08-24T07:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	That requires a different tool... Look at Hirens cd and see if it has a diagnostic on it that will do what you need.  It has all of those sorts of tools.
2007-08-24T07:11:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	cheers
2008-03-07T01:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	Did you add a Debian repo to your sources for something you wanted to load?
2008-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	oh?
2008-09-19T03:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	yes
2008-09-19T03:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	mostly the mobile chipset
2009-02-05T05:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	That is why we discourage people taking polls or asking best
2009-02-05T05:26:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	but it's factual, in this case
2009-02-05T05:26:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	notice i didn't compare irssi to xchat, or any other actively maintained IRC client
2009-02-05T05:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ceil420	Please stop
2009-02-05T05:28:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	you please stop
2009-02-05T05:29:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	i'm just warning people that are considering using telnet for IRC what they're in for
2009-02-05T05:29:00.000Z	ceil420	Jack_Sparrow	which is on topic, as at least one user mentioned using it while another is actively seeking an IRC client
