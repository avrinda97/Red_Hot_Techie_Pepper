2011-06-03T19:19:00.000Z	Malgorath		BOOTMGR is missing... somehow i guess installing ubutnu wiped out my bootmgr for windows
2011-06-03T19:20:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	what?  Lemme look that up.  (grub is a your bootMGR now).
2011-06-03T19:20:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	What exactly happened?  Did you see a menu at all?
2011-06-03T19:21:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	What is on the menu?
2011-06-03T19:21:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	And then you got that error?
2011-06-03T19:22:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	Ok great.  So the menu has our new entry in it. That means grub is definitely running.  This is 11.04 ?
2011-06-03T19:27:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	Boot off from Windows 7 DVD and select Repair your computer.  Select your Windows installation directory and click Next.  Choose the Command Prompt option and use the following command to fix the problem: bootrec /fixboot
2011-06-03T19:27:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	Tell me what happens along the way please :)
2011-06-03T19:28:00.000Z	Malgorath	edbian	k 1 sec
2011-06-03T19:28:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	I believe that bootMGR is a file on the windows 7 install.  NOT In the MBR (not sure about that though)
2011-06-03T19:30:00.000Z	Malgorath	edbian	i was digging  a bit looks like I have to rebuild that partition(100mb) some how cause its like te /root now for windows
2011-06-03T19:31:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	It's like te /root   ?
2011-06-03T19:32:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	In linux /root is root's home folder.  I think you mean it's like /   (the system root directory).  Did my instructions help ?
2011-06-03T19:33:00.000Z	Malgorath	edbian	the 100m partition in windows is not the /boot for windows, without it there is no way to boot windows and I found a site that talks about your instructions but there is some partition stuff that has to be rebuilt first it says(M$ website)
2011-06-03T19:33:00.000Z	Malgorath	edbian	er is now the /boot for windows
2011-06-03T19:34:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	Ahh, did you ever have a /boot partition or something?  Where did it go if it was just a folder in windows?  (this explains why grub doesn't find it)
2011-06-03T19:34:00.000Z	Malgorath	edbian	honestly I didn't really examine the parts of /dev/sda since I knew ubuntu was going on /dev/sdb and windows was working fine
2011-06-03T19:35:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	sure
2011-06-03T19:42:00.000Z	Malgorath	edbian	if I figure this out I think I might post something about it somewhere as I can see this being a more common problem
2011-06-03T19:43:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	sure.  I'm more interested in what caused windows 7 to go from bootable to unbootable
2011-06-03T19:55:00.000Z	Malgorath	edbian	i think i might have to fully reinstall windows
2011-06-03T19:55:00.000Z	edbian	Malgorath	ouch
