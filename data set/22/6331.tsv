2007-07-17T13:20:00.000Z	FusE		There was an error when I installed it, and maybe thats why I have no network
2007-07-17T13:21:00.000Z	FusE		Not particularly

2007-07-17T13:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	FusE	See if your card works from a Feisty LiveCD

2007-07-17T13:28:00.000Z	FusE		thanks
2007-07-17T13:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	FusE	np
2007-07-17T13:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	FusE	If the card works from the LiveCD then you know it is an upgrade problem, if it doesn't then it is a problem with Feisty itself
