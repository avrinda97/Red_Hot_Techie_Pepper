2006-10-28T12:40:00.000Z	Seb		volumeid can't be installed on my edgy because of /sbin/vol_id that's also in udev, how do I fix this ?
2006-10-28T12:40:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	fresh install or upgrade?
2006-10-28T12:40:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	do a complete reinstallation
2006-10-28T12:41:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	excuse me ?
2006-10-28T12:41:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	the upgrade is breaking stuff..it's easier to just do a complete fresh install
2006-10-28T12:41:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	it certainly is *not* an option here
2006-10-28T12:42:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	dunno what to tell you then
2006-10-28T12:42:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	hrm, "the upgrade breaks stuff, so reinstall" is very... shall I say... "windowish" ! THere has to be another solution.
2006-10-28T12:43:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	nope
2006-10-28T12:43:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	i am an old debianer..used it for about 5 years..and i still say your best shot is to reinstall
2006-10-28T12:43:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	look, those 2 packages conflict, this is gonna get fixed at some point most likely
2006-10-28T12:44:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	possibly..you really want to wait for that?
2006-10-28T12:44:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	shit, been using debian for 10 years, and am a DD, so I just won't reinstall my system because some maintainer botched some packages !
2006-10-28T12:44:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	lol cool
2006-10-28T12:44:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	in any case, how would reinstalling fix anything, I mean /sbin/volume_id is still gonna be a conflict, right ?
2006-10-28T12:44:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	no i don't think so
2006-10-28T12:45:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	how not ?
2006-10-28T12:45:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	no one else has had that issue yet
2006-10-28T12:45:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	i'm not sure though how no one else is seeing that :\
2006-10-28T12:52:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	there, manually removed the old udev that caused problem. It took a bunch of packages with it on the way out, but I can now reinstall them.
2006-10-28T12:52:00.000Z	bluefox83	Seb	congrats, that's the good ol debian spirit :D
2006-10-28T12:53:00.000Z	Seb	bluefox83	heh
