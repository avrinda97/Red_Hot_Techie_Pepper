2005-07-25T06:03:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		if I had a mac i'd put osx on it
2005-07-25T06:04:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		not bagging on linux or anything cmon its a custom build of freebsd just for macs
2005-07-25T06:05:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		why?
2005-07-25T06:05:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		I just dont understand the choice, it seems like a waste of good hardware
2005-07-25T06:05:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		macs are made for graphics and audio
2005-07-25T06:05:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	Try running Tiger on a G4 1GHz and you'll understand.
2005-07-25T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	it's certainly pretty and polished, but fast it is not.
2005-07-25T06:07:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	And with Ubuntu (or linux in general) you get a nicer choice of free apps.
2005-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	Not if the scheduler isn't broken.
2005-08-30T13:18:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	cafuego	cpu1 aint gonna get used if the prog aint written for smp
2005-08-30T13:18:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	no, the kernel decides and can move them; soemtimes it's more cost effective to not move and and slightly overuse one of the cpus though.
2005-08-30T13:18:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	well duh.
2005-08-30T13:19:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	That doesn't mean prog1 can't run on cpu0 whilst the kernel runs on cpu1
2005-08-30T13:19:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	Seeing as even an idle linux box tends to run at least 20-odd processes and/or kernel threads, SMP makes sense.
2005-08-30T13:20:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	The kernel already does this kind of scheduling. it can move kernel threads between cpus etc.
2005-08-30T13:20:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	if you enable SMP mode in top, you can see which CPU processes are running on.
2005-08-30T13:20:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	cafuego	well mine tends to keep pretty much everything on cpu0 - it still uses cpu1 but not as much
2005-08-30T13:21:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	if it runs ALL idle threads on cpu0 and ONE active one on cpu1, it's STILL redistributed the work optimally.
2005-08-30T13:23:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	I'm fairly sure the 2.6 kernels can (or are patchable to) set CPU affinity on a per-process basis, if you think you're smarter then the scheduler.
2005-09-15T11:16:00.000Z	cafuego	ColonelKernel	october 13.
2005-10-19T10:33:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	cafuego	right on\
2005-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	cafuego	will you please send me some money?
