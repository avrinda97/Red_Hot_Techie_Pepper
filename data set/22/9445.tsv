2004-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	seb128	Matt|	please open a bug with the version of gst, gst-plugins, rb, a problematic file, the exact error and the output of rhythmbox -d
2004-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	Matt|	seb128	i'm thinking its more me being rubbish
2004-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	Matt|	seb128	but if I can't fix it I will file
2004-12-12T12:22:00.000Z	Matt|	seb128	resolved. I had gstreamer not gstreamer0.8
2004-12-12T12:22:00.000Z	seb128	Matt|	how did you that ? rhythmbox depends on gstreamer0.8
2004-12-12T12:23:00.000Z	Matt|	seb128	i mean gstreamer0.8-plugins
