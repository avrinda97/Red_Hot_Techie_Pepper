2008-11-18T19:44:00.000Z	SOURdiesel		do i need to uninstall the 32 bit flash player and then download/install the 64bit flash player?  or do i just install the 64bit flash player?
2008-11-18T19:44:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	I recommend you carry on with a working 32bit install unless you are %100 certain what your doing
2008-11-18T19:45:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	aye-aye, sir.  thank you.
2008-11-18T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	honestly - unless your %100 certain your for a world of pain
2008-11-18T19:46:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	not into pain here.
2008-11-18T19:51:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	it's stable now
2008-11-18T19:51:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	ok. less bugy...
2008-11-18T19:52:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	depends on what your doing and the user as to how buggy it is, my 8.10 install has one bug, with an easy work around, and another one is %100 stable
2008-11-18T19:53:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	i tried upgrading and had issues with my onboard video and power management.  the person who reffered me to ubuntu tried to upgrade and had archive manager issues along with network issues.  that's why i asked.
2008-11-18T19:54:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	as I said, dependso n the user as much as the OS
2008-11-18T19:54:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	ok then.
2008-11-18T20:00:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	when i try again should i upgrade or clean install 8.10?
2008-11-18T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	up to you
2008-11-18T20:01:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	i heard clean install worked better.  but then again like you say, user.
2008-11-18T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	I'd rather see a clean install, but thats not practical for everyone
2008-11-18T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	thats only a personal opinion though
2008-11-18T20:01:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	cool.
2008-11-21T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	run a chkdisk first, make suer it's not mounted also
2008-11-21T20:54:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	 how do i chkdisk?
2008-11-21T20:54:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	boot into windows
2008-11-21T20:55:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	ikonia	i have no idea what you mean but thanks.
2008-11-21T20:55:00.000Z	ikonia	SOURdiesel	you boot into windows and run chkdisk against that disk
