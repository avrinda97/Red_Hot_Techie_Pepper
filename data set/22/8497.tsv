2010-04-05T12:26:00.000Z	CQ		rags nils@blackbox:~/installation$ sudo modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp
2010-04-05T12:28:00.000Z	CQ		rags yup ... do I need more rules though? http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-do-i-use-iptables-connection-tracking-feature.html seems to say that to use all teh FTP features in a NAT you need more than just teh one forwarding rule to get the related passive connections etc.
2010-04-05T12:30:00.000Z	CQ		ab should be OK... does it give you an error or is the file empty? What does it do with one > ? else try | cat - >> /tmp/file
2010-04-05T12:31:00.000Z	ab	CQ	empty.
2010-04-05T12:31:00.000Z	CQ		what does it output without the >> ?
2010-04-05T12:31:00.000Z	CQ		franklin #ubuntu-es
2010-04-05T12:31:00.000Z	ab	CQ	same with single >.  i'll try cat - .
2010-04-05T12:32:00.000Z	CQ		ab does it give you any output at all without piping at all?
2010-04-05T12:33:00.000Z	CQ	cdoublejj	no. worst case you end up with a command line and have to use that to reinstall a WM
2010-04-05T12:34:00.000Z	ab	CQ	just tried cat - .  nothing.  it does give output to stdout.  but redirecting to a file is not happening.
2010-04-05T12:34:00.000Z	CQ		ab does it give the output to stdout when you add the pipe? if so, it's outputting to STDERR not STDOUT
2010-04-05T12:35:00.000Z	CQ		ab else remove teh file, or check it has 660 privileges etc.
2010-04-05T12:37:00.000Z	ab	CQ	no output when piped through cat - .  the tcpdump manpage says -w - writes to stdout.  and i believe it does.  the perms on the file are good.  there is somehting else going on.
2010-04-05T12:38:00.000Z	CQ		ab make the privs 777 or try sudo
2010-04-05T12:39:00.000Z	CQ		ab or try it wirh tee (man tee)
2010-04-05T12:39:00.000Z	ab	CQ	tried both.  no change.
2010-04-05T12:40:00.000Z	CQ		ab does echo test >> /tmp/file work then?
2010-04-05T12:40:00.000Z	CQ		ab then try echo test | tee /tmp/file
2010-04-05T12:41:00.000Z	ab	CQ	tried | tee -a /tmp/file.  nothing.
2010-04-05T12:41:00.000Z	ab	CQ	the file is writable.
2010-04-05T12:42:00.000Z	CQ		ab sorry, I can't help more than that... only other thing I can think of is that it's buffered before flushing to the file or something if you see output without the pipe and not with and nothing in the file, but even then after a while something should be in the file
2010-04-05T12:44:00.000Z	ab	CQ	yep.  i thougt about buffering but the -l switch is supposed to address that.  i think it's maybe the lack of an EOF.  the stdout never gets closed.
