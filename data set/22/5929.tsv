2009-12-30T02:25:00.000Z	xover		guys. how do i umount a device in use or busy?
2009-12-30T02:25:00.000Z	xover		I have used lsof and fuser and removed the processes, but its still not umounting
2009-12-30T02:26:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	figure out what's using it and stop that process. you can use lsof to find the guilty process(es)
2009-12-30T02:26:00.000Z	xover	mister_roboto	I have already done that
2009-12-30T02:26:00.000Z	xover		jochar, how can i find the offending process?
2009-12-30T02:27:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	you must not have stopped it if it's still busy
2009-12-30T02:27:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	i already told you.  lsof
2009-12-30T02:27:00.000Z	xover		I have lsof -i and fuser -m return nothing now
2009-12-30T02:27:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	sudo lsof |grep <busy dir/fd/whatever>
2009-12-30T02:27:00.000Z	xover		your one dumb cont do you know that
2009-12-30T02:27:00.000Z	xover		you dont listen
2009-12-30T02:28:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	actually you said nothing of the sort until just now
2009-12-30T02:28:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	what is the busy device and why do you think -i is relevant?
2009-12-30T02:32:00.000Z	xover		I told you that lsof and fuser now return nothing
2009-12-30T02:32:00.000Z	xover		lsof -i lists sockets, so that I can see if a network connection is using the file
2009-12-30T02:33:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	that's clearly wrong since they ALWAYS return something
2009-12-30T02:33:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	did you run it as root?  as in sudo?  you never said
2009-12-30T02:33:00.000Z	xover	mister_roboto	OK when I grep after piping
2009-12-30T02:34:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	what exactly are you typing in?  should be "sudo lsof |grep -i <device/dir/filename/whatever>"
2009-12-30T02:34:00.000Z	xover		dont worry dude, cheers anyway.
2009-12-30T02:34:00.000Z	xover		yeah mate, typing that
2009-12-30T02:35:00.000Z	mister_roboto	xover	you're being too vague
