2008-07-27T12:08:00.000Z	ffiarpg		I am currently trying to get my Tablet PC functions working properly in Linux to take notes in college. I use a Gateway E-295C (C-140x) Tablet PC and I am currently running Ubuntu 8.04. I have tried a few things from several tutorials on line without any luck. If anyone has any experience with this I would greatly appreciate it as it is the only reason I still require Vista.
2008-07-27T12:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	I run linux successfully on my tablet; I had to mess with xorg.conf a while to do it though.
2008-07-27T12:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	Do you have any experience\familiarity with the xorg.conf file?
2008-07-27T12:10:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	I have tried adding a few entries, Input Devices, and a few things to the server layout section as well
2008-07-27T12:11:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	This is the xorg.conf file that works for me... I think you only care about the stuff after DRI mode 0666. Let me know if you need some more help. http://arrenlex.ls.la/xorg.conf
2008-07-27T12:11:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	one guide suggested i add one for stylus, eraser, and one other that i forget atm, another guide says that 8.04 only requires the stylus entry, one guide says that the device is /dev/input/wacom, another says it is dev/SS04 or something, i can check bookmarks if need be.
2008-07-27T12:11:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	ill give that a quick look thanks for uploading it
2008-07-27T12:12:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	Actually that page doesn't load for me, does it load for you?
2008-07-27T12:12:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	it doesnt :P

2008-07-27T12:12:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	what brand of tablet pc do you use? does it use a wacom Penabled pen? Did you have to install wacom-tools
2008-07-27T12:13:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	It's a toshiba r20. Yes, the pen is wacom. I had to install\upgrade wacom-tools to get pen rotation working.
2008-07-27T12:13:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	did you have to install or update anything to get simple cursor movement working or only xorg.conf editing?
2008-07-27T12:14:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	It was a while ago but I think it was only xorg.conf.
2008-07-27T12:16:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	im sorry i dont remember what i did, but i was somehow able to type something in the terminal to see coordinates updated instantly of what my tablet pen was doing, it did not work when i said the pen was "/detv/ttyS0" and yet it did when i said it was "/dev/input/wacom".
2008-07-27T12:17:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	do you have any idea what i am talking about from such a poor description? and if so, does that sound normal? i thought it might be useful in troubleshooting my problems
2008-07-27T12:18:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	Depends how your tablet is hooked up internally. Mine's over serial so ttyS0 is the right one for me, and that's what's in xorg.conf. I suggest trying both ways. I have never seen /dev/input/wacom before but that doesn't mean anything, there's a lot of things I haven't seen before.
2008-07-27T12:21:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	what do the lines "Section "DRI"         Mode    0666 EndSection" do?
2008-07-27T12:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	I don't know, actually. DRI is the direct rendering infrastructure, i.e. it's the magical layer that lets graphics be accelerated by the graphics card and not drawn in slow software. Mode 666 looks like a permissions mask but I don't know what one would be doing here... as a permissions it means read\write but no execute to everyone.
2008-07-27T12:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	Google I guess.
2008-07-27T12:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	ffiarpg	In any case, it's definitely not tablet related, it's 3d accel related.
2008-07-27T12:24:00.000Z	ffiarpg	arrenlex	alright thanks, ill go ahead and leave that out then as my dedicated ati graphics are working perfectly, thanks again for uploading your xorg.conf file
