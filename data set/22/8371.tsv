2007-07-20T08:48:00.000Z	ethan		hey.
2007-07-20T08:49:00.000Z	ethan		I'm having trouble getting the downloaded nvidia driver (from nvidia.org) working.  I keep getting an API missmatch error when starting X (nvidia driver version doesn't match Xorg kernel version).  I've tried the 100.14 drivers and the 9639 drivers, I get the api missmatch error with each.  (The xorg kernel module compiles fine!)  What do you think ;] ?
2007-07-20T08:50:00.000Z	mneptok	ethan	don't download binary drivers, install them from the repos.
2007-07-20T08:50:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	those aren't working.
2007-07-20T08:50:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	they are but I'm getting hard lockups every 20 seconds or so with nvidia-glx-new at least, and nvida-glx gives the api missmatch error as well.
2007-07-20T08:50:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	the repo drivers normally work, but after they added nvidia-glx-new, it doesn't work well.
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	mneptok	ethan	what release of Ubuntu?
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	feisty.
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	mneptok	ethan	nVidia grfx chipset/card?
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	nvidia 6200 agp
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	mneptok	ethan	that's Brand F-ing New(tm), yes?
2007-07-20T08:52:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	about 3-4 years old?
2007-07-20T08:52:00.000Z	mneptok	ethan	huh. thought the 6200 series was this year.
2007-07-20T08:52:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	no way.
2007-07-20T08:52:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	maybe the 8*** series.
2007-07-20T08:58:00.000Z	mneptok	ethan	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2007-07-20T08:59:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	yes... done that.
2007-07-20T08:59:00.000Z	mneptok	ethan	including the dist-upgrade?
2007-07-20T08:59:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	everything is up to date, nvidia-glx does _NOT_ work.
2007-07-20T08:59:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	I do dist-upgrade daily
2007-07-20T08:59:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	only nvidia-glx-new works.
2007-07-20T09:00:00.000Z	ethan	mneptok	nvidia-glx normally works fine, but after I let my computer be off for a week, it stopped working.
