2006-05-04T07:52:00.000Z	kbrooks		 i thought Sear was here
2006-05-04T07:53:00.000Z	kbrooks		turns out he was klined
2006-05-04T07:53:00.000Z	kbrooks		yes :-)
2006-05-04T06:47:00.000Z	kbrooks		Drac[Server] : no, it doesnt
2006-05-04T06:48:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	kbrooks	I already tried it, and it DOES screw up sudo, so don't tell me otherwise. I had to go into the root account whose password I had luckily created, or the entire system would have no root access.
2006-05-04T06:48:00.000Z	kbrooks		Drac[Server] : um, read !rootsudo
2006-05-04T06:48:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 		Sudo complains that it can't get the host by name, or something like that, if the hostname says otherwise.
2006-05-04T06:48:00.000Z	kbrooks		all's all that's all :-)
2006-05-04T06:49:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 		Please don't whine at me about creating a root password and soforth. I like to have root just in case, and this is why. Sudo can't change the hostname.
2006-05-04T06:49:00.000Z	kbrooks		Drac[Server] : i'm not whining at you
2006-05-04T06:49:00.000Z	kbrooks		Drac[Server] : i'm asking you to read !rootsudo: /msg ubotu rootsudo
2006-05-04T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	delcoyote	don't recommend it
2006-05-04T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks		!tell delcoyote about ubuntuguide
2006-05-04T06:50:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	kbrooks	I know all about root and sudo. I've used many linux distros, would you just listen to me, please?
2006-05-04T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks		Drac[Server] : sure
2006-05-04T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks		Drac[Server] : breakfast though
2006-05-04T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks		Drac[Server] : brb
2006-05-04T06:50:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	kbrooks	If the hostname changes, sudo has a problem. This is because there's some file somewhere that tells sudo what the hostname is supposed to be, and it doesn't change when you do "hostname" as sudo or root.
