2011-08-30T20:02:00.000Z	battlehands		I installed MATLAB and I cannot find it.  Can I search for the program through termal and execute it?
2011-08-30T20:02:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	Do you know what the binary is named?
2011-08-30T20:03:00.000Z	battlehands	Kyle__	no.  I dont know what that means,
2011-08-30T20:03:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	If the installer was made properly, it should be installed in /opt.  See if there's anything in /opt
2011-08-30T20:04:00.000Z	battlehands		just cd /opt?
2011-08-30T20:04:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	Sure.  Or ls /opt.
2011-08-30T20:04:00.000Z	Kyle__		if you cd in, you'll have to ls afterwards, of course.
2011-08-30T20:04:00.000Z	battlehands		only think in opt is gogle
2011-08-30T20:04:00.000Z	battlehands	Kyle__	I remember it was something like /usr/local/matlab
2011-08-30T20:04:00.000Z	battlehands	Kyle__	or /usr/local/bin/ matlab
2011-08-30T20:05:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	Oh ok.  So cd into /usr/local and ls.  If there's a matlab directory, ls it.  If not, ls -lhtr|tail /usr/local/bin/
2011-08-30T20:06:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	ls -lhtr means, long listing, human readable, sorted by time, reverse.  So the most recently created file will show up at the bottom of the list.  And tail will (by dfeault) only give you the last few lines.
2011-08-30T20:06:00.000Z	battlehands		can I search for matlab?
2011-08-30T20:07:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	Sure.  find /usr/ -iname "matlab*" -type f
2011-08-30T20:07:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	That may help you.
2011-08-30T20:08:00.000Z	battlehands		can I search for matlab?
2011-08-30T20:08:00.000Z	battlehands	Kyle__	matlab is not in the directory I thought it was.  Can I search for it in general?
2011-08-30T20:08:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	That was the find command I gave you.
2011-08-30T20:09:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	find /usr -iname "matlab*" -type f
2011-08-30T20:09:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	That's find all files (not directories) with names starting with matlab.
2011-08-30T20:10:00.000Z	battlehands	Kyle__	but isnt that only for things under /usr?
2011-08-30T20:10:00.000Z	Kyle__	battlehands	yes.  Pop quiz, how would you change it to search for everything on your system?
