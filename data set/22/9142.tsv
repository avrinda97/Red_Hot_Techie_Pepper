2005-03-10T14:03:00.000Z	Brunellus		what puzzles me is that I don't have an NIC in the computer that's having a problem....
2005-03-10T14:03:00.000Z	Brunellus		just a wlan card
2005-03-10T14:04:00.000Z	Brunellus		so I don't undertand why I can ping my AP and can't get the internet
2005-03-10T14:05:00.000Z	ompaul	Brunellus	also make sure that your ap is set up for more than one ip at a time
2005-03-10T14:06:00.000Z	Brunellus		the AP is set for more than one AP at a time.  presently, two other machines connect to it
2005-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	Brunellus		in fact, the AP gave the troublesome box an IP
2005-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	ompaul	Brunellus	well it is an issue that caught me out, even 10 years after doing my first install using a floppy :)
2005-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	Brunellus		although, curiously, when I looked through the AP's logs, it didn't log a hostname!
2005-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	ompaul		install of FLOSS that is
2005-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	Brunellus		it's bizarre.
2005-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	ompaul	Brunellus	what ip has it got?
2005-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	Brunellus		ummm....
2005-03-10T14:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Brunellus	what ip the box that is
2005-03-10T14:08:00.000Z	Brunellus		the troublebox?
2005-03-10T14:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Brunellus	that would it
2005-03-10T14:08:00.000Z	Brunellus		got it.  it's running at 192.168.0.102
2005-03-10T14:09:00.000Z	Brunellus		no hostname (strange)
2005-03-10T14:09:00.000Z	Brunellus	elmaya	 is that at me, and if so what am I supposed to do?
2005-03-10T14:10:00.000Z	Brunellus		OK.
2005-03-10T14:11:00.000Z	Brunellus		gotyou.
2005-03-10T14:11:00.000Z	Brunellus		"add default gw ROUTERIP"--what's that supposed to do?
2005-03-10T14:12:00.000Z	ompaul	Brunellus	it helps the machine find the internet
