2011-12-25T06:14:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	I have a scar from my computer...
2011-12-25T06:15:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Hm?
2011-12-25T11:33:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	reminds me of someone who had chmod -x done on chmod, and couldn't chmod it back
2011-12-25T11:34:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	How did this end?
2011-12-25T11:34:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	by a perl script to chmod chmod
2011-12-25T11:35:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	It fixed it?
2011-12-25T11:36:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	You'll need to reboot into a recovery mode or use a live cd or something I think
2011-12-25T11:37:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Bad news.
2011-12-25T11:37:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	My filesystem is encrypted.
2011-12-25T11:40:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	No, my point was, how did this guy ended?
2011-12-25T11:40:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Was he able to fix the system?
2011-12-25T11:41:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	the person who chmod'ed chmod? they fixed it with a perl script - they still had all the permissions, they just couldn't run chmod
2011-12-25T11:41:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Good to hear that.
2011-12-25T11:41:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	it's still possible to use a livecd and mount the fs I believe, just harder
2011-12-25T11:42:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Yes, probably.
2011-12-25T11:42:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	is the entire FS encrypted or just home directories?
2011-12-25T11:42:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Just /home.
2011-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	then if you use a livecd and mount it and fix the sudoers file I would expect it to work
2011-12-25T11:43:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Can I simply login into recovery mode?
2011-12-25T11:44:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	I think dpkg-reconfigure sudo from recovery would work, but I've never tried it myself
2011-12-25T11:54:00.000Z	pnorman	paulsomebody	try shift
2011-12-25T11:54:00.000Z	paulsomebody	pnorman	Aha.
