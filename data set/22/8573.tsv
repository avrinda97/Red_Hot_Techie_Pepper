2005-07-06T15:45:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	sox is for sound, docker is for traydock, tcl tk runs amsn
2005-07-06T15:46:00.000Z	curut	jeroen_	y does intalling amsn need it?
2005-07-06T15:46:00.000Z	curut	jeroen_	y i mean the docker and done msn have tcl tk then? since it need it
2005-07-06T15:46:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	amsn is written in the tcl/tk language.
2005-07-06T15:46:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	therefore it needs tcl/tk packages to be run
2005-07-06T15:47:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	also, if you want to see display pictures with the stable version (non-CVS), you should install the things in the 'recommened' section
2005-07-06T15:48:00.000Z	curut	jeroen_	oo ty the recommended section in the amsn web?
2005-07-06T15:49:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	no, what Synaptic suggests
2005-07-06T15:50:00.000Z	curut	jeroen_	erm how do i see that? sry i am kinda new this is the first time i using linux
2005-07-06T15:52:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	In synaptic, right-click on amsn -> mark suggested for installation -> imagemagick. That'll select imagemagick for installations aswell. You don't need to install the other 3 things Amsn suggests, they're 3 different browsers (and shouldn't really show up there)
2005-07-06T15:57:00.000Z	curut	jeroen_	oo ty hey erm... i got problem installing ^^, the msg say setting up amsn.....      then nothing happen
2005-07-06T15:58:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	are you sure?
2005-07-06T15:58:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	it might take a while
2005-07-06T16:00:00.000Z	curut	jeroen_	hmm i check at synaptic, amsn is included there but i cant seem to find the executable
2005-07-06T16:00:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	you just run "amsn"
2005-07-06T16:00:00.000Z	jeroen_	curut	isn't it in the menu? Apps -> internet -> amsn
