2010-03-15T20:44:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	you can just install the regular version
2010-03-15T20:44:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	I don't think that regular Ubuntu works with an EeePC
2010-03-15T20:45:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	I know it does, I have installed it on my own eee
2010-03-15T20:55:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	The subpages of "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC" list so many troubles with having regular Ubuntu on EeePC that I better either make the UNR work or change distro.
2010-03-15T20:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	can you be more specific?
2010-03-15T20:57:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	You see, you must patch/alter regular Ubuntu quite a lot, according to the pages, to make it work as should. I simply currently have to Panels issue which I'd want to solve to see if more issues arise. If more arises, I'll fix them up until they can't be fixed.
2010-03-15T20:58:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	what page says you have to patch ubuntu?
2010-03-15T20:58:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC
2010-03-15T20:59:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	I don't see it, but you can do what you want.  Most of those pages are old, even the array.org kernel isn't needed anymore
2010-03-15T21:00:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	Urgh. Google for "eeepc ubuntu" without the quotes and the first page there has "EeePC" in its right end
2010-03-15T21:00:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	in its address.
2010-03-15T21:01:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	oh, I see the page.  I just don't see what patching you have to do to get it working.  Again, I run regular ubuntu on eeepc already, so I know that all the issues there used to be have been fixed
2010-03-15T21:02:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	Which EeePC ? I have 900 which I installed UNR onto
2010-03-15T21:02:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	1000HE
2010-03-15T21:03:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	I think that lappy works better than 900 but okey, I'll test regular Ubuntu and will then report back
2010-03-15T21:03:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	the only different between UNR and regular is the interface.  All the drivers were put into the kernel so are in both
2010-03-15T21:05:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	Meaning that the UNR .img image's 300 megas larger size is due to more poor image format ?
2010-03-15T21:05:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	no, it would be just different things installed
2010-03-15T21:06:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	Hmmm, the "Fixes" page says that the page was last edited 2009-11-06. Well, off I go to test with the regular Ub
2010-03-15T21:07:00.000Z	rautamiekka	ChogyDan	Oh, and I won't run 9.10 Karmic cuz it doesn't support my Nokia Internet Stick CS-15
2010-03-15T21:07:00.000Z	ChogyDan	rautamiekka	oh, I see, that may change things, but good luck
