2012-04-05T05:36:00.000Z	x_chr		Hi. My CD Drive has a disc in it. Disk Utility shows it (/dev/sr0), but pressing Eject gives "No media in drive" error, the physical eject button does nothing, and trying to mount /dev/sr0 seems to hang. The 'eject' command says "unable to find or open device for: `cdrom'" Any suggestions?
2012-04-05T05:37:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	never heard of that before. i could do some digging if you like. can you read any data from that cd?
2012-04-05T05:37:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	I'd check on a different computer if I could open the drive :) It has read discs in the past successfully.
2012-04-05T05:40:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	well i was not referring to the device. hmmm. for now if you have a paperclip, you can put it in the small hole on the front of the device, and then open it that way.
2012-04-05T05:41:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	i have seen this when people accidentally insert 2 cd's in a one cd tray.
2012-04-05T05:42:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	Pretty sure I didn't do that, but I'm working on forcing it open now.
2012-04-05T05:45:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	I'm going to restart my computer and open it while it boots. be back.
2012-04-05T05:50:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	Hmm... as suspected, it depends on the disc. Are you aware of a situation where certain disks cause the drive to stop working properly?
2012-04-05T05:51:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	no. I have seen this on windows when the disc is formatted strangely, but I haven't seen this on ubuntu as of yet...
2012-04-05T05:52:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	I'm going through my old CDs. This is a random DVD-R. It could have degraded...
2012-04-05T05:53:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	it also could be timing out because of scratches or a damaged device. I don't do much with cd's anymore, maybe that's why I havent noticed this
2012-04-05T05:54:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	Yeah, that might be right, though it seems like it's *not* timing out when it should be.
2012-04-05T05:56:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	Damn. It's doing it again now... Yeah, good thing I don't use optical media too much any more.
2012-04-05T05:56:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	has it been all cd's, or just recorded dvd's?
2012-04-05T05:58:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	Seems to be only recorded DVD-Rs.
2012-04-05T05:58:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	But decidedly not all
2012-04-05T05:58:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	i think i understand what the other dude was talking about. you might get the tray open if you killed the process trying to open the dvd. i'm not certain what process that would be, but it would be easy to do with something like htop.
2012-04-05T06:00:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	Aha.
2012-04-05T06:01:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	aha? is that a good aha!
2012-04-05T06:01:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	It's an 'ah, yeah, that might have done it,' Though still tempered by the fact that my drive just isn't reading some stuff.
2012-04-05T06:02:00.000Z	hylian	x_chr	hmm, you know the way I would handle this would be to first dump this dvd-r in a nother ubuntu machine to see if i can replicate the error. is that a possibility?
2012-04-05T06:03:00.000Z	x_chr	hylian	Worst case I can do that on my (mac) laptop and transfer, yeah.
