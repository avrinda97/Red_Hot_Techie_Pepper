2005-04-22T09:07:00.000Z	LISP		why not?
2005-04-22T09:08:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	if you look at the available packages... for devel. it is still pretty much incomplete
2005-04-22T09:09:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	you don't need to install from stage 1.
2005-04-22T09:11:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	install  gentoo from stage 1 won't guarantee you the fastest performance
2005-04-22T09:11:00.000Z	LISP	picochu	why not?...
2005-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	bob2's right...
2005-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	so it wall depends
2005-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	but the reason i use gentoo is that it makes devel a lot easier.. partially because the source is always there :)
2005-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	LISP	picochu	what kind devel?
2005-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	what do you mean?
2005-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	practically everything i guess. I do HPC stuffs. so, in my case it's C/C++ and fortran. Gentoo has quite an impressive range of devel software. PS: i think we should bring this conversation to private.
2005-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	fortran is pretty much still alive in scientific computing
2005-04-22T09:24:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	 they've removed some of the codes because of "patent" issues....
2005-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	nah it won't take that long
2005-04-22T09:36:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	kernel processes
2005-04-22T09:41:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	you are a tough customer to please
2005-04-22T09:41:00.000Z	LISP	picochu	why not?
2005-04-22T09:42:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	just like girlfriends, distro arent perfect
2005-04-22T09:42:00.000Z	LISP	picochu	and like girls, there's a lot of work involved =))
2005-04-22T09:43:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	mplayer plays EVERYTHING ;)
2005-04-22T09:44:00.000Z	LISP	picochu	but why bother? ;)
2005-04-22T09:44:00.000Z	picochu	LISP	it makes a rather good CLI mp3/ogg player
