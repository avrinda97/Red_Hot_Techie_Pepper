2008-11-03T01:05:00.000Z	seclm193		Anyone here use virtualbox?  i'm trying to get windows running without dual-booting
2008-11-03T01:06:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	if you can get virtual box to run, just set up a VM and boot it.
2008-11-03T01:06:00.000Z	seclm193	ldiamond	the problem is getting usb devices to work in win xp through virtualbox
2008-11-03T01:06:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	I havent use virtual box, but in VMWare you just have to enable it in a menu.
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	the USB device will not work in both the VM and the host. You have to tell the VM to take control of it
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	seclm193	ldiamond	does VMWare work better
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	I dont think so
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	I just happen to have used it a lot.
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	Try google
2008-11-03T01:07:00.000Z	seclm193	ldiamond	i'm just not sure how to tell VM to take control
2008-11-03T01:08:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	this is not a ubuntu problem
2008-11-03T01:08:00.000Z	seclm193	ldiamond	been googling, getting more confused than anything

2008-11-03T01:09:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	Make sure it supports the USB stuffs too, this says it doesnt
2008-11-03T01:09:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	Qemu is good too
2008-11-03T01:09:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	VMware as well
2008-11-03T01:09:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	you could use whatever

2008-11-03T01:09:00.000Z	ldiamond		Can anyone tell me why my screen stays black when coming back from Suspend mode ?
2008-11-03T01:10:00.000Z	ldiamond	seclm193	Make sure vbox supports it, if not get vmware.
2008-11-03T01:11:00.000Z	seclm193	ldiamond	which version of vmware do you use
