2011-08-31T06:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	green just mean 777 or everyone/all permission
2011-08-31T06:56:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	well, should the matlab file be one of those permissions?
2011-08-31T06:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	ya, probably
2011-08-31T06:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	open a terminal, cd into the directory, then run ./MATHLABFOO (or whatever it's called) and see if there is any output/error
2011-08-31T06:59:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	is says no such file or directory
2011-08-31T07:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	are you running 64bit ubuntu - "uname -m" if you aren't sure
2011-08-31T07:01:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	i686
2011-08-31T07:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	that's 32 bit - do you get any other output at all before "no such..."
2011-08-31T07:01:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	thats it
2011-08-31T07:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	i have no idea then, good luck.
2011-08-31T07:02:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	oh... 'bash: ./matlabR2010a: ..."
2011-08-31T07:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	? sorry that doesn't help (me) at all, I still got no suggestions.
2011-08-31T07:06:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	Ok.  I found the executable.  Now I have to run it in terminal to open the program.  I want to be able to 'windows key
2011-08-31T07:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	you're asking the wrong person, I've don't use Unity
2011-08-31T07:09:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	ok
2012-03-06T22:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	why not just setup SSH, then you can have remote access to your desktop from anywhere
2012-03-06T22:45:00.000Z	battlehands	zykotick9	My desktop has been crashing, and I don't want to need to access it and it be off.
2012-06-24T09:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	"gedit foo.txt"
2012-06-24T09:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	if you just want to create a blank file, "touch foo.txt" would work.
2012-09-17T03:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	use /opt to install out-of-repo packages that you want multiple users to access.  use ~ if it's just you.
2012-09-17T03:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	i imagine it already exists "ls -l /lib64/libc.so.6" to confirm.
2012-09-17T03:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	battlehands	this sort of linking is a bad idea generally.  seldom works as well.
