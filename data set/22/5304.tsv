2007-05-29T05:47:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk		hello, I'v got question, when I will delete etc/fstab, after restart, will ubuntu recovery and mount my partitions ?
2007-05-29T05:47:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	no
2007-05-29T05:48:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	so what I can do to mount my partitions? because I edited my fstab file by nano and something was broken, and after restrt I have not any partitions ntfs
2007-05-29T05:49:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	post the contents of /etc/fstab on paste.ubuntu-nl.org , along with the output of sudo fdisk -l
2007-05-29T05:49:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	I'll help you get that back
2007-05-29T05:50:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22999/
2007-05-29T05:51:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	and you have *no* /etc/fstab at all?
2007-05-29T05:53:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23000/   there is my fstab file, but in /media there is only empty folders
2007-05-29T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	you do have ntfs-3g installed?
2007-05-29T05:55:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	yep
2007-05-29T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	dpkg -l ntfs-3g to double check: if the first two characters are ii, it's installed
2007-05-29T05:56:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	yes it's installed
2007-05-29T05:58:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	ok, I'm interested in a couple of error messages: type sudo umount /media/sda2 ; if it says it's not mounted, then type sudo mount /media/sda2
2007-05-29T06:00:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23001/
2007-05-29T06:00:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	I'd do what it says :)
2007-05-29T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	if you don't want to boot windows, I'd do option 2
2007-05-29T06:02:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	so use force ?
2007-05-29T06:03:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	I'm real protective of my ntfs partition in linux. I don't use ntfs-3g yet, it's not ready for my prime time. I'd do the double boot because I'm very conservative
2007-05-29T06:04:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	and then go browse the net, trying to figure out why ntfs-3g needs a hack like that
2007-05-29T06:04:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	okey. so you think that after boot windows and back to ubuntu, I'll can mount partitions ?
2007-05-29T06:04:00.000Z	nickrud	ShpxLbh_uk	like it says, boot twice.
2007-05-29T06:05:00.000Z	ShpxLbh_uk	nickrud	cheers, bye :)
