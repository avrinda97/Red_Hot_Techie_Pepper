2012-02-11T11:12:00.000Z	jetole		last Oregon`
2012-02-11T11:12:00.000Z	jetole		oops. ignore that
2012-02-11T11:13:00.000Z	pangolin	jetole	Please stop swearing and yes using *** is still swearing.
2012-02-11T11:14:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	**** might be swaering. The truth is you can only guess what I said when I censored myself ;-)
2012-02-11T11:14:00.000Z	pangolin	jetole	I'm only going to ask nice, next time I need to guess I will assume the worst and ban you. :)
2012-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	sorry. Just trying to have a sense of humor is all
2012-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	so I can't even swear if I censor it?
2012-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	and if that's the case, isn't that a bit much?
2012-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	pangolin	jetole	humour is all well and good but it is not helpful. stick to support in here and you are welcome to join #ubuntu-offtopic for fun.
2012-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	pangolin	jetole	correct, no swearing.
2012-02-11T11:16:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	by the way, not that this should matter but I've spent the last many hours here working on fixing diuneigh problem and it seems much to get kickbanned for censoring my swearing
2012-02-11T11:16:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	ok
2012-02-11T11:16:00.000Z	pangolin	jetole	#ubuntu doesn't have a karma system, you don't get extra points for good work that you can spend on breaking rules.
2012-02-11T11:17:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	well that explains why I said "not that it should matter"
2012-02-11T11:18:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	#ubuntu also doesn't seem to have a "social rationalization" system either but I don't want to get ban'd so I'll try my best to bite my tounge
2012-02-11T11:18:00.000Z	pangolin	jetole	I appreciate your understanding
2012-02-11T11:19:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	btw, is hell a sensitive word?
2012-02-11T11:20:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	like I just said "week from hell at the office". Is that ok?
2012-02-11T11:20:00.000Z	pangolin	jetole	:) see /msg ubottu !guidelines
2012-02-11T11:20:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	sure. Thanks
2012-02-11T12:09:00.000Z	jetole	pangolin	so I finially finished reading https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines. When you say not to use asterisks to censor myself, are you referring to off-topic or was it the context I used it in where you felt that I might be harassing or inciting harassment because I got the impression from that I shouldn't swear at all even if I am censoring myself in doing so and making sure that my obscenity isn't seen by anyone but I didn't see any mention of ...
