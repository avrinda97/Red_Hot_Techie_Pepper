2006-01-03T11:20:00.000Z	Markus_P		i've wasted about 4 hours on it
2006-01-03T11:20:00.000Z	Markus_P		i've read every tutorial on the net
2006-01-03T11:21:00.000Z	Markus_P		no
2006-01-03T11:21:00.000Z	Markus_P		it doesn't do anything but take me back to the manual partition screen
2006-01-03T11:21:00.000Z	Markus_P		i've also used the suggestion made by ubotu
2006-01-03T11:22:00.000Z	Markus_P		which uses the live cd
2006-01-03T11:22:00.000Z	Markus_P		Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.
2006-01-03T11:22:00.000Z	Markus_P		i get that error when i try to automatically install grub
2006-01-03T11:22:00.000Z	Markus_P		i am positive that i do not have a boot partition
2006-01-03T11:23:00.000Z	Markus_P		has anyone here actually reinstalled grub after reinstalling windows?
2006-01-03T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 yes.. dozens of times.
2006-01-03T11:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 i spent a day or more reading and learning the ins and outs of GRUB. :P then its easy.
2006-01-03T11:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 ive done it soo many times with other disrtos.. i  can muddle my way through it withiout that url :P
2006-01-03T11:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 what is the system not doing/doing?
2006-01-03T11:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 windows over wrote the mbr, you mearly need to some how boot back to the ubuntu install and rerun the grub installer.
2006-01-03T11:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 you still have the ubuntu install cd?
2006-01-03T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows   - seems rather clear to me. :P
2006-01-03T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 you still get no menu eh.. means ya proberly did somtning wrong. Lol.
2006-01-03T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 if you Knwo the Grub style names for your hard drives - you can use  the section called  "Recovering GRUB Manually"
2006-01-03T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 HOWEVER - if you added a new partition or some how altereed the order.. you will need to make changes to the hd0,0 and so forth.
2006-01-03T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	  Until? hmm thats an alternative method. you should be able to just  boot the live cd. and in a root shell, run 'grub' and type those commands.
2006-01-03T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Markus_P	 no need to mount stuff or do the other things at the start.
