2006-02-23T06:31:00.000Z	phiber_optic		If anybody know why when I ssh to a unix server my enter, backspace and arrows dont work I would REALLY APRECCIATE IT
2006-02-23T06:31:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	stty erase
2006-02-23T06:31:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	are you using bash?
2006-02-23T06:31:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	yeah
2006-02-23T06:32:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	so what do i do?
2006-02-23T06:34:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	You need to tell the server that the backspace key is a backspace key. You should add " stty erase '^?' " to your bash_rc
2006-02-23T06:35:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	and what about for enter and the arrows
2006-02-23T06:39:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	 I added the line you told me to .bashrc and still didnt work :(
2006-02-23T06:39:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	You'll need to login and out
2006-02-23T06:39:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	oh wait a second
2006-02-23T06:42:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	Sorry, I didn't explain properly, to enter stty erase '^?' . Without double quote marks ("). You need to type "stty erase ' " then type ctrl +c and then "?'"
2006-02-23T06:43:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	if that makes sense?
2006-02-23T06:43:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	not really :(
2006-02-23T06:43:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	didnt make much sense at all sorry
2006-02-23T06:44:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	You can also type stty erase (and then press backspace, and then return) in your terminal window and that should fix it for this session.
2006-02-23T06:46:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	nah, stty is there by default.
2006-02-23T06:49:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/workshops/cool_unix/stty.html explains it well, if you look towards the bottom of the page
2006-02-23T06:51:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	that's confusing, if you put it in your .bash_rc (note that starts with a .) then it should execute everytime you start a new session.
2006-02-23T06:53:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	didnt work :(
2006-02-23T06:54:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	Sorry, it's .bashrc, no underscore.
2006-02-23T06:58:00.000Z	phiber_optic	dsas	 it didnt work :( I guess
2006-02-23T07:11:00.000Z	dsas	phiber_optic	If you're using putty and you go to to "keyboard" when you start it up and toggling the backspace key commands there doesn't work then I don't know why, sorry.
