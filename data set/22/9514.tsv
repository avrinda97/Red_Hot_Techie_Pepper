2004-10-15T16:23:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	i don't see anything at google for debainfreedom
2004-10-15T16:25:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	?
2004-10-15T16:27:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	i saw your statement that debain freedom will be born oct 15 so i googled for debianfreedom but nothing comes up
2004-10-15T16:28:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	debianfreedom is a user on irc, on oct 18 ubuntu will be born :) http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/WartyWarthog_2fReleaseSchedule
2004-10-15T16:28:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	oh ok...that explains it
2004-10-15T16:31:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	i think the gentoo docks are terrible...they don't give you addresses for libusb...and they don't fully document catalyst
2004-10-15T16:31:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	it takes hours of searching to find these things
2004-10-15T16:31:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	the gentoo docs have never been very good
2004-10-15T16:32:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	that's not terrible, terrible is the book i got with my video :)
2004-10-15T16:32:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	that is funny
2004-10-15T16:33:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	i think gentoo's problem is that they try to oversimplify everything
2004-10-15T16:34:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	but it really ticks me off that they don't fully document catalyst
2004-10-15T16:34:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	it's still quite new and not finished isn't it besides programmers hate writing docs
2004-10-15T16:34:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	well i know but catalyst is very very important
2004-10-15T16:35:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	well, how many people use catalyst, i never even looked at it
2004-10-15T16:35:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	without catalyst docs...the only distros we can create are debian based distros
2004-10-15T16:36:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	so? problem solved, here we are :)
2004-10-15T16:37:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	i think it is terrible that gentoo does not document catalyst properly so people can create competition distros for gentoo
2004-10-15T16:37:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	besides if you want to muck with something like catalist you have to know perl, "so use the source,luke" 
2004-10-15T16:40:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	i think it is absurd that gentoo does not document catalyst
2004-10-15T16:40:00.000Z	plovs	pyramid	to close this rather off-topic discussion: 1. they gave you the source 2. http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst/reference.xml
2004-10-15T16:41:00.000Z	pyramid	plovs	yes i need to take a look at that source...but part 2 of the catalyst documentation involves mkisofs and other stuff...so it is difficult without the documentation
