2011-06-06T20:49:00.000Z	fellipe		hi friends. I've ran remastersys backup and remastersys dist  commands and they generate a ISO file, but it seems the behavior booting with this ISO is the same: the system runs in a live session. So, how can I "install" this iso image into a system?
2011-06-06T20:49:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	Did the system you made the ISO of had Ubiquity installed? If no, you can't
2011-06-06T20:50:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	well,  when I tried to dpkg -i remastersys...deb,
2011-06-06T20:50:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	That's not what I mean. Run "sudo apt-get install ubiquity" before creating the ISO
2011-06-06T20:51:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	when I did apt-get -f install I guess it was installed
2011-06-06T20:51:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	but I will check it now :)
2011-06-06T20:51:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	gparted must be present for partitioning to work too
2011-06-06T20:51:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	hey, ubiquity is already installed
2011-06-06T20:52:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	even gparted is not present, the remastersys works fine, without errors
2011-06-06T20:53:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	Remastersys doesn't mean for the ISOs to be magically installable
2011-06-06T20:53:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	anyway, I am installing gparted right now.. but, what am I doing wrong?
2011-06-06T20:53:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	I am testing in virtual box..
2011-06-06T20:53:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	Probably nothing, but the installer *should* be possible to run.
2011-06-06T20:54:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	Just run "gksu ubiquity" or whatever on the LiveCD
2011-06-06T20:54:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	but, is ubiquity have to be ran after the first boot with iso to transfer the system to hard drive?
2011-06-06T20:55:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	Uh... You run it after it's booted to install the OS to the HD, yes
2011-06-06T20:56:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	hummmm it changes everything...
2011-06-06T20:56:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	but, if I have to do it everytime, so, what's the difference between dist and backup modes?
2011-06-06T20:57:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	No idea, sorry, I never used that
2011-06-06T20:57:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	hum... no problem.. thanks a lot ;)
2011-06-06T20:58:00.000Z	fellipe	theadmin	do U know some properly channel where I can ask these questions?
2011-06-06T20:58:00.000Z	theadmin	fellipe	It is the right channel
