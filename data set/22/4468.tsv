2008-01-11T07:44:00.000Z	mattholimeau		well - no, that wasn't how to create a menu - that was how to create a submenu i found
2008-01-11T07:45:00.000Z	mattholimeau		sweet - got the places control under control
2008-01-11T07:46:00.000Z	mattholimeau		anyone know how to add a folder to the "applications places system" menu?
2008-01-11T07:47:00.000Z	mattholimeau		or how to make it not show any of those?
2008-01-11T07:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	right click > edit menus> new menu
2008-01-11T07:49:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	that created a new submenu withing the applications or system folder
2008-01-11T07:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	hmm not sure howto do that
2008-01-11T07:51:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	thanks anyway. neither do i, heh
2008-01-11T07:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	lemme check something out
2008-01-11T07:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	right click on the panel ( emtpy space ) add to panel> scroll down some and add custom menu
2008-01-11T07:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	sorry Menu Bar
2008-01-11T07:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	ok maybe not
2008-01-11T07:55:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	the custom menu bar adds the one i have on there already... yeah, looks like i'd have to recode the menu bar app
2008-01-11T07:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	yeah I saw that after i told you
2008-01-22T06:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	size?
2008-01-22T06:57:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	hah, no - i meant like with a sledgehammer and $500 for a replacement or something. it's just fuzzy if i havn't had it on for like an hour. it'll go away
2008-01-22T06:57:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	maybe just a regular hammer and many swings... it might be more satisfying.
2008-01-22T06:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	3rd floor window always does the trick :)
2008-01-22T06:58:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	have you heard of this though? It's an old flatscreen, and it's fuzzy until it "gets warm" or something.
2008-01-22T06:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	mattholimeau	no but I have heard of this in older flat screen tv's
2008-01-22T06:59:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	strange... i jump into warsow and the "fuzziness" completely goes away.
2008-01-22T07:00:00.000Z	mattholimeau	IdleOne	then i quit out and it's back to fuzzy. i know if i sit around for an hour or so it'll gradually go away
