2010-03-14T08:25:00.000Z	ddrj		No bootable partition in table.
2010-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	ddrj		it's set as active partition, used that unetbootin tool to create the usb
2010-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	ddrj		i used unetbootin, specified iso and browsed to ubuntu 9.10 iso
2010-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	ddrj		;\\ yeah... i don't have a cd drive or floppy on target OS
2010-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	ddrj		err target machine
2010-03-14T08:27:00.000Z	ddrj		tbh, just a custom built one lullabud
2010-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	ddrj		also the partition's set as active / primary
2010-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	ddrj		ahhhh
2010-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	ddrj		crap, it may not be bootable then x\\
2010-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	ddrj		this is just a cheap office depot brand
2010-03-14T08:30:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	why do you need that? get a USB CD drive and boot from that. (or does your bios support booting from USB CD?)
2010-03-14T08:31:00.000Z	ddrj	linagee	hmm yeah but i don't have a usb cd drive or any friends that have one ;(
2010-03-14T08:32:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	ebay
2010-03-14T08:37:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	PNY from walmart works
2010-03-14T08:37:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	I tried doing the ISO/USB boot thing with a 16GB walmart PNY USB drive
2010-03-14T08:37:00.000Z	ddrj	linagee	thanks !!! i'll get that then, cus this ativa's a POS office depot knock off brand
2010-03-14T08:38:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	not that you need 16GB for an ISO, but it was only $50 or so and I will of course reuse it
2010-03-14T08:38:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	why don't you return it when you're done too? that will complete the cheapskateness. :P
2010-03-14T08:39:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	I don't think they have 1GB PNY USB drives at walmart anymore btw. I think 2GB or 4GB is the smallest now
2010-03-14T08:42:00.000Z	ddrj	linagee	to complete the cheapskate part, i'm about to try installing ubuntu from my camera via usb :) (gotta give credit to lullabud)
2010-03-14T08:42:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	LOL
2010-03-14T08:42:00.000Z	linagee	ddrj	or just get a drive and don't destroy them in the washer. :)
