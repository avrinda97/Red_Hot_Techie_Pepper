2010-05-03T02:49:00.000Z	Farmer_		Hi
2010-05-03T02:50:00.000Z	Farmer_		I've just upgraded from Karmic to Lucid. In Karmic, I had drivers fully functioning for my nVidia GTX 275 graphics card. In Lucid, they've all gone, and the hardware drivers dialogue is no help. Neither are the .run files provided on nVidia's website. What is the quickest and most pain-free way of making my graphics card work?
2010-05-03T02:51:00.000Z	Farmer_		Anybody?

2010-05-03T02:52:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	Go to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers. Does the Current (Recommended) driver show up? If so, activate it and reboot when instructed.
2010-05-03T02:52:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	As I said, that dialogue is no help. It's empty.
2010-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	Ok, try sudo apt-get update. Then, look at the dialog again.
2010-05-03T02:54:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	Just doing that. I'll get back in a moment.
2010-05-03T03:05:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	No change.
2010-05-03T03:06:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	Ok. I saw a guy in serbia on ubuntuforums with the same problem. If he ever got a solution, he didn't report it. Hmmm.....
2010-05-03T03:07:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	Ah, okay
2010-05-03T03:08:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	Do you know how to check your installed packages? Make sure you have linux-headers or linux-headers-generic installed.
2010-05-03T03:09:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	Apparently I have linux-gea
2010-05-03T03:09:00.000Z	Farmer_		Whoops
2010-05-03T03:09:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	Apparently I have linux-headers-generic
2010-05-03T03:10:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	Ok, I need to do some research. Are you going to be here for a few minutes?
2010-05-03T03:11:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	Aye
2010-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	Got it! Turned out I hadn't enabled restricted drivers.
2010-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	Farmer_	ratcheer	Thanks for your help, man :D
2010-05-03T03:15:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	I am sorry. I can't find anything on Launchpad. Just the guy in Serbia on ubuntuforums. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1460951
2010-05-03T03:16:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	What driver are you running on, now?
2010-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	ratcheer	Farmer_	Oh, I see you fixed it.
