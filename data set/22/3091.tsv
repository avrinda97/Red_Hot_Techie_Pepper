2009-01-20T11:29:00.000Z	Brack10		If I have xfce4 installed on Ubuntu, how can I start it from a command line?
2009-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	Brack10		I want gnome to be my default wm, but when I'm doing virtualization I want to use xfce
2009-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	Brack10		so I'd log out of gnome and start xfce
2009-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	Brack10		sorry
2009-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	Brack10		what's the term?
2009-01-20T11:33:00.000Z	Brack10		ok desktop environment
2009-01-20T11:33:00.000Z	Brack10		so...possible?
2009-01-20T11:34:00.000Z	eseven73	Brack10	and for a lightweight wm you might want to try Icewm or fluxbox, XFCE has gained a few pounds as of late...
2009-01-20T11:35:00.000Z	Brack10	eseven73	 I don't need something super duper lightweight, but vmware running 2 windows 2008 server and a vista box is really demanding on my poor little computer
2009-01-20T11:35:00.000Z	eseven73		One thing nice bout ubuntu there's 1500 window managers in the repos to play around with :)
2009-01-20T11:36:00.000Z	Brack10	eseven73	so how do I drop to CLI and launch another one? startx starts gnome of course
2009-01-20T11:36:00.000Z	eseven73		i know the feeling Brack10 i got win xp running as we speak on vbox ose
2009-01-20T11:37:00.000Z	eseven73	Brack10	i use Icewm and fluxbox when I have my win XP VM running which is like almost 90% of the time :)
2009-01-20T11:38:00.000Z	Brack10	eseven73	Ok if I use those instead of xfce will you tell me how to do it? :)
2009-01-20T11:38:00.000Z	eseven73	Brack10	I can give you a few tips sure
2009-01-20T11:38:00.000Z	Brack10		launch a separate wm from cli that is
2009-01-20T11:38:00.000Z	Brack10	eseven73	 No I just need to know how to have gnome start with Ubnuntu, but have the ability to launch another window manager when needed from CLI
2009-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	eseven73	Brack10	ive never done that before, I thought you meant from login
2009-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	Brack10		nah
2009-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	Brack10		I know that' just an xorg.conf thing
2009-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	Brack10		because I use vmware to run my test servers for my MS certs
2009-01-20T11:40:00.000Z	eseven73	Brack10	I just do ctrl Alt Backspace and switch that way
