2008-12-09T01:47:00.000Z	istvan_		anyone know why ffmpeg -i inputvideo.flv -fs 100 out.flv isn't creating a file that is 100 (mb?) in size? rather it is creating a file that is 0kb size
2008-12-09T01:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	Read the commands output, there is most likely an error there.
2008-12-09T01:49:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	i will check again, but i didn't see any
2008-12-09T01:50:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	I checked, it seems as though ffmpeg doesn't think that there are any frames...
2008-12-09T01:51:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	Is there an error?
2008-12-09T01:51:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	nope. i'll post some of the output. Seems stream 0 codec frame rate differs from container frame rate: 1000.00 (1000/1) -> 29.97 (30000/1001)
2008-12-09T01:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	Pastebin that and share the link, please.
2008-12-09T01:54:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	here is my output http://paste.ubuntu.com/82647/
2008-12-09T01:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	There is a suspicious lack of mention of units for the -fs switch on the ffmpeg manpage. Out of curiosity, what happens if you tack another two zeros onto that number?
2008-12-09T01:57:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	then i get a 117kb file... which is good, but still not what i asked for...
2008-12-09T01:57:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	117.6 actually
2008-12-09T01:58:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	That was with 10000?
2008-12-09T01:58:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	it was 10000
2008-12-09T01:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	Does it take suffixes? Try -fs 100K
2008-12-09T01:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	Actually, try ki instead of K
2008-12-09T01:59:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	nope, gives me a 0k file again
2008-12-09T02:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	this is with both K and ki?
2008-12-09T02:02:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	yep, both of em
2008-12-09T02:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	It looks like it's not exact. You may have to just play with it until you get under 100k.
2008-12-09T02:06:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	ok, thanks!
2008-12-09T02:07:00.000Z	istvan_	arrenlex	what unit do you think it is measuring in? bytes?
2008-12-09T02:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	istvan_	Hell if I know. It might even be bits.
