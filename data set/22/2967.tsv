2009-02-13T01:59:00.000Z	z1pp3r		Im curious about the minimal CD. Does it only install a very very limited basic install (which i want), or does it just download the whole default ubuntu installation? The minimalCD page isnt very clear
2009-02-13T02:01:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	i have no idea my self, but can i please have the link for the page?
2009-02-13T02:02:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	sure, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2009-02-13T02:03:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	maybe it's more clear to you than me...
2009-02-13T02:03:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	no its not :s but i'm afraid it looks like it just downloads everything..
2009-02-13T02:04:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	you know, if noone knows I just gonna test it :P
2009-02-13T02:05:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	that would be pretty cool =). I probably could do that as well, but then i'd have to backup stuff and i'm too lazy to do all that for nothing =)
2009-02-13T02:05:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	sure thing
2009-02-13T02:09:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	its installing now, obviously its a lot more to download so i dont know anything yet :P but what are you gonna use it for if i may ask
2009-02-13T02:15:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	okay. Well, my laptop is kindda old and the default installation is too beefy to run smoothly. I love the dpkg package system, but i'm not very fond of debian anymore. So i was hoping i could customize my ubuntu install to only include the bare minimum
2009-02-13T02:16:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	i understand! i love it too :) hope it is just installing the bare minimum now, cause i've been considering to install a "customized" version my self :)
2009-02-13T02:17:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	yeah, that would be great if that was possible
2009-02-13T02:18:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	what I did on the very early versions of ubuntu was using the server iso, but now its pretty different kernels and stuff..
2009-02-13T02:18:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	96% of installing the base system it says
2009-02-13T02:20:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	just a regular 4mbps
2009-02-13T02:22:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	you were never asked which packages you wanted? What do you think would happen if it did not have internet connection, would it even complete?
2009-02-13T02:22:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	yep, seems to be what we want ;) i got a list of things i want to install now debian style, but unfortunately i cant use the arrow keys in the vm, but i can see different server stuff and edubuntu desktop :P
2009-02-13T02:22:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	and kde desktop
2009-02-13T02:23:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	i agree!
2009-02-13T02:34:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	i think he was kidding =)
2009-02-13T02:34:00.000Z	z1pp3r	thehook	btw thx for testing out the minimal cd, i'll give it a go during the weekend
2009-02-13T02:35:00.000Z	thehook	z1pp3r	no problem ;)
