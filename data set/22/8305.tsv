2006-12-17T14:23:00.000Z	unimatrix9		do you think there should be more tutorials for beginners about ubuntu?
2006-12-17T14:24:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	there's plenty of documentation out there
2006-12-17T14:25:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	help.ubuntu.com
2007-02-10T15:02:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	shutdown with -F
2007-02-10T15:02:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	among any other options, yeah.
2007-02-10T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	well, you'll need a time.
2007-02-10T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	shutdown -rF now will reboot, and fsck, -hF will turn off the computer after the shutdown
2007-02-10T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	just once.  it'll get removed automatically
2007-05-08T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	have you looked into edubuntu's thinclient thing?
2007-06-20T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	What are you trying to prevent?  Just lockdown the user to not be able to do anything.
2007-06-20T12:53:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Flannel	i am trying to prevent from standalone ubuntu installs ( gnome desktop ) from being broken, and need the defaults to restore after reboot ...
2007-06-20T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	from being broken: don't give the user admin powers.  As for defaults to restore, thats... well, accomplishable a number of ways.  Simply removing write permissions places is one.
2007-06-20T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	if you wanted, you could also just boot from an imagine each time.  Although I'm not sure about specifics of that one
2007-06-20T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BootToRAM  There's one.
2007-06-20T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	except I think that won't use the HDD at all, except during boot.

2007-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	alromaithi, gksu nautilus, not sudo nautilus
2007-10-18T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	no it doesnt.  Don't use sudo for graphical apps, it sometimes causes permission errors and stuff.
2009-05-21T15:04:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	9.10 doesn't perform yet ;)
2009-05-21T15:04:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	#ubuntu+1, 9.10 doesn't exist, Karmic does.
2009-05-21T15:05:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	Again, #ubuntu+1 is for the development version, this channel is not.
2009-09-01T12:22:00.000Z	Flannel	unimatrix9	#ubuntu-server does exist, but this channel is appropriate as well
