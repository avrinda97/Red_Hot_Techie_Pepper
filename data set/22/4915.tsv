2007-09-18T07:54:00.000Z	steel_lady		a short easy question: I have a big external disk and I want to devide it to 2 fat32 partitions. is it ok to do it with gparted and which characteristics and names should I apply to partitions?
2007-09-18T07:55:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	characteristics/names?
2007-09-18T07:57:00.000Z	steel_lady	fermatstheorem	dystopianray: should they both be primary or in extended partition or how (external HDD for storing and work) and should I change the asignment to the other partition (it calls the first one /dev/sdb1)
2007-09-18T07:58:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	create two primary partitions, that should do it
2007-09-18T07:59:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	they will show up as two disks
2007-09-18T07:59:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	digressing, whyd o you want to paritttion the disk
2007-09-18T08:00:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	in my experience, parititoning did cause space issues
2007-09-18T08:01:00.000Z	steel_lady	fermatstheorem	I am doing my PhD and have 100G of data and I am also downloading a lot of multimedia, so I thought it would be a good idea to separate it. what do you thonk? And I was also thinking that some systems have problems with too big disks
2007-09-18T08:02:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	f you hae one big disk and 100g wodlnt cause problems, a growing segment need not be restrained by the partion size
2007-09-18T08:02:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	if you have an active torrent life ;-) you would end up with some space in ur research parition but none in ur multimedia parition
2007-09-18T08:02:00.000Z	steel_lady	fermatstheorem	I didn't understand you well, the external disk has 320G
2007-09-18T08:04:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	320g so be it, again it is only a recommendation that you donot parition stuff, it doesnt prevent data loss if at all it happens
2007-09-18T08:05:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	and keeping a single partition will prevent artificial restrictions
2007-09-18T08:05:00.000Z	steel_lady	fermatstheorem	not to partition the disk at all? and win will not have problems with too big disk? and it doesn't prevent data loss? :-(
2007-09-18T08:05:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	single parition
2007-09-18T08:05:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	win will not have problems
2007-09-18T08:06:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	remember to unplug the dirves properly
2007-09-18T08:06:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	and keep some DVD backups of you rimportant stuff
2007-09-18T08:07:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	what isthe model
2007-09-18T08:07:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	steel_lady	make
