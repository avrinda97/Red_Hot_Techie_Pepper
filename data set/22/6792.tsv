2009-12-22T12:20:00.000Z	rich4		Enter text here...that's just it I dn't know how to run any of the programs and it nothing like windows
2009-12-22T12:21:00.000Z	rich4		how can windows be useful in ubuntu
2009-12-22T12:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	ok  the basics are quite easy really,  there are guides and people here and that that will help with that
2009-12-22T12:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	so you can run  many Windows programs, that you can't get working in Wine,  and that you can't find alternatives to that you like enough
2009-12-22T12:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	there are good programs for nearly every computer task you can think of though, when it comes to Ubuntu
2009-12-22T12:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	What do you want to ecomplish on a computer?   What do you want to do?   Let's find out if Ubuntu can fit your needs.
2009-12-22T12:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	there are a few differences here and there, but nothing major, when it comes to the basics
2009-12-22T12:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	well yes, but you don't need to use that for the basics
2009-12-22T12:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	however for installing programs it's great using the terminal, much quicker than the graphical ways
2009-12-22T12:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	you can dual boot :)
2009-12-22T12:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	Windows and Ubuntu
2009-12-22T12:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	Who put Ubuntu on there and why?
2009-12-22T12:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	oh
2009-12-22T12:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	ok I understand
2009-12-22T12:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	so you didn't know you would get another OS with it instead of Windows?
2009-12-22T12:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	I have helped two not so technical people quite a bit with Ubuntu, both of them get on with it quite well, the first loves how she does not have to do loads of  virus scan and that rubbish
2009-12-22T12:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	you have an XP CD?
2009-12-22T12:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	you can set up a dual boot :)
2009-12-22T12:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	Ubuntu is a good OS, for a lot of stuff,  there is just a bit of a learning curve first as a new user of course
2009-12-22T12:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	you can do nearly anything you can do in  WIndows in Ubuntu
2009-12-22T12:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	ok we are trying to find out if Ubuntu is for you, but really it's off topic,  come join #ubuntu-offtopic and we can continue
2009-12-22T12:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rich4	  /join  #ubuntu-offtopic  type that in, if your not sure how to join
