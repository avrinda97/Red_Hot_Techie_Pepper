2007-03-21T10:47:00.000Z	Shrimpy_	richdurhm	well the share ratio is based on your uploaded data
2007-03-21T10:47:00.000Z	Shrimpy_	richdurhm	 Let me look something up real fast
2007-03-21T10:47:00.000Z	richdurhm	Shrimpy_	 ok
2007-03-21T10:50:00.000Z	Shrimpy_	richdurhm	 How long have you had azureus?
2007-03-21T10:50:00.000Z	richdurhm	Shrimpy_	 like 15 min
2007-03-21T10:53:00.000Z	Shrimpy_	richdurhm	since you forwarded you nat thingy you should see results. when i first started using this progam on ubuntu i was yellow. but after a while azureus (that smart frog) will find a hole and after a short period it should turn green
2007-03-21T10:54:00.000Z	Shrimpy_	richdurhm	 Sorry i can't be of more help, but in the options menu of azureus there should be an irc support
2007-03-21T10:54:00.000Z	richdurhm	Shrimpy_	i highly doubt that cause i used it on linux and she never went thru and i am using the same connection
2007-03-21T10:56:00.000Z	richdurhm	Shrimpy_	 thnx
