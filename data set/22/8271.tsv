2005-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	thewayofzen		has anyone been able to compile blackbox 0.70.1
2005-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	thewayofzen		im stuck here.. could use help
2005-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	just a guess - do you have xlibs-dev installed ?
2005-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	i sure do
2005-11-08T16:19:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	 ive used checkinstall to create a .deb and when i install it ive no idea where it ends up
2005-11-08T16:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	OK as I said - a guess ;)
2005-11-08T16:19:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	 so when i do it with sudo ./configure && make && make install
2005-11-08T16:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	probably the binary is in /usr/local/bin
2005-11-08T16:19:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	nope.. already looked
2005-11-08T16:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	the compile completed without errors? You didn't specify a different install path?
2005-11-08T16:20:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	 if i run make alone it finishes all the way no problems
2005-11-08T16:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	and you have a checkinstall deb installed now?
2005-11-08T16:21:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	yup
2005-11-08T16:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	if so, use bimberi 's command
2005-11-08T16:21:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	im remaking the deb
2005-11-08T16:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	it would be very surprising if the binary was *not* in /usr/local/bin
2005-11-08T16:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	since that is the default usually
2005-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	erm, that make is throwing errors
2005-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	it hasn't compiled
2005-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	 im attempting to recomple
2005-11-08T16:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thewayofzen	actually it's the make install that seems to be erroring, sorry
2005-11-08T16:25:00.000Z	thewayofzen	thoreauputic	 thats what im saying.. im gonna try checkinstall again ??
