2008-04-28T23:46:00.000Z	jerbear		what's the likelyhood that this bug will be fixed anytime soon?... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/212789
2008-04-28T23:48:00.000Z	jerbear		i think it's amazing that they would let such a piece of crap go out the door
2008-04-28T23:50:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	this is a support channel. Rants in /dev/null please
2008-04-28T23:50:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	i'm trying to get support
2008-04-28T23:50:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	ranting won't help with that
2008-04-28T23:51:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	try once more, haven't seen your question yet
2008-04-28T23:52:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	something is going haywire with the ~/.gvfs folder...
2008-04-28T23:52:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	'interesting'
2008-04-28T23:53:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	it's a completely fresh install, too
2008-04-28T23:54:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	it's apparently partially fixed in hardy-proposed (the segfault): https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/212789/comments/12
2008-04-28T23:55:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	i have proposed enabled and i haven't seen any updates
2008-04-28T23:55:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	well, there's not much people in here can help you with. The available workarounds are posted in that bug
2008-04-29T00:02:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	(those updates don't fix the logout+login problem, so don't wet yerself yet)
2008-04-29T00:09:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	I would like to suggest that you read the guidelines. People in here tend to be very strict about them because of the heavy traffic. They may help you understand why you were reprimanded. Thanks!
2008-04-29T00:46:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	that bugreport has some confirmations already. There's not much we in here can help you with
2008-04-29T00:48:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	i'm assuming the more people that see it, the more serious it will be taken. i know i'm not going to get a solution here, i'm just wondering if most people are seeing it
2008-04-29T00:48:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	... purely out of curiosity at this point
2008-04-29T00:49:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	fair enough :) But this is a support channel, not a devel/testers channel. It's busy enough here already just helping people
2008-04-29T00:49:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	give me a better place to ask, and i'll do so
2008-04-29T00:49:00.000Z	Seveas	jerbear	try #ubuntu-offtopic, they're into anything. Just tell them I sent you and if they don't help/test it for you they'll be whacked :)
2008-04-29T00:50:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	i'll try that, thanks
2008-04-29T00:59:00.000Z	jerbear	Seveas	yeh, no help in offtopic either... let the skull thumping commence! :)
