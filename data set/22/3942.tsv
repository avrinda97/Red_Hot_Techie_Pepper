2008-10-18T12:14:00.000Z	indian_munnda_		hey guys i wana do networking of ubuntu with vista can anyone tell me what should i do????
2008-10-18T12:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 #1 realize that theres more to 'networking' then just seeing 'shares' - :) the 'network neighborhood' stuff in windows is  controlled by 'samba' under linux.
2008-10-18T12:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 you want to access windows shares? or set up the linux box as a fileserver?
2008-10-18T12:16:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	i wanna share the network as well as i wanna run internet on both.
2008-10-18T12:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 those are totally different tasks. :)
2008-10-18T12:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 samba handles the shares. and as for internet-conection shareing.. well its doable.. i forget how.
2008-10-18T12:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 you may want to set up a dhcp server on one machine also.
2008-10-18T12:18:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	if i want to access windows vista files from ubuntu machinewhat should i do?
2008-10-18T12:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 the linux box/gnome file manager can browse windows shares  easially enough.
2008-10-18T12:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 sounds liek a firewall in the way.
2008-10-18T13:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 someone earlier said to use 'firestarter' and check the share connection box. --> <zcat[1]> dr_willis: The hard way... it's just a checkbox in firestarter now, 'share this connection' and it sets up the second interface, masq, dhcp...
2008-10-18T13:24:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	one machine has two lan cards which is having the internet connection
2008-10-18T13:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 put firestarter onthe box and enable shareing - is the easy way it seems.
2008-10-18T13:25:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	ok trying rite now
2008-10-18T13:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 thats a gateway/dns setting most likely
2008-10-18T13:36:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	i can ping the ip of google.
2008-10-18T13:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 you just proved its your DNS server settings then.
2008-10-18T13:37:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	got it yes u r rite
2008-10-18T13:38:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	let me provide it first.
2008-10-18T13:39:00.000Z	indian_munnda_	dr_willis	dion: got it thanks to both of u.
2008-10-18T13:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 setup samba on the ubuntu box, or use ssh and winscp. are 2 ways
2008-10-18T13:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	indian_munnda_	 personally i  edit  smb.conf file byhand.. been doing it for years.. You may want to find some gui, or checkout the 'share this folder' item on the menus
