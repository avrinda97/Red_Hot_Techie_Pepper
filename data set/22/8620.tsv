2005-08-10T07:05:00.000Z	Kyral		I'm saying I get bored with complete out of the box functionality
2005-08-10T07:05:00.000Z	Kyral		yes its nice
2005-08-10T07:06:00.000Z	Kyral		but I like to dive into the OS every once and a while :D
2005-08-10T07:06:00.000Z	Kyral		Not that many problems...
2005-08-10T07:06:00.000Z	Kyral		Like I said I dive into my OS
2005-08-10T07:06:00.000Z	Kyral		and then I do something stupid and have to reinstall :D
2005-08-10T07:07:00.000Z	Kyral		unrar
2005-08-10T07:07:00.000Z	Kyral		sudo apt-get install rar unrar-nonfree
2005-08-10T07:07:00.000Z	Kyral		AptGet owns :D
2005-08-10T07:08:00.000Z	Kyral		I do enjoy making my own Backports from Breezy though
2005-08-10T07:08:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	if they build straight from breezy, and you think it's worth putting into the offical repo, feel free to mailthe mailing list and suggest them
2005-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	Kyral	Mez	its called the Backports :D
2005-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	I know... I'm a backports developer
2005-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	hence i'm saying if you're backporting thing
2005-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	and they work straight from breezy sources,
2005-08-10T07:09:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	let me know
2005-08-10T07:10:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	we know - it's already backported
2005-08-11T09:26:00.000Z	Kyral	Mez	look at the main backports forum
2005-08-11T09:26:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	your best bet is the mailing list
2005-08-11T09:27:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	dch
2005-08-11T09:29:00.000Z	Kyral	Mez	the export command isn't being used
2005-08-11T09:29:00.000Z	Mez	Kyral	it's part of bash
