2010-03-03T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	with either command?
2010-03-03T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	run: sudo lshw -C network | grep product          then use that in websearches
2010-03-03T05:53:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	I know what kind of card I have, but it still doesn't help. I've followed all of the tutorials I could find, but I still can't access the internet wirelessly. WiFi Radar recognizes some signals, connects, but no internet access. Network Manager doesn't work at all...
2010-03-03T05:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	the card is moot, its the CHIP you need to know
2010-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	ok can you ping www.bbc.co.uk successfully
2010-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	can you ping 216.239.59.99
2010-03-03T05:55:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	I don't know how to ping, but I can get to both sites. (I am, however, running a wired connection right now)
2010-03-03T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	then connect via the wifi, disconnect wired.  the ping command is the same in windows as it is in any OS
2010-03-03T06:01:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	I can't connect wirelessly to ping...
2010-03-03T06:01:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	WiFi Radar just looks for an IP address forever...
2010-03-03T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	no if you set a manual ip does it ping ok?
2010-03-03T06:04:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	I don't really know how to set a manual IP, unfortunately.
2010-03-03T06:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	can you see accesspoints in the output of; sudo iwlist scan    ?
2010-03-03T06:05:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	I see a bunch of them, including the one I want to connect to.
2010-03-03T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	thats good, if you look at the ip of other devices which have an ip. most home grade routers use 192.168.0.x with the gateway being 192.168.0.1 and netmask 255.255.255.0
2010-03-03T06:06:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	what should I put in DNS?
2010-03-03T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
2010-03-03T06:07:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	and for the domain?
2010-03-03T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	nothing in there, should be fine. weird how you dont know your LAN network addressing
2010-03-03T06:10:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	I'm relatively new to this. Even when I manually input the IP address and everything, WiFi Radar still attempts to acquire IP address endlessly
2010-03-03T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	debrisplease	not sure then dude, the wifi finding APs is good
2010-03-03T06:12:00.000Z	debrisplease	ActionParsnip	All right. Thanks for your help any way!
