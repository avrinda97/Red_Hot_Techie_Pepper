2006-08-24T09:47:00.000Z	emoboy		well im actually wondering about a parallels VM, but i would assume its a similar process
2006-08-24T09:47:00.000Z	emoboy		bascially i want to run ubuntu under windows without dual booting
2006-08-24T09:48:00.000Z	emoboy		hmm well i have a parallels reg key already, so i would like to use that
2006-08-24T09:48:00.000Z	emoboy		when using a VM, do you install to the HD first then use the VM to boot that install?
2006-08-24T09:50:00.000Z	emoboy		any ideas :(
2006-08-24T09:51:00.000Z	emoboy		when using a VM, do you install to the HD partition first (as you usually would) then use the VM to boot that install?
2006-08-24T09:51:00.000Z	emoboy		or is there an easier way
2006-08-24T09:51:00.000Z	emoboy		im talking VM's in general, im actually using parallels
2006-08-24T09:52:00.000Z	emoboy		i want to install ubuntu
2006-08-24T09:52:00.000Z	emoboy		under windows using parallels

2006-08-24T09:53:00.000Z	emoboy		so i can partition during the install under parallels? and then install to the actual harddrive?
