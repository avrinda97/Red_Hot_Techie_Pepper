2006-10-13T15:16:00.000Z	sugoruyo		hey does someone know what i can do to get linux working on a P965 machine?
2006-10-13T15:17:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	if Edgy doesn;t work, then complain to Intel about their refusal to supply the FOSS community with worthwhile support.
2006-10-13T15:18:00.000Z	sugoruyo	mnepton	i'd go bash them with my expensive m/b
2006-10-13T15:18:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	it may be the best use yet of that north bridge ;)
2006-10-13T15:19:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	because Intel has not given the Linux community what we need to make the 965 work.
2006-10-13T15:20:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	this is why i'm an AMD user. i'm tired of Intel's crap.
2006-10-13T15:21:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	not much, other than tell Intel you have choices when buying software, and as a Linux user, they are making it hard to choose Intel.
2006-10-13T15:21:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	i don;t think you understand
2006-10-13T15:22:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	Intel has not supplied the code to make the 965 work in Linux. period. end of story. there is no workaround. there is no magic. there is only "the 965 does not work well with Linux"
2006-10-13T15:25:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	some of the 965 pieces work. some do not. the 965 has been nothing but a headache here.
2006-10-13T15:25:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	then good luck. i can guarantee the 965 will not be certified for Edgy.
2006-10-13T15:27:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	what part of "there is no good support for the 965 in the Linux kernel" is unclear. no one can help you. there is no fix. there is no silver bullet. only Intel has the answers, and they are not sharing.
2006-10-13T15:29:00.000Z	sugoruyo	mnepton	nothing is unclear
2006-10-13T15:29:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	then i'm confused as to why you would say "if anyone has something that could help..."
2006-10-13T15:30:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	believe what you want. but our testing has told us the 965 is not ready for Linux.
2006-10-13T15:31:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	we have been testing the 965 with Edgy and it is still a giant problem
2006-10-13T15:32:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	the. Linux. kernel. does. not. have. good. support. for. the. 965.
2006-10-13T15:32:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	Edgy is Linux. we didn;t write a different kernel for this release.
2006-10-13T15:33:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	some ports work, some do not. SATA1 is completely broken, SATA2 works fine. the IDE controller works. oh, wait, no it doesn't. now it's back. oops, gone again. oh, there goes SATA2. etc etc etc etc etc etc
2006-10-13T15:34:00.000Z	sugoruyo	mnepton	so there's general instability?
2006-10-13T15:34:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	not instability. outright "IT DOES NOT WORK"
2006-10-13T15:35:00.000Z	mnepton	sugoruyo	Intel has paid us to certify their hardware, and the 965 is going to fail, fail, fail. period. done. it is not ready for Linux.
