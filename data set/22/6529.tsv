2006-10-01T12:23:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	did you do sudo apt-get update and dist-upgrade?
2006-10-01T12:24:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	did you update?
2006-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	Yes i did a update
2006-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	and did you do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
2006-10-01T12:26:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	no, why ?
2006-10-01T12:26:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	because you added new repositories (from Breezy to Dapper) so the new packages should be installed first
2006-10-01T12:27:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	i think i did not do an upgrade from breezy to dapper
2006-10-01T12:28:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	have updated your sources.list like jrib told you?
2006-10-01T12:29:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	in that file it said breezy where it should be dapper. Now that is changed you have updated your sources.list to dapper
2006-10-01T12:29:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	you have to install the dapper version of the packages
2006-10-01T12:30:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	I created a source list on the website jrib gave me, and I pasted that in the sources.list file
2006-10-01T12:30:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	and have you saved the file?
2006-10-01T12:30:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	yes I saved the file
2006-10-01T12:31:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	but the file only contains breezy words, like in the following line:
2006-10-01T12:31:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	is that correct ?
2006-10-01T12:31:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	no
2006-10-01T12:32:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	did you use easysource?
2006-10-01T12:32:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	yes i used that, i forgot the set the dropdown box to dapper !
2006-10-01T12:33:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	well it's strange that the standard option is Breezy
2006-10-01T12:33:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	I'll give it another try
2006-10-01T12:36:00.000Z	Double1	KenSentMe	It all works fine now, thnx a lot
2006-10-01T12:37:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Double1	great, and have fun!
