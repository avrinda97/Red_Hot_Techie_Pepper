2006-10-16T15:00:00.000Z	sheriff		what r the diferrences between desktop cd and alternate cd?
2006-10-16T15:01:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	desktop cd is like a live cd where alternate cd is how debian install is
2006-10-18T08:04:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	yes what is wrong exactly
2006-10-18T08:05:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	i just downloaded java creator and installed it was working well but now it starts without any menu or screen
2006-10-18T08:06:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	: well after i had installed java installed beryl.. could it be the problem
2006-10-18T08:06:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	: yeah
2006-10-18T08:07:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	might be due to beryl but what do you see on the screen when Creator loads exactly?
2006-10-18T08:07:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	: just an empty form
2006-10-18T08:08:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	: it says it loads everything but nothing comes up except an empty form
2006-10-18T08:08:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	yeah probably a beryl problem
2006-10-18T08:11:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	sethk do you want the menu bar back sheriff?
2006-10-18T08:12:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	: well i disabled beryl but it still didnt work i guess i have to re-install it
2006-10-18T08:13:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	well you can use a shortcut probably but I don't know the exaact shortcuts of Creator
2006-10-18T08:25:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	what do u mean shortcut
2006-10-18T08:25:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	keys like Ctrl+N for new
2006-10-18T08:25:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	: ok i'll try
2006-10-18T08:26:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	it didnt work either
2006-10-18T08:27:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	there is another problem i have to set my keyboard layout everytime i reboot my computer. why is that
2006-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	your inputrc in /etc is probably setup to do that
2006-10-18T08:30:00.000Z	sheriff	kitche	: so lines should i change
2006-10-18T08:31:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	nevermind it's not /etc/inputrc hmm it could be /etc/profile or something
2006-10-18T08:31:00.000Z	kitche	sheriff	I never truly ran intot hat after an install
