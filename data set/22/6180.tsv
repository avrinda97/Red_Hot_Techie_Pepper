2006-12-08T07:28:00.000Z	damageDOn1		Hello I'm getting a permission denied error when I'm trying to copy a firefox profile from one machine to another. Does anyone know why that would happen or if there is a way around it?

2006-12-08T07:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	damageDOn1	Check the source and destination folder permissions.
2006-12-08T07:32:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	I am using sudo scp on the destination machine and I've tried changing the permissions with chown and chgrp on the source
2006-12-08T07:33:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	I know once I have the files copied across I need to change the permissions but I shouldn't be getting permission denied on the copying should I?
2006-12-08T07:34:00.000Z	dsnyders	damageDOn1	you will be getting those errors if the user you are logging in as does not have write permissions to the destination folder.
2006-12-08T07:38:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	I'm logging into the destination as the first user in ubuntu (which has all privileges) and I'm attempting to copy the firefox default profile from an old machine.
2006-12-08T07:38:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	I managed to copy all the evolution files with no problem
2006-12-08T07:41:00.000Z	dsnyders	damageDOn1	try reversing your connection.  Log into the destination machine and do the scp the other way.
2006-12-08T07:42:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	I am logged into the destination machine... Sorry I must have said the wrong thing before.
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	dsnyders	damageDOn1	No, it was probably me misinterpreting what you said.
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	hang on.... could it be that I need to put the use name of the user I'm copying the file from before the @ in the command? IOW if I'm copying a file from user 2 it should be scp -r user2@oldmachIP .....
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	I was putting user1@oldmachIP
2006-12-08T07:45:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	nope that didn't work either
2006-12-08T07:45:00.000Z	dsnyders	damageDOn1	yes, exactly.  If user1 does not have read permission to user2's files.
2006-12-08T07:46:00.000Z	dsnyders	damageDOn1	Is firefox in use on the source machine?
2006-12-08T07:47:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	& nothlit: I didn't fully understand the scp command. I get it now...
2006-12-08T07:48:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	& nothlit: I've got 2 new laptops. One for me and one for my girlfriend. I was trying to move my stuff (user1) and the command I was using was scp -r user1@oldmachIP.
2006-12-08T07:49:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	& nothlit: I forgot to change the command when I was trying to move her stuff from my old machine to her laptop to reflect that she was a different user (user2) so the command need to change to scp -r user2@....
2006-12-08T07:50:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	& nothlit: I just tried to run it and it didn't work at first because I had been messing with the permission on the old machine and need to put them back.
2006-12-08T07:50:00.000Z	damageDOn1	dsnyders	& nothlit: I've done it now and it all works
2006-12-08T07:50:00.000Z	dsnyders	damageDOn1	Wonderful!
