2008-02-28T07:35:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	they are both good
2008-02-28T07:36:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	Give virtualbox a go first IMO
2008-02-28T07:37:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	why ? I doubt it will see it if your host isn't seeing it
2008-02-28T07:37:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	it probably just isn't mounting
2008-02-28T07:37:00.000Z	s2a	ph0rensic	my host sees it no problem
2008-02-28T07:38:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	Oh ok,
2008-02-28T07:38:00.000Z	s2a	ph0rensic	so..any help plz :)
2008-02-28T07:39:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	with what?
2008-02-28T07:40:00.000Z	s2a	ph0rensic	i want virtualbox to see my 250 gb hd so i can use windows software that doesnt work with wine bcuz i have a skool project and need to use a windows app to make video files into iso for dvd that can be burnt, i tried linux apps and all had some sort of problem
2008-02-28T07:41:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	Oh i see.. umm i think you can mount a folder as a drive
2008-02-28T07:41:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	which the drive will be a folder under ubuntu (which is a file ...)
2008-02-28T07:42:00.000Z	s2a	ph0rensic	ok but how do i do that?
2008-02-28T07:43:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	ok one sec lemme look
2008-02-28T07:44:00.000Z	s2a	ph0rensic	thx alot
2008-02-28T07:45:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	no you have to download many codecs because they are non-free
2008-02-28T07:45:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	midi files may be different tho
2008-02-28T07:47:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	another idea is where it says Host cd/dvd-rom Drive, change that to your external
2008-02-28T07:47:00.000Z	s2a	ph0rensic	wait im almost done downloading and i think there is dependencies after :'( ALL ON DIAL-UP
2008-02-28T07:53:00.000Z	s2a	ph0rensic	k, now depencies r being downloaded and wen they're done ill get bak, k?
2008-02-28T07:54:00.000Z	ph0rensic	s2a	k
