2012-10-03T04:29:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa		sorry awc737, my network connection tanked. did more capable people jump on your problem?
2012-10-03T04:29:00.000Z	awc737	Cyberspaceloa	not yet
2012-10-03T04:33:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	have you determined whether the applications are still installed but maybe not showing up in your menu?
2012-10-03T04:33:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	I've noticed that some packages I've installed don't automatically show up in the Xubuntu menus
2012-10-03T04:34:00.000Z	awc737	Cyberspaceloa	what would ubu software center be called?
2012-10-03T04:35:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	have you tried to invoke it from the cli?
2012-10-03T04:36:00.000Z	awc737	Cyberspaceloa	chromium-browser is also listed, although it also disappeared from my main menu
2012-10-03T04:36:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	try calling one of the missing applications from the command line and see if it runs
2012-10-03T04:36:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	hopefully your menu is just misconfigured somehow
2012-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	still here
2012-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	what I dug up is that anything unchecked in tasksell gets uninstalled
2012-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	even if it's unrelated to what you think you're installing
2012-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1585015.html
2012-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	if you scroll down to slugslug's post: "and then a grep removed /var/log/dpgk showed me what I had to reinstall"
2012-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	please note I can't determine the probability of success, since I've never dealt with tasksel at all
2012-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	and I kind of have to leave right now
2012-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	you're welcome, I hope you get it worked out. I'll be back later on
2012-10-03T07:52:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	still with us?
2012-10-03T07:56:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	I'm on xubuntu 12.04 right now and I like it so far
2012-10-03T07:56:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	sounds like tasksel is an outdated tool
2012-10-03T07:57:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	if I recall, I thought there was a lamp meta package via apt?
2012-10-03T07:59:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	awc737	apparently you are correct. Am I crazy thinking there used to be a convenient lamp meta package in the official repos??
