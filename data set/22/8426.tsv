2007-11-08T02:46:00.000Z	Ongaku		does he need to have a program to see shared folders in Linux or should it just work?
2007-11-08T02:46:00.000Z	Ongaku		probably judg3
2007-11-08T02:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	Ongaku	what are you sharing the folder with? Samba?

2007-11-08T02:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	Ongaku	and he's using linux too? hmm.
2007-11-08T02:48:00.000Z	Ongaku		chousuke: no he isn't he's using Windows...i need to move alot of my crap from my windows partition, reformat totally to Linux, then move it all back
2007-11-08T02:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	Ongaku	I see.
2007-11-08T02:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	Ongaku	from windows you should be able to "connect to a network drive" or something I guess.
2007-11-08T02:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	Ongaku	I'm not really sure how it works.
2007-11-08T02:49:00.000Z	Chousuke		!samba | Ongaku
2007-11-08T02:49:00.000Z	Ongaku		i have samba i think

2007-11-08T02:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Ongaku	it's in all versions of ubuntu, though.
2007-11-08T02:51:00.000Z	Ongaku		chousuke: ah cool, he has a firewall and stuff but I can work around that...just need to disable it and connect to the network
2007-11-08T02:51:00.000Z	Ongaku		chousuke: my HDD is so small i can't just keep it on a lil partition so i have to move it over to his computer

2007-11-08T02:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	Ongaku	I have to sleep now though, so someone else will have to help you with that.
