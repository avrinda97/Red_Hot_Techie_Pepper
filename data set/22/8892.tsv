2005-04-29T07:16:00.000Z	Brunellus		whoa, there's a linux quicken?
2005-04-29T07:16:00.000Z	Brunellus		I didn't know that.
2005-04-29T07:17:00.000Z	Brunellus		link me to the linux quicken
2005-04-29T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	guncash, double entry bookkeeping
2005-04-29T07:18:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	reports suck, but it keeps _good_ books
2005-05-29T10:12:00.000Z	Brunellus	nickrud	 what's iowait?
2005-05-29T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	usually, it's excessive swap usage
2005-05-29T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	not to say getting a flood of answers, and getting it done :)
2005-08-10T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	if you want some to  have sudo privs, add them to th admin group
2005-08-10T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	LinuxDot, yes, I had it once where I was red :)
2005-08-10T11:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	it's in xchat's settings->preferences->interface-colors. I did that once.
2005-08-10T11:09:00.000Z	Brunellus	nickrud	 that shows me a table of colors with numbers
2005-11-23T06:45:00.000Z	Brunellus	nickrud	no, that didn't work
2005-11-23T06:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	most of the shortcuts were in metacity, I wasn't sure about run program
2005-11-23T06:46:00.000Z	Brunellus	nickrud	 do you know what the name of the program is, anyway?
2005-11-23T06:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	it wasn't a program, it was part of metacity, or the panel. not independent
2005-11-23T06:47:00.000Z	Brunellus	nickrud	 arse.
2005-11-23T06:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	when I used that I had it in a floating panel. ctl-alt-escape would focus it when I wanted it
2005-11-23T06:51:00.000Z	Brunellus	nickrud	 but that's all dependent on metacity
2005-11-23T06:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	no, panels are gnome panels, and, focus is, moved, by, the window manager .......
2005-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	Brunellus	nickrud	as I was saying:  focus is moved by the wm, so your keybinding wouldn't work
2005-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Brunellus	I remembered as I was typing ....
