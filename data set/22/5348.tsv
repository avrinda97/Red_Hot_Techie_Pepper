2007-10-26T04:23:00.000Z	hyper__ch	Malfist	you are really funny...
2007-10-26T04:23:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	thank you
2007-10-26T04:23:00.000Z	hyper__ch	Malfist	but you should read mor
2007-10-26T04:24:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	I should shouldn't I, too much homework
2007-10-26T04:24:00.000Z	hyper__ch	Malfist	yes, you should
2007-10-26T04:25:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	well, I've got to go to the library in about 5 minutes, I'll do some reading there
2007-10-26T04:26:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	please copy and paste your entire xorg.conf into IRC
2007-10-26T04:27:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	have you checked if alsa is reporting any errors?
2007-10-26T04:28:00.000Z	hyper__ch	Malfist	if you have no better advice then pasting the whole xorg.conf into irc that's not good... you should know that pastebins should be used for that
2007-10-26T04:29:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	I was commenting on your ability to paste that into IRC, I was being sarcastic when I said do the whole xorg.conf
2007-10-26T04:29:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	are you on a laptop?
2007-10-26T04:29:00.000Z	hyper__ch	Malfist	instead of trying to be sarcastic you shouldn't try to help at all... so far you have only been bullshitting in an official support channel
2007-10-26T04:29:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	I beg to differ
2007-10-26T04:30:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	I bugged you first as a joke, and then when you got mad I continued
2007-10-26T04:30:00.000Z	hyper__ch	Malfist	you don't get a concept of "support" channel, do you?
2007-10-26T04:30:00.000Z	Malfist	hyper__ch	take this to /m
