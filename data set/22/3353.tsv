2009-08-10T03:36:00.000Z	fynn		Hey. Two Installation questions:
2009-08-10T03:36:00.000Z	fynn		When I install Ubuntu from a CD, from scratch, it gives me the "Advanced Option" of not installing a boot loader. What are the advantages of that?
2009-08-10T03:38:00.000Z	fynn		in fact, I've asked the installer to wipe out the drive completely and install only Ubuntu on it.
2009-08-10T03:39:00.000Z	fynn		OK, that's something I want
2009-08-10T03:39:00.000Z	fynn		another question: I want to install Ubuntu as the only partition on the drive
2009-08-10T03:39:00.000Z	fynn		the problem is: Jaunty's installer only gives me 3 options
2009-08-10T03:40:00.000Z	fynn		1) install along the existing partitions, 2) "use the entire drive", 3) specify partitioning myself
2009-08-10T03:40:00.000Z	fynn		right, I want to, but I don't know how to set up things like swap partitions.
2009-08-10T03:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	use the full automatic "use the whole drive" if there is no data there you want to keep
2009-08-10T03:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	the installed will set up everything for you
2009-08-10T03:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	be sure to select the correct drive... (if there is more than one attached to the computer)
2009-08-10T03:42:00.000Z	fynn	erUSUL	yeah, I have two problems with that: I'd really like to _see_ what it's going to do, i.e. the full and exact partitioning plan it's going to apply to the drive.
2009-08-10T03:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	choose manual and do the partitions yourself
2009-08-10T03:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	one for root one for home an swap
2009-08-10T03:43:00.000Z	fynn	erUSUL	right, except I'd rather know what I need to do :)
2009-08-10T03:43:00.000Z	fynn	erUSUL	so 1 for /, one for /home, and one for swap... but how big should each be?
2009-08-10T03:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	 i would root == 15GiB swap = 1xram the rest for home
2009-08-10T03:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	15GiB is planty of room even 10 GiB will do if the disk is ot big
2009-08-10T03:45:00.000Z	fynn	erUSUL	thanks. is there a good URL with a guide about performing this partioning?
2009-08-10T03:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	i dunno from the top of my head
2010-05-02T22:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	either reinstall or do 9.04 --> 9.10 --> 10.04
2010-05-02T22:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	fynn	yes;
