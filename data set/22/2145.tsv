2011-08-01T07:54:00.000Z	lsv		would there be any explanation as to why my wireless card would disappear after rebooting?
2011-08-01T07:55:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	Did someone steal it?
2011-08-01T07:55:00.000Z	lsv		lol
2011-08-01T07:56:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	hehe
2011-08-01T07:56:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	Sorry, just checking the obvious. lol
2011-08-01T07:56:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	Seriously though, what do you mean by "dissappear"?
2011-08-01T07:56:00.000Z	lsv	TrentonAdams	I'm pretty sure, the card is still there
2011-08-01T07:57:00.000Z	lsv		the computer wont find it
2011-08-01T07:57:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	"ifconfig -a" show anything?
2011-08-01T07:57:00.000Z	lsv		I turn off the computer, let me boot it up
2011-08-01T07:58:00.000Z	lsv	TrentonAdams	It is back :D
2011-08-01T07:58:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	hmm, that is very odd.  Sounds almost like a driver bug or system bug of some sort.
2011-08-01T07:58:00.000Z	lsv		the problem now is I need to make it work
2011-08-01T07:58:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	next time try restarting it in the connection applet
2011-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	hopefully there won't be a next time though p)
2011-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	lsv	TrentonAdams	I'm trying to set up the card, but I have no luck.
2011-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	oh, why not?
2011-08-01T08:00:00.000Z	lsv	TrentonAdams	I don't know, I get all sort of weird msg.
2011-08-01T08:00:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	Hmm, probably can't help you there then.  I'm no expert on wirless cards in linux
2011-08-01T08:01:00.000Z	lsv	TrentonAdams	Noooooooooooooooooooooooo!!  I mean, no problem, thanks :D
2011-08-01T08:01:00.000Z	TrentonAdams	lsv	I was hoping it would just be a module not loading, which I could help you with. :P
2011-08-01T08:02:00.000Z	lsv	TrentonAdams	thanks.
