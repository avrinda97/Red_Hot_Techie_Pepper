2011-08-12T21:12:00.000Z	Shadowwolf		And I'm not quite sure what you mean.
2011-08-12T21:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	I would just tell the Ubuntu installer to use the available free space.
2011-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	Do you have another OS which hasn't been deleted, like Windows, which you would like to be able to boot?
2011-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	That can be fixed without installing Ubuntu (though installing Ubuntu will also fix it).
2011-08-12T21:19:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	well, how else can i fix it considering I don't have the windows 7 CD?
2011-08-12T21:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	You can restore a Microsoft style MBR using an Ubuntu LiveCD.
2011-08-12T21:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	sudo software-properties-gtk -e universe && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mbr && sudo install-mbr /dev/sda
2011-08-12T21:21:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	alright. So, I just do those in Terminal, and then restart?
2011-08-12T21:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	Keeping in mind that the device, "/dev/sda" was only a guess (should be your first hard drive, but you should check) and that whatever device you choose it should *NOT* have a number after it, so "/dev/sdb" might be right but *NOT* "/dev/sdb1".
2011-08-12T21:23:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	I tried the second command, and I got a bunch of "Failed to fetch" errors. :(
2011-08-12T21:25:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	same thing happened with mbr.
2011-08-12T21:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	You need to be connnected to the internet.
2011-08-12T21:27:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	yeah, sorry.
2011-08-12T21:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	np :)
2011-08-12T21:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	Were you able to connect to the internet and follow my instructions?
2011-08-12T21:42:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	alright. Commands executed. :D
2011-08-12T21:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	Try rebooting.
2011-08-12T21:43:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	rebooting now..
2011-08-12T21:44:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	^
2011-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	This is now a better question for ##windows.
2011-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	Shadowwolf	Jordan_U	alright. THanks for the help.
2011-08-12T21:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Shadowwolf	You're welcome.
