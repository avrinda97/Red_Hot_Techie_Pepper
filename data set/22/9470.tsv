2005-02-20T10:33:00.000Z	Dethread		is there a way to burn audio cds using the nautilus-cd-burner?
2005-02-20T10:33:00.000Z	Dethread		:(
2005-02-20T10:33:00.000Z	Dethread		ok, thanks
2005-02-20T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	or try graveman or k3b
2005-02-20T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	I agree!
2005-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	oh...
2005-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	it's in Hoary too
2005-02-20T10:43:00.000Z	Dethread	tritium	now...when trying to install graveman from hoary, it also wants to update/install a bunch of packages...is this safe to do with me running warty?
2005-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	depends on your level of comfort with using Hoary packages.
2005-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	apt-get source --build it
2005-02-20T10:46:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	you sometimes need some build dependencies too
2005-02-20T10:47:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	no, you'll be building a Warty package
2005-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	try to install those same packages from warty
2005-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	do an "apt-get build-dep graveman -s" to simulate the action
2005-03-26T08:59:00.000Z	Dethread	tritium	it is more focused on team interactions and the process of designing, developing and maintaining software, while CS is more on algorithms
2005-03-26T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	crimsun cool.  Thanks for the info.
2005-03-26T09:01:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	k3b, gnomebaker, graveman
2005-03-26T09:01:00.000Z	Dethread	tritium	it's an ongoing process....I believe SE has its place among other engineering disciplines
2005-03-26T09:01:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	possibly, but as an EE, I'd like to see it in IEEE as well
2005-03-26T09:05:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	good luck in your interview!
2005-03-26T09:05:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	oh...I hope you get good news :)
2005-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	tritium	Dethread	I have family on my wife's side that work there.
