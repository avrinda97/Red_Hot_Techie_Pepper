2008-11-15T03:03:00.000Z	bushwacker		Hello when I am installing Ubuntu with a minimal install CD, it gets to "Installing base system" and stops at "retrieving glibz1" or along the lines. Why is this and how can I fix it?
2008-11-15T03:04:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	have you checked the md5sum before burning ?
2008-11-15T03:04:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	i used the Check CD for Defects option
2008-11-15T03:35:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	that usually happens when the installer is unable to contact the mirrors to check for updates
2008-11-15T03:35:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	what should I do?
2008-11-15T03:35:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	are you using the alternate installer ?
2008-11-15T03:36:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	yes I am
2008-11-15T03:36:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	when I had the problem in the past, I have switchted to another console with CTRL-ALT-FN
2008-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	in the alternate install?
2008-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	then I have checked the apt upadte pid with "ps -ef", and killed, the install process just resumed
2008-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	yes
2008-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	and that workeD? I will try thank you
2008-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	you have a console that you can use for interactive commands, not sure which Fn is it
2008-11-15T03:39:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	what exactly should I type in? theres over 300 things in ps aux
2008-11-15T03:40:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	ps -ef | grep apt
2008-11-15T03:41:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	umm would it be called apt-setup?
2008-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	probably
2008-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	its not there, but log-ouput -t apt-setup is
2008-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	there must be a process running that is printing that "check for mirrors message"
2008-11-15T03:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	did you kill it, or just timed out ?
2008-11-15T03:44:00.000Z	bushwacker	joaopinto	maybe the servers are loaded down and its just taking forever?
2008-11-15T03:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	bushwacker	could be, or your network was not properly setup, on my case it was a LAN without connectivity to the mirrors...
