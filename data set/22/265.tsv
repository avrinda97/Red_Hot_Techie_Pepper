2012-02-12T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	what is the question ?
2012-02-12T17:58:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	ignore what Kartagis has said
2012-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	when ubuntu packages udates, they will be released by update manager
2012-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	so as updates become available you'll be notified via update manager
2012-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	NoetGoed	ikonia	where do I find that?
2012-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	it will pop up on screen when you login saying "ubuntu has 10 updates available for you" or words to that effect
2012-02-12T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	open the update manager gui
2012-02-12T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	it will basically run those commands in the background as it opens
2012-02-12T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	what language is your ubuntu system in ?
2012-02-12T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	what version of ubuntu is this ?
2012-02-12T18:02:00.000Z	NoetGoed	ikonia	11.10 latest afaik
2012-02-12T18:02:00.000Z	NoetGoed	ikonia	ok, you are still using an older version?
2012-02-12T18:03:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	I'm not using ubuntu at the moment
2012-02-12T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	the desktop team
2012-02-12T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	there will be updates then there are updates "needed"
2012-02-12T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	which security features do you want from 10.0.1
2012-02-12T18:07:00.000Z	NoetGoed	ikonia	https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox.html
2012-02-12T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	that is 1
2012-02-12T18:09:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	it doesn't look like a common issue, it actually looks reasonably low risk, although high in effect
2012-02-12T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	nothing to do with ubuntu so not valid for this channel,
2012-02-12T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	NoetGoed	not a problem
