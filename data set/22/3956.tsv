2008-05-16T07:55:00.000Z	cypha		how much space should i leave for my ubuntu install?
2008-05-16T07:56:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	It depends. How are you planning on partitioning?
2008-05-16T07:57:00.000Z	cypha	RyanPrior	i'm going to shrink the volume on vista, and then i dunno, format it from there as well
2008-05-16T07:57:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	Are you planning on storing your documents on the NTFS partition?
2008-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	cypha	RyanPrior	yes
2008-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	In that case you should probably just give Ubuntu about 10-20GB and symlink /home/cypha to /your/windows/drive/Documents and Settings/cypha/My Documents
2008-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	cypha	RyanPrior	so you think 10 gigs is enough then?
2008-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	it depends on whether you want to install a ton of Linux programs and games or not.
2008-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	If you aren't going to install many new programs, 10 should be fine. I install many, so I use 20 for my root partition.
2008-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	thanks for asking though. :-)
2008-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	we're here for newbie questions. :-)
2008-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	It's hard to adjust later, but may be possible.
2008-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	You adjust your partition sizes a lot on Windows?
2008-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	It's easy to shrink partitions, but it's hard to grow them sometimes.
2008-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	It's hard to grow them "backwards" on the disk.
2008-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	And it's easy to remove from the end of a partition, but hard to move it "forward".
2008-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	If your partition table is like this: [--------], it's easy to shrink it like this: [----     ]
2008-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	But it's hard to shrink it like this: [    -----]
2008-05-16T08:08:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	I doubt you'll run out of space with 15G.
2008-05-16T08:09:00.000Z	cypha	RyanPrior	cool! thanks, exactly what i wanted to hear
2008-05-16T08:11:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	Good luck. :-)
2008-05-16T08:15:00.000Z	RyanPrior	cypha	I'm not sure precisely what you'rea asking.
