2007-11-18T15:03:00.000Z	cowbud		the xkb thing is usually X detects something different than what gnome's set to use as far as a keyboard
2007-11-18T15:03:00.000Z	cowbud		now login
2007-11-18T15:03:00.000Z	cowbud		you can't just click OK?
2007-11-18T15:04:00.000Z	cowbud		cause that shouldn't stop you from logging in
2007-11-18T15:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	actually if you've done some pretty far-reaching changes, you do need to rebooot
2007-11-18T15:05:00.000Z	cowbud	gordonjcp	yeah if you updated the kernel that's it
2007-11-18T15:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	heh
2007-11-18T15:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	and clients that actually work with ssid turned off
2007-11-18T15:09:00.000Z	cowbud	gordonjcp	that to
2007-11-18T15:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	very few cards and drivers won't totally keech themselves at a lack of ssid
2007-11-18T15:09:00.000Z	cowbud	gordonjcp	keech eh
2007-11-18T15:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	I think beowulf is pretty obsolete now ;-)
2007-11-18T15:26:00.000Z	cowbud	gordonjcp	really what took that badness over?
2007-11-18T15:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	aw, loads of different things
2007-11-18T15:26:00.000Z	cowbud	gordonjcp	huh yeah never ran that
2007-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	I had a four machine Beowulf cluster in about 1999
2007-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	cowbud	gordonjcp	how did that work out?
2007-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	it was pretty cool actually
2007-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	writing cluster-aware proggies was tricky
2007-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	cowbud	gordonjcp	I bet
2007-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	now my PDA is probably faster than the whole cluster
2007-11-18T15:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cowbud	/ RandomPerson - I'm planning on getting some of the 150 quid Tesco PCs and basically just giving away the 80G drives and fitting a bunch of 320G drives and decent network cards inside
