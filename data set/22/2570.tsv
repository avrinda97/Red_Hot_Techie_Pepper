2009-05-11T21:34:00.000Z	Celauran	needhelp1	It's just a log from apt-get
2009-05-11T21:34:00.000Z	needhelp1		so its safe ?
2009-05-11T21:34:00.000Z	Celauran	needhelp1	Yeah, it's just a log of what has been installed
2009-05-11T21:35:00.000Z	Celauran	needhelp1	if apt-get is producing errors, they should be there
2009-05-11T21:35:00.000Z	Celauran	needhelp1	Otherwise, just try installing again and copy the errors from the terminal
