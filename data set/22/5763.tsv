2009-10-18T11:20:00.000Z	panfist		i installed some packages and my system fails to boot; it seems that when the splash screen is about to chnage to the system log in prompt, it gets distorted and then hangs. i can choose recovery mode from the grub menu and get a terminal. how can i fix my graphic envrionment?
2009-10-18T11:22:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 in the terminal   try   sudo /init.d/gdm stop   then   sudo apt-get update   then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-10-18T11:22:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 then   sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-10-18T11:23:00.000Z	panfist	coz_	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade didn't do anything
2009-10-18T11:23:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 did sudo apt-get update  run through?
2009-10-18T11:24:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 ok   one more time  time sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  if that doesn work again   then try   sudo  /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-10-18T11:25:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 ok which video card are you using
2009-10-18T11:26:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 nvidia ?
2009-10-18T11:30:00.000Z	panfist	coz_	i tired /etc/init.d/gdm restart and my system locked like it did from a normal boot. i rebooted and within recovery mode did an "xfix" to attempt to automatically fix the problem. i resumed normal boot, and saw something like: "DKMS auto installation .... for fglrx: fail" as the mesg was scrolling...then it crashed again.
2009-10-18T11:31:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 looks like a bad install of the ati driver  ?
2009-10-18T11:32:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	  you could try reverting to the default driver  but with ati i am not sure how that is done in the xorg
2009-10-18T11:32:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	  I am sure someone here more familiar with ati   can help
2010-08-23T04:00:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 I do not
2011-03-14T20:45:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 which video card?
2011-03-14T20:46:00.000Z	panfist	coz_	amd 3450 integrated
2011-03-14T20:46:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 mm  darn I know nothing of ati   ,,,  or how to adjust resolutions
2011-03-14T20:46:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	  did you also try in the #radeon channel?
2011-03-14T20:47:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 there is likely a utility for ati onlinux
2011-05-25T11:53:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	  yes  there is a small utility name   y-ppa-manager
2011-05-25T11:53:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 I dont think it is in the repositoreis
2011-05-25T11:53:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	 also it is not to search for packages within existing repositories
2011-05-25T11:54:00.000Z	coz_	panfist	   sudo apt-cache search name of package
