2009-11-06T20:06:00.000Z	racerx		if i encrypted my hard drive when I install ubuntu 9.04 and now want to install 9.10, would there be a problem if I did not want my home partition to be reformated?

2009-11-06T20:09:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	if you encryted your home then you must have a backup of it so go and upgrade
2009-11-06T20:09:00.000Z	racerx	rictec	if i want to do a fresh install w/o deleting my /home partition.
2009-11-06T20:09:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	i cant remember when i re-formated my home.....never do that
2009-11-06T20:10:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	my home is on another disk
2009-11-06T20:11:00.000Z	racerx	rictec	I don't want to reformat my /home. I just want to reformat the other partition.
2009-11-06T20:11:00.000Z	racerx		rictec; I have only one disk on my laptop.
2009-11-06T20:11:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	i never do that since 7.10 i think
2009-11-06T20:11:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	is /home on another partition?
2009-11-06T20:12:00.000Z	racerx	rictec	yes
2009-11-06T20:12:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	 then dont reformat
2009-11-06T20:12:00.000Z	racerx		I just want to clean it up
2009-11-06T20:12:00.000Z	racerx		I just want to reformat the other partition.
2009-11-06T20:13:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	you canot go two ways at the same time
2009-11-06T20:13:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	save that you really need from /home and burn it down lol
2009-11-06T20:13:00.000Z	racerx	rictec	but if I do reformat the other partition except for my /home partition and the /home partition is encrypted, will everything be ok? that is the quesstion,.
2009-11-06T20:14:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	i thin it will
2009-11-06T20:15:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	 i dont really know why the home is encrypted but if files are important you have a backup right?
2009-11-06T20:15:00.000Z	racerx	rictec	another reason for doing this is because every once i a while I get a read-only system on my harddrive.
2009-11-06T20:16:00.000Z	racerx		yes, I have an external harddrive that I back up my stuff to.
2009-11-06T20:16:00.000Z	rictec	racerx	check smartdrive is enable on bios of the machine is a early warning of hard disk going bananas
