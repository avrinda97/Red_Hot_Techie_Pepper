2011-06-28T11:50:00.000Z	westz		*i just need to redirect vidalia
2011-06-28T11:51:00.000Z	westz		archive i downloaded from? i didnt download it myself, i used the USC
2011-06-28T11:52:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	well that is wrong
2011-06-28T11:32:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	I had no trouble installing vidalia
2011-06-28T11:33:00.000Z	westz	noisewaterphd	what release? (of ubuntu)
2011-06-28T11:33:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	in the bin folder of vidalia there is a startup script that launches a preconfiged firefox along with tor and vidalia
2011-06-28T11:33:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	10.10
2011-06-28T11:35:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	App directory, not bin, sorry
2011-06-28T11:36:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	so just download, extract, put it wherever you want it, and launch the vidalia script from the comand line
2011-06-28T11:36:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	the tor executable is in the same directory, so launch from in that dir
2011-06-28T11:37:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	or put that dir on your path
2011-06-28T11:48:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	hang on, I'll pastebin some instructions for you
2011-06-28T11:49:00.000Z	westz	noisewaterphd	i know how it works, something's got an error somewhere. if your tor is in /usr/bin then something borked when i installed vidalia, if its not, i just need the tor executable
2011-06-28T11:51:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	tor and vidalia executables are in the same directory together in the extracted folder from the archive you downloaded. there is nothing in usr/bin. I am pastebin you directions on how to set up your path
2011-06-28T11:51:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	but if you dont want it, ive got other stuff to do
2011-06-28T11:53:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	are you running 64bit or 32?
2011-06-28T11:53:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	download it here: https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/linux/tor-browser-gnu-linux-i686-1.1.11-dev-en-US.tar.gz and extract it to wherever you want it
2011-06-28T11:55:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	you arent compiling anything
2011-06-28T11:55:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	just extract the archive
2011-06-28T12:02:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	westz	here follow these directions: http://pastebin.com/ajJBgReX
