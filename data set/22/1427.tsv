2010-10-01T18:49:00.000Z	agentgasmask		Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone could point me to an explenation of why compiled source is specific to each machine. Or is it? Can you compile source on one machine for use on another machine (just copying the binaries)?
2010-10-01T18:50:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	it depends how you compile it
2010-10-01T18:51:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	hmm, Can you give me some buzz wards that I can google to learn more?
2010-10-01T18:51:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	you could tell the compiler to use some instructions that is only available on your CPU,  but not others, hence the compiled binary can only be executed on your cpu
2010-10-01T18:51:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	you could also tell the compiler to use generic instructions that works for all cpu
2010-10-01T18:52:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	like this http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gcc-optimization.xml
2010-10-01T18:52:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	would that disicion be mad in the source or on the command line at compile time?
2010-10-01T18:52:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	not the source, but how you compile it
2010-10-01T18:53:00.000Z	agentgasmask		 icarus-c ok, cool! Thanks
2010-10-01T18:53:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	so if you had two of the same machines, you could compile any way and still copy between systems?
2010-10-01T18:54:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	yes.
2010-10-01T18:54:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	it is just about cpu model
2010-10-01T18:55:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	that is the only thing that separates computers?
2010-10-01T18:55:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	like, core2,  pentium4, athlon64....etc
2010-10-01T18:55:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	Right. Thanks! :)
2010-10-01T18:55:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	different cpu family has different features and instructions.
2010-10-01T18:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	you could optimize for one to make it run faster on that specific cpu,  but may not run at all on other cpu
2010-10-01T18:58:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	can you optimize for another cpu other than the in the computer you compile on so it can be used on a slower one?
2010-10-01T18:58:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	yes i think. never tried though
2010-10-01T18:58:00.000Z	icarus-c	agentgasmask	but you can't use gcc's "native" autodetection
2010-10-01T18:59:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	I think the term "cpu optimize" for google will do nicely! :)
2010-10-01T19:00:00.000Z	agentgasmask	icarus-c	could you use the "native" command on the other machine just to dump the options to use on the compile machine?
