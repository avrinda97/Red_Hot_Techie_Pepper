2006-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	tlouden		so, anybody know how to fix fglrx problems (like it not loading)
2006-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	how'd you install?
2006-06-04T13:15:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	installed in 5.10 and upgraded to 6.06 (also tried full removal and reinstall)
2006-06-04T13:15:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	which fglrx driver though?  the official one or the repos one?
2006-06-04T13:15:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	repos
2006-06-04T13:16:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	k, what do you mean by not loading
2006-06-04T13:17:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	glxinfo and fglrxinfo report sgi/mesa and no acceleration
2006-06-04T13:18:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	have you done a reboot yet to load the module?
2006-06-04T13:18:00.000Z	tlouden		yeah
2006-06-04T13:18:00.000Z	tlouden		the module is loaded (as per lsmod and modprobe just in case)
2006-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	have you added it to /etc/modules and changed xorg.conf ?
2006-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	oh ok
2006-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	xorg.conf has fglrx in place of ati and such
2006-06-04T13:20:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	read /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-06-04T13:20:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	it should say you're using fglrx for one.  two...look for errors
2006-06-04T13:20:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	it warns that desktop setting is invalid (it is set to null)
2006-06-04T13:22:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	i don't know what that means :/-
2006-06-04T13:22:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	have you tried doing the official driver?
2006-06-04T13:22:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	yeah, that's about where I'm stuck too.  problem is, there isn't any obvious problem until you go to use GL
2006-06-04T13:23:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	no, i guess that's next
2006-06-04T13:24:00.000Z	tlouden	orbin	thanks for trying
2006-06-04T13:24:00.000Z	orbin	tlouden	sorry i couldn't help more
