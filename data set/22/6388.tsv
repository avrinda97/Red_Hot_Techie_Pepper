2007-01-07T09:05:00.000Z	amir	reverseblade	remove ubuntu compleatly because I can't install xp without removing ubuntu, Why i want to remove it, its because of a game I can't play in ubuntu
2007-01-07T09:06:00.000Z	reverseblade	amir	what you have to do , is to have some unparitined space to install windows, and install it there. If you are too much confused, this way is easier , first install windows andthen install ubuntu
