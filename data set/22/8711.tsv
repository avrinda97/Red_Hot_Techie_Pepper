2006-10-28T13:23:00.000Z	ra21vi		can u help me setup my pen-tablets
2006-10-28T13:23:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	you should just need the "wacom-tools" package
2006-10-28T13:24:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	ya i installed that
2006-10-28T13:24:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	but there is no /dev/input/wacom
2006-10-28T13:24:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	is this a tablet laptop or a usb kind?
2006-10-28T13:25:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	its usb tablet.. with a Pen :)
2006-10-28T13:25:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	lemme find you a wiki page
2006-10-28T13:25:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	ok,
2006-10-28T13:25:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	is it a wacom?
2006-10-28T13:26:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	i dont know that, and i seached to find if it has the wacom chip... but googling says that most of them uses wacom chip
2006-10-28T13:27:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	its a i-pen
2006-10-28T13:27:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	well, it seems like there may be linux drivers
2006-10-28T13:28:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	um, i already have installed xorg-wacom input driver, what more will i have to look for
2006-10-28T13:29:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	hopefully, thats all you need. there's a common problem with /dev/wacom being not correct.
2006-10-28T13:29:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wacom
2006-10-28T13:29:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	ok, let me try some hacks :)) and i m sure, i will be back with messy system, as i do always
2006-10-28T13:30:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	u know, how much stupid i am,,,,, i installed the driver,and searching for the /dev/input/wacom... which is maintained by udev,, and me stupid has not connected the tablet yet
2006-10-28T13:31:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	i dont have that problem, my tablet is built into the monitor ;)
2006-10-28T13:31:00.000Z	jldugger	ra21vi	how long ago did you get that ipen?
2006-10-28T13:32:00.000Z	ra21vi	jldugger	 2 years ago... , and was kept just, now i got some work to do with it
