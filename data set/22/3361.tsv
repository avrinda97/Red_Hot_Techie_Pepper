2008-09-28T08:33:00.000Z	DigitalFiz		anyone ever get counter-strike or any steam games running in ubuntu?
2008-09-28T08:33:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	yes. It's in the winehq AppDB
2008-09-28T08:36:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	never heard of it. Try google for that and add ubuntu in the end. Someone else might have add the same problem as you and registered it somewhere
2008-09-28T08:37:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	yeah ive found a few posts and people seem to be able to get it working i think but doing what they did doesnt work for me so i think mine might be a slightly different peice of hardware or something
2008-09-28T08:39:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	or maybe you're just doing something wrong. Don't they give the supposed output of lsusb to make sure it's the same hardware?
2008-09-28T08:41:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=662531 is what i been using to help its in the archive so i even posted a new thread and referenced it at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=924504 to see if i could get any additional help
2008-09-28T08:42:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	there is no lsusb on those pages wish there was
2008-09-28T08:43:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	i did however provide mine because as you did i though it was useful information
2008-09-28T08:45:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	one thing that may not solve your problem, but it may if enough people do it, is mail the guys that build that piece of hardware and ask for help on installing in Linux
2008-09-28T08:46:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	good idea i didnt think of that. I'm almost to the point of paying someone to make it work lol. I'm trying to get a video podcast going and id rather not dual boot windows to do it
2008-09-28T08:47:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	from what I read it seems you have to compile them. I have no idea what to do with that. I don't even have a webcam, so I never had problems that relate in some way to it
2008-09-28T08:50:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	thank you for all your help, this channel is pretty busy its hard to get focussed help your pretty good at focussing on A LOT of people at once hehe
2008-09-28T08:50:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	helps when people use my nick in the messages and if you have a properly configurated IRC client
2008-09-28T09:38:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	do you know if its possible to use the windows driver like you can for wifi cards?
2008-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	yes. It's called ndiswrapper
2008-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	wait. Sorry
2008-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	does ndiswrapper work for more then wifi cards?
2008-09-28T09:40:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	sorry, I thought you were asking to use windows wifi drivers in Ubuntu (which is what I'm helping a guy within pm). It's also 5h30am where I live and I didn't read your message well
2008-09-28T09:41:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	carandraug	hehe no problem man you've been a big help so far. it seems the manufacture doesnt even list this device on there site anymore so i have no idea what ill get as a response from them
2008-09-29T08:19:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	try "alsmixer" in a terminal and try tab to see if there's more bars that don't appear at first
2008-09-29T08:23:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	but it can be another volume bar, whose existence you are unaware of that is set too low (my sound card varies sound based on 5 bars)
2008-09-29T08:25:00.000Z	carandraug	DigitalFiz	but I remember a line I once added to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base that supposedly reduces noise. However, it may dependent on the sound card
