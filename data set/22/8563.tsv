2005-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	acid2		Hi, does anyone know any software for linux that teaches 10 finger typing?
2005-08-09T09:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	acid2	KTouch
2005-08-09T09:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	acid2	the best way to learn to touch type is to do just this, though: (i) use the correct fingers for the correct keys, (ii) bring your fingers back once you hit each key, (iii) *always* use this method, and never revert despite it being unbelievably slow at first
2005-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	acid2	apokryphos	well yea - but I need to actyually learn which finger goes where ^_^
2005-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	acid2	and finally, (iv) look at the keys all the time at the beginning. Don't worry about typing without looking at the keys -- that comes without you knowing. These points, and you have it.
2005-08-09T09:55:00.000Z	acid2	apokryphos	cool, thanks for those tips :)
2005-08-09T09:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	acid2	Sure. I just meant that a lot of the time these typing programs can be useless/annoying. All you need is practice.
2005-08-09T09:55:00.000Z	acid2	apokryphos	ah, I just want to make it fun while I start
2005-08-09T09:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	acid2	which finger to use is pretty basic; two index fingers on F and J respectively. Some are questoinable, but the proper method you can find out from the Internet, for sure.
2005-08-09T09:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	acid2	I know, but it'll likely be slightly annoying/dull at first -- seems so slow. That's why so many people don't get into it; they can't get past the first stage. :|
