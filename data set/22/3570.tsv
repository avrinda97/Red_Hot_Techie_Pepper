2009-01-07T19:34:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		i installed kdm in the morning and now i see that running sudo konqueror gives No protocol specified
2009-01-07T19:34:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		konqueror: cannot connect to X server :0.0
2009-01-07T19:34:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		how to fix this ?
2009-01-07T19:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	sudo konq is a bad idea
2009-01-07T19:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	kdesu konq..  is better but still dangerous
2009-01-07T19:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	sudo  gui apps will eventually catch up to you
2009-01-07T19:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	kdesu konq..  is better but still dangerous
2009-01-07T19:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	If you have made a habit of running gui apps with sudo..  you can do serious damage to your setup
2009-01-07T19:38:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Jack_Sparrow	why ?
2009-01-07T19:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	Please read the link on gksudo for pyschocats informative description
2009-01-07T19:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	sudo su is another bad idea
2009-01-07T19:39:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Jack_Sparrow	whatever ... right now i need to run a few apps with root access
2009-01-07T19:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	Failing because of your previous usage of sudo su and sudo guiapp
2009-01-07T20:06:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Jack_Sparrow	hi i want to fix sudo guiapp
2009-01-07T20:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	Sorry, cant help you there
2009-01-19T19:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	gimpshop  but you will need to find that on your own
2009-01-19T19:24:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Jack_Sparrow	gimshop is not there or i didnt get the right version for ubuntu 8.04   ...
2009-01-19T19:37:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Jack_Sparrow	using gimpshop its easy to draw shapes ?
2009-01-19T19:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	silv3r_m00n	I think it is just more of a skin for gim that puts the commands where photoshop people are used to seeing them
2009-01-19T19:38:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Jack_Sparrow	yes
