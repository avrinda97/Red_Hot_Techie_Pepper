2006-03-07T16:07:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	i'm not sure what the problem is
2006-03-07T16:07:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	where you installing anything just prior to that?
2006-03-07T16:08:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	could you have installed something that changed your network settings?

2006-03-07T16:10:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	possibly..do you really need it?
2006-03-07T16:11:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	I would have a bit of a read about TOR and how it works to make sure you have it set up right
2006-03-07T16:11:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	there is a thread in the ubuntu forums on the subject
2006-03-07T16:11:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	try in the tips tricks and customisation section
2006-03-07T16:12:00.000Z	mustard5	p4t	you can do a search on the forums using the keywords tor privoxy
2006-03-07T16:14:00.000Z	p4t	mustard5	can u give me the link of the ubuntu forum?
