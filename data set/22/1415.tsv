2010-07-02T11:28:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	Ha, hardcore.
2010-07-02T11:36:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	He probably got dropped somehow.  Hang in there.
2010-07-02T11:36:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	If you're talking about the link he gave you, it's referring to your /etc/network/interfaces file.
2010-07-02T11:37:00.000Z	hopeless8009	maxwellian	i have never edit a file nor opened one in termenal
2010-07-02T11:39:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	You'll be okay, don't worry. :)  If you do set about editing it, we'll have you make a backup first.
2010-07-02T11:40:00.000Z	hopeless8009	maxwellian	it would be great if you could walk me thow this
2010-07-02T11:40:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	I'd love to, but I don't know how to set up the network with that file. :\
2010-07-02T15:09:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	Try apt-get --download-only wicd
2010-07-02T15:12:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	No, unless this is some kind of messed up Fight Club remake.
2010-07-02T15:12:00.000Z	hopeless8009	maxwellian	where will they be after they are downlaoded
2010-07-02T15:13:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	The .deb file will be in the current directory, meaning the directory you were in when you ran the command.
2010-07-02T15:14:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	What happened?
2010-07-02T15:14:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	Bah, I gave you the wrong syntax.
2010-07-02T15:15:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	What he said. :)  Don't know if --download-only needs to go earlier or not.
2010-07-02T15:20:00.000Z	hopeless8009	maxwellian	I understand root i am a noob but i do have a degree in this
2010-07-02T15:27:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	Download the .deb the same way you did the other one.
2010-07-02T15:30:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	You moved the .deb file onto an external drive from your Internet-ready machine, moved the drive over to the server, and now you want to unmount the drive from the server?
2010-07-02T15:40:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	He's clearly still here, helping 15 people at a time...takes a minute. :)
2010-07-03T00:14:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	Wow, you're still here. :)  Did you get your server wireless?
2010-07-03T00:22:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	Did you get the wireless going from a few hours ago?
2010-07-03T00:28:00.000Z	maxwellian	hopeless8009	What are you trying to do?
2010-07-03T01:12:00.000Z	hopeless8009	maxwellian	you got a min
