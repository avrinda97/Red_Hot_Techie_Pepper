2006-07-24T05:46:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke		Problem with my clock.. it is 4hrs off and I can not change it..
2006-07-24T05:46:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	man date
2006-07-24T05:46:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	Bison	?
2006-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	you have to set the date using the cli app date
2006-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	did you try that?
2006-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	Bison	I don't understand.. I am new.
2006-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	alright I'll explain
2006-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	to set the time you type this
2006-07-24T05:48:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	sudo date MMDDHHMM
2006-07-24T05:49:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	does that make sense?
2006-07-24T05:49:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke		Sort of..
2006-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	example: date 07230755
2006-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	Bison	 But what caused it to change, and will it ever come around to sync with internet servers like I chose?
2006-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	you have it set to sync with internet servers? How in the world did you do that?
2006-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	are you dual booting with windows?
2006-07-24T05:51:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	Bison	 No, OSx
2006-07-24T05:51:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	I don't know about OSX, but I do know that Windows doesn't play well with others...it will change your hardware clock to your local time
2006-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	Bison	Gun_Smoke	So that may have changed it, if you booted in to OSX
2006-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	Bison		sorry i gotta run
2006-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	Bison		take care
2006-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	Bison	 Well NOW i was able to change the time... just a couple of hours ago I wasn't.  All of the menus were not available to me.. They just weren't there.. If I choose "adjust date and time" prompted for password, it would fail.
2006-07-24T05:54:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	Bison	 I figured it had something to do with most of Ubuntu's servers being down.
