2012-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	thanks again.
2012-09-04T04:28:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	could I suggest checking kern.log for clues about the disc's insertion, or read errors, etc?
2012-09-04T04:29:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	you could to jamar. He has the problem, and I would love any suggestions I can get. :)
2012-09-04T04:30:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	I was going to have him run dmesg | grep sr0 and see if it says device not ready.
2012-09-04T04:30:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	I've seen some drives that won't open/read drives with open sessions, but other drives would. That's why I suggest reviewing /var/log/kern.log whilst the disk is being inserted and initialised (tail -f /var/log/kern.log and insert disc, and watch the log)
2012-09-04T04:31:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	TJ- ls: cannot access /dev/scd0: No such file or directory, what do you think? I am leaning towards a dying/dead drive... or an old one that can't read iso files..??
2012-09-04T04:32:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	Well that's the device node not a mounted file-system and isn't guaranteed to be present (scdX means SCSI CD)
2012-09-04T04:33:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	did you see jamar's post?
2012-09-04T04:34:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	Yes; been reading those pastebins
2012-09-04T04:34:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	thanks for the suggestions!
2012-09-04T04:35:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	I've learned the hard way... *always* go to the logs first... they will provide hard objective information instead of subjective responses from users
2012-09-04T04:36:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	i think i need to dig into where to access these logs more. Any good suggestions for a howto on where to find the logs, or are they mostly in var?
2012-09-04T04:37:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	Everything system related is in /var/log/   ... for user X sessions there's ~/.xsession-errors
2012-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	I would think that e66's file allocation table grows with the creation of each one, even if they are zero kb.
2012-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	For system issues (all in /var/log/ or lower) dmesg contains just what happened at boot-time. For ongoing kernel reports look at kern.log. For system services look at syslog, for others... well look at the descriptive names of the log files themselves, and the directories which are per-application in /var/log/
2012-09-04T04:39:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	I'd have expected to see something from the drive when the disk was attached. It suggests the drive isn't talking to the kernel correctly for some reason
2012-09-04T04:40:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	true, all i see here is net traffic. Unfortunately here is where i beg off, because this is "above my paygrade" or more aptly, above my knowledge level.
2012-09-04T04:40:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	:D
2012-09-04T04:42:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	this is probably not the greatest idea, but what if he attempted to directly mount to sr0, maybe using the force tag? ohh, wait, i think force is for ntfs only... what do  yout think?>
2012-09-04T04:50:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	i don't know if you saw that, but he put the cd into another pc, and it reads fine.
2012-09-04T05:05:00.000Z	TJ-	hylian	jamar The thing with changing the BIOS setting is that any SATA devices will lose some functionality that will slow them down in some circumstances
2012-09-04T05:12:00.000Z	hylian	TJ-	usr13, thank you for helping.
