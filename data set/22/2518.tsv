2009-12-27T23:14:00.000Z	tvjudge		I think something is wrong with my boot loader or my kernel has been buggered coz my wireless stopped working on my hardy laptop
2009-12-27T23:15:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	did you update your kernel and then it stopped working?
2009-12-27T23:16:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	are you using gnome-network manager?
2009-12-27T23:16:00.000Z	tvjudge	odinsbane	i was messing with things becoz my sun virtual box was whining about the module not loading
2009-12-27T23:18:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	you could reboot into your old kernel, if you stil have it and see if that solves the problem.  Or you could disable networking and try ifconfig/iwconfig/dhclient routine.
2009-12-27T23:18:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	are you sure the card is being turned on?
2009-12-27T23:20:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	how about ifconfig wlan0 up first
2009-12-27T23:20:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	although for your kernel it might be called eth0/1 or it could be called ath0 if you have an atheros card.
2009-12-27T23:25:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	probably not yet.
2009-12-27T23:26:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	what do you get when you do a lspci can you find your wireless card in there?
2009-12-27T23:27:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	if you card is an atheros card you could try re-installing the mad wifi drivers (they should be in your package manager)
2009-12-27T23:30:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	but you might not have all the kernel drivers installed/ such as backports and restricted modules for both kernels
2009-12-27T23:31:00.000Z	tvjudge	odinsbane	- i am now trying a previous kernel  THis all started with my messing with vbox drivers
2009-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	did you check your package manager for the madwifi drivers there could be a kernel-restricted module that you need to install for your particular kernel.
2009-12-27T23:33:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	yes, especially if your wireless card is an atheros card.
2009-12-27T23:38:00.000Z	tvjudge	odinsbane	-- I booted on the .25 generic after cleaning out ny interfces of the etho and wlan0 and now gnome network manager seems to work
2009-12-27T23:40:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	I think you are missing a kernel module.  So check your package manager for ath9k, or if you have a broadcomm chip look for that.
2009-12-27T23:40:00.000Z	tvjudge	odinsbane	how can i identify the wirelss chipset that i have?
2009-12-27T23:41:00.000Z	odinsbane	tvjudge	lspci

2009-12-28T00:35:00.000Z	tvjudge	odinsbane	thanks for your kind assistance. I got my wireless working now on the laptop again.
