2006-06-05T15:17:00.000Z	gavin_		hey guys, got an interesting setup here. i had to use ubuntu server to install on an older dell laptop, because it lacked the memory for ubuntu desktop cd... how do i invoke from the command line setting up the NIC (PCMCIA card) to get dhcp?
2006-06-05T15:17:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	edit /etc/network/interfaces
2006-06-05T15:18:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	what do i need to do in that file? it lists auto lo and iface lo inet loopback underneath the commented section
2006-06-05T15:19:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	man 5 interfaces has the info - is your interface eth0 ?
2006-06-05T15:20:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	i'm not sure, i assume it would be eth0 since its the only NIC in the laptop, but it is a removable PCMCIA card... i skipped network config in the install because i didn't have it plugged into my network
2006-06-05T15:21:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	plug it in and do 'sudo ifconfig -a', you should see it there - I expect it's eth0, but no harm to make sure
2006-06-05T15:22:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	is there a command to invoke auto network config?
2006-06-05T15:22:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	once you set it up, it'll be automatic
2006-06-05T15:22:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	yes it shows eth0 from that output
2006-06-05T15:23:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	you want the interface to come up at boot time?
2006-06-05T15:23:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	well, at this point, i just want the interface up right now so i can download ubuntu-desktop LOL
2006-06-05T15:29:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	if you are likely to boot without the card, you might want to remove 'eth0' from the line 'auto lo eth0' if the absence of the card causes an excessively long timeout at boot time
2006-06-05T15:25:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	edit /etc/network/interfaces; append 'eth0' (without quotes) to the line 'auto lo', and add a new line at the end of the file, 'iface eth0 inet dhcp' (without quotes), save the file, and do 'sudo ifup eth0', and you should be set
2006-06-05T15:26:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	looks to be working now. thanks for the help! :)
2006-06-05T15:27:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	cool - in future, sudo ifup eth0 will bring up the interface, if it doesn't come up automatically when you insert the card
2006-06-05T15:28:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	good to know, thanks again
2006-06-05T15:29:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	well, the card will probably remain in, but it might not always be plugged into anything.
2006-06-05T15:29:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	maybe remove eth0 from auto lo eth0, or see how it goes
2006-06-05T15:30:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	can i set a max wait on eth0 coming up to prevent extremely long wait times at boot?
2006-06-05T15:30:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	or does it even take that long to give up on time out?
2006-06-05T15:30:00.000Z	amphi	gavin_	dunno
2006-06-05T15:31:00.000Z	gavin_	amphi	well i'll see how it goes.
