2007-07-05T14:05:00.000Z	varka	joker	just use "sudo <command>"
2007-07-05T14:06:00.000Z	varka	joker	if you are installing downloaded .deb packages just type: "sudo dpkg -i /path/to/blablabla.deb"
2007-07-05T14:07:00.000Z	varka	joker	or doubleclick the .deb in nautilus, then gdebi will install it graphically
2007-07-05T14:09:00.000Z	varka	joker	ok, this one you will have to compile yourself, as you are pretty new i dont recommend it, just try the last link i gave you instead as it contains .deb packages which are very easily to install
