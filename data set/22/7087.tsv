2006-09-28T16:55:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	i have done a dsl-based rescue system with xfce 3 that runs in ram
2006-09-28T16:56:00.000Z	stefg	POVaddct	is that available for download somewhere? Might be an inspiration
2006-09-28T16:57:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	i can set up a temporary http server here on my box. its only 128kbps upload, but anyway...
2006-09-28T16:58:00.000Z	stefg	POVaddct	don't mind... i know the DSL/Knoppix initrd relatively well, so don't bother.
2006-09-28T16:58:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	i changed the cloop to zisofs
2006-09-28T05:00:00.000Z	stefg	POVaddct	I guess, I'll go squashfs and let the complete thing be an initrd... hopefully this is possible, but e.g. the Acronis Rescue media work that way
2006-12-27T11:39:00.000Z	stefg	POVaddct	Some_Person, don't bother about the nvida-nic driver... forcedeth is in the kernel for ages, and no bugs are known so far
2006-12-27T11:40:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	there many new nforce ethernet cards now, not running perfectly with the forcedeth driver. nvidia changes the chipset behaviour every now and then.
2006-12-27T11:41:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	especially the gbit nforce cards gave me trouble
2006-12-27T11:48:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	we have been through pppoe -A -I eth0 and dhclient eth0 already. no luck...
2006-12-27T11:49:00.000Z	stefg	POVaddct	may it's pppoa (or whatever the name of is... Austria uses it a lotAFAIK)
2006-12-27T11:49:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	pppoa is new to me

2006-12-27T11:59:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	if he has a web interface, it must be more than a plain modem
2006-12-27T11:59:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	and according to Some_Person, it _has_ a web interface
2006-12-29T06:14:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	yeah..
2006-12-29T06:15:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	i think "how to install software?" should be the top of the list in a faq
2006-12-29T06:17:00.000Z	stefg	POVaddct	i came to the point to write up my own migartion guide for my customers... a non-technical one, more of a less sarcastic version of http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm
2007-06-30T07:33:00.000Z	POVaddct	stefg	which blkid bug are you referring to?
