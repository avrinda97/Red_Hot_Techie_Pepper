2011-09-21T21:37:00.000Z	cpglsn		can you please help me ? i'm trying to add 1 line with sudoers:     prof ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/shutdown -h now       but visudo continue to tell me there's an error ... do you see it ?
2011-09-21T21:37:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	get rid of -h now
2011-09-21T21:38:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	the admin group doesn't matter, as your calling you by name
2011-09-21T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	delete the line and exit visudo - make sure it's not erroring without that line
2011-09-21T21:40:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	did it, but when i put it again the error stay
2011-09-21T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	but when you exit without that line, it saves correctly ?
2011-09-21T21:40:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	yes
2011-09-21T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	are you using spaces or tabs ?
2011-09-21T21:41:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	spaces
2011-09-21T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	it's a tab
2011-09-21T21:41:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	between line elements ?
2011-09-21T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	correct
2011-09-21T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	(not sure it makes a difference, but all my rules have tabs)
2011-09-21T21:42:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	now i try
2011-09-21T21:42:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	same error
2011-09-21T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	I've just tested it on my machine and it works fine
2011-09-21T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	testuser        ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/shutdown -h now
2011-09-21T21:44:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	now i but at the biginning of the file, but it ask for a password
2011-09-21T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	cpglsn	can't explain that, I've just moved mine to the top of the file and it's fine
2011-09-21T21:46:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	ActionParsnip the problem was that, installing joe, it autoset itself as default editor, and, as i can see, joe is not good with sudoers
2011-09-21T21:49:00.000Z	cpglsn	ikonia	ActionParsnip now everything works well. Thanks a lot for help
