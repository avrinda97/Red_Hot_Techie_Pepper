2007-12-13T23:57:00.000Z	Konam		can someone please help me
2007-12-13T23:57:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	whats the problem?
2007-12-13T23:58:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	the ubuntu restricted manager installed the driver of the wireless card, a broadcom
2007-12-13T23:58:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	recognize how? you mean it doesnt show up in nm-applet?
2007-12-13T23:58:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	exactly
2007-12-13T23:58:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	and did you let it download the firmware?
2007-12-13T23:59:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	does it pick up other wireless networks?
2007-12-14T00:05:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	I haven't tried, mine is the only one around here :(
2007-12-14T00:05:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	I could go elsewhere but at the moment I can't and the wifi hotspots aren't something usual around here :/
2007-12-14T00:05:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	that driver should have worked but have you tried ndiswrapper yet?
2007-12-14T00:06:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	no, but the driver worked, the card is being recognize by ubuntu and I can turn it on (I could not if it wasn't)
2007-12-14T00:07:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	yeah but if it was working right you would have connected to your AP already
2007-12-14T00:08:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	are you sure your router is broadcasting its SSID?
2007-12-14T00:08:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	yes, and I've tried to connect manually and couldn't either
2007-12-14T00:10:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	maybe you should try ndiswrapper then
2007-12-14T00:21:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	can I use the one in the repos?
2007-12-14T00:22:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	yes
2007-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	I have a question, with lspci it says that my broadcom is a bcm94311, that's a bcm4311? is just that a bcm94311 doesn't show up on the broadcom website
2007-12-14T00:42:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	may be a customized chip by the manufacturer
2007-12-14T00:42:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	of your computer
2007-12-14T00:42:00.000Z	Konam	profanephobia	but it's bcm4311 compatible?
2007-12-14T00:42:00.000Z	profanephobia	Konam	i dont know
