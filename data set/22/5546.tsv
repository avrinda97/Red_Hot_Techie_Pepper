2007-04-17T11:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	I have a command that will fix that if you want.
2007-04-17T11:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	sudo sed -i.backup 's|us.archive|archive|g' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update
2007-04-17T11:53:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	Thanks!!!  I'll give it a try....
2007-04-17T11:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	You're welcome :)
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	 I'm having the same problem
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	Can you pastebin the exact errors you are getting?
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	it stays stuck on "99% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.88.31)] "
2007-04-17T12:05:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	after a sudo apt-get update
2007-04-17T12:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	That mirror may be slow, just wait it out or try again later.
2007-04-17T12:06:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	That's what I needed to hear, thanks again!
2007-04-17T12:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	Was that the same error you had with us.archive ?
2007-04-17T12:07:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	yes it is....  It's been a couple days since I've been able to update from it....
2007-04-17T12:08:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	I thought it might have something to do with the new release coming out soon why it's been unaccessible...
2007-04-17T12:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	Ok, you can keep your sources.list as is or restore from the sources.list.backup. either is fine and is your call.
2007-04-17T12:09:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	so i take it archive.ubuntu.com and us.archive.ubuntu.com are mirrors of each other then?
2007-04-17T12:09:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	silly question, never mind...
2007-04-17T12:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	One is a US mirror, yes. The command I gave you, the "-i.backup" bit made a backup of your sources.list before editing it, just in case you wanted to restore later. Have a look in /etc/apt
2007-04-17T12:10:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	oic...  clever!
2007-04-17T12:18:00.000Z	Lumbago	ardchoille	"http://www.gtlib.gatech.edu/pub/mirrors/archive.ubuntu.com/" is a quick mirror of "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/"
2007-04-17T12:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Lumbago	Nice, using different mirrors :)
