2007-04-30T13:35:00.000Z	punsad		anyone know if a compaq v6000z will run ubuntu well?  I did google it and saw mixed feedback
2007-04-30T13:37:00.000Z	punsad		:(
2007-04-30T13:38:00.000Z	punsad		anyone know if beryl will run okay on my AMDSempron +3500 powered laptop with 1GB RAM (NVIdia 6150 video card - no dedicated RAM)
2007-04-30T13:38:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	It should.
2007-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	I'm running Vista/Feisty. They both work great.
2007-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	1.6 Ghz/2gb ram
2007-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	punsad	sanityx	did you install ur linux onto a new machine with vista pre-installed?
2007-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	No, I installed linux, then vista later.
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	Eh . . .
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	What for
2007-04-30T13:44:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	try vmware :-D
2007-04-30T13:44:00.000Z	punsad	sanityx	will that handle VPN tunnels?
2007-04-30T13:44:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	VMware running Windows XP can do anything regular windows XP can do
2007-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	punsad	sanityx	I'll try it... but I'm skeptical
2007-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	congrats
2007-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	punsad	sanityx	is vmware available through deb repository?
2007-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	Yes, vmware server is now availible in ubuntus repositories
2007-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	also you cant get it free at vmware.com
2007-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	punsad	sanityx	I've read some on Xen.  I guess vmware is intustrial strength and probably better
2007-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	I like it.
2007-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	vmware is proprietary though
2007-04-30T13:52:00.000Z	sanityx	punsad	google.com works
