2008-09-07T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	what happens? what errors do you get? more info please
2008-09-07T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	so once its installed and rebooted it goes to a command line based environment?
2008-09-07T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	put it all on 1 line dude
2008-09-07T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	ease up on enter
2008-09-07T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	you tried it without acpi?
2008-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	did you md5 check your cd image and the cd once it was burned?
2008-09-07T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	ok, once it boots, press f6
2008-09-07T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	then select acpi=off
2008-09-07T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	nothing is garunteed
2008-09-07T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	well theres only one way to see
2008-09-07T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	theres also no dma you could try
2008-09-07T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	thats all you got, kernel options as it doesnt seem to boot to live cd. you could set your bios to failsafe settings too
2008-09-07T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	and yuo could run the memtest which is no the cd too
2008-09-07T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	did you get the alternate cd, server cd or desktop cd?
2008-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	id check your bios is set to failsafe and then try acpi off if its no good
2008-09-07T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	id also check your ram for errors as all that stuff gets put into ram to run
2008-09-07T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snipe	jump into bios and there will be an option, itll be safe or failsafe or similar, it varys wildly from bios to bios
