2005-11-07T17:17:00.000Z	P8ntKid	selinium	I cant make a new partition becuase i dont have anymore room on my hd. My partitions are set up how ubuntu makes them defualt
2005-11-07T17:18:00.000Z	selinium	P8ntKid	so where are you trying to point the /home to?
2005-11-07T17:19:00.000Z	P8ntKid	selinium	Ok. I have 3 partitions. hda1 is the boot partition. hda2 is the main filesystem /home partition and hda5 is the swap partition. I want to make a new partition for my /home directory becuase i am about to install gentoo and i want to keep all my config files like my firefox bookmarks fluxbox menus/etc
2005-11-07T17:22:00.000Z	selinium	P8ntKid	I thoguht you said you had no room?
2005-11-07T17:22:00.000Z	P8ntKid	selinium	Yes. That is why i am asking how to make more room.
