2007-12-03T05:49:00.000Z	isleshocky77		When I start up my Ubuntu 7.10 Desktop system I get the error "serial8250: too much work for irq10" over and over from 0 - 557.9920000.  I can get to just normal terminal, but I can't get the desktop to start up. Any suggestions for what I should try reinstalling or configuring?
2007-12-03T05:50:00.000Z	Pelo	isleshocky77	 boot the recovery mode and try reinstaling ubuntu-desktop
2007-12-03T05:50:00.000Z	isleshocky77	Pelo	WHat will I lose by doing that?
2007-12-03T05:50:00.000Z	isleshocky77	Pelo	What's the best way to do this? apt-get, dpkg ??
2007-12-03T05:50:00.000Z	Pelo	isleshocky77	yo won't loose anything
2007-12-03T05:51:00.000Z	Pelo	isleshocky77	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-12-03T05:52:00.000Z	isleshocky77	Pelo	Should I do apt-get uninstall ubuntu-desktop first, or do a --reinstall
2007-12-03T05:53:00.000Z	Pelo	isleshocky77	go for reinstall,  my thought is that there is something borked with something in that part of it that keeps you from getting the dektop so if I am right ..
2007-12-03T05:54:00.000Z	isleshocky77	Pelo	It has to do with some thing with my video card. I was trying to get my s-video out to work so I started messing with different drivers and envy.  After doing a manual envy driver install this happened.  When I did an envy --uninstall-all I still get the same thing although it said it was successful
2007-12-03T05:54:00.000Z	Pelo	isleshocky77	did you just try reconfigureing x first ?
2007-12-03T05:55:00.000Z	isleshocky77	Pelo	Any direction on doing that?
2007-12-03T05:56:00.000Z	Pelo	isleshocky77	 again , boot the recovery mode ,  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  , select the correct driver from the list ( vesa if you donT' find a matching one) when it doubt about the rest just use the default provided or donT' enter anything
2007-12-03T05:58:00.000Z	isleshocky77	Pelo	Thanks, that's what I was looking for.
2007-12-03T05:58:00.000Z	Pelo	isleshocky77	the right question gets you the right asnwer
