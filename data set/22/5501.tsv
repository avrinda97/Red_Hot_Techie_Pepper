2007-04-27T07:54:00.000Z	dewaard		after I enable 'universe' in /etc/apt/sources.list, is there anything I need to do apart from saving the file to get it working? I'm trying to install the package 'trac' in dapper drake but I'm getting E: Couldn't find package trac
2007-04-27T07:54:00.000Z	dewaard		any suggestions?
2007-04-27T07:54:00.000Z	dewaard		ahh, thanks
2007-04-27T07:55:00.000Z	dewaard		cheers guys :)-
2007-04-27T07:55:00.000Z	dewaard		as you noticed I'm a bit new to Ubuntu ;)
2007-04-27T07:56:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	thats good
2007-04-27T07:58:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	I've been using GNU/Linux for 8 years or so now (though for the last three years with mac desktop), but Ubuntu makes a great impression compared to all those distros I've used. I like it so much I might even get a desktop box to try it on ;)
2007-04-27T08:00:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	yes i understand, i dont no exactly why, but it conviced me and its getting better...
2007-04-27T08:03:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	well, what I like about Ubuntu is that its a system built on a mature core, but with a forward facing spirit (Feisty having Python 2.5 already is what convinced me, even though I had to downgrade again for practical reasons)
2007-04-27T08:04:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	I kind of want the best of two worlds, mature quality because I run it on server boxes and new software versions so I can keep the developer in my happy (its not fun to program on python or php releases that are five years old, as you find in some disros)
2007-04-27T08:05:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	and ubuntu seems  to be the closest to that
2007-04-27T08:05:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	for me its the great flexibility in realtime performance for live video and the rest like presentation powerpoint, internet, etc which makes it incredible nice laptop, it does not crash
2007-04-27T08:06:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	hmm, cool. seems like I should really try it out on a desktop then :)
2007-04-27T08:07:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	a new experience, since one year on linux and ubuntu made it easy for me to enter. i'm not windows anymore behalf editing video on premiere. the rest is better on linux. desktop in studio runs on ubuntu too and since than never crashed////
2007-04-27T08:08:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	nice :)
2007-04-27T08:09:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	you should consider a mac, though. it might not be ethically ok as far as licensing goes, but its damn nice, especially for video stuff :)
2007-04-27T08:09:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	yeah but its kind of very late and my english is freezing, like the contact lenses, flapflap
2007-04-27T08:09:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	hehe, good night, then ;)
2007-04-27T08:10:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	i use mac for giving workshop and its true, very round but i miss the mess of a pc...
2007-04-27T08:10:00.000Z	dewaard	jo_	hehe
2007-04-27T08:11:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	but indeed, the naxt laptop could be a mac....
2007-04-27T08:12:00.000Z	jo_	dewaard	goodnight, here the birds are starting the daything and im going to sleep, ciao
