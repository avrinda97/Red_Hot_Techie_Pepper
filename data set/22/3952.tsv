2008-08-10T17:35:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	no
2008-08-10T17:12:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	it should be close
2008-08-10T17:13:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	well, that seems awfully off
2008-08-10T17:13:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	does your hardware support 1.5gb of ram? it may be compensating by syncing a 512 dimm at a lower ammount of ram
2008-08-10T17:14:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	I'm pretty sure it supports up to 2Gig
2008-08-10T17:14:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	hm
2008-08-10T17:15:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	actually, it you have a 1 gig dimm in there, it may not actually like that
2008-08-10T17:16:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	why not?
2008-08-10T17:18:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	you would have to check your hardware specifications, I know some machines do not like large dimms
2008-08-10T17:32:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	ok, found the hardware specs, min memory 512MB,max 2GB,memory module capacities: 512MB, 1GB, 2GB
2008-08-10T17:33:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	are your bios up to date?
2008-08-10T17:33:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	yep
2008-08-10T17:34:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	well then, do a memtest86+
2008-08-10T17:34:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	if it finds no problems, then the people who sold you your ram screwed you
2008-08-10T17:34:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	did that, no idea how to interpret the results, just seemed to loop round
2008-08-10T17:34:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	did it give you any red on the bottom?
2008-08-10T17:35:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	well then that's your ram size
2008-08-10T17:36:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	what is?
2008-08-10T17:36:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	1390 or whatever
2008-08-10T17:36:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	i have one 1GB stick and 1 512MB
2008-08-10T17:37:00.000Z	drazak	emorris	I don't know, there may be something wrong with your ram, but it's not a bad block, or else you would have had a bunch of red lines in the bottom
2008-08-10T17:38:00.000Z	emorris	drazak	hmm. well, i originally did the memtest because openoffice crashes an awful lot
