2008-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	tony55	susanna777	is sda5 a primary partition or an extended partition
2008-05-04T05:48:00.000Z	susanna777	tony55	it's part of a logical partition
2008-05-04T05:49:00.000Z	tony55	susanna777	logical partiton is a ectended partition thats why it won't work you can only resize a primary partiton
2008-05-04T05:49:00.000Z	susanna777	tony55	i tried to make it a primary partition, but it would let me make more than 4 and windows already had two or three or whatever

2008-05-04T06:00:00.000Z	susanna777	tony55	it's just called fat16
