2009-02-15T04:11:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	no
2009-02-15T04:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	that's b/c linksys cards always use broadcom chipsets
2009-02-15T04:08:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	are there drivers for those or must i use ndiswrapper?
2009-02-15T04:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	it's iffy, depends on exactly what chipset you have
2009-02-15T04:10:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	how can i find out.. i'm not good with WIndows and Ubuntu off live CD could take a while to boot on this machien (plus there's no network in ubuntu on here)
2009-02-15T04:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	do you have a 'restricted drivers available' icon whatzit in your taskbar?
2009-02-15T04:11:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	although there are nVidia drivers on this machine
2009-02-15T04:11:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	i mean an nVidia card
2009-02-15T04:15:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	how would i find which chipset this this wireless device has in it from windows?
2009-02-15T04:16:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	well, you can use lspci or lsusb depending on how it's plugged in
2009-02-15T04:16:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	from windows?
2009-02-15T04:16:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	it would take a good 15 minutes to get back into the live cd
2009-02-15T04:16:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	and a good 10 to get back into windows
2009-02-15T04:16:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	ah, do you know what the model number of the card is?
2009-02-15T04:17:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	yes i have it from System Info
2009-02-15T04:17:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	like "linksys wrt54g v.10" or something
2009-02-15T04:17:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	Linksys LNE100TX Fast Ethernet Adapter (LNE100TXv4)
2009-02-15T04:17:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	in this situation, the version number is very important, linksys likes to swap chipsets a lot
2009-02-15T04:18:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	was that the version number? if not where can i get it?
2009-02-15T04:18:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	the box it came in, or on a sticker on the actual card
2009-02-15T04:19:00.000Z	rdw200169	meoblast	but i don't think what you showed me is the wireless card, that's an ethernet adapter
2009-02-15T04:19:00.000Z	meoblast	rdw200169	i dont know... and i don't think my dad would like me demolishing everything to get to the back of the machhine
