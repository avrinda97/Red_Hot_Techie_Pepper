2009-07-14T03:22:00.000Z	Magichal		does anyone have any knowledge on why Firefox 3 would randomly erase all of my settings, bookmarks, saved passwords, etc., unprovoked?
2009-07-14T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	sounds like you got yourself a profile problem and firefox created a new one for you
2009-07-14T03:23:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	run firefox from a terminal.. try "firefox --help".. there is a switch to start with a profile selector.. something like firefox --profilemanager
2009-07-14T03:23:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	alright, I'll check out the profiles real fast. I literally got up from my computer, left it for an hour, came back, and all my settings were erase.d and I know that no one used my computer while I was up.
2009-07-14T03:24:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	I don't think they are erased.. they are just not being used (if I'm correct)
2009-07-14T03:25:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	I ran "firefox -profilemanager" like the help file referred to, but nothing regarding profiles came up. just an about:blank screen as I've been experiencing when I would open Firefox normally, without the -profilemanager tag.
2009-07-14T03:26:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	check permissions using ls -l ...  I'm guessing you need both read and write permissions or firefox might get upset
2009-07-14T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	when you started firefox using the profile manager you didn't get a small dialog window for selecting which profile to use?
2009-07-14T03:27:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	no, I didn't. it just came up as a blank window.
2009-07-14T03:28:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	no toolbars, no firefox toolbar bookmarks, no homepage, absolutely nothing. just a blank white screen.
2009-07-14T03:28:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	try shutting down all running instances of firefox first
2009-07-14T03:29:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	and when I press the Home button, despite my Edit --> Preferences setting to google, it goes to mozilla.org.
2009-07-14T03:29:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	run a "pkill firefox" just to be sure
2009-07-14T03:29:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	Okay, Firefox is killed, let me try the profilemanager again.
2009-07-14T03:30:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	got the window. the only profile listed is default, which is the only one I created.
2009-07-14T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	hmm.. there goes that theory..
2009-07-14T03:30:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	I started it with the default profile, and still nothing. same as before.
2009-07-14T03:31:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	then I don't really know what to try... sorry
2009-07-14T03:32:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	Okay, well thank you for your help. At least I know I tried the common solution.
2009-07-14T03:32:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	if I figure out why my Firefox is being wiped, would you like me to report it back to you?
2009-07-14T03:33:00.000Z	Slart	Magichal	I'm off to bed in a minute or so.. but thanks anyway
2009-07-14T03:33:00.000Z	Magichal	Slart	oh alrighty. well thank you again. =)
