2010-02-20T15:08:00.000Z	feros_		Oww already busy helping someone ^^ I'll wait a bit :3
2010-02-20T15:09:00.000Z	feros_		Issue: My sound goes right to the sub (Laptop with inbound sub under my laptop). Been trying for 26 hours to fix this (+/-). Help wanted :3 (PS: Answer when you got time ^^)
2010-02-20T15:11:00.000Z	feros_		I fear its some config in Terminal I need to do and since I'm a total newbie at this I do not dare to do anything myself xD
2010-02-20T15:11:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	is it an HP Pavilion?
2010-02-20T15:12:00.000Z	feros_	candyban	know the problem :P?
2010-02-20T15:13:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	you'll have to fiddle in a modprobe.conf/alsa-base.conf
2010-02-20T15:14:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	the driver guesses incorrectly your hardware ... you'll have to force it to use a proper one ... if you don't feel comfortable ... you'll have to live with the bass sound
2010-02-20T15:15:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	or if you feel adventerous enough to try yourself :)
2010-02-20T15:17:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	open a terminal and type: grep snd-hda-intel /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
2010-02-20T15:19:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	nothing more?
2010-02-20T15:19:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	do you know how to use vi ?
2010-02-20T15:21:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	type "sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf"
2010-02-20T15:22:00.000Z	feros_	candyban	a gedit window opened with lots of text :P
2010-02-20T15:24:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	you'll have to add some additional lines
2010-02-20T15:27:00.000Z	feros_	candyban	no # :P?
2010-02-20T15:27:00.000Z	feros_	candyban	if not I've added those lines without the quote signs :)
2010-02-20T15:27:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	no, the starting # means it is comment (so it is ignored)
2010-02-20T15:27:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	each on a different line, right?
2010-02-20T15:27:00.000Z	feros_	candyban	all got a special own line for themself :)
2010-02-20T15:29:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	save the file
2010-02-20T15:29:00.000Z	candyban	feros_	reboot and cross your fingers ;)
2010-02-20T15:29:00.000Z	feros_	candyban	oke :) Will brb then :P
