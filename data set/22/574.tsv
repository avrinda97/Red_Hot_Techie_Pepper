2011-07-11T15:39:00.000Z	cheche		How can I put back all the files from trash to the original location?
2011-07-11T15:40:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	open the trash, select all. Right click and restore should put them back where they were...
2011-07-11T15:41:00.000Z	cheche		well this is what i found: a dual-boot machine that suddenly windows stop workking with NTldr not found
2011-07-11T15:41:00.000Z	cheche		and i found all those files on the .Trash-1000
2011-07-11T15:41:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	You need to reinstall ntldr, using. E.g. recovery console
2011-07-11T15:42:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	with testdisk right?
2011-07-11T15:43:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	You'll need ms recovery console, or if using windows 7 the startup recovery should do the trick for you from the install cd
2011-07-11T15:43:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	this is windows xp
2011-07-11T15:44:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	hmmm, of all the files in the trash do you see ntldr there by any chance?
2011-07-11T15:45:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	in the old c:\ there is only autoexec.bat
2011-07-11T15:47:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	Sounds like you'll need to do a reinstall of xp in that case. Unfortunate...
2011-07-11T15:47:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	I found this guide: http://ubuntuguide.net/fix-windows-when-boot-files-bootinintldrare-missing
2011-07-11T15:49:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	my main worry is to put all the files back to the right places within windows
2011-07-11T15:50:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	so are all the files in your ubuntu trash the files from your original ntfs partition?
2011-07-11T15:50:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	I go to the ntfs partition and ctrl + h to see the .Trash-1000
2011-07-11T15:51:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	expunged files and info is there
2011-07-11T15:51:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	in files looks like the whole windows tree
2011-07-11T15:52:00.000Z	cheche		arrrcanum42: I wonder if I should use restore-tras command for this
2011-07-11T15:52:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	ok, so you should just be able to 'mv * ../' while you're in that directory
2011-07-11T15:53:00.000Z	cheche	arfbtwn	so what is the meaning of info + expunged?
2011-07-11T15:55:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	I believe that's how GNU/Linux handles it's recycle bin
2011-07-11T15:55:00.000Z	arfbtwn	cheche	ie. Those directories should contain information about where the files were originally located, for example
