2005-09-19T13:51:00.000Z	nickrud	kangpeh	which imap server are you using?
2005-09-19T13:51:00.000Z	kangpeh	nickrud	imap server from school and imap server (qmail) on my server
2005-09-19T13:51:00.000Z	kangpeh	nickrud	but evolution worked before with hoary.
2005-09-19T13:51:00.000Z	kangpeh		but now with breezy it doesn't
2005-09-19T13:51:00.000Z	kangpeh		:(
2005-09-19T13:51:00.000Z	kangpeh		same exact settings
2005-09-19T13:51:00.000Z	kangpeh		:(
2005-09-19T13:52:00.000Z	nickrud	kangpeh	it's working in breezy here, and that is strange
2005-09-19T13:52:00.000Z	nickrud	kangpeh	can you see them with mutt or thunderbird?
2005-09-19T13:53:00.000Z	kangpeh	nickrud	didnt try
2005-09-19T13:54:00.000Z	nickrud	kangpeh	probably you can, but it's best to check (seems like an evo problem, not imap)
