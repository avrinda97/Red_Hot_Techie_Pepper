2005-12-30T14:06:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	lightbright	your client will tell you when there's an update
2005-12-30T14:07:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	lightbright	or you can use backports, but i don't recommand them
2005-12-30T14:07:00.000Z	lightbright	johndarkhorse	ok!  so unless I use backports, I can never ever update applications and programs to the latest?

2005-12-30T14:10:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	lightbright	ubuntu is on a 6 month release cycle, which means you get new stuff every 6 months. the cutting edge stuff will always be in the development version
2005-12-30T14:10:00.000Z	lightbright	johndarkhorse	SO unless I use backports, I can never ever update applications and programs to the latest until ecery 6 months with every new Ubuntu realease?  Is that correct?
