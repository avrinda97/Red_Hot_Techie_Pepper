2005-07-03T10:53:00.000Z	sproingie		ubuntu for x86_64 works pretty well too.  it's the 32 bit stuff that's kind of a pain
2005-07-03T10:54:00.000Z	sproingie		blame apt.  it can't handle multiple architectures at once
2005-07-03T10:55:00.000Z	sproingie		i'd rather use windows than use gnome's file selector, that's for sure
2005-07-03T10:56:00.000Z	Jimbob	sproingie	Why?
2005-07-03T10:56:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	 it drives me nuts.  the autocomplete behavior is by far the worst
2005-07-03T10:56:00.000Z	Jimbob	sproingie	Why is it the worst
2005-07-03T10:58:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	it autocompletes while i'm still typing.  so if i type "/usr", it ends up as "/usrsr"
2005-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	Jimbob	sproingie	What version of GTK+ are you using?
2005-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	beats me.  the one that installed with firefox, the only app where i'm unfortunate enough to suffer that behavior
2005-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	Jimbob	sproingie	Try "dpkg -s libgtk2.0-0", and tell me what the version is
2005-07-03T11:04:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	tells me that it's not installed.
2005-07-03T11:05:00.000Z	Jimbob	sproingie	What version of ubuntu?
2005-07-03T11:05:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	can't even find it with dpkg -l.  i doubt firefox is statically linked
2005-07-03T11:06:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	hoary
2005-07-03T11:06:00.000Z	Jimbob	sproingie	Strange
2005-07-03T11:07:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	actually, it seems to have stopped doing that.  i know it used to
2005-07-03T11:08:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	well, problem 1 of 2334525346 with that file selector solved
2005-07-03T11:08:00.000Z	Jimbob	sproingie	Ok, what are the other problems?
2005-07-03T11:09:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	just lack of features, like detail and thumbnail view.  both of which i've had many occasions to use
2005-07-03T11:13:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	i've used the detail view to sort by owner in a directory where people drop all kinds of stuff.  i probably don't use it that often.  thumbnail view i do all the time, since i'm always slinging pictures around
2005-07-03T11:14:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	with detail view in windows i can pick arbitrary metadata.  too bad it's just about impossible to make explorer remember which columns I want in explorer view
2005-07-03T11:16:00.000Z	sproingie	Jimbob	common lisp interface manager
