2010-09-05T12:40:00.000Z	intrader		I am experiencing very slow UI in ubuntu 10.04 (Gnome, or no Gnome). Clicks require multiple tries, all apps. Scrollbar sticky, etc.
2010-09-05T12:40:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	been there, ouch .. try top and see what is using ram?
2010-09-05T12:43:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	I have 1Gb with 270000 free, no swap used. Xorg is using 4% xchat 2%
2010-09-05T12:45:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	check your hardware, (darned if i know what to check, but that ain't right.. is all your ram seated ok? )
2010-09-05T12:46:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	as I have gone that route, save /home, and install 10.04 retaining /home, only format /
2010-09-05T12:46:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	hmm so you think that's 10.04 messing up?
2010-09-05T12:47:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	I am running this on an Dell Inspiron 8200 that still boots and runs Windows XP OK, The driver for NVIDIA is version 96.
2010-09-05T12:50:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	I think it is something related to the latest kernel - I had 9.04: snappy UI (without Skype), installed 9.10: had UI problems, reinstalled 9.04: had UI porblems once the ubuntu update finished,installed 10.04: bad UI (have Skype now)
2010-09-05T12:50:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	Dr_Willis might be able to help you, it's beyond my skill level (so sorry)
2010-09-05T12:50:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	thanks
2010-09-05T12:52:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	i also doubt you're the first to have problems with upgrading, we all run different hardware, miracle is that most of us get it to work .. if not the 1st try the 50th ;)
2010-09-05T12:54:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	yes, it is amazing. Something that was done to the kernel or Xorg to make multi-gesture works messed up the UI.
2010-09-05T12:55:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	how do I get Dr_Willis to help?
2010-09-05T12:55:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	you might see if you can talk to the team that does that .. file a bug report
2010-09-05T12:57:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	how would I go about talking to the 'team that does that'
2010-09-05T13:00:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	thanks, hopefully either of them will get involved. And by the way, the first time that I tried 10.04 via upgrade it did not work at all. I then installed 10.04 clean after trying 9.04 again and noticing that after the ubuntu recommended update, I had the UI problems of 10.04 in 9.04
2010-09-05T13:06:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	google your problem, look for most likely and file a bug report .. someone here can explain 'bug report' better than i can
2010-09-05T13:08:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	I have posted in the general ubuntu forum, with some responsed (suggestions), but no solution yet
2010-09-05T13:09:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	you got magnetron's ubottu 's message?
2010-09-05T13:12:00.000Z	intrader	chalcedony	I did not see it - by the way the forum entry is titled 'Re: Seriously defective UI in ubuntu 10.04I' ( I had two spelling errors - in 'Re: Seriusly deffective UI in ubuntu 10.04I')
2010-09-05T13:15:00.000Z	chalcedony	intrader	please read: <ubottu> If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug using the command « ubuntu-bug <package> » - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs - Bugs in/wishes for the IRC bots (not Ubuntu) can be filed at http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-bots
