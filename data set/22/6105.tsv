2009-07-27T21:40:00.000Z	mu		What file does Ubuntu use to mount file automatically? in /etc/fstab I only find my filesystem, but two of my devices are being mounted and I wish to rename where they mount to.
2009-07-27T21:40:00.000Z	jrib	mu	removable drives like usb sticks?
2009-07-27T21:40:00.000Z	mu	jrib	USB drives, yes.
2009-07-27T21:40:00.000Z	jrib	mu	easiest way is to just change their labels.  They'll get mounted to /media/LABEL
2009-07-27T21:41:00.000Z	mu	jrib	I'm aware, that's what I'm trying to change.
2009-07-27T21:42:00.000Z	jrib	mu	umm, changing the label is one command?
2009-07-27T21:43:00.000Z	jrib	mu	sure, just like in the wiki
2009-07-27T21:43:00.000Z	mu	jrib	Well, okay. I'll try it then.
2011-03-10T09:19:00.000Z	jrib	mu	but the wiki answers your question
2011-03-10T09:20:00.000Z	mu	jrib	It mentions a configuration file path?
2011-03-10T09:20:00.000Z	mu	jrib	Because I am not seeing anything but how to use some GUI to configure Synaptics, which is definitely not desired...
2011-03-10T09:22:00.000Z	jrib	mu	wow. be patient.
2011-03-10T09:22:00.000Z	jrib	mu	because I'm trying to reply to you.
2011-03-10T09:23:00.000Z	mu	jrib	Sorry, I assumed you had ignored me.
2011-03-10T09:23:00.000Z	jrib	mu	*sigh* it definitely used to.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, on current ubuntu one can either use xinput or /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d
2011-03-10T09:24:00.000Z	mu	jrib	GaryD: /usr/lib/X11 does not contain an xorg.conf file; This is 10.10 Netbook by the way.
2011-03-10T09:24:00.000Z	jrib	mu	pay close attention to what we wrote :)
2011-03-10T09:25:00.000Z	jrib	mu	in the xorg.conf.d directory there should be some file with synaptics in its name
2011-03-10T09:26:00.000Z	jrib	mu	what version of ubuntu?
2011-03-10T09:27:00.000Z	jrib	mu	/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ my fault
2011-03-10T09:29:00.000Z	jrib	mu	dpkg -L xserver-xorg-input-synaptics  will list what files the package provides
2011-03-10T09:30:00.000Z	mu	jrib	Alright, but I'm not logged in to Ubuntu at the moment so that'll have to wait. Thanks for the help.
