2009-10-25T11:57:00.000Z	isola73dsh33p		i have a question to ask
2009-10-25T11:57:00.000Z	isola73dsh33p		ok..
2009-10-25T11:58:00.000Z	isola73dsh33p		i run totem from terminal and get deprecation warning saying "sha module is deprecated; ; use the hashlib module instead" what does it means?
2009-10-25T11:59:00.000Z	isola73dsh33p		...
2009-10-25T12:00:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	that means that the old module is no longer supported
2009-10-25T12:00:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	judging from what you're seeing there i think you'd have to change the way totem works
2009-10-25T12:02:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	you may not want to bother with it then... warnings aren't a huge deal
2009-10-25T12:05:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	wlan0 not found means that you don't have a wireless device there
2009-10-25T12:07:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	sounds more like a graphics driver problem to me
2009-10-25T12:07:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	well that sounds like a codec issue
2009-10-25T12:07:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	also, just because one thing works, doesn't mean all things will
2009-10-25T12:09:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	i have an ati card as well and it doesn't like fullscreen video
2009-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	fglrx isn't fully compatible with compiz
2009-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	specifically there have been problems with fglrx not implementing dri2, which compiz really likes to have
2009-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	i use compiz
2009-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	my system mostly works. it stutters on full screen hd video
2009-10-25T12:12:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	i don't really watch video on my machine
2009-10-25T12:13:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	try running metacity --replace from a command line, and then see if your video will work in full screen mode
2009-10-25T12:16:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	disable compiz when you want to watch fullscreen video then - you can install the Compiz Fusion Icon to select window managers easily
2009-10-25T12:17:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	np
2009-10-29T12:29:00.000Z	mgmuscari	isola73dsh33p	antsy much?
