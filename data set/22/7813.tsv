2005-12-20T06:21:00.000Z	Squee-D		"can help me find the uptodate driver for win xp-sp2?"  found on the ubuntu forums in a topic regarding the HPT370 module
2005-12-20T06:22:00.000Z	Squee-D	techrush	basically, if something you want does not exist, the most expedient thing is to help projects that are heading in the right direction
