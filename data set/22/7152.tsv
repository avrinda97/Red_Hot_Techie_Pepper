2006-06-27T15:39:00.000Z	g-nome	frank_b	right click and open with archive manager
2006-06-27T15:40:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	ah, thanks :)
2006-06-27T15:40:00.000Z	g-nome		how can i install a .deb package with APTITUDE ? so that it does remember what dependencies were also installed with it....
2006-06-27T15:40:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	it gives an error...
2006-06-27T15:42:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	but maybe it's a problem with the file itself. it might not be a deb package after all. I'll have to check it
2006-06-27T15:42:00.000Z	g-nome	frank_b	no, it does the same for me
2006-06-27T15:42:00.000Z	g-nome		hmm

2006-06-27T15:43:00.000Z	g-nome		how can i install a .deb package with APTITUDE ? so that it does remember what dependencies were also installed with it....
2006-06-27T15:43:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	it looks like a misture of an html and script file if I open it with text editor...
2006-06-27T15:44:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	and I just checked and it works on another deb package
2006-06-27T15:44:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	it's the file
2006-06-27T15:44:00.000Z	g-nome	frank_b	hehe, funny because it does also not for me

2006-06-27T15:45:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	which one? the one that I can see?
2006-06-27T15:45:00.000Z	g-nome		frank no, the one you can't
2006-06-27T15:46:00.000Z	g-nome	frank_b	is it opera?

2006-06-27T15:47:00.000Z	g-nome		How can I install a .deb package with APTITUDE ? (So that it does remember what dependencies were also installed with it...)
2006-06-27T15:47:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	seems that I downloaded it wrongly... I'll try again
2006-06-27T15:50:00.000Z	frank_b	g-nome	there's something wrong witht the file in the site. what you said works in another deb package I've tried. thanks for your help.
