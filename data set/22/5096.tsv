2007-07-26T12:47:00.000Z	thetaleofcody		 can anyone help me out here? I'm on feisty with ATI...and when I run beryl, it causes my taskbar to disappear
2007-07-26T12:47:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	KDE?
2007-07-26T12:47:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	gnome
2007-07-26T12:50:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	probably a nasty bug, try running gnome-panel (i think thats the command, don't use gnome anymore)
2007-07-26T12:51:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	so just go to the terminal and type in gnome-panel?
2007-07-26T12:52:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	ehrm do a ps -e | grep panel
2007-07-26T12:52:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	what does it return (Im taking a guess you have a panel right now)
2007-07-26T12:53:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	 5361 ?        00:00:02 gnome-panel
2007-07-26T12:54:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	ok, then you try beryl and open gnome-panel
2007-07-26T12:54:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	also you can start apps using ALT-
2007-07-26T12:54:00.000Z	tupa		ALT-
2007-07-26T12:54:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	sorry, ALT+F2
2007-07-26T12:55:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	thought it was working for a second
2007-07-26T12:56:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	so you opened it and crashed?
2007-07-26T12:56:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	no I opened beryl and all the effect changed, but my taskbars disappeared again
2007-07-26T12:57:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	I tried killall gnome-panel
2007-07-26T12:57:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	so did you executed the gnome-panel as I suggested?
2007-07-26T13:00:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	yeah...and it shows me this: I've detected a panel already running, and will now exit
2007-07-26T13:00:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	if I'm doing things wrong I apologize...I'm pretty new to all of this
2007-07-26T13:01:00.000Z	tupa	thetaleofcody	np, maybe you didn't killed it correctly? did you tried it with sudo?
2007-07-26T13:01:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	like: "sudo gnome-panel"
2007-07-26T13:02:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	tupa	or "sudo killall gnome-panel"
