2010-06-15T09:27:00.000Z	Incarnation		Hi everyone, I'm trying to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu 9.10; can someone please teach me how to "compare the MD5 sums" to ensure that I downloaded the correct package?
2010-06-15T09:28:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	the open source version of vbox is in the repos iirc
2010-06-15T09:28:00.000Z	Incarnation	codebrainz	What is the "repos iirc"?
2010-06-15T09:29:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	I mean, it's available by default in the ubuntu software manager if i remember correctly
2010-06-15T09:30:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	at the terminal, type sudo apt-get install virtualbox
2010-06-15T09:31:00.000Z	Incarnation	codebrainz	Okay, I will try that now
2010-06-15T09:34:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	should be under the main menu, or press Alt+F2 and type VirtualBox
2010-06-15T09:34:00.000Z	Incarnation	codebrainz	Okay, but how come it didn't show up under my Applications menu?
2010-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	it should, under "System" maybe?
2010-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	or "Accessories"
2010-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	Incarnation	codebrainz	Strange, it's not under either one of those menus
2010-06-15T09:36:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	yeah, i remember having that ... maybe restart gnome panel (killall gnome-panel) or just add it to the menu manually
2010-06-15T09:37:00.000Z	Incarnation	codebrainz	The killall command did the trick - now I've got a new item called System Tools
2010-06-15T09:37:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	good stuff.
2010-06-15T09:37:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	np
2010-06-27T02:06:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	what type of video device is this?
2010-06-27T02:07:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	do you have a TV card in the box too?
2010-06-27T02:08:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	strange.  try xawtv.  I've had that make non-working video devices start working (some v4l2 init stuff I suspect)
2010-06-27T02:18:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	can you explain your problem again, I missed most of what's happening
2010-06-27T02:21:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	so what happens currently when you connect the quickcam?  checking the last few lines of dmesg, what driver gets loaded when you plug it in?
2010-06-27T02:21:00.000Z	Incarnation	codebrainz	how do I check what gets loaded? I don't understand
2010-06-27T02:22:00.000Z	codebrainz	Incarnation	unplug the cam, replug it, wait 10 seconds maybe and then run "dmesg | tail -n 20"
