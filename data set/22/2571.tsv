2009-05-06T09:44:00.000Z	mattgyver		boxer, install winbinds
2009-05-06T09:45:00.000Z	mattgyver		boxer, see PM
2009-05-06T09:46:00.000Z	mattgyver		boxer, make sure you have a samba user setup first, sudo smbpasswd -a <user>
2009-05-06T09:47:00.000Z	mattgyver		If thats not the case, install winbinds and edit your /etc/nsswitch.conf file, add 'wins' on the host line before 'files'
2009-05-06T09:48:00.000Z	boxer_	mattgyver	i just tried that and it didnt help
2009-05-06T09:52:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	not sure why it does that but its happening to me too on one of my machines
2009-05-06T09:55:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	i have viewd them by going to this in nautilus smb://machineip/sharefolder
2009-05-06T09:56:00.000Z	boxer_	mattgyver	the weird thing is that i was able to do that a minute a go, now i cant.... im wondering if its a username/password thing?
2009-05-06T09:56:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	its a bug im pretty sure and its irratating the hell out of me
2009-05-06T09:57:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	i have to restart samba as soon a i boot the machine just so it can be seen on the network
2009-05-06T09:57:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	then i have to view it via smb://machineip/share folder
2009-05-06T09:58:00.000Z	boxer_	mattgyver	ahh smb://machip/shard just worked =P
2009-05-06T09:58:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	its only gonna work if you restart that samba server after you login though
2009-05-06T09:59:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	i created a quick launch icon in my panel to restart it
2009-05-06T09:59:00.000Z	boxer_	mattgyver	good idea ill have to do that
2009-05-06T09:59:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	i actually made a txt file for myself so i remembered what to do, if you want it ill paste it in the PM
2009-05-06T10:00:00.000Z	boxer_	mattgyver	yeah sure id appreciate that
2009-05-06T10:01:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	there you are, save that somewhere, its not a well documented fix.
2009-05-06T10:01:00.000Z	boxer_	mattgyver	thanks
2009-05-06T10:02:00.000Z	mattgyver	boxer_	one other thing you can try (didnt work for me) enable the 'Jaunty proposed' repos run update manager and install just the nautiuls, and nautilus-data packages.  Some have said that fixed their issues
2009-05-06T22:04:00.000Z	boxer_	mattgyver	morning :)
