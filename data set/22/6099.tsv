2007-02-04T16:20:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	see hidden files "ls -l .*" remove with "sudo rm -R ~/.Azureus"
2007-02-04T16:20:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	they could be anywhere though
2007-02-04T16:21:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	"locate Azureus"
2007-02-04T16:28:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	how do i add the /grep to that coz its so long
2007-02-04T16:29:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	what grep?
2007-02-04T16:29:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	ls -l etc |grep so i can see what comes
2007-02-04T16:30:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	ls - .* |grep ?
2007-02-04T16:32:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	yeah, try it. You can scroll up and down. Try nautilus, it lets you view hidden files.
2007-02-04T16:33:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	its not letting me scroll up and down with |grep
2007-02-04T16:33:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	"ls -l .* | grep .a
2007-02-04T16:35:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	actually I forgot what you were asking. Is this something to do with azureus?
2007-02-04T16:35:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	yes
2007-02-04T16:36:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	just wanted to check my hidden files and confirm that there are no more .hidden .files
2007-02-05T17:07:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	Colts!
2007-02-05T17:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	i've successfully installed azureus from sourceforge and its not crashing no more. But wondering if you can tell me how i can add it to my Application Menu
2007-02-05T17:11:00.000Z	vox754	livingdaylight	sorry. I haven't installed it yet, although I want to. It should be added automatically.
2007-02-05T17:11:00.000Z	livingdaylight	vox754	not from sourceforge unfortunately. From Synaptic yes..
