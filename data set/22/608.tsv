2011-06-20T15:12:00.000Z	tebinu		so i can then open port 5900
2011-06-20T15:12:00.000Z	tebinu		and do it via x11vnc.. thats easier for me and also makes it better when i want to vnc via my mobile phone
2011-06-20T15:12:00.000Z	tebinu		i am there but as far as i can see, it always says something about port 5900 :S
2011-06-20T15:13:00.000Z	tebinu		hmm
2011-06-20T15:14:00.000Z	tebinu		ah okay, will do that and come back in a minute
2011-06-20T15:14:00.000Z	tebinu		yea
2011-06-20T15:16:00.000Z	tebinu		change ports on my router then via the web administration
2011-06-20T15:16:00.000Z	tebinu		but port 80 is already forwarded by my router
2011-06-20T15:16:00.000Z	tebinu		so i cannot directly access it from here
2011-06-20T15:17:00.000Z	tebinu		i dont know anything about telnet and i dont want to break my router :S
2011-06-20T15:18:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	telnet <router-ip> then enter username and pass
2011-06-20T15:19:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	just do it via http
2011-06-20T15:19:00.000Z	tebinu	rcconf	not possible.. port 80 is forwarded to my apache at home
2011-06-20T15:21:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	nmap <router-ip> -p https
2011-06-20T15:22:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	yeah it's closed..
2011-06-20T15:23:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	so you want to access the router remotely right
2011-06-20T15:24:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	it's not the same than accessing in LAN
2011-06-20T15:26:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	dude if you are accessing it remotely you cant access telnet directly
2011-06-20T15:34:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	you should access the VPN with encryption for that you use a SSH tunnel so no one can sniff your VNC password.
2011-06-20T15:37:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	1- install, configure VNC and create a strong password (numbers, special chars, lower and uppercase) 2- create a ssh server with private key... connect to VNC using SSH server.
2011-06-20T15:43:00.000Z	rcconf	tebinu	yeah make sure you use strong passwords..
2011-06-20T15:46:00.000Z	tebinu	rcconf	thanks, already have a strong one :D
