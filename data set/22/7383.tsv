2006-12-24T08:31:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	a mac address is always six bytes long, no matter what OS you are using
2006-12-24T08:32:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	that's what I thought, but on Windows it _is_ longer,
2006-12-24T08:32:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	and different :S
2006-12-24T08:33:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	and you are sure both systems report the same network card?
2006-12-24T08:33:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	windows kinda of reports what it wants, It's also set up some kind of Gateway
2006-12-24T08:36:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	a firewire port can also be reported as a ethernet card (ethernet over firewire). maybe it is that one?
2006-12-24T08:38:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	also be aware that a mac address can be changed on linux (not in the real hardware but for the arp behaviour in the kernel)
2006-12-24T08:39:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	as long as an interface is down, you can do this: ifconfig eth0 hw ether 01:de:ad:be:ef:42

2006-12-24T08:40:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	not the same mac address
2006-12-24T08:41:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	but the two cards are obviously from the same manufacturer
2006-12-24T08:41:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	yes, they are - afaik. onboard ones from Abit
2006-12-24T08:42:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	ok I did that command, and it changed the mac adderss on eth0 - is that the same as my Windows one now?
2006-12-24T08:42:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	no, the mac address change takes only effect in linux and only until the next reboot
2006-12-24T08:43:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	I see, but I am still confused as to why the Windows mac address is longer than the Windows one (E00508D9719DCA)
2006-12-24T08:43:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	i dont know what windows does...
2006-12-24T08:44:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	hum, brb - booting into windows
2006-12-24T08:49:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	hi again
2006-12-24T08:49:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	Ok, I don't know what I am looking for - but it's not my Mac Addrress. I just checked the Mac address on Windows is the same. So what the hell is "00508d9719dd" it says it's the Ethernet Address ( This is from a licensing tool for Maya on Windows )
2006-12-24T08:50:00.000Z	POVaddct	AlexC_	now the world is consistent again :)
2006-12-24T08:50:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	omg what the hell. I am confused! that 00508d9719dd is my mac address
2006-12-24T08:50:00.000Z	AlexC_	POVaddct	it wasn't that before, gah - hold on
