2005-01-31T07:51:00.000Z	genaro	veristead	Remember Ubuntu is very gnome centered. If you need somethink from KDE things can get a little frustrating
2005-01-31T07:51:00.000Z	veristead	genaro	cnt KDE compile on it?
2005-01-31T07:51:00.000Z	genaro	veristead	How large is your hard drive?

2005-01-31T07:52:00.000Z	genaro	veristead	You can compile KDE, but the point of a precompiled distro is not having to do so...
2005-01-31T07:52:00.000Z	veristead		of space
2005-01-31T07:53:00.000Z	veristead	genaro	this is true.. as is i have KDE compiled on top of Apple's X-Windows system (X11)
