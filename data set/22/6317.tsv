2008-01-03T11:01:00.000Z	evil_tech		when i am using vista the ubuntu drive isnt in the bay
2008-01-03T11:01:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	How many drives do you have?
2008-01-03T11:01:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	2 physical disks?
2008-01-03T11:01:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	Back up a minute
2008-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	How many physical disks do you have
2008-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	OK - now is each disk SATA - or are some of them IDE?
2008-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	OK, Vista is on which drive?
2008-01-03T11:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	What does the partitioner say?
2008-01-03T11:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	What's the boot order in your BIOS?
2008-01-03T11:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	It could be that your BIOS gives preference to the IDE drives
2008-01-03T11:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	It needs to put grub on the first boot device
2008-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	Bad idea
2008-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	It's setup correctly
2008-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	Then it won't see vista - so you wont get it in your list of boot options
2008-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	It is setup correctly as is, go for it
2008-01-03T11:09:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	It does if he ever wants to keep them installed at the same time
2008-01-03T11:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	Oh
2008-01-03T11:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	evil_tech	so unplug it like you said
