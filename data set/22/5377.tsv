2007-05-13T09:11:00.000Z	sotec_prod		Is this the official Feisty channel now?
2007-05-13T09:11:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	it is
2009-04-01T04:57:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	an eays way to clean some up is apt-get clean, yes.  But, check /var/log for runaway log files
2009-04-01T04:58:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	I don't think I understand that. What's the significance of runaway log files?
2009-04-01T04:59:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	A log file that is far too large (assumingyou don't have a separate /var) and is taking up all of the space on your drive.
2009-04-01T04:59:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	I can safely delete the log files, yes?
2009-04-01T04:59:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	#ubuntu+1 for Jaunty support, thanks.
2009-04-01T04:59:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	Yes.  Well, you'll lose the data in them, but nothing will explode.
2009-04-01T05:00:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	I'll check the logs. Thanks.
2009-04-01T05:01:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	my entire /var/log folder is 6.6mb. that can't be it.
2009-04-01T05:05:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	uninstalling programs via Synaptic or apt-get is'nt going to free up space is it? I think (I don't remember) I set /home on it's own partition for contingency.
2009-04-01T05:06:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	Run baobab and see what's up.  Or du or something.  How many partitions do you have?  is it / and /home and that's it?  (df will tell you)
2009-04-01T05:12:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	Gparted reports that I do infact have a / dir and a /home seperate from that. / is indeed full. Now, the question of course, is: How do I free up space?
2009-04-01T05:16:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	Gparted reports that I do infact have a / dir and a /home seperate from that. / is indeed full. Now, the question of course, is: How do I free up space?
2009-04-01T05:22:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	How big is your /?
2009-04-01T05:23:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	9.78gb
2009-04-01T05:24:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	alright, so.  Since that's plenty, we have to figure out what's taking up so much space.  Try firing up baobob
2009-04-01T05:24:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	ok
2009-04-01T05:25:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	there is 104mb free now, but it still registers at 0 bytes
2009-04-01T05:27:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	there is 104mb free now, but it still registers at 0 bytes
2009-04-01T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	sotec_prod	How did you free it?  Also, a hundred megs isn't really significant.  What on earth is taking up 9GB?
2009-04-01T05:30:00.000Z	sotec_prod	Flannel	I freed the space by uninstalling via Synaptic
