2008-12-02T12:54:00.000Z	turuburu		hi people
2008-12-02T12:54:00.000Z	turuburu		what do u propose for vps with web server?debian etch, debian lenny or ubuntu 8.04, or 8.10? what is easiery to use for a server?ubuntu offers anything extra for a server?
2008-12-02T12:55:00.000Z	turuburu		joe the matter is i already a server with debian etch. i m wondering if i need ubuntu. till now i use ubuntu at deskops only. because i dont have any experience with ubuntu server, can u tell me some advantages of having ubuntu as server instead of debian?
2008-12-02T12:56:00.000Z	turuburu		i just need justification support for my wish to move to ubuntu server
2008-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	turuburu		i see joe. so all the management happens like debian. there is nothing that makes it easier than debian, in server level
2008-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	turuburu		right?
2008-12-02T12:58:00.000Z	Defrysk	turuburu	debian is as secure as ubuntu
2008-12-02T12:58:00.000Z	turuburu		so u propose ubuntu server. 8.04 not 8.10 yet, right?
2008-12-02T12:59:00.000Z	Defrysk	turuburu	804 (LTS)
2008-12-02T12:59:00.000Z	turuburu	defrysk	thanks for making this clear. i had idea that debian etch is rock stable and ubuntu maybe crash or being hacked. probably i had wrong idea
2008-12-02T13:00:00.000Z	Defrysk	turuburu	if you are used to debian there is no seripus reason for having to switch
2008-12-02T13:00:00.000Z	turuburu		so the correct decision is to put 8.04 64 bit. it will be stable and updated. and i must not update to 8.10. i must only update when 9.04 is available . right?
2008-12-02T13:00:00.000Z	Defrysk	turuburu	you dont have to switch then in another 4.5 years
2008-12-02T13:01:00.000Z	turuburu	defrysk	i m used at ubuntu at home (desktops). at server i have debian. i m thinking if  i must switch to ubuntu, if it will be easier to administer, and updated
2008-12-02T13:01:00.000Z	turuburu	defrysk	i mean what is the next trustworthy server version. since you propose no 8.10, then 9.04? to prefer only LTS versions?
2008-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	Defrysk	turuburu	I would go in serverworld ponly for lts versions
2008-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	turuburu	defrysk	what this means?
2008-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	Defrysk		lts = long term support
2008-12-02T13:03:00.000Z	turuburu		no i means what serverworld ponly
2008-12-02T13:03:00.000Z	Defrysk		!lts | turuburu
2008-12-02T13:03:00.000Z	turuburu		i know what is lts ;)
2008-12-02T13:04:00.000Z	Defrysk	turuburu	i ments for servers its best to use lts, lts versions of ubuntu are more geared to stability
