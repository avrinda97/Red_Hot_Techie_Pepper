2012-01-06T07:38:00.000Z	const_antine		hah :(
2012-01-06T07:38:00.000Z	const_antine		the secrets of hackers call my name, keeping me up at night
2012-01-06T07:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	its made by a company but yes, the OS is open source, if you read /etc/apt/sources.list   you can see the source repos as well as binary ones listed
2012-01-07T12:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	if its hardware relating to the ubuntu OS, here. If its hardware in general then try ##hardware
2012-10-28T19:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	do you mean sharing a folder?
2012-10-28T19:33:00.000Z	const_antine	ActionParsnip	sharing a directory
2012-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	const_antine	ActionParsnip	is there an alternative? For sharing with other Linux hosts?
2012-10-28T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	neither is better, or the other wouldn't exist
2012-10-28T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	both have strengths and weaknesses
2012-10-28T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	no its not, if one was better, nobody would use the other, and it would be dropped due to low popcorn
2012-10-28T19:47:00.000Z	const_antine	ActionParsnip	your first response was SAMBA, to my original question
2012-10-28T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	its a fast and dirty way to share folders, all OSes can access it
2012-10-28T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	it works and OSes can access it without extra software
2012-10-28T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	if you install openssh-server you will get an SFTP server too, secure but a little slower, Windows will need something like filezilla to access it
2012-10-28T19:50:00.000Z	const_antine	ActionParsnip	aside from convenience, in what meaningful way is smb different from nfs?
2012-10-28T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	http://wdtvforum.com/main/index.php?topic=5393.0
2012-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	https://duckduckgo.com/?q=smb+vs+nfs   source :)
2012-11-06T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	is it a desktop OS?
2012-11-06T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	you do know Lucid desktop has about 6 months support left?
2012-11-06T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	try the Lucid block of commands here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure
2012-11-06T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	personally I'd go for a clean install of Precise (for LTS support til 2017) or Quantal (for the latest bells and whistles)
2012-11-06T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	const_antine	a later alsa will probably help. Lucid has painfull old packages for a desktop OS imho
