2006-06-29T16:27:00.000Z	Tmob		how do i select how aggresive the laptop fan is ?
2006-06-29T16:28:00.000Z	Tmob		my laptop gets hot and i have to manually adjust fan speed to high with i8kfan
2006-06-29T16:28:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	you don't it is dynamic for how hot your processor is
2006-06-29T16:28:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	whoa ... thats no good
2006-06-29T16:28:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	you have acpi installed?
2006-06-29T16:28:00.000Z	Tmob	mada	right, so who decides which temp will trigger which fan speed.. i only see fan low and off modes being used generally when its auto-toggling
2006-06-29T16:29:00.000Z	Tmob	mada	i have acpi-support/acpid running
2006-06-29T16:29:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	oh, that's not good
2006-06-29T16:30:00.000Z	Tmob	mada	any idea how i can fix this?
2006-06-29T16:30:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	it would be in acpi config ... where ever that is
2006-06-29T16:30:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	i unfortunately don't have alot of experience with laptop linux
2006-06-29T16:30:00.000Z	Tmob	mada	hmm ok
2006-06-29T16:30:00.000Z	Tmob	mada	anyone you know i can catch?
2006-06-29T16:31:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	not off the top of my head ... the one guy i know who i think could fix it probably went to bed about 4 hours ago
2006-06-29T16:31:00.000Z	mada	Tmob	sorry :(
2006-06-29T16:31:00.000Z	Tmob	mada	no thats what i meant.. i can come back later ;)
