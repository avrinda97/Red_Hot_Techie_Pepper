2005-08-21T12:58:00.000Z	oonoon		hi, how can i get the ultimate help from ubuntu staff from a prob nobody managed to get through ?
2005-08-21T12:58:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	we are the closes to "ubuntu staff" as for tech support
2005-08-21T13:00:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: so, who's the ultimate specialist ; i've got a prob with my nvidia that hasn't been solved (also tried the linuxquestions.org forums, with many views, but no single useful reply)
2005-08-21T13:01:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	well just ask the question and if there is no help here try google or http://ubuntu.com/wiki
2005-08-21T13:03:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: i googled and ubuntu-wikied a little time ago :-) ; i've got a blank screen when i launch gnome (but it disappears after a few seconds); i see the nvidia logo, so the driver seems to be well installed (also the FPS considerably increased) ; but i can't leave gnome, otherwise i get the blank screen but this time, permanently
2005-08-21T13:04:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	the binary driver correct?
2005-08-21T13:05:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: i'm pretty sure of that
2005-08-21T13:05:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	and you installed just like said in the wiki?
2005-08-21T13:06:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	i followed every single word written there
2005-08-21T13:07:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	hmm and then it worked
2005-08-21T13:07:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	but what did you do to make it go to the blank screen?
2005-08-21T13:07:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: kind of, but i see that there're many probs around that
2005-08-21T13:08:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	what is your run level?
2005-08-21T13:09:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: 2
2005-08-21T13:10:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	so thge gui doesnt start up w/out startx
2005-08-21T13:11:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: i dont understand what you've just said ; i actually uninstalled the drivers, and i'm now on runlevel 2 and everything works fine, except the 3d acceleration
2005-08-21T13:11:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	do you *need* 3d?
2005-08-21T13:12:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: i dont like much this question :-) in the near future, i would need it
2005-08-21T13:12:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	hmm
2005-08-21T13:12:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	my opion what till then maybe they will have better drivers
2005-08-21T13:13:00.000Z	oonoon	hybrid_goth	: bah, that's weird, my card is not that new
2005-08-21T13:13:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	oonoon	hmm but the linux game is
