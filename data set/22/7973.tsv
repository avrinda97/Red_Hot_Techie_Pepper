2005-11-16T09:07:00.000Z	dooglus	za	it runs stuff as root
2005-11-16T09:08:00.000Z	dooglus	za	the packages is called 'unrar-nonfree' and it's in the multiverse repository.
2005-11-16T09:09:00.000Z	dooglus	za	you need to enable the multiverse repo
2005-11-16T09:10:00.000Z	za	dooglus	event not found
2005-11-16T09:10:00.000Z	dooglus	za	when I typed "!repos" here, the bot saw it, and responded with the text you need to read
2005-11-16T09:11:00.000Z	dooglus	za	see what ubotu said?
2005-11-16T09:12:00.000Z	za	dooglus	 i should be the root, but why do i have to type sudo before apt-get?  did i do something wrong during the install or forget some kind of permission
2005-11-16T09:17:00.000Z	za	dooglus	 do you play any games?
2005-11-16T09:19:00.000Z	dooglus	za	you don't need to log in as root - in fact it's discouraged, especially for n00bs
2005-11-16T09:19:00.000Z	dooglus	za	I don't play a lot of games, no.  I play DROD occasionally, and recently played GTA San Andreas and Fahrenheit - Indigo Child
2005-11-16T09:20:00.000Z	dooglus	za	I installed everquest yesterday - but it told me it was going to take 4 hours to download the patches, so I left the PC to it.
