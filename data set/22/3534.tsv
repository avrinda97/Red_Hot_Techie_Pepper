2009-08-16T02:01:00.000Z	diddy		Where is the /etc/modprobe.conf on Ubuntu 9.04 ?
2009-08-16T02:02:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	/etc/modprobe.d
2009-08-16T02:03:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	its a directory :-)
2009-08-16T02:04:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	there is no modprobe.conf in the dir modprobe.d
2009-08-16T02:06:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	but a lot of conf files, look at the contents
2009-08-17T01:52:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	use lsof -i | grep diddy (or whatever :-))
2009-08-17T01:53:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	why it can be done with netstat. I managed to do it before.
2009-08-17T01:53:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	I don't know, I use lsof for such things all the time
2009-08-17T01:54:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	 lsof -i | grep diddy doesn't output anything. It just hangs there.
2009-08-17T01:56:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	either wait for name resolution or use lsof -ni | grep diddy (or you have no connections open, then have a look at lsof -i alone)
2009-08-17T01:56:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	lsof -ni doesn't work at all. Switch unknown
2009-08-17T01:58:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	what does lsof -v show? I have revision 4.78
2009-08-17T01:59:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	I have the same revision
2009-08-17T02:00:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	ok, once more: try lsof -i, should give several lines
2009-08-17T02:03:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	that worked this time but only shows the current user's (me) open ports
2009-08-17T02:05:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	try with sudo
2010-05-05T00:29:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	dhcp either as server or as client
2010-05-05T00:29:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	don't play riddle games with us please - if you want help provide as much info as possible
2010-05-05T00:30:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	what do you want to know?
2010-05-05T00:30:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	I was referring to your "wrong" -- why don't you look into the docu of your router?
2010-05-05T00:32:00.000Z	diddy	guntbert	http://j.imagehost.org/0555/Screenshot_8.png
2010-05-05T00:34:00.000Z	guntbert	diddy	you didn't tell the whole sentences :-)  -- I guess "use dhcp server" = "enable the dhcp server"  while "auto ip" = use another dhcp server -- but you really should look into the docu of that thing :-)
