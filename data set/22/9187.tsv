2005-02-20T10:27:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	you've build DRI before?
2005-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	i'll try that next if i can't compile :)
2005-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	i'm still fearful i'll need a full kernel :)
2005-02-20T10:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	i'm in a little unheard of town called marengo

2005-02-20T10:43:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	taking a long time seems
2005-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	well, brb, seeing if X.org works :)
2005-02-20T10:52:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	any idea?
2005-02-20T10:52:00.000Z	tritium	Dreamer3_	don't know about that.
2005-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	tritium	Dreamer3_	it already is quite painless
2005-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	tritium	Dreamer3_	you're compiling your own?
2005-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	yeah, out of the box ubuntu alsa doesn't support my hardware and prevent gnome from even loading
2005-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	Dreamer3_	tritium	i mean i'm using the debian package, so it's not too hard :)
2005-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	tritium	Dreamer3_	oh, I see.
2005-04-16T09:31:00.000Z	tritium	Dreamer3_	did you get the nvidia issue resolved?
