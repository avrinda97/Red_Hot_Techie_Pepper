2006-11-04T06:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	hrm...
2006-11-04T06:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	what does glxinfo | grep render     return?
2006-11-04T06:14:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	same thing, several instances of  Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"
2006-11-04T06:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	what type of video card do you have also.
2006-11-04T06:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	hrm.. well thats definately an issue.  You could try adding "glx"  under the modules section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and then restart X  ctrl+alt+backspace
2006-11-04T06:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	Yeah thats definately wierd that an nvidia card would report an sis chipset.
2006-11-04T06:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	Which driver are you using?
2006-11-04T06:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	hmmm... well maybe they used the sis chipset back in the day or something.
2006-11-04T06:17:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	hmmmmm.
2006-11-04T06:18:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	but it should still identify itself as an nvidia card dont you think
2006-11-04T06:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	isn't an old card?
2006-11-04T06:26:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	yeah its pretty old, worked fine on *doz though
2006-11-04T06:26:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	with nvidia drivers?  or windows default drivers?
2006-11-04T06:30:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	come to think of it, the drivers i downloaded from the nvidia site failed, but drivers that came with the card worked
2006-11-04T06:30:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	When did you get hte card?
2006-11-04T06:31:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	about a year ago
2006-11-04T06:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	Yeah I'd be pulling the card out to see what the chipset says.  But that definately is goofy.
2006-11-04T06:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	who knows could have got misslabeled from whomever you bought it from.
2006-11-04T06:32:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	nope, its labeled mx440 by the manufacturer(whoever it is coz its definitely not nvidia), its chinese made
2006-11-04T06:33:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	oh, well i'll have to buy another card soon :(
2006-11-04T06:33:00.000Z	zsh	chuckyp	capitalidea, thanks
2006-11-04T06:34:00.000Z	chuckyp	zsh	np
