2009-04-19T14:12:00.000Z	jbee		Error reading block 4890166 (Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read) while reading indirect blocks of inode 1220629.  Ignore error? yes
2009-04-19T14:12:00.000Z	jbee		always same errors always yes to all but never corrected
2009-04-19T14:12:00.000Z	jbee		:p
2009-04-19T14:14:00.000Z	jbee		/dev/sda3: 18775/12214272 files (20.7% non-contiguous), 12333679/48827559 blocks
2009-04-19T14:14:00.000Z	jbee		what does it mean 20,7 non-contiguous?
2009-04-19T14:14:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	it's a degree of fragmentation
2009-04-19T14:16:00.000Z	jbee	kklimonda	no i mean this aftes some short reads and other thing i pasted before..
2009-04-19T14:18:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	have you tried running fsck with -f (to force check) ?
2009-04-19T14:18:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	-c checks for bad blocks
2009-04-19T14:19:00.000Z	jbee	kklimonda	i have done many fscks and it always show me same errors but never corrects them...that's the problem!i try -c now to see if it's going to help!
2009-04-19T14:20:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	and what are the exact errors?
2009-04-19T14:23:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	those i/o errors don't look good
2009-04-19T14:24:00.000Z	jbee	kklimonda	so any suggestions?
2009-04-19T14:24:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	check out if disk passes SMART test.
2009-04-19T14:25:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	smartctl -H /dev/sdX
2009-04-19T14:29:00.000Z	jbee	kklimonda	SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
2009-04-19T14:31:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	it doesn't sound good - I'd backup all data you can and replace it.
2009-04-19T14:33:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	yeah - Reallocated_Sector_Ct means that disk is getting bad blocks and 2047 is pretty high value
2009-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	looks like it - you could also check dmesg for any errors
2009-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	but i/o during sync and high Reallocated_Sector_Ct rate points to hardware failure
2009-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	jbee	kklimonda	some i always get some i/o errors when unraring files
2009-04-19T14:35:00.000Z	kklimonda	jbee	you shouldn't
