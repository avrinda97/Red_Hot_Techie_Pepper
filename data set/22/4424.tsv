2008-02-03T13:37:00.000Z	foo-nix		the ubuntu online documentation has no such thread about configuring ones sound.
2008-02-03T13:37:00.000Z	foo-nix		I mean, fail!
2008-02-03T13:38:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	Like that?
2008-02-03T13:38:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	Thank you
2008-03-29T17:10:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	What should I add?
2008-03-29T17:03:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	what does `sudo apt-get update` give you?
2008-03-29T17:06:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	what does `sudo apt-get update` give you?
2008-03-29T17:08:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	This: http://pastebin.com/m44baa80
2008-03-29T17:08:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	You don't have proper repositories for that other stuff, that's why.
2008-03-29T17:09:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	pastebin your sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list)
2008-03-29T17:10:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	Here is my source list: http://pastebin.com/d2dec6abe
2008-03-29T17:11:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	It looks all commented
2008-03-29T17:11:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	You just need to uncomment everything that the installer commented out.  See all the "Line commented by installer because it failed to verify" lines?
2008-03-29T17:12:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	Ah, I see, thank you. (I am new to ubuntu)
2008-03-29T17:14:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	Is it wise to just uncomment all, since they all say that they were commented out since the installer failed to verify (I had no internet when installing, for security reasons, and yes, I do securoty through obscurity)
2008-03-29T17:14:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61462/  is a modified (and cleaned up) one
2008-03-29T17:15:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	Thank you, especially for being my command line tool for uncommenting important stuff :)
2008-03-29T17:16:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	That *should* be identical to you uncommenting and merging like sources (and assuming you want universe and multiverse).  So if something doesn't work (I typed it all out, I proofread it though), you can use the old one to verify
2008-03-29T17:17:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	I will check for some frontend for editing this file, thank you for your help
2008-03-29T17:17:00.000Z	Flannel	foo-nix	System > Admin > software sources
2008-03-29T17:17:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	It seems like it worked
2008-03-29T17:20:00.000Z	foo-nix	Flannel	I see, thank you.
