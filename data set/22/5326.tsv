2010-06-04T07:15:00.000Z	bricky		any way to actually install windows from linux on a real partition?
2010-06-04T07:15:00.000Z	bricky		pleeease lol
2010-06-04T07:17:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	what I did a few days ago was to install linux on virtualbox inside another linux instance, then i used clonezilla to back it up amd then restore it to real drive
2010-06-04T07:17:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	 i am sure you could do the same, but you have to ensure that hardware matches
2010-06-04T07:18:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	what?
2010-06-04T07:19:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	I have a vbox on ubuntu
2010-06-04T07:19:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	what is clonezilla?
2010-06-04T07:21:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	 google it
2010-06-04T07:25:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	I hope it does what I hope it does lol
2010-06-04T08:28:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	could you walk me through what you did on clonezilla
2010-06-04T08:32:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	 clonezilla, you just clone your vistual partition and save the cloned data some where (prefereably on another drive)
2010-06-04T08:34:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	hmm okay thanks not what  can use for my issue :( but once i fix it i will use this
2010-06-04T08:35:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	 what is your issue
2010-06-04T08:35:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	you can try with the above recepie
2010-06-04T08:38:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	okay, hmm
2010-06-04T08:38:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	also depends what you want to do with linux, just use it or learn it
2010-06-04T08:38:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	I want to do both
2010-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	geoaxis	bricky	i would recommend that you should rid your self of windows
2010-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	okay gotcha,
2010-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	yep, linux is proving to be worth the hastle imo
2010-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	I havnt touched windows since and dont plan on using that
2010-06-04T08:40:00.000Z	bricky	geoaxis	ah, okay, will do
