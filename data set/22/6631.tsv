2006-09-01T14:33:00.000Z	SolanisDracon		hello there, i'm having an issue with scroll lock functions on my installation of dapper.  neither the scroll lock key nor the mouse wheel key function while booted to os, even though the scroll lock key functions during bootup
2006-09-01T14:33:00.000Z	SolanisDracon		if anybody could msg me with information on how to activate scroll lock on ubuntu, i'd appreciate it greatly
2006-09-01T14:35:00.000Z	SolanisDracon		once again, issues with the scroll lock functions in dapper.  neither keyboard nor mouse seem to have scroll lock function.  please message me with any info
2006-09-01T14:35:00.000Z	medfly	SolanisDracon	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf

2006-09-01T14:47:00.000Z	medfly	SolanisDracon	create a new line there in the end of that section, saying Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
