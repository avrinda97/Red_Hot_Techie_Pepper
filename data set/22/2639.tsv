2009-12-09T02:03:00.000Z	darrenlooby		Does anyone know, if you can mount all USB drives that are currently connected? CLI style
2009-12-09T02:05:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	you just use mount as usual: sudo mount <block device> <mount point>
2009-12-09T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	sure, but why?
2009-12-09T02:05:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	I have a computer set up that I connect to every now and then - and, it has a USB drive that doesn't mount when I WOL.
2009-12-09T02:06:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	I also sometimes plug a random USB mem stick in - so, I'd like to be able to just blanket tell it to mount any USB drive that is connected.

2009-12-09T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	is there a reason you don't just mount all devices after sda (or however many disks you have)
2009-12-09T02:11:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	most likely 'cause I don't know what I'm doing haha
2009-12-09T02:11:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	I don't know of an easy-one-command way to do what you ask
2009-12-09T02:11:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	looks like I found something that I need to learn much more about then
2009-12-09T02:12:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	just looking around the ubuntu wiki now
2009-12-09T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	if it wasn't for the "random" thing, you could just list them in your fstab
2009-12-09T02:15:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	cheers for the pointer - I can at least do it with one of them.
2009-12-09T02:15:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	make sure you use uuid
2009-12-09T02:17:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	I'm looking at changing the settings via gconf-editor
2009-12-09T02:17:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	good idea?
2009-12-09T02:18:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	if so, as I'm not at it - how do I change the "media_automount" settings via CLI?
2009-12-09T02:18:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	you may use gconftool-2
2009-12-09T02:24:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	looking good so far - thanks for that :D
2012-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	darrenlooby	no/be more specific
2012-06-07T16:30:00.000Z	darrenlooby	jrib	thanks. Got the answer I was looking for, despite being a little too vague.
