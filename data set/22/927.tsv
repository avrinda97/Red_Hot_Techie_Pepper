2011-01-12T17:29:00.000Z	flazzid		why is it saying this

2011-01-12T17:35:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	have you actually got the linux headers installed?
2011-01-12T17:35:00.000Z	flazzid	ne2k	is it ok to pm you
2011-01-12T17:35:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	you missed the slash off the beginning of the destination path
2011-01-12T17:35:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	no
2011-01-12T17:37:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	also you are using mv -T which makes it treat the destination as a file, not a directory, but you specified a directory. why?
2011-01-12T17:38:00.000Z	flazzid	ne2k	oops didnt notice that 1
2011-01-12T17:38:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	what guide are you following? what made you think you should be doing this?
2011-01-12T17:39:00.000Z	flazzid	ne2k	i am following the guide from http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=patching&DokuWiki=f125f415b6f00efac9d6b9e949840b9c  and i have to do it to be able to wep crack with my wifi card
2011-01-12T17:41:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	you are going to have to recompile the kernel. are you comfortable doing this?
2011-01-12T17:41:00.000Z	flazzid	ne2k	: no not really
2011-01-12T17:42:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	I have also noticed a rather more fundamental problem -- you are trying to patch the headers, when what you need to patch is the source. the headers are just for compiling against
2011-01-12T17:43:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	this is too complicated for you
2011-01-12T17:43:00.000Z	flazzid	ne2k	it might be but how am i supposed to learn
2011-01-12T17:43:00.000Z	ne2k	flazzid	try this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1155599
