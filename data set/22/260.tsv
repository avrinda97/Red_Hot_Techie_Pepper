2012-08-10T21:42:00.000Z	arnsa		guys what could be the problem, that wireless keeps disconnecting every ~10secs?
2012-08-10T21:43:00.000Z	arnsa		the signal is very good
2012-08-10T21:43:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: maybe your laptop?
2012-08-10T21:43:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	hm but he worked before an hour
2012-08-10T21:44:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: my hp compaq sometimes goes crazy and mutes or adjusts voice itsely, or you can see the screen mode switch between normal mode and presentation mode
2012-08-10T21:44:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: I have tihs problem in windows, though
2012-08-10T21:45:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: did your try the traditional way? resetting?
2012-08-10T21:45:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	I tried to restart the laptop, but that didn't help
2012-08-10T21:47:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: what about if you only use command line to use wireless
2012-08-10T21:47:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	what u mean?
2012-08-10T21:47:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: ah... this is another story then
2012-08-10T21:48:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: I thougt, it may be some application that may cause you to connect/disconnect. so, thought it may help to use terminal login only
2012-08-10T21:48:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	that could be, because I've been trying to install xfce, lxde etc today
2012-08-10T21:49:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: https://help.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-help/net-wireless-disconnecting.html
2012-08-10T21:50:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: the link is crap....leave it!
2012-08-10T21:50:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	none of these should be problem, because it started doing it before an hour or so
2012-08-10T21:51:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: I suggest leaving X out for login, and try like that
2012-08-10T21:52:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	what you mean?
2012-08-10T21:52:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: just try command line login
2012-08-10T21:53:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	what for?
2012-08-10T21:54:00.000Z	fnoyanisi	arnsa	: any possible modules/apps coming with XFCE that causes the problem
2012-08-10T21:54:00.000Z	arnsa	fnoyanisi	I'm running now unity but I still got the problem
