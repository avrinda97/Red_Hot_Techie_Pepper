2006-08-05T07:31:00.000Z	nu	cdubya	thank you
2006-08-05T07:32:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	no problem. If you follow the wiki, it's pretty simple
2006-08-05T07:32:00.000Z	nu	cdubya	i will.
2006-08-05T07:32:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	just know that it's read-only
2006-08-05T07:33:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	don't try to write to it.....write's not supported AFAIK
2006-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	or try epiphany
2006-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	nu	cdubya	is that a browser?
2006-08-05T07:46:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	yep
2006-08-05T07:46:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser
2006-08-05T07:48:00.000Z	nu	cdubya	thanks. ill give it a shot
2006-08-05T07:48:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	np.
2006-08-05T07:48:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	it's wicked fast
2006-08-05T07:49:00.000Z	nu	cdubya	i reinstalled FF and it went. but im gonna give epiphany a try
2006-08-05T07:49:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	I switched to epiphany a while back and haven't been to ff since
2006-08-05T07:51:00.000Z	nu	cdubya	FF has some nice plugins though
2006-08-05T07:51:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	no doubt, but I live without them. ;)
2006-08-05T07:51:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	if you can deal with a slim, fast browser with tabs, then try epiphany.
2006-08-05T07:52:00.000Z	cdubya	nu	it's functionality is a lot more basic, but I think that was the intention - to keep it lean and quick
