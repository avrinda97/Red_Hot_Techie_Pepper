2010-01-27T00:25:00.000Z	prodigel		Hi all. I'm searching for a light ftp client. I'm using mc but for some reasons I after some time I get disconnected and other errors
2010-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	perhaps nothing is wrong with the client; perhaps those errors are trying to tell you something is wrong.
2010-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	it gets disconnected that's for sure. It always happens after a longer idle period
2010-01-27T00:27:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	I really like mc, and I've tried reconfiguring  with no luck
2010-01-27T00:27:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	ok, but maybe it's not the software. perhaps it is something else.
2010-01-27T00:28:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	I thought so also, but using filezilla I don't get such 'timeouts'
2010-01-27T00:29:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	but filezilla is slow and I'm not used to it. I would like something that mimes mc interface: tabs and F5 and so on
2010-01-27T00:30:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	my final guess is that something in mc's ftp client implementation is wrong/deprecated
2010-01-27T00:30:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	you said you were getting errors as well?
2010-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	for example when trying cd ..  I get IO error 121
2010-01-27T00:31:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	cd .. works normally for going upper a directory
2010-01-27T00:32:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	I can't reproduce it now, I have to connect, wait for 15 minutes or so and then the scenario engages
2010-01-27T00:32:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	ahh. well, if that doesn't happen with other clients, then yeah, it sounds busted. if that client is in the repos, it would be kind of you to report a bug.
2010-01-27T00:34:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	do you use mc for ftp connections?
2010-01-27T00:37:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	I don't use ftp, sorry :-/
2010-01-27T00:38:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	np, thought you're into it since you tried to help ;)
2010-01-27T00:38:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	just arbitrary help debugging :)
2010-01-27T00:39:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	good for you. I still don't understand what drives people into helping other on irc. I once thought payments, but that's probably not the reason
2010-01-27T00:40:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	I see it as karma. I came in to ask a question... no one seems to know the answer, but I may as well take a moment or two to throw out a few snooty replies to silly questions... oh, and maybe actually help someone :)
2010-01-27T00:42:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	still there are persons who know so much and still help the poor. What are they in to?
2010-01-27T00:42:00.000Z	prodigel	Vlet	never mind, beer is taking for me :) Have a nice day/night
2010-01-27T00:43:00.000Z	Vlet	prodigel	lol... well, people who know a lot are often bored with their daily tasks and need a way to go flex their brain and boost their ego :p
