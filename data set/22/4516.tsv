2007-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		Winkman: What's the one to use for the freely rotating cube? I can't seem to find it
2007-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		ah nevermind I got it
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		Control-Alt Mouse Button 1
2007-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		:P
2007-12-17T13:11:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		Aero be damn! >:D
2007-12-17T13:12:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		I mean.. I collapsed the cube, and ran the benchtest on it, with a moving running in VLC media player and I was getting well over 100 FPS
2007-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		though right now I'm running 46...
2007-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		then again it is an old AGP nVidia 6600GT
2007-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		Probably the best thing to do would be to download an Ubuntu live cd and run the upgrade startup
2007-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	DarkW0lf		I do believe I saw one when I was installing
2007-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	Yeah I have that... I'll do that
2007-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	DarkW0lf	MontoyaC	get used to it :P
2007-12-17T13:18:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	I've used Redhat. I wouldn't put anything other than ubuntu on my machines. So simple
2007-12-17T13:18:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	Well, Ubuntu and Vista :-)
2007-12-17T13:19:00.000Z	DarkW0lf	MontoyaC	I've had trouble with older versions of Ubuntu
2007-12-17T13:19:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	I've only gotten into it recently. I've had trouble with the amd64 versions
2007-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	I was on here yesterday trying to get 7.10 working with my ethernet card... had to install 7.04 instead
2007-12-17T13:20:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	The whole industry sucks at 64 bit support. It's sad
2007-12-17T13:21:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	Seriously, that story makes me cry. No Internet for a year? That's horrible
2007-12-17T13:22:00.000Z	DarkW0lf	MontoyaC	I survived... whether I survived with my sanity is another thing :P
2007-12-17T13:24:00.000Z	DarkW0lf	MontoyaC	is that Ubuntu 64 bit problems?
2007-12-17T13:24:00.000Z	MontoyaC	DarkW0lf	I don't have the 64 bit installed anymore. Not worth it.
