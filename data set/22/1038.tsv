2010-12-14T00:19:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	its usually better to ask in public chat so everyone can help and benifit
2010-12-14T00:20:00.000Z	PhilipPhilip	GeekyAdam	I cannot update to meercat
2010-12-14T00:21:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	explain your situation more descriptively. are you using 10.04 and you want to go to 10.10 (Meercat)?
2010-12-14T00:39:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	it might help if you tried the command-line method of upgrading and copied all output to a pastebin
2010-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	PhilipPhilip	GeekyAdam	what pastebin will i install?
2010-12-14T00:45:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	you dont install pastebins. do a "/topic"
2010-12-14T00:45:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	(here in irc)
2010-12-14T00:46:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	its funny that you showed an error attemptign to isntall a pastebin, using a pastebin
2010-12-14T00:48:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	do the command-line method for upgrading, then copy-paste all the output in the paste.ubuntu.com pastebin you just used
2010-12-14T00:50:00.000Z	PhilipPhilip	GeekyAdam	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/543244/
2010-12-14T00:58:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	im not as proficient in this stuff as some others here, dont be scared to take other advice as well.
2010-12-14T00:58:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	id try to do a "sudo apt-get update -y" and "sudo apt-get upgrade -y" then retry the upgrade
2010-12-14T01:02:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	has the output changed at all?
2010-12-14T01:06:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	im checkin the output out some more.
2010-12-14T01:07:00.000Z	PhilipPhilip	GeekyAdam	 what file would I cat to see the errors scrolling on start up - they are probably related
2010-12-14T01:10:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	you need to enable the bootlogger: 1. edit file /etc/defaults/bootlogd (change "no" to "yes") 2. reboot - daemon is started at boot then stopped after it finishes 3. check /var/log/boot
2010-12-14T01:18:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	hmmm...
2010-12-14T01:23:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	this might be outside my realm of help. if i were u id google for the bootlogger problem and try to find out why its not putting anything in /var/log/boot (maybe its a different file?).
2010-12-14T01:24:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	if you figure out the solution, try to report back here. just curious.
2010-12-14T01:25:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	PhilipPhilip	RogueShadow has a point. your system  seems pretty buggy, you might beneifit from a freseh install. maybe its time. :/
