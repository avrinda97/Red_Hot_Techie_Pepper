2010-10-13T04:23:00.000Z	MrStein		switching to VT1 by ctrl-alt-F1 disconnects me from WLAN. Switching back to VT7 (X) makes it to reconnect. Is this by design?
2010-10-13T04:24:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	just tried it, didn't disconnect me at all
2010-10-13T04:27:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	you're running 10.10 ?
2010-10-13T04:27:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	yes
2010-10-13T04:28:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	I tried it in LiveCD. On desktop I connect by clicking the NM applet (then enter WPA2 key...). If I go to VT1 (or VT2,...) the ifconfig shows the interface has no IP address assigned. pings fail etc...
2010-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	perhaps it's hardware specific?
2010-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	no, I tried 2 PCs
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	MrStein		it was the same on both
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	do you have WLAN or wired?
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	so you're saying when you switch using Ctrl+Alt F1 it disconnects you?
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	MrStein		yes
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	WLAN
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	scott_ino		I can test on lan if you'd like/
2010-10-13T04:31:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	 I described it here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1594318
2010-10-13T04:31:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	did you set you connection as a system connection?
2010-10-13T04:32:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	just normal WLAN.... selected my SSID, entered in my WPA key (which is now saved in keyring) and away it goes
2010-10-13T04:33:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	well, if you ever feel bored, please try it in the Live environment and comment on that forum thread. ;)
2010-10-13T04:33:00.000Z	MrStein		thanks for now
2010-10-13T04:34:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	just tried it again, no issues.... even ran a few commands in VT1
2010-10-13T04:34:00.000Z	MrStein	scott_ino	well the obivous thing is to run ping on VT1 to see if it works
2010-10-13T04:36:00.000Z	scott_ino	MrStein	yes it works... sorry.. wish i could give you my working setup as i don't ever switch
