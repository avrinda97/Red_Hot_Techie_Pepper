2008-04-02T04:02:00.000Z	orudie		what are the main updates in the new version?
2008-04-02T04:02:00.000Z	orudie		how can i remove a user ?
2008-04-02T04:03:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	man deluser
2008-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	possibly one of these: iptraf, bwm, iftop, mtr, vnstat
2008-04-02T05:16:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	bandwidthd
2008-04-02T05:17:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	"apt-cache search bandwidth stat" will help
2008-04-02T05:17:00.000Z	orudie	LjL	isnt' a little to old ?
2008-04-02T05:17:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	what is too old?
2008-04-02T05:18:00.000Z	orudie	LjL	bandwidthd
2008-04-02T05:19:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	i don't know. it makes graphs, it supports relational databases. i can't really know what sort of thing *you* are looking for
2008-04-02T05:20:00.000Z	orudie	LjL	i think its bandwidhd is what i'm looking for, but i dont know it wasnt updated since 2005 so i didnt think it was fully compatable with everything
2008-04-02T05:20:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	if it's packaged in the official repositories (and it is), then it really should work with current Gutsy.
2008-04-02T05:21:00.000Z	orudie	LjL	so should i 'sudo apt-get install bandwidthd' ?
2008-04-02T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	it won't hurt to try it out, for sure.
2008-04-02T06:10:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	sudo apt-get --purge remove packagename
2008-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	lo is never a real interface, it's the "loopback"
2008-04-02T06:13:00.000Z	orudie	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61879/
2008-04-02T06:14:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	well, so, use eth0
2008-04-08T06:51:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	i don't think so, it's just an office suite. but there is evolution and thunderbird (and who knows how many others...)
2008-04-29T05:08:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	do try asking in #ubuntu-bots.
2008-04-29T05:08:00.000Z	LjL	orudie	there are quite a few listed.
