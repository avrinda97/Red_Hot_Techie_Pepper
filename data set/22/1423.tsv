2010-11-01T18:44:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	is 6GB a decent amount of memory for mostly desktop application use and perhaps a single windows 7 virtualbox session ?  what size swap would a person use with 6GB ram ?
2010-11-01T18:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	i will use just 1 Gib or so. unless you plan to suspend to disk
2010-11-06T18:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	linux usas bond[N] interfaces for that
2010-11-06T18:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	http://wiki.debian.org/Bonding
2010-11-06T18:16:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	that is correct.  i have a bond0   i want a failsafe fallover to wlan0 if bond0 breaks.  that manpage says it can be done with ifconfig
2010-11-06T18:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	see the wiki « bond_mode active-backup » <<<
2010-11-06T18:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	here http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt <<< linked in thw same wiki page you can see what each mode is
2010-11-06T18:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	please read the docs you are pointed to before asking further. for example « Active-backup policy: Only one slave in the bond is active.  A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails.
2010-11-06T18:19:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	your being a little strict on me, i'm a bit of a novice.  i've just been using link aggregation for some time.
2010-11-06T18:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	sorry if it sounded harsh
2010-11-06T18:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	so just copy the lines in the wiki and use the mode you prefer, if you want aggregation and fault tolerance use the first mode that is "balance-rr"
2010-11-06T18:22:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	i would like mode=4 for bond0 type however if bond0 is every broken, i would like a failover to wlan0 direct my wireless router  in the past if a 1 of 2 cables get broken in link aggregation i've lost all connectivity
2010-11-06T18:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	http://pastebin.com/xDU2FtRB
2010-11-06T18:26:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	i should be able to use 802.3ad which is mode=4 and have failover to wlan0   bond=4  has faster response times than round robin
2010-11-06T18:27:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	with failover to wlan0, i can simply correct my bonding issue somehow.  link aggregation works per the ubuntu documentation where as the bonding documentation has always tended to fail for me
2010-11-06T18:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	maybe ask in #networking
2010-11-06T18:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	no problem
2010-11-06T18:58:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	may i ask if you believe anyone else here might be skilled in the world of link aggregation ?  i would like to know if i can repeat my question at 15 minute intervals.
2010-11-06T18:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	maybe more help about it in #ubuntu-server
2010-11-06T18:58:00.000Z	k-rad	erUSUL	i appreciate the tip
2010-12-16T01:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	bios raid?
2010-12-16T01:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	k-rad	if the machine only has linux installed is better to use linux software raid
