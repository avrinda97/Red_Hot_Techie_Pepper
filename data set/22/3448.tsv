2009-04-08T12:43:00.000Z	Machtin		hey guys.. i got a few 100 files which have a .htm-extension - however, i want that extension to be removed.. how do i do that? i thought of something like mv *.htm /bla/*-htm
2009-04-08T12:43:00.000Z	Machtin		i'm fine with a tool, too
2009-04-08T12:44:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	for $file in .
2009-04-08T12:45:00.000Z	Machtin	raylu	mind giving me a complete command? i don't want to mess it up

2009-04-08T12:46:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	echo will show you what that script is doing. if it works, take out the echo
2009-04-08T12:47:00.000Z	Machtin	raylu	save as bash-script-file?
2009-04-08T12:48:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	yes. but i think i screwed that up; one sec
2009-04-08T12:48:00.000Z	Machtin	raylu	take your time :) i think "file" should be something like $file, %file, no?
2009-04-08T12:49:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	no and no. noext is a variable
2009-04-08T12:49:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	and ${file%.htm} strips the last ".htm" http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/refcards.html#AEN21811
2009-04-08T12:50:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	do these filenames have spaces in them?
2009-04-08T12:50:00.000Z	Machtin	raylu	nope
2009-04-08T12:50:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	http://rafb.net/p/EiSvTq90.html
2009-04-08T12:51:00.000Z	Machtin	raylu	thanks :)
2009-04-08T12:51:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	it didn't blow anything up?
2009-04-08T12:52:00.000Z	Machtin	raylu	didn't test yet
2009-04-08T12:52:00.000Z	Machtin	raylu	just wondering how to use it..
2009-04-08T12:52:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	put it in a text file and either chmod +x it or run "sh filename"
2009-04-08T12:53:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	nope. that's what the *.htm is for
2009-04-08T12:53:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	you could make it foo/bar/*.htm
2009-04-08T12:54:00.000Z	raylu	Machtin	nice
