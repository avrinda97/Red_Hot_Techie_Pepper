2007-11-22T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	synaptic does not connect o macromedia.com
2007-11-22T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	that doesn't change the fact your package manager will not connect to macromedia.com
2007-11-22T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	why ar eyou doing "update-flashplugin"
2007-11-22T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	you've already installed it
2007-11-22T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	you don't need to "update" it
2007-11-22T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	installing it puts it on the latest version
2007-11-22T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	owhat is your question, you don't make any sense
2007-11-22T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	you've already installed it
2007-11-22T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	you have install flash, you showed me the command you used
2007-11-22T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	well done, its done
2007-11-22T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	why are you doing that
2007-11-22T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	did you run "update-flashplugin" again ?
2007-11-22T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	that command does not connect you to macromedia.com
2007-11-22T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	that does not happen when you use apt-get
2007-11-22T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	show me the real command your using
2007-11-22T18:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Brother-OoN	I've just tested it and it connect so macromedia fine
2007-11-22T18:47:00.000Z	Brother-OoN	ikonia	do you have the alternate link to install flashplugin?
