2008-10-04T01:10:00.000Z	Oxygenfa1		"Unknown partition table signature
2008-10-04T01:10:00.000Z	Oxygenfa1		The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly."
2008-10-04T01:10:00.000Z	Oxygenfa1		What else can I do guys ?
2008-10-04T01:10:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	teaches you to type commands without checking what they do... anyway, try with the "mbr" package perhaps
2008-10-04T01:16:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	no you aren't screwed, and watch the language please
2008-10-04T01:16:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	you've deleted an important part of your boot sequence
2008-10-04T01:16:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	but it really is something that you can restore
2008-10-04T01:16:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	now, i'm not entirely sure whether or not the partition table is stored in the MBR, but even if it is (in which case, you don't have it anymore), the partition table can be "guessed" again
2008-10-04T01:17:00.000Z	Oxygenfa1	LjL	what should I do ?
2008-10-04T01:17:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	quick recap - what have you tried until now
2008-10-04T01:19:00.000Z	Oxygenfa1	LjL	I tried reinstalling grub,
2008-10-04T01:19:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	and now grub starts, but then complains - or does it not start at all?
2008-10-04T01:22:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	i have to go now, but i strongly suggest trying packages "gpart" and/or "testdisk" (testdisk is a bit involved to use), i'm sure others could help you with them. those can guess partition tables. (Juhaz)
2008-10-04T01:27:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	sudo apt-get install gpart ; sudo gpart -b ~/mbr_backup -W /dev/sda /dev/sda
2008-10-04T01:27:00.000Z	LjL	Oxygenfa1	assuming sda is the involved drive
