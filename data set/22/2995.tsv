2011-02-28T23:52:00.000Z	maddler		anyone with a Gobi 2000 wwan modem?
2011-02-28T23:52:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	jap whats the matter?
2011-02-28T23:53:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	can't make it work on a Sony Vaio VPCS notebook
2011-02-28T23:54:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	tried copying firmware files from Windows but nothing...
2011-02-28T23:54:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	tried gobi loader from repos?
2011-02-28T23:54:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	yes... it hungs after launching it...
2011-02-28T23:55:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	yap, that one ist broken i guess... mom
2011-02-28T23:55:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	I also tried latest 0.7
2011-02-28T23:55:00.000Z	maddler		same result
2011-02-28T23:57:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	hmfp.... so i guess there is no way to get it working. gobiloader ist the big problem. i have the same problems but it worked some time ago for me. know every time using it under windows it works exactly one time in ubuntu :/
2011-02-28T23:58:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	I think I saw something about having to "power on" the modem... in /sys/dev/something
2011-02-28T23:59:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	it has somthing to do with the gobiloader. You can check the usb
2011-02-28T23:59:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	sry
2011-02-28T23:59:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	usbID
2011-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	when firmware is not laoded it reads ID 05c6:9204 Qualcomm, Inc.
2011-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	ohterwise it reads ID 05c6:9205
2011-03-01T00:01:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	yes... perhaps... btw... not a big issue... I don't really need it, being able to use my phone as an access point. Just could've been useful sometime
2011-03-01T00:01:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	im using it on my thinkpad but have to reboot into windows and then again into linx :D
2011-03-01T00:02:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	hehe... I could consider installing Winblows on my notebook perhaps... :D
2011-03-01T00:03:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	nooooo :D itÂ´s just my gaming OS so please do not install windows just for using it to load the firmware, hahaha
2011-03-01T00:04:00.000Z	maddler	michiwend	well... I have no other use for windows... :D
2011-03-01T00:05:00.000Z	michiwend	maddler	yeah ;D... so what i wanted to say is, that the wwan card works properly for me so it does only depend on the firmware being loaded or not
