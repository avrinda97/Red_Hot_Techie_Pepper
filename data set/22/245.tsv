2012-06-23T18:50:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Juniper [Radeon HD 5700 Series] [1002:68b8]
2012-06-23T18:51:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	what do you mean "the entire session"?
2012-06-23T18:52:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	is that equivalent to what the "Additional Drivers" app does?
2012-06-23T18:55:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	apt-get install fglrx seemed to actually work.. it's asking for a restart so i will try that, brb
2012-06-23T19:01:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	hmm, that seemed to work
2012-06-23T19:03:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	post release updates in your case will do nothing for you I do not believe. Keep in mind also that the 12-5 version removed support for all of the HD 2xxx-4xxx cards. Yours is a 5xxx so you wont have an issue with that, but I expect your chipset is next to be dropped... so... latest is not often best with ATI
2012-06-23T19:05:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	this is still the case with the fglrx driver installed?
2012-06-23T19:05:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	if so, it is probably flash related
2012-06-23T19:05:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	yes, it's exactly the same
2012-06-23T19:06:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	i thought that, but it happens also on websites that don't have flash
2012-06-23T19:06:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	can you take a screenshot please?
2012-06-23T19:10:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	here's an example http://imagebin.org/217577
2012-06-23T19:10:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	i should probably point out that i'm using xubuntu
2012-06-23T19:11:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	oh yeah... that's... thats way wrong... do not expect it is flash.
2012-06-23T19:12:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	also, on some web pages it doesn't even update when i type text in a text box or click a check box
2012-06-23T19:17:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	I am tempted to agree with you, though I have not had this experience... something is funky with the driver... can you open catalyst and check the settings there?
2012-06-23T19:18:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	how do i open it? if i try to run it from the menu, nothing happens
2012-06-23T19:20:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	I would try sudo apt-get install fglrx-amdcccle-updates
2012-06-23T19:21:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	all already installed
2012-06-23T19:21:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	apt-cache policy fglrx-amdcccle | grep -i installed
2012-06-23T19:22:00.000Z	amagee	L3top	  Installed: (none)
2012-06-23T19:23:00.000Z	L3top	amagee	hmmm... I would try installing that. (me wonders how you got the updates without specifying...)
