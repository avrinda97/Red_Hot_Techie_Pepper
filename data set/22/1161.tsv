2011-06-07T14:58:00.000Z	dorst		hello everyone
2011-06-07T14:58:00.000Z	dorst		How do I solve the problem with ¨Nvidia Driver activated but not in use¨
2011-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	dorst		I searched all the internet for a good explanation but no chance
2011-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	dorst	after you installed the driver did you reboot?
2011-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	dorst		yes slooksterpsv
2011-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	dorst		I find in some place my video card is blacklisted
2011-06-07T15:00:00.000Z	dorst		I talk about ubuntu 11.04
2011-06-07T15:01:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	dorst	it could be a bug, as there's a lot experiencing the same issue, try this, if you go to your dash -> type in gnome-terminal, open that up and run: gksudo lshw -C display   and paste the output into a pastebin http://pastebin.ubuntu.com
2011-06-07T15:02:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	dorst	and send me the link that would be great, then we can see if it's a bug and is active or if it's not
2011-06-07T15:03:00.000Z	dorst		ok thanks just a sec
2011-06-07T15:08:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	dorst	 you can also install mesa-utils via: sudo apt-get install mesa-utils and then run glxgears and if you get high frame rate on that, it's installed
2011-06-07T15:14:00.000Z	dorst	slooksterpsv	here is the link http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/620744/
2011-06-07T15:16:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	dorst	hmmm... I'm betting it is installed, but if you really want to test it out, I'd install mesa-utils and run glxgears
2011-06-07T15:16:00.000Z	dorst		I get around 1179 FPS on glxgears
2011-06-07T15:16:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	dorst	oh yeah it's installed then, normally without the drivers I get like 80fps max, and with I get over 300 on my HD 4200
2011-06-07T15:17:00.000Z	dorst		realy? greate, but why that message is still there
2011-06-07T15:17:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	dorst	it's a bug

2011-06-07T15:18:00.000Z	dorst		o greate
