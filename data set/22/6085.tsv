2008-08-15T04:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	ah.. ok.. i'm not sure if you can get an Ipod to autostart Amarok or not.. never tried myself.
2008-08-15T04:49:00.000Z	Rockj	IndyGunFreak	I just got myself an iPod - I guess ill figure it out somehow tho

2008-08-15T04:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	cool.. good luck getting it workin.. :)
2008-08-15T04:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	i thought you said you tried that?
2008-08-15T04:52:00.000Z	Rockj	IndyGunFreak	I didn't try nautilus preferences, only system->pref->prefered applications..
2008-08-15T05:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	jsut right click and choose unmount... wait a second, and disconnect
2009-01-12T22:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	there's a bit of a work around.. what version of pidgin are you using?
2009-01-12T22:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	try this.. close pidgin, open a terminal... "sudo apt-get install msn-pecan".. restart Pidgin, create new Account, then in the drop down protocol, choose "wlm", and plug in your MSN account info
2009-01-12T22:14:00.000Z	Rockj	IndyGunFreak	that works like a charm.
2009-01-12T22:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	it seems to work for most.
2009-01-12T22:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	i've not got that one, not sure.
2009-01-12T22:15:00.000Z	Rockj	IndyGunFreak	try to update !brokemsn trigger with that specified information. Thanks for the help
2009-01-12T22:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Rockj	i'll suggest it to Jack_Sparrow
