2010-07-28T05:49:00.000Z	Kemp_Family		I have never use an IRC and I am having problems with internet connections in ubuntu 10.04
2010-07-28T05:50:00.000Z	Kemp_Family		could anybody help me
2010-07-28T05:50:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	How is your machine connecting to the internet?
2010-07-28T05:54:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	Sounds like a nameserver issue possibly. What do you have in /etc/resolv.conf?
2010-07-28T05:55:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	Open a terminal and type cat /etc/resolv.conf
2010-07-28T05:58:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	So if the output of ifconfig shows an eth0 interface, that means the driver is loaded so its just a matter of configuring it, in sys>prefs>networking
2010-07-28T06:01:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	Dont pm people
2010-07-28T06:10:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	You need to set your nameserver. In /etc/resolv.conf, you can put nameserver 192.168.1.1 or whatever you want to be your nameserver or you can just use sys>prefs>networking
2010-07-28T06:10:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	If you type ping 8.8.8.8, does it work?
2010-07-28T06:11:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	No, ping 8.8.8.8
2010-07-28T06:11:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	In your terminal
2010-07-28T06:13:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	ping
2010-07-28T06:13:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	ping 8.8.8.8
2010-07-28T06:22:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	You say wireless works in win7 but hardwire does not work in ubuntu. That isnt a fair comparison, even though I know you are trying to ultimately get wireless working, something could be physically wrong with your ethernet cable and/or termination connections
2010-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	Which wifi card do you have btw that you need a driver for?
2010-07-28T06:25:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	Can you ping your router?
2010-07-28T06:30:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	Assuming your routers ip is 192.168.1.1, can you try this? sudo killall NetworkManager && sudo /sbin/route del default && sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.110 && sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.1.1 && sudo /sbin/iptables -F && sudo /sbin/iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT && sudo /sbin/iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT && sudo /sbin/iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
2010-07-28T06:31:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	Then try to ping 8.8.8.8
2010-07-28T06:34:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	You should file a bug report then. It should justwork OOTB
2010-07-28T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	sudo dhclient eth0
2010-07-28T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	but you shouldnt have to do any of this because it should already be working
2010-07-28T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	Kemp_Family	or actually, you need to configure it in sys>prefs>networking
