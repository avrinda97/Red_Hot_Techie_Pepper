2012-02-08T21:24:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	Thank you
2012-02-18T07:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	remove packages: *-desktop (ubuntu,xubuntu,etc), xorg-common, then autoremove after that [i'd guess]
2012-02-18T07:42:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	It didn't reconize anything with the regex *-desktop
2012-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	i mean, ubuntu-desktop and/or kubuntu-desktop, etc
2012-02-18T07:43:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	it said ubuntu-desktop isn't installed
2012-02-18T07:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	then you don't need to uninstall it
2012-02-18T07:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	"dpkg -l"
2012-02-19T00:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	.profile should already contain a PATH line, that you can add to
2012-02-20T20:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	"chsh" as the user is another method
2012-02-21T22:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	check output of "mount" it needs to be unmounted first (be sure your pwd isn't in that mount)
2012-02-21T23:00:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	http://paste.ubuntu.com/851644/ It did say it twice.
2012-02-21T23:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	"type none" what filesystem is this?
2012-02-21T23:01:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	Idk, it just followed what some tutorial online told me to do. It doesn't say how to remove it.
2012-02-21T23:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	ummm, perhaps it's due to use of bind?
2012-02-21T23:02:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	Yes! How do I unbind it?
2012-02-21T23:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	what happens if you run "sudo umount /home/webmaster/name"
2012-03-22T17:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	she, ubottu is a women
2012-03-22T17:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	do you have an Ubuntu Software Center, or update running?  only one apt can run at a time.
2012-03-22T17:43:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	I was in the middle of an apt-get, but it was trying to remove PHPMyAdmin, and I didn't want that, so I exited out of SSH terminal.
2012-05-15T21:42:00.000Z	_Marcus	zykotick9	There are still many uses for telnet
2012-05-15T21:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	_Marcus	other then telnet-BBSs or muds - i can't think of any valid use-cases
