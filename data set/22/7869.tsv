2008-04-16T05:22:00.000Z	fish		anyone know why my box freezes when i try to boot with my video card installed?
2008-04-16T05:24:00.000Z	maw	fish	at what point does it lockup?
2008-04-16T05:24:00.000Z	maw	fish	after post and during gnome loading?
2008-04-16T05:26:00.000Z	maw	fish	the next time it locks up try "ctrl+backspace" I think that reloads X, might get you passed that point
2008-04-16T05:27:00.000Z	maw	fish	also try tapping the "numlock" and "capslock" key to see if the lights go on/off... if nothing happens the system is probably hardlocked
2008-04-16T05:30:00.000Z	maw	fish	I dont know off the top of my head. check grub dox + gnome startup dox
2008-04-16T05:30:00.000Z	maw	fish	try the cap/numlock trick to see if it is indeed hardlocked
2008-04-16T05:34:00.000Z	fish	maw	I am afraid i didnt under stand this: "maw> fish: I dont know off the top of my head. check grub dox + gnome startup dox" can you elaborate a little for me please?
2008-04-16T05:34:00.000Z	maw	fish	you asked how to enable verbosity... I said I dont know
2008-04-16T05:35:00.000Z	fish	maw	It was the dox that i wasnt understanding, Thank you doubledew
2008-04-16T05:35:00.000Z	maw	fish	sorry
2008-04-16T05:36:00.000Z	fish	maw	np maw, i will check those things and return with my results
2008-04-16T05:57:00.000Z	fish	maw	I tried the caps lock thing and the lights on the keyboard did nothing, no response
2008-04-16T05:57:00.000Z	maw	fish	are you dual booting to another OS?
2008-04-16T06:00:00.000Z	fish	maw	no
2008-04-16T06:00:00.000Z	fish	maw	I have fedora installed still but that only becaus i havnt transfered all my files over to Ub
2008-04-16T06:01:00.000Z	fish	maw	I dont boot fedora though
2008-04-16T06:01:00.000Z	maw	fish	and fedora loads fine?
2008-04-16T06:01:00.000Z	maw	fish	oh... the fact you logged off IRC I thought you were using *this* computer for dual booting
2008-04-16T06:01:00.000Z	fish	maw	yes, but not when i try to use the video card
2008-04-16T06:02:00.000Z	maw	fish	are you ona  liveCD now
2008-04-16T06:06:00.000Z	fish	maw	I have Ub installed completely on one HD and Fedora installed completely on another separate HD in the same box, I use GRUB boot loader to choose the OS and ubuntu is default
