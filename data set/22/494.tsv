2012-04-14T16:31:00.000Z	rsh		I am trying to copy a folder from to some other folder but it say permission denied
2012-04-14T16:32:00.000Z	rsh		anybody?
2012-04-14T16:32:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	to what other folder ?
2012-04-14T16:33:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	check folder owner please
2012-04-14T16:34:00.000Z	rsh	yrg	the folder to be copied or destination folder?
2012-04-14T16:34:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	both
2012-04-14T16:35:00.000Z	rsh	yrg	folder -to- be- copied is owned by root , while the destination folder is by normal user
2012-04-14T16:36:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	ok -- can you set original folder owner to yourself?
2012-04-14T16:37:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	yes, what jrib said would be helpful. copying root folder to /home/ isn't a normal thing to happen.
2012-04-14T16:37:00.000Z	rsh	yrg	both user accounts are mine
2012-04-14T16:39:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	what application are you trying to install? firefox should be in the Ubuntu repositotues, so it installs automatically. it doesn't ask default destination then
2012-04-14T16:41:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	how did you use sudo su? what part of this was done as root ?
2012-04-14T16:42:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	any error message when you try that?
2012-04-14T16:43:00.000Z	rsh	yrg	as normal user , while extracting it says cannot delete old files .....
2012-04-14T16:44:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	did you try to extract to a different directory?
2012-04-14T16:45:00.000Z	rsh	yrg	got it
2012-04-14T16:46:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	:) now you can use su to delete old files ;)
2012-04-14T16:46:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	going to compile firefox, are you? I get it's firefox and eclipse stuff
2012-04-14T16:47:00.000Z	rsh	yrg	its java project
2012-04-14T16:48:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	hmm, have fun :) (they tend to use 'sudo {command here}' rather than switching to root...) just ask if you have more questions.
2012-04-14T16:48:00.000Z	rsh	yrg	thanks for the tip
2012-04-14T16:49:00.000Z	yrg	rsh	i personally don't change that, because i can see which of the admins did what -- rather than seeing all the stuff as done by 'root' -- but there might be few other cons and pros that I didn't consider
