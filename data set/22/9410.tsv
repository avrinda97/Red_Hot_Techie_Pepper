2005-04-12T14:38:00.000Z	holycow		anyone know how paper size is controlled in ubuntu?  /etc/papersize does nothing, and configuring cups via gnome gui does nothing ... any tips?
2005-04-12T14:39:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	go to the website of cups daemon
2005-04-12T14:39:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	i.e. localhost:631
2005-04-12T14:40:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	uhh yes you can go there then click on manage printers then go to configure printer the paper size is right there
2005-04-12T14:41:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	look in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
2005-04-12T14:42:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	hrmm well you'll just have to be clever :)
2005-04-12T14:42:00.000Z	holycow	cowbud	heh :) smartass
2005-04-12T14:43:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	setup a root passwd and see if it works..mine does
2005-04-12T14:46:00.000Z	holycow	cowbud	thats interesting
2005-04-12T14:46:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	work out for ya?
2005-04-12T14:47:00.000Z	holycow	cowbud	i found a weird quirk, i've been trying to print test pages via gnome cups manager ... that only sends out a4, yet, i can print from other apps to 8.5x11 but not legal
2005-04-12T14:48:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	btw wtf are you smoking even in gnome-cups-manager I can change the paper..
2005-04-12T14:48:00.000Z	holycow	cowbud	i can change it to whatever i want
2005-04-12T14:48:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	through what program?
2005-04-12T14:49:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	hrmm...odd
2005-04-12T14:50:00.000Z	holycow	cowbud	*nod* i frankly can't believe it either
2005-04-12T14:50:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	did you check for bugs?
2005-04-12T14:54:00.000Z	holycow	cowbud	thx

2005-04-12T14:55:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	the fun part about bugs is playing the game "Whose bug is it anyway"
2005-04-12T14:56:00.000Z	cowbud	holycow	hey cows have to stick together
2005-04-12T14:56:00.000Z	holycow	cowbud	haha :) that too *nod*
