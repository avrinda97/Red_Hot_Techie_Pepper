2005-09-09T11:56:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser		would anyone like to answer my question???
2005-09-09T11:56:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	did you compile it yourself?
2005-09-09T11:57:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	and what's happening?  Did you add an entry to /boot/grub/menu.lst and run sudo update-grub ?
2005-09-09T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	not sure
2005-09-09T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	perhaps you didn't compile in a necessary option
2005-09-09T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	why not just use an ubuntu kernel?
2005-09-09T12:00:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	is it a G5?
2005-09-09T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	did you try building newer alsa modules first?
2005-09-09T12:02:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	I didn't
2005-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	you might consider that rather than a new kernel
2005-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	I have just installed alsa driver and library
2005-09-09T12:04:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	what package names?
2005-09-09T12:04:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	but it throws an error when try to open alsamixer
2005-09-09T12:05:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	no, that's not what I meant for you to do
2005-09-09T12:07:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	so what did you mean I should do?
2005-09-09T12:07:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	how is sound not working, first of all?
2005-09-09T12:08:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	well I go to system->prefs->sound and try to play any sound and there is no sound :)
2005-09-09T12:09:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	can you tell me if you see any files in /proc/asound?
2005-09-09T12:10:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	yes I do, cards  devices  modules  oss  pcm  seq  timers  version
2005-09-09T12:10:00.000Z	tritium	alex_theosxuser	did you check the mixer to make sure things aren't simply muted?
2005-09-09T12:11:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	I did type alsamixer, but it said 'function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device'
2005-09-09T12:11:00.000Z	alex_theosxuser	tritium	is there any othe mixers??
