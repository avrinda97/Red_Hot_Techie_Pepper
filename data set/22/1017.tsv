2011-04-30T02:54:00.000Z	cache_surplus		hello, im trying to ubuntu 10.10 32bit on a windows xp laptop. when i boot to cdrom, windows xp continues to own the laptop...
2011-04-30T02:54:00.000Z	cache_surplus		usb not an option
2011-04-30T02:55:00.000Z	cache_surplus		netboot not an option, no pxe
2011-04-30T02:55:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	sounds like an issue with grub installer
2011-04-30T02:55:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	oh?
2011-04-30T02:56:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	i think its a bios proprietary issue,,, maybe your right, can you help assist in trbshting?
2011-04-30T02:56:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	beyond me, but yes check bios setting
2011-04-30T02:59:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	for usb try looking for usb options like enhanced or 2.0 vs 1.1
2011-04-30T02:59:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	one moment ok,,, ActionParsnip for a second
2011-04-30T03:00:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	explain. thanks
2011-04-30T03:07:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	some pc do not show the option unless device is connected/has a disk in it
2011-04-30T03:08:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	i tried usb install first before cd, usb first then cd always for me
2011-04-30T03:08:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	on some pc I have to go into the boot options page (f-10 or 12) to see the cdrom as bootable
2011-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	im done with the basics, i need the work around
2011-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	might need to use the alternate cd
2011-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	nope, been there done that,, your right, but im past that stage
2011-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	make sure there is nothing that's 'protecting' your boot sector
2011-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	have you used freebsd? that wouldnt even allow me to load it
2011-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	last freebsd I used was 2.2.2
2011-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	 well,,, its improved since then lol
2011-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	n3glv	cache_surplus	seen a few usb sticks that would not boot
2011-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	cache_surplus	n3glv	regarding your mbr fix
