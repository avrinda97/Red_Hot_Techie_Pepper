2005-06-30T12:35:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		Why is the menu structure for gnome so complicated?
2005-06-30T12:35:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		it should be based off an xml file or something simple in ONE place
2005-06-30T12:36:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		not .desktop files scattered over god knows where
2005-06-30T12:36:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		and it should be modifiable by a right clean
2005-06-30T12:36:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		click
2005-06-30T12:38:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		Is there any reason for the menu to be so damn complicated?
2005-06-30T12:38:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		hasn't there been discussion about it?
2005-06-30T12:38:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	Yes...  The menu discussion is about 6 years old.....
2005-06-30T12:39:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	HermanDE	and who came to the conclusion that .desktop files were the way to go?
2005-06-30T12:39:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	Then Debian decided to utilize a new application called menu.
2005-06-30T12:40:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	it was a decision of GNOME not the distro providers...... That is why just about every debian based system uses menu
2005-06-30T12:40:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	HermanDE	does ubuntu use menu?
2005-06-30T12:40:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	it is debian based.....
2005-06-30T12:41:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	HermanDE	what exactly does "menu" do?
2005-06-30T12:41:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	It provides a system for syncronizing all window managers......
2005-06-30T12:42:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	Such that you can modify a menu under KDE and see the change under GNOME or blackbox.
2005-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	Uh...  Like I said.  For the most part it is solved...  Where have you been?
2005-06-30T12:43:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	HermanDE	doesn't seemed solved from a GUI standpoint, there shouldn't be a need for an application like smeg (even though its great) if you could just right clean and add stuff...
2005-06-30T12:45:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	Because each window manager development team thinks that their system is much better than someone else....
2005-06-30T12:45:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	HermanDE	well gnome's sucks :P
2005-06-30T12:45:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	This is why a compiled version of KDE or GNOME has a large amount of this cruft.....
2005-06-30T12:45:00.000Z	HermanDE	thechitowncubs	and why a proper distro will smooth the edges......
