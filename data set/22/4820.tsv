2007-10-03T07:37:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	so you installed winxp after ubuntu?
2007-10-03T07:38:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	was it bootable before you tried that tutorial?
2007-10-03T07:40:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	you may have a hardware problem, as neither windows or ubuntu runs on your box
2007-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	simplechat_	magnetron	i have been using ubuntu stably for the past week
2007-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	is it stable no?
2007-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	installing ubuntu does not alter your windows setup in any way
2007-10-03T07:42:00.000Z	simplechat_	magnetron	it removes its bootloader, which for some reason, xp needs to have
2007-10-03T07:42:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	you said that windows was booting....
2007-10-03T07:43:00.000Z	simplechat_	magnetron	windows was booting, then i install ubuntu, then winxp bluescreens on boot
2007-10-03T07:43:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	did you try to run a "fix mbr" from windows?
2007-10-03T07:46:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	it sounds like your hard drive is damaged
2007-10-03T07:46:00.000Z	simplechat_	magnetron	how would i test it?
2007-10-03T07:48:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	if you hard drive is damaged, you'll need a new one
2007-10-03T07:49:00.000Z	simplechat_	magnetron	how to i check that its damaged?
2007-10-03T07:49:00.000Z	magnetron	simplechat_	listen to ikonia, he has told you several times
