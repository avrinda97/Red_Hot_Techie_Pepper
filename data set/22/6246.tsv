2006-11-24T07:22:00.000Z	maghat		Kuja:_ I have used Infineon, TwinMOS, and now Kingston (ValueRam) but have also used vanilla OEM RAM chips and never had a problem so far :)
2006-11-24T07:23:00.000Z	maghat		runpain:_ please, for your own safety, *don't* login as root user. There are many reasons why Ubuntu does not allow it
2006-11-24T07:25:00.000Z	maghat		actually I don't like the sudo thingy, I have root enabled but I (usually) know what I'm doing :p
2006-11-24T07:26:00.000Z	maghat		or you can run "sudo passwd root" and enter a root password. Then open a terminal, login as root, as use it for administrative tasks.
2006-11-24T07:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	please don't recommend that in a channel for new users
2006-11-24T07:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	see /msg ubotu root for Ubuntu's default way of doing things
2006-11-30T06:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	there is one around somewhere
2006-11-30T06:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	but it doesn't seem half as mature
2006-11-30T06:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	http://beranger.org/index.php?article=1221
2006-11-30T06:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	so why do you need a k3b-GTK replacement? :P
2006-11-30T06:05:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	looks pretty clear to me. Nice little quick options. Edit it to have whatever you want
2006-11-30T06:06:00.000Z	maghat	apokryphos	You mean K3b ?
2006-11-30T06:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	yes
2006-11-30T06:08:00.000Z	maghat	apokryphos	 I know K3b very well, I just wish it was native gnome. I mean, I can make it look like a gnome app, but it doesn't feel like a gnome app (because it isn't)
2006-11-30T06:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	kde apps are like that; they're allergic to ugliness!! </troll>
2006-11-30T06:09:00.000Z	maghat	apokryphos	so you are a fellow kubuntista
2006-11-30T06:10:00.000Z	maghat	apokryphos	So am I. KIO Slave forever lol
2006-11-30T06:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	I actually hate a *lot* of stuff regarding msn messenger's usability
2006-11-30T06:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	*especially* the latest one
2006-11-30T06:35:00.000Z	maghat	apokryphos	I agree, but it's still *fun* to use
2006-11-30T06:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	maghat	what feels bloated? MSN messenger?
2006-11-30T06:41:00.000Z	maghat	apokryphos	no, openoffice does :p
