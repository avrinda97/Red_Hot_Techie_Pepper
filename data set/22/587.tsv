2011-07-09T22:50:00.000Z	RebelKeith		hey, I'm tryng to figure out how to add a new partition to linux without messing up grub
2011-07-09T22:52:00.000Z	RebelKeith		hmm, well I cant do that right now, I dont have a live cd and I have really slow internet here
2011-07-09T22:53:00.000Z	RebelKeith		hehe, I guess so
2011-07-09T22:54:00.000Z	RebelKeith		I'm on dsl, but the slowest one you con get
2011-07-09T22:54:00.000Z	RebelKeith		*can
2011-07-09T22:54:00.000Z	RebelKeith		I have the iso at home, I'm at work right now
2011-07-09T22:55:00.000Z	RebelKeith		I just dont have blank cds
2011-07-09T22:55:00.000Z	RebelKeith		not with me
2011-07-09T22:56:00.000Z	RebelKeith		I can add a partition, the problem I have is that grub look in the wrong place for linux after I add a new one
2011-07-09T22:56:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	that might just be an issue of editing the grub configuration
2011-07-09T23:00:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	do a cd /boot/grub and see whats in the menu.1st file?
2011-07-09T23:02:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	okay ummm...
2011-07-09T23:03:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	Think any of this is relevent? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition
2011-07-09T23:05:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	are you going to have to shrink an existing partition to make room for the new one?
2011-07-09T23:05:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	If thats the case then you'll need to get a live cd of some kind as discussed earlier
2011-07-09T23:06:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	Reason being that you can't modify a partition that is mounted while the system is in use.
2011-07-09T23:06:00.000Z	RebelKeith	factotum	no, I copyed my ald 250gb hdd to this 500gb hdd, so I have 250gb unpartitioned space
2011-07-09T23:07:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	oh then you should just be able to create it from the free space if you have gparted installed in the system
2011-07-09T23:09:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	Hmm, not sure what to tell you there.
2011-07-09T23:11:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	You might want to see if there is a #gparted channel on here and ask there, Im willing to bet there is a way to avoid that problem
2011-07-09T23:11:00.000Z	factotum	RebelKeith	I'd love some trial and error, but I don't have a spare system to fsck up near by
2011-07-09T23:31:00.000Z	RebelKeith	factotum	hey, I did some reading and found menu.lst was renamed to grub.cfg, but when I try to open it it says p.rmission denied
