2011-06-09T04:03:00.000Z	anadon		Hey, I'm using the Ubuntu 11.4 x64 live CD to try and diagnose an issue with my MALBAL Lotus laptop.  I'm trying to find out the extent of damage to my SSD, and whether the MOBO is about to die because of kernel panics that occur half the time when booting this CD.  If this is not the right channel, what is?
2011-06-09T04:05:00.000Z	anadon		hello?
2011-06-09T04:05:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	We hear you, if someone is able to answer, they will. Wait a few minutes then re-ask the question.
2011-06-09T04:08:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	What do you mean by "extent of damage"?
2011-06-09T04:09:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	i.e. do you normally use Ubuntu or something else?
2011-06-09T04:10:00.000Z	anadon	rationalOgre	I don't know if I'm looking at near or total system failure or just that the SSD needs replacing.  I've never dealt with hardware damage to this extent before.
2011-06-09T04:10:00.000Z	anadon	rationalOgre	I usually dual boot Ubuntu and win 7 pro
2011-06-09T04:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	Ok. Are you getting tons of bad sectors?
2011-06-09T04:12:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	sounds like a possibility. try installing smartmontools
2011-06-09T04:13:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	And see if you can bring up the smart information for the drive
2011-06-09T04:13:00.000Z	anadon	rationalOgre	do you know what a mobo failure looks like exactly
2011-06-09T04:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	A total failure would be a complete inability to boot the system.
2011-06-09T04:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	What you have would be an intermittent or sporadic failure.
2011-06-09T04:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	Possibly of just one of the bridge chips.
2011-06-09T04:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	Either way, you're looking at probably sending it back to Malibal to be repared.
2011-06-09T04:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	The question is,  is the ssd dead too? Or is it just the mobo.
2011-06-09T04:16:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	where are you seeing the IO errors? While booting?
2011-06-09T04:16:00.000Z	anadon	rationalOgre	looking into it now...I'm seeing them while booting, then I have to force shutdown and try again
2011-06-09T04:17:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	paste the output of dmesg somewhere
2011-06-09T04:22:00.000Z	anadon	rationalOgre	Ok, all SMART tests point to disk failure.  How do I check the mobo?
2011-06-09T04:24:00.000Z	anadon	rationalOgre	Ok, all SMART tests point to disk failure. How do I check the mobo? 
2011-06-09T04:26:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anadon	I'm sorry, diagnosing a failing motherboard is long and involved. You can google the subject if you like. Basically it involves stripping the system down to bare bones, shutting off stuff in the bios, then re-enabling and reinstalling stuff 1 at a time until you find out what is failing. If you make it all the way through and it still does it then you most likely have a bad motherboard.
