2010-01-21T12:28:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie		when I try alsamixer, I get "function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device" -- Any ideas? I really need some help with this...
2010-01-21T12:29:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	are you using intel sound?
2010-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	Garlique		I can in just a moment praj
2010-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	Garlique	I don't believe so.
2010-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	Garlique		but I desperately need to turn off this stupid autosearch behavior
2010-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	Garlique		its soo annoying
2010-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	what sound card are you using or is it integrated
2010-01-21T12:32:00.000Z	Garlique		Anyone have ideas about how to disable this behavior
2010-01-21T12:32:00.000Z	Garlique		when you type something in a window it pops up in a box in the lower right hand corner
2010-01-21T12:32:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	Garlique	It's a SigmaTel one, and it's built into my laptop.
2010-01-21T12:32:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	you might try using the package gamix
2010-01-21T12:33:00.000Z	Garlique		gnome alsa mixer
2010-01-21T12:33:00.000Z	Garlique		it seems to function better than alsamixer
2010-01-21T12:36:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	Garlique	gnome-alsamixer works, but I'm frustrated that alsamixer stopped working--it used to, and I'm worried that it could result in other sound issues (I do a lot of sound recording/production, so I like everything to be working properly)
2010-01-21T12:39:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	I understand,, im not sure what to say other than ubuntu at least for me is not the absolute best with sound
2010-01-21T12:40:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	it seems that unfortunately there are problems constantly creeping in.. Sorry to have to say that and I know its not all that helpful but..
2010-01-21T12:41:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	I have intel sound for example, and it works great in 8.04 but is completely broken in 9.04
2010-01-21T12:42:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	and not only is the sound broken but issues with the sound-card drivers in 9.04 cause the video to stop working
2010-01-21T12:42:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	Garlique	well thanks, at least, for trying to help. :) I'll just cross my fingers that I won't have any problems when trying to use JACK or other audio apps.
2010-01-21T12:42:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	Yah just double-test everything first before a live run
2010-01-21T12:43:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	Garlique	Ooh. I'm glad that I don't have video problems.
2010-01-21T12:43:00.000Z	Garlique	ZoeyMarie	yah it is no fun at all.. I love 9.04 but with video problems and no sound its not that useable lol
