2009-01-12T06:22:00.000Z	John`Anderson		ooops i forgot the space
2009-01-12T06:22:00.000Z	yow|laptop		yes, most people feel that way about Linux displays
2009-01-12T06:23:00.000Z	John`Anderson		:)
2009-01-12T06:23:00.000Z	yow|laptop		well good, you're all set to become an expert and help others now John`Anderson :)
2009-01-12T06:24:00.000Z	John`Anderson		hope so, im still a newbie at linux but im learning... and ive said it and i'll say again, its A LOT better than Windows.. the only prob is getting software developers to start developing for it instead of windows..
2009-01-12T06:25:00.000Z	yow|laptop	John`Anderson	- you will find that in a lot of cases, the software that Linux has available is equal or superior anyway
2009-01-12T06:26:00.000Z	John`Anderson		thats true, and it's free
2009-01-12T06:26:00.000Z	yow|laptop		yes John`Anderson free in every sense
2009-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	John`Anderson		i was talking to a friend on another network, and we got into the subject of windows security issues.. and i told him, i think pretty honestly that its a marketing tactic
2009-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	John`Anderson		with windows you're FORCED to buy and upgrade
2009-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	yow|laptop	John`Anderson	- i make a fair bit of money on the side cleaning and reinstalling windows boxes. i dont mind ;)
