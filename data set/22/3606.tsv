2008-07-24T06:34:00.000Z	Joki		Yes.
2008-07-24T06:34:00.000Z	Joki		Also did Speedtest.net
2008-07-24T06:35:00.000Z	Joki		Histo: Maybe I should reinstall my network adapter?
2008-07-24T06:35:00.000Z	tj83	Joki	sometimes sites like www.speedtestnet.net cache's the file. so when you refresh then it basically gives your the speed read from the hdd.. not the site. so its giving you an inaccurate display.
2008-07-24T06:36:00.000Z	Joki	tj83	I download from newsgroups. Giganews.com
2008-07-24T06:36:00.000Z	Joki		my download is 2400kbs

2008-07-24T06:36:00.000Z	Joki		On windows speed is a little higher than on Ubuntu
2008-07-24T06:36:00.000Z	Joki		My download was 2400 now its 500
2008-07-24T06:37:00.000Z	Joki		its a big difference. from 2400 KB's to 500 KB's
2008-07-24T06:38:00.000Z	Joki		Thanks for trying Histo.
2008-07-24T06:39:00.000Z	Joki		I am going to uninstall my network adapters and reinstall them with fresh drivers
