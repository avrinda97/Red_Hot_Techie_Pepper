2010-08-18T06:37:00.000Z	M5800		@delware i think if ure install linix, u should only put 1 HD in and vice versa
2010-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	M5800		delware: then from there u can use the BIOS to boot from which first. Im not sure whether it works anot, no experiance
2010-08-18T06:39:00.000Z	M5800		richiie: same problem here, i think the driver is not ready out of the box
2010-08-18T06:41:00.000Z	M5800		Broz, is it possible that a fresh install of linux, and when i boot into linux and use it, the OS might make my graphic card heat up as compared to using windows? Maybe because it has not have a better driver yet?
2010-08-18T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M5800	 ive rarely heard of Video Card OVerheating issues.. those things tend to either kick the fans on HIGH  if the drivers are not properly controlling the fans.. or they throttle down if getting too hot.
2010-08-18T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M5800	 you playing some 3d games in linux?
2010-08-18T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M5800	 its possible the fan controlls under windows are not as optmized. but that should just make the fans run more/louder.
2010-08-18T06:43:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	it's because i installed it, and i was using it as normal, trying to find a solution to get my internet working, so basically no better/new drivers are installed yet. Then half way, it shuts down. I opened up the top and can really tell the GFX is REALLY heated up. as compared to running it in windows
2010-08-18T06:44:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	Happens all the time bte
2010-08-18T06:44:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	btw i mean
2010-08-18T06:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M5800	 i would find it odd that just the normal desktop would overload any video card.
2010-08-18T06:46:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	yeah never encountered this before. my other installations went fine. only with this Desktop. Btw i can see the fans move the same in both WIN and LINUX. so i thought it was ubuntu running the clock too high? because of some incompatible out of the box drivers?
2010-08-18T06:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M5800	 what video card anyway?
2010-08-18T06:47:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	GT220 it's an Acer Desktop btw.
2010-08-18T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M5800	 check the forums perhaps. Ive not seen anyone else mention similer issues with nvidia cards overheating.
2010-08-18T06:48:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	Nvidia GT220
2010-08-18T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M5800	 as a test.. you could just boot to the console  and let it sit for a while and monitor the heat..
2010-08-18T06:48:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	yeah... i might just give up on making it work haha. Because it's my siblings desktop anyways... i have my own machine to use it on
2010-08-18T06:49:00.000Z	M5800	Dr_Willis	yeah i was planning to do that, now waiting for the GFX to cool down
