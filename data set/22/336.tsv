2011-12-08T11:24:00.000Z	djdduty		hello, where is the download for ubuntu server for a 64 bit intel processor?
2011-12-08T11:25:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	djdduty	http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download
2011-12-08T11:25:00.000Z	djdduty	totesmuhgoats	which one on the list?
2011-12-08T11:25:00.000Z	djdduty		they all look the same to me =/
2011-12-08T11:25:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	djdduty	what kind of processor?
2011-12-08T11:25:00.000Z	djdduty		intel
2011-12-08T11:25:00.000Z	djdduty		and I beleive it has 64 bit support
2011-12-08T11:25:00.000Z	djdduty		allthough I am running 32 bit windows
2011-12-08T11:26:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	djdduty	core i something or core 2 something?
2011-12-08T11:26:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats		the one that says amd64
2011-12-08T11:26:00.000Z	djdduty		but, isn't that only amd cpu support?
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	djdduty	nope
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	djdduty		I thought thats why it said amd64...
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	djdduty		weird
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	djdduty		ok, well thanks!
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	djdduty	the intel 64 bit architecture is for servers
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats		the desktop computers with intel 64 bit chips use amd64
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	djdduty		so ubuntu-server-11.10-amd64.iso.torrent?
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats		or sometimes its called x86~64
2011-12-08T11:28:00.000Z	totesmuhgoats	djdduty	if you want the server edition, yes
2011-12-08T11:28:00.000Z	djdduty	totesmuhgoats	I do
2011-12-08T11:28:00.000Z	djdduty	totesmuhgoats	thank you very much
