2009-07-27T20:06:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	possibly.  what is the problem?
2009-07-27T20:06:00.000Z	lilcoconut		well im traying to install several programms on ubuntu btu i just cant
2009-07-27T20:06:00.000Z	lilcoconut		and no they are not .exe files
2009-07-27T20:07:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	ok so most of the stuff you will want to install can be found in the ubuntu repositories.  basically you just go into add/remove programs and add from there.  can you give an example of a problem you need to install?
2009-07-27T20:09:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	i might not be able to help so probably best to keep it in the channel. in case someone else can assist
2009-07-27T20:09:00.000Z	lilcoconut	pepperjack	i tried to install pidgin
2009-07-27T20:10:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	ok. did you get an error?
2009-07-27T20:10:00.000Z	lilcoconut	pepperjack	no i didnt... i unzipped the file and clicked on the install button
2009-07-27T20:11:00.000Z	lilcoconut	pepperjack	but it didnt work...
2009-07-27T20:11:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	ok.  ubuntu is actually a lot easier than this to install.  its not like windows where you have to track down individual apps.
2009-07-27T20:11:00.000Z	lilcoconut		Pepperjack: ok. so how do i install things?
2009-07-27T20:11:00.000Z	pepperjack		!synaptic | lilcoconut
2009-07-27T20:11:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	basically you just choose it from a list and ubuntu downloads and installs for you
2009-07-27T20:12:00.000Z	lilcoconut		and where do i find this list?
2009-07-27T20:12:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
2009-07-27T20:13:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	system --> administration --> synaptic   basically
2009-07-27T20:14:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	or from a terminal you can apt-cache search pidgin or whatever then sudo apt-get install whateverpackagename
2009-07-27T20:16:00.000Z	lilcoconut	pepperjack	i cant find pidgin though
2009-07-27T20:17:00.000Z	pepperjack	lilcoconut	open a terminal.  what does sudo apt-get install pidgin     <--- what does that say?
2009-07-27T20:19:00.000Z	lilcoconut	pepperjack	i am confused... i have the german ubuntu version....
2009-07-27T20:20:00.000Z	lilcoconut	pepperjack	could it be that Kopete also works for using icq or msn?
