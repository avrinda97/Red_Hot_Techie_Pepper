2006-04-16T16:44:00.000Z	roostishaw		can anyone tell me what user accounts are not needed?
2006-04-16T16:45:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	the ones you see are system accounts and should not be removed
2006-04-16T16:45:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	the ones that are created by default should be left alone
2006-04-16T16:46:00.000Z	roostishaw	mwe	ok
2006-04-16T16:46:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	they're not login accounts and should not pose a security risk
2006-04-17T16:34:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	if you run it as normal user it's pretty safe
2006-04-17T16:34:00.000Z	roostishaw	mwe	ok thats what i meant... but why is there any risk at all.
2006-04-17T16:34:00.000Z	roostishaw	mwe	?
2006-04-17T16:35:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	I can't think of any risks except auto accepting crappy dcc sends
2006-06-07T16:51:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	cant you just leave the text empty?
2006-07-29T05:11:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	appearently it doesn't know how to supply the deps
2006-07-29T05:11:00.000Z	roostishaw	mwe	and how would i fix that?
2006-07-29T05:11:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	install them manually
2006-07-29T05:11:00.000Z	roostishaw	mwe	...how?
2006-07-29T05:11:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	try your ./configure and look at the errors you get
2006-07-29T05:12:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	they will suggest what is missing
2006-07-29T05:13:00.000Z	roostishaw	mwe	but it must be broken on my comp. it wont let me get build-deps for any package
2006-07-29T05:14:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	I see. it sounds odd
2006-07-29T05:14:00.000Z	roostishaw	mwe	:(  where should I start?
2006-07-29T05:15:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	well I would see if manually getting some dependencies would make it work better in the future.
2006-07-29T05:16:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	it's not been perfect for me either
2006-07-31T06:54:00.000Z	mwe	roostishaw	refresh it?
