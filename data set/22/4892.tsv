2007-09-21T06:01:00.000Z	wo0f		omg, why do ubuntu insist on putting their stamp on everything
2007-09-21T06:02:00.000Z	wo0f		:P
2007-09-21T06:03:00.000Z	wo0f		think im going to go and install debian again :S:S:S
2007-09-21T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	wo0f	isn't that xchat-gnome that you got?
2007-09-21T06:03:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	yup, thats the one
2007-09-21T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	wo0f	then get xchat without the -gnome. xchat-gnome is a severely mutilated (but slightly more gnome looking) version of xchat. i'm quite sure the plain xchat package will do fine.
2007-09-21T06:04:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	agreed!
2007-09-21T06:05:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	what is better in ubuntu than debian?
2007-09-21T06:05:00.000Z	LjL	wo0f	but no need to revert to debian for that, we have that package...
2007-09-21T06:05:00.000Z	LjL	wo0f	very subjective. i'd say testing focused on desktop use, for instance
2007-09-21T06:06:00.000Z	LjL	wo0f	which is only better if you use it for a desktop - but
2007-09-21T06:06:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	yes isnt it. iv only ever used debian for a server tbh
2007-09-21T06:06:00.000Z	LjL	wo0f	though even for servers, ubuntu tends to churn out security patches earlier, they say
2007-09-21T06:06:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	but yeh, im running this off my laptop, so i guess ill stick with ubuntu
2007-09-21T06:08:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	thanks for the persuasive words!!! :D
2007-09-21T06:08:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	just gonna switch xchats
2007-09-21T06:08:00.000Z	LjL	wo0f	just keep in mind that xchat (non-gnome) is in Universe, not in Main, so you have to have that enabled
2007-09-21T06:14:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	haha, yes this is much much better
2007-09-21T06:15:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	hmmm any ideas why theres still no user list?
2007-09-21T06:18:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	ignor me:P figured it out
2007-09-21T06:24:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	do you know a linux app that is similar to winamp?
2007-09-21T06:28:00.000Z	wo0f	LjL	tritium, does ubuntu have fglrx-control?
