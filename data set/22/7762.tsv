2006-01-02T10:42:00.000Z	Broxtor		Hi, I installed apache2 and php4 with apt-get install apache2 php4, but when I try to open a php file, the browser asks me if I want to download or open the file.
2006-01-02T10:43:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	you need to make a symlink to /etc/apache2/mods-available/php4* in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2006-01-02T10:44:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	thnx. I will give that a try
2006-01-02T10:47:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	How should that link be called? I now get an unknown file error.
2006-01-02T10:48:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	it should have the same name as the original file
2006-01-02T10:48:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	ls -l should look something like this, except with php4:  lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 37 Dec 21 14:54 php5.conf -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf
2006-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	and you need the .load too
2006-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	php4.conf and php4.load are already present in mods-enabled
2006-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	as symlinks?
2006-01-02T10:50:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	I'm browsing from another pc in LAN.
2006-01-02T10:52:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	if by browsing you mean samba, I don't think you're going to have much luck with symlinks.  better to use ssh.
2006-01-02T10:53:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	By browsing I mean accessing html pages on the computer running apache. For configuring I'm using a remote desktop connection with a shell.
2006-01-02T10:53:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	ok... so are the php4 entries in mods-enabled symlinks or regular files
2006-01-02T10:54:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 37 2005-12-28 17:51 php4.conf -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/php4.conf
2006-01-02T10:55:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	and did you say that was already there, or you put it there?
2006-01-02T10:55:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	I just put it there, but it was also already present
2006-01-02T10:55:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	what do you get if you restart apache and try to access a .php
2006-01-02T10:57:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	on the server self it works now, but not from the LAN
2006-01-02T10:58:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	Works on LAN now also, but only with Konqueror. Firefox keeps asking to save the file.
2006-01-02T10:58:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	clear your cache in firefox
2006-01-02T10:59:00.000Z	Broxtor	trappist	That did the trick! Thanks a heap!!
2006-01-02T11:02:00.000Z	trappist	Broxtor	anytime
