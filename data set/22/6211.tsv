2009-08-30T03:24:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo		hey guys is there anything for ubuntu x64 that is like daemon tools for windows, wher eu cant mount an bin or cue file to a virtual cd rom....  i couldnt get acetoneiso to work properply in the 64 bit environment
2009-08-30T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	I compiled  acetoneiso  on  32bit  Karmic alpha 4, and yep it works great
2009-08-30T03:25:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	sebsebseb	what about for 64bit though
2009-08-30T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	I think that's basically the only one, and it's really just a GUI for  commands it seems
2009-08-30T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	the other computer has  Ubuntu  9.04  64bit on  it now, but I don't have a reason to try out acetoneiso on it,   altough I could,  and  well  I woudn't now
2009-08-30T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	did you compile actoneiso from source, or  get a Deb for it?
2009-08-30T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	apparantly the  get deb  website debs can be a bit dodgy
2009-08-30T03:27:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	sebsebseb	yeah i cant even remove it lol
2009-08-30T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	I assume that's where you got it from
2009-08-30T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	well that site isn't offical  by the way
2009-08-30T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	ah yes it wasn't a standard compile  for  the  source for acetoneiso,   but you do extract it to a folder yep,  then just follow the instructions
2009-08-30T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	maybe you would end up with two acetones though I don't know,  you sure you can't remove the one you installed?
2009-08-30T03:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	what about if you open Synaptic and search for it?
2009-08-30T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	well it will  of put files  in   differnet folders, and  I guess  you  could manually remove that,  but would need to know where it put stuff and all that,   so  uhmm  I can't be of much help with that
2009-08-30T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	true, but  they might conflict with each other,  I am thinking,  or  possibily not, Ubuntu isn't WIndows after all
2009-08-30T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	you can  extract   the source manually,  or  hold on and I can give you a command
2009-08-30T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	manualy I meant to put graphicalley
2009-08-30T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	open the read me and do what it says
2009-08-30T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	yep pretty straight forward
2009-08-30T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	oh I just saw,  you  copied in for uninstalling, not installing
2009-08-30T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	,but yes the stuff in the read me file is pretty straight forward
2009-08-30T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ForzaPalermo	what are you mounting by the way?
