2010-03-02T08:18:00.000Z	arand	bethany	In the maintenance shell does it say "run fsck manually"?
2010-03-02T08:19:00.000Z	bethany	arand	not sure i typed cat /etc/fstab
2010-03-02T08:21:00.000Z	arand	bethany	yea, at this stage the system has pretty much decided not to tuch the filesystem before it's checked thouroughly, are you still at the maintenance shell now?
2010-03-02T08:22:00.000Z	bethany	arand	ya i am ive been googling but i just am at a loss of what to do.
2010-03-02T08:23:00.000Z	bethany	arand	it happened a few days ago too so i reinstaled / ... so maybe its my hdd going bad? win still boots fine. and its always my / partition that does this.
2010-03-02T08:23:00.000Z	bethany	arand	my baby unplugs my laptop that doesnt charge anymore several times a day.
2010-03-02T08:24:00.000Z	arand	bethany	reapeated fsck errors could be a sign of hardware failiure, but yes, repoeated power cuts can also do messy things to the filesystem if not shutdown cleanly.
2010-03-02T08:24:00.000Z	arand	bethany	are there important data on the filesystem in question?
2010-03-02T08:26:00.000Z	arand	bethany	there is a command available which will either fix it or if unlucky break it even more (I've experienced both)...
2010-03-02T08:26:00.000Z	bethany	arand	well aslong as it only breaks / and not /home with it
2010-03-02T08:27:00.000Z	arand	bethany	Do you have them on separate partitions?
2010-03-02T08:27:00.000Z	bethany	arand	ya i do
2010-03-02T08:31:00.000Z	arand	bethany	Recommendations: QUOTE: "Try recommending to boot a liveCD first, perform a dd backup, force-mount the filesystem, attempt to extract /etc, and then pull the trigger.  That makes is less likely to be horrible when something goes wrong."
2010-03-02T08:33:00.000Z	arand	bethany	or you could just "close-eyes-pull-trigger", as someone so nicely put it.
2010-03-02T08:43:00.000Z	arand	bethany	You still there?
2010-03-02T08:44:00.000Z	bethany	arand	ya
2010-03-02T08:46:00.000Z	arand	bethany	hmm, that is normally quite a bad sign. And if that's where the important files are I'd definitely say a partition clone using dd would be a good idea to make sure.
2010-03-02T08:46:00.000Z	arand	bethany	was this from the maintenance shell?
2010-03-02T08:47:00.000Z	arand	bethany	How did you run fsck and what kind of errors did it give
2010-03-02T08:48:00.000Z	bethany	arand	i just typed fsck /dev/sda7 in maint shell
2010-03-02T09:12:00.000Z	arand	bethany	if /dev/sda7 is your /home and important I would definitley do a dd backup before doing any more fsck.
