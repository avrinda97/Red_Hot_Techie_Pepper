2008-03-30T03:54:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	if you have this many problems using 64bit you should consider switching to 32 bit; there seems to be a way to set up a chroot 32bit app though it is a bit complicated
2008-03-30T03:56:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	then some reading is in order; this is not the 64bit training channel
2009-01-21T14:57:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	sure
2009-01-21T14:57:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	its a front end for apt
2009-01-21T14:58:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	so you can sudo apt-get install packagename for example from the terminal (cli)
2009-01-21T14:59:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	you can also manually change your repos at /etc/apt/sources.list though synaptic / adept make it much easier
2009-01-21T14:59:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	lenny?
2009-01-21T14:59:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	you are using ubuntu or debian
2009-01-21T15:00:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	just open a terminal and apt-cache search packagename/related term
2009-01-21T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	check out the ubuntu wiki
2009-01-21T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	stephan	and one other set of links
