2012-10-09T07:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	/path/to/binary.exe
2012-10-09T07:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	No, I mean that to run a CLR binary from a bash shell you simply have to enter the path to said binary (including './' if you are entering a path relative to the current directory) just like any other executable.
2012-10-09T08:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	Only if those .exe files are either CLR binaries, or (if you have wine installed) windows binaries. And the extension doesn't matter, it's just that CLR binaries tend to be named .exe.
2012-10-09T08:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	Common Language Runtime, the virtual machine binary language used by C#/.Net.
2012-10-09T08:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	Yes, any command that can be run locally can be run remotely (though in some cases, like commands which launch a GUI, special preparation is needed).
2012-10-09T08:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	What is the output of "lsb_release -r"?

2012-10-09T08:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	Even when you're using ssh, you're using a unix shell.
2012-10-09T08:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	Are you trying to run this software locally or remotely?
2012-10-09T08:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	Then I need the output of "lsb_release -r" when run on the remote machine.
2012-10-09T08:18:00.000Z	[x]	Jordan_U	what is lsb release ?
2012-10-09T08:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	"lsb_release" (not "lsb release") is a command which prints information about the OS.
2012-10-09T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	What distribution is being used on the remote machine?
2012-10-09T08:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	cjb.net provides access to FreeBSD servers. Try asking in ##FreeBSD.
2012-10-09T08:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	You already have Mono, the .NET implementation for GNU/Linux, installed on your Ubuntu machine. You do *not* however have it installed on the FreeBSD server you're trying to use. We can't help you with FreeBSD here.
2012-10-09T08:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	Please use complete, properly spelled and punctuated, English sentences. I have no idea what you just asked.
2012-10-09T08:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[x]	I don't know. I would expect so, but I have never looked for any myself.
