2012-11-10T03:16:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	I have no idea what videlia is but this seems like a generic problem to connect to X
2012-11-10T03:16:00.000Z	Emery	_DanN_	It's a Tor component
2012-11-10T03:17:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	are you trying to run this app as different user than the one which started X ?
2012-11-10T03:17:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	does this app need to have root permission ?
2012-11-10T03:19:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	understand but why would gui app need root permissions ? tor is a web browser ..
2012-11-10T03:20:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	where is your X server running ? do "ps -ef | grep X" for us
2012-11-10T03:21:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	there is no server running
2012-11-10T03:21:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	are you sure you're on the box you're supposed to be ?
2012-11-10T03:23:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	I don't see the proof in the output you've provided
2012-11-10T03:24:00.000Z	Emery	_DanN_	X is running. So back to the problem, what is the problem with Vidalia
2012-11-10T03:25:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	no, your X is not running
2012-11-10T03:25:00.000Z	Emery	_DanN_	are you retarded ?
2012-11-10T03:25:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	do 'pidof X'
2012-11-10T03:25:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	and stop insulting me please
2012-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	prove it
2012-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	Emery	_DanN_	stop answering me please.
2012-11-10T03:34:00.000Z	_DanN_	Emery	plese prove that your X is running and we can move on
2012-11-10T03:34:00.000Z	Emery	_DanN_	Stop with your input
