2011-08-25T07:20:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	Why not just use the package manager?
2011-08-25T07:20:00.000Z	olabaz	usr13	no i downloaded a folder from a website
2011-08-25T07:20:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	A folder?

2011-08-25T07:21:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	tar jxvf tar.bz2   #Will untar and decompress it.
2011-08-25T07:21:00.000Z	olabaz	usr13	yeah i decompressed it and i opened the readme and it tells me to run 5 commands
2011-08-25T07:22:00.000Z	olabaz	usr13	i ran the first 3 but when I get to make it doesn't work
2011-08-25T07:22:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	But if you just want to install usbmuxd  just use the package manager, you'll be glad you did.   sudo apt-get install usbmuxd
2011-08-25T07:23:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	Are you using slackware?
2011-08-25T07:23:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	/join ##slackware
2011-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	If you are using ubuntu, just do  apt-get install usbmuxd
2011-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	olabaz	usr13	that gives me: E: Couldn't find package usbmuxd
2011-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	apt-cache search usbmuxd
2011-08-25T07:24:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	Yes, as zykotick9 says, show us the version number.
2011-08-25T07:25:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	8.04 is passed EOL
2011-08-25T07:25:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	If you have your update manager set to LTS, you should be able to upgrade to 10.04
2011-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	After that, you whould have a better go of it.
2011-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	olabaz	usr13	i tried  upgrading and it crashed
2011-08-25T07:26:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	Try again.
2011-08-25T07:27:00.000Z	usr13	olabaz	You can just do a fresh install.  Back up /home and pop in 10.04 or 11.04 and do a fresh install.
