2007-12-18T04:07:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	mount -r DEVICE
2007-12-18T04:08:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	iam new. can you tell me how to do it in gui.. iam using kubuntu
2007-12-18T04:09:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	I don't think you can do it from a gui, but if you can open kommand or whatever it's called
2007-12-18T04:10:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	how to do it in konsol... exactly?
2007-12-18T04:10:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	should be somewhere in the kmenu, if you can't find it press alt+F2, then type xterm. it's not as pretty, but it works
2007-12-18T04:12:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	then
2007-12-18T04:13:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	do you know the device name? (as in /dev/sdc or whatever?)
2007-12-18T04:15:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	sda6 and sda6 and sda4 in /dev                       mount point /media
2007-12-18T04:16:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	so the command: "mount -r /dev/sda6" should work, let me know if it shows an error
2007-12-18T04:17:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	dont you have to give mount point
2007-12-18T04:17:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	dont you have to give mount point ? and whats -r for?
2007-12-18T04:18:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	-r is read only, and you don't always need a mount point, since you mounted it before it should still be in mtab or fstab and thus mount point not needed.
2007-12-18T04:19:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	i mounted it as ntfs.  not i changed it to fat
2007-12-18T04:19:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	sorry, but I don't understand what you just said
2007-12-18T04:20:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	i mounted it as ntfs in the first place .  no i changed it to fat
2007-12-18T04:20:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	i mounted it as ntfs in the first place . i went to windows and changed it to fat.  now its changed  to fat
2007-12-18T04:21:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	fat16 or fat32? doubt it'd matter though. "mount -r -t fat /dev/sda6" if that doesn't work add the fat type to the end
2007-12-18T04:22:00.000Z	peterpan_	scragar	will it be writeable if i log as root?
2007-12-18T04:23:00.000Z	scragar	peterpan_	dunno, root has over-right perms for a lot, but root can't edit an iso file that's mounted, so I can't imagine it being too much different
