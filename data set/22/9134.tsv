2005-05-26T12:05:00.000Z	danko123456	dr_willis	did you have to turn on the audigy somewhere, do you remember?
2005-05-26T12:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	danko123456	 i do recall the mixer controlls for that card are a little 'odd' :P in ways - dependong on if you use the digital out or analog out.
2005-05-26T12:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	danko123456	 i installed some of the alternatve alsa mixers also. and twiddled a LOT with them. :P
2005-05-26T12:20:00.000Z	danko123456	dr_willis	you still here? do you know how to turn off the on board card, and turn on the audigy one?
2005-05-26T12:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	danko123456	 ive always used the bios to disable the onboard sound. Or i guess ya could blacklist its modulkes and not let them get loaded. the Gentoo ALsa Guide - has a lot of good info also I recall.
2005-05-31T12:26:00.000Z	danko123456	dr_willis	heh...
