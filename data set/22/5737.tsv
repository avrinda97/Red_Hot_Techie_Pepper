2010-04-29T05:48:00.000Z	justin___		Hey guys, I had to use a live CD to get my Ubuntu working again. How do I copy the video settings to my old partition so I don't have to just reinstall everything?
2010-04-29T05:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	You most likely want /etc/X11/xorg.conf but be sure to back up your existing config.
2010-04-29T05:49:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	I copied the ENTIRE X11 folder from etc unto the partition, and it still stalled on booting the X server.
2010-04-29T05:50:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	What does /var/log/Xorg.0.log have to say about it?
2010-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	I don't understand. That is a huge file.
2010-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	Well typically you would want to cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log|grep ^EE
2010-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	That would give you all the errors.
2010-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	cat it on the partitio that fails to boot? Or the live CD I am currently on?
2010-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	The partition that is not booting.
2010-04-29T05:54:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	Then what do I do?
2010-04-29T05:54:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	Did you recieve any lines of output from that command?
2010-04-29T05:57:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	There are tons of errors.
2010-04-29T05:58:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	Is there a timestamp with the error messages?
2010-04-29T05:58:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	no
2010-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	I recently switched monitors as well. How do I make Ubuntu reconfigure for my new monitor from the command line?
2010-04-29T06:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	I believe the command is: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg
2010-04-29T06:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	But would you please paste the last flew error lines to paste.ubuntu.com?
2010-04-29T06:07:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	Here it is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/424327/
2010-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	Is that after  you ran the reconfigure?
2010-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	no. Running the reconfigure did nothing for me before.
2010-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	justin___	BlueEagle	that is the output from the partition that won't load X.
2010-04-29T06:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	justin___	You may want to rename the existing xorg.conf and create an empty one in its place and see if the defaults lets you start X.
