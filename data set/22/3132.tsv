2010-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	purvesh	ActionParsnip	i had tried this sudo mount -o loop ~/Desktop/ubuntu-10.04-alternate-i386.iso /media/cdrom0 but m getting error "mount: mount point /media/cdrom0 does not exist"
2010-11-01T09:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	purvesh	then run:  sudo mkdir /media/cdrom0    the folder must exist for you to mount to it, it is not mounts job to make the mount point

2010-11-01T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	purvesh	no, you need to use the alternate ISO to upgrade from Lucid to maverick
