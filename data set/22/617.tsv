2011-08-06T16:40:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Should be that on maverick as well.
2011-08-06T16:41:00.000Z	daleharvey	astraljava	"python-software-properties" ? I dont quite get what you mean
2011-08-06T16:44:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Sorry, `sudo apt-get install python-software-properties`, thought you knew when you asked the location of apt-add-repository in the first place. :) Sorry, my bad.
2011-08-06T16:44:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Ahh..! Sorry again. Wait up a sec.

2011-08-06T16:47:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Oh really? Wow. Again, a sec.
2011-08-06T16:48:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	That was in dapper. :-/ Not sure you can get it real easy from anywhere.
2011-08-06T16:48:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	I'll see if I can locate it.
2011-08-06T16:50:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Where are you located at? US, Europe, Asia?
2011-08-06T16:52:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Try this? http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/s/sun-java5/sun-java5-jre_1.5.0-22-0ubuntu0.8.04_all.deb
2011-08-06T16:52:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	That's out of support, you do know that, right?
2011-08-06T16:53:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Crap, you needed the jdk, hang on.
2011-08-06T16:53:00.000Z	daleharvey	astraljava	well I wouldnt mind someone telling android :P
2011-08-06T16:53:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/s/sun-java5/sun-java5-jdk_1.5.0-22-0ubuntu0.8.04_i386.deb
2011-08-06T16:54:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Yeah, I don't know about Java 5, but those packages won't get updated anymore.
2011-08-06T16:57:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	I wouldn't suggest adding an older repo, apt's db might get really confused. :)
2011-08-06T17:06:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Check this out: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sun-java5/+question/108411  Specifically comment #9
2011-08-06T17:11:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Good to hear, no prob.
2011-08-06T17:11:00.000Z	astraljava	daleharvey	Oh, and one more thing, if you can't get the source package from jaunty's repos, try hardy's, those packages I linked to are there.
