2009-08-07T17:35:00.000Z	calwig		so... on Jaunty how precisely does someone "fix" the tor problem
2009-08-07T17:36:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	what tor prob?
2009-08-07T17:37:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	well I followed the instructions to install Tor and its broken on firefox, it doesnt forward, and apt-get install tor does not work, only privoxy. And on FF it doesnt forward anything even after modifying the config file on /etc/privoxy
2009-08-07T17:38:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	/etc/init.d/tor restart|stop|start doesnt work anymore
2009-08-07T17:39:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	maybe not the solution you are looking for, but when i wanted to try out Tor i used an Opera Browser with Tor "baked in". Called "OperaTor"  cehck it out
2009-08-07T17:39:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	personally i just use a proxy server, or VPN now.. but it was alright imo. good idea
2009-08-07T17:39:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	as a test? so if it works in Opera then it could work in FF
2009-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	if it works, the you know that is just a setup problem on your end.  If not, then look to your routers ports/firewall
2009-08-07T17:41:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	um i just noticed something, Network Proxy isnt installed by default on Jaunty. Do you know why? or how to install it
2009-08-07T17:47:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	wait sorry it is installed
2009-08-07T19:57:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	fixed tor, I didnt install the packages as stated in the instructions
2009-08-07T19:59:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	just a config error then ?
2009-08-07T20:00:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	no, not only a config error. I didnt install tor from the place the instructions said, so I had no tor whatsoever installed, just privoxy, everything was being forwarded, but Tor just wasnt there
2009-08-07T20:01:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	lol.. yeah usualy helps when you install the program you are trying to use :p  hehe. Well im glad you got it all sorted. Did you check out OperaTor?
2009-08-07T20:02:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	i guess i'll check it out
2009-08-07T20:02:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	its "opera" right?
2009-08-07T20:03:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	the base browser is opera yes.
2009-08-07T20:03:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	the full name is OperaTor tho.. its a modded version of opera
2009-08-07T20:04:00.000Z	calwig	b3rz3rk3r	aint in the repositories, should i check elsewhere
2009-08-07T20:04:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	you should be able to download an .exe and use wine to run it
2009-08-07T20:05:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	just google
2009-08-09T02:35:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	calwig	get supported by the US govt? :p
