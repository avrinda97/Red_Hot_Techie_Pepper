2010-07-04T02:36:00.000Z	DuffHimself		there we go, thanks
2010-07-04T02:36:00.000Z	DuffHimself		right, my question, i installed a program with the software center, but it didnt create launchers
2010-07-04T02:37:00.000Z	DuffHimself		how do i create the launcher myself?
2010-07-04T02:37:00.000Z	DuffHimself		i have no idea where the program is located
2010-07-04T02:37:00.000Z	DuffHimself		err
2010-07-04T02:37:00.000Z	DuffHimself		like i said earlier, <-- total moron
2010-07-04T02:38:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	what application is it?
2010-07-04T02:41:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	i think that's a command-line app. in which case a GUI launcher will not be created for it.
2010-07-04T02:45:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	type "which mupen64plus" in a terminal
2010-07-04T02:46:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	now just type "mupen64plus"
2010-07-04T02:46:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	what happens?
2010-07-04T02:47:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	does the GUI window contain a way to load a ROM?
2010-07-04T02:48:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	OK, then a GUI launcher will work.
2010-07-04T02:49:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	close any windows that are currently open. let's get back to a clean screen.
2010-07-04T02:50:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	well, not the obvious windows
2010-07-04T02:50:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	go to System > Preferences > Main Menu
2010-07-04T02:51:00.000Z	DuffHimself	mneptok	Then create item?
2010-07-04T02:51:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	highlight "Games" and click the "New Item" button
2010-07-04T02:52:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	"Tyoe" is "Application." "Name" is mupen64plus. "Command" is /usr/games/mupen64plus
2010-07-04T02:52:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	when that's filled in, click "OK" and then look in the Games menu
2010-07-04T02:53:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	rawk
2010-07-04T02:53:00.000Z	mneptok	DuffHimself	please go to Launchpad and file a bug against mupen64plus saying it does not create a menu item
