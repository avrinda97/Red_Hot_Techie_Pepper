2007-06-14T05:39:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		is it possible to get working nvidia drivers for feisty?
2007-06-14T05:40:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		the nvidia script i downloaded said none are compatible with my kernel
2007-06-14T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	you are making it too hard
2007-06-14T05:42:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	when i do this, it says i need to download a package that i dont seem to have
2007-06-14T05:43:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	do "what" exactly
2007-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	sorry, when i run the restricted drivers manager
2007-06-14T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	what does this return:  apt-cache policy nvidia-glx
2007-06-14T05:46:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	Installed: 1.0.8776+2.6.17.7-11.2
2007-06-14T05:47:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	it says i need to install the package linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-386, which does not seem to be available
2007-06-14T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	well that means you have the nvidia drivers installed.  How about 'apt-cache policy linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)'?
2007-06-14T05:48:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	unable to locate
2007-06-14T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	pastebin your sources.list
2007-06-14T05:53:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	http://rafb.net/p/M1gXtl79.html
2007-06-14T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	what is the result of:  lsb_release -c
2007-06-14T05:54:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	codename feisty
2007-06-14T05:54:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	do you realize all of your repositories are for dapper?
2007-06-14T05:57:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	how did you upgrade by the way?
2007-06-14T05:58:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	after updating my sources.list i still cant find that package
2007-06-14T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	did you run 'sudo apt-get update'?
2007-06-14T05:59:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	no i didnt. sorry im such a newb :/
2007-06-14T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	Mr_Awesome	np, I'd recommend doing a 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' to make sure everything got upgraded.  Read very carefully what it wants to do... ie don't let it remove hundreds of packages...
2007-06-14T06:00:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	jrib	ok, ill try that. thanks
