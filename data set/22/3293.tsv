2008-11-11T15:40:00.000Z	a1len		Hello. Can anyone help me in figuring out how I 'cd' an application into a directory and then run that application?
2008-11-11T15:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	please clarify how you mean by 'cd' an application
2008-11-11T15:42:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	Run that application from a determined directory.
2008-11-11T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	to run a binary in the current pwd, use ./<file to run>
2008-11-11T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	this will make the shell use the local directory as the working directory
2008-11-11T15:43:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	I'm sorry, I don't think I understand...
2008-11-11T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	what is the name of the program to run?
2008-11-11T15:44:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	Python.
2008-11-11T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	then in terminal type: ./Python
2008-11-11T15:45:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	Thanks!
2008-11-11T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	./ means use the one in the local directory
2008-11-11T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	so if you had opera installed and had a binary in your pwd called opera. you would need to use ./opera to run the local one rather than the one in /usr/bin et al
2008-11-20T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	sudo chown -R <user> /path/to/folder <-will change owner for folder and all subfiles and subfolders
2008-11-20T16:41:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	Thanks.
2008-11-20T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	watch where you execute from
2008-11-20T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	it will change the owner of ALL subthings from where you specify
2008-11-20T16:43:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	I'm just trying to set up a subsystem for email, so I just want ownership of the mail folder the default spoolfile that fetchmail uses... but after I did that command... it tells me the owner's still root.
2008-11-20T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	what command are you running?
2008-11-20T16:44:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	^
2008-11-20T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	you could try: chmod 755 /var/mail as well
2008-11-20T16:45:00.000Z	a1len	ActionParsnip1	Sweet... that worked. Thanks a lot mate!
2008-11-20T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	a1len	cool
