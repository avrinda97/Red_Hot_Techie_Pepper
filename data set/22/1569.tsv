2010-06-06T22:47:00.000Z	edbian	wikiik	It's part of "notification area" applet.  Add that to your panel.
2010-06-06T22:48:00.000Z	wikiik	edbian	and how can i add it?
2010-06-06T22:48:00.000Z	edbian	wikiik	Right click on your panel.  Add to panel.
2010-06-06T22:50:00.000Z	wikiik	edbian	sorry but i don't find the icon, it appears many others but not the wifi one
2010-06-06T22:50:00.000Z	edbian	wikiik	the wifi icon is part of the notification area.  You added the notification area and the network icon didn't show up?
2010-06-06T22:53:00.000Z	edbian	wikiik	Fixed it then?
2010-06-06T22:54:00.000Z	wikiik	edbian	yes, i didn't read you appropiatelly

2010-06-06T22:54:00.000Z	wikiik	edbian	 one more question, i try to suspend my laptop
2010-06-06T22:55:00.000Z	edbian	wikiik	Yeah, it doesn't work right?
2010-06-06T22:58:00.000Z	edbian	wikiik	Yeah, that's hard to program for linux developers because there is so much left up to the hardware vendors.  There is little advice I can give to fix
2010-06-06T23:00:00.000Z	wikiik	edbian	do you remember the web from where appears all the capabilities supported by a laptop using ubuntu?
2010-06-06T23:00:00.000Z	edbian	wikiik	No?  I don't even really know what you're asking.
2010-06-06T23:01:00.000Z	wikiik	edbian	some time ago i found a web where appears how supported are the hardware of a given laptop
