2010-11-07T16:16:00.000Z	MatthiasM		every tool I try (7zip, winrar, total commander) shows that the file names in the ubuntu-10.10-server-amd64.iso are damaged
2010-11-07T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 you can mount an iso via the mount command also...
2010-11-07T16:17:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	I want to install ununtu on a new PC, currenmtly I only have a virtual ubuntu which can't access my usb drive
2010-11-07T16:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 virtualbox from the vbox homepage can access usb devices
2010-11-07T16:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 or other tools can make a bootable usb flash drive.
2010-11-07T16:20:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	it should - but it failed with some driver issue
2010-11-07T16:20:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	the issue is that I tried several tools which can extract ISO files and all show that the file names are cut off after 83 characters
2010-11-07T16:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 why do you need to extract them? theres tools that can donload/verify the iso's
2010-11-07T16:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 check the PenDrivelinux web site for such tools.
2010-11-07T16:23:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	that's what I did - and the resulting USb installer is corrupt because the file names are cut off (too long!)
2010-11-07T16:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 what tool did you use?   try a differnt one.. thers several of them. and check the md5sums
2010-11-07T16:24:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	I tried 7zip, total commander and winrar - either all these tools have the same bug (unlikely) or the ISO is damaged / out of spec
2010-11-07T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 Noo,, try OTHER tools taht make the iso onto a flash drive.. ..  one that can download/verifuy the iso would be best.
2010-11-07T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 its possible the iso is damaged.
2010-11-07T16:24:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	can you give me a link?
2010-11-07T16:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 the pendrivelinux web site has several.
2010-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 you did verify the isop files md5sum?
2010-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	where can I find the md5 checksums - I downloaded the ISO 2 times from http://www.ubuntu.com/server/get-ubuntu/download and both had the same check sum
2010-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MatthiasM	 so you use unetbootin, boot the flash drive. and what ha0p0pends exactly?
2010-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	cdrom-retriever: error: Unable to find 'pool/main/l/linux/fs-secondary-modules-2.6.35-22-generic-di_2.6.35-22.33_amd64.udeb'
2010-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	the file on the usb drive is: g:\pool\main\l\linux\fs-secondary-modules-2.6.35-22-generic-di_2.6.35-22.33_amd64.ude
2010-11-07T18:06:00.000Z	MatthiasM	Dr_Willis	I got the installer working after I manually fixed all file names
