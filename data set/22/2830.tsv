2009-12-02T22:53:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	I'm staring at that guide wondering what could be wrong with my configuration but it looks like i did everything right :S...  I have the worst luck with samba.
2009-12-02T22:53:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	can you ssh into the server?
2009-12-02T22:54:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	yep I've got an ssh open atm
2009-12-02T22:54:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	can you confirm samba is running?
2009-12-02T22:55:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	running top...
2009-12-02T22:55:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	sudo service samba status
2009-12-02T22:56:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	smbd and nmbd are running.
2009-12-02T22:56:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	have they been restarted since discovering the fault?
2009-12-02T22:57:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	i've run "sudo /etc/init.d/samba reload" a couple times to try and jog it.
2009-12-02T22:58:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	I've also restarted the whole server several times.
2009-12-02T22:59:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	okies ... is the server pingable?
2009-12-02T23:00:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	actually - ignore that, you are ssh'd into it ;)
2009-12-02T23:00:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	;)
2009-12-02T23:00:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	check firewall settings then ...
2009-12-02T23:01:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	I just run a pfsense box with snort at my entrypoint to the internet so as this is a lan issue I dont believe thats causing an issue :S.
2009-12-02T23:05:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	so you can see how im kinda frustrated ... :S
2009-12-02T23:06:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	aye, but with networking you have to break things down bit by bit ;)
2009-12-02T23:06:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	check the system isn't blocking the port, check the router is port forwarding as it should, etc.
2009-12-02T23:07:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Arkturus	try to connect via ip address, etc, etc, etc
2009-12-02T23:08:00.000Z	Arkturus	ibuclaw	Ill try ip connect as theres had nothing special changed on this router that should affect it.
