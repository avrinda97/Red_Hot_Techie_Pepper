2008-01-02T03:24:00.000Z	kyleBAKED		has anyone had any success getting urban terror installed?
2008-01-02T03:24:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	yes, a local install
2008-01-02T03:25:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	I didn't compile urban terror though, just got the binary
2008-01-02T03:25:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	PurpZeY, i keep getting an error that glxinfo cannot be found, but it is on my system, i can check by doing which glxinfo
2008-01-02T03:25:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	PurpZeY, i'm using the install script from the forums
2008-01-02T03:25:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	hmm, strange
2008-01-02T03:25:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	do glxinfo | grep direct
2008-01-02T03:26:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	direct rendering: yes
2008-01-02T03:27:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	odd, can you pastebin the error?
2008-01-02T03:27:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	i am looking at the install script and its glxinfo_bin=`which glxinfo`, but even if i replace that with the direct path, i get the same error
2008-01-02T03:27:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	yeah hold on
2008-01-02T03:27:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	oh I've never used the install script
2008-01-02T03:28:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	I just copied over into /usr/local/games/ and symlinked to /usr/local/bin
2008-01-02T03:28:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	ill just try doing it that way
2008-01-02T03:29:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	just try to run not install
2008-01-02T03:30:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	its a .sh file
2008-01-02T03:30:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	doesn't run?
2008-01-02T03:30:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	i think its just a script that will install the update with it or something, i'm just going to get it directly from the website though
2008-01-02T03:30:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	try to -RUN- first, not install
2008-01-02T03:31:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	its a bash script
2008-01-02T03:32:00.000Z	norv	kyleBAKED	yeah, meant try running the binary from the binary packages
2008-01-02T03:32:00.000Z	kyleBAKED	norv	im downloading them now
