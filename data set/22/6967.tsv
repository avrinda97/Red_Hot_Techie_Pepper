2006-06-17T07:39:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	install ld, and it should be in your path
2006-06-17T07:40:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	yep
2006-06-17T07:40:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	and for future reference, it's in your path, not your way ;-)
2006-06-17T07:45:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	nope.
2006-06-17T07:45:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	i don't think so./

2006-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	Mike-X2	krazykit	i know but dont know wich
2006-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	there is no "which".  there's a package called binutils.  just plain binutils.  install it.
2006-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	Mike-X2	krazykit	theres some binutils
2006-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	Mike-X2	krazykit	rgr

2006-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	i have no idea what you're trying to do, honestly
2006-06-17T08:08:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	ooooh.  well if you drop to a virtual terminal (crtl-alt-f1) and log in there, do "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2006-06-17T08:08:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	that ought to get rid of X for you
2006-06-17T08:08:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	sudo killall Xorg
2006-06-17T08:10:00.000Z	krazykit	Mike-X2	yes.
