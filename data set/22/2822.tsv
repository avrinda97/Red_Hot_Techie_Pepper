2009-04-22T23:28:00.000Z	thewrath		how easy is it to set up dns as your first dns server and then your ips as your second and so on
2009-04-22T23:29:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	easy, change your /etc/resolv.conf
2009-04-22T23:29:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	you know of a good tutorial to do this
2009-04-22T23:30:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	man resolv.conf
2009-04-22T23:32:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	what are you trying to accomplish?
2009-04-22T23:32:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	i want to set up a dns server that will be the primary one that i use
2009-04-22T23:33:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	if you want to install a dns server you'll want to install bind, there's plenty of tutorials on the web to do that
2009-04-22T23:34:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	so i can install bind and edit that file you told me about and then i can use it how i want to?
2009-04-22T23:34:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	the use would be as a preliminary dns server that all computers on my network would utilize first and if it was down then it would use my isp or another one that i would wnat
2009-04-22T23:35:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	do you want to configure a dns server or do you just want your computer to use a different dns server?
2009-04-22T23:37:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	both i want to configure my won dns sever that iw ill keep records at that all computers on my network would use. if there was a problem with my dns server then it would use my isp's dns server or another dns server
2009-04-22T23:38:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	you'll probably want to read http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001582/ for configuring bind, and for having computers use a specifc dns server, this can be accomplished through a dhcp lease or by editing the resolv.conf on every box connected to your network
2009-04-22T23:39:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	what do you use for dhcp server?
2009-04-22T23:39:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	none yet. i was just cirous how i would go about it
2009-04-22T23:40:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	what would you recomment
2009-04-22T23:41:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	i'd recommend using a separate distro for your dns/dhcp server, i use pfsense  www.pfsense.org/
2009-04-22T23:41:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	why would you recommend that
2009-04-22T23:42:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	that does not come with a dns server
2009-04-22T23:42:00.000Z	frostburn	thewrath	because it's easy to configure, and a nice pretty ui for every option.  your alternative is to learn bind.   it does have a dns server, you can get the addon for it
2009-04-22T23:43:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	did not see that abotu the addon. i know bind i just have brush up my skills. my one networking class we did setuff with bind
2009-04-22T23:44:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	bind is not hard either if i remember correctly>
2009-04-22T23:48:00.000Z	thewrath	frostburn	is that addon a gui interface or no?
