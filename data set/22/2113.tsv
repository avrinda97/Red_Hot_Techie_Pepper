2009-09-25T03:05:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	does the sound work at all?
2009-09-25T03:06:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	no, it works very well on other programs.
2009-09-25T03:06:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	then it might be a problem of the media player you are using. which program do you use to play the video?
2009-09-25T03:07:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	I don't know which one it is, It's what ever one came with Super-OS for playing flash video.
2009-09-25T03:09:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	ok I do not know much about super-OS it might be that the flash plugin uses the wrong sound driver. To change that, try to find the properties option of said player.
2009-09-25T03:09:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	how do I find out which flash plugin it is?
2009-09-25T03:10:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	I asume you use a browser to open a web page where you want to play a flash video ?
2009-09-25T03:10:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	yes
2009-09-25T03:11:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	depending on the browser you use there should be an addons option in the top bar
2009-09-25T03:12:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	you mean like under tools in FireFx?
2009-09-25T03:13:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	It says I have shockwave flash.
2009-09-25T03:14:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	you might try reinstalling it - for this you have to remove the plugin
2009-09-25T03:15:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	ok, i'll try that right now
2009-09-25T03:15:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	what browser do you use?
2009-09-25T03:16:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	Firefox. How do you remove a plugin? There is no uninstall option for it in Frefox
2009-09-25T03:20:00.000Z	Arabus	assinine	hmm ok I do encounter that problem for the first time. never noticed how difficult it can be to get rid of the plugin
2009-09-25T03:20:00.000Z	assinine	Arabus	how did you get rid of it?
