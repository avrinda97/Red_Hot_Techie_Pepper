2011-12-12T13:27:00.000Z	Ansikt		Why?
2011-12-12T13:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	check out the link ubottu just sent you
2012-06-21T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	look in the ntp.conf
2012-06-21T00:31:00.000Z	Ansikt	ikonia	 Where is ntp.conf?  I checked / with find, saw nothing.
2012-06-21T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	1.) are you using ntpd ? 2.) look in /etc 3.) read https://help.ubuntu.com to understand the basics of using linux, if you're using archlinux I expect to not have to spoon feed
2012-06-21T00:33:00.000Z	Ansikt	ikonia	 right.  Checked /etc/ntp.conf first.  Came here, you told me to check ntp.conf.  Ran "find / -mount | grep -i ntp.conf"  Got nothing.
2012-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	why are you asking where ntp.conf is if you know (you've already checked it) /etc/ntp.conf
2012-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	also what the devil is that find command ?
2012-06-21T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	that won't do anything
2012-06-21T00:35:00.000Z	Ansikt	ikonia	 "# cat /etc/ntp.conf:  cat: /etc/ntp.conf: No such file or directory"
2012-06-21T00:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	from the documentation I'm reading (I pointed you at it a few minutes ago) it shows that ubuntu is using cron with ntpdate so check the daily crontab
2012-06-21T00:38:00.000Z	Ansikt	ikonia	 Thanks.  Also, what's wrong with my find command?
2012-06-21T00:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	it seems terrible syntax
2012-06-21T00:39:00.000Z	Ansikt	ikonia	 Something always rubbed me wrong about the --name flag :P
2012-06-21T00:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	.....right, whatever
2012-06-21T01:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	I'd stay clear of howtoforge if possible
2012-06-21T01:12:00.000Z	Ansikt	ikonia	 File corruption.  Bad md5sums and the like.
2012-06-21T01:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	that is nothing to do with "ftp" although there is a lack of checksumming post transit
2012-06-21T01:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	that will be your network having a problem
2012-06-21T01:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	fix that rather than masking the problem
2012-06-21T01:17:00.000Z	Ansikt	ikonia	 All I know is that copying stuff from ftp mirrors ends up with more invalid files than when I use http **shrug** but diffferent strokes, I suppose.
2012-06-21T01:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Ansikt	I'd be very concerned about your network then
