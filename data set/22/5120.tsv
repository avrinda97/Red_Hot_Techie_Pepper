2007-10-11T05:09:00.000Z	Photocopy		okay
2007-10-11T05:10:00.000Z	Photocopy		Is anyone here familiar with slax? I have two questions.
2007-10-11T05:11:00.000Z	Photocopy		IIf anyone knows aboout slax? its two fairly simple questions.  quick too.
2007-10-11T05:11:00.000Z	Photocopy		=p
2007-10-11T05:12:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	i thought this was an ubuntu channel last time i checked
2007-10-11T05:13:00.000Z	Photocopy	LjL	Last time I checked, the idea behind linux wasn't "My distros better than urs and i wont help you lololol"    Slax doesnt have its own irc ty, so dont harass me. Even if this is an ubuntu place, its an support channel, and surely support is most important.
2007-10-11T05:13:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	no, surely staying ontopic is more important.
2007-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	Photocopy	LjL	The topic is generally, individual help, on a per person basis, not "ubuntu"
2007-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	... because YOU say so?
2007-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	Photocopy	LjL	I say from experiences here past.
2007-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	the channel topic says "Official Ubuntu Support Channel". so, come on, just drop it.
2007-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	bad experiences then.
2007-10-11T05:16:00.000Z	Photocopy	LjL	Or why don't you disregard messages not haviing to do with ubuntu if its what you so want to speak about. And they weree all good experiences, cause i got help every time. If you dont want to help me cause its not an ubuntu question then shutup and go help someone else, cause I don't see why someone wouldn't help me anyway. Besides, if I go to a store and ask if theyy have shovels and they don't, "Where can I get them" usual
2007-10-11T05:17:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	look, it's that simple: i'm an operator here, and i'm asking you to stick to Ubuntu support questions. and, i'm sorry, i don't know what if any channel you can find Slax support on.
2007-10-11T05:18:00.000Z	Photocopy	LjL	I see no reason AT ALL why I shouldnot be helped, and Jordan_u, if you didn't highlight me then its your fault I didnt get the answer.
2007-10-11T05:19:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	join #ubuntu-ops if you want to discuss the issue further. meanwhile, you're muted for 10 minutes.
2008-01-19T02:43:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	how is that question related to the topic of this channel?
2008-01-19T02:43:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	let me answer that for you, it's not
2008-01-19T02:43:00.000Z	Photocopy	LjL	I have talked to you about this before
2008-01-19T02:44:00.000Z	Photocopy	LjL	I'm here to be helped, not hassled. I'll find help elsewhere, though the other channels are always dead empty.
2008-01-19T02:46:00.000Z	LjL	Photocopy	resizing partitions is always a dangerous operators, so yes that might wreck your boot. simply reformatting the currently-Linux partition should normally not do any harm, except that you will probably have to reinstall the Windows bootloader if you're using the Linux bootloader (GRUB) now. that can be accomplished with the Windows CD
