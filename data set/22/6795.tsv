2010-05-20T01:08:00.000Z	Guest86627		Does ubuntu have something similar to system restore for windows where it restores everything to a previous date
2010-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	no, but maybe the next version of Ubuntu, or   if not probably the one after that,  it seems that it will have something even better by default.  However yeah got to wait six months to a year or something like that first.
2010-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	normally you woudnt need to do a system restore though, like Windows
2010-05-20T01:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	Whats gone wrong anyway?
2010-05-20T01:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	ok this doesnt sound good, why did you do that?
2010-05-20T01:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	hmv?
2010-05-20T01:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	yeah xorg is important, you don't want to mess with  that, unless you really have to, why were you?
2010-05-20T01:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	which version were you on?
2010-05-20T01:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	yes if you got ubuntu-desktop installed, and then upgrade to Lucid, it might re install  the other stuff whilst doing so
2010-05-20T01:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	I said might
2010-05-20T01:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	also maybe if you install kubuntu-desktop for example, it will install other stuff and KDE
2010-05-20T01:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	then you could purekde, and then do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop or something I guess
2010-05-20T01:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	uh puregnome I mean,  I am just guessing here though
2010-05-20T01:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	plus probably some other way you can re install xorg and so on anyway
2010-05-20T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	yes
2010-05-20T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	and their  nonupstream Gnome edits
2010-05-20T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	or just clean install, probably better, since your sysetm got messed up a lot
2010-05-20T01:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	10.04 uses Gnome 2.30 and that's not Gnome 3
2010-05-20T01:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	Gnome 3 has been delayed untill  September from April.  also 10.10 won't be using Gnome Shell by default, so it won't have the new look by default, but you could install that yourself,  just like you can install a development version now into 10.04
2010-05-20T01:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	under the hood 10.10 will be Gnome 3 though as far as I know
2010-05-20T01:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	10.04 uses Gnome 2.30
2010-05-20T01:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest86627	oh and Gnome Shell in the repo is old, so you would want a ppa really
