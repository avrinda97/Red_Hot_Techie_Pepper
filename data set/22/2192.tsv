2010-11-27T08:59:00.000Z	DonJuan		I got a hard question if anyone can help out.
2010-11-27T09:00:00.000Z	DonJuan		Does anyone know of a way that I can install ubuntu by booting in GParted? I've got a computer that refuses to boot from my thumb drive although booting from USB is an option and no access to CD's.
2010-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	There are a few solutions.
2010-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	Firstly, you might consider a "Network Installation"
2010-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	Or, you could write the installer to your thumbdrive and try booting from it. Be sure that you enable booting from USB in your BIOS.
2010-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	DonJuan	FrozenFire	I looked into that, but most of the processes were for booting either from a dedicated server or from another Linux machine.
2010-11-27T09:04:00.000Z	DonJuan	FrozenFire	I've got a laptop with Windows 7 installed on it, but not really wanting to mess with it too much as it's not mine. I wrote the .iso to the thumb drive (one that I used to install openSUSE on my desktop) but it's just not working. I enabled "Boot from USB" in BIOS, but the option doesn't show up in the drive boot order.
2010-11-27T09:05:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	During initialization (prior to the bootloader) the system generally provides a "boot menu"
2010-11-27T09:05:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	Typically, that's F12 or something similar.
2010-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	DonJuan	FrozenFire	I'm familiar with that, but for some reason this mobo doesn't give the boot menu option. All I've got is BIOS and an option to install from network.
2010-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	It's possible that the thumbdrive doesn't support booting.
2010-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	There's always Wubi.
2010-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	DonJuan	FrozenFire	Same one I used to install openSUSE on my desktop back home. I'm trying to get ubuntu going on my mom's desktop.
2010-11-27T09:08:00.000Z	DonJuan	FrozenFire	Doesn't that install ubuntu within the Windows OS? Not really the option I was wanting to go for.
2010-11-27T09:08:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	It's not at all risky. It's something I do often for those who wish to try Ubuntu without making a permanent change to their system.

2010-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	DonJuan	FrozenFire	I've got the link pulled up already, thanks though. I'm looking to get ubuntu permanently installed on here though.
2010-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	If portability is absolutely necessary, you might go pick yourself up an external hard disk enclosure.
2010-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	Are you installing to the same drive as Windows is on?
2010-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	Or do you have a separate disk in the system?
2010-11-27T09:11:00.000Z	DonJuan	FrozenFire	I going to install ubuntu over the current Windows installation. This desktop has two HDD's, and I planned to use one for system and the other for the home partition.
2010-11-27T09:12:00.000Z	FrozenFire	DonJuan	What you could do is install the Ubuntu installer to a partition on the end of the home-partition disk, install the system, then remove the installer partition and resize your home partition to the size of the disk.
