2010-04-30T02:34:00.000Z	Travis-42		if Ubuntu is installed on a new computer onto an SSD, will ubuntu align the new partitions it creates to maximize ssd performance?
2010-04-30T02:36:00.000Z	Travis-42		is there a more detailed release notes for ubuntu 10.04? the technical overview just says things like "includes the latest GNOME desktop environment with a number of great new features" Which new features?
2010-04-30T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	the above link I guess
2010-04-30T02:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	ah yes I fogot, but there's also the Ubuntu Music Store
2010-04-30T02:37:00.000Z	Travis-42	sebsebseb	no, it doesn't provide any more detail about what's new :-/
2010-04-30T02:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	new kernel, new version of Gnome, two new themes,  later Firefox,  loads of packages updated in the repo, and that's it really
2010-04-30T02:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	KDE 4.4 for those doing Kubuntu
2010-04-30T02:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	there's also a  Ubuntu 10.04 manual, but that's not in the  ISO /  on CD
2010-04-30T02:39:00.000Z	Travis-42	sebsebseb	sorry, not trying to be difficult, but I was trying to get more details. e.g. what's new about the new gnome compared to the gnome before?
2010-04-30T02:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	the Gnome site can explain that
2010-04-30T02:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	however when it comes to specifailly Ubuntu
2010-04-30T02:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	you know that stuff on the top right?
2010-04-30T02:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	 the sound menu, and me menu, and what not,  none of that is part of upstream Gnome, it's Ubuntu specific
2010-04-30T02:40:00.000Z	Travis-42	sebsebseb	hmm, ok, yea I saw that that had changed.
2010-04-30T02:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	they also remove a more well kind of technical feature as a result of those changes as well, well when they are disabled
2010-04-30T02:41:00.000Z	Travis-42	sebsebseb	alright, I guess I get the idea. thank you
2010-04-30T02:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	you know the automatic shut down Gnome feature?  well that's not there, when you got edited fast user account switcher applet, which is linked to the new me menu, enabled.   instead it will ask people if they really want to shut down ore re start, instead of automatically shutting down after a minute,  after they have done shut down
2010-04-30T02:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	I guess newbie friendly features sometimes come at a price, for more expereinced users.
2011-05-11T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	you'll get the bar at the top, on both montiors
2011-05-11T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	as far as I know
2011-05-11T02:47:00.000Z	Travis-42	sebsebseb	ok thank you
2011-05-11T02:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Travis-42	no probs
