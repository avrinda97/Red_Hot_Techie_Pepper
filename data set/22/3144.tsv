2009-01-02T14:13:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	it depends on the laptop make/model
2009-01-02T14:13:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	toshiba a200-1m4
2009-01-02T14:14:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	there should be scripts inside your acpi directory for that laptop
2009-01-02T14:14:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	/etc/acpi?
2009-01-02T14:15:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	yes
2009-01-02T14:16:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	how do I use these?
2009-01-02T14:16:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	there is a script called hotkeys which maps to your fn keys. this script gets called
2009-01-02T14:18:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	there is no script there called hotkeys
2009-01-02T14:21:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	there is no script there called hotkeys
2009-01-02T14:22:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	in my laptop i have a script for each event. like eeepc-hotkeys.sh
2009-01-02T14:22:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	make sure that acpi is running
2009-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	sudo /etc/init.d/acpid restart
2009-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	it's running
2009-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	but how do i get hold of this hotkeys script?
2009-01-02T14:24:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	whenever you press any hotkey, you should get acpi messages in /var/log/acpid
2009-01-02T14:25:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	no idea about your laptop; i could help you with the eeepc though :)
2009-01-02T14:28:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	I have a hotkey-setup in /etc/init.d/. is this what I am looking for?
2009-01-02T14:29:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	i guess so
2009-01-02T14:29:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	do you wanna see the contents?
2009-01-02T14:30:00.000Z	outbackwifi	suigeneris	i can send you my acpi scripts and you could tweak them for your laptop
2009-01-02T14:31:00.000Z	suigeneris	outbackwifi	that would be great
