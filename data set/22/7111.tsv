2008-02-02T05:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	try alt + F7
2008-02-02T05:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	ah.. ok.. how 'bout /etc/init.d/kdm start
2008-02-02T05:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	ok.. and that's after checking again the F7 option?
2008-02-02T05:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	some of what you were discussing previously I missed.. is this a fresh install?
2008-02-02T05:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	ok.. hang on a sec.. I'll get another option for you.. Nvidia? or Ati?
2008-02-02T05:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	are you irc'ing with this machine or a different one?
2008-02-02T05:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	ok.. after running that command and answering the questions you'll need to restart X by CTRL+ALT+Backspace. It will knock you off this channel and make you log back in..
2008-02-02T05:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	I forgot about that.. console won't disconnect.
2008-02-02T06:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	I think it's an issue with the 8800.. I'm googling now to find the answer.
2008-02-02T06:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	that make it almost for sure..  hang on on phone
2008-02-02T06:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	if you're running the 64 bit version of ubuntu .. yes you might be better off with i386
2008-02-02T06:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	I'm going to be on the phone for a minute talking to a client. back shortly.
2008-02-02T06:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	sounds like you're downloading the i386 version and things will remain status quo until you install that.. am I correct?
2008-02-02T06:11:00.000Z	Sakkath	Scunizi	'status quo'?
2008-02-02T06:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	nothing left to try to configure until after the next install?
2008-02-02T06:12:00.000Z	Sakkath	Scunizi	yeah.
2008-02-02T06:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	frustrating on 64 bit.. another few years and that won't be an issue.. i hope.
2008-02-02T06:12:00.000Z	Sakkath	Scunizi	better hope before 2038, lol
2008-02-02T06:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	that sounds like my drop dead date.. I'll be 88 by then
2008-02-02T06:13:00.000Z	Sakkath	Scunizi	xD. jeesh. i'm 17 :P
2008-02-02T06:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	the iso will fit fine on a cd
2008-02-02T09:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sakkath	have you done any updates since reinstalling?
