2007-12-21T20:09:00.000Z	pete2		can someone help with m1005 MFP printer/scanner/copier. i cant get scanner to work. printer works flawlesly but xsane refuses to detect scanner,i have found some info that might be helpfull but i am neewb for creating that driver. any help is appriciated, tnx
2007-12-21T20:09:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	is that HP?
2007-12-21T20:12:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	yes, HP M1005 MFP
2007-12-21T20:14:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	I would like to see if that can made to work as I would like to buy one as well
2007-12-21T20:14:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	yes i am there on sane-backends , http://www.nabble.com/sane-driver-for-hp-laserjet-m1005-mfp-to12469670.html , but i am too new to linux to be able to compile
2007-12-21T20:15:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	can u help me try to set it up ?
2007-12-21T20:16:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	let me check
2007-12-21T20:17:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	that is only for printer, which works really good atm
2007-12-21T20:18:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	i dont think that has to do anything with xsane for scanner
2007-12-21T20:18:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	ah, my mistake--in my zeal I misread
2007-12-21T20:19:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	this is the solution i think : http://www.nabble.com/sane-driver-for-hp-laserjet-m1005-mfp-to12469670.html
2007-12-21T20:19:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	but i dont know how to compile all of that
2007-12-21T20:28:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	well, from searching it seems that no one has full capabilitiies on that model; not Vista, Not Leopard and not yet Ubuntu--HP has quite good support for Linux generally, so likely will release something in the next few weeks
2007-12-21T20:31:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	you get that?
2007-12-21T20:32:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	yes, i got that
2007-12-21T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	it looks like a solution, but not an easy one--probably someone will cobble something together (ending in .deb hopefully) shortly
2007-12-21T20:36:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	yes, that is .deb option :/
2007-12-21T20:37:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	not quite--it's compiling stuff in quite a complicated procedure--if you keep an eye on ubuntuforums and discussion sites, someone will come up with an easier fix
2007-12-21T20:39:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	ok, tnx m8
2007-12-21T20:39:00.000Z	bazhang	pete2	the only drivers that apparently work are for Tiger and XP :{
2007-12-21T20:39:00.000Z	pete2	bazhang	ok, i try forum. tnx m8
