2011-10-09T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmanjr5	sounds like the sudoers file is the one causing issues

2011-10-09T01:17:00.000Z	qmanjr5	ActionParsnip	It's natty
2011-10-09T01:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmanjr5	I suggest you boot to live cd, mount the internal partition and look at the perms in the liveCD and apply them to the files on the partition
2011-10-09T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmanjr5	it'll take ages
2011-10-09T01:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmanjr5	isnt that what I ust suggested?
2011-10-09T01:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmanjr5	or use your backups :)
2011-10-09T01:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qmanjr5	you'll be doing:  ls -l something      then apply the access to the same something on the installed partition
