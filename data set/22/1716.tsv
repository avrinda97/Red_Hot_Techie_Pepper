2010-02-06T09:21:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	whatcha doin with iwconfig??
2010-02-06T09:23:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	trying to set up a wireless connection "profile"
2010-02-06T09:24:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	thats a fact
2010-02-06T09:24:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	so if I configured it properly then the nm-applet will just autoconnect the next time I log in right?
2010-02-06T09:28:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	hmm ok
2010-02-06T09:29:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	what kind of security are you trying to connect to
2010-02-06T09:29:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	it's a wep :( (it's my parents' house)
2010-02-06T09:30:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	so you cannot connect to this network or what?
2010-02-06T09:31:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	the problem is they just changed it (it was wpa2) to wep and the nm-applet is not recognizing the change and kept trying the old settings even though I keep telling it to
2010-02-06T09:31:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	did you restart your comp
2010-02-06T09:32:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	yeah and booted into windows and went here lol
2010-02-06T09:32:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	I've had this same problem
2010-02-06T09:32:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	so when you go back to linux, cant you go to nm-app and make a new profile
2010-02-06T09:32:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	I think i'll try again now, and i'm gonna remove that thing and install wicd
2010-02-06T09:32:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	dontedit the one you have
2010-02-06T09:32:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	wicd suuucks
2010-02-06T09:33:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	lol why?
2010-02-06T09:33:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	delete the profile for your the wan, then create a new one, then restart
2010-02-06T09:33:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	i'm pretty pissed with the applet right now
2010-02-06T09:34:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	yeah it works tho, I've had this same problem, wicd is even crappier in my opinion
2010-02-06T09:34:00.000Z	lanzelloth	unixalot	I don't understand why they could spend development time on "the awesome" gnomeshell when their network manager is like this
2010-02-06T09:35:00.000Z	unixalot	lanzelloth	yeah, it has to do with the default keyring
