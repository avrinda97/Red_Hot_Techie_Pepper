2007-01-22T08:16:00.000Z	vincenz		Anyone know why I'm havng issues installing (well reinstalling now as something f*cked it up) my tex/tetex packages
2007-01-22T08:16:00.000Z	vincenz		it has a problem with udpmap or something to that extent
2007-01-22T08:16:00.000Z	Pici	vincenz	: what error are you getting?
2007-01-22T08:16:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	mktexfmt: Error! Not all formats have been built successfully
2007-01-22T08:17:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	on all tex-operations
2007-01-22T08:18:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	I think it might have something to do with the file /etc/texmk/dvipi.cfg (iirc), as it appears that the lhs2stex package changed this somewhat
2007-01-22T08:20:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	how do I get the error-log from synaptic, cause as soon as it finishes you can't select the text anymore
2007-01-22T08:20:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	it seems to be an issue when it calls fmtutil-sys during the configuration of tetex
2007-01-22T08:22:00.000Z	Pici	vincenz	: Try looking in /var/log/dpkg.log
2007-01-22T08:23:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	aha
2007-01-22T08:23:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	http://rafb.net/p/XTOgUp36.html
2007-01-22T08:27:00.000Z	Pici	vincenz	: this is a bit over my head, but try doing find / | grep mp.pool
2007-01-22T08:28:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	ouch
2007-01-22T08:28:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	ok, thanks :)
2007-01-22T08:50:00.000Z	Pici	vincenz	: its a long shot, but try: apt-get -f install
2007-01-22T08:50:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	no still a problem with that fmtutil thingy
2007-01-22T08:51:00.000Z	Pici	vincenz	: sorry :/
2007-01-22T09:04:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	how do I check to which package a file belongs
2007-01-22T09:14:00.000Z	Pici	vincenz	: sorry about the late reply, some network issues here, dpkg -S will tell you what file is in a package (providing that you have it installed)
2007-12-22T00:23:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	apologies
2007-12-22T02:58:00.000Z	Pici	vincenz	Indeed it is offtopic, try ##hardware
2007-12-22T02:58:00.000Z	vincenz	Pici	thx
