2007-05-08T14:37:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/your-pre-made-mount point/ or whichever partition you need.
2007-05-08T14:38:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	cool it seems that the command worked. but nothing comes up.nothing really happens.
2007-05-08T14:39:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- check 'ls -la /media/'    see if it mounted.
2007-05-08T14:39:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- or type 'mount'
2007-05-08T14:41:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	when I try to go to /media/windows where i mounted it it tell me i don't have permission to access the folder
2007-05-08T14:41:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	when I run the command you gave me part of the output is: /dev/sda1 on /media/windows type ntfs (rw)
2007-05-08T14:41:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- yeah, its mounted with superuser access, you need sudo
2007-05-08T14:42:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	I don't understand
2007-05-08T14:43:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- sudo ls -la /media/windows
2007-05-08T14:45:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	I see the dirctories listed but how do I access it through the GUI (file manager)
2007-05-08T14:45:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- configure nautilus to do so. you'll need the wiki or others docs to accomplish that but it's not difficult.
2007-05-08T14:46:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	thanx a stack
2007-05-08T14:46:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- use fuse to mount ntfs drives for r/w access.
2007-05-08T14:48:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	sudo nautilus /media/windows (or whatever directory) does the trick
2007-05-08T14:48:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- thx for the tip :)
2007-05-08T14:49:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	thanx for you help
2007-05-08T14:49:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- happy to help, g'luck.
2007-05-08T15:07:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	I need to mount a usb drive now that is ntfs (i want to mount it with ntfs-3g) but it mounts automatically
2007-05-08T15:07:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	what do I do
2007-05-08T15:08:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- isn't that a 'good' thing?
2007-05-08T15:09:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	LtL	yes but I can't write to the drive. it is ntfs. That is why I want too use ntfs-3g
2007-05-08T15:10:00.000Z	LtL	Cyrus25801	- if it's named in /etc/fstab  change ro to rw.  proceed with caution.
