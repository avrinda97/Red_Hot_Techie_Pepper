2005-06-20T12:21:00.000Z	infralite		hello, is it possible to upgrade from 4.10 to the current stable version?
2005-06-20T12:21:00.000Z	infralite		ah, online update?
2005-06-20T12:21:00.000Z	infralite		no need to download cd?
2005-06-20T12:22:00.000Z	infralite		hmm
2005-06-20T12:22:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	only 1 cd: to install it :)
2005-06-20T13:33:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	yes
2005-06-20T13:34:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	yes?
2005-06-20T13:36:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	apt-cdrom -d can do good things too
2005-06-20T13:36:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	just type apt-cdrom for a summafy of the options
2005-06-20T13:36:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	that was what i was checking over right now :)
2005-06-20T13:39:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	says it cant open and "Permission denied" to my cd, should be because it's corrupt, right? cd's should have read access
2005-06-20T13:40:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	apt-cdrom should be run as root iirc
2005-06-20T13:54:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	hmm, it adds the cd in synaptic now but i see no new packages
2005-06-20T13:55:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	sudo apt-cdrom -ad /media/cdrom1 add was what i did
2005-06-20T14:00:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	it complains that no valid records were found
2005-06-22T08:57:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	not without more info (like the exact error...)
2005-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	that's the problem actually, it flys past and i can't see it
2005-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	and what happens after that?
2005-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	it just stops booting
2005-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	Seveas	infralite	so then you can write down the error I guess
2005-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	i wish i could read an error log or something
2005-06-22T08:59:00.000Z	infralite	Seveas	it dumps the memory so the error leaves the screen, it's way behind
