2009-08-07T22:30:00.000Z	chillitom		guys, how can i enable hyperthreading on my xeon
2009-08-07T22:30:00.000Z	chillitom		?
2009-08-07T22:30:00.000Z	chillitom		cpuinfo reports it is available
2009-08-07T22:30:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	use top and press 1 to see the cpu-cores working
2009-08-07T22:31:00.000Z	chillitom	iceroot	thanks but they definitely aren't working
2009-08-07T22:32:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	its a dual core with HT?
2009-08-07T22:32:00.000Z	chillitom	iceroot	yip
2009-08-07T22:33:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	i dont think there are cpus with 2 core AND HT
2009-08-07T22:33:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	2 core OR HT
2009-08-07T22:33:00.000Z	chillitom	iceroot	i see the ht flag in /proc/cpuinfo
2009-08-07T22:34:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	and you see 2 cores?
2009-08-07T22:34:00.000Z	chillitom	iceroot	yip
2009-08-07T22:35:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	can you paste the output from cpuinfo? i am just interessted in it
2009-08-07T22:38:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	They use Socket T (LGA775), operate on a 1066 MHz front-side bus, support Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology but do not support Hyper-Threading   from wikipedia
2009-08-07T22:38:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	its a dual core which cant use HT, so you only have 2 cores
2009-08-07T22:38:00.000Z	chillitom	iceroot	weird, wonder why it reports ht
2009-08-07T22:39:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	maybe wikipedia is wrong. dont know
2009-08-07T22:39:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	just wondered about dual core AND HT
2009-08-07T22:40:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	interesting, thx
2009-08-07T22:41:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	 a have found it Simultaneous multithreading by multiple cores and hyperthreading (2x per core).
2009-08-07T22:41:00.000Z	iceroot	chillitom	have you checked if the bios is up to date? so it can handle the cpu?
2009-08-07T22:41:00.000Z	chillitom	iceroot	good idea, i'll have a check
