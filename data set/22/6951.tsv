2006-08-28T08:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		Do you know how to use dpkg to create a list of installed packages that I can move to another machine and have that machine install those same packages
2006-08-28T08:40:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	dpkg -l (lists all installed packages, but there are better ways to do what you want)
2006-08-28T08:41:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	eeh, i never done that, just heard... trying wiki...
2006-08-28T08:41:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, something like that :)
2006-08-28T08:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oskude	yea, I get the list but how do I get the other system to read that list and install the packages
2006-08-28T08:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oskude	dpkg --get-selections < myprog.txt only sets the list.. it does not install them
2006-08-28T08:42:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	you need apt-get or aptitude for that, iirc
2006-08-28T08:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oskude	How do I get apt to read the list, I dont want to do it manually, 100's of lines
2006-08-28T08:44:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	did you search google or wiki ? im pretty sure this is done many times...
2006-08-28T08:44:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	ill try to find...
2006-08-28T08:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oskude	I may just be phrasing the querry wrong
2006-08-28T08:45:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/282
2006-08-28T08:46:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	seems to be "dpkg --set-selections" and then "apt-get dselect-upgrade"
2006-08-28T08:46:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	you could make a bookmark to that site, has helped me alot
2006-08-28T08:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oskude	I marked that site, that info was close... thanks

2009-01-12T00:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oskude	Please lose the wtx shorthand.. It is not necessary
2009-01-12T00:37:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	so you mean we should not be human here ? ...
2009-01-12T00:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	oskude	Not up for discussion. Stop ...
2009-01-12T00:39:00.000Z	oskude	Jack_Sparrow	so any emotional expression is not allowed ? WTF! since when ?
