2006-08-03T08:42:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	what's your problem?
2006-08-03T08:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	I'm trying my best to save pcs from the tyranny of microsoft lol
2006-08-03T08:43:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	i cannot get any ipv4 ip address at all, tried "everything" that i can search up, like disable the ipv6, but still dhclient doesnt get any dhcp "answer" or something, so i can update or anything
2006-08-03T08:44:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	try putting in DNS servers, a gateway and an IP address?
2006-08-03T08:44:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	dont got static ip, only dhcp from isp
2006-08-03T08:44:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	no only the ip from your dhcp router
2006-08-03T08:44:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	what dhcp router?
2006-08-03T08:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	see, the linksys router i use requires me to assign DNS servers, a gateway address, and the ip address the router assigned to me
2006-08-03T08:46:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	i dont got any router at all, im directly connected to my isp
2006-08-03T08:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	like the router's gateway is 192.168.0.1 for example. my ip is 217.164.171.194
2006-08-03T08:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	ouch.
2006-08-03T08:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	call up your isp and ask for help on configuring internet with linux?
2006-08-03T08:47:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	and i got 4 or 5 dynamic ip's from my isp and my household only got 2 computers connected, so i got atleast 2 "spare" unused ones.
2006-08-03T08:50:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	hmm, on my isp page it states like this about configre a router to work ("in case" settings) i dunno what this are tho: # VPI = 8, VCI = 35, Encapsulation = LLC
2006-08-03T08:52:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	anyways, gonna go do that test to set the dns servers manualy as they wrote, gotta reboot ^^
2006-08-03T10:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!! NOOOOO!!! no seriously
2006-08-03T10:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	what exactly is the problem again?
2006-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	FuriousRage	DJAdmiral	what ever i tried, i cant get an ip, now lastly i tried to acpi=off (f6) on the ubuntu live cd, only made my disk drive disabled tho
2006-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	so it's your cruddy isp's fault, not ubuntu!!
2006-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	lol
2006-08-03T11:06:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	FuriousRage	I feel sorry for you, I really do.
