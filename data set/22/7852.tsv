2006-05-15T13:26:00.000Z	eobanb_	ubuntu	might i suggest an application called gaim
2006-05-15T13:27:00.000Z	eobanb_	ubuntu	it's an instant messenging program that comes installed with ubuntu.
2006-05-15T13:27:00.000Z	eobanb_	ubuntu	if i was you, i wouldnt bother with the official version of yahoo messenger for linux, and i'd just use Gaim instead.
2006-05-15T13:28:00.000Z	eobanb_	ubuntu	with respect, i highly doubt that.
2006-05-15T13:35:00.000Z	eobanb_	ubuntu	can you re-phrase your question
