2007-02-28T14:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	I'd have thought that Linux would have been fairly popular in India
2007-02-28T14:24:00.000Z	shriphani	gordonjcp	why would you think so ?
2007-02-28T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	I mean that's a bit of a generalisation, but essentially you've got pretty fertile ground for developers and users
2007-02-28T14:27:00.000Z	shriphani	gordonjcp	all MCSE
2007-02-28T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	really?  that's a shame
2007-02-28T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	Minesweeper Consultant and Solitaire Expert
2007-02-28T14:32:00.000Z	shriphani	gordonjcp	u were at ibm ?
2007-02-28T14:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	yeah, until about a year ago
2007-02-28T14:34:00.000Z	shriphani	gordonjcp	how is the b'lore lab ?
2007-02-28T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	I don't know, I never went over there
2007-02-28T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	the guys that work there seem OK though
2007-02-28T14:35:00.000Z	shriphani	gordonjcp	the quality of work i mean
2007-02-28T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	ah, yeah not bad
2007-02-28T14:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	depends on what they're doing - we had a large contact centre there doing first line support for a few retail customers (ie shops that use IBM EPOS kit)
2007-02-28T14:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	the actual tech support was pretty good, but their call entry was rubbish
2007-02-28T14:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	like, they were supposed to talk the customer through something like (say) a receipt printer with faint print
2007-02-28T14:37:00.000Z	shriphani	gordonjcp	ok
2007-02-28T14:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	so they'd get the customer to check all the things they were supposed to, and then if that didn't work they'd tell them they'd pass it on to have an engineer out in an hour with a new printer
2007-02-28T14:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	which is basically *not* going to happen, and wasn't what they were told to do...
2007-02-28T14:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	problem with that then is that 2nd level phone the customer up and get an earful because they've been waiting 45 minutes and still no new printer - and then they're not happy when you explain that they're not getting a new printer and in any case it's going to be within *eight* hours that an engineer comes
2007-02-28T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	not the fault of the guys in Bangalore mind you - it's all down to training (or the lack of)
2007-02-28T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	shriphani	also IBM's internal IT helldesk is in Bangalore, so what does that tell you?
