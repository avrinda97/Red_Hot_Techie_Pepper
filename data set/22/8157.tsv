2005-10-31T07:44:00.000Z	Jeffrae		Masayuki Hatta (mhatta) <mhatta@debian.org> Is listed as the maintainer when I look in Synaptic
2005-10-31T07:45:00.000Z	Jeffrae		it is a debian address I know ubuntu is a a spinoff of debian, but are the debian people really the maintainers?
2005-10-31T07:46:00.000Z	crimsun	Jeffrae	the last person to touch it was Ian Jackson <ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk>  Tue, 30 Aug 2005 18:55:44 +0100

2005-10-31T07:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Jeffrae	that's why 8 still isn't in.

2006-03-27T08:47:00.000Z	crimsun	Jeffrae	it should be fairly straight-forward if the source supports module-assistant

2006-03-27T10:22:00.000Z	crimsun	Jeffrae	you don't have build-essential installed?
