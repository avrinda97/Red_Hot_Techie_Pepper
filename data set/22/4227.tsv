2008-05-13T19:41:00.000Z	phoenix5002		how do I change the screen brightness?  I am using Ubuntu 8.04.
2008-05-13T19:42:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	do your laptop brightness keys work?
2008-05-13T19:43:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	no.  it used to use the "Fn" key when I had windows but now that key combination doesn't do anything.
2008-05-13T19:44:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	did you check if the laptop is supported? google for the name in the ubuntu wiki
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	should I also include the model number in my search?  or is "sony vaio laptop" good enough?
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	no you need to include especially the model number
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	they make a lot of laptops ;)
2008-05-13T19:46:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	ok I did both, and my model isn't in there.  but there is one model number that is close.  mine is "PCG-K45" and there is an entry for "PCG-K23"
2008-05-13T19:48:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	im not really up to speed on how backlights work, but if you have an ati card you can also set the brightness through atitool or aticonfig something
2008-05-13T19:49:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	I do have ati, but I don't use their proprietary driver because I have problems with it, so I don't think aticonfig works
2008-05-13T19:49:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	there's also another tool that works with the opensource drivers
2008-05-13T19:50:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	named something similarly
2008-05-13T19:50:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	would it be installed already or do I have to manually get it?
2008-05-13T19:50:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	dont think it comes installed by default, but it's in the repo i think
2008-05-13T19:52:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	well how does brightness changing normally work... I don't see a shortcut for it in the "keyboard shortcuts" for my system.
2008-05-13T19:53:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	it's a system function iirc, which is why it's not bound to normal keys. I dont think you can bind to FN-keys either
2008-05-13T19:55:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	well is there any way to change screen brightness without using the keyboard?  it seems like there should be a way, because if my laptop switches to battery power the screen dims the brightness, so it is capable, I think.
2008-05-13T19:56:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	well at least that is working, the dimming is performed by the gnome-power-manager, you can fiddle with that by right clicking on the battery icon in the taskbar
2008-05-13T19:57:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	under gutsy that's how I used to change the brightness, but it seems in hardy that they removed the brightness slider..  :(
2008-05-13T19:58:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	well you can disable the dimming
2008-05-13T19:58:00.000Z	phoenix5002	rexy_	true, I guess that will have to do.  Thank you for your help
2008-05-13T19:58:00.000Z	rexy_	phoenix5002	but other then adjusting it through the console tool i have no idea to how to get the fn keys working
