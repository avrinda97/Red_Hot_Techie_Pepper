2010-04-23T02:28:00.000Z	coffee_		In Ubuntu 9.10 I dont see any user accounts except root. How do I modify user accounts?
2010-04-23T02:28:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	Where are you looking for user accounts?
2010-04-23T02:29:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Looking in system/ admin / users and groups
2010-04-23T02:29:00.000Z	moreia		Coffee_:And if you "click to make changes"?
2010-04-23T02:29:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	on the keys, that is.
2010-04-23T02:30:00.000Z	coffee_		moria: Clicked on make changes and just root shows up
2010-04-23T02:30:00.000Z	coffee_		weird
2010-04-23T02:30:00.000Z	moreia		Coffee_: the "Add User" button is greyed out?
2010-04-23T02:30:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Nope, I can do all functions except user accounts dont show up
2010-04-23T02:31:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	So no buttons are greyed out but you aren't seeing any users other than root listed?
2010-04-23T02:31:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Thats correct.
2010-04-23T02:31:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	who are you logged in as?
2010-04-23T02:32:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	if you click on  "Add User" and create a new users, does that user appear?
2010-04-23T02:32:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Im logged in as my user account. Then I click on keys and provide root password and no users show up.
2010-04-23T02:32:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Ill try that.
2010-04-23T02:33:00.000Z	coffee_		moria: Newly created user shows up.
2010-04-23T02:33:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Newly created user does show up
2010-04-23T02:34:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	Huh. So you can create new users, but can't see old ones at all? I'm not sure what might be going on.
2010-04-23T02:34:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	what if you open terminal and give the "users" command?
2010-04-23T02:34:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Found problem. Somehow my user name does not belong to group and id number is wrong.
2010-04-23T02:35:00.000Z	coffee_	moreia	Thanks for helping me think this one thru!
2010-04-23T02:35:00.000Z	moreia	coffee_	np.
