2010-06-05T15:43:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	I think you got the wrong person.
2010-06-05T15:43:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	what problems you are facing?
2010-06-05T15:43:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 My problem is that my ubuntu 10.04 amd 64 on my laptop freezes randomly.
2010-06-05T15:44:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 The laptop is ok, checked the temperatures, they are normal...is there a way to find out why it freezes randomly?
2010-06-05T15:44:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	is your mouse and keyboard and other peripheral devices stucks/freezes when you logged in to your 10.04 machine?
2010-06-05T15:45:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 Well let me tell you. I login, everything fine, I browser folders, everything fine, but suddently mouse stucks, sound stucks, everything stucks.
2010-06-05T15:46:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 It freezes randomly, one time I was in firefox listening to some music on youtube, and suddently freezed...
2010-06-05T15:46:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	Yeah right.. My friend also got same problems a few days ago, check the solution on his post, we fixed that: http://blog.ichinmay.com/2010/05/03/ubuntu-10-04-upgrade-from-9-10-usb-keyboard-mouse-problem/
2010-06-05T15:46:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 another time I was organising some folders...:|
2010-06-05T15:47:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 Well I do not have problems with my mouse and keyboard, that's what that link is from.
2010-06-05T15:49:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	your devices' entries are not written in the *evdev.conf file in  /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d directory...
2010-06-05T15:51:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	your machine stucks might been because of your mouse/keyboard problems...
2010-06-05T15:51:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	no issues... Have a good time!
2010-06-05T15:51:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 well I'm runing ubuntu on a dell inspiron with a touchpad and obviously internal keyboard
2010-06-05T15:51:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 ubuntu didn't stuck when i was on 9.10 that's strange.
2010-06-05T15:53:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	Yeah I'm also telling you same thing, on that blog the description about problem is not enough sufficient, but our problem exactly matching w/ your one's..
2010-06-05T15:53:00.000Z	letrozko	vishaltelangre	 ohh ok, I hope we get it fixed.
2010-06-05T15:54:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	If you check that, and not found your these devices were not there, means you have to make manually write their entries there so as they work proper w/ your lappie!
2010-06-05T15:55:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	letrozko	our problem was, he upgraded to lucid from karmic... but after logging in every time, his computer gets stucked after some times..
