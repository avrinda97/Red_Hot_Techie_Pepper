2012-01-07T01:27:00.000Z	Jsn0327		I have been trying for hours to resolve this issue, and i have not been able to... when i installed and configured PPTP server it started the server and i could connect no problem.  After i restarted the ubuntu 11.10 machine, I have not been able to connect to the server.  After trying to start the server and looking at the syslog this is the error that it is logging "pptpd[20217]: MGR: PPP
2012-01-07T01:27:00.000Z	Jsn0327		options file /etc/ppp/options.pptpd#015 not readable"
2012-01-07T01:28:00.000Z	Jsn0327		I thought that there was something wrong with the file or permissions, so i created a new file and copied just the settings (no comments) from the original config to the new file and saved it with the original config name and still got the error
2012-01-07T01:28:00.000Z	Jsn0327		i changed the permissions on the file to 777 and still get the error!
2012-01-07T01:29:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	fully path the client and server, then go back thru and do the setup again
2012-01-07T01:29:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	when you go back through just make sure everything is set correctly based on the guide you used
2012-01-07T01:30:00.000Z	Jsn0327	hydruid	what do you mean fully path the client and server?
2012-01-07T01:31:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	if the client and server are both ubuntu, make sure they are fully patched (meaning install all updates)
2012-01-07T01:31:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	sorry my typing lol patch instead of path
2012-01-07T01:33:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	did you patch both systems fully?
2012-01-07T01:34:00.000Z	Jsn0327	hydruid	 If you mean apply all available updates, yes.
2012-01-07T01:35:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	try to connect with a different client just to verify it's not the iphone's fault
2012-01-07T01:37:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	do the files have this symbol in them ^M
2012-01-07T01:40:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	you don't have to convert unless it has these in it ^M
2012-01-07T01:41:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	then thats not the problem
2012-01-07T01:42:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	what command are you using to start pptpd
2012-01-07T01:43:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	try sudo /etc/init.d/pptpd start
2012-01-07T01:43:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	well do stop then start
2012-01-07T01:44:00.000Z	hydruid	Jsn0327	is there a log in /var/log ?
