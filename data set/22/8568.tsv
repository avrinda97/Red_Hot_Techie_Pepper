2005-10-15T12:16:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		morning guys. i know we've had this conversation about anti-virus and firewalls not being really necessary in linux, but i was wondering, how do other operating systems other than windows and linux fare when it comes to these things?
2005-10-15T12:17:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	id say its simply a matter of market-share... macos didnt have many viruses at all, save the classic WDEF viruses of old
2005-10-15T12:19:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	so is that to say, there would be more viruses written for macos if more people had it?
2005-10-15T12:20:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	thats my opinion
2005-10-15T12:21:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	ok cool, makes linux sound all the more appealing :)
2005-10-15T12:22:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	also, if an exploit is found, there are a bunch of people all over the world ready to fix it, instead of a single company who has to decide if its worth it to fix it
2005-10-15T12:24:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	right, but who are these people? are they proper employees who are paid to do this kind of work, or just keen hobbyists?
2005-10-15T12:25:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	both
2005-10-15T12:25:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	ok, and the thing i just don't get is, if people are professionally employed in the development and maitenance of linux as a whole, where does the money come from, if linux is free?
2005-10-15T12:26:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	from companies that want to utilize software already out there and jsut want to expand on it... support linux servers, etc
2005-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	you dont need to wipe it clean, and breezy is damn stable right now in my experience
2005-10-15T12:31:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	im not sure how random config files and such get cleaned upm, but yuou could always remove everything but the bare essentials and then install ubuntu-desktop to get everything again, heh
2005-10-15T12:32:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	ok, but since as i say i have most of my stuff on another partition, i think a reformat is the way forward :)
2005-10-15T12:33:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	yeah.. ive done it both ways myself
2005-10-15T12:33:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	just thinking of firefox favourites, thunderbird emails etc
2005-10-15T12:33:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	thats all in your home dir
2005-10-15T12:33:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	~/.mozilla
2005-10-15T12:34:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	yeah
2005-10-15T12:35:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	there are different repos since its a different release
2005-10-15T12:36:00.000Z	pepsi	sexcopter8000m	so ... i dont see a point in backing up sources.list
2005-10-15T12:36:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	and for backports?
2005-10-15T12:36:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	pepsi	heh, ok
