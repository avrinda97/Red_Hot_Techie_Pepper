2008-04-05T18:07:00.000Z	Aranel		Hi, how can I protect Linux from Windows ? I'm multibooting, and I think If Windows goes crazy, it can format my Linux partition.
2008-04-05T18:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	unlikely in the utmost extreme
2008-04-05T18:09:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	sorry but i cant understand you, my bad english.. can you simple it for me ? :)
2008-04-05T18:09:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	will not happen.
2008-04-05T18:10:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	oh, how can u sure :) I think windows is a killer.
2008-04-27T20:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	 smp support
2008-04-27T20:18:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	SMP ?
2008-04-27T20:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	dual core etc
2008-04-27T20:19:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	Can I stop SMP in my 2.6.24 ?
2008-04-27T20:19:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	I think it causes random segfaults.
2008-04-27T20:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	that sounds unlikely
2008-04-27T20:20:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	If I send you my bug report, can you explain it for me ?
2008-04-27T20:20:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	The segfault problem is started with hardy.
2008-04-27T20:21:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	Is Ubuntu have any kernels like : 2.6.24-xx-386 ?
2008-04-27T20:21:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	aye
2008-04-27T20:21:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	can you give me packets name ?
2008-04-27T20:22:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	and heres my bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/222782 :)
2008-04-27T20:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	if you look in synaptic under kernel or 386 it is there
2008-04-27T20:23:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	I'm using 32bit 8.04 in my core2duo. can you suggest me 386 or generic ?
2008-04-27T20:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	core2duo works fine here with generic; the 386 will only see one core
2008-04-27T20:25:00.000Z	Aranel	bazhang	:S But whats the reason of the random segfaults, I cant understand it.
2011-02-01T11:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Aranel	full reinstall needed
