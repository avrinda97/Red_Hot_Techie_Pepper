2010-03-25T01:41:00.000Z	claptrap		So, what's the safest way to extend my primary partition?

2010-03-25T01:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	you can build a small one, back up into it, then make the old partition a new volume and add it to the backup
2010-03-25T01:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	but that takes time and might cause a headache
2010-03-25T01:44:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	Well, I needa do SOMETHING. I've only got ~40 total GB on the main partition, and it's not very happy with me for that.
2010-03-25T01:45:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	what other disks do you have?
2010-03-25T01:45:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	The 40 GB partition is on a 250 GB HDD; the other one is 500 GB.
2010-03-25T01:46:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	and you want to move say /home to the 500?
2010-03-25T01:46:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	Well, really just wanting to make the 250 GB whole again.
2010-03-25T01:48:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	here is the link to the lvm. but for that i'd maybe try the gparted method. trying to do a lvm with / on existing install may cause problems

2010-03-25T01:48:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	Any way to do that without a CD/DVD drive? :<
2010-03-25T01:48:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	And thanks
2010-03-25T01:49:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	IMO you should leave your / as 40 gb and set up new partitions for /home and /varva
2010-03-25T01:49:00.000Z	Out_Cold		** /var
2010-03-25T01:50:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	Is that relatively easy to do? :p
2010-03-25T01:50:00.000Z	Out_Cold		realitively yes
2010-03-25T01:51:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	is the remaining of the 250 and the 500 empty?
2010-03-25T01:51:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	No.
2010-03-25T01:51:00.000Z	claptrap	Out_Cold	The 250 can be cleared out easily enough, though.
2010-03-25T01:52:00.000Z	Out_Cold	claptrap	can you sudo fdisk -l and explain/pastebin the results?
