2011-01-18T03:13:00.000Z	lcb		i'm pretty sure anyone who installs latest  release will also get the ureadahead error (i say this because i did some clean installations on several machines and i allays get that error). Question: (1) is there any way of apt-get remove ureadahead without removing implicitly  ubuntu-minimal? (2) is there already any effective workaround to avoid that error?
2011-01-18T03:14:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	you are talking about ureadahead exited with status 4?
2011-01-18T03:15:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	not an error then
2011-01-18T03:16:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	yes but then you don't have ureadahead.
2011-01-18T03:17:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	(no fast booting)
2011-01-18T03:18:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	its annoying tough :/
2011-01-18T03:19:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	yes. i don't know why they implemented it this way.
2011-01-18T03:19:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	maybe they will change it in the future
2011-01-18T03:19:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	you might know.. let me check the only other error i get, not sure if related or not... hold on pls
2011-01-18T03:22:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	init: mounted-tmp main process (830) terminated with status 127 | mountall: Event failed (just after the first  ureadahead error)
2011-01-18T03:23:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	after that 6 events of ureadahead issue
2011-01-18T03:28:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	is it booting?
2011-01-18T03:29:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	or does it stop after the error message?
2011-01-18T03:30:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	yes (i knkow what you gonna say: so foget-it... :) ::) but that's not the case, you know.. any future error we thing they might be related. so better fix it earlier than purge all system
2011-01-18T03:30:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	what was i gonna say?
2011-01-18T03:31:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	i found this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plymouth/+bug/538292
2011-01-18T03:31:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	i suppose: if boots then forget the warnings / messages
2011-01-18T03:32:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	 and this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1309423
2011-01-18T03:33:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	thanks a lot. i did a purge on unreadahead as i said before but then i got some other errors and i don't want to do it again. i'm going to read those you gave me now. thanks a lot
2011-01-18T03:33:00.000Z	sam-_-	lcb	y. probably not a good idea to purge readahead
2011-01-18T03:34:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	exactly...
2011-01-18T03:54:00.000Z	lcb	sam-_-	 reading all those posts with no solutions, with worst consequences, i'm really sorry but i'm going to do a deb install for the server. at least until this matter is resolved.
