2008-03-19T08:37:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	onboard?
2008-03-19T08:40:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	I don't know if your chipset can do 5.1
2008-03-19T08:41:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	not going to happen then
2008-03-19T08:41:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	your onboard does not support it
2008-03-19T08:42:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	you could get an offboard one
2008-03-19T08:42:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	and try that out
2008-03-19T08:43:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	does it play through the soundcard?
2008-03-19T08:44:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	in the Motherboard Bios
2008-03-19T08:45:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	do you have a prebuilt system?
2008-03-19T08:46:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	HP/dell
2008-03-19T08:46:00.000Z	ythe1300	belkinhelp2	well I would look through the BIOS and see if I could not disable it there first.
