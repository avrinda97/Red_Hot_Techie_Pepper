2006-08-10T12:45:00.000Z	terry_		i have tried installing network manager, and it seems to install without error but there is no interface for me to try and configure my wireless network.  Can anyone help?
2006-08-10T12:46:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	start nm-applet
2006-08-10T12:47:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	thanks for the response but how do I start it?
2006-08-10T12:47:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	press alt-f2 and type nm-applet
2006-08-10T12:48:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	it will be saved to your session and started automatically from there on
2006-08-10T12:50:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	I ran it but still nothing. nothing appeared
2006-08-10T12:50:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	the interface appears in the notification-area, near the clock
2006-08-10T12:51:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	it's just a simple icon when you click it, it will show you a list of network interfaces
2006-08-10T12:51:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	- nope, its not there.  The normal network connection icon is there, but not what I would have thought network manager is
2006-08-10T12:52:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	the icon looks like the normal network connection icon, do you have 2 of them?
2006-08-10T12:53:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	no, nothing. sorry but I think there is a problem elsewhere.  Is there a way to see if the process is running at all?
2006-08-10T12:54:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	hmm.. you could check if the process is actually running
2006-08-10T12:54:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	sorry but how do I do that. I am a complete newbee to linux.
2006-08-10T12:54:00.000Z	zanaga		terry, system -> administration -> system monitor
2006-08-10T12:55:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	i was just looking how it's done from the menus ;)
2006-08-10T12:58:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	ok, I got the processes listed and there is 3 copies of nm-applet which are all sleeping
2006-08-10T12:59:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	had a bit of a network problem.  sorry i might have missed any of your replies.  I will repost my last one
2006-08-10T12:59:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	ok, I got the processes listed and there is 3 copies of nm-applet which are all sleeping
2006-08-10T13:00:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	that's a bit odd.. do you have any NetworkManager processes?
2006-08-10T13:02:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	nah, no "networkmanager", just 3 "nm-applet"'s (3 because I ran it 3 times from the run dialog box
2006-08-10T13:02:00.000Z	zanaga	terry_	odd, you could try rebooting once.
2006-08-10T13:02:00.000Z	terry_	zanaga	Ok, I will try that and let you know.
