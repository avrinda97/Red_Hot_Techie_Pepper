2009-09-24T21:24:00.000Z	dehqan		halitech there has been written  Install flash9 activeX. Use a standalone installer. If you don't know where to get one then ask google. If you're still blurred then get one from oldapps.com/oldversion.com. Don't miss this step as this is REQUIRED for ym.

2009-09-24T21:27:00.000Z	genii	dehqan	Anything which is Windows-specific like ActiveX (which does not exist on Linux) and needs Wine to use, you should enquire about in the oficial wine support channel, which is as pointed out,  #winehq
2009-09-24T21:28:00.000Z	dehqan		a windows version should be installed or linux one ?flash 9

2009-09-24T21:29:00.000Z	dehqan		sorry halitech .
2009-09-24T21:29:00.000Z	dehqan		yes bucky
2009-09-24T21:30:00.000Z	genii	dehqan	Flash player for Linux doesn't have ActiveX. Because as already explained (quite often) Linux does not have ActiveX, it is a Microsoft Windows-only thing. So you need to enquire in the Wine support channel about something like installing Windows Flash (which may have ActiveX in it) into the Wine program
2009-09-24T21:31:00.000Z	dehqan		genii where can win flash activex be found ?
2009-09-24T21:32:00.000Z	genii	dehqan	/join #winehq                 and then ask in there
