2005-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	Cooner750		excellent
2005-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	Cooner750		I'm unmounting it now to resize the FAT32. How much room should I leave for EXT3?
2005-07-21T07:39:00.000Z	Cooner750		4-5GB?
2005-07-21T07:39:00.000Z	Cooner750		It does support USB.
2005-07-21T07:39:00.000Z	Cooner750		That's how I booted Slax for a long time. From a USB pendrive
2005-07-21T07:40:00.000Z	Cooner750		how many GB is 14,652MB?
2005-07-21T07:40:00.000Z	Cooner750		oops. nevermind
2005-07-21T07:40:00.000Z	Cooner750		wrong #
2005-07-21T07:41:00.000Z	Cooner750		is 5037MB enough?
2005-07-21T07:41:00.000Z	Cooner750		ok. closing my eyes and hitting "Resize"
2005-07-21T07:41:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	you also need a swap partition
2005-07-21T07:42:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	well I would think a swap partition is always good, especially if you have plenty of disk space
2005-07-21T07:43:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	I would suggest 1 gig. The format will be swap .. you can set in install
2005-07-21T07:44:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	you can do all that in the installer as well
2005-07-21T07:45:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	while resizing? yeah
2005-07-21T07:45:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	not too long, I would think
2005-07-21T07:46:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	how so?
2005-07-21T07:47:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	is there alot of room on that partition?
2005-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	I have had bad experiences with rpm as well but maybe it has improved since then
2005-07-21T07:50:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	no but its pretty simple
2005-07-21T08:28:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	no but its pretty easy
2005-07-21T11:02:00.000Z	Frank_dot	Cooner750	they're usually legally dubious
