2009-01-06T03:06:00.000Z	RediXe		Is there a way to get packages installed on a machine that can't see the outside world? I have my desktop that can access the machine and the outside world and would like to install some packages on the machine that can't see outside using apt-get
2009-01-06T03:07:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	you need to download the ubuntu .deb package files
2009-01-06T03:07:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	make sure you check the dependencies and satisfy those also
2009-01-06T03:08:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	what are you trying to install?
2009-01-06T03:08:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	sun-java-jre
2009-01-06T03:09:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	Trying to install Openfire IM server on an ubuntu server but it needs java installed   .. I could have sword it wanted a sun-java6-dev or something but didn't see that in the repo
2009-01-06T03:10:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	What does your other computer run?
2009-01-06T03:10:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	this machine is on xubuntu 8.04 and server is ubuntu server 8.04
2009-01-06T03:11:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	ok. are they on a network?
2009-01-06T03:11:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/sun-java6-jre take a look at that
2009-01-06T03:11:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	I am ssh'd into the server atm - not sure why but it can't access the outside world and I'm not too worried about. I'll just scp the deb file over and manually do it
2009-01-06T03:12:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/sun-java6-jre take a look at that
2009-01-06T03:13:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	at the top you can navigate the dependencies and at the bottom you can download the files
2009-01-06T03:13:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	thx :)
2009-01-06T03:13:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	No Problem; Thank the community
2009-01-06T03:16:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	I assume these packages will run on 64bit machines?
2009-01-06T03:16:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	you didn't say that one second
2009-01-06T03:16:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	Yeah I just realized I forgot to mention that part :P
2009-01-06T03:17:00.000Z	HacKBoX_	RediXe	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/hardy/amd64/sun-java6-jre
2009-01-06T03:17:00.000Z	RediXe	HacKBoX_	I also, moved over to the sun-java6-sdk and saw the AMD64 so downloading that now. As for depends not so sure
