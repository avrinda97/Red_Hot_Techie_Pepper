2009-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	karatekickz		tried linux help... they werent helpful
2009-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	karatekickz		I also googled a ton
2009-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	karatekickz		this seem distro specific
2009-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	karatekickz		I need to find where vnc gets loaded
2009-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	karatekickz		im running vnc headless...
2009-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	karatekickz		it defualts to 640 480 I need to send it a parameter on boot
2009-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	karatekickz		I need to find the file that lauches it
2009-06-23T10:35:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	I'm confused. How do you know you're running vnc headless if you didn't start it yourself by hand?
2009-06-23T10:38:00.000Z	karatekickz	losher	its started in my install im running mythbuntu but I think it starts with ubuntu as well
2009-06-23T10:39:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	ok, so what problem are you trying to solve?
2009-06-23T10:40:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	did you look in ~/.vnc like mutew said?
2009-06-23T10:45:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	you need 'ls -a' to see files starting with a dot
2009-06-23T10:52:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	which parameter do you want to add?
2009-06-23T10:53:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	as I understand it, mythbubtu runs the gnome desktop, and gnome has a VINO server built in, which serves vnc'
2009-06-23T10:55:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	so when you run 'ps ax' is there a vncserver running?
2009-06-23T10:55:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	but you didn't start the vncserver explicitly?
2009-06-23T10:56:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	back to what mutew said then. Grep for vnc in /etc/init.d/*
2009-06-23T10:57:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	mutew: sorry I'm behind you guys
2009-06-23T10:58:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	if it's forked from mythbackend, you'll never find it...
2009-06-23T10:59:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	'grep vnc /etc/init.d/*'
2009-06-23T11:00:00.000Z	losher	karatekickz	I'd prefer he do: sudo grep vnc /etc/init.d/*
