2010-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	AngryParsley		I recommend the intel x-25m
2010-05-01T08:27:00.000Z	AngryParsley		it's solid state so it makes no noise, and the read/write latency is practically nonexistent compared to a hard drive
2010-05-01T08:27:00.000Z	AngryParsley		*hard disk drive
2010-05-01T08:28:00.000Z	AngryParsley		considering a decent laptop costs around $1200, it's not a bad deal
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	AngryParsley		so I guess they have gone down in price
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	AngryParsley		I bought mine in march of 2009 for $350
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	AngryParsley		it was totally worth it
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	i doubt that many people will spend 1200 on a laptop tbh
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	AngryParsley	acicula	$1200 is the base model macbook pro
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	thats hardly a baseline for what everyone buys
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	campus !=the world  ;)
2010-05-01T08:30:00.000Z	AngryParsley	acicula	hmm? the majority of people in the crowd at OSCON last year had macs
2010-05-01T08:32:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	unless people who visit oscon are a nice crossection of society as a whole that fact is statistically insignificant
2010-05-01T08:32:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	that just says that well payed tech geeks like apple computers
2010-05-01T08:32:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	wich i would say is true
2010-05-01T08:32:00.000Z	AngryParsley	acicula	I don't care what the majority of all people use. I care about what smart/wealthy/technically-inclined people use
2010-05-01T08:34:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	well thats nice, but your personal preferences hardly factor into an argument of what an average consumer would buy, anyway stopping since ot
2010-05-01T08:35:00.000Z	AngryParsley	acicula	always got to get the last word in, eh?
2010-05-01T08:36:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	if there something you'd like to discuss further best to do that via pm.
2010-05-01T08:38:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	removing the ubuntu-desktop package is not an issue, its just a meta-package
2010-05-01T08:38:00.000Z	acicula	AngryParsley	though it may get used again for doing a release upgrade to pull in all th desktop dependencies, dunno about that
