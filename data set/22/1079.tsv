2010-10-28T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	none at all, look at your mount options
2010-10-28T00:48:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	my mount options seems fine...
2010-10-28T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	they can't be or you'd be able to write data.....
2010-10-28T00:49:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	i get input/output error
2010-10-28T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	then unmount the partition and fsck it
2010-10-28T00:49:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	fsck in terminal?
2010-10-28T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	yes, make sure its healthy
2010-10-28T00:51:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	fsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2?
2010-10-28T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	if you just run fsck with suitable options on the unmounted partition, it should make sure itsok
2010-10-28T00:53:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	it's totally unmounted and i still get the same fsck response...
2010-10-28T00:53:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	i really need this to work so i can fresh install ;[
2010-10-28T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	if you data is unhealthy, yes
2010-10-28T00:54:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	it should be fine i just had it up not two hours ago and was transferring files.
2010-10-28T00:55:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	i tried to create a text document there and it wouldn't let me do that or add files... i think i can still take files from there and put it on my machine fine.
2010-10-28T00:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	i suggest you fsck -a /dev/partitionname    to ensure its health, then check mount options
2010-10-28T00:58:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	No such file or directory while trying to open /dev/sbd1
2010-10-28T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eaerth	if you run:  sudo fdisk -l    you can list the available partitions
2010-10-28T00:59:00.000Z	eaerth	ActionParsnip	well wouldn't it not show up because you had me unmount it?
