2008-10-04T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	paul68	try wine first.  A lot of the stuff that works in the others will work in wine.

2008-11-02T15:21:00.000Z	paul68	Flannel	getting time out on the be.archive.ubuntu.com  and sugest fix missing any idea how to do this?
2008-11-02T15:22:00.000Z	Flannel	paul68	Switch to a different mirror
2008-11-02T15:22:00.000Z	paul68	Flannel	how do I do that?
2008-11-02T15:23:00.000Z	Flannel	paul68	the quickest way is to edit your sources.list and change the be.archve.ubuntu.com to something else (a mirror you think will be faster)
2008-11-04T14:15:00.000Z	Flannel	paul68	You said that.  Its a school, I imagine its static, proper internet, etc.
2008-11-04T14:22:00.000Z	paul68	Flannel	did you catch my last remark?
