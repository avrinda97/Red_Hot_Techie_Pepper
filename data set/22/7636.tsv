2006-06-04T06:55:00.000Z	nomin		are there any known issues with upgrading to dapper from breezy?
2006-06-04T06:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	when you repartition, give yourself a separate partition for /home
2006-06-04T06:58:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	why do you recommend that?
2006-06-04T06:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	so next time you can reinstall the OS, without touching your data
2006-06-04T06:59:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	that's a good idea.
2007-08-14T15:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	just make sure /home is unmounted
2007-08-14T15:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	how odd
2007-08-14T15:30:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	it's not mounted.  I'm in a live session.
2007-08-14T15:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	did you remove the partition above /home?
2007-08-14T15:31:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	it's unallocated
2007-08-14T15:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	resize option should give you a slider you can push to the right
2007-08-14T15:33:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	it only moves to the left.

2007-08-14T15:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	I see no free space there - which partition is /home?
2007-08-14T15:39:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	/home is /deb/hdb7
2007-08-14T15:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	see how the extended partition finishes at 21342?
2007-08-14T15:40:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	yes
2007-08-14T15:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nomin	which is where /home finishes?
2007-08-14T15:41:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	yes.
2007-08-14T15:41:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	oh, ok.  Forgot about the extended partion.
2007-08-14T15:41:00.000Z	nomin	Frogzoo	ty.
