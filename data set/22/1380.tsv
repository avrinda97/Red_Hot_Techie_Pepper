2010-06-03T18:50:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	eh, are you sure you have the original sources.list and nothing else? what about the directory /etc/apt/source.list.d?
2010-06-03T18:51:00.000Z	Mojak	LjL	from what I see, the back-up is the same as the original sources.list: here's what it gives me when grepping sources: http://www.coppa.org
2010-06-03T18:51:00.000Z	Mojak		ups
2010-06-03T18:51:00.000Z	Mojak		sources.list
2010-06-03T18:51:00.000Z	Mojak		sources.list.back-up
2010-06-03T18:51:00.000Z	Mojak		sources.list.d
2010-06-03T18:51:00.000Z	Mojak		sources.list.distUpgrade
2010-06-03T18:51:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	sources.list.d is a directory, it may contain other files
2010-06-03T18:52:00.000Z	Mojak	LjL	opera.list  opera.list.distUpgrade < this is what's inside sources.list.d
2010-06-03T18:53:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	then you have added the repositories for Opera, i suspect. maybe they've been moved, try to look inside those files and see if the URL they point to still exists
2010-06-03T18:53:00.000Z	Mojak	LjL	ok, will do that
2010-06-03T18:55:00.000Z	Mojak	LjL	checked it. they're working fine. it gives me an error for the links which are in sources list
2010-06-03T18:55:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	which ones, exactly?
2010-06-03T18:56:00.000Z	Mojak		there are a lot, dunno if I should paste them here, all are from ro.archive.ubuntu.com
2010-06-03T18:57:00.000Z	Mojak	LjL	there are a lot, dunno if I should paste them here, all are from ro.archive.ubuntu.com (forgot to tab for your nick^^)
2010-06-03T18:57:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	you can paste the errors on http://paste.ubuntu.com or http://pastebin.com
2010-06-03T18:57:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	actually nevermind. ro.archive.ubuntu.com doesn't currently seem to point to anything
2010-06-03T18:58:00.000Z	LjL		oh, actually it pings. but it's down or something.
2010-06-03T18:58:00.000Z	Mojak		yeah, they timeout at ping. should I comment them for now?
2010-06-03T18:58:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	i suggest you change to another mirror, at least temporarily
2010-06-03T18:58:00.000Z	LjL	Mojak	just change them to (for example) "se.archive.ubuntu.com"
2010-06-03T18:58:00.000Z	Mojak	LjL	ok. thanks for the help, man
