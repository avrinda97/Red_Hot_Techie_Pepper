2007-08-03T14:18:00.000Z	Ace2016		Hi all
2007-08-03T14:19:00.000Z	Ace2016		can someone help me install nvidia drivers, the ones in the repos do not wrok, and the beta one compiles but does not modprobe correctly
2007-08-03T14:19:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	& BLKGhost, what kind of nvidia cards do you guys have?
2007-08-03T14:22:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	ok so you need the one from nvidia.com.  you got that one, right?
2007-08-03T14:23:00.000Z	Ace2016	macogw	yup the latest beta drivers
2007-08-03T14:24:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	the latest finished nvidia drivers dont work?
2007-08-03T14:24:00.000Z	Ace2016	macogw	ones in the repo?
2007-08-03T14:24:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	no the ones from nvidia.com
2007-08-03T14:24:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_100.14.11.html
2007-08-03T14:25:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	ok yeah thats what you want. its not beta
2007-08-03T14:25:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	why would you want beta?
2007-08-03T14:26:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	its just not in feisty because feisty is stable meaning no updates for features, just for security
2007-08-03T14:26:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	that doesnt mean things not in feisty are beta though
2007-08-03T14:26:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	it just didnt exist when feisty was released
2007-08-03T14:27:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	anyway, do you have build-essential and kernel headers?
2007-08-03T14:27:00.000Z	Ace2016	macogw	i want beta because 100.14.11 does not work
2007-08-03T14:27:00.000Z	Ace2016	macogw	installs fine but does not modprobe
2007-08-03T14:27:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	you dont modprobe it separate, X does when you start X
2007-08-03T14:28:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	did you completely exit (including "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop") X before compiling it?
2007-08-03T14:28:00.000Z	Ace2016	macogw	starting x fails
2007-08-03T14:28:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	did you do startx or sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start?
2007-08-03T14:28:00.000Z	macogw	Ace2016	ok, try the other one (worth a shot)
