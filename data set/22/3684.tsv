2008-09-22T08:28:00.000Z	sp00n		I am trying to get streaming movs to play. anyone please?
2008-09-22T08:28:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	wihich browser
2008-09-22T08:29:00.000Z	sp00n		joe: any.  i have tried in firefox and konqueror.  it would be more convenient to get it working in a browser that isn't opera, even though that's my preferred browser because my school's class site doesn't load properly in opera
2008-09-22T08:30:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	I was thinking maybe the Mozilla MPlayer plugin
2008-09-22T08:31:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	neither of those work
2008-09-22T08:32:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	mplayer attempts to load the streaming file in the external player, and pops up an error message "no stream found", which is incorrect because it works on the XP machine. VLC plugin displays a black "no video" window instead of playing.
2008-09-22T08:33:00.000Z	joe_		Sp00n: not a perfect fix but can you copy the link for the video and paste it into vlc or mplayer
2008-09-22T08:34:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	I can't, because it's a javascripted sendback...I don't have access to the URL. And mplayer tries to open it in the player manually and says "no stream found", which I know is wrong.
2008-09-22T08:37:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	I also have the option to set mozilla to "quicktime plugin 6.0", and it tries to play the video, shows an mplayer plugin logo but stops as soon as it starts to play
2008-09-22T08:38:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	I'm still looking around for a mov file embedded to see if I can play it
2008-09-22T08:39:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	k, thanx.  i am worried because i need to watch these for school and i've been trying to get this to work for like 3 hours
2008-09-22T08:46:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	found something about a quicktime plugin in wine
2008-09-22T08:47:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	hm
2008-09-22T08:51:00.000Z	joe_		what are the rules about links, I wanna post a link to sp00n?
2008-09-22T08:52:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=718919
2008-09-22T08:52:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	thanks,i'll check that out
2008-09-22T08:58:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	I can't play quicktime either
2008-09-22T08:59:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	oh bummer. I've been doing a lot of research and apparently it's a fairly common issue.  I have tried the vlc plugin, mplayer, and gxine
2008-09-22T09:00:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	it took me forever to find mov embedded to see
2008-09-22T09:03:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	it appears I would have to try it under Wine...I'll check that out, and I also run VirtualBox so I could just load it up in IE on XP because I know it works OK in windows...assuming I can get Quicktime working on VBox
2008-09-22T09:06:00.000Z	joe_	sp00n	I would say for tonight Vbox is you best bet... I just checked my win2k install in Vbox and it plays there
2008-09-22T09:09:00.000Z	sp00n	joe_	i am tryin it in vbox right now...i dont have quicktime installed tho
