2007-04-19T13:05:00.000Z	richw	candyman	Yeah bit of electronics.. PIC Controller + Serial port maybe?
2007-04-19T13:06:00.000Z	richw	candyman	Need some electronics + soldering skills ;)
2007-04-19T13:06:00.000Z	candyman	richw	is there a GOOD (and i mean non confusing, non technobabble) guide for this?
2007-04-19T13:06:00.000Z	candyman		soldering is not a problem, we'll learn
2007-04-19T13:08:00.000Z	richw	candyman	Not sure.. PIC is a very popular chip though.. you have to write or download some source code and program it with a programmer

2007-04-19T13:08:00.000Z	richw	candyman	You could make it switch a relay and turn something off and on
2007-04-19T13:09:00.000Z	candyman	richw	where can said "programmers" be bought?  Would my local college have them in stock?
