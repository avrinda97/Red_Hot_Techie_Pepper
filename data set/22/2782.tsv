2009-03-20T09:43:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	my problem is with using logmein
2009-03-20T09:41:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	I'll try if I can
2009-03-20T09:41:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	mind if i pm?
2009-03-20T09:41:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	I don't mind but you should post to the channel unless you have a good reason
2009-03-20T09:42:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	fair enough, just seems like there is a lot going on in the room
2009-03-20T09:44:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	there is a thread here that describes my exact problem, but no resolution http://community.logmeinrescue.com/logmein/board/message?board.id=31&message.id=457
2009-03-20T09:45:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	so i don't think it's just me being new and naive
2009-03-20T09:51:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	can you try running this...                     pasuspender firefox
2009-03-20T09:51:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	from terminal?
2009-03-20T09:51:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	yah. close firefox first.
2009-03-20T09:59:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	no dice- with java turned off it loads only a black screen for remote control, with java on ff freezes
2009-03-20T10:00:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	sorry not something I am real familiar with; I don't have any other good guesses at the moment
2009-03-20T10:01:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	that is most unfortunate, it is one of only two things i still must rely on windows for
2009-03-20T10:03:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	what does the 'remote control' do? Does it just get you a remote desktop?
2009-03-20T10:04:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	yeah, i do it work and it allows me to work on client's machines from a distance from any internet capable machine (apparently as long as it's windows)
2009-03-20T10:05:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	I.T. work, that is
2009-03-20T10:06:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	 maybe you can try it under wine. I actually had a program like this that worked for me in my browser under wine
2009-03-20T10:07:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	does wine support activex?
2009-03-20T10:08:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	Yes I think so if you are using IE under wine. As I recall, flash on windows is an activex thing and that works under wine. You may try ies4linux or winetricks or crossover to install IE easily
2009-03-20T10:10:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	being fairly new, what should i try first?
2009-03-20T10:11:00.000Z	pturing	ShinyHat	crossover is easiest and most polished. http://www.codeweavers.com      it is for-pay but it is also open source. the people that make it are among the main wine developers
2009-03-20T10:13:00.000Z	ShinyHat	pturing	ok, thanks for the help- greatly appreciated.  now all i have to do is successfully tether my blackberry pearl and i'll be all set to cut windows ties :)
