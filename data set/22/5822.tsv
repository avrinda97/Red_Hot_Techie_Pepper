2007-02-17T16:26:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		who asked me to let them know if i get 1280x800 working on console?
2007-02-17T16:27:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		coz i did, and it's awesome. just: apt-get install hwinfo; sudo hwinfo --framebuffer|grep1280; add that mode (0xXXX) to the boot line as vga=0xXXX
2007-02-17T16:28:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	not 1280x800, 1280x1024!!
2007-02-17T16:28:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	also follow those instructions and you can do it for that too
2007-02-17T16:29:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	i know how to change the resolution on the console, but there are only 3 or 4 modes for standard framebuffer
2007-02-17T16:30:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	not with mine
2007-02-17T16:30:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	ok i check ;)
2007-02-17T16:30:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	did you try hwinfo --framebuffer? there should be all the supported native resolutions
2007-02-17T16:31:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	wait
2007-02-17T16:33:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	$>: hwinfo --framebuffer doesnt prints out anything, but fglrx is the worst driver ive ever seen
2007-02-17T16:33:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	sudo hwinfo
2007-02-17T16:34:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	ah really wonderfull, found "Mode 0x0376: 1600x1200 (+6400), 32 bits", going to try it, thanks :-D
2007-02-17T16:34:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	lol that *might* be too small :)
2007-02-17T16:35:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	change this in menu.lst or where?
2007-02-17T16:35:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	yep, just add vga=0x0376 to the boot line
2007-02-17T16:35:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	i mean Mode 0x0346: 1400x1050 (+5632), 32 bits
2007-02-17T16:35:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	add whichever mode you want to try to the boot line (after quiet splash etc - although i have those disabled)
2007-02-17T16:36:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	but definitely easier on the eyes when using a proper resolution
2007-02-17T16:36:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	ive got a "ubuntu from scratch" :)
2007-02-17T16:36:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	i know
2007-02-17T16:42:00.000Z	ameinke	pppoe_dude	working fine, thank for that info
2007-02-17T16:45:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	ameinke	no problem :)
