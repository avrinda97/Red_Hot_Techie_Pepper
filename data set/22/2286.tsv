2009-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	jacky4		im having trouble with a nvidia video card giving me full resolution...the max i can have is 1200 x 800 but my screen goes way higher than that...any ideas...im using nvidia 180 drivers
2009-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	jacky4		using buntu 9.04
2009-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	you'll need to run it with: gksudo nvidia-settings
2009-07-27T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	you can add lines to xorg.conf to get weird resolutions
2009-07-27T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	i use command line a lot, and irc is text based so I give text based advice
2009-07-27T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	i can hive you mine for reference if you wish
2009-07-27T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	actually i cant as my ubuntu box is off right now :(
2009-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	you can add resolutions to xorg.conf if the app will not give you the res you desire, if you websearch around you will find examples of the file which you can copy parts out of
2009-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	i know
2009-07-27T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	sure
2009-07-27T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	ok in the subsection display in the screen section add this: Modes      "1024x768@60"
2009-07-27T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	change the res to whatever you want it to do
2009-07-27T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	you will need: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    to get write access
2009-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	jacky4	ActionParsnip	i dont want to mess this up could you add that line to where it supposed to go and pastebin it back to me...res 1920 by 1200

2009-07-27T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	maybe so but if you use a 15" CRT monitor ten it won't
2009-07-27T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	you may need to tweak xorg.conf to match your monitor settings
2009-07-27T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	then your xorg.conf doesnt reflect that
2009-07-27T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	not sure tbh, if you search round for sample xorg.conf files using nvidia you will bump into something juicy
2009-07-27T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	you may need to increase the refresh rates in the monitor section
2009-07-27T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacky4	could be the key, if you use the .run file from nvidia.com you may hit gold. I wiould make sure you uninstall all the curret nvidia stuff
