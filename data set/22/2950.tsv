2009-12-23T00:24:00.000Z	Guest34943		I am having an issue with that mediatomb can someone tell me why it says "database is locked"
2009-12-23T00:26:00.000Z	Guest34943		why does my mediatomb say database is locked when I use sudo mediatomb?
2009-12-23T00:26:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	What are you trying to accomplish with mediatomb?
2009-12-23T00:27:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	You could try ushare. I used it in the past and know for facts that it worked well.
2009-12-23T00:29:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Do try ushare then. It got that DNLA thing for PS3.
2009-12-23T00:31:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Keep it here instead of PMs.  Also, it worked for my Xbox360. First, install ushare then let me know.
2009-12-23T00:31:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	This is the channel. :)
2009-12-23T00:32:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	That is correct.
2009-12-23T00:32:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	When you're done, run "gksudo gedit /etc/ushare.conf" to edit settings.
2009-12-23T00:34:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	USHARE_NAME, USHARE_DIR, ENABLE_DLNA.
2009-12-23T00:34:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Just in case, add a new line under DLNA --> USHARE_ENABLE_DLNA=yes
2009-12-23T00:34:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Run this command first --> gksudo gedit /etc/ushare.conf
2009-12-23T00:35:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	So you do have ENABLE_DLNA=yes and USHARE_ENABLE_DLNA=yes, right?
2009-12-23T00:38:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	ENABLE_DLNA=yes (NEW LINE) USHARE_ENABLE_DLNA=yes
2009-12-23T00:39:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	I don't know. It won't hurt to save it now and restart ushare, testing it on PS3.
2009-12-23T00:41:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	PS3 -- Well, you should just click on Video or Network and see if the new name show up.
2009-12-23T00:41:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	sudo service ushare restart
2009-12-23T00:41:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Correct. That's what UpNp is for. :)
2009-12-23T00:42:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Can you please paste your /etc/ushare.conf ?
2009-12-23T00:45:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Provide me the link.
2009-12-23T00:45:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	I found it (sean).
2009-12-23T00:45:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Guest34943	Your laptop/computer? Connected via wifi or wired?
