2012-09-27T19:08:00.000Z	c2tarun		hi, can anybody please tell me how to change the values of energy star? (xset +dpms) Here is something that I want to increase Standby: 33    Suspend: 49    Off: 66
2012-09-27T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	xset dpms X Y Z   (in seconds)
2012-09-27T19:09:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	hmm.. that was simple, so stupid of me :( thanks a lot
2012-09-27T19:51:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	are you rebooting?
2012-09-27T19:51:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	nope
2012-09-27T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	so just after a few minutes, the output of "xset q" changes?
2012-09-27T19:52:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	yeah
2012-09-27T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	what environment do you run in?  Default ubuntu with unity?
2012-09-27T19:53:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	I use KDE on Ubuntuv12.04
2012-09-27T19:53:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	is it possible that I it is because I have two desktop environment?
2012-09-27T19:54:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	hmm.  I don't know.  I guess there's some kde daemon.  I think kde uses dconf, check dconf-editor for something relevant.  Also, aren't those settings exposed in the gui somewhere?  Maybe easier to just modify there
2012-09-27T19:54:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	did you load both of them?
2012-09-27T19:54:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	what do mean by both of them? I can start only one at a time right?
2012-09-27T19:55:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	you could start another instance of X and load both.  But, I was actually asking if you had logged into both (log into one, log out, log into the other)
2012-09-27T19:55:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	nope, actually I haven't logged into unity for months
2012-09-27T19:56:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	maybe someone in #kubuntu knows.  But my strategy would be to check running daemons for anything obvious, check dconf, see if it happens when you load a different environment
2012-09-27T20:01:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	well I have hell lot of daemons running, but none of them is dconf.
2012-09-27T20:02:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	nah, I just mean to look for daemons that look like they have to do with power settings.  Dconf was unrelated
2012-09-27T20:02:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	ohh...
2012-09-27T20:03:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	and these settings may actually be exposed through the gui; but I haven't used kde in a long time
2012-09-30T14:50:00.000Z	jrib	c2tarun	if you're looking for random suggestions (since you've been at this for a while now): have you tried logging into different (preferably simpler, like fluxbox for example) environments?  Does it get reset at boot, or only after login?
2012-09-30T14:52:00.000Z	c2tarun	jrib	it gets reset at its will :( some times in a min, some times in 10 or 15. (at least I am not able to find a pattern). It has no connection is restarting/rebooting
