2008-11-18T01:03:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> lets see if we can take a peek at your settings, you have to boot from a liveCD and then we can start mounting those drives/partition to peek
2008-11-18T01:03:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> you have how many hard disk?
2008-11-18T01:04:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> and you are chatting from a different computer right?
2008-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> okay, now boot the liveCD on the box where you installed ubuntu, and then open a terminal and we can start poking around
2008-11-18T01:06:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> i can not accept a private message, besides being here in the main channel, people can learn and correct me if am telling you wrong
2008-11-18T01:06:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> sort of sharing the learnings
2008-11-18T01:07:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> it is okay, some reads your post and people will jump in to give good advise
2008-11-18T01:09:00.000Z	n8tuser		Biscuit-> let it boot all the way until you see the desktop
2008-11-18T01:10:00.000Z	n8tuser		powertool08-> no worries you would still get updates
2008-11-18T01:11:00.000Z	powertool08	n8tuser	do I need to do anything? I still have 2.6.24-19 and my system claims to be up to date
2008-11-18T01:12:00.000Z	powertool08	n8tuser	k, thanks
2009-01-03T23:03:00.000Z	n8tuser	powertool08	-> which process are you trying to kill?
2009-01-03T23:04:00.000Z	powertool08	n8tuser	Its called "convert" I was trying to convert a jpeg to png on a cd, I guess it tried to write back to the cd and crashed, now I can't kill it even with sudo
2009-01-03T23:06:00.000Z	n8tuser	powertool08	-> is the process still connected to your cd drive
2009-01-03T23:07:00.000Z	powertool08	n8tuser	I guess so
2009-01-03T23:08:00.000Z	n8tuser	powertool08	-> try this  fuser -km /dev/cdrom
2009-01-09T04:36:00.000Z	n8tuser	powertool08	-> look into  udev rules,   /etc/udev/rules.d
2009-01-09T04:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	powertool08	-> look into  udev rules,   /etc/udev/rules.d
2009-01-09T04:38:00.000Z	powertool08	n8tuser	which rule file specifically? hal? persistent-storage? something else?
2009-01-09T04:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	powertool08	-> possibly all of the above.. look around there
2009-01-09T04:39:00.000Z	powertool08	n8tuser	ok, thanks
