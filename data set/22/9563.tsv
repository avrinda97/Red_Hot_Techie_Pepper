2006-05-04T15:29:00.000Z	sleepy_		it says "export: '/usr/bin/gcc' : is not a valid identifier"
2006-05-04T15:31:00.000Z	sleepy_		there is no .bashrc in my home folder
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	sleepy_		I'm not using an ls
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	sleepy_		I'm in gnome
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	sleepy_		so how to I edit it then?
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	sleepy_		oh
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	sleepy_		ok
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	sleepy_		in where?
2006-05-04T15:32:00.000Z	sleepy_		I'm trying to install the nvidia drivers
2006-05-04T15:33:00.000Z	sleepy_		and it keeps saying that gcc isn't there, or isn't enabled
2006-05-04T15:33:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-05-04T15:35:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	but you do know that you don't need gcc to install the nvidia drivers, right?
2006-05-04T15:37:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	_what_ keeps telling you that?
2006-05-04T15:37:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	ubuntu has nvidia driver packages
2006-05-04T15:38:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	I've used them at 1600x1200
2006-05-04T15:38:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	have you tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2006-05-04T15:38:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	try it
2006-05-04T15:39:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	no, nv is the open-source driver, _not_ the proprietary one.  Please read the wiki page I sent you.
2006-05-04T15:40:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	leave it blank
2006-05-04T15:41:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	you selected "nvidia", rather than "nv" I hope...
2006-05-04T15:41:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	fine
2006-05-04T15:42:00.000Z	tritium	sleepy_	then you've not followed the wiki page instructions to install the nvidia packages
