2006-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	Red-Sox		How do I resume a wget download?
2006-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	wget -c <sameurl>
2006-12-19T09:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	wget --help says it means "recursive".
2006-12-20T08:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	What problem are you having?
2006-12-20T08:35:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	3D alleceleration with my card
2006-12-20T08:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	What card?
2006-12-20T08:35:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	Radeon X1300 mobility
2006-12-20T08:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	Oh. You will need fglrx to get 3D accel on that, yes.
2006-12-20T08:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	Although the drivers in the repos should suffice.
2006-12-20T08:37:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	What's the package name?
2006-12-20T08:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	And what happen? Somebody set up us the bomb?
2006-12-20T08:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	I highly doubt radeon will give you 3D accel on X1300.
2006-12-20T08:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	Firstly, why are you on a -386 kernel? You should be in generic. Secondly, I say again, I very highly doubt radeon supports x1300. Liberion, you might want to check it out properly before recommending it.
2006-12-20T08:45:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	You're saying my card (with 128MB onboard) doesn't support 3D accel?
2006-12-20T08:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	Of course not. I am saying that the free, open-source radeon driver will not give you 3D.
2006-12-20T08:46:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	Okay
2006-12-20T08:47:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	Any drivers that _would_?
2006-12-20T08:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	fglrx would.
2006-12-20T08:48:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	Does it have a name?
2006-12-20T08:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	does what have a name?
2006-12-28T08:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	Red-Sox	xvidcap
2006-12-28T08:23:00.000Z	Red-Sox	arrenlex	Not in the repost? :(
