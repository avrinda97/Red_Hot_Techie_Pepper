2009-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	Nate_		hello
2009-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	Nate_		was wondering if someone could help me with something
2009-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	Nate_		I've just loaded up linux onto my machine
2009-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	Nate_		and I've tried to surf the web with it
2009-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	Nate_		but each time I try, it kicks me out to a login screen
2009-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	Nate_		I can't seem to figure out why
2009-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	Nate_		ouch
2009-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	Nate_		I lagged big time
2009-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	Nate_		I was going to ask
2009-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	Nate_		I
2009-06-19T08:19:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	 youre able to log in?  and then try to surf the net with which browser?
2009-06-19T08:20:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	sounds likle a pretty bad bug, I think it must be something with your hardware, what version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-06-19T08:22:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	 I suggest you create another partition, around 10 gigs, then install 8.10 on that one partition and see if 8.10 works on your system
2009-06-19T08:24:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	 I have a 500 gig hard drive as well, first I installed 8.04 then installed 9.04 on my desktop, firefox crashed on both, sometimes it worked on 8.04,  9.04 works just fine on the laptop I just bought today
2009-06-19T08:24:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	 do you have an nvidia video card?
2009-06-19T08:25:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	 try what msl just suggested
2009-06-19T08:26:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	are you using the machine that has the problem?
2009-06-19T08:26:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	so turn on the machine that has the problem, then start a terminal and in the terminal type in what msl suggested
2009-06-19T08:32:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	sounds like ubuntu didnt like your hardware, I suggest you try 8.10, just create another partition using GParted and install everything just for kicks
2009-06-19T08:36:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	 excellent idea!  I think you might have better luck with the live CD because ubuntu wont be touching your hard drive
2009-06-19T08:45:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	 if it's the graphics card then that's an easy one, you can just use vga drivers, that one always works
2009-06-19T08:45:00.000Z	mezquitale	Nate_	download 8.10 and try the CD first, see if it works
