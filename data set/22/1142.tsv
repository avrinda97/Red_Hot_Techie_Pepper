2010-09-21T17:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	AbhiJit	in one command?  you can mount an iso file like any files system with loop and you can clmascan that
2010-09-21T17:28:00.000Z	AbhiJit	sacarlson	before mounting it?
2010-09-21T17:28:00.000Z	AbhiJit	sacarlson	i have 3 iso files in one folder. so dont want to do three clamscan commands. so can i scan that 3 iso in only one command?

2010-09-21T17:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	AbhiJit	you can write a script to do it with one command but you will need to mount the iso files http://hacktivision.com/index.php/2008/02/24/how-to-mount-iso-images-in-ubuntu-the-ea?blog=2
