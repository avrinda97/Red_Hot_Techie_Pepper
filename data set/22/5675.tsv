2007-03-21T09:28:00.000Z	bbunuser	janga	ok how do i load ubuntu install so it can read my hdd
2007-03-21T09:29:00.000Z	janga	bbunuser	, do you want to install or just mount from live-cd?
2007-03-21T09:30:00.000Z	bbunuser	janga	id like to installso i have full speed of linux on my spanky new pc
2007-03-21T09:31:00.000Z	janga	bbunuser	, just try the "install" buttun on the desktop and see if the partitioner sees your hd
2007-03-21T09:31:00.000Z	bbunuser	janga	it doens't ive allready tried
2007-03-21T09:32:00.000Z	janga	bbunuser	so i dont see your problem actually
2007-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	janga	bbunuser	oh sorry i misunderstood
2007-03-21T09:33:00.000Z	bbunuser	janga	icant installubuntu because the ubuntu installer wont read my hdd,whichleads me to believe automounting or something is disabled
2007-03-21T09:35:00.000Z	janga	bbunuser	, ibelieve the kernel should recognize the hd, i dont know why it doesnt
2007-03-21T09:37:00.000Z	janga	bbunuser	,i would search ubuntuforums.org for the name of the controller and the name of the hd, maybe there really is a bug ?
2007-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	bbunuser	janga	 i should have done that initallyi guess i was taking the easy irc option thanks anyway for trying to help illprobs just install ubuntu on a 5gig seagate
