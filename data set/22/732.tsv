2011-04-17T22:33:00.000Z	asddssdsd		it comes out in 1 week
2011-04-17T22:33:00.000Z	asddssdsd		yes

2011-04-17T22:33:00.000Z	asddssdsd		yes but the thing is
2011-04-17T22:33:00.000Z	asddssdsd		i dont want to upgrade in a month if i install now
2011-04-17T22:34:00.000Z	asddssdsd		at least i want use THe version installed by me for about two months
2011-04-17T22:34:00.000Z	bin_bash	asddssdsd	you'll have to anyway if you use 11.04, as it hasn't been released yet
2011-04-17T22:34:00.000Z	asddssdsd	bin_bash	okay
2011-04-17T22:35:00.000Z	asddssdsd	bin_bash	i know it
2011-04-17T22:38:00.000Z	bin_bash	asddssdsd	 that's probably a good idea. So if you start with 10.10 now, then you'll be able to use it for a few months and then upgrade to 11.04 if you'd like.
2011-04-17T22:39:00.000Z	bin_bash	asddssdsd	 My CD drive isn't recognized
