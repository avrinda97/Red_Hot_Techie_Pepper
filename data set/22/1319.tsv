2010-06-28T20:21:00.000Z	barfster		I am here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades#Network%20Upgrade%20from%206.06%20for%20Ubuntu%20Servers%20(Recommended) Point 3 and it is telling me not to do this over ssh
2010-06-28T20:21:00.000Z	barfster		But that I can do it on port 9004?
2010-06-28T20:22:00.000Z	barfster		Is there an option to do sudo do-release-upgrade in screen?
2010-06-28T20:22:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	I've done many upgrades over ssh, I believe  it starts up a secondary ssh process on another port when it starts the install.  I also tend to do my upgrades from within screen just in case.
2010-07-08T19:38:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	Please mind your language here.
2010-07-08T19:39:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	Language? I used a commonly known phrase
2010-07-08T19:42:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	This is a family friendly channel, please keep that in mind.
2010-07-08T19:43:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	My mother’s tongue is not english to me SISO and GIGO means the same thing.
2010-07-08T20:03:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	What installer?
2010-07-08T20:03:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	Which one? The graphical one from te Live CD?
2010-07-08T20:05:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	You'll want to look at the debian-installer package then. That is what powers the text based installers.
2010-07-08T20:05:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	But it’s all menues right after GRUB loading
2010-07-08T20:07:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	Okay? Maybe I misunderstand what you are asking then.
2010-07-08T20:08:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	in debian I was able to select which packages to install, in Ubuntu it just selects a predefined range.
2010-07-08T20:10:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	So you're looking for a way to customize the installer so that you can select packages?
2010-07-08T20:12:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	Yes
2010-07-08T20:13:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	tasksel or newer package select, there used to be something called dselect
2010-07-08T20:16:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	This might be a good place to start looking: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization
2010-07-08T20:17:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	Are you telling me that I have to edit the optical media itself?
2010-07-08T20:48:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	expert mode has this option
2010-07-08T20:48:00.000Z	barfster	Pici	Command line expert mode
2010-12-15T21:47:00.000Z	Pici	barfster	ext2 is fine.
