2004-11-17T13:47:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	does it make that much of a difference?
2004-11-17T13:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	it's the correct method for debian, I believe
2004-11-17T13:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	or so the #debian gurus say, anyway ;)
2004-11-17T13:49:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	sorry, i haven't reconfigured X on my debian box for quite a while
2004-11-17T13:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	heh - yes once it's right one tends to leave it alone :)
2004-11-17T13:51:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	still annoyed at ATI though :-/
2005-03-07T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	it wasn't xorg - you have a new kernel that needs new drivers to be compatible I think
2005-03-07T07:59:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	i tried re-running the nvidia installer, but all i got was an error asking for kernel sources
2005-03-07T07:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	I would expect your drivers would still work if you boot into the "old" kernal
2005-03-07T08:00:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	i tried that too, no luck, in the apt-get dist-upgrade something screwy happened
2005-03-07T08:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	hmm
2005-03-07T16:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	put noinotify in the kernel line of grub's menu.lst or revert to the previous kernel
2005-03-07T16:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	that's the work around
2005-03-07T16:49:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	when booting it says "i810_audio disabled in this configuration"
2005-03-09T08:37:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	the cards are nice, but the drivers are not
2005-03-09T08:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	yeah, it's just that any time anyone comes in and mentions ati, we know it will be a struggle...
2005-03-09T08:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	OTOH, my ati card works fine in the ppc version of Ubuntu
2005-03-09T08:39:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	airport express working under ubuntu yet?
2005-03-09T08:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	not as far as I know
2005-03-09T08:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	I think it will be a while - broadcom are unco-operative I believe
2005-03-09T08:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	_jon_	OS-X is OK I guess - but I prefer the freedom of linux ( a lot of stuff is inaccessible under OS-X)
2005-03-09T08:42:00.000Z	_jon_	thoreauputic	agreed
