2006-11-20T07:26:00.000Z	macogw		hey does anyone know how to get rid of "c compiler cannot create executables" error when doing ./configure on openvpn?
2006-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	macogw		i already have that
2006-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	macogw		 ./configure --with-ssl-lib=/usr/local/ssl/lib/ --with-ssl-headers=/usr/local/ssl/include/
2006-11-20T07:29:00.000Z	macogw		open vpn
2006-11-20T07:29:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	installing the headers isn't a workaround, it is just part of the normal installation sequence.
2006-11-20T07:30:00.000Z	macogw	sethk	the headers are installed, it just couldnt find them, so i told it where it was (./configure is all you need if it is looking in the right place)
2006-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	actually, ubuntu installs them in the wrong place, and the place configure was originally looking for them is correct.
2006-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	not that it makes an difference
2006-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	macogw	sethk	oh well that's interesting
2007-09-24T12:01:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	it varies somewhat.  don't forget that there is a num lock key that changes some keys
2007-09-24T12:02:00.000Z	macogw	sethk	there's usually a + and - both on the row of regular numbers and with the numpad that sprawls over the letters
2007-09-24T12:02:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	yes, that's true.  But some of the non-english keyboards are missing certain keys (or rather the keys are used for other characters)
2007-09-24T12:03:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	so on some foreign laptop keyboards you may need to use num lock to get +
2007-09-24T12:04:00.000Z	macogw	sethk	weird
2007-09-24T12:04:00.000Z	macogw	sethk	make that "weird and silly"
2007-09-24T12:04:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	I agree.  I wasn't saying that it's a good idea, only that the behavior does exist.
2007-11-26T23:21:00.000Z	macogw	sethk	last i checked, zsh didn't have tab-autocomplete
2007-11-26T23:21:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	you can't be serious.  The tab completion features of zsh are one of the main reasons it is superior to bash
2007-11-26T23:23:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	for example, with bash, if you complete and there are multiple completions, it types them and you have to type more of the name to disambiguate.  zsh does that, but if you then continue to press tab it iterates through the completions
2007-11-26T23:23:00.000Z	macogw	sethk	zsh is what's on the school's server as the default login shell.  if i hit tab, nothing happens
2007-11-26T23:24:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	then they have completion turned off.  You can easily re-enable it.  Create a .zshrc file in your home directory and set the flags needed for completion.
2007-11-26T23:24:00.000Z	sethk	macogw	completion enabled is the default, so they must have disabled it in a config file in /etc
