2009-03-20T22:59:00.000Z	juniecho		hey guys, how do i remove 'hibernation' entry from system shutdown dialog window?
2009-03-20T22:59:00.000Z	juniecho		babo//can you get to the terminal? if it is possible try reinstalling gnome :)
2009-03-20T23:01:00.000Z	juniecho		babo// sudo apt-get purge gnome-desktop (am i right about that package name?) and then sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop... it could work maybe.
2009-03-20T23:02:00.000Z	juniecho		and can someone help me with this... removing hibernation option from system shutdown menu?? :)
2009-03-20T23:02:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	you might have to edit gnome's source code for that but not sure
2009-03-20T23:03:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	could be somewhere in gconf-editor too
2009-03-20T23:05:00.000Z	juniecho	binarymutant	do i have to manually save settings when i mess around with this ... gconf-editor?
2009-03-20T23:05:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	I dont think so
2009-03-20T23:06:00.000Z	juniecho	binarymutant	it worked! thanks! :) unchecked can_hibernate and it is gone forever from system shutdown dialog!
2009-03-20T23:10:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	does mint use gnome?
2009-03-20T23:11:00.000Z	juniecho	binarymutant	yes it is gnome
2009-03-20T23:11:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	System->preferences->keyboard shortcuts
2009-03-20T23:13:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	gnome-keybinding-properties
2009-03-20T23:14:00.000Z	juniecho	binarymutant	yes i see it... what next?
2009-03-20T23:14:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	click on show panel menu under the Desktop section
2009-03-20T23:15:00.000Z	juniecho	binarymutant	that brings up the 'gnome menu', not 'mint menu'... :)
2009-03-20T23:15:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	I dont know what mint menu is
2009-03-20T23:16:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	what's the difference?
2009-03-20T23:17:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	the mint forums might help better, as I know nothing about this mint menu
2009-03-20T23:18:00.000Z	binarymutant	juniecho	looks like the gnome menus bunched into 1
2009-03-20T23:18:00.000Z	juniecho	binarymutant	yeah :) that's the idea i think... but looks sweeter
