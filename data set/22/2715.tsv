2009-06-15T20:23:00.000Z	Pici	grawity	I don't think that will work if gnome-panel isn't running.
2009-06-15T20:23:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Ah. *thinks about a 'service gdm restart'*
2009-06-19T18:08:00.000Z	Pici	grawity	read again
2009-06-19T18:08:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Read what?
2009-06-19T18:08:00.000Z	Pici	grawity	nevermind.
2009-07-20T23:44:00.000Z	Pici	grawity	The firewall is on, but there are no rules.
2009-07-20T23:45:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	It still does the same as if it was disavbled, I guess.
2009-09-03T23:00:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 2836CB0A8AC93F7A
2009-09-03T23:01:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Shorter, and more reliable when the Ubuntu keyserver dies again.
2009-09-03T23:01:00.000Z	Pici	grawity	thanks
2009-09-11T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Unless you import everything from __future__
2009-09-16T00:02:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Actually, GVFS mounts (the GNOME ones) are accessible under ~/.gvfs/ like any other filesystem.
2009-09-23T21:17:00.000Z	Pici	grawity	No, ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage, its a package that installs nothing but has many dependencies.

2009-10-08T20:22:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Even if he's using mingw32 on Linux?
2009-10-08T20:42:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	He is trying to connect with irssi instead of the current client. Scroll up.
2009-10-15T19:52:00.000Z	Pici	grawity	No we don't.
2009-10-15T19:52:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Jaunty and Karmic?
2009-12-16T23:28:00.000Z	grawity	Pici	Maybe. I always forget that Debian comes with Perl's 'rename'.
