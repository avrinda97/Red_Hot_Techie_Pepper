2009-11-26T17:26:00.000Z	diddy		Is there a way in Gnome desktop to force icons and folders into a grid as you can do on M$ Windows desktops? Or is the only way to right click on the desktop and choose "clean up by name" to line them up?
2009-11-26T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 i think those features are a little lacking.
2009-11-26T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 clean up by name and keep aligned are about it.
2009-11-26T17:28:00.000Z	diddy	Dr_Willis	where is "keep aligned" ?
2009-11-26T17:28:00.000Z	diddy	Dr_Willis	never mind. Found it.
2009-11-26T17:29:00.000Z	diddy	Dr_Willis	I checked "keep aligned" but what does it do? I move the icons anywhere and they stay whereever I move them.
2009-11-26T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 i think it auto aligs them when ya log in, ive never noticed.
2009-11-26T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 actually it uses a larger grid.
2009-11-26T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 you can move them. but not over 1 or 3 pixles.. ya gotta move a whole icon width
2009-11-26T17:31:00.000Z	diddy	Dr_Willis	got it. It only aligns them when in close proximity.
2009-11-26T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 it uses a 32 or 62 pixle grid to  'keep them aligned' :)
2009-11-26T17:31:00.000Z	diddy	Dr_Willis	yep. Thx
2010-01-30T12:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 given the attitude adobe has had about linux lately.. dont hold your breath
2010-04-11T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 medibuntu has a w64codecs package that does the same thing
2010-04-11T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 its at medibuntu. not in the normal repos
2010-04-11T19:05:00.000Z	diddy	Dr_Willis	yes but it doesn't work. See above
2010-04-11T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 w64codecs has worked for me for ages.
2010-04-11T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 so clarify whats not working I guess
2010-04-11T19:06:00.000Z	diddy	Dr_Willis	then you didn't use .wmv files
2010-04-11T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 a wmv can be any of a dozen codecs -   i have played some wmv files under ubuntub befor.
2010-04-11T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 so - it all depends on the esact video file.
2010-04-11T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	diddy	 this isent somthing from some porn site is it?
