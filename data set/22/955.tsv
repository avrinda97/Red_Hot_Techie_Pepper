2010-12-29T23:58:00.000Z	gsfai		one HD, 4 partitions, no encryption
2010-12-29T23:58:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	so whats the actual problem besides it seems you don't understand grub2, the computer is bricked you say. Is it just not booting to anything now.
2010-12-29T23:58:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	it drops to a grub shell.
2010-12-29T23:59:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	run this script and pastebin the generated file.http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2010-12-30T00:01:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	cool it will give us a better view of the whole thang
2010-12-30T00:04:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	by the way this script is much more agile in finding OS'es than grub2 installation
2010-12-30T00:05:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	grub2 if the os-prober is installed and everything in order will find most other OS's. Are you using other then the Ubuntu desktop
2010-12-30T00:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	without the script being posted we are flailing about I suspect you have mixed grub-legacy and grub2 together this can be fixed.
2010-12-30T00:13:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	i... formatted it, grub legacy could ninja-dodge a format?
2010-12-30T00:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	post the script if you want my help
2010-12-30T00:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	can you read the script yourself, do you see menu.list and grub.cfg in the boot section of the Ubuntu partition?
2010-12-30T00:33:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	excuse me but i dont understand anything
2010-12-30T00:39:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	so what is keeping you from booting a cd and running the script and posting it. here is what mine looks like.  http://www.codepad.eu/view/95608103
2010-12-30T00:40:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	im from a bootable pc, and i posted the pastebin a few thousand lines ago
2010-12-30T00:41:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	http://gsfai.pastebin.com/PT1sVH6E <-- thats the output from the script you gave me, i pasted the output a few minutes ago but you missed it
2010-12-30T00:41:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	It may be here but tab my nick and the pastebin again I don't see it I'm helping several people.
2010-12-30T00:43:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	so is there a way to remove every single trace of grub2 from my HDD, and install the old and good grub 1?
2010-12-30T00:43:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	first your missing this in the sda6 /boot/grub/grub.cfg boot line look at mine
2010-12-30T00:44:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	i dont have any grub.cfg, i only have a grubenv, which looks like a result of what happens if you let a 3 year old child touch the keyboard... ######################
2010-12-30T00:48:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	here is a link to chroot in to remove grub2 and reinstall it or grub-legacy. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1581099
2010-12-30T00:54:00.000Z	gsfai	nit-wit	thanks for that forum topic, i think im going to get a solution at last!
2010-12-30T00:55:00.000Z	nit-wit	gsfai	look in the signature of the author for all things grub2 it is actually easier but there is a learning curve.
