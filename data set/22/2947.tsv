2009-02-15T08:37:00.000Z	MK13		i want the server to get it from Vista, since vista deals out ip's for the rest of the computers i connect to at home. But the weird thing is that in VMware the Ubuntu Server installation connects to the Vista pc flawlessly
2009-02-15T08:37:00.000Z	MK13		I guess VMware has built in DHCP
2009-02-15T08:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	okay, then the Ubuntu PC needs dhclient3, which it should already have installed
2009-02-15T08:38:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	how could I tell just to be sure?
2009-02-15T08:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	For dhclient to work the interface needs to be set up for DHCP, or Network Manager should manage the interface
2009-02-15T08:38:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	any good tutorials?
2009-02-15T08:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	apt-cache policy dhcp3-client
2009-02-15T08:41:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	prints out dhcp3 client: installed: 3.1....  canidate... etc.
2009-02-15T08:41:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	That's installed then. Now, do you want NetworkManager to mange the connection or set it up yourself
2009-02-15T08:42:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	i'd like to try Network manger first
2009-02-15T08:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	OK, so we need to ensure that something isn't preventing NM from managing that interface. Can you generate a report using the commands I'm about to give you, and then copy the results to a pastebin?
2009-02-15T08:44:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	i'll try atleast
2009-02-15T08:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	"ifconfig >/tmp/report.log && cat /etc/network/interfaces >>/tmp/report.log"
2009-02-15T08:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	You can then load the file /tmp/report.log into a text-editor, and copy-paste the contents into the pastebin
2009-02-15T08:46:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	on a side note i realise that after a fresh reboot at the command "sudo ifconfig" that eth0 isn't listed, i have to run "sudo ifconfig -a"
2009-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	okay, that could be useful to know!
2009-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	i just remembered, sry
2009-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	let's see what we find out
2009-02-15T08:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	Okay, that looks good... now we just have to figure out why the interface doesn't appear at boot-time... if we do that, the rest will follow
2009-02-15T08:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	MK13	can you pastebin the results of: "sudo lspci -vvnn >/tmp/report.log"
2009-02-15T09:59:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	sorry, i got disconnected, did you find out anything?
2009-02-15T10:09:00.000Z	MK13	IntuitiveNipple	you there?
