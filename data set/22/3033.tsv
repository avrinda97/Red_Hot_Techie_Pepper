2008-12-29T04:37:00.000Z	zoor		Hi I need your help please. My eyes are exploding any minute now. I cant seem to get ubuntu to understand that my monitor is capable of handling refresh rates above 0Hz :)
2008-12-29T04:37:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: try "X -configure" at commandline
2008-12-29T04:39:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	I've tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-conf. I got that advide from the ubuntu forum. Is that the same?
2008-12-29T04:39:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: no, it isn't the same... it calculates all your displayable modes and creates you a new xorg.conf file
2008-12-29T04:39:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	ok. I'll give it a try.
2008-12-29T04:39:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: While the other command reconfigures the xserver-xorg package
2008-12-29T04:41:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	It didnt work. Am I allowed to paste the output in here?
2008-12-29T04:42:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: terminal window : sudo X -configure
2008-12-29T04:42:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: I just went thru your problem today... tried "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" first, didn't fix it... then "X -configure" worked, I now have *all* possible video modes/resolutions in my menus
2008-12-29T04:42:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	I did... it didn't work. "fatal error" and so on
2008-12-29T04:43:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	I could paste them to you if you want?
2008-12-29T04:43:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: use pastebin --> paste.ubuntu.com
2008-12-29T04:43:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	ok, hold on
2008-12-29T04:44:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	http://paste.ubuntu.com/94647/
2008-12-29T04:45:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: that was my fault... do it from a failsafe terminal (select sessions at login screen, failsafe terminal)
2008-12-29T04:45:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: It reconfigures your X server (what displays your desktop/panels/etc. and can't be done while it's running (now)
2008-12-29T04:46:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	ok. I'll give it a go. Thanks in advanced. I let you know if I succeeds :)
2008-12-29T04:46:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: You'll likey need "sudo" for taht if I remember right
2008-12-29T04:46:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	ok
2008-12-29T04:46:00.000Z	asdffdsas	zoor	: please do, cuz i just dealt with that *today*
2008-12-29T04:55:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	It didn't work. It complained about my X server and then it said that it couldnt found my monitor.
2008-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	zoor	asdffdsas	My xorg.conf looks really... hmm... thin to say the least. http://paste.ubuntu.com/94657/
