2007-08-31T09:48:00.000Z	Evanlec		but it doesnt seem to be true transparency, like windows dont show below it
2007-08-31T09:49:00.000Z	Evanlec		just the desktop background

2007-08-31T09:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Evanlec	try irssi
2007-08-31T09:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	Evanlec	takes a little getting use to but once you get just a couple of command down it's pretty good..
2007-08-31T09:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	Evanlec	It only uses screen if you want it to.
2007-09-26T09:54:00.000Z	Evanlec	Scunizi	yea its windows version of vmware...
2007-09-26T09:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	Evanlec	Beltz..  you might have better luck downloading the Win32 version of VMWare Server
2007-10-12T09:20:00.000Z	Evanlec	Scunizi	no shit? been wonderin about that
2007-10-12T09:22:00.000Z	Evanlec	Scunizi	u using VMware or virtualbox ?
2007-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	Evanlec	VMWare Server.
2007-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	Evanlec	Scunizi	ever try vbox? i heard it was faster...which means a lot when it comes to virtual machines in my opinion
2007-10-12T09:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	Evanlec	bqmassey .. VMWare runs win2kpro just as fast as if it was insalled on it's own machine.. no problems whatever with speed.
2007-10-12T09:25:00.000Z	Evanlec	Scunizi	well okay but that all depends on what ur using it for, of course not games
2007-10-12T09:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	Evanlec	that's why I have a dual boot.. for games.. win2k is just for accessing some work programs that need windows including some websites.
