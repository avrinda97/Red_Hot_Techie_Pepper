2009-04-26T11:29:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	you tried reconfiguring the X server?
2009-04-26T11:30:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ?
2009-04-26T11:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	no that is useless in itrepid
2009-04-26T11:32:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	has X ever worked?
2009-04-26T11:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	yes it has for a very long time, just tried cat command on that file ad i get stale NFS file what does that mean?
2009-04-26T11:33:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	is X running? check top.
2009-04-26T11:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	just checked it is not listed so no it aint running
2009-04-26T11:36:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	any ideas what might have happened to my xorg
2009-04-26T11:37:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	tried rebooting?
2009-04-26T11:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	many times :'(
2009-04-26T11:37:00.000Z	yoasif		is there anything in your xorg.conf?
2009-04-26T11:38:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		what the command to delete stuff, i thought it was rf?
2009-04-26T11:38:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	m
2009-04-26T11:38:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	rm
2009-04-26T11:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	thnx yeah my xorg does have stuff this has happened after the latest update i guess
2009-04-26T11:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	going to delete that file in /tmp/ i dont think it should be looking there
2009-04-26T11:40:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	you can delete both files... since Xorg autoconfigures anyway
2009-04-26T11:42:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	im not allowed to delete the file even knowing im doing so in sudo tells me the file can't be deleted stale nfs file handle is there another way to force the file to be deleted?
2009-04-26T11:42:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	i would just delete xorg.conf and reboot
2009-04-26T11:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	yoasif	hmmm im definitely sure there is nothing wrong with my xorg since i manually made it, still will do so but first will back it up
2009-04-26T11:47:00.000Z	yoasif	Pirate_Hunter	always a good idea :)
