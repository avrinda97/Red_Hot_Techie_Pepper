2010-10-28T20:24:00.000Z	Pici	Osmosis	I believe  you can use: ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no     to prevent it from asking you whether you want to connect.
2010-10-28T20:25:00.000Z	Osmosis	Pici	can we use that with Rsync?
2010-10-28T20:25:00.000Z	Pici	Osmosis	Yes.  Use the -e argument to specify the ssh command.
2010-10-28T20:27:00.000Z	Osmosis	Pici	thank you very much
2010-10-28T20:30:00.000Z	Osmosis	Pici	how do you said it to use this option in the rsync?????
2010-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	Pici	Osmosis	rsync -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z	Osmosis	Pici	sorry man, using this line he still ask me for the confirmation rsync -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -ave ssh ubuntu@ec2-79-125-96-101.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/lcds_cv/ /tmp/lcds_cv/
2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z	Pici	Osmosis	Remove the second -e argument.
2010-10-28T20:34:00.000Z	Pici	Osmosis	rsync -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -avubuntu@ec2-79-125-96-101.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/lcds_cv/ /tmp/lcds_cv/
2010-10-28T20:34:00.000Z	Pici	Osmosis	(fixed) rsync -e "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -av ubuntu@ec2-79-125-96-101.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/lcds_cv/ /tmp/lcds_cv/
