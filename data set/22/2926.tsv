2009-01-20T13:41:00.000Z	arch3angel		odd thing is 8.10 shows the driver but it fails to work
2009-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	arch3angel		strange
2009-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	WalterMundt	arch3angel	I just had to get my atheros working
2009-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	arch3angel		how did ya do it
2009-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	arch3angel	WalterMundt	how did you do it
2009-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	WalterMundt	arch3angel	disable the atheros driver in the hardware thingy, install a backports-modules package (not ure of the exact name), reboot
2009-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	WalterMundt	arch3angel	that worked for me; I'm on a Jaunty alpha but the forum post I read suggesting it was for intrepid
2009-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	arch3angel	WalterMundt	do you have a link to a tutorial
2009-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	WalterMundt		sec
2009-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	arch3angel	WalterMundt	thx
2009-01-20T13:44:00.000Z	WalterMundt	arch3angel	here's here I got it from: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1026770
2009-01-20T13:44:00.000Z	WalterMundt		basically, you need to install linux-backports-modules-[your version] from Synaptic
2009-01-20T13:44:00.000Z	arch3angel	WalterMundt	thanks
2009-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	arch3angel		which model card do you have
2009-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	WalterMundt	arch3angel	mine is the AR242x in that thread
2009-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	WalterMundt	arch3angel	yours is different, but since the driver you switch to from that process is called "ath5k" I thought it might help you
2009-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	arch3angel		Atheros AR5007EG AR5BXB63 <-- thats mine
2009-01-20T13:46:00.000Z	arch3angel		i will give it a shoot - anything to get it working :)
2009-01-20T13:46:00.000Z	WalterMundt	arch3angel	good luck!
