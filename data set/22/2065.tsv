2009-10-07T09:03:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	where are you attempting to hear the sound from, speakers or headphones and is it  adesktop or laptop?
2009-10-07T09:05:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	are you attempting to hear sound from your headphones or speakers connected in the back of your desktop?
2009-10-07T09:07:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	open up "system>preferences>sound" and make sure you configure whatever application you are trying to use to point to the correct device.  I have everything pointing to alsa and it works just fine on the headphones in front of my desktop
2009-10-07T09:08:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	you can also click on "test" and see if you hear any sound
2009-10-07T09:10:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	open up a terminal and and run "alsamixer", in alsamixer raise the volume to your devices
2009-10-07T09:12:00.000Z	danielillo	mezquitale	nothing happens
2009-10-07T09:13:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	is it a USB sound card or is it inside your desktop?
2009-10-07T09:14:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	what is the output of cat /proc/asound/cards
2009-10-07T09:15:00.000Z	danielillo	mezquitale	0 [SB             ]: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI SB
2009-10-07T09:15:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	mmm.... are the speakers turned on and connected to the correct plug?
2009-10-07T09:20:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	try runing this and tell me what you hear: speaker-test  -c2 -D default default -t wav
2009-10-07T09:21:00.000Z	danielillo	mezquitale	 nothing
2009-10-07T09:22:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	what is the first line, the one with a 0 of: cat /proc/asound/modules
2009-10-07T09:26:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	it looks like the software is working fine, maybe it's a hardware error? can you try plugging in the speakers to the front of your desktop if you have the jack?
2009-10-07T09:33:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	sounds like it could be related to the virtual machine, did it ever work at all?
2009-10-07T09:34:00.000Z	danielillo	mezquitale	 on virtual machine it works all fine
2009-10-07T09:36:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	did it ever used to work at all without the virtual machine?
2009-10-07T09:39:00.000Z	danielillo	mezquitale	 wait i'll be back
2009-10-07T09:40:00.000Z	mezquitale	danielillo	try going to #alsa and tell them you are having problems with sound using alsa
