2007-07-30T08:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Quinton_	that question isn't very clear?
2007-07-30T08:09:00.000Z	Quinton_	nickrud	under the x server config i edited files and i need to know the buttons to hit to save/restart my computer
2007-07-30T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Quinton_	you'd save the file from the editor, then log out, hit ctl-alt-backspace (restarts X server), and log back in.
2007-07-30T08:11:00.000Z	Quinton_	nickrud	i need to know the save keys for it under recovery mode
2007-07-30T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Quinton_	ah! :wq

2007-07-30T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Quinton_	are there any command help hints at the bottom of the screen?

2007-07-30T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Quinton_	depends on what editor you're using. Top left of the screen: does it say gnu nano?
