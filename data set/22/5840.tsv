2007-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	cables	amar	if it's a commandline manager you're trying to use, you need sudo.
2007-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	cables	amar	did it ask for your password when you went to the package manager?
2007-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	cables	amar	if you're trying to use synaptic, do alt-f2 then "gksudo synaptic" and see if that works
2007-02-16T11:51:00.000Z	cables	amar	try what I told you
2007-02-16T11:52:00.000Z	amar	cables	when i used ur method i got dis error "dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2007-02-16T11:53:00.000Z	cables	amar	open a terminal (Applications>Accessories>Terminal) and run sudo dpkg --configure -a
