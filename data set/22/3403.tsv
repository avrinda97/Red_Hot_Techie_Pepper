2010-08-17T05:22:00.000Z	petriborg		anyone having problems with the PPA repos? one of mine doesn't seem to be loading anymore
2010-08-17T05:24:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	not ppa, but others
2010-08-17T05:25:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- your deb repos are broken?
2010-08-17T05:25:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	I'm just re-checking
2010-08-17T05:27:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- my other repos, medi, google, and ubuntu main are all working properly, i only use one PPA, XBMC, and it completely hosed up right now
2010-08-17T05:31:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	yes, the german security repo seems down, another works fine now
2010-08-17T05:32:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- hm, i see, but i don't think the PPA is "down" per say, but the output from apt-get doesn't make sense its like its *ignoring* my xbmc ppa
2010-08-17T05:33:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	whole line from sources.list ?
2010-08-17T05:33:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- i never see Hit http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/ lucid/main Translation-en_US etc like I expect
2010-08-17T05:33:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	-- deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu karmic ma
2010-08-17T05:36:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-xbmc/ppa
2010-08-17T05:36:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	sudo apt-get update
2010-08-17T05:36:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	complains about missing key ?
2010-08-17T05:37:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys >>Number-from-apt-here<<
2010-08-17T05:37:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- no it doens't complain at all but there is no xbmc in the apt-get update list
2010-08-17T05:38:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- yeah seems like the instructions from http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=HOW-TO_install_XBMC_for_Linux_on_Ubuntu_with_a_minimal_installation_step-by-step -- which as of like a few weeks ago worked for me everywhere, but tonight something happened and its all busted now
2010-08-17T05:39:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- maybe i can clear stuff out and re-add it somehow?
2010-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	strange thing, I just ran it myself, it also fetched the key, but no entry in my sources.list
2010-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- ok so it isn't just me
2010-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- something must be fucked up on the server
2010-08-17T05:45:00.000Z	DasEi	petriborg	something is wrong there, you seem right, keyserver is ub, but not the subdirs of the ppa server http://pastebin.com/iqN9SxKp
2010-08-17T05:47:00.000Z	petriborg	DasEi	- ok well good to know, i've said something in the xbmc channel but no one is alive there out of some near 200 ppl, so i guess just must wait until someone realizes it and fixes it :(
