2012-04-20T19:16:00.000Z	enthdegree		when building your own kernel, how do you specify a custom uname?
2012-04-20T19:18:00.000Z	enthdegree		xubuntu is nice
2012-04-20T19:19:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	oh hey, I assume you are using xfce. curious, are you using lvm at all with thunar? Im here for a problem where my LV's don't show up, but nobody seems to be speaking up yet :(
2012-04-20T19:20:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	are you booting from LVs or is this an external lv that you want to look at?
2012-04-20T19:21:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	nah, its boot lvm. my /usr and /var work fine, but since I upgraded to 11.10 and switched to xfce, I dont have the list of lv's in the thunar file browser like I did in gnome (which worked fine in 11.10)
2012-04-20T19:22:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	i can manually mount still just fine, and udisk enumeration shows everything is seen at least. but thunar doesn't show anyhting lvm related at all, and I enabled "enable logical volume management" in the prefs too
2012-04-20T19:23:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	does it not show up even after after it is manually mounted
2012-04-20T19:23:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	I should mention though that it seems gnome has control of my desktop itself instead of xfce, so im wondering if naut is hijacking something that is causing the problem
2012-04-20T19:24:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	no, one of my volumes is mounted now from lvm and its not in the list (short of me browsing to the /media mount point for it)
2012-04-20T19:24:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	was it ever working through thunar?
2012-04-20T19:24:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	it soundds like you installed xubuntu and then later installed some gnome suite
2012-04-20T19:25:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	don't know, I originally install this as a 9.x install, and upgraded over the years. it wasn't until yesterday that I got 11.10 and switched to xfce and noticed it
2012-04-20T19:25:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	originally this was a stock ubuntu install, with manual apt-get of xfce4 years ago. seems xfce might be missing something or conflicting with gnome somehow, but not sure other than to try remove gnome
2012-04-20T19:27:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	does thunar even output anything incriminating when you run it in the terminal
2012-04-20T19:27:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	is there any virtual package that you know of that would turn a stock ubuntu into xubuntu? in case im missing some depends or other. and sec, ill look at console output
2012-04-20T19:27:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	there may be some hook that gnome has tekon over
2012-04-20T19:28:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	not that I am aware of; the best way to get xubuntu is to install xubuntu...
2012-04-20T19:28:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	ya, seems so. as for running "thunar", it just returns to console and no stderr output at all
2012-04-20T19:30:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	well I suppose im due for a nice fresh install soon anyways :) thx for help though
2012-04-20T19:30:00.000Z	enthdegree	troubled	Have you seen this? I actually had a near-identical issue several years back but I completely forget how I solved it; this may go through it https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=130748
2012-04-20T19:36:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	tried a few things from there, no luck still. thanks anyways though
2012-04-20T22:42:00.000Z	troubled	enthdegree	oh btw, got it working fine after installing xubuntu-desktop, my LVs in thunar that is. thanks again though :)
