2010-08-22T16:43:00.000Z	meli_sha		 i installed ubuntu 10.04 to my dell laptop. i did all updates. everything works well. but sometimes after the grub ubuntu does not starts. after the grub a black screen is coming and it never goes. i click every button even the power button of laptop but it is not happening anything. can someone please help me ?
2010-08-22T16:44:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	it happens to me sometimes too since 10.04, but I have no solution other than reboot until it boots
2010-08-22T16:45:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	the problem is from kernel right ?
2010-08-22T16:45:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	it can be anything, but since the plymouth load screen you basically can't know what happens.
2010-08-22T16:45:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	have you ever look for "system log viewer" ?
2010-08-22T16:46:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	yes ?
2010-08-22T16:48:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	the problem is that the boot log is stored into a file, but that file is overwritten on the next boot ... so you can't see the log of failed boots ...
2010-08-22T16:48:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	i know that all logs are logging by date hour second... how to owerwrite them ? why we can not save them seperate ...
2010-08-22T16:49:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	I would drop that whole plymouth thing if I could, but apparently you can't
2010-08-22T16:51:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	 sorry for my english. i can not understand what you mean on your last sentence.
2010-08-22T16:51:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	ikonia, to remove the splash screen, you empty the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub
2010-08-22T16:51:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	plymouth is the "splash screen" you see at boot
2010-08-22T16:52:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	 i know that we can edit the boot command at the grub . am i right ? we dont need to chage something from os now ?!
2010-08-22T16:53:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	yes you can change this setting in the grub screen at startup too
2010-08-22T16:54:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	i will do it now. thank you! i will not come back because we dont have other alternative solutions. thank you again!
2010-08-22T17:03:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	i come back. i delete the "quiet splash" and i write "nosplash" it works. but it did not worked with "quiet nosplash" . so what is "quiete" on the boot ?
2010-08-22T17:04:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	quiet means don't write the log on screen
2010-08-22T17:04:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	on the screen ? i never had saw any log on my screen ... ?!
2010-08-22T17:05:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	yes, because "quiet" is the default
2010-08-22T17:05:00.000Z	flupke	meli_sha	you can try logging on screen to see what happens when the boot fails
2010-08-22T17:05:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	 ah to do not log. ok im sorry. i get as "to log".
2010-08-22T17:06:00.000Z	meli_sha	flupke	ok thank you! i have to leave..
