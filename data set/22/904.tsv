2011-01-23T23:51:00.000Z	faze`		is there a documentation viewer that can access all documentation installed with apt?
2011-01-23T23:51:00.000Z	faze`		like python-doc, etc
2011-01-23T23:51:00.000Z	faze`		anything with a -doc extension

2011-01-23T23:53:00.000Z	faze`		no manual entry exists for python imaging

2011-01-23T23:55:00.000Z	jrib	faze`	it usually gets installed to /usr/share/doc/
2011-01-23T23:59:00.000Z	faze`		ok i guess documentation is stored in /usr/share/doc. thanks for the lack of help
2011-01-23T23:59:00.000Z	faze`		i figured this out by typing
2011-01-23T23:59:00.000Z	jrib	faze`	but we told you that :(
2011-01-23T23:59:00.000Z	faze`		ls -alR /usr | grep -e "python-imaging-doc"
2011-01-23T23:59:00.000Z	faze`	jrib	i see you did :(
2011-01-24T00:00:00.000Z	jrib	faze`	by the way, an easier way to figure out where a package puts things is: dpkg -L PACKAGE
2011-01-24T00:00:00.000Z	faze`	jrib	sorry, i wasn't paying attention, i was trying to fix it
2011-01-24T00:00:00.000Z	faze`		oh, thank you very much
2011-01-24T00:00:00.000Z	faze`	jrib	i was just wondering if there was an app that allowed you to index and view /usr/share/doc
2011-01-24T00:00:00.000Z	faze`	jrib	maybe i'll write one
2011-01-24T00:02:00.000Z	jrib	faze`	one problem is I'm not sure if there are restrictions on the format.  Could be html, plaintext, pdf, etc.
