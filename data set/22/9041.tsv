2005-03-26T09:49:00.000Z	lagcisco		err what do i install
2005-03-26T09:51:00.000Z	lagcisco		err i cant install xorg on warty?
2005-03-26T09:52:00.000Z	lagcisco		i just need a GUI
2005-03-26T09:52:00.000Z	lagcisco		to work!
2005-03-26T09:52:00.000Z	lagcisco		so i installed the old ubuntu?
2005-03-26T09:52:00.000Z	lagcisco		warty
2005-03-26T09:52:00.000Z	lagcisco		is hoary stable?
2005-03-26T09:53:00.000Z	lagcisco		hmm so i guess ubuntu is not suitable for a stable desktop right now?
2005-03-26T09:53:00.000Z	lagcisco		i got warty 4.10
2005-03-26T09:53:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	sure it is.  Warty is stable
2005-03-26T09:54:00.000Z	lagcisco	tritium	but its really old right?
2005-03-26T09:54:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	less than 6 months
2005-03-26T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	you interrupted the install?  Perhaps you broke the install, and didn't permit xfree86 to be installed
2005-03-26T09:56:00.000Z	lagcisco	tritium	i did interupt it
2005-03-26T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	that's probably why you have no X
2005-03-26T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	it is
2005-03-26T09:58:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	can you run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86"?
2005-03-26T09:59:00.000Z	lagcisco	tritium	just did, startx didnt work after it finished
2005-03-26T10:01:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	perhaps you should reinstall, and not interrupt.  Who knows what state you left things in.
2005-03-26T10:03:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	I would not use the word "bad" with Hoary at all
2005-03-26T10:05:00.000Z	tritium	lagcisco	given that you interrupted the install, I'd recommend installing Hoary preview from scratch, rather than dist-upgrading
