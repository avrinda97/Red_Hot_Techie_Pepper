2009-03-19T05:52:00.000Z	LogicFan		anyone heard of alsa dying when power management kicks in?
2009-03-19T05:53:00.000Z	LogicFan		it seems everytime i let my laptop sit for a bit, alsa dies and i have to force reload alsa to get sound back
2009-03-19T05:53:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	all i know is that Linux support for ACPI (power mgmt) has been a bit behind the times until recently, so there may be fixes forthcoming soon
2009-03-19T05:54:00.000Z	LogicFan	bernz	judging by my google searches, a lot of people have issues with it, alsa just doesn't wake back up
2009-03-19T05:55:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	i guess it's being worked on (hopefully), but check the bug list for ALSA to see if your issue is listed, and if not, make a report :-)
2009-03-19T06:01:00.000Z	LogicFan	bernz	if sound stops working, do you know how to view alsa's status?
2009-03-19T06:01:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	are you in GNOME desktop? if so, do you have a sound icon in the tray at the top (usually)?
2009-03-19T06:02:00.000Z	LogicFan	bernz	yes to both
2009-03-19T06:02:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	carefully double-click the icon itself, and you should get some options
2009-03-19T06:02:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	from that dialog, you can get to 'Preferences...' (button near bottom-right)
2009-03-19T06:03:00.000Z	LogicFan	bernz	yes, but it doesn't tell me the status of alsa itself.  the sound icon app doesn't crash when alsa dies. however, it will crash when i force a restart on alsa to get sound back with the cmd /sbin/alsa force-reload
2009-03-19T06:04:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	well, you can see ALSA-related demons like so from a shell: "ps aux | grep alsa | less"
2009-03-19T06:06:00.000Z	LogicFan	bernz	sorry, not really sure what i'm looking at with that command
2009-03-19T06:08:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	so, "ps aux" == "show all processes, i mean all, dammit", then the "pipe" ('|') sends the output to "grep alsa", which looks for lines containing "alsa", then the output of that is sent to "less", a "pager" (a program that lets you read output page by page)
2009-03-19T06:09:00.000Z	LogicFan	bernz	sorry, how do i interpret or scroll through the results?  all i'm seeing is " 5528  0.0  0.0   7480   880 pts/0    S+   19:08   0:00 grep alsa"
2009-03-19T06:09:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	ah, right, so...
2009-03-19T06:10:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	well, that tells you ALSA is running (probably)... (was that not what you were trying to determine?)
2009-03-19T06:10:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	those lines tell you the process name (rightmost), its ID (pid), how much memory it's using, etc
2009-03-19T06:11:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	"man ps" for details about those lines
2009-03-19T06:11:00.000Z	LogicFan	bernz	ok, thats good to know.  but i was hoping for something a little more like alsa's own errors.  so perhaps i could see which part of alsa stops functioning when power management kicks in
2009-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	oh... ALSA almost surely keeps a log of its victories and failures... perhaps somewhere in '/etc' or '/var/log'?
2009-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	bernz	LogicFan	in there, it might show you what's causing the problem
