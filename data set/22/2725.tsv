2009-03-27T04:30:00.000Z	puff		Does the ubuntu live CD include java support?
2009-03-27T04:30:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	yes, if you install java
2009-03-27T04:30:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	So "no".
2009-03-27T04:31:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk (or jre)
2009-03-27T04:31:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	Is the package on the CD?
2009-03-27T04:31:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	no, because its not free, but maybe openjdk is on cd
2009-03-27T04:31:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	Right, so "no".
2009-03-27T04:32:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	there is java-support, if you install it, so to answer your question if the live-cd support java, yes :)
2009-03-27T05:03:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	The answer to my question is "no, the live CD doesn't support java, but you can install java after booting, IF you have network access the ubuntu repositories."
2009-03-27T05:04:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	yes, so ubuntu live-system is supporting java .)
2009-03-27T05:05:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	Cool!
2009-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	its very nice to build an own live-cd with all the stuff is needed
2010-09-08T05:12:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	gripper
2010-09-08T05:12:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	great, i dont know the correct name anymore
2010-09-08T05:13:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	Yeah, I've found that annoying in the past.  They renamed ipodder, they leave various packages out of a release  (k3diff comes to mind), and you're left there scratching your head and trying to remember what the heck it was called.
2010-09-08T05:14:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	i dont have ubuntu here, so i cant check, maybe try apt-cache search gnome cd ripper
2010-09-08T05:14:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	it was a great program
2010-09-08T05:15:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	search on ripper comes up with ripperx.
2010-09-08T05:16:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	hm, that was not the package i mean
2010-09-08T05:17:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	ok i am sorry, i memory is very bad
2010-09-08T05:19:00.000Z	puff	iceroot	grip?
2010-09-08T05:22:00.000Z	iceroot	puff	no longer in karmic and lucid as it seams but its a great tool for ripping audio cds
