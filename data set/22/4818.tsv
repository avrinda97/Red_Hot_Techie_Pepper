2012-10-25T03:43:00.000Z	dem0n		hello everyone, i am running ubuntu as my guest os using vmware player and i wanted to setup a vnc server on ubuntu, so i installed tightvnc. Okay so i set a pass and ran the server which is running on port 5901. So i loaded my mini pc my mk802 which is on the same wifi network as my ubuntu box, and i pointed the android vnc server at my private ip address 192.168.1.12 at port 5901 and android vnc just gets stuck at the vnc handshake, does anyone have any ide
2012-10-25T03:44:00.000Z	Fishscene	dem0n	Is that the IP address of your ubuntu VM, or the physical computer?
2012-10-25T03:46:00.000Z	dem0n	Fishscene	that is the ip address of my ubuntu virtual machine, shoudl i being using the ip address of the physical computer?
2012-10-25T03:47:00.000Z	dem0n		for my machine i am using windows 7 as my host operating system and ubuntu and my guest os
2012-10-25T03:48:00.000Z	Fishscene	dem0n	As BusyBoxes said, make sure your VM network connection is set to bridged mode and not "shared" or "NAT".
2012-10-25T03:49:00.000Z	dem0n		let me check to make sure i am in bridged mode
2012-10-25T04:01:00.000Z	dem0n		okay sorry guys i had to switch from NAT to BRIDGED mode in vmware player which required me to restart linux and vmware player
2012-10-25T04:01:00.000Z	Fishscene	dem0n	That's a good start. How is it looking now?
2012-10-25T04:02:00.000Z	dem0n		okay now that i am in bridged mode i should in theory just be able to start the vnc server (tightvnc) and then plug in my private ip address in "androidvnc" with the vnc port -> 5901 and should be all set right?
2012-10-25T04:02:00.000Z	dem0n	Fishscene	i am about to try it out...
2012-10-25T04:02:00.000Z	Fishscene	dem0n	If it doesn't work, report back and we'll look more into your setup.
2012-10-25T04:05:00.000Z	dem0n		192.168.1.13
2012-10-25T04:05:00.000Z	dem0n		hey guys what would be the correct way to start vncserver with a good resolution and 24bps color setting
2012-10-25T04:06:00.000Z	Fishscene	dem0n	Your previous IP address was 192.168.1.13... Could you double-check that the network settings are correct? Unless of course, your NAT connection was using the same IP address range as your LAN..
2012-10-25T04:07:00.000Z	dem0n	Fishscene	i actually typed the wrong when i first connected it was actually 192.168.8.63 this is what is was before i used "bridged connection"
2012-10-25T04:08:00.000Z	Fishscene		brb. sorry
2012-10-25T04:09:00.000Z	dem0n		okay i just pinged my linux box from my windows box and it looks good
2012-10-25T04:09:00.000Z	dem0n		0% packet loss
2012-10-25T04:13:00.000Z	dem0n		okay well it worked!
2012-10-25T04:13:00.000Z	dem0n		i see my linux resolution, but one thing i need to find a better screen resolution size, i didn't put one in i just ran "vncserver"
2012-10-25T04:14:00.000Z	dem0n		my tv is a 50" does anyonen have any guesses what would be a good resolution size for the vncserver on that size of a tv?
2012-10-25T04:18:00.000Z	dem0n	Fishscene	hey thanks for your help bro, i really appreciate it
