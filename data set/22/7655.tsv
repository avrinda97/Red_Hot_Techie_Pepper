2006-11-22T09:01:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	fwiw, I recommend using gandi.net they play less games
2006-11-22T09:02:00.000Z	malt	Kingsqueak	they don't have .us domains there
2006-11-22T09:02:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	k
2006-11-22T09:03:00.000Z	malt	Kingsqueak	know anymore thats good?
2006-11-22T09:03:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	nah, I have just used gandi for several years and they are honest and no trouble, register.com screwed around with me hard, I finally got completely off of them
2006-11-22T09:04:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	the godaddy issues I've heard about have to do with the features of their domain management GUI and I've heard their service is bad if you have questions or issues
2006-11-22T09:05:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	nope
2006-11-23T10:51:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	have you looked at this yet?  http://ddclient.sourceforge.net/#help
2006-11-23T10:52:00.000Z	malt	Kingsqueak	isn't this insecure for the domain for it to save a password in the config for a server
2006-11-23T10:52:00.000Z	malt	Kingsqueak	it use any encryption?
2006-11-23T10:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	you should chown the file 600 for the user that runs the process
2006-11-23T10:53:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	that way other users can't read it
2006-11-27T13:21:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	if it's just for one machine to see, add it to /etc/hosts, otherwise you need BIND/named installed and that's a bit of work to figure out
2006-11-27T13:22:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	syntax is    <IP address>   name.you.want.to.call.it
2006-11-27T13:22:00.000Z	malt	Kingsqueak	will this save?
2006-11-27T13:22:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	yes it stays
2006-11-27T13:23:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	you make the /etc/hosts entry on the machine you are connecting with, not the one you are connecting to, you are basically fooling your local machine to believe the name for the IP you setup there
2006-11-27T13:44:00.000Z	malt	Kingsqueak	you got cpanel on your site?
2006-11-27T13:44:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	heh I've told you a few times in /msg, no...my hosting provider has it but I never installed it
2006-11-27T13:45:00.000Z	malt	Kingsqueak	sorry i havent got no messages from you
2006-11-27T13:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	malt	the channel may be doing some weird blocking or something
