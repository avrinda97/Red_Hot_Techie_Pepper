2011-03-30T01:52:00.000Z	pyghassen		error: unknown file system
2011-03-30T01:52:00.000Z	pyghassen		grub rescue>
2011-03-30T01:53:00.000Z	pyghassen		how to fix it?
2011-03-30T01:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	boot into a livecd and do sanity checks on the hard disk and partitions
2011-03-30T01:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	check that all the partitions are still there then verify them... you can do both things with gparted
2011-03-30T01:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	System>Admin..>partition editor
2011-03-30T01:55:00.000Z	pyghassen	erUSUL	I opened gpared and the system partition is black and I couldn't anything !
2011-03-30T01:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	black?
2011-03-30T01:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	you could not right click on it? choose verify ?
2011-03-30T02:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	try with command line tools? e2fsck
2011-03-30T02:04:00.000Z	pyghassen	erUSUL	without any option?
2011-03-30T02:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	no of course ... try first with « sudo e2fsck /dev/sdxx »
2011-03-30T02:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	where xx are replaced with the letter and number that you have
2011-03-30T02:06:00.000Z	pyghassen	erUSUL	I think it's working he's fixing it
2011-03-30T02:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	good luck
2011-03-30T02:10:00.000Z	pyghassen	erUSUL	I reboot and it still the same , I'll try one more time
2011-03-30T02:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	add -p to e2fsck options
2011-03-30T02:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	pyghassen	there were a lot of errors?
2011-03-30T02:11:00.000Z	pyghassen	erUSUL	yeah
2011-03-30T02:19:00.000Z	pyghassen	erUSUL	yessssssssssss it's back, last time I just e2fck only without opening gparted and check, no it's ok thanks, and god bless ubuntu and its community :)
