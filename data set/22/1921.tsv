2009-11-24T07:39:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	did you turn off compiz to try it?
2009-11-24T07:40:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	is compiz turned on my default?  i haven't messed with it since a fresh 9.10 install
2009-11-24T07:41:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	yes, System Preferences, Appearance, visual effects----- none
2009-11-24T07:42:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	ok i turned it off, I still get
2009-11-24T07:43:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	with ati gfx, you may need a reboot,,, ati=sux
2009-11-24T07:45:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	why you using xrandr? have you updated the install #1, #2, are u using the restricted drivers in "Hardware Drivers"???
2009-11-24T07:46:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	and plz dont tell me you downloaded the drivers from nvidia and using those
2009-11-24T07:48:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	no i downloaded the one from apt and no drivers show up on hardware drivers but display settings makes me use nvidia x server settings.  I restarted after installing the driver.  I'm trying xrandr so I don't have to keep restarting my computer to try different resolutions
2009-11-24T07:50:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	ok,,, you jumped the gun then,,, after you update you' should see them in System>Administration> Hardware Drivers 185(recommended)
2009-11-24T07:51:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	right -- i've seen this before but for some reason I don't now.  I recentlly uninstall everything nvidia before installing it again.. now even after installing it I don't see it.
2009-11-24T07:51:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	xorg.0.log shows that nvidia driver is being loaded tho
2009-11-24T07:52:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	i sec, i have new install of 9.10 also, letme look a sec... (i'm beginning to hate 9.10)
2009-11-24T07:54:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-11-24T07:55:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	big download.. i'll try it out -- i know i've seen that package before from the 8.x days
2009-11-24T07:58:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	yeah,,, i'm beginning to get tired of things just changing,,, i've devoted a section of my website for tutorials on doing various things in Ubuntu,,, i'm getting tired of having to write new ones with every release,,, gonna just stick to LTSs from here out
2009-11-24T07:59:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	I'm tempted to reinstall 8.04/10 because they are the last versions that i don't recall having any video problems with.. i love linux but the video driver problems really suck
2009-11-24T08:00:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	thanks for the suggestion.. i just hope this package helps
2009-11-24T08:03:00.000Z	josh0x1	SeaPhor	ok it's installed.. i suppose the thing to do now is restart
2009-11-24T08:03:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	unfortunatetely but you can just restart x...
2009-11-24T08:04:00.000Z	SeaPhor	josh0x1	and see my pm
