2004-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	can you run gcc?
2004-10-24T16:20:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	just "gcc" or "sudo gcc" returns command not found
2004-10-26T16:56:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	http://www.arslinux.com/~jorge/sources.list he has a java repository.
2004-10-26T16:58:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	is that for amd64 as well?
2004-10-26T16:58:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	probably not
2004-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	what about the realplayer 10 installer?
2004-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	you don't need an RPM.
2004-10-26T05:13:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	oh I didnt see the bin
2004-10-26T05:13:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	run it as root, and install to /opt/RealPlayer
2004-10-26T05:48:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	berfore I reboot, trying to install my realplayer10.bin, I just do a ./realplayer10.bin right?
2004-10-26T05:49:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	chmod 755 realplayer10.bin 
2004-10-26T05:50:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	install it in /opt/ ?
2004-10-26T05:50:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	that's a safe place to put it.
2004-10-26T05:51:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	so just /opt/realplayer ok?
2004-10-26T05:51:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	no.
2004-10-26T05:52:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	The installer will ask you to put links to /usr/local/bin/ answer yes, and then give it the directory of your mozilla installation. and you are done.
2004-10-26T05:52:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	its asking: Enter the complete path to the directory where you want
2004-10-26T05:53:00.000Z	wm_eddie	swim	/opt/RealPlayer/
2004-10-26T06:04:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	damn get this error when running realplay: /opt/RealPlayer/realplay.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2004-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	swim	wm_eddie	umm in synaptic I only list libgdk-imlib-ruby1.6 , libgdk-pixbuf-dev , and other libgdk-pixbuf- stuff
