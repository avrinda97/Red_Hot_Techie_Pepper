2009-02-23T20:45:00.000Z	nasso		i have a question about linux security that should be pretty easy to answer :)
2009-02-23T20:46:00.000Z	nasso		if i want to give a group named mods write-permission on a file, a group called users read permissions and everyone else no permissions, is that possible?
2009-02-23T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	uhm... no
2009-02-23T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	not by just using the standard unix access flags anyway
2009-02-23T20:47:00.000Z	nasso	LjL	not?
2009-02-23T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	you could probably do it using access lists, i guess
2009-02-23T20:48:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	a starting point would be "man setfacl"
2009-02-23T20:49:00.000Z	nasso		okay. thanks for the help
2009-02-23T20:49:00.000Z	nasso		sounds like a simple problem but i guess it wasnt ;)
2009-02-23T20:50:00.000Z	nasso		true that :)
2009-02-23T20:54:00.000Z	nasso		okay
2009-02-23T20:55:00.000Z	nasso		im writing an essay about linux security. the philosophy and basics is very simple but its maybe too simple some time :)
2009-02-23T20:55:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	well, the typical basic user/group/others access scheme of unix is simple but not *all* that flexible
2009-02-23T20:56:00.000Z	nasso	LjL	yeah. giving a user the permission to shutdown a computer in linux is not all that easy. windows security is a little bit easier that way
2009-02-23T20:56:00.000Z	nasso		but i love the simplicity
2009-02-23T20:57:00.000Z	nasso		sudo is a great tool though
2009-02-23T20:58:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	well Windows security is much more complicated though, although the GUI tools may sometimes make it simpler to actually use... roughly, you could say that when you enable ACLs on Linux you get something quite similar to the Windows scheme
2009-02-23T20:59:00.000Z	nasso	LjL	okay. you have to recompile the kernel to activate ACL?
2009-02-23T20:59:00.000Z	nasso		i guess its built into the kernel?
2009-02-23T21:00:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	no, in ubuntu at least you just install the acl package
2009-02-23T21:00:00.000Z	LjL	nasso	i think the kernel level mechanisms are enabled by default in most distributions' kernels nowadays
2009-02-23T21:06:00.000Z	nasso	LjL	are you an linux security expert? im working on a fun project in school that involves alot of linux security
