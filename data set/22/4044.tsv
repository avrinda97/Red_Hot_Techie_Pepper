2009-07-06T16:03:00.000Z	shift_		how do I allow a user to startx?
2009-07-06T16:03:00.000Z	shift_		(to avoid using root)
2009-07-06T16:04:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	normal users should already have access to startx
2009-07-06T16:04:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	X: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting.
2009-07-06T16:04:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	then something has gone amiss, I am running jaunty and the default for startx is 755
2009-07-06T16:05:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	I think the user needs to be in some group or something
2009-07-06T16:05:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	nope....those permissions give execute to the world
2009-07-06T16:05:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	I can execute the file fine... it's just that it refuses to run X, giving the error message I pasted below.
2009-07-06T16:06:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	odd. I haven't done it in years, but it should be ok to set up the system to boot to the login prompt and not run X unless requested by the user. I used to run my servers that way
2009-07-06T16:07:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	yeah, that's the idea here... people seem to be suggesting sudo, but I would much rather avoid it.
2009-07-06T16:08:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	I would want to avoid that also. Check further into the issue as you should be able to do what you want
2009-07-06T16:09:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	http://kerneltrap.org/node/2200
2009-07-06T16:10:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	sudo dpkg-reconfigure x11-common
2009-07-06T16:10:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	think it will work now.
2009-07-06T16:10:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	according to that link (an old thread) it might be a path issue
2009-07-06T16:11:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	all fixed. thanks.
2009-07-06T16:11:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	just had to run the command and select 'anybody' as the user.
2009-07-06T16:12:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	thanks...have added that to my helpfiles
2009-07-06T16:12:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	your help files? O_o
2009-07-06T16:13:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	I have an entire directory of little four line notes on how to fix things
2009-07-06T16:13:00.000Z	th0r	shift_	219 items including subdirectories
2009-07-06T16:14:00.000Z	shift_	th0r	nice
