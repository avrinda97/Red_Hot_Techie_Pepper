2011-03-03T14:48:00.000Z	jrn		i still need help on compiling and installing a program under ubunutu
2011-03-03T14:48:00.000Z	jrn		I'm sure here is someone who can help me
2011-03-03T14:49:00.000Z	jrn		imagemagick
2011-03-03T14:49:00.000Z	jrn		i downloaded the source, extracted it, ./configure, make, make install
2011-03-03T14:49:00.000Z	jrn		but convert -version still brings the old one
2011-03-03T14:50:00.000Z	jrn		what step did I miss?
2011-03-03T14:51:00.000Z	jrn		yep, the steps i listed above
2011-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	why don't you install the official version from repo?
2011-03-03T14:53:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	what have the official imagemagick web version, that the the repo version doesn't have?
2011-03-03T14:54:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	but there are some new features? the "old" version does not work?
2011-03-03T14:56:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	perhaps you should look for the options available on the ./configure step
2011-03-03T14:56:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	for example, i use to use ffmpeg compiled from svn sources
2011-03-03T14:58:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	perhaps in the help files there are not any options listed
2011-03-03T14:59:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	but i have just searched the imagemagick web, and look at the following link http://www.imagemagick.org/script/advanced-unix-installation.php
2011-03-03T14:59:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	there are many options available
2011-03-03T15:00:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	yes, but as ffmpeg, by default, there are some featured disabled by default
2011-03-03T15:00:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	you if you want to have them, you have to recompile with the correct options enabled
2011-03-03T15:21:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	did you find something in the link y pasted before?
2011-03-03T15:40:00.000Z	jrn	iqpi	looks like it's the 64bit version, that's what I found in the configure options...
2011-03-03T15:43:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	you could try to install the precompiled binary offered in the imagemagick web
2011-03-03T15:43:00.000Z	jrn	iqpi	ok I'll do so
2011-03-03T15:47:00.000Z	iqpi	jrn	i agree with MichaelDobrovits unistall first the previous release of imagemagick you have installed, purge all its components, and then try to reinstall it from sources, if it fails again, then try (first unistall again) to install the binary package ofered in their web but they are rpm files, you can convert them to deb using the program alien, to see how aliens works, type man alien, but you have to install it first, of course
