2006-03-26T06:19:00.000Z	ddg2_bluesky	brenner	here is the link http://pastebin.com/613486
2006-03-26T06:21:00.000Z	ddg2_bluesky	brenner	did you receive the link ok?
2006-03-26T06:22:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	yes.  it looks ok.  let's just run the reconfig anyway.
2006-03-26T06:22:00.000Z	ddg2_bluesky	brenner	ok how do we run the reconfig?
2006-03-26T06:22:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	message me
2006-03-26T06:25:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	you need to run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  go through it, selecting defaults if you are unsure of an option by just pressing enter.  it will create a backup file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.<randomnumber> so you need to know how to copy it over the newly generated xorg.conf
2006-03-26T06:26:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	... if you can't start gnome
2006-03-26T06:28:00.000Z	ddg2_bluesky	brenner	do you want me to run that command?
2006-03-26T06:28:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	yeah, sorry.  here's the steps: [1]  run the reconfig w/ that command [2]  restart x server w/ ctrl+alt+backspace (login and type 'startx' if needed)
2006-03-26T06:29:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	if that faile, THEN you need to revert to the original xorg.conf that will be saved as /etc/X11/xorg.conf<radomnumber> by the tool
2006-03-26T06:29:00.000Z	ddg2_bluesky	brenner	how is this going to help the mouse issue?
2006-03-26T06:29:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	and then you should be able to start gnome again with a 'startx'
2006-03-26T06:31:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	i don't know if it will.  but it sounds like a display issue and reconfigging reconfigs the disaply
2006-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	ddg2_bluesky	brenner	autodetect video hardware?
2006-03-26T06:32:00.000Z	brenner	ddg2_bluesky	if you're unsure, just press enter to choose default
