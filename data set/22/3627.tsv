2008-07-17T10:57:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	Do something like $ sh name.bin   ... anyway, what is it?
2008-07-17T10:58:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	it is the installer for planeshift is that bad?
2008-07-17T10:58:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	I think it is safe :) only do $ sh name.bin
2008-07-17T11:00:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	it tells me command not found
2008-07-17T11:01:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	weird, try only $ sh

2008-07-17T11:02:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	weird.... well, change perms of the file ( $ chmod a+x name.bin) and then try typing $ sh name.bin
2008-07-17T11:04:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	well i am still missing something from the line cause it is still telling me not found
2008-07-17T11:04:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	You changed file perms right ?
2008-07-17T11:04:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	with $ chmod a+x
2008-07-17T11:05:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	all i put was "chmod name.bin
2008-07-17T11:06:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	for change it perms you have to type a+x... chmod a+x filename.bin  ... remember, replace filename.bin with the name of the bin you're triying to run :)
2008-07-17T11:07:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	yeah i havent been puting "filename" there this whole time bro and i got it i was leaving out the +x in the middle like i said i have done this much before i knew the grphics card didnt work
2008-07-17T11:08:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	ok, it was just for be sure... you're sure $ sh give you an error? Try with $ /bin/sh filename.bin   :)
2008-07-17T11:09:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	yeah i typed "$ sh filename.bin" and got error so i will do you new command and see if that one works
2008-07-17T11:09:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	ok
2008-07-17T11:11:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	nope $ /bin/sh filename.bin does not work either says "command not found"
2008-07-17T11:13:00.000Z	kcman	debCarlos	well it is installed i got it to by doing chmod +x filename.bin, the next line doing ./filename.bin and it ran throught just fine and i am up and running thanks for your help bro
2008-07-17T11:14:00.000Z	debCarlos	kcman	yeah... but sh should have to be installed in your system :)
