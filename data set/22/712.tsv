2011-07-22T23:46:00.000Z	alex--	wols	http://pastebin.com/Gbguecn3
2011-07-24T14:52:00.000Z	wols	alex--	no
2011-07-24T14:53:00.000Z	wols	alex--	and you cannot do it either unless you broke something
2011-07-24T14:53:00.000Z	alex--	wols	shift > GRUB > root > passwd root > enter new password                is that breaking something?
2011-07-24T14:54:00.000Z	wols	alex--	grub?
2011-07-24T14:54:00.000Z	alex--	wols	yes
2011-07-24T14:55:00.000Z	wols	alex--	if I press "shift", nothing happens. you need to give more info what you are doing
2011-07-24T14:56:00.000Z	wols	alex--	there is nothing to recover. and when you are in grub then there is no usermanagement, no root, no normal user, nothing
2011-07-24T14:58:00.000Z	wols	alex--	short answer: if you enable the root password, fine. but don't except any help then. ubuntu uses sudo and sudo only. there is no root account to use

2011-07-24T14:59:00.000Z	wols	alex--	wrong. man sudo
2011-07-24T15:00:00.000Z	wols	alex--	you'd have to edit system files manually. and if you screw up you screw up your system...
2011-07-24T15:02:00.000Z	alex--	wols	ok then i will change it to another password and forget it =D
