2008-06-11T04:33:00.000Z	un_dave		morning all. or whatever greeting is relevant to your time of day :)
2008-06-11T04:35:00.000Z	un_dave		i have a simple one for someone out there, i'm installing azureus, and need to copy the extracted files to a permenant place to live. Where is the proper place to put them?
2008-06-11T04:35:00.000Z	un_dave		I was looking in /user/bin, but that just looks like shortcuts to programs
2008-06-11T04:36:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: do you install azureus from synaptic
2008-06-11T04:37:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	nope. i want to use the latest, so have the current version from sourceforge
2008-06-11T04:37:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	hence the issue. it doesnt install, it's just a jar file in a directory
2008-06-11T04:38:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	it runs fine as it is, but i just want to file it in the appropriate spot
2008-06-11T04:39:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: If you installed it it is on the right spot allready
2008-06-11T04:40:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	looking at the shell script for firefox in /usr/bin, it looks like the firefox system files are stored in /usr/lib. wouldnt that be a better spot for it?
2008-06-11T04:40:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	sorry for the confusion. i didnt install it, i just unzipped it on the desktop to see if it worked.
2008-06-11T04:41:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: you downloaded  tar.bz2 file didn´t you
2008-06-11T04:41:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	i did, indeed.
2008-06-11T04:42:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: so I believe you have to compile it look for read me file in uncompresed folder
2008-06-11T04:42:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: and install file
2008-06-11T04:43:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	nope. it's a java app, so all of that is taken care of. it runs straight from the jar, and doesnt require installation... thanks to the wonders of java
2008-06-11T04:43:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: what files saying to you
2008-06-11T04:44:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	i'm not getting any errors, it all runs fine where it is. i just want to know where i should put the directory... it's not much good leaving it running from a folder on my desktop
2008-06-11T04:44:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: you can not run azureus without java I know that but do you have java installed
2008-06-11T04:48:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	sorry zvacet, i'm confusing you. there's nothing wrong with azureus, i have java installed, and it runs fine. the issue is where i should be putting 'program files' for ubuntu. I dont want the azureus folder just sitting on my desktop, i'd prefer to put it in the 'correct' location.
2008-06-11T04:49:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: you can put it in your home folder  but if azureus is installed it knows where to go I supose it is /usr/bin
2008-06-11T04:50:00.000Z	un_dave	zvacet	ok, thanks anyway
2008-06-11T04:51:00.000Z	zvacet	un_dave	: np you don´t have to worry everything looking good
