2006-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	LeeHarvey	xd45	putting your /home elsewhere will let you re-install or repair installs without losing your desktop and user preferences.
2006-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	xd45	LeeHarvey	I se maybe that is what I should do
2006-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	xd45	LeeHarvey	I have never partitioned other than using the defaults
2006-11-12T10:11:00.000Z	xd45	LeeHarvey	how would you suggest splitting up a 60 gb hd?
2006-11-12T10:11:00.000Z	LeeHarvey	xd45	personal preference really.
