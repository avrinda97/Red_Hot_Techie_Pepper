2005-03-05T17:04:00.000Z	WW		Can anyone help me to get gFTP working?  sftp works fine in the command line, but I'd like to get this gui working.
2005-03-05T17:06:00.000Z	garfield	WW	when you say command line do you mean scp?
2005-03-05T17:08:00.000Z	WW	garfield	Nope, sftp.  I suspect it uses ssh, but the command is called sftp.
2005-03-05T17:09:00.000Z	garfield	WW	which error do you get in gFTP?
2005-03-05T17:11:00.000Z	garfield	WW	btw you can just use nautilus for sftp
2005-03-05T17:12:00.000Z	WW	garfield	If I try to use the SSH2 protocol, I get "Opening SSH connection to ..." and then "Running program ssh -e none ... <more stuff>...", and then it just sits there and never connects.
2005-03-05T17:12:00.000Z	garfield	WW	either File->Connect to server and select SSH or just use ssh://user@site or sftp://user@site
2005-03-05T17:12:00.000Z	garfield		but that's for nautilus of course
2005-03-05T17:15:00.000Z	WW	garfield	Strange that gFTP is not cooperating.  I'll take a look at nautilus.
2005-03-05T17:16:00.000Z	WW	garfield	In the "Connect to Server" window in nautilus, what is it asking for in the "Folder" and "Name to use for connection" fields?
2005-03-05T17:18:00.000Z	garfield	WW	gFTP kind of suck, but I believe you can fix if you really want with another path in FTP->Settings->SSH->SSH2 server path
2005-03-05T17:19:00.000Z	garfield	WW	it depends on where sftp-server is located on the server, on Gentoo it is /usr/lib/misc/
2005-03-05T17:20:00.000Z	WW	garfield	Hmmm... why does sftp "just work" from the command line, I wonder?
2005-03-05T17:20:00.000Z	garfield		uses another path or something I guess
2005-03-05T17:21:00.000Z	WW	garfield	I sort of assume it uses a sane set of defaults.
2005-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	garfield	WW	I can't really figure why either
2005-03-05T17:23:00.000Z	WW		Anyone know of a gui ftp app that actual works in warty?   :)
2005-03-05T17:24:00.000Z	garfield	WW	maybe it is just us who's stupid I don't know... btw, try checking FTP->Settings->SSH->Use SSH2 subsystem and just blank the path set before
2005-03-05T17:24:00.000Z	WW	garfield	I may not not the correct settings, but that doesn't mean I'm stupid! :)
2005-03-05T17:27:00.000Z	WW	garfield	It worked!  I set the "Use SSH2 SFTP subsys" at you suggested, and finally got it to connect.
2005-03-05T17:27:00.000Z	WW	garfield	Thanks!
2005-03-05T17:27:00.000Z	garfield	WW	:)
