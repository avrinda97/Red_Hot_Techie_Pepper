2006-01-26T17:25:00.000Z	Storkme		!java
2006-01-26T17:26:00.000Z	Storkme		!javadebs
2006-01-26T17:27:00.000Z	Storkme		so, i installed java manually, without using debian packages. how would i use the link tool ('ln') to configure it?
2006-01-26T17:29:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	under dir /usr/bin you will find symbolic links to java and javaw. make them point to where ever you have your java libs
2006-01-26T17:29:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	but does is that just for the commands 'java' and 'javaw' or for all the commands java has?
2006-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	i only needed it for java and javaws. running jre
2006-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	what about compiling?
2006-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	so just directed them with symbolic links to their counter parts under the lib files
2006-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	fair enough :)
2006-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	i did not install the jsdk
2006-01-26T17:34:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	if you run into procblems compiling it would be also helpfull if you adjust you included the java lib in your path
2006-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	 the links are essential. for they already point to somewhere else. This is an addition. you can set that if you run programs through a terminal in your .baschrc file
2006-01-26T17:36:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	can't i just remove the current links for java, and just add the new jdk folder to the bash file?
2006-01-26T17:37:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	you have to point to the dir. with the specific file. too many. you can try it though but i do not recommend it
2006-01-26T17:38:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	how would i do that?
2006-01-26T17:41:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	see also this link it has example so as your .bashrc file http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=117680&highlight=bashrc
2006-01-26T17:47:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	wouldn't it be easier to just add it to the path?
2006-01-26T17:47:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	like i would in windows
2006-01-26T17:48:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	as i said you might try it if you want
2006-01-26T06:31:00.000Z	Storkme	ilba7r	i'm on amd64, it keeps giving me a wierd error
2006-01-26T06:33:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	did you try the forums
2006-01-26T06:36:00.000Z	ilba7r	Storkme	try this link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JavaAMD64
