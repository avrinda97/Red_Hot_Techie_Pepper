2012-11-14T09:14:00.000Z	drakon1		hello, I have a video in an iso image, how can i see it on my pc?
2012-11-14T09:16:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	The standard archive viewer can open and extract .iso files, is the ISO file an image of a DVD?
2012-11-14T09:16:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	yes, I managed to mount it but it appears empty
2012-11-14T09:17:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	it is a dvd
2012-11-14T09:18:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	VLC is the easiest because you can just click "Media" "Play Disc" and change /dev/dvd to the folder where the ISO is mounted.
2012-11-14T09:18:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	ok, i'll try that, thanks!
2012-11-14T09:18:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	np
2012-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	didn't work
2012-11-14T09:21:00.000Z	drakon1		got an error message that just says it can't open it
2012-11-14T09:21:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	Unmount the image,and try re-mounting it, if you used the built-in Ubuntu image mounter, it probably gave you this really weird, cryptic mount location that VLC sometimes doesn't like.
2012-11-14T09:21:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	You can make a custom mount point with: sudo mkdir /mnt/iso
2012-11-14T09:22:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	ok, i'll try that
2012-11-14T09:22:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	Then mount the image with: mount -o loop -t iso9660 FOO.iso /mnt/test
2012-11-14T09:22:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	just replace FOO.iso with the actual name of the iso
2012-11-14T09:23:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	Oh and stick sudo in front of the mount command, you gotta be root to mount stuff.
2012-11-14T09:27:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	i did it, i have the new directory but again it appears empty
2012-11-14T09:27:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	Was the DVD an encrypted DVD, like one you bought from Wal-Mart?  If so, do you have libdvdcss2 installed?
2012-11-14T09:28:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	i dont know, i downloaded it
2012-11-14T09:28:00.000Z	Gerowen	drakon1	Ah, then the image may be corrupted or bad.  You could try re-downloading it, or making an image of one of your own DVDs and mounting that just to make sure your method is working.
2012-11-14T09:29:00.000Z	drakon1	Gerowen	ok, thanks a lot for your help
2012-11-14T09:29:00.000Z	drakon1		:-)
