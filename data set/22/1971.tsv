2009-11-05T06:23:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger		i have tries ndiswrapper and it says hardware not found and when i tried to activate propiety drivers the ubunut just stays at the downloading and installing phase, i have to hold power to return to normal.
2009-11-05T06:24:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger		so i take it my problem has no fix then, linux just isnt ready it seems.
2009-11-05T06:24:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	what do see when you try sudo dhclient?
2009-11-05T06:25:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	I see no leases in database, sleeping.
2009-11-05T06:26:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	sudo ifconfig
2009-11-05T06:27:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	btw i have gone through this routine with other users on here when i was connected to the lan.
2009-11-05T06:28:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	for ifconfig i see eth0, eth0avahi, lo, wlan0 and wlan0avahi
2009-11-05T06:28:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	so you're not getting an ip?
2009-11-05T06:28:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	only avahi, lo have inet and ips
2009-11-05T06:29:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	hooking up to a router or directly to cable modem?
2009-11-05T06:29:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	right now, im not hooked to anything but i did this all before when connected and the result is the same.
2009-11-05T06:31:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	if it is a driver problem ...you looked at the broadcom website and no driver?
2009-11-05T06:32:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	i have, i downloaded a driver and installed but it doesnt work, lan doesnt work either. i even installed the ndiswrapper and that doesnt do it either.
2009-11-05T06:33:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	and there was nothing in dmesg?
2009-11-05T06:33:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	apparantly with 9.10 (what i have) propietry drivers are part of the cd and i can activate them, but when i try it just hangs on the downloading stage. Im really lost.
2009-11-05T06:33:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	dmesg?
2009-11-05T06:35:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	dmesg will output system messages .. so when you try to do something and something isn't working it's a good place to look .. gnu/linux is nothing if not verbose .. :-)
2009-11-05T06:35:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	im a beginner :(
2009-11-05T06:36:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	we all are ... :-)
2009-11-05T06:36:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Kuriouz	yeah.
2009-11-05T06:37:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	I disagree on that part ... i like the control ..
2009-11-05T06:38:00.000Z	Kuriouz	TonyTheTiger	i have Dell mini 9 and install Ubuntu Netbook Remix .. worked withtout a problem ...
