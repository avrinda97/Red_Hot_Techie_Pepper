2005-11-21T15:40:00.000Z	zxsykco		That is lspci -v.
2005-11-21T15:41:00.000Z	zxsykco		It is the same but simpler, one second.
2005-11-21T15:43:00.000Z	zxsykco		So my machine is f*ckued up then? Why the hell else would lspci give me funny numbers?
2005-11-21T15:43:00.000Z	zxsykco		5.10 breezy badger.
2005-11-21T15:45:00.000Z	zxsykco		So I should stop trusting the people who've introduced me to linux and linux for that matter and go back to windows development?
2005-11-21T15:45:00.000Z	zxsykco		Why else would this occur?
2005-11-21T15:45:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	Why would you do that?
2005-11-21T15:46:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	What is unclear about 'lspci'?
2005-11-21T15:47:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	So what - if anything - is wrong with that lspci?
2005-11-21T15:48:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	HELLO?
2005-11-21T15:49:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	So what - if anything - is wrong with that lspci output?
2005-11-21T15:50:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	Normally you just leave the bus id blank and X is fine.
2005-11-21T15:52:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	Well, you're ignoring the prople who are trying to help and instead say you want windows.
2005-11-21T15:52:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	I asked you twice to just leave it blank and try X.
2005-11-21T15:53:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	So will you do that or tell me outright you won't?
2005-11-21T15:54:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	Can you try X without giving it a busid?
2005-11-21T15:54:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	If you have already tried that to bo avail, telling us would be sueful.
2005-11-21T15:55:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	Ok, I give up.
2005-11-21T15:55:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	Ok, so leaving it blank didn't work?
2005-11-21T15:56:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	Ok, so leaving it blank didn't work?
2005-11-21T15:56:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	yes or No.
2005-11-21T15:58:00.000Z	cafuego	zxsykco	If you don't WANT help, don't ASK for it.
