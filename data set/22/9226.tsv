2005-09-23T07:25:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	why don't you just use a Terminal?
2005-09-23T07:26:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	I use but I define myself as so called 'power user'
2005-09-23T07:27:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	anyway I thought that there is some way to remove file from nautilus using some gtksudo or ssh thing...
2005-09-23T07:27:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	I need to test ssh maybe
2005-09-23T07:27:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	ssh?!?!?
2005-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	heh it works - ctrl+l ssh://localhost
2005-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	and this is helping exactly how?
2005-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	heh not yet
2005-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	still cannot remove this file....
2005-09-23T07:30:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	propably I need to ssh as root
2005-09-23T07:30:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	why the hell would you want to do that?!?
2005-09-23T07:30:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	log in remotely just to become root?
2005-09-23T07:31:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	know better way?
2005-09-23T07:31:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	yes, use a terminal
2005-09-23T07:32:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	I can but my customers dont
2005-09-23T07:33:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	but is it really a good idea if your customers can manipulate files that belong to root if they can't be bothered to learn how to remove files through the terminal?
2005-09-23T07:33:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	I don't agree
2005-09-23T07:33:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	In OS X, the feature you want is present. And the world would be a lot better if it weren't there.
2005-09-23T07:34:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	for example they can manage packages with synaptic - as super users
2005-09-23T07:34:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	and they don't need to use terminal to do this
2005-09-23T07:34:00.000Z	marcin_ant	xTina	why should they to remove some file owned by someone else - if they know password?
2005-09-23T07:35:00.000Z	xTina	marcin_ant	I meant more in terms of destroying their system.
