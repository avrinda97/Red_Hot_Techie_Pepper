2012-03-06T13:42:00.000Z	hoshi411		how do i change my swap directory in ubuntu? i accidentaly made it a partition /dev/sda4 when i wanted it to be /dev/sda3/swap
2012-03-06T13:43:00.000Z	hoshi411		the partition was ext3 and now it wont mount T_T
2012-03-06T13:43:00.000Z	hoshi411		i changed my fstab to say it is ext3 but ubuntu still thinks it is a swap drive
2012-03-06T13:45:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	could you ask more clearly please?
2012-03-06T13:45:00.000Z	hoshi411	ryevision	sure: so there are two things I want to do
2012-03-06T13:46:00.000Z	hoshi411	ryevision	on thing is, when I installed ubuntu, i told it to make sda3 my / directory and sda4 my swap directory
2012-03-06T13:47:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	swap has to be a separate partition for persistance sake
2012-03-06T13:48:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	you can split your sda4 unto two parts, one of which will be now used as swap
2012-03-06T13:48:00.000Z	hoshi411	ryevision	ok , so what if I want to make it a different paritition, for example sda5
2012-03-06T13:48:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	you would need to run gparted in root mode
2012-03-06T13:49:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	in /etc/fstab file, you have to edit it in root mode
2012-03-06T13:49:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	first you need to have a partition prepared
2012-03-06T13:49:00.000Z	hoshi411	ryevision	there is no other location for those settings?
2012-03-06T13:50:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	it is unlikely you have a gui for that setting
2012-03-06T13:50:00.000Z	hoshi411	ryevision	I also want to get my sda3 partition back. After telling the installer that it was my swap parititon, it no longer recognizes it or mounts it as an ext3 partition
2012-03-06T13:51:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	a partition can be mounted with a hell amount of settings, no gui could cover them all
2012-03-06T13:51:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	your sda3 now contains a swap filesystem, not an ext3 system now
2012-03-06T13:52:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	once swap was created there, it has been wiped probably
2012-03-06T13:53:00.000Z	hoshi411	ryevision	but I told the installer not to format it
2012-03-06T13:53:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	swap is not being formatted in true sense, but it still wipes out file table data and structure
2012-03-06T13:54:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	did you have vital data on that partition?
2012-03-06T13:58:00.000Z	ryevision	hoshi411	running swap on a separate partition prevents many threats
