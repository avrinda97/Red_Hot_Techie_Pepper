2008-05-14T18:43:00.000Z	crazy_bus		I have nothing downloading. But something is taking all my harddrive space really fast (you can watch it sinking lower and lower by the second) Can anyone help me find out what it is?
2008-05-14T18:44:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	logs? look in /var/log.. or use the disk usage analyzer
2008-05-14T18:46:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	which sort of logs should I be looking at there?
2008-05-14T18:47:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	anything growing..
2008-05-14T18:47:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	it's the only think I know of that just keeps increasing in size
2008-05-14T18:47:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	my logs and system files are on a separate partition
2008-05-14T18:48:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	which partition is slowly growing out of free space then?
2008-05-14T18:48:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	/home and not slowly either, way faster than my internet
2008-05-14T18:49:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	hmm.. any special folder? use the disk usage analyzer and tell it to scan your home folder
2008-05-14T18:58:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	ok I've got a 5.4gb .xsession-errors  It would grow bigger but the drive is now full
2008-05-14T18:59:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	hmm.. something wrong then... are those files just the same line over and over?
2008-05-14T19:01:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	still trying to load it and find out
2008-05-14T19:02:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	perhaps just checking the syslog might do it (tail /var/log/syslog)
2008-05-14T19:02:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	not much activity there
2008-05-14T19:03:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	hmm.. odd.. try it on the big xsession error file then
2008-05-14T19:04:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	got lots of these: QObject: 17 timers now exist for object QObject::unnamed
2008-05-14T19:06:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	tried googling for that.. almost no hits..
2008-05-14T19:07:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	try shutting stuff down.. see if you can find whatever is causing this.. or see if it's using a lot cpu time.. (use top or something)
2008-05-14T19:08:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	already tried that and nothing is sticking out
2008-05-14T19:18:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	rebooting to see if that fixes it
2008-05-14T19:29:00.000Z	crazy_bus	Slart	after I deleted the file and a reboot it all works now
2008-05-14T19:30:00.000Z	Slart	crazy_bus	hmm.. well.. guess we'll never know what went wrong in the first place.. nice to hear it fixed itself though =)
