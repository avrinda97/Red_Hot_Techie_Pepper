2007-06-24T08:08:00.000Z	magnethead		anybody know how I can add a 1280x1024 resolution in ubuntu so my 19" flatpanel will quit screaming at me that it's out of native resolution? im stuck at 1024x768
2007-06-24T08:09:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	you can add it by editing "/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-06-24T08:09:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-06-24T08:11:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	you really should not use the root user account for things like that
2007-06-24T08:11:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-06-24T08:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	exactly what are you doing with that command
2007-06-24T08:14:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	it should prompt you for a password then open the file for you
2007-06-24T08:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	capital X
2007-06-24T08:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	not for xorg.conf though
2007-06-24T08:36:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	have you tried removing the resolutions you dont want? keep in mind you may need to put them back in if it does not work
2007-06-24T08:37:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	well wont hurt to try
2007-06-24T08:42:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	I once removed the other resolutions from a friends install and it worked straight away
2007-06-24T08:43:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	no just leave 1280 x 1024
2007-06-24T08:46:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	most likely
2007-06-24T08:50:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	have you tried what I said
2007-06-24T08:51:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	about removing all other resolutions but the one you want
2007-06-24T08:51:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-06-24T08:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	so what happened after you restarted once you left 1280x1024 by itself
2007-06-24T08:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	on each bit depth
2007-06-24T08:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	what is your monitor
2007-06-24T09:00:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	model number
2007-06-24T09:04:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	magnethead	http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/lg-l1932tq-flat-panel/4505-3174_7-31951003.html is this it
