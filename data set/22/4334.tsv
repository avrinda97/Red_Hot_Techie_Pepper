2009-03-11T03:58:00.000Z	polter		well why is my /dev/sda mounted on cdrom?
2009-03-11T03:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	you can mount any block device anyplace (except in /proc)
2009-03-11T04:00:00.000Z	polter	ActionParsnip	I know
2009-03-11T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	lsof | grep /dev/sda1
2009-03-11T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	lsof | grep cdrom
2009-03-11T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	you are logged in as root (you shouldnt be) so yoou dont need sudo
2009-03-11T04:04:00.000Z	polter	ActionParsnip	I logged in as root because I don't really enjoy sudo
2009-03-11T04:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	why you are logged in as root iis anyones guess. its unnecessary and unneeded
2009-03-11T04:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	it has seriously crippled your security
2009-03-11T04:04:00.000Z	polter	ActionParsnip	I know about root and security issues
2009-03-11T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	if you are logged in as root you dont need to use sudo
2009-03-11T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	well if you logged in as root and launched an irc client, you clearly dont
2009-03-11T04:05:00.000Z	polter	ActionParsnip	I'm not logged in as root in GDM
2009-03-11T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	you shouldnt use sudo su either
2009-03-11T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	sudo -i   sets up the environment correctly
2009-03-11T04:06:00.000Z	polter	ActionParsnip	ok, now about my problem.. there's nothing weird in fstab as far as I can see
2009-03-11T04:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	the fact that you ae running commands with sudo as root implies you are ignorant of what root and sudo actually are
2009-03-11T04:07:00.000Z	polter	ActionParsnip	I told you. I haven't yet adjusted to being on Ubuntu again after running suse for a long while.
2009-03-11T04:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	fine but if your system gets hacked / broken..you were warned. There is a billion reasons why root is disabled and sudo is used in ubuntu
2009-03-11T04:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	any way
2009-03-11T04:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	polter	lsof will show all open files and apps on all partitions
