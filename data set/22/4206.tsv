2009-09-25T21:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> try iwconfig wlan0
2009-09-25T21:24:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	n8tuser	that doesn't seem to enable it either. I also get this in dmesg, if it helps:
2009-09-25T21:27:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	n8tuser	any other ideas please?
2009-09-25T21:27:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> what is the situation again? where is the problem?
2009-09-25T21:28:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	n8tuser	as far as i can remember, my wireless card was listed under infconfig as ath0, now it doesn't get listed anymore and i guess i accidentally pressed the wlan switch on my laptop
2009-09-25T21:29:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	n8tuser	also, i get this in dmesg: 17.601780] ath5k phy0: gain calibration timeout (2412MHz) [   17.601786] ath5k phy0: can't reset hardware (-11)
2009-09-25T21:29:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> try the command I suggested  iwconfig ath0

2009-09-25T21:31:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> your nic is wlan0 not ath0,   pastebin results of  sudo lshw -C network please

2009-09-25T21:33:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	n8tuser	it says 'DISABLED' next to the wireless interface, so I guess there's still something wrong...
2009-09-25T21:34:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> correct, try  sudo ifdown wlan0; sudo ifup wlan0

2009-09-25T21:35:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> also do not try to have both nic on same subnet unless you know how to manipulate your route tables
2009-09-25T21:36:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	n8tuser	i remember having this problem once before and as far as i can remember i had to do some commands and the restart, i just can't remember what i exactly i have to do. also, i have no clue what you mean with 'both nic on same subnet' :P
2009-09-25T21:37:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> i dont use nm or wicd, i prefer to configure /etc/network/interfaces   man interfaces for details
2009-09-25T21:37:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file
2009-09-25T21:38:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	n8tuser	yeah, i know how to configure network/interfaces, but it worked until now without me having to do that. one second, i'll paste it
2009-09-25T21:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> i dislike using nm or wicd as you see it sometimes gives you wrong info.. i prefer to control manually via interfaces file

2009-09-25T21:40:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> try to add the entry for you wifi,  use udvevinfo -e  to see which it is ath0 or wlan0
2009-09-25T21:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	EvaLuaTe	-> or ls -la /sys/class/net
