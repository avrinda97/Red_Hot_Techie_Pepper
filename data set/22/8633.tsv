2005-11-19T14:22:00.000Z	lancer285		can anyone tell me how to make lame encode a whole directory of .wav to mp3?
2005-11-19T14:23:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	how do you make it encode one file?
2005-11-19T14:23:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	lame sound.wav sound.mp3
2005-11-19T14:24:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	so:  for i in *.wav; do lame "$i" "$(echo "$i" | sed 's/.wav$/.mp3/'); done
2005-11-19T14:24:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	I missed a close quote:
2005-11-19T14:24:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	so:  for i in *.wav; do lame "$i" "$(echo "$i" | sed 's/.wav$/.mp3/')"; done
2005-11-19T14:26:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	sorry, I don't follow. I was trying lame ./*.wav *.mp3 but that didn't work.
2005-11-19T14:26:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	copy and paste:
2005-11-19T14:26:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	   for i in *.wav; do lame "$i" "$(echo "$i" | sed 's/.wav$/.mp3/')"; done
2005-11-19T14:26:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	woa, cool
2005-11-19T14:27:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	can I copy that into a #bash script and just run it??
2005-11-19T14:30:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	you can run that directly from the command line if you like
2005-11-19T14:30:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	or you can make an alias or shell function from it
2005-11-19T14:31:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	I have no idea how to do that (:
2005-11-19T14:31:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	I'll make a pastebin for it.  Would you prefer a recursive version?
2005-11-19T14:32:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	yes plz (:
2005-11-19T14:39:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	copy and paste the whole of http://pastebin.ubuntulinux.nl/4522 into your .bashrc
2005-11-19T14:40:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	then in any new shell you start, you'll be able to just type "wav2mp3" to convert wavs to mp3s recursively
2005-11-19T14:41:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	awesome! I don't need the line numbers right??
2005-11-19T14:42:00.000Z	dooglus	lancer285	no, you don't want the numbers
2005-11-19T14:42:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	that's what I thought. thanks !!
2005-11-19T14:43:00.000Z	lancer285	dooglus	this is my only option. I ripped all my cds, then my car got stolen and I lost them all. These .ogg rips are all I have now
