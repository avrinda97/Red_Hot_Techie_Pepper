2005-03-28T08:28:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	_which_ soundblaster pci card?
2005-03-28T08:29:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	I really don't know, I always used some 3rd party drivers on windows because I didn't know what kind
2005-03-28T08:29:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	It's a sound blaster audigy or something, I don't know the model
2005-03-28T08:29:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	please follow the same instructions I gave deville_75
2005-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	http://pastebin.ca/7601
2005-03-28T08:32:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	you actually have 2 cards: your onboard Intel AC97 and the Audigy
2005-03-28T08:32:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	Yeah I know; I want to use the audigy obviously
2005-03-28T08:33:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	cat /proc/asound/modules
2005-03-28T08:33:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	Can I paste those two lines in here?
2005-03-28T08:34:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	sure
2005-03-28T08:34:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	0 snd_intel8x0  1 snd_emu10k1
2005-03-28T08:36:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	ok, so what I advise you do is tell alsa that you prefer all other sound cards over the onboard Intel AC97
2005-03-28T08:36:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	are you on Hoary?
2005-03-28T08:36:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	no, not the preview release one.. the other, I haven't had a chance to download the iso's yet
2005-03-28T08:37:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	warty?
2005-03-28T08:37:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	yes thats it.
2005-03-28T08:37:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	hmm, there's a different approach for Warty
2005-03-28T08:38:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	type this in a terminal: echo "snd-emu10k1" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2005-03-28T08:38:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	snd-emu10k1
2005-03-28T08:39:00.000Z	crimsun	stephen-	excellent. Now when you next reboot, your Audigy will be the first card (card0)
2005-03-28T08:39:00.000Z	stephen-	crimsun	Thanks! :) bbiab
