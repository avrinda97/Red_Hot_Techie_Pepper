2007-12-30T00:44:00.000Z	ikonia	bluefoxx	sit it out, or get someone to mirror the packages needed onto a cd.
2007-12-30T00:45:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ikonia	how do i do that[mirroring onto a cd i mean] i have the live cd but i waned to install onto my SATA drive, which it didnt detect
2007-12-30T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bluefoxx	??? what are you talking about you said upgrade, not install
2007-12-30T00:46:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ikonia	i was going to install, but i want to upgrade instead
2007-12-30T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bluefoxx	so you need to either upgrade over the internet, or get all the packages needed for an update and make a cd out of that (but if your internet is slow you'll still have to download them all to make the cdrom)
2007-12-30T00:48:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ikonia	so how do i get them onto a cd and upgrade from that?is there a how-to website, my neighboor has a faster connection than myself
2007-12-30T00:48:00.000Z	ikonia	bluefoxx	I'm not sure on the how to, there is a factoid for it.
