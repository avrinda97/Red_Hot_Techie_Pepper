2009-07-10T01:26:00.000Z	|unjustice|		Hi, I am trying to update my friend's system. He had gutsy gibbon, so I changed his sources.list to include Hardy, and I did a full update to Hardy. Unfortunately, i could not load anythign but failsafe GNOME, but the next day I tried to load it again adn it won't. I can get into a shell, but I cannot change sources.list to intrepid to further update. Also, his system won't boot a live cd to insta
2009-07-10T01:27:00.000Z	qwyeth	|unjustice|	 if the system won't boot to the live CD to install, how did he install it in the first place?  Do it that same way again :D
2009-07-10T01:30:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	it doesn't work
2009-07-10T01:30:00.000Z	qwyeth	|unjustice|	 You already told me it doesn't work, that wasn't my question.  The question is:  How was Gutsy installed in the first place?
2009-07-10T01:31:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	via install disc
2009-07-10T01:31:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	agreed, that is not very helpful
2009-07-10T01:31:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	yes
2009-07-10T01:32:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	yes
2009-07-10T01:39:00.000Z	qwyeth	|unjustice|	 it sounds like the packages are now corrupted due to your failed attempt at upgrade... It's probably possible but it would be a lot easier for you to resolve the hardware problem and install jaunty clean
2009-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	I agree, but the cdrom is not broken, it just will not boot cds
2009-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	I tried ubuntu 32 and 64 twice, and debian 32 and 64 twice
2009-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	computer can read discs, but not boot them
2009-07-10T01:41:00.000Z	qwyeth	|unjustice|	 just because you can read CDs doesn't mean the CD drive isn't broken.
2009-07-10T01:41:00.000Z	qwyeth	|unjustice|	in fact, I just replaced 6 cd drives last week with that issue at my office
2009-07-10T01:42:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	yuck, well I think that may be the problem, is there a way to test it?
2009-07-10T01:43:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	the first boot device is set to cdrom
2009-07-10T01:44:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	but for you, I will double check
2009-07-10T01:47:00.000Z	qwyeth	|unjustice|	 Anyway, if the BIOS is set right then problem could either be the motherboard or the drive. The next thing I would do is replace the drive.  If you don't have another drive available, you could try making a bootable Ubuntu install USB key, which would work exactly the same as a CD.  Not all BIOSes support boot from USB though.
2009-07-10T01:48:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	okay, he has no boot setting for disc, he has boot from networks, and via stat raid utility, and boot num lock
2009-07-10T01:48:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	I am setting boot device to cdrom again
2009-07-10T01:49:00.000Z	qwyeth	|unjustice|	 Good luck!
2009-07-10T02:02:00.000Z	|unjustice|	qwyeth	so I got the disc to boot, and I checked it for errors however, once I begin the install the screen freezes with a bunch of nonsense
