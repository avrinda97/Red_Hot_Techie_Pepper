2010-05-28T22:56:00.000Z	cristian_c		especially with regard to the sounds of startup and login
2010-05-28T22:57:00.000Z	cristian_c		How do I change these operation through text files and the terminal?
2010-05-28T22:59:00.000Z	cristian_c		I use Xfce
2010-05-28T22:59:00.000Z	cristian_c		Xubuntu
2010-05-28T22:59:00.000Z	cristian_c		ok
2010-05-28T23:00:00.000Z	cristian_c		on channel # xubuntu told me to ask here
2010-05-28T23:00:00.000Z	pure_hate	cristian_c	You have to modify/create  /etc/gdm/custom.conf

2010-05-28T23:05:00.000Z	cristian_c	pure_hate	http://paste.ubuntu.com/440981/    I also saw the link I've been through but there are no options to select the startup and login sounds apparently
2010-05-28T23:06:00.000Z	pure_hate	cristian_c	you didnt read very well
2010-05-28T23:06:00.000Z	pure_hate	cristian_c	Greeter=bin/gdmlogin --disable-sound
2010-05-28T23:11:00.000Z	cristian_c	pure_hate	ok, thanks but "Full path and name of the greeter executable followed by optional arguments."
2010-05-28T23:11:00.000Z	cristian_c	pure_hate	what are the optional arguments?
2010-05-28T23:12:00.000Z	cristian_c	pure_hate	I have to select sounds that are part of a theme
2010-05-28T23:12:00.000Z	pure_hate	cristian_c	I have no idea but I looked in gdm.conf and there are tons of options you can set including start sounds
2010-05-28T23:13:00.000Z	pure_hate	cristian_c	well yeah, you have to provide the path to the sound
2010-05-28T23:13:00.000Z	cristian_c	pure_hate	ok, I will look for in gdm.conf
2010-05-28T23:18:00.000Z	cristian_c	pure_hate	I looked gdm.conf but I did not understand how I write the line custom.conf. Sorry but I'm pretty noob on this topic
2010-05-28T23:19:00.000Z	pure_hate	cristian_c	maybe you should use the provided gdm configuration GUI then rather than useing the shell
