2011-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	Chubcorp		is there any way to access the C:// drive on a dual boot while in Ubuntu?
2011-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	Chubcorp		I can't seem to find it
2011-04-19T09:28:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	linux doesn't identify the drive as C:
2011-04-19T09:29:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	what would it be calles
2011-04-19T09:29:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	at the command line type: df
2011-04-19T09:30:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	I don't know what I'm looking at sry
2011-04-19T09:30:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	under Filesystem it should say something along the lined of /dev/sda1
2011-04-19T09:30:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	yeah, dev/sda5 and sda2
2011-04-19T09:31:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	do you have two hard drives?
2011-04-19T09:31:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	just one
2011-04-19T09:31:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	ok, what is the goal? are you trying to find a file?
2011-04-19T09:32:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	I'm trying to place a file into it. so I can run fixmbr
2011-04-19T09:33:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	fixmbr is a windows thing isn't it?
2011-04-19T09:34:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	yes, but i'm placing the exe files into it.
2011-04-19T09:35:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	I need to remove linux and keep windows, I know crazy.
2011-04-19T09:36:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	it happens :)  i'm reasonably sure fixmbr can only be run from a windows recovery disk. so i'm not sure why you are asking how linux would mount the hard drive. windows does it differently.
2011-04-19T09:37:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	I just need to place the files into it from linux then running it in windows
2011-04-19T09:37:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	ok, what directory are you looking for?
2011-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	place a file into the root drive C
2011-04-19T09:39:00.000Z	milamber	Chubcorp	on linux the 'base' directory is: /
2011-04-19T09:42:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	I found the root, but I don't have the permission to see the contents. Know a way around it, if not thanks anyway.
2011-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	Chubcorp	milamber	none of that worked, I still don't have permission from the admin
