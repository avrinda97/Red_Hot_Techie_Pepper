2012-03-02T04:11:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	use a pastebin to show us the full error
2012-03-02T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	are you positive?  Where is it being displayed?  Is there a scrollbar?  Can you click on it and press down to show more?  What do you do to get this output? (there are several questions here)
2012-03-02T04:16:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	What do you do to get this output?
2012-03-02T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	find an application where?
2012-03-02T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	was this problem always present?
2012-03-02T04:22:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	sounds like bug #659438
2012-03-02T04:23:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	see ubottu's message
2012-03-02T04:24:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	read through the comments in the bug report
2012-03-02T04:25:00.000Z	reesk	jrib	would conecting a 56k modem to my machine and whistling dtmf dial tones into it help any lol
2012-03-02T04:26:00.000Z	jrib	reesk	doubtful :)  I must go, but the comments in the report seem to claim that you should make sure your ubuntu is up to date (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade).  If that doesn't fix it, keep reading.  If you are still unsure, ask again here but mention your ubuntu version
