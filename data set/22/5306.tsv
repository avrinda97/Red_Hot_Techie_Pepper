2008-02-05T19:00:00.000Z	titanix88		how can i ssh into another local computer? it says ssh is refused.
2008-02-05T19:01:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	are you running an ssh server on the other computer?
2008-02-05T19:01:00.000Z	titanix88	compwiz18	ssh server?!
2008-02-05T19:02:00.000Z	titanix88		i wanna know how can i enable ssh login in ubuntu.
2008-02-05T19:03:00.000Z	titanix88		okkkkkk :|
2008-02-05T19:03:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	it's easy, don't worry :)
2008-02-05T19:04:00.000Z	titanix88		btw how can i share files between two lan connected ubuntu machine?
2008-02-05T19:05:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	you can use ssh to do that too
2008-02-05T19:06:00.000Z	titanix88	compwiz18	i have some experience with ssh and scp, but i could not think they did not install it by default! :o
2008-02-05T19:07:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	they don't on ubuntu, because most people will never use it.  ssh client is installed by default, however.
2008-02-05T19:07:00.000Z	compwiz18		also, it opens [possible] security holes running a server most people won't use
2008-02-05T19:07:00.000Z	titanix88	compwiz18	hmmm.
2008-02-05T19:08:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	and it's easy to install: sudo apt-get install openssh
2008-02-05T19:08:00.000Z	compwiz18		openssh-server
2008-02-05T19:08:00.000Z	compwiz18		or something like that :)
2008-02-05T19:09:00.000Z	titanix88	compwiz18	yeah. i got it. thnx for your help. :)
2008-02-05T19:09:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	great :)
2008-02-05T19:11:00.000Z	compwiz18		!ask
2008-02-05T19:11:00.000Z	titanix88		one more question. can anyone tell me about pulse audio's networking concepts? my friend has a nice speaker. i wanna share it. so i installed pulseaudio properly. then lot's of server, source, sink thing... :( i dont get them.
2008-02-05T19:12:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	pulse will be default in next version but that probably doesn't help you much :)
2008-02-05T19:12:00.000Z	compwiz18	titanix88	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio ?
2008-02-05T19:13:00.000Z	titanix88	compwiz18	yeah during lots of source sink combination, it actually worked once!!:-/ but i can not recreate it.
