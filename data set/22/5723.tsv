2007-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	bruenig	jessica^^	looks like you need libdvdcss2
2007-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	jessica^^	bruenig	one sec
2007-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	jessica^^	bruenig	h1st0: libdvdcss2 is already the newest version.
2007-03-12T07:20:00.000Z	bruenig	jessica^^	no idea then, it _should_ work, but vlc also _should_ not segfault. Maybe your install is hosed in some way.
2007-03-12T07:20:00.000Z	jessica^^	bruenig	the install's brand new.
