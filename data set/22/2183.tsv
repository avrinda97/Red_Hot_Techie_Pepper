2010-11-08T12:55:00.000Z	AnxiousNut		hello, I have an image with 30 layers in gimp and i need to convert it to a PDF, how can i do that?
2010-11-08T12:57:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	swg?
2010-11-08T12:57:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	I have them as .png's at the moment!
2010-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	so each layer is a png?
2010-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	yes
2010-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	then you don't want gimp, you want openoffice draw
2010-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	import each png as a page, then click the 'pdf' button
2010-11-08T12:59:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	okay. i'll try that out now
2010-11-08T12:59:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	works for me everytime :)
2010-11-08T13:02:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	currently im in gimp, what format should i save it as so that OO.o can import it as pages?
2010-11-08T13:03:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	you misunderstand: do not use gimp. import each PNG image as a page in openoffice draw.
2010-11-08T13:04:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	since you said they're png already, that means they're already saved as PNG, which OOo draw accepts
2010-11-08T13:04:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	but i have edited the layers and dont know how to do so in OO.o!
2010-11-08T13:04:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	I can't say this anymore simply - forget gimp, open each png in openoffice draw. what is so difficult about that?
2010-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	im not used to it and i have a midterm after an hour and i need to get this done! Learnign how to use OO.o would take time!, but thanks anyways
2010-11-08T13:07:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	I understand midterms - it's really not difficult - save your PNG images separately, then open each one in OOo, copy and paste each as a 'new page' until you get a bunch of pages that are of each PNG, then press the PDF button and it will make a PDF. it's EASY.
2010-11-08T13:07:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	each page of the PDF will be of each PNG
2010-11-08T13:07:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	30+ layers <.<
2010-11-08T13:07:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	you can have it done in 30 minutes, maybe less
2010-11-08T13:08:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	you have each PNG saved as a separate file, right?
2010-11-08T13:08:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	Gnea	lol nevermind, thanks anyways!
2010-11-08T13:08:00.000Z	Gnea	AnxiousNut	I'm telling you, you can't get gimp to do what OOo draw can do. but okay, shoot yourself in the foot, no skin off of my nose.
