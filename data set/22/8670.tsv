2006-08-21T10:18:00.000Z	TokenBad		no one else had this problem?
2006-08-21T10:20:00.000Z	TokenBad		where is the xorg file located?
2006-08-21T10:21:00.000Z	TokenBad		hmm....that file is blank for me
2006-08-21T10:23:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	probably meant sudo dpkg-reconfigure package-name
2006-08-21T10:24:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-08-21T10:25:00.000Z	TokenBad	FunnyLookinHat	says broken or not fully installed
2006-08-21T10:25:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	ouch.
2006-08-21T10:26:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	you are on a fresh ubuntu installation?   (Sorry, I don't know exactly what your problem is, i sort of jumped in through the middle)
2006-08-21T10:26:00.000Z	TokenBad	FunnyLookinHat	no...I updated from breezy to dapper...and rebooted...and it gave failed to load x server
2006-08-21T10:27:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	oh dang.   updates can get a bit hairy.   Ok, we need to do a few things
2006-08-21T10:28:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	sudo apt-get install -f iirc
2006-08-21T10:28:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	don't type the irrc
2006-08-21T10:28:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	do this in a console: sudo apt-get install -f
2006-08-21T10:28:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	then we need to do a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-11-28T06:35:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	you have to edit the allowed users to login somewher ein the proftpd config file...  try googling or ubuntuforums.org
2006-11-28T06:38:00.000Z	TokenBad	FunnyLookinHat	I don
2006-11-28T06:38:00.000Z	TokenBad	FunnyLookinHat	I don't see anything in proftpd.conf about that
2006-11-28T06:39:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	try googling...  it might be a different file called like users.conf or something in /etc/proftpd/ or somethin
2006-11-28T06:39:00.000Z	TokenBad	FunnyLookinHat	I never had to do that before....when did they start that....
2006-11-28T06:40:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	not sure...  I could be wrong...  all I know is that I've had my fair share of issues with FTP daemons in linux finding specific security options
2006-11-28T06:40:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	try searching ubuntuforums.org ?
2006-11-28T06:40:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	TokenBad	or ask in #ubuntu-server        they know what to do
