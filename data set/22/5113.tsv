2010-02-27T10:59:00.000Z	AMAG		Hi, I'm having a rough time with my PCs today.  I had to sacrifice my desktop machine, which was setup for my 30" monitor, so I could have a functioning power supply for my server and database.
2010-02-27T11:00:00.000Z	AMAG		It's been about 3 years since I setup the desktop and I can't remember the steps I went through to get the 30" screen working.  My question is basically, will it be easier to repeat those steps again on my old 6.10 installation, or should I go ahead and upgrade to the latest ubuntu?
2010-02-27T11:01:00.000Z	AMAG		becker_11:I am pretty glad the server was not fried, because the power supply started smoking, and then sparks started shooting out of it inside of the case.  So if I just lose a few hours and a $100 new PSU I will be happy. :)
2010-02-27T11:02:00.000Z	AMAG		Andys^:I tried, it didn't "just work," when I got the other machine it took me a few hours to figure out how to set it up.  I assume the new 9.10 is probably way easier to do it on than 6.10 though, or maybe that's what you mean, that it'll "just work" on 9.10?
2010-02-27T11:03:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	try a LiveCD
2010-02-27T11:03:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	That'd be a good test to see if it "just works"
2010-02-27T11:01:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	upgrading has lots of advantages, aside from likely being easier (provided you have a seperate /home at the least)
2010-02-27T11:03:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	load up a Flash LiveCD, two birds with one stone and all.
2010-02-27T11:04:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	google is your friend :)
2010-02-27T11:09:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	Yep.
2010-02-27T11:09:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	more then 3gb of ram on your machine?
2010-02-27T11:10:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	the "alternate" version doesn't contain a desktop enviroment
2010-02-27T11:10:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	I'd recommend getting the 32 bit.
2010-02-27T11:11:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	64bit is a pain if it's not needed (less than 3.2gb of memory)
2010-02-27T11:12:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	Ah, nevermind.  Yea, mainly for flash, 64bit has other issues, but they tend to be pretty specific
2010-02-27T11:12:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	If you have a spare 1gig flash drive that's the fastest route
2010-02-27T11:14:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	I run one for video games, dual boot with kubuntu
2010-02-27T11:40:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	sudo apt-get install usb-creator-gtk
2010-02-27T11:41:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	not sure if it's available on 8.10 though.
2010-02-27T11:43:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/usb-creator
2010-02-27T11:43:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	not sure how the dependencies will go though.
2010-02-27T11:46:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	AMAG	You could try mounting the ISO, and see if the USB creator will run.
