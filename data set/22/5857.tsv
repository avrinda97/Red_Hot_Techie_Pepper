2010-03-16T23:15:00.000Z	klimraamkosie		have you turned on your wireless adapter?
2010-03-16T23:17:00.000Z	klimraamkosie		I have two partitions on my single 1TB drive in my new ubuntu 9.10 machine.  I set the first mount point to / and the second mount point (on the second partition) to /home
2010-03-16T23:17:00.000Z	klimraamkosie		How do I change the mount point on the second partition and move my /home to the first one.
2010-03-16T23:18:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	any particular reason why you want to trade places with them?
2010-03-16T23:18:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	You can resize one or both you know.
2010-03-16T23:19:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	I want to use the second 90% of the drive, for samba sharing.
2010-03-16T23:19:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	It is really a pretty good arrangement to have /home on it's on partition.  And you have a LARGE drive anyway.
2010-03-16T23:20:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	You probably only need 6-8 G for /
2010-03-16T23:20:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	/home can be 20 or 30G
2010-03-16T23:20:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	/ has about 50GB right now.  I'd like to throw /home in there.
2010-03-16T23:20:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	You can do that
2010-03-16T23:21:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	so that it's on the same partition.
2010-03-16T23:21:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	Then I want to use the rest of the drive as a network shared drive.
2010-03-16T23:21:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	basically you just do: cp -a /home /  and then change the fstab entry.
2010-03-16T23:23:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	Awesomesauce, lets hope it has some hints on moving it back. Thanks!
2010-03-16T23:23:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	You can just take the above info and see what there is to do.
2010-03-16T23:23:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	Thanks :)
2010-03-16T23:23:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	You just do: cp -a /home /  and then change the fstab entry.
2010-03-16T23:24:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	and reboot to make sure it all works ok before deleting the second partition.
2010-03-16T23:28:00.000Z	terry_	klimraamkosie	You could also reduce the size of the first partition to 8 or 10G and the second to -40G
2010-03-16T23:29:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	So just boot with the live CD and resize?
2010-03-16T23:29:00.000Z	klimraamkosie	terry_	that would probably be a lot easier
