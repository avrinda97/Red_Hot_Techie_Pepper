2007-03-02T16:15:00.000Z	DaveTarmac		ok, networking question time. I've been trying to get my Atheros AR5212 chipset wireless card to see my wpa-psk network for a while now. So far, I've got the MadWiFI driver on, the WPA Supplicant on. I am trying to get the network-manager-gnome on, but (and this is going to sound like a dumb question) I can't seem to install it using 'sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome' from inside the extracted directory. What am I doing wrong?
2007-03-02T16:16:00.000Z	DaveTarmac		I'm using Edgy 6.10 by the way, if that helps...
2007-03-02T16:16:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	aptitude search network-manager-gnome
2007-03-02T16:17:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	mneptok	just done the aptitude search. drive ticked but then got another command prompt up. now what?
2007-03-02T16:18:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	sudo aptitude update
2007-03-02T16:19:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	mneptok	and then?
2007-03-02T16:19:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	aptitude search network-manager-gnome
2007-03-02T16:19:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	see the package now?
2007-03-02T16:20:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	pastebin your sources.lst?
2007-03-02T16:21:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	then aptitude ain't gonna help you at all
2007-03-02T16:22:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	mneptok	is there a way to manually install it?
2007-03-02T16:22:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	aptitude/apt-get/Synaptic/Adept are all package managers. you can't search for and download and install a package to a machine with no network connection.
2007-03-02T16:23:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	sure, download n-m-g and all its dependencies and install them by hand
2007-03-02T16:23:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	mneptok	- sorry to be a pain about this. VERY new to linux
2007-03-02T16:23:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	you don't. here's a list of n-m-g dependencies.
2007-03-02T16:24:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	feel free to get *all* those dependencies. or to just put a NIC in that machine for 10 minutes. ;)
2007-03-02T16:26:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	this machine has no wired connection?
2007-03-02T16:27:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	pull ih downstairs long enough to do the wireless dance?
2007-03-02T16:28:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	mneptok	don't *think* there is enough power sockets downstairs...
2007-03-02T16:29:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	mneptok	looks like i don't have a choice though, really...
2007-03-02T16:30:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	mneptok	ok, what are the commands i need to perform on the box downstairs
2007-03-02T16:30:00.000Z	mneptok	DaveTarmac	or just set the router to do WEP for 10 minutes
