2006-06-02T10:24:00.000Z	freakabcd		hi all
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	freakabcd		why don't we have a diff/delta system for binary debs ?
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	freakabcd		its a pain in the ass that it gets a freaking 30 meg ooo-core file!
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	there's one being considered
2006-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	it better be considered.
2006-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	you chose to run the development branch before it finalised.
2006-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	what!!
2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	ok. even after dapper has been released, if some update to ooo-core is there, its damn sure going to be 30 megs!
2006-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	obviously it's going to be huge, which is unfortunate, but don't for one second think we're going to shove an entirely new untested content distribution system into a released, stable distro, /much less our network infrastructure/
2006-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	anyway. i'm happy that it is being considered.
2006-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	i agree. but maybe it must have been thought of even during the hoary (or even pre-hoary)days
2006-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	it was, and it has not been and is not marked high priority
2006-06-02T10:31:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	it is simply impossible to address every person's pet project in any given release
2006-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	no. i mean is someone working on it or its just an idea that has low priority now?
2006-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	it's any idea that is being tested by community members and is possibly a SoC project
2006-06-02T10:34:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	any bug-report or feature request logged on launchpad or similar site where i can take a look at this?
2006-06-02T10:34:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	look on LP under the specs
2006-06-02T10:39:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	err.. i don;t see anything resembling a diff/delta plan for deb distro under Specifications on LP
2006-06-02T10:40:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	search -devel archives for binary diff
2006-06-02T10:41:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	ok will try that now
2006-06-02T10:45:00.000Z	freakabcd	crimsun	ok found it: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-May/017602.html
2006-10-05T10:57:00.000Z	crimsun	freakabcd	because it isn't. It's Edgy+1 material.
