2011-02-23T06:45:00.000Z	Roasted		Is there a reason why Rhythmbox doesn't detect all of my music on my mp3 player? Each time I plug it in, Rhythmbox "imports" a different number. It varies from, 0, 690, 665, 700, 890, 1100, etc. Yet the number NEVER changes....

2011-02-23T06:48:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	After watching this struggle for days :) ... maybe it's time to try #rhythmbox on irc.gnome.org ?
2011-02-23T06:53:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	I'd try #rhythmbox on irc.gnome.org (the horse's mouth) ... after all this time, it can't hurt

2011-02-23T22:34:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	gohan had the short answer, but knowing you a bit, I thought you'd also want the long answer too
2011-02-23T22:35:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	I actually googled it and beat both of ya to the chase by a matter of nanoseconds. Xchat flashed up when I had received the MD5 ont he ISO. Guess I jumped the gun and asked too soon. :P
2011-02-23T22:35:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	OK, next time I'll just say RTFM, it's faster :)
2011-02-23T22:36:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	I assume if I CD into the directory of /media/KubuntuCDIBurned and run md5sum I'd get the MD5 of that disc?
2011-02-23T22:36:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	or can I only get the MD5 after burning it? I remember K3B showing me the MD5 in the log after a burn sesison
2011-02-23T22:37:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	it's just sitting here with a flashing cursor after running md5sum within the CD dir, that's why I'm like, uhh?
2011-03-02T04:14:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	I think the best way to enable them would be /j pitivi  :)
2011-03-02T04:14:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	what?
2011-03-02T04:15:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	nobody is answering in there. another dead program chat.
2011-03-02T04:38:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	Swap ==being equal RAM, all things
2011-03-26T01:49:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	What obscure and vexing problem have you for us today, bro...or are you here just to chat? :)
2011-03-26T01:50:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	the only problem I'm trying tos olve I don't believe is an ubuntu problem. I think it's likewise-open, sicne it's a domain related issue.
2011-03-26T01:50:00.000Z	Roasted	drc	what previous issue were your eferring to?
2011-03-26T01:50:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	Darn!  I look forward to the discussion you engender :)
2011-03-26T01:58:00.000Z	drc	Roasted	Let it go (I have)...he will not see the obvious because he doesn't want to
