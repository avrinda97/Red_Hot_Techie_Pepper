2007-05-10T07:45:00.000Z	maxbeatt		anyone got any guesses how long it'll take to install feisty on a 400mhz amd-k6 w/ 64mb ram?
2007-05-10T07:45:00.000Z	Don	maxbeatt	 Free pizza to the closest guess?
2007-05-10T07:46:00.000Z	maxbeatt	Don	lol mb we could work out something
2007-05-10T07:46:00.000Z	Don		What speed CD ROM?
2007-05-10T07:46:00.000Z	maxbeatt		24x
2007-05-10T07:46:00.000Z	Don		Fresh install?
2007-05-10T07:46:00.000Z	maxbeatt		yep
2007-05-10T07:47:00.000Z	Don		35 minutes
2007-05-10T07:47:00.000Z	maxbeatt		my parents were thinking of throwing it out so i thought i'd play with ubuntu over the summer instead
2007-05-10T07:48:00.000Z	Don		OK, maybe closer to 45 minutes
2007-05-10T07:48:00.000Z	maxbeatt		i've already gotten a few "out of memory" msgs
2007-05-10T07:49:00.000Z	Don		He he.  oops
2007-05-10T07:49:00.000Z	maxbeatt		so i'm not sure what to do about those
2007-05-10T07:49:00.000Z	Don		Try xubuntu using the alternate cd image.
2007-05-10T07:49:00.000Z	Don		It's better suited for older hardware with limited memory.  How much RAM do you have?
2007-05-10T07:50:00.000Z	maxbeatt		64MB
2007-05-10T07:51:00.000Z	maxbeatt		it's an old Gateway Profile (1st gen) so it's near impossible to upgrade
2007-05-10T07:51:00.000Z	Don	maxbeatt	Don't even try Ubuntu.  Grab Xubuntu and make sure you grab the alternate image.
2007-05-10T07:51:00.000Z	maxbeatt		whats with the alternate image?
2007-05-10T07:52:00.000Z	Don	maxbeatt	 http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/feisty/release/  scroll down to the Alternate install CD
2007-05-10T07:53:00.000Z	Don	maxbeatt	 Xubuntu is much better suited for old hardware with limited memory
2007-05-10T07:53:00.000Z	maxbeatt	Don	big thanks for the recommendation. def sounds like waht i need
