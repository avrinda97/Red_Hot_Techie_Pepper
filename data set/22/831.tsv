2011-03-18T16:42:00.000Z	Ploploploop		Hello all . I have an interesting porblem. I can't gain access to my computer (obviously not his one) for an apparently stupid reason. When the computer finish his boot, he won't show the space to enter my password. But here is he trick. If I try ctrl alt F1, the screen shut. If I try to boot in safe mode, the computer cracsh after loading the usb port and an live usb start fail with getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (
2011-03-18T16:42:00.000Z	Ploploploop		0). I checked the md5sum of he iso and it's good, beside the problems started after I did he first upgrade, not right after the installation. Dos someone have an idea?
2011-03-18T16:44:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	So you are unable to boot into live USB?  Can you use a live CD instead to get into it?
2011-03-18T16:45:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	After boot, you can also try alt-sysrq-k to try to get back to a console.  it should kill the x server.  You may have to do the ctrl-alt-f1 first to get to a console (even if it appears blank), then do the alt-sysrq-k.

2011-03-18T16:49:00.000Z	Ploploploop		suprr?
2011-03-18T16:49:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	if not so marked on your keyboard, it would also be the same key as print-screen
2011-03-18T16:50:00.000Z	Ploploploop	[segfault]	it crashed
2011-03-18T16:51:00.000Z	Ploploploop		I have a few with point on scrren , and the cursor, frozen
2011-03-18T16:51:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	can you boot off of a live CD instead, so that you can repair things?
2011-03-18T16:52:00.000Z	Ploploploop		I tried that (liveusb as I have no cddrive) and I got  getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (

2011-03-18T16:53:00.000Z	Ploploploop		any other idea?
2011-03-18T16:54:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	hmm..well, since you already checked the MD5 checksum, the USB image seems good... maybe you are experiencing a hardware issue?  You might check your bios settings and refresh them for starters, maybe reseat the ram, check connections.
2011-03-18T16:56:00.000Z	Ploploploop	[segfault]	 Yeah...
2011-03-18T16:57:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	btw, which version of Ubuntu is on the USB?
2011-03-18T16:57:00.000Z	Ploploploop		10.10
2011-03-18T16:58:00.000Z	Ploploploop	[segfault]	the latest 10.10
2011-03-18T16:58:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	yeah, hmm.  well I thought it might be related to an earlier bug in Lucid..:(
2011-03-18T16:59:00.000Z	Ploploploop	[segfault]	one possible problem could be that I have a wifi n card, or usb3 ports, as well as esata
2011-03-18T17:00:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	well, I suppose, but the latest kernel should be supporting all of that, and at least not die like that if it doesn't for some reason.
2011-03-18T17:04:00.000Z	[segfault]	Ploploploop	you could always make another bootable USB using a recovery iso like this one - http://trinityhome.org/Home/index.php?content=TRINITY_RESCUE_KIT____CPR_FOR_YOUR_COMPUTER&front_id=12&lang=en&locale=en
