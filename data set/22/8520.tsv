2005-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	xkuseme		splashimage (hdx,y)/boot/grub/images/ubuntu_foo.xpm.gz
2005-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	xkuseme		sorry
2005-07-18T11:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	(hd0,1) would be the first partition on the primary hdd
2005-07-18T11:45:00.000Z	xkuseme	gyaresu	hmm ok where do you think should i place this as the splash image for grub
2005-07-18T11:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	then presuming the /boot/ is on that partition it will find the file ubuntu_foo.xpm.gz
2005-07-18T11:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	i don't think you should unless you are having grub wait for your decision.
2005-07-18T11:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	cause if you set grub to auto boot then it's only on the screen for a second.
2005-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	xkuseme	gyaresu	oh ok, so only good for dual boot or different kernels
2005-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	 you can get grub to wait and not auto boot and then it would be worth it.
2005-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	xkuseme	gyaresu	how do you do that?
2005-07-18T11:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	what? stop the auto boot? 'man grub'
2005-07-18T11:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	you'll see a default boot option in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-07-18T11:50:00.000Z	xkuseme	gyaresu	oh can i just set the wait time there?
2005-07-18T11:50:00.000Z	gyaresu	xkuseme	aye. i'm just looking up to see if you set 0 that it waits... can't remember off the top of my head.
2005-07-18T11:51:00.000Z	xkuseme	gyaresu	right now it's set to timeout 3
2005-07-18T11:53:00.000Z	gyaresu		does anyone have a copy of sharethenet
2005-07-18T11:54:00.000Z	gyaresu		does anyone remember sharethenet? the website is down and firebird619 needs a copy.
2005-07-18T11:56:00.000Z	xkuseme	gyaresu	what is your timeout set to?
