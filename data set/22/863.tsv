2011-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	Stereocaulon		I've just upgrade form 10.10 to 11.04 but I got an error stating that the upgrade had failed leaving my machine in a possibly unstable state. Where can I find the upgrade log and should I refrain from restarting my machine?
2011-04-30T17:33:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	/var/log/dist-upgrade/ apt.log and main.log
2011-04-30T17:33:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	thanks for the locations! :-)
2011-04-30T17:34:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	where did it stop?
2011-04-30T17:34:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	I'll post a pastebin of my upgradelog to illustrate the stopping point
2011-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	ty
2011-04-30T17:45:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	ok, I see. Is that dutch? pls run "sudo dpkg --configure -a"

2011-04-30T17:40:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	"Vereisten" = "Dependencies"
2011-04-30T17:41:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	and the main.log
2011-04-30T17:42:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	sure, I'll pastebin that one seperately
2011-04-30T17:43:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	http://paste.ubuntu.com/601313/
2011-04-30T17:43:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	thanks in advance for lending a hand :-)
2011-04-30T17:46:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	yes, that's Dutch, kinda silly that the logging is translated ;-)
2011-04-30T17:46:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	yeah, I allways have to translate things here, if I got a question ;) and pls paste the results of that command
2011-04-30T17:47:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	I've run your somewhat ominous command O_o
2011-04-30T17:47:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	there were no results, just a new cmd prompt
2011-04-30T17:48:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	lets concentrate on the packages mentioned in main.log at the end (> line 169)
2011-04-30T17:49:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure python"
2011-04-30T17:50:00.000Z	Incarus6	Stereocaulon	btw it's not safe to reboot. the TTYs will work, but not the nvidia driver nor metacity
2011-04-30T17:50:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	I've executed the reconfig python line, no feedback from the cmd-line | Thx for the warning not to reboot :-)
2011-04-30T17:51:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Incarus6	could we please join a priv. channel?, the chatter makes it hard to follow your responses
