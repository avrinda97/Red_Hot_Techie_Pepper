2012-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	aBound		OpenBSD is just a modified bsd kernel.
2012-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	Barnabas	aBound	I think a few bsd ppl would disagree with you on that one
2012-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	aBound	Barnabas	They'll be outta their minds given there's no reason to rebuild an entirely new kernel.
2012-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	aBound	Barnabas	OpenBSD is a Unix-like computer operating system descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley. It was forked from NetBSD by project leader Theo de Raadt in late 1995
2012-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	aBound		OpenBSD was forked from NetBSD and NetBSD was forked from FreeBSD.
2012-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	Barnabas	aBound	I know
2012-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	aBound		:P
2012-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	aBound		Same kernel.
2012-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	Barnabas		not anymore
2012-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	Barnabas		the scheduler is vastly different between openbsd and freebsd
2012-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	aBound	Barnabas	That's why I used the term: modified.
2012-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	Barnabas		again potatoes and tomatoes
2012-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	aBound		hehe
2012-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	aBound		Mac OS X uses partial BSD sockets code.
2012-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	Barnabas		yep
2012-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	Barnabas		due to the license
2012-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	aBound		It'd be hard not to think that all these other forks from FreeBSD aren't using the BSD kernel.
2012-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	Barnabas		GPL ruled linux out there
2012-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	aBound		We gotcha stanley. :P
2012-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	Barnabas		check
2012-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	aBound	Barnabas	We better shut it before we get the boot. lol
