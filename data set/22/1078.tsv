2010-10-15T22:17:00.000Z	Thelz2		Hello. Can anyone tell me how to check the harddisk partition(s) for errors while running from the Ubuntu Desktop CD.
2010-10-15T22:17:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	that's usually done at boottime with fsck
2010-10-15T22:18:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	It does that automatically when bootting from the harddisk. However, it runs into files that are in use, so it won't complete.
2010-10-15T22:18:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	that's weird, because it's not supposed to fsck while mounted
2010-10-15T22:18:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	I was hoping I could do it remotely from the CD, so there would be no harddisk files in use.
2010-10-15T22:19:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	that would work, just boot the livecd and manually run the fsck from the commandline terminal - just make sure you use the correct fsck.ext[ension] for the correct filesystem
2010-10-15T22:20:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	How would I go about doing that? The right extention, I mean.
2010-10-15T22:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	first of all, see what your partitions are formatted as: open a terminal in your regular system and type:  df -Th
2010-10-15T22:21:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	LVM
2010-10-15T22:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	check that 2nd url
2010-10-15T22:22:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	I'm running the CD on the computer that has the issues. I can't actually get to the terminal when booting from the harddisk. And ok, will do.
2010-10-15T22:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	actually, I made a boo-boo, that link doesn't explicitly tell you the proper procedure for fscking an lvm
2010-10-15T22:25:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	Ah ok... I was already somewhat confused wondering what I was looking for
2010-10-15T22:25:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	yeah, I realized what needs to be done so I'm looking for it
2010-10-15T22:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this is legit, as most sites that describe it don't seem to get down to the nuts & bolts of it very well: http://churchgoopensource.blogspot.com/2010/06/how-to-fsck-fix-error-lvm-volume.html
2010-10-15T22:29:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	Ok, thanks, let me give it a shot
2010-10-15T22:37:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	When I do "fsck -f Lapje", I just get the fsck version. When I do "fsck -f /dev/Lapje/root", I eventually get "fsck.ext3: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open /dev/mapper/Lapje-root Could this be a zero-length partition?"
2010-10-15T22:42:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	not sure
2010-10-15T22:45:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	Ok, well, thanks anyhow
2010-10-15T22:46:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	hm, do you ahve a /var/log/fsck/checkroot file?
2010-10-15T22:48:00.000Z	Thelz2	Gnea	I do. it contains: (Nothing has been logged yet.)
2010-10-15T22:48:00.000Z	Gnea	Thelz2	bummer
