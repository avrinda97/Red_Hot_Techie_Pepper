2006-12-24T12:43:00.000Z	Ashton_K	racarr	you use Beryl?
2006-12-24T12:43:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	Use and develop :p
2006-12-24T12:44:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	I like it, a lot of usability features lately like the new Opacify plugin...and a few more ways to balance bling and usability
2006-12-24T12:45:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	I.e. the 3D windows effect only on moouse driven rotate...new release is today...
2006-12-24T12:45:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	? It's just a window manager
2006-12-24T12:47:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	I think so, but we have someone who releases ebuilds I know...
2006-12-24T12:47:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	If it is in portage it's likely older
2006-12-24T12:49:00.000Z	Ashton_K	racarr	I'll probably wander your way in July, when I know C++
2006-12-24T12:49:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	Hehe, good luck
2006-12-24T12:50:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	My condolences
2006-12-24T12:54:00.000Z	Ashton_K	racarr	does the Beryl site have any screenshots? I want eye candy without having to install.
2006-12-24T12:55:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	http://www.beryl-project.org/features.php
2006-12-24T13:02:00.000Z	Ashton_K	racarr	that's going to copy EVERYTHING to that backup drive.
2006-12-24T13:02:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	What's what he wanted
2006-12-24T13:04:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	He wanted an image...
2006-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	I spent 2 hours trying to get my wireless to work when I got my laptop because  the laptop has a 'radio frequency  kill switch'
2006-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	That just reminded me of the ancedote
2006-12-24T13:32:00.000Z	Ashton_K	racarr	well, it'd be faster than Thumb drives.
2006-12-24T14:43:00.000Z	racarr	Ashton_K	Jesusmas?
