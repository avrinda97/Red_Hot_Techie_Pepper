2006-08-03T12:10:00.000Z	ompaul	DJAdmiral	one would prefer if you didn't, as I explained yesterday ;-) if there is a moving line in the sand where is the line today - if there is a brick wall it is easy to see the boundry
2006-08-03T12:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	ompaul	okay then, i'll try not to use that word whenever possible.
2006-08-03T12:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	ompaul	thanks for pointing me in the right direction, much appreciated :)
2006-08-31T16:18:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	ompaul	hey, do you remember the ubotu command where it tells people to not say 'hey can somebody help me or answer my question' or something like that?
2006-08-31T16:18:00.000Z	ompaul	DJAdmiral	^^ (or ehh no :-))
2006-11-05T11:00:00.000Z	ompaul	DJAdmiral	you have made the point
2006-11-05T11:01:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	ompaul	I know.
2006-11-05T11:02:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	ompaul	mc__|umbauen: I'm not pursuing this thing any further. I have a headache as it is.
2006-11-05T11:03:00.000Z	ompaul	DJAdmiral	I believe that thunderbird can do that
2006-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	ompaul	DJAdmiral	possibly evolution also
2006-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	ompaul	Evolution cannot convert PST to MBOX.
2008-03-08T18:05:00.000Z	ompaul	DJAdmiral	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
2008-03-08T18:07:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	ompaul	I'm looking for self-extracting archive creation utilities on linux
2008-03-08T18:08:00.000Z	ompaul	DJAdmiral	well then I guess you have to scipt it yourself - i.e. no - because other than tar there is no reasonable expectation that tools will be there for you - and you can point and click on most archives these days
