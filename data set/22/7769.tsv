2006-01-19T17:59:00.000Z	dabaR	stevr1it	there is a character map as one of the accessibility apps, that you could use to copy and paste the character.

2006-01-19T06:01:00.000Z	dabaR	stevr1it	get a new keyboard, or something. Test it first on another computer or OS.
2006-01-19T06:01:00.000Z	dabaR	stevr1it	do you have Windows installed still?
2006-01-19T06:02:00.000Z	dabaR	stevr1it	well, you could test with the Ubuntu Live CD, do you have that?
2006-11-23T11:20:00.000Z	dabaR	stevr1it	look at the /etc/network/interfaces file, and use man interfaces as a reference, ask me for further help if you need it.
