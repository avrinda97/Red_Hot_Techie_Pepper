2010-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	seidos	dudewhat	maybe your original question was valid.  I'm not sure how many users in here actually bother to try to read the source code.  Not meaning to disparage the room, I just have no clue to what the value of that statistic is.
2010-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	dudewhat		well you cant edit code with just editing the functions
2010-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	dudewhat		you need the main file
