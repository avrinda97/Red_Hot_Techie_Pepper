2010-03-08T01:07:00.000Z	GeekSquid	rohithwiz23	I do not believe that card will work past Jaunty... I have the x200m running in jaunty without a problem though
2010-03-09T07:23:00.000Z	GeekSquid	rohithwiz23	easy way ... install openssh-server on ubuntu ... install filezilla on windows and use sftp
2010-03-09T07:23:00.000Z	rohithwiz23	GeekSquid	I have no clue.. what either one of those are..
2010-03-09T07:24:00.000Z	GeekSquid	rohithwiz23	google is your friend ... or 'sudo apt-get install openssh-server' on ubuntu terminal ... and then use this on your winbox http://filezilla-project.org/download.php
