2011-12-25T01:33:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	sudo dmidecode > /tmp/dmi-info
2011-12-25T01:34:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	then open that file (/tmp/dmi-info) in a text editor and copy it into http://paste.ubuntu.com
2011-12-25T01:34:00.000Z	sedeki	philpem	fine, ill post it wait
2011-12-25T01:35:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	forget what I just said, do what Seveas suggested :)
2011-12-25T01:35:00.000Z	sedeki	philpem	http://paste.ubuntu.com/781455/
2011-12-25T01:36:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	you have an LG X110-G.A7HBV
2011-12-25T01:36:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	10.2in screen netbook?
2011-12-25T01:38:00.000Z	sedeki	philpem	do you mean a flag to the module in alsa_base.conf?
2011-12-25T01:38:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	yes. see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
2011-12-25T01:38:00.000Z	sedeki	philpem	i looked at that earlier today
2011-12-25T01:39:00.000Z	sedeki	philpem	anything particularly interesting?
2011-12-25T01:39:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	look at the list of HD-Audio model IDs for the ALC888, and try them all in turn is really all I can suggest :(
2011-12-25T01:40:00.000Z	sedeki	philpem	what about the jack configuration?
2011-12-25T01:40:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	that's what i was talking about -- card model ('model' parameter to the module) is the jack configuration
2011-12-25T01:42:00.000Z	sedeki	philpem	ah i see. how about the enable=1 flag?
2011-12-25T01:43:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	no, you can do 'rmmod snd-intel-hda; modprobe snd-intel-hda model=xyz'
2011-12-25T01:46:00.000Z	philpem	sedeki	count to ten after you do that, it'll take a minute for PulseAudio to restart
