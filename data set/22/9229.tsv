2005-06-16T14:25:00.000Z	againstme		as long as the beta has thermal support ill try it
2005-06-16T14:25:00.000Z	againstme		i dont have any linux currently installed
2005-06-16T14:25:00.000Z	againstme		had no thermal support
2005-06-16T14:26:00.000Z	againstme		i have used the live  cd
2005-06-16T14:26:00.000Z	againstme		yeah i used power4
2005-06-16T14:26:00.000Z	againstme		from the live cd
2005-06-16T14:27:00.000Z	againstme		from the live cd, there was thermal support
2005-06-16T14:28:00.000Z	againstme		is ubuntu equivelent to say debian, mandrake, or gentoo in performance and packages?
2005-06-16T14:29:00.000Z	againstme		so ubuntu is a very powerfull distro?
2005-06-16T14:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 comparing with debian, basically ubuntu is more often more recent, though not 100% so .. they are basically siblings
2005-06-16T14:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 i think ubuntu will suit you well.  one bit of advice:  if you want to compile against a given library, say "foo" you not only want to install libfoo, but you also will want a libfoo-dev package.  -dev is a common oversight wibies codersth new
2005-06-16T14:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 wtf did i just type?  ... with newbie coders, it should have read
2005-06-16T14:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 the new release of gnome comes out every 6 months, ubuntu has it and reases a day or few after :)
2005-06-16T14:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 i'm not now, but i've d/l'd ubuntu isos via bt in the past
2005-06-16T14:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 and yes, any time my bt client is on, i'm offering both ubuntu images (and i note many grab it, which makes me happy)
2005-06-16T14:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 you're grabbing the dvd?
2005-06-16T14:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 okay, i put limewire up, to help you, but i'll take it down now wince i don't have the dvd and really could use the bw right now for something else
2005-06-16T14:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 i think mine is 1.5 down and 256 up, per official word, but they're upping it to 3 ... that said, mine has sucked lately for some reason
2005-06-16T14:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade
2005-06-16T14:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 weekly is probably adequate, though of course, security issues want patching the moment the patch comes out ,yadda yadda
2005-07-15T14:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 not advised
2005-07-15T14:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	againstme	 see man alien for details
