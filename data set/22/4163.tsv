2008-03-08T10:27:00.000Z	l815		is 40c too hot for a hard drive?
2008-03-08T10:29:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	my laptop hd is at 40c right now, if that's any reference
2008-03-08T10:30:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	maybe i'm just being paranoid, but it seems to be running hotter than with vista (by touch)
2008-03-08T10:31:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	i never used any other OS than kubuntu on this laptop, so i can't tell...
2008-03-08T10:36:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	i'm on KDE, i made a superkaramba widget based off hdparm
2008-03-08T10:36:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	i'd prefer one for gnome :), thanks though
2008-03-08T10:37:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	hdparm is a console program
2008-03-08T10:37:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	i just use superkaramba as a... i'd call it "frontend"
2008-03-08T10:37:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	well i'm looking for something i can add to my panel
2008-03-08T10:38:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	okay i'll check it out thanks :)
2008-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	idk, but that's a good idea
2008-03-08T11:48:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	i'm not a big gamer, but the way linux works has brought my interest back into mmo's :D
2008-03-08T11:48:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	there's regnum online in 3d, the mana world in 2d
2008-03-08T11:49:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	altho i believe regnum online doesn't have a big community of english speakers (i speak spanish)
2008-03-08T11:49:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	i tried it, but i keep running into problems
2008-03-08T11:49:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	i speak portuguese :D
2008-03-08T11:50:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	i don't know of any other mmo
2008-03-08T11:50:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	i'll try reinstalling
2008-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	but regnum did give me some problems before ATI worked on their drivers
2008-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	unfortuneatly i have intel graphics T-T
2008-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	leo_rockw	l815	check out the regnum forums, they might be able to help you out
2008-03-08T11:52:00.000Z	l815	leo_rockw	i was just heading over there, thanks :)
