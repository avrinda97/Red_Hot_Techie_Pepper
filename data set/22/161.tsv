2012-05-17T07:23:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	hit esc a bunch just before the loading screen shows
2012-05-17T07:24:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	edit the grub line and add -s to the end of it
2012-05-17T07:24:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	then boot and it will bring you to a terminal
2012-05-17T07:25:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	i have never edited the grub line before please instruct me
2012-05-17T07:26:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	it shows you commands at the bottom, but it's "e", then add -s to the end of it, hit enter, then type "b"
2012-05-17T07:27:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	for the kernel line (the longer one)
2012-05-17T07:28:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	i try to do the hitting ESC a bunch of time and nothing, i cant even get on a terminal, now please give me the commands i need to change that line on the grub you talking about, if you can and thanks wawowe
2012-05-17T07:29:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	you hit esc right when you see the purple screen, before the loading bar
2012-05-17T07:30:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	thats the thing you dont even get to see the purple screen right after the BIOS screen, the monitor goes to power save mode
2012-05-17T07:31:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	boot the ubuntu install cd
2012-05-17T07:31:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	so i just kept hitting ESC to see if anything comes up, and nothing and i did it for a long time
2012-05-17T07:31:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	the framebuffer is what's causing it
2012-05-17T07:32:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	need to disable it
2012-05-17T07:32:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	ok im on it, i will boot from the ubuntu CD and we go from there, or i can acces the machine on SSH and tell me how to disablethe framebuffer
2012-05-17T07:33:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	ssh would be faster if you've got it setup
2012-05-17T07:34:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	i dont get to see none of that
2012-05-17T07:35:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	im telling you right after the BIOS screen, the monitor goes to power save mode right after
2012-05-17T07:36:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	sorry that was for dr_willis
2012-05-17T07:36:00.000Z	Junior	wawowe	im on ssh now what?
2012-05-17T07:39:00.000Z	wawowe	Junior	edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg
