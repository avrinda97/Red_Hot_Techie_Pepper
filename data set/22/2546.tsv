2009-05-16T07:53:00.000Z	MacMoose		Is the default encoding for ubuntu utf8?
2009-05-16T07:54:00.000Z	MacMoose		or is the default encoding Latin1?
2009-05-16T07:55:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	it's utf-8, though some programs might use latin1
2009-05-16T07:56:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	So if I mount a volume without specifying any mount options utf8 gets used?
2009-05-16T07:56:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	what filesystem?
2009-05-16T07:56:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	NTFS
2009-05-16T07:57:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	and are you asking about file names, or the contents of the files themselves
2009-05-16T07:57:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	file names. If I specify uft8, it shows up fine. if I specify nothing, it shows corrupt characters, etc.
2009-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	I'm talking about chinese characters actually.
2009-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	Any idea why specifying UTF8 works, but not specifying it gets wrong characters? I can only assume diffrent encoding?
2009-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	the documentation suggests it uses utf-8 by default, but if it doesn't work for you, definitely do specify it manually
2009-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	is there a way to get the OS to return what encoding is being used?
2009-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	If I mount with no options, then make a folder, it looks fine. Then when I mount as UTF8, its messed up, and vise versa
2009-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	try running the command "mount" (no arguments) in a terminal
2009-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	you need to decide whether you want it mounted as UTF-8 or not, and stick with one or the other; switching between encodings will cause filename corruption
2009-05-16T08:03:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	I understand this. I just want to understand what ecoding is being used by ubuntu/truecrypt :P
2009-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	if you want to know which one is being used at the moment, try running mount
2009-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	Mount shows nothing about encoding. Since I specified nothing, I assume its defaulting to something. it only tells me if I use an option,.
2009-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	/dev/mapper/truecrypt9 on /media/truecrypt9 type vfat (rw,uid=1001,gid=1001,umask=077).... See? nothing
2009-05-16T08:06:00.000Z	MacMoose	sevodnya	unless its using windows-1252 or something gay
2009-05-16T08:06:00.000Z	sevodnya	MacMoose	if it's not showing an option, it's iso-8859-1 -- note that that's a FAT partition, not NTFS.
