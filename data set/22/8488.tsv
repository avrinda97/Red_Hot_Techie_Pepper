2005-10-30T11:21:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	right you are! what a waste. So you'd bette help me with my wlan card! ;)
2005-10-30T11:22:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	you emabarrassed me I know nothing of those cards - seems to be a pain unless you have a natively supported card have a look at this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToSetUpNdiswrapper
2005-10-30T11:23:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	it does not work with ndiswrapper
2006-04-21T11:20:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	what is my GTK?
2006-04-21T11:21:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	the gtk you have installed, try it now and see if it works
2006-04-21T11:22:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	Speicherzugriffsfehler, thats Segmentation Fault, if I'm not mistaken....
2006-04-21T11:23:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	ooch, sudo apt-get remove --purge python-wxgtk2.6 and then install the 2.4 version buit this is guess work
2006-04-21T11:28:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	now I get an attribute error....
2006-04-21T11:30:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	what (a) version of ubuntu are you using (b) what package are you trying use?
2006-04-21T11:30:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	Breezy, it's an assistant program for an online game...
2006-04-21T11:31:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	I can't debug it for two reasons, one I am not a programmer, however I can say that your lack of information means that if anyone else has the same issue they can't tell you because they don't know what the program is
2006-04-21T11:32:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	I know, however, it's not so important. Would have been nice to run the program, but I can do without. Thx anyway
2007-05-19T13:19:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	you have to have access to the source as it is GPLed so what version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-05-19T13:20:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	feisty
2007-05-19T13:21:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	so I suggest that you open synaptic package manager, and then make sure that you have sources included, then search for the source to whatever program you want
2007-05-19T13:21:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	I'm using feisty
2007-05-19T13:22:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	are you sure, I get the sources for kernel 2.6.21 that way?
2007-05-19T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	wam sorry I see it now - ehh no you will have to look to kernel.org and I would strongly suggest you don't go there it may break on you in many interesting and unsupported ways
2007-05-19T13:23:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ompaul	well, I won't try it on a productive system
2007-05-19T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	MonsieurBon	I think it will be very unproductive very very fast
