2007-07-14T12:03:00.000Z	un4get		or i have to reinstall again?!
2007-07-14T12:03:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	do you have a terminal?
2007-07-14T12:04:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	you said you were using a live cd?
2007-07-14T12:04:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	can you open the root folder of your installed system?
2007-07-14T12:05:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	no just the drive you installed to
2007-07-14T12:06:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	you should have a /media/sdaX (or more) icons on your desktop
2007-07-14T12:07:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	if that is the only one, open it
2007-07-14T12:08:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	you want to go to etc
2007-07-14T12:08:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	and from etc you want to click on X11
2007-07-14T12:08:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	so you should be at /media/sda1/etc/X11/
2007-07-14T12:09:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	or something like that
2007-07-14T12:09:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	open up the file xorg.conf
2007-07-14T12:09:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	find the section labled 'device'
2007-07-14T12:10:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	or you could dump the entire thing into the pastebin and i would fix it
2007-07-14T12:10:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	xorg.conf that is
2007-07-14T12:11:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	then you need to log in as root.
2007-07-14T12:11:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	open a terminal
2007-07-14T12:13:00.000Z	ladislaio	un4get	type 'gksu <what the file mananger you use is>'
