2009-08-08T02:54:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	did you check your installation at http://supportdetails.com/ ?
2009-08-09T00:39:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	use the terminal server client
2009-08-09T02:24:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	what is your ubuntu version?
2009-08-09T02:25:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	and from April 2009 + 18 months =???
2009-08-09T02:27:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	i installed it the day before yesterday.
2009-08-09T02:28:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	and if you install 8.04 now, the support will still end in October - but by then you should have upgraded :-)
2009-08-20T21:14:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	what do mean "reset sockets"?
2009-08-20T21:15:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	: In windows, when i used to use uTorrent or bittorrent clients, it possibly corrupted windows sockets, so i had to use this command "netsh reset winsock catalog" to reset it, that would repair the sockets, and i can use the internet normally ....
2009-08-20T21:16:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	:  i switched to ubuntu, about 2 weeks ago, but i am unable to figure out how to reset it :(
2009-08-20T21:16:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	the problem is that .. if i dont reset it, then i get Read Error/ Write Error / Connection Lost, etc. errors ...
2009-08-20T21:17:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	I never heard of that under linux - I'd say no need for this - but maybe someone else has a different notion
2009-08-20T21:18:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	: after i use Bittorrent Client aka Transmission .. i cant use IM protocols or IRC ... :( lag goes high, and i get Connection Lost error on IRC, when using Pidgin, i get Writing Errors all the time :(
2009-08-20T21:19:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	sorry, no help from me there - I *never* saw such behaviour, sipior asked for error messages
2009-08-27T03:36:00.000Z	guntbert	GPL	use the open source driver - runs fine on my x1300
2009-08-27T03:37:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	please link ;) to the PPA
2009-08-27T03:40:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	thanks :P

2009-08-27T03:41:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	thanks, it's really necessary, for me right now
2009-08-27T03:54:00.000Z	GPL	guntbert	it's already installed, but whenever i run something based on OpenGL, the app. flickers a lot
