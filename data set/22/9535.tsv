2005-08-27T13:29:00.000Z	Nexinarus		anyone do c++ coding in here? or am i asking the wrong people?
2005-08-27T13:29:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	kde has a nice ide called kdevelop. i guess you can do it in anjuta as well
2005-08-27T13:36:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	it's big in size and in features
2005-08-27T13:38:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	and have the cd in your sources.list too
2005-08-27T13:38:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	some extensions may not be on it, but those aren't so big
2005-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	have a nice year learning all the features :-)
2005-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	and customizing!
2005-08-27T13:57:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	i would have to agree, but it's one of the greatest programs ever :)
2005-08-27T13:58:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	do "M-x doctor" if you start feeling weird :)
2005-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	hold on while i put my ~/.emacs on the web so you can see too
2005-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	http://siltala.net/comp/dot-emacs -- don't just copy that, but there may be snippets you want
2005-08-27T14:05:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	.emacs in my home directory
2005-08-27T14:06:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	forget the "custom-set-variables" but see the stuff i wrote myself
2005-08-27T14:15:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	gaim has an advantage: beagle is aware of it :)
2005-08-27T14:27:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	i would still have a terminal open for that, or you can use "M-x eshell". or if you're in X, you should have something in the tools menu
2005-08-27T14:27:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	if you're in a C or C++ or whatever mode
2005-08-27T14:28:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	M = ALT key, so alt-x eshell
2005-08-27T14:31:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	if you just want to write some code, try anjuta too
2005-08-27T14:32:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	M=ALT, C=CTRL
2005-08-27T14:36:00.000Z	topyli	Nexinarus	looks good in gnome too :)
