2009-11-11T00:34:00.000Z	saliak		i'm using a dell miniv (with whatever ubuntu customization comes on it).  I have a program i wrote that I can successfully invoke on the command line, but if i add it as a "file" on the shortcut grid, it doesn't start.  another option is to add an "application", but I"m not sure how to get my program on there.  any ideas?  does this make sense?
2009-11-11T00:35:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: maybe add execution right to that file? e.g. : chmod +x <the_file>
2009-11-11T00:36:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	ah, good idea
2009-11-11T00:37:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	nope, doesn't fix it
2009-11-11T00:37:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	already +x
2009-11-11T00:37:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: what program btw? can you give more info?
2009-11-11T00:38:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	i wrote a GUI for some hardware we've developed.  at the command line i can invoke it and it works fine
2009-11-11T00:39:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: in what language?
2009-11-11T00:39:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	no error message or anything
2009-11-11T00:40:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: maybe you need to add the "full" command to the shortcut, e.g. java -jar myprogram.jar
2009-11-11T00:41:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	that's what is in there now.. /home/xitome/RSD/RSD
2009-11-11T00:41:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: what language is that program? C/Java/Ruby?
2009-11-11T00:42:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	ah, got it (sorta).  need to add it as a file, then change it to an "application"
2009-11-11T00:42:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: if it's a shell script, then you'll need to add "sh" in front of it : e.g. "sh /path/to/my/program/myprogram"
2009-11-11T00:43:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	it's not, it's a compiled executable
2009-11-11T00:43:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	how do you make sure it's run from it's directory?
2009-11-11T00:43:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	i have some xpms that are images on buttons, spash screen, etc.  they're not loading since it's running from some random directory
2009-11-11T00:44:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: depends on the source code I suppose, what language it is?
2009-11-11T00:45:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	c++.  this seems like a windowing system setup to me.. like in windws you specify which directory the application lauches in
2009-11-11T00:46:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: sorry I'm not familiar with C++
2009-11-11T00:54:00.000Z	saliak	furuno	http://forum.soft32.com/linux2/Gnome-Defining-Launched-Application-Working-Directory-ftopict54771.html had my solution.  needed to make a shell script to change to the local directory
2009-11-11T00:55:00.000Z	furuno	saliak	: I see...
