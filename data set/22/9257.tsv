2005-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	luc1f3r		I just connected a new hard drive, how do i install it?
2005-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	cfdisk ?
2005-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	what does that do?
2005-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	cfdisk - Curses based disk partition table manipulator for Linux
2005-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	so i typed it, and it gave me the two partitions on my computer, not the new disk, however
2005-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	cfdisk /dev/hdX
2005-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	change X with your new hard disk partition.
2005-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	how do i know what it is? if i have hda already, is it hdb?
2005-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	i think so.
2005-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	i'll try
2005-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	I see this new drive now
2005-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	what do i do with it?
2005-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	cool :)
2005-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	create a new partition should be a good idea
2005-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	it is already partitioned
2005-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	i added a fat32 partition on this drive, and i want it as extra storage
2005-01-17T14:36:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	did you catch that last msg?
2005-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	just search on google.
2005-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	think anyone here knows?
2005-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	sorry but i have to work now.
2005-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	luc1f3r	jadawin	okay , thanks
2005-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	jadawin	luc1f3r	I think, but it's better to search on google.
