2008-02-23T19:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Deeppact	is that the only one there that looks like an audio controller?
2008-02-23T19:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Deeppact	do you have like the "horn" volume adjuster in your taskbar?
2008-02-23T19:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Deeppact	do you have the volume adjuster in your taskbar.. i guess you could say it looks like a speaker, i don't know, looks like a horn to me
