2009-12-22T23:30:00.000Z	Sabre-night		Hey I'm trying to add my HP printer to ubuntu 9.10 and i have installed the drivers and what not, but when it says to actually "add" the printer, the program isn't detecting the printer. (HP PSC 1401 All-in-one)
2009-12-22T23:30:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	 USB or network?
2009-12-22T23:31:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	 USB
2009-12-22T23:31:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	the program being the HP device manager :|
2009-12-22T23:31:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	does the printer show up in lshw or dmesg when you connect it?
2009-12-22T23:32:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	I remember seeing a little message box pop up when i re-connected it.
2009-12-22T23:33:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	is that what you mean?
2009-12-22T23:33:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	 sorry I'm new to Linux, after a life of XP im trying to learn this
2009-12-22T23:33:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	what did the message box say?  Use paste.ubuntu.com to paste it if it is long
2009-12-22T23:36:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	 it was like a notification, it came and went a little quick but i think all it said was basically the system recognizes it, but when i go to the device manager to actually add it, it doesn't show
2009-12-22T23:36:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	 I've tried disconnecting and re-connecting to see if it comes up again and it hasn't
2009-12-22T23:36:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	so there is nothing in System -> Administrationr -> Printing?
2009-12-22T23:38:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	 there is. ( PSC-1401-series, and PSC-1401-Series 2)
2009-12-22T23:39:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	Right click on each of them, select Properties, and then click Print Test Page.  I have a feeling one will work.
2009-12-22T23:42:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	yes the one labled series 2 worked
2009-12-22T23:43:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	Glad to hear it!  Ubuntu is a lot easier than Windows in that regard sometimes, because it can auto-install many drivers from open-source repositories
2009-12-22T23:44:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	so I've heard, its got a lot of fun stuff too :D but now i need the scanner to work on it. because i kinda need that more than the actual printer;;
2009-12-22T23:46:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	Scanner should be similar.  Plug it in, then try running Applications -> Graphics -> XSane Image Scanner
2009-12-22T23:47:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	its a combo with the printer, and when i just attempted, it said no devices found.
2009-12-22T23:48:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	 "No Devices Avaliable"
2009-12-22T23:51:00.000Z	Hyppy	Sabre-night	I'm not particularly knowledgeable with scanners, but https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ScanningHowTo may have some good insights
2009-12-22T23:52:00.000Z	Sabre-night	Hyppy	Thanks
