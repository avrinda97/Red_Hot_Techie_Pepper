2005-10-18T11:00:00.000Z	sdepoote		I have a problem with the nvidia-driver in Breezy.. anyone here who can help me?
2005-10-18T11:00:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	possibly ask away
2005-10-18T11:09:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	did you follow any ubuntu guides or just the guide from the nvidia site?
2005-10-18T11:10:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	yep, tried them both.. (tried some other things too).. but nothing worked... log looks rather fine, no errors and stuff
2005-10-18T11:11:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	btw, it was working fine in warty and hoary...
2005-10-18T11:11:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	k
2005-10-18T11:11:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	I'm not sure about what the problem is.  Without walking through it step by step.
2005-10-18T11:12:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	how about you pick a guide and work your way through it again
2005-10-18T11:12:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	and report here and the process
2005-10-18T11:14:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	this is what I first did (after a clean install of Breezy this morning):
2005-10-18T11:14:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	paste in #flood
2005-10-18T11:16:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	installed nvidia-glx, ran nvidia-glx-config enable and restarted X... this gave me the black screen and no reaction
2005-10-18T11:17:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	and now you are trying to install the commercial drivers?
2005-10-18T11:20:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	I've just tried those.. downloaded NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7667-pkg1.run (latest 7676 gave mismatch), executed it succesfully, changed xorg.conf according to the nvidia readme.. this gave the same result as before
2005-10-18T11:20:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	yes
2005-10-18T11:20:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	bummer...I'm at a loss
2005-10-18T11:21:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	?
2005-10-18T11:22:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	this is all I have for you https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2005-10-18T11:23:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	did that already...
2005-10-18T11:23:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	yeah...sorry..i
2005-10-18T11:24:00.000Z	sdepoote	mustard5	nope ;) tnx for listening ;)
2005-10-18T11:25:00.000Z	mustard5	sdepoote	np
