2009-09-29T19:21:00.000Z	CoolShorts		Hi all
2009-09-29T19:21:00.000Z	CoolShorts		I'm trying to startup Photoshop CS4 (installer worked) but I get these DLL errors: http://pastie.org/634523    (no one knowns in wine channel)
2009-09-29T19:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	download the dlls and put them in WINDOWS\system32
2009-09-29T19:23:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	You mean ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32 right?
2009-09-29T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	its not listed on the appdb so you can pioneer and make notes for others
2009-09-29T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	indeed
2009-09-29T19:24:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=14318&iTestingId=32897
2009-09-29T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	you may have to install http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/corefonts/times32.exe   according to another CS install: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=1815
2009-09-29T19:25:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	it just the problem with the DLLs that's preventing me to startup photoshop
2009-09-29T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	CS 11 (Oct 2008) is rated as garbage
2009-09-29T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	go get em: http://dll-files.com
2009-09-29T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	if you get any result post yur findings in the appdb for others :)
2009-09-29T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	make sure you have wine from the wine repo too
2009-09-29T19:27:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	no! I needed a custom one too make the installer work
2009-09-29T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	ahhh i see
2009-09-29T19:30:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	omg.. http://www.dll-files.com/search.php?s=image_runtime.dll
2009-09-29T19:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	its a great site, used to work in a pc repair shop with idiots running system cleaners an crippling their systems by removing actually useful files
2009-09-29T19:32:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	I got the DLL and placed it both in system32 and it the cs4 folder
2009-09-29T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	yes thats because windows uses C: rubbish, try in the windows directory
2009-09-29T19:34:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	I guess it's virtual
2009-09-29T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CoolShorts	exactly;)
2009-09-29T19:34:00.000Z	CoolShorts	ActionParsnip	well I'm in: /home/bart/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32
