2011-02-04T00:27:00.000Z	thehumanerror		I think you have to have tasksel installed, because I can't find it any more
2011-02-04T00:28:00.000Z	thehumanerror		as I removed it after I found that feature!
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	thehumanerror		It's not in Desktop
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	thehumanerror		at least, my fresh 10.10 amd64 box doesn't have it
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	thehumanerror		yeah
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	thehumanerror		you know
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	thehumanerror		you can look in /etc
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	thehumanerror		to see what the "tasks" do
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	thehumanerror		that might help
2011-02-04T00:30:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	Quick question for you... Do you have a nVidia graphics card? If so, did you have any problems installing the 64-bit 10.10?
2011-02-04T00:31:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	Ah, okay. Just that I'm having problems even installing with my new computer.
2011-02-04T00:34:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	When I try to install from boot CD, I get the purple loading page fine, no problems. Then, when it should show the CD's menu, I instead get some jumbled up image of whatever I last was doing before reboot (such as desktop mixed in with media player). It also becomes unresponsive, as in I tried pressing enter to see if anything happens, and it doesn't.
2011-02-04T00:34:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	I'm checked the md5sum of the ISO, which was fine, I'm now checking the CD to see if that is the problem.
2011-02-04T00:36:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	Yeah, it just finished checking - checksum matches. So I'm not sure what the problem could be.
2011-02-04T00:37:00.000Z	thehumanerror	ConvolutedMusing	So, have you used this hardware with Linux before?
2011-02-04T00:39:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	Well, I have ubuntu 10.04 installed at the moment (I'm on the hardware now), but it's on an addition - internal - HDD and was installed on my previous computer.
2011-02-04T00:39:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	Shouldn't be any loose connections, also have no Windows boot disc.
2011-02-04T00:40:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	I have, however, tried two different ISOs - I originally was going to stay 10.04 - and both do the exact same thing.
2011-02-04T00:43:00.000Z	thehumanerror	ConvolutedMusing	Sorry chap, can't think of anything. You help ubun, I'll scroll up to A_J
2011-02-04T00:45:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	The only thing I can think of for my problem is that it has something to do with the graphics card - first time I've had a dedicated graphics card as I'm not a gamer really.
2011-02-04T00:45:00.000Z	ConvolutedMusing	thehumanerror	Thanks for helping though :)
