2011-03-22T16:51:00.000Z	Esing		i wonder if i can make Wake on Lan working to shutdown my computer on ubuntu
2011-03-22T16:52:00.000Z	terry	Esing	What exactly are you wanting to do?  Shut down at a prescribed time?  Or remotely shut down.
2011-03-22T16:54:00.000Z	terry	Esing	ssh user@192.168.1.5 shutdown now
2011-03-22T16:54:00.000Z	terry	Esing	ssh user@192.168.1.5 halt
2011-03-22T16:54:00.000Z	terry	Esing	ssh user@192.168.1.5 sudo shutdown now
2011-03-22T16:54:00.000Z	terry	Esing	ssh user@192.168.1.5 sudo halt
2011-03-22T16:56:00.000Z	terry	Esing	ssh user@192.168.1.5 and then sudo halt
2011-03-22T17:01:00.000Z	terry	Esing	putty
2011-03-22T17:01:00.000Z	terry	Esing	If you want VNC try tightvnc
2011-03-22T17:02:00.000Z	terry	Esing	putty is for MS Windows
2011-03-22T17:14:00.000Z	terry	Esing	You mean vnc?   If so.  x11vnc for server end and tightvnc for client.
2011-03-22T17:16:00.000Z	terry	Esing	Yes
2011-03-22T17:17:00.000Z	terry	Esing	and have x11vnc started with the --forever switch
2011-03-22T17:17:00.000Z	terry	Esing	That is correct.
2011-03-22T17:17:00.000Z	terry	Esing	Or, correct it wouldn't matter which you use, either will do fine.
2011-03-22T17:18:00.000Z	terry	Esing	You may not have sshd but ssh is installed by default
2011-03-22T17:19:00.000Z	terry	Esing	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2011-03-22T17:19:00.000Z	terry	Esing	sudo apt-get install openssh-server x11vnc
2011-03-22T17:21:00.000Z	terry	Esing	openssh-server is the deamon (sshd)
2011-03-22T17:22:00.000Z	terry	Esing	What I gave you was a command to install openssh-server and x11vnc (to install both at once - with one command).
2011-03-22T17:22:00.000Z	terry	Esing	sudo apt-get install openssh-server x11vnc
