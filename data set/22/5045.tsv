2010-05-01T17:06:00.000Z	K-4U		Help! I've started a dist upgrade, but now it keeps hanging at "Memtest86+ is being prepared"
2010-05-01T17:08:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	have you made a backup before you triggered the upgrade?
2010-05-01T17:08:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	no.. unfortunately i didn't
2010-05-01T17:10:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	... greetings from Murphys Law. What version are you upgrading from?
2010-05-01T17:11:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	err.. 9.10
2010-05-01T17:11:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	using the update-manager or the console?
2010-05-01T17:11:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	update-manager
2010-05-01T17:14:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	see /var/log/apt/term.log to get a clue what might be wrong
2010-05-01T17:15:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	there's nothing in there..
2010-05-01T17:16:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	are ther archived files in that dir (with a quite recent time-stamp)?
2010-05-01T17:17:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	the timestamp on the files archived, are from 2 days ago
2010-05-01T17:17:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	shouldn't i be looking in the /var/log/dist-upgrade folder?
2010-05-01T17:18:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	ok, so it seems that update-manager hasn't logged anything useful. SInce it hangs anyway you probably have no choice other than killing it and sort out the damage manually
2010-05-01T17:19:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	Okay then.. let's try to kill it and restart it again.. hopefully nothing will be badly damaged! Thanks for the help! :)
2010-05-01T17:19:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	don't run update-manager yet, try sudo apt-get -f install first
2010-05-01T17:21:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	a dpkg --reconfigure -a also triggered some installing things.
2010-05-01T17:23:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	good. the idea is to fix broken dependencies and configure pending packages before you retry to do an upgrade. Maybe it that even completes the upgrade by itself
2010-05-01T17:23:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	Normally, the update didn't give me any trouble...
2010-05-01T17:26:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	you should be wise enough to know 2 things: 1.) never do anything potentially dangerous without a backup. 2.) ubuntu releases are time-based. This implies: not ready yet, not well-tested. sysadmins always wait at least 4 weeks before they upgrade :-\
2010-05-01T17:27:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	Yeah.. i know.. well.. it wouldn't be that bad if i lost linux right now.. i only installed it 4 days ago
2010-05-01T17:27:00.000Z	stefg	K-4U	you might consider a clean reinstall then anyway
2010-05-01T17:28:00.000Z	K-4U	stefg	well.. lets just hope this all works out right :)
