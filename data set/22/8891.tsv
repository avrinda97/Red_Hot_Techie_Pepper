2008-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	defendguin	nickrud	that didn't work
2008-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	nickrud	defendguin	assuming you're using a sudo account
2008-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	defendguin	nickrud	my account is set up in sudo
2008-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	nickrud	defendguin	are you in the lpadmin group ?
2008-01-19T22:44:00.000Z	nickrud	defendguin	anyway, I just used my admin account to delete a printer I don't use anymore
2008-01-19T22:45:00.000Z	defendguin	nickrud	i seem to be missing the local printers class
2008-01-19T22:45:00.000Z	nickrud	defendguin	I have no local printer class, that's not really what classes are for
2008-01-19T22:47:00.000Z	defendguin	nickrud	i don't know what happened  i installed the fooxqx driver as per the instructions listed here http://foo2xqx.rkkda.com/INSTALL   which includes this sudo make install install-hotplug cups   i'm not 100% but i don't think i have an option to install a local printer now
2008-01-19T22:48:00.000Z	nickrud	defendguin	hm, don't know that one. I buy generic hp printers, I'm chicken
2008-01-19T22:49:00.000Z	defendguin	nickrud	this is a generic hp laser printer
2008-01-19T22:49:00.000Z	nickrud	defendguin	then why not use the driver already in cups with hpijs?
2008-01-19T22:50:00.000Z	defendguin	nickrud	my printer model is not in cups as having a recommended driver
2008-01-19T22:50:00.000Z	nickrud	defendguin	ah. not generic then :) I pretty much refuse to compile stuff anymore I"m lazy
