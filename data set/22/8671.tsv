2005-11-02T13:39:00.000Z	BlueT_		hello everybody :)
2005-11-02T13:41:00.000Z	BlueT_		I'm mirroring security.ubuntu.com and archive.ubuntu.com
2005-11-02T13:41:00.000Z	BlueT_		but it seens that they're all the same?
2005-11-02T13:43:00.000Z	BlueT_		can anyone tell me what's the difference between the two? (security.ubuntu.com and archive.ubuntu.com) @@"
2005-11-02T13:45:00.000Z	BlueT_		i want to mirror both archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com
2005-11-02T13:45:00.000Z	BlueT_		but my HDD already full
2005-11-02T13:45:00.000Z	bob2	BlueT_	that's great
2005-11-02T13:46:00.000Z	bob2	BlueT_	so don't mirror the whole thing
2005-11-02T13:46:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	do you know what's the different between archive.ubuntu.com and archive.ubuntu.com? @@?
2005-11-02T13:47:00.000Z	bob2	BlueT_	uh, one has security updates, one has the archive?
2005-11-02T13:47:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	coz it seens all the same.. :(
2005-11-02T13:48:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	but security.ubuntu.com has archive too @@"
2005-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	and they cost the same hdd space..... (almost the same, i guess)
2005-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	coz the connection between me and security.ubuntu.com is very slow
2005-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	bob2	BlueT_	they're all in the sambe building
2005-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	bob2	BlueT_	probably in the same rack
2005-11-02T13:53:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	so i haven't finished mirror security :(
2005-11-02T13:54:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	so, maybe i should just give up mirroring security.ubuntu.com ? :S
2005-11-02T13:55:00.000Z	bob2	BlueT_	yes
2005-11-02T13:55:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	okay, thanx :)
2005-11-02T13:56:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	btw, i'm mirroring them on apt.ubuntu.org.tw :)
2005-11-02T13:56:00.000Z	BlueT_	bob2	nice to meet you ^_^
