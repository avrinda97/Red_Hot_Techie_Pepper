2011-09-21T01:20:00.000Z	TL1		HELP !
2011-09-21T01:20:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	could you be more specific?
2011-09-21T01:21:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	I boot my kernel and i see nothing.
2011-09-21T01:21:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	even on recovery mode
2011-09-21T01:23:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	so you see nothing at all from the moment it begins booting?
2011-09-21T01:24:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	grub menu then nothing
2011-09-21T01:26:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	I can notice some hard disk actvity then null
2011-09-21T01:27:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	I've been playing with the system all day and i shrinked it
2011-09-21T01:27:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	yap
2011-09-21T01:27:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	yes
2011-09-21T01:28:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	im not a ubuntu god
2011-09-21T01:31:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	you may have to zero all the secotrs in the extfs partition and do a reinstall
2011-09-21T01:35:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	do you have yet any important data on the extfs parition?
2011-09-21T01:37:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	if your install worked before the shrinking, and if you don't have any irreplacable data on the extfs partition, it might probably be less effort to erase and start over than to figure out the problem
2011-09-21T01:40:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	fair enough
2011-09-21T01:41:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	is there anyway to do this ?
2011-09-21T01:52:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	i don't have one if i reinstalled should i create one
2011-09-21T01:57:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	oh i meant a seperate one
2011-09-21T01:58:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	if you can boot from the cd, perhaps you might copy all the update files off the extfs parition to one of the ntfs partitions, and then erase and do a clean install?
2011-09-21T02:00:00.000Z	TL1	msilviera	i dont know where are they ,2- replacing the old ones would do the trick ?
2011-09-21T02:09:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	it should say in your apt.conf where the default directory was that apt-get places all your packages
2011-09-21T02:35:00.000Z	msilviera	TL1	if your installation is too far hosed, a reinstall maybe the olnly way
