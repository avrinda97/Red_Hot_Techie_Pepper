2007-05-28T10:21:00.000Z	g0ow		i have Feisty installed and Dapper, along with windows XP...i have no need for dapper anymore...so can i just delete the dapper partition and leave it like that, or will i still need to mess with the MBR?
2007-05-28T10:22:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	you will need to mess with the mbr. fixmbr in a windows recovery console for example
2007-05-28T10:50:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	what's the problem you enocunter?
2007-05-28T10:53:00.000Z	g0ow	wols	i select the dapper partition and go to Partition->Format To->ext3, and then it will error me telling me that it can not do it
2007-05-28T10:53:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	and why not?
2007-05-28T10:54:00.000Z	g0ow	wols	what do you mean? 0.o
2007-05-28T10:54:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	do you run gparted as root?
2007-05-28T10:55:00.000Z	g0ow	wols	i believe so...it asked me for admin pass
2007-05-28T10:55:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	is the dapper partition still mounted?
2007-05-28T10:55:00.000Z	g0ow	wols	i don't think so
2007-05-28T10:56:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	doN't "think", check
2007-05-28T10:56:00.000Z	g0ow	wols	no...it's not mounted
2007-05-28T10:57:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	then what else does the error say except it cannot do it?
2007-05-28T10:57:00.000Z	g0ow	wols	may i PM you?
2007-05-28T10:58:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	no
2007-05-28T10:59:00.000Z	g0ow	wols	it show's the filesystem to be unknown...now i can't format or delete it...
2007-05-28T10:59:00.000Z	wols	g0ow	use and fdisk program, delete the partition. recreate it, format it
