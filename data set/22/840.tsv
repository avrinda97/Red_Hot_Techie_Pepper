2011-03-01T05:43:00.000Z	sysadm		hello, i have ubuntu iso, i have ubuntu already installed, but i want to install again [new installation], but i only have 1 disk, what do i do URGENT....
2011-03-01T05:44:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	if you just install it again from the liveCD, that would work, but you would loose your settings
2011-03-01T05:45:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	there is no cd, no usb, no floppy
2011-03-01T05:45:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	 you're talking netbook here? Or server perhaps?
2011-03-01T05:45:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	server
2011-03-01T05:47:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	I'm afraid you'll need either physical access or access through a serial line connected to your server. On top of that you'll need to able to (re)start your server from WakeOnLAN, or WakeOnCall
2011-03-01T05:48:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	i have limited cloud access to server, i can see installation process and set it up, but cant insert any cd
2011-03-01T05:48:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	i just need to work with what i have, ssh and console
2011-03-01T05:48:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	could you mount a remote ISO image on the loopback device?
2011-03-01T05:48:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	yes i can
2011-03-01T05:51:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	if you have full root access, you might add an extra option to GRUB/ lilo that enables you to boot the remote image.
2011-03-01T05:51:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	i cudnt get that to work, using grub 2, if you can help do that
2011-03-01T05:52:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	iso needs to be in ram all time, as all drives will be formatted
2011-03-01T05:52:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	sorry, I don't have that advanced knowledge, only trying to brainstorm along with you.
2011-03-01T05:52:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	thanks :)
2011-03-01T05:53:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	if your Cloud system works anything like a VPS, you would need access to a metaserver/ superserver that has direct control over the node you are trying to install
2011-03-01T05:54:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	unmanaged cloud, no one there till end of march
2011-03-01T05:54:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	if it concerns a physical server, you would *need* a physical serial line between superserver and target server.
2011-03-01T05:56:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	sysadm	You can't just "start" a Cloud system without having setup a superserver/ controller that manages your virtual target server without physical access, afaik
2011-03-01T05:57:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	i know, its not my cloud, i only have 1 server tehre
2011-03-01T05:57:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	i wasn't given much, but i try to work with available resources
2011-03-01T06:10:00.000Z	sysadm	Stereocaulon	:)
