2008-03-21T10:28:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	I read back, probably the reason you got missed is your question is scattered all over. Don't use enter as punctuation. And, try  sudo umount
2008-03-21T10:28:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	what applet?
2008-03-21T10:29:00.000Z	e_r_c_e	nikrud	i used sudo, else you can't mount/dismount
2008-03-21T10:29:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	does   mount  | sort show the partition as mounted
2008-03-21T10:30:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	then the applet is wrong
2008-03-21T10:31:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	does it show as mounted in the output of    mount   ?
2008-03-21T10:31:00.000Z	e_r_c_e	nikrud	yes, it did
2008-03-21T10:32:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	do you have a terminal open somewhere under /media/usb_d ?
2008-03-21T10:33:00.000Z	e_r_c_e	nikrud	i already typed to umount so place /media/usb_d exist, but it's empty
2008-03-21T10:33:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	what output does    sudo umount /media/usb_d  give ?
2008-03-21T10:33:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	that's normal
2008-03-21T10:34:00.000Z	nikrud	e_r_c_e	then thats correct. you still have the dir /media/usb_d , it's existence is required for mount to have a place to put the partition.
