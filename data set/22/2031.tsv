2010-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	earthling_		hi, my sound has stopped working after a computer restart. How do I fix it?
2010-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	earthling_		I don't think so
2010-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	earthling_		on the icon the "mute all" is light
2010-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	earthling_		the red bar is medium
2010-09-20T08:21:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	did you install any new softwares before you rebooted?
2010-09-20T08:22:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	 speaker-test -c 2 -t wav
2010-09-20T08:23:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	yes, this is a direct alsa test, bypassing pulse

2010-09-20T08:25:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	you heard nothing?
2010-09-20T08:28:00.000Z	earthling_	thune3	it may be related, I can no longer use my usb drive
2010-09-20T08:34:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	i'm guessing you need to set SPDIF or IEC9?? to mute, also check if something is hogging the sound devices, only pulse should be listed: sudo fuser -v /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/* /dev/seq*
2010-09-20T08:38:00.000Z	earthling_	thune3	nothing is listed after that command list
2010-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	oh. does the following list something : aplay -l
2010-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	earthling_	thune3	aplay: device_list:223: no soundcards found...
2010-09-20T08:46:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	oh, sounds like kernel modules aren't loaded: lsmod | grep snd

2010-09-20T08:50:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	that looks fine. i'm getting more confues. Did you try rebooting, i would prefer to debug on another boot, since something seems inconsistent.
2010-09-20T08:53:00.000Z	earthling_	thune3	I logged out and back in, does rebooting affect the hardware differently? I hadn't rebooted in a long while, I just do log out/log in when I install new programs and updates
2010-09-20T08:56:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	sound setup is done through boot scripts, you would need a complete reboot (there are other ways though) to get sound reset.
2010-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	earthling_	thune3	it works now :P   I also had trouble rebooting had to do "sudo reboot"
2010-09-20T09:07:00.000Z	thune3	earthling_	cool
2010-09-20T09:08:00.000Z	earthling_	thune3	thanks for the help
