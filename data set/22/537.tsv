2011-08-02T23:01:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		<ThinkT510> I already have it on a USB, but I am having trouble skipping the Installer, is there a way to bypass the installer?
2011-08-02T23:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Eiriksvinr	it sounds to me you want a persistant install (not a liveusb install)
2011-08-02T23:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510		!usb | Eiriksvinr
2011-08-02T23:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Eiriksvinr	see the last link there?
2011-08-02T23:02:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		yeah, I see it
2011-08-02T23:02:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		I'm checking into it now
2011-08-02T23:02:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		thanks
2011-08-02T23:07:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		Ok, I'm looking into the best option for being a stand alone mobile Ubuntu and the Startup Disk creator option seems to be the best, does it save all of my settings, and can it be used on any computer (so long as its compatible)?
2011-08-02T23:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Eiriksvinr	it will boot on any pc that can boot from usb (and is set to do so in the bios)
2011-08-02T23:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510		id
2011-08-02T23:09:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr	ThinkT510	right, thats what I'm looking for
2011-08-02T23:10:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr	ThinkT510	its easy to hit f2 or esc or whatever and change the boot options temporarily, or even perm, but I just needed to know that
2011-08-02T23:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Eiriksvinr	good stuff :) enjoy your persistant install
2011-08-02T23:12:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr	ThinkT510	my only problem is, when I drop my USB into my home PC I can't access the files I download and I have to sync my Firefox all the time
2011-08-02T23:13:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		I have to boot my USB, transfer files, restart, then transfer them again
2011-08-02T23:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Eiriksvinr	you should be able to access whatever you download
2011-08-02T23:13:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		Ok, so the new persistant USB will fix that?
2011-08-02T23:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Eiriksvinr	yes, the persistant install is practically the same as a harddisk install
2011-08-02T23:16:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr	ThinkT510	this is going to be great, I'll just dump all the language packages, and junk I don't need, clean it up so It's as small as I can get it... then run from there
2011-08-02T23:17:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		I wonder if it would work well on an 8gb+ usb, cause I can just get like a 32gb and that would be perfect
2011-08-02T23:18:00.000Z	Eiriksvinr		I have a 500gb USB Desktop HDD will it work on that?
2011-08-02T23:18:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Eiriksvinr	should work fine (my harddisk installs are always under 10gb)
