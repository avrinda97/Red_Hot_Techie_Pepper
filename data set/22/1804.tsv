2010-05-12T01:17:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak		I'm behind on the game. I thought they only went up to ext3

2010-05-12T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	not sure, but rather big indeed
2010-05-12T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	I think it can deal with like 100TB files or something
2010-05-12T01:20:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	sebsebseb	yeah well ext3 is very big to
2010-05-12T01:22:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	sebsebseb	nice that should be good for quite some time
2010-05-12T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	16TB not 100TB
2010-05-12T01:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	you will have to download again
2010-05-12T01:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	you could do sha1sum and sha2sum or whatever that other one is, as well
2010-05-12T01:34:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	sebsebseb	thanks I'm aware of that info I was really hoping I could avoid downloading again I'll have to do it later on better connection
2010-05-12T01:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	did you by mistake message me just then or?

2010-05-12T01:55:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	sebsebseb	I would have to say if that is the case then use good for netbooks and other light hardware.
2010-05-12T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	shame about standard Ubuntu really, netbook version looks so much better
2010-05-12T01:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	i'll install desktop, and customize a bit here and  there, and maybe remove some apps
2010-05-12T01:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LinuxPhreak	however that's other computer now,  and depends on user.  on this one I use another distro these days :)
