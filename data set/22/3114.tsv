2008-12-21T11:09:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa		output of the ﻿dpkg --configure -a command? nothing goes back to user@computer:~$ is dpkg one of the commands that has to be run without sudo?
2008-12-21T11:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	Richard M Stallman here, at your service
2008-12-21T11:12:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	open for suggestions
2008-12-21T11:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	a dpkg -l command does not require sudo... however, a command like  dpkg --configure - a  ...does
2008-12-21T11:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	what is the output of   sudo dpkg --configure -a  ...?
2008-12-21T11:14:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	sudo dpkg --configure -a returned nothing just went back to user@computer:~$  and raylu: one sec will run again
2008-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	yes..do,   apt-get -f install
2008-12-21T11:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	you have to learn to use a 'pastebin'
2008-12-21T11:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	nothing wrong with your system that i can see.. neither dpkg nor apt-get is complaining
2008-12-21T11:21:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	 i was reading it the same, yet add/remove programs gives me the same error code after 3 methods i've tried to fix broken packages and i went through the whole of all available applications so it really sux that its giving me this error as my eyes went bugy going through it all :)
2008-12-21T11:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	so, it's all now? update-manager isn't complainin either, correct?
2008-12-21T11:23:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	nope just finished update manager before i went to add/remove programs
2008-12-21T11:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	ok, good! :-)
2008-12-21T11:30:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	went to applications menu > add/remove... selected all available applications from drop down menu... went through everything to check the apps i wanted for installation and it gave me the error ﻿Could not apply changes! fix broken packages first. did synaptic > edit > fix broken packages hit retry in add/remove, same error... did sudo apt-get install -f in terminal as well as sudo dpkg --configure -a... retry 
2008-12-21T11:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	perhaps i misunderstood, is it still giving you trouble?
2008-12-21T11:34:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	yes still giving problems, and wow that was interesting, my first netsplit :D
2008-12-21T11:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	perhaps you should learn to use 'aptitude' to start off with
2008-12-21T11:37:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	i really like the convenience of gui for mass installs
2008-12-21T11:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	yes..
2008-12-21T11:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	and i hear you about the gui being very nice for mass installs. it nice because you get a great view of it all
2008-12-21T11:42:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	KRaZy_WaKa	ok, raylu hit me with cluebat.. apt-get is the back end to synaptic. but dpkg handles the actuall install and uninstalling of individual packages
2008-12-21T11:44:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	onetinsoldier	and add/remove is a "prettier" gui for synaptic application install/removal
