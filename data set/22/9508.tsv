2005-09-27T08:51:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		can anyone recommend a graphics card/chipset that has good performance in Ubuntu and doesn't require proprietary drivers for accelerated 3D? (I'm not a hardcore gamer, so to me "good performance" means "Quake 3 runs smoothly")
2005-09-27T08:52:00.000Z	nathan_	Ex-Cyber	some of the older ATI cards had decent DRI driver support
2005-09-27T08:53:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	nathan_	define "older". I'm running a Radeon 8500 now and redraws are slow enough to be disruptive
2005-09-27T08:55:00.000Z	nathan_	Ex-Cyber	apparently the radeons up to the 9200 were had their secs released to the DRI project.  My original radeon wasn't too bad for a card of the time.  But I've been using a GeForce 4 for a while now
2005-09-27T08:55:00.000Z	nathan_		specs == specs
2005-09-27T08:55:00.000Z	nathan_		secs == specs, even
2005-09-27T08:56:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	nathan_	in any case Ubuntu doesn't seem to like my card, which supposedly has good 2D support
2005-09-27T08:56:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		I was thinking about replacing it, but I guess there aren't really many other options besides R2xx
2005-09-27T08:57:00.000Z	nathan_		hmm... Sorry Ex-Cyber, can't help then :(
2005-09-27T08:58:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		it seems like a handful of people have "this problem" (i.e. slow redraws) but the actual underlying problem always seems to be different, and proprietary drivers are involved for most of them
2005-09-27T08:58:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		so I don't really know where to go from here
2005-09-27T08:58:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		cafuego: I think that depends on what you mean by "decent"
2005-09-27T08:59:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		I don't need to run Doom 3
2005-09-27T08:59:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		cafuego: I don't notice much of a problem with 3D with this card, just 2D
2005-09-27T08:59:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		cafuego: huh?
2005-09-27T09:00:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		cafuego: I'm not using fglrx, and don't intend to
2005-09-27T09:01:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		I want a card with DRI Project drivers, even if that means I don't get to run the latest whiz-bang id engine
2005-09-27T09:01:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		which is part of the reason that I haven't swapped this one out for so long
2005-09-27T09:01:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		3D performance is not an issue for me with my current card
2005-09-27T09:01:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		but apparently there are 2D problems
2005-09-27T09:02:00.000Z	nathan_	Ex-Cyber	is it an ideaological issue with binary drivers, or do you have technical issues with them?
2005-09-27T09:03:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	nathan_	both
