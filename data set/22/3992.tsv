2008-04-15T10:45:00.000Z	inacoma`		Yeah, seems like it
2008-04-15T10:45:00.000Z	inacoma`		could it be only accepting one or two connections?
2008-04-15T10:45:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	yeah, it could be your connection
2008-04-15T10:40:00.000Z	inacoma`	leo_rockw	Would you be able to try that DNS again?
2008-04-15T10:41:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	sure
2008-04-15T10:41:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	unknown host
2008-04-15T10:42:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	working now
2008-04-15T10:42:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	if i put http:// and the / at the end it doesn't work
2008-04-15T10:44:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	now it's working even with the http://
2008-04-15T10:44:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	good job :-D
2008-04-15T10:45:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	it's weird. it works sporadically
2008-04-15T10:45:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	how's your upload speed?
2008-04-15T10:46:00.000Z	inacoma`	leo_rockw	my ISP is gay with upload speeds
2008-04-15T10:46:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	that might be the problem then
2008-04-15T10:48:00.000Z	leo_rockw	inacoma`	then maybe some cheap hosting might be your solution
2008-04-15T10:49:00.000Z	inacoma`	leo_rockw	I have hosting :) I am just working through this because it's easier to test / view locally than upload every time (with databases, too)... it won't be common that people look at it just if it's needed it's be good to get it working :D but thanks for the help :)
