2005-03-19T17:06:00.000Z	Rocco		how can i grab files on a windows-pc where a username and password is needed? does the windows-pc have to add me as user?
2005-03-19T17:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	try entering garbage first
2005-03-19T17:07:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	where?
2005-03-19T17:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	for the username and password, try entering anything
2005-03-19T17:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	if that doesn't work, try admin and the password
2005-03-19T17:09:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	try the command line client - smbclient //WINDOWSPC/SHARE
2005-03-19T17:10:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	at the moment the windows-pc is not on line
2005-03-19T17:11:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	In order to access the share you will need to have it on
2005-03-19T17:11:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	are you trying to mount something for a dual boot machine?
2005-03-19T17:12:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	no, the windows-machine has "given free" some files, which i want to see and load onto my pc
2005-03-19T17:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	ok, give the commandline client a shot, and see if that works. smb browsing under nautilus is sometimes borked
2005-03-19T17:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	try to use the cli version to test to see if you can get to the machine
2005-03-19T17:14:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	so "smbclient //windowspcname/dir/" will show me the files, right?
2005-03-19T17:14:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	it should, if it doesn't try -u and add a username and it should prompt for the password
2005-03-19T17:15:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	how does a network works? why do i need samba for windows-networks? is it a protokoll? can i also build up a pure linux-network with samba? what is the advantage?
2005-03-19T17:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	samba is for accessing ServerMessageBlock systems, a windows protocol for passing files between systems
2005-03-19T17:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	that is what windows shares talk to each other
2005-03-19T17:17:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	and what does linux use?
2005-03-19T17:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	A variety of systems. The most common is NFS or Network File System
2005-03-19T17:22:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	one more question please ;) .... how can i serve files and printers (with ubuntu)
2005-03-19T17:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Rocco	that is going beyond what I can tell you easily. Google samba file and printer sharing. There are some good docs out there
2005-03-19T17:23:00.000Z	Rocco	Burgundavia	thanks very much! cu
