2008-10-05T23:10:00.000Z	chamunks		anyone know how to set up an intrusion detection system that can point me in a good direction to get it installed preferably snort
2008-10-05T23:10:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	#snort
2008-10-05T23:11:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	i would but my current issue with it is more ubuntu based than snort specific.
2008-10-05T23:13:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	whats the question?
2008-10-05T23:14:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	well i've installed snort, acidbase, and acidlab via apt but they say to navigate my browser to http://localhost/acidbase and /acidlab/ but neither url's work.
2008-10-05T23:14:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	I'm not familiar with acidbase and acid lab, are these packages related to ACID?
2008-10-05T23:15:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	now this might not have anything to do with anything but i've found apache.conf files in /etc/acidlab and /etc/acidbase plus a few .php files
2008-10-05T23:15:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	well as far as my research has mentioned these two work with snort
2008-10-05T23:16:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	are they ACID packages?
2008-10-05T23:16:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	ill look closer within synaptic for a description.
2008-10-05T23:16:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	if they are I'd remove them, and replace it with BASE.
2008-10-05T23:17:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	ACID is hopelessly outdated
2008-10-05T23:17:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	that might be why im having trouble.
2008-10-05T23:18:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	also note that ubuntu is not up to date with snort, and you may find building from scratch a better more usuable snort.
2008-10-05T23:19:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	hmm well thats not outside the possabilities i wouldnt mind kicking around this vm im toying with first.
2008-10-05T23:21:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	there is a doc on snort.org called 'how to build on debian' it works fine for ubuntu and will help.
2008-10-05T23:22:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	i've poked at that from time to time but compiling from source sometimes becomes somewhat intimidating for me but ill give it another run if you say it looks promising.
2008-10-05T23:24:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	well I won't say it isn't daunting, but it does work fine and you can get the current version as well.
2008-10-05T23:25:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	fair enough is it that 11step .pdf something like that?
2008-10-05T23:26:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	ya 10, 11 ;)
2008-10-05T23:27:00.000Z	chamunks	Jeruvy	so i suppose i should remove the .debs i've installed than...
2008-10-05T23:29:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chamunks	yes, if you go for the build, then remove the debs, but some you may keep like libdumbnet or libpcap
