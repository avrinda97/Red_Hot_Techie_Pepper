2011-12-15T15:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	that was ravishingly easy! thanks! :)
2011-12-15T15:14:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	No problem
2011-12-15T15:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	one more: do you happen to know whether this works with all wireless adapters or do I require some special ones?
2011-12-15T15:17:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	Should work with all of those which work in Ubuntu
2011-12-15T15:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	almost too nice to be true:)
2011-12-15T15:18:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	Linux is simple ;)
2011-12-15T15:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	well from my position as a linux admin i have to oppose to that! :D
2011-12-15T15:19:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	Hey, I used Arch and Gentoo and I still find Linux simplier than Windows :P
2011-12-15T15:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	well i am windows certified, and i use linux practically exclusively. but not for reasons of simplicity :D
2011-12-15T15:22:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	I define simple as "Without unnecessary additions or complications"
2011-12-15T15:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	sry for the late response, boss... : well complications i had plenty, i could not complain about that, just to give a few hints: open-xchange greoupware server, freeradius with missing enries in sites-enabled because the debian packager forgot them, SSL that all of a sudden produces well known sets instead of random keys, etc... ;)
2011-12-15T15:45:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	erm... my boss was here i meant...
2011-12-15T15:46:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	lol well... Sorry about that
2011-12-15T15:47:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	well... thats just the way things are and it doesnt make too much of a difference to me whether ms messed it up or the linux community... what shall I say, millions of code lines, it is complicated... *g*
2011-12-15T15:49:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	Because Ubuntu and many other distros add unnecessary additions. Those GUIs make stuff heavy and confusing
2011-12-15T15:50:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	gui is another completely different page... i was really only talking about the cli stuff, dude :) but lets continue this in #ubuntu-offtopic :)
2011-12-15T15:51:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	I hate that channel, I'd rather use a PM session if you don't mind. Also, "dude" is not a valid way to address girls.
2011-12-15T15:52:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	first of all PM is ok for me, and secondly sorry, gal in that case :D
2012-01-03T16:27:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	Yep, XFCE's the way to go... KDE too, looks like Windows after all :D
2012-01-03T16:28:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	theadmin	hi there gal!
2012-01-03T16:28:00.000Z	theadmin	remoteCTRL	Hey.
