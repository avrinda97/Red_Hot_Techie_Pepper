2006-03-30T11:30:00.000Z	NigelS		iirc vanilla wine will run WoW now - though not 100% on that; there are guides out there to follow for it
2006-03-30T11:31:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	I just cba with it, I'd much rather just plug and play with cedega ;)
2006-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	hmm, cedega is not always as plug and play as it should be; quite often it's play - oh dear the game's been patched, time for another work around so go and edit that text file to avoid the nasty memory issue etc :)
2006-03-30T11:33:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	I also think for some supported titles like BF2 etc, it's a little rich to say they work when most servers are unavailable given that they require anti-cheating software that does not work yet
2006-03-30T11:33:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	yeah, but that's just the nature of things being patched, at least it works for most of the stuff most of the time
2006-03-30T11:33:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	yes, that's poor
2006-03-30T11:34:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	I'd prefer native versions, but I know that's very difficult sometimes
2006-03-30T11:34:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	I accept that it's part of the chasing game we'll have to play but still, it's not 100% plug and play all the time, it can get messy as any subscriber will tell you :)
2006-03-30T11:34:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	yeah, only the idealists and there are few of them seem to do it now
2006-03-30T11:34:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	yes, true, but it is PnP for Wow :)
2006-03-30T11:35:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	I was trying onthe game I'm working on, but it seems it's becoming impossible for some complex reasons
2006-03-30T11:35:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	the example I gave was for WoW :) and that memory issue that prevented right clicking with the mouse was there for a good few months - the lastest cedega version has new mem management so avoids it
2006-03-30T11:36:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	I've only used the latest version. I think they should say that it works with a specific version, and make sure they're not lying :)
2006-03-30T11:38:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	heh yeah; in the few years I've subscribed I think the punkbuster issue is the only one to seriously annoy me
2006-03-30T11:38:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	yes, it's pretty stupid.
2006-03-30T11:38:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	I started the voting on PB months and months back - at the time I was annoyed about BF one!
2006-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	The game I'm working on is based on Unrel Engine 3, so technically we should be able to doa linux version, but we're using some closed source win32 libs which could scupper that idea
2006-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	but they never acknowledged it as an issue; even with it being towards the top of the voting ranks for months upon end
2006-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	it's poor
2006-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	it's the only thing that's made me think of unsubscribing
2006-03-30T11:40:00.000Z	NigelS	bobbyd_	yeah same here - that same annoying advice in the changelogs saying that we should update it was starting to get to me :P
2006-03-30T11:43:00.000Z	bobbyd_	NigelS	oh. :)
