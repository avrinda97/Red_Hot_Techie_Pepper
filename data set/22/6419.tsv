2008-03-25T07:25:00.000Z	Animortis		Can anyone please tell me how to get my printer's official name so I can use it on a network in 7.10?
2008-03-25T07:27:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	how is the printer being shared?  Direct network connection?
2008-03-25T07:28:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	Directly through a home network. I want to share it to an XP laptop, and i'm looking at the wiki entry on printer sharing but the url I put in the Windows "Add a Printer" wizard is http://mypcname:631/printers/PRINTER_NAME and I don't know what that is. I've tried everything.
2008-03-25T07:30:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	directly on the network?  i.e., attached to a router, or otherwise directly via ethernet?
2008-03-25T07:30:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	Yes
2008-03-25T07:31:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	well, that URL you gave was for a printer connected to a machine running cups, where the printer was connected to the machine, not the network directly
2008-03-25T07:31:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	Allow me to clarify, maybe I misunderstood you. An Ubuntu 7.10 PC with a directly connected printer sharing to a Windows XP laptop on a network.
2008-03-25T07:32:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	you've configured cups to share it?
2008-03-25T07:33:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	I didn't know I had to. It doesn't say anything about that in the wiki. I have the printer working fine on this, the UBuntu desktop with the printer directly plugged in so I assumed sharing was simply a matter of connection.
2008-03-25T07:33:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	yes, you have to explicitly enable sharing
2008-03-25T07:34:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	Alright, how? Or can you link me to something that'll say how? *does wiki search while waiting*
2008-03-25T07:34:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	System -> Administration -> Printing
2008-03-25T07:35:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	I've seen that dialog and have the "Share printers connected to this system" check-marked.
2008-03-25T07:37:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	then all you need to do is follow the steps for adding a network printer on the Windows side.
2008-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	Ah, that's the problem and we're back to the beginning. What's the name of my printer so I can enter it into the network URL field in the Windows XP add printer wizard (Or rather, how do I find the name?)
2008-03-25T07:39:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	it should auto-detect via the network
2008-03-25T07:39:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	It does not.
2008-03-25T07:40:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	try restarting cups, then: sudo invoke-rc.d cupsys restart, and then try again
2008-03-25T07:40:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	beyond that, I can't help you much, as I don't use windows.
2008-03-25T07:43:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	sudo invoke-rc.d cupsys restart
2008-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	tritium	Animortis	so, Windows can now see the printer after restarting cups?
2008-03-25T07:45:00.000Z	Animortis	tritium	It can see the computer, but will not let me see the printers on it. I think this has something to do with the laptop also not being able to get into the Ubuntu desktop for file sharing too, saying it's got permission problems. I am searching for a solution on my own to unlock this unless someone's willing to share...
