2011-05-01T19:31:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	Can you put "gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist" in a terminal for me and see what you get?
2011-05-01T19:31:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	^
2011-05-01T19:31:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	Hmm, that seems about right.
2011-05-01T19:33:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	Do you have skype running though?
2011-05-01T19:36:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	not in repo.  ??
2011-05-01T19:36:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	It should be, it might even be preinstalled, I'm not sure.
2011-05-01T19:37:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	it isn't.  And it isn't in apt.  Are you spelling it correctly?
2011-05-01T19:39:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	the package is called dconf-tools, sorry about that, the tool is called dconf-editor.
2011-05-01T19:39:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	 got it.  thanks.
2011-05-01T19:46:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	vibhav: if you look around in dconf-editor do you see any relevant keys for indicator applet I might be missing?  I only have the whitelist setting which looks fine.
2011-05-01T19:46:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	Try unity --reset
2011-05-01T19:51:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	vibhav: ok, unity --reset did not work but I did get some interesting info in my console: ** (<unknown>:6574): DEBUG: TrayChild Rejected: dropbox dropbox Dropbox
2011-05-01T19:55:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	vibhav: anyway, it looks like Indicator is correctly accepting Skype and rejecting others as per the default whitelist.  But it still isn't visible.
2011-05-01T19:56:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	close skype and start it again
2011-05-01T20:01:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	vibhav: restarting skype didn't work.  Here is my console output since resetting unity.  Notice that Skype is accepted twice, the second time is when I restarted it so it appears to be working but maybe some of this other output is interesting:  https://gist.github.com/950552
2011-05-01T20:25:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	figured it out.  It is actually a dual head bug.
2011-05-01T20:26:00.000Z	Omega	eags_	Did you fix it?
2011-05-01T20:27:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	I noticed when I showed all my desktops that I could actually see the notification icons way up in the middle of nowhere by themselves.   Also notification applets don't get copied to the other head
2011-05-01T20:27:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	yeah but just by working around it.
2011-05-01T20:28:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	I just arranged my screens so the top of my main monitor is aligned with the top of my second monitor.  Before I had the top of my second, larger monitor higher than my main monitor creating some empty space above the main monitor.  That is where the notification applets are being drawn.
2011-05-01T20:29:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	super hacky solution but whatever.  Anyway looks like Ubuntu is putting minimal effort into supporting older apps.  Especially given the whole whitelist thing.  Are all other DE on board with indicator as the way forward?  Are KDE and gnome apps going to support this?
2011-05-01T20:32:00.000Z	eags_	Omega	anyway, thanks for your help.  I'll file a bug.
