2010-03-23T12:59:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	yes, but common for this would be : dpkg -I  /dir/to/folder/bla.deb
2010-03-23T13:00:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	then if it needs any other .debs  then it will search itself.?
2010-03-23T13:00:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	for that must set synaptic to a local place, like :
2010-03-23T13:01:00.000Z	DasEi		!aptoncd | rameshwor
2010-03-23T13:01:00.000Z	DasEi		!offline
2010-03-23T13:02:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	: yeah aptoncd. but i already formatted and did a fresh install :(
2010-03-23T13:04:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	and of course took no list before ? so now could have a ready script ?
2010-03-23T13:04:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	is your inet so slow or expensive or what broght you to this idea ?
2010-03-23T13:05:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	: net is slow.. :(
2010-03-23T13:05:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	what does these mean in kbit/s ?
2010-03-23T13:06:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	: don't laugh at me.. i'm currently downloading a pdf from internet and it is around 5 kb/s...
2010-03-23T13:07:00.000Z	DasEi		afsal:sudo  mv /etc/whatevr/oldName /etc/whatevr/newName
2010-03-23T13:07:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	; but it increases sometimes.. though.
2010-03-23T13:08:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	that's truly hard, and I don't laugh
2010-03-23T13:09:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	but also you need the updates... kernel features, patches and such ..
2010-03-23T13:10:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	: i don't install them generally..
2010-03-23T13:10:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	and you don't have any other access point ? like another machine ? quite bad you didn't pulled a package list of that installed system
2010-03-23T13:10:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	: it's not official or any big use. its just my personal use. so.. i don't care much about security issues.
2010-03-23T13:11:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	no.. but speed gets around 20-25 sometimes.. when  no other students are using internet.at around 1 am :). " im in a student hostel "
2010-03-23T13:12:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	but you don't want to be part of a botnet.. and possibly well functionin hardware.. well  on that bandwith the interest of that abuse might be small, anyway right
2010-03-23T13:12:00.000Z	DasEi	rameshwor	so you can install minimal-cd, and then app-wise over night
2010-03-23T13:12:00.000Z	rameshwor	DasEi	: of course i don't wanna be part of "BOTNET"
