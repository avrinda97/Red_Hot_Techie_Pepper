2007-10-02T11:21:00.000Z	Aishiko	kahrytan	that's just the compiz fusion control panel not the ubuntu one
2007-10-02T11:22:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	it's ubuntu one
2007-10-02T11:22:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	it's in Feisty just hidden
2007-10-02T11:22:00.000Z	Aishiko	kahrytan	for me to get that menu I had to instal compiz
2007-10-02T11:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	 no you dont
2007-10-02T11:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	compiz has it's own control center though
2007-10-02T11:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	just install gnome-control-center
2007-10-02T11:24:00.000Z	Aishiko	kahrytan	either way I've removed compiz, why they would install it automatically and not give the settings manager
2007-10-02T11:24:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	jsut install  gnome-control-center for the control center for gnome
2007-10-02T11:24:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	it's not part of compiz
2007-10-02T11:25:00.000Z	Aishiko	kahrytan	 the menu you showed is the smae one I saw when I got the compiz settings manager before I removed compiz
2007-10-02T11:26:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	The is one for compiz and seperate one for Preferences. THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT ONES.
2007-10-02T11:27:00.000Z	kahrytan	Aishiko	They do look alike but they are separate
