2008-09-18T21:07:00.000Z	venome	karayan	what does the "ps -e | grep pulse" comand returns?
2008-09-18T21:08:00.000Z	karayan	venome	pulse is not installed. I am installing it
2008-09-18T21:08:00.000Z	venome	karayan	it should be already there if you've got the 8.04
2008-09-18T21:09:00.000Z	venome	karayan	otherwise, the ESD 'should' do the job as well
2008-09-18T21:10:00.000Z	karayan	venome	yes pulse was already installed. I am using 8.04
2008-09-18T21:12:00.000Z	venome	karayan	so try to check the pulseaudio preferences (system->settings->pusleaudio preferences) / check if the applications you mention are using pulseaudio as their sound output
2008-09-18T21:14:00.000Z	karayan	venome	I cant find pulseaudio preferences, should I install any package?
2008-09-18T21:16:00.000Z	venome	karayan	try installing paman and paprefs packages
2008-09-18T21:17:00.000Z	venome	karayan	or if you prefer the gui installer write pulse in the search field and install the device chooser and manager
2008-09-18T21:18:00.000Z	karayan	venome	I have installed those
2008-09-18T21:18:00.000Z	venome	karayan	so there should be now the pulsaudio preferences somwhere in the menu
2008-09-18T21:19:00.000Z	venome	karayan	or "pulseaudio manager"
2008-09-18T21:19:00.000Z	karayan	venome	yes its there
2008-09-18T21:19:00.000Z	karayan	venome	pulse audio preferences
2008-09-18T21:20:00.000Z	venome	karayan	sorry, I was wrong, preferences are for network settings, you need to open the manager
2008-09-18T21:20:00.000Z	venome	karayan	in the manager, it should say whether it is connected and which sinks and sources it uses
2008-09-18T21:20:00.000Z	karayan	venome	yes its there
2008-09-18T21:23:00.000Z	venome	karayan	so if it says its connected and the sinks are all right, i think you've got to set up your music applications to use pulsaudio... if it doesn't help I've got no more ideas ...
2008-09-18T21:24:00.000Z	karayan	venome	okay I will setup my music applications
2008-09-18T21:24:00.000Z	karayan	venome	thank you
2008-09-18T21:24:00.000Z	venome	karayan	no problem:)
2008-09-18T22:00:00.000Z	karayan	venome	pusleaudio and libflashsupport for firefox got sound working fine for me.
