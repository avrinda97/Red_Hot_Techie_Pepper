2011-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	nessonic		anyone knowledgeable in ssh?
2011-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	post your question
2011-08-12T04:56:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	can you ping "myhost"
2011-08-12T04:59:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	can you ssh to the remote side?
2011-08-12T04:59:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	scp source-specification destination-specification
2011-08-12T05:01:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	sounds like the port is closed
2011-08-12T05:01:00.000Z	nessonic	treyh	would that only block file transfers? or the whole ssh? I figured it was open because I was able to ssh in
2011-08-12T05:02:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	specify the port, -P 22
2011-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	try using sftp instead
2011-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	nessonic	treyh	gives same error, but adds "couldn't read packet: connection reset by peer"
2011-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	whats the error, connection refused?
2011-08-12T05:05:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	remote username
2011-08-12T05:07:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	paste the command so we can advise
2011-08-12T05:08:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	try this: scp macaddress toby@nessmain:macaddress
2011-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	also never hurts to use "tab" locally when you type the command to put the format in cirrectly
2011-08-12T05:11:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	i know the fix, quit using mac
2011-08-12T05:12:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	does sftp user@remoteip work?
2011-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	1. cd to the directory with the file you want to transfer 2. sftp user@remoteip
2011-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	1. exit out of sftp, 2. cd /path/of/file/you/want/to/transfer 3. sftp user@remoteip 4. get name-of-file
2011-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	type ls
2011-08-12T05:17:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	then do a dance you're done
2011-08-12T05:18:00.000Z	treyh	nessonic	okay so you want to download the file?
