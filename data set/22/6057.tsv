2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	werent you the one that tried to help me with my sound last time?
2006-12-29T13:57:00.000Z	vulcanius	Siv0x	I started to, but it looked like crimsun was already helping you out
2006-12-29T13:58:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	yes, i know. but i'm having trouble with it again.
2006-12-29T13:58:00.000Z	vulcanius	Siv0x	what is happening?
2006-12-29T13:58:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	no sound. lol
2006-12-29T13:59:00.000Z	vulcanius	Siv0x	are you using regular PC speakers or are you going to a receiver through SPDIF, optical, etc?
2006-12-29T13:59:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	all i had to do to get sound last time was something like ``amixer set default and i set my sound blaster audigy 2 zs to default sound card. and it worked. - i just cant remember the command
2006-12-29T14:00:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	i am using regular pc speakers, 2 of them and a subwoofer.
2006-12-29T14:01:00.000Z	vulcanius	Siv0x	have you verified the card is recognized? like through doing "aplay -l" and making sure it exists?
2006-12-29T14:01:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	actually no, i'm new with linux.. i can try that now that you told me the command.
2006-12-29T14:04:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	did you get that pm?
2006-12-29T14:05:00.000Z	Siv0x	vulcanius	how about just join #siv0x and help me there? - i'm using gaim so i doubt its working right.
