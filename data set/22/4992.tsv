2007-08-26T14:26:00.000Z	TuTUX		if ubuntu can automatic detect all the apps i have installed and auto install them when i doing a system upgrade, that would be awesome
2007-08-26T14:26:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	It doesn't need to.  That's what the upgrade is for.
2007-08-26T14:26:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	the upgrade doesn't remove/reinstall stuff, it just upgrades.  They remain installed (with newer versions)
2007-08-26T14:27:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	but when i upgrade from 6.10 to feisty, lots of my apps got lost
2007-08-26T14:27:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	Which ones might those have been?
2007-08-26T14:28:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	that was a while ago, and i reinstall the system few times after that upgrade, but i just got this idea
2007-08-26T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	They shouldn't get lost.  If you knew of a few examples, we could investigate.
2007-08-26T14:30:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	i can understand if i upgrade my system, those apps installed from 3rd party repos got lost or not function well
2007-08-26T14:31:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	Right, because the third party repos don't have the proper newer packages.
2007-08-26T14:33:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	but just like what you said, if the upgrade should keep all installed apps from official repos working, i will keep an eye on them when i upgrade to the final gutsy (when its out)
2007-08-26T14:36:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	how about programs built from src? will system upgrading break them?
2007-08-26T14:36:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	Where did you put them once you compiled?
2007-08-26T14:37:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	an example is compiz.  and i put them in /usr
2007-08-26T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	yeah.  Stuff in /usr is under package management.  Your stuff could get overwritten (or worse yet, you'll get broken packages), you should put them in /usr/local (that stuff isn't under package management)
2007-08-26T14:42:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	ok, ic
2007-08-26T14:44:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	you'll need to recompile them for the new versions of everything
2007-08-26T14:44:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	Just like any other locally installed deb, you can remove it as a deb, but it won't update itself
2007-08-26T14:45:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	ok, so instead of that, puting everything under /usr/local/ maybe a better idea to keep things runing?
2007-08-26T14:46:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	everything compiled from src
2007-08-26T14:46:00.000Z	Flannel	TuTUX	Well, in /usr/local you'll still run into problems when you upgrade to newer versions of everyhting its compiled against
2007-08-26T14:48:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	ok, since i still love apt that much, id just have to keep my own src packages more organized
2007-08-26T15:27:00.000Z	TuTUX	Flannel	?
