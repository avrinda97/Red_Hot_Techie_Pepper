2007-10-19T04:53:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	PAStheLoD	on GRUB
2007-10-19T04:53:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	ZaphodBeeblebrox	but do you see something like Ubuntu Original ?
2007-10-19T04:54:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	PAStheLoD	nope... I don't think so... where can I find grub conf to take a look?
2007-10-19T04:55:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	ZaphodBeeblebrox	 /boot/grub/menu.lst .. maybe .. or /boot/menu.lst ..

2007-10-19T04:59:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	ZaphodBeeblebrox	 so you can boot .16 , right? And have issues with X.org ?
2007-10-19T05:10:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	PAStheLoD	BTW, any ideas about the kernel thing?
2007-10-19T05:11:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	ZaphodBeeblebrox	I don't understand your problem completely. I've just replied to one of your messages but I haven't got the first part .. so if you tell me I can try :)
2007-10-19T05:12:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	PAStheLoD	anc cousin_luigi: kk, will restart X first then, brb
2007-10-19T05:19:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	ZaphodBeeblebrox	nv is the ubuntu driver .. nvidia is the resticted propietary nVidia driver . and you need the nvidia to use GLX / Compiz .. but I couldn't even use X.org with nvidia (only 640*480 :D)
2007-10-19T05:20:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox	PAStheLoD	It was all working fine with feisty :(
