2011-10-05T05:22:00.000Z	zorklat		can anyone help with my HP LJ 1018?
2011-10-05T05:23:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	have you tried downloading it again
2011-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	maybe its incomplete or corrupt and not matching its signature
2011-10-05T05:25:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	hp stuff has always 'just worked' for me in ubuntu for quite some time now
2011-10-05T05:25:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	but HP themselves are actually great help with linux customers
2011-10-05T05:26:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	sorry to say that I have no clue, I've given you all the advice I could think of without actually being through it myself
2011-10-05T05:28:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	what is it that 'runs' when you plug in the printer? via usb I assume you mean right?
2011-10-05T05:29:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	or actually right clicking will let you copy I think?
2011-10-05T05:30:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	are you using gnome though, should still work?
2011-10-05T05:31:00.000Z	zorklat	noisewaterphd	LXDE/Natty.
2011-10-05T05:31:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	you could just do: programname >> output.txt
2011-10-05T05:31:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	oh, im no help either then
2011-10-05T05:32:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	is that somethin you installed that runs?
2011-10-05T05:35:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	im with SIFTU, I've just got no idea what is happening on your machine to even come up with an idea
2011-10-05T05:42:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	I would assume that the downloaded file just doesnt match the sig, im not sure what you can do about that, but...
2011-10-05T05:43:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	why not just forget about that, use the 'Printing' app in Ubuntu and add and setup the printer that way
2011-10-05T05:44:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	and see what comes of that method
2011-10-05T05:46:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	are you using Gnome?
2011-10-05T05:46:00.000Z	zorklat	noisewaterphd	LXDE/Natty.
2011-10-05T05:46:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	sorry, you already said that
2011-10-05T07:02:00.000Z	zorklat	noisewaterphd	SIFTU, the problem is that openprinting.org is down.
2011-10-05T07:04:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	zorklat	ha, well that solves the signature mystery
