2008-05-03T16:37:00.000Z	solrize		any idea how much stuff is in a mirror?  i'm concerned i might run out of disk space
2008-05-03T16:37:00.000Z	popey	solrize	an entire ubuntu mirror?
2008-05-03T16:38:00.000Z	solrize	popey	yeah
2008-05-03T16:38:00.000Z	popey	solrize	one architecture, one release, binary only is ~17G
2008-05-03T16:38:00.000Z	solrize	popey	i've got about 150g so far and dunno  how much to go
2008-05-03T16:38:00.000Z	popey	solrize	how are you mirroring?
2008-05-03T16:38:00.000Z	solrize		rsync
2008-05-03T16:39:00.000Z	popey	solrize	the whole server?
2008-05-03T16:39:00.000Z	solrize		yeah
2008-05-03T16:39:00.000Z	popey	solrize	madness :)
2008-05-03T16:39:00.000Z	solrize		it's skipping a lot of non-regular files which seems a little odd
2008-05-03T16:39:00.000Z	popey	solrize	it'll be 17G times edgy, feisty, gusty, hardy, ibex, i386, amd64 times two
2008-05-03T16:40:00.000Z	popey	solrize	i use apt-mirror, much better
2008-05-03T16:40:00.000Z	solrize		17 * 7 * 2 = 34 * 7 = around 250gb, sounds ok
2008-05-03T16:40:00.000Z	solrize		rsync mirrors.us.kernel.org::ubuntu .
2008-05-03T16:40:00.000Z	popey	solrize	why?
2008-05-03T16:41:00.000Z	solrize		to get all the files
2008-05-03T16:41:00.000Z	popey	solrize	why?
2008-05-03T16:41:00.000Z	solrize		easier than figuring out how to filter it
2008-05-03T16:42:00.000Z	popey	solrize	it's nearer 500G
2008-05-03T16:42:00.000Z	solrize		500g is ok
2008-05-03T16:42:00.000Z	popey	solrize	it's a bit rude to grab it all if you're not going to use it
