2012-09-09T10:04:00.000Z	Elesa	myhero	And Xubuntu has the best of the two worlds, good looks and fast performance while keeping compatible with most never stuff and not compromising anything.
2012-09-09T10:04:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	thnx
2012-09-09T10:06:00.000Z	Elesa	myhero	just go for Xubuntu then. If you want to use Unity, just use sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop or download it from the Software Center or Synaptic if you don't feel comfortable in the command line.
2012-09-09T10:09:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	ok...bu ti saw many apps repos available like for ubuntu for xubutnu for kubuntu.....etc
2012-09-09T10:10:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	for example...ubuntu restricted xtras...then xubuntu restricted xtras...then kubuntu restricted xtras....
2012-09-09T10:11:00.000Z	Elesa	myhero	you could just look for restricted extras in the Software Center.
2012-09-09T10:11:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	so if i save debs for ubuntnu restricted xtras then they will be installed on xubuntu or not ???
2012-09-09T10:17:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	what u'll say about mint....someone just suggested it in pm
2012-09-09T10:19:00.000Z	Elesa	myhero	that is a good option too.
2012-09-09T10:19:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	yea..he suggested mint with cinnamon
2012-09-09T10:21:00.000Z	Elesa	myhero	Does your graphics card support 3D acceleration?
2012-09-09T10:22:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	 yeah.....it seems so ...its xfx raedeon hd4870
2012-09-09T10:23:00.000Z	Elesa	myhero	you could try it then, but Linux Mint with Cinnamon is not supported here. xD
2012-09-09T10:25:00.000Z	myhero	Elesa	pm..
