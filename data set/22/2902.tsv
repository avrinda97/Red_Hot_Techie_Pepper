2009-01-31T10:43:00.000Z	Berserkur		This is the first time I come to this channel and I can see that it is completely Useless. I'm and advanced Linux user and I can solve most of my problems myself but this is just another RTFM channel...              RTFM is not Ubuntu!!!!!
2009-01-31T10:44:00.000Z	Berserkur		Ubuntu is the most useful linux around, with the support of MINT but this channel is a disgrace
2009-01-31T10:45:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	And Arch is a better distro, that is if you really are a more 'advanced' user.
2009-01-31T10:48:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	I've done all that shit. I've used slack, gentoo and the rest of them. Now I want to relax. That means... I wan't a new device to work when I bring it. Or a device to work without 10 minutes of work to get it to work... I bet you know what I mean
2009-01-31T10:49:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Then you've never used Arch.
2009-01-31T10:50:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	that's because more people are here for help than to help
2009-01-31T10:51:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	To be honest, I have not. I figured it would be kind of the same as early slackware
2009-01-31T10:51:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Not even close
2009-01-31T10:51:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Better package management than ubuntu imho
2009-01-31T10:51:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	But ofcourse when it comes to the Kernel. It's not the same
2009-01-31T10:51:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	It's easy
2009-01-31T10:52:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Always up to date with rolling release... and an up-to-date system is as simply as pacman -Syu
2009-01-31T10:52:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	Package management is not my problem. It's the functionality. Which is really good in ubunty but!... The stability is getting me down
2009-01-31T10:52:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	functionality is a choice of the user.
2009-01-31T10:52:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	I am a long time user of FreeBSD is that helps at all
2009-01-31T10:53:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Then you'd love Arch
2009-01-31T10:53:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Give it a shot.
2009-01-31T10:53:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Arch is what you make it, not made out of the box
2009-01-31T10:57:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	To be honest. I've tried so many linux distros and unices that I've seen that id doesn't really matter what you do it's all fundamentally the same unless there are some major phlilosophycal or legal differeces between the two os'es
2009-01-31T10:58:00.000Z	SquareHimself	Berserkur	Just try Arch and thank me later. Plus, stay on topic so I don't get kicked out of here
2009-01-31T11:02:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	Sorry. I'm very drunk and stoned. However... I think I'm making a valid point. I've used linux for a long time. I like all the scripts and code that Ubuntu makes to make things automated and that's why I don't thing why arch will get me going. I used to love the reading and figuring out but now I just want to relax :D
2009-01-31T11:03:00.000Z	Berserkur	SquareHimself	That's why I'm so annoyed by the constant kernel panics
