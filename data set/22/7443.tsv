2006-03-29T17:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	yes
2006-03-29T17:50:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	I'm not exactly sure what you mean; is there a specific error?
2006-03-29T17:50:00.000Z	rewt	Xenguy	bc it is asking me for one right after i installed it
2006-03-29T17:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	it sounds like postfix was installed as part of whatever installation you just did...
2006-03-29T17:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	and now Ubu is configuring postfix for you
2006-03-29T17:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	it depends on what your email setup is...
2006-03-29T17:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	then maybe you just want 'no configuration', or 'local only' for now...
2006-03-29T17:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	you can always adjust config later with 'dpkg-reconfigure postfix'
2006-03-29T17:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	at command prompt type:  chkrootkit |less
2006-03-29T17:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	man chkrootkit
2006-03-29T17:58:00.000Z	rewt	Xenguy	thats all i do is run that simple less command?
2006-03-29T17:58:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	chkrootkit | less
2006-03-29T17:58:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	that's a 'pipe' in between the two
2006-03-29T06:00:00.000Z	Xenguy	rewt	that's it -- it you do 'man chkrootkit' you can confirm this for yourself
