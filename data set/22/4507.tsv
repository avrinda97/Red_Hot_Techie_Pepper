2009-01-22T06:33:00.000Z	bebin		hi everyone low sound in speaker and no sound in headphone help please
2009-01-22T06:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	open your mixer settings
2009-01-22T06:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	right click the speaker icon near the clock open vol control
2009-01-22T06:35:00.000Z	bebin		ok
2009-01-22T06:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	hit preferences - check PCM
2009-01-22T06:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	then crank it up
2009-01-22T06:36:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	I wouldnt go up to 100% on the PCM mixer, it might distort the sound -- prob 80%
2009-01-22T06:37:00.000Z	bebin	Cpudan80	yes i did it but no effect
2009-01-22T06:37:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	try the different mixers
2009-01-22T06:39:00.000Z	bebin	Cpudan80	i tried but no change
2009-01-22T06:39:00.000Z	bebin	Cpudan80	i changed the mixers but still no effect on headphone]
2009-01-22T06:40:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	even plugged into the same output as the speakers?
2009-01-22T06:40:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Anyone know how to save an mplayer stream?
2009-01-22T06:40:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Like a movie is playing in mplayer -- how do you save it...
2009-01-22T06:41:00.000Z	bebin	Cpudan80	speakers has a low volume but headphone has none
2009-01-22T06:42:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	maybe its an audio driver issue -- go to system --> prefs --> sound and switch to ALSA
2009-01-22T06:43:00.000Z	bebin	Cpudan80	i did that too but no change
2009-01-22T06:46:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	make sure you're changing the vol for the right device
2009-01-22T06:46:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	in the volume control thing - change the device line to select the correct one
2009-01-22T06:48:00.000Z	bebin	Cpudan80	i checked it and changed but still no effect
2009-01-22T06:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	bebin	dunno man ... sorry
2009-01-22T06:49:00.000Z	bebin	Cpudan80	ok
