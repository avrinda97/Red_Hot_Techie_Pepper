2008-04-12T19:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman_		how can i list all the files in a directory from the commandline, even hidden files?
2008-04-12T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	ls -la
2008-04-12T19:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	thankies :D
2008-04-12T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	it's not an application, it's a website
2008-04-12T19:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	it's not a website, it's a web-app. it runs under apache, yes, but it's also an application. the source has to be somewhere, and it's not in my www folder
2008-04-12T19:37:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	it is a simple website, look in your apache config for the site-enabled and where the root for phpyadmin is
2008-04-12T19:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	I did, it didn't say anything. i don't completely get the grep syntax, how might i search through my entire /etc/apache2 folder for "phpmyadmin" ?
2008-04-12T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	go into the sites-enabled directoy and see what sites you have
2008-04-12T19:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	it's only got 000-default in there, and it's not in that
2008-04-12T19:39:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	where is the docroot for 00-default
2008-04-12T19:39:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	/media/sdb2/www, and no phpmyadmin isn't in it
2008-04-12T19:39:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	you may also want to check the config file for a redirect
2008-04-12T19:40:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	i haven't found any. if i could just grep the entire /etc/apache2 folder for "phpmyadmin" i could probably find it, but i'm not sure the syntax for greping all the contents of all the files in a folder
2008-04-12T19:40:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	grep -r
2008-04-14T19:53:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	no
2008-04-14T19:54:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	screen would be the only tool to allow that
2008-04-14T19:55:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	what's screen?
2008-10-13T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	dead cable
2008-10-13T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	is there a link light on the nics
2008-10-13T20:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	They are
2008-10-13T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	dmsuperman_	do a tail -f /var/log/syslog - take the cable out, plug it back in see what you get
2008-10-13T20:16:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	ikonia	One sec
