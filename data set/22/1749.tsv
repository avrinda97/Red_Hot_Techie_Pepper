2010-03-27T10:10:00.000Z	plustax		and its driving me nuts
2010-03-27T10:10:00.000Z	plustax		and no one can seem to help me
2010-03-27T10:11:00.000Z	plustax		trek unless you can help me with my issue?
2010-03-27T10:13:00.000Z	plustax		well trek i have a seemingly easy problem to fix but people have been giving me failure solutions. If I pm you my problem do you think you might be able to give me some insight?
2010-03-27T10:13:00.000Z	plustax		I really need help :3
2010-03-27T10:14:00.000Z	plustax		trek basically, I go to stickam and the flash looks all whited-out and weird. The webcam barely works. Sometimes it displays, othertimes it doesnt. it freezes frequently and I have a problem in general getting the cam to work with flash based sites like stickam and tinychat
2010-03-27T10:15:00.000Z	plustax		i dont want to resort to windows if I can find someone competent enough to help
2010-03-27T10:15:00.000Z	plustax		trek i can show you a screenshot if youd like
2010-03-27T10:16:00.000Z	plustax		trek indeed. Although once upon a time a few weeks ago, someone magically got it working perfectly. Then I got a kernal update and now its bad again
2010-03-27T10:16:00.000Z	plustax		trek yes my cam works great in cheese
2010-03-27T10:17:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	issue a bug report, maybe...
2010-03-27T10:09:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	its not that easy... if you have ubuntu, putting XP on will mess with the boot sequence and prevent boot to ubuntu
2010-03-27T10:10:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	first, why Windows?
2010-03-27T10:11:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	then follow theadmin's instrucitons
2010-03-27T10:11:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	not from here
2010-03-27T10:11:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	plus I charge people for it (I do tech work in addition to university studies)
2010-03-27T10:13:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	is it in regards to the partitioning or something?
2010-03-27T10:16:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	I know exactly what you're talking about.  As far as I know, webcams + flash + Linux in general = issues
2010-03-27T10:16:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	but you can get your webcam to work with LInux (not necessarily flash) buy using Cheese or something
2010-03-27T10:18:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	I use a Windows machine for communicating with anything like microphone/headset, webcam, etc.
2010-03-27T10:19:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	then I don't have a solution for you at this time.
2010-03-27T10:20:00.000Z	Trek	plustax	ask theadmin about it, i'm doing things right now relating to the business i'm part of, just alt+tabbing here occasionally
