2012-04-20T23:25:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		excuse-me Sidewinder?
2012-04-20T23:25:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		ok
2012-04-20T23:25:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		i did
2012-04-20T23:25:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		sorry
2012-04-20T23:25:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		i didn't
2012-04-20T23:26:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		I cannot reach the kate's menus from standard ALT+key combination
2012-04-20T23:26:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		does anyone else have the same issue?
2012-04-20T23:27:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		or had= :(
2012-04-20T23:27:00.000Z	tgm4883	mzcl-mn	sorry I don't use kate
2012-04-20T23:27:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		no worries tgm4883
2012-04-20T23:27:00.000Z	tgm4883	mzcl-mn	have you tried #kubuntu
2012-04-20T23:28:00.000Z	mzcl-mn	tgm4883	not yet
2012-04-20T23:28:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		still I am using kate at ubuntu tgm4883
2012-04-20T23:28:00.000Z	tgm4883	mzcl-mn	can you use alt+key in other apps?
2012-04-20T23:28:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		and kwrite seems to be working well tgm4883
2012-04-20T23:29:00.000Z	mzcl-mn	tgm4883	yes I can
2012-04-20T23:29:00.000Z	tgm4883	mzcl-mn	so if it's just kate that is having the issue, probably not something specific to gnome. You might try #kubuntu as they will more likely be kate users
2012-04-20T23:30:00.000Z	mzcl-mn		maybe I should purge and reinstall tgm4883 and if that doesn't work out I'll get to #kubuntu too
2012-04-20T23:30:00.000Z	tgm4883	mzcl-mn	yea could try that too
2012-04-20T23:31:00.000Z	mzcl-mn	tgm4883	thanks
