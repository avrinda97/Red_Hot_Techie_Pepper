2012-01-09T23:48:00.000Z	reisio	titanes	the key word is 'persistent'
2012-01-09T23:48:00.000Z	reisio	titanes	as said already, unetbootin can give you a small persistent storage area
2012-01-09T23:48:00.000Z	reisio	titanes	all you actually need to do is install to the USB disk, Linux doesn't really care where you install it to
2012-01-09T23:49:00.000Z	titanes	reisio	why small? I got 8GB flash.
2012-01-09T23:49:00.000Z	reisio	titanes	that is small

2012-01-09T23:51:00.000Z	reisio	titanes	if you want a _live OS_ with some extra persistent storage, use unetbootin, etc.

2012-01-10T00:16:00.000Z	reisio	titanes	gparted/parted can fix that if you need to resize; if you only need to make a new partition table, try cfdisk
