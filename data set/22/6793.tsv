2009-03-25T04:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	what happens when you try to boot up Ubuntu?
2009-03-25T04:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	the disc?  a Live CD?
2009-03-25T04:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	oh the hard disk?
2009-03-25T04:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	you said it dual booted? so you got Windows on there?  can you boot that up?
2009-03-25T04:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	ok  so not a hard   disk problem
2009-03-25T04:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	sure Xorg could have gone wrong
2009-03-25T04:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	as for your data in Ubuntu, you can always access that, and I would recommend doing a seperate home partition for it
2009-03-25T04:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	the Live CD will let you have access to  the Ubuntu partition, as well as the  Windows partition as long as it was shut down properly
2009-03-25T04:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	yeah  and then you can go like Ext4
2009-03-25T04:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	you can get to your data yes
2009-03-25T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	as for  Ubuntu itself, I  am not sure what has happended
2009-03-25T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	panus	,but xorg sounds likely
