2007-11-21T04:46:00.000Z	james_hetfield		with the tzdata
2007-11-21T04:46:00.000Z	james_hetfield		lib.
2007-11-21T04:46:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	that's better :)  What about tzdata?
2007-11-21T04:57:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	what bug?
2007-11-21T04:58:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	what's the bug?
2007-11-21T04:59:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	when you run 'apt-cache policy tzdata', what does it say under "Installed" (please only paste that line)
2007-11-21T05:00:00.000Z	james_hetfield	soundray	 Installed: 2007i-0ubuntu0.7.10
2007-11-21T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	have you played with hardy repositories?
2007-11-21T05:02:00.000Z	james_hetfield	soundray	well, yes I have...
2007-11-21T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	that's too bad -- downgrading will be excruciatingly difficult
2007-11-21T05:03:00.000Z	james_hetfield	soundray	yeah, i figured it out by now : )
2007-11-21T05:04:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	your options are: reinstall gutsy, live with your system as it is and don't update (could be a security risk), or keep up with hardy (can break your system, only recommended if you have backups & time on your hands etc.)
2007-11-21T05:05:00.000Z	james_hetfield	soundray	I was thinking, they should come up with a working 2007i soon, right?
2007-11-21T05:06:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	definitely not before April
2007-11-21T05:06:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	sorry, misread your question
2007-11-21T05:07:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	tzdata will be the least of your problems in the medium term. You must have replaced very central components of your installation with hardy packages.
2007-11-21T05:10:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	don't do as choudesh suggests, unless you have a full backup and don't mind reinstalling
2007-11-21T05:10:00.000Z	james_hetfield	soundray	yep, I'm reading now
2007-11-21T05:13:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	good luck. And please consider political sensitivities when it comes to choosing a nick.
2007-11-21T05:13:00.000Z	james_hetfield	soundray	well, It's a long debate :  )
2007-11-21T05:14:00.000Z	james_hetfield	soundray	sturmfuehrer dates back to World War I
2007-11-21T05:14:00.000Z	soundray	james_hetfield	exactly, and it's not for here (/msg ubotu o4o)
