2007-11-02T13:07:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty		any more suggestions for dvd to vcd conversion?
2007-11-02T13:07:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	one sec
2007-11-02T13:08:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	thanks...
2007-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	sorry... I had a link for you... but I can't seem to find it... it's an app that was written especially for VCD
2007-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	it's supposed to convert dvd movies into vcd format so they can be burned into cds?
2007-11-02T13:16:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	yep.. it even rips dvd before it converts to vcd format for you if you want
2007-11-02T13:17:00.000Z	confuzed		I just read about it today... thought I bookmarked it but I don't see it
2007-11-02T13:17:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	oh men... that's exactly what i need... i'll try to google for something and post back.. maybe it'll ring a bell
2007-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	still there?
2007-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	yep..
2007-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	http://www.linux.com/articles/46844
2007-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	all that's coming is for windows
2007-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	ah there... thanks... check it out now
2007-11-02T13:26:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	there is a gui for it if you prefer: http://tovid.wikia.com/wiki/Using_the_tovid_GUI
2007-11-02T13:26:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	yes i do... thanks a lot... you're an angel
2007-11-02T13:27:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	have you tried this out already?
2007-11-02T13:28:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	nope... it's an older program, but I don't do VCD and it's not the best for DVD (I don't think?)... but because it's roots are in VCD/SVCD, I would say that it's probably a good bet
2007-11-02T13:29:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	it's hard to find anything still actively developed that will deal with VCD... everyone has moved to dvd now that the drives and disks are cheaper per/MB
2007-11-02T13:29:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	ah yes... i've seen the one's for dvd's.. problem is i don't have a dvd burner (and i should get one since vcd's are obsolete)... this is perfect though... if i can make it work
2007-11-02T13:29:00.000Z	confuzed	stillWithFiesty	good luck!... I'm off to bed!
2007-11-02T13:30:00.000Z	stillWithFiesty	confuzed	i know... thanks a lot...
