2005-06-21T11:33:00.000Z	djp		does anybody know why the linux-386, linux-k7 etc kernels are restricted?
2005-06-21T11:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	the linux-restricted-modules package is something else
2005-06-21T11:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	it's for modules with restrictive licenses
2005-06-21T11:41:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	are any linux-restricted-modules installed by default with a hoary install?
2005-06-21T11:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	linux-restricted-modules is a single package. afaik it only contains the nvidia drivers at the moment, though i could be wrong
2005-06-21T11:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	i don't think it's installed by default
2005-06-21T11:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	oh, sorry, it's much more that just nvidia
2005-06-21T11:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	also wireless networking, lucent modem, isdn, .. blah blah
2005-06-21T11:45:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	is there anywhere that lists what is restricted?
2005-06-21T11:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	just a sec
2005-06-21T11:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	is this what you want? http://packages.ubuntu.com/hoary/misc/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-5-386
2005-06-21T11:54:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	thanks
2005-07-15T05:50:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	i think he has done that already
2005-07-22T13:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	means ubuntu supported - packages in 'main' and 'restricted', afaik
2005-07-22T13:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	i think synaptic has a 'legend' under the Help menu
2005-07-22T13:22:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	thanks
2005-07-22T13:23:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	yes it does! (/me is embarressed now...) ;)
2005-09-07T13:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	at a guess something like "char* a=23;" is being done
2005-09-07T13:28:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/1835
2005-09-07T13:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	is this an app you've written ?
2005-09-07T13:33:00.000Z	djp	HappyFool	no it is the gens emulator
2005-09-07T13:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	djp	maybe what darkheart said. are there any errors about missing #include files? (they'll probably occur early on)
