2010-05-03T12:07:00.000Z	aboSamoor		I am trying to make 802.1x connection, once I enable the security option in the nm-connection-editor the apply button get disabled, any idea ?
2010-05-03T12:07:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	is this wireless or wired?
2010-05-03T12:07:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	it is wired
2010-05-03T12:08:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	You are connecting to a dto1x enabled switch?
2010-05-03T12:09:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	I am using it in a campus and I am not sure about their infrastructure, but they use TTLS, PAP, cacert.pem files
2010-05-03T12:09:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	Do you not get on the network without .1x?
2010-05-03T12:10:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	no, I can not connect in other methods, no IP given to undefined hosts
2010-05-03T12:11:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	hmm which version of ubuntu is this?
2010-05-03T12:11:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	I have an old computer that was upgraded and it connects without problems, which mean that there is no problem in the network
2010-05-03T12:11:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	10.04
2010-05-03T12:12:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	I think the problem is in the UI that it disables the apply button for no reason, do you have any idea how can I add a connection not using the interface ?
2010-05-03T12:12:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	what you could do is manually modify the entry in gconf-editor and copy the settings from the laptop that works
2010-05-03T12:13:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	in the gconf-editor you can see the connections listed under system->networking->connections
2010-05-03T12:16:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	thanks very much, I was searching for the options in some file in the home folder. :)
2010-05-03T12:17:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	because it uses gconf you can copy the xml file from the .gconf folders
2010-05-03T12:18:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	no networking under system in gconf-editor !
2010-05-03T12:18:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	uh oh that doesn't sound good
2010-05-03T12:19:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	do you have any created connections?
2010-05-03T12:20:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	yep, default one without security options
2010-05-03T12:21:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	try adding another one and see if it creates it.. also you don't happen to be running this as super user?
2010-05-03T12:23:00.000Z	aboSamoor	dotblank	thanks :), it works after the first connection, I think because the first one was made automatically :)
2010-05-03T12:23:00.000Z	dotblank	aboSamoor	glad I could help
