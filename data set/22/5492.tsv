2007-05-13T13:19:00.000Z	theINC		anyone know any Australian FTP servers with Ubuntu 7.04 Desktop x86 on them?
2007-05-13T13:20:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	i believe netspace has it on it
2007-05-13T13:21:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	ftp.netspace.net.au
2007-05-13T13:24:00.000Z	theINC	reubs	netspace is showing connection errors
2007-05-13T13:25:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	i just logged in then try ftp://ftp.netspace.net.au/pub/ubuntu
2007-05-13T13:27:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	did that work?
2007-05-13T13:27:00.000Z	theINC	reubs	works in Firefox but not my FTP client (Finder/cyberduck)
2007-05-13T13:29:00.000Z	theINC	reubs	probably just need a different FTP client
2007-05-13T13:30:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	you could use the default ftpclient from the terminal if that would help. just open an terminal and type: ftp ftp.netspace.net.au/pub/ubuntu
2007-05-13T13:32:00.000Z	theINC	reubs	tried it in FTP and got an error 'no address associated with nodename'
2007-05-13T13:36:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	try 'ftp 203.10.110.104' and login as anonymous
2007-05-13T13:38:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	your using xp at the currently?
2007-05-13T13:38:00.000Z	theINC	reubs	I have both a Mac and a Vista PC
2007-05-13T13:41:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	you could still download it using firefox? or is that a problem, or do you need to download it in chunks?
2007-05-13T13:41:00.000Z	theINC	reubs	Firefox is breaking on me ATM
2007-05-13T13:42:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	can you use your mac now? it's terminal is more like ubuntu, I haven't used vista so i'm not sure of its finer points :)
2007-05-13T13:43:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	ls
2007-05-13T13:44:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	and if you want to download a file . nav to the dir and then use 'get %FILENAME'
2007-05-13T13:45:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	it will download it to the directory you started ftp from. which would most prob be your home directory
2007-05-13T13:46:00.000Z	theINC	reubs	we got a download going =D
2007-05-13T13:46:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	you can change the download directory with 'lcd' which is local change dir :)
2007-05-13T13:49:00.000Z	reubs	theINC	yeah it feels a bit backwards with our speeds out here. who are you connected with?
