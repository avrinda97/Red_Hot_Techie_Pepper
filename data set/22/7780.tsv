2006-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	unity		`umount: it seems /home/unity/Stuff is mounted multiple times` and only root is allowed to do -f
2006-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	unity		does anyone know how to, without root, unmount a fs marked with users option if it is mounted twice? if i try, i get `umount: it seems /home/unity/Stuff is mounted multiple times` and only root is allowed to do -f
2006-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	sudo umount /where/ever
2006-07-01T14:12:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	does that require that i know the root password?
2006-07-01T14:12:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	it requires you to know your own password if you have access rights to mount and umount
2006-07-01T14:13:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	but shouldn't users who do not have that right still be allowed to mount and umount thing marked with users option?
2006-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	with the double mounting who knows
2006-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	so is it like a kernel bug or something?
2006-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	is mounting something twice a bug - perhaps
2006-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	is mounting something twice a bug - though I think it is expected behaviour
2006-07-01T14:15:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	I have been able to since the early I started using OSS in the early 90's
2006-07-01T14:15:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	mount should check if it already mounted. i do not see why a user should be unable to mount something he or she mounted twice
2006-07-01T14:15:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	just try it
2006-07-01T14:16:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	try what? i have mounted something twice, and now it cannot be umounted
2006-07-01T14:16:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	and if i mount it once, i CAN umount it
2006-07-01T14:17:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	report it if your not happy
2006-07-01T14:17:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	ok thanks for your help? do you know where it would be most appropriate to report?
2006-07-01T14:18:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	launchpad.net say the steps and what you expect
2006-07-01T14:21:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	is it relevant that the mount is smbfs?
2006-07-01T14:21:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	perhaps then the report should go to samba instead?
2006-07-01T14:25:00.000Z	ompaul	unity	samba
2006-07-01T14:26:00.000Z	unity	ompaul	ok thanks again
