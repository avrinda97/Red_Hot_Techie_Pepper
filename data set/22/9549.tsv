2004-09-29T08:01:00.000Z	_Hiro_		o could anyone check for me wether there is an openvpn package?
2004-09-29T08:01:00.000Z	_Hiro_		I suppose there is
2004-09-29T08:02:00.000Z	_Hiro_		ok great, I prefer to keep 'within the system' as opposed to compiling a lot of seperate packages from source :)
2004-09-29T08:02:00.000Z	_Hiro_		is there bootsplash support ?
2004-09-29T08:04:00.000Z	_Hiro_		the ubuntu 6 month release cycle, does it mean that the repository of packages is frozen and every 6 months new tested ones are added?
2004-09-29T08:05:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	fairly soon we'll open up hoary, which will be a development repository until it freezes; you'll be able to track it while it's in development
2004-09-29T08:06:00.000Z	_Hiro_	Kamion	but for instance if you have gaiml 1.0.0 in the repos and a month later they release 1.0.1, what happens? you need to wait another 5 months?
2004-09-29T08:06:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	that'll go into the current development suite
2004-09-29T08:07:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	it's in universe
2004-09-29T08:08:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	not what you might call heavily tested, though; it only became installable a couple of days ago
2004-09-29T08:08:00.000Z	_Hiro_	Kamion	well I just need a little something to burn dvdr, k3b did that fine before :)
2004-09-29T08:09:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	supposed to be, I think there may still be a few bugs on some systems
2004-09-29T08:20:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	we will be doing fora, yes
2004-10-01T15:28:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	looks OK, provided your IP is 192.168.1.<something>; I would expect to see another line for the route to the gateway
2004-10-02T12:27:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	yes
2004-10-02T13:18:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	we'll be changing that soon, there's been enough feedback about it that it seems we have to bring back the keyboard configuration screen
2004-10-02T13:18:00.000Z	_Hiro_	Kamion	that ash shell provided was also a bit weird, it reacts very strange to stuff like backspace
2004-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	it's busybox, not ash
2004-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	_Hiro_	Kamion	this is a bit specific but I use openvpn to provide me internet over the wireless network, could packages like openvpn be provided on the install disk?
2004-10-02T13:21:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	the text is just a bit out of date, that's all
2004-10-02T13:21:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	backspace has always worked for me ...
2004-10-02T13:24:00.000Z	Kamion	_Hiro_	in general you need to file bugs about this kind of thing :)
