2011-02-06T09:07:00.000Z	Donjr		 Okay, so I create a new connection, I scan and find my home network and click okay, now how do I tell it to connect?  It still says "Last Used: Never"
2011-02-06T09:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	wired? wireless? what encryption if any? associated with the ap?
2011-02-06T09:09:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	no ap? that means there is not a wifi spot to connect to
2011-02-06T09:09:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	what does ifconfig show it as ? wlan0 ?
2011-02-06T09:11:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	whats the wireless chipset
2011-02-06T09:11:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	sudo dhclient eth1    yields what
2011-02-06T09:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	then associate with the ap and try again
2011-02-06T09:16:00.000Z	Donjr	bazhang	how do I associate with the ap?
2011-02-06T09:16:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	did you check the specific steps in the link I gave you on exactly how to do that?
2011-02-06T09:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	or its hidden
2011-02-06T09:25:00.000Z	Donjr	bazhang	I'm sorry but nothing here tells me how to add or associate an ap with my network that I can find.  It tells me to check with my ap and see if it see's my card or not, but not how to associate
2011-02-06T09:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	I just gave you the command
2011-02-06T09:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	what was the exact command you gave and the exact error message
2011-02-06T09:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	and the command you gave?
2011-02-06T09:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	please pastebin the out put of ifconfig, lspci
2011-02-06T09:41:00.000Z	Donjr	bazhang	 http://pastebin.com/C23TJSMH   I threw in the iwconfig at the end as well
2011-02-06T09:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	and you followed all of the steps in the broadcom wiki, extracting firmware or using from additional drivers
2011-02-06T09:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	because it showing up as eth1 leads me believe the device is not recognized properly
2011-02-06T09:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	then try the modprobe steps again
2011-02-06T09:55:00.000Z	Donjr	bazhang	the sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl  line gives me a Module ssb is in use. error
2011-02-06T09:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	that seems extreme, not sure how to fix as you seem to have backtracked / ie used one method then another. perhaps reverse steps and start fresh
2011-02-06T09:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Donjr	I'd try anything before reinstalling, that truly is a last resort
