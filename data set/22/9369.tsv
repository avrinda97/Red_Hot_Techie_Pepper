2005-02-10T16:19:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	sorry it is sg
2005-02-10T16:19:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	sg is the generic scsi interface, needed for burning
2005-02-10T16:21:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	currently yes
2005-02-10T16:24:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	that would be sr_mod

2005-02-10T16:31:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	just tell it manually
2005-02-10T16:31:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	if you're burning a data CD
2005-02-10T16:35:00.000Z	discord	HrdwrBoB	thanks you rule!
2005-02-10T16:36:00.000Z	discord	HrdwrBoB	am i pushing it to ask you for help with sound also
2005-02-10T16:37:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	you've made sure both master and pcm are unmuted
2005-02-10T16:44:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	do you have >1 soundcard connected?
2005-02-10T16:48:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	in the gnome mixer is there more devices?
2005-02-10T17:01:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	discord	that cd error looks to be a kernel bug
