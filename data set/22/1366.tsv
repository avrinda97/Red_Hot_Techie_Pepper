2010-11-03T05:11:00.000Z	pr0xy		how do I install my graphics drivers from the command line? This is an emergency. I need to get my homework back, and I uninstalled my graphics drivers by accident.
2010-11-03T05:12:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	your best bet would be to try to back your homework up first ;)
2010-11-03T05:12:00.000Z	pr0xy	uberspaced	that's not helpful. it was a mistake.
2010-11-03T05:13:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	I meant before you start messing with other things
2010-11-03T05:13:00.000Z	pr0xy	uberspaced	I can't access anything at all.
2010-11-03T05:14:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	I'm confused; when you say you can't access anything at all, is the box completely dead?
2010-11-03T05:15:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	whoops, just read the thing about grub.
2010-11-03T05:16:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	edit the line
2010-11-03T05:17:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	do you know how to boot into single user mode?
2010-11-03T05:17:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	are you still at the grub prompt?
2010-11-03T05:19:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	so google for "ubuntu boot single user"
2010-11-03T05:21:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	if the thing doesn't even boot correctly, you need to get it to boot correctly first.
2010-11-03T05:22:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	I'm not familiar with nomodeset
2010-11-03T05:23:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	so, try vesa first
2010-11-03T05:24:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	single user mode is kind of like "recovery mode"
2010-11-03T05:27:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	press "e" to edit the current thing
2010-11-03T05:28:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	you're at a grub "prompt" or a grub menu?
2010-11-03T05:30:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	god, we're getting some where.
2010-11-03T05:31:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	when you pressed 'e', can you move around and type stuff?
2010-11-03T05:32:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	there's going to be a line that begins with kernel
2010-11-03T05:32:00.000Z	uberspaced	pr0xy	press enter, then press e
