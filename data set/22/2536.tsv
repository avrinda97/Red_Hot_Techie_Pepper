2009-12-09T08:40:00.000Z	Shane_		I needed to install b43-fwcutter, but i don't have any network connection so I downloaded it and "make"ed it. Do I just run the b43-fwcutter file now, to install it?
2009-12-09T08:40:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	make install
2009-12-09T08:43:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	Do you know anything about b43-fwcutter?
2009-12-09T08:44:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	not much...i looked into it when i was attempting to get my wireless working but my problem was something with setting keycodes so idt ill be much help
2009-12-09T08:45:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	but the link you gave looks pretty straightforward...if you can't get to the repo's id look into fixing that first and then follow the forum post exactly like it is
2009-12-09T08:45:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	Ok, thats what im trying to do.  Its hard. Do you know, after i run make install, everything seemed successful, so can i move on to the next step?
2009-12-09T08:46:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	I can't connect with either wireless or wired networks, thats my main issue
2009-12-09T08:47:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	i understand...what you need to do though is figure that out first and then try the tutorial because compiling the fwcutter program from source prolly won't work the way the tutorial is doing it id guess
2009-12-09T08:47:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	Ok thanks
2009-12-09T08:48:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	I need to get fwcutter working to get wireless working, and i need to get online to get fwcutter. What an awesome loop :P
2009-12-09T08:48:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	what does apt-get install say when you run it?
2009-12-09T08:48:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	 to download fwcutter
2009-12-09T08:49:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	cannot find package
2009-12-09T08:50:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	try apt-cache search b43-fwcutter
2009-12-09T08:51:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	nothing returns
2009-12-09T08:51:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	try apt-get update...if your sources.list file is setup right it should pull all the packages from those repo's in
2009-12-09T08:52:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	i get "b43-fwcutter - Utility for extracting Broadcom 43xx firmware" when i do apt-cache search b43-fwcutter on my comp
2009-12-09T08:52:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	It always errors when I try that, it can't resolve any of the hostnames because it can't connect to a network
2009-12-09T08:53:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	so how are you on here if you can't get on that network?
2009-12-09T08:53:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	On my desktop.
2009-12-09T08:55:00.000Z	phillipsm	Shane_	can i PM you?
2009-12-09T08:55:00.000Z	Shane_	phillipsm	sure, i barley know irc so go for it. haha
