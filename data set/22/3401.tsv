2010-04-27T02:06:00.000Z	laeg		is there a way i can monitor what's uploading and downloading from ubuntu 9.10?
2010-04-27T02:07:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	several ..
2010-04-27T02:07:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	conky shows activity, netstat shows connections.. be more specific
2010-04-27T02:08:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	i've found system monitor shows current upload and downloads - i'd like to see what programs are uploading and downloading
2010-04-27T02:11:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	ty friend
2010-04-27T02:14:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	anything like darkstat with a gui?
2010-04-27T02:14:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	: darkstat in a browser ?!
2010-04-27T02:15:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	huh? i installed through synaptic but can only seem to be about to launch a text interface from terminal typing darkstat..
2010-04-27T02:16:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	it's some time ago I used it, if I remember right, it creates a server can be called in browser, showing diffrented graphs
2010-04-27T02:22:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	trafshow is another possibility for detailed view, though less fancy in graphical way then darkstat
2010-04-27T02:42:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	are you saying i should see a gui in darkstat?
2010-04-27T02:43:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	I used it on my router once, and I could call a gui in my browser, yes
2010-04-27T02:43:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	you mean in firefox? how?
2010-04-27T02:44:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	it acts as a server, and you can configure it's address and port
2010-04-27T02:44:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	complicated
2010-04-27T02:45:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	i just want a simple gui of incoming and out going traffic
2010-04-27T02:46:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	without seperation what the traffic consists of ? conky or systemmonitor for panel then
2010-04-27T02:49:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	system monitor doesn't show what programs are generating the traffic etc, i'll try confy. thanks
2010-04-27T02:50:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	as said, simple graphs don't allow seperation
2010-04-27T02:51:00.000Z	DasEi	laeg	either use something like ethereal or trafshow (no GUI") , or just have a overview for bandwith
2010-04-27T02:52:00.000Z	laeg	DasEi	ty
