2007-07-27T06:40:00.000Z	gravemind		that should be enough
2007-07-27T06:41:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	when you hibernate, where do you expect RAM contents to go?  ;)
2007-07-27T06:39:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	how big is physical memory and swap?
2007-07-27T06:39:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	big enough :)
2007-07-27T06:40:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	so swap is > 2x physical?
2007-07-27T06:40:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	no, they are the same. both are 1 GB
2007-07-27T06:41:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	in the swap
2007-07-27T06:41:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	yeah. so swap should be a bit larger than physical
2007-08-16T10:18:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	Fr. O'Malley hears confession at 6pm every night.
2007-08-16T10:19:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	removable media should not be in fstab
2007-08-16T10:19:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	I don't know how I can reverse the damage
2007-08-16T10:20:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	reformat the volume?
2007-08-16T10:20:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	every time I put it in, it says invalid mount options (because I added rw to it)
2007-08-16T10:20:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	it had stuff on it
2007-08-16T10:20:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	remove any mention of it from fstab
2007-08-16T10:21:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	do you have an OS that does not care about Unx permissions?
2007-08-16T10:22:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	yeah should I rescue the files with that?
2007-08-16T10:23:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	get the files off, reformat as FAT32, don't try to apply Unix permissions to filesystems that don't respect them ;)
2007-08-16T10:23:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	ok, it was formatted as vfat so it could be a dsl boot usb
2007-08-16T10:23:00.000Z	gravemind	mneptok	does vfat respect unix perms?
2007-08-16T10:23:00.000Z	mneptok	gravemind	VFAT = FAT32
