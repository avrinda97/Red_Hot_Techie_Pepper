2006-10-17T16:11:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	where do you want the drive to be located (When you try to view it?)
2006-10-17T16:12:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	so create a folder in your home folder
2006-10-17T16:13:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	I would tell you to just use /home/, but that would make bad things happen to you and small children.
2006-10-17T16:14:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	anytime.
2006-10-17T16:31:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	use gaim.
2006-10-17T16:32:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	plenty. I just think Gaim is better.
2006-10-17T16:32:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	well, whats the problem?
2006-10-17T16:33:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	from the "add aplications" or synaptic?
2006-10-17T16:34:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	do "sudo apt-get install whattoinstallhere"
2006-10-17T16:34:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	"sudo" is the way to do things as root in linux without logging in as root, and by default your user in ubuntu is already in the sudoers file. That shouldn't be a problem.
2006-10-17T16:35:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	just remember, sudo is your best friend..Or at least it's mine.
2006-10-17T16:38:00.000Z	Gnomer__	wolfbane_691	feel free to ask more if you need help
