2008-04-22T22:32:00.000Z	nyn		hi, I'm looking for a command to monitor what a specific program does, I already tried 'watch', but that did not work out for me, is there anything else?
2008-04-22T22:34:00.000Z	nyn		*now
2008-04-22T22:35:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	maybe you want to use command-line tools to manage your network ? it could be more verbose
2008-04-22T22:35:00.000Z	nyn		I've been looking ll over for information to get a more specific msg in the terminal but so far I've encountered no docu and the man page is not very helpful
2008-04-22T22:37:00.000Z	nyn	coolcubix	: I'm trying to find out how to use the command line for NM, but so far I haven't found any helpful documentation
2008-04-22T22:38:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	by networkmanager, you mean the graphical one in GNOME ?
2008-04-22T22:38:00.000Z	nyn	coolcubix	: actually xfce, but yes, that one
2008-04-22T22:39:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	IMHO it would be really useful to manage it with command-line tools like ifconfig and the like :)
2008-04-22T22:39:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	what is your specific network problem ?
2008-04-22T22:39:00.000Z	nyn	coolcubix	: I've been trying to set up a VPN to connect to the net of my university
2008-04-22T22:40:00.000Z	nyn	coolcubix	: and since the error message is not exactly verbose I cannot tell what the problem is, thats what I am trying to find out
2008-04-22T22:40:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	and what is the action that triggers an error message ?
2008-04-22T22:41:00.000Z	nyn	coolcubix	: when I press the button to connect to the university network, NM tells me: "VPN Connection failed"
2008-04-22T22:42:00.000Z	nyn		but it doenst say why -.-
2008-04-22T22:43:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	if you know the remote address and port, you could try   telnet <remoteip> <port>   and see if it gets connected, or if it stays stalled
2008-04-22T22:44:00.000Z	nyn		I do have the IP, how do I find out about the port?
2008-04-22T22:45:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	don't know, maybe in your university's technical references (along with the IP), or if it is a well-known VPN protocol, look for the default port for this protocol
2008-04-22T22:45:00.000Z	nyn		when I run nm-tool (thats the applet under xfce if I interpret the man page correctly) it tells me lots of things like connected devices and whethr they are in use and stuff, but nothing about my vpn
2008-04-22T22:46:00.000Z	nyn		the university only provides the vpn server ip and the information that its pptp (I guess that was it, I mean the one made by microsoft)
2008-04-22T22:50:00.000Z	nyn		just looked it up again, definitely PPTP
2008-04-22T22:55:00.000Z	coolcubix	nyn	according to wikipedia, pptp uses ports 47 for the GRE protocol itself and 1723 to control GRE
2008-04-22T23:05:00.000Z	nyn	coolcubix	: I tried with the port 1723 and  for a brief time it was connected, but then: Escape character is '^]'. Connection closed by foreign host. - what do I do now?
