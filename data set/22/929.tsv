2012-03-11T01:10:00.000Z	[deXter]		Hi all, my 11.10 install isn't booting up anymore. The last time we were using it, it looked like the flash plugin had got corrupted or something. Then there was an error about some packages getting corrupted or something. Now the system won't boot. Blank screen. I'm able to get into the basic recovery shell and fsck checks out fine. I'm not able to boot into runlevel 3. How do I go about getting into a shell that supports basic networking? Thanks.
2012-03-11T01:12:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	Isn't there a menu entry that starts with network?
2012-03-11T01:12:00.000Z	[deXter]	schnuffle	Nope.
2012-03-11T01:13:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	I crashed mine some days ago and I could choose beteen normal boot, recorvery and recovery with network
2012-03-11T01:13:00.000Z	[deXter]		O.o
2012-03-11T01:13:00.000Z	[deXter]		schmidtm, 11.10?
2012-03-11T01:13:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	Anyway what tells you ifconfig?
2012-03-11T01:14:00.000Z	[deXter]	schnuffle	Hold on, booting into recovery now.
2012-03-11T01:14:00.000Z	[deXter]	schnuffle	Nothing.
2012-03-11T01:14:00.000Z	[deXter]		I tried "networking start" but that didn't work.
2012-03-11T01:15:00.000Z	[deXter]		Wait, "service networking start" works, and now ifconfig lists the localhost
2012-03-11T01:15:00.000Z	[deXter]		err, the loopback interface
2012-03-11T01:15:00.000Z	[deXter]		now how do I load eth0 :P
2012-03-11T01:17:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	Is it configured with networj manager?
2012-03-11T01:17:00.000Z	[deXter]	schnuffle	Yeah
2012-03-11T01:17:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	if it doesn't show up you need to load te apropriate kernel modeule
2012-03-11T01:18:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	I guess sudo ifconfig eth0 up, will not work
2012-03-11T01:18:00.000Z	[deXter]	schnuffle	The card is a marvell 88E8036 fast ethernet controller
2012-03-11T01:18:00.000Z	[deXter]		Know which module to load for that?
2012-03-11T01:18:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	start udev
2012-03-11T01:19:00.000Z	[deXter]	schnuffle	Still only the loopback.
2012-03-11T01:22:00.000Z	schnuffle	[deXter]	isn't there some udev-trigger to start as well.
