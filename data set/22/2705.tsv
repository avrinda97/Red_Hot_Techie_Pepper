2009-04-20T16:53:00.000Z	DeFi		sigh, the md5's are different ActionParsnip, now im back to the start and outta ideas on how to transfer the iso across :/
2009-04-20T16:53:00.000Z	DeFi		thanks for your help anyway ActionParsnip
2009-04-20T16:53:00.000Z	DeFi		:/
2009-04-20T16:55:00.000Z	DeFi		Does anyone have a simple way to transfer a file from ubuntu console with no extra packages running inside a virtual machine to the host windows pc?
2009-04-20T16:55:00.000Z	DeFi		yeah i know ActionParsnip
2009-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	DeFi		i need a way to transfer the iso
2009-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7_	DeFi	easiest way i can think of is via samba
2009-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	DeFi		since it corrupts over ftp
2009-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	DeFi	s3r3n1t7_	that would require installing samba
2009-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	DeFi		i need to keep the ubuntu system clean
2009-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7_	DeFi	define clean
2009-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	DeFi		with no extra packages
2009-04-20T16:57:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7_	DeFi	then what do you have installed that can send or transmit files
2009-04-20T16:57:00.000Z	DeFi	s3r3n1t7_	its a command line install
2009-04-20T16:57:00.000Z	DeFi		thats all
2009-04-20T16:57:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7_	DeFi	then you'll have to install something if you don't want to use ftp.
2009-04-20T16:58:00.000Z	DeFi		ftp corrupts everytime
2009-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	DeFi		i guess ill install ssh and use sftp then..
2009-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	DeFi		have to remove it afterwards
2009-04-20T17:01:00.000Z	DeFi	s3r3n1t7_	sftp is copying at 500KB/s
2009-04-20T17:01:00.000Z	DeFi		that is really slow...
2009-04-20T17:02:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7_	DeFi	that's normal, due to encryption
