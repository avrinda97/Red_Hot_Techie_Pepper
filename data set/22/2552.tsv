2009-05-21T09:59:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	maybe dump all /home on a USB stick and start clean, could be an option
2009-05-21T10:04:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	on all of my others, they are
2009-05-21T10:04:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	but this comp isn't
2009-05-21T10:05:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	idk really
2009-05-21T10:05:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	agree with phoenixz
2009-05-21T10:17:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	same thing diff names thats all
2009-05-21T10:23:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	its all the same thing for IDE
2009-05-21T10:23:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	you can proceed with your plan using gparted
2009-05-21T10:24:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	yes, i know that they are the same drives but im curious why ubuntu things it is a SCSI/SATA as it isnt
2009-05-21T10:24:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	*thinks
2009-05-21T10:24:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	k...
2009-05-21T10:25:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	but anyway, why do the 2 think different?
2009-05-21T10:25:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	more like USB stick... my cd's are bad
2009-05-21T10:25:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	they're thinking hte same, gparted is sticking to its old way of naming drives
2009-05-21T10:26:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	rly? ill try with another cd/stick and ill see if it says sda or hda.....
2009-05-21T10:26:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	yeah so you can see
2009-05-21T10:26:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	even though my modern desktop pc says sda like it REALLY is both on gparted live and ubuntu
2009-05-21T10:27:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	which is proper as it is SATA2
2009-05-21T10:27:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	you have gparted live?
2009-05-21T10:27:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	im not on it now but yes, i have it on a cd
2009-05-21T10:27:00.000Z	she_dyed	racecar56	why dont you use that then? if it calls it properly as sda
2009-05-21T10:28:00.000Z	racecar56	she_dyed	you mean as it properly calls it as hda, and im using ubuntu because ubuntu is an installable os
