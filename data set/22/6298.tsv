2006-12-25T11:21:00.000Z	haxality		I can't format or delete files from my external hard drive.
2006-12-25T11:21:00.000Z	haxality		this is incredibly frustrating.
2006-12-25T11:21:00.000Z	haxality		returns an error every time
2006-12-25T11:21:00.000Z	haxality		so does fdisk
2006-12-25T11:22:00.000Z	haxality		fdisk tells me the partition is in use
2006-12-25T11:22:00.000Z	haxality		it's supposed to be FAT32, but I think the partition table got corrupted when I accidentally turned it off
2006-12-25T11:22:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	haxality	sync and umount
2006-12-25T11:22:00.000Z	haxality	nolimitsoya_	I did, it still gave me that error
2006-12-25T11:22:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	haxality	in that case, write a new partition table
2006-12-25T11:22:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	haxality	youll loose all data thjough...
2006-12-25T11:22:00.000Z	haxality		that's fine, it's new :P
2006-12-25T11:23:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	haxality	there are tools to recover lost partitions if you lost anything important
2006-12-25T11:23:00.000Z	haxality		nope, I just want to format it.
2006-12-25T11:23:00.000Z	haxality		but every tool I've tried gives me errors
2006-12-25T11:24:00.000Z	haxality		it doesn't work.
2006-12-25T11:24:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	haxality	write a new partition table. perhaps clean the drive with schred first
2006-12-25T11:24:00.000Z	haxality		schred?
2006-12-25T11:24:00.000Z	haxality		*shred?
2006-12-25T11:25:00.000Z	haxality		ok, shredding entire device now
2006-12-25T11:25:00.000Z	haxality		hopefully that fixes it, heh
2006-12-25T11:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	haxality	you might want to take a look at 'man shred' first, or things will take ages
2006-12-25T11:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya_	haxality	one pass and then zeroes should be plenty
