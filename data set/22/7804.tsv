2006-01-05T06:45:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 I use to work for AOL and I dont really recomend it for anyone
2006-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	ITSa341	Inf3ctedFx	  I still do beta testing for them and I must say if you haven't tried the latest version I agree with you.
2006-01-05T06:47:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 there is another version coming up calls Coplant
2006-01-05T06:49:00.000Z	ITSa341	Inf3ctedFx	Have you tried the latest version of 9.0 security?  One interface for Anti-virus, Anti-Spyware, Anti-phishing, Anti-Pharming, Firewall, Money alerts etc etc
2006-01-05T06:49:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 I use to be tech support on aol.. of course I'll tryed but the Safety and Security Center is still mess up xD
2006-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 safety and Security Center is a new system that aol install.. but if u want just the Mcafee go to "install.av.aol.com"
2006-01-05T06:52:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 i do not recommend go to beta.. because if u start getting problems with it.. Tech Support wont support it.. cuz is a beta version
2006-01-05T06:54:00.000Z	ITSa341	Inf3ctedFx	 I wish I could get some version newer than 4.0 to fully work in ubuntu
2006-01-05T06:54:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 try 8.0
2006-01-05T06:54:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 r u using Wine?
2006-01-05T06:55:00.000Z	ITSa341	Inf3ctedFx	 it installs but won't launch
2006-01-05T06:55:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 it wont?
2006-01-05T06:55:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 do u want to go to a tech chatroom?
2006-01-05T06:56:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 all tech support has they own chatroom is not really open to the regular users  next time try #Head_of_the_class

2006-01-05T06:56:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	ITSa341	 but don't say anything about me xD they know me
