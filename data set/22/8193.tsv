2008-07-29T19:01:00.000Z	sd		Does any bluetooth gps receiver work with ubuntu?
2008-07-29T19:01:00.000Z	soundray	sd	yes, BT GPSs communicate serially with Ubuntu. You need gpsd or similar
2008-07-29T19:02:00.000Z	sd	soundray	I am looking at buying one. Not there yet. Just to know whether they work or not.
2008-07-29T19:02:00.000Z	sd	soundray	Do most/all/some work? You have some experience?
2008-07-29T19:02:00.000Z	sd	soundray	Have a link.
2008-07-29T19:03:00.000Z	sd	soundray	Its such a sick ritual looking at shabby sites to see if the best gadgets (after doing ALL that work looking at reviews to pick the best one) work in ubuntu
2008-07-29T19:03:00.000Z	sd	soundray	Hello?
2008-07-29T19:03:00.000Z	soundray	sd	Garmin devices have their own protocol, which is supported, but I don't think it's open like NMEA is. You may be better off with a generic device by Holux or Globalsat
2008-07-29T19:04:00.000Z	soundray	sd	have a bit of patience. Not everybody types staccato like you do
2008-07-29T19:05:00.000Z	sd	soundray	But you did say that the garmin bluetooth receiver would work, right?
2008-07-29T19:05:00.000Z	soundray	sd	you can petition manufacturers to provide information on Linux support, or at least open up their specs
2008-07-29T19:05:00.000Z	sd	soundray	I just have one lifetime to live and only so much money for the MEGAcorps.
2008-07-29T19:05:00.000Z	soundray	sd	I haven't tried, but I know that my serially connected eTrex works with either GARMIN or NMEA protocols
2008-07-29T19:06:00.000Z	soundray	sd	and my GlobalSat BT-338 works with NMEA
2008-07-29T19:06:00.000Z	soundray	sd	another reason not to buy Garmin
2008-07-29T19:08:00.000Z	sd	soundray	thank you. You have been great. Either the OS guys figure out ways to give us extra 100years to make sense of all the shabby documentation or they set retired spies to steal proprietary standards info.
2008-07-29T19:09:00.000Z	soundray	sd	you shouldn't go on about "shabby documentation" all the time when you're talking about Free/Open Source software. Source code is the most pristine documentation you can have
2008-07-29T19:10:00.000Z	sd	soundray	Like you can look through the source if you want to know where the friggin checkbox is.
2008-07-29T19:10:00.000Z	soundray	sd	Enough of the sounding off. Have you got any more support issues?
2008-07-29T19:12:00.000Z	sd	soundray	Never mind.
