2008-12-21T07:20:00.000Z	lord_hypnos		hey guys, I need some help. how the hell do I get into my routers menu? I know that its adress should be192.168.1.1 (I pinged it). if i put this into FFor opera it just loads forever
2008-12-21T07:21:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	using another browser
2008-12-21T07:22:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	if opera not working for you use firefox or Konqueror
2008-12-21T07:22:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	what type of router do you have
2008-12-21T07:24:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	let me check on it..but you be able to do : http://192.1.168.1 in any browser and it will ask for login/password
2008-12-21T08:08:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	are you still on here
2008-12-21T08:14:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	did you find your answer about your router ?
2008-12-21T08:15:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	sorry for tre delay...stil researching
2008-12-21T08:15:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	yes a big difference
2008-12-21T08:17:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	so basically you have one connection from the wall to your modem, and CAT5 from your modem to your NIC card
2008-12-21T08:21:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	that is a bad practice...there is no port forwarding without a router (and or firewall)
2008-12-21T08:22:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	if all you have is a modem with one port for that CAT5 from the modem to your NIC card...you need to get a router
2008-12-21T08:22:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	you can not port forwarding on a modem
2008-12-21T08:22:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	unless the modem has a built in router
2008-12-21T08:23:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	what is the name of your router again
2008-12-21T08:23:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	thanks....let me get that...and i will be better able to assist
2008-12-21T08:30:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	ok i found a pdf about your modem...it is just a cable modem ..no router features or anything of the sort
2008-12-21T08:31:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	yes you should get one i would suggest a linksys wireless router....if you have more than one machine, and what connectivity around the whole house
2008-12-21T08:31:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	i have two PCs, and two laptops...i use the "wireless" feature on my laptops
2008-12-21T08:32:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	i use a Linksys SRX200
2008-12-21T08:32:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	does the job for me
2008-12-21T08:34:00.000Z	enovativ_	lord_hypnos	yes you connect your modem to the router
