2007-05-07T11:56:00.000Z	Pici	Ali_ix	You shouldnt needlessly call ops, that gets broadcasted to other channels
2007-05-07T11:56:00.000Z	Ali_ix	Pici	i didnt :(
2007-05-07T11:57:00.000Z	Pici	Ali_ix	Yes you did.  13:53 <Ali_ix> !ops > Ali_ix
2007-05-07T11:57:00.000Z	Ali_ix	Pici	yes, just checked operators list, and didnt messaged any of them.
2007-05-07T11:57:00.000Z	Ali_ix	Pici	is that command forbidden?
2007-05-07T11:58:00.000Z	Pici	Ali_ix	What I'm saying is that that command automatically spams other channels alerting them to say that theres an issue here.  Just want to make you aware.
