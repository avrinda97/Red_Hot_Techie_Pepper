2009-08-04T11:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	of course it can
2009-08-04T11:34:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	not efficiently.
2009-08-04T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	why not efficiently?
2009-08-04T11:35:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	ok you could do things with bridges...
2009-08-04T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	if a pc is on 24/7, why use a switch and a PC if the PC can achieve both
2009-08-04T11:35:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	cause the cheapest hardware switch will outperform a pc at switching packets.
2009-08-04T11:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	i'm sure the slowdown will masively impact a casual user
2009-08-12T12:17:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	no garuntee it's a directory
2009-08-12T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	could use: find . -name Work -exec file {} \;
2009-08-12T12:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	never understod the semicolon after ] in bash, in C it would never output anything ;)
2009-08-12T12:22:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	[ -d Work is a command
2009-08-12T12:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	sure but its in brackets which to me kinda isolates it as the test case
2009-08-12T12:24:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	but what I'm saying is is the opening bracket is a command
2009-08-12T12:24:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	and the closing one is just syntactic fluff
2009-08-12T12:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	gotcha
2009-08-12T12:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	thanks
2011-12-06T12:14:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	really I thought nvidia support only arrived quite recently due to dave airlie's efforts
2011-12-06T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	it's been ages. I was running proprietary driver on my Riva TNT2 Ultra 32Mb
2011-12-06T12:19:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	new mail notification over music or something
2011-12-06T12:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	yeah I disable all that stuff, stupid beeps and chirps for events really are redundant
2011-12-06T12:20:00.000Z	nevyn	ActionParsnip	there's reasons to do it tho
2011-12-06T12:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nevyn	not here unity-mail uses notify osd nicely
