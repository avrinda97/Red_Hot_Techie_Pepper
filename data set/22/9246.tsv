2006-03-09T16:59:00.000Z	slabby		happyfool : do you know how i can install mc from command line? (my GUI does not work im trying to fix it)
2006-03-09T16:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	you need to add the universe repo to sources.list
2006-03-09T17:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	'sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list'
2006-03-09T17:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	look for the line with 'universe' in and uncomment it (remove the '#' at the start of the line
2006-03-09T17:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	then save the file, run 'sudo apt-get update' and try the install command again
2006-03-09T17:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	Ctrl-W or Ctrl-X, i think
2006-03-09T17:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	there should be a list at the bottom of the screen
2006-03-09T17:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	are you using irc from a different computer ?
2006-03-09T17:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	you can download the necessary packages manually from packages.ubuntu.com, but it'll be painful
2006-03-09T17:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	are you planning on connecting the linux machine to the internet?
2006-03-09T17:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	i think getting your internet connection working should be your first priority; installing extra software will be much easier thereafter
2006-03-09T17:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	the wiki has some info on wifi; i've never used it myself
2006-03-09T17:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	slabby	sounds good. might also help getting wifi going
