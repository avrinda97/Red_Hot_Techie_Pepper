2009-11-12T20:53:00.000Z	ecm		what is wrong with you
2009-11-12T20:53:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	we're all volunteers and don't know everything?
2009-11-12T20:54:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	you asked how to burn the iso.  that was the answer
2009-11-12T20:57:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	yes, brasero is dvd and cd iso burning software
2009-11-12T20:57:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	do you have a checksum of the ISO image?
2009-11-12T20:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	then if you only have one chance, I'd verify that the iso is good before burning
2009-11-12T20:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	this is where it might get hard, so do not yell at me about it being windows.  You have to check with the site that gave you the iso
2009-11-12T20:59:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	where ever you got the iso should give you a MD5 hash to verify against the command that eXlin gave you
2009-11-12T21:01:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	the easiest way to tell is to use the live cd to make sure
2009-11-12T21:02:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	it will, provided the motherboard is 64 bit.
2009-11-12T21:03:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	some motherboards (like the Dell 620) is 32 bit even though the chip is 32 bit, so it cannot use all 4 gb, even though Dell claims it supports 4gb
2009-11-12T21:03:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	I mean the chip is 64 bit
2009-11-12T21:05:00.000Z	mbeierl	ecm	I want to make sure you understand that some motherboard manufacturers cheap out and give you 32bit bioses even with 64bit chips.  So if only 3.2gb of memory are available and you are running ubuntu 64bit on it, it can be the mobo, not the OS's fault
