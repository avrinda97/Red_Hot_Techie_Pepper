2005-04-28T14:39:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		I was wondering how to get amarok to work with gnome also
2005-04-28T14:41:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	amarok-gstreamer might help you
2005-04-29T05:39:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	emacs!
2005-04-29T05:40:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	maybe gaim....gaim works right
2005-04-29T07:24:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	get the bank to refund your costs ;)
2005-06-28T05:41:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	what does that script do?
2005-06-28T05:44:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	if this is do-able without sudo, it would be nice
2005-06-28T05:44:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	djm62	the script allows you to watch Yahoo launch music videos
2005-06-28T05:44:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	djm62	sudo is necessary for simplicity
2005-06-28T05:45:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	I can see what it's doing, and it's nothing against your script, just the idea of downloading scripts and running with sudo.... :-S
2005-06-28T05:46:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	djm62	read the script if you'd like, its all open for you to read
2005-06-28T05:47:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	I have, and understand it...I did a similar thing on ipaq, this is aesthetic/cultural rather than technical
2005-06-28T05:48:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	have you considered taking a look at the firefox extension "checky" and implementing it as a trivial variation on that?
2005-06-28T05:48:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	no root needed, more integrated with (a) browser
2005-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=593 :-/
2005-06-28T05:54:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	djm62	I tried that and it didn't work for me.
2005-06-28T05:55:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	could you make it work?
2005-06-28T05:56:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	it's javascript...you might be fine since you've worked out the text chopping
2005-06-28T05:57:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	djm62	have you tried the extension?
2005-06-28T05:57:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	not just yet, have just installed
2005-06-28T05:58:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	djm62	try it for me please
2005-06-28T05:59:00.000Z	djm62	thechitowncubs	I get a load of passwd requests
