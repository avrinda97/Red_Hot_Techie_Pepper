2010-10-30T12:47:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	what problem are you having?
2010-10-30T13:02:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	type man Xorg
2010-10-30T13:04:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	negative
2010-10-30T13:05:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	did you get an error?
2010-10-30T13:05:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	no file materialized
2010-10-30T13:06:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	maybe you can do it while Xorg is running.
2010-10-30T13:07:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	it didn't create one
2010-10-30T13:07:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	I did, nothing there
2010-10-30T13:09:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	you got sudo Xorg -configure
2010-10-30T13:09:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	I tried it in a terminal and at console, it always complains that X is already running on display 0
2010-10-30T13:10:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	I don't know if you're using Xorg for IRC but down it then sudo Xorg -configure, and it will work.
2010-10-30T13:11:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	if you need to down Xorg or its hung up you can do the following: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop; sudo killall Xorg; sudo Xorg -configure
2010-10-30T13:12:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	I can't run Xorg right now cause mine is crashing. I've done that command sequence about 30 times.
2010-10-30T13:13:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	okay, yeah, had to stop X first, I used:  sudo service gdm stop
2010-10-30T13:13:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	nice
2010-10-30T13:13:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	I use irssi in screen :)
2010-10-30T13:13:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	nice
2010-10-30T13:14:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	I just Xchat -display
2010-10-30T13:15:00.000Z	monday	Gnea	but screen is dope! I love that app
2010-10-30T13:18:00.000Z	Gnea	monday	yeah, thanks for your help :)
