2012-06-28T02:28:00.000Z	Elvano		Cottus,
2012-06-28T02:30:00.000Z	Elvano		Well my card, that's a hard one. I have an Acer Travelmate 5720. It has an onboard Intel Express chipset @ schultza , ActionParsnip
2012-06-28T02:31:00.000Z	Elvano		Nope, never had to "switch" @ ActionParsnip
2012-06-28T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	Fn+F5 or FN+F6
2012-06-28T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	what video chip d you use? Does the system have a make and model?
2012-06-28T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	is there a key to switch to the other outputs?
2012-06-28T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	the keyboard layout has weird icons
2012-06-28T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	do you have your manual handy?
2012-06-28T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	yep just checked your manual, it's Fn+F5
2012-06-28T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	did you not think kto check this?
2012-06-28T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	what if you press it twice in succession
2012-06-28T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-06-28T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	are there any bugs reported?
2012-06-30T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	you don't edit grub.cfg
2012-06-30T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	run:  gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub     and add it in the quotes with: quiet splash   then run: sudo update-grub
2012-06-30T23:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	its old or wrong, the grub.cfg file is generated when you run: update-grub   or when a new kernel is added (which then reruns the same command)
2012-06-30T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	so you add it in /etc/default/grub  then run: sudo update-grub   this will apply the new boot option to the standing kernels as well as future kernels
2012-06-30T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	after you add the option, run: sudo update-grub  then mbr is untouched but the grub config is updated
2012-06-30T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	np dude
2012-06-30T23:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	you add the boot option in the quotes, so if you want to disable ipv6, you can change: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"   to: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash ipv6.disable=1"
2012-06-30T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	you don't just add stuff because the whim takes you, the boot options are to achieve a goal
2012-09-14T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elvano	the amount of space it uses is minimal, why not just leave it?
