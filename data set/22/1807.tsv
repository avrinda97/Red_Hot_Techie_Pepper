2012-07-05T05:16:00.000Z	tking		pls anything i can do to improve battery life? i have dual OS, on windows my battery lasts for 4hours while Ubuntu only last 2hrs
2012-07-05T05:17:00.000Z	clock	tking	is it battery life while being used or while being idle?
2012-07-05T05:18:00.000Z	tking		clock while being used
2012-07-05T05:18:00.000Z	clock	tking	can you first determine the typical CPU usage under Windows and under Linux?
2012-07-05T05:18:00.000Z	clock		under Linux the top command for example
2012-07-05T05:18:00.000Z	clock		under Windows there a graph for it
2012-07-05T05:19:00.000Z	clock	tking	if the CPU load is 2x more under Linux then it may be the cause
2012-07-05T05:19:00.000Z	tking	clock	determin how?
2012-07-05T05:19:00.000Z	clock	tking	do you know how to run commands in Ubuntu?
2012-07-05T05:20:00.000Z	tking		yes, but dont know command to check battery, pls advice
2012-07-05T05:20:00.000Z	tking	clock	i do know some basics like sudo apt-get ....
2012-07-05T05:21:00.000Z	clock	tking	yes so run command "top" and it will display CPU usage, even divided by process name
2012-07-05T05:21:00.000Z	clock	tking	I would suggest watching this while doing your typical work
2012-07-05T05:22:00.000Z	clock	tking	do you watch Youtube videos a lot?
2012-07-05T05:22:00.000Z	tking	clock	not really, but i work on designing web page and learning c++,
2012-07-05T05:23:00.000Z	clock	tking	I would check the CPU usage
2012-07-05T05:23:00.000Z	clock	tking	and the brightness of display is identical under Linux and Windows?
2012-07-05T05:24:00.000Z	tking		clock yes, brightnes is identical, i do more stuff requiring cpu and memory on windows than on linux
2012-07-05T05:28:00.000Z	tking	clock	jthan, jrdnn don't know if anyone can come do some settings for me using teamviewer just asking pls i dont want to mess with ubuntu cos i hv re-installed 4 times in just 1month
2012-07-05T05:30:00.000Z	clock	tking	because of the battery eating?
2012-07-05T05:31:00.000Z	tking		clock yes pls, i cant understand the powertop i ran cos i dont understand yet too much on ubuntu, hving too many probs as a novice :)
2012-07-05T05:35:00.000Z	clock	tking	I think it has nothing to do with novice
