2008-02-20T08:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	I second what bazhang said.. it's much easier.. unless you're doing development tweeking and need to distroy one of the systems just for experimentation
2008-02-20T08:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	are you using ubuntu now.. how about trying "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop" from the terminal then log out click the sessions button and change to kde.. lots of fun :)
2008-02-20T08:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	you might also look at installing with the alternate cd since it gives you lvm (logical volume management) an easy way to use several drives as one when the need arrises.
2008-02-20T08:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	caps make a difference.. all lower case
2008-02-20T08:43:00.000Z	Laney_Family	Scunizi	i verified my caps were all lowercase
2008-02-20T08:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	are you on the live cd?
2008-02-20T08:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	or is it installed.. (I didn't catch the beginning of your conversation with bazhang )
2008-02-20T08:45:00.000Z	Laney_Family	Scunizi	no its not installed, never get that far
2008-02-20T08:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	ah.. that's part of the problem.. you can't install kubuntu-desktop with the live cd.. it takes space that you probably don't have in ram.
2008-02-20T08:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	that would be the standard live cd.. the alternate is not live but a "text" install.. just as easy to install .. just a couple of more options.
2008-02-20T08:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	is Windows currently on the machine?  If so you can dual boot if you want.
2008-02-20T08:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	could be a problem with the cd.. you have to burn it at the slowest speed possible.  Also there's a difference between burning an ISO vs. data..
2008-02-20T08:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	did you burn from windows?
2008-02-20T08:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	ok.. if you have edubuntu you can install that then "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" to get the standard Ubuntu desktop.. then sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop" for the kde environment.
2008-02-20T08:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	sure.. server then install the gui.. that works too.
2008-02-20T08:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	you can install using the same lines I gave before.. and no you have to have an internet connection
2008-02-20T08:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	drivers?  most are included unless you have something out of the norm.. It's not like windows where you install the system then install a bunch of drivers then the programs.
2008-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	ldap yes I think so.. active directory is another story.. that you should ask in /join #ubuntu-server
2008-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	that's been an issue for some time.. and there is/are solutions in the works.. I think evolution (pim) and Kontact (pim) will interface to some extent.. but not sure how much.
2008-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	you might also look into Zimbra as a web based PIM..
2008-02-20T09:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	it's server based and will interface with Outlook, Evolution, Kontact etc.. POP, Imap, and if you're lucky.. Active Directory.
2008-02-20T09:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	Laney_Family	sure..  the server install should take maybe 20 to 30 minutes.
