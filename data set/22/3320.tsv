2008-11-01T01:11:00.000Z	kane77		how do I install 32bit libs on amd64?
2008-11-01T01:12:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	They should already be installed
2008-11-01T01:15:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	hmm.. yes they seem to.. so what else do I need to run programs under wine? because they don't run now (and yet they do run on 32-bit ubuntu)
2008-11-01T01:21:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	u get ur wine issue figured out?
2008-11-01T01:22:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	no :( I am not able to install and/or run most of programs on my amd64.. do you have any idea?
2008-11-01T01:23:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	What version of wine?
2008-11-01T01:23:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	1.0.1 (the one that is in intrepid)
2008-11-01T01:23:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	any particular errors, or warnings?
2008-11-01T01:25:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	Unhandled page fault on execute access to 0x... at address 0x.. (thread 0010), starting debugger...
2008-11-01T01:26:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	Your programs are in ntfs partition yeah?
2008-11-01T01:26:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	yes
2008-11-01T01:26:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	And they worked prior to upgrade?
2008-11-01T01:27:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	I have not been running too much of windows stuff, but yes it has
2008-11-01T01:27:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	not the same program though
2008-11-01T01:28:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	I had the same issue... your /etc/fstab entry has been changed... you no longer have permission to run because its mounted w/ root as owner i bet... probably as ntfs instead of ntfs-3g
2008-11-01T01:29:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	I will try to move it to ext3 fs and see how it goes thank you
2008-11-01T01:29:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	No, thats way too much work
2008-11-01T01:29:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	I will have to go away for a while now
2008-11-01T01:30:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	There is an easier fix, fyi
2008-11-01T01:30:00.000Z	kane77	Tundrayeti312	what it is?
2008-11-01T01:31:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	If you go to Applications->System-Tools-> is there an app called ntfs-3g?
2008-11-01T01:38:00.000Z	Tundrayeti312	kane77	u there?
