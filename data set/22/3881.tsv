2008-05-04T14:05:00.000Z	glick	abdul-rahmanIII	i have no idea, i know that it worked and then it stopped working a few days ago even on ubuntu 7.10 i thought that the upgrade would fix it
2008-05-04T14:06:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	show the output of ls /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree please
2008-05-04T14:07:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	try youtube with epiphany or something
2008-05-04T14:07:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	if it works in another browser like that i would just delete my .mozilla folder
2008-05-04T14:08:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	that's what I WOULD DO
2008-05-04T14:08:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	it's up to you
2008-05-04T14:09:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	it looks like you have the flash plugin installed ok
2008-05-04T14:10:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	I don't know exactly what it is, but you can get backup your bookmarks and cookies in there very easily
2008-05-04T14:10:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	and just drop them back in
2008-05-04T14:11:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	it's dirty but that's what i would do, so if anyone else has any ideas?
2008-05-04T14:13:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	good
2008-05-04T14:13:00.000Z	abdul-rahmanIII	glick	did you backup the .mozilla folder?
