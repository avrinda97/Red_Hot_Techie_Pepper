2007-07-05T08:33:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	Do not paste in here!
2007-07-05T08:33:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	Paste that to a pastebin.
2007-07-05T08:38:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	I fail to figure out what causes that error
2007-07-05T08:38:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	have you done anything with the code, e.g., apply patches?
2007-07-05T08:40:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	do you have build-essential installed?
2007-07-05T08:41:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	I mean, apt-get
2007-07-05T08:41:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	If the compilation fails at the first file, it might be because you're missing a few files
2007-07-05T08:44:00.000Z	Larry	dazjorz	 It does not give that error at the first file, it does quite a bit before that happens.  I'll try to redownload the source and start over from the beginning.  This is my first build, so it's been trial and error.  I've learned alot already.  Thank you for the help
2007-07-05T08:45:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	Make sure you have build-essential installed and try if the newest kernel from kernel.org compiles correctly
2007-07-05T08:47:00.000Z	Larry	dazjorz	 I will try that.  I've been using the source from kernel.ubuntu.com retrieved with git
2007-07-05T08:47:00.000Z	dazjorz	Larry	I never tried building Ubuntu's kernel before, but kernel.org kernels worked just fine for me
2007-07-05T08:48:00.000Z	Larry	dazjorz	thanks, i'll try that.
