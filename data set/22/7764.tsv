2010-07-14T13:42:00.000Z	cipher_		to be a little more specif in regards to my original issue: is there any way to remove incomplete package downloads?
2010-07-14T13:42:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Hm, apt-get clean, maybe?
2010-07-14T13:43:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	apt-get clean normally removes the package files (e.g. the files used to install stuff, not the actual files that are installed). It'd make sense to me for it to clean up partials as well.
2010-07-14T13:43:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Do you have any other synaptic, apt-get, etc, running?
2010-07-14T13:46:00.000Z	cipher_	puff	after running clean i am still getting these problems, and i am pretty sure they didnt even have a change to start downloading?
2010-07-14T13:53:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Ugh, I've been here before...
2010-07-14T13:54:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	It looks like one of your packages failed to install.
2010-07-14T13:55:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Maybe try sudo aptitude -reinstall on the package.
2010-07-14T13:55:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	the power cord thing is actually good news, since the alternative is that you got wedged in some dependency conflict.
2010-07-14T13:55:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	I've sorted those out in the past, but only with help.
2010-07-14T13:55:00.000Z	cipher_	puff	thanks will brb
2010-07-14T13:56:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	You might have to apt-get remove, apt-get install.  Or possibly (not sure) apt-get purge.
2010-07-14T13:56:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	apt-get remove doesn't remove any config files that the installer set up in /etc, apt-get purge clears those out.
2010-07-14T13:57:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Er, actually  I recommend using aptitude instead of apt-get.  Apt-get has some oddities about its syntax, aptitude tries to be apt-get flavored, but easier to use.
2010-07-14T13:59:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	You did aptitude remove?
2010-07-14T14:00:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	If this is a newly installed system, you might be best off starting from scratch (I know it grates, but...)".
2010-07-14T14:00:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Hm, sounds like you're out of my depth... sorry.
2010-07-14T14:00:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Maybe check back here later, see if somebody else can help you sort it out.
2010-07-14T14:00:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	OR maybe on ##linux.
2010-07-14T14:01:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	gparted?
2010-07-14T14:01:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	Basically, what's happened is, one install is broken, if you install anything else, it will also try to finish that install.
2010-07-14T14:01:00.000Z	puff	cipher_	And it will spit the error messages out at you.
