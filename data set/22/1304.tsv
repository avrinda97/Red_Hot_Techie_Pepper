2010-07-09T02:39:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	press CTRL+F1 this will lead you to the console, kill any frozen process then come back to the desktop enviroment using CTRL+F7
2010-07-09T02:39:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	or in System -> Administration -> System Monitor
2010-07-09T02:40:00.000Z	Chikokishi	Sensiva	i just tried CTRL+f1, but nothing happened
2010-07-09T02:40:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	sorry its CTRL+ALT+F1 and CTRL+ALT+F7
2010-07-09T02:41:00.000Z	Chikokishi	Sensiva	 Holy crap.. i totally thought i had destroyed my computer when i did that.. hahaha
2010-07-09T02:42:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	nope you didn't , maybe you need to crawl a bit in Ubuntu community documentation, its an interesting place for brief technical articles that for sure would help you
2010-07-09T02:42:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	and who knows one day you might enlighten us with your articles as well ;)
2010-07-09T02:43:00.000Z	Chikokishi	Sensiva	so once i get to the console thing.. How would i shut down the program that is frozen?
2010-07-09T02:43:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	first you need to know its process PID by listing all running process using "ps" , then kill it using kill <pid>
2010-07-09T02:44:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	if the currently running processes are many using grep is a good idea, "ps | grep rhythmbox" ◀▬▬  that who list only rhythmbox
2010-07-09T02:45:00.000Z	Chikokishi	Sensiva	ok i went into the consol and logged in and tryied ps.  but it didnt tell me anything about running programs.
2010-07-09T02:45:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	ps -A then
2010-07-09T02:46:00.000Z	Sensiva	Chikokishi	a capital A not small a
2010-07-09T02:46:00.000Z	Chikokishi	Sensiva	ok let me try.
