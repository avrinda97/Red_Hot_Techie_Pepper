2009-01-19T08:45:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	thanks. is wodim good?
2009-01-19T08:46:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	It's very basic.  You need some frontend like k3b to make it easier to use.
2009-01-19T08:46:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	and from a I'm trying to conserve resources perspective?
2009-01-19T08:47:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	If you're trying to conserve resources, the best thing to do is use wodim at a command line.
2009-01-19T08:47:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	A more basic package is X-CDRoast that will give you a GUI but is less "fat" than k3b.
2009-01-19T08:48:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	is there anything already installed on ubuntu that does the trick?
2009-01-19T08:48:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	i'm aiming for something really low resource. prefereably no gui
2009-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	i hate the speed difference between GUI progs and shell progs
2009-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	xcdroast is pretty fast.
2009-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	But the fastest is to use mkisofs and wodim/cdrecord yourself, obviously. :-)
2009-01-19T08:50:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	I'm more worried about the ROM than RAM. ie, the space it takes up on the disk
2009-01-19T08:51:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	xcdroast only depends on GTK and xlibs, in case you already have those.
2009-01-19T08:52:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	i like the challenge of remembering the shell commands for programs. also if i use the commands a lot i tend to things a lot faster than on the gnome apps
2009-01-19T08:53:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	i think i have the GTK libs, not too sure about the xlibs
2009-01-19T08:53:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	GTK depends on xlibs :-)
2009-01-19T08:54:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	which i guess means i have both then ;)
2009-01-19T08:54:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	how do you know this stuff btw?
2009-01-19T08:55:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	Like a pair of pants accumulates lint.
2009-01-19T08:55:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	so how long have you been using unix/linux ?
2009-01-19T08:55:00.000Z	runderwo	Tyrath	offtopic, but I first installed slack in 96.
2009-01-19T08:56:00.000Z	Tyrath	runderwo	ahh cool. sorry to go offtopic :/
