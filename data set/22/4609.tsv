2007-12-03T00:31:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	/dev/video0 definitely doesn't exist?
2007-12-03T00:31:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	If i'm looking in the right place (/dev) the file doesn't exist. Will it be created?
2007-12-03T00:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	have you got access to /dev/video{,0,1,...} ?
2007-12-03T00:29:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	How would I know? I can't get to that location from Terminal, if that's any help
2007-12-03T00:30:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	well the webcam outputs to a file called /dev/video0 most probably, and its always a good start to ensure you can read it
2007-12-03T00:31:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	so just "sudo chown <username> /dev/video0" before you try using it
2007-12-03T00:31:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	I'm looking in /dev right now; No video0
2007-12-03T00:31:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	modprobe gspca
2007-12-03T00:32:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	that command forces the modem's kernel module to load
2007-12-03T00:32:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	Ok done that
2007-12-03T00:33:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	now does that file exist?
2007-12-03T00:33:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	pastebin the output of "lsusb" for me please

2007-12-03T00:36:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	that's all i can find sorry.
2007-12-03T00:37:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	rest of that thread may be handy
2007-12-03T00:38:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	Oh wow that sucks... I'll try, but now not so hopeful :( Thanks for your help PriceChild! :)
2007-12-03T00:38:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	it looks kinda helpful
2007-12-03T00:39:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	Yeah, but image quality was said to be low... Either way, i'll give it a go :)
2007-12-03T00:49:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	Ok, tried all that and I still get "Could not connect to video device (/dev/video0)."
2007-12-03T00:50:00.000Z	PriceChild	Cherubael	because it doesn't exist?
2007-12-03T00:51:00.000Z	Cherubael	PriceChild	Indeed, no video0 file
