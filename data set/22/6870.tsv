2006-07-08T12:05:00.000Z	YtseJam		Hrm
2006-07-08T12:06:00.000Z	YtseJam		And BTW, I can't use the other box, err. :)
2006-07-08T12:07:00.000Z	YtseJam		I got the Desktop CD .iso, burned it and made sure its bootable...
2006-07-08T12:07:00.000Z	YtseJam		And I get DOS. hah.
2006-07-08T12:08:00.000Z	YtseJam		I see it scans for devices and finds the partitions I have, but it stops with the DOS prompt.
2006-07-08T12:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	that's probably a Linux command prompt rather than a DOS prompt, just to be accurate
2006-07-08T12:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	try "ls" for listing files
2006-07-08T12:10:00.000Z	YtseJam	Madpilot	I tried. nothing.
2006-07-08T12:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	how did you manage to get to a DOS prompt during a Linux install? (or have I misunderstood how you got there?)
2006-07-08T12:13:00.000Z	YtseJam	Madpilot	I'm trying Ubuntu 6.06's Desktop CD ("LiveCD"). After boot I got a Caldera DR-DOS prompt instead of having something, a GUI, to load...
2006-07-08T12:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	that's a neat trick... is this a burned CD or a pressed ShipIt one?>
2006-07-08T12:14:00.000Z	YtseJam	Madpilot	burned .iso.
2006-07-08T12:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	when you first stick the LiveCd in, one of the options is "Check This CD" - try that
2006-07-08T12:15:00.000Z	YtseJam	Madpilot	I get nothing like that.
2006-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	you should get a short menu, "Run Ubuntu" at the top, and a couple of other options
2006-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	YtseJam	Madpilot	should.
2006-07-08T12:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	either you've got a bad burn, or a bad ISO download
2006-07-08T12:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	did you run md5sum on the ISO after you downloaded it?
2006-07-08T12:18:00.000Z	YtseJam	Madpilot	no.
2006-07-08T12:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	Desktop = LiveCD for Dapper
2006-07-08T12:19:00.000Z	YtseJam	Madpilot	yeah I know (there really should be 1 name for it. ;))
2006-07-08T12:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	YtseJam	it used to be called LiveCD, now it's just Desktop - it's a new name for Dapper, so people are still using the old one, just to confuse everyone
