2005-09-28T16:37:00.000Z	rdfm		can anybody help with my pppoe problems under breezy? I have already searched the forums and google for breezy dsl-provider pppoe and found some pointers but none similar to my problem...
2005-09-28T16:39:00.000Z	HaNazir	rdfm	whats the prob?
2005-09-28T16:40:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	in particular plugin rp-pppoe.so ath0
2005-09-28T16:40:00.000Z	HaNazir	rdfm	when u run sudo pppeconf what do u get?
2005-09-28T16:41:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	it finds the pppoe concentrator on the ath0 device
2005-09-28T16:41:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	i answer all the questions and creates the dsl-provider file
2005-09-28T16:45:00.000Z	HaNazir	rdfm	it creates the files, and when u reboot it doesnt connect?
2005-09-28T16:46:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	no, the problem is that pppoe does not put a newline between plugin rp-pppoe.so and the ath0 device
2005-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	HaNazir	rdfm	is this wireless stuff?
2005-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	yes
2005-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	mad-wifi
2005-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	atheros AR5212
2005-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	HaNazir	rdfm	netgear?
2005-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	conceptronics
2005-09-28T16:51:00.000Z	HaNazir	rdfm	weird i thought ubuntu detected atheros
2005-09-28T16:52:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	it does detect it, it pings other hosts, it finds the pppoe access concentrator but
2005-09-28T16:52:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	it was not setup automatically (I had to fudge with /etc/network/interfaces to make it work in kubuntu)
2005-09-28T16:53:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	pppd does not like it...
2005-09-28T16:55:00.000Z	HaNazir	rdfm	and http://www.linux-wireless.org/Drivers/
2005-09-28T16:56:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	hell no man, mad-wifi drivers work perfectly!
2005-09-28T16:56:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	this is a ubuntu-specific problem....
2005-09-30T12:22:00.000Z	rdfm	HaNazir	hi, in the end, I filed a bug for pppoeconf
