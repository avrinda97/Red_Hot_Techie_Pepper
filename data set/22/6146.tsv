2007-01-03T15:37:00.000Z	kejup		Hi everyone
2007-01-03T15:37:00.000Z	kejup		I just tried a fresh install of Edgy, but it won't let me login. I'm getting the error message "Incorrect username or password".
2007-01-03T15:38:00.000Z	kejup		Does anyone know how to fix this problem with edgy?
2007-01-03T15:38:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	logins are case sensitive.
2007-01-03T15:39:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	I know, I'm pretty sure this is a problem with edgy, as google reveals many people with the same problem.
2007-01-03T15:40:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	ah, another reason to avoid it. So you'll have to log in with recovery mode, or whatever it is called.
2007-01-03T15:41:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	Eh, I'd prefer to avoid hacks on a fresh install, I'd rather just reinstall, but I'm afraid it will just happen again.
2007-01-03T15:41:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	its not a hack, just resetting the password.
2007-01-03T15:44:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	yeah, but 1. it could be the username 2. whatever screwed up the password the first time might have screwed something else up too
2007-01-03T15:45:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	so reset them both.
2007-01-03T15:47:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	I don't know everything done during an ubuntu installation and I'm not comfortable with manually overriding it. Sure, 9/10 little hacks like you are suggesting work, but every once in a while they foobar some special script in the distro which ends up screwing up your upgrade a year down the road.
2007-01-03T15:48:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	do what ever you want, my 'hack" involves on command.
2007-01-03T15:50:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	and how do you know that command doesn't circumvent some other initialization that was supposed to be performed by the ubuntu install? Something is borked with the Edgy install, I'd like to figure out what it is instead of working around it.
2007-01-03T15:51:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	why would adduser and passwd do that?
2007-01-03T15:52:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	do what ever you want.
2007-01-03T15:53:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	there could be some installtion script that first generates the username/pass and then does something else. If it failed to generate the username it probably didn't do the something else. If I generate the username manually then it still won't do the something else.
2007-01-03T15:54:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	could be?
2007-01-03T15:55:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	yeah, could be......and I don't want to find out 4 months from now when I try to install/upgrading something and my whole system gets borked because of the missing "something else".
2007-01-03T15:56:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	so then why are you playing with Edgy in the first place, Dapper is the stable LTS version.
2007-01-03T15:56:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	I'm a glutten for punishment :)
2007-01-03T15:56:00.000Z	n2diy	kejup	well, your getting it! :)
2007-01-03T16:53:00.000Z	kejup	n2diy	I just finished reinstalling. This time I didn't use the automatic keyboard selection (I just used the default US keyboard). I also used a password without any special characters. Not sure which one fixed the problem.
