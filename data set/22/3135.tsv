2010-06-13T19:46:00.000Z	julien__		hi
2010-06-13T19:47:00.000Z	julien__		I have so far managed to take care of my issues... but this one.. I would appreciate some help
2010-06-13T19:47:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	fine, ask a question
2010-06-13T19:49:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	its ctrl+alt=f[1-6] to get to a console
2010-06-13T19:50:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	thats impressive...every f key?
2010-06-13T19:50:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	sounds like a bork...can you boot into a previous setup? like previous kernel
2010-06-13T19:51:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	possibly, but it's beyopnd me:/
2010-06-13T19:53:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	i presume u use grub? use on of the other options?
2010-06-13T19:53:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	grub is before that? press esc on boot up see if you can show grub?
2010-06-13T19:58:00.000Z	julien__	mickster04	I will try that. if I manage to restart the computer.... (I seem not to be in a terminal... ctrl+alt+f1 and then sudo shutdown now does not reboot...)
2010-06-13T19:59:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	sudo reboot too
2010-06-13T20:03:00.000Z	julien__	mickster04	tried. it is black screen aalll the way. :/
2010-06-13T20:03:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	heh that sucks:/
2010-06-13T20:03:00.000Z	julien__	mickster04	is there a way I could fix this by booting from a cd?
2010-06-13T20:03:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	its beyond me then:(
2010-06-13T20:03:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	mayb, but i wouldn't know how:(
2010-06-13T20:07:00.000Z	julien__	mickster04	yey!! I am in grub
2010-06-13T20:07:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	how?
2010-06-13T20:09:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	oh i thought thats what you did originally:D
2010-06-13T20:10:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	fairynuff
2010-06-13T20:11:00.000Z	julien__	mickster04	is there any way to be clever about which kernel I should start? (would prefer to use as few power-button-shutdowns as possible). I have 2.6.28.19 genereic and then in recovery mode, then I also have .17, .16, .... .14
2010-06-13T20:11:00.000Z	mickster04	julien__	run in recovery mode, do whatever you normally do to fix it then try again in normal mode
