2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	mikejet		How often do you guys download updates? 8.10 is working great here on adm64 / 2cpu.
2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	once a day
2008-10-31T19:34:00.000Z	mikejet	Slart	How do you know that today's update is legit? It's not even listed on the security updates webpage.
2008-10-31T19:35:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	"legit"? I've just set it to download updates once a day and apply security fixes right away
2008-10-31T20:18:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	try changing the keyboard shortcuts in compiz if you're using the desktop effects
2009-01-14T21:50:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	size?.. how do you mean?
2009-01-14T21:50:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	ah..hmm
2009-01-14T22:48:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	what part of yahoo.com is slow for you?
2009-01-14T22:54:00.000Z	mikejet	Slart	: typing into the Search bar isn't exactly realtime. It takes a second for the typed text to show up sometimes.  Re: yahoo.com
2009-01-14T22:56:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	no problems here.. there is a little lag but I guess that's because it does "search as you type".. and it's nowhere near a second.. more like 1/10 of a second
2009-01-14T22:56:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	you are running the regular flash plugin?
2009-01-14T22:56:00.000Z	mikejet	Slart	: I think so. Im on x86_64.
2009-01-14T22:57:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	ok, you are using the non free flash, right?
2009-01-14T23:00:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	it's doing a lot of stuff "behind the scenes" for each keypress.. if you're using a slow dns that might be what is killing it
2009-01-14T23:00:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	you can try installing a caching dns server too
2009-04-18T01:23:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	do you know of an url I could try? something that ought to crash the 64bit flash plugin?
2009-05-20T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	I think GIMP uses the regular fonts.. including ttf fonts
2009-05-31T00:49:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	there are plugins that let you fake the useragent
2009-08-31T00:13:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	you could make the interface that has the internet connection ipv6 only ?
2009-08-31T00:13:00.000Z	mikejet	Slart	: How do you specify that?
2009-08-31T00:14:00.000Z	Slart	mikejet	I think you can set it up either in /etc/network/interfaces.. or perhaps in the network manager.. not really sure but that's where I would start looking
2009-08-31T00:14:00.000Z	mikejet	Slart	: okay, thanks.
