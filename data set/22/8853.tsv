2005-05-08T09:28:00.000Z	Linforcer		Didnt know I could build a library int hat
2005-05-08T09:29:00.000Z	Linforcer		Not as good as Picasa2 :( but well... one must make some sacrafices switching to Linux

2005-05-08T09:29:00.000Z	Nalioth	Linforcer	sacrifices?
2005-05-08T09:30:00.000Z	Linforcer	Nalioth	yes, such as that there is no driver for my webcam
2005-05-08T09:30:00.000Z	Nalioth	Linforcer	really? one would think that there would be something out there
2005-05-08T09:30:00.000Z	Linforcer	Nalioth	and Nalioth, well the fact is, it's a digital camera which can also be used as a webcam
2005-05-08T09:31:00.000Z	Nalioth	Linforcer	ah
2005-05-08T09:31:00.000Z	Linforcer	Nalioth	so noone bothered to make more than just the "get pics from it" kinda thing
2005-05-08T09:31:00.000Z	Linforcer		It works in that aspect
2005-05-08T09:31:00.000Z	Nalioth	Linforcer	and the linux webcam stuff don't work either, eh?
2005-05-08T09:31:00.000Z	Linforcer		I don't know, where would i find generic webca, drivers?
2005-05-08T09:33:00.000Z	Nalioth	Linforcer	did you search sourceforge?
2005-05-08T09:33:00.000Z	Linforcer	Nalioth	yeah, but that was months ago
2005-05-08T09:33:00.000Z	Linforcer	Nalioth	and I wasnt sure what to look for... I guess Im still not
2005-05-08T09:34:00.000Z	Linforcer		curses, now where did that cam go
2005-05-08T09:34:00.000Z	Nalioth	Linforcer	"webcam" would be my first shot
2005-05-08T09:34:00.000Z	Linforcer		haha yeah
2005-05-08T09:34:00.000Z	Linforcer		you wanna know how many results you'd get?
