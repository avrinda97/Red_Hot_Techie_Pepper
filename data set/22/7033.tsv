2007-06-14T06:28:00.000Z	Farnaby		Seem to be having trouble mounting my secondary hdd under fiesty where I want it. It did under edgy but evidently something changed
2007-06-14T06:29:00.000Z	Farnaby		which means my card reader is probably also fubared but thats notwhere the music is stored...
2007-06-14T06:30:00.000Z	Farnaby		there is always something with an upgrade....
2007-06-14T06:30:00.000Z	Farnaby		noah, whats the issue?
2007-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	Farnaby		i need you to be more descriptive then "it won't go on"
2007-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	Farnaby		k
2007-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	Farnaby		Mind you mine uses a wired connection
2007-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	Farnaby		but i have messed with it a bit
2007-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	I actually have a wireless connection.
2007-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	 Wifi-Radar, Network-Manager, their all installed.
2007-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	Farnaby	Noah	at the moment I am wireless but thats cause the ubuntu machine is rebooting ;)
2007-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	Farnaby		and all working?
2007-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	lol
2007-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	 Wifi-Radar has my network put in.
2007-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	 It's getting recognized though.
2007-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	 When my device is unconnected it can't see what type of connection.  I'm using edgy by the way.
2007-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	 When it's connected though.
2007-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	 IT can view the type of connection.
2007-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	Farnaby		i am starting to wish I didn't upgrade tonight
2007-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	Noah	Farnaby	 It won't find the IP address.
