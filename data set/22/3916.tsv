2009-02-19T00:04:00.000Z	Jampiter		Hi
2009-02-19T00:05:00.000Z	Jampiter		How do I make the option to rotate the screen 90 degrees appear in the screen resolution menu?
2009-02-19T00:05:00.000Z	Jampiter		All that's in the drop down menu at the moment is "normal"
2009-02-19T00:05:00.000Z	Jampiter		Should I add something to xorg?
2009-02-19T00:07:00.000Z	Jampiter		Anyone?

2009-02-19T00:09:00.000Z	Jampiter	fde	I know, but the option I want is not there
2009-02-19T00:09:00.000Z	fde	Jampiter	what option do you want?
2009-02-19T00:10:00.000Z	Jampiter	fde	I want to be able to rotate the screen 90 degrees. However, only "Normal" is showing in the screen rotation drop down menu. How can I fix this?
2009-02-19T00:11:00.000Z	Jampiter	fde	Do you know how?
2009-02-19T00:12:00.000Z	fde	Jampiter	no, sorry... never had to do that, so not familiar with it
2009-02-19T00:12:00.000Z	Jampiter	fde	Oh, ok. Thanks anyway
2009-02-19T00:15:00.000Z	fde	Jampiter	^
2009-02-19T00:16:00.000Z	Jampiter	fde	That's multiple monitors, which is completely seperate from what I want to do
2009-02-19T00:17:00.000Z	fde	Jampiter	stands for X Rotation and Resolution ... so that will be about your only resource... maybe try asking in #xorg too though?
2009-02-19T00:17:00.000Z	Jampiter	fde	Ah, I see.. I'll try that channel too
2009-02-19T01:18:00.000Z	fde	Jampiter	in intrepid, there is no /etc/X11/xorg.conf ...
2009-02-19T01:19:00.000Z	Jampiter	fde	There was a few minutes ago!
