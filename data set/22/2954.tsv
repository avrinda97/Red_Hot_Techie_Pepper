2009-01-13T19:49:00.000Z	xanxor		Hi, does anybody know how I can connect my mp3 player to ubuntu so that it shows up as a hard drive instead of as a picture CD?
2009-01-13T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	if you run sudo fdisk -l you should be able to mount it if its listed, mount it as writable and yuo can load it up
2009-01-13T19:51:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	Thanks, I'll try that.
2009-01-13T19:53:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	I did what you said but I can't find which one it is in the resulting list. How do I select the right one?
2009-01-13T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	you need to look at the size and filesystem type
2009-01-13T19:54:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	Sorry, it doesn't seem to say the size.
2009-01-13T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	can you pastebinn the output please
2009-01-13T19:54:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	You mean just copy and paste what's in the terminal?
2009-01-13T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	no to pastebin
2009-01-13T19:55:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	Okay thanks, I'll do that.
2009-01-13T19:55:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	http://paste.ubuntu.com/104392/
2009-01-13T19:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	look at the top line of each block
2009-01-13T19:57:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	Haha okay, I see it now. Dunno why I didn't notice that. thanks.
2009-01-13T19:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	you have a 50Gb disk, a 16.5Gb disk and a 500Gb disk
2009-01-13T19:58:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	It's the 16.5GB. What do I do now that I know which one it is?
2009-01-13T20:00:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	Now that I know what it's called, how do I tell it to be mounted as a hard drive? The computer currently thinks it's a picture CD for osme reason.
2009-01-13T20:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	well its ntfs formatted and its name is sdc1
2009-01-13T20:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	exactly the same
2009-01-13T20:01:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	Haha okay. Thanks again for your help.
2009-01-13T20:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	just use /dev/sdc1 instead
2009-01-13T20:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	xanxor	or whatever partition is your player
2009-01-13T20:02:00.000Z	xanxor	ActionParsnip1	I think it's sdd.
