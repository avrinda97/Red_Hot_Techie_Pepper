2007-05-28T08:22:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	what kind of computer you got?
2007-05-28T08:22:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	ThePioneer	My previous compute - dell... 2.66ghz, 768mb RDRAM
2007-05-28T08:23:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	ThePioneer	so any idea? :)
2007-05-28T08:26:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	ThePioneer	SUPER slow. I never actually saw it load.. left it.. and eventually got a gnome error
2007-05-28T08:28:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	It might be the computer itself
2007-05-28T08:29:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	ThePioneer	well it was previously running windows, whihc ran fine...
2007-05-28T08:29:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	ThePioneer	hmm.. well, I also remember running lindows on it before..
2007-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	Resources on the computer might not be so great try a lower end distro
2007-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	ThePioneer	2.66Ghz & 768MB RDRAM should be plenty sufficient?
2007-05-28T08:35:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	did you mount everything correctly?
2007-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	I'm with mseney... try wiping everything again... By default it really shouldn't be that slow and I'm sure you didn't add anything to make it that slow right?
2007-05-28T08:49:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	Good Luck
2007-05-28T08:50:00.000Z	Kaitlyn2004	ThePioneer	thanks.. installing now
2007-05-28T08:51:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	Let me know how it all works out for ya... I have never run into that problem in all the time I have worked with linux
2007-05-28T08:54:00.000Z	ThePioneer	Kaitlyn2004	try using half the disk
