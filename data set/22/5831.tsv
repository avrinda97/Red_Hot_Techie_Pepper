2007-02-16T07:41:00.000Z	vladuz976		is there anything comparable to dreamweaver in linux? are serious web designers actually using linux, too?
2007-02-16T07:43:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	Nvu is an option. but dreamweaver often creates poorly functional webpages so i don't know what features you want
2007-02-16T07:45:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	but i heard it is pretty good with css, too. how about nvu
2007-02-16T07:45:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	are you using dreamweaver as a WYSIWYG or an editor?
2007-02-16T07:46:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	wysiwyg
2007-02-16T07:47:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG
2007-02-16T07:49:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	the switch between design and code (or something like that) buttons on dreamweaver allow you to use both
2007-02-16T07:50:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	you want me to read the wiki? i don't understand what you mean
2007-02-16T07:52:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	just wondering why everybody says (web)designers work on macs. i mean dreamweaver is the same on mac and windows. I thought there must be an advantage to using dreamweaver then
2007-02-16T07:52:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	who is everybody?
2007-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	blogs on deviantART and elsewhere
2007-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	im positive there a web designer on macs, windows and linux. maybe they have the majority though
2007-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	authors of templates on opensource webdesign
2007-02-16T07:57:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	if dreamweaver works for you, great. but a lot of people dislike it for many reasons. there isn't a definite right or wrong. all mac users  etc.
2007-02-16T07:58:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	i just thought i'd be nice if i could work with open source stuff instead of spending 800 + dollars on dreamweaver
2007-02-16T07:59:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	that is a very reasonable reason to not use it. what did you saw you used it for? editing (working with text like html and css) or the design part where it is a gui for making pages?
2007-02-16T08:00:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	just to put simple site togehter with the gui quickly. I'd like to learn how to do more though.
2007-02-16T08:00:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	learning how to understand the code is extremely helpful for troubleshooting.
2007-02-16T08:02:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	you know anything about amaya it's on the w3c website
2007-02-16T08:05:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	nope
2007-02-16T08:07:00.000Z	vladuz976	ehc	do nvu doesn't produce crappy code like dreamweaver does?
2007-02-16T08:08:00.000Z	ehc	vladuz976	no but i asked see what people respond
