2008-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	joel		I'm getting a bunch of permissions problems with my external with Hardy, someone help me out?
2008-04-07T00:10:00.000Z	joel		just do a manual install
2008-04-07T00:10:00.000Z	joel		when it asks about mounts or partitions
2008-04-07T00:10:00.000Z	joel		choose your Ubuntu partition
2008-04-07T00:11:00.000Z	joel		if you have no reason to keep anything on that partition I recommend formatting it
2008-04-07T00:11:00.000Z	joel		and if you don't know how to do this I wouldn't recommend a beta release
2008-04-07T00:11:00.000Z	joel		I'm using the beta and there are still problems with it
2008-04-07T00:11:00.000Z	Totem	joel	how to I know which partition is the Ubuntu partition? I have about 5 different partitions
2008-04-07T00:17:00.000Z	Totem	joel	could I identify the Ubuntu part by its file system type?
2008-04-07T00:21:00.000Z	Totem	joel	alright, but I will have to reboot. I am running Windows; I am also having internet problems with Ubuntu, but that is another issue
2008-04-07T00:24:00.000Z	Totem	joel	what is fdisk?
2008-04-07T00:26:00.000Z	Totem	joel	I can see the partitions by running the Ubuntu 8.04 liveCD. Do you want me to list what they are? What should I do after I see the paritions?
2008-04-07T00:28:00.000Z	Totem	joel	did you get me PM?
2008-04-07T00:28:00.000Z	Totem	joel	ok, then when I install, how to I select to install over the old partition?
2008-04-07T00:31:00.000Z	Totem	joel	I don't think there is a system that says Linux, but I haven't tried with that fdisk command yet.
2008-04-07T00:32:00.000Z	Totem	joel	thanks for the help, i
2008-04-07T03:28:00.000Z	Totem	joel	Thank you so much. Everything installed perfectly
2008-04-07T03:29:00.000Z	Totem	joel	I have another question though. Do you think you could help? I have a Belkin Wireless G Desktop Card and that is my only way to connect to the internet. When I bought it, it came with a cd and software to let Windows connect to the internet with it. Is there a way  that I can use this with Ubuntu?
2008-04-07T03:34:00.000Z	Totem	joel	I have seen a lot about the make command, but whenever I try to do something with it, I get a message saying that "make" is not a recognized command. What is that about?
