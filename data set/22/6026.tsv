2007-04-01T11:46:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	find the drive in "sudo lshw -short -class disk" and paste the corresponding line
2007-04-01T11:53:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	did you get the line from lshw?
2007-04-01T11:53:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	sorry.  yes it will allow that

2007-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	well i can help with that.  elaborate ..
2007-04-01T14:10:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	well what monitor do you have, what video card, and what driver are you using for the vidoe card?
2007-04-01T14:11:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	please answer the questions so we can help further
2007-04-01T14:12:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	what about the LCD?  and what driver are you using for the Radeon?
2007-04-01T14:15:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	the frequency could be varying subtlely
2007-04-01T14:15:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	it could be a faulty video card or monitor
2007-04-01T14:15:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	does it work with windows
2007-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	i guess.  i'm about to go though
2007-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	i'm not sure how to fix your problem.
2007-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	it may be a faulty connection.  but you could try other drivers for the card.
2007-04-01T14:19:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	i dont know of it, at least.  like i said try official ATi drivers
2007-04-01T14:19:00.000Z	xtknight	madmax	the drivers that come with linux can be unpredictable
