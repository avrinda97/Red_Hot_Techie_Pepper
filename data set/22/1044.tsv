2011-08-21T21:48:00.000Z	maujhsn		I am trying to set my GPG Key as my default key by entering this line in your ~/.bashrc.
2011-08-21T21:48:00.000Z	maujhsn		What is the command to grant me permission
2011-08-21T21:48:00.000Z	maujhsn		ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ~/.bashrc
2011-08-21T21:48:00.000Z	maujhsn		bash: /home/ubuntu/.bashrc: Permission denied
2011-08-21T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 you normally dont run the .bashrc
2011-08-21T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 its ran by the shell on login.
2011-08-21T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 its a text file you can EDIT if you wan tto add commands to it
2011-08-21T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 are you wanting to RUN the file? or edit the file?
2011-08-21T21:50:00.000Z	maujhsn	Dr_Willis	take a look at this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto half way down the page!
2011-08-21T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	'by entering this line in your ~/.bashrc.'   ===> to means mean you EDIT your .bashrc and put the command at the end.
2011-08-21T21:53:00.000Z	maujhsn	Dr_Willis	 Why do I feel that a sudo should be entered first?
2011-08-21T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 for editing your own USERS .bashrc? its not...
2011-08-21T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 sudo is for doing things to the whole system/system wide..
2011-08-21T22:02:00.000Z	maujhsn	Dr_Willis	zykotick9, jpds  CAN I PLEASE GET A CONSENSUS  THAT THIS IS THE TERMINAL COMMAND TO RUN "source ~/.bashrc" THEN RUN "export GPGKEY=D8FCXXXXXXX"
2011-08-21T22:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 thats actually 2 commands..
2011-08-21T22:07:00.000Z	maujhsn	Dr_Willis	YES BUT THE FIRST COMMAND IS THE IMPORTANT.
2011-08-21T22:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 the first command just rereads the  .bashrc and any commands in it...
2011-08-21T22:13:00.000Z	maujhsn	Dr_Willis	Sorry for shouting!  "~/.bashrc"!  Correct yes or no?
2011-08-21T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	 correct for what?   This is all rather basic bash stuff. You are seeming to get confused about...
2011-08-21T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maujhsn	  the command 'source' rereads the files contents..  'source foo' can be abrevveated as ' . foo' also
2011-08-21T22:16:00.000Z	maujhsn	Dr_Willis	First time using this command so yes it has caused some confusion for me!
2011-08-21T22:33:00.000Z	maujhsn	Dr_Willis	The cause for all the confusion earlier was this issue: "The program 'gpg-agent' is currently not installed."!
