2005-05-01T16:26:00.000Z	mmhg		anybody know how to release and renew a dhcp address?
2005-05-01T16:28:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	from man dhclient "The  -r flag explicitly releases the current lease, and once the lease has been released, the client exits."
2005-05-01T16:28:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	 tried that, it renewed to the same ip addr
2005-05-01T16:29:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	change your mac addr :)
2005-05-01T16:29:00.000Z	tahorg		(and ask for an other ip)
2005-05-01T16:29:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	 that worked, but I had hoped for a less devious method
2005-05-01T16:30:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	it depends on the server conf
2005-05-01T16:30:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	how so/
2005-05-01T16:30:00.000Z	mmhg		?
2005-05-01T16:30:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	you can ask him to remember the mac-ip relation
2005-05-01T16:30:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	 ahh...   didn't know that
2005-05-01T16:30:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	 thanks
2005-05-01T16:30:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	IIRC there is an option like that in dhcpd
2005-05-01T16:31:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	 didn't see dhcpcd running on my sys - is it a default ubuntu daemon?
2005-05-01T16:32:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	'what' gives you the lease ?
2005-05-01T16:32:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	a router ?
2005-05-01T16:32:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	I was talking about the server side
2005-05-01T16:33:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	mjr, kakalto:  I'm using dhclient,  server side it's coming off a university server.  Don't know the exact configuration
2005-05-01T16:33:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	dhcpd is the server, dhclient ... well, obvious ;)
2005-05-01T16:33:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	 I used to run gentoo which used dhcpcd - dhclient was new to me
2005-05-01T16:34:00.000Z	tahorg	mmhg	pump is a good option too
2005-05-01T16:35:00.000Z	mmhg	tahorg	 that's not a default ubuntu toy either - looks like I may have to do some downloading
