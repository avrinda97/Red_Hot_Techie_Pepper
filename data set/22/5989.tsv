2007-01-10T13:50:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_		Mike___ no aptg-get kde-desktop
2007-01-10T13:50:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	/ ikonia , We've banned him from #winehq because he drove us all insane
2007-01-10T13:50:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	what did he do?
2007-01-10T13:51:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	He spouts random things, insults, anything really and keeps asking stupid questions over and over (I mean really really stupid)
2007-01-10T13:52:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	u_u there are a lot of them unfortunelly
2007-01-10T13:54:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	do you have him still banned?
2007-01-10T13:54:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	yes
2007-01-10T13:55:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	just curiosity, no second chances?
2007-01-10T13:55:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	He'd been warned day after day, heh
2007-01-10T13:56:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	well he might deserve it...
2007-01-10T13:56:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	Imagine going into an insane asylum and sitting watching someone. It's like that, but it's being typed out over IRC rather than spoken
2007-01-10T14:00:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	There is only one Wine channel
2007-01-10T14:01:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	oh i see, he's doom
2007-01-10T14:01:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	that's why i dont troll, if you are a linux user community is the only way to go for help
2007-01-10T14:07:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	hmm, that info is wrong, it's "smb" you need for that, not Samba, heh (to mount Windows shares)
2007-01-10T14:07:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	smb is the command no? wasnt the program itself called Samba?
2007-01-10T14:08:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	Different things. SMB = Server Message Block
2007-01-10T14:10:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	Samba lets you share your linux folders so Windows machines can mount them. SMB is used to mount Windows shares from your Linux machine.
2007-01-10T14:11:00.000Z	Enverex	KubuntuUser_	See what I mean about Linuxero?
2007-01-10T14:13:00.000Z	KubuntuUser_	Enverex	yes i can se
