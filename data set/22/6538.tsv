2006-09-28T16:47:00.000Z	life2		how can I install the latest version of Gaim for Dapper please?
2006-09-28T16:47:00.000Z	cpk2	life2	sudo apt-get install gaim
2006-09-28T16:48:00.000Z	life2	cpk2	gaim is already the newest version.
2006-09-28T16:48:00.000Z	life2		it says newevest version, but its old and doesnt support many MSN features from others
2006-09-28T16:48:00.000Z	cpk2	life2	so you have the latest version for dapper, if you want their latest beta release then you will have to build it yourself
2006-09-28T16:48:00.000Z	life2		isnt there a newer version?
2006-09-28T16:48:00.000Z	life2	cpk2	how?
2006-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	cpk2	life2	if you are lucky someone has made a .dep and you can use that other wise you will need to download the source
2006-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	cpk2		!compile
2006-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	life2	cpk2	from?
2006-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	cpk2	life2	gaim has a website
2006-09-28T16:49:00.000Z	life2	cpk2	url?
2006-09-28T16:50:00.000Z	cpk2		google search gaim

2006-09-28T16:52:00.000Z	life2	cpk2	Gaim 2.0 beta 3 for Dapper Drake x86  <-- is that the one?
2006-09-28T16:53:00.000Z	cpk2	life2	if thats the version you want and you are using dapper with an intel chip then yes
