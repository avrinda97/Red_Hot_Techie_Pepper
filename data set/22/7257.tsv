2008-11-19T23:56:00.000Z	psusi		if one wanted to help support ubuntu financially, how would you do that?  I see that cannonical sells commercial support starting at $250 a year... is there a personal type deal you can buy?
2008-11-19T23:56:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	contact canonical and ask
2011-04-26T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	there are situations you will
2011-04-26T01:02:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	20 years ago, but not these days.. the kernel automatically creates device nodes these days
2011-04-26T01:02:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	in this situation, he will need to create it
2011-04-26T01:02:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	why?
2011-04-26T01:02:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	because it needs to make sure it's created specfically, and he's creating a degraded raid array from an inuse disk so it will not get auto created
2011-04-26T01:03:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	when you create the array with mdadm, the dev node will be created automatically
2011-04-26T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	not in a degraded array, it doesn't always pickup and he needs to amke sure it's created with the lower block number
2011-04-26T01:04:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	either the array is activated or it is not... if it is activated ( iirc you had to pass a switch to force a degraded activation ) then the dev node is created.  If it is not activated, then mknod will not help
2011-04-26T01:05:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	creating the dev node with mknod when the device does not actually exist in the kernel does no good
2011-04-26T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	try it, degraded arrays do not always create device files - it's a bug, it's known about
2011-04-26T01:05:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	if it wasn't created, then it wasn't activated, and so creating the node won't do any good... you will just get an error about no such device when you try to open it
2011-04-26T01:06:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	tell you what, you read the back scroll and what he's trying to do and walk him through it, I'm not going to progress this while debating it with you
2011-04-26T01:10:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	he isn't using mdadm at all; he is using fakeraid
2011-04-26T01:11:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	he's building an mdadm raid array, I gave him instructions on how to do it
2011-04-26T01:12:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	he said he chose to use serial ata raid
2011-04-26T01:13:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	yes, and I told him how to make software raid and gave him instructions
2011-04-26T01:13:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	need to get rid of the fakeraid first
2011-04-26T01:14:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	not if it didn't detect it and just used one disk, but I'll let you continue
2012-11-11T04:51:00.000Z	psusi	ikonia	because of the $
2012-11-11T05:07:00.000Z	ikonia	psusi	if you check a little deeper, you'll find it still appears to be valid in vista, so I'd assume it's a good possability it's still valid in win 7
