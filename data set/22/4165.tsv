2008-03-01T16:35:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	i have to do reinstall again,and it is netinstall
2008-03-01T16:36:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	why don't you download the CD or something?
2008-03-01T16:38:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	coz i install ubuntu to a vm
2008-03-01T16:39:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	you can't use the normal cd because its a VM?  why not?
2008-03-01T16:39:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	coz my mem is low,i am afraid it won't boot
2008-03-01T16:40:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	you could try the alternate install cd
2008-03-01T16:40:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	not sure if alternate will boot
2008-03-01T16:41:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	i have 256m ram on host
2008-03-01T16:42:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	will 7.10 alternate cd boot under 100m ram?
2008-03-01T16:43:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	I've booted in on 96
2008-03-01T16:43:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	okay,:)i will stop this netinstall,hhehe
2008-03-01T16:45:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	you run 7.10 in 96 ram,how is it working
2008-03-01T16:46:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	it isn't pretty, but I think that's because the processor is only 300mhz -- the ram shouldn't be a problem
2008-03-01T16:51:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	i want to do a netinstall,coz i only the parts which is useful to me,like openoffice,i don't like it,so after i installed ubuntu,shall i use "sudo apt-get remove openoffice " to uninstall it totally?
2008-03-01T16:52:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	you can do that, you can also do your netinstall it you want -- you might even be able to convince the netinstall to use an alt. install CD
2008-03-01T16:53:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	yeah,that is great,how to ?convince the netinstall to use an alt install cd
2008-03-01T16:55:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	not sure if it is possible, but I know that if you put an alt. install cd in after installing ubuntu, you can use the apt-cdrom command to get the packages off of it
2008-03-01T16:56:00.000Z	icesword	kalatian	ok,that is it,i installed a cli only system,then put alternate one in cdrom,then i can do it,what is command exactly
2008-03-01T16:57:00.000Z	kalatian	icesword	I think you can do apt-cdrom add, put the cd in, then when you try to install a package found on the CD, it will grab it from there instead of the internet
