2009-02-12T15:39:00.000Z	dmphotography		Is there any sort of security risks by changing ownsership from root?
2009-02-12T15:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	of what files?
2009-02-12T15:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	almost all files outside of your home directory are owned by root
2009-02-12T15:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	you have two ntfs partitions, correct?
2009-02-12T15:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	that's fine. the second one is inside an extended partition
2009-02-12T15:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	i don't think so. sdb5 is a shared partition, right?
2009-02-12T15:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	meaning a partition you have for sharing data between ubuntu and windows
2009-02-12T15:50:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	well, it was a partition that was on my windows system prior to switching it over to Linux.
2009-02-12T15:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	are you on the live cd?
2009-02-12T15:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	what mount command gave that error?
2009-02-12T15:51:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	A physical second drive.
2009-02-12T15:51:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	Error?
2009-02-12T15:51:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	I had no error.
2009-02-12T15:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	oh, sorry, i mixed you up with daleh
2009-02-12T15:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	heh. since he was talking about something similar.
2009-02-12T15:52:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	LOL.
2009-02-12T15:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	anyway, what you described sounds ok
2009-02-12T15:53:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	Ok, I need to make a backup anyways.  I'm slacking on that.
2009-02-12T15:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dmphotography	never a bad idea
2009-02-12T15:53:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	Yeah.  What's the best way to back up selected folders/files for a web server?
2009-02-12T15:54:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	I have some folders containing serveral GB of movie files I don't need to make regular backups of.
2009-02-12T15:54:00.000Z	dmphotography	prince_jammys	and something automated would be ideal.
