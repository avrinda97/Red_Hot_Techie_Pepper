2009-01-23T06:04:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H		I need to create a block device for my new partition, but I don't know major/minor numbers - how do I proceed?
2009-01-23T06:05:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	may i ask "why" you feel you need to create a device node ?
2009-01-23T06:05:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	Because when IC reated the partition, it won't let me format it, says can't stat device
2009-01-23T06:06:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	and what device are you trying to access ?
2009-01-23T06:06:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	mke2fs -j /dev/rd/c0d0p8
2009-01-23T06:07:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	reason i'm asking, udevd is supposed to take care of device node creation
2009-01-23T06:07:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	I tried restarting udevd but it didn't create it
2009-01-23T06:07:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	what is this hardware ?
2009-01-23T06:08:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	It's a Mylex 170 Acceleraid.  RAID 0+1, 1 logical Drive... and this is the last logical drive in the extended partition
2009-01-23T06:08:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	All the other devices are ok, but they were creatd during the install of the OS
2009-01-23T06:09:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	Incidentally, it' 8.04 server
2009-01-23T06:09:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	pastebin  ls -lh /dev/rd/ #and we will see if we can figure out the major/minor for you
2009-01-23T06:10:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	http://paste.ubuntu.com/108426/  but it doesn't show the device I need (/dev/rd/c0d0p8)
2009-01-23T06:15:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	the command would look something like;  sudo mknod /dev/rd/c0d0p8 b 48 8  # but i'm not sure that will help you any, because; you seem to be trying to use an unsupported number there.  i.e. 48 8 is c0d1 not c0d0p8   so error.  i dont have an answer. sorry.
2009-01-23T06:15:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	Thank you for looking.  As I don't have any other disk, would it hurt if I removed the c0d1 block device, and used it's major/minor for the one I want?
2009-01-23T06:16:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	"only 8 partitions/logical volumes supported"  you wont have to remove the other to test.  you can create a false device node without hosing others
2009-01-23T06:17:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	thank you for your help
2009-01-23T06:18:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	example of false device node: sudo mknod /dev/boohoohoo b 8 1  # < that will actually access sda1
2009-01-23T06:18:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	Ah - cool!  ;)
2009-01-23T06:18:00.000Z	root______	Twinkletoes|H	welcome,  and sorry i don't have any experance with raid arrays so can't be more help there.
2009-01-23T06:35:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	Problems with blockfile not being there... resolved
2009-01-23T06:36:00.000Z	Twinkletoes|H	root______	It seems the Ubuntu installer only creates an extended partition large enough to hold the logical drives you define during installation.  I thought the extended partiton covered the entire disk - it didn't, so I created the partition as primary, and it's all worked now - thank you ;)
