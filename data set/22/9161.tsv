2005-06-29T11:48:00.000Z	MrE		I've got an HP LaserJet 4000 and when printing a test page with the suggested postscript driver nothing comes out but goobldygook.  Any ideas?
2005-06-29T11:50:00.000Z	Jimbob	MrE	What's the exact driver name you're using?
2005-06-29T11:50:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	the driver just says "Postscript (recommended) (Suggested)"
2005-06-29T11:51:00.000Z	Jimbob		Ok
2005-06-29T11:51:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	The other choices are hpijs, lj5gray, and pxlmono.
2005-06-29T11:52:00.000Z	Jimbob	MrE	If you change to hpijs does it work?
2005-06-29T11:52:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	Haven't tried yet as I would prefer Postscript and the odd name of the hpijs driver spooked me a bit.
2005-06-29T11:54:00.000Z	Jimbob	MrE	Well, it's dumping invalid postscript to the printer (hence the garbage)
2005-06-29T11:54:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	That's what I figured as well.  I was hoping this was a known issue with a known workaround.
2005-06-29T11:55:00.000Z	Jimbob	MrE	Is the printer locally connected (parallel or usb), or is it on a network
2005-06-29T11:55:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	Local via Parallel.
2005-06-29T11:55:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	The hpijs driver prints garbage as well.
2005-06-29T11:56:00.000Z	Jimbob	MrE	Mmmm
2005-06-29T11:58:00.000Z	Jimbob	MrE	What's the parallel port using?
2005-06-29T11:58:00.000Z	Jimbob		(ECP, etc.)
2005-06-29T11:59:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	Using?  Ah.
2005-06-29T12:00:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	How do I find out from within Ubuntu?  I don't see a parallel port in the device manager.
2005-06-29T12:02:00.000Z	Jimbob	MrE	Aside from the bios I'm not sure (the dev manager in breezy shows ECP on my box)
2005-06-29T12:04:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	Hmm...
2005-06-29T12:12:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	I don't see the parallel port in the Hoary device manager.
2005-06-29T12:12:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	You have yours set to ECP, correct?  I can at least verify that mine's set the same.
2005-06-29T12:12:00.000Z	MrE	Jimbob	Not to throw a towel on the conversation but everything's printing fine from WinXP.
