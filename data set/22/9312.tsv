2004-12-22T08:18:00.000Z	sebas	farruinn	unstable is sid, sarge is testing yet
2004-12-22T08:18:00.000Z	sebas		Is there kde on the livecd btw?
2004-12-22T08:19:00.000Z	farruinn	sebas	there is no kde on the livecd or the install cd
2004-12-22T08:19:00.000Z	farruinn		if you want it you must apt-get it from the net
2004-12-22T08:19:00.000Z	sebas		Ok :)
2004-12-22T08:19:00.000Z	sebas		Thx guys for the quick answers!
2004-12-22T08:20:00.000Z	sebas		That's been the things I asked myself about Ubuntu.
2004-12-22T08:20:00.000Z	farruinn	sebas	one of Ubuntu's goals is to have a one-cd install, so that's partly why there's no kde
2004-12-22T08:21:00.000Z	sebas	farruinn	I'm tinkering if I'd suggest a friend of mine Ubuntu or Sarge on his notebook, he's a first time user and I want to have him installed a straight forward and complete system.
2004-12-22T08:21:00.000Z	farruinn	sebas	I would definitely go with warty
2004-12-22T08:21:00.000Z	farruinn		it *just works*
2004-12-22T08:22:00.000Z	sebas		So I wondered if Ubuntu's a good choice, he's known to KDE and likes it, so I'd rather have him install kde 3.3 than gnome
2004-12-22T08:22:00.000Z	sebas		What is warty?
2004-12-22T08:22:00.000Z	sebas		Sorry for not having read the faq completely
2004-12-22T08:23:00.000Z	sebas		Are the KDE packages well maintained and are there upgrades often enough?
2004-12-22T08:23:00.000Z	sebas		Ah, ok.
2004-12-22T08:24:00.000Z	sebas		And what name does the 'unstable' release have?
2004-12-22T08:24:00.000Z	sebas		Ah, makes sense then :)
2004-12-22T08:24:00.000Z	sebas		Hm, nice.
2004-12-22T08:24:00.000Z	sebas		I'm compiling 3.3.2 right now (well, for the last 30hours...)
2004-12-22T08:24:00.000Z	farruinn	sebas	if this person is a first time user I would definitely not put him through hoary
2004-12-22T08:25:00.000Z	farruinn	sebas	are you on ppc?
