2010-10-08T11:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Krishnandu	as that also includes other unix based OSes whose name ends in 'nix'
2010-10-08T11:15:00.000Z	Krishnandu	ActionParsnip	Like..?? Can you name some eg. OS..??
2010-10-08T11:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Krishnandu	they will all be linux based so are technically the same OSbui believe it also includes bsd
2010-10-08T11:16:00.000Z	Krishnandu	ActionParsnip	Hmm
2010-10-08T11:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Krishnandu	that's all I know. Its just an accepted method of encompassing unix, bsd and linux (not sure about beos though)
