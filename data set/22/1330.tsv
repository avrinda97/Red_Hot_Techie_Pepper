2012-08-16T22:20:00.000Z	delinquentme		so im getting this message: " Duplicate sources.list entry "  when running updates on my 10.04 installation ... and heres my sources.list http://pastie.org/4522800  any idea which is a duplicate?
2012-08-16T22:21:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	Have you also checked the lists in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory?
2012-08-16T22:22:00.000Z	delinquentme	TJ-	the pastie is updated with the whole error message ...
2012-08-16T22:25:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	nope... do "grep 'archive\.canonical\.com' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*"  ... that will show if there are other entries
2012-08-16T22:28:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	There you go! You have the archive listed in the main sources.list and in an add-on... check "Software Sources" from the Software Center and disable the additional sources
2012-08-16T22:29:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	pardon me, you're on 10.04 ... use Synaptics ... Software Sources menu option
2012-08-16T22:30:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	I'd suggest disabling the latter
2012-08-16T22:30:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	hang on...
2012-08-16T22:30:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	I suspect "source control" means the source-code link (deb-src ...) there's usually one of those for each "deb"
2012-08-16T22:31:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	just disable both of them in the Other sources, update, and test
2012-08-16T22:33:00.000Z	delinquentme	TJ-	looks like we're good!!!
2012-08-16T22:33:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	great :)
2012-09-07T02:19:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	I think what you want is to put the process into the background so control of the terminal returns to you. To do that in a shell, postfix  the "&" character to your commands
2012-09-07T02:24:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	Did you press Ctrl+Z ... that will suspend a process and but it in the background
2012-09-09T07:56:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	"grep -r class *.rb"
2012-09-09T08:06:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	You said "recursively from the current dir, right?" ... I showed you how to search from the current directory, since your example would have searched from root "/"
2012-09-09T08:07:00.000Z	delinquentme	TJ-	but that didn't do what I was expecting
2012-09-09T08:08:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	However, if the file-names you are searching for begin with a "." you need to do "grep -r class {.,}*.rb
2012-09-17T06:19:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	See the zip "-x" option ... e.g. "zip archive "*.h" "*.c" -x donotinclude.h orthis.h"
2012-09-17T06:19:00.000Z	delinquentme	TJ-	 >_<_>_<
2012-09-20T21:39:00.000Z	TJ-	delinquentme	Yes, the /usr/local/ directories are the place... it sounds like the kind of thing you'd put in /usr/local/etc/<appname>/
2012-09-20T21:39:00.000Z	delinquentme	TJ-	thanks
