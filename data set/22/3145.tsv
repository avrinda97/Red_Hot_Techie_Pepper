2008-11-27T05:58:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	I suggest you look up medibuntu on google
2008-11-27T05:58:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	works fine with VLC for me
2008-11-27T05:59:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	for me it plays fine for most, but the title1 (the movie itself) it hardly plays. when i play it in vlc there is no video output and after a few moments of playing like that from any spot, then there is video output which is jerky and looks scrambled
2008-11-27T06:00:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	that might be a problem with the hardware rather than the software
2008-11-27T06:00:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	some DVD's copy protection relies on the reader blindly following seek instructions to skip bad sectors
2008-11-27T06:01:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	unfortunately most computer drives try to read the file structure as first thing
2008-11-27T06:01:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	ok so there's no fix for this?
2008-11-27T06:01:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	if THAT is the issue, nothing short than a different reader bios
2008-11-27T06:02:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	but I'm able to watch movies in windows
2008-11-27T06:02:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	ok, that means my theory is wrong :)
2008-11-27T06:02:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	which incidentally is lucky for you
2008-11-27T06:03:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	have you tried using VLC?
2008-11-27T06:03:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	yeah i guess. still need to find a solution. btw you wouldnt happen to know anything about alsa/pulse audio would you?
2008-11-27T06:33:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	for my volume control function of ALSA i can see the front mic option and that seems to be able to be what caontrols my mic's input, however in skype when i'm trying to use my mic the options for sound in are HDA Intel (hw:intel,0), HDA Intel (hw:intel, 1), HDA Intel (hw:intel,2), HDA Intel (hw:intel,6) as well as HDA Intel (plughw:intel,0) for all of those, and pulse hdmi etc. neither of them seems to be working an
2008-11-27T06:34:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	sorry, skype cares me, I won't touch that... brr
2008-11-27T06:35:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	and to what? It shows up as front mic in the volume control, under ALSA
2008-11-27T06:36:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	I don't think skype goes through the alsa drivers
2008-11-27T06:36:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	I think it tries to access the hardware directly
2008-11-27T06:37:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	could you help me fix the pulse audio issue though? it's using wrong source for mic
2008-11-27T06:37:00.000Z	Brandano	roshank	I really ought to get some sleep
2008-11-27T06:38:00.000Z	roshank	Brandano	ok sorry. goodnigt
