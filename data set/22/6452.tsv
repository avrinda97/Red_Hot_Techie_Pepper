2006-11-22T15:30:00.000Z	Daviey		Hi, i want to automatically login a 'user', but in "Security Tab -> Security -> Allow root to login with GDM (Checked)" the user isn't visible.  Any ideas?
2006-11-22T15:30:00.000Z	stalefries	Daviey	bad idea to log in as root
2006-11-22T15:31:00.000Z	Daviey	stalefries	don't want to login as root
2006-11-22T15:31:00.000Z	stalefries	Daviey	then why select that option?

2006-11-24T06:54:00.000Z	Daviey	stalefries	well seems so.  I'm try to get it working on somebody else's computer by remote logging in.  They went to bed and turned out all the lights,  Therefore all i see is black, but different shades.  so i guess it's working!  ;)
