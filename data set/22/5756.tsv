2007-03-23T09:19:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	where did you get this Firefox?
2007-03-23T09:20:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	you should remove it if you can and get the one in Ubuntu
2007-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	did you remove the Ubuntu Firefox package before you installed the other one?
2007-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	try removing the deb
2007-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	dpkg -l | grep firefox
2007-03-23T09:24:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	it is still installed
2007-03-23T09:27:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	you could back them up
2007-03-23T09:28:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	is there some reason you want to use the non-Ubuntu Firefox?
2007-03-23T09:30:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	did you install it from a tarball?
2007-03-23T09:35:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	those in /home are just the configs
2007-03-23T09:42:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	if you removed only the mozilla or firefox in /opt, I do not think you need to reinstall
2007-03-23T09:43:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	no, it might be corrupted
2007-03-23T09:44:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	then you might try 'apt-get install --reinstall firefox'
2007-03-23T09:47:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	ps ax | grep firefox
2007-03-23T09:48:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	ignore the message then
2007-03-23T09:51:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	did you 'apt-get install --reinstall <packagename> ?
2007-03-23T09:52:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	you might try a reboot
2007-03-23T09:56:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	try the firefox command on the command line
2007-03-23T09:57:00.000Z	Pollywog	Lgndryhr	the only thing I can suggest is 'apt-get remove firefox' then reinstalling it
