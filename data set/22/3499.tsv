2008-08-23T10:30:00.000Z	Theaxiom		I think php6th was trying to make a funny.
2008-08-23T10:31:00.000Z	Theaxiom		Anyone know a good program for converting any type of cd image into a standard ISO so I can mount it?
2008-08-23T10:33:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	Did you try some searches on google yet?
2008-08-23T10:33:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	I am trying
2008-08-23T10:33:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	I figured someone here had run into the problem before
2008-08-23T10:35:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	Will try doing a little research myself - That would be nice to have an app that would make ISO's.
2008-08-23T10:35:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	Cool thanks, if I come across something, I will let you know. I would run ISOBuster in wine, but it is not free.
2008-08-23T10:44:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	Did you find anything yet? Here is one way to do it using Terminal - it's not an appt. but mike work in a bind. - LINK: http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/make_iso_images_on_linux/
2008-08-23T10:44:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	bin to iso with no cue file: http://linuxexpert.wordpress.com/2007/08/25/how-to-convert-bin-to-iso-image-whithout-having-cue-file/
2008-08-23T10:46:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	that looks promising - still would be nice to have a GUI app to get it done too.
2008-08-23T10:46:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	sudo apt-get install gisomount - to mount ISO's
2008-08-23T10:48:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion
2008-08-23T10:51:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	Did install of gisomount - could not find in apps menu - need to use "alt + F2" to run?
2008-08-23T10:52:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	^
2008-08-23T10:52:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	ok - got it. Thx
2008-08-23T11:02:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	I came across this ame problem of looking for an app that would be easy to use and be able to manage ISO's easily about 6 or 7 months ago - but your original question of a good conversion program has got me goin again.... If find something and c-you later in the forum will let ya know.....
2008-08-23T11:02:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	thanks
2008-08-23T11:05:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	I have backed up my original new CD's to ISO's for years using MagicISO or WinISO using windows. But using Linux most all the time now - would like to totally break-away from windows all together if you know what I mean.
2008-08-23T11:05:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	You can rip any cd to iso in linux using dd
2008-08-23T11:31:00.000Z	annie_g	Theaxiom	Thanks for your insight - appreciate it !
2008-08-23T11:31:00.000Z	Theaxiom	annie_g	No problemo!
