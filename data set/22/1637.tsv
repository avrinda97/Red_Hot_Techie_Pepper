2010-03-06T19:45:00.000Z	candy		how to make "read only" odp document to "read and write"?
2010-03-06T19:45:00.000Z	candy		i did from permissions but it didnt work
2010-03-06T19:46:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	chmod 444 <insert full file path><filename>
2010-03-06T19:47:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	chmod 444 ~/file.odt
2010-03-06T19:47:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	if your file's on desktop: chmod 444 ~/Desktop/filename.odt
2010-03-06T19:48:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	if you right click on file, i think you can check permissions that way as well
2010-03-06T19:49:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	that way didnt work at all
2010-03-06T19:50:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	sorry replace 444 with 666 .. that's what i meant
2010-03-06T19:51:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	it didnt work with 666 too
2010-03-06T19:52:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	try sudo chmod 666 ~/file.odt
2010-03-06T19:53:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	ok wait
2010-03-06T19:54:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	didnt work
2010-03-06T19:54:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	did you start authoring your .odt from start .. or someone sent it over for your comments ?
2010-03-06T19:54:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	i only created it
2010-03-06T19:55:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	so you aren't able to make changes to the .odt now ?
2010-03-06T19:55:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	i made a copy and now i can do it
2010-03-06T19:55:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	but it was not possible till i made a copy :-(
2010-03-06T19:56:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	while you were running chmod command was the .odt open in openoffice?
2010-03-06T19:56:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	i made an ppt copy of it and saved. i got two odp and den ppt. then after i opened odp but was not able to edit
2010-03-06T19:56:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	no it wasnt
2010-03-06T19:58:00.000Z	gsvolt	candy	use gedit/vi for collecting your thoughts, when done copy paste in openoffice, format .. that works for me
2010-03-06T19:58:00.000Z	candy	gsvolt	yep that too worked
