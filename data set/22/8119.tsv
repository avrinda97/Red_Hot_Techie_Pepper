2006-10-23T13:29:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		no 64-bit
2006-10-23T13:29:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		and nspluginwrapper is buggy
2006-10-23T13:31:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		adobe has plans, but it'll be released later
2006-10-23T13:32:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		I dont see anything about "NEVER, WE WILL NEVER SUPPORT 64 BIT"
2006-10-23T13:32:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		well, look bacl
2006-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		back*
2006-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		flash 9 beta was to be released "when it's ready"
2006-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		;)
2006-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		and lo and behold
2006-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		means they have plans
2006-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Shadowpillar	flash9 will be released in 2007
2006-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak		[H] 3b0R: for what?
2006-10-23T13:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak		[H] 3b0R: are you on edgy?
2006-10-23T13:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak		[H] 3b0R: it will be rc 2 as final release for edgy
2006-10-23T13:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak		[H] 3b0R: join #ubuntu+1 okease for edgy
2006-10-23T13:35:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	gnomefreak	however, consider this, the fact Vista will be 64 bit, where their core market uses, means that the core interpreter (which is what holds them back atm) will have to upgraded
2006-10-23T13:36:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		and 64 bit linux is ready, so there will be a 64 bit version, in fact this may spark its development for all future 64 bit systems
2006-10-23T13:36:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		so I dont think adobe is not gonna ever have 64 bit support like you're saying
2006-10-23T13:37:00.000Z	Shadowpillar		in fact, adobe seems to be more linux friendly than macromedia ever was
2006-10-23T13:38:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	gnomefreak	of course, arent you the one who was arguing with me a few weeks back that flash 9 beta would be released next september?
2006-10-23T13:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Shadowpillar	no i told you it would be released in 2007 it was supposed to be release in sept 2006 but fell behind
2006-10-23T13:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Shadowpillar	this os very offtopic for this channel please move it to one of the -offtopic channels
