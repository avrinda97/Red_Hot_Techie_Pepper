2004-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	atariboy		i'm downloading Suse at the moment to try it but if i find out how to use it on Ubuntu i'll 'switch' :)
2004-10-31T16:42:00.000Z	atariboy		!?
2004-10-31T16:43:00.000Z	atariboy		am i missing something?
2004-10-31T16:43:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	so you want to try a primarily KDE distro.... because you want to stick with GNOME?  idgi
2004-10-31T16:44:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	yes...
2004-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	SuSE = KDE, Novell Linux Desktop includes both, but defaults to GNOME... you want NLD, not SUSE...
2004-10-31T16:48:00.000Z	atariboy	|trey|	ah. i'm so confused then. i didn't think NLD was out
2004-10-31T16:48:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	its not yet  :/
2004-10-31T16:50:00.000Z	atariboy	|trey|	i see. ta
2004-10-31T16:50:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	no... it was installed via NLD though... not even entirely sure what it does  :/
2004-10-31T16:50:00.000Z	atariboy	|trey|	desktop search/indexing
2004-10-31T16:51:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	hmm... why isn't this part of gnome 2.8?  8)
2004-10-31T17:01:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	there is no 'netinst' image at this time, no...
2004-10-31T17:02:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	you can however do a debian netinst, add an ubuntu source, and install 'ubuntu-desktop' if you are so inclined  :)
2004-10-31T17:02:00.000Z	atariboy	|trey|	heh. result would be the same then?
2004-10-31T17:03:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	pretty much, yeah... wouldn't be complete set of packages... but its a fair chunk  :)
2004-11-12T10:16:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	many people, Jeff Waugh is the head guy though...
2004-11-12T10:16:00.000Z	atariboy	|trey|	oki. thanks
2004-11-12T10:17:00.000Z	|trey|	atariboy	you could have known that from the site though: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/teams/
