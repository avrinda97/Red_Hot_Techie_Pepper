2005-06-13T16:42:00.000Z	Ubuntian		OMG grabit works very well under wine...
2005-06-13T16:42:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	how did you get started with Wine?  I've had no luck with it at all.
2005-06-13T16:43:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	to install grabit or wine in general?
2005-06-13T16:43:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	wine in general.  I had all kinds of error messages during the very confusing setup process, and then nothing I tried worked
2005-06-13T16:44:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	one sec
2005-06-13T16:44:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	have as many as you like
2005-06-13T16:46:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	ok wine is on synaptic, i think it's even installed by default, now for grabit go there http://www.shemes.com/index.php?p=download and download it
2005-06-13T16:47:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	then open it with wine and everything just works...
2005-06-13T16:47:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	I don't have wine.
2005-06-13T16:47:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	it's in synaptic
2005-06-13T16:48:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	I know.  Just 'wine', or 'wineutils' as well?
2005-06-13T16:49:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	i think wine should be enough
2005-06-13T16:55:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	what do I do once I've used synaptic to get wine installed?
2005-06-13T16:55:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	then download grabit on the site i gave u
2005-06-13T16:56:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	first I thought I would try running something simpler, like 'notepad.exe'...
2005-06-13T16:57:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	nah, let's do it
2005-06-13T16:58:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	well, who knows it's from M$ after all
2005-06-13T16:59:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	i tried many games under cedega and it works
2005-06-13T16:59:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	did you do the 'configure wine' steps?
2005-06-13T05:14:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	u mean the cdrom detection?
2005-06-13T05:16:00.000Z	Ubuntian	dooglus	u give up for grabit?
2005-06-14T11:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Ubuntian	1280x1024 and 1024x768
