2011-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bibliotheque	 i think you only want run of those.
2011-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bibliotheque	 and you DO a 'sudo apt-get update'  after adding new repos..
2011-05-19T23:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bibliotheque	 let me boot my other box and see what repo im using there.
2011-05-19T23:04:00.000Z	bibliotheque	Dr_Willis	well. i did that. though errors appeared
2011-05-19T23:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bibliotheque	 last i looked there was a testing (svn?) repo that had the version for 11.04 the older ppa/version dident work
2011-05-19T23:05:00.000Z	bibliotheque	Dr_Willis	so i should go for the svn one?
