2012-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	ben_zen		hey, so I've got a question about how the LiveCD creates what it sees as a « hard drive »
2012-02-01T09:14:00.000Z	ben_zen		(I'm trying to figure out if I've got a bad memory slot or bad firmware, and this may be the solution.)
2012-02-01T09:15:00.000Z	ben_zen		but I installed two 4GB SODIMMs and it's telling me it only sees one
2012-02-01T09:15:00.000Z	ben_zen		even after flipping them
2012-02-01T09:16:00.000Z	ben_zen		however, when I loaded up the live cd, it said I had 3.6GiB of RAM, and 3.9GB of disk space
2012-02-01T09:16:00.000Z	ben_zen		that looks mysteriously similar to a full 8GB of RAM installed to me.
2012-02-01T09:18:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	well tmpfs has a max size limit
2012-02-01T09:13:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	you mean the temp file system?
2012-02-01T09:14:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	sort of, I guess.
2012-02-01T09:15:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	oh? booting issues?
2012-02-01T09:15:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	no booting issues
2012-02-01T09:16:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	were you using a 32x cd?
2012-02-01T09:16:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	no, AMD64
2012-02-01T09:19:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	that answered my question, I think. The answer isn't pretty, but that's what I was wondering about.
2012-02-01T09:20:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	yeah, definitely. I just want to be sure that's what's up
2012-02-01T09:20:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/marcelo/linux-2.4/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt
2012-02-01T09:22:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	osx couldn't read >4gb o_O
2012-02-01T09:22:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	I think it's an EFI problem
2012-02-01T09:22:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	oh
2012-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	ben_zen	weird
2012-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	in a word, yes. This was happening before, too, I discovered … when I cracked the case, expecting to see one DIMM, and saw two.
2012-02-01T09:27:00.000Z	ben_zen	DinoMuffin	thanks for the help!
