2012-09-17T16:28:00.000Z	gazzwi86		hey guys, I'm missing some packages I want to install via apt-get
2012-09-17T16:28:00.000Z	gazzwi86		libpngwriter0-dev libpngwriter0c2 libjpeg-prog libavcodec52 libavformat52
2012-09-17T16:28:00.000Z	gazzwi86		any idea how I could get hold of them? Ubuntu 12
2012-09-17T16:30:00.000Z	gazzwi86		BlueKaj: no
2012-09-17T16:31:00.000Z	WACOMalt	gazzwi86	is this for openCV?
2012-09-17T16:31:00.000Z	gazzwi86	WACOMalt	Yeh
2012-09-17T16:32:00.000Z	WACOMalt		if so, apparantly following this guide, but replacing step 2 with steps 1-3 ftom this guide http://www.ozbotz.org/opencv-installation/ will make it work :D
2012-09-17T16:32:00.000Z	WACOMalt		according to a random comment about missing those packages in ubuntu
2012-09-17T16:32:00.000Z	WACOMalt		looks like you may not even need thsoe packages because the replacement steps dont show it at all
2012-09-17T16:33:00.000Z	WACOMalt		NZB is a usenet reference file
2012-09-17T16:33:00.000Z	WACOMalt		so yes, much like a .torrent file. referencing where to download files from for whatever package.
2012-09-17T16:33:00.000Z	WACOMalt		sorry didnt see until After I posted it
2012-09-17T16:34:00.000Z	WACOMalt		read up
2012-09-17T16:34:00.000Z	WACOMalt		I immagine sabnzbd is available for linux
2012-09-17T16:34:00.000Z	WACOMalt		it should handle them fine
2012-09-17T16:35:00.000Z	WACOMalt		python technically
2012-09-17T16:35:00.000Z	WACOMalt		its a download manager for nzb files
2012-09-17T16:35:00.000Z	WACOMalt		runs as a web server though, takes a bit of setup
2012-09-17T16:35:00.000Z	WACOMalt		http://sabnzbd.org/download/ has apt commands for it
2012-09-17T16:36:00.000Z	gazzwi86	WACOMalt	I'm following the opencv installation guide atm, but will use that as and when I bump into issues! thanks!
2012-09-17T16:36:00.000Z	WACOMalt		oohh so this is about the proper associations
2012-09-17T16:36:00.000Z	WACOMalt	gazzwi86	np, I know nothing about openCV so hopefully it works XD
