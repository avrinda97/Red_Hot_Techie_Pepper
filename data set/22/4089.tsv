2008-03-20T07:08:00.000Z	vonk		hello :)
2008-03-20T07:08:00.000Z	vonk		would anyone have the patience to deal with a noob having ubuntu installation problems?
2008-03-20T07:09:00.000Z	vonk		hehe, fair enough :-). My computer has 4 harddrives, all of them are SATA. Windows sits on the first of these disks, and I have tried to install ubuntu on the second disk
2008-03-20T07:10:00.000Z	vonk		unfortunately, when i get to grub and try to boot to linux, i get an error 17
2008-03-20T07:10:00.000Z	vonk		unable to mount selected partition
2008-03-20T07:10:00.000Z	vonk		when i try to load windows, i get  an error 13, invalid or unsupported executable format
