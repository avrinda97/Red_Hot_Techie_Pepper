2005-11-15T10:14:00.000Z	trappist		is general mplayer suckage on ubuntu a commonly acknowledged and possibly documented and/or fixed issue?
2005-11-15T10:15:00.000Z	trappist		I wonder why that would be
2005-11-15T10:15:00.000Z	trappist		the mplayer issue looks to be alsa-related
2005-11-15T10:16:00.000Z	trappist		or your favorite text editor
2005-11-15T10:16:00.000Z	trappist		sudo wine winword.exe /etc/apt/sources.list etc.
2005-11-15T10:16:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	sounds like a Good Idea :] 
2006-06-07T05:28:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	it monitors files for changes on behalf of other programs
2006-06-07T05:29:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	oh, that's right.  like fam.  it's a gnome thing, right?  I run kubuntu - what starts it, wtf is it monitoring for changes, and how do I stop it?
2006-06-07T05:29:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	like fam, yes, a bit simpler tho. Not strictly a gnome thing, as it implements the FAM API to the clients.
2006-06-07T05:30:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	dunno what starts it for you tho, I don't think KDE uses FAM
2006-06-07T05:30:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	I really can't imagine why gnome would either, without a user explicitly setting it up.  I'm gonna file a mean bug on something when I track this down.  Thanks much.
2006-06-07T05:31:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	well, for things like having a current view of the menus and file manager windows...
2006-06-07T05:33:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	apt should be able to update menus with hooks - I suppose I see the value for file managers, but I'm not running one atm and if I was it wouldn't be nautilus, and oh btw why is it eating up all my resources and driving up my load?
2006-06-07T05:33:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	told you, a bug ;)
2006-06-07T05:33:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	or then something's changing like hell in some of your monitored directories ;)
2006-06-07T05:33:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	I tried to uninstall gamin, but it wants to take pretty much the whole kde with it
2006-06-07T05:34:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	whaddoya know, maybe kde hasn't reinvented it after all ;)
2006-06-07T05:35:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	I attached strace to it and it's lstat'ing .desktop files in /usr/share/services and /usr/share/applnk!  totally frikkin unnecessary?
2006-06-07T05:37:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	as before, I managed to get rid of it like so: while true; do killall gam_server;done - and I hit ctrl-c after it gives up respawning.  but that gets me no closer to figuring out why it started.
2006-08-08T14:40:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	but hans reiser says reiserfs 3 is the most stable filesystem for linux!
2006-08-08T14:40:00.000Z	mjr	trappist	I assume you're kidding?
2006-08-08T14:40:00.000Z	trappist	mjr	I'm being tongue in cheek of course, but in my experience it is pretty stable
