2007-03-09T10:21:00.000Z	wes_1977		is there anyone that can help pinpoint a wireless networking problem? Everything I'm looking for in terms of making sure the drivers are installed, the device is recognized, etc. seems ok, yet I'm still unable to get my wireless card connected to the network
2007-03-09T10:22:00.000Z	wes_1977		it does not connect to my home network, but wifi-radar and iwlist does see the network
2007-03-09T10:24:00.000Z	wes_1977		right now my wireless network is completely open, essid is broadcasting, no encryption, no mac restrictions
2007-03-09T10:24:00.000Z	wes_1977		yes
2007-03-09T10:25:00.000Z	wes_1977		I can see them, but not connect to them
2007-03-09T10:26:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	what happens when you as root issues  iwlist wlan0  scan
2007-03-09T10:28:00.000Z	wes_1977		when I do iwlist ath0 scanning I can see the wireless network
2007-03-09T10:29:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	can you please prefix you responses with a nick so we know to whom you're responding to
2007-03-09T10:30:00.000Z	wes_1977	bulmer	sorry, will do on future responses
2007-03-09T10:31:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	iwconfig ath0   what does that tell you?

2007-03-09T10:33:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	now issue             dhclient
2007-03-09T10:36:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	what did you get from that command dhclient ?
2007-03-09T10:38:00.000Z	wes_1977	bulmer	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9378/
2007-03-09T10:41:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	i'd disable those other interfaces temporarily until you get the wireless portion working
2007-03-09T10:41:00.000Z	wes_1977	bulmer	vmnet1 and vmnet8? What is the easiest way to disable them?
2007-03-09T10:42:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	having that many interfaces will most likely get your system confused as to which is the correct gateway to use
2007-03-09T10:43:00.000Z	wes_1977	bulmer	so I can disable wifi0, vmnet1, and vmnet8 and just leave ath0 (wireless), eth0 (wired), and lo is that correct?
2007-03-09T10:44:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	just leave lo and ath0 only
2007-03-09T10:45:00.000Z	wes_1977	bulmer	ok, that will require me to be disconnected from the internet temporarily to do that b/c I'm connected via eth0 now. Where should I disable those interfaces from? Is it just in the /etc/networking/interfaces file?
2007-03-09T10:45:00.000Z	bulmer	wes_1977	no, you have to google for this and find out where they will get disabled, i dont know off hand
2007-03-09T10:46:00.000Z	wes_1977	bulmer	ok, I'll do that. hopefully I'll be back soon, but either way, thanks for your help.
