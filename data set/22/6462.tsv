2007-01-30T11:11:00.000Z	ForgeAus		it was probably a dud package that I installed...
2007-01-30T11:11:00.000Z	ForgeAus		lol no I meant the packages it finds to auto remove
2007-01-30T11:11:00.000Z	ForgeAus		be careful about them
2007-01-30T11:11:00.000Z	ForgeAus		DONT get rid of anything important
2007-01-30T11:12:00.000Z	ForgeAus		ahh to search the package for a binary it builds?
2007-01-30T11:12:00.000Z	ForgeAus		(zooted)
2007-01-30T11:12:00.000Z	ForgeAus		hey Dis
2007-01-30T11:13:00.000Z	ForgeAus		good question Dis, I have no idea
2007-01-30T11:13:00.000Z	ForgeAus		but then I'm still pretty much a newbie when it comes to Linux
2007-01-30T11:14:00.000Z	ForgeAus		(but I'm learning)
2007-01-30T11:14:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	if i'm here, it's usually to either help others, or it's an off the wall problem/question hehe :)
2007-01-30T11:16:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	what happens when you try to boot?  what version of Kubuntu?  do you get an error at all?
2007-01-30T11:17:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	Edgy is 6.10, yes.  ok, so this is a hd install, correct?  was it working before?  does the livecd boot?
2007-01-30T11:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	ok, what changes were made that made it stop working?  what have you done so far to try to fix it?  i'm trying to get more info on exactly what is going wrong :)
2007-01-30T11:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	can you get the box to boot to a recovery console?
2007-01-30T11:22:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	from the recovery console, as root, type this:  aptitude install ubuntu-minimal
2007-01-30T11:39:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	nope, i left, was killed, and replaced by an evil alien clone O.o
2007-01-30T11:41:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	it sounds like something really hosed you.  My PERSONAL feeling would be to reinstall, but I'd not do that if I were you, and instead wait for another guru to happen by.  really depends on how much data you've got that you need to save on the install, and how much time you've put into it.
2007-01-30T11:42:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	you can only SAFELY read NTFS partitions from linux, true.  Windows has an EXT2 filesystem driver available, and there are some inroads to making NTFS read/write from linux.  see !fuse
2007-01-30T11:48:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	as an aside, to chain commands from a prompt, you can put && between them.  so, sudo mkdir /media/hdb1 && sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 -o user
2007-01-30T11:49:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	allows user level access to the partition, so you don't have to use root to get to it (assuming it's a file system such as ntfs/ext3/etc)
2007-01-30T12:05:00.000Z	SilentDis	ForgeAus	for edgy, the location of the 'local repository' is /var/cache/apt/archives :)
