2008-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	magnus_		do i need samba for filessharing b/w ubuntu machines?
2008-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	will the ubuntu machine act as server or client?
2008-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	one server another client
2008-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	both *buntu
2008-05-26T13:29:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	what should it do?
2008-05-26T13:31:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	just want to look up the ip numbers on the network.
2008-05-26T13:31:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	the ip numbers of the computers on the SMB network?
2008-05-26T13:32:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	no not smb..
2008-05-26T13:32:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	my local network ie computers connected to the router
2008-05-26T13:33:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	net view lists computers in your SMB network. isn't this what you wanna do?
2008-05-26T13:35:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	i use ssh to connect to other computers not samba... i just want to see which ip-adressess are in use instead of having to ping each one or something...
2008-05-26T13:37:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	sure, but how should you get the ip adresses of the if they have no hostname, no SMB name or any name at all? how would your computer be able to find the IP adress out of nothing? if you want to replace net view, you can use nmblookup and smbtree
2008-05-26T13:40:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	"how should i" well i dont know thats why im here lol.
2008-05-26T13:41:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	you are both asking me for how to do it and what to do.
2008-05-26T13:41:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	ok
2008-05-26T13:42:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	my router adds computer names to my local DNS server, very useful. another solution would be to add computer names and IPs to your /etc/hosts
2008-05-26T13:46:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	but i have no network skillz
2008-05-26T13:46:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	ok
2008-05-26T23:46:00.000Z	magnetron	magnus_	it already has one. run "sudo blkid" to find it out
2008-05-26T23:47:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	it gives /dev/sdb2: LABEL="Media" SEC_TYPE="ext2" TYPE="ext3"
2008-05-26T23:47:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	i get an UUID for all disks but not my /dev/sdb2
2008-05-26T23:49:00.000Z	magnus_	magnetron	and I just created /dev/sdb2 partition from winxp so it is fresh
