2006-04-18T15:01:00.000Z	shinu		why does: cat file | sed '/something/' not work?
2006-04-18T15:02:00.000Z	shinu		!repos
2006-04-18T15:02:00.000Z	shinu		you mean that?
2006-04-18T15:03:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	Why would you want to cat a file and then pipe it to sed? Can;t you directly use sed instead?
2006-04-18T15:04:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	well i could do sed '/something/' file right?
2006-04-18T15:04:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	I am guessing you /something/ is a regular expression?
2006-04-18T15:05:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	then you would need to do "sed -e '/something/' fileName
2006-04-18T15:05:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	not necessarily? cant it be a word?
2006-04-18T15:05:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	yep, not just a reg. exp
2006-04-18T15:06:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	harisund sed -e '/something/' file still gives me: sed: -e expression #1, char 7: missing command
2006-04-18T15:07:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	Ok can you give me a particular example of hat you are trying? Probably post your file and some sample of what you are searching for, so that I too can give it a try?
2006-04-18T15:08:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	What are you using sed in this case for anyway? Are you just searching for a string?
2006-04-18T15:08:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	yes
2006-04-18T15:09:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	If searching for a string is what you want, have a look at grep and fgrep.
2006-04-18T15:09:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	They are simpler to use too
2006-04-18T15:10:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	yes i know about grep but i wanted to extract specific strings
2006-04-18T15:10:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	like from an index.html file extract all the jpgs or osmething
2006-04-18T15:10:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	Oh I see..
2006-04-18T15:11:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	might using awk a better solution or not?
2006-04-18T15:11:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	That's an interesting problem, choosing *.jpg from an index.html.. I am really not sure what the best tool would be in this case, though I am sure there is just a perfect one..
2006-04-18T15:12:00.000Z	shinu	harisund	well.. i could write up a perl script but i dont want it :P
2006-04-18T15:14:00.000Z	harisund	shinu	Hmm.. let's see..
