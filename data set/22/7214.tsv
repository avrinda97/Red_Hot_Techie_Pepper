2006-06-16T13:10:00.000Z	Drake_		I am not sure why this is showing up in my /var/log/auth.log .....Jun 14 12:17:01 drake CRON[10809] : (pam_unix) session opened for user root by (uid=0) Jun 14 12:17:01 drake CRON[10809] : (pam_unix) session closed for user root
2006-06-16T13:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	a cron job is running as root.
2006-06-16T13:12:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	is that something that is run by default with an ssh server? or something that was manually done?
2006-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	well, its a cron job, so check what you have running in the cron for midnight.
2006-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	it apparently has been running every hour on the 17th minute and first second for days
2006-06-16T13:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	well, all system-wide ones. Individual user's cron jobs are in their own crontab
2006-06-16T13:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	there is actually nothing strange about that :)
2006-06-16T13:23:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	is that what is causing the ssh server to be listening for a root login?
2006-06-16T13:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	where did you get that idea?
2006-06-16T13:26:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	this is what I am trying to find the source that is causing this Jun 16 15:17:01 drake CRON[21933] : (pam_unix) session opened for user root by (uid=0) Jun 16 15:17:01 drake CRON[21933] : (pam_unix) session closed for user root
2006-06-16T13:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	its the CRON job I think.
2006-06-16T13:28:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	I was trying to find which cron was causing it to happen and more importantly why is it necessary if it is necessary
2006-06-16T13:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	I think its the anacron job that is checking for other entries to run at the hourly cron.
2006-06-16T13:30:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	there is nothing in /etc/cron.hourly except a file called .placeholder that simply says # This file is a simple placeholder to keep dpkg from removing this directory
2006-06-16T13:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	check /etc/crontab
2006-06-16T13:33:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	I see there entries in /etc/crontab # m h dom mon dow user  command 17 *    * * *   root    run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly 25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily 47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly 52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly
2006-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	your log entry mystery is from the first crontab entry, that executes every 17 minutes.
2006-06-16T13:38:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	the command being run by cron is "run-parts" just like the other jobs are running a command called "test"?
2006-06-16T13:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Drake_	yes, but its running as root, so that's why there is a root session login.
2006-06-16T13:40:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	is that something that is default on an ubuntu install or something that has been added manually?
2006-06-16T13:48:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	that can't be a good idea to be running a cron job listening for a root ssh connection, can it?
2006-06-16T13:58:00.000Z	Drake_	fyrestrtr	said that it was being run by something in the crontab but I haven't been able to pin down what is actually calling that particular command to be done
