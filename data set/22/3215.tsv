2008-11-07T20:47:00.000Z	kanhiya78		no i mean to say system use RAM IF CPU USAGE IS HIGH
2008-11-07T20:49:00.000Z	kanhiya78		there shoul be less load on cpu
2008-11-07T20:49:00.000Z	kanhiya78		my system has dual core processor and one of them is running at 100% from last few minutes
2008-11-07T20:51:00.000Z	kanhiya78		whiptail is doing that, i do not know what it is
2008-11-07T20:52:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	check with system monitor and see what process eats all you r cpu
2008-11-07T20:52:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	gnome-system-monitor
2008-11-07T20:53:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	press ALT+F2 and type gnome-system-monitor
2008-11-07T20:57:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	but what process?
2008-11-07T20:58:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	go to processes tab and see process name that keeps your cpu in 100%
2008-11-07T21:00:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	click on CPU to sort by load
2008-11-07T21:01:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	ha?
2008-11-07T21:02:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	System Monitor -> Processes click on CPU to sort
2008-11-07T21:02:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	the color is in Resources tab
2008-11-07T21:03:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	Go to Processes tab
2008-11-07T21:03:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	so theese are the only 2 rocesses that use cpu?
2008-11-07T21:04:00.000Z	_seraphim_	kanhiya78	then why do you say cpu stays in 100%?
