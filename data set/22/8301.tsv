2008-07-18T08:26:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		damn i don't know how azureus could get even worse, their new "vuze" stuff is even more horrible to use
2008-07-18T08:27:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		well ktorrent working fine with kde-libs so i'm off with it for now, just looking for more lightweighted one
2008-07-18T08:28:00.000Z	Flannel	veo[test-morph]	btlaunchmanycurses (bittornado)
2008-07-18T08:28:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		i was thinking more about a rtorrent with upnp+dht
2008-07-18T08:29:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		transmission didn't allow me to select which files i wanted inside the torrent
2008-07-18T08:30:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		than ktorrent?
2008-07-18T08:31:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		maybe i'll give it a try
2008-07-18T08:32:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		as for audio playing, any good alternative to amarok ?
2008-07-18T08:32:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		normal audio
2008-07-18T08:33:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		yeah it's a bit heavy for what i want (but nice though)
2008-07-18T08:34:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		the day linux get a good daytrading analysis software it's gonna be perfect for me, no more vbox ;_;
2008-07-18T08:35:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		too bad qtstalker is so limited :
2008-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		also any good alternative for irc client? i really have trouble with xchat, back to mirc with wine ~
2008-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		i use irssi when i run a client with ssh
2008-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]	IndyGunFreak	because i'm used to it, have my scripts, my habits, and it's hard to change after what.. 10years? lol
2008-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	veo[test-morph]	Try xchat proper (not xchat-gnome) there's a surprising difference
2008-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		there's a gui version of irssi or still ol good terminal one
2008-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	veo[test-morph]	terminal is a GUI version ;)
2008-07-18T08:39:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		well i understand myself :D
2008-07-18T08:40:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		yeah that's why i'm asking, but to go back to client line, or use xchat that left me weird aftertaste :D
2008-07-18T08:40:00.000Z	veo[test-morph]		i was hoping to find something that i can easily put down to tray and that tell me when i have notice and such
2008-07-18T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	veo[test-morph]	as much as I shudder to say it.. have you tried pidgin?
