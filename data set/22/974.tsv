2012-09-12T07:45:00.000Z	daanish		Oh, so wherever it's being installed should be mounted to "/"
2012-09-12T07:46:00.000Z	daanish		right?
2012-09-12T07:46:00.000Z	Noobuntu	daanish	its generally a good idea to have mount /, /usr, /home and /swap on separate partitions
2012-09-12T07:47:00.000Z	Noobuntu		but since you are just starting out, just mount / on /dev/sda4
2012-09-12T07:47:00.000Z	Noobuntu		do you have a separate partition identified for swap?
2012-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	daanish	Noobuntu	I was planning on working on the swap after figuring out what the main partition mounts to
2012-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	daanish		I'm not making seperate partitions for each /home, etc, because I'm trying to dual boot (and yes, because I'm just starting out with this.)
2012-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	Noobuntu		ok -- how much is ur RAM?
2012-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	daanish		4GB
2012-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	daanish		Rule of thumb, swap = ram x 2
2012-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	Noobuntu		alright - so your swap shouuld be atelast 4 GB in size
2012-09-12T07:48:00.000Z	daanish		not twice that of ram, the same?
2012-09-12T07:49:00.000Z	Noobuntu		no - ram x 2 would be overkill - it will hardly be used
2012-09-12T07:49:00.000Z	daanish		Ok.
2012-09-12T07:49:00.000Z	Noobuntu		just use the same size as that of RAM if you are  planning to use hibernate
2012-09-12T07:49:00.000Z	daanish		Thanks, Noobuntu
2012-09-12T07:49:00.000Z	Noobuntu		you are welcome
2012-09-12T07:50:00.000Z	daanish		Quick question, you think 68GB is enough for an ubuntu install?
2012-09-12T07:51:00.000Z	Noobuntu		that would depend on how you plan to use it
2012-09-12T07:51:00.000Z	daanish		Bah humbug.. I can never remember if I ran out of space on my last escapade with linux.
2012-09-12T07:51:00.000Z	Noobuntu		if you are asking only about the operating system space requirements then 68GB is of course more than enough
2012-09-12T07:52:00.000Z	daanish	Noobuntu	I'm just worried because of all the constant updates?
