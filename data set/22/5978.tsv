2007-02-19T07:35:00.000Z	cypherdelic		hey officials, will there be a restricted modules package for the 2.6.17-50 kernel soon?
2007-02-19T07:36:00.000Z	cypherdelic		hey what about kernel 2.6.17-50 and restricted modules, anybody knows??
2007-02-19T07:37:00.000Z	cypherdelic		how to get the nvidia driver to work with that kernel?
2007-02-19T07:38:00.000Z	cypherdelic		nobody knows :(
2007-02-19T07:38:00.000Z	cypherdelic		i would like to switch to that new kernel
2007-02-19T07:39:00.000Z	cypherdelic		timo what version of kernel?
2007-02-19T07:39:00.000Z	cypherdelic		toma
2007-02-19T07:40:00.000Z	cypherdelic		did anyone tried 2.6.17-50 kernel?
2007-02-19T07:42:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	yes.
2007-02-19T07:45:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	its been set up for the better part of 2 years. Ive been using it for about 6 :)
2007-02-19T07:45:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	the real question i guess, is why the heck doesnt it give me any debug info?!
2007-02-19T07:46:00.000Z	cypherdelic	Toma-	what kind of debug info you are talking about
2007-02-19T07:46:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	obviously.
2007-02-19T07:46:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	im talking about the reason why the module wont get loaded... xorg.log doesnt say anything and neither does dmesg
2007-02-19T07:47:00.000Z	cypherdelic	Toma-	it logs it if you change the driver in that config: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-02-19T07:47:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	yeh, but i was hoping it would give me some sort of useful info :/
2007-02-19T07:48:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	i know i can get the display back using nv instead of nvidia.
2007-02-19T07:48:00.000Z	cypherdelic	Toma-	so nvidia does not work, you didnt say that
2007-02-19T07:48:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	oh ok, sorry.... thought it was the first thing i said
2007-02-19T07:49:00.000Z	cypherdelic	Toma-	hmm are you shure, that you installed the right restricted modules for your kernel?
2007-02-19T07:50:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	it was installed about 2 years ago and hasnt changed since. it was working yesterday aswell :/
2007-02-19T07:50:00.000Z	Toma-	cypherdelic	i just fixed it then. thx for the advice :)
