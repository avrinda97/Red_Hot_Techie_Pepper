2011-02-15T02:52:00.000Z	Abinadi		can someone tell me if there is a cli on mount that will tell me what partitions there are.  For some reason I'm not seeing a 250 GB partition that I *know* is present.
2011-02-15T02:52:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	You mean you hope is present :P
2011-02-15T02:52:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	fdisk -l is what you want
2011-02-15T02:52:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	no, I know it's there because when I'm in win 7, I can see it.
2011-02-15T02:54:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	fdisk -l gives nothing.  OH ok, I'll try that.
2011-02-15T02:54:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	Yeah, listen to ikonia
2011-02-15T02:59:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	this is what I'm getting and I can't make heads or tails of it except that there should be three NTFS partitions (one is the boot partition for windows 7)
2011-02-15T03:00:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	IIRC the system partition for Windows 7 is FAT
2011-02-15T03:00:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/567126/ that's what I'm getting. sorry
2011-02-15T03:00:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	No problem, looking now
2011-02-15T03:01:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	Which drive?
2011-02-15T03:01:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	I don't understand?
2011-02-15T03:02:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	the windows partition is sda1 I believe
2011-02-15T03:02:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	How big is the drive you're missing a partition on, so I know which one to look at?  This is showing a 640GB, a 1TB, and a 16GB
2011-02-15T03:04:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	ok, the boot drive for windows is the 640 gb partition.  the 1tb drive has one partition on it that is a boot partition for maverick and there is a 50 gb partition on the 640 GB drive for another installation of Maverick
2011-02-15T03:06:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	And I missed the 500GB as well...  None look like they're missing anything, they end on the right cylinders and there are no missing sections
2011-02-15T03:06:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	  the 16 GB drive is just a data (dropbox) usb stick,
2011-02-15T03:06:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	Ah
2011-02-15T03:07:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	Sorry to abandon you, but I came to ask a single question, and I've been here for at least an hour lol, I need to get back to work so I can be ready for tomorrow.
2011-02-15T03:07:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	ok, thanks for the look.!
2011-02-15T03:08:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	Abinadi	No problem.  I checked, I've been here about two hours.  Like I said, I don't see any missing sections on any drives.
2011-02-15T03:09:00.000Z	Abinadi	veovis_muaddib	ok, thanks again.  I'll see what other help I can scare up
