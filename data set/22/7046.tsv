2007-04-27T06:26:00.000Z	vic		OK guys
2007-04-27T06:26:00.000Z	vic		im REALLY confused
2007-04-27T06:26:00.000Z	vic		I made 3 partitions
2007-04-27T06:26:00.000Z	vic		2 x ext3 partitiona
2007-04-27T06:27:00.000Z	vic		one named / and one /home ON my 2nd hardrive
2007-04-27T06:27:00.000Z	vic		i also made a swap 2 GB on my other harddrive
2007-04-27T06:27:00.000Z	vic		Now i am installing ubuntu
2007-04-27T06:28:00.000Z	vic		ok
2007-04-27T06:29:00.000Z	vic		I made 2 ext3 partiotions named / and /home on one of my Harddrives, and 1 linux swap 2 GB on my other pphysical hard drive, not i am installing ubuntu and its asking me "prepare disk space", do I select guidied,  or manual
2007-04-27T06:29:00.000Z	vic		ok then i get a list of hard druves and partitions
2007-04-27T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 manual
2007-04-27T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 select what goes on which partition  and continue
2007-04-27T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 sorry go back a setp and select the other option
2007-04-27T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 sorry just point it to the partition you made for the swap
2007-04-27T06:33:00.000Z	vic	Pelo	dont i set the 2 partitions for / and for /home and leave swap?
2007-04-27T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 we donT' mean to give vague advice on this but most of us went through this step rather quicly and we don't remember all the options
2007-04-27T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 you saic you had allocated some space for the swap ?
2007-04-27T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 so point the /swap to that partition
2007-04-27T06:39:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 check the format box next to the / partition
2007-04-27T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 I think there is a migration applet somewhere , check the forum
2007-04-27T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 sudo apt-get install wine will do it very nicely and simply
2007-04-27T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	vic	 ask for help in #winehq to get steam working
