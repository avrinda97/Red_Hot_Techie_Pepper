2010-03-16T13:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex		what do i apt-get to install virtualbox guest additions?
2010-03-16T13:54:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	They're built in to virtualbox, read their manuals
2010-03-16T13:55:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	theadmin	they are, but they are also in repos i belive, so that should be easier/cleaner no?
2010-03-16T13:55:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	Dunno. I use the Oracle/Sun version
2010-04-04T17:32:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	Woah, that's horribly outdated
2010-04-04T17:34:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	theadmin	you are probably right :)
2010-11-02T17:09:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	What do you want it to do? %)
2010-11-02T17:10:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	pfftcht. Use hphosts.
2010-11-02T17:11:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	sudo wget http://www.montanamenagerie.org/hostsfile/hosts.txt -O /etc/hosts
2010-11-02T17:12:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	theadmin	the list of ips? isnt there something a bit more inteligent? or is that really the way to do it?
2010-11-02T17:13:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	Not exactly. It just points all those domains to 127.0.0.1... Actually, I'd make that 0.0.0.0, but that's just me :D
2010-11-02T17:13:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	theadmin	yes i understand
2010-11-02T17:16:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	theadmin	that hosts file wont even survive basic language barrier, like: sex vs seks
2010-11-02T17:17:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	Gosh :/ If these people want this porn, let em view it %) All in all I'm not sure there is a system for this.
2010-11-02T17:17:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	theadmin	seems to be google based
2011-06-18T17:45:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	except maybe ..
2011-06-18T17:45:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	;)
2011-06-18T17:45:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	theadmin	right
2011-06-18T17:47:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	Nothing, he's just, ahem.
2011-06-18T17:48:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	He's probably just used to utorrent
2011-06-18T17:49:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	Except I wanted to say something *much* more rude
2011-12-03T18:01:00.000Z	theadmin	brontosaurusrex	Isn't ctrl+d EOF, thus gonna quit the shell?
