2008-11-29T06:55:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	try following this tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOU8GIRUd_g
2008-11-29T06:59:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	I heard it might be possible to get dragon natuarlly speaking to work
2008-11-29T07:01:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	hehe sorry. if RAdams suggestion doesn't work, look into "voxforge" http://www.voxforge.org/
2008-11-29T07:03:00.000Z	Dillizar	draco1234	it works just fine thank you
2008-11-29T07:04:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	ah, glad I could help =)
2008-11-29T07:41:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	so you do have a working microphone?
2008-11-29T07:42:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	ok, then first of all, plug the microophone in and make sure the recording volume is high
2008-11-29T07:44:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	yes?
2008-11-29T07:46:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	ok, next, right click on your panel, then "add applet", then pick voice contorl
2008-11-29T07:52:00.000Z	Dillizar	draco1234	and then what it's on ready and thats all
2008-11-29T07:53:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	then just speak into the microphone... I'm trying it right now.... if i yell "firefox firefox firefox", it opens up a text editor! ahahah!
2008-11-29T07:54:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	wow, watch out, running that voice control really overheats my processor
2008-11-29T07:54:00.000Z	Dillizar	draco1234	it shoes just listening its not opening any thing :D
2008-11-29T07:55:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	i think that's just because it isn't very accurate. If you yell enough things at it, sooner or later it does do something
2008-11-29T07:57:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	for example, I just yelled "file file file run run file file", and then IRC said, "are you sure you want to quit?" .... so it does do something..... just not what I want
2008-11-29T07:57:00.000Z	Dillizar	draco1234	are you crewing with me :D cuz i am screaming my ass :D
2008-11-29T07:57:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	is your mic volume turned up? I'm not yelling really loud
2008-11-29T07:58:00.000Z	Dillizar	draco1234	wow it opened a firefox :D
2008-11-29T07:59:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	did you say "firefox" to do it, or something else entirely?
2008-11-29T07:59:00.000Z	Dillizar	draco1234	or you kust need to say COMPUTER first like in star trek :P
2008-11-29T08:05:00.000Z	draco1234	Dillizar	One command that always works is "minimize the window"
