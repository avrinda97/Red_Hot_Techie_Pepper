2007-07-08T05:15:00.000Z	teratoma	Ahmed-Bahaa	have you ever run windows on this laptop ?
2007-07-08T05:15:00.000Z	teratoma	Ahmed-Bahaa	how did you set the brightness and contrast when you were using windows ?
2007-07-08T05:15:00.000Z	Ahmed-Bahaa	teratoma	from a program
2007-07-08T05:16:00.000Z	Ahmed-Bahaa	teratoma	there was a program related to the laptop
2007-07-08T05:16:00.000Z	teratoma	Ahmed-Bahaa	was there a keyboard combination you could use?  like  Function  f1
2007-07-08T05:16:00.000Z	Ahmed-Bahaa	teratoma	i think there is but i never used it .. alwayz opend the program
2007-07-08T05:17:00.000Z	Ahmed-Bahaa	teratoma	 so ?
2007-07-08T05:18:00.000Z	teratoma	Ahmed-Bahaa	you should figure out what the keyboardcombinations are to set your laptops brightness and contrast
2007-07-08T05:18:00.000Z	Ahmed-Bahaa	teratoma	okk thxxx :)
2007-07-08T05:18:00.000Z	teratoma	Ahmed-Bahaa	I had similar problems, the keyboard combinations for me only work from the time the laptop actually boots, until the window manager starts.  when the window manager starts, the special windows keys stopped working
2007-07-08T05:20:00.000Z	Ahmed-Bahaa	teratoma	 i will try to use the cominations
