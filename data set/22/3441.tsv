2009-04-10T06:04:00.000Z	Mewtwo		I can't help but honestly feel like I'm the only person to ever encounter circular dependencies.
2009-04-10T06:04:00.000Z	Mewtwo		It's making it impossible to compile Peng
2009-04-10T06:04:00.000Z	Mewtwo		thus, impossible to get online.
2009-04-10T06:05:00.000Z	Mewtwo		I'd just apt-get the files if I could be online, but I can't
2009-04-10T06:06:00.000Z	Mewtwo		It went through three times
2009-04-10T06:07:00.000Z	Mewtwo		I just wish I could figure out those dependencies :/
2009-04-10T06:07:00.000Z	Mewtwo		or a way to force installation of one
2009-04-10T06:08:00.000Z	Mewtwo		I got it to compile on Damn Small Linux just fine
2009-04-10T06:08:00.000Z	Mewtwo		I could get a link to a tutorial linking to it if you need...
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	Mewtwo		My problem is compiling it, is all - can't meet the dependencies
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	mgolisch	Mewtwo	 i mean
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	Mewtwo		Yeah, my mom's an idiot
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	Mewtwo		so I have to jump through tons of hoops
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	mgolisch		what is a aol dialer?
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	Mewtwo		to get online unless I'm on XP
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	Mewtwo		It lets one dial into their AOL account
2009-04-10T06:09:00.000Z	Mewtwo		and be online
2009-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	mgolisch	Mewtwo	lol? you need a software to access your internets?
2009-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	Mewtwo		Yeah, sadly.
2009-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	mgolisch	Mewtwo	is that a joke?
2009-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	mgolisch		omg aol sucks
2009-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	Mewtwo	mgolisch	AOL is a joke.
