2011-09-04T09:51:00.000Z	bobweaver		so I had gnome 2
2011-09-04T09:52:00.000Z	bobweaver		swiched to plasma 4.67
2011-09-04T09:52:00.000Z	bobweaver		swiched to plasma 4.7
2011-09-04T09:53:00.000Z	bobweaver		no all programs that I have under ect/skel are named alacarte-made-###.desktop instead of the nameof program .desktop
2011-09-04T09:53:00.000Z	bobweaver		this makes /etc/xdg/menu real confussing
2011-09-04T09:55:00.000Z	bobweaver		but if I do a say sudo nano alacarte-application-1.desktop
2011-09-04T09:55:00.000Z	bobweaver		I can see the name of the program
2011-09-04T09:56:00.000Z	bobweaver		so i was wondering how to write bash script that pulls the name out of it and renames the file by the name it pulls out
2011-09-04T09:56:00.000Z	bobweaver		beta today almoxarife

2011-09-04T10:03:00.000Z	almoxarife	bobweaver	fine then, does remote desktop have a built in time out?
2011-12-06T12:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	bobweaver	remove the package
2011-12-06T12:55:00.000Z	bobweaver	almoxarife	 I just remove with apt before running ubiquity ?
2011-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	bobweaver	you don't want it? sudo apt-get remove popularity-contest                  done!
2011-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	bobweaver	almoxarife	sweet I will try
2011-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	bobweaver	almoxarife	 I hope that it is not build into ubiquity
2011-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	almoxarife	bobweaver	it will probably brake ubuntu-desktop though
2012-11-22T08:38:00.000Z	bobweaver	almoxarife	 sorry that is what it was called in the start when it was QT
