2011-05-28T18:23:00.000Z	no_idea		i need some help, ubuntu kinda died yesterday when i was doing a restart. i ran the recovery mode and it kept popping up things about a "drdy err", im on a livedisk on the same computer right now and  i cant mount the drive due to the daemon being inhibited
2011-05-28T18:25:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	can't you even do something like "sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt"?
2011-05-28T18:26:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	imagebin.org or imm.io
2011-05-28T18:26:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	or imgur.com or ... well any image site
2011-05-28T18:30:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	vibhav: http://imagebin.org/155605
2011-05-28T18:31:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	Specify the mount-point explicitly, like sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
2011-05-28T18:32:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	not sure what you mean
2011-05-28T18:32:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	You mount devices to some folder
2011-05-28T18:32:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	That's called a "mount-point"
2011-05-28T18:32:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	the syntax of the mount command is: mount DEVICE MOUNTPOINT
2011-05-28T18:37:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	where do i put a mount point folder?
2011-05-28T18:38:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	Typically it's just mnt. So run this: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
2011-05-28T18:40:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	it says its mounted, now how do i get to it?
2011-05-28T18:41:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	nautilus /mnt
2011-05-28T18:43:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	would this allow me to restart and expect it to boot properly from the drive?
2011-05-28T18:44:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	Doubt that.
2011-05-28T18:45:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	how might i fix my drdy error then?
2011-05-28T18:45:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	no idea.
2011-05-28T18:45:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	You asked how to mount the drive, I said
2011-05-28T18:49:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	how do i mount a drive thats invisible?
2011-05-28T18:49:00.000Z	theadmin	no_idea	lolwut?
2011-05-28T18:50:00.000Z	no_idea	theadmin	anddam: ive got an external drive that literally does not show up that worked fine the other day
