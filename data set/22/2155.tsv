2009-09-12T18:23:00.000Z	Ayla		hello
2009-09-12T18:24:00.000Z	Ayla		I've got a problem, my session does not want to start
2009-09-12T18:24:00.000Z	Ayla		nautilus segfaults :/
2009-09-12T18:25:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	was it like that since you installed ubuntu or is it a new issue
2009-09-12T18:25:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	new issue
2009-09-12T18:26:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	in that case you should be able to fix it quite easily by deleting you configuration for nautilus etc.
2009-09-12T18:26:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	where is it stored ?
2009-09-12T18:27:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	it is probably in several folders in .gconf in your home but it might be best just to remove all of your .config folders
2009-09-12T18:29:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	on my computer at least .nautilus is empty - you may just need to delete all of your .files then it should work (you may loose preferences this way so back up first).
2009-09-12T18:32:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	I moved the .config, .gconf and .gconfd folders
2009-09-12T18:32:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	and the problem is still here
2009-09-12T18:32:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	in that case have you made any changes to your system setup etc. recently
2009-09-12T18:33:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	I did an update, and I tested e17 (which was already installed), that's all
2009-09-12T18:35:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	that might be what broke it then. Could you try creating a new user then seeing if it works correctly as that one.
2009-09-12T18:38:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	I added user "bob", and did "startx", but nautilus does not start
2009-09-12T18:43:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	in that case you might have to try ubuntu in recovery mode or reinstall.
2009-09-13T05:07:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	how did you loose it exactly?
2009-09-13T05:07:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	hi again ;)
2009-09-13T05:07:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	hi
2009-09-13T05:08:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	I uninstalled pulseaudio...
2009-09-13T05:08:00.000Z	twright	Ayla	ah, it that did not happen in previous versions of ubuntu (oops)
2009-09-13T05:09:00.000Z	Ayla	twright	I'm under karmic, is that a bug ?
