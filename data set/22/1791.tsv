2010-01-05T22:12:00.000Z	JanSch		my x server terminates unexpectedly each time i visit a certain web site. can anybody give me hints what to do about it or where to look?
2010-01-05T22:13:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	did I read correctly? what has the x server to do with a web site?
2010-01-05T22:14:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	you did read correctly. good question
2010-01-05T22:14:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	please try with another browser
2010-01-05T22:33:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	/var/log/Xorg.0.log?
2010-01-05T22:30:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	was able to reproduce the problem with konqueror - xserver restarts once i visit a certain page.
2010-01-05T22:31:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	the machine was plagued with random freezes before (mouse moved, CTRL-ALT-F1 or numlock did not work)
2010-01-05T22:31:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	acpi and apic are disabled in an attempt to stop the freezes
2010-01-05T22:31:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	Strange please take a look at your x-server log in /var/log/x.....
2010-01-05T22:33:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	thats the one - if you want you could !pastebin it
2010-01-05T22:37:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d4d2de822
2010-01-05T22:44:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	any idea about the log?
2010-01-05T22:46:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	sorry - I was away
2010-01-05T22:50:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	I see nothing queer in the log - my first advice would be "avoid that page" - but if you "really" need it you could install links2 (a text/graph mode browser) and visit the page with links2 -g http://....
2010-01-05T22:51:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	that page is the login page for one of the popular freemailers. i highly assume it will happen with lots of other sites too, that one is just the first i visited
2010-01-05T22:55:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	i suspect some graphics stuff (buggy driver) - anything i could try to make it work normally?
2010-01-05T22:56:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	I'm at a loss here - please try it with links2 -g (different graphics model) - that *should* work
2010-01-05T22:58:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	just as an experiment or as a solution? the pc is used by other users, and they surely wont accept a differnet browser as a solution
2010-01-05T22:58:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	just as experiment
2010-01-05T23:00:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	seems to work
2010-01-05T23:00:00.000Z	JanSch	guntbert	given that links2 does not seem to understand stylesheets and probably also no flash etc., this won't help a lot
2010-01-05T23:02:00.000Z	guntbert	JanSch	then it really seems to be a graphics problem - but maybe someone else should have a look at the x log - please post your problem to the channel again - maybe I'm just overlooking something obvious
