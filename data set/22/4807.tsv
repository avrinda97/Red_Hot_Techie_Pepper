2007-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	Hilikus_		guys, give me reasons why it would be worth reformating my drive with a native linux partition instead of using ntfs
2007-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	you planning on using ubuntu under wubi ?
2007-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	wubi?
2007-10-13T12:37:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	nevermind then on wubi .... but ubuntu on ntfs is a bad idea imho
2007-10-13T12:38:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	I dont think ubuntu would work on ntfs natively
2007-10-13T12:40:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	again, i dont plan to run ubuntu on ntfs, its just that i have 11gb of music in an ntfs hdd that i moved to my server (physically) and i want to access them
2007-10-13T12:40:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	ubuntu reads ntfs just fine natively.... so you should not have a problem...
2007-10-13T12:42:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	if the ntfs drive/partition is on the same system you're running ubuntu on, it will see it and mount it read-only so you can play your mp3's no prob
2007-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	but im wondering about permissions and that crap
2007-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	you'll default to read-only permissions
2007-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	you dont need to defrag ext3 or reiserfs
2007-10-13T12:48:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	there's a lot school never told anyone...
2007-10-13T12:49:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	of course, but when you discuss so much about disk fragmentation, you wont totally mention something like, but some FS avoid it like this:
2007-10-13T12:50:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	ext3 is a good filesystem, but resierfs is a lot newer and faster... ext3 these days is used for those who want cross-compatability with other linux distros that may not yet support resier (few) and also since ext3 has a much longer track record by virtue of it being in existence much longer, it's inherently more reliable.. though I have useed reiser for years without issue
2007-10-13T12:51:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	im going to read about it right now
2007-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS
2007-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	you'll notice there's a paragraph on performance.... resier is 10-15x faster than ext3
2007-10-13T13:36:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	do you use raiserfs v3 or 4?
2007-10-13T13:37:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	the benchmarks dont look too god
2007-10-13T13:37:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	im reading it takes for ever to mount
2007-10-13T13:39:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Hilikus_	you're ill informed.
2007-10-13T13:39:00.000Z	Hilikus_	Bossmanbeta	look at the link i pasted
