2012-01-29T18:44:00.000Z	Skew-_^	Stereocaulon	nVida cards is bad for linux? i gotr truble whit my ati card ;S
2012-01-29T18:45:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	nVidia cards bad for linux? Where did you get that silly idea?

2012-01-29T18:50:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	I see, well you *did* ask for advice didn't you?
2012-01-29T18:51:00.000Z	Skew-_^	Stereocaulon	yes ;) and iam gonna turn away from ATI cards ;P only problem whit it, damn have u seen this? ASUS ZENBOOK UX31E RY012V - 13.3"
2012-01-29T18:52:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	it looks like pretty precise Macbook pro ripoff...
2012-01-29T18:53:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	When I look up the specs I see Intel Graphics. Well, for 2D graphics those chips are actually really good.
2012-01-29T18:55:00.000Z	Skew-_^	Stereocaulon	:) when u talk about 3D graphics you meen like 3D movies and 3D games whit glasses?
2012-01-29T18:55:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	well...Thinkpads tend to be mostly intact when you drop them. I'm not so sure about this one. Your data will probably be safe, because it's an SSD. but the rest...
2012-01-29T18:55:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	no, I talk about any 3D accelaration at all...
2012-01-29T18:57:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	The point is, that laptop is not usable for games or 3D modelling, for humble office jobs, this will do fine.
2012-01-29T18:58:00.000Z	Skew-_^	Stereocaulon	i travle alot so i need one that is powerfull and not so heavy
2012-01-29T18:59:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	you still haven't told us what you need it for. What are your needs for this lappy?
2012-01-29T19:01:00.000Z	Skew-_^	Stereocaulon	hmm, vbox, office, web browsing, movies, music, some games, maby autocad or scetchup
2012-01-29T19:04:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	Try browsing www.winehq.org/appdb, you may not even need Windows.
2012-01-29T19:05:00.000Z	Skew-_^	Stereocaulon	i need windows for ipad, and iphone sync/backup :P the itunes true wine is buggy
2012-01-29T19:05:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	you could start Windows in a VM, you know...
2012-01-29T19:06:00.000Z	Skew-_^	Stereocaulon	yes vbox^^
2012-01-29T19:06:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Skew-_^	 or kvm/ Xen (more performance, but less user friendliness)
