2008-03-02T05:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	Then it is not ttyS0
2008-03-02T05:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	as in lspic ?
2008-03-02T05:17:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	trying to connect to a serial device... don't know the name of the device to connect to.
2008-03-02T05:18:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	as in /dev/tty#?
2008-03-02T05:18:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	so I'm trying to figure out what device is what on my computer with the serial port.
2008-03-02T05:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	Find the modem by going to a terminal and typing dmesg | grep ttyS
2008-03-02T05:19:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	k, bbiab
2008-03-02T05:23:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	I've got ttyS0 (I believe) as the internal modem.
2008-03-02T05:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	Test in terminal sudo screen /dev/ttyS0
2008-03-02T05:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	 type "ATZ" then return   it should return OK
2008-03-02T05:26:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	no response
2008-03-02T05:31:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	let me give you a pastbin of the dmesg....
2008-03-02T05:32:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58041
2008-03-02T05:41:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	did you get a chance to check the paste?
2008-03-02T05:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	No sorry .. missed it
2008-03-02T05:42:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58041
2008-03-02T05:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	If it is not using a std serial port then it might be one of those winmodems...
2008-03-02T05:44:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	not trying to get to the modem though... I'm trying to get to a serial port so I can communicate with a serial device.
2008-03-02T05:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	what type of serial device?
2008-03-02T05:45:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	it's a pda with Familiar Linux on it.
2008-03-02T05:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spr0k3t_	Sorry I am not familiar with how to access that.  the screen mode I showed you earlier should get some sort of response
2008-03-02T05:48:00.000Z	spr0k3t_	Jack_Sparrow	that's okay... I have to connect 115200 8n1, no hardware, no flow control... and you're right... it should just communicate.
