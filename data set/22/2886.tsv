2009-02-03T17:24:00.000Z	Guest79506		is ssl configured by default in ubuntu
2009-02-03T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	ssl in what respect
2009-02-03T17:25:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	I want to use ftp via ssl to get a file from my web server...the script works using ftp but not sftp
2009-02-03T17:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	then thats going to be ssl on your server not setup
2009-02-03T17:26:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	the php script returns that it couldn't connect to me...
2009-02-03T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	yes, your sever does not have an ftp server running that is ssl enabled
2009-02-03T17:27:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	can i get around that..the server is a shared host
2009-02-03T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	you can install / configure ssh to use tls/ssl ?
2009-02-03T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	sorry - ftp
2009-02-03T17:28:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	how?
2009-02-03T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	what ftp server are you running ?
2009-02-03T17:28:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	not sure what the server is running.
2009-02-03T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	contact your hosting provider then, they can help
2009-02-03T17:32:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	they have sftp via port 22.  Is there a way to get php to connect?
2009-02-03T17:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	tell your client to connect on 22
2009-02-03T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	not that I'm aware of, the shell interface is very easythough
2009-02-03T18:01:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	the problem with ssl was that i needed to enable passive mode because the server couldn't connect through my firewall.
2009-02-03T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	thats not an ssl problem
2009-02-03T18:01:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	 But it worked
2009-02-03T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	yes - thats YOUR firewall problem, not an ssl problem
2009-02-03T18:02:00.000Z	Guest79506	ikonia	 sure but it worked via ftp.  So I got stumped.
2009-02-03T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest79506	yes, you set the time of the day you want the cronjob to run at - that's what crontab is
