2011-03-22T01:16:00.000Z	tbruff13		ok i need help real fast i want to put ubuntu on a flash drive only i dont want to install it I want to run it off of the flash drive from school i have tried the startup disk utility but it takes to long to boot and freezes once i click try I would use unetbootin but i cant make it activily save things
2011-03-22T01:16:00.000Z	tbruff13		like save a report in the ubuntu installation
2011-03-22T01:16:00.000Z	tbruff13		for later
2011-03-22T01:17:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	I suggest the use of the Alternate CD to install to the flash drive.  It's what I did.  On the other hand, I was using an 8G stick.  A 4G should work, but less may be pushing it.
2011-03-22T01:19:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	I seem to remember Unetbootin having an option about persistence - if you use that, it'll create a file that changes (including to your home folder) get saved to.  Works wonderfully.
2011-03-22T01:20:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	where is the option
2011-03-22T01:20:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	It's been a while since I used it, hang on a sec, I'll check.
2011-03-22T01:23:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	you there
2011-03-22T01:23:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	Yup, hang on a sec.
2011-03-22T01:28:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	Sorry, looks like I misremembered.  http://rudd-o.com/new-projects/portablelinux does the job, but is a little out-of-date now.  Still, it should work.  Unfortunately, if the usb-creator doesn't work for you, that's the best I've got.
2011-03-22T01:29:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	sorry if im annoying but i dont know what to do im trying to google
2011-03-22T01:33:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	You're not annoying me (sorry for the delay; I'm lagging. Ugh.) but I am not quite sure what to do to solve your problem.
2011-03-22T01:41:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	In theory, nothing bad should happen.  However, since it will have been built using older versions of various packages, it's likely to be unreliable.
2011-03-22T01:41:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	okay so where is a new package
2011-03-22T01:41:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	There isn't one.
2011-03-22T01:42:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	 well im trying it i will post any issues and see if i can make it work
2011-03-22T01:43:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	how do you point to your cd drive the program is asking me where the iso is
2011-03-22T01:46:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	It won't use the CD if it's asking for an ISO, unless the iso file is on the CD.  The actual file, that is, not a CD burned from the ISO.
2011-03-22T01:51:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	the bugisti themes excuse my spelling
2011-03-22T01:56:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	 should we upgrade to 11 when it comes out
2011-03-22T01:57:00.000Z	Darael	tbruff13	It's really up to you.  Unity should have most of its rough edges fixed by then, so it should be usable, but as I say.  Your choice.
2011-03-22T01:58:00.000Z	tbruff13	Darael	can we undo unity
