2006-09-03T16:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle		hexion: which sata chipset you got?
2006-09-03T16:02:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	uli 1689
2006-09-03T16:04:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	compiled myself
2006-09-03T16:04:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	I couldn't make wireless and sata work when compiling myself 2.6.17
2006-09-03T16:05:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	no, I use acx module right now (2.6.15-26)
2006-09-03T16:07:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	I have followed this howto: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217657&highlight=2.6.17   if you had a acx wireless, and a uli SATA, what would you do to make them work? (I don't know how to path kernel)
2006-09-03T16:10:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	sorry, I can't understand.... you mean enabling an option in make xconfig?
2006-09-03T16:11:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	because my system freezes 5 times a day when using my SATA :(
2006-09-03T16:12:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	dmesg tells me I'm using sata_uli
2006-09-03T16:13:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	ok, thank you :)
2006-09-03T16:58:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	hello again :) I think I have the cause I can't compile with wireless enabled... If I see /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.15drivers/net/wireless I have a directory called ACX, but that is not in linux-source-2.6.17
2006-09-03T16:59:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	is linux-source-2.6.17 incomplete? do I have to download any sources more to get acx?
2006-09-03T05:00:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	how do I do that?
2006-09-03T05:00:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	you reffer on going to www.ali.com in example?
2006-09-03T05:01:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	I think I need to learn someday :)
2006-09-03T05:02:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	ok, I'll search the net :)
2006-09-03T05:02:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	yes, that is :)
2006-09-03T05:02:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	and how about just copying acx directory from 2.6.15 to 2.6.17? can it work?
2006-09-03T05:03:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	yes, I am going to try that too
2006-09-03T05:04:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	ok, then I copy the dir, delete .o files, and compile to try
2006-09-03T05:04:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	thanks a lot :)
2006-09-03T05:04:00.000Z	HeXiOn	BlueEagle	ok, I'll check them :)
