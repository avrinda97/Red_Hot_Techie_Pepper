2011-03-09T03:45:00.000Z	sizzlefire		How can I tell the filesystem type of an external harddrive?
2011-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	Look at the output of sudo fdisk -l while it is connected
2011-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	Or look at it in gparted if you have that installed
2011-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	I don't, its just been refusing to take file permissions, each time I change them it says it successfully does but doesn't, i was figuring it was due to the filesystem type, but its NTFS
2011-03-09T03:49:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	Look at sudo fdisk -l  (yeah that sounds probable, ntfs does not support permissions in windows versions before 7)
2011-03-09T03:50:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	I did, but even if windows doesnt support permissions, does ubuntu?
2011-03-09T03:50:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	It's actually NTFS that supports permissions or not.  The version of NTFS that xp and vista use does not support permissions.  The version that windows 7 uses does support permissions
2011-03-09T03:51:00.000Z	sizzlefire		okay so i  setup the drive on a windows 7 computer
2011-03-09T03:51:00.000Z	sizzlefire		and its now hooked up to a ubuntu computer
2011-03-09T03:51:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	Now you're in territory that I do not have memorized
2011-03-09T03:52:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	It sounds like maybe the 'root' on the Ubuntu system is not the same 'root' on the windows system.  Who owns the files according to Ubuntu?  Who owns the files according to Windows 7?
2011-03-09T03:53:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	according to ubuntu the files are owned by the user robert in group robert
2011-03-09T03:54:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	are you robert?  What are the permissions?  777 ?
2011-03-09T03:55:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	I am robert, and the permissions are 700, and if I try to change them, they just revert back to 700
2011-03-09T03:57:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	It's probably going by UID not by username.  Try changing the permissions to 777 in windows then come back to ubuntu and see if you can change them (or do things to the files)
2011-03-09T03:58:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	I can already do things to the files, its only encountering errors when im trying to allow apache to access
2011-03-09T03:58:00.000Z	sizzlefire		then this happens: http://files3.llarchive.com
2011-03-09T03:59:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	mmm, I see.  Yeah try changing them in windows and see what happens
2011-03-09T03:59:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	alright i will, thatll take a minute cause i gotta move it lol
2011-03-09T03:59:00.000Z	edbian	sizzlefire	For what it's worth you're doing the right thing by changing the permissions
2011-03-09T04:02:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	yeah, i figured
2011-03-09T04:13:00.000Z	sizzlefire	edbian	i fixed it
