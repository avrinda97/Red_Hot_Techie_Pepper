2011-12-22T10:04:00.000Z	robmillernow		I have a blank desktop background -- no windows, no bars, no nothing.  What the hell's going on?  I'd like to reinstall, but i can't get it to boot from CD
2011-12-22T10:04:00.000Z	robmillernow		If i could get the system to display normally, I wouldn't need to reinstall, but I don't see any alternative
2011-12-22T10:04:00.000Z	robmillernow		CAN ANYONE HELP?
2011-12-22T10:05:00.000Z	robmillernow		i'm trying to revive my father's Dell Inspiron.  It's been running Ubuntu for over a year, and since I was here last holiday, it's gone tits up.
2011-12-22T10:06:00.000Z	robmillernow		I WANT to be able to recommend this operating system, but advice like "trash the pc" doesn't jam me full of confidence.
2011-12-22T10:07:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Why can't you boot from cd? Is it enabled as the 1st boot option in bios?
2011-12-22T10:08:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Try f9 or f12, sometimes those give you the option to boot from cd.
2011-12-22T10:11:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Is this a laptop or a desktop? What is your motherboard manufacturer and model?
2011-12-22T10:12:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Ok, laptop brand and model?
2011-12-22T10:16:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	It should be the f2 key, I'd suggest turning the laptop off, then turn it on and as soon as you hit the power button, hit f2 as fast as you can but be sure to release in between taps.
2011-12-22T10:16:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	fast and repeatedly of course.
2011-12-22T10:17:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	no problem.
2011-12-22T10:20:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Can you disable booting to the hdd?
2011-12-22T10:26:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Its possible, it will tell you on the tray.
2011-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Mac? I thought it was a Dell..
2011-12-22T10:36:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Like Apple Mac? Why are you looking at Mac directions if you have a Dell? I'm confused.
2011-12-22T10:41:00.000Z	powertool08	robmillernow	Thats trying to boot from the network then.
