2008-10-07T02:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 not if you know how to manually configure grub.
2008-10-07T02:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	  it pays to learn grub very well, when  youa re doign things like that.
2008-10-07T02:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 you dont install to the 'same partition'
2008-10-07T02:24:00.000Z	harriman	dr_willis	what do you mean
2008-10-07T02:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 if you have linux, windows, and osx- each will be on its own partition.
2008-10-07T02:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 eacgh on their own hard drive - would be even better.
2008-10-07T02:25:00.000Z	harriman	dr_willis	i'm installing to laptop with one hd
2008-10-07T02:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 ive not read any wiki.. so cant verify..
2008-10-07T02:26:00.000Z	harriman	dr_willis	they are saying linux and windwos same partition
2008-10-07T02:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 windows must be on its own partition also.
2008-10-07T02:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 you will do so - during the install process.. yes..
2008-10-07T02:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriman	 example layout ,  (windows) (osx) (linux) (swap partition)
