2011-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	schwinn434		I have tried to dual boot Ubuntu 10.10 with Windows xp (it works, as long as I don't install Ubuntu to a seperate HD)
2011-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	schwinn434		I have to install both OS onto the same HD to get the computer to dual boot, would like to install ubuntu 10.10 to its own hd
2011-01-20T08:42:00.000Z	schwinn434		not sure my pentium 4 bios support this rvn
2011-01-20T08:42:00.000Z	nit-wit	schwinn434	is the second hd a slave that can't be first to boot
2011-01-20T08:43:00.000Z	schwinn434		the second hd is a slave with ubuntu installed
2011-01-20T08:43:00.000Z	schwinn434		it shows up under the grup menu but will not boot
2011-01-20T08:43:00.000Z	nit-wit	schwinn434	can you put the slave first in the bios?
2011-01-20T08:43:00.000Z	schwinn434		have not tried to do this nit-wit did install windows xp first though
2011-01-20T08:44:00.000Z	nit-wit	schwinn434	put the slave to be read first.
2011-01-20T08:44:00.000Z	schwinn434	nit-wit	thx
2011-01-20T08:44:00.000Z	schwinn434		will try this next time
2011-01-20T08:44:00.000Z	nit-wit	schwinn434	assuming it has grub in its mbr.
2011-01-20T08:45:00.000Z	schwinn434		not sure if grub is installed in the mbr
2011-01-20T08:45:00.000Z	schwinn434		I installed xp first then ubuntu - telling it to install to the 2nd slave hd
2011-01-20T08:45:00.000Z	nit-wit	schwinn434	does xp boot straight in without grub now.
2011-01-20T08:46:00.000Z	schwinn434		again shows up in the grub menu - but will not boot
2011-01-20T08:46:00.000Z	schwinn434	nit-wit	I installed both os s on one hd, now
2011-01-20T08:46:00.000Z	schwinn434		and it works, with ubuntu 10.10 the default
2011-01-20T08:47:00.000Z	schwinn434		gave up on installing unbuntu 10.10 to its own hd
2011-01-20T08:47:00.000Z	nit-wit	schwinn434	okay, if you can get the slave first in the bios you could install there.
2011-01-20T08:48:00.000Z	schwinn434	nit-wit	thx for the info
2011-01-20T08:48:00.000Z	schwinn434	nit-wit	will try to get slave hd to boot first next go around
