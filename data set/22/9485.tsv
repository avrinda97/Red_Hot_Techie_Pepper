2005-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	SP		How much RAM do you hace, hit3k?
2005-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	SP		Serious? I couldn't find it..
2005-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	SP		Hmm

2005-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	SP		Where can I find it?

2005-11-03T06:52:00.000Z	kent	SP	well technically yes.  But its more easy to do it from synaptic as that example shows..
2005-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	kent	SP	but if you can do it from editing sources.list go ahead..  its your choise
2005-11-03T06:54:00.000Z	kent	SP	correct :)
2005-11-03T06:56:00.000Z	kent	SP	your choise. Both works...  synaptic is easier since you can search there. Search for beep-media-player
2005-11-03T06:58:00.000Z	kent	SP	start it from a terminal and see if it complains about something..
2005-11-03T06:59:00.000Z	kent	SP	great :) You might need some mp3-plugin though.. but you'l notice if that works or not :)
2005-11-03T07:01:00.000Z	kent	SP	ah..  ok. Well, it should not be a problem. The first link I sent you assumed you where running breezy..    but if you just added universe etc it should be ok. :)
2005-11-03T07:02:00.000Z	kent	SP	 not had the time to upgrade yet.. or you just dont feel like it?
2005-11-03T07:02:00.000Z	kent	SP	and you are sure you have gstreamer0.8-mad installed? i think bmp needs it to play mp3. But it should complain.. not just freeze :(
2005-11-03T07:03:00.000Z	kent	SP	if you have problems with xserver you should probably file bugreports on it. It should work for every one..
2005-11-03T07:03:00.000Z	kent	SP	search for it in synaptic. :)
2005-11-03T07:05:00.000Z	kent	SP	hopefully it works now :)
