2008-04-27T15:44:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	`dpkg-reconfigure xorg-server` ?
2008-04-27T15:45:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	sounds like the resolution that xorg server is attempting isn't supported by your flatscreen?  -a crt would likely work thought?
2008-04-27T15:46:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	er.. perhaps `dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg`
2008-04-27T15:48:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	`dpkg -l '*xorg*' |grep ^i` will show you if it is
2008-04-27T15:53:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	no prob

2008-04-27T15:59:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	no.  leave blank/zero
2008-04-27T16:00:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	I believe that's asking for what mem the kernel should reserve for yer card IF the card dosn't already have (or ask for on it's own?) it's own mem

2008-04-27T16:13:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	`sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/`
2008-04-27T16:13:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	er, sudo not required
2008-04-27T16:14:00.000Z	tkooda	N1NCHN41L5	`cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/Desktop/` to copy it to yer desktop..  putting a copy back will restore, etc
