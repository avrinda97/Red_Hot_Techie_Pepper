2010-02-18T09:14:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	you don't need to convert your key to hex.
2010-02-18T09:14:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	why would you want to ever use wep?
2010-02-18T09:15:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	huh?

2010-02-18T09:16:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	right, you don't convert it. the router hashes it for you.
2010-02-18T09:17:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	you dont need to know anythinga bout the hex of your password.
2010-02-18T09:17:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	go to 192.168.1.1
2010-02-18T09:17:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	and see what your password is in here.
2010-02-18T09:18:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	hook a wired cable and hook your computer up to the router and get at the config page that way.
2010-02-18T09:19:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	so state what your problem is.
2010-02-18T09:20:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	right. do you know what your passphrase is?
2010-02-18T09:20:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	or your password.
2010-02-18T09:20:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	you type it in your wireless icon that is in your notification area on the ubuntu panel on your desktop after you select your network.
2010-02-18T09:22:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	make sure your wireless is turned on (if you have a laptop) some of them have a little toggle switch on the side of it.
2010-02-18T09:27:00.000Z	thiefy	yoyoma	are you still alive? did you fall off your chair?
