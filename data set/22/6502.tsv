2006-10-10T08:56:00.000Z	nemo_work		aye, although they do nag you about licensing
2006-10-10T08:57:00.000Z	nemo_work		there are a couple of viruses I've heard of, but mostly proof of concept stuff.
2006-10-10T08:57:00.000Z	nemo_work		no real exploit vectors out there.
2006-10-10T08:58:00.000Z	nemo_work		actually, I'd pity the poor fool who tried to write a worm that would work consistently across all linux distros :)  joys of lack of monoculture
2006-10-10T08:59:00.000Z	nemo_work		192.168.xxx.xxx
2006-10-10T09:01:00.000Z	nemo_work		with PSK?
2006-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	nemo_work		hell yeah
2006-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	nemo_work		WPA2 with PSK (a good PSK) essentially unbreakable
2006-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	nemo_work		WEP - can be broken in a few seconds with enough network activity
2006-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	nemo_work		pre-shared key
2006-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	chopchop_	nemo_work	how can you break wep in a few second?
2006-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	nemo_work	chopchop_	google for it. there are a number of toolkits out there.
2006-10-10T09:04:00.000Z	nemo_work	chopchop_	a few seconds is moderately exaggerated, but not if the network has a lot of traffic
2006-10-10T09:04:00.000Z	nemo_work	chopchop_	let's say a few minutes then.
2006-10-10T09:04:00.000Z	chopchop_	nemo_work	i didnt say it imposible but few scnd sound like a joke

2006-10-10T09:05:00.000Z	nemo_work	chopchop_	the info I read on it claimed 30 seconds or so
2006-10-10T09:05:00.000Z	nemo_work	chopchop_	since the attack is analytic, not merely brute force
2006-10-10T09:06:00.000Z	nemo_work	chopchop_	since I don't use wireless, I've never had cause to try it, personally
