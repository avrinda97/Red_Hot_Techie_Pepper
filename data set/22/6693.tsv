2006-08-25T09:46:00.000Z	hush		I need some help fixing my ubuntu :(
2006-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	hush		I'm pretty sure I have the messed up ubuntu update problem that is posted on Ubuntu.com - but I can't figure out how to fix it
2006-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	it has already been fixed
2006-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	from the command line sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get upgrade
2006-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	mine hasn't
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	i did all of those things - mine is still messed up
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	the new package should be downloaded and installed (it did for me)
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	crap... I don't know then :-/
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	yeah it sucks :(
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	maybe try a dist-upgrade  :-/ ?
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	i did :(
2006-08-25T09:50:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	think i should reinstall? it wont hurt me any.. i've only had ubuntu for 5 or so days
2006-08-25T09:51:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	no idea, you probably want someone in the channel with more xorg expertise.  I'm very limited in the knowledge I can hand out in the room.  Usually if my first solution fails I got nothing.
2006-08-25T09:52:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	tried the dist-upgrade too?
2006-08-25T09:53:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	yeah :(
2006-08-25T09:53:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	upgrade, update, dist-upgrade
2006-08-25T09:53:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	when you type startx from a command line what happens
2006-08-25T09:53:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	are any errors listed by chance?
2006-08-25T09:54:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	what is startx - never did that one
2006-08-25T09:54:00.000Z	lampshade	hush	it is like the manual start xorg command instead of something like /etc/init.d/gdm start or other commands
2006-08-25T09:55:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	nope no errors, it lets me login at the normal login prompt.. and then it goes to a maroon colored background and never does anything.. i can move the mouse and all but nothing ever loads onto the screen except maroon :(
2006-08-25T09:56:00.000Z	hush	lampshade	does nothing*** not anything
