2007-03-30T12:40:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	router ports being blocked?
2007-03-30T12:41:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	RoundyT1	How to check ports?
2007-03-30T12:41:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	depends on router company
2007-03-30T12:41:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	and you'll need to know which ports they are OR you could make sure your router is setup for PnP which does the port stuff automatically
2007-03-30T12:42:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	RoundyT1	uf!how to check if torrent port is not blocked???
2007-03-30T12:43:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	normally you can just open a browser and type 192.168.1.1 and it will ask for a username and pass, that you will need to get from the manufacturer of the router, and if you set the usrnm and pass yourself you'll need to reset it (or use it if you know it)
2007-03-30T12:43:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	most the time its like username: admin pass : password
2007-03-30T12:44:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	RoundyT1	I have wireless AP and it is not router - only AP!
2007-03-30T12:44:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	oooo. ok. hmm...
2007-03-30T12:44:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	what kind of modem is used?
2007-03-30T12:45:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	RoundyT1	Planet WAP-4033 - wireless modem
2007-03-30T12:46:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	that should have a web-based interface....try that ip i gave you OR look it up on the manufac.'s website
2007-03-30T12:46:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	RoundyT1	my connection is like:  eth0-->Planet WAP-4033-->ISP
2007-03-30T12:47:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	RoundyT1	my ISP told me that this AP is not router and there is no need (and no way) to set up port fowarding
2007-03-30T12:47:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	hmm interesting .... then they must control the ports you use
2007-03-30T12:48:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	RoundyT1	don't think so... when Opera runs port test it sais that port 18xyx(can't remember) is ok
2007-03-30T12:49:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	contact them and ask them if PnP is enabled on your ap by default, and if so, then its definitely a tracker issue, lots of times depending on what you're downloading you can get errors,  on gnome my Bittorrent works just fine. Windows I use Utorrent, i am not sure if there's a Linux version though.
2007-03-30T12:51:00.000Z	RoundyT1	cyber_brain_mfkg	if you are having continual issues try different places/trackers bitjunkie.com, demonoid.com, mininova.com, thepiratebay.org
