2006-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	rgatin		you see, i am very new to Ubuntu
2006-12-27T11:51:00.000Z	rgatin		i don't know where to get it
2006-12-27T11:53:00.000Z	rgatin		do i need to download it or is it in the package already?
2006-12-27T11:54:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	it's in the CD too
2006-12-27T11:54:00.000Z	lemoniceblock		^^;;
2006-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	rgatin	lemoniceblock	ok, i already installed Ubuntu on my laptop. how do i find ndiswrapper
2006-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	do you have the CD?
2006-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	rgatin	lemoniceblock	yes, i do
2006-12-27T11:55:00.000Z	lemoniceblock		ok ehm, I think how I did it was
2006-12-27T11:56:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	I put the CD in and this message showed up asking if I wanted it to load packages or something
2006-12-27T11:57:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	click Yes, and it should load Synaptic Package Manager automatically
2006-12-27T11:57:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	and I think I typed ndiswrapper in the search bar and selected all the ndiswrapper components for d/l
2006-12-27T11:58:00.000Z	rgatin	lemoniceblock	i already have SPM installed, should i try to install the ndis... package from there?
2006-12-27T11:58:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	sry, I d/l'd ubuntu like only today so I don't know what SPM is >.<""
2006-12-27T11:59:00.000Z	rgatin	lemoniceblock	sorry, SPM stands fro Synaptic Package Manager
2006-12-27T11:59:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	np, when I put in the CD, and clicked 'yes' (or something to that effect when a message popped up) SPM loaded automatically
2006-12-27T12:00:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	and I found ndiswrapper through SPM, but I think you need to insert the CD just so SPM can find the ndiswrapper package?
2006-12-27T12:01:00.000Z	rgatin	lemoniceblock	can i let the SPM find and install the ndis... thru the internet
2006-12-27T12:01:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	I'm sure you can do that too
2006-12-27T12:02:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	actually ndiswrapper has its own site, just google ndiswrapper and you should find it
2006-12-27T12:02:00.000Z	lemoniceblock	rgatin	but learning how to use ndiswrapper is where I'm stuck right now >.<""
