2007-07-04T16:05:00.000Z	ushortcakeu		i've been trying to install k3b for about 6 hours now is there anyone here that may like to help please?
2007-07-04T16:06:00.000Z	ushortcakeu		i have pasted my sources txt and the error i get when trying to update apt-get
2007-07-04T16:06:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	sudo apt-get install k3b
2007-07-04T16:07:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	can we have the link of your pasted sources.list ?
2007-07-04T16:08:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	last line change ezy to breezy
2007-07-04T16:09:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	then do sudo apt-get update
2007-07-04T16:11:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	why ?
2007-07-04T16:11:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	not sure but breezy in afaIk no longer maintained
2007-07-04T16:12:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	yup exept for the ezy-security bit
2007-07-04T16:14:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	my suggestion is to download ubuntu-feisty
2007-07-04T16:16:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	the problem with breezy is that without maintenance the os is not secure anymore
2007-07-04T16:17:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	better to do a fresh install : you are 3 versions away from feisty
2007-07-04T16:17:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	yes
2007-07-04T16:18:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	breezy is outdated as I said earlyer
2007-07-04T16:19:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Download#xUbuntu
2007-07-04T16:20:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	I noticed,
2007-07-04T16:21:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	have a look here http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Users_Help_Users
2007-07-04T16:21:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	maybe you can get help there
2007-07-04T16:26:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28467/
2007-07-04T16:29:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	I think you should get another linuxdistro for xbox , breezy is too old
2007-07-04T16:37:00.000Z	defrysk	ushortcakeu	breezy is just not secure and unmaintained, sorry
