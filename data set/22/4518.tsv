2007-12-17T09:17:00.000Z	haymaker		ok, i installed ubuntu from a flash drive because i have no cdrom for this laptop.  now i need to make synaptic and apt work, cause they think it is a cdrom, so my source media /cdrom/ when it tries to install.  how can i tell it to use /disk/ or something
2007-12-17T09:18:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	you have a net connection for this machine? you need to disable the install media as a source in synaptic
2007-12-17T09:18:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	not until i can get ndiswrapper installed...
2007-12-30T21:51:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	the ones from pendrive linux?
2007-12-30T21:51:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	yep that one in particular
2007-12-30T21:52:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	no luck? it took me a couple of tries but finally worked
2007-12-30T21:52:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	i mean i did what it said, and it boots up to some prompt
2007-12-30T21:53:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	the only time i've been successful is when i used isotostick.sh, and that makes it bootable but not persistent.
2007-12-30T21:55:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	to do both at the same time? not sure what you are trying for; I've gotten the persistent thing going, why would you like a live usb--you mean something like dynebolic's nesting feature?
2007-12-30T21:56:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	i'm not familiar with the dynebolic.  what i'm after is a usb stick that will boot up and be a persistent environment, where my settings and installed programs stay put
2007-12-30T21:57:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	it would be nice to also have the installer on it because i get alot of "free" laptops, sometimes without cdrom drives
2007-12-30T21:59:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	this is the one i used http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/09/28/usb-ubuntu-710-gutsy-gibbon-install/
2007-12-30T21:59:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	maybe i'll just try again
2007-12-30T22:00:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	there is something about using a livecd and usb for the persistent effect here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence but nothing about just from the usb
2007-12-30T22:01:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	you've used this same article from pendrivelinux and it works for persistent?
2007-12-30T22:02:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	yeah, for the eeepc; it is really slow though to boot best to give it a bit of time
2007-12-30T22:03:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	does it show some prompt while its booting instead of the flash?
2007-12-30T22:03:00.000Z	haymaker	bazhang	s/flash/splash
2007-12-30T22:03:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	and getting the settings right can be a bit tough; it took me a couple of tries (and much frustration) before it worked
2007-12-30T22:04:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	you can also check the wiki at www.eeeuser.com ; they have details as well
2007-12-30T22:07:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	there is also a channel #eeepc :}
2009-10-17T06:55:00.000Z	bazhang	haymaker	some have complained recently with the karmic beta coming out
