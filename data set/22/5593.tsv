2007-04-15T05:22:00.000Z	gene6482		hey everyone, i'm trying to get my sound working, been trying all day with no luck, i'm using snd-hda-intel, and it appears like it should be working, but is not, i've tried everything i could find, via the forums, etc, please help
2007-04-15T05:22:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	if you launch alsamixer, everything looks alright?
2007-04-15T05:24:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	yes, everything appears in good order
2007-04-15T05:24:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	nothing muted?
2007-04-15T05:24:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	nope
2007-04-15T05:24:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	aplay /usr/share/sounds/login.wav
2007-04-15T05:26:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	 it says playing, and no errors, but no sound either
2007-04-15T05:27:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	you never got it to work?
2007-04-15T05:27:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	 I didn't know how to turn off acpi at boot
2007-04-15T05:28:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	maybe you should try it, what sound card model?
2007-04-15T05:28:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	intel 82801g
2007-04-15T05:31:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	no more ideas sorry, maybe worth to give that noacpi flag a test
2007-04-15T05:31:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	how do i do that?
2007-04-15T05:32:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	when in the bootloader, you can edit a configuration, and then a line, with e, and try appending noacpi to the kernel one
2007-04-15T05:32:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	ok i'll try it
2007-04-15T05:33:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	thanks
2007-04-15T05:33:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	another option, is disabling it in your BIOS
2007-04-15T08:26:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	you tried deactivating using the bios? not using kernel boot parameters
2007-04-15T08:27:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	if i deactivate acpi, it works, but apparently if i edit dsdt and recompile the kernel, acpi should work according to what i read
2007-04-15T08:41:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	nope, sorry
2007-04-15T08:42:00.000Z	Faugn	gene6482	patching the dtst is not really easy
2007-04-15T08:42:00.000Z	gene6482	Faugn	i've read that it's kind of tough, but wasn't sure if anyone had any ideas
