2011-01-15T23:31:00.000Z	Bilz		hi everyone. i have an ntfs partition that i want to mount at startup. I edited fstab and installed ntfs-3g http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=852842 as mentioned there. However, when i access my files via terminal they're highlighted funny and I don't want that. I want it to look normal. any help?!
2011-01-15T23:32:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	Which version of ubuntu are you using?
2011-01-15T23:32:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	a fresh install of maverick
2011-01-15T23:32:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	You shouldn't have installed anything additional then
2011-01-15T23:32:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	well, i didnt need to. i tried to
2011-01-15T23:32:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	it was already installed though
2011-01-15T23:33:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	Colored files indicate something about the file permissions or type
2011-01-15T23:34:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	when I mounted it like normal it was normal colours. ie sudo mount /media/parition /dev/sda7
2011-01-15T23:34:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	What if you try sudo umount /dev/sda7 && sudo mount -a
2011-01-15T23:35:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	thats how i mounted it after adding it in fstab
2011-01-15T23:35:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	What is the permissions of the directory you're mounting to?
2011-01-15T23:35:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	i dont really know about permissions. but i created the directory using sudo, and then mounted with sudo. so whatever the default permissions are then?
2011-01-15T23:36:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	I guess it should work fine then
2011-01-15T23:36:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	it works fine, but it just bugs me is all. seems weird too
2011-01-15T23:36:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	Look at the output of ls -l on the mount point when mounting both different ways
2011-01-15T23:38:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	both ways are now giving the same output
2011-01-15T23:38:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	Good or bad?
2011-01-15T23:38:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	bad
2011-01-15T23:38:00.000Z	soreau	Bilz	What is the highlight and text colors?
2011-01-15T23:38:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	green
2011-01-15T23:39:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	now its still highlighting like that with green after removing that from stab
2011-01-16T00:12:00.000Z	Bilz	soreau	seems that when i mounted an ext3 partition the highlighting is not there
