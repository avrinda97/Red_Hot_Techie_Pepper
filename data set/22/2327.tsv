2009-07-15T13:26:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	Hell of a nick you have there. What isn't working?
2009-07-15T13:26:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	What resolution are you going for?
2009-07-15T13:29:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	Please preface my name when you write back. Get's crowded in here. Okay, well you need to know what your monitor's max resolution is first.
2009-07-15T13:32:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	Are you running non-free video drivers? ie NVidia or ATI?
2009-07-15T13:33:00.000Z	L33tHaxor666	Shazburg	how would i tell
2009-07-15T13:35:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	Go to "System > Preferences > Display" What do you see?
2009-07-15T13:37:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	And it won't let you select the resolution you want, correct?
2009-07-15T13:38:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	Open Terminal, and type "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf". Copy the output and pastie it (http://pastie.org)
2009-07-15T13:41:00.000Z	L33tHaxor666	Shazburg	did u type-o
2009-07-15T13:42:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	"cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf" with an "f"
2009-07-15T13:43:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	"cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf" with an "f"
2009-07-15T13:44:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	Always.
2009-07-15T14:06:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	If that reconfig doesn't work, here is an xorg conf for you: http://pastie.org/546562
2009-07-15T14:08:00.000Z	L33tHaxor666	Shazburg	how would i put this into the xorg
2009-07-15T14:09:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	But from the looks of it, you are going to need a lot more help than we can provide. Linux isn't for the feint of heart. While Ubuntu does it's best to make the experience as safe and friendly as possible, you have the misfortune of using a somewhat unusual laptop for your first venture. Be ready to read alot and see if you can find a local LUG (Linux Users Group)
2009-07-15T14:10:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	You can use whatever editor you choose. gedit will likely be easiest. Run "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.orig". Then run "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and paste the new config in.
2009-07-15T14:11:00.000Z	Shazburg	L33tHaxor666	Your impatience and petulance is wearing. There is no regedit. Everything you know about Windows: chuck it.
2009-07-15T14:12:00.000Z	L33tHaxor666	Shazburg	dont worry, ill grow on you (like fugus)
