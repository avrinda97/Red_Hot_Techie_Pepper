2006-08-30T07:53:00.000Z	AndrukTatum		on my other computer, my eth0 card isnt working, does anybody know how to configure it?

2006-08-30T07:54:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	not without more information.  try ifconfig -a on the box, see if it shows up in the list
2006-08-30T07:55:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	ifconfig -a command not found
2006-08-30T07:55:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	try  /sbin/ifconfig -a
2006-08-30T07:56:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	sounds like networking isn't installed
2006-08-30T07:56:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	which would explain why the card doesn't show up.  although I'm curious about how you would know it doesn't show up if ifconfig isn't available
2006-08-30T07:58:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	im in gnome, and in the (sry, win...s term:) system tray in the upper right toolbar thing it has a networking monitor and it has a red x over it, and when i double click it, it tries to configure a ppp connection, and doesnt have an eth0 connection
2006-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	oh, and firefox doesnt do anything, not even my router
2006-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	that's odd, I'm not sure how you got there.  but if ifconfig doesn't exist on the machine, something went wrong with the installation.
2006-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	of course not, it has nowhere to send things to
2006-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	double check,  do:   find / -name ifconfig         make sure it doesn't exist anywhere on the box
2006-08-30T08:01:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	i t couldnt access a lot of directories, so im now sudo and did it, and it taking a long time
2006-08-30T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	it's normal for that to take several minutes,
2006-08-30T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	it's a slow check but also a definitive one
2006-08-30T08:04:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	Warning, hard link count is wrong for /proc: this may be a bug in your filesystem driver. automatically turning on find's -noleaf option. earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been searched
2006-08-30T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	you can ignore that, /proc is a pseudo file system
2006-08-30T08:06:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	k, no results
2006-08-30T08:10:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	any ideas?
2006-08-30T08:10:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	if it's a new installation, I would repeat the installation, as something is very wrong
2006-08-30T08:11:00.000Z	AndrukTatum	sethk	ive had this install for awhile, but i wouldnt mind reinstalling it.  ill get to it, thanks a million!
2006-08-30T12:45:00.000Z	sethk	AndrukTatum	the mount point must exist.  it's just a directory, create it with mkdir
