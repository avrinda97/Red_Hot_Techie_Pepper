2006-09-30T09:43:00.000Z	soheil		how to run an exe file?
2006-09-30T09:44:00.000Z	feross	soheil	with wine
2006-09-30T09:46:00.000Z	feross	soheil	using blitz?
2006-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	feross	soheil	the chess program you're trying to run.. blitz?
2006-09-30T09:53:00.000Z	feross	soheil	warrior doesn't work. I think blitz only connects to it's irc network but it's a good program and I've used it in the past in linux with wine.
2006-09-30T09:53:00.000Z	feross	soheil	did  you install warrior before trying to use it?
2006-09-30T09:55:00.000Z	feross	soheil	you need to run 'wine setupwarrior.exe' first.. then run the exe that installs under your ~./wine directory
2006-09-30T09:57:00.000Z	feross	soheil	you need to find the warrior installation file. then from the console execute it with wine.
2006-09-30T09:57:00.000Z	feross	soheil	you will see the installation as if you were running windows
2006-09-30T09:58:00.000Z	feross	soheil	the thing with wine is that it puts all of the fake windows installation under your home directory under the .wine/ directory
2006-09-30T10:01:00.000Z	feross	soheil	hmm did you run winecfg L
2006-09-30T10:03:00.000Z	feross	soheil	you should run winecfg first to make sure everything is configured correctly
2006-09-30T10:03:00.000Z	feross	soheil	do it under your own user not sudo winecfg or anything like that
2006-09-30T10:15:00.000Z	feross	soheil	hmm try ls -la
2006-09-30T10:17:00.000Z	feross	soheil	hmm, not sure, first time I see that..
2006-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	feross	soheil	try google
2006-09-30T10:21:00.000Z	feross	soheil	I'm not an Ubuntu developer. I'm just a regular guy that used linux for a couple of years so now I help out when I can and so is the rest of the people here.
