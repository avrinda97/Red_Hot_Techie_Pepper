2007-10-22T05:41:00.000Z	cwillu	crabgrass	yep, although I think they're disabled by default (I use them with dosemu)
2007-10-22T05:41:00.000Z	crabgrass	cwillu	disabled? how do i enable them?
2007-10-22T05:41:00.000Z	cwillu	crabgrass	I _think_ it's an option in /etc/defoma.d
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	cwillu	crabgrass	but bitmap fonts being ugly, they're disabled for general use by default
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	crabgrass	cwillu	uhh, do i nano that?
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	crabgrass	cwillu	well, i'm trying to use them in gimp. is THAT possible?
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	cwillu	crabgrass	probably best to google it
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	cwillu	crabgrass	dunno;  up to gimp I'd imagine
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	crabgrass	cwillu	well, i guess not then.
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	crabgrass	cwillu	shit.
2007-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	cwillu	crabgrass	if gimp is just using the available x fonts, then you'd need to look up the thing i mentioned
2007-10-22T05:43:00.000Z	crabgrass	cwillu	well, /etc/defoma.d doesn't exist.
2007-10-22T05:44:00.000Z	crabgrass	cwillu	i'm over it, though, thanks for the help anywau
