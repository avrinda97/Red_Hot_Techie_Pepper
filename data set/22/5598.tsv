2011-10-30T14:53:00.000Z	Afflicto		So anyone else have any ideas regarding laggy window-dragging @ 11.10 ?
2011-10-30T14:53:00.000Z	Afflicto		Is my name freenode?....
2011-10-30T14:54:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	yes
2011-10-30T14:54:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	there's lots of options besides unity. GNOME3, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, etc.
2011-10-30T14:55:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	all of those have their own ubuntu-tweaked versions that are pretty awesome. I used xfce (xubuntu)
2011-10-30T14:55:00.000Z	Afflicto		ok what is the default one that was before unity was implementeD?
2011-10-30T14:55:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	the default was gnome 2
2011-10-30T14:55:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	but gnome 2 is no longer maintained, for the most part. You might want to try gnome 3.
2011-10-30T14:56:00.000Z	Afflicto		ok, what about xfce? what's the difference? (I'm all about smooth, organized workflow and window management).
2011-10-30T14:56:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	they're just different in little ways. XFCE doesn't have a 3-part menu like gnome 2 did ('places' and such), it has a more start menu-type thing, etc.
2011-10-30T14:57:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	You can set it up to be almost exactly the same as gnome 2
2011-10-30T14:57:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		with small differences
2011-10-30T14:58:00.000Z	Afflicto		mmkaay. sudo command for that? :P
2011-10-30T14:58:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	I agree with dr_willis. Try out several.
2011-10-30T14:58:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	the... cleanest way to try them out is to install ubuntu on a virtual machine (virtualbox), but playing with your main installation is also an option :)
2011-10-30T14:58:00.000Z	Afflicto	skpl	sudo apt-get install gnome-shell? :P
2011-10-30T14:59:00.000Z	Afflicto		awesomeness guys, gonna try gnome-shell. this will install Gnome 3 or whatever, right?
2011-10-30T14:59:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	pretty much
2011-10-30T14:59:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	unity is built on top of most of gnome 3. Gnome shell is the bit that unity replaces.
2011-10-30T15:00:00.000Z	Afflicto		So I already have gnome3? o.O
2011-10-30T15:00:00.000Z	Afflicto		I just did terminal command and it didn't say I already have it.. if it ever says that though.
2011-10-30T15:00:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Afflicto	Just as a warning, people who like gnome 2 often say they prefer xfce to unity/gnome3 shell. I recommend trying everything :)
