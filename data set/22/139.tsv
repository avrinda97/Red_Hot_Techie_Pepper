2012-05-28T00:32:00.000Z	TPB_se		How do I add a custom resolution to the nvidia settings app in Ubuntu/
2012-05-28T00:34:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	'nvidia-settings'?
2012-05-28T00:34:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	I guess. the x server settings up.
2012-05-28T00:36:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	Yeah, it is.
2012-05-28T00:37:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	there's a select/drop down for resolution there somewhere
2012-05-28T00:38:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	There is, but there is no resolution I want :/
2012-05-28T00:38:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	which do you want?
2012-05-28T00:38:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	1440x1024.
2012-05-28T00:39:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	does it show up in the output of 'xrandr'?
2012-05-28T00:39:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	let me check.
2012-05-28T00:40:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	No.
2012-05-28T00:40:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	you could try explicitly listing it in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-05-28T00:41:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	I believe I already did that.
2012-05-28T00:42:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	Is it normal for it to say : # Removed Option "metamodes" "1440x900 +0+0"
2012-05-28T00:43:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	probably, if it hates it :p
2012-05-28T00:44:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	Is that not supposed to be there?
2012-05-28T00:47:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	I mean, what do I do now?
2012-05-28T00:48:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	what'd you add to xorg.conf?
2012-05-28T00:48:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	I had previously added a few custom 'modes' below     SubSection     "Display"
2012-05-28T00:49:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	mmm I forget the syntax, but the package should've come with some documentation in .html files which would explain it
2012-05-28T00:50:00.000Z	TPB_se	reisio	I didn't find any.
2012-05-28T00:50:00.000Z	reisio	TPB_se	well ask the channel how to find them
