2005-04-16T15:13:00.000Z	holycow		i'm upgrading and another image seems to be downloading
2005-04-16T15:13:00.000Z	holycow		this is going to be hard on my nvidia drivers
2005-04-16T15:13:00.000Z	holycow		:)
2005-04-16T15:14:00.000Z	holycow		does sid kernel change that often?
2005-04-16T15:15:00.000Z	holycow		thanks
2005-04-16T15:15:00.000Z	holycow		with a few tiny/semi tiny changes
2005-04-16T15:15:00.000Z	holycow		some desktop settings like removing all icons from deskto pwhich i like
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	holycow		what i don't like is that they eneabled everything for sudo
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	holycow		that means all you gotta do is trick a noob to run a bad bash script and his machine is yours
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	caffinated	holycow	i think that's logical.
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	holycow		we need to do something about that
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	caffinated		sudo is better than using root all the time.
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	holycow		i only enable sudo for a few things i know very well
2005-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	holycow		not EVERYTHING
2005-04-16T15:17:00.000Z	holycow	caffinated	i understand why they did it and its fine
2005-04-16T15:17:00.000Z	caffinated	holycow	besides, it's not like you can't get to your root account if you *really* need it.
2005-04-16T15:17:00.000Z	holycow		maybe we need a policy editor with maybe som presets
2005-04-16T15:18:00.000Z	holycow	caffinated	true, i don't want to flame about this today anyway, i will try to help out with some constructive way down the road
2005-04-16T15:18:00.000Z	caffinated	holycow	oh, i don't really see it as a flame.
2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	holycow		k. :) just makin sure, you guys are too nice, i don't wanna pollute the chan accidentally even
2005-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	caffinated	holycow	people are bound to disagree on some elements of how the OS is set up.  It doesn't make you wrong, pre-se.
