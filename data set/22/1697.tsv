2010-04-16T07:58:00.000Z	Gla		hey guys, curious what you guys think of http://tap.info
2010-04-16T07:59:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	as in "chat"?
2010-04-16T07:59:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	or "IRC"?
2010-04-16T08:04:00.000Z	Gla	SvenG	yea
2010-04-16T08:05:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	gimme three reasons why tap.info is better than IRC!
2010-04-16T08:07:00.000Z	Gla	SvenG	scaleable, easiley accessable, it's name is tap
2010-04-16T08:07:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	so is irc.  try again!

2010-04-16T08:09:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	so your point is that channels can be too noisy?  why - certainly.  but you can create other channels just be joining them.  so - what was your point again?
2010-04-16T08:10:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	dont see why.  maybe you can explain...
2010-04-16T08:10:00.000Z	Gla	SvenG	first off, you don't get all the users on IRC
2010-04-16T08:11:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	you never get "all" of them... no matter what protocol
2010-04-16T08:11:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	not *yet*
2010-04-16T08:11:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	and you think you can get *all* of them with tap.info?  good luck!
2010-04-16T08:12:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	more thAn?
2010-04-16T08:12:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	proof?
2010-04-16T08:12:00.000Z	Gla	SvenG	have this conversation on tap, not here, it's to noisy ;)
2010-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	 ah - that's how you get them!
2010-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	"we'll tell you when you're *there*!"
2010-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	Gla	SvenG	I'm going to get some dinner, try it out though
2010-04-16T08:14:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	naah.  been trying out so much... kept getting back to irc. ;)
2010-04-16T08:14:00.000Z	SvenG	Gla	after all, i've been using it for 20+ years now
