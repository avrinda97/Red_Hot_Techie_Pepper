2008-02-24T13:25:00.000Z	HinHin	rhineheart_m	do you run a firewall?
2008-02-24T13:26:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	m using the routers firewall..
2008-02-24T13:26:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	where will i do that? in ssh console?
2008-02-24T13:28:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	what do you think is the problem?
2008-02-24T13:28:00.000Z	HinHin	rhineheart_m	DNS resolution is working
2008-02-24T13:28:00.000Z	HinHin	rhineheart_m	type this into your browser
2008-02-24T13:29:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	m working from a remote.. I can only access the box thru ssh
2008-02-24T13:30:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	so...how's it? can you help me with it?
2008-02-24T13:31:00.000Z	HinHin	rhineheart_m	how did you try to access www.yahoo.com then?
2008-02-24T13:31:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	thru putty
2008-02-24T13:31:00.000Z	HinHin	rhineheart_m	via X11forwarding right?
2008-02-24T13:32:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	I know how to ping.. if I will ping 209.131.36.158 it will respond.. no timed out... I don't use GUI
2008-02-24T13:32:00.000Z	HinHin	rhineheart_m	ah
2008-02-24T13:32:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	really?
2008-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	m sure it doesn't block port 80. I have PCs in the LAN and I can browse wherever I like. and I have already the website up...so...how could the router block port 80 then?
2008-02-24T13:37:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	any update?
2008-02-24T13:39:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	it doesn't block. I can access the webpages of my website hosted there..
2008-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	here in our place..our ISP doesn't block any port.. I just asked them
2008-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	HinHin	rhineheart_m	the thing is you can resolve the DNS name, a DNS name is like www.google.com
2008-02-24T13:42:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	thats the problem actually.. the box will tell me everytime I restart the apache and it can't find reliable DNS....something like that..
2008-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	HinHin	okay...I will update you about the router's settings... a minute..
