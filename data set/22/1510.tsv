2010-05-01T01:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 theres proberly forum threads/wiki pages on usplash.
2010-05-01T01:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 10.04 totally dumped usplash. so its proberly not worth   spending a lot of time n leraning
2010-05-01T01:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 i normally just disable the annoying thing.
2010-06-05T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 I think it can be done. but watch out for  Upgrading to the next release.
2010-06-05T14:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 personally i wouldent use Wubi at all
2010-06-05T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 windows couldent shrink its self? odd...  theres alterantives to gparted.. and you could of used virtualbox..
2010-06-05T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 i hopd your wubi setup dosent just self destruct some day like i see many people in here have happen.
2010-06-05T14:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 i always defrag/scandisk befor i resize. never seen the issue.
2010-06-05T14:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 im all 10.04 on all my machines now.   I alwyas keep up with the latest releases
2010-06-05T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 and i see peopme in here Constantly with their wubi issues...
2010-06-05T14:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 yes. i would say you are one of the very very very very few
2010-07-03T13:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 theres always #linux channel
2010-07-03T13:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 i find most ubuntu variants are not really worth messing with. :)
2010-07-03T13:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 Hmm? #linux channel is here on freenode..
2010-09-04T14:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 when in doubt try installing them from the command line.  I tried Joulicloud and dident see the point.. :)
2010-09-04T14:51:00.000Z	lindsaymobil22	Dr_Willis	but apps like spotify cant be installed natively through apt-get
2010-09-04T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lindsaymobil22	 we cant help with jolicloud hacks like that. so thats about where you are stuck.
