2008-08-19T18:10:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Once i booted it up today, it comes up saying no /home
2008-08-19T18:10:00.000Z	robelliott2125		It had froze last night
2008-08-19T18:10:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Nothing was responding, no mouse, no keyboard.
2008-08-19T18:11:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	wait ... i had this problem too.
2008-08-19T18:11:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	let me find your answer, it could take a minute.
2008-08-19T18:11:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Thanks dmizer, i'm on the forums as well and its just slow responses.
2008-08-19T18:11:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	link your thread please.

2008-08-19T18:13:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	look for my reply there.
2008-08-19T18:13:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Just checking now dmizer
2008-08-19T18:14:00.000Z	robelliott2125	dmizer	coffeecat was the last poster
2008-08-19T18:22:00.000Z	robelliott2125	dmizer	i think i'm just going to do a clean reinstall, but going for Hardy directly, rather than going for gutsy
2008-08-19T18:22:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	unfortunately ... it looks like that's your best option.
2008-08-19T18:22:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Yeah, probably the easiest...  I just hope that I haven't lost my /home files :(
2008-08-19T18:23:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	are they on a separate partition?
2008-08-19T18:23:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Yes dmizer...
2008-08-19T18:23:00.000Z	robelliott2125		I'm just wondering if i should try Kubuntu instead of Ubuntu.
2008-08-19T18:23:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	then you shouldn't lose any data as long as you don't overwrite the /home partition.
2008-08-19T18:24:00.000Z	robelliott2125		I'm not planning on it dmizer, just annoyed i shutdown.  Its one of those petty things which turns out to be worse afterwards
2008-08-19T18:24:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Anyway, thank you for your help dmizer
2008-08-19T18:24:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	no problem, better luck next time.
2008-08-19T18:25:00.000Z	dmizer	robelliott2125	here's a good howto for restoring your home partition http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
