2007-08-20T10:20:00.000Z	abbylee		Hi.  I accidentally filled up my harddrive when I was downloading some files unattended - now gdm won't let me log in and I can't seem to access those files to delete/move them with a LiveCD.  Does anyone have any ideas?
2007-08-20T10:21:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 sudo rm -f  /path/tofiles
2007-08-20T10:22:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	so no chance of backing them up?
2007-08-20T10:22:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 I thought you wanted to revome them ?
2007-08-20T10:22:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 where do you want to put them ?
2007-08-20T10:23:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	I have another harddrive in my comp - it's the one I meant to download the files to.
2007-08-20T10:23:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 can you mount both hdd ?
2007-08-20T10:23:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	but at the moment I can't even *see* the files - I'm getting errors.  Which i probably should have said.
2007-08-20T10:23:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 yes you should have
2007-08-20T10:24:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	can you access the partition in question ?
2007-08-20T10:24:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	yeah, the hdds are mounted, but the particular directory isn't accessible since it's under /home I'm guessing.
2007-08-20T10:24:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 that shouldn' be an issie
2007-08-20T10:24:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 what did you download with
2007-08-20T10:25:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	They were torrented files.
2007-08-20T10:25:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	do you know where yoru client stores partial torrent files ?
2007-08-20T10:25:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	no, but I can check to see if I can figure it out.  brb.  (I was using ktorrent, if that helps.)
2007-08-20T10:25:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 are they completely downloaded or partialy
2007-08-20T10:26:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 I don't know where ktorrent stores it's partital but if you can figure that out you're half way there
2007-08-20T10:26:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	I'm pretty sure that most of them were fully, even the last one - but the last one might have been partially.
2007-08-20T10:27:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	can you try moving other files ? jsut to make somespace so you can boot back ?
2007-08-20T10:33:00.000Z	abbylee	Pelo	it is totally working now.  Thank you for your help and patience.
2007-08-20T10:34:00.000Z	Pelo	abbylee	 no problem
