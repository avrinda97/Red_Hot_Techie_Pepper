2011-01-26T02:03:00.000Z	lazz		I'm having trouble with rhythmbox.  I can't get it to play songs but all other sounds are working just fine.  Any suggestions?
2011-01-26T02:03:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	use mplayer or vlc :)
2011-01-26T02:03:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	I want to use rhythmbox
2011-01-26T02:04:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	if you play the file from a different player and/or look at the debug output it might give you some hints
2011-01-26T02:05:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	How do you do that
2011-01-26T02:06:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	run it from the CLI with a verbose option if it's not a menu option (it is in vlc)
2011-01-26T02:06:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	What
2011-01-26T02:07:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	do you know what a CLI/bash/terminal is?
2011-01-26T02:07:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	I know what the terminal is.
2011-01-26T02:10:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	sorry missed your answer
2011-01-26T02:10:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	Yes I know what the terminal is
2011-01-26T02:13:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	What do I need to do?
2011-01-26T02:15:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	so if you run the application from terminal you can get more information
2011-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	How do you do that?
2011-01-26T02:17:00.000Z	Dmole		you can type "man rhythmbox" to read the options (hit q to exit)
2011-01-26T02:17:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	you can type "man rhythmbox" to read the options (hit q to exit)
2011-01-26T02:18:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	"rhythmbox -d" should stat the app then try playing the file that fails, then put the output in a paste bin
2011-01-26T02:23:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	Ok it gave me a bunch of stuff I don't understand.  I did happen to find a few things where it said critical.
2011-01-26T02:24:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	put it all here: http://pastebin.com/ and tell me the link
2011-01-26T02:26:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	 Do you want all of it or just the parts that read failed after them?
2011-01-26T02:29:00.000Z	lazz	Dmole	Here's the link http://pastebin.com/MEciM3VC
2011-01-26T02:45:00.000Z	Dmole	lazz	and I'm back I'll read the paste now...
