2012-09-12T09:23:00.000Z	rolio	wilee-nilee	let me try
2012-09-12T09:24:00.000Z	rolio	wilee-nilee	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 mount: can't find /dev/sda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2012-09-12T09:25:00.000Z	rolio	wilee-nilee	 can't mount /dev/sda1
2012-09-12T09:27:00.000Z	rolio	wilee-nilee	 what should i need to type in terminal ?
2012-09-12T09:30:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	rolio	this is the first command sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
2012-09-12T09:31:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	rolio	open the terminal and use commands there, the pastebin I gave you was missing the /mnt at the end by accident
2012-09-12T09:31:00.000Z	rolio	wilee-nilee	 sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda   <--------------- /sdaX what is X
2012-09-12T09:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	rolio	the one line was an example the X=a the hd
