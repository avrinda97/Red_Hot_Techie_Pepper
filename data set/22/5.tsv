2004-09-14T05:23:00.000Z	Clint	mdz	if you can get a hold of the logs, there's stuff from mark0 about his inability to install amd64
2004-09-14T05:24:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	I'll check fabbione's log, thanks
2004-09-14T05:25:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	sounds like he had the same problem I did
2004-09-14T08:44:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	ew, why?
2004-09-14T08:44:00.000Z	Clint	mdz	compatibility and sanity?
2004-09-14T08:46:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	a feature-overloaded ifconfig wouldn't be compatible with anything else anyway
2004-09-14T08:47:00.000Z	Clint	mdz	I hear a lot of whining from FreeBSD users
2004-09-14T08:47:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	yeah, I hear a lot of whining from FreeBSD users, too.  I tend to tune it out :-P
2004-09-14T08:48:00.000Z	Clint	mdz	I find the fact that I can add extra IP addresses and change duplex a plus
2004-09-14T08:51:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	ooh!
2004-09-14T08:54:00.000Z	Clint	mdz	needed how?
2004-09-14T08:55:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	in that when X autoconfigures a synaptics device in XF86Config, it points at psaux
2004-09-14T08:56:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	with Driver "synaptics"?
2004-09-19T16:40:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	you just have to set it after you open the terminal
2004-09-22T05:33:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	dan jacobson repeatedly fucks with the severity after somebody fixes it, though
2004-09-23T14:12:00.000Z	Clint	mdz	oh, then revise to "why . instead of -?"
2004-09-23T14:10:00.000Z	Clint	mdz	why not grep for the actual string?
2004-09-23T14:11:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	which actual string?
2004-09-23T14:11:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	we only want to load snd-foo-oss if snd-foo is loaded
2004-09-23T14:12:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	it's either . or [_-] 
2004-09-23T14:14:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	2.4 vs. 2.6
2004-09-25T05:37:00.000Z	mdz	Clint	around?
