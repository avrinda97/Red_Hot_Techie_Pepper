2011-07-17T13:42:00.000Z	jll		can someone at least tell me hello, wait or something?
2011-07-17T13:42:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	what version of firefox are you using ?
2011-07-17T13:45:00.000Z	jll	glebihan	I'm using firefox 3.6.18
2011-07-17T13:45:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	I would first suggest to upgrade firefox to a more recent version
2011-07-17T13:47:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	yes you can do that with synaptic
2011-07-17T13:48:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	in a terminal, you would have to type "sudo apt-get update  && sudo apt-get install firefox"
2011-07-17T13:49:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	which release of Ubuntu are you using ?
2011-07-17T13:49:00.000Z	jll	glebihan	I put that in the terminal (copy and paste) and it's doing something.
2011-07-17T13:51:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	ok but which release of Ubuntu are you running ? maybe the latest versions of firefox are not in the repositories for your release ?
2011-07-17T13:52:00.000Z	jll	glebihan	I'm using 10.10 and I'm downloading firefox 5 right now to see if I can install it.
2011-07-17T13:52:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	ok
2011-07-17T13:54:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	what do you mean by "it's not installing" ? what error do you get ?
2011-07-17T13:55:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	you should be able to open the deb file with the package manager
2011-07-17T13:55:00.000Z	jll	glebihan	I just downloaded the newest firefox and it's a firefox-5.0.1.tar.bz2
2011-07-17T13:56:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	oh you should have downloaded the deb file not the tar.bz2
2011-07-17T13:57:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	oh there doesn't seem to be a deb package for firefox 5
2011-07-17T13:58:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	the easier way to install would be to follow instructions on this page : http://www.webupd8.org/2011/06/firefox-5-lands-in-firefox-stable-ppa.html
2011-07-17T14:03:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	should work fine, let me know if you have any issue though
2011-07-17T14:04:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	you're welcome
2011-07-17T14:09:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	could you paste the link to the page when the problem occurs ?
2011-07-17T14:12:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	have you checked that you're really running firefox 5 now
2011-07-17T14:17:00.000Z	glebihan	jll	go to "Tools"->"Clear recent history", then check cache and cookies
