2007-06-15T16:21:00.000Z	Ashur	rob_p	how do i check that it's booting from the right device
2007-06-15T16:22:00.000Z	rob_p	Ashur	Do you have another bootable CD to try?
2007-06-15T16:22:00.000Z	rob_p	Ashur	I suspect you corrupted the one you have.
2007-06-15T16:24:00.000Z	Ashur	rob_p	would i have done it when i deleted the thunderbird folder?
2007-06-15T16:25:00.000Z	rob_p	Ashur	Perhaps... I don't know what you did, but it sounds likely.
2007-06-15T16:25:00.000Z	Ashur	rob_p	i unzipped the iso and simply deleted the thunderbird folder
2007-06-15T16:26:00.000Z	rob_p	Ashur	The iso will fit on a standard CD.  No need to go deleting things.

2007-06-15T16:28:00.000Z	rob_p	Ashur	That's odd!  I haven't heard of such a problem.  The iso image should fit nicely on a CD though.
2007-06-15T16:29:00.000Z	Ashur	rob_p	should i try downloading it again?
2007-06-15T16:30:00.000Z	rob_p	Ashur	That would be my recommendation.
2007-06-15T16:30:00.000Z	Ashur	rob_p	it says it's downloading a 696.2 mb file
2007-06-15T16:32:00.000Z	rob_p	Ashur	Odd.  Not sure what to tell you.
