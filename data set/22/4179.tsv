2008-02-29T18:48:00.000Z	Blice		Does anyone here have experience joining a windows domain?
2008-02-29T18:50:00.000Z	Blice		Because I've been trying to join this windows domain for the past couple of days, and to make matters worse, I can't use my root password anymore...
2008-02-29T18:50:00.000Z	Blice		Yeah, bazhang.
2008-02-29T18:52:00.000Z	Blice		Meh, I don't need the shared folders. I just need to be a part of the local domain here.
2008-02-29T18:52:00.000Z	Blice		And I don't know how I messed up my root password with this
