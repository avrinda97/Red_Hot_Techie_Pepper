2007-04-25T05:32:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	what's the issue?
2007-04-25T05:32:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	wireless not working after upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 but gonna read that thread wongy just pointed me to and see if that helps...
2007-04-25T05:34:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	using ndiswrapper?
2007-04-25T05:34:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	I think I was using that before yes
2007-04-25T05:35:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	recently got my broadcom up and running after finding out ndiswrapper packaged with feisty could cause problems: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/85468
2007-04-25T05:35:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	is that the symptom you're experienceing?
2007-04-25T05:36:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	not exactly, but similar
2007-04-25T05:38:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	ok, well go for wongy's first then i suppose.
2007-04-25T05:38:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	wireless card was kinda working after upgrade (i.e. wifi light was on) but now light not on anymore. Have never managed to connnect with feisty yet, although seem to remember having to do some ndswrapper stuff to get edgy working before, and during upgrade it asked if I wanted to replace a blacklist file which I did replace coz I had no idea what it was
2007-04-25T05:39:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	it's possible that when the blacklist file got overwritten, it's going for the native bcm43xx driver which may not work with your card.
2007-04-25T05:40:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	I think you're probably right. I just did dmesg and it says "bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed."
2007-04-25T05:42:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	yes, it's trying to use that.  if you used ndiswrapper in edgy, you'll probably have to do those steps again again.
2007-04-25T05:43:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	sigh, I wish I could remember the steps I took or where I found them!
2007-04-25T05:44:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	i can try and walk you through if you like
2007-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	that would be most kind :)
2007-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	do you have the windows driver?
2007-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	i.e. the .inf and .sys file?
2007-04-25T05:46:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	no idea, but hang on, I think http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297092 might be what I did before
2007-04-25T05:46:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	that page looks familiar so I'll follow that again and see what happens...
2007-04-25T05:47:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	sure
2007-04-25T06:07:00.000Z	qopi	orbin	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297092 sorted me out :) thanks anyway for your help :)
2007-04-25T06:08:00.000Z	orbin	qopi	no sweat. glad you got it sorted.
