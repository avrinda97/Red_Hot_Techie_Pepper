2009-04-07T06:51:00.000Z	ryan_		Does anyone have any ideas why my GRUB never auto loads the default? it just sits there until I press esc and select one
2009-04-07T06:52:00.000Z	ryan_		One sec santiago
2009-04-07T06:52:00.000Z	ryan_		I'm trying to find the right app
2009-04-07T06:53:00.000Z	ryan_		Santiago, in terminal type sudo -get install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-04-07T06:53:00.000Z	ryan_		sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-04-07T06:53:00.000Z	ryan_		I swear I typed apt >.> lol
2009-04-07T06:55:00.000Z	ryan_		Anyone know why my GRUB never auto boots? It just sits saying Loading default in 2 (or however it says it) I have to press esc and select the kernal
2009-04-07T06:55:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	it doesnt actually count down?
2009-04-07T06:59:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	that's really weird, no idea actually
2009-04-07T06:59:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	can you pastebin /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2009-04-07T07:04:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	what if you dont use hiddenmenu?
2009-04-07T07:04:00.000Z	ryan_	clearscreen	Um... do what? -D
2009-04-07T07:05:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	put a # in front of 'hiddenmenu' :P
2009-04-07T07:06:00.000Z	ryan_	clearscreen	Do I need to like... sudo gedit menu.lst?
2009-04-07T07:06:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	yes
2009-04-07T07:07:00.000Z	ryan_	clearscreen	If I put a # in front of that, won't it just get rid of the countdown all together?
2009-04-07T07:08:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	nah, the countdown will stick, it just wont hide the boot menu
2009-04-07T07:08:00.000Z	ryan_	clearscreen	Alright, rebooting, brb
2009-04-07T07:13:00.000Z	ryan_	clearscreen	Now it just shows the kernal selector, along the bottom it says the highlited option will be booted in 3 seconds, but never counts down
2009-04-07T07:14:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	that's.... weird
2009-04-07T07:15:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	there is a bug submission for this on launchpad though: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub/+bug/288365
2009-04-07T07:16:00.000Z	clearscreen	ryan_	apparently, someone fixed it by replacing the battery on their motherboard... it could be the cause of your problem, I am not certain
