2007-12-27T01:56:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	you should be able to select windows xp from the grub menu
2007-12-27T01:57:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	basicaly,  the ubuntu installer rewrites the mbr to point to the grub menu
2007-12-27T01:57:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	are you getting an error msg ?
2007-12-27T01:57:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	hold on
2007-12-27T01:57:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	pastebin your  /boot/grub/menu.lst  file so I can have a look
2007-12-27T01:58:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	ahhh
2007-12-27T01:58:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	dl the supergrub cd and us it to fix your windows mbr
2007-12-27T01:58:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org/
2007-12-27T01:59:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	 it is very reliable but the menu structure is a bit confusing in my opinion
2007-12-27T02:00:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	personnaly , I have boot xp and ubunt on a seperete hdd,  I made sure that the ubuntu hdd was set to boot from the bios when i installed ubuntu,  that wayeach mbr is sepreate
2007-12-27T02:00:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	somehow he got grub stage one installed on both hdd
2007-12-27T02:00:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	very odd
2007-12-27T02:01:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	in anycase you'll be able to fix this using the supergrub cd
2007-12-27T02:02:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	I don'T think that would be related
2007-12-27T02:03:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	that's all I can tell you since you can'T show me your menu.lst file or the fstab atm
2008-03-13T03:58:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	try doing a search on your hardware in the forum,  there aer probabaly diagnostic tools listed in there www.ubuntuforums.org
2008-04-22T05:01:00.000Z	Pelo	sYn_0n3	this is a channel for the support of the current release of ubuntu ,  you might not get ppl who know about cvs of third party apps,  try finding an enlightenemetn chanel
