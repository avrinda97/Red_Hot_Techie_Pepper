2007-06-02T08:06:00.000Z	Gasten		Argh!! All my programs chrashes whrn I try to boot them!
2007-06-02T08:06:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	run them in a terminal/console to see if they print error messages you could use to pinpoint the problem.
2007-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	I cant even opena xterm!!
2007-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	trying another tty
2007-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	yes
2007-06-02T08:09:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	seems nomal in the tty..
2007-06-02T08:10:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	but it stil deoasn't work in the gui...
2007-06-02T08:11:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	I'll try a reboot.
2007-06-02T08:11:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	does dmesg, or /var/log/syslog or /var/log/xlog (or what it is called) report anything unusual?
2007-06-02T08:13:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	nothing in dmesg, and either syslog and xlog doesn't exist.
2007-06-02T08:14:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	hm weird, well if you changed nothing try to restart X or so with "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart".
2007-06-02T08:14:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	ok
2007-06-02T08:14:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	this will bring down your irc client or course
2007-06-02T08:14:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	yes.
2007-06-02T08:14:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	Will alt+ctr+bckspace work aswell?
2007-06-02T08:15:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	it is not recommended, I think the other method respects lock files more and so on.
2007-06-02T08:15:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	ok.
2007-06-02T08:18:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	it seems to work now. thanks!
2007-06-02T08:19:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	ok, nice. but still weird.
2007-06-02T08:20:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	Yes. Never happened before. I haven't even been messing with my configs lately. and the computer have worked fine the past 6 hours :/
2007-06-02T08:21:00.000Z	predaeus	Gasten	hm yes. nice thing with linux is that you can just restart the X server instead of rebooting the whole machine.
2007-06-02T08:22:00.000Z	Gasten	predaeus	Yes. saves time :)
