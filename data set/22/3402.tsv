2009-10-05T09:17:00.000Z	undeclaredx		Hey, is it me or is firefox-3.5 weirdly branded with a different name, and doesn't overwrite the original firefox?
2009-10-05T09:17:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	so it is
2009-10-05T10:49:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	not without formating
2009-10-05T10:50:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	if I got the DVD would it just work without asking?
2009-10-05T10:50:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	encrytion ?
2009-10-05T10:51:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	use alternate installer
2009-10-05T10:52:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	that was the minimal installer then, alterante doesn't require inet and cd is good, too
2009-10-05T10:52:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	it was a 715 mb installer
2009-10-05T10:53:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	if it was th e alternate, can easy do this, else expert-mode works, too, but more hassle
2009-10-05T10:54:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	I'm just going to assume for some reason the universal linux to USB key thing screwed it up and installed minimal from the alternate ISO
2009-10-05T10:55:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	nah, but you have to tell gparted how to handle the disk
2009-10-05T10:55:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	I used the windows/linux universal boot creator I forget the name.. used it in windows
2009-10-05T10:56:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	easiest way use alternate cd , but usb from that should also work
2009-10-05T10:57:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	I did but it didn't work properly..
2009-10-05T10:58:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	anyway, I'm going to do a proper reinstall on wed probably..  Glad to know that alternate itself isn't bad though.
2009-10-05T10:58:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	which app do you recommend for this (I'm in ubuntu now)?
2009-10-05T10:59:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	this is vague..
2009-10-05T10:59:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	er, unetbootin or usb-creator I guess?
2009-10-05T10:59:00.000Z	DasEi	undeclaredx	usb-creator does fine, but why not use the cd itself ?
2009-10-05T11:00:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	defective dvd drive on my laptop
2009-10-05T11:01:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	yeah if my dvd drive was fine I would have burned alternate and be done already
2009-10-05T11:06:00.000Z	undeclaredx	DasEi	unetbootin is pretty impressive I find..
