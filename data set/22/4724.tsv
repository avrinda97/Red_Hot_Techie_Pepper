2007-11-01T06:41:00.000Z	CubeXombi		is anyone good with half-working wireless? drivers are installed and "apear" to be working correctly, heck last night i was able to surf. today.. nothing

2007-11-01T06:44:00.000Z	RandomUsr		I´m apparently having some issues after running updates
2007-11-01T06:46:00.000Z	RandomUsr	CubeXombi	Run ¨lspci¨  from the shell without the quotes and post to pastebin.org
2007-11-01T06:47:00.000Z	CubeXombi	RandomUsr	i can do one better .. gimme a sec
2007-11-01T06:47:00.000Z	RandomUsr		ok, but if you past here only post the line with the wireless card

2007-11-01T06:50:00.000Z	CubeXombi		<alesan>Device Manager, just scroll to your usb and it should have a tree view of any connections
2007-11-01T06:50:00.000Z	RandomUsr	CubeXombi	you may want to try Madwifi
2007-11-01T06:51:00.000Z	CubeXombi		<alesan>good question, (gnome user)
2007-11-01T06:52:00.000Z	CubeXombi		<RandomUsr>Yeah i was looking at that.. I'm not sure why it's not working. you could see that it "should" though, and I'm not crazy right?
2007-11-01T06:53:00.000Z	RandomUsr	CubeXombi	not necessarily Further, I would try to name a network with iwconfig and set the channel to something consistent
2007-11-01T06:54:00.000Z	RandomUsr	CubeXombi	remember that Ndiswrapper simply provides a Fake Set of WIN32 APIś for the driver to work then describes that functionality to linux
2007-11-01T06:55:00.000Z	CubeXombi		<RandomUsr>yeah, it's just that others got it working in edgy/fiesty but i can't find working reports form gutsy
2007-11-01T06:55:00.000Z	RandomUsr	CubeXombi	itś a new OS
2007-11-01T06:56:00.000Z	CubeXombi	RandomUsr	I cut myself on the bleeding edge
2007-11-01T06:56:00.000Z	RandomUsr	CubeXombi	you may want to man iwconfig to view and change options in your cardś configuration and check defaults on your router
