2005-01-29T11:01:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	you will need to apt-get install xorg-common ...
2005-01-29T11:02:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	either that or xserver-xorg
2005-01-29T11:02:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	the deps don't want to take usually when dist-upgrading for whatever reason...

2005-02-10T12:53:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	GNOME folks don't seem to care much about Smb... always had issues via nautilus etc...
2005-02-10T12:56:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	thats not really what he asked... bah
2005-02-10T13:08:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	eh... just needs portmap, nfslock, and nfsserver loaded... (on both) ... and an entry in /etc/exports like: '/path/to/share * (perm_such_as_ro)'
2005-02-10T13:09:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	'mount -t nfs -o soft IP:/path/you/shared /where/to/mount
2005-02-10T13:10:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	can put an entry in fstab too... IP:/path/to/share /where/to/mount nfs defaults,soft 0 0
2005-02-10T13:11:00.000Z	trey3	Scooter	soft = terminate if source in unreachable... hard = crash my system please.
