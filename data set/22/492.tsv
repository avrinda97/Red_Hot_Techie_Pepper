2012-07-21T03:57:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		start a terminal?
2012-07-21T03:58:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		yeah man i've tried apt-get install flashplugin-installer flashplugin-nonfree, tried ubuntu software center and so on
2012-07-21T03:59:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		i did that dude
2012-07-21T03:59:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		flashplugin-installer is already the newest version. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2012-07-21T03:59:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		yes sir
2012-07-21T03:59:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		lts
2012-07-21T04:01:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		Package adobe-flashplugin is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2012-07-21T04:01:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	usr13 need to enable partner to get adobe-flashplugin
2012-07-21T04:04:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	no, was just pointing out where the package was, I use the flashplugin-installer package (which just downloads the plugin from partner without adding it)
2012-07-21T04:06:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	which browser do you use? could check about::plugins or chrome://plugins to see which version is being used
2012-07-21T04:08:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	it could be that it failed to download, may try removing flashplugin-installer, adding partner and installing adobe-flashplugin as usr13 suggests (or might try: sudo apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-installer;)
2012-07-21T04:08:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	I know I had a few problems with the plugin not downloading when they switched to the update-notifier hooks
2012-07-21T04:12:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	yeah that sounds like it, try: sudo apt-get purge flashplugin-installer; then add partner and install adobe-flashplugin
2012-07-21T04:12:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	command at the end
2012-07-21T04:13:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	you'll then need to: sudo apt-get update; before sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin;
2012-07-21T04:13:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD	trism	doesn't that mean that i'll install ALL updates available?
2012-07-21T04:14:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	no update just updates the repository information
2012-07-21T04:14:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	upgrade and dist-upgrade are the arguments that will upgrade softare
2012-07-21T04:14:00.000Z	trism	Wiz_KeeD	software
