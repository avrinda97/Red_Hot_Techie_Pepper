2009-07-07T17:26:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	alfresco contains jlan which supports cifs, webdav, ftp and nfs.
2009-07-07T17:26:00.000Z	betita_elfica	lcabrini	its free?
2009-07-07T17:26:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	yes, http://alfresco.com
2009-07-07T17:27:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	even talks sharepoint protocol
2009-07-07T17:27:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	yes, but egw and alfresco are different types of apps.

2009-07-07T17:29:00.000Z	betita_elfica	lcabrini	my problem is that i have documents
2009-07-07T17:30:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	I'm not sure what you are looking for, but alfresco offers a centralized document repository that you can connect to using smb, webdav, ftp and nfs
2009-07-07T17:31:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	and it is open source
2009-07-07T17:32:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	all based on users and roles. you invite users or groups to spaces. It's very granular.
2009-07-07T17:32:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	spaces are folders.
2009-07-07T17:33:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	I really think you should read up a bit on http://alfresco.com
2009-07-07T17:34:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	I'm sure that would be possible.
2009-07-07T17:37:00.000Z	betita_elfica	lcabrini	what people use?

2009-07-07T17:38:00.000Z	lcabrini	betita_elfica	this is a bit off-topic for #ubuntu, please go to http://alfresco.com, they have good info there.
