2007-04-23T16:39:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	Your system just crashed?
2007-04-23T16:45:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	no, I just reset my router, but I was wrong. It seems that ubuntu is refusing to accept anything from my windows box on my lan. It won't return ping replies, won't accept smb or ssh connections, and refuses to return phone calls
2007-04-23T16:48:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	Have any other boxes on this lan other then the Windows box?
2007-04-23T16:48:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	If so, can you ping them from the Windows box?
2007-04-23T16:49:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	not on the same subnet, but yes I can ping from windows box to other lan computers
2007-04-23T16:49:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	even across subnets, and when on the same
2007-04-23T16:50:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	Can the boxes outside the subnet ping the Ubuntu box?
2007-04-23T16:52:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	nope, it won't return the other windows boxes calls either
2007-04-23T16:52:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	Sounds like it's your router that's screwed up with that subnet
2007-04-23T16:53:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	actually it looks like ubuntu isn't accepting the ip I try and give it
2007-04-23T16:54:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	I assign 192.168.2.15 in the network connections manager in the system tray, but according to ifconfig, my inet addr is 195.168.2.133
2007-04-23T16:54:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	But the Ubuntu box can connect to the internet, right?
2007-04-23T16:54:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	Check /etc/networking/interfaces
2007-04-23T16:54:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	yep, on it right now
2007-04-23T16:55:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	it says 192.168.2.15 in there
2007-04-23T16:56:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	Doesn't say DHCP anywhere, right?
2007-04-23T16:57:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		nope
2007-04-23T16:57:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		static
2007-04-23T16:57:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	so I should just ignore what ifconfig is telling me?
2007-04-23T16:58:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	No, ifconfig should be correct...I don't know why it's not accepting the static IP
2007-04-23T16:58:00.000Z	GenNMX	Robbie_Crash	Are you sure your interfaces file doesn't say dhcp anywhere in the file? Sometimes those GUIs will make a mistake and you'll have two different setups for eth0
2007-04-23T16:59:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	GenNMX	eth0 is static and has an address, eth1 is dhcp and has nothing, eth2 is static and has the same address... I've only got one network adapter though. Well one ethernet and a disabled wireless card
