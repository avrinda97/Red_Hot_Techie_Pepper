2006-10-26T16:28:00.000Z	hmu		folks, I uninstalled ubuntu-desktop, but now apt-get doesn't want to re-install it anymore. what's the catch?
2006-10-26T16:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	doesn't want to install it? What's the error?
2006-10-26T16:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	is that the full output? Could you pastebin the full output?
2006-10-26T16:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	ok, how did this problem come about, and... what happens if you try to install just xorg?
2006-10-26T16:32:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	libmesa-* dependancies
2006-10-26T16:32:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	I'm now trying to install libmesa stuff
2006-10-26T16:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	are you on dapper? And, what do you have in your sources.list?
2006-10-26T16:32:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	nope, edgy
2006-10-26T16:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	you've already upgraded to edgy?
2006-10-26T16:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	did you dist-upgrade? You really should have the ubuntu-desktop metapackage before upgrading, otherwise you're going to encounter problems.
2006-10-26T16:33:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	yeah... I uninstalled ubuntu-desktop a couple of weeks ago after I had upgraded to edgy
2006-10-26T16:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	and you did a dist-upgrade without having -desktop?
2006-10-26T16:34:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	nope, the dist-upgrade was _before_ then, but I think I did a couple of dist-upgrades afterwards (but I don't think that really matters)
2006-10-26T16:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	it does matter.
2006-10-26T16:36:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	have i disrupted the "matrix"?
2006-10-26T16:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	indeed =). You'll have to play around a lot, and you *may* have mucked up your PM system
2006-10-26T16:38:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	Crap.
2006-10-26T16:39:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	I think there ought to be more warnings about removing the ubuntu-desktop package if it is going to break something. Atleast, the command-line dist-upgrade should behave like the gui dist-upgrade (ie. exit with a falure)
2006-10-26T16:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	we warn people all over the place, but hey :)
2006-10-26T16:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	hmu	removing ubuntu-desktop isn't *always* bad, you just always need it with your upgrades
2006-10-26T16:53:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	it worked ;-)
2006-10-26T16:53:00.000Z	hmu	apokryphos	rebooting now
