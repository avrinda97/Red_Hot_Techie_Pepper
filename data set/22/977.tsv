2011-06-11T13:09:00.000Z	Gozar		what happens when you kill gnome-panel? does it restart and then show the applications i currently have running, or do they disappear from the taskbar?
2011-06-11T13:09:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	it restarts
2011-06-11T13:09:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	and it's:         sudo killall gnome-panel
2011-06-11T13:10:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	it's like restarting gnome-panel
2011-06-11T13:16:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	i love nautilus...especially with sftp :P
2011-06-11T13:18:00.000Z	Gozar	Us3r_Unfriendly	how about dolphin? ;)
2011-06-11T13:20:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	I tried dolphin when i first heard of linux...it was when I first tried "sabayon linux"...I hated that and found Ubuntu...and been here since 9.10
2011-06-11T13:21:00.000Z	Gozar	Us3r_Unfriendly	might've been in the early days of that particular de ;) but i love that de more than this "standard" one :)
2011-06-11T13:22:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	they'll eventually all be the same with different names
2011-06-11T13:23:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	so easy when sftp'ing into my iphone with nautilus
2011-06-11T13:24:00.000Z	Gozar	Us3r_Unfriendly	eww iphone ;)
2011-06-11T13:25:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	You know what is funny...after jail breaking my iphone, it now uses "dpkg" to install .debs naturally (off subject)
2011-06-11T13:29:00.000Z	Gozar	Us3r_Unfriendly	well, su/sudo are nearly equally "difficult", no?
2011-06-11T13:30:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	nope...  su -c "top -c"  works nicely but all ubuntu-ers are accustomed to sudo.
2011-06-11T13:30:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	...for a top in super user mode
2011-06-11T13:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	su -c "visudo"           then with vi you can change your /etc/sudoers file to allow you to use sudo...or edit yourself in the /etc/group file
2011-06-11T13:31:00.000Z	Gozar	Us3r_Unfriendly	yeah, but you can't say that that fedora is harder because you have to know a different standard, ubuntu is equally "hard" for a regular fedora user
2011-06-11T13:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	good point
2011-06-11T13:32:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	i've used both...I should really say it takes less time for me to setup ubuntu to where i like it.  Fedora isn't Ubuntu...
2011-06-11T13:34:00.000Z	Gozar	Us3r_Unfriendly	on the cli side fedora is easier, ubuntu has the different apt-* instead of basically one yum
2011-06-11T13:34:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	true
2011-06-11T13:36:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Gozar	enjoy
