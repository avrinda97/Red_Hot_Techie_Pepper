2007-12-06T04:47:00.000Z	Brolx		Does anyone know why my Firefox browser keeps disappearing from the screen when I'm using it? It's just the Internet window, and it's done it 35 times in the past 2 days.
2007-12-06T04:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	How did you install firefox, java and flash in that computer?
2007-12-06T04:48:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	My friend did that for me.
2007-12-06T04:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	DId he ever mention anthing about scripts, automatix or envy?  Very bad ideas by the way
2007-12-06T04:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	Ok.. no problem with what they told you to do yesterday..  COuld you run this in a terminal window then paste the resulting file on your desktop into the pastebin and give me the link in here..  cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/Desktop/sources.list.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)
2007-12-06T04:54:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	I'm new to Linux, so you'll need to be patient. What exactly is a pastebin?
2007-12-06T04:57:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	and LjL: Thanks. This is the URL. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47055/
2007-12-06T04:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	that looks fine.  It looks like he installed feisty and upgraded you to gutsy
2007-12-06T05:00:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	Oh, I did that myself when the computer said that I should. But does that explain why the Firefox browser keeps disappearing?
2007-12-06T05:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	No it should not be the cause.. It looks like a fairly clean install.
2007-12-06T05:00:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	So I guess I'm stuck with this?
2007-12-06T05:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	no. it is fixable,
2007-12-06T05:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	Try installing flash and java again...
2007-12-06T05:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	ONe more question.. how much ram and hard drive space do you have?
2007-12-06T05:04:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	So I should go with the Gutsy Gibbon link on the Flash page?
2007-12-06T05:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	I would think so.. but I dont see it atm.  If you are getting the info from the bot' link.. then yes follow those instructions
2007-12-06T05:09:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	I have 257GB of hard drive space, and I'm unsure how much RAM I have.
2007-12-06T05:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	Sorry< i was busy.. do you think you have over 256 and do you know if you are sharing ram with your video card.. as in onboard video and not a plugin card
2007-12-06T05:13:00.000Z	Brolx	Jack_Sparrow	I know I have at least 512, maybe 1 GB (not sure), and I don't know if that's the case.
2007-12-06T05:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	then that should not be the issue, just one of many things to check..
2007-12-06T05:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Brolx	Good luck, I need to go to a windows box and get some work done
