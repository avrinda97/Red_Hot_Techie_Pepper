2009-05-20T20:38:00.000Z	neoline		please help!
2009-05-20T20:39:00.000Z	neoline		somepne! anyone! whats wrong with upgrading from mounted iso!
2009-05-20T20:39:00.000Z	neoline		someone*
2009-05-20T20:40:00.000Z	neoline		okay. the Jaunty alternate iso guys..
2009-05-20T20:40:00.000Z	neoline		could mount it, but no update manager started.. so followed the instruction to run the sh script
2009-05-20T20:40:00.000Z	neoline		first it started and stopped after fetching 875 packages..
2009-05-20T20:41:00.000Z	neoline		then now when m trying to run sh again, its not doing anything
2009-05-20T20:41:00.000Z	neoline		dvd rather..
2009-05-20T20:42:00.000Z	sipior	neoline	did the script give an error message when it stopped? also, where did you mount the loopback filesystem?
2009-05-20T20:43:00.000Z	neoline	sipior	script didnt give me any error, which means it ran it. and mounted it at /media/isomount folder
2009-05-20T20:44:00.000Z	neoline	sipior	any idea why it stopped at 875 packages when it ran the first time?
2009-05-20T20:45:00.000Z	sipior	neoline	no. that's why i asked about error messages. can you simply copy the package archive to /var/cache/apt/archives and run update-manager normally?
2009-05-20T20:46:00.000Z	neoline	sipior	Hey! that is a nice idea! u mean, i copy the whole archives folder to the apt's cache folder and then run update manager?
2009-05-20T20:47:00.000Z	sipior	neoline	worth a try, anyway
2009-05-20T20:48:00.000Z	neoline	sipior	okay, i'll try it. Just one last favour. after copying it, what should i run? the update manager from the system->administration menu?
2009-05-20T20:49:00.000Z	sipior	neoline	yep. or just "update-manager -c -d" from a terminal.
2009-05-20T20:50:00.000Z	neoline	sipior	okay! that sounds cool. hmm.. i wonder why i didnt think of this copying option before! thanks a lot!
2009-05-20T20:50:00.000Z	sipior	neoline	yep, have fun
2009-05-20T20:51:00.000Z	neoline	sipior	well one more favour.. :p perhaps the last one.. i got the md5 with md5sum command. but with what i should compare it to?
2009-05-20T21:01:00.000Z	neoline	sipior	haha.. that is true.. But that is incompetency! a naive user cannot reinstall every other time!
