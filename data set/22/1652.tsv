2010-03-01T06:07:00.000Z	NitaiPal		i have some questions
2010-03-01T06:08:00.000Z	NitaiPal		i want to switch from the 64 bit architecture to 32 bit one (the latest version of ubuntu that i just downloaded) because 64 bit just isn't worth the trouble and i want my computer to work smoothly without the probs which i can perhaps solve but don't have the time to solve ... thanks for answering my question
2010-03-01T06:09:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	 Format, Install Ta da!
2010-03-01T06:09:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	but i don't want to lose my files
2010-03-01T06:10:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	Look up Ubuntu One, SkyDrive (By MSN)  those places you upload your files to, however the max upload is 2 - 2.5 gigs
2010-03-01T06:10:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	i have like over 50 gigs
2010-03-01T06:11:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	 is there no way to change it without having to worry bout my files .. like how it happens with upgrade
2010-03-01T06:11:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	 Oh yes actually,  how big is your harddrive?
2010-03-01T06:13:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	like 120
2010-03-01T06:14:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	actually , 250 to be exact
2010-03-01T06:16:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	1. Restart your computer with Ubuntu 32bit.  2. Under Administration select partition editor(manager).  3.  Create a 50gig partition(or however much you need) 4. Copy the files you want onto that partition.  5. Install Ubuntu 32bit.  6. select the large partition where Ubuntu 64bit was and install there
2010-03-01T06:17:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	after you are done installing grab the files from that partition, then put the live cd in again and delete that partition and join it with your Primary disk, or leave it for backups.
2010-03-01T06:19:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	basically what i said
2010-03-01T06:21:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	 i only have 20 gig of free space
2010-03-01T06:22:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	is that enough to install a new version of ubutnutu 32 bit with no problems
2010-03-01T06:23:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	Yeah that will be fien
2010-03-01T06:25:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	the main reason i'm doing this is because my cpu Fan is too loud
2010-03-01T06:26:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	what about the other problems you were experiencing?  i was recently on it that very OS and didn't have any trouble
2010-03-01T06:26:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	 i have a inspiron 530
2010-03-01T06:26:00.000Z	NitaiPal	LavaEagle	youtube works on and off and i have to somestimes switch between browsers and stuff
2010-03-01T06:27:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	histo is right
2010-03-01T06:28:00.000Z	LavaEagle	NitaiPal	but if your cpu is unable to handle the OS definately drop down and you have a far better time.
