2011-08-30T11:15:00.000Z	norbert79		Good morning. I am looking for finding the device file for Bluetooth in /dev, but failed to do so so far. I would like to use Bluetooth under wine, but for that I would like to know which device file I have to link. It's not rfcomm*, I am already through that part.
2011-08-30T11:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	norbert79	I think it's a different part of /dev for different kinds of bluetooth devices
2011-08-30T11:15:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Well, sure, but since I am clueless where to look, some advice would be welcome.
2011-08-30T11:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	norbert79	for example, a mouse or keyboard would be something like hid, whereas headset would be something like audio
2011-08-30T11:16:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Right now I have a phone added as Bluetooth device, and would like to use COM transfer
2011-08-30T11:16:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Yet I don't see anything which might point as being available for such
2011-08-30T11:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	norbert79	yeah, I'm not sure where that would show up, but it does seem that /dev is this most likely place. lemme check
2011-08-30T11:17:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Sure, thank you...
2011-08-30T11:18:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	/dev let me down unfortunetaly... :(
2011-08-30T11:18:00.000Z	gaelfx	norbert79	com transfer as in a remote control?
2011-08-30T11:19:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Yes, would like to make possible running a phone-handling application running
2011-08-30T11:20:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothDialup This helped me a bit, but since the description is rather very old I thought there might be other solutions too...
2011-08-30T11:20:00.000Z	gaelfx	norbert79	did you check the bluetoothremotecontrol page?
2011-08-30T11:20:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Since I doubt this has been left as it is...
2011-08-30T11:21:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Not yet, but the weird thing is, that I AM able to remote control my desktop through the phone WITHOUT any tricks
2011-08-30T11:22:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	So this is why I doubt I would need to hack /etc/bluetooth, and there must be a dev present in /dev
2011-08-30T11:22:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	But I might be still wrong
2011-08-30T11:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	norbert79	I think you would need to edit that to change functionality, but I'm not sure how to, sorry
2011-08-30T11:24:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Oh well, thank you anyway for trying...
2011-08-30T11:27:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	Appearntly ffmpeg might be able handling it. So I guess having that and playing it under Totem might do the trick
2011-08-30T11:30:00.000Z	gaelfx	norbert79	or vlc ;)
2011-08-30T11:31:00.000Z	norbert79	gaelfx	For which you just told, that it didn't work... :S
