2008-05-15T10:15:00.000Z	monestri		granted, it would never come out of that blank screen
2008-05-15T10:15:00.000Z	monestri		testing it again, be back in a bit if it dies
2008-05-15T10:15:00.000Z	monestri		ok
2008-05-15T10:15:00.000Z	monestri		that seems to allow me to close the lid
2008-05-15T10:16:00.000Z	monestri		which is .. nice. cause laptops are nice to close every once and a while
2008-05-15T10:16:00.000Z	monestri		but that won't help when the computer goes idle
2008-05-15T10:16:00.000Z	monestri		after x amount minutes
2008-05-15T10:18:00.000Z	monestri		screensaver has an option to change the time computer is idle after x minutes
2008-05-15T10:18:00.000Z	monestri		but it only goes to 2 hours
2008-05-15T10:18:00.000Z	monestri		not "never"
2008-05-15T10:18:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	uncheck the screensaver
2008-05-15T10:18:00.000Z	monestri	kelvin911	?
2008-05-15T10:19:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	look carefully u can disable the screensaver
2008-05-15T10:32:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	unplug without unmount usually create problem
2008-05-15T10:32:00.000Z	monestri	kelvin911	not the issue
2008-05-15T10:34:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	what is the prob?
2008-05-15T10:35:00.000Z	monestri	kelvin911	 devices don't turn up in dmesg when plugged in
2008-05-15T10:36:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	did u just unplug them from windows?
2008-05-15T10:41:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	i think your usb problem u need to ask expert in #linux
2008-05-15T10:42:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	there are also many ubuntu guys in #linux or #windows
2008-05-15T10:43:00.000Z	kelvin911	monestri	just so that sometimes the admin here are so annoying that no one wanna chat in here
2008-05-15T10:43:00.000Z	monestri	kelvin911	uh, what?
