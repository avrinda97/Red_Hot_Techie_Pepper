2008-07-18T05:16:00.000Z	zoreau		anyone know how to mount a .bin file? it asks me to specify filesystem type, i usually use '-o loop', and using '-o bin' doesnt work (tells me to use loop instead)
2008-07-18T05:16:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	not all .bin files are mountable
2008-07-18T05:19:00.000Z	zoreau	unop	-2 doesnt seem to work, it doesnt look like a valid parameter (-s)
2008-07-18T05:20:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	 are you sure you got the command right?
2008-07-18T05:20:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	file -s file.bin
2008-07-18T05:21:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	not mount .. file  :)
2008-07-18T05:21:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	we're trying to find out what type of .bin file this is
2008-07-18T05:22:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	as i said earlier, not all .bin files are mountable, in other words, they are not always images of filesystems - some are executable programs, some are binary data, etc
2008-07-18T05:22:00.000Z	zoreau	unop	it returned "data"  XD not ery informative
2008-07-18T05:23:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	where did you get this file from?
2008-07-18T05:24:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	it won't tell you the filesystem -- but it could give you something more informative, but as you saw, not always
2008-07-18T05:27:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	so where did you get this file from?
2008-07-18T05:27:00.000Z	zoreau	unop	Torrent from TPB I believe, there is also a .cue with it
2008-07-18T05:29:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	http://www.ubuntusky.com/2007/04/16/how-to-mount-or-burn-a-bin-image/ maybe this helps
2008-07-18T05:31:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	did you try mounting with the -t iso9660 option?
2008-07-18T05:32:00.000Z	zoreau	unop	before or after conerting to iso?
2008-07-18T05:32:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	before -- and not relating to converting the iso
2008-07-18T05:32:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	 sudo mount -t iso9660 file.bin /path/to/mountpoint
2008-07-18T05:34:00.000Z	zoreau	unop	-t iso9660 reports 'is not a block device'
2008-07-18T05:36:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	hmm, not sure then, the file could be damaged/corrupted -- but try converting it to an ISO
2008-07-18T05:39:00.000Z	zoreau	unop	Thanks for the help, I got it! converted to an iso, then used -o loop
2008-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	unop	zoreau	cool
