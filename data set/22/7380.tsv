2006-09-25T12:22:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	when I run the sudo pyton easyubuntu.in command, there is a blank line in the terminal and nothing happens
2006-09-25T12:24:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	look at this: http://nopaste.biz/?8256
2006-09-25T12:26:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	when I type it, some thing from VM Ware shows up and wants to configure some network
2006-09-25T12:26:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	that also comes, when I work with Synaptic
2006-09-25T12:27:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	YES! about ten times
2006-09-25T12:27:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	they wont let themselves be installed and I dont know how to get them away
2006-09-25T12:28:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	no, but i think i can uninstall them. wait
2006-09-25T12:29:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	yesss! it works!
2006-09-25T12:30:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	i dont know. would you recommend me to install the ati driver? when I last did, my system didnt shutdown properly
2006-09-25T12:31:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	good, ty
2006-09-25T12:32:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	 you from USA?
2006-09-25T12:34:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	do they sell rabbits in your supermarket, I mean dead ones, to eat? like chickens?
2006-09-25T12:35:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	in ours they do! its ugly isnt it??
2006-09-25T12:37:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	the poor rabbits, there are no laws for them, how they must live in their cages! i guess they live a very bad life before they are killed!
2006-09-25T12:39:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	lol, but it is not surprising to me, if you see the giant chicken farms where the meat units "live"
2006-09-25T12:43:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	are you for the democrats or the republicans?
2006-09-25T12:45:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	that would be not a good statement in our country, because then theyd all say, that the national socialists would raise, because fewer people would vote for the "usual" parites
2006-09-25T12:47:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	yes I understand you, and I think its not that big difference
2006-09-25T12:47:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	i think the codecs still dont work
2006-09-25T12:52:00.000Z	gerhard	czer323	see? its up there
