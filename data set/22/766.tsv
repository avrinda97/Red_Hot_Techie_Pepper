2011-04-13T19:46:00.000Z	theos	DotNet	you format a partition. i think formating the partition erases everything on that partition. not sure though
2011-04-13T19:47:00.000Z	DotNet	theos	ok, thanks.
2011-04-13T19:48:00.000Z	theos	DotNet	you can however try to retrieve your files using testdisk if you want :)
2011-04-13T19:48:00.000Z	DotNet	theos	how_
2011-04-13T19:49:00.000Z	theos	DotNet	maybe they are still on the disk if you didnt overwrite them. install testdisk and see
2011-04-13T19:49:00.000Z	DotNet	theos	do you know any good sofware to check a disc and know which sectors are damaged?
2011-04-13T19:50:00.000Z	theos	DotNet	windows has one. but i dont remember the name.
2011-04-13T19:52:00.000Z	theos	DotNet	your hdd manufacturer should provide diagnostic tools on its website. check them out

2011-04-13T19:54:00.000Z	theos	DotNet	hmm check your manufacturer's website for diagnostic tools. ubuntu is lacking in this area afaik
