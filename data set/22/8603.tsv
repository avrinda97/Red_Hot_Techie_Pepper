2006-10-26T11:17:00.000Z	root		without asking for a password, it said "System will shutdown in One minute!" then said enter the username with the correct case
2006-10-26T11:17:00.000Z	root		What the heck is going on....
2006-10-26T11:19:00.000Z	root		Can someone tell me the name for the default Ubuntu log in manager?
