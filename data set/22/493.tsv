2012-07-21T04:03:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		i did that usr13
2012-07-21T04:03:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		maybe it was too late, and the former version got allready installed?
2012-07-21T04:03:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		you suggest doing that trism?
2012-07-21T04:04:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		and how does it work for you trism ?
2012-07-21T04:04:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		64 bit usr13
2012-07-21T04:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 you have done a 'sudo apt-get update' recently?
2012-07-21T04:05:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD	Dr_willis	it's a fresh install, ran it 2 days ago
2012-07-21T04:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	  purge does not touch anything in the users home dirs. :) neither does the normal apt-get remove.
2012-07-21T04:13:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD	Dr_willis	this means that it will still be "messy" ?
2012-07-21T04:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 no idea what you mean.. the apt-get system does NOT touch any settings or config files in the users home dirs..
2012-07-21T04:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 it would be very bad if it did. :)
2012-07-21T04:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 I just use a flashreplacer extension that plays flash video in VLC. :)   No need for flash for me for most sites
2012-07-21T04:24:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD	Dr_willis	most sites? and doesn't it run slower or smth?
2012-07-21T04:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 never noticed any speed issues.. It plays in a vlc window in the browser, or external vlc player.
2012-11-23T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 set the default shell for the user to be bash via 'chsh'
2012-11-23T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 how did you add the user? or is this on a vps?
2012-11-23T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Wiz_KeeD	 set the default shell for the user to be bash via 'chsh'  <------------- command is 'chsh' ;)
