2005-10-15T14:48:00.000Z	magnusthe		I'm having some problems taming the HAL beast... anyone around who could help?
2005-10-15T14:48:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	whats wrong with HAL?
2005-10-15T14:49:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	gnome-volume-manager is a little too aggressive in mounting partitions on my USB stick, AFAICS HAL is the way to prevent it... but I can't get it to work
2005-10-15T14:50:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	aggressive?, in what way?
2005-10-15T14:57:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	I sec
2005-10-15T14:51:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	it mounts the device (dev/sdb in my case) as well as both partitions (/dev/sdb{1,2})... how do I convince it to leave /dev/sdb unmounted?
2005-10-15T14:52:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	I dont follow, usb sticks use fat16!
2005-10-15T14:52:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	I have a USB stick that I ran cfdisk on... two partitions, one vfat, one ext3
2005-10-15T14:54:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	dont know then, sound like soemthing you did yourself
2005-10-15T14:55:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	yupp, sure did... but how do I get HAL to respect my whishes? I can use it to change the "label" it uses to mount it (i.e. the name it shows on the desktop), but I just can't stop the mounting altogether :(
2005-10-15T14:56:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	even there were only one partition, how would I turn off the mounting of it (i.e. not mounting a specific USB stick), I still want all other sticks to mount...
2005-10-15T14:57:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	ok
2005-10-15T14:58:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	you could change the policies in /etc/hal
2005-10-15T14:59:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	how?
2005-10-15T14:59:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	i'm not to familier with it, there is a file in /fdi
2005-10-15T15:00:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	yes, I've been playing with it... I've managed to use it to change the label (volume.label), but I don't know what to change in order to prevent gnome-volume-manager to mount the damn thing
2005-10-15T15:01:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	tell it not not mount drives, it that what you mean?
2005-10-15T15:02:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	nope not quite, tell it not to mount a specific device
2005-10-15T15:03:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal
2005-10-15T15:04:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	ah, the HAL spec, thanks!
2005-10-15T15:09:00.000Z	magnusthe	SuseUX	thanks, I've gotten some more ideas of how to do it... just have to wait until I'm at _my_ computer again, tomorrow
2005-10-15T15:09:00.000Z	SuseUX	magnusthe	:-)
