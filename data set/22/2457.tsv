2011-05-08T01:32:00.000Z	allu2		but anyone got an ide why would xfce4 run in root but not as regular user?
2011-05-08T01:32:00.000Z	allu2		idea*
2011-05-08T01:32:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	What do you  mean 'xfce' is running as root.  xfce is the culmination of a couple of different processes
2011-05-08T01:33:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	startxfce4 worked only as root, and gdm didn't let me login as normal user
2011-05-08T01:33:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	but i just figured that it was because of .Iceauthority file in my /home
2011-05-08T01:33:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	removing it fixed the problem :)
2011-05-08T01:34:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	yeah probably that was the issue.  typically you should never log into gdm as root.  Doesn't xfce use xdm?
2011-05-08T01:35:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	not that i know
2011-05-08T01:35:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	mmm
2011-05-08T01:36:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	well i think the .Iceauthorithy was remainings of my debian installation
2011-07-28T18:28:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	debian has testing tough.
2011-07-28T18:28:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	Yeah I guess those are very similar
2011-12-25T04:44:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	the easy way or the hard way?
2011-12-25T04:44:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	fast way :)
2011-12-25T04:45:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	boot that hdd (does it boot?)
2011-12-25T04:45:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	boots on the eeepc
2011-12-25T04:45:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	how many hdd's do you have?
2011-12-25T04:45:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	one on eeepc, one external, one on my desktop computer
2011-12-25T04:49:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	so how i see if the grub is installed on the correct device?
2011-12-25T04:49:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	boot that device
2011-12-25T04:49:00.000Z	edbian	allu2	if grub is installed you will see grub / linux
2011-12-25T04:51:00.000Z	allu2	edbian	ok, but this doesn't make sense, since the grub when i boot from external HD shows the ubuntu on the external HD and on the eeepc, but when i boot from eeepc hd i see only eeepc ubuntu as option, henche grub should be installed on the external hd, yet still it doesn't load on my desktop computer
