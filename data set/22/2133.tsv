2011-08-13T10:31:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	Here's a great place, stay on here.
2011-08-13T10:31:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	I'm not an Ubuntu user but I still love it here
2011-08-13T10:33:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	Yes you're right.. I just would like to be more active with those tech stuff, maybe some forum.. I dont know
2011-08-13T22:37:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	If it's a bug, report it
2011-08-13T22:37:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	Run "ubuntu-bug compiz"
2011-08-13T22:37:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	You'll need a Launchpad account, however.
2011-08-13T22:38:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	Ok, got it.. but is there anything else I can do for now? I just watch my programs with damaged / lost colors? : (
2011-08-27T09:10:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	Yes
2011-08-27T09:11:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	How do I change it? For instance, let's say I wanna install XDM, that's pretty much lightweith.. right?
2011-08-27T09:11:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	I'd suggest lxdm, because xdm is almost unconfigurable and hardly ever does what you want it to
2011-08-27T09:11:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	Anyway, sudo apt-get install your-favorite-display-manager
2011-08-27T09:15:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	Ok, thank you for the advice.. but let me ask you.. Do you know if it's more lightweitht than gdm? Or has better performance or memory usage?
2011-08-27T09:16:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	A lot more lightweight indeed, performs better too... And is desktop-independent so you can use it with Gnome, KDE, Xfce, e17, openbox, whatever else
2011-08-27T09:16:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	Cool!! Really thanks!! Once installed, how do I change from gdm to lxdm?
2011-08-27T09:17:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	apt-get will ask you if you want to do so during installation
2011-08-27T09:17:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	Oh ok, thanks..
2011-08-27T09:19:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	Just for learning purpose.. what's the procedure for changing the login manager? let's say I have it already installed, but gdm still the default?
2011-08-27T09:19:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	sudo dpkg-reconfigure the-login-manager-you-want-to-use
2011-08-27T09:19:00.000Z	rodhash	theadmin	hehe, thank you a lot!
2011-08-27T09:21:00.000Z	theadmin	rodhash	No problem
