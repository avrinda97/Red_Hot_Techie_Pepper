2011-03-17T22:35:00.000Z	evancharlton		hey guys, not sure what's going on here. I've got some stuff on my local PATH which resolves just fine, but `which foo` returns nothing
2011-03-17T22:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	aliases do not work with which
2011-03-17T22:36:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	it's not an alias
2011-03-17T22:37:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	what is it?
2011-03-17T22:37:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	it's every bin that I added to my PATH
2011-03-17T22:37:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	just executables. For example, the Android SDK
2011-03-17T22:37:00.000Z	evancharlton		`adb` works just fine; `which adb` = ''
2011-03-17T22:38:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	you don't add actual files to your path. you can directories that have bins in them..
2011-03-17T22:38:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	I know. I added dirs
2011-03-17T22:38:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	restart your term after you've added the new directory to your path
2011-03-17T22:38:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	in my ~/.bashrc: export PATH="$PATH:~/development/android-sdk/tools/"
2011-03-17T22:38:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	I have
2011-03-17T22:39:00.000Z	evancharlton		hm, is it the ~ ?
2011-03-17T22:39:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	echo $PATH shows this addition?.. ~ is shorthand for /home/yourusername
2011-03-17T22:39:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	yes, it shows that. and I know what ~ is shorthand for :)
2011-03-17T22:39:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	try to use the fullpath instead of ~
2011-03-17T22:39:00.000Z	evancharlton		will do
2011-03-17T22:39:00.000Z	evancharlton		one minute
2011-03-17T22:40:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	my battery is dying. my laptop will last no longer. good luck
2011-03-17T22:40:00.000Z	evancharlton	bastidrazor	full path does it. Damn.
2011-03-17T22:41:00.000Z	evancharlton		thanks!
2011-03-17T22:41:00.000Z	bastidrazor	evancharlton	nice. now you know :)
