2006-08-24T15:03:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	let me fetch a URL for the /topic. sec ...
2006-08-24T15:06:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	could you throw that URL i pasted into the /topic. despite the bug being old, and long fixed, we're still getting support queries about it. i'll try anything to stem the tide. :)
2006-08-24T15:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	the issue is fixed there is no need for it
2006-08-24T15:08:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	if you say so, but our RT queue says differently :)
2006-08-24T15:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	10.4 has been in repos for a few days
2006-08-24T15:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	if 10.4 doesnt fix your issue than your issue isnt the same as that one
2006-08-24T15:10:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	the problem is that people don't update. especially after they have either been burned by an updated or have been spooked about updating after reading about issues.
2006-08-24T15:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	the few people that are left with the issue we can tell to upgrade packages if they want it fixed. most people dont read the topic anyway
2006-08-24T15:11:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	k, whatevah. :)
2006-10-06T16:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	that wont remove anything
2006-10-06T16:58:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	right, so the apps devy was using before will work, but he'll get a KDE desktop
2006-10-06T16:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	yes and i dont recommend removing ubuntu-desktop if he plans on keeping gnome
2006-12-15T17:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	thats it?
2007-01-12T17:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	you still around?
2007-03-16T13:13:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	for instance, "a lot" is 2 words ;) :P
2007-04-06T14:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	it seems to be nothing
2007-04-06T15:00:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	syn/ack
2007-08-25T08:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	they are gone
2007-08-25T08:17:00.000Z	mneptok	gnomefreak	we'll keep +R for a bit, hmmm?  :)
2007-08-25T08:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mneptok	thats fine although +r is more effective but +R should do it
