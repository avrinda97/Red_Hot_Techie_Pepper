2008-12-24T17:43:00.000Z	alec		can anyone tell me how to navigate to a file, rather than a directory?
2008-12-24T17:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	  clarify what you mean.
2008-12-24T17:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 that makes little sence...   what do you mean by navigate?
2008-12-24T17:46:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	well im jsut following the directions i found online, where they use navigate all the time
2008-12-24T17:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 cant say taht ive ever seen that term to  open a file.. You navigate  - ie :  'move to' a directory then work on files in the dir...
2008-12-24T17:52:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	well i guess i just meant, how do i navigate to the apple pie
2008-12-24T17:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 that would be going to the directory/folder.. with the use of the 'cd' command.
2008-12-24T17:57:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	yes i see the difference, but you see what i meant. after all your a doctor. it was just an issue of semantics.
2008-12-24T17:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 semantics kills :)
2008-12-24T17:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 i still use the term 'directory' not folder.. also.. im old-skool
2008-12-24T17:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 you were allready navigating to the file :) is what had us confused.
2008-12-24T17:59:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	yes, im new to command line, its what had me confused, i thought i could make the file my working directory jsut as i would /Desktop, for example.
2008-12-24T18:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 more fun confusion at the 'lowest' levels of the OS.. even directories are files. :)
2008-12-24T18:06:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	actually, while were at it, how do i connect to a network (aka, the windows network at my apartment) in ubuntu. i can see the other connected computers but i cant access any files
2008-12-24T18:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 depends.. :) the 'new' way is use the gnome file manager and browse the network/acces the shares.. the  command line way is to mount the samba shares with smbmount or similer commands.  see the pacakge 'samba-doc' and the books in it.. for all the info you would EVER want on samba. :)
2008-12-24T18:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 also the gnome/file manager/browse method - is VERY flakey for me.. often i have to type in the full path to the  machine/sharename for it to pop up the username/password dialog to allow me to access the share
2008-12-24T18:16:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	now using samba?
2008-12-24T18:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 Huh?
2008-12-24T18:18:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	i have samba. but i have no idea what to do with it, im reading something from a google search right now.
2008-12-24T18:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 tell the channel exactly what it is you are wanting to do. :) mounting samba shares via the command line - is documented all over the place..
2008-12-24T18:23:00.000Z	alec	dr_willis	do you know if mount name is going to be the name of the computer, for example HTPC is the name?
2008-12-24T18:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	alec	 monting basics.. the mount POINT is a directory - that can be ANY name you want
