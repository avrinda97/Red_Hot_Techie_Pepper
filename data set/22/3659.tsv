2008-07-09T06:27:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	We're all learning here. :)
2008-07-09T06:29:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Can you repeat your problem? Is it driver-related or configuration-related?
2008-07-09T06:30:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	So, do you have any errors popping up, or what?
2008-07-09T06:31:00.000Z	Jpratt	macrobad	Nope its simply not seeing my wireless connection for some reason
2008-07-09T06:32:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	try running in terminal 'sudo iwlist eth1 scanning', substituting eth1 with your interface name.
2008-07-09T06:34:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	ifconfig should give you a clue ;) Anyway, it is just a fancy way to refer to the network card nickname
2008-07-09T06:35:00.000Z	Jpratt	macrobad	Wow im lost now
2008-07-09T06:36:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Unfortunately, sometimes networking with network manager applet just doesn't work out of box, IMO. Although there are other tools, I prefer to retreat to command line, which is universal across various distributions.
2008-07-09T06:37:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	So, what are you confused with? Ifconfig output?
2008-07-09T06:38:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Ok, I've found a GUI-way to do the same thing. Are you on Gnome?
2008-07-09T06:38:00.000Z	Jpratt	macrobad	Thank *insert Deity* YEs
2008-07-09T06:41:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Ok, then go to System->Administration->Network tools, and have a look on the Network devices (I'm not sure if it is called exactly like this in the English version) drop-down list: there you should see your network cards with their shorthand nicks in paranthesis.
2008-07-09T06:43:00.000Z	Jpratt	macrobad	-.- my cards not there....The Downfall of Linux, Its Driver support is worse than Vista sometimes...
2008-07-09T06:44:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Sorry, what do you mean saying "my cards are not there"? o_O There should be a loopback interface, at the very minimum.
2008-07-09T06:47:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Ok, anything else?
2008-07-09T06:48:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	So, you have a wireless card, and a wired card, but only ethernet (wired) is there. Am I right?
2008-07-09T06:49:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Ok, then it is driver issue.
2008-07-09T06:50:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Is you wireless built-in, or do you use a USB, or PCMCIA device?
2008-07-09T06:52:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	So, you mean it was there with a laptop, you do not attach it separately, like, you cannot take it out. Right?
2008-07-09T06:57:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	*sigh* Ok, I assume that your wireless card is detachable, and that it is a PCMCIA card. Now, actually, comes a problem: I've never had any experience with a PCMCIA wireless cards, although they are supported nicely in Linux... Let me do quick googling.
2008-07-09T07:05:00.000Z	macrobad	Jpratt	Well, I actually cannot help you a lot if you have a PCMCIA card, as I have never touched one, and I have to work now, but you may find this article quite useful: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide
