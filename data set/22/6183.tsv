2006-12-19T08:42:00.000Z	arrenlex		Guys, what's that command which lists what libraries a binary depends on?
2006-12-19T08:43:00.000Z	arrenlex		"depends on" -> "links to"?
2006-12-19T08:43:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	ldd
2006-12-19T08:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	Thanks!
2007-01-07T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	sudo -i   first, then   echo "foo" >> /var/bar
2007-01-07T06:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	Any ways without new shells?
2007-01-07T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	echo "foo" | sudo tee -a /var/bar  I think
2007-01-20T10:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	Actually, you should never private message ubotwo. He will block you from sending him commands.
2007-01-20T10:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	ubotwo is a temporary replacement only, and he doesn't like when you explore him.
2007-01-20T10:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	Learned that the hard way.
2007-01-20T10:49:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	oh ok
2007-02-18T14:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	3 lines is the max for a channel paste by convention, I think.
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	he used 4 really :)
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	How's that?
2007-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	never mind, now we're just wasting more space
2007-02-23T07:36:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	use tee
2007-02-23T07:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	With what syntax?
2007-02-23T07:37:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	echo "foo" | sudo tee -a /var/bar
2007-02-23T07:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	That seems to work. Thanks.
2008-12-04T07:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	jrib	I just said that to them like 2 minutes ago..
2008-12-04T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	indeed you did :)
2008-12-14T10:37:00.000Z	jrib	arrenlex	that's a different issue.  What filesystem?
