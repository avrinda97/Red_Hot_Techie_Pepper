2006-09-04T11:09:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Whats ubuntu like on the new intel macs?
2006-09-04T11:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	just like it is on normal intel things
2006-09-04T11:11:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	oh, i assumed it might be a pain what with the EFI instead of bios,
2006-09-04T11:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	If I remember corerctly, you might have to use yaboot, but... once its booted, its exactly the same ;)
2006-09-04T11:12:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	Yeah, i remember that well, i have a PPC mac
2006-09-21T16:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	they don't let you use putty?
2006-09-21T16:56:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	I have to jump through hoops (ie writing a program to call command.com since theyve blocked most ways to get to any form of command prompt, except they left a compiler in the shared apps, oops), So no, not likely i could convince them either.
2006-09-21T16:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	get a better college ;)  get some OSS ssh program, and compile it ;)
2006-09-21T16:57:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	The college is a pretty high standard, just strict about network rules, And that still wont help,
2006-09-21T16:58:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	basically i just wanna know if telnetting into a chroot jail then sshing to local host will be secure enough.
2006-09-21T16:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	what's wrong with a thumbdrive?
2006-09-21T16:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	telnet won't be, ebcause your communication is all still plaintext, from your computer to where you're telnetted into
2006-09-21T16:59:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	Nothing other than the fact that i cant execute anything from external storage devices.
2006-09-21T05:01:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	True, but it'll offer a bit more security than just telnetting no? I dont care about packets being in plain text as no one sniffing on the college network will try and telnet to my computer
2006-09-21T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	no.  It really won't be any more secure.  It'd be like using ssh, with a keylogger on your computer.
2006-09-21T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	which college is it, by the way? so I can stay far away from it.
2006-09-21T05:03:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	I understand what you mean but i feel a little weary running a telnet server outside of an chroot jail as if past experiences tell me anything its a big ugly pile of crud :-)
2006-09-21T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	it still won't be any better, you log into your chroot jail, and then ssh into your box, the person sniffing your telnet still knows how to ssh from your telnet to your real box
2006-09-21T05:05:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	Im not worried about people sniffing, Im worried about general security issues with telnet itsself besides the plaintext issue
2006-09-21T05:09:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	Ok, maybe not the best idea ever, Can you think of a semi decent way to acomplish something similar, without having to mess around with compiling stuff, trying to get things to run from external drives etc, As i dont really wanna push it too much i dont fancy getting kicked out :-)
2006-09-21T05:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Crippy-Boy	get a better college, seriously.  Yours can't be condusive to learning.
2006-09-21T05:11:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	Flannel	Its the only one within about 30 miles of where i am, And the resources are there for what im studying, i just dont like not being able to access things at home.
