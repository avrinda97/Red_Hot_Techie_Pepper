2008-04-06T14:34:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	try 'sudo depmod -a'
2008-04-06T14:35:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: not work because /lib/modules/2.6.22-8-server/modules.dep not available
2008-04-06T14:36:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	are you using the kernel that came with ubuntu?
2008-04-06T14:36:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: yes
2008-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	and did you try 'sudo depmod -a'?  What did it output?
2008-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: WARNING: Couldn't open directory /lib/modules/2.6.22-8-server: No such file or directory
2008-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: so what i can do now ?
2008-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	you may need to reinstall the kernel, but I'm not sure how
2008-04-06T15:09:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	what happens when you try to 'cd /lib/modules/2.6.22-8-server/'?
2008-04-06T15:09:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: none
2008-04-06T15:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	what happens when you do that they type 'ls'?
2008-04-06T15:10:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: type ls on which ?
2008-04-06T15:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	never mind
2008-04-06T15:11:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	I think you need to reinstall the kernel with these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeKernel
2008-04-06T15:13:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	try 'sudo aptitude reinstall linux-image-server' to reinstall the kernel
2008-04-06T15:14:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: linux-image-server is not currently installed, so it will not be reinstalled.
2008-04-06T15:14:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	replace 'reinstall' with 'install'
2008-04-06T15:18:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: Could not find where the current root file system is mounted!
2008-04-06T15:18:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	in that case, I think something's seriuosly wrong
2008-04-06T15:19:00.000Z	nsetiono	Starnestommy	: i know something wrong but i don't know which one cause i'm not an expert :(
2008-04-06T15:20:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nsetiono	neither can I.  There's a possiblilty that you may need to do a total reinstall, but I'm not sure if there's another way
