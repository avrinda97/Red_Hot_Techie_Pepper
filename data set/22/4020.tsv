2008-04-27T13:47:00.000Z	Danish989		quick question: how long does it take on average to install KDE in ubuntu?
2008-04-27T13:48:00.000Z	Danish989		cts35: do you know the address of the channel?
2008-04-27T13:48:00.000Z	Danish989		flannel: do you know the filesize of kde? or how long it will take to download at say, 30kbps?
2008-04-27T13:49:00.000Z	Danish989		thanks dr_willis
2008-04-27T13:50:00.000Z	Danish989		does anyone know a better supported hardware list for laptops, then the official ubuntu wiki list?
2008-04-27T13:50:00.000Z	Danish989		flannel: thanks :)

2008-04-27T13:52:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	the best way to go tends to be Google...
2008-04-27T13:53:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	the liveCD doesn't automount hard drives
2008-04-27T13:54:00.000Z	Danish989	BHSPitLappy	thanksh.
2008-04-27T13:54:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	during install, you decide which partitions get mounted where
2008-04-27T13:54:00.000Z	Danish989	BHSPitLappy	what about installing inside windows using WIBE (or w/e its called, the new feature in hardy heron)
2008-04-27T13:55:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	what about it?
2008-04-27T13:55:00.000Z	Danish989	BHSPitLappy	do I have to specify where to mount them if I install that way, too?
2008-04-27T13:55:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	I've never used it :)
2008-04-27T13:56:00.000Z	Danish989	BHSPitLappy	Okie, thanks anyway :)
2008-04-27T13:56:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	I wouldn't imagine that you'd be able to access the NTFS partition whilst inside Ubuntu (using the Wubi approach), but hey, maybe I'm wrong :)
2008-04-27T13:59:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	Hardy comes with Transmission, it's quite good
2008-04-27T13:59:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Danish989	if you need more I'd suggest Deluge.
2008-04-27T13:59:00.000Z	Danish989	BHSPitLappy	Thank you :)
