2006-10-04T06:45:00.000Z	keegan_		Is ellioTb uninstalling KDE still?
2006-10-04T06:45:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	i haven't installed it yet
2006-10-04T06:46:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	i want to install it, just nervous about taking up half a gig and then hating it
2006-10-04T06:46:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	If you don't like KDE when you install just go into the package manager and take it off, simple as that
2006-10-04T06:46:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	thanx
2006-10-04T06:52:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	I have a p3 866MHz, 512Mbs RAM, and a GeForce 5200 and I can run KDE with a little tiny bit a slowness
2006-10-04T06:53:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	i think i am going to install kde just so i can check it out a little more
2006-10-04T06:54:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	I love KDE, I just hate Kopete doesn't tell if people are using AIM with there Cellphone or not, thats all that is stopping me from using KDE lol
2006-10-04T06:55:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	lol, can't u just use gaim in KDE? i like the ichat style of kopete, but its so annoying how you can't organize the group names
2006-10-04T06:56:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	gaim would be awsome if you could "skin" it a little more, or change the appearance better
2006-10-04T06:57:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	i just realized how annoying that is you can't see the cellphones
2006-10-04T06:57:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	Totally or if they made kopete better, hopefully KDE4 revamps kopete
2006-10-04T06:57:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	well i am gonna install KDE right now
2006-10-04T06:57:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	I hate it too, I am always afraid to IM
2006-10-04T06:59:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	if i have the kubuntu cd, can i install kde off that, by adding it to sources.list or whatever
2006-10-04T07:00:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	cause its a pretty big DL
2006-10-04T07:00:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	You can just go to the synaptic and install it from there, cause if you install it from the CD its gunna take ever longer
2006-10-04T07:00:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	Then you can just switch from Gnome or KDE through the GDM
2006-10-04T07:01:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	alright its downloading, probably will be done in 10 years
2006-10-04T07:01:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	by the way, if you hold your mouse over a person in Kopete, and there is no buddy icon, it means they are on the phone
2006-10-04T07:02:00.000Z	keegan_	ellioTb	Is that so...hm I might switch over...
2006-10-04T07:02:00.000Z	ellioTb	keegan_	yeah, just figured it out, still a little bit annoying, but atleast you can tell b4 you message
