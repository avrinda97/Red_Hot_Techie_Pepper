2007-10-11T14:42:00.000Z	arbi11		hi guys, where can i find tips and tweaks to make X faster?
2007-10-11T14:42:00.000Z	arbi11		been at it the whole afternoon but can't find any
2007-10-11T14:42:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	check the gentoo wiki, those guys always claim to get everything faster ;)
2007-10-11T14:44:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	it doesn't matter. Xorg is Xorg (and there were IIRC no significant changes between the last versions that would cause some new configuration options)
2007-10-11T14:46:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	 ok.  what about that thing that Redhat did before (or was it Fedora?), where the ran X way early in the boot up stage
2007-10-11T14:46:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	what is the disadvantage of doing it?
2007-10-11T14:47:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	this will only cause windows some behaviour like windows - a system that claims to be running but is still booting. (you do this by changing the order your init scripts are executed)
2007-10-11T14:48:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	my concern is that i'm on a laptop and continued hibernation in Linux ain't perfect... especially if i change from 1 wireless network to anothe
2007-10-11T14:48:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	an booting takes too long...
2007-10-11T14:49:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	with X  taking up a lot of time to come up
2007-10-11T14:49:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	just don't start every service you don't need ;)
2007-10-11T14:49:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	done that already... and user switchin is another concern too.  it's too slow.
2007-10-11T14:50:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	what is your hardware?
2007-10-11T14:51:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	sorry but this one can not be slow...
2007-10-11T14:51:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	what do you mean?  it is slow
2007-10-11T14:51:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	misconfiguration
2007-10-11T14:51:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	it's a default install
2007-10-11T14:52:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	ok what are the implications if i change X to start earlier in the boot stage? disastrous?
2007-10-11T14:53:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	so that the WM don't have to wait for X to start  and it can just go do it's business once it's called... or at least that's the way i see it
2007-10-11T14:54:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	if you have a running X and all other services like network-manager are not running you have nothing
2007-10-11T14:55:00.000Z	arbi11	FallenHitokiri	well considering that the preReqs are there already... is it viable?
2007-10-11T14:56:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	arbi11	you will not get much but a little bit
