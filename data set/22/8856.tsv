2005-05-05T05:34:00.000Z	optikal		I just installed 'linux-image-686-smp' package for my Dual P3/600 box.. is it accurate that if I cat /proc/cpuinfo it only says '1' under Processors?
2005-05-05T05:35:00.000Z	optikal		anyone have the clue on my dual proc question?
2005-05-05T05:36:00.000Z	optikal		oh lord. grow up

2005-05-05T05:37:00.000Z	decaf	optikal	after reboot, no
2005-05-05T05:38:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	yeah, i did reboot.  if i display what kernel im running under, should it be appended by smp, like the package name?
2005-05-05T05:38:00.000Z	decaf	optikal	it should be
2005-05-05T05:39:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	okay, how can i display what kernel im running under? =)
2005-05-05T05:39:00.000Z	decaf		2.6.11-1-k7
2005-05-05T05:39:00.000Z	decaf	optikal	that is mine. try uname -a
2005-05-05T05:40:00.000Z	optikal		2.6.10-5-686-smp..
2005-05-05T05:40:00.000Z	optikal		And it does detect both processors in bios and upon post.
2005-05-05T05:40:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	any idea what i can check from here? or maybe a document to read up on this?
2005-05-05T05:41:00.000Z	decaf	optikal	you should see two same stanzas in /proc/cpuinfo now
2005-05-05T05:42:00.000Z	decaf	optikal	one for "processor 0" and one for "processor 1"
2005-05-05T05:43:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	wow.. i feel like a idiot now.. its actually displaying both procs, first proc is Processor: 0, but when it display it, my window is sized perfectly so that i cannot even see 1 line from the first processors info output.
2005-05-05T05:43:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	thanks for the help tho. =)
2005-05-05T05:44:00.000Z	decaf	optikal	yw. many things start from 0 at unix and C
2005-05-05T05:44:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	If you dont mind, one more real fast question.. whats the best cpu load monitoring tool for dual proc? is gdesklets suitable?
2005-05-05T05:45:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	yeah, thats why i feel like an idiot as well.. i should have realized that fact.
2005-05-05T05:46:00.000Z	decaf	optikal	:)). I personally dont trust eye candy apps. therefore I dont recommend gdesklets for monitoring. but you should try.
2005-05-05T05:48:00.000Z	optikal	decaf	i just like a visual based graphs of current and previous loads.. and it provides that, so.. i dont know of a better one.  what cpu load monitor do you recommend?
