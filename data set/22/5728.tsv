2007-03-09T15:14:00.000Z	blind		oh. well then we do not share a common interest.
2007-03-09T15:14:00.000Z	blind		i wonder why it wouldn't display out to a monitor, but it does to a TV, though.
2007-03-09T15:15:00.000Z	blind		most routers use an IP addres starting with 192.168 (at least linksys and netgear do)
2007-03-09T15:16:00.000Z	blind		linksys? :] 
2007-03-09T15:16:00.000Z	blind		no, 100
2007-03-09T15:17:00.000Z	blind		dvi-vga, perhaps?
2007-03-09T15:17:00.000Z	blind		to work how you want it? perhaps.
2007-03-09T15:17:00.000Z	blind		ah, okay
2007-03-09T15:18:00.000Z	blind		I've been googling and googling, and asking here. Haven't received anything here, yet though, and very little googling.
2007-03-09T15:20:00.000Z	blind		guess it did, Jowi :P

2007-03-09T15:24:00.000Z	blind	grusomhat_	both the TV and the monitor are off the same card, correct?
2007-03-09T15:26:00.000Z	grusomhat_	blind	Jowi: still no lucj
2007-03-09T15:28:00.000Z	grusomhat_	blind	Is there anywhere I can make sure it's set to 32 bit?

2007-03-09T15:37:00.000Z	blind	grusomhat_	if it is a driver issue, then it is fixable after you install ubuntu. you just install the binary drivers.
