2012-01-12T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	what make and model?
2012-01-12T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	doesn't answer my question....
2012-01-12T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	one more time, what make and model is the printer?
2012-01-12T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	what model is it?
2012-01-12T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	why did I have to ask you FOUR times?
2012-01-12T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	what is the output of: lsb_release -sc; uname -a
2012-01-12T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	and the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-01-12T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	cool, 32bit makes life easier
2012-01-12T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	http://paste.ubuntu.com/801938/
2012-01-12T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	you need the driver deb, then the cupswraper deb
2012-01-12T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	you need both for it to work. I recommend you install both files and delete any printers you tried to install, then reboot and it will detect and install it
2012-01-12T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	if you ask a question with no details, expect some questions back which you need to fill for us to help you and having to repeat ask is a little annoying ;)
2012-01-12T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	sweet
2012-01-12T22:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	could disconnect and reconnect
2012-01-12T22:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	you get the idea though, you need both files installing from the site
2012-01-12T22:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	sudo mkdir -p /var/spool/lpd/MFC210C
2012-01-12T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	its how the drivers are, brother make them
2012-01-12T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	if the folder doesn't exist (if you read the output) then you would have known to make the folder yourself to humour it
2012-01-12T22:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	the second file borked for some reason, but you know the site to go to, so you can grab it#
2012-01-12T22:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	because the driver database needed would be collossol
2012-01-12T22:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	msterbrewer	3G modems do that, causes all kinds of annoyance in Linux
