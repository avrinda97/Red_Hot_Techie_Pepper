2009-07-13T00:35:00.000Z	y7deluxe		i have 3 computers behind a switch. ubuntu (192.168.1.101) windows XP (.102) and windowsXP (.105) my ubuntu machine can ping .102 but it cannot ping .105... yet my 102 machine can ping .101 and .105.... and my router detects all three. what could be causing my ubuntu machine to not be able to ping .105?
2009-07-13T00:36:00.000Z	y7deluxe		yessir
2009-07-13T00:36:00.000Z	y7deluxe		my router is 192.168.1.1
2009-07-13T00:37:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	is the windows firewall turned on for .102?
2009-07-13T00:38:00.000Z	y7deluxe		youseenothing, it's turned off for both, .102 and .105
2009-07-13T00:38:00.000Z	y7deluxe	jerroome	let me go try. one second
2009-07-13T00:39:00.000Z	y7deluxe	jerroome	i was wrong about .102 being able to ping .105... i cannot ping .105, but my router detects it.
2009-07-13T00:40:00.000Z	y7deluxe		alright, i'll work on it. thanks for the help
2009-07-13T00:40:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	the ubuntu iptables rules would not by default block icmp replies
2009-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	if your linux box can ping 102 (winxp) but can't with 105 (winxp) i would check firewall first
2009-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	firewall on the 105 machine
2009-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	y7deluxe	jerroome	my ubuntu (.101) and windowsXP (.102) can ping each other.... my other windowsXP machine (.105) cannot be pinged by either of them.... but it can ping my router (192.168.1.1)
2009-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	because you said that 102 can't ping it either
2009-07-13T00:41:00.000Z	y7deluxe		youseenothing, it's disabled... i promise
2009-07-13T00:42:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	can your 105 machine ping 101?
2009-07-13T00:42:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	and windows is known for turning the firewall back on after a reboot for updates
2009-07-13T00:42:00.000Z	y7deluxe		youseenothing, i'll go test now.... gonna need a minute since i usually vnc into the machine... i gotta hook up a keyboard... the machine that usually vnc's into .105 is .100(but it's down right now due to hardware failures)
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	ok...and please make sure that the firewall is off and didn't suddenly get enabled
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	for my sanity!
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	youseenothing_		ha!
2009-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	and why wouldn't you be able to vnc in from any other machine on your network?
2009-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	youseenothing_	y7deluxe	unless there are firewall rules blocking on 105
