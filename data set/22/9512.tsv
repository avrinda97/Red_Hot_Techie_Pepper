2005-02-04T06:36:00.000Z	William_Cain		The error I get is:
2005-02-04T06:36:00.000Z	William_Cain		The Application "gnome-background-properties" has quit unexpectedly.
2005-02-04T06:37:00.000Z	William_Cain		I sometimes make things in 3D Studio Max, but I'm mainly a programmer, so it's not my favourite area.
2005-02-04T06:38:00.000Z	William_Cain		Windows?
2005-02-04T06:38:00.000Z	William_Cain		If I understand your question right, then yes, I use Windows. Windows XP to be precise.
2005-02-04T06:39:00.000Z	William_Cain		Windows 2000 too, actually.
2005-02-04T06:39:00.000Z	William_Cain		Yes, it does.
2005-02-04T06:41:00.000Z	William_Cain		So, can I reinstall it or something?
2005-02-04T06:42:00.000Z	William_Cain		Is he a god of some sort?
2005-02-04T06:44:00.000Z	William_Cain		My problem persists. Does anyone know how I can, say, reinstall the "gnome-background-properties" program?
2005-02-04T06:44:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	that probably wont help
2005-02-04T06:45:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	just open a terminal and type "gnome-background-properties"
2005-02-04T06:47:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	did you do this in a terminal?
2005-02-04T06:48:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	no, NOT the popup box.. IN the terminal!
2005-02-04T06:50:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	you could try moving/renaming/deleting the file ~./gnome2/backgrounds.xml as it may be b0rked
2005-02-04T06:51:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	move or rename it
2005-02-04T06:55:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	is it still crashing
2005-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	did you try moving the xml file out?
2005-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	in your home directory there is a directory called .gnome2
2005-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	edit --> preferences -->
2005-02-04T07:01:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	no problem
2005-02-04T07:13:00.000Z	popey	William_Cain	unlucky :D
