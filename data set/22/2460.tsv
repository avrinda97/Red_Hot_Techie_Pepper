2009-07-10T02:20:00.000Z	deany	edbian	he was just commenting on the lack of nautilus option in "connect to server"
2009-07-10T02:21:00.000Z	deany	edbian	which I agree with.. why not, its got samba there.
2009-07-10T02:21:00.000Z	edbian	deany	I know.  I think there should be one as well.  I was just making sure you guys knew how to use it :)
2009-07-10T02:21:00.000Z	deany	edbian	I used to know.. I forgot it been so long
2009-07-10T02:22:00.000Z	deany	edbian	i know its /etc/exports but the actual parameters are gobbledegook to me now
2009-07-10T02:22:00.000Z	edbian	deany	Bookman there is JFTP in the repos.  I just did a search and found it.  "Graphical network and file transfer client"
2009-08-06T20:03:00.000Z	edbian	deany	What does "ssh-copy-id" do?
2009-08-31T01:34:00.000Z	deany	edbian	its a metacity effect.. compiz could affect it tho.
2009-08-31T01:34:00.000Z	deany	edbian	what gfx you using?
2009-08-31T01:34:00.000Z	edbian	deany	Can I turn it off in gconf-editor?
2009-08-31T01:34:00.000Z	edbian	deany	What is a gfx?
2009-08-31T01:34:00.000Z	deany	edbian	graphic chip
2009-08-31T01:36:00.000Z	edbian	deany	Ati Radeon 9550
2009-08-31T01:36:00.000Z	edbian	deany	I'm using the radeon module (radeonfb)
2009-08-31T01:37:00.000Z	deany	edbian	quite an old card, might be the radeon open source driver.
2009-08-31T01:37:00.000Z	deany	edbian	I have a faster ati (9800) but am relegated to using the open source radeon driver, which is fine for compiz but useless for any decent game.
2009-08-31T01:38:00.000Z	edbian	deany	I'm going to try to turn of that little fade effect and see what happens.  I'll let you know.
2009-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	deany	edbian	that fade effect is also there when changing wallpapers
2009-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	deany	edbian	try that.
2009-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	edbian	deany	I have a small confession to make.  Don't tell anyone but I'm actually using debian :P.  I don't have that wallpaper transition effect.
2009-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	deany	edbian	well, 1 wallpaper fades into another.. so not quite the same, its a compiz effect I think
2009-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	edbian	deany	I have seen it.
