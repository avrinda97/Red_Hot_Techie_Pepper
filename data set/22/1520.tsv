2010-10-16T16:14:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	i am experiencing this problem since last 1 year
2010-10-16T16:14:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	that's rather... wrong. what's staying behind?

2010-10-16T16:18:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	TMPTIME=0 in /etc/default/rcS
2010-10-16T16:21:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	o.O
2010-10-16T16:21:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	why doesn't TMPTIME=0 doesn't work?
2010-10-16T16:22:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	don't know, try the rc.local suggestion
2010-10-16T16:23:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	so what do you use? fluxbox? :)
2010-10-16T16:23:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	heck no :)
2010-10-16T16:24:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	ForgeAus: keep in mind, I compile E17 by hand
2010-10-16T16:25:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	rc.local solution is kinda workaround... i want to find out why TMPTIME=0 not working
2010-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	I'm not seeing the problem anywhere, you might want to post it to ubuntuforums.org
2010-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	ok
2010-10-17T12:44:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	sudo -i would be better than sudo su
2010-10-17T12:45:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	but it also prompts for a password
2010-10-17T12:46:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	of course it does
2010-10-17T12:46:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	i want to get rid of prompt
2010-10-17T12:49:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	are you trying to run a different window manager with the xterm, or do you prefer it as a launch point?
2010-10-17T12:49:00.000Z	Gnea	greenmang0	mis-type
2010-10-17T12:50:00.000Z	greenmang0	Gnea	errr :)
