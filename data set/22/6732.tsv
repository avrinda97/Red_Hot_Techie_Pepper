2006-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	rast4		ok who's a Samba guru :( I can't get it to work and I've read step-by-steps, docs, manuals, etc
2006-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	rast4		still a no go
2006-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	rast4		I have that link
2006-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	rast4		that's what I was referring to
2006-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	rast4		I appreciate that though, but I can't get it to work after reading the latter link
2006-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	what does not work?
2006-08-16T13:11:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	i've read that swat needs a lot of config, but first you need samba to work properly
2006-08-16T13:12:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	can you connect to it from another computer?
2006-08-16T13:13:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	first try to connect from the windows machines
2006-08-16T13:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	have you set the same workgroup as the windows machines
2006-08-16T13:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	is samba started 'sudo /etc/init.d/samba start'
2006-08-16T13:14:00.000Z	rast4	KenSentMe	yes
2006-08-16T13:15:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	check this page for more about installing swat http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=58434
2006-08-16T13:15:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	first make sure samba works and then worry about swat
2006-08-16T13:16:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	now try one of your windows pc's
2006-08-16T13:17:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	type hostname
2006-08-16T13:18:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	nice, that means samba is running and working in some way
2006-08-16T13:20:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	i think with windows clients it's best to have the same username and password as the windows user that is connecting
2006-08-16T13:21:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	it's too
2006-08-16T13:22:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	but i remember that that doesn't work all the time. I had problems with connect windows users and i only managed to get it running by using the exact user and pass
2006-08-16T13:24:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	use sudo smbpasswd etc.
2006-08-16T13:26:00.000Z	KenSentMe	rast4	first maybe you should restart samba 'sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart'
