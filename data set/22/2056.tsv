2010-10-17T23:04:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	You can remove any package you like! :)
2011-03-06T05:10:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	What is your question about gparted?
2011-03-06T05:11:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	Does it have an orange triangle next to it?
2011-03-06T05:11:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	Is it in an extended partition with another partition that is mounted?
2011-03-06T05:12:00.000Z	Pilif12p	edbian	Nope, and nope
2011-03-06T05:13:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	What kind of partition?  Can you screenshot the app?  I assume the resize / move is greyed out
2011-03-06T05:13:00.000Z	Pilif12p	edbian	no, it's not. I get an error (I linked to details twice in the past 2 minutes). It's ntfs, i believe
2011-03-06T05:14:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	I'm reading the errors right now.  Unfortunately they're rather vague
2011-03-06T05:15:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	Look at the very end of your post.  Have you tried booting and shutting down proper in windows?
2011-03-06T05:16:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	It says there was an unclean shutdown.  Your partition btw are a mess
2011-03-06T05:27:00.000Z	Pilif12p	edbian	I know, but I have no idea what most of them are fore
2011-03-06T05:27:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	Are you talking about the partitions?
2011-03-06T05:28:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	:)  Well you do NOT need 2 swaps :)
2011-03-06T05:28:00.000Z	Pilif12p	edbian	I'm looking for a new hard drive, but I don't know that I *need* one
2011-03-06T05:29:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	You do not.  The one you have is mostly empty
2011-03-06T05:30:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	You should delete one of the swaps (one is bigger than the other) and the unallocated space is a waste.
2011-03-06T05:31:00.000Z	Pilif12p	edbian	What is swap for?
2011-03-06T05:31:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	Swap is used when RAM is filled up (simplified explanation) or for hibernation
2011-03-06T05:32:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	yep.  Nothing is stored on there permanently
2011-03-06T05:32:00.000Z	edbian	Pilif12p	I have 1Gb of ram and I never dip into swap.
