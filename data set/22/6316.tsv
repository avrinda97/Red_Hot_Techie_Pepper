2006-11-12T08:02:00.000Z	chaoslynx		I need to remove a package to upgrade to edgy... i tried hard to remove it with apt get but it wouldnt work... now i want that the package managers ignore the package i.e. that it doesnt appear in the list anymore can somebody help me to let this happen =)?
2006-11-12T08:04:00.000Z	chaoslynx		i need somebodies help to remove a package without using the package manager because those wouldnt work....
2006-11-12T08:05:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	what package?  Can you pastebin the error you get? Have you tried using dpkg?
2006-11-12T08:08:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	can you pastebin the error messages you are getting?
2006-11-12T08:08:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	I am quite sure it wouldnt help but i can yes...
2006-11-12T08:10:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	here it is one of several attempshttp://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31214/
2006-11-12T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	pastebin
2006-11-12T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	pastebin /var/lib/dpkg/info/spring-basedata.postrm
2006-11-12T08:11:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	ok one moment
2006-11-12T08:12:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	damn this folder is full =)
2006-11-12T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	you can also try creating the /usr/share/spring/mods directory yourself and rerunning it.  Since it seems that was your last error
2006-11-12T08:13:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	the problem is the basedata removing causes spring/mods to be removed...
2006-11-12T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	so if you create it, you get back to the postrm error?
2006-11-12T08:15:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	k, we can probably edit the postrm script
2006-11-12T08:16:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	do you know if you had any package that provided that command?  (spring-modupdate)
2006-11-12T08:16:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	i had a package called spring scripts but not spring mod update
2006-11-12T08:17:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	here is the paste of  /var/lib/dpkg/info/spring-basedata.postrm http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31215/
2006-11-12T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	and you are certain that the scripts package didn't provide mod-update?
2006-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	scripts is installed at the moment
2006-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	well you see your postrm?  Just tell it not to run spring-modupdate
2006-11-12T08:19:00.000Z	chaoslynx	jrib	ok i have to delete one line and then run it again and it will work?
2006-11-12T08:20:00.000Z	jrib	chaoslynx	maybe, I'm not sure if bash complains about case statements that are empty.  You could just tell it to run 'true', or find out if it matters taht it is empty
