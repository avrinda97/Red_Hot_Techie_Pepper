2011-10-30T08:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	try /usr/share/pixmaps/
2011-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	Gskellig	zykotick9	theres no google chrome in pixmaps
2011-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	did you install with a DEB?  "dpkg -L NAME_OF_GOOGLE_CHROME" for a list of what it installed.
2011-10-30T09:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	it'll work then
2011-10-30T09:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	actually /opt makes sense (i should have thought of that)
2011-10-30T09:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	probably the only thing you've installed from outside of Ubuntu ;)
2011-10-30T09:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	and why use chrome when there is chromium?  Like being tracked do you?
2011-10-30T09:05:00.000Z	Gskellig	zykotick9	whats the difference?
2011-10-30T09:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	google-chome is older version, and includes google tracking stuff.
2012-02-01T01:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	a umask of 022 would accomplish that i believe (but don't take my word for it)
2012-02-01T01:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	that should give you 755 as default permission then (i forgot about the Special one in front)
2012-02-01T01:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	umask is a subtraction from 777 full permission
2012-02-08T11:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	there is a command called tac
2012-02-14T13:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	how did you create the user?
2012-02-14T13:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	i can't help.  In future you might want to try "adduser" instead
2012-02-14T13:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	using adduser will setup users properly
2012-02-14T13:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	"permission denied" that's not a password issue.  Do you have userallow in /etc/ssh/sshd_config?
2012-02-14T13:45:00.000Z	Gskellig	zykotick9	"Allowusers root user1"
2012-02-14T13:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	did you just add user1?  you'd need to restart ssh for that to take effect
2012-02-14T13:46:00.000Z	Gskellig	zykotick9	that must be it
2012-02-14T13:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	i mean, did you just add user1 to that sshd_config file?
2012-02-14T13:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	Gskellig	"sudo service ssh restart" should work (i don't believe it will disconnect you, but not 100%)
