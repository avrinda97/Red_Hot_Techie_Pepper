2005-05-01T12:55:00.000Z	AcidWolf		i backed up some of my files that i had on Os X before i installed ubuntu on my powerbook but i cant seem to get ubuntu to read my backups
2005-05-01T12:55:00.000Z	AcidWolf		any ideas
2005-05-01T12:56:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	emm what format are the backups in?
2005-05-01T12:56:00.000Z	AcidWolf		thats the thing i cant even view the files on the disk
2005-05-01T12:56:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	what extention have they got?
2005-05-01T12:57:00.000Z	AcidWolf		i know what you mean ompaul but what im saying is i dont even get that far
2005-05-01T12:57:00.000Z	AcidWolf		i cant access the cd
2005-05-01T12:57:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	that reads like ooch
2005-05-01T12:58:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	did you check them before you installed the happiest operating system of them all?
2005-05-01T12:58:00.000Z	AcidWolf		oh ok
2005-05-01T12:58:00.000Z	AcidWolf	ompaul	yes i accessed them through Osx and they worked
2005-05-01T12:59:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	okay so (A) reinstall os/x and create tarballs / gz archives - and ignore any local "i can back up your data for you" type offers
2005-05-01T13:00:00.000Z	AcidWolf		im not blowing away an entire system
2005-05-01T13:00:00.000Z	AcidWolf		O_o
2005-05-01T13:00:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	okay so (B) find someone with os/x and get them out onto a drive and off like I suggest
2005-05-01T13:00:00.000Z	AcidWolf		ok that sounds like a better idea
2005-05-01T13:00:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	well both are reasonable but will cost some amount of time
2005-05-01T13:01:00.000Z	AcidWolf		or i could get a Mac emulator
2005-05-01T13:01:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	there is that
2005-05-01T13:01:00.000Z	AcidWolf		aha
2005-05-01T13:01:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	but tbh will it do the same file format?
2005-05-01T13:02:00.000Z	ompaul	AcidWolf	now you have learnt the badness of closed formats grasshopper :)
