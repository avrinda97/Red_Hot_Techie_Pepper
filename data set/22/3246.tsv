2008-11-01T20:31:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Hi. I just attempted to upgrade to 8.10. It appeared to succeed. But now whenever I boot it up, my splash screen is gone, and it gives me some error about my /home partition, "can't find fsck.ext3", and drops me to a root shell prompt. If i exit the prompt, it resumes boot, but I don't login. I don't want to login if something's wrong with my /home. I'm in my custom Hardy LiveDVD right now, and my home partition appears to be fine. What shoul
2008-11-01T20:31:00.000Z	[TiZ]		d I do to make my 8.10 realize that?
2008-11-01T20:32:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	can you mount your / partition? and cat the file /etc/fstab
2008-11-01T20:33:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	I can mount / just fine. Should I cat /etc/fstab and pastebin it, or...?
2008-11-01T20:34:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	I actually had the exact same problem after my upgrade. but I didn't look into the problem more deeply.  I should have lol might still be able to help though
2008-11-01T20:34:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	Okay. Forgot to install pastebinit on my liveDVD, so...
2008-11-01T20:35:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	well you can just go to pastebin online is fine.
2008-11-01T20:36:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	You're having the same problem too? With a /home partition? I mean... can you actually still use it? Anyways, pastebin here: http://pastebin.com/f19e541bf
2008-11-01T20:36:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	well I was having the same problem. but rather than troubleshoot it I just did a clean install. one sec
2008-11-01T20:37:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	Oh, I see. I'll do that if I can't fix it then. I was considering a switch to 64-bit ubuntu anyways...
2008-11-01T20:38:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	if you run gparted and look at the partitons is the /dev/hda7 your /home?
2008-11-01T20:39:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	I remember specifically that gparted messed up the order of my partition table, but it didn't really seem to hurt anything.
2008-11-01T20:39:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	So in case you missed it 'cos I didn't blink you, yes, /dev/hda7 is my /home. :)
2008-11-01T20:42:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	well yes. but I want to verify that /dev/hda7 still = /home.  IE it could be that after the upgrade for some reason the /dev/hda7 changed to /dev/hdaX and now ubuntu can't find the /home
2008-11-01T20:43:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	I see. Well, that part's still good.
2008-11-01T20:44:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	run df and pastebin it
2008-11-01T20:46:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	http://pastebin.com/f769270dc I don't think it will be much help. Again, I'm currently in my custom LiveDVD.
2008-11-01T20:47:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	okay. so if you go to /media/disk-1 and do an ls this is your home stuff correct?
2008-11-01T20:48:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	I don't need to ls. I can just open it in nautilus. :P I'm absolutely positive it's my home.
2008-11-01T20:48:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	okay well that works as well.  well that's my only idea really. cause it does seem to be mapped correctly. doh!
2008-11-01T20:49:00.000Z	[TiZ]	kalosaurusrex1	Well darn. Thanks for trying, though. :D
2008-11-01T20:50:00.000Z	kalosaurusrex1	[TiZ]	sure sorry I couldn't help more!
