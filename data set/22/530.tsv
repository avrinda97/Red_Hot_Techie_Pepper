2011-11-15T09:50:00.000Z	ramadan		Hello, I have an HP Pavillion dv6233se and the latest version of ubuntu 11.10. I can't seem to get my wireless card working. I've tried quite a few things from the forums with no luck. can anyone help?
2011-11-15T09:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	do you know the card?
2011-11-15T09:51:00.000Z	ramadan		The website says it's an 802.11b/g wlan
2011-11-15T09:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	this command will tell you exactly.  lspci | grep -i wireless
2011-11-15T09:53:00.000Z	ramadan	urlin2u	the command returns nothing, even with sudo
2011-11-15T09:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	copy and paste it it works.
2011-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	unless the card is not being read.
2011-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	ramadan		i think that may be the case. I copied and pasted with ctrl + shift +v
2011-11-15T09:56:00.000Z	ramadan	urlin2u	any other way I could find out what kind of card it is?
2011-11-15T09:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	that isolates the card lspci part of that command would show other hardware as well, I see problems on the web with that card just stopping working, as it before?
2011-11-15T09:58:00.000Z	urlin2u		has*
2011-11-15T10:01:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	anyway hard to say for me without a card name/type,maybe others will have an idea.
2011-11-15T10:01:00.000Z	ramadan	urlin2u	yeah, it worked fine on windows, and on a few older releases of ubuntu. I also got it to work with one of the forum methods, but it stopped working after restart and I haven't been able to replicate the results. I think I've done too many things.
2011-11-15T10:02:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	does broadcom sound familiar, with alll that tweaking you ddidn't isolate the actual card?
2011-11-15T10:03:00.000Z	ramadan	urlin2u	yes, broadcom does sound familiar. I wish the HP website gave me some more specific info than just 802.11b/g WLAN
2011-11-15T10:03:00.000Z	urlin2u		!broadcom | ramadan
2011-11-15T10:03:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	try looking at tyhe wiki.
2011-11-15T10:03:00.000Z	urlin2u		the*
2011-11-15T10:07:00.000Z	ramadan	urlin2u	I've tried that. any chance I could have done too many tweaks and they're all fighting each other... if that makes sense?
2011-11-15T10:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	I would not really know I have not had to mess with those cards if that is what you have,  would post on the ubuntu forums as well and include as much info as possible.
2011-11-15T10:10:00.000Z	ramadan	urlin2u	thank you for your help and patience
2011-11-15T10:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	ramadan	no problem.
