2005-05-12T15:52:00.000Z	bijin		@anyone...know how to configure Wine with an unwriteable ntfs partition?
2005-05-12T15:53:00.000Z	bijin		Wine says unable to grep a file on the ntfs partition
2005-05-12T15:53:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	does wine have read privilages to your ntfs partition?
2005-05-12T15:57:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	I'm reading the man page for chmod for you
2005-05-12T15:59:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	try chmod -R o+r <ntfs directory>
2005-05-12T16:00:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	yes, that will give read privilages to everyone
2005-05-13T16:00:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	everyone that's a valid user of your system that is
2005-05-13T16:01:00.000Z	bijin	anto9us	this won't screw anything up will it?
2005-05-13T16:01:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	it shouldn't do, no
2005-05-13T16:02:00.000Z	bijin	anto9us	after every line it says :Read only file system - is that okay?
2005-05-13T16:03:00.000Z	bijin	anto9us	any other ideas?
2005-05-13T16:04:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	try wine again, it will have changed permission on the folder, which is what is important
2005-05-13T16:16:00.000Z	bijin	anto9us	I tried running Wine again but no go.
2005-05-13T16:17:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	what are you trying to do?
2005-05-13T16:17:00.000Z	bijin	anto9us	Wine config is exiting with an error...
2005-05-13T16:18:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	there are native linux alternatives to that I think
2005-05-13T16:19:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	type search dvd in synaptic
2005-05-13T16:21:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	you may find it's a process that takes several steps/applications
2005-05-13T16:24:00.000Z	bijin	anto9us	how do I know the device location of my DVD burner?
2005-05-13T16:30:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	I don't know
2005-05-13T16:31:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	you could try /dev/cdrom0
2005-05-13T16:31:00.000Z	anto9us	bijin	sorry /dev/cdrom
