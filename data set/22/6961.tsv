2008-06-01T19:47:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks, I'll check the web page.  Didn't expect to have issues with a non-restricted format like Ogg.
2008-06-01T19:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	Agreed
2008-06-01T19:49:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	Hey! That web page doesn't say how to play Ogg files. :P  My Ubuntu came with the ability to play mp3's but not Ogg!?
2008-06-01T19:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	What distro are you using.. clearly not ubuntu
2008-06-01T19:50:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	Kubuntu 7.04 Feisty, currently up to date.
2008-06-01T19:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	in a term   type lsb_release -a
2008-06-01T19:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	No version of kubuntu plays mp3s out of the box
2008-06-01T19:51:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	Would it play ogg out of the box?  If not, what do I do to get it to play ogg?  Btw, result of "lsb_release -a" is: No LSB modules are available. / Distributor ID: Ubuntu / Description:    Ubuntu 7.04 / Release:        7.04 / Codename:       feisty
2008-06-01T19:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	It should have played ogg and not mp3's
2008-06-01T19:53:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	Funny.  I brought over the autoconfig file from my previous installation, so I guess that's where it installed the mp3's.  But I didn't take anything away, unless installing mp3 support takes away ogg ability...
2008-06-01T19:54:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	I tried looking in Adept for packages containing the word "ogg" but didn't know which one to install that would help me. :(
2008-06-01T19:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	It should not have removed anything..  but it could have a conflict somewhere...
2008-06-01T19:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	Gimme a sec to read up..
2008-06-01T19:54:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	So I guess one place to start would be the mp3 packages and see if I can find what it conflicts with?
2008-06-01T19:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	sudo apt-get install amarok-xine libxine1 libxine-main1 libxine-extracodecs libogg0 liboggflac++2c2 liboggflac3 libvorbis0a libvorbisenc2 libvorbisfile3 vorbis-tools vorbisgain flac

2008-06-01T19:57:00.000Z	kwtm	Jack_Sparrow	thanks, will see which pkgs I'm missing. (Or be lazy and apt-get install them and let apt-get sort it all out.)
2008-06-01T19:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	Shoot them all and let the ogg gods sort it out
2008-06-01T20:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kwtm	Might save you a dep problem later
