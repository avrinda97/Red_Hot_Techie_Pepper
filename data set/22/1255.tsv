2010-07-31T06:05:00.000Z	smackmanic		is there a lighter version of the livedisk...im using an ancient machine and for the life of me can't free up enough space to download the liveusb
2010-07-31T06:05:00.000Z	smackmanic		(can't get ubuntu running, won't mount it for some reason...so i need something that will allow me to sudo-apt and what not)
2010-07-31T06:06:00.000Z	smackmanic		happened after i updated
2010-07-31T06:06:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	lubuntu? gnome/ubuntu live cd is a bit less than 700MB
2010-07-31T06:06:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	or you could get the 12MB minimal iso and build from there
2010-07-31T06:07:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	i can sudo apt and what not with the min?
2010-07-31T06:07:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	yep of course
2010-07-31T06:08:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	one more question....i can follow the instructions to boot it from a usb device instead of a cd ? or is the .iso specifically designed for cds..
2010-07-31T06:09:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	the lubuntu iso? try unetbootin to write to flash key
2010-07-31T06:10:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	you running ubuntu now? or windows
2010-07-31T06:10:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	unetbootin is in the repos, for windows its at unetbootin.sourceforge.net
2010-07-31T06:11:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	im in the windows partition, it drops me straight to busybox when i allow ubuntu to attempt to start up
2010-07-31T06:11:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	okay unet is the tool that will make that min iso work on the usb
2010-07-31T06:12:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	minimal iso? never known it to do that, I was referring to lubuntu iso minimal still requires a cd to boot afaik
2010-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	ouch...you're saying I can't use a usb device to....basically sudo apt grub...or figure out whats going on with my OS
2010-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	why not fix your current situation instead of reinstalling a new system
2010-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	i'm not trying to reinstall the OS
2010-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	just trying to figure out what the h is up with it. heh
2010-07-31T06:14:00.000Z	bazhang	smackmanic	checked in grub menu? hold shift at boot
2010-07-31T06:44:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	i found a thread with my exact problem..i need to edit what grub is booting..apparently it's a common bug...umm..i edited it to /dev/sda1, that didnt work, then tried sda2. i'm doing something wrong...would you mind if i sent you the link or /msg you the supposed solution
2010-07-31T07:28:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	still struggling lol
2010-07-31T07:30:00.000Z	smackmanic	bazhang	any suggestions?
