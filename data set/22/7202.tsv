2006-08-09T13:03:00.000Z	syke		it seems like I need to downgrade libc or something
2006-08-09T13:04:00.000Z	syke		I just can't find any infoz on this virtual package and how it works
2006-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	syke		yes
2006-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	syke		guh. if I reinstall, it's back to gentoo
2006-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	syke		how would I downgrade libc6?
2006-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	syke		I'm a little confused by the fact that it says 6.3.x rather than 2.3.x or 2.4.x
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		I just need to know what i need to do to satisfy this dependency: libapt-pkg-libc6.3-6-3.11
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		I have manually re-installed apt, dpkg, etc, etc with manual downloads and dpkg -i
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		still no dice
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		libc6 seems like the next step, but I wanted to make sure first
2006-08-09T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	what package requires that?
2006-08-09T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	What are you trying to do?  Synaptic and adept should already be installed
2006-08-09T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	do you have the web repositories enabled?
2006-08-09T13:12:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	aye
2006-08-09T13:12:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	and have you updated your apt-cache after doing that?
2006-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	you shouldn't have had to manually install anything, unless something isn't working correctly
2006-08-09T13:15:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	can you pastebin your sources.list?
2006-08-09T13:17:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	ah.  Well, that explains it ;)  Edgy isn't even alpha yet
2007-03-26T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	Oddly, I believe Feisty ought to have 3.2.2, but, 3.2.1 isn't too terrible.  Someone mustve overlooked it.
2007-03-26T16:25:00.000Z	syke	Flannel	ok, cool. should I file a bug, or..?
2007-03-26T16:27:00.000Z	Flannel	syke	Feisty is already in version freeze, so no.  I don't think there's anything you can do.
2007-03-26T16:29:00.000Z	syke	Flannel	okay, I'll see if my Canonical support person can help :)
