2007-10-08T08:06:00.000Z	binary64		hi all :) in bash, if i wget, and it fails, how can i do an if-then-else block to detect its failure?
2007-10-08T08:08:00.000Z	binary64		seveas: how? i wondered the same
2007-10-08T08:09:00.000Z	binary64		ah
2007-10-08T08:09:00.000Z	binary64		imho it's not a preference, but a view mode..
2007-10-08T08:09:00.000Z	binary64		:D
2007-10-08T08:10:00.000Z	binary64		when i develop in notepad on windows, i always swap between. annoyingly though, in notepad, after toggling, it jumps to first line :(
2007-10-08T08:10:00.000Z	binary64		why would it be ignored?
2007-10-08T08:11:00.000Z	binary64		cos i'm not IBM? <grin>
2007-10-08T08:11:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	gnome has a bit of a habit/reputation of ignoring feature requests :)
2007-10-08T08:12:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	kde is the opposite, it has featuritis
2007-10-08T08:12:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	and I love taking potshots at both of them ;)
2007-10-08T08:13:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	no, that would be emacs :D
2007-10-08T08:36:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	you shouldn't do that
2007-10-08T08:37:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	annoying but safe
2007-10-08T08:37:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	protection against malwate
2007-10-08T08:37:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	sure it can but that's no reason to drop all barriers
2007-10-08T08:39:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	and linux is also more secure by not running things as root that don't need to be run as root :)
2007-10-08T08:39:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	then Ubuntu still cares :)
2007-10-08T08:40:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	in short, we prefer not to help people shooting themselves in the foot. But nobody will stop you from doing it
2007-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	by deleting a few files that are quite necessary for instance
2007-10-08T08:42:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	that's possible but so stupid I will not tell you how. Sorry, but footshooting is one bridge too far for me
2007-10-08T08:44:00.000Z	Seveas	binary64	and when it breaks you'll blame Ubuntu. That's what I want to prevent
