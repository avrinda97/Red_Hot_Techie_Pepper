2005-12-18T11:24:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		Hi from a total oooohbuntu user. I'm doing the live cd for the first time tonight.
2005-12-18T11:25:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		so far so good, thundr
2005-12-18T11:25:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		it found my all in one printer and scanner, my pda, and sound works fine
2005-12-18T11:26:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		I had high hopes for mepis, but it locked up on boot
2005-12-18T11:27:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		Well... I wanted easy cross-over... linspire didn't attract me
2005-12-18T11:27:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	this is the only one I've been able to stick with.
2005-12-18T11:30:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	the community's definitely the friendliest of all the distros I've tried.
2005-12-18T11:31:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	plus, they give you completely free cds (though it takes a while to ship)
2005-12-18T11:36:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	I'll have to try that out.
2005-12-18T11:40:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	you may want to give Ubuntu more than 40 megs :)
2005-12-18T11:43:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	no problem.  I've got 8 gigs for ubuntu and it's comfortable for me.
2005-12-18T11:46:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	you may already know this, but you might want to put /home as a seperate partition and give it a couple gigs. Then, you can resize your partition as needed if you start running out of room.
2005-12-18T11:56:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	I was just looking at distrowatch and the wolfix site, I was curious why they didn't include any wine support in the games edition.
2005-12-18T11:58:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	I don't know if it's still updated, but Games Knoppix has a couple releases as well.
2005-12-18T12:03:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	it really hasn't taken that long for me.  The Starter Guide really helped me out a lot when I was starting.  I've been using Ubuntu since about Feb. and I still need instructions for many things CL (through man pages or whatnot), but I'm getting better.  For most things you're set if all you know is sudo apt-get install and how to occassionally edit and copy/paste stuff into a config file.
2005-12-18T12:06:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	I know the feeling.  It's really nice to not have to run anti-virus or spyware tools.
2005-12-18T12:09:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	oh, yes.  The computers at school are constantly being bogged down by crap like that.
2005-12-18T12:16:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	no, I'm not.  I'm curious, though.  Why do you ask?
2005-12-18T12:18:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	thanks.  I don't think I've ever been called that before.
2005-12-18T12:39:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	oh, you work for "that" airline.
2005-12-18T12:53:00.000Z	thundr	Aviatrixie	good night!
