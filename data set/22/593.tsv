2011-07-10T03:31:00.000Z	i2iot		how do I add stuff to the ubuntu launcher???
2011-07-10T03:31:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	search for it the usual way, then drag the icon over
2011-07-10T03:32:00.000Z	i2iot	LogicallyDashing	I tried that, its a loader I created myself to pull up a website
2011-07-10T03:32:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	you mean a launcher?
2011-07-10T03:32:00.000Z	i2iot		Yes
2011-07-10T03:33:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	huh, it's not working for me either. weird
2011-07-10T03:34:00.000Z	i2iot		It acts like it wants to, but doesn't
2011-07-10T03:34:00.000Z	i2iot		The desktop is okay i guess
2011-07-10T03:35:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	as a work around, create a new launcher to an application and not a location; the application is firefox, followed by a space, and then the url you want
2011-07-10T03:35:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	and you might want to use a different icon
2011-07-10T03:36:00.000Z	i2iot	LogicallyDashing	Sweet thanks!
2011-07-10T03:36:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	yw
2011-07-10T03:36:00.000Z	i2iot	LogicallyDashing	Its for adrive.com
2011-07-10T03:36:00.000Z	i2iot	LogicallyDashing	They have like 50gb of free online storage
2011-07-10T03:37:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	thanks i guess, but now I feel a little like a mark
2011-07-10T03:37:00.000Z	i2iot	LogicallyDashing	whats a mark?  does it have something to do with a john?
2011-07-10T03:37:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	similar
2011-07-10T03:37:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	I just mean the way you put that makes it sound like someone paid you to come in here and advertise
2011-07-10T03:38:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	you're still welcome though :b
2011-07-10T03:43:00.000Z	i2iot	LogicallyDashing	lol... not the case... i now see they blow because you can't use ftp or a desktop tool with the free acct, and you can't even use their web applet with linux!
2011-07-10T03:46:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	there are a number of "free shells" online that let you use ssh, and therefore sftp, to store files
2011-07-10T03:47:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	i2iot	they aren't called file hosting services because if you upgrade you mainly get more computing resources and not necessarily more space
