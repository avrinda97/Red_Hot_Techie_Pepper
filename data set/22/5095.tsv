2009-08-18T17:33:00.000Z	lusepuster_		Bump - is there anything I can do to improve Google Earth performance on my laptop (intel graph card), compiz/metacity about equally bad), or should I just scrap it?
2009-08-18T17:34:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	disable "atmosphere", it kills performance on Intel graphics cards
2009-08-18T17:36:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	but there is still the problem that the image field overlays other windows and menus...  Wrong settings somehow?
2009-08-18T17:37:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	I don't know about that. generally I've found that stuff that uses OpenGL won't play nicely along compiz.
2009-08-18T17:38:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	yeah me too - but seems to be the same problem with plain Metacity
2009-08-18T17:38:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	BTW I don't know if this is still true, but one year ago compiz did set the environment variable LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT to true, thereby preventing opengl stuff from drawing directly, which has a significant performance impact at least on Intel cards
2009-08-18T17:40:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	I'm not sure using plain metacity will prevent compiz from running. I just switched to openbox and have been happy since.
2009-08-18T17:40:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	check whether LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT is set
2009-08-18T17:41:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	where do I check this?
2009-08-18T17:41:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	in any terminal emulator inside the same session. launch a terminal and then echo $LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT
2009-08-18T17:42:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	by using metacity --replace, I should be pretty  sure compiz isn't  running - or  what?
2009-08-18T17:42:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	I don't know
2009-08-18T17:42:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	thanks
2009-08-18T17:43:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	echo $LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT gives an empty reply
2009-08-18T17:43:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	so now compiz shouldn't be running
2009-08-18T17:45:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	that is strange. Compiz is running but echo $LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT gives empty line as reply
2009-08-18T17:52:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	I tried enabling openBox and you're right, Google Earth runs much, much better here
2009-08-18T17:53:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	still would like to be able to use one window manager though...
2009-08-18T17:59:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	I'm sure you can achieve the same performance with metacity disabling the compiz decorator, but I haven't looked into a way to accomplish this since I've always liked openbox better anyway
2009-08-18T18:00:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	sure... I'll try some more...
2009-08-18T18:01:00.000Z	Uqbar	lusepuster_	and what is true for google earth also hold true for other major productivity software like... darkplaces or other FPSs :-)
2009-08-18T18:01:00.000Z	lusepuster_	Uqbar	haha, I believe you - I'm not much of a gamer though
