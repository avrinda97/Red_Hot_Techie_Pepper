2008-08-27T01:09:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		whenever my computer goes into the screen saver (I think, it seems to just be periods of inactivity), the whole computer stops and all I can get is a black screen, and I end up having to unplug it
2008-08-27T01:10:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	that as well can be an ACPI issue.
2008-08-27T01:10:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	google ACPI
2008-08-27T01:10:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	google ACPI ubuntu {rather}
2008-08-27T01:13:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	for some reason I had many issues with the computer going to sleep, or hybernate during the Gnome Screensaver, I got fed up trying to fix it, so I just disabled it.
2008-08-27T01:14:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	yeah, sleeps well, doesnt wake up, sounds like my ex-wife.
2008-08-27T01:15:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	hrmmm
2008-08-27T01:16:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	could be
2008-08-27T01:18:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	sounds strange.
2008-08-27T01:19:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	which distro you using?
2008-08-27T01:23:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	have you tried an upgrade yet?
2008-08-27T01:24:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	sudo apt-get upgrade && apt-get upgrade
2008-08-27T01:24:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
2008-08-27T01:25:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	you can also "try" to disable the ACPI settings in the BIOS.
2008-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	Can you tell me the entire issue again, and be specific.
2008-08-27T01:30:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	PC Specs?
2008-08-27T01:32:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	are you using the 64bit Ubuntu?
2008-08-27T01:39:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	you may want to learn the console.. its amazing how much you can fix non-GUI
2008-08-27T01:41:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	if you search google for "whatever compile from source ubuntu" you should get some pretty good how-to's.
2008-08-27T01:42:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	it can be so many things. But I am leaning towards an ACPI issue.
2008-08-27T01:43:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	best bet?? Search ubuntu forums.
2008-08-27T01:52:00.000Z	shey	SherlawkDragon	thats only when there are Kernel updates.
