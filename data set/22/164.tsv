2012-05-03T09:29:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	the normal key-combination gives you not control?
2012-05-03T09:30:00.000Z	SarahsButt	frybye	the normal key combination displays the graphic saying the value is changing but the brightness is still stuck on max
2012-05-03T09:32:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	and when you go into the system control/brightness and screen-lock department?
2012-05-03T09:33:00.000Z	SarahsButt	frybye	same issue won't adjust. I've had this issue for about 3 years now, and across the last 4-5 ubuntu releases.
2012-05-03T09:34:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	perhaps it is a bit cheeky of me - but after 3 years it is perhaps about time for a new laptop anyhows or... (buy a different make/model with good ubuntu compatability!)
2012-05-03T09:35:00.000Z	SarahsButt	frybye	3 years? damn I don't have no money. It's still a good laptop with some good specs. MY windows partition can handle the brightness settings flawlessly. It's not a hardware issue.
2012-05-03T09:35:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	what does google say about the problem "<make and model of laptop> brightness ubuntu"
2012-05-03T09:36:00.000Z	SarahsButt	frybye	seems liek it's a common issue with this laptop
2012-05-03T09:37:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	I am no real linux wizz - with me it is the use of scanner part of multi-function printer/scanner that never works with ubuntu - my soloution to that is also on a different partition ;=)
2012-05-03T09:38:00.000Z	SarahsButt	frybye	thanks mate
2012-05-03T09:38:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	and nowhere via google is a soloution to be found... that actually works?
2012-05-03T09:38:00.000Z	SarahsButt	frybye	gateway NV58
2012-05-03T09:39:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	ActionParsnip is helping you now - he *is* a linux wizz!
2012-05-03T09:44:00.000Z	frybye	SarahsButt	I can well imagine that might help you a load - wish you well - I am outa here for a bit now...
2012-05-03T09:44:00.000Z	SarahsButt	frybye	I hope so. Thanks mate.
