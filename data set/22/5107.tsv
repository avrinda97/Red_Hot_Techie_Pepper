2009-05-26T15:33:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	I need a solution to two problems - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/338489 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/338489 ...  basically I can't do real work on Jaunty until these are fixed
2009-05-26T15:35:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	sorry the other bug is https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/334626
2009-05-26T15:37:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	thanks
2009-05-26T15:38:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	no, my post here was because I want to try it and don't know the best approach....can I download source packages from ubuntu, and build with the patch easily?
2009-05-26T15:40:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	I'm ok with builds, but I can't find where to get the source from ubuntu
2009-05-26T15:40:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	fair enough
2009-05-26T15:41:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	can someone give https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/338489 an importance?
2009-05-26T15:43:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	is it easy to expunge the Jaunty default X server and install Intrepid's ?
2009-05-26T15:45:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	I tried moving /usr/bin/Xorg aside and /usr/lib/xorg aside and copying in what was there in Intrepid...works...but X server burns a very high amount of CPU
2009-05-26T15:46:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	freshly started X server in that scenario is burning 100% cpu with no apps running
2009-05-26T15:47:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	the X server itself is hogging the cpu
2009-05-26T15:55:00.000Z	CaneToad	rakista	ok I'm running Intrepid's X server in Jaunty now.... but as before, the X server from startup is burning 100% cpu...as in http://www.aaa.net.au/campbell/Screenshot-1.png
