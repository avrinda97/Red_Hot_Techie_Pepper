2010-08-04T18:56:00.000Z	mr		Basically I wish to remove ubuntu, But I cant use the windows 7 resore card. (I am wanting to remove ubuntu as the wireless will not work with my wireless card in ubuntu, install openSUSE, then reinstall ubuntu when they have fixed the problem)

2010-08-04T19:00:00.000Z	SimonSayez	mr	If its a Dell its supported well in Linux
2010-08-04T19:01:00.000Z	SimonSayez	mr	use the ndiswrappers
2010-08-04T19:02:00.000Z	SimonSayez	mr	connect to a wired connection and open synaptic package manager and search for ndiswrapper
2010-08-04T19:02:00.000Z	mr	SimonSayez	my ubuntu already picks up the wireless signal, will it help with that or..?
2010-08-04T19:03:00.000Z	SimonSayez	mr	did you do apt-get update on your system yet
