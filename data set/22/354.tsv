2011-12-27T12:21:00.000Z	reisio		not that I'm aware of, but you can run vlc from a terminal
2011-12-27T12:21:00.000Z	reisio		as well as mplayer
2011-12-27T12:21:00.000Z	reisio		the VLC command is cvlc
2011-12-27T12:22:00.000Z	Raliegh	reisio	the thing that sucks about cvlc is if you press "CTRL+C" or close the terminal the script ends as well.
2011-12-27T12:22:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	that's what I'd want to happen, though
2011-12-27T12:23:00.000Z	Raliegh	reisio	then cvlc is perfect for you. :) And yeah there is an option to pass that uses normal "vlc" and has terminal usage.
2011-12-27T12:30:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	if you ls -al /home/, does it say 'ices:ices' ?
2011-12-27T12:30:00.000Z	Raliegh	reisio	for that folder yes it does.
2011-12-27T12:31:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	what's the command giving you permission denied?
2011-12-27T12:31:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	in what dir?
2011-12-27T12:32:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	doesn't sound like the right directory
2011-12-27T12:32:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	'pwd' will tell you where you are, if you're unsure
2011-12-27T12:32:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	that said liquidsoap is in the repos, why do you want to build it manually?
2011-12-27T12:33:00.000Z	Raliegh	reisio	because I got met with dependency errors that couldn't be fixed no matter what I installed, so I'm just compiling it and letting it install it for me.
2011-12-27T12:35:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	well at least use checkinstall or something
2011-12-27T12:36:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	cd /home/liquids[TAB]
2011-12-27T12:38:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	probably missing something trivial
2011-12-27T12:38:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	TAB isn't required, it'll just save you time and sanity
2011-12-27T12:42:00.000Z	Raliegh	reisio	Sorry, didn't highlight you properly a second ago.
2011-12-27T13:16:00.000Z	reisio	Raliegh	sounds like it has _a lot_ of deps
2011-12-27T13:17:00.000Z	Raliegh	reisio	It does, but I think I've gotten all of the dependencies. I have the correct dependencies now, and I have the feeling this is the last one.
2011-12-27T13:22:00.000Z	Raliegh	reisio	do you think you know how to fix the apt-get issues?
