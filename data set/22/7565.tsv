2008-09-22T18:05:00.000Z	bobertdos	dinesh	Using ndisgtk might make it easier. It's a graphical frontend. Make sure your drivers are valid Windows XP drivers for the correct device. Also make sure you're pointing to an INF.

2008-09-22T18:20:00.000Z	bobertdos	dinesh	You're using Hardy, right? If so, you might not have all the repositories enabled.

2008-09-22T18:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	dinesh	Actually, back on your system, you might want to try: sudo apt-get update and then try installing ndisgtk again.
2008-09-22T18:24:00.000Z	dinesh	bobertdos	i m unable to get the update as ndiswrapper is not working and i am unable to connect to wireless
2008-09-22T18:25:00.000Z	bobertdos	dinesh	You're running off of ethernet right now, right? sudo apt-get update is a command that refreshes the repositories.
2008-09-22T18:25:00.000Z	dinesh	bobertdos	i think the error is like that ndis utils 1.9 unable to resolve

2008-09-22T18:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	dinesh	You're going to either have to get to a place where you can use ethernet, or maybe burn yourself a DVD and see if you can get aptoncd from there.
