2007-06-17T12:50:00.000Z	vitamin_		Hello, I have a question about partitions and trash
2007-06-17T12:51:00.000Z	vitamin_		Even if I delete a whole lot of stuff from my Windows partition, it says that the free space of that partition hasn't changed
2007-06-17T12:51:00.000Z	vitamin_		and when I look in trash, it hasn't got anything that was deleted from the windows partition there
2007-06-17T12:52:00.000Z	vitamin_		Anyone know what I might be doing wrong?
2007-06-17T12:52:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	look in /root/.Trash or ~/.Trash
2007-06-17T12:52:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	thanx; I'll take a look
2007-06-17T12:54:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	it says /root/.Trash doesn't exist and ~/.Trash is empty
2007-06-17T12:54:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	look in your windows partition
2007-06-17T12:54:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	kk~
2007-06-17T12:56:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	/.Trash doesn't exist on my Windows parition, but when I reboot into Windows, there's a folder called vitamin_/.Trash
2007-06-17T12:56:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	where is this folder?
2007-06-17T12:57:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	it's only there when reboot into Windows
2007-06-17T12:57:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	where in windows is it??
2007-06-17T12:57:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	um, I'm not sure how to describe it
2007-06-17T12:57:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	c:\vitamin\.Trash ?
2007-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	my other partition with media, work etc is mounted, and it's on that one; I think it's P:\vitamin\.Trash
2007-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	I assure you, you can access it in Linux.   try searching your drive for a file that's in the trash
2007-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	if you're sure, then it would be in /media/hdaX/vitamin/.Trash
2007-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	ok, thanx I'll take a look, just one more question
2007-06-17T12:59:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	if I move something from that partition into trash when I'm on Linux, do I need to go to/media/hdaX/vitamin/.Trash to empty it as well?  Thanks!
2007-06-17T13:00:00.000Z	TaJMoX	vitamin_	Yes, that drive has it's own trash.   you can drag and drop the files you want to delete into your personal trash, holding the SHIFT key which tells it to move the file instead of copy
2007-06-17T13:01:00.000Z	vitamin_	TaJMoX	Alright, thanks v much! =D
