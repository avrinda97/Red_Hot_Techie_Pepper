2012-09-22T06:24:00.000Z	L3top		that is odd. I do not expect that to work in that case.
2012-09-22T06:25:00.000Z	L3top		sorry sam... you will need to prepend that with sudo... so       sudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt
2012-09-22T06:27:00.000Z	L3top		It will not be NTFS... unless... you have done something very screwy. Let's back up a minute...
2012-09-22T06:29:00.000Z	L3top		What are the chances you installed linux on an NTFS partition?
2012-09-22T06:29:00.000Z	L3top		/dev/sda3 I would guess.
2012-09-22T06:31:00.000Z	L3top		does ls /mnt | grep 'bin'   return a result
2012-09-22T06:32:00.000Z	L3top		once that is done,   ls /mnt | grep 'bin'
2012-09-22T06:34:00.000Z	L3top		so you mounted /dev/sda3 sam__?
2012-09-22T06:34:00.000Z	L3top		what does ls /mnt  look like? Windowsy?
2012-09-22T06:36:00.000Z	L3top		/dev/sda3        31664128  1040545791  504440832    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT          that should not complain.... and this only assumes that you have installed linux on ntfs...
2012-09-22T06:37:00.000Z	sam___	L3top	and iCarly http://nopaste.info/0c5410ba8c.html
2012-09-22T06:41:00.000Z	sam___	L3top	oh so my files are gone too or just systems files
2012-09-22T06:42:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	I dont know that anything is gone.
2012-09-22T06:42:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	You may have just clicked on the drive in nautilus or something and it is already mounted
2012-09-22T06:44:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	  give me the output of: mount
2012-09-22T06:44:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	please
2012-09-22T06:48:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	I want the output OF mount. If you are in the live disk, and type mount, it should produce output. I want that in a pastebin.
2012-09-22T06:50:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	umount -lf /dev/sda3
2012-09-22T06:51:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
2012-09-22T06:52:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	sudo umount -lf /dev/sda3
2012-09-22T06:52:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mt
2012-09-22T06:56:00.000Z	L3top	sam___	 if that is the case... then it is definitely gone.
