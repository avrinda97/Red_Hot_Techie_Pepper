2007-07-31T11:44:00.000Z	act1v8		ok... but first I have to install Ubuntu.... and then will I be able to log in?
2007-07-31T11:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	yes
2007-07-31T11:45:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	^^^
2007-07-31T11:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	is that a dual boot setup?
2007-07-31T11:47:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	no... if I delete windows I can't get it back, and + the laptop will become useless
2007-07-31T11:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	Why not just shrink up a couple gig and try dual boot.
2007-07-31T11:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	Sorry if I came in late but I have been working on a project
2007-07-31T11:48:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	is shrinking safe?
2007-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	You should always have a backup, but few people do... how much free space is on the windows partition?
2007-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	I think it's 19.5 GB
2007-07-31T11:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	I understand the dilema, but working on partitions without a backup always has at least a slight risk.
2007-07-31T11:53:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	that's not the main problem... even if I do that there is a 65-70% possibility Ubuntu or any linux distro not working
2007-07-31T11:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	Have you looked up your hardware setup to see if it has been successful before..?  What hardware?
2007-07-31T11:55:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	the main bits are Intel Pentium Mobile (CPU), ATI Radeon Mobility X700
2007-07-31T11:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	make and model?
2007-07-31T11:55:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	make and model???
2007-08-05T06:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	Not hard to do
2007-08-05T06:55:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	how?
2007-08-05T06:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	To Remove Icons from Desktop Use Terminal and type gconf-editor browse to /apps/nautilus/desktop and uncheck volumes_visable
2007-08-05T06:57:00.000Z	act1v8	Jack_Sparrow	thanks!
2007-08-05T06:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	sorry it took a minute
2007-08-20T12:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	act1v8	No
