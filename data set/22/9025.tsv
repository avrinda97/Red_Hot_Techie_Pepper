2005-03-29T08:02:00.000Z	M_Fatih		hi al.. i'm a gentoo user, i want to use ubuntu. i have questions, how can i contorl & add/remove my initscripts, how can i change runlevels this scripts..
2005-03-29T08:03:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	ubuntu doesn't really do the runlevel thing. IIRC runlevels 2-6 or something are identical
2005-03-29T08:04:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	I'll admit though, I know virtually nothing about runlevels
2005-03-30T07:44:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	you need to enable universe first
2005-03-30T07:45:00.000Z	M_Fatih	farruinn	how do i do it?
2005-03-30T07:46:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	sorry,  I wasn't in gnome atm
2005-03-30T07:47:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	go to the System>Administration>Syanaptic Package Manager
2005-03-30T07:48:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	oh, you don't want to use synaptic from console
2005-03-30T07:48:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	if you've set a root password you need to use su, not sudo
2005-03-30T07:50:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	you need to edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list, there are two lines that are commented out, it tells you which lines to uncomment
2005-03-30T07:51:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	something like 'su nano /etc/apt/sources.list' would work
2005-03-30T07:51:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	ok, then as root run apt-get update
2005-03-30T07:52:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	sudo uses your user password, su uses the root password
2005-03-30T07:56:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	you probably just need to run 'apt-get upgrade'
2005-03-30T08:09:00.000Z	M_Fatih	farruinn	i tried this "libid3tag"
2005-03-30T08:10:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	you're sure you've enabled universe? apt-get update had no problems?
2005-03-30T08:16:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	you've disabled main man =), you've got to get rid of those #'s
2005-03-30T08:17:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	leave the lines with hoary-updates commented though
2005-03-30T08:20:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	synaptic will allow you to search and select those packages quickly
2005-03-30T08:23:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	apt is a really great package management tool, you'll get the hang of it in no time
2005-03-30T08:24:00.000Z	M_Fatih	farruinn	yes i know, i used in suse so many times ago..
2005-03-30T08:24:00.000Z	farruinn	M_Fatih	ah, I see
