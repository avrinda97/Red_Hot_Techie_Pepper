2010-11-22T22:00:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	I'd have to re-install windows for that... Can't i access it using ubuntu ?
2010-11-22T22:01:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	you don't have to. As I said you can use your Windows install disc.
2010-11-22T22:01:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	That's some headway.. But how do I use it within Ubuntu ?
2010-11-22T22:03:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	NTFS is Windows. Linux can use it but if you get errors on NTFS you have (as far as I know) to use a Windows system or the recovery console on your Windows install disc to avoid data loss.
2010-11-22T22:04:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	Umm,  What's a bad superblock ? I get that error. Any help ?
2010-11-22T22:07:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	the MFT of your NTFS partition might be damaged or lost.
2010-11-22T22:09:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	MFT as in ? Here's the output of fsck and mount http://pastebin.com/GADNPkfB
2010-11-22T22:11:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	are you sure that sda5 is a NTFS partition ?
2010-11-22T22:11:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	Yes. I'm sure.
2010-11-22T22:17:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	I already tolsd you about Testdisk.
2010-11-22T22:20:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	Yes, it's Testdisk or the Windows disk, as you said earlier.
2010-11-22T22:24:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	perhaps there is a way to fix it by Ubuntu.
2010-11-22T22:24:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	Is there ? Wow ! Great ! How ??
2010-11-22T22:26:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	install the package ntfsprogs
2010-11-22T22:28:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	done. I'm using it. Here's the output : http://pastebin.com/eycf1PJ9
2010-11-22T22:29:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	ir seems that you'll have to use chkdsk.
2010-11-22T22:30:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	'sudo: chkdsk: command not found' ! Where do I go from here ?
2010-11-22T22:33:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	chkdsk is a Microsoft Tool so you have to boot Windows or use the recovery console from your Windows install disc.
2010-11-22T22:34:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	Aargh ! Back to Windows then... I'll reinstall it after resizing it the way you suggested...
2010-11-22T22:36:00.000Z	Json	sbeck	Use the install disc to repair without installing it ? I'll have a go !
2010-11-22T22:37:00.000Z	sbeck	Json	look in your qry
