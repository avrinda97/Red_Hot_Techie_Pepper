2006-08-28T07:54:00.000Z	don_jr		Would the 686 kernel help make things run a bit faster on a laptop?
2006-08-28T07:55:00.000Z	don_jr		How do I find out how much freespace I have on my hard drive?
2006-08-28T07:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	not as much as adding extra ram
2006-08-30T05:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	WHat onboard sound do you have?
2006-08-30T05:22:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	how can I find that out?
2006-08-30T05:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	Look in your manual, look up your motherboad model online..
2006-08-30T05:28:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	from what I can find it's a Camino2 integrated sound card
2006-09-05T09:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	BE aware that removing a partition below your ubuntu install can mess your grub loaders ability to find ubuntu
2006-09-05T09:33:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not sure what that means, when I do fdisk -l, hda1 the first one is the windows partition.  If I remove it completely, iwll that open it up to Ubuntu? or is there more to it?
2006-09-05T09:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	 there is more to it than simply removing the old partition.
2006-09-05T09:34:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	what else should I do?  It hold's the bulk of my HD and I'd like to open that space up for Ubuntu only and remove windows completely from this box.
2006-09-05T09:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	You can use gparted to shrink it to an insignificant size and expand your ext3 and not have partition ID's change...
2006-09-05T09:35:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	so just shrink one and enlarge the other and then I won't have to remove anything completely?
2006-09-05T09:36:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	so I can remove the fat32 partition and then update-grub and I"ll be safe to reboot?
2006-09-05T09:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	YEs, but update grub has a few questions you may not know the answer to...
2006-09-05T09:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	It isnt a bad idea to have a second ext3 to save a system backup and or a copy of /home
2006-09-05T09:44:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	but if I change the fat32 system to ext3, can I then resize my main partition of ext3 that Ubuntu runs on to be larger?
2006-09-05T09:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	yes, you can make a smaller ext3 where fat32 was... and make bigger your ubuntu installation partition
2006-09-05T09:45:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	so with gparted, I change the fat32 to ext3, then resize my main ext3 to be larger and shirnk the new one?
2006-09-05T09:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	don_jr	 yes, but you would need to shrink the one before you could make the other bigger..
2006-09-05T09:47:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	Okay, I'll give that a shot.
2006-09-05T12:06:00.000Z	don_jr	Jack_Sparrow	I ended up having to reformat and reinstall ubuntu, now I can't get it to run right.  after the first splash screen with all the loading messages, I get to a black screen with a non blinking cursor.
