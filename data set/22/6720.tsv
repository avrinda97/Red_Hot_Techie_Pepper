2009-12-18T17:31:00.000Z	tyler_d		how do you get the ip of a virtualmachine from an ubuntu host?
2009-12-18T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 you mean a machine running in virutalbox?
2009-12-18T17:31:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	yup yup
2009-12-18T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 you could set it  it to use the local lan ip's or a static ip if you wanted. otherwise it uses its own private lan ip range.  Check the vbox manual at the vbox homepage for all the diferent ways it can do networking
2010-12-19T18:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 new one? never noticed. on my windows bpx;s i removed that 'windows live login helper' (i thnk thats the name) program. and samba started connecting properly
2010-12-19T18:58:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	I removed that and still no joy :(
2010-12-19T18:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 'windows live sign in assistant' is what i removed. and it started working.. theres some sites with otuer possible fix;s as well

2010-12-19T19:00:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	the outline for the "fixes" is an implimentation on Windows 7 Pro... lgp is not available in home premium...
2010-12-19T19:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 never noticed. and i cant keep the windows variants strght - so thats all i know.
2010-12-19T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 other url i recall reading (i bookmarked it) was -> http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/75-63-windows-samba-issue
2010-12-19T19:01:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	doncha just love windows and the 8 different versions.... going to check the live sign-in thingy
2010-12-19T19:01:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	seen both of these, and a few more.... brb
2010-12-19T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 some game i had installed the windows live junk. and after that sambe wasent connecing.. i looked into it.. removed the live sign-n thing. and it worked.. so thats the extent of my research
2010-12-19T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 so its now 2 for 2 - fixing win7/samba - by removing the live sign in helper...
2010-12-19T19:15:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	the problem is that the windows live sign-in helper enables further "security" by changing the lgp security
2010-12-19T19:16:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	you can also fix it by simply "re-enabling" the 1st and 2nd level smb security
2011-04-20T21:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 you would need to set the bash prompt to send the proper escape codes I belive.
2011-04-20T21:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 if you are sshing  - then the prompt for the sshed box would be sending the coded.
2011-04-20T21:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 check the bash prompt howto at tldp.org :)
2011-04-20T21:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	Dr_Willis	I set it in "Title and Command" and set the "Initial title:" to `hostname`
2011-04-20T21:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tyler_d	 the esc code method would work with any terminal program (in theory)
