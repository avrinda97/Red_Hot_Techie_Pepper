2006-05-28T09:04:00.000Z	Spaceraver		heh... this is the best time to be on these channels
2006-05-28T09:05:00.000Z	Spaceraver		I keep 30 chinese students in my basement and force them to memorize those numbers... and a midget to tell me what they mean... :D
2006-05-28T09:07:00.000Z	Spaceraver		this aint a normal quakenet irc channel... they are arrogant tbh
2006-05-28T09:08:00.000Z	Spaceraver		i cant use static ip's... moving to lans and such means i need the dhcp...
2006-05-28T09:08:00.000Z	Spaceraver		i miss a front end for my bluetooth in ubuntu tho
2006-05-28T09:08:00.000Z	Spaceraver		pip`... gnome is default
2006-05-28T09:09:00.000Z	Spaceraver		or fluxbox... but that's not for the faint hearted
2006-05-28T09:10:00.000Z	Spaceraver		i have fluxbox, blackbox, gnome and kde installed on my lappy...
2006-05-28T09:11:00.000Z	Spaceraver		but i cant lend them the lappy when it's running fluxbox or blackbox.. taht would confuse the normal windoze user
2006-05-28T09:12:00.000Z	Spaceraver		hmm... was thinking... does xfce require opengl support??
2006-05-28T09:13:00.000Z	StucKman	Spaceraver	not that i know. have you tried apt-cache chos xfce?
2006-05-28T09:14:00.000Z	StucKman		geez
2006-05-28T09:14:00.000Z	Spaceraver	pip`	it runs on 256 ram on a duron 1ghz mobile
2006-05-28T09:14:00.000Z	StucKman	Spaceraver	apt-cache show xfce4
2006-05-28T09:14:00.000Z	Spaceraver		aah...
2006-05-28T09:17:00.000Z	Spaceraver		xgl does need a rather branded gpu
2006-05-28T09:18:00.000Z	StucKman	Spaceraver	anything that runs XGL smoothly
2006-05-28T09:18:00.000Z	StucKman		see the xgl page, it has a list of supported HW (mostly nvidia)
2006-05-28T09:18:00.000Z	Spaceraver		StucKman... welll a s3 virge card isnt a viable option...
2006-05-28T09:19:00.000Z	StucKman	Spaceraver	I guess not
2006-05-28T09:19:00.000Z	Spaceraver		it wont run on my lappy anyhow...
