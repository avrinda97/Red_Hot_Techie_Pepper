2010-02-04T06:05:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	may i suggest the "super grub" boot disc?
2010-02-04T06:06:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	I have used the supergrub boot disk... lets me get back to windows, but I need to fix how it opens ubuntu... trying to sort that out now.. (fdisk -l ...)
2010-02-04T06:06:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	did you try the "auto linux" option?
2010-02-04T06:06:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	I'll try it again...
2010-02-04T06:07:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	also... from super grub, try show partitions, find your ubuntu partition, hit B for boot... it wont fix grub but its good for testing that u can boot it
2010-02-04T06:07:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	I just simplified my partiions and such.  there's no auto linux, but there's something like auto magic
2010-02-04T06:09:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	my linux partion is on /dev/sda5 now.. I just need to fix that crazy menu.lst, I think... but I'll try supergrub now..
2010-02-04T06:12:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	supergrub gets "error: no loaded kernel when I try to load linux..
2010-02-04T06:14:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	do you know how to edit teh command to get it to mount | boot to /dev/sda5?
2010-02-04T06:30:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	no luck with super grub?
2010-02-04T06:30:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	nope, got errror could not find kernel
2010-02-04T06:32:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	did you try in super grub:  going to view partitions, selecting your ubuntu partition, and press B like i recommended?
2010-02-04T06:32:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	cause if that doesn't work, you might have a bigger problem than you think
2010-02-04T06:32:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	how do I view partisions
2010-02-04T06:32:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	look through the options on super grub its in there
2010-02-04T06:33:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	options?  Hm... let me restart and try that..
2010-02-04T06:33:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	its not actually under something called "options" im just saying its there somewhere
2010-02-04T06:38:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	now in super grub (1.96) do I need to drop to command line?
2010-02-04T06:41:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	I'm in supergrub  on the commad line, I can see all the commands (tab) what command did you suggest?
2010-02-04T06:43:00.000Z	boourns	TomV_415	what i'm talking about is a boot disc, super grub disc, it isnt a command line its a text based menu
2010-02-04T06:43:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	I'm trying probe /dev/sda5
2010-02-04T06:44:00.000Z	TomV_415	boourns	Right, I booted from the CD.. got to command line by typing 'c' after trying AUTO MAGIC with no luck
