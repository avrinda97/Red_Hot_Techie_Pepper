2007-01-19T10:21:00.000Z	gaona		hello boys
2007-01-19T10:21:00.000Z	gaona		i got a question
2007-01-19T10:22:00.000Z	gaona		i'd like to change the ip of my wifi router under linux... how can i do that?
2007-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	gaona		cuz i'd like to have an usa dns to access episodes on abc.com
2007-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	gaona		is it possible?
2007-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	gaona		but i can't find anything
2007-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	gaona		isn't it possible to "hide" my ip
2007-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	gaona		or just fake it
2007-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	gaona		suppose i have tvcablenet.be dns...  and i'd like to change it as fbi.org
2007-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	gaona		i won't get any replies what do u mean exactly?
2007-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	Pici	gaona	: sounds like you need a proxy server
2007-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	gaona		yep
2007-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	gaona		but that is not working
2007-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	gaona	Pici	cuz when i put a proxy... it's on the ip of MY computer, and not on the ip of the router... :/
2007-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	Pici	gaona	: there isnt any other way of doing it, besides physically moving to the US
2007-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	Pici	gaona	: look on google for a public US proxy
2007-01-19T10:27:00.000Z	gaona	Pici	 lol it's not in my plans yet :)   but how can i put a proxy, BEHIND my router, and not BETWEEN my pc and the router...?
2007-01-19T10:29:00.000Z	gaona	Pici	still there?
2007-01-19T10:29:00.000Z	Pici	gaona	: Installing a proxy anywhere on your nextwork isnt going to help you.  You need to find a proxy server thats located in one of the countries that can access the page
2007-01-19T10:33:00.000Z	gaona	Pici	 i think i won't find that easily... i'm pretty anonymous on irc and don't know lot of people who could help me in that task!  but i think i got and idea. i know that in the configuration tool of my router (a DI-524) there is a field for scripts. when u put a script in it, it is applied directly on the proxy, therefore on the "gate" to the internet. if i'd put a "proxy script" maybe it would work... but do u know how i could write mys
2007-01-19T10:33:00.000Z	gaona		elf such script or if u know some website about the subject (i already tried to search without much success)
2007-01-19T10:40:00.000Z	gaona	Pici	u there?
