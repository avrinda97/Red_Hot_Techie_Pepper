2011-07-31T03:23:00.000Z	alex--		Hello, I want to let my friend execute some scripts, can I limit the amount of things he may execute? And limit his ram usage?
2011-07-31T03:25:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 could probably set up a vps or vm or something
2011-07-31T03:26:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	then i'm giving him too many rights
2011-07-31T03:26:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 what do you want to restrict
2011-07-31T03:26:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	only let him execute some php commands, but not all
2011-07-31T03:27:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 ohio safe mouse?

2011-07-31T03:32:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 yeh, I think most users of that switched to using vpses
2011-07-31T03:33:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	but then he haves too many rights
2011-07-31T03:33:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 how so?
2011-07-31T03:37:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	he can do everything at the vps then
2011-07-31T03:53:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 what do you want to prevent?
2011-07-31T03:53:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	i want to limit him into the command he can execute
2011-07-31T03:54:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	or let him only execute files i made
2011-07-31T03:54:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 if you strictly want only pre-defined scripts, why not make a web interface our something?
2011-07-31T03:55:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	because the script itself is being called from another website
2011-07-31T03:57:00.000Z	CoJaBo	alex--	 what, exactly, are you trying to do?
2011-07-31T03:59:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	may I pm you?
2011-07-31T03:59:00.000Z	alex--	CoJaBo	to explain
