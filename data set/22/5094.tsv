2008-09-18T01:31:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	would be my guess :) But you never know....
2008-09-18T01:41:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	In terminal type: rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity
2008-09-18T01:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	After that, log out, and log back in, or restart X.
2008-09-18T01:44:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	well, it seems kinda... brutal. I think last time I did that, it reset all my preferences for single apps, and it also removed my Evolution inboxes. Thing is, it says failsafe gnome, but only thing it does is not load a window manager, and as soon as I run compiz, my ordinary session works fine....
2008-09-18T01:46:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	Maybe you should just try reconfiguring gdm orubuntu-desktop..........
2008-09-18T01:47:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	one more clue... My wife's account works fine, in gnome, only login to my own account doesn't work
2008-09-18T01:49:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	Unfortunately, that only solidifies my belief that you should should delete those directories :p
2008-09-18T01:51:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	Hmm... It seems odd, though, since everything works fine as soon as I log in and manually restart a few things.  So I guess, most of these configuration files are not the key...? (I know, I'm writhing and trying to avoid it here...)
2008-09-18T01:53:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	Well, you have a point. It kind of sounds like X may just not be initializing properly.
2008-09-18T01:54:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	yes, and it's clearly a personal setting for the x session. Wonder if there's one single file there to mess with - or simply delete?
2008-09-18T01:56:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	but then again. X initialises fine in KDE4, so it's clearly a gnome/Xsession interaction thing... right?
2008-09-18T01:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	I'd say so. Does your wife use KDE or Gnome?
2008-09-18T01:59:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	I have a suspicion it happened when I messed around with assigning different groups to my personal user...
2008-09-18T02:11:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	thanks :) We'll see....
2008-09-18T02:02:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	 Here are my thoughts: Delete those directories (which should NEVER have done anything to your Evolution, by the way), try sudo dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop and sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm. Also, if you have to, you can create a fresh user account for yourself and transfer your personal data over to your new home directory.
2008-09-18T02:03:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	okay, I'll try that. Thanks!
2008-09-18T02:04:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	one more thgin, if you happen to know. Command line for creating a new user, no sudo, what would be sensible options?
2008-09-18T02:05:00.000Z	lusepuster_	bobertdos	soddy to bother you but what were the dirs to delete again? .gconf, .gnome2?
2008-09-18T02:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	.metacity .gconfd
2008-09-18T02:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	You can also always read the manpage for adduser. man is your friend, use it as often as possible
2008-09-18T02:10:00.000Z	bobertdos	lusepuster_	I give you permission to PM me if it'll make life less confusing :D
