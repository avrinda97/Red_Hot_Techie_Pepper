2009-02-23T02:22:00.000Z	Daniel_G		ive got a linux box that comes with some stupid custom kernel thats being a total pain in the ass, whats the easiest way to install a standard server kenel?
2009-02-23T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic or something like that
2009-02-23T02:23:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	i thought as much, once ive done that do i need make any other changes? or will it boot into the new kernel on the next restart?
2009-02-23T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	you'll be able to select the new kernel when you reboot.. in the grub menu.. you might have to press esc while booting for it to show up
2009-02-23T02:25:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	its a server mate, i only have SSH access and no KVM
2009-02-23T02:25:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	then it's off to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and make sure it's setup right.. but usually it will boot the ne kernel by default
2009-02-23T02:26:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	yeah i figured, last time i tried that i broke the server :P
2009-02-23T02:26:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	cheers
2009-02-23T02:39:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	did you run "sudo update-grub" ?
2009-02-23T02:39:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	ah i just did and it looks positive, thanks i'll brb ;)
2009-02-23T02:43:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	i did that, and it gave back some info and specifically mentioned the new kernel, but alas it still boots into the old one...
2009-02-23T02:44:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	if you check the menu.lst file, is it still pointing to the new kernel?
2009-02-23T02:44:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	update-grub will change that file..you have to edit it at the right place
2009-02-23T02:44:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	the menu.lst file *only* contains the new kernel, there is no mention of the old one in there at all
2009-02-23T02:46:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	well.... then I don't really know..  afaik there are no other secret settings.. perhaps reinstall grub?
2009-02-23T02:47:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	http://pastebin.com/d7e6b36f - can you have a look and tell me if theres anything wrong with that?
2009-02-23T02:48:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	it looks correct to me.
2009-02-23T02:50:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	ffs, it seems the machine has both grub and lilo installed, and its boots off lilo
2009-02-23T02:51:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	hehe.. weird but I guess it's possible.. reinstall grub then.. or config lilo
2009-02-23T02:55:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	so i should be save in removing lilo and then reinstalling grub? that wont break the machine?
2009-02-23T02:55:00.000Z	Slart	Daniel_G	unless that special kernel is needed somehow it should be fine
2009-02-23T02:55:00.000Z	Daniel_G	Slart	cheers
