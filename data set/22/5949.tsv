2007-08-28T08:26:00.000Z	shrimants		i know that nvidia 8600m gt wont work, and i might not be able to use live CD because it will give me a cannot access tty, job control turned off error
2007-08-28T08:27:00.000Z	shrimants		furthermore, i have an intel 3965 wireless card but i have no idea how to use it if there is no GUI
2007-08-28T08:28:00.000Z	shrimants		how tho, if i dont know how to connect to my wireless without gui. and what nvidia drivers do i install? the one provided by nvidia?
2007-08-28T08:28:00.000Z	shrimants		hardwire didnt work either
2007-08-28T08:28:00.000Z	shrimants		it didnt recognize the broadcom card
2007-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	shrimants		last time i had to use some insane work around
2007-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	shrimants		hmm
2007-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	shrimants		do you think it would be better to wait till i get in college? there is a group called the linux user's group there
2007-08-28T08:30:00.000Z	shrimants		i move in 2 days
2007-08-28T08:30:00.000Z	shrimants		allright
2007-08-28T08:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shrimants	Depending on the model of the broadcom card it could be very easy to get working ( ndiswrapper is not needed for all broadcom cards )
2008-08-21T10:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shrimants	"Stuck" in what way?
2008-08-21T10:55:00.000Z	shrimants	Jordan_U	basically, $TERM will not unset, reset, or set to anything. it stays with a value of urxvt no matter what i do
2008-08-21T10:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shrimants	Can you run "script", do some TERM="Hello World" ; echo $TERM and other such tests and pastebin the result?
2008-08-21T10:57:00.000Z	shrimants	Jordan_U	i've tried that sort of thing. it sets it in that specific terminal and the changes are reflected if i type just set or export
2008-08-21T11:01:00.000Z	shrimants	Jordan_U	any ideas?
2008-08-21T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shrimants	Do you just want it to be set that way in all shells or in all applications?
2008-08-21T11:04:00.000Z	shrimants	Jordan_U	i just want it to be set back to its original setting, when it would launch xfce's terminal
2008-08-21T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shrimants	AHH, $TERM has nothing to do with what X terminal emulator is run by default
2008-08-21T11:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shrimants	I think you want to look at update-alternatives
2008-08-21T11:05:00.000Z	shrimants	Jordan_U	but if i try to launch weechat "in terminal" then it doesnt work
2008-08-21T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shrimants	Still, that has nothing to do with the $TERM variable ( that variable tells you what shell terminal emulator you are using, it doesn't change what terminal emulator should be started by default if you need another )
