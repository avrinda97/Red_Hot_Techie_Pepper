2008-10-08T04:52:00.000Z	Xyphy		not for me
2008-10-08T04:53:00.000Z	Xyphy		seriously
2008-10-08T04:53:00.000Z	Xyphy		hmm
2008-10-08T04:54:00.000Z	Agrajag	Xyphy	what font are you using?
2008-10-08T04:55:00.000Z	Xyphy	Agrajag	monospace 12
2008-10-08T04:55:00.000Z	Xyphy	Agrajag	Cant change it either...
2008-10-08T04:55:00.000Z	Agrajag		you can't change it? Why not?
2008-10-08T04:55:00.000Z	Xyphy		Dunno... greyed out
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Agrajag	Xyphy	Oh, you have "Use the system fixed width font" checked.
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Agrajag		Uncheck that and you can set it to whatever you want
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Agrajag		at least that's probably it
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Xyphy		YES... thank you Agrajag
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Xyphy		Problem fixed
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Agrajag		but as far as I know monospace doesn't replace your ~ with -
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Xyphy		dunno
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Agrajag		so I doubt I've helped you much
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Xyphy		Fixed now
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Agrajag		oh
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Xyphy		Im happy
2008-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	Agrajag		ok
2008-10-08T04:58:00.000Z	Xyphy	Agrajag	What is system fixed width font?
