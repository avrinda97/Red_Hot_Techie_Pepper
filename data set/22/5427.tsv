2007-05-26T05:58:00.000Z	jazzrocker	sdf	set transparency on your panels and set transparency on your gnome-terminal
2007-05-26T05:59:00.000Z	jazzrocker	sdf	find a leet background, and poof you're done
2007-05-26T05:59:00.000Z	sdf	jazzrocker	how please?
2007-05-26T05:59:00.000Z	jazzrocker	sdf	preferences, use the control panel
2007-05-26T06:00:00.000Z	jazzrocker	sdf	settings... look around in your menus, use your brain, you'll figure it out

2007-05-26T06:00:00.000Z	jazzrocker	sdf	as for the other items, that thing on the left looks like probably either gkrellms or torsmo
2007-05-26T06:01:00.000Z	jazzrocker	sdf	the thing on the right is just a random weather applet, don't know which one
