2007-01-18T09:19:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	google around, you may need to install voodoo modules?
2007-01-18T09:19:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	i also have an unconfigured pvr-350
2007-01-18T09:19:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	make sure your xorg.conf has the right driver as well
2007-01-18T09:20:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	should i rip out the tv-card?
2007-01-18T09:20:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	shouldn't be the tv-card's fault
2007-01-18T09:21:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	/var/log/Xorg.0.log usually
2007-01-18T09:22:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	pastebin your Xorg error log, should have info on why it dun work

2007-01-18T09:23:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	you may want to try visiting #xorg
2007-01-18T09:37:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	after reading the xorg.conf and the var/log/Xorg.0, i found and removed all of the wacom input devices from the xorg.conf
2007-01-18T09:37:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	it booted and i was able to open a file manager, but it then failed when the background was drawn to the screen
2007-01-18T09:39:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	the only error in the var/log was "error opening security policy file /usr/lib/xserve/SecurityPolicy"
2007-01-18T09:40:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	u are using the voodoo driver, right?
2007-01-18T09:40:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	yes it properly detected my drivers
2007-01-18T09:40:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	not sure then. google around for xorg voodoo
2007-01-18T09:42:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	could the problem be my voodoo card doesnt support dri which glx needs
2007-01-18T09:42:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	if so, is there an easy way to uninstall xgl
2007-01-18T09:43:00.000Z	yanger	qwehnce	u could comment DRI out.. ask in #xorg
2007-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	qwehnce	yanger	i solved the video card problem, but alas a new one arises, after finally loading nautilus the mouse disappears
