2006-04-20T06:21:00.000Z	moonwatcher		the interface is up
2006-04-20T06:21:00.000Z	moonwatcher		but for somereason it gets an ipv6 address
2006-04-20T06:22:00.000Z	moonwatcher		which is not at all good
2006-04-20T06:22:00.000Z	moonwatcher		wpa
2006-04-20T06:22:00.000Z	moonwatcher		and i did that
2006-04-20T06:23:00.000Z	moonwatcher		i think it even authenticated
2006-04-20T06:23:00.000Z	moonwatcher		but i need to have an ipv4 address
2006-04-20T06:23:00.000Z	moonwatcher		ham...
2006-04-20T06:23:00.000Z	moonwatcher		i think so
2006-04-20T06:24:00.000Z	moonwatcher		i use a static dhcp/mac mapping on an opnwrt box
2006-04-20T06:24:00.000Z	simosx	moonwatcher	can you paste the IPv6 IP address line from ifconfig?
2006-04-20T06:26:00.000Z	simosx	moonwatcher	I think that the IPv6 address is not an address that came from the DHCP server. It's just that the DHCP did not work, me  thinks. You can always disable IPv6 on OpenWRT, isn't it?
2006-04-20T06:27:00.000Z	moonwatcher	simosx	i dont think i even have the ipv6 stack installed on the opnwrt box
2006-04-20T06:27:00.000Z	moonwatcher	simosx	i think your first guess was better, dhcp didnt work properly
2006-04-20T06:27:00.000Z	simosx	moonwatcher	so it's a DHCP failure there..
2006-04-20T06:28:00.000Z	moonwatcher	simosx	if i get an ifconfig dump will it help to find out whats wrong? or do i need anything else?
2006-04-20T06:30:00.000Z	simosx	moonwatcher	the "ifconfig" dump will help rule out the IPv6 part. Did you mention it was an IPW2200 wireless card?
2006-04-20T06:30:00.000Z	moonwatcher	simosx	2200BG, yes
2006-04-20T06:31:00.000Z	simosx	moonwatcher	I would recommend to check ubuntuforums, Dapper section for your wireless card. I think I heard other reports on this in Flight 6. www.ubuntuforums.org, section Dapper.
2006-04-20T06:31:00.000Z	moonwatcher	simosx	its a T42
2006-04-20T06:32:00.000Z	moonwatcher	simosx	whats dapper?
