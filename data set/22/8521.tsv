2006-06-19T10:59:00.000Z	Centaur5		I hear it's not possible to install to the new 2.6.17 kernel on Dapper, is that true?
2006-06-19T10:59:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	you can, theoretically, install any kernel you feel like
2006-06-19T10:59:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	Okay, I guess I was told that a lot of things would be broken and have problems.
2006-06-19T11:00:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	'theoretically' :)
2006-06-19T11:00:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	So you would have to be really smart and know what you're doing?
2006-06-19T11:00:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	i don't know, i've never tried it :p
2006-06-19T11:01:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	Oh, alright then.  Well that sucks.
2006-06-19T11:01:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	why, is that your favourite kernel version?
2006-06-19T11:02:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	I just read that the newest kernel would fix the problems with my sound and also it has better support for broadcom so my brother's wireless might work.
2006-06-19T11:02:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	bcm43xx?
2006-06-19T11:03:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	Yeah, I tried everything and can only get it to work if it is manually configured via iwconfig and ifconfig.
2006-06-19T11:03:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	you can't put the iwconfig/ifconfig files into a script to automagically do it?
2006-06-19T11:03:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	Unfortunately I'm not that smart.
2006-06-19T11:04:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	just put the lines into a file
2006-06-19T11:04:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	I actually copied and pasted some scripts that were on the bcm43xx howto and it worked once but never again for some reason.
2006-06-19T11:04:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	and put that file, named 'foo' into /etc/init.d/, then do: update-rc.d foo default
2006-06-19T11:05:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	So will that make it easy to switch between different wireless networks though?
2006-06-19T11:05:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	not at all :p
2006-06-19T11:05:00.000Z	Spec	Centaur5	have you tried blacklisting the bcm43xx driver and using ndiswrapper?
2006-06-19T11:05:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	Ouch, well that sucks.  Stupid broadcom, I wish they would go out of business.
2006-06-19T11:06:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	Yeah, I did try that and still didn't have success.
2006-06-19T11:09:00.000Z	Centaur5	Spec	That's alright, I'll just have to keep hoping there is an easier way to get things going.
