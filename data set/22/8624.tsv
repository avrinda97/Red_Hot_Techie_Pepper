2005-06-27T12:29:00.000Z	_nate_		is there a good gui frontend for dd?  I've tried looking for one to no avail
2005-06-27T12:31:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: a front end for dd? rofl
2005-06-27T12:31:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	ummm, whats so funny?
2005-06-27T12:31:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	I want a gui
2005-06-27T12:31:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: man dd and dd if=/dev/zero of=image.img bs=1M count=699 should get you off
2005-06-27T12:32:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	haha, very funny
2005-06-27T12:32:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: if you use dd for anything, then you dont need a front end.. dd just aint a GUI tool
2005-06-27T12:32:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	there is a GUI with the Helix CD
2005-06-27T12:32:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	I can't find one fore debian
2005-06-27T12:33:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	and I use the cl myself, but for other people I know
2005-06-27T12:33:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: what you need a gui for? read the man page and type the command? and what can you use dd tho that reguired a gui?
2005-06-27T12:33:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	....don't be a troll, I said for other people, namely those who are less linux-savvy
2005-06-27T12:34:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: but for what can non-linux-savvy use dd for?
2005-06-27T12:34:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	backing up their HDD
2005-06-27T12:34:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	I asked for a dd frontend, not for an argument
2005-06-27T12:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: then install the one Helix CD has and i'm not argumenting, look @ freshmeat.net for a GUI
2005-06-27T12:35:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	you disagree with a gui frontend, thats fine, thats enough
2005-06-27T12:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: and i think there are btter backup solutions.
2005-06-27T12:35:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	I did
2005-06-27T12:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_nate_	: just a strange question, if you need a gui great, just wondered why
2005-06-27T12:36:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	yeah, I understand, I just didn't want an argument is all, I'm at work
2005-06-27T12:36:00.000Z	_nate_	lsuactiafner	maybe later we can duke it out :)
