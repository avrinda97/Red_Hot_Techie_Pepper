2010-10-30T06:44:00.000Z	_Neytiri_		sound*
2010-10-30T06:45:00.000Z	_Neytiri_		it is a digital and analog card only showing up as analog
2010-10-30T06:45:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	do you see your cards in 'cat /proc/asound/cards'?
2010-10-30T06:46:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	 yes  0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel
2010-10-30T06:48:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	and intel-hda is your sound card, right?
2010-10-30T06:48:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	 its the built in one yes
2010-10-30T06:50:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	I suppose you are using pulseaudio by default, install pavucontrol: sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
2010-10-30T06:51:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	apt-get install pavucontrol
2010-10-30T06:51:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	pavucontrol is already the newest version
2010-10-30T06:51:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	run as user (or from menu): pavucontrol
2010-10-30T06:51:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	check "Output devices", "Configuration"
2010-10-30T06:52:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	its showing up as a analog only card
2010-10-30T06:53:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	but you want digital, like HDMI, DisplayPort?
2010-10-30T06:54:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	 it has a rca style digital input and output connection
2010-10-30T06:55:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	can you find that in Configuration?
2010-10-30T06:56:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	 nope its all analog options
2010-10-30T06:56:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	then, I suppose it's a kernel issue :(
2010-10-30T06:56:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	the audio card is Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 03)
2010-10-30T06:57:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	I don't even know what rca is :( my intel-hda has HDMI, and it's in pavucontrol auto
2010-10-30T06:59:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	dli	 rca is the style of connection for the digital on the motherboard
2010-10-30T06:59:00.000Z	dli	_Neytiri_	skumara , sorry, got to run, ask your questions to the channel
