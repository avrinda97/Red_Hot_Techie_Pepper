2007-03-10T11:12:00.000Z	ramza3		what is a good text editor, that I can replace gedit with.  Something fast
2007-03-10T11:12:00.000Z	ramza3		not vim
2007-03-10T11:13:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	you try nano?
2007-03-10T11:13:00.000Z	ramza3	peeps	is that xwindows based
2007-03-10T11:13:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	no
2007-03-10T11:13:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	what is wrong with gedit?
2007-03-10T11:14:00.000Z	peeps		thx lirayray, i will try it
2007-03-10T11:14:00.000Z	ramza3		peeps; just one gripe, if I have gedit open and then I open the same file; I get that error "File already open, blah, blah"  why cant it just revert me to the file that is already open
2007-03-10T11:15:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	well you know there is a revert command in the File menu
2007-03-10T11:16:00.000Z	ramza3	peeps	no I mean, gedit trys to have the same file open in 2 tabs, if I try to bring up the same file again; why cant it just keep the same tab
2007-03-10T11:17:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	I just tried to reopen a file, but I do not get any "file already open" message.  it just brings me to the existing tab
2007-03-10T11:18:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	what version of Ubuntu and gedit do you have?
2007-03-10T11:18:00.000Z	ramza3	peeps	6.06 , 2.14
2007-03-10T11:19:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	hmm well it seems to work ok in edgy, which has gedit 2.16.1.  maybe this functionality was changed between those versions
2007-03-10T11:19:00.000Z	ramza3	peeps	did you click on the open option or double click on the file for example, on the desktop
2007-03-10T11:19:00.000Z	peeps		open option
2007-03-10T11:20:00.000Z	ramza3	peeps	try double clicking on a file
2007-03-10T11:20:00.000Z	peeps		ok just tried that, same result, works fine
2007-03-10T11:20:00.000Z	peeps		well, it brings up the existing tab, but does not revert it, if that is what you want
2007-03-10T11:21:00.000Z	peeps	ramza3	maybe you can try the latest version directly from gedit if you don't want to upgrade fully to edgy just for a text editor

2007-03-10T11:22:00.000Z	ramza3	peeps	ok, thanks
