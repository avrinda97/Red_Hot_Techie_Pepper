2005-11-02T07:18:00.000Z	grodius		how to I transfer files from an NTFS partition (has no OS on it)
2005-11-02T07:19:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	mount -t ntfs /dev/??? /mnt/whatever  then  cp <source> <dest>
2005-11-02T07:24:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	sure... ok first you need to know what device the NTFS drive is on. If it was the primary slave drive, 2nd partition, on and IDE/ATA type drive, it would be /dev/hdb2, pri master, 1st part, /dev/hda1 , and so on.. you also need a mount point which is just an empty directory.. lets say /mnt/D is that point.. then you would simply issue the command:   sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hdb2 /mnt/D
2005-11-02T07:26:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	which would make /mnt/D have all the stuff that ntfs drive does... cp is the linux command for 'copy' , so cp /mnt/D/somefile.zip /home/grodius/whateverdir/ would copy a file...
2005-11-02T07:26:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	man cp  and  man mount  for more info..
2005-11-02T07:29:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	does windows call the ntfs drive C ?
2005-11-02T07:30:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	if so, and you installed windows first, /dev/hda1 is the first with IDE.. not sure if sata is different tho...
2005-11-02T07:32:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	type mount alone at a command prompt, and you should see / mount on /dev something... so whatever format that is..
2005-11-02T07:33:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	System > Administration > Disks might be helpfull to you then..
2005-11-02T07:34:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	yea thats linux
2005-11-02T07:35:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	System > Administration > Disks  will tell you whats what in X
2005-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
2005-11-02T07:41:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	mount -t ntfs /dev/sda5 /some/empty/directory
2005-11-02T07:46:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	what do you mean you cant see it?
2005-11-02T07:46:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	what command did you issue?
2005-11-02T07:48:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	umount /dev/sda5 , you shouldnt use you desktop dir as a mount point.... you can mkdir /home/Desktop/NTFS or something.. then do it there...
2005-11-02T07:52:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	umount ... not un
2005-11-02T07:57:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	lol oops
2005-11-02T07:58:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	are you using the user you first created in ubuntu?
2005-11-02T08:00:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	ok, then his uid is 1000.. you need to do.. mount -t ntfs -o uid=1000 /dev/sda? /mnt/point/
2005-11-02T08:03:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	it gives an error or what?? never done it by hand, always do it in the fstab..
2005-11-02T08:09:00.000Z	Cashel	grodius	ok, lets try it a diff way, since I dunno about making it user friendly with the mount command (sudo commands will work on that drive now, but if you want the user using it its different)
