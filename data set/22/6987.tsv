2009-12-18T01:08:00.000Z	doddo		Hello! the EDITOR and VISUAL variables seems to be ignored i keep getting nano as default editor, why is this?
2009-12-18T01:09:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	default editor where?
2009-12-18T01:09:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	everywhere
2009-12-18T01:09:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	that shouldn't be the case, but try: update-alternatives --config editor   (this is system wide)
2009-12-18T01:10:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	hmm why do I need to do that one ? This one should work for example: EDITOR=vim sudo visudo
2009-12-18T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	erm, by "everywhere" did you mean "everywhere with sudo"?  sudo is picky about environment variables :)
2009-12-18T01:11:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	nah not only sudo but also programs liek the editor CVS chooses per default
2009-12-18T01:13:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	cvs should work, how are you calling it?
2009-12-18T01:14:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	cvs commit (i get the nano although both EDITOR and VISUAL is set to vim)
2009-12-18T01:15:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	EDITOR=vim cvs commit  does not use vim?
2009-12-18T01:16:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	not as expected :)
2009-12-18T01:17:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	don't know, I don't have any cvs repositories but at least with bzr it seems to work fine, EDITOR=nano bzr ci   uses nano
2009-12-18T01:17:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	OK but does EDITOR=vim bzr ci  use nano aswel ?
2009-12-18T01:18:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	well my default EDITOR is vim, so I figured I would test with nano.  To answer your question, yes: EDITOR=vim bzr ci  uses vim
2009-12-18T01:19:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	do you have CVSEDITOR set?
2009-12-18T01:20:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	actually, does calling « vim » by itself work for you?
2009-12-18T01:21:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	oh :)
2009-12-18T01:21:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	aye it does
2009-12-18T01:21:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	likely something is wrong with my env ...
2009-12-18T01:21:00.000Z	jrib	doddo	strange
2009-12-18T01:22:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	aye! =)
2009-12-18T01:36:00.000Z	doddo	jrib	hmm it seeseemd to ignore the EDITOR and the VISUAL variables vbut CVSEDITOR worked. Strange. Anyhow thanks!
