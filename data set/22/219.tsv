2012-03-13T12:51:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	you need to do some NAT in your adsl box
2012-03-13T12:55:00.000Z	danielg25	bluefrog	I don't have ADSL, I have a DSL modem and a Belkin router.
2012-03-13T12:56:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	you need to forward port from dsl modem (or router, or both) to your puter
2012-03-13T12:57:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	and you'd better learn about ssh tunneling and use vnc IN ssh. then you only need to forward port 22
2012-03-13T12:57:00.000Z	danielg25		the modem doesn't have a firewall or even a config page so it shouldn't be a problem. What ports need to be forwarded?
2012-03-13T12:58:00.000Z	danielg25		I have no idea, but it sounds like it
2012-03-13T13:02:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	then you may have to tweak your belkin router. right now it seems that desktop sharing is not accessible from the internet to your puter
2012-03-13T13:04:00.000Z	danielg25	bluefrog	What ports does Desktop Sharing use?
2012-03-13T13:05:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	vnc I think so 5900 and/or 5800
2012-03-13T13:05:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	but not a good idea to do so
2012-03-13T13:05:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	use ssh tunneling
2012-03-13T13:05:00.000Z	danielg25		why?
2012-03-13T13:06:00.000Z	danielg25		I have a password on the Desktop Sharing, is it still not a good idea?
2012-03-13T13:06:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	passwords can be read very easily
2012-03-13T13:06:00.000Z	danielg25		Oh :(
2012-03-13T13:06:00.000Z	danielg25		Well how do I do the SSH thing?
2012-03-13T13:06:00.000Z	danielg25		SSH tunneling

2012-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	danielg25		ok
2012-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC
2012-03-13T13:08:00.000Z	danielg25	bluefrog	I will be using a Mac to connect to the desktop at my house, will that matter?
2012-03-13T13:08:00.000Z	bluefrog	danielg25	no
