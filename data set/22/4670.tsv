2008-01-19T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	I don't think it's in the PPC community repo's
2008-01-19T01:07:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ikonia	well from what iv read it is sudo apt-get install mozilla-plugin-gnash CruCio
2008-01-19T01:08:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	on PPC ?
2008-01-19T01:08:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	I don't think it actually exists in the PPC repo
2008-01-19T01:08:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ikonia	on psubuntu.com iv found that it does http://psubuntu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6583&sid=a4dd3adba62f64a67c926ecf1afe3b43

2008-05-14T21:23:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ikonia	ok, for some reason kdm is being used instead of gdm. how would I change it back?
2008-05-14T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	ahhh, now we are getting somewhere
2008-05-14T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	one moment, I have a forum thread for you on that too
2008-05-14T21:25:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	can't find it, but ir you go "system --> administation --> login window" you should be able to select it to that
2008-05-14T21:26:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ikonia	it sinply says gdm isn't running so I can't change the setup
2008-05-14T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	ah, thats annoying
2008-05-14T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	rinaldi_	there is a config for that, one moment
