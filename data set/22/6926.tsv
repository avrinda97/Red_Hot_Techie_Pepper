2006-06-21T08:00:00.000Z	dgl		Hi, anyone can help me to make a raid 1?
2006-06-21T08:01:00.000Z	dgl		Can I make raid 1 with an entire disk?
2006-06-21T08:02:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	you need more than one disk for raid
2006-06-21T08:02:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	I have 2 SATA disks
2006-06-21T08:03:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	You should be able to set up a software RAID 1 config. useing SATA disk 1 (the second one) as the mirror
2006-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	ok, but I have to do this at instalatin time or can be done after?
2006-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	have I to do this at instalation time or can be it done after?
2006-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	I think it can be done post-installation
2006-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	but you can do it at installation
2006-06-21T08:05:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	I ve tried to this at installatin, but I cant
2006-06-21T08:06:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	in the installation you should get to the partition bit, select manually edit the partion table, select software RAID
2006-06-21T08:06:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	it should guide you through from there
2006-06-21T08:07:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	I ve tried, but it seems doesnt working fine
2006-06-21T08:09:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	when I tried to this at post-installation I couldnt raid 1 at / because it was mounted
2006-06-21T08:09:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	Do you have a third disk?
2006-06-21T08:09:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	no
2006-06-21T08:10:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	What do you want to do? Why the mirroring?
2006-06-21T08:10:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	it will be a server and I need raid 1 to make it safe
2006-06-21T08:14:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	should I use alternate or server to make raids?
2006-06-21T08:14:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	I though server would be fine if you don't need a GUI
2006-06-21T08:15:00.000Z	dgl	HBuzacott	ok, is there a way to use the second raid disk without partioning it?
2006-06-21T08:16:00.000Z	HBuzacott	dgl	?
