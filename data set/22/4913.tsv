2008-09-09T01:33:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿ I downloaded the Kubuntu 8.04.1 ISO and was installing it in Virtual Box ,, I got a popup window saying that the session was locked and its asking for a password to unlock it..... whats the password?
2008-09-09T01:34:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	whatever your user password is. The automatic locking is to prevent others from using your machine if you walk away and forget to log out
2008-09-09T01:35:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿dep: well its the live session ... and the user name is ubuntu ...
2008-09-09T01:35:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	oh, LiveCD? Interesting....I'm assuming you tried to just use a blank password, right?
2008-09-09T01:36:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿dep: I pressed a key combination and the window popped up saying the session has been locked ... asking for a password
2008-09-09T01:36:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿dep: yes I tried it blank
2008-09-09T01:37:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	k, one sec, trying to recreate with a virtbox session
2008-09-09T01:37:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿dep: ok thanks
2008-09-09T01:40:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	ok, try this: switch to a virtual terminal by hitting "ctrl-alt-F6", which should be already logged in, and then typing "sudo passwd ubuntu" to switch the password, then press "ctrl-alt-F7" to get back to the locked screen
2008-09-09T01:42:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿dep: that send me to login to my real user.... and I don't want to do that
2008-09-09T01:44:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	ok, perhaps I misunderstood the problem, you're using a LiveCD and accidentally brought up the screen lock utility, but there is not a valid password for the user "ubuntu", right?
2008-09-09T01:45:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿dep: I am using the liveCD ISO in Virtual Box
2008-09-09T01:45:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿dep: and I am stuck in there
2008-09-09T01:45:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	ooooh, sorry, I missed the fact that you were in VB
2008-09-09T01:46:00.000Z	zetheroo		deb: yeah
2008-09-09T01:46:00.000Z	zetheroo	dep	yeah
2008-09-09T01:47:00.000Z	zetheroo	dep	well i went ahead and reset it
2008-09-09T01:48:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	oh, well, you just want to use the host key instead of ctrl-alt to access the ttys, for example, instead of "ctrl-alt-F6" hit "host key-F6"
2008-09-09T01:48:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	doh
2008-09-09T01:48:00.000Z	zetheroo	dep	thankfully the install was complete
2008-09-09T01:49:00.000Z	dep	zetheroo	excellent, disaster narrowly averted
2008-09-09T01:49:00.000Z	zetheroo	dep	ha ... yeah
