2008-01-02T19:18:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	waht is the problem
2008-01-02T19:24:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	you deleted the files from your user space (home) or elsewhere? what did you delete and how much space are we talking?
2008-01-02T19:26:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	well if other things are linked to that then it would show as still being used iirc
2008-01-02T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	are you trying to do something in particular or just running out of space or just concerned your setup may not working
2008-01-02T19:35:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	no worries sCOTTo--come back when/if you have questions :}
2008-01-02T19:35:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	oops sorry
2008-01-02T19:36:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	you want to get back those deleted files or just be sure those things are really deleted?
2008-01-02T19:38:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	you can type df -a to see free space and see if that lines up with what you expected
2008-01-02T19:39:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	sorry in the terminal type df -a
2008-01-02T19:44:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	did that solve your issue? was the free space there?
2008-01-02T19:50:00.000Z	bazhang	kikdadog	unless its a hardware issue should be ok, but running at that full will surely slow things down a bit :}
