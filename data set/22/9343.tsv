2010-11-13T11:29:00.000Z	jep1985		Galeon is also decent
2010-11-13T11:29:00.000Z	jep1985		i haven't bothered with opera too much
2010-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	jep1985		alrighty
2010-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	jep1985		i'm on the endless quest for a noob friendly server environment
2010-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	jep1985		*developing
2010-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	jep1985		yes that's my next chore
2010-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	jep1985		soon as i stop installing different distros on my virt server
2010-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	jep1985		always end up back with ubuntu..
2010-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	jep1985		oh i can do it from the CLI no problem, this is just a project i'd like to start sometime to get more people to choose linux over windows
2010-11-13T11:34:00.000Z	jep1985		i.e. a linux "Server Manager" comparable to the server manager gui in windows server 2008
2010-11-13T11:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	there used to be webmin, but i found it to be cumbersome... i find that the power of a linux server comes from its endless configurability and inevitable difficulty
2010-11-13T11:38:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	the intended audience should be people who actually know what they're doing with servers in the first place... if they can run a web server on Windows Server, IIS or whatever, they should be able to apply the same concepts in Linux... if they can't, then they are proving that they didn't know what they were doing in the first place.
2010-11-13T11:39:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	all you're doing is re-affirming how completely useless all those arcane and wasteful certifications are, like Net+, Server+, MCSE, etc...
2010-11-13T11:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	no no, 2 server clones with a heartbeat backup running between them...
2010-11-13T11:46:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	i never really got into that whole xen/kvm thing... i mostly like messing with ultra SSO setups for internet connection sharing and such
2010-11-13T11:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	gotta love LDAP for powerful account management...
2010-11-13T12:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	i wish there was better documentation for tc... but good luck finding anything that makes sense on that...
2010-11-13T12:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	i *get* it now, but i think i'm the only one (well, me and that russian mad-man that wrote it)
2010-11-13T12:36:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	to me, who likes routers, i find that tc is the most powerful application available for linux... but thats just em
2010-11-13T12:37:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	traffic control, its part of the iproute2 package, hardcore networking/routing/traffic_control from the command line
2010-11-13T12:40:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	no no, she mentioned earlier that it didn't ask during the install
2010-11-14T00:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	jep1985	don't you sleep?
