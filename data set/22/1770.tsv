2010-01-19T01:45:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	can u help me out? i told you what my problems are and what im running... ATI mobility radeon 9000. Programs that require OpenGl (i think) crash out before even really loading anything and I get 'Segmentation fault'. I'm running Ubuntu 9.10
2010-01-19T01:46:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	it has been since I have used old ATI gear and the 3d drivers (I have one machine that I use the 2d only drivers)
2010-01-19T01:47:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	under System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers, do you have the ati or fglrx drivers installed?
2010-01-19T01:48:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	i opened that up it says no proprietary drivers are in use on this system
2010-01-19T01:49:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	then you will need to install the fglrx drivers to get 3d (open gl) apps to work
2010-01-19T01:49:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	how do i do that? Ive been asking that all day and no one will answer
2010-01-19T01:50:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	sudo aptitude install xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx-amdcccle
2010-01-19T01:57:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	still nothing runs
2010-01-19T01:57:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	glxinfo

2010-01-19T02:02:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	that is way less output than I would expect.  IS the module loaded?  "lsmod |grep fglrx"
2010-01-19T02:03:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	I put in lsmod |grep fglrx but it doesnt have any output, should it have?
2010-01-19T02:04:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	try "sudo modprobe fglrx"
2010-01-19T02:07:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	http://pastebin.com/d1ce93768
2010-01-19T02:07:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	ya I saw that, that is a new error to me.  You may wish to try rebooting.
2010-01-19T02:08:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	I am not really confidant that it will solve anything
2010-01-19T02:09:00.000Z	meganerd	CAPcap	do you have a program called aticonfig installed?
2010-01-19T02:13:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	i typed aticonfig into the terminal and got this: aticonfig: No supported adapters detected
2010-01-19T02:21:00.000Z	CAPcap	meganerd	aticonfig: No supported adapters detected
