2009-05-17T06:21:00.000Z	Stepan1		In the middle of burning a CD, I got an error.  What i noticed what my ROM got unmounted.  Now, I can't even get the cd out.  Any way to remount?  Don't feel like rebooting.
2009-05-17T06:21:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	did you try unmounting via GUI under the "computer" section ?
2009-05-17T06:22:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	Just tried.  Says unable to mount.  No media in drive.
2009-05-17T06:23:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	it does not offer the unmount option? if so i'll get you the commandline command
2009-05-17T06:24:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	thing is, it unmounted by itself.  It just disappeared from the panel
2009-05-17T06:25:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	check whats your CD-rom by using "df" then "unmount /dev/hdX" could work, i'm not even sure
2009-05-17T06:26:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	"sudo eject -r"
2009-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	that ejected my second drive (with no cd in it)
2009-05-17T06:28:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	output of df http://tinypaste.com/6b148
2009-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	hmm i'm not sure then :( Can't find a way to tell the eject command which cd-rom to use :(
2009-05-17T06:31:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	post the content of /etc/fstab to no-paste
2009-05-17T06:33:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	an quick and dirty way would be to use the paperclip and press into the small hole/button to force ecject it :D
2009-05-17T06:34:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	fstab http://paste.ubuntu.com/173993/
2009-05-17T06:35:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	"eject -r -v /dev/scd0" or "eject -r -v /dev/scd1"
2009-05-17T06:38:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	scd1 ejected my second drive (the one with no probs), scd0 gave http://paste.ubuntu.com/173995/
2009-05-17T06:41:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	try using sudo, next try this command: "sudo eject -s -v /dev/sdc0"
2009-05-17T06:42:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	same issue
2009-05-17T06:43:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	okay, i used the paper clip, it was still spinning
2009-05-17T06:43:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	i guess i should reboot, but i hope it wont unmount again
2009-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	maybe yeah
2009-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	Stepan1	smerz	thanks for your help
2009-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	smerz	Stepan1	oh well it wasnt of any use really ;)
