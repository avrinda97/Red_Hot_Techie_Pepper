2011-04-30T22:57:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	 I have posted that
2011-04-30T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	no, just explain the problem
2011-04-30T22:57:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	 Okay
2011-04-30T22:58:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	 During execution of the program terminal stucks at "Starting Installation Wizard" and no wizard comes up ever
2011-04-30T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	no
2011-04-30T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	sorry, not you
2011-04-30T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	what are you trying to install
2011-04-30T22:59:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	 netbeans 7.0
2011-04-30T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	ok - so what else isn't installing as you said you can't install "any .sh" files, and your describing one .sh file
2011-04-30T23:01:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	 i also tried netbeans setup bundled with jdk6. same problem
2011-04-30T23:01:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	may have to contact the .sh file owner/support then if it's just that one
2011-04-30T23:02:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	but its working fine on my PC with 10.10
2011-04-30T23:02:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	you're not using 10.10 though, so that's not relevant
2011-04-30T23:02:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	 but that clears file is correct.
2011-04-30T23:03:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	no it doesn't, it means that file works with ubuntu 10.10 - that you're not using, so it's not relevant
2011-04-30T23:03:00.000Z	p_ahuja	ikonia	 okay can you send me a link of any working sh file (small) on natty. i try that
2011-04-30T23:04:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	no
2011-04-30T23:04:00.000Z	ikonia	p_ahuja	no
