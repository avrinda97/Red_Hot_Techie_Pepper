2004-11-03T17:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	 you can add a bash script on all your comps to report when it is shutting down. I don't know if that is what you mean ?
2004-11-03T17:58:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	hm, that's an idea, was more thinking along the lines of a script that alerts me when a computer comes online/goes offline, but I can let them tell me as well
2004-11-03T17:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	 is this a server running a particular service or just a reandom desktop machine ?
2004-11-03T17:59:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	random desktop machines
2004-11-03T06:00:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	 how many :D
2004-11-03T06:00:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	4
2004-11-03T06:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	 You could add a bash script to notify your workstation when it enters runlevel 0 suppose. It's a good idea actually :D
2004-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	now I need to figure out a nice way to handle those alerts
2004-11-03T06:05:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	I already got nice launchers on my bar to those computers, would be nice if it somehow would show at the launcher if the computer is online or not 
2004-11-03T06:06:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	 maybe I will write a small python app to monitor computer activity on a small network. (I am looking for a project that might actually be usefull) :P
2004-11-03T06:06:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	I'd be interested to help testing, not much of a programmer myself, can just decipher existing programs/scripts to alter them if needed but that's the limit of my knowledge
2004-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	I want to write a small client/server app using Python. This might be a good project :)
2004-11-03T06:15:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	if you're busy trying anyway; I got an extra request, if the computer is up, the monitor app can be used to ssh into that box ;)
2004-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	I am thinking that the admin should also be able to see what each user is doing. Maybe with exporting X via and encrypted tunnel to the Administrators/Parent's desktop.
2004-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	there's this nifty remote desktop app, that could be used I guess
2004-11-03T06:21:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	although I prefer ssh, since most of the time I don't care that much, just need to update
2004-11-03T06:32:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	yeah it's called auto-update ;) - but seriously don't know
2004-11-05T13:35:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	did you get around to try to write that notification application?
2004-11-05T13:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	I am too busy atm. But it's something that I will do ya ;)
2004-11-05T13:35:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	ah ok, good - was just wondering ;)
2004-11-08T07:27:00.000Z	stvn	LinuxJones	i thought that morphix is a derivative of gnoppix that being a derivative of knoppix ;)
2004-11-08T07:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	stvn	gnoppix is a derivative of Morphix as well, There are too many distros to keep track of :)
