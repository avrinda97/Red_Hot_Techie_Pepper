2009-05-05T04:05:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	yes
2009-05-05T04:13:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you want to go
2009-05-05T04:13:00.000Z	amnesiauk	billybigrigger	as far as possible:p
2009-05-05T04:13:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	linux can be hard, or not, depends on your usage
2009-05-05T04:13:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	but it gets easier with time, the more you use it on a daily basis the easier it gets
2009-05-05T04:13:00.000Z	amnesiauk	billybigrigger	 well understanding the filesystem, know where everythings located, know how everything works
2009-05-05T04:14:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	time, some/alot of reading
2009-05-05T04:14:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	all depends on how much you want to learn
2009-05-05T04:14:00.000Z	amnesiauk	billybigrigger	quite a shame but I'm still too narrowminded cause of windows:(
2009-05-05T04:15:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	just jump right into it, ditch windows, you'll thank yourself later...
2009-05-05T04:15:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	if somethings broken, fix it, thats how you learn :P
2009-05-05T04:15:00.000Z	billybigrigger	amnesiauk	don't give up on linux because something broke and your too lazy to fix it :P ubuntuforums.org is a great place to find info
