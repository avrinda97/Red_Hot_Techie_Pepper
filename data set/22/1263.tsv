2010-11-20T18:19:00.000Z	Solow		Am I asking such weird questions? I've been asking the same question for 2 days and nobody has replied yet.
2010-11-20T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	what is your problem
2010-11-20T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	many reasons
2010-11-20T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	what hardware is this on ?
2010-11-20T18:22:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	Gnea, I've installed ubuntu before on this machine. many times before. I've tried 2 hard drives, one fresh from the box.
2010-11-20T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	what hardware is this on
2010-11-20T18:24:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	acer extensa 5220, 1GB ram, dual core processor.
2010-11-20T18:24:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	oh and 320GB hd and 80GB hd. (tried both) it's a laptop.
2010-11-20T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	what happens when you try to install the desktop ?
2010-11-20T18:26:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	said it at [14:21]: I tried server, desktop, and netbook. same result everywhere.
2010-11-20T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	you have no mount point
2010-11-20T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	sorry - not you
2010-11-20T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	what happens when you try to install the desktop
2010-11-20T18:27:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	 I just answered that question :p
2010-11-20T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	what is the problem when you try to install the desktop version
2010-11-20T18:28:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	I already said that, three times so far. :S
2010-11-20T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	this is why you are not getting help - I'm asking you to explain what happens when you install the desktop version
2010-11-20T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	instead of saying "I've said" tell me, as I obviously didn't see it, or you didn't explain it clearly
2010-11-20T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	2nd coloumn "none" needs to be a mount point
2010-11-20T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Solow	sorry - not you
2010-11-20T18:29:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	I answered this question three times already. I'll paste the answer again:
2010-11-20T18:29:00.000Z	Solow	ikonia	[14:21] <Solow> I'll rephrase my question... Is there any reason why all ubuntu installations would fail? ubuntu server is stuck at 45% when starting the partitioner. ubuntu netbook and desktop freeze right after 'preparing ubuntu installation' (where you get to select 'download updates while installing').
