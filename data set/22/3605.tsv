2008-08-05T18:46:00.000Z	KINGABAN		sorry guys ^_^
2008-08-05T18:47:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers -> click the enable check box
2008-08-05T18:47:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	you may have to install the new nvidia driver for it to work though
2008-08-05T18:48:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	one sec, im looking up the file name
2008-08-05T18:48:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2008-08-05T18:49:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	np :)
2008-08-05T18:50:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	retry the system->administration->hardware drivers-> check the enable checkbox
2008-08-05T18:51:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	another way to be sure if your driver is installed is by typing "glxinfo | grep direct_rendering
2008-08-05T18:55:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	are you sure it removed the driver? did you check in synaptic to see if the driver is still installed? besides it needs a reboot to completely install the driver
2008-08-05T19:27:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	im still here
2008-08-05T19:27:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	did it work?
2008-08-05T19:28:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	you may just have to install the driver straight from the nvidia site then
2008-08-05T19:28:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	nvidia provides documentation about how to install their driver on their website
2008-08-05T19:30:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	you could try the other nvidia drivers in the ubuntu repository
2008-08-05T19:31:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	open synaptic, then type nvidia
2008-08-05T19:33:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	im dont like how ubuntu cant just detect your card and select the proper drivers for you :(
2008-08-05T19:34:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	KINGABAN	im saying i wish it would
