2009-03-09T15:15:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	Yeah. I found it.. Downloading is (almost) working flawlessly. It couldn't find two files but I'll update the rest and check for them later.
2009-04-11T04:22:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	Thanks! It was in /opt :P
2009-04-11T04:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	try typing the app name it installs
2009-04-11T04:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	use tab completion

2009-04-11T04:14:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	Doesn't work.. I installed gtkradiant which I converted from a .rpm
2009-04-11T04:14:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	Do i need to update the path?
2009-04-11T04:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	no it should put a binary in /usr/bin     converting from rpm is NOT advised
2009-04-11T04:16:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	Well i found a tutorial on how to install rpm uner ybuntu
2009-04-11T04:16:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	So i did it
2009-04-11T04:17:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	Shouldn't there be a log file for dpkg?
2009-04-11T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	rpm is different to rpm and their actions cant be guaranteed
2009-04-11T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	not sure
2009-04-11T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	try typing gtkr then press tab
2009-04-11T04:20:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	I have
2009-04-11T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	the try: sudo find / -name gtkrad*
2009-04-11T04:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riwa	you can create a symlink in /usr/bin to the binary so you can execute it from any where
2009-04-11T04:24:00.000Z	riwa	ActionParsnip	I know. But thanks :)
