2009-09-05T18:44:00.000Z	irocksu		where do i get monitor drivers for linux?
2009-09-05T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	you dont, monitors dont need drivers
2009-09-05T18:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	then you need to use settings that suit the monitor that doesnt work
2009-09-05T18:45:00.000Z	irocksu	ActionParsnip	it works on 1280x1024 but the monitor supports 1600x1200
2009-09-05T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	then you may need different xorg settings
2009-09-05T18:47:00.000Z	irocksu	ActionParsnip	any suggestions where to start searching?
2009-09-05T18:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	sudo lshw -C display will tell you the video card, you can then websearch from that will get you startd, you may have to manually set the resolution and refresh in xorg.conf
2012-01-05T03:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	do you mean like a locel repo?
2012-01-05T03:49:00.000Z	irocksu	ActionParsnip	yeah, but i do not want scanpackage
2012-01-05T03:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LocalAptGetRepository
2012-11-23T03:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	don't all spellchecks use wordlists?
2012-11-29T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	what if you run: sikuli-ide    in a terminal, does it run?
2012-11-29T18:16:00.000Z	irocksu	ActionParsnip	i ran it from the terminal
2012-11-29T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	does it launch ok though?
2012-11-29T18:16:00.000Z	irocksu	ActionParsnip	No gui at all.
2012-11-29T18:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	ahh then you'll need a .desktop file for it in /usr/share/applications
2012-11-29T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	let me see if there is one online
2012-11-29T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	you can make your own. I can't find one online. You can copy one from ~/.config/autostart and make it run what you wish
2012-11-29T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	I suggest you report a bug :)
2012-11-29T18:21:00.000Z	irocksu	ActionParsnip	Will do once I get this thing running :)
2012-11-29T18:22:00.000Z	irocksu	ActionParsnip	Thanks for your help
2012-11-29T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	irocksu	thats how you get things to display, each app has one
