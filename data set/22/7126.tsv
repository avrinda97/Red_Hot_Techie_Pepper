2006-05-30T10:09:00.000Z	kapputu		how do I install mplayer?
2006-05-30T10:09:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	it should be installed by default
2006-05-30T10:11:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	it's not installed by default
2006-06-04T11:13:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	chill out, i was just seaching for the package for you lol
2006-06-04T11:16:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	synaptic is good for finding stuff like that
2006-06-04T11:54:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	is your network behind a router?
2006-06-04T11:54:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	yes it's behind a router
2006-06-04T11:55:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	ok first ping the router, it will be listed as eth0s gateway
2006-06-04T11:55:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	I also pinged other machines on my network
2006-06-04T11:56:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	why? Everything else on my network is fine
2006-06-04T11:56:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	it is possible that the problem is on the WAN side and not the lan side of your network
2006-06-04T11:56:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	no
2006-06-04T11:57:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	yes
2006-06-04T12:00:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	it's a router
2006-06-04T12:05:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	just how minimal is your box which isnt working? is it a ubuntu server installation?
2006-06-04T12:05:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	yes it is
2006-06-04T12:06:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	I haven't done anything else with it, well I couldn't basically :-)
2006-06-04T12:08:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	dhcp should sort the DNS out i believe :) the DHCP server handles it
2006-06-04T12:08:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	I'm having trouble with my ISP's DNS
2006-06-04T12:09:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	try pinging www.google.com then try pinging 66.102.9.147
2006-06-04T12:09:00.000Z	kapputu	skippy81	yeah I have done all that, the problem is with the DNS
2006-06-04T12:09:00.000Z	skippy81	kapputu	 if the second works but the first doesnt, then it is possible your ISP is messing things up - mine had the same problem
