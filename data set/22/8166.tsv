2007-10-29T17:58:00.000Z	blakeg		viciouspotato: my best luck with nvidia and compiz has always been to remove ALL the restricted manager stuff, ALL the nvidia-glx* stuff and then download the nvidia drivers pkg from nvidia.com and install it that way
2007-10-29T17:59:00.000Z	blakeg		viciouspotato: just my 2cents...
2007-10-29T17:59:00.000Z	blakeg		okay viciouspotato. heres what you do... *gets another monster and goes to work*
2007-10-29T18:00:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- I think that may have been an answer to me, not VP.
2007-10-29T18:01:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	I'm having all sorts of problems with compiz on nvidia.  It was all working just fine, and then I restarted gdm, and it's not!  I've tried purging all the packages, but to no avail.  I get a login prompt, login, see the toolbars and the wallpaper, and then all that's visible is the wallpaper.  mouse works, that's it.  any ideas, please, please?  oh - it's nvidia-glx-new under ubuntu, if it matters.
2007-10-29T18:01:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- np.
2007-10-29T18:06:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- I've done it before, but can't work out how to identify the card model number.  any ideas?
2007-10-29T18:16:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- just got and compiled the nvidia-supplied drivers.  exactly the same behaviour.  X comes up, login prompt, login, see toolbars briefly, then just the wallpaper.
2007-10-29T18:18:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- where do you want it pasted?
2007-10-29T18:20:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- just posted it, but can't see a URL.
2007-10-29T18:25:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- you think I should try adding those changes?
2007-10-29T18:28:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- I'm not convinced that it's not configging correctly.  it's worked fine, and displays all right.  I'm using 100.14.11
2007-10-29T18:30:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	did have.  ;-)
2007-10-29T18:36:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	yup.
2007-10-29T18:39:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- naughty, naughty - trying to make my keyboard think it was US!  Spotted that...
2007-10-29T18:39:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- just rebooting.
2007-10-29T18:43:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- I've got that annoying "ubuntu is running in low-graphics mode" prompt.
2007-10-29T18:51:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- desparately in need of a cup of tea.  back in a minute...
2007-10-29T18:51:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	(oh, and I'm rebooting).
2007-10-29T18:56:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- that's what I did at the start of the process.  these are the very latest ones.
2007-10-29T19:05:00.000Z	MikeCamel	blakeg	- yahoo?
