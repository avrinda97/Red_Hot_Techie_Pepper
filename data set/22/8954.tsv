2009-01-25T14:45:00.000Z	ftab		Default Input is Alsa
2009-01-25T14:46:00.000Z	ftab		but still no sound :(
2009-01-25T14:46:00.000Z	ftab		in Flash it's working now, but in totem it's not
2009-01-25T14:46:00.000Z	ftab		what's the command to remove the pulseaudio btw?
2009-01-25T14:47:00.000Z	ftab		ok
2009-01-25T14:47:00.000Z	ftab		but why not both sources?
2009-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	ftab		nothing
2009-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	ftab		pulseaudio is not currently installed, and jim_p is sayinh that I don't need that
2009-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	ftab		and I heard that some where else too
2009-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	ftab		I can't hear sound from 2 sources simultenously
2009-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ftab	pulseaudio is okay if you only ever want to use the latest linux-only software, usually media players
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	ftab		will the skypw work with that?
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ftab	if you want to use music software or play games, pulseaudio will just annoy you
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ftab	nope
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	ftab		ah
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	ftab		I need both skype & media players :(
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ftab	well, I've never got it to work
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	ftab		static skype works with OSS
2009-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	ftab	cwillu	when I try to open the pulseaudio -D it fails
2009-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	ftab		W: ltdl-bind-now.c: Failed to find original dlopen loader.
2009-01-25T14:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ftab	put it this way, I'm hoping that for Jaunty the Ubuntu devs realise the terrible mistakes of Intrepid
2009-01-25T14:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ftab	and I'm hoping that pulseaudio gets either left out or fixed
