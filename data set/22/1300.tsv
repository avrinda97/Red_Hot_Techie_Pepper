2010-11-06T01:09:00.000Z	n0a1ias		i cant find the ATI catalyst drivers for Linux on their website
2010-11-06T01:09:00.000Z	n0a1ias		is it in the repos
2010-11-06T01:10:00.000Z	Belial`	n0a1ias	use the fglrx driver. or the open source driver.
2010-11-06T01:10:00.000Z	n0a1ias		Beligal' where can i find that?
2010-11-06T01:11:00.000Z	Belial`	n0a1ias	system, administration, additional drivers. if fglrx isn't listed there, then ati's proprietary linux driver doesn't support your card anymore. in which case you're already using the open source radeon drivers.
2010-11-06T01:12:00.000Z	n0a1ias		Belial' i don't see any drivers, but i have a new card by them, so it should be supported
2010-11-06T01:13:00.000Z	Belial`	n0a1ias	sudo apt-get install fglrx
2010-11-06T01:14:00.000Z	n0a1ias	Belial`	it says i already have it
2010-11-06T01:14:00.000Z	Belial`		then you're fine
2010-11-06T01:14:00.000Z	Belial`		fglrx is the equivalent to the catalyst driver in windows, n0a1ias.
2010-11-06T01:14:00.000Z	n0a1ias		but my resolution sucks. and I'm just getting a clone of my moniter on my second one
2010-11-06T01:15:00.000Z	Belial`	n0a1ias	it's not letting you change the resolution at all?
2010-11-06T01:15:00.000Z	n0a1ias		not any higher then the resoultion of the second moniter, witch is pretty bad... Belial`
2010-11-06T01:16:00.000Z	Belial`	n0a1ias	which card is it?
2010-11-06T01:16:00.000Z	n0a1ias	Belial`	the 8x30
2010-11-06T01:16:00.000Z	n0a1ias		i dont remember the exact number Belial`
2010-11-06T01:16:00.000Z	n0a1ias		but i can check
2010-11-06T01:17:00.000Z	Belial`	n0a1ias	i wouldn't be able to help you too much on the dual monitor issue. but as far as your main display, everything should be fine.
2010-11-06T01:18:00.000Z	n0a1ias		its the 5830 Belial`
2010-11-06T01:19:00.000Z	n0a1ias		i got the card number wrong, thats why it wasnt working
2010-11-06T01:19:00.000Z	n0a1ias		thatnks for your help Belial`
2010-11-06T01:20:00.000Z	Belial`	n0a1ias	sorry man. hopefully someone here or on the board can help with your dual monitors.
