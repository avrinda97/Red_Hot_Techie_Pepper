2008-01-04T14:38:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	you might be a bit out of luck, virtualization probably would be slow
2008-01-04T14:38:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	they've a Linux i686 binary, nothing for PPC
2008-01-04T14:39:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	no, unless you ran a VM, that would probably be slow and useless for Second Life
2008-01-04T14:39:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	i686 apps don't run on a PPC without emulation
2008-01-04T14:40:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	as far as I know, no
2008-01-04T14:40:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	if it was Intel in that iBook different story :)
2008-01-04T14:40:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	for your SL playing needs yes
2008-01-04T14:41:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	I'm not sure if their Mac OS X binary works on PPC
2008-01-04T14:41:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	you'd probably have to see
2008-01-04T14:41:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	then sadly, it's SoL
2008-01-04T14:41:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	Windows on PPC? wouldn't that be dead slow?
2008-01-04T14:42:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	well, you can try that if you want, go for it
2008-01-04T14:43:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	System -> Prefs -> Hardware Information
2008-01-04T14:43:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	or lshw, see man lshw
2008-01-04T14:44:00.000Z	scguy318	sam__	at the Terminal, list hardware
