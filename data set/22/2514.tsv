2010-11-24T15:14:00.000Z	rww	solofight	If your CPU supports 64-bit, you can use 64-bit. If not, you can use PAE.
2010-11-24T15:15:00.000Z	solofight	rww	thanks for the link, will i be restricted in any way if i use the 64 bit os ?
2010-11-24T15:16:00.000Z	rww	solofight	Not really. I use 64-bit and haven't had problems, though some people in here claim to have issues with Flash and other non-open-source stuff.
2010-11-24T15:17:00.000Z	solofight	rww	whoa, you didnt have any issues with flash right ?
2010-11-24T15:17:00.000Z	rww	solofight	no

2010-11-24T15:23:00.000Z	solofight	rww	whats the difference between the usual 10 version and the LTS one ?
2010-11-24T15:24:00.000Z	rww	solofight	LTS releases are supported for three years on desktops and five years on servers. Normal releases are eighteen months for both. 10.04 is an LTS release, 10.10 isn't.
2010-11-24T15:25:00.000Z	solofight	rww	whoa, thank you
2010-11-24T15:25:00.000Z	rww	solofight	yes

2010-11-24T16:08:00.000Z	rww	solofight	amd64 = x86_64 = Intel 64, does not equal IA-64
2010-11-25T11:21:00.000Z	solofight	rww	:)
2010-11-25T11:22:00.000Z	rww	solofight	hello :)
2010-11-25T11:25:00.000Z	rww	solofight	I'd probably do Windows XP, then Windows 7, then Ubuntu, but I haven't done this before and am not at all a dualbooting expert.
2010-11-25T11:26:00.000Z	solofight	rww	yeah in any order is ok, but how to ?
2010-11-25T11:34:00.000Z	rww	solofight	no
2010-11-25T11:34:00.000Z	rww	solofight	You can't do netflix instant watch on Linux. It uses DRM that makes it impossible.
