2007-03-16T12:35:00.000Z	Andeh		thanks bafoc
2007-03-16T12:35:00.000Z	Andeh		But its exactly those commands that mess it.
2007-03-16T12:36:00.000Z	Andeh		XFCE is the lightest gui nepshyche
2007-03-16T12:36:00.000Z	Andeh		Yes but i am on a laptop :-(
2007-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	Andeh		So whats the best, easiest fastest way to install beryl? Under fedora it's "click, click, click click, click" and done. Ubuntu seems more... tedious
2007-03-16T12:38:00.000Z	Andeh		thats all i want to do but the guides dont work
2007-03-16T12:38:00.000Z	Andeh		lol ok
2007-03-16T12:39:00.000Z	Andeh		Did you already have your proper drivers installed bafoc?
2007-03-16T12:39:00.000Z	Andeh		aaaagh
2007-03-16T12:40:00.000Z	Andeh		Where do i get PROPER, WORKING, NON STUPID ati drivers? All the official ones require you to run aticonfig which MESSES EVERYTHING UP!!
2007-03-16T12:40:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	I find that the open-source "radeon" driver works very well
2007-03-16T12:41:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	it should come with X
2007-03-16T12:42:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	should be.. just edit your xorg.conf accordingly to use "radeon"
2007-03-16T12:42:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	sure
2007-03-16T12:44:00.000Z	Andeh	dager	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10656/
2007-03-16T12:44:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	allright, gimme a few minutes to look at it
2007-03-16T12:44:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	are you on edgy or dapper?
2007-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati
2007-03-16T12:48:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	while im looking at this, do you want just the drivers, or setup to run beryl/compiz as well?
2007-03-16T12:51:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10659/
2007-03-16T12:51:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	that's setup to use Beryl as well
2007-03-16T12:52:00.000Z	dager	Andeh	just be sure to install the "xserver-xorg-video-ati" package beforehand
