2012-07-17T20:02:00.000Z	te	bengalikid	was on the phone.  But, what you have there, probably has on configuration menu and youre prolly stuck with what ever you can do with xrandr
2012-07-17T20:03:00.000Z	te		... which is a bit limited.
2012-07-17T20:04:00.000Z	bengalikid	te	sorry for being a noob but whats xrandr and is there any way to update my drivers to the latest ones? I just started using linux and used to be a windows users
2012-07-17T20:04:00.000Z	te	bengalikid	But I'm only speculating.  You'll have to fish around and see.
2012-07-17T20:05:00.000Z	te	bengalikid	Open a terminal, type:  man xrandr   hit enter, space bar to scroll down, page up or up arrow to go up.
2012-07-17T20:06:00.000Z	te	bengalikid	or just PageUp and PageDown
