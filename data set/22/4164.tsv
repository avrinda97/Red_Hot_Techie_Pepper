2008-12-09T22:34:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	you could try using xubuntu if your are looking for lightweight... or alternatively fluxbuntu which is even lighter
2009-03-18T18:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	best way
2009-03-18T18:15:00.000Z	archman	Paddy_EIRE	sure! ;)
2009-03-18T18:16:00.000Z	archman	Paddy_EIRE	do you know is the linux-headers safe to remove also?
2009-03-18T18:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	yes they are
2009-03-18T18:22:00.000Z	archman	Paddy_EIRE	oh, here's the one with -generic in filename, and one without. That one without is 45mb. So which? Both?
2009-03-18T18:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	I typically do a "sudo apt-get autoremove"
2009-03-18T18:24:00.000Z	archman	Paddy_EIRE	me too, but it didn't list those "older" headers...
2009-03-18T18:25:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	perhaps you should restart to the new kernel
2009-03-18T18:26:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	in synaptic does it list old or obsolete packages under the status
2009-03-18T18:26:00.000Z	archman	Paddy_EIRE	no, strange again...
2009-03-18T18:27:00.000Z	archman	Paddy_EIRE	you mean they are maybe being used?
2009-03-18T18:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	very odd.. perhaps you still have packages using them... or that reference them in some way.. this is if you manually installed something
2009-03-18T18:28:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	check for locally installed packages if there are any in synaptic
2009-03-18T18:29:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	if you could remove them possibly then clean the old headers.. then reinstall anything you locally installed yourself
2009-03-18T18:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	otherwise I guess you could live with them for now :)
2009-03-18T18:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	oh you mean from ppa
2009-03-18T18:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	like say you installed something from source or downloaded a .deb and installed that way
2009-03-18T18:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	:)
2009-03-18T18:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	no they will work
2009-03-18T18:34:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	archman	Hey I am going to pop out for a smoke and a cup of tea.. be back in a few mins :)
2009-03-18T18:35:00.000Z	archman	Paddy_EIRE	np :) Thanks for the help
