2007-11-21T04:03:00.000Z	Mister		Hey guys
2007-11-21T04:04:00.000Z	Mister		I'm assuming that this is a good place for assistance?
2007-11-21T04:05:00.000Z	Mister		?
2007-11-21T04:07:00.000Z	Mister		Here's my question.
2007-11-21T04:07:00.000Z	Mister		What happens when you try to use the terminal to install something, say WINE for instance, but it doesn't work.
2007-11-21T04:07:00.000Z	Mister		And then, you can't install anything else because your package manager is now messed up.
2007-11-21T04:08:00.000Z	Mister		I can give the error message if you want, also.
2007-11-21T04:08:00.000Z	Mister		What should I do to fix it?
2007-11-21T04:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	put up the complete error message
2007-11-21T04:10:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	erm, 'put up' meant on a pastebin, my bad.
2007-11-21T04:10:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	you need to delete the file winehq.list , it didn't get created right. sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list , then redo the instructions from winehq
2007-11-21T04:11:00.000Z	Mister	nickrud	you'll have to forgive my ignorance, but I havn't been using Linux for that long. What is a pastebin? ...eheh....
2007-11-21T04:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	like I said, my bad for not saying pastebin :)
2007-11-21T04:16:00.000Z	Mister	nickrud	it says that the directory doesn't exist....should I try to find it elsewhere?
2007-11-21T04:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	make sure you typed it correctly; also, you could try cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ , and ls should show the winehq.list ; sudo rm winehq.list
2007-11-21T04:18:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	heh, beats working right now :)
2007-11-21T04:18:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	yes, for my personal stuff I use the file manager, but the terminal exclusively for system stuff
2007-11-21T04:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	that stuff under /etc/apt is what controls where you get your software from, worth studying for a bit
2007-11-21T04:24:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	um, a sec
2007-11-21T04:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	system->help adding & removing software
2007-11-21T04:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Mister	another page, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories ; and search the web for the debian administrator handbook
2007-11-21T04:54:00.000Z	Mister	nickrud	update! I installed wine without a problem this time. :) Thanks for the help!
