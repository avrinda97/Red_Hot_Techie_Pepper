2007-08-28T13:44:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	are you able to boot into Ubuntu, but not Windows ?
2007-08-28T13:44:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	then you should be fine :)
2007-08-28T13:44:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	did you use the windows partition, to create the ubuntu partition?
2007-08-28T13:45:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	u should probably reply to my question first
2007-08-28T13:46:00.000Z	johnyflench	neverblue	I'm not sure what you mean but I have a hard drive 60gig and when I was installing Ubuntu it gave me an option to wipe out the whole drive and install ubuntu, to set aside certain percentage of a drive for Ubuntu or to manually install partitions (if I can rmember correctly)
2007-08-28T13:47:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	well, you can seperate a HD into partitions
2007-08-28T13:47:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	and those parititons can be set to the entire drive, or of various sizes
2007-08-28T13:48:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	am I wasting my time replying to your questions ?
2007-08-28T13:50:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	if you used the entire partition (an example) for windows, then you manually formatted the drive for Ubuntu, you would lost the Windows data, as your changing the partition tables on the drive
2007-08-28T13:51:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	so how was your partitions setup before you installed Ubuntu ?
2007-08-28T13:52:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	did you have your entire drive with windows, on one partition ?
2007-08-28T13:53:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	then you have lost your windows install
2007-08-28T13:53:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	as you formatted your drive when you installed Ubuntu
2007-08-28T13:53:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	so you would have to reinstall windows, then reinstall Ubuntu to have a dual boot system, which is what looks like you want
2007-08-28T13:54:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	you cannot just 'pick' out a partition, you would have to use Partition Magic to not lose any data
2007-08-28T13:54:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	so you have lost all your windows data
2007-08-28T13:55:00.000Z	johnyflench	neverblue	so why does my hard drive in ubuntu shows 15gigs when my hard drive is 60 gigs
2007-08-28T13:55:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	you partitioned space for Ubuntu
2007-08-28T13:56:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	but in doing so, you lose all your data
2007-08-28T14:00:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	no, because you partitioned the space
2007-08-28T14:00:00.000Z	neverblue	johnyflench	you should do a bit of research into partitioning
2007-08-28T14:03:00.000Z	johnyflench	neverblue	so you are saying that I lost everything I had on Win XP forever?
