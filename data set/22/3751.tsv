2008-06-07T00:38:00.000Z	CBro2007		Guys if I can access a Samba folder in Konquerer smb://Cbro@is00787/C$ ... how do I see this from the terminal?
2008-06-07T00:38:00.000Z	CBro2007		I made a shared folder in Windows and I see that being mounted automatically in Ubuntu
2008-06-07T00:39:00.000Z	CBro2007		Can someone tell me how to access a Samba Folder in the terminal?
2008-06-07T00:39:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	smbclient
2008-06-07T00:39:00.000Z	CBro2007	cybermage	whats that?
2008-06-07T00:40:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	command line client for samba
2008-06-07T00:40:00.000Z	CBro2007	cybermage	What I have done is that I have installed AndLINUX on my XP box which has Ubuntu
2008-06-07T00:41:00.000Z	CBro2007	cybermage	Now I created a shared folder in Windows.. whcih I am able to acces from both shell and Knoquerer
2008-06-07T00:41:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	and what is the issue then?
2008-06-07T00:41:00.000Z	CBro2007	cybermage	But Konquerer also managed to get into my C: on the XP which is what I want from the terminal to be able to run GREPS
2008-06-07T00:42:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	you have to mount it then
2008-06-07T00:42:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	mount -t smbfs ....
2008-06-07T00:42:00.000Z	CBro2007	cybermage	So I am thinking that if Konquerer can get to it then so can the terminal yeah?
2008-06-07T00:42:00.000Z	CBro2007		and then the shared name?
2008-06-07T00:42:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	mount it as smbfs so you can run linux commands there
2008-06-07T00:42:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	check google and man for syntax
2008-06-07T00:43:00.000Z	cybermage		guys, has anyone played nwn on Hardy ?
2008-06-07T00:43:00.000Z	CBro2007		Ok and if I wanted it to automatically mount everytime I start AndLINUX do I add it to /etc/fstab>?
2008-06-07T00:43:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	autofs might be better
2008-06-07T00:44:00.000Z	CBro2007		ok cool let me fiddle with that then
2008-06-07T00:44:00.000Z	CBro2007		thanks cybermage
2008-06-07T00:44:00.000Z	cybermage	CBro2007	you are welcome
