2009-09-15T21:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari		what do you mean you're always in the sudo file? you mean you log in as root?
2009-09-15T21:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari		loder: what are you up to?
2009-09-15T21:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari		loder: why don't you just boot from the cd and install it that way?
2009-09-15T21:55:00.000Z	mgmuscari		loder: what was the error. i don't think you told us before
2009-09-15T21:56:00.000Z	mgmuscari		loder: we can't help if you don't tell us what the problem was
2009-09-15T21:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari		loder: pastebin the file
2009-09-15T21:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari		never realized that would work in pidgin...
2009-09-15T21:58:00.000Z	Loder3331	mgmuscari	I'll have to go save the file first
2009-09-15T21:59:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	have you tried booting from the cd (not into ubuntu or windows) and installing from there?
2009-09-15T21:59:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	there is a limit on the number of primary partitions you can have on a disk
2009-09-15T22:00:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	furthermore, if you're trying to let it autoconfigure grub, it'll try to make a primary partition for the boot stuff, afaik. try to point it to your existing /boot
2009-09-15T22:02:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	no, but you know, i find that it's always nice to have a clean partition table
2009-09-15T22:03:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	have you tried making logical volumes?
2009-09-15T22:03:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	you wouldn't hit that primary partition limit with logical volumes
2009-09-15T22:06:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	do you mean you're chain loading grub through the vista bootloader?
2009-09-15T22:08:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	do you see grub when you boot your computer?
2009-09-15T22:08:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	so grub is the linux bootloader, and it's located in /boot
2009-09-15T22:10:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	the windows one would say "Windows Boot Manager" at the top
2009-09-15T22:10:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	properly configured, grub will display something like 'Ubuntu' 'Fedora' and 'Windows Vista'
2009-09-15T22:11:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	yes but that would eradicate your linux installations
2009-09-15T22:12:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	sudo apt-get install gparted if you don't have it
2009-09-15T22:15:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Loder3331	no problem. try the man pages for help on the appropriate flag to look for extended/primary. run man gparted
