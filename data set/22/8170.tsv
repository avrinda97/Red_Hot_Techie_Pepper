2006-02-28T10:33:00.000Z	epp		hey i only have a 366mhz processor. What can i do to speed up linux?
2006-02-28T10:33:00.000Z	amphi	epp	use a lightweight window manager (or just use console)
2006-02-28T10:52:00.000Z	amphi	epp	you are on an ibook?
2006-02-28T10:53:00.000Z	amphi	epp	I installed debian on one of them, with X and openbox, and it ran well - I like the kernel hack for using the 'sleep' light as an hd access indicator
2006-02-28T10:54:00.000Z	epp	amphi	my hd is so loud i dont need a light, lol.
2006-02-28T10:54:00.000Z	amphi	epp	heh

2006-02-28T11:06:00.000Z	amphi	epp	the *boxes are nice, I use openbox here
2006-02-28T11:06:00.000Z	epp	amphi	is is really quick?
2006-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	epp	amphi	openbox is really plain.
2006-02-28T11:23:00.000Z	amphi	epp	yes
2006-02-28T11:23:00.000Z	epp	amphi	kinda hard to use.
2006-02-28T11:24:00.000Z	amphi	epp	not at all - it's easy to configure with keybindings for everything
2006-02-28T11:33:00.000Z	amphi	epp	no hideous icons disfiguring the noble austerity of your root window
2006-02-28T11:34:00.000Z	amphi	epp	wavemon
2006-02-28T11:37:00.000Z	amphi	epp	or run gkrellm in the slit - that has a wifi plugin
2006-02-28T11:58:00.000Z	amphi	epp	iwlist <iface> scan
2006-02-28T11:58:00.000Z	epp	amphi	like a gui.
2006-02-28T11:58:00.000Z	amphi	epp	no idea
2006-02-28T12:00:00.000Z	amphi	epp	iwlist does that *shrug*
