2005-10-03T14:31:00.000Z	ccooke-work		Right, that *does* it.
2005-10-03T14:32:00.000Z	ccooke-work		What is the *canonical* *default* *whatever* method of setting up networking in Ubuntu?
2005-10-03T14:32:00.000Z	ccooke-work		and whose head do I have to break about it?
2005-10-03T14:34:00.000Z	ccooke-work		Anyone? Anyone I could talk to about it before I write my own system *again*?
2005-10-03T14:35:00.000Z	bob2	ccooke-work	wtf
2005-10-03T14:35:00.000Z	bob2	ccooke-work	/etc/network/interfaces
2005-10-03T14:36:00.000Z	ccooke-work	bob2	No. That is not an acceptable solution. I can do some clever things with it, sure, but it does not deal with being on different networks at all well.
2005-10-03T14:36:00.000Z	bob2		whingewhingewhinge
2005-10-03T14:36:00.000Z	bob2	ccooke-work	loop at laptop-net or network-manager then
2005-10-03T14:36:00.000Z	ccooke-work		I've been trying to get along with the network settinfs in the Ubuntu menus, but they're pretty much unusable for a laptop.
2005-10-03T14:36:00.000Z	bob2		and stop having such a terrible attitude
2005-10-03T14:37:00.000Z	ccooke-work	bob2	terrible? No. Irritated, yes.
2005-10-03T14:37:00.000Z	bob2	ccooke-work	well, whatever
2005-10-03T14:38:00.000Z	bob2	ccooke-work	whinging won't help; improving laptop-net or network-manager to do what you want, would.
2005-10-03T14:38:00.000Z	ccooke-work	bob2	isn't there a solution in main I could help with?
2005-10-03T14:39:00.000Z	bob2	ccooke-work	network-manager will go into main when it's less buggy
2005-10-03T14:39:00.000Z	bob2		it was hoped that would be pre-breezy, but it was not to be
2005-10-03T14:39:00.000Z	ccooke-work	bob2	ahhhh. So that was the answer to my question.
2005-10-03T14:39:00.000Z	ccooke-work	bob2	*great*
2005-10-03T14:39:00.000Z	ccooke-work		I'll go look at it right away
2005-10-03T14:40:00.000Z	ccooke-work		I wonder if it does things the way I do :-)
2005-10-03T14:42:00.000Z	ccooke-work	bob2	... Hmm. Impressive. Thank you so much.
