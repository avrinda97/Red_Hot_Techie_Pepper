2010-11-17T09:48:00.000Z	misteralexander		what command do I use to find out what DRIVERS I already have installed and/or need for otherwise non-functioning devices?
2010-11-17T09:49:00.000Z	llolcats	misteralexander	use lsmod to see what modules are loaded
2010-11-17T09:49:00.000Z	misteralexander	llolcats	ah ha.  And I'd do "lsmod | grep "DEVICE" for the device I'm trying to troubleshoot, like "Keyboard" or "Touchpad" . . . yes?
2010-11-17T09:49:00.000Z	llolcats		mmm
2010-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	llolcats		well its not that clear
2010-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	llolcats		coz the usally have wierd name
2010-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	llolcats		like usb_hid or somthing
2010-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	llolcats		i think there is a list of the module.o files in lib
2010-11-17T09:51:00.000Z	misteralexander	llolcats	how do I specifically troubleshoot a laptop keyboard and touchpad under 10.10 that are non-functioning?
2010-11-17T09:51:00.000Z	llolcats		whtch is a list of all thye avilible drivers
2010-11-17T09:51:00.000Z	llolcats		or rather kernal modules
2010-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	llolcats		well that problem is more likly todo with your xorg conf
2010-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	llolcats		cd /etc/; find | grep  -i xorg
2010-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	misteralexander		I was under the impression that 10.10 doesn't have a static xorg.conf anymore . . . it's all been moved out of reach of an "Average User".
2010-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	llolcats		really?
2010-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	llolcats		nfi
2010-11-17T09:53:00.000Z	llolcats		well that command i put should find it if its still in /etc/ somwhere
2010-11-17T09:53:00.000Z	misteralexander		yeah, it's gone from 10.04 too.
2010-11-17T09:53:00.000Z	misteralexander		you CAN have one, and the system will default to it, but by system intsall default . . . it's gone.
2010-11-17T09:55:00.000Z	llolcats	misteralexander	you will probably need one that is slighly customised to your laptop
2010-11-17T09:55:00.000Z	misteralexander	llolcats	okay . . . urgh . . . I was trying to avoid that.  Thanks!
2010-11-17T09:55:00.000Z	llolcats	misteralexander	i would reccomend searching google for one
