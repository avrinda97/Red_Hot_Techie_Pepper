2010-08-20T04:14:00.000Z	dogmatic69		im kinda new to linux, got ubuntu10 going but cant seem to edit any files
2010-08-20T04:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	what are you trying to edit?
2010-08-20T04:15:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	i installed php5 and want to fiddle the php.ini, the one i found i cant edit, and then i tried to edit the default .html in /var/www and cant either
2010-08-20T04:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	when editing "system" files you need to use "sudo" or "gksu" to get elevated (root) privildges
2010-08-20T04:16:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	i did sudo edit php.ini
2010-08-20T04:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	for example "gksu gedit /path/to/php.ini"
2010-08-20T04:18:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	thanks, that does the trick
2010-08-20T04:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	:)
2010-08-20T04:19:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	why would sudo edit php.ini not work btw?
2010-08-20T19:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	typically your guest OS doesn't need to know what the host OS is using for internet (in your case wireless).  Networking is usually handled "virtually"
2010-08-20T19:23:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	its a old laptop and i could not get wifi working on 9.04, im now on 10.04 and want to get rid of windows
2010-08-20T19:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	if you use a "real" install you'll have to deal with wireless - but in a VM you don't
2010-08-20T19:24:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	how you mean?
2010-08-20T19:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	you VM won't see your wireless card
2010-08-20T19:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	use a livecd
2010-08-20T19:25:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	good idea... did not thik of that
2010-08-20T19:25:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	can i just burn the dl onto cd? or is there something special to do with the dl for live cd?
2010-08-20T19:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	just burn the ISO to disk and boot from it :)
2010-08-20T19:27:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	thanks
2010-08-21T20:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dogmatic69	by "shell" do you mean terminal?  Are you using gnome-terminal?  If so, Edit menu then Profile Preferences to add transparency etc.
2010-08-21T20:02:00.000Z	dogmatic69	ZykoticK9	that is exactly what i mean :P
