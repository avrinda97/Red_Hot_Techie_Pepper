2007-11-27T14:17:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	kiba dock doesnt have a file browser mod like awn, it does nt have drag n drop support like awn.
2007-11-27T14:18:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	if your after a dockbar mac clone yes
2007-11-27T14:18:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	they are both similiar cept kibdock is more eyecanddy than function
2007-11-27T14:18:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	and i found kibadock unrealiable it would suddenly quit on me
2007-11-27T14:19:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	and if the whole point of running that kind of menu system is to provide 'quicker' acces to info and apps...then stick with gnome menu panel
2007-11-27T14:20:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	its by far the most stable and memory friendly
2007-11-27T14:21:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	or help out with teh dev and get a monster machine and put up with crashes
2007-11-27T14:22:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	im really just being pessimistic....it can be bad but if you reeeeally want it...go for it.. try awn and kiba
2007-11-27T14:22:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	you need to install the extras package
2007-11-27T14:23:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	do you have beryl? are you running gutsy or fiesty or kek even breezy?
2007-11-27T14:23:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	hangon

2007-11-27T14:39:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	i used ghost religously on windows
2007-11-27T14:45:00.000Z	airtoni1	Assassyn	i do that isntall time...for me the typical format is this : 1st: swap(1g), 2nd main(10gb), 3rd user files(rest of storage space)
