2011-10-07T04:04:00.000Z	prothon		I have a question for you all. Is there a way to install ubuntu 11.04 on an Western Digital EARS drive and keep the correct sector alignment?
2011-10-07T04:05:00.000Z	prothon		I realigned the sectors in fdisk (i think it was correctly aligned) but now i go to install and i'm worried that the alignment will well... dealign
2011-10-07T04:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	Ubuntu's installer uses optimal allignment.
2011-10-07T04:07:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Ah. I tried the alternate install first and it kind just pooped everywhere.
2011-10-07T04:07:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Thank you.
2011-10-07T04:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	"pooped everywhere"?
2011-10-07T04:08:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Any file copying was just abysmal and I kept getting warnings they're not aligned by... well alot.
2011-10-07T04:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	The alternate installer uses optimal allignment as well. On modern drives aligning to the "cylinder" is far from optimal as cylinders from CHS values are basically a fiction.
2011-10-07T04:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	Where were you seeing errors about alignment?
2011-10-07T04:10:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Besides noticeable speed decrease (these are 2TB drives) I saw the errors in disk utility
2011-10-07T04:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	What error specifically? Did you use automatic partitioning with the alternate installer?
2011-10-07T04:10:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Manual config of the partitions. I think that's what made it poop
2011-10-07T04:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	So you're now aligning to MiB boundaries?
2011-10-07T04:13:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Honestly, very little
2011-10-07T04:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	Verry little what?
2011-10-07T04:14:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	MiB boundaries.
2011-10-07T04:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	You can't be "very little" aligned on MiB boundaries. Your partitions are either aligned on MiB boundaries or not. Which is it?
2011-10-07T04:16:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	I mean i know little of it. I'm RTFMing but I understand that you need to use 4096 ^ x for partitions
2011-10-07T04:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	I'm betting that the installer aligned the partitions perfectly well and you are simply misunderstanding an error message you've seen. That's why I'd like to know what the exact error message was.
2011-10-07T04:18:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Oh, after trying X and Y I've wiped that partition out many times over. I think I just manually partitioned the drives to the wrong boundaries. I've come to realize that.
2011-10-07T04:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prothon	I don't think that either Ubiquity (the live installer) or Debian Installer (the "alternate" installer) easily allows you to create unaligned partitions.
2011-10-07T04:22:00.000Z	prothon	Jordan_U	Stroke of unluck? Maybe I'm tard. Maybe a bit of column A and B
