2011-09-15T12:45:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	why was i able to run it by double clicking in 64 bit Ubuntu, but can not in 32bit?
2011-09-15T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	what is the format of the package
2011-09-15T12:44:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	.sh package
2011-09-15T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	you'll need to run that from a shell
2011-09-15T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	no idea, but it's a "shell" script
2011-09-15T12:47:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	terminal yeild "Panic Initial setup failed. Cannot Continue"
2011-09-15T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	so there is a problem running that script on your machine, you need to debug it
2011-09-15T12:48:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	ok.. walk me thru that.
2011-09-15T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	I can't it's quite complex, you need to work out what part of the script is failing and why -
2011-09-15T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	run run "file $scriptname" replacing "$scriptname" with the name of the script
2011-09-15T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	tell me what it comes back with eg: "file install.sh"
2011-09-15T12:51:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	HoNClient-2.1.8.1.sh: POSIX shell script text executable
2011-09-15T12:59:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	any other thoughts
2011-09-15T13:02:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	sorry, I was just away for a minute
2011-09-15T13:02:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	not a prob
2011-09-15T13:02:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	so that confirms it is a shell script, so you need to walk through that shell script and find out what's causing it to fail
2011-09-15T13:04:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	im not sure i understand why i was able to install Hon and the updated Display drivers within 11.04 x64 yet 11.04 x86 is giving me fits.
2011-09-15T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	there is something about your current system that the shell script doesn't like/expects different, you need to talk the shell script though and work out what's failing
2011-09-15T13:07:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	wow.. that sounds like a bit of work
2011-09-15T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	exactly, hence why I said it's quite long winded to walk you through it
2011-09-15T13:10:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	ikonia	is it possible that something from my install cd or during install didnt copy correctly, or that the cd isnt properly burnt?
2011-09-15T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	VampsDaBeast	no idea without working out why that script is failing
