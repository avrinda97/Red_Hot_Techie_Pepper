2006-11-17T11:52:00.000Z	keithhhhh		hi Is Compiz an addon to XGL or is it another management system?
2006-11-17T11:52:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	compiz is a window manager
2006-11-17T11:53:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	you would be better iwth beryl and beryl-manager
2006-11-17T11:53:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	beryl/compiz run ontop of xgl or aiglx
2006-11-17T11:53:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	ah
2006-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	so then what is the minimum requirements for AIGLX do you know?
2006-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	I cant run XGL unfortunately
2006-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	think of xgl/aiglx and compiz/beryl being analogous to xorg-x11 and fluxbox/windowmaker/metacity
2006-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	I have an ATI 9000
2006-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	any relativly decent integrated graphics card
2006-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	excellent, that will work very well
2006-11-17T11:54:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	i run aiglx with a radeon 7000 igp
2006-11-17T11:55:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	and it is very smooth
2006-11-17T11:55:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	ok now just need to find aiglx documentation.... was it easy to install?
2006-11-17T11:55:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	aiglx is better than xgl
2006-11-17T11:55:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	cool thanks  ;)
2006-11-17T11:55:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	yes very, are you using edgy?
2006-11-17T11:55:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	no :( 6.06
2006-11-17T11:56:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	ok, you should have to upgrade to edgy iirc but then aiglx is installed and ready to go by default (its part of xorg-x11 in edgy) all you need to do is install beryl and beryl-manager
2006-11-17T11:57:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	hmmm
2006-11-17T11:57:00.000Z	keithhhhh	variant	thanks alot Ill get back to you if things work out  hehe
2006-11-17T11:58:00.000Z	variant	keithhhhh	np, gl
