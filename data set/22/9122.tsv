2005-02-27T14:59:00.000Z	Octane		should i trust ubuntu's automatic disk paritioner
2005-02-27T14:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	depends what you are trying to do
2005-02-27T15:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	you can choose manual/assisted partitioning if you have a multi-partition system
2005-02-27T15:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	you don't need separate /boot
2005-02-27T15:01:00.000Z	Octane	thoreauputic	but i eventually want to dual boot with xp
2005-02-27T15:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	I have a triple boot with XP, Debian and Ubuntu without a separate /boot partition: you don't need one
2005-02-27T15:02:00.000Z	Octane	thoreauputic	okay nice, so ill just have one ext3 and one swap
2005-02-27T15:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	you just let grub install on MBR and act as the boot loader for all OS you have on the machine
2005-02-27T15:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	if I were you I'd install wintendo first though
2005-02-27T15:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	otherwise things get complicated fast
2005-06-30T07:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	apt-cache policy <packagename> should tell you
2005-06-30T07:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	no worries :)
2005-07-30T08:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	if you want the contents, file roller can open it
2005-07-30T08:27:00.000Z	Octane	thoreauputic	thank you man
2005-07-30T08:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	no worries :)
2005-08-04T09:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	if you use aptitude instead for your upgrades, you can do " aptitude hold <packagename> " then do " sudo aptitude upgrade"
2005-08-04T09:01:00.000Z	Octane	thoreauputic	i know with yum you can define packages to hold, isnt there a way to do that in an apt-get conf file?
2005-08-04T09:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	there are ways - I don't personally remember them but you can find the info in the apt-howto ( apt-get install apt-howto-en )
2005-08-04T09:03:00.000Z	Octane	thoreauputic	thanks so much
2005-08-04T09:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	the apt-howto is a great resource BTW
2005-08-04T09:03:00.000Z	Octane	thoreauputic	 i didnt even know it exists
2005-08-04T09:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Octane	it's on line as well - linked from debian.org IIRC
