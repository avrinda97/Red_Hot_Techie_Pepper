2006-08-31T16:24:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake		I'm trying to get my friend's wlan card working and I'm kinda stuck. I've got card manager recognising the pcmcia card, and the ath_pci module loading, lspci shows it as an Atheros 802.11 device. The problem step is that I don't get a /dev/wlan0 file created. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
2006-08-31T16:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	iwconfig shows the device? (net devices are not created in /dev/)
2006-08-31T16:26:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	it just says that lo and sit0 don't have any wlan extensions
2006-08-31T16:26:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	doesn't mention any other devices
2006-08-31T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	and you are sure the atheros driver is loaded?
2006-08-31T16:29:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	it shows up in lsmod and /var/log/messages
2006-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	i do not know what can be wrong if the driver loads without errors the device should be listed in iwconfig -a or ifconfig -a
2006-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	yeah, that was my thinking :(
2006-08-31T16:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	sorry for not being of much help :(
2010-05-04T15:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade ?
2010-05-04T15:22:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	I tried that first ;)
2010-05-04T15:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	maybe there are still packages to dwonload
2010-05-04T15:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	sometimes it takes a few runs of dpkg --configure -a to fix an interruted upgrade
2010-05-04T15:23:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	I don't think that's the problem, it's quite happy to download new packages, but can't configure them because of dependencies on unconfigured packages
2010-05-04T15:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	that's why i said you have to run dpkg --configure -a a few times in a row.
2010-05-04T15:24:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	every time I run dpkg --configure -a I get the same error, lots of dependency warnings but starting with "dpkg: error processing debianutils (--configure):
2010-05-04T15:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	so dependencies are being sattisfied
2010-05-04T15:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	sudo aptitude reinstall debianutils
2010-05-04T15:25:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	so I try aptitude reinstall debianutils which wants to download some stuff, but comes back with the error message I started with
2010-05-04T15:25:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	I can follow instructions, the error message just leaves me completely flummoxed and google doesn't seem to help with the "due to missing arch" bit of it...
2010-05-04T15:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	SammyTheSnake	i'm out of ideas; sorry
2010-05-04T15:29:00.000Z	SammyTheSnake	erUSUL	that makes two of us, then :(
