2007-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	pureStylezz		what is it?
2007-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	pureStylezz		o.O
2007-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	how old is your computer??? it just may not be able to handle it
2007-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	don't slit your wrists, that would be bad
2007-04-08T05:46:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	hhhmmm, Ok, should be able to handle it... umm, are you able to get a terminal when you hit CTRL ALT F1??
2007-04-08T05:47:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	OK, that means it didn't freeze... so your problem is probably that the mouse and keyboard aren't connected or detected
2007-04-08T05:48:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	ooops, sorry, wrong conversation...with the mouse thing... I meant to type that into a PM...
2007-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	when you run ps -e int the terminal.. I assume that Gnome is on the list?
2007-04-08T05:51:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	yeah... I think IndyGunFreak is right... It's a problem with X, that probably doesn't have enough drivers or soething
2007-04-08T05:51:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	the alternate CD takes longer to install because it has more drivers in it
2007-04-08T05:52:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	hope that helps,  like IndyGunFreak  said, it's text based but simple, if not, we;re here
2007-04-08T05:53:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	Good luck
2007-04-08T09:57:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	Have you tried other window managers yet? like XFCE which is much smaller and less resource intensive?
2007-04-08T09:59:00.000Z	hendrixski	pureStylezz	gnome failsafe may be worth a try
