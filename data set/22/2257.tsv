2009-08-04T11:20:00.000Z	grep-grail		I'm logged in as root and trying to userdel but it says the user is logged in, even thou who doesn't show them
2009-08-04T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	don't log in as root, you have significantly reduced the securty of your system by enabling the account
2009-08-04T11:23:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	I'm not a moron, I know the risks.
2009-08-04T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	just don't go web browsing. I hope you arent running your irc client as root
2009-08-04T11:24:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	are you going to help me with my problem, or tell me things I already know and didn;t ask for?
2009-08-04T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	i'm websearching whilst telling you of the perils of root, keep your hair on
2009-08-04T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	pkill -KILL -u <user name>
2009-08-04T11:26:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	I already tried that
2009-08-04T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	ps -ef | grep username | grep bash
2009-08-04T11:27:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	tied that too
2009-08-04T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	you don't need root, you can do everything with sudo -i
2009-08-04T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	ps -u <username>   then kill all the users processes
2009-08-04T11:28:00.000Z	grep-grail		you need root when you can't log into your regular user account
2009-08-04T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	then you boot to a root recovery console and reset the password
2009-08-04T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	you dont need to have the account universally enabled
2009-08-04T11:29:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	the password's fine.  all of my config files are messed up
2009-08-04T11:29:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	I want to delete everything and make a fresh account
2009-08-04T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	you can make one there too, again, no need for root to be enaled
2009-08-04T11:31:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	There are no processes owned by that user
2009-08-04T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	then its not logged in, logically
2009-08-04T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grep-grail	i'd drop to root recovery console, reset the password and also re-disable the root account
2009-08-04T11:34:00.000Z	grep-grail	ActionParsnip	I know.  Tell that to userdel
