2006-06-02T12:23:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	Change the default entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst, it is set to entry 0 by default (I think)
2006-06-02T12:24:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	Whichever number entry Windows is (if it is the first entry, use 0, the second is 1, the third is 2, etc)
2006-06-02T12:25:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	Oh you want Ubuntu default? Set it to Ubuntu's entry (usually 0)
2006-06-02T12:30:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	For windows and Ubuntu?
2006-06-02T12:31:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	Ubuntu should have at least 2 partitions, 1 for files and one for "swap" (swap is not actually NEEDED but it is very very useful)
2006-06-02T12:32:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	You may want to put /home on it's own partition as well (you are not limited to one partition like windows, which I think is bad practice)
2006-06-02T12:33:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	You should leave free space next to windows, and Ubuntu will sort out your partitions
2006-06-02T12:35:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	You should basically have: partition 1 Windows (ntfs), empty space (no partitions) and then tell Ubuntu installer to use existing free space and it will make what it needs to
2006-06-02T15:12:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	?
2006-06-02T15:13:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	OK, your hard drives are called hda for the middle drive on the first cable, hdb for the end drive on the first cable, hdc for middle second cable and hdd for end drive on second cable. The numbers are the partition numbers (starting at 1)
2006-06-02T15:15:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	Tell it to use existing free space. There is no harm in selecting LVM, but you don't need to really
2006-06-02T15:16:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	If you have already shrunk your partition with Partition Magic or something then no
2006-06-02T15:17:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	Can you tell me every option? I forget what they are exactly...
2006-06-02T15:18:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	I think there are erase disk ones, don't use them, resize, don't use that, manual, don't use that, and automatic in the free space normal, or with LVM. Choose one of those (the free space ones, either will do)
2006-06-02T15:20:00.000Z	Warbo	CBW-tat	Have another look.
