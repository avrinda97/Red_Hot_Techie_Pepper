2008-01-06T00:25:00.000Z	Palthron		Hello, anybody familiar with GtkFileSplitter? I'm splitting a 4GB file and it's been running for 3 hours. Is this normal? (512MB memory)
2008-01-06T00:26:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Single HDD?
2008-01-06T00:27:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	I'm not familiar with Ubuntu at all, but it sound exaggerated either way. I suppose splitting from and to the same drive if you don't have DMA enabled for the HDD can take quite a while, but not 3 hours.
2008-01-06T00:28:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Does the HDD crunch a lot? Is there a progress indicator?
2008-01-06T00:28:00.000Z	Palthron	ZiNC2^6	: OK I will research about DMA. I think this is true since my CPU load is kept under 50% the whole time (Not CPU load related). Thanks!
2008-01-06T00:29:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Maybe that software is just buggy for >4GB files.
2008-01-06T00:30:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	If it's just splitting, anything will do I suppose.
2008-01-06T00:32:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	For simple splitting, you could join it on Windows (or otherwise) even without any tools at all.
2008-01-06T00:33:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Just copy /b 1+2+3+4 out
2008-01-06T00:33:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Yes. Linux should have something similar.
2008-01-06T00:35:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Yeah. See how long 100MB takes. Is that file actually >4GB?
2008-01-06T00:36:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	What, copy /b?
2008-01-06T00:37:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Oh, that was the simple part. The question is what's up with the speed. (Or >4GB problem.)
2008-01-06T00:42:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	sudo hdparm /dev/hdc
2008-01-06T00:42:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	To see if it's on.
2008-01-06T00:43:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Well, the general idea. :)
2008-01-06T00:45:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	What's the exact filesize?
2008-01-06T00:46:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	So my current idea would be that software having trouble with >4GB files.
2008-01-06T00:48:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Try RAR.
2008-01-06T00:48:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Never used it on Linux, but there's a binary for it, apparently. And you can set compression to "Store", then just use it as a splitter.
2008-01-06T00:48:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Yes.
2008-01-06T00:49:00.000Z	ZiNC2^6	Palthron	Hmm... maybe p7zip then.
