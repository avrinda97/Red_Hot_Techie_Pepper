2007-07-29T13:05:00.000Z	rechercher	Tasyne	type it at console to show info on hardware
2007-07-29T13:05:00.000Z	rechercher	Tasyne	maybe it's lsusb in you case
2007-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	Tasyne	rechercher	did you get that last comment?
2007-07-29T13:12:00.000Z	rechercher	Tasyne	ok, what does iwconfig say?
2007-07-29T13:13:00.000Z	Tasyne	rechercher	It says: lo no wireless extensions. wlan0 no wireless extensions.
2007-07-29T13:15:00.000Z	Tasyne	rechercher	and which module would that be?..
2007-07-29T13:15:00.000Z	rechercher	Tasyne	not sure, look through the output of lsmod to see if it is loaded
2007-07-29T13:16:00.000Z	Tasyne	rechercher	no, I said I tried to install it, but it wouldn't make.

2007-07-29T13:22:00.000Z	rechercher	Tasyne	you could download the .deb packages for linux-wlan-ng from a repository on another computer and move them over and install
2007-07-29T13:22:00.000Z	Tasyne	rechercher	How do I access a repository from Windows XP then?
2007-07-29T13:22:00.000Z	rechercher	Tasyne	and if you do, make sure you have any and all dependancies required for it
2007-07-29T13:23:00.000Z	rechercher	Tasyne	just goto its website in firefox
2007-07-29T13:29:00.000Z	Tasyne	rechercher	ookay, I'm having trouble finding a URL for a repository...
