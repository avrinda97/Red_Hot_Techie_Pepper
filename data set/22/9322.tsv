2004-12-17T17:36:00.000Z	Ribs		how do I install a .deb package I have downloaded?
2004-12-17T17:36:00.000Z	Ribs		thanks
2004-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	Ribs		dpkg: error processing point2play_1.3.2_i386.deb (--install):
2004-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	Ribs		 package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64)
2004-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	Ribs		bah
2004-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	Ribs		can I override that?
2004-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	Ribs		How do I install this software then?
2004-12-17T17:38:00.000Z	scizzo	Ribs	you need to find the correct arch
2004-12-17T17:38:00.000Z	Ribs		point2play works fine on amd64
2004-12-17T17:38:00.000Z	scizzo	Ribs	its a binary package
2004-12-17T17:38:00.000Z	Ribs		it just happens to only be avaible in i386
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	scizzo	Ribs	compiled to be used on i386 machines
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	Ribs	scizzo	I know.
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	scizzo	Ribs	compile it on your own then
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	Ribs	scizzo	I can't. It's a commerical program.
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	scizzo	Ribs	if there is no amd64 binary package then it is hard to get it working
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	Ribs	scizzo	It worked perfectly in Gentoo and Fedora
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	Ribs		so I don't see why it shouldn't here.
2004-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	Ribs		no, it's a binary package
2004-12-17T17:40:00.000Z	Ribs		The source isn't avalible
2004-12-17T17:40:00.000Z	scizzo	Ribs	gentoo compiles it to follow the arch you have...fedora had a binary package that is compiled against the arch
2004-12-17T17:40:00.000Z	Ribs	scizzo	No
