2007-07-14T09:06:00.000Z	Arrick		I am getting the error ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,INDEX,ALTER ON moodle.* TO *****@' at line 1

2007-07-14T09:08:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	 dumb question but has the moodle database been created?
2007-07-14T09:09:00.000Z	Arrick	Nutubuntu	yeah, just did it
2007-07-14T09:09:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	 weird - the syntax looked fine
2007-07-14T09:13:00.000Z	Arrick	Nutubuntu	I got pissed last night and went to bed, and still cant get it to work (even though i have verified it is installed, operational and the database is created
2007-07-14T09:14:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	 it's been a long while ... but ... create <database>, use <database>, and grant the rights ..
2007-07-14T09:17:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	could there be an issue with the rights on the directory that holds the moodle database? I"m scratching my head
2007-07-14T09:18:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	 root in the OS and root in the db are different entities
2007-07-14T09:19:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	 I'd be inclined to yank it and reinstall. No idea why it wouldn't let you execute a valid GRANT query
2007-07-14T09:22:00.000Z	Arrick	Nutubuntu	I did that just this evening
2007-07-14T09:23:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	... wish I could help better; I'm baffled. It might be that my MySQL knowledge just isn't there, I'm a novice with it
2007-07-14T09:24:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	I had *hideous* problems getting MySQL happy under IIS 6 ... I know how you feel, sort of :)
2007-07-14T09:25:00.000Z	Arrick	Nutubuntu	I never had a problem with it, and i also have all the MSSQL stuff I would need.
2007-07-14T09:26:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	iirc in Win2k3 I needed to grant rights to the MySQL data directory; have you done the equivalent?
2007-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	Arrick	 curl's a php 5 thingie
