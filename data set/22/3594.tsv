2008-08-27T13:24:00.000Z	visik7		is there some application firewall on ubuntu that notifiy me if an app is trying to listen to a port or make a connection
2008-08-27T13:25:00.000Z	visik7		and allow or deny it ?
2008-08-27T13:27:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	  a program called specto will watch ports and notify you
2008-08-27T13:27:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	 its in the repos
2008-08-27T13:28:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	isn't a firewall
2008-08-27T13:29:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	maybe nufw
2008-08-27T13:29:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	 you can use ufw to allow/deny connections on ports, firewall ports, etc...      the program specto is a nifty lil app that will notify you of web page changes and port connections and other things

2008-08-27T13:31:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	I want an annoying message on network activity like kaspersky antivirus
2008-08-27T13:32:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	  again, you can set specto to notify you of ANY connection to any port
2008-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	yes but doesn't allow me to lock specific apps
2008-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	only a notification
2008-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	  are you talking about outgoing connections?
2008-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	yes
2008-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	 like notify you if an ubuntu app makes an outbound connection?
2008-08-27T13:38:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	 off hand, I don't know if ufw can restrict outbound, anything that will notify a user of outbound connections....    you could always use a net monitor to see all active inbound/outbound connections
2008-08-27T13:39:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	 like tcpdump
2008-08-27T13:39:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	yes I know but something more userfriendly I'm installing ubuntu on a friend computer and he can't live without this fake sense of security
2008-08-27T13:40:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	 dunno, tcpdump will certainly show ALL in/out connections and where everything is going, if he doesnt mind watching the terminal
2008-08-27T13:41:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	Is not the solution
2008-08-27T13:41:00.000Z	VipOrX	visik7	 and there are some GUI frontends to tcpdump
2008-08-27T13:41:00.000Z	visik7	VipOrX	yes there is wireshark
