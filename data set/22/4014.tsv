2008-05-09T08:48:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z		I cant login to Ubuntu
2008-05-09T08:48:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	is is the graphical login or terminal login?
2008-05-09T08:48:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	terminal logins do not show the password while you type.
2008-05-09T08:52:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	is this a new install? Has the graphical login ever come up?
2008-05-09T08:53:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	what happens if you sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart from the command line (you will have to enter your password again)
2008-05-09T08:55:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	try "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start" without the quotes
2008-05-09T08:57:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	harriseldon	Sudo: Command Not found.
2008-05-09T08:58:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	it is case sensitive
2008-05-09T08:59:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	harriseldon	/etc/init.d/gdm start  Command not found.
2008-05-09T09:00:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	you may have installed the server version which does not come with a graphical interface.
2008-05-09T09:01:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	you can install ubuntu-desktop, but that will still leave the server packages and server performance settings. If it is a new install, just re-install.
2008-05-09T09:01:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	harriseldon	  how dould i do that?
2008-05-09T09:02:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	you will have to download the correct live cd and reinstall. To install the graphical part from the server type "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" without the quotes
2008-05-09T09:08:00.000Z	Nissan_350Z	harriseldon	can i cancel the download?
2008-05-09T09:08:00.000Z	harriseldon	Nissan_350Z	ctrl-C will cancel the current command
