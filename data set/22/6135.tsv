2006-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	marinosi		how can i recompile the  kernel for ubuntu desktop while there are only the headers????
2006-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	why do you want to recompile it?
2006-12-14T14:03:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	i cannot put the dma support on for one of my disks and i assume there is no support to the kernel
2006-12-14T14:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	what kind of disk is it?
2006-12-14T14:04:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	hard disk drive
2006-12-14T14:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	I meant IDE, SATA, SCSI etc.
2006-12-14T14:04:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	sata
2006-12-14T14:04:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	/dev/sda1
2006-12-14T14:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	dma is only effective on IDE disks, on SATA its not that great (as in, sometimes it doesn't even work).
2006-12-14T14:05:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	but when i download something the laptop is burning...i cannot even fireup an xterm
2006-12-14T14:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	what? what do you mean by that?
2006-12-14T14:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep DMA will tell you what modes your drive supports, if any.
2006-12-14T14:07:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	when i download something and i have i/o operations , using wmii i try to open an xterm and the prompt does about 20 sec to show up
2006-12-14T14:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	how much ram do you have on the system, and what kind of video card?
2006-12-14T14:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	have you installed the nvidia drivers?
2006-12-14T14:08:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	marinosi@lucifer:~$ sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda |grep -i dma
2006-12-14T14:09:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	yeap
2006-12-14T14:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	dma is already on then.
2006-12-14T14:09:00.000Z	marinosi	fyrestrtr	what could be wrong then?
2006-12-14T14:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	I don't know, try /etc/init.d/hdparm restart
2006-12-14T14:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	is your computer under any load?
2006-12-14T14:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marinosi	you are just getting slow disk activity?
