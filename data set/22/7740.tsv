2008-01-07T08:21:00.000Z	twavisdegwet		how would i install it on ubuntu  without an internet connection?
2008-01-07T08:22:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	do you have an ubuntu installation CD, or access to the internet where you can make such a CD?
2008-01-07T08:23:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	is the wireless card inside your computer provided by 2wire (the ISP) ?
2008-01-07T08:24:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	you use a USB wireless network card, is that it?
2008-01-07T08:25:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	ok gotcha, so do you know the model number of the usb wireless card?
2008-01-07T08:25:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	the company that makes it and the model number
2008-01-07T08:28:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	give us what you have
2008-01-07T08:30:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	yes, there is a program called ndiswrapper
2008-01-07T08:31:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2008-01-07T08:31:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	yes, it is. but you will need to have the windows driver files accessible
2008-01-07T08:32:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	those should be downloadabale from 2wire
2008-01-07T08:32:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	ok one second i made a mistake, ndiswrapper is NOT included by default
2008-01-07T08:34:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	yes, a jump drive would work very well. all of the information is included in that document, so include that document on your jump drive. read through it carefully first to make sure you have downloaded all the files you will need before you reboot. And of course, good luck!
2008-01-07T08:34:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	that is the theory
2008-01-07T08:36:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	don't know anything about that, but i don't see why not
2008-01-07T08:41:00.000Z	the_padawan	twavisdegwet	i wish you luck
