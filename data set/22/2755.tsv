2009-07-14T07:33:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	This is obviously tough for you - how are things coming at this point?  Have you tried, as oldude67 suggests, running "dpkg --configure -a"?
2009-07-14T07:34:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	How about dpkg --configure --pending?
2009-07-14T07:35:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	How much free space do you have at this point?
2009-07-14T07:38:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	oldude67: to display free space?  df -h
2009-07-14T07:40:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	What exactly is wrong right now?
2009-07-14T07:41:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	OK let's go to basics here.  Have you run sudo apt-get clean?
2009-07-14T07:43:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	Is there anything you know you can delete just to give yourself some breathing room?
2009-07-14T07:45:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	Sorry I am missing your comments - when the channel gets busy, you might want to put my nick in your comment so it highlights me. :-)  For example, if you have a zip file or a movie or game or something that you know you can replace, let's delete it just to give yourself some room to work
2009-07-14T07:47:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	any progress?
2009-07-14T07:49:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	Just type it
2009-07-14T07:50:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	Great!  What did you do so far to free up space?
2009-07-14T07:51:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	manbreadj	Also, you can try deborphan (sudo apt-get install deborphan) - this is a tiny program that will identify unused packages
