2008-10-20T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	works fine for me and my 3 PCs all running 64bit linux
2008-10-20T02:28:00.000Z	Xavura	ActionParsnip	That did nothing.
2008-10-20T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	make sure you are using the right sound setings in your apps
2008-10-20T02:35:00.000Z	Xavura	ActionParsnip	Wth should settings have to do with anything, I haven't TOUCHED my **** settings and it just stopped working on it's own
2008-10-20T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	well something isnt right or itd work so you need to play with them to getit working. Its not gonna start working if you sit and stare at it is it
2008-10-20T02:36:00.000Z	Xavura	ActionParsnip	But it DID work and it worked 100% so wtf has it stopped working for no reason
2008-10-20T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	you need to research and prod your system to see whats what
2008-10-20T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	well something has changed or itd work wouldnt it
2008-10-20T02:37:00.000Z	Xavura	ActionParsnip	Right, so where do you propose I start "researching" whatever that means
2008-10-20T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	well check what sound server you use fo the system and make sure it all marrys up in all the apps you use, look at the settings in apps that do work then compare with the ones that dont
2008-10-20T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	you can websearch for: no sound in <app name>
2008-10-20T02:38:00.000Z	Xavura	ActionParsnip	Ha, you think I didn't web search that? I did before I came here and none of the suggestions worked
2008-10-20T02:39:00.000Z	Xavura	ActionParsnip	The ones that don't work are apparently Firefox which has no settings for me to change and the Hardware Testing program which also produces no sound on the sound test
2008-10-20T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	thats all i can suggest. have you recently installed a newe kernel?
2008-10-20T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xavura	then go find out
