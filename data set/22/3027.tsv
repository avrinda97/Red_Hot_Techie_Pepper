2008-12-30T02:50:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	Did you take the CD out when you rebooted?  What did you do after it rebooted?
2008-12-30T02:50:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	i didn't have a cd inserted, the instal cd was mounted
2008-12-30T02:50:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	when it rebooted i waited for it to boot back up again..
2008-12-30T02:50:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	Mounted within windows?  So there was no physical CD involved at all?
2008-12-30T02:50:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	correct
2008-12-30T02:51:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	Wubi wont touch your bootloader at all, it simply adds an entry into the boot.ini for windows
2008-12-30T02:52:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	so how can it have written to boot.ini if it didn't realise i have a raid array? :S
2008-12-30T02:53:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	because boot.ini is just a file, and it can write to it just like you write to any file in windows
2008-12-30T02:54:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	I don't see any reason why it would have touched your RAID array, no.
2008-12-30T02:56:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	that's a bootable cd? hopefully it
2008-12-30T02:56:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	that's a bootable cd? hopefully it's not large, slow internet here
2008-12-30T02:56:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	What's a bootable CD?
2008-12-30T02:56:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	a live cd? something i can boot from - i have no dos / shell
2008-12-30T02:57:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	Yeah. A liveCD is a bootable CD.  But you may be meaning to talk to stefg
2008-12-30T02:57:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	appologies
2008-12-30T02:59:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	so you dont know what could have caused the raid array to fail? any guesses?
2008-12-30T02:59:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	No idea
2008-12-30T04:31:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	are you still here? I removed my new 1tb hdd and plugged in my cd drive (removed the cd drive as i didnt have enough power cables on my psu) and now vista/ubuntu boot fine - i dont understand
2008-12-30T04:32:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	it wasnt the fault of the 1tb drive because i know it works fine, been using it
2008-12-30T04:32:00.000Z	Flannel	sneakers2	It could be a power supply issue?  I don't know.  Or it could be that your drive numbers got changed, and that messed up windows
2008-12-30T04:33:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	must be yes, i'll remove that forum post,,,, hopefully if i remove wubi via the windows uninstaller and stick my 1tb drive back in, it'll all work ok again. i still intend on installing ubuntu (properly) next week so it can be on both desktop and laptop
2008-12-30T04:34:00.000Z	sneakers2	Flannel	thanks for the help, strange errors like this confuse me!
