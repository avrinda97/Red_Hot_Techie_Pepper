2007-10-24T11:29:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	Did you reboot?
2007-10-24T11:48:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 Did you go back in and re-enable after reboot?
2007-10-24T11:50:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	any error messages?
2007-10-24T11:50:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	h,,,
2007-10-24T11:51:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 it just goes back to disabled?
2007-10-24T11:51:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	What vid card are you using againg?
2007-10-24T11:52:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	and you installed the nvidia_glx restricted driver before you rebooted right?
2007-10-24T11:53:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 I am not too sure then.  You did a clean install to Gutsy, right?
2007-10-24T11:54:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 I ran into the same problem with my upgrade.
2007-10-24T11:54:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 It worked with a clean install
2007-10-24T11:54:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 try burning your Gutsy CD at a lower speed
2007-10-24T11:55:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 I do all my burning on CD-Rs about 18x cause I know it will work better.  Also, where did you DL your ISO file from?
2007-10-24T11:56:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	Yeah, I would try burning at a lower speed.
2007-10-24T11:57:00.000Z	LivingInX	cube_	 When and what were you doing at the time?  I remember on my either 6.06 or 7.04 cds, had a check cd for defects option on boot.
