2010-08-03T08:36:00.000Z	SteelWing		congrats. I can't delete anything because my install of ubuntu doesn't seem to know what trash is.
2010-08-03T08:37:00.000Z	SteelWing		Axel: I know how to delete but the system does not recognize that it has a trash applet
2010-08-03T08:38:00.000Z	SteelWing		I'm looking at a trash desktop icon on my desktop if I click it I get the following error "Could not didsplay "trash:" the file is of an unknown type.
2010-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	SteelWing		Its vanished from the taskbar and I only got it to get on my desktop via gconf-editor.
2010-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	Wiesshund	SteelWing	right click task bar and simply re add it
2010-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	SteelWing	Wiesshund	Thats the problem. When I attempt to re add it nothing happens
2010-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	SteelWing		Its like the system doesn't have a trash applet
2010-08-03T08:40:00.000Z	SteelWing		I can't even browse to it
2010-08-03T08:40:00.000Z	SteelWing		I attempt to browse to my trash folder and it says that the operation is not supported
2010-08-03T08:40:00.000Z	SteelWing		I can sort of add a trash icon to the upper task bar but upon attempted use it tells me nautilus had a spawn error.
2010-08-03T08:41:00.000Z	Wiesshund	SteelWing	hmm. anything you remember doing before it went on vacation?
2010-08-03T08:41:00.000Z	Wiesshund	SteelWing	if you need to delete a file, you get an error as well?
2010-08-03T08:42:00.000Z	SteelWing		I was trying to update Glib
2010-08-03T08:42:00.000Z	SteelWing		I sort of was still running on the stock 2.0
2010-08-03T08:42:00.000Z	SteelWing		I did get it to update.
2010-08-03T08:43:00.000Z	SteelWing		Weisshund I was trying to update Glib
2010-08-03T08:44:00.000Z	Wiesshund		SteelWingI dont have an answer on restoring the trash bin, but shift delete will bypass the bin
2010-08-03T08:44:00.000Z	SteelWing		Shift Delete does nothin
2010-08-03T08:44:00.000Z	SteelWing		nothing*
2010-08-03T08:45:00.000Z	SteelWing		Its like the OS forgot how to remove data. I guess I need to track down a list of dependencies for the trash applet and reinstall them all one by one.
2010-08-03T08:45:00.000Z	SteelWing		Do Trash or any of the Gnome Applets use Glib?
2010-08-03T08:46:00.000Z	Wiesshund	SteelWing	i dont think so
