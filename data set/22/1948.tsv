2011-03-23T08:11:00.000Z	grendal-prime		its part of the rsync protocol..
2011-03-23T08:12:00.000Z	grendal-prime		i would marry the develops ugly sister if he asked me to
2011-03-23T08:12:00.000Z	grendal-prime		errr..or she?
2011-03-23T08:13:00.000Z	grendal-prime		look im just saying..alot of people know about it ohsix but honestly i dont know many people that have the situation i have where they have to move as much data as i do..im just letting everyone know..."hey..ive put it through the pases and you can even use it for stuff that yo wouldnt normally consider)
2011-03-23T08:13:00.000Z	grendal-prime		and im trying to let hoho know..its probably were he is going to wind up so he should start there.
2011-03-23T08:15:00.000Z	grendal-prime		since then...2 years.. 4 line script  and guess what...not a single prolem.
2011-03-23T08:16:00.000Z	grendal-prime		and ohsix  your right...i know windows users that will actually build a linux box just to use rsync to move data.
2011-03-23T08:16:00.000Z	grendal-prime		and they for the most part to not tell anyone about it..but...it is there..hidding in a closet somewhere.
2011-03-23T08:17:00.000Z	grendal-prime		lurking if you will
2011-03-23T08:17:00.000Z	grendal-prime		lurk lurk...WHAMMO move data..lurk lurk.
2011-03-23T08:17:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	why not just use rsync on windows?
2011-03-23T08:19:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	are you going to give any reasons or are you just going to keep defering and saying different things blow etc?
2011-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	we were talking about rsync on windows, not nfs.
2011-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	grendal-prime	crus	right
2011-03-23T08:22:00.000Z	grendal-prime	crus	you got a windows system that will deal with that?
2011-03-23T08:22:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	okay, so what was the problem with rsync on windows exactly? we seem to have gone a bit sideways with this one
2011-03-23T08:24:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	more then likely, rsync had a hard time dealing with too many files in a single directory, which is a more a problem to do with NTFS rather then rsync..
2011-03-23T08:25:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	and probably more to do with you not understanding the limitations of the file system you were using.
2011-03-23T08:27:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	no, you're missing the point.. rsync is not at fault..
2011-03-23T08:29:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	No, you told me how everything else sucks/blows, whatever.
2011-03-23T08:31:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	250000 files in 1 folder is poor management to begin with imo.
2011-03-23T08:33:00.000Z	crus	grendal-prime	sorry, im not devoting 100% of my attention to you're stupidity ;)
