2010-06-16T07:26:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 lshw, nice
2010-06-16T07:35:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 I'll sure try. g'nite
2010-06-17T23:25:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 the thing about sudo -i (vs -s) is that it reads the /root/.profile which may not be desired
2010-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	unop	AAA	errm, not if root's shell is bash.
2010-06-17T23:27:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 I'm just saying that if you have custom dotfile that you expect to work, they won't with root's profile. that's all
2010-06-17T23:27:00.000Z	unop	AAA	a custom dot file in your own homedirectory?
2010-06-17T23:28:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 correct. if I have a bunch of stuff in my .bashrc and then I sudo -i, I no longer have those things in the sudo shell. where as with sudo -s I do
2010-06-17T23:30:00.000Z	unop	AAA	right, one's a login shell (-i) and you'd expect it not to touch your dotfiles, another's an escalation of your shell (with some changes) which you'd expect to source your dotfiles .
2010-06-17T23:30:00.000Z	unop	AAA	though, most often, it's a login shell that's needed.
2010-06-17T23:31:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 I guess it is just habit that I always use -s
2010-06-17T23:31:00.000Z	unop	AAA	that can be dangerous .. but i guess you know that already.
2010-06-17T23:33:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 so can irc'n as root, but I see that all day long =p
2010-06-25T15:29:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 brijithmac1 but the directive makes no sense to bash
2010-06-25T15:29:00.000Z	unop	AAA	what directive?
2010-06-25T15:29:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 DISPLAY
2010-06-25T15:29:00.000Z	unop	AAA	 you mean like this.   DISPLAY=blah command ??
2010-06-25T15:29:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 brijithmac1 does $ env show that DISPLAY var?
2010-06-25T15:29:00.000Z	unop	AAA	and often, it is not bash that is used to run cron ..
2010-06-25T15:30:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 default 10.4 is though
2010-06-25T15:30:00.000Z	unop	AAA	 in either case, that's a valid command.
2010-06-25T15:30:00.000Z	AAA	unop	 got it
