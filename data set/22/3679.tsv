2009-02-05T07:17:00.000Z	bigmb		How do you install the c, c++, and ruby libraries? Also, does this support pthreads?
2009-02-05T07:18:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	build-essentials, has gcc and g++
2009-02-05T07:19:00.000Z	bigmb	WebcamWonder	what's the command? I'm too windowsized lately :(
2009-02-05T07:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	sudo aptitude install build-essential, installs gcc and g++ required to compile c and c++ programs
2009-02-05T07:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	Among other programs
2009-02-05T07:25:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	g++ or .cpp files
2009-02-05T07:26:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	for*
2009-02-05T07:28:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	can you do: locate pthread.h
2009-02-05T07:29:00.000Z	bigmb	WebcamWonder	there is no return to the statement when I type it in terminal, just the next prompt
2009-02-05T07:29:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	That means you don't have pthread, wait let me search which packages offers it
2009-02-05T07:30:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=659279 suggests you need to install glibc
2009-02-05T07:31:00.000Z	bigmb	WebcamWonder	sudo apt-get install glibc ?? it said couldn't find glibc
2009-02-05T07:32:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	Do a, sudo aptitude search glibc, and tell me which packages you get
2009-02-05T07:33:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	umm, don't sudo that, just aptitude search glibc
2009-02-05T07:36:00.000Z	bigmb	WebcamWonder	ok, sudo aptitude install glibc worked. Afterwards, I tried to g++ again and still doesn't know of pthread
2009-02-05T07:36:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	What version of ubuntu are you on?
2009-02-05T07:36:00.000Z	bigmb	WebcamWonder	in c++, I just include <iostream> so I just <pthread> but do I have to <pthread.h> instead?
2009-02-05T07:38:00.000Z	bigmb	WebcamWonder	Ubuntu 8.04
2009-02-05T07:38:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	I don't know. Haven't worked with pthreads
2009-02-05T07:38:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	Are you have glibc package? :S Weird... are you sure it insatlled it?
2009-02-05T07:38:00.000Z	bigmb	WebcamWonder	Yeah, I installed. I just put .h and it compiled fine...I'm going to make sure the functions work fine. Silly  mistakes
2009-02-05T07:39:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	bigmb	No problems. Thats what I am here for :P
