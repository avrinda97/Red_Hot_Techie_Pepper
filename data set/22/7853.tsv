2006-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	GTroy		anyone helo?
2006-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	wrong channel for that
2006-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	i'm not sure, perhaps #hardware ? i have no idea
2006-05-15T13:54:00.000Z	GTroy	eobanb_	well people here usually help with hardware too
2006-05-15T13:54:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	yes, that's true, but only when it has to do with ubuntu
2006-05-16T09:30:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	i've had good experiences with DOSbox on mac os x
2006-05-16T09:30:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	so that's what i'd recommend you try.
2006-05-16T10:01:00.000Z	GTroy	eobanb_	could you tell me how to get to dosbox prompt?
2006-05-16T10:01:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	what happens when you just run dosbox
2006-05-16T10:02:00.000Z	GTroy	eobanb_	that's it, I don't know how to
2006-05-16T10:02:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	type 'dosbox' ?
2006-05-16T10:02:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	did you sudo apt-get install dosbox
2006-05-16T10:02:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	why?
2006-05-16T10:03:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	okay....
2006-05-16T10:03:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	i suggest you just install it through apt
2006-05-16T10:04:00.000Z	GTroy	eobanb_	doing that now
2006-05-16T10:05:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	can i ask you why you usually install programmes mostly from source?
2006-05-16T10:05:00.000Z	GTroy	eobanb_	mostly out of habit
2006-05-16T10:06:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	that's completely unnecessary on just about all modern distros
2006-05-16T10:40:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	what programme?
2006-05-16T10:41:00.000Z	eobanb_	GTroy	the config file is probably somewhere in /etc/
