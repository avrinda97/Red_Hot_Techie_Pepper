2008-05-04T09:16:00.000Z	drivetrax	navjeet	 -- apt-get the driver from Ubuntu.. again
2008-05-04T09:17:00.000Z	drivetrax	navjeet	 You may want to Remove the driver, apt-get a new one, and see if it fixes

2008-05-04T09:24:00.000Z	drivetrax		ya kno.. I have a drive with 98 on it.. thinking, triple boot
2008-05-04T09:25:00.000Z	drivetrax		na.. it would be best to slap that drive back and piece together that machine, and network it into Ubuntu
2008-05-04T09:27:00.000Z	drivetrax		Vista can read ext
2008-05-04T09:28:00.000Z	drivetrax		yes
