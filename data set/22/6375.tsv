2007-05-31T14:18:00.000Z	devin_		hey CheshireViking thanks for your help man
2007-05-31T14:18:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	no probs, did it work?
2007-05-31T14:19:00.000Z	devin_		yeah CheshireViking just wondering if the nv is the right driver to use for a geforce go 4 440
2007-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	devin_		i mean it works alright, just wondering if it gives me the best performence
2007-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	i would start with the nv driver, i don't think you get 3d working with it, but it'll get X working, then you can upgrade to nvidia drivers via synaptic
2007-05-31T14:20:00.000Z	devin_		well thats the thing CheshireViking the whole xserver went black once i tried to enable byrl and it says it needed to change out the drivers
2007-05-31T14:22:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	i'm not certain then, that sounds like its beryl related, you can only try it, but i wouldn't like to say whether it'll work
2007-05-31T14:23:00.000Z	devin_		damn now whenever i log in to the account it restarts after 5 secs
2007-05-31T14:25:00.000Z	devin_		i'm gona try re runing the config and selecting vesa then if that works fix the nv somehow
2007-05-31T14:25:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	maybe you need to uninstall beryl or at least switch the window manager back to metacity from command line
2007-05-31T14:26:00.000Z	devin_		i don't think it's been switched over yet, because i needed to restart then re-enable it CheshireViking
2007-05-31T14:27:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	ok, i was thinking that you'd started it originally giving you the black screen & now xorg is set to nv that beryl was still trying to start
2007-05-31T14:27:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	when you start up/try logging into gnome, can you select metacity as the window manager?
2007-05-31T14:28:00.000Z	devin_	CheshireViking	well orginally I was fine, then when i tried to start byrle it said it needed to restart to swap the drivers then i needed to activate beryl
2007-05-31T14:28:00.000Z	devin_		how do i select the wm?
2007-05-31T14:28:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	good question, i thought there might have been something in the options button near the bottom of the screen (i think)
2007-05-31T14:30:00.000Z	devin_	CheshireViking	somthing else when i booted nv, my dark blacks had differn't colored artifacs in them
2007-05-31T14:30:00.000Z	devin_		before it restarted
2007-05-31T14:30:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	i'm not sure what else to suggest, i can't think of anything else
2007-05-31T14:31:00.000Z	devin_	CheshireViking	don't worry about it man
2007-05-31T14:31:00.000Z	devin_		thanks for the help CheshireViking
2007-05-31T14:31:00.000Z	CheshireViking	devin_	no probs, good luck solving it anyway
