2009-04-30T21:53:00.000Z	jtholmes	qkslvrwolf	have u looked on launchpad to see if anyone has filed a bug
2009-04-30T21:53:00.000Z	qkslvrwolf	jtholmes	 well, without running totem with sudo
2009-04-30T21:53:00.000Z	jtholmes	qkslvrwolf	yes i know sudo for your totem
2009-04-30T21:53:00.000Z	qkslvrwolf	jtholmes	 yes, but everyone seems to think it's a libdvdcss problem.
2009-04-30T21:54:00.000Z	qkslvrwolf	jtholmes	 I'm trying to find my old ubuntuforums login, so I can post up there.
2009-04-30T21:54:00.000Z	qkslvrwolf	jtholmes	 if no one has an answer I guess I'll file a bug...
2009-04-30T21:55:00.000Z	jtholmes	qkslvrwolf	always search launchpad to see if a bug already exists and if so add you info to it
