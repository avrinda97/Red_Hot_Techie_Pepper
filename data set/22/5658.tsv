2007-06-17T12:36:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	 i am confused about partitioning, i think i almost blew all my files because feisty jumped to a point where she was showing a guided partitioning of 20 gigs, which is my entire harddrive, and when i got to the migration page, she said that there were NO files or docs suitable for migration, and that iff i coninued i would lose all data previously stored on the partitions
2007-06-17T12:38:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	also i don't know how to get to this chatroom from firefox, so when i ran into this prob had to abort install and bootleg up xp to get seamonkey which has the direct connect to chatzilla
2007-06-17T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	You can get on IRC using Gaim, which comes on the Ubuntu LiveCD, you can also install xchat which is made specifically for IRC ( you can install small applications into RAM while running the LiveCD )

2007-06-17T12:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	Did you choose guided partitioning from the beginning and did you choose to keep your windows partition and just re-size it?
2007-06-17T12:48:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	sorry, phone rang... i don't really know if i made the right choices on the guided partition; at one point it told me that i had almmost 6 gigs of free space, and the partition it was gonna do was 89%; bbut i don't know 89% of what.  in the end it looked like it wsas gonna wipe out xp completely so i aborted
2007-06-17T12:51:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	is there a way for me to get chatzilla up to come to this room from firefox in ubuntu during install?
2007-06-17T12:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	I am sure that there is, but I don't use chatzilla, why not use Xchat or Gaim?
2007-06-17T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	Yes, it's a little hard to use compared to xchat though for IRC
2007-06-17T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	You can install Xchat on the LiveCD ( it will just store it temporarily in RAM ), just go to Applications -> Add / Remove
2007-06-17T12:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	Yes, The Ubuntu install CD is a Full version of Ubuntu running while you install, you can do anything you want while installing :)
2007-06-17T12:57:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	k, thanks, b back in a few
2007-06-17T13:23:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	got xchat running; now going back to install ...
2007-06-17T13:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	Ok
2007-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	i see you are real busy helping the whole world, i will be patient.  Screen reads: Prepare Disk Space.  How do you want to partition the disk? () Guided - Resize IDE1 master, partition #1 (hda1) and use freed space.  New partition size: 89%...
2007-06-17T13:35:00.000Z	mikeyhatesms	Jordan_U	are you gnna be around long enough to help me through the partitioning, and if so should we open a private window, and if so, how?  if you're tired or not gnna be around, can you reccomend someone to help me through it?
2007-06-17T13:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	Yes, choose to re-size partition 1, Are you sure that you have enough free space to install Ubuntu?
2007-06-17T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	guided.
2007-06-17T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	There is probably a slider on the window you are looking at that will let you choose what % of the disk to use for Ubuntu
2007-06-17T14:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mikeyhatesms	To make things simpler you could resize your partition first using Gparted ( available on the LiveCD ) or partition magic ( from windows ) then you can just tell the installer to use the free space
