2005-12-16T08:29:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	open your home folder and type in the address bar smb://<windows machine name or IP address>
2005-12-16T08:33:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	applications, system tools, applications menu editor
2005-12-16T08:33:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	and change it to have an address bar in nautilus
2005-12-16T08:34:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	nautilus is to linux what explorer is to windows
2005-12-16T08:36:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	until you figure it out, from a console type nautilus smb://<windows computer name or IP address>
2005-12-16T08:39:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	try places>>network server
2005-12-16T08:40:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	when you put in the username, you might have to put in machinename\username
2005-12-16T08:58:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	sorry I had to leave for a while
2005-12-16T08:59:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	ok so you are getting the password prompt from the windows machine, right?
2005-12-16T08:59:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	does the windows machine have a password set?
2005-12-16T08:59:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	what share permissions are on the windows shared folder?
2005-12-16T09:00:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	temporarily give network users access to the share...read write...it is just for a minute
2005-12-16T09:03:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	what are the folder permissions, specifically
2005-12-16T09:04:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	it probably isnt a password issue
2005-12-16T09:07:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	are you using breezy?
2005-12-16T09:11:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	post it at ubuntu.paste.nl
2005-12-16T09:18:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	I just setup a share and used it..worked fine...I think you have an issue on the windows side
2005-12-16T09:19:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	yes, and I set up the share on windows to allow network users to change files, and no password is needed as well
2005-12-16T09:20:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	mkyb14	that is my two cents, I hope it helps...gotta run wife needs help with our baby
