2008-10-04T07:53:00.000Z	histo		Yes you can even use md5sums to find certain files.  I use them to find kiddy porn on computers i'm investigating.
2008-10-04T07:54:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	that's WAY out of line for this channel ...
2008-10-04T07:54:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	not to mention it shows a complete ignorance of what md5 does ;)
2008-10-04T07:54:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	? i'm le
2008-10-04T07:54:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	and no its not we can search by hashes or md5sums
2008-10-04T07:55:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	excuse my ignorance with the terminology.
2010-03-17T01:45:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	he doesn't need a full mail server just sending
2010-03-17T01:46:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	he needs SMTP. Postfix is SMTP. and only SMTP.
2010-03-17T01:46:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	I thought postfix was a full mail server
2010-03-17T01:46:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	nvm it is just a mta
2010-03-17T01:46:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	no, you need Dovecot or similar for POP3/IMAP
2010-03-17T01:50:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	nah postfix can send and receive mail
2010-03-17T01:54:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	receiving mail is part of SMTP. ssmtp just does not implement it.
2010-03-17T02:03:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	thats why i was suggesting just using ssmtp much easier to setup than postfix
2010-03-17T02:05:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	postfix has become too complex over the years for a simple mta. but to each his own.
2010-03-19T20:59:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	do NOT use *.*
2010-03-19T20:59:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	that will change the permissions of your entire filesystem. not just the dir you are in.
2010-03-19T21:00:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	No no I would add a path infront
2010-03-19T21:00:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	chmod a-w -R /blah/Music/*.*
2010-03-19T21:00:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	that makes sense
2010-03-19T21:01:00.000Z	histo	mneptok	Wouldn't that remove write from all the directories also and not just the mp3 files in sub directoires?
2010-03-19T21:01:00.000Z	mneptok	histo	i'd use xargs to do that.
