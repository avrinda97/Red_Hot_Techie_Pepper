2011-06-15T07:37:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	just install the linux-firmware-nonfree package, that has the firmware for p54usb (it goes in /lib/firmware)
2011-06-15T07:37:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	however, if this is natty, the device won't work unless you upgrade to linux-image-2.6.38-10 (which has the patch that fixes it)
2011-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	....of course
2011-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	packages.ubuntu.com has deb links?
2011-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	yes
2011-06-15T07:49:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	sorry, it seems the new kernel isn't on packages.ubuntu.com yet (or I can't find it), since it is still in proposed, but it is here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+package/linux-image-2.6.38-10-generic
2011-06-15T07:51:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	oops, wrong link again, https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+package/linux-image-2.6.38-10-generic
2011-06-15T08:15:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	you upgraded the kernel too?
2011-06-15T08:17:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	all dmesg gets me is wlan0: direct probe to *ip* timed out after 3 tries
2011-06-15T08:17:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	that makes me think you don't have the new kernel, because that is the bug that was patched (well a side effect of it anyway)
2011-06-15T08:17:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	what is: uname -a;
2011-06-15T08:17:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	oh, hold on
2011-06-15T08:18:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	probably need to update grub, right?
2011-06-15T08:18:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	the triggers should update it, but you can: sudo update-grub; to be sure
2011-06-15T08:19:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	yeah, sorry, I mentioned later, it isn't on packages.ubuntu.com because it is in proposed, I have a link, one sec
2011-06-15T08:20:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	oh, sorry. I was probably installing linux at the time and it got washed away by the famous #ubuntu flood :P
2011-06-15T08:21:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+package/linux-image-2.6.38-10-generic choose i386 or amd64 at the bottom and it will be in the downloadable files on the next page
2011-06-15T08:22:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	it was my fault for directing you to the wrong place in the first place :)
2011-06-15T08:23:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	so I just need the image or does that include a kernel too?
2011-06-15T08:23:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	linux-image packages are the kernels plus the modules
2011-06-15T08:24:00.000Z	trism	Tekk_	you may need the headers too if you use nvidia proprietary drivers (or something similar)
2011-06-15T08:24:00.000Z	Tekk_	trism	nope, I'm good there
