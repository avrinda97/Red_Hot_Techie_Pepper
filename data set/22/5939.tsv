2007-08-04T13:13:00.000Z	terapicodave	hwilde	can it be a switch on your laptop?

2007-08-04T13:15:00.000Z	terapicodave		have you eliminated hardware?

2007-08-04T13:16:00.000Z	hwilde	terapicodave	tried multiple known good hardware
2007-08-04T13:17:00.000Z	terapicodave	hwilde	is it localized so just network stuff that no longer shows? sound works?
2007-08-04T13:18:00.000Z	hwilde	terapicodave	sounds, networking, parallel, serial, usb, etc still works.  eth0 and eth1  are gone
2007-08-04T13:18:00.000Z	terapicodave		does /etc/network/interfaces still list them?
