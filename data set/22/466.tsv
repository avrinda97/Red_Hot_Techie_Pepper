2011-12-21T23:26:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	you need to look at the logs on the vpn server
2011-12-21T23:27:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	if you are failing authentication the vpn server is where you need to start debugging it
2011-12-21T23:28:00.000Z	d8bhatta	ikonia	I am not sure where should I do, I have tested so many options using pptp
2011-12-21T23:28:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	you should do what I just told you to do
2011-12-21T23:30:00.000Z	d8bhatta	ikonia	 Unfortunately I cannot see server log because client has given me vpn connection parameters.
2011-12-21T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	then you need to talk to the client and ask them to review the logs or monitor them while you try to connect
2012-06-19T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	check what amazons relaying dependencies are
2012-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	what version of ubuntu are you running
2012-09-25T12:18:00.000Z	d8bhatta	ikonia	12.04
2012-09-25T12:18:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	and you are serving PHP from that 12.04 install ?
2012-09-25T12:20:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	and you are serving PHP from that 12.04 install ?
2012-09-25T12:20:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	ok, so you've got a 12.04 host serving a PHP application....the windows XP client gets a permisson denied problem, correct
2012-09-25T12:20:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	ok - so Windows XP is serving PHP ?
2012-09-25T12:21:00.000Z	d8bhatta	ikonia	yes, windows xp is servcing LAMP , only files are referenced to the location of ubuntu dir
2012-09-25T12:21:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	ok, then ##windows is the correct channel to get help in
2012-09-25T12:21:00.000Z	ikonia	d8bhatta	the issue is with windows XP serving PHP
2012-09-25T12:22:00.000Z	d8bhatta	ikonia	hmm...sounds good
