2006-07-08T06:09:00.000Z	Moocasso		I'm having trouble compiling something, and I've already killed one installation, so before I try it, I'd like some help if I could get some :)  I'm following the instructions in the readme, and the first step is ./configure, which gives me an error 'SDL version 1.2.0 not found'
2006-07-08T06:11:00.000Z	Moocasso		I'm having trouble compiling something, and I've already killed one installation, so before I try it, I'd like some help if I could get some :)  I'm following the instructions in the readme, and the first step is ./configure, which gives me an error 'SDL version 1.2.0 not found'  Do I need to download SDL?  Or is there a package for it under Synaptic under a different name?  Or should I ignore it?
2006-07-08T06:11:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	Please don't repeat your self
2006-07-08T06:11:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	sorry, didn't see a response...
2006-07-08T06:12:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	Does an older version of the program exist in repositories ?
2006-07-08T06:12:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	If so, you might be able to get build-essential fetch the dependencies for you
2006-07-08T06:12:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	I didn't see anything named SDL, would it possibly be under a different name?
2006-07-08T06:12:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	Which program are you trying to install ?
2006-07-08T06:13:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	Dosbox, it's a DOS emulator
2006-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	It's in repositories
2006-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	apt-get install dosbox
2006-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	(As root)
2006-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	 As in, in Synaptic somewhere, right?  Or am I missing something...
2006-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	k, I'll try that
2006-07-08T06:15:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	Oh, sorry. I'm using clean Debian. But I would be surprised if it was not available in the Ubuntu Repositories
2006-07-08T06:15:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	 It says it can't find the package
2006-07-08T06:15:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	Have you enabled Multiverse ?
2006-07-08T06:16:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	Could you pastebin the content of /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2006-07-08T06:16:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	 Ooo, sorry, hold on, my bad, seems ot be working now
2006-07-08T06:16:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	No problem :)
2006-07-08T06:17:00.000Z	Moocasso	Jemt	Seems to have worked that time :D  Now I just need to figure out how to use the bloody program, lol.  Thankyou very much :)
2006-07-08T06:17:00.000Z	Jemt	Moocasso	You are very welcome :)
