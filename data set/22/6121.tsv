2006-12-24T17:20:00.000Z	Pelo	ubek_	 turn on the system monitor and see what is eating up your cpu /mem
2006-12-24T17:21:00.000Z	ubek_	Pelo	i dont hawe cpu command
2006-12-24T17:21:00.000Z	Pelo	ubek_	  system >admin > system monitor
2006-12-24T17:23:00.000Z	ubek_	Pelo	on 1 sec from cpu use from 8% its grow to 100%
2006-12-24T17:24:00.000Z	Pelo	ubek_	 which process
2006-12-24T17:24:00.000Z	ubek_	Pelo	no one
2006-12-24T17:25:00.000Z	Pelo	ubek_	 click the cpu column header to order the process in order of the cpu usage and keep watching what happens
2006-12-24T17:27:00.000Z	ubek_	Pelo	its too many of procees i cant wath them all
2006-12-24T17:28:00.000Z	Pelo	ubek_	 the offending process will jump to the top of the list if you clicked the cpu column header
2006-12-24T17:28:00.000Z	Pelo	ubek_	 just use your computer normaly and when it does slow down , have a look and see which process is on top
2006-12-24T17:30:00.000Z	ubek_	Pelo	in theory yes but not in this case ;] 
2006-12-24T17:30:00.000Z	ubek_	Pelo	 its just halting
2006-12-24T17:30:00.000Z	Pelo	ubek_	 is the best I can do for you
