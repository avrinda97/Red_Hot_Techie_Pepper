2010-08-03T00:11:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	i am new to this convo, tell me what you are trying to accomplish
2010-08-03T00:12:00.000Z	mr	blitzo	i am trying to get wireless to work with a dell mini 10, because it picks signals up but will not connect to those signals
2010-08-03T00:12:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	when you say "it picks up", which "it" are you talking about?  please be explicit
2010-08-03T00:13:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	how do you lnow your ubuntu is picking up signals
2010-08-03T00:14:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	and what happens when you select the ssid?
2010-08-03T00:17:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	spell out the person's full name when you reply.  on some irc clients you can do that by typing the first couple letters and press <tab>
2010-08-03T00:18:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	so it is asking for a passowrd, you type it in, and never connect?
2010-08-03T00:20:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	i need to see something from a system log but i don't know how to get it
2010-08-03T00:22:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	go to command line and type "sudo apt-get install pastebinit"
2010-08-03T00:23:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	hang on
2010-08-03T00:23:00.000Z	blitzo	mr	private chat
