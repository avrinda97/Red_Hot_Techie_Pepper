2005-08-08T10:19:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	there's a chance if it is single-track and you know its format
2005-08-08T10:19:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	most "raw" images have mode2/2352
2005-08-08T10:20:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	and how would i find that out?
2005-08-08T10:21:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	try this script: http://deadbeefbabe.org/paste/1314
2005-08-08T10:23:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	if file tells you it's iso-9660, it's doing ok
2005-08-08T10:25:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	well.. it is :)
2005-08-08T10:25:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	so i should just wait that out and burn the iso?
2005-08-08T10:25:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	yeah, just restart the script and let it convert the whole file and burn it after that
2005-08-08T10:25:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	thx a lot :)
2005-08-08T10:26:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	this is way better then some binary windows executable doing it :) at least i can see what its doing now basicly :)
2005-08-08T10:26:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	hehe
2005-08-08T13:12:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	you gave me a script to convert *.bin to *.iso.. but somehow this screwed up the video.. the .bin plays fine in mplayer, while the .iso gives a beautifull mess of colours :S
2005-08-08T13:13:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	uhh, that's bad
2005-08-08T13:13:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	this only works reliable with data CDs
2005-08-08T13:14:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	ok, so then i should maybe figure a way to generate a .cue for this .bin
2005-08-08T13:14:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	sorry for not telling you this :)
2005-08-08T13:14:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	nm, just costs me a cdr :P
2005-08-08T13:15:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	you have any ideas on how to proceed?
2005-08-08T13:16:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	if it's an (S)VCD take a look at .cue's of other images
2005-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	thx.. i'll try and find some
2005-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	gregg_	wdh	(S)VCD images of course :)
2005-08-08T13:17:00.000Z	wdh	gregg_	although everyone seems to loose them :P
