2009-08-15T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 note that removing a program (even with purge) - will NOT remove the users settings.
2009-08-22T12:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 i recall  that i had to initate 'pairing' from the phone.. then enter the PIN on the pc.. if i tried it from the pc  it always failed.
2010-03-05T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 thers a ubuntu-minimal setup i recall.. but your question isent very clear.
2010-03-05T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 how did they get removed?
2010-03-05T19:29:00.000Z	dehqan	Dr_Willis	 apt-get
2010-03-05T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 well if youve just randomly removed a lot of packages.. You could start with reinstlaling 'ubuntu-desktop' i guess
2010-03-07T08:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 depends on the directory/file
2010-03-07T08:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 most subdirs are owned by root/root  or root/staff it seems
2010-03-07T08:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 they are not all the same .
2010-03-07T09:00:00.000Z	dehqan	Dr_Willis	 humble made all 644 , will cause a problem ?
2010-03-07T09:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 No idea..  i imagine its NOT a good idea.
2010-03-07T09:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 so i bet there will be some issues sometime. they were the permissiosn they were.. for a reason
2010-03-07T09:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 /var/lock seems to be 777 well its              drwxrwxrwt  2 root root    40 2010-03-06 11:11 lock
2010-03-07T09:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 no idea.
2010-03-07T09:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 I would be suprised at a single/simple command that would do it.
2010-03-07T09:03:00.000Z	dehqan	Dr_Willis	not single
2010-03-11T17:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 if its messed up you can just delete it - it will get remade at next login
2010-03-11T17:49:00.000Z	dehqan	Dr_Willis	thanks and how to chroot to non-root user?
2010-03-11T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 I think thats what you use the 'su' command for. normally
2010-03-11T17:51:00.000Z	dehqan	Dr_Willis	how to chroot to non-root user? su user ?
2010-03-11T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dehqan	 yes somthing like that.. when in doubt check the man pages and the --help options for the command
