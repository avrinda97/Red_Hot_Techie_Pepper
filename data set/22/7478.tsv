2006-10-01T05:19:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	well being in that space, you whould as fyrestrtr said describe the issue, in detail on one line
2006-10-01T05:22:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	what did you mean by "automatic"
2006-10-01T05:26:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	click on appplications, accessories, terminal and type in there
2006-10-01T05:33:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	 the access path is what I am looking for what is written in there
2006-10-01T05:33:00.000Z	TriGz	ompaul	/media/hda1 ?
2006-10-01T05:32:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	you have to have it avialble first
2006-10-01T05:32:00.000Z	TriGz	ompaul	it is availible.

2006-10-01T05:32:00.000Z	TriGz	ompaul	how do i find the name??
2006-10-01T05:34:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	in a terminal type this ln -s /media/hda1 /Desktop/ntfs
2006-10-01T05:35:00.000Z	TriGz	ompaul	 doesn.t show up.
2006-10-01T05:35:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	sorry that was wrong I do it again
2006-10-01T05:35:00.000Z	TriGz	ompaul	 Ok. :)
2006-10-01T05:35:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	 ln -s /media/hda1 /home/your-user-name/Desktop/ntfs
2006-10-01T05:37:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	when you are asking a question you need to help us help you, so being very specific is useful - you used the word automatic an that was not obvious to me what you were talking about - DO NOT try to write to NTFS
2006-10-01T05:38:00.000Z	TriGz	ompaul	ok, sorry about that.. If i ran a program.. (namely World of Warcraft) would that class as writing? xD
2006-10-01T05:38:00.000Z	ompaul	TriGz	read but don't write, blame some company for not helping people write to their filesystem
2006-10-01T05:38:00.000Z	TriGz	ompaul	does running wow class as writing?
