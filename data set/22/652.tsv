2012-01-07T00:12:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		I'm trying to manually configure my eth0 interface…but getting some error. http://pastebin.com/yxjZ6YTP
2012-01-07T00:12:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		I've provided error and my /etc/network/interfaces file
2012-01-07T00:13:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	why are you not using network manager ?
2012-01-07T00:14:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	do you have an eth0 device ?
2012-01-07T00:15:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	youre gateway is unreachable
2012-01-07T00:15:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	remove the gateway line and try it
2012-01-07T00:16:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	ikonia	perfect…error gone. But now while ping 8.8.8.8, its saying unknown host
2012-01-07T00:16:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	because you won't have a route out
2012-01-07T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	you need to use a valid gateway
2012-01-07T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	don't uncomment the gateway, it's unreachable, it will never work
2012-01-07T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	the network needs to be 1.0 AND the gateway line needs to be valid
2012-01-07T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	is this a guest or the host ?
2012-01-07T00:21:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	ok - so you are putting the guest on 192.168.1.X network, your gateway is 192.168.2.1 - 1.X cannot see 2.1
2012-01-07T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	that is how it's meant to work
2012-01-07T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	that is correct, it should not be able to see 192.168.2.1
2012-01-07T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	bridge mode bridges the physical devices, not the ip layer
2012-01-07T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	get it ?
2012-01-07T00:24:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	no problem, glad it clicked
2012-01-07T00:25:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	ikonia	yes, indeed I was struggling stupid.
2012-01-07T00:25:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	nothing stupid about it, virtual networking is complex
2012-01-07T00:25:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	ikonia	I really want to learn..more about it…whats good place to start with.
2012-01-07T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	abhinavmehta	tons of docs on the net, just apply common sense to what you're reading
