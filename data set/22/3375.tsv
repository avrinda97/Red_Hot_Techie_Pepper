2008-10-06T19:25:00.000Z	bheero		hi, when use flash in website and i want to look at a movie with totem(at the same time), my movie is playing in slow motion...why ? i heard that flash used 99% of my CPU.. how can i do ?
2008-10-06T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	flash is a closed source product and can't be supported by ubuntu, if it's eating your cpu you may need to talk to adobe
2008-10-06T19:25:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	but i dont know if that's true
2008-10-06T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	check out, use top to monitor your cpu useag
2008-10-06T19:26:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	? don't understund sorry
2008-10-06T19:27:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	you mean.. i need to seed the used % of my CPU ? but what kind of programm can do that?
2008-10-06T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	use the application "top" to monitor cpu usage, then launch a flash website to see wht your cpu uses
2008-10-06T19:28:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	40% is used... so what's the problem...
2008-10-06T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	open totem at the same time and see how much is used
2008-10-06T19:30:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	it don't go higher than 15% for each CPU(i've got a dual core)..
2008-10-06T19:30:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	so where di you get %40 from ?
2008-10-06T19:31:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	i just read fake
2008-10-06T19:31:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	you read fake /
2008-10-06T19:31:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	i need googles
2008-10-06T19:31:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	french ?
2008-10-06T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	so with totem and a flash movie running - how much cpu is in use
2008-10-06T19:32:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	20% for each CPU
2008-10-06T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	you just said it was 515
2008-10-06T19:33:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	IT CHANGE
2008-10-06T19:33:00.000Z	ikonia	bheero	so monitor it for a while
2008-10-06T19:34:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	ok thanks for you help..
2008-10-06T19:38:00.000Z	bheero	ikonia	i've just download VLC, and konw it work... so it's probably a problem between totem and flash...
