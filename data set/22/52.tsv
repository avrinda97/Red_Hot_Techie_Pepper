2012-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	shad0wfax	Queops	My bad yes i was :-=)
2012-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	the thing is i'm using the 2.2 version of psad, which is not a problem atm, it's just that iptables isn't logging at the default locations it esems
2012-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	Queops		seems*
2012-09-22T20:42:00.000Z	shad0wfax	Queops	Do you have syslog-ng installed?
2012-09-22T20:43:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	no, why would it be needed?
2012-09-22T20:44:00.000Z	shad0wfax	Queops	Ubuntu has as far as i know standard rsyslog installed,which i swapped for sysklogd in oreder to get psad working
2012-09-22T20:45:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	i even tried making a config rule on rsyslog for iptables to log into
2012-09-22T20:45:00.000Z	Queops		No success lol
2012-09-22T20:47:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	I'm almost quitting this psad bussiness, the firewall works lol
2012-09-22T20:48:00.000Z	shad0wfax	Queops	:-)  Well the two don't necesaarily have to bite
2012-09-22T20:48:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	the email warning and the extra awareness do help though
2012-09-22T20:49:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	I will make iptables spit the logs later kinda tired now, thanks anyway!
2012-09-22T20:49:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	and fyi running a server here
2012-09-22T20:49:00.000Z	shad0wfax	Queops	:-)  And the opportunity for triggering another script
2012-09-22T20:49:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	what do you mean?
2012-09-22T20:50:00.000Z	shad0wfax	Queops	:-)  Setting up psad is fairly easy have a look at:http://tljharmsen.blogspot.nl/2012/09/install-and-configure-working-port-scan.html

2012-09-22T20:54:00.000Z	Queops	shad0wfax	won't removing rsyslog affect other services or is it safe?
