2006-10-26T12:04:00.000Z	ehird		is it safe to install something via apt-get while a package manager is downloading something, and would it appear in the pckage manager? Basically do all package managers use the same database
2006-10-26T12:05:00.000Z	ehird		but if i close the package manager and do the apt-get would opening the package manager show it as installed and let me do the regular stuff with it?
2006-10-26T12:06:00.000Z	ehird		i guess it will then?
2006-10-26T12:07:00.000Z	ehird		guess i'll try myself :)

2006-10-26T12:10:00.000Z	ehird		except i already have python so ijust did apt-get install pygame
2006-10-26T12:11:00.000Z	ehird		before i compile, is there any other way to get pygame?
2006-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	jrib	ehird	pygame is in the repositories
2006-10-26T12:17:00.000Z	jrib	ehird	did you do 'sudo apt-get update' ?
2006-10-26T12:17:00.000Z	ehird	jrib	no, i guess i'll do that ;)
2006-10-28T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	ehird	build-essential is included on the cd
2006-10-28T06:23:00.000Z	ehird	jrib	on the alternate install cd? and does it include kernel-headers too?
2006-10-28T06:23:00.000Z	jrib	ehird	yes, it should include both of those
2006-10-28T06:23:00.000Z	ehird	jrib	and er, how would i go about installing it from there? >.>
2006-10-28T06:23:00.000Z	jrib	ehird	in synaptic, you can go to the edit menu and there should be an option to add the cd as a repository.  I think if you just pop in the cd, it should actually just prompt you to add it as a repository
2006-10-28T06:24:00.000Z	ehird	jrib	and i use synaptic on a system with no gui... how?
2006-10-28T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	ehird	then use apt-cdrom
2006-10-28T06:24:00.000Z	ehird	jrib	right, ok, thanks
2008-03-01T20:38:00.000Z	jrib	ehird	TriEdge32: discuss it elsewhere, not here
