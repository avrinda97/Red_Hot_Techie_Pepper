2006-10-27T06:09:00.000Z	trafaelwyr		I've recently installed Ubuntu (going on a week now) - coming from Win2kPro - so this is all still quite new to me.  Anyways, I have a question:  how do you create a folder?
2006-10-27T06:10:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	In the terminal, or in the filebrowser?
2006-10-27T06:11:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 well, err...I guess the filebrowser?
2006-10-27T06:11:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Simply right click an empty area, and click new folder.
2006-10-27T06:13:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 right click where?
2006-10-27T06:13:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	In any empty space in your file browser.
2006-10-27T06:18:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 hmm....how about in the terminal.  you see, I have 2 hdd - a 40gb and a 250gb (this one I have to tinker with as it's the slave drive - ntfs).  the 40gb is where I have Ubuntu installed.  how would I create a folder there?
2006-10-27T06:19:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Try to create a folder in your Home folder.
2006-10-27T06:20:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 well, when I double click on that, it shows me the folder I created (titled music).
2006-10-27T06:20:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Good then!
2006-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Don't try to create folders outside of your home folder.
2006-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Your home folder is meant for all your documents.
2006-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 no?  so, I don't want to create a folder where Local Drive is?
2006-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	No, that's meant for system.
2006-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	It prevents people from messing things up
2006-10-27T06:23:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 ah, ok.  so, when I download something, say from bittorrent, I'll be able to save to that folder as an option?
2006-10-27T06:24:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Yes you will be able to.
2006-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 ah, cool!  :-)  thanks for your help.  I'm sooo new to Linux and it's gonna take me awhile.  thanks for your help!
2006-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	I was new to linux only about 1.5 years ago
2006-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Don't worry, soon, you shall be an Ubuntu expert like all of us :D
2006-10-27T06:26:00.000Z	trafaelwyr	DJAdmiral	 thanks for the support.  I quite like Ubuntu.  Win2k just got me to the point of irritation.
2006-10-27T06:26:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	trafaelwyr	Lol - anyway
