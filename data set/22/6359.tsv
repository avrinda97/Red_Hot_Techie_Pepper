2009-11-12T04:14:00.000Z	gasull		Hi.  I'm having problems with sound in Ubuntu 9.10.  I did a fresh install twice, and sounds works in the beginning but stops working at some point.  Only extra packages I've installed are some codecs that Totem asked me to install when I opened an .avi file.  The movie plaid afterwards, but after a reboot I have no sound.  It has happened twice today as I've done a fresh install twice trying to solve the problem.  How can I fix this?  Than
2009-11-12T04:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	Did you install any updates before sound broke?
2009-11-12T04:15:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	Oh, yes.  I did.
2009-11-12T04:16:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	I did the updates with aptitude.  Can I look for something in the logs and revert?
2009-11-12T04:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	First try booting into the oldest kernel
2009-11-12T04:19:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	how?  GRUB doesn't ask me any questions at the startup
2009-11-12T04:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	Hold shift during boot to see the menu
2009-11-12T04:20:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	I only see one vmlinuz-* file in /boot
2009-11-12T04:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	Did you try an older kernel?
2009-11-12T04:43:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	I only have one kernel in /boot
2009-11-12T04:44:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	Only one vmlinuz-* file there.  The one installed by default.
2009-11-12T04:44:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	should I install another kernel?  The sound was working right after the install.
2009-11-12T04:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	Not the quickest way to debug but try reinstalling, then install etckeeper while sound is working ( etckeeper, once setup, will record all changes to files in /etc when you upgrade any package )
2009-11-12T04:46:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	I'll guess I'll do that :-(  Thanks
2009-11-12T04:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	Just quickly, have you tried "alsamixer -c 0" and checked that nothing is muted?
2009-11-12T04:50:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	Just did it now and Master is in green, Headphon has no bar, CD is in green, mic has no bar, beep has no bar, Caller I has no bar, off-hook has no bar, Speaker is in green, iMic has no bar
2009-11-12T04:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	Turn them all up and make sure none have "MM" at the bottom
2009-11-12T04:53:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	No one has MM at the bottom.  I put on green those that I could.  Some of them have no bar.
2009-11-12T07:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	Probably asking for trouble
2009-11-12T07:42:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	I guess this was wishful thinking :)
2009-11-12T07:42:00.000Z	gasull	Jordan_U	thanks
2009-11-12T07:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gasull	np
