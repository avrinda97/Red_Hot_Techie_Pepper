2010-05-02T22:54:00.000Z	vibestriton		Hi, can someone in the room give feedback my problem with black screen in recovery mode discussed above?  something is preventing me from entering commandline
2010-05-02T22:55:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	does the livecd work, did you enable hardware drivers?
2010-05-02T22:56:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	 yes, I believe that's the problem... that i enabled a proprietary ati driver
2010-05-02T22:57:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	what graphic card do you have?
2010-05-02T22:59:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	checking, one moment
2010-05-02T23:00:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	try rescue mode of the livecd to get a shell, or boot rescue mode with vga=normal nomodeset
2010-05-02T23:00:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	you can do that by pressing e instead of enter in grub and adding vga=normal nomodeset to the kernel line
2010-05-02T23:01:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	thanks for the tip.  trying those things now...
2010-05-03T00:25:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	FYI: Problem solved by uninstalling ATI drivers (ATI Mobility Radion HD 3400 Series).  vga=normal nomodeset on installed copy did not work (didn't try liveCD but i assume the live CD would have worked).  Could only boot after first booting Windows XP.  After that I can boot Ubuntu once and before having to boot XP again.  thanks for your help.
2010-05-03T00:27:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	you have to boot XP and restart before loading ubuntu works?
2010-05-03T00:28:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	guess something is wrong with how the gfx card is initialized then
2010-05-03T00:28:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	correct
2010-05-03T00:28:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	its not unlogical then to not be able to reboot ubuntu
2010-05-03T00:28:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	yeah, seems that way
2010-05-03T00:28:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	well it has the same cause in any case, it occurs with the hardware drivers on and off?
2010-05-03T00:29:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	it does not occur when the hardware driver is off.
2010-05-03T00:30:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	seems like there might be a relatively easy fix to get that ati driver working properly.  it would be nice to have 3D acceleration.
2010-05-03T00:31:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	you dont get 3D acceleration with the open source drivers?
2010-05-03T00:31:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	have the hardware drivers ever worked for you?
2010-05-03T00:33:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	 i haven't installed linux on this machine before installing 10.04 last night.   (I assumed that the 3d acceleration was missing from the OS driver but I could definitely be wrong about that)
2010-05-03T00:33:00.000Z	acicula	vibestriton	well you get some basic 3d stuff , i do anyway and i dont use flgrx
2010-05-03T00:34:00.000Z	vibestriton	acicula	right
