2005-11-19T08:10:00.000Z	meheren		anyone no how  to mount a floppy in breezy
2005-11-19T08:10:00.000Z	meheren		mount floppy does not work
2005-11-19T08:10:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	I don't have a floppy drive, but I guess you "sudo mount <floppy-device> <floppy-mount-point>"
2005-11-19T08:12:00.000Z	meheren	dooglus	what should i put for device and mount point?
2005-11-19T08:13:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	you can use any directory you like for the mount point.  maybe /media/floppy would be a good choice.  if it doesn't exist, create it with "sudo mkdir /media/floppy"
2005-11-19T08:13:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	for the device, you need to find which device in /dev/... corresponds to your floppy drive.  I don't know what that would be.  /dev/fda perhaps?  that's a guess
2005-11-19T08:14:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	do you have a directory /dev/floppy/ ?
2005-11-19T08:14:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	what's in it?
2005-11-19T08:16:00.000Z	meheren	dooglus	it says u must specify the  file system type
2005-11-19T08:16:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	I guess /dev/floppy/0 is your floppy device if it exists
2005-11-19T08:17:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	oh, does it?  what if you put a "-t auto" after the "mount" word?
2005-11-19T08:17:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	you get a prompt back, but no output?
2005-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	so it worked...  look in /media/floppy
2005-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	(or wherever you told it to mount to)
2005-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	"sudo umount /media floppy" will un-mount the floppy and let you eject it.  until you unmount it, it's possible that data still needs writing to the disk.  you can corrupt the disk if you eject without unmounting.
2005-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	note that the umount command isn't uNmount
2005-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	meheren	dooglus	nothing is there under floppy0
2005-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	it's odd that you had to specify "-t auto".  The man page for mount says "If no -t option is given, or if  the  auto  type  is  specified, mount will try
2005-11-19T08:22:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	what command did you use to mount the floppy?
2005-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	it should have included the word mount, and the word floppy somewhere in it?
2005-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	dooglus	meheren	and I can't believe that "sudo -t auto" didn't complain a bit about illegal options and stuff?
