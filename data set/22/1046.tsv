2011-04-05T08:02:00.000Z	New0		now i'm with LiveUSB and change the value on GRUB but update-grub can't run why?
2011-04-05T08:03:00.000Z	New0		sudo update-grub /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?).
2011-04-05T08:03:00.000Z	mickster04	New0	did you follow the instructions for repairing grub?
2011-04-05T08:03:00.000Z	mickster04	New0	you can't just edit the file, you have to load the file system as if you are running it already...
