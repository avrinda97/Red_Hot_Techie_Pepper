2011-02-28T12:02:00.000Z	daniel_		hello im having problems getting ubuntu on my ispiron 1300 it keeps saying no bootable devices missing opeating system
2011-02-28T12:02:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	first, go into bios and make sure that it's set to boot from hd...
2011-02-28T12:03:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	and/or usb or cd
2011-02-28T12:03:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Secondly, how did you put the install files on the thumb drive?
2011-02-28T12:04:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Ok, strange, then, but then do have a look in the bios and make sure that it can boot from usb
2011-02-28T12:06:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	it has on the list of boot sequences it has 1 usb storage device 2 cd dvd cdrw drive 3 internal hdd 4 onbouard nic 5 diskette drive
2011-02-28T12:07:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Strange that it doesn't boot from the thumb drive, then. You *are* sure that you used the startup disk creator?
2011-02-28T12:08:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	yes i just remforated it and now im about to redo the process
2011-02-28T12:09:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Do report back then. I'm not sure what else can cause it :-(
2011-02-28T12:10:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	have any idea why the cd keeps showing up blank after i use the instrutions and it says success on the program i write it with
2011-02-28T12:10:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Not really, I'm afraid. Sounds weird as well...
2011-02-28T12:11:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	u think the comp is just &*(*(& up or is there a way to do it?
2011-02-28T12:13:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	There is always a way, but it would be hard for me to assist without being there physically :-(
2011-02-28T12:13:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Also, I need to get ready for uni soon...
2011-02-28T12:13:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	i have team viewer 6
2011-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Wouldn't do much good for bios settings and boot, would it?
2011-02-28T12:15:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	well it would let u make the startupdisc with this computer
2011-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Well, I wonder why it didn't work in the first place, but the program has a limited set of options, so I don't think that'll make a lot of difference
2011-02-28T12:17:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	well thanks for helping :D \
2011-02-28T12:17:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Np and good luck
2011-02-28T12:18:00.000Z	daniel_	Fjodor	omg i got it to work i used a diff thumb drive maybe the other one just was bad idk why though i still use it to hold movies and wacth them on my xbox
2011-02-28T12:19:00.000Z	Fjodor	daniel_	Good to hear! But perhaps you should look into retiring it ;-)
