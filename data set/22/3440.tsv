2010-01-17T06:05:00.000Z	teadict		any idea of why an ASUS Eee 1201n keyboard doesn't respond on 9.10 booted from an USB source?
2010-01-17T06:06:00.000Z	dotblank	teadict	can you rephrase the question it was a bit confusing?
2010-01-17T06:08:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	I booted Ubuntu 9.10 on my new ASUS Eee 1201n using a pendrive (which holds the OS image) and the keyboard doesn't work
2010-01-17T06:09:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	haven't done much testing yet but I'm pretty desoriented anyway
2010-01-17T06:09:00.000Z	dotblank	teadict	hmm... it may have to do with the usb controller..
2010-01-17T06:09:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	I've doubted about the live cd being booted from USB too
2010-01-17T06:09:00.000Z	dotblank	teadict	have to tried to enable ps/2 emulation in the bios?
2010-01-17T06:09:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	how would that help?
2010-01-17T06:10:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	oh
2010-01-17T06:10:00.000Z	dotblank	teadict	it would make your mouse and keyboard act like they are not usb devices
2010-01-17T06:10:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	wait, no..
2010-01-17T06:10:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	the USB device is the pendrive, from which I'm booting karmic
2010-01-17T06:10:00.000Z	dotblank	teadict	does it actually boot karmic
2010-01-17T06:10:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	the keyboard not working is the one of my netbook asus 1201n
2010-01-17T06:10:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	yes it does
2010-01-17T06:11:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	the only thing not working is the netbook's keyboard
2010-01-17T06:11:00.000Z	dotblank	teadict	does it let you use the keyboard during the boot loader?
2010-01-17T06:11:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	didn't try that.. but wait.. right now stupid W7 is applying some updates, I'll ping you when I'm rebooting
2010-01-17T06:12:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	I'll see if keyboard respond before launching X when I'm there
2010-01-17T06:21:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	I tried the famous acpi=off nolapic and the keyboard is working, lulz
2010-01-17T06:22:00.000Z	dotblank	teadict	lulz indead
2010-01-17T06:22:00.000Z	teadict	dotblank	works for live, once installed I can be sure of what it is (if it still doesn't work without the arguments)
