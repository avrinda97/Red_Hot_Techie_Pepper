2010-06-21T23:24:00.000Z	trupheenix		hi i need help. i want to prevent certain processes from starting up during system boot.
2010-06-21T23:25:00.000Z	trupheenix		how do i control what processes should be run at boot time?
2010-06-21T23:26:00.000Z	trupheenix		i don't want to start processes like apache and mysqld on boot up
2010-06-21T23:26:00.000Z	trupheenix		so how do i stop that?
2010-06-21T23:26:00.000Z	askhader	trupheenix	Do you need apache and mysql?
2010-06-21T23:27:00.000Z	trupheenix	askhader	no i don't need them. i want to start them manually when i require them.

2010-06-21T23:30:00.000Z	askhader	trupheenix	Is there a link to mysql.server in /etc/rc2.d ?

2010-06-21T23:32:00.000Z	askhader	trupheenix	I'm asking if there is a symolbic link to mysql in your /etc/rc2.d

2010-06-21T23:34:00.000Z	trupheenix	askhader	but this is not the right way to remove it
2010-06-21T23:34:00.000Z	askhader	trupheenix	This is why it is being started up at bot.
