2009-02-07T04:14:00.000Z	perillux		I'm trying to buy ram.  But I'm not sure what to get.  I see 4GB of DDR2 ram and it says "Memory Speed:  800MHz PC6400"  "Memory CAS Latency:Â  5-4-4-15"    Then I see only 2GB of ram but it has  "Memory Speed:  2000MHz PC16000"  "Memory CAS Latency:  9-9-9-28"    I have no idea how to compare them, should I go with the more expensive 2GB one or the cheaper 4GB?  I also don't mind buying 2 of the 2GB one so I'd like to know if I would be ab
2009-02-07T04:14:00.000Z	perillux		also the 2GB ram is DDR3
2009-02-07T04:16:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	PC2-6400 or DDR2 800 is what you need
2009-02-07T04:16:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	if thats what your motherboard says
2009-02-07T04:16:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	if not, then go by what your motherboard says
2009-02-07T04:17:00.000Z	perillux	mjc	I'm building a computer so I havn't chosen a motherboard yet.  I'm going to decide on that after I have all other components so I make sure it works.  I'm not concerned with money, I want the best possible ram, around 4-6GB
2009-02-07T04:17:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	you need to find out what motherboard you want first.
2009-02-07T04:18:00.000Z	perillux	mjc	but that would limit my choices
2009-02-07T04:18:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	that is exactly the point
2009-02-07T04:18:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	I would suggest waiting until core i7 mainboards are a little cheaper anyway
2009-02-07T04:19:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	the point is that your motherboard and CPU combination determine which RAM you need
2009-02-07T04:20:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	if you get a triple channel board and a core i7, then you must install exactly 3,6 or 9 sticks
2009-02-07T04:20:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	if you get a dual channel board hten you need to install them in pairs
2009-02-07T04:20:00.000Z	perillux	mjc	the motherboard will specify that stuff right?
2009-02-07T04:20:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	if you get DDR2 motherboard then you need DDR2, if you get a DDR3 motherboard you need DDR3
2009-02-07T04:20:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	yes
2009-02-07T04:21:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	anandtech.com, tomshardware generally have competent reviews of mainboards, processors, memory, etc.
2009-02-07T04:21:00.000Z	mjc		doh
2009-02-07T04:21:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	there's even a core i7 buyers guide on the front page of anandtech
2009-02-07T04:22:00.000Z	perillux	mjc	is ram speed really that important?  I see some that are like 800mhz and others that are a lot higher  1600-2000?  should I shoot for a higher speed?  Also I want lower cas, but what do the numbers mean?  9-9-9-28 for example.    and thanks for all the help I'll check out anandtech now.
2009-02-07T04:23:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	CAS is pretty much pointless to worry about for 99.999% of the population.
2009-02-07T04:23:00.000Z	mjc	perillux	just pick a mainboard based on the guides at places like tomshardware or anandteech and it will tell you what kind of RAM you need
