2010-03-11T23:48:00.000Z	Athar	rabbit1	have you tried to use a different player?
2010-03-11T23:49:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	s, it works, also in same application VLC, audio works, video works, but not the .mov format
2010-03-11T23:50:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	u still there?
2010-03-11T23:53:00.000Z	Athar	rabbit1	ah, sorry. Never had the problem, so I don't know... but I would suggest trying to try the Karmic Live CD to see if it's fixed now.
2010-03-11T23:54:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	its ok, i am planning to get to 10.04 from 8.04
2010-03-11T23:55:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	one person asked me to kill something after that it worked fine, but again after restart, its with same prob
2010-03-11T23:56:00.000Z	Athar	rabbit1	PulseAudio, maybe?
2010-03-11T23:56:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	whts that?
2010-03-11T23:58:00.000Z	Athar	rabbit1	PulseAudio is the sound server, I figured that was the application you killed... but does sound play at all? Or does it just cause high CPU usage?
2010-03-11T23:59:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	sound plays, all other files are played in VLC and amarok, only the .mov extension file is not played in VLC, it says audio device is busy, used by other program?
2010-03-12T00:01:00.000Z	Athar	rabbit1	what about mplayer, can it play mov files?
2010-03-12T00:01:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	sorry i don use it as it wont play .mp3, will just check
2010-03-12T00:03:00.000Z	rabbit1	Athar	sorry by default it was opening in MPlayer, i actually had set to VLC
