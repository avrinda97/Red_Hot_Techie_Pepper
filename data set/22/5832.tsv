2007-02-16T17:57:00.000Z	desres		im not entirely sure what it is
2007-02-16T17:57:00.000Z	desres		kupesoft; i think its a broadcom
2007-02-16T17:58:00.000Z	desres		I am still running XP right now, but if I could be sure that my card would work with it, I would switch.
2007-02-16T17:58:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Does it work with the live CD?
2007-02-16T17:59:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	You mean it was detected by Ubuntu?
2007-02-16T17:59:00.000Z	desres	kupesoft	it was not detected.
2007-02-16T17:59:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Alright, is there any way to find the make/model of the card?
2007-02-16T06:00:00.000Z	desres	kupesoft	its internal, so i can't look at it. I know its a broadcom, and I can try looking for more about it, but i could'nt find it before
2007-02-16T06:00:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Well, we could find out if you could boot Ubuntu )=
2007-02-16T06:00:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	"lspci" should tell you the cards chipset
2007-02-16T06:01:00.000Z	desres	kupesoft	I can boot ubuntu, but I couldn' t talk to you then. And how would I use "lspci"
2007-02-16T06:02:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	You'd type it in the console and look for what you think is your wireless card,
2007-02-16T06:02:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Maybe your motherboard model / make will tell you something about the card,
2007-02-16T06:02:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Alternatively you could try ndiswrapper,
2007-02-16T06:05:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	I fail to see the connection between you being new to Linux/Ubuntu translating to you being an idiot.
2007-02-16T06:05:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Is there any way you can hard wire your computer to the internet while you run Ubuntu?
2007-02-16T06:06:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Self-deprecation and humility are far from the same ;/
2007-02-16T06:07:00.000Z	desres	kupesoft	I've always treated depracation and humility as one and the same
2007-02-16T06:07:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Well, you'd have an Ubuntu system connected to the Internet,
2007-02-16T06:07:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	It'd be far easy to troubleshoot,
2007-02-16T06:09:00.000Z	kupesoft	desres	Feel free to pm when you get back
2007-02-16T08:20:00.000Z	desres	kupesoft	are you still around?
