2007-06-04T15:34:00.000Z	mbdv76		anyone here i can have private IM to help me with a big problem with ubuntu networking as a whole
2007-06-04T15:34:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	nope, keep it public
2007-06-04T15:35:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	did you follow any sort of howto?
2007-06-04T15:37:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	can you firefox at all?
2007-06-04T15:38:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	that's pretty silly, the whole point of running linux is to *learn* how to use it so you can... use it ;)
2007-06-04T15:38:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	and yet, you're here on irc. what gives? :P
2007-06-04T15:50:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	why?
2007-06-04T15:51:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	how is your network setup, physically?
2007-06-04T15:52:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	so the laptop is the internet-connected system?
2007-06-04T15:52:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	running what OS?
2007-06-04T15:52:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	did you setup network sharing and a dhcp server on it?
2007-06-04T15:53:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	and are they currently running and configured properly? do you have some sort of firewall application on the xp system that may have blocked something?
2007-06-04T15:54:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	but have you *checked* the firewall on the xp?
2007-06-04T15:54:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	ok, so that means you can ping the laptop from the ubuntu and ping the ubuntu from the laptop successfully?
2007-06-04T15:56:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	check firefox settings, do you have a proxy setup?
2007-06-04T15:58:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	what Samji said

2007-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	cat /etc/resolv.conf  <-- what's there?
2007-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	Gnea	mbdv76	how many default gateways do you have set?  ip r  <-- that should list them
