2006-08-15T12:59:00.000Z	heeeelp		hi, can someone help me find the root of a DMA issue?  I have to put in linux ide=nodma to fix the "mounting root filesystem" hang, and then I have to use sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/hda after the boot to re-enable it or my os is extremely slow!  Can someone please help me fix this?  I'm a linux newb-  so PLEASE PLEASE explain in a way I can understand.  I've used xp my whole life.
2006-08-15T13:00:00.000Z	heeeelp		Oh, I was seeing if someone else would remotely attempt to give tech support.
2006-08-15T13:00:00.000Z	heeeelp		seen it-  tried it
2006-08-15T13:01:00.000Z	heeeelp		they have it on DMA but they dont have it on my support problem
2006-08-15T13:01:00.000Z	heeeelp		if they did...I wouldn't be in here lol!
2006-08-15T13:01:00.000Z	heeeelp		argument I did
2006-08-15T13:02:00.000Z	heeeelp		It would seem so, by the sound of the "official ubuntu support channel"
2006-08-15T13:04:00.000Z	heeeelp		Argument, its a gui based os.  I shouldn't need to know that stuff lol;  and yes, I've heard your schpeel.
2006-08-15T13:04:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	have you thought of using hdparm.conf to re-enable the drives dma?
2006-08-15T13:05:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	enable the service and you can enable dma for devices at boot
2006-08-15T13:13:00.000Z	heeeelp	NemesisUK	 I have been using the hdparm command to enable it (DMA) manually on bootup...was that what you were referring to?
2006-08-15T13:14:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	you can set hdparm to start at boot and setup dma on your drives using hdparm.conf you'll find it in /etc. you then set hdparm to start at boot
2006-08-15T13:16:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	 just type man hdparm.conf in a terminal
2006-08-15T13:19:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	pm me mate
2006-08-15T13:28:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	this is what you want http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-16360.html
2006-08-15T14:05:00.000Z	heeeelp	NemesisUK	what were you referring to with the 'session' screen?!?
2006-08-15T14:06:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	doesnt matter would mean creating a script and the link i sent you is simpler
2006-08-15T14:23:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	sounds like a bios issue or maybe the mobo, check for a newer bios
2006-08-15T14:24:00.000Z	heeeelp	NemesisUK	 I dont think the RS480 Bios is supported anymore, is it??  I've googled the shit out of it
2006-08-15T14:24:00.000Z	NemesisUK	heeeelp	got a full mobo model name and number
2006-08-15T14:28:00.000Z	heeeelp	NemesisUK	RS480-M Rev: 1
