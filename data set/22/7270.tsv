2008-12-20T17:43:00.000Z	Winkie		intrepid works surprisingly well on my new tablet
2008-12-20T17:43:00.000Z	Winkie		only 2 or 3 things don't really work
2008-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	Winkie		i should say, it works for me and i have a pretty offensively annoying chipset
2008-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	Winkie		but i set up my own pulse/default.pa
2008-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	Winkie		that seemed to work a while ago
2008-12-20T17:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Winkie	doesn't work now, that's why I switched back to Gutsy
2008-12-20T17:43:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	i was about to praise the opposite :)
2008-12-20T17:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Winkie	Intrepid hasn't got usable audio support
2008-12-20T17:43:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	it works for me, but i don't deny there are problems
2008-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Winkie	pulseaudio just runs around making a mess of things
2008-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	honestly, it can work with a small amount of work
2008-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	i was sat on my bed last night watching a tv show over wifi while streaming music to my main computer through pulseaudio
2008-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	stop it starting?
2008-12-20T17:45:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	fair enough, may I ask why you don't want pulseaudio?
2008-12-20T17:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Winkie	because it gets in the way of jack
2008-12-20T17:45:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	ah that's understandable, i have little experience with jack
2008-12-20T17:46:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	set up a pulse default.pa so it does not clobber your alsa devices, get it to hook into JACK
2008-12-20T17:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Winkie	tried that, but it's too slow going through pulseaudio
2008-12-20T17:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Winkie	I want same-day service from my sound card
2008-12-20T17:47:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	I can't make any guarantees, but pulseaudio should not slow down your sound by any apprecible amount
2008-12-20T17:47:00.000Z	Winkie	gordonjcp	i don't know enough about jack or your setup to be able to help you though
2008-12-20T17:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Winkie	well it's got unacceptable latency, that's the thing
