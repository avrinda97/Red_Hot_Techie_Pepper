2007-04-26T15:32:00.000Z	JJNova		Alright, I can't seem to find an answer to this at all. After updating to Feisty, I haven't been able to send emails through SMTP. Either using Evolution or Thunderbird
2007-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	using what as your smtp server ?
2007-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	you didn't answer my question - exim locally? your isp's smarthost, or what ?
2007-04-26T15:34:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	 ok; upgrading to feisty shouldnt break that unless you configured some kind of firewall. Try ecks solution
2007-04-26T15:34:00.000Z	JJNova	linxeh	 My websites and a free POP
2007-04-26T15:35:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	what have websites got to do with SMTP ?
2007-04-26T15:35:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	telnet SMTPHOST 25
2007-04-26T15:35:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	and then type in:     EHLO foo.bar
2007-04-26T15:36:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	oh come on, think .. ?
2007-04-26T15:36:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	telnet smtp.myisp.com 25
2007-04-26T15:37:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	note the space between the hostname and 25
2007-04-26T15:38:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	if it connects you should get a line back from the server which starts with 220 - eg I get  "220 asmtp-out1.blueyonder.co.uk ESMTP Thu, 26 Apr 2007 22:37:34 +0100"
2007-04-26T15:38:00.000Z	JJNova	linxeh	 I'm not getting anything. It's still trying...
2007-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	JJNova	linxeh	 Telnet isn't getting a response
2007-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	and you put the " 25" on the end ?
2007-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	what do you get with iptables -L ?
2007-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	JJNova	linxeh	 telnet mail.gamecootie.com 25
2007-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	JJNova	linxeh	 Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
2007-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	ok, so nothing wrong there then. I can connect to that server on port 25 from here, so I'm at a loss as to why you cannot connect
2007-04-26T16:00:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	can you connect to smtp.blueyonder.co.uk ?
2007-04-26T16:00:00.000Z	linxeh	JJNova	ah I see
2007-04-26T16:01:00.000Z	JJNova	linxeh	 No
