2006-05-15T08:20:00.000Z	diederick_		I forwarded port A to a computer in my local network. I can access a computer in my local network using its local ip, but not using the 'outgoing' internet IP. Any suggestions?
2006-05-15T08:21:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	a lot of times a router won't route out and right back in to the network
2006-05-15T08:21:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	i run into it all the time on many different forms of routers
2006-05-15T08:21:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	is there a way to fix this?
2006-05-15T08:22:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	it's router behavior, it won't send the packets out on the same interface it recieved them on
2006-05-15T08:22:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	it would send it on to the next router, but it is the destination
2006-05-15T08:23:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	it's just how routing works.
2006-05-15T08:23:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	so It receives tham on ip A which is the internet ip and must send them to ip B
2006-05-15T08:23:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	forwards don't take effect from the internal interfaces.
2006-05-15T08:23:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	what do you mean with that?
2006-05-15T08:26:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	now, i have problems if i try to go to my web site from inside, because it goes to the firewall and doesn't forward, so i just use a hosts entry to make it go to the right internal ip rather than the one that DNS provides
2006-05-15T08:26:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	so is there another way to check my networked application?
2006-05-15T08:27:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	you could connect to an outside computer and try to connect in
2006-05-15T08:28:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	yeah I thought the same.. and that does indeed work.. BUT
2006-05-15T08:29:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	as in to localhost?
2006-05-15T08:29:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	if it's connecting to another machine on the internal network, tell it to connect to the internal ip.
2006-05-15T08:30:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	no. I've uploaded my flash movie to A, than I load the swf using my browser. The swf makes a connection to my internal xml server.
2006-05-15T08:30:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	and therfore I probably can't connect to it
2006-05-15T08:31:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	as i said, try connecting to an outside machine w/ remote desktop or vnc, and connect back in
2006-05-15T08:32:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	yes thanx
2006-05-15T08:33:00.000Z	paradizelost	diederick_	other than that, i don't think your going to accomplish what you want...
2006-05-15T08:35:00.000Z	diederick_	paradizelost	thanx!
