2008-05-05T16:51:00.000Z	noob-africa_		hi all
2008-05-05T16:52:00.000Z	noob-africa_		i have a serious problem with my hardy file system... i need help
2008-05-05T16:52:00.000Z	noob-africa_		x server wont start and file system is in read only mode
2008-05-05T16:52:00.000Z	noob-africa_		it basically refuses to boot...
2008-05-05T16:53:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	do you get a command prompt?
2008-05-05T16:53:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	yes, i get in root
2008-05-05T16:53:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	all bash commands are not recognised
2008-05-05T16:53:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	but it seems like you have a major problem that needs fixing
2008-05-05T16:54:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	remount should be recognized.
2008-05-05T16:57:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	---> bash: remount: command not found
2008-05-05T16:58:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	still there?
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	mount -o remount,rw
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	i tried --> fsck -p <-- output was --> fsck 1.40.8 (13-Mar-2009) /dev/sda1 contains a file system with errors, check forced.
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	your hard drive could be messed up
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	but mount was the correct command not remount
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	i realise that...
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	am trying again...
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	asdrubal	noob-africa_	k
2008-05-05T17:07:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	i ran the "mount -o remount,rw / " command, and pressed ctrl-d to reboot... it is rebooting but it is claiming "Unclean shutdown, checking drives /dev/sda1"
2008-05-05T17:08:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	now i have error --> UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY (i.e. without -a or -p options)
2008-05-05T17:09:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	am running that command now... Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
2008-05-05T17:13:00.000Z	noob-africa_	asdrubal	i am back on track, but i have a new problem
