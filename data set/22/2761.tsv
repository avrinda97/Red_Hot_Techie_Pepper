2010-05-14T16:48:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	acicula	when I wakeup from sleep or suspend my laptop, the mouse pointer / cursor goes away.  The only way to get back is going to CLI mode and coming back to GUI mode.

2010-05-14T16:48:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	acicula	Dell Inspiron 1501
2010-05-14T16:50:00.000Z	acicula	ShawnRisk	is it also missing when you boot, ie when the login page is loaded?

2010-05-14T16:52:00.000Z	acicula	ShawnRisk	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/563555 seems like a known bug
2010-05-14T16:52:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	acicula	I should wait for the bug to be fixed?  I don't think I can wait that long
2010-05-14T16:52:00.000Z	acicula	ShawnRisk	test it if it applies there too and add to the BR?
2010-05-14T16:53:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	acicula	BR?

2010-05-14T16:54:00.000Z	acicula	ShawnRisk	well the problem seems to emerge every now and then judging by google, with setting an option on SHMconfig, but how this is set is changed these days
2010-05-14T16:56:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	acicula	there isn't other channels I can go to that might be able to help?
