2004-11-21T16:27:00.000Z	z0mbi3		anyone got any success plugging an iPod to a x86 ubuntu system?
2004-11-21T16:27:00.000Z	nimc	z0mbi3	i was going to try it soon..... you tried and it didnt work?
2004-11-21T16:29:00.000Z	z0mbi3		well, it does work.....when it wants to :p
2004-11-21T16:30:00.000Z	nimc	z0mbi3	elaborate...?:)
2004-11-21T16:30:00.000Z	z0mbi3		I had to rebuild rhythmbox with the --with-ipod option in configure, but I'm having trouble mounting the ipod
2004-11-21T16:30:00.000Z	z0mbi3		the modules sometime work, other thimes don't work
2004-11-21T16:30:00.000Z	z0mbi3		grunf!
2004-11-21T16:31:00.000Z	z0mbi3		If I reboot, probably it will fix, until I unmount the ipod again.....
2004-11-21T16:31:00.000Z	nimc		u use rhythmbox as an itunes clone? not something like gtkpod ?
2004-11-21T16:31:00.000Z	z0mbi3		I use it just to access my music on the iPod, my other computer is an iBook running MacOS X, so I'm actually using iTunes to fill the iPod up
2004-11-21T16:32:00.000Z	nimc		ok
2004-11-21T16:32:00.000Z	z0mbi3		to disconnect the iPod I must umount /mnt/ipod then rmmod sbp2
2004-11-21T16:33:00.000Z	z0mbi3		If I reboot without disconnecting the iPod I'll have troubles after reconnecting it.....AFAIK this has been it's Modus Operandi
2004-11-21T16:34:00.000Z	z0mbi3		my problems with rebooting (other than having to lose a bit os uptime) is that sometimes the machine doesn't boot....
2004-11-21T16:34:00.000Z	z0mbi3		it freezes while running the hotplug init script
2004-11-21T16:35:00.000Z	z0mbi3		after giving me a FATAL: hw_random module error (can't recall the actual text)
2004-11-21T16:36:00.000Z	nimc	z0mbi3	i'll try it a little later and tell u what i get if you're still here.... which instructions should i follow to install the ipod stuff? link?
2004-11-21T16:36:00.000Z	z0mbi3	nimc	just a sec
2004-11-21T16:36:00.000Z	z0mbi3		let me look for them
