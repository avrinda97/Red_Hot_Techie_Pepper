2009-12-22T02:53:00.000Z	Baxnie		i've installed ubuntu 9.10 now, from windows using wubi. i reboot and completed the installation. but when i'm going to start linux, it stops at grub and i dont know how to boot linux
2009-12-22T02:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	ok well just remove Wubi then, real partitions are better in the long run :)
2009-12-22T02:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	also Wubi can go odd on people
2009-12-22T02:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	also more people know how to get hold of data and such, from real partitions, rather than a Wubi install
2009-12-22T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	first remove Wubi
2009-12-22T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	you also need to download the Live CD  ISO  which is also used for install
2009-12-22T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	you can remove Wubi like a normal Windows program
2009-12-22T02:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	the contents of the ISO, but first it's a good idea to check your ISO to make sure you have a good one
2009-12-22T02:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	yes
2009-12-22T02:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	ok so you already have an ISO for Ubuntu?
2009-12-22T02:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	right, but that's after you installed it using Wubi?
2009-12-22T02:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	you were in Windows put your CD in and used Wubi to install?
2009-12-22T03:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	oh ok, well there is a much easier way to get the Wubi installer
2009-12-22T03:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	however you got the ISO ok good,  you need to burn the contents to a CD, so you can install a proper install,  but before you do that, you should remove Wubi
2009-12-22T03:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	hmm
2009-12-22T03:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	what about a data DVD?
2009-12-22T03:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	this is how to install Ubuntu  the easy and good way, from a CD or DVD
2009-12-22T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	You can also install from a USB Flash stick if you have one big enough and that, but those can be a bit difficult to make or something,   Plus there's that netinstall which isn't really for new users.
2009-12-22T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	don't use Wubi
2009-12-22T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	no CD's and no DVD's ok
2009-12-22T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	you need to make "real partitions" on your hard disk,  for a proper install of Ubuntu
2009-12-22T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Baxnie	Wubi does not do that for you,  a Wubi install that works can be converted to real partitions though
