2007-04-23T16:08:00.000Z	robbie		I cannot for the life of me get ssh functioning properly anymore. It worked fine under edgy. I read the feisty how to, and it's still not working. Port 22 is forwarded properly in my router. I can't connect on my lan, or externally, through putty on windows. I keep getting connection timed out errors. sshd is definitely running,
2007-04-23T16:10:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	Do sudo iptables -vL && sudo iptables -nVL and tell me if there is anything listed under OUTPUT, FORWARD, INPUT, etc.
2007-04-23T16:10:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	You might have installed a firewall (iptables) script by mistake
2007-04-23T16:11:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	dpkg
2007-04-23T16:11:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	 Nope, all blank
2007-04-23T16:11:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	Go on the Ubuntu box and do ssh 127.0.0.1, see it that works
2007-04-23T16:12:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	Yeah I can ssh to localhost
2007-04-23T16:13:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	Check your sshd.conf file
2007-04-23T16:13:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	thanks, now I know the problem isn't on here. Should've thought of that
2007-04-23T16:13:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	/etc/sshd.conf?
2007-04-23T16:14:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	/etc/ssh/sshd_config on Ubuntu
2007-04-23T16:14:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	thanks
2007-04-23T16:14:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	I found Ubuntu had good comments, and I seem to remember sshd support outside localhost might have been turned off, depending on which sshd daemon you are using
2007-04-23T16:15:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	yeah, it's nicely written. Thanks a lot for the pointer, I'll get back to you if I figure out what's b0rkd
2007-04-23T16:16:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	Check the ListenAddress to start out with maybe
2007-04-23T16:25:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	yeah, that's blank, so I don't know if I can just add *.*.*.* to it or if I need to define a range or specific ip or what.
2007-04-23T16:25:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	Mine is commented out, so that should be fine
2007-04-23T16:26:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	Default is to listen to all addresses
2007-04-23T16:27:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	yeah, still getting connection timed out on the lan, and No Route To Host when I try to come in remotely now
2007-04-23T16:28:00.000Z	GenNMX	robbie	You can ping your Ubuntu box from within the lan, right?
2007-04-23T16:29:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	I could until just now :/
2007-04-23T16:37:00.000Z	robbie	GenNMX	well now my ubuntu box isn't responding to pings from my windows box, but my windows box is responding to pings from my ubuntu box, so I'm assuming that the problem is actually with my windows box or my router, rather than with my ssh setup
