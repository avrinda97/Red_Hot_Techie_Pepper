2007-12-18T04:52:00.000Z	zmitya		hi all
2007-12-18T04:52:00.000Z	zmitya		how can I bind slapd only to localhost ?
2007-12-18T04:52:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	apt-get it
2007-12-18T04:53:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	hmm, I have installed it, but it binds 0.0.0.0 by default
2007-12-18T04:53:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	ok, change the config
2007-12-18T04:53:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	great, but what should I change ?
2007-12-18T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	bind and/or interface
2007-12-18T04:54:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	what config file are you looking at
2007-12-18T04:55:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	slapd.conf
2007-12-18T04:57:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	so, do you have any idea ?
2007-12-18T04:57:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	you need to use either interface or bind
2007-12-18T04:57:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	I don't have an example to hand
2007-12-18T04:57:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	ok thx, but there is no option like that
2007-12-18T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	you have to put it in yourself
2007-12-18T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	the config file shipped is an example, not a full file
2007-12-18T04:58:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	ok, but I can't find what should I put there, thats my problem
2007-12-18T04:59:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	first result in google
2007-12-18T05:00:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	ok, I knew that I can give it in as command line parameter
2007-12-18T05:00:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	the point is the info is out there
2007-12-18T05:01:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	thanks anyway, going to hack it into the /etc/init.d/slapd
2007-12-18T05:02:00.000Z	zmitya	ikonia	are you a bot ? :) you are really multitasked :)
2007-12-18T05:02:00.000Z	ikonia	zmitya	I multitask
