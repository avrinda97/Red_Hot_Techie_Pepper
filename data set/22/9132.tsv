2005-02-23T17:54:00.000Z	ebone		Has anyone heard of MEPHIS ?
2005-02-23T17:56:00.000Z	ebone		it doesn't look as popular as ubuntu though.
2005-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	ebone		ahh ...
2005-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	ebone		i think i might give this ubuntu a shot ...
2005-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	ebone		i've been using debian for a few years, but am a little tired with it being so conservative.
2005-02-23T17:59:00.000Z	ebone		i thought about gentoo .... but i already know apt-get/dpkg management system.
2005-02-23T17:59:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	:) both portage and apt rock
2005-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	depends on what you mean by unstable
2005-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	ebone	randabis	that's what I'm trying to figure out     :)
2005-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	what is "stable" to you?
2005-02-23T06:03:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	it means that packages change often, a lot of times daily
2005-02-23T06:06:00.000Z	ebone	randabis	will most apps run "smoothly" with warty ?
2005-02-23T06:06:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	sure, but they are old
2005-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	hoary is very smooth imho...I have it on 3 systems without a hitch
2005-02-23T06:08:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	the most problems you'll have is with software in universe, but it isn't that bad
2005-02-23T06:09:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	to an extent probably so
2005-02-23T06:13:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	it's just a demonstation cd..you can't install with it
2005-02-23T07:12:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	you'll need to resize your partition before the install
2005-02-23T07:12:00.000Z	ebone	randabis	thanks ...   :)    no prob.
2005-02-23T08:57:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	synaptic has a category listing
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	randabis	ebone	yes, but BE CAREFUL
2005-02-28T07:08:00.000Z	ebone	randabis	good idea ...
