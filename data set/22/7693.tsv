2006-11-23T17:50:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	what ubuntu release, 64 bit or 32 bit?
2006-11-23T17:51:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	How do I check that?
2006-11-23T17:52:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	I installed from the desktop cd
2006-11-23T17:54:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	when did you download the installer?
2006-11-23T17:55:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	I installed through apt-get.
2006-11-23T17:55:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	I also uninstalled and installed again with apt-get or aptitude once, and now i'm having the problem again.
2006-11-23T17:55:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	you mean you upgraded to the latest ubuntu using apt-get dist-upgrade?
2006-11-23T17:55:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	 No. I'm talking about firefox.
2006-11-23T17:55:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	I installed Ubuntu Edgy Eft through the desktop cd.
2006-11-23T17:56:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	thats what i was wondering, okay.
2006-11-23T17:56:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	what plugins do you have for it and what extensions do you have?
2006-11-23T17:56:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	Nothing that isn't default.
2006-11-23T17:57:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	okay have you tried deleting .mozilla from your home directory and restarting ff?
2006-11-23T17:58:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	Will renaming it work? ;-)
2006-11-23T06:00:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	Still getting a core dump
2006-11-23T06:01:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	okay for that i would fill out the bugtracker thing that you might get ... for now try to download and use either mozilla, epiphany, opera or konqueror for web browsing
2006-11-23T06:01:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	i'm sorry but the standard regular configuration level fixes don't seem to be working for you, sounds like a bigger issue
2006-11-23T06:02:00.000Z	Keyseir	holycow	Thanks for your assistance
2006-11-23T06:02:00.000Z	holycow	Keyseir	no problem, helping out this community helps me  by making it stronger
