2005-12-26T12:39:00.000Z	mh166		What can I do if ./configure tells me that "/lib/cpp" failed the sanity check?
2005-12-26T12:39:00.000Z	mh166		http://upload.webdev-solutions.de/auto/error
2005-12-26T12:40:00.000Z	mh166		is this a package I can get using apt-get or what do you mean?
2005-12-26T12:41:00.000Z	mh166		k thx. I'll try it out
2005-12-26T12:41:00.000Z	mh166		another question: is therre any ICQ command line client?
2005-12-26T12:42:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	check out centericq
2005-12-26T12:43:00.000Z	mh166		thx
2005-12-26T12:43:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	or bitlbee on testing.bitlbee.net if you like irc and want icq and msn in your ircprogram
2005-12-26T12:43:00.000Z	mh166	LoppApan	n1. guess I'll try this first :)
2005-12-26T12:43:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	well. ok
2005-12-26T12:44:00.000Z	mh166		and a last q: how can I create a runlevel where multi user mode is activated but just console. and more than just 1 console as it is the case in level 1
2005-12-26T12:45:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	why not just stop gdm from starting?
2005-12-26T12:45:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	that would give you that effect
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	mh166	LoppApan	how? sry I just changed from SuSE to Ubuntu (SuSE was too much like a wizzard ;)
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	apt-get install rcconf
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	then run rcconf and remove gdm
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	mh166	LoppApan	thx for your help :)
2005-12-26T12:46:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	that's an easy way to remove gdm from starting up
2005-12-26T12:47:00.000Z	mh166		I'll try it out now. cu
2005-12-26T12:47:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	but, U could also install ubuntu server and don't get X if that's what you want
2005-12-26T12:47:00.000Z	LoppApan	mh166	good luck
