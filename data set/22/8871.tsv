2006-01-23T07:28:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	hi
2006-01-23T07:28:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	really?
2006-01-23T07:29:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	how'd you do it?
2006-01-23T07:29:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	i know what you mean
2006-01-23T07:29:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	everything running alright?
2006-01-23T07:41:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	what's wrong?
2006-01-23T07:42:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	you want it to be the official icon?
2006-01-23T07:42:00.000Z	n00b	cyphase	yeah
2006-01-23T07:42:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	one second
2006-01-23T07:45:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	as long as the name is in the message
2006-01-23T07:45:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	doesn't have to be in that format
2006-01-23T07:46:00.000Z	n00b	cyphase	okay, thankyou
2006-01-23T07:46:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	and the whole message, not just name
2006-01-23T07:46:00.000Z	n00b	cyphase	got ya... would you still have a solution for that firefox issue :P
2006-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	download the firefox icon and set it as the icon in the menu editor
2006-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	n00b	cyphase	menu editor, firefox icon? all i got so far is the firefox icon from the installation. I don't know what a menu editor is...
2006-01-23T07:49:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	Applications -> System Tools -> Applications Menu Editor
2006-01-23T07:50:00.000Z	n00b	cyphase	that's for the menu though... i need the solution for the actual program. When it runs, the browser window has some crappy icon rather than the firefox symbol.
2006-01-23T07:50:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	oh
2006-01-23T07:51:00.000Z	cyphase	n00b	that's significantly harder
2006-01-23T07:51:00.000Z	n00b	cyphase	i thought so. Firefox had a solution on their website... but that doesn't seem to work.
