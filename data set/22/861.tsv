2011-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	Roofle		Anyone have any suggestions for why an ubuntu box would take 1 min+ to accept a correct password from the command line?
2011-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	Is the hard disk spinning a lot?
2011-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	Roofle		no more than normal as far as I can tell
2011-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	What about CPU?
2011-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	Roofle		it will reject an incorrect password almost immediately
2011-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	Roofle		but if it's a correct one, it will take a solid minute
2011-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	Roofle		cpu is normal too, less than 5%
2011-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	hmm... It's probably the login, then, rather than accepting the password
2011-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	Roofle		once it finally logs in, it says "Failed to add entry for user myusername"
2011-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	Roofle		which is an error message I haven't been able to find much out on yet
2011-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	Roofle		all of the stuff I'm finding on it has to do with SAMBA, and I'm not using that, nor do I have it configured
2011-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	strange.... That's a message from samba.
2011-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	Probably something to do with the Samba PAM module.
2011-04-19T09:15:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	Try this first though... If you type "bash", does it take as long as logging in?
2011-04-19T09:15:00.000Z	Roofle	undecim	Well, once you re-enforced that it was samba, I removed samba (it apparently was somehow installed after all) and it looks like that's fixed it
2011-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	Nice
2011-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	Roofle		that's what I get for not covering my bases
2011-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	You need samba though?
2011-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	Roofle		not particularly
2011-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	Roofle		I'm running a file server on this box, but I don't have any windows boxes
2011-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	Roofle		nor am I sure the time will ever come
2011-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	undecim	Roofle	Well, I guess that's good enough XD
