2009-12-02T04:52:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	two*
2009-12-02T04:44:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	i'm running ubuntu on my MBP right now :)
2009-12-02T04:45:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	(everybody thinks it's squidly lol) it runs very, very well, and everything's compatible 100%
2009-12-02T04:46:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	oh thanks man : ) Great : D
2009-12-02T04:47:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	if you need any more help with the mac stuff (even though it's awesomely documented on the ubuntu help wiki), just let us know :)
2009-12-02T04:50:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	thanks man. Sure, i will read and already read some of it. I'm asking because i never used a mac and i'm thinkin about geting one in the future, but i want to run Ubuntu on it, so i wanted to know of someone that have this setup if it everything works fine, or if existe major problems etc.
2009-12-02T04:50:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	I use OS X and ubuntu side by side (both on macs lol)
2009-12-02T04:51:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	cool : ) I'll probably run the too of them too, Mac OS looks very nice, for a proprietary OS of course.
2009-12-02T04:52:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	;)
2009-12-02T04:58:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	are macs stable? That's the main motive i'm thinking about get one in the future, and leave PC world forever. PC, in all my life, every fail in something, some part of it become imcopatible with another, or new hardware piece is imcompatible with the old one (when upgrading), or it just fails. With no exception, PC always fails, i wonder if what they say about mac is true: Macs are very well integrated hardware, and very stable for years.
2009-12-02T04:59:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	for me, it's the great hardware. i love my MBP like nothing else; they're tough, well-build, and very fast. OS X is even more stable than ubuntu (i know, i was surprised too)
2009-12-02T05:01:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	thanks for answer. I see, it might be, since Ubuntu risk more for more faster innovation, more bugs, but more fast innovation and improvement. I'm judging mac os x take longer to release a new version, so it probalby more stable, like a Debian or so.
2009-12-02T05:02:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	well, Apple does update the unix utilities quite often, and OS X is rather linux/unix-like. what I suggest doing if you need any utils that are open source or linux-availble, install darwinports. i did, and i can run everything i could on ubuntu and more
2009-12-02T05:04:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	oh thanks for the tip. That looks great : )
2009-12-02T05:05:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	it's as simple as sudo port install ________ instead of sudo aptitude install _____
2009-12-02T05:07:00.000Z	kernel_script	squircle	i see. Mac os x looks fun to play with too, Unix based right? I think i'll probalby feel home hehe, how's the file system? There is a root / and main directories like usr var etc too?
2009-12-02T05:07:00.000Z	squircle	kernel_script	i'll give you an overview in detail via privmsg
