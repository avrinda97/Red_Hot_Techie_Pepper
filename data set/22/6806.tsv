2006-10-11T11:14:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	System Settings / Default programs
2006-10-11T11:15:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	LjL	where?
2006-10-11T11:15:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	in the K menu
2006-10-11T11:16:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	LjL	there is no system setings
2006-10-11T11:16:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	LjL	you says on the kcontrol?
2006-10-11T11:16:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	no, i say in the K menu. the menu that lists all your applications.
2006-10-11T11:17:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	though you can also find it in KControl for that matter, under "KDE components"
2006-10-14T16:01:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	well... install IE5? :)
2006-10-14T16:02:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	LjL	how?
2006-10-14T16:02:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	uh, yes
2006-10-16T11:56:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	the router's IP, if you have a router
2006-10-16T11:59:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	it's the standard internal hostname for your computer. leave it as it is.
2006-10-16T12:01:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	an example hostname i suppose...? what are you doing, and what are you trying to accomplish?
2006-10-16T12:01:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	LjL	go to the 5th step
2006-10-16T12:03:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	i think you only want such a line (well, perhaps without calling the server "example") if you want to give a name to another machine on your network.
2006-10-16T12:03:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	the IP address of said machine being, in that example, 192.168.0.100
2006-10-16T12:04:00.000Z	SuperMiguel	LjL	so i ahve a no-ip host can i put it there
2006-10-16T12:05:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	no, if you have already registered a hostname for your host, it'll just be fetched by the DNS system, you don't need to add it to /etc/hosts.
2006-10-16T12:05:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	you only need to if you want it to have an *internal* name on your own machine
2006-10-18T14:20:00.000Z	LjL	SuperMiguel	i see gnump3d packaged in the official repositories, while i don't see jinzora. so for that alone, i'd choose the former...
