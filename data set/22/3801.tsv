2012-11-02T14:26:00.000Z	lesshaste		in precise I get Package biber is not available, but is referred to by another package. . Is this a bug?
2012-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	lesshaste		yep
2012-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	lesshaste		ubuntu is not what it used to be
2012-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	lesshaste		I don't think they fix bugs any more
2012-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	Hmm, wut.
2012-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	have you ever reported a bug that was fixed?
2012-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	Several times.
2012-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	can you give one example in the last 2 years?
2012-11-02T14:31:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	Sure, https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1068921 was fixed a few days ago.
2012-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/930962 recently got a workaround.
2012-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	It affected me, and I got a fix. So please don't talk nonsense about not fixing bugs.
2012-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	a) I am impressed you got things fixed and b) it's not nonsense
2012-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	I have reported a lot of bugs and they just languish mostly
2012-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	Such as?
2012-11-02T14:35:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/884210
2012-11-02T14:36:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	that's a typical example. Nothing happens
2012-11-02T14:36:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	Kernel bug, has to be fixed by the upsteam kernel developers.
2012-11-02T14:36:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	right.. so that's mostly the reaction I get... someone upstream ought to fix it and then nothing
2012-11-02T14:37:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	And you have to install one of the packages in: $ apt-file search biblatex.sty
2012-11-02T14:37:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	So forward it upsteam!
2012-11-02T14:37:00.000Z	lesshaste	jpds	sure but this was my point
2012-11-02T14:37:00.000Z	jpds	lesshaste	Anyway, you probably want to install: texlive-bibtex-extra.
