2005-08-30T06:31:00.000Z	icewt		is there a way to enable the debian menu in gnome (in ubuntu)?
2005-08-30T06:31:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	what is debian menu ?
2005-08-30T06:33:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	it's the menu which includes many of the programs that are not in the default ubuntu applications menu
2005-08-30T06:33:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	get those programs ?
2005-08-30T06:34:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	er.. what i mean is, there are quite many programs that don't appear in the applications menu when they are installed. however, they usually are in the debian menu, but debian menu is disabled in ubuntu for some reason
2005-08-30T06:35:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	ubuntu is based on debian
2005-08-30T06:36:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	debian menu looks something like that http://www.hoamskool.net/david/misc/kde_menu.jpg
2005-08-30T06:36:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	i mean the debian part of it
2005-08-30T06:37:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	except that it seems to be somehow broken in that pic ;)
2005-08-30T06:37:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	in smeg make a new menu .... called it debian
2005-08-30T06:38:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	i guess you didn't really understand this thing..
2005-08-30T06:39:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	yah ...
2005-08-30T06:50:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	i don't know how to explain ... but debian menu only comes with debian ...
2005-08-30T06:51:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	i can see it with smeg, but it can't be enabled
2005-08-30T06:53:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	try this ... on the left debian menu .. click it .. and add new entry ...
2005-08-30T06:58:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	hmm.. if the menu really is totally stripped off of ubuntu, i can only wonder why..
2005-11-06T10:43:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	yes, k3b is the best there is
2005-11-06T10:45:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	oh. i guess blender might be better
2005-11-06T10:45:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	blender is good .. it comes with game engine as well ... but the ui is very messy
2005-11-06T10:47:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	true, but i'm afraid that there's no better alternative. wings3d is good for just modelling though
2005-11-06T10:56:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	icewt	k3d is just like maya .... very very clean ... i recommend you check it out ... i am impressed :P
2005-11-06T10:57:00.000Z	icewt	wickedpuppy	ok :)
