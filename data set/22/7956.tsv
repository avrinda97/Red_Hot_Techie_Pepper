2005-11-23T14:40:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	does recursively -R mean it will also do same for ALL directories underneath?
2005-11-23T14:42:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ty
2005-11-23T14:44:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	kk
2005-11-23T14:45:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	if you want to work in current direcroty. is is chown username * ?
2005-11-23T14:45:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	will that change all files in current directory?
2005-11-23T14:47:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ok
2005-11-23T14:48:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	chown username *  worked too
2005-11-23T14:49:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	why does it say 2 usernames, username and root?
2005-11-23T14:49:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	-rw-r--r--  1 light root  4335907 2005-10-09 12:29 jm.mp3
2005-11-23T14:49:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	it changed from root root to light root
2005-11-23T14:50:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	should the group be root or light ?
2005-11-23T14:50:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ok so should the group be username or root even if the file belongs to username?
2005-11-23T14:51:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	is it ok for all of them to belong to root as group?
2005-11-23T14:52:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ok, and is it ok for all my personal files of them to belong to root as group?
2005-11-23T14:54:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	and how can you change just a folder and not its contents to different user from root?
2005-11-23T14:54:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ok so whats the command to do that?  because chown user ./* only didnt change the group
2005-11-23T14:55:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	I used the command you gave me, but it didnt change the group from root
2005-11-23T14:56:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	I typed: sudo chown light /.*
2005-11-23T14:56:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ah ok
2005-11-23T14:56:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	username:username or username.username ?
2005-11-23T14:57:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ok thanks
2005-11-23T15:01:00.000Z	lightbright	rob1	ok I got it all working, thanks for your help
