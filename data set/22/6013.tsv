2008-08-27T09:37:00.000Z	therealnanotube	richiefrich	i think route should be in gentoo as well. it's a standard linux/bsd command. :)
2008-08-27T09:37:00.000Z	richiefrich	therealnanotube	no i meant in the configs i can set it
2008-08-27T09:37:00.000Z	therealnanotube	richiefrich	ah yea, the configs are prob all in different places. :)
2008-08-27T09:38:00.000Z	richiefrich	therealnanotube	like routes_bond0=("default via 192.168.55.2 via 192.168.1.2")
2008-08-27T09:38:00.000Z	richiefrich	therealnanotube	you can just do that with route or if you can idk how
2008-08-27T09:39:00.000Z	richiefrich	therealnanotube	i know from a config :Pp
2008-08-27T09:39:00.000Z	therealnanotube	richiefrich	yea, all that's "really" done with 'route' in the backend.  :)
2008-08-27T09:39:00.000Z	richiefrich	therealnanotube	yeah i know  but i have no clue myself
2008-08-27T09:40:00.000Z	richiefrich	therealnanotube	i can add one thats all not multipule
2008-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	richiefrich	therealnanotube	or the script i posted
