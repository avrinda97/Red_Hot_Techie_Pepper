2005-07-01T14:52:00.000Z	george_		IBM has billions of dollars....how much do you have?
2005-07-01T14:52:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	some people don't care about ethics and supporting microsoft. they just want to be able to get on the internet
2005-07-01T14:54:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	and tbh, with ndiswrapper stuff, the biggest offender is broadcom, not microsoft
2005-07-01T14:57:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	what cpu have you got ?
2005-07-01T14:57:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	well i wanted the e2k...the beast...but it was not available
2005-07-01T14:58:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	and so far no one has produced a reasonable speed version of f-cpu
2005-07-01T14:58:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	married ? wear shoes ?
2005-07-01T14:59:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	no...no shoes...but i am married...but the bastards won't let me talk to my wife and kids for 11 years....fucking rich capitalist pigs
2005-07-01T14:59:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	you buy her an engagement ring ?
2005-07-01T15:00:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	no i bought her a wedding ring....and i don't know if she still has it
2005-07-01T15:00:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	because they won't let me talk to anybody for 11 years...fucking capitalist pigs and their paid-for government
2005-07-01T15:01:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	well it was no diamond...that is for sure.
2005-07-01T15:01:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	as a matter of fact...we did not have much...all her teeth rotted out at a young age
2005-07-01T15:01:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	but these bastards won't let me talk to her.
2005-07-01T15:03:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	they should be far beyond that now....but either they have been coerced by this fucked up government not to call or they have been brainwashed
2005-07-01T15:03:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	or they may be crippled or dead
2005-07-01T15:04:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	and i should have a right to know...but this god-dammed government is for the collective megacorporations instead of the individuals and the people
2005-07-01T15:04:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	hmm.. I'm sure there are ways to get in contact.
2005-07-01T15:05:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	well i have tried many things over 11 years...but so far not one damn person will help
2005-07-01T15:05:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	well if I was near you I'd buy you a beer and give you a pat on the back :)
2005-07-01T15:06:00.000Z	george_	Nermal	well i don't drink alcohol....and denying people freedom of information is not solved with pat on the back
2005-07-01T15:07:00.000Z	Nermal	george_	I didn't say it was.
