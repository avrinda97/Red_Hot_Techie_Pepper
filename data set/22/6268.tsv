2008-10-07T02:17:00.000Z	harriman		all i want to do is tripple boot. is that so hard
2008-10-07T02:18:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	shouldn't be.. it's just one more line in grub, afaik
2008-10-07T02:19:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	nope.. I dual-boot.. but that's it.. can't think of a third os I want to run =)
2008-10-07T02:20:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	well.. triple boot shouldn't be any harder.. unless you want to involve windows.. that makes things harder
2008-10-07T02:21:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	windows doesn't want you to dual/triple boot.. so it wont preserve any os's already installed.. that's the only problem afaik
2008-10-07T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	installing ubuntu on a computer with windows installed wont kill the windows install.. don't know about the boot camp stuff
2008-10-07T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	oh.. installing on the same partition.. that will only work in special special special cases
2008-10-07T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	you'll want at least one partition per operating system
2008-10-07T02:25:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	do you have an url to the wiki?
2008-10-07T02:27:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	"Install Ubuntu by partitioning the boot camp drive".. once you've done that you no longer have just one partition
2008-10-07T02:28:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	windows always wants it's own partition.. ubuntu will probably want one too.. I suspect os X will want a partition of it's own too..
2008-10-07T02:28:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	I can't find anything that says to install them all to the same partition
2008-10-07T02:29:00.000Z	Slart	harriman	you're welcome.. good luck
