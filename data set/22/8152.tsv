2008-09-27T15:16:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great		Hey guys, I needed to know if I can accelerate the cpu or may be make programs use some specific amount of my cpu when I play suppose games,
2008-09-27T15:16:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great		how do I do it without getting a graphics card?
2008-09-27T15:16:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great		Is anyone there?

2008-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great		I mean, okay for example, if I run Google earth (Just for instance), it's taking up 100% of my processor usage, and is slow, as it is using OpenGl and I don't want to have to (or want to) buy a graphics card... Is there a way to reduce the cpu usage?
2008-09-27T15:22:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	not really...not to any noticable degree
2008-09-27T15:22:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	amybe it will run better if google actually pulled their thumb out and made it truly native
2008-09-27T15:23:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	as it is now....it's just a program wrapped in a custom wine setup
2008-09-27T15:24:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	like i said...ther isnt a real native linux version
2008-09-27T15:24:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	any video card that doesnt plug directly into the bus is less than desirable
2008-09-27T15:25:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	:) i know ... its actually the windows code wrapped in a Qt'ified wine setup
2008-09-27T15:27:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	is what opensource?
2008-09-27T15:28:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	i doubt google earth is opensource or we would have a native linux version rather than this psuedo setups
2008-09-27T15:30:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	its most likley related to your video cards lack of power.
2008-09-27T15:30:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	this the downside to laptops
2008-09-27T15:31:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	not much i can do to help you there sorry
2008-09-27T15:33:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	i wouldnt imagine that an external video card via pcmia would have  the bandwidth available to it through the pcmia bus to have any improvement...
2008-09-27T15:34:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	if you are aware of how agp & pci-express are linked directly to the cpu then you will find the the pcmia buss on laptops doesnt have this advantage
2008-09-27T15:35:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	you can take the analogy of a v8 super car that still has a 2inch exhaust pipe...and non mandrel bent extractors...its not going to gain the benefit from having a v8 superchager
2008-09-27T15:36:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	almost getting off topic here with this though
2008-09-27T15:37:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	its all about throughput and bottlenecks
2008-09-27T15:37:00.000Z	airtonix	Xtreme_Great	how far can you run full pelt if your restricted to breathing through a straw?
