2007-06-25T11:59:00.000Z	Gomazia		how do i configure my sapphire 1950 x with Ubuntu?
2007-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	Gomazia		yes
2007-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	Gomazia		6.06
2007-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	Gomazia		yes
2007-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	Gomazia		but not the 3d
2007-06-25T12:01:00.000Z	Gomazia		i was trying Beryl
2007-06-25T12:01:00.000Z	Gomazia		humm
2007-06-25T12:01:00.000Z	Gomazia		ok, the prob is that i have 1 week of Ubuntu...
2007-06-25T12:02:00.000Z	Gomazia		and i'm very used to win XP
2007-06-25T12:02:00.000Z	Gomazia		but willing to change...
2007-06-25T12:03:00.000Z	mrobbert	Gomazia	Is this card using an ATI or an Nvidia chipset or something entirely different?
2007-06-25T12:04:00.000Z	Gomazia		uses ATI Radeon
2007-06-25T12:05:00.000Z	mrobbert	Gomazia	I've heard of quite a few people having problems with the ATI drivers so you are not alone.
2007-06-25T12:05:00.000Z	Gomazia		arrghhhh.... :(
2007-06-25T12:06:00.000Z	Gomazia		i'll try #ubuntu-effects. Thanks !
2007-06-25T12:06:00.000Z	mrobbert	Gomazia	I have gotten them to work so, but my system got a little sluggish so I turned off the effects. Is there any reason that you haven't upgraded to 7.04? 6.06 is now a year old and the 3D effects have come a long way in that year.
2007-06-25T12:07:00.000Z	Gomazia		the only reason is that i found this version first, so i downloaded it...
2007-06-25T12:08:00.000Z	Gomazia		'll get 7.04
2007-06-25T12:08:00.000Z	mrobbert	Gomazia	7.04 is the first version that I even got them to work. It is just a matter of a check box  or two and they're automatically installed and activated.
2007-06-25T12:09:00.000Z	mrobbert	Gomazia	You can even just try running it as a LiveCD to see if they will work out of the box.
2007-06-25T12:09:00.000Z	Gomazia		i will
2007-06-25T12:10:00.000Z	Gomazia	mrobbert	: Thank's for the advice
