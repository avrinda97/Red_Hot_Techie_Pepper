2006-09-03T11:52:00.000Z	dmoyne		Again any expert in ldap as I have questions !
2006-09-03T11:52:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	Go ahead.
2006-09-03T11:57:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	ok I collected gplflash-0.4.13.tar.bz2 on a site and compile it according to detailed procedure !
2006-09-03T11:58:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	as this file is not to big I can send directly to you trogh ma chatter !
2006-09-03T11:58:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	I don't know what gplflash is, nor what your problem is.
2006-09-03T12:00:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	this allows to play flash sites on x_64 machines with Firefox ; this is your concern is iot not ?
2006-09-03T12:00:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	No.
2006-09-03T12:03:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	I'm unsure what your LDAP question is about. Dapper has OpenLDAP. It fully supports SSL (and TLS)
2006-09-03T12:04:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	you meran it works on your computer with TLS and SSL ?
2006-09-03T12:05:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	Your questions are odd.
2006-09-03T12:06:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	if you can help me fixing Openldap server for TLS  SSL I would appreciate
2006-09-03T12:09:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	can you help me for my Ldap problem !
2006-09-03T12:11:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	Again, as I've said about 3 times, you haven't said what your problem is.
2006-09-03T12:13:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	my connection through port 636 is not accepted and I have no clue regarding the cause !
2006-09-03T12:14:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	Probably need to a) set up a certificate and b) tell slapd to listen on 636 and c) use TLS instead
2006-09-03T12:15:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	do you have Openldap server running with SSL on you computer ?
2006-09-03T12:16:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	seconde question what is the difference between SS with certificates and TLS ?
2006-09-03T12:17:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	TLS is Transport Layer Security, widely viewed as the "more appropiate" way to use SSL. The SSL session is established after a plain text session... on the same port.
2006-09-03T12:17:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	But the encryption itself is exactly the same.
2006-09-03T12:18:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	do you know of a goos tutorial for me to review what I did for Ubuntu Dapper ?
2006-09-03T12:19:00.000Z	wasabi_	dmoyne	No. Ubutnu's OpenLDAP doesn't differ at all from Debian's, and Debians is mostly standard. Any OPenLDAP tutorial will provide useful information.
2006-09-03T12:19:00.000Z	dmoyne	wasabi_	ok I will go again trough Debian info ; thanks !
