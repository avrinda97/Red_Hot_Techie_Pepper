2008-04-29T04:24:00.000Z	Farnaby		Guess not. Anybody know how to make a drive automountable?
2008-04-29T04:25:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	is it a removable drive? or a fixed drive that you want mounted when the machine boots up?
2008-04-29T04:25:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	removable
2008-04-29T04:26:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	its a sony memory stick. Had it working on my old computer, it automounted the first time on this computer and then never again. Its the problem in this first post http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=576902
2008-04-29T04:30:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	ok, remove the drive, wait a few seconds and plug it back in, then paste the contents of this command on a !pastebin (do not paste in here).    dmesg | tail -n 20
2008-04-29T04:32:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	http://pastebin.com/d79f40320
2008-04-29T04:33:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	ok, how about this one.  sudo fdisk -l
2008-04-29T04:34:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	http://pastebin.com/d32ff65f1
2008-04-29T04:35:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	good enough. try this.  pmount-hal /dev/sdb1;  mount | grep -i sdb1  # let me know if you get any output there
2008-04-29T04:37:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	Error given UDI is not a mountable volume
2008-04-29T04:38:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	hmm. ok. try this.  sudo mkdir -p /media/test;  sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/test # what happens here?
2008-04-29T04:39:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	no output
2008-04-29T04:39:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	hmm.   find /media/test
2008-04-29T04:39:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	and I can mount it
2008-04-29T04:40:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	found it, whats next in your bag of tricks?
2008-04-29T04:40:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	well, it's mounted right?
2008-04-29T04:40:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	what more do you need? :)
2008-04-29T04:41:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	i guess gnome-vfs has trouble dealing with FA12 partitions. it's not the first time i've seen this.
2008-04-29T04:41:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	the ability for it to automount it would be nice ;)
2008-04-29T04:44:00.000Z	unop	Farnaby	well, i know .. but this appears to be something vfs is choking on but what you could do is create a udev-rule that executes a command as soon as udev recognizes the disk -- it's a little tricky but have a read here http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html
2008-04-29T04:51:00.000Z	Farnaby	unop	I think I am missing something here... not sure how the udev would automount it but then again you said it is tricky
