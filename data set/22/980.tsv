2011-01-12T01:35:00.000Z	seul		hi! When i boot my computer, 1 out of 3 times i reach bios, where i enter the correct HDD to boot to, and when i choose "save changes and exit", and the computer boots, the screen just stays black. Why is that? And then the next time i manage to get it booting, it wont remember my changes in bios.
2011-01-12T01:37:00.000Z	zteam	seul	Try to update your bios, but be CAREFUL :-))
2011-01-12T01:37:00.000Z	seul	zteam	right now i cant even reach bios. stupid computer wont even boot up so i can see bios.
2011-01-12T01:39:00.000Z	zteam	seul	Have you changed any BIOS setting?
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	zteam	seul	try to remove one of your RAM modules (assuming you have more than one)
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	seul	zteam	ok, i have 2. Ill remove the second one.
2011-01-12T01:50:00.000Z	seul	zteam	read what i wrote last time. any comments?
2011-01-12T01:51:00.000Z	zteam	seul	I didn't see that, since I lost my connection...
2011-01-12T01:51:00.000Z	seul	zteam	okey, so this is the plan now, remove and reconnect all connectors. And then reboot an assload of times until it works
2011-01-12T01:53:00.000Z	zteam	seul	sounds good... If you have a older motherboard with SATA-harddrives attached, check them as well
2011-01-12T01:54:00.000Z	zteam	seul	some old motherboards do have problems with SATA-cabels, that may glitch
2011-01-12T01:54:00.000Z	seul	zteam	ok, brb with results..
2011-01-12T02:07:00.000Z	zteam	seul	Nope, it isn't, try with replacing that battery
2011-01-12T02:16:00.000Z	zteam	seul	so, all you get is a black screen after you picked out, the battery, is that correct?
2011-01-12T02:17:00.000Z	seul	zteam	after i picked out the battery i goit this screen saying my battery was low. When i clicked f1 to continue pretty much nothing happen
2011-01-12T02:19:00.000Z	zteam	seul	okey, here is what I would do in your place: 1. Remove the battery and take it to a clock store or some computer store.
2011-01-12T02:20:00.000Z	zteam	seul	2. After you done that, you may use  "Ultimate Boot CD" to check your hardware
2011-01-12T02:21:00.000Z	seul	zteam	kinda hard to do that, considering how i cant even reach bios.
2011-01-12T02:23:00.000Z	zteam	seul	Yes, that's why I suggest you take your cmos-battery to a computer store, so they can replace it for you
2011-01-12T02:23:00.000Z	seul	zteam	ok, ill look into that.
2011-01-12T02:24:00.000Z	zteam	seul	AFTER you try that, you should hopefully be able to use Ultimate boot cd to check your hardware
2011-01-12T02:24:00.000Z	zteam	seul	:-)
