2009-12-13T09:21:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget		basically my laptop cd drive is dead, i cant boot from usb and i have no floppy :S ,,, i took out the hdd from the laptop, connected it via USB to my main tower, installed ubuntu, took it out and put back in my laptop.. it loads to desktop (though touchpad doesnt work)
2009-12-13T09:21:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget		i got some links last night in this IRC chat, but Im not very skilled enough and dont really understand it :S
2009-12-13T09:22:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	I would install ubuntu-minimal on the HDD, transfer it back to the laptop, then complete the install from there (you can install the ubuntu-desktop package once it is back in the laptop).
2009-12-13T09:23:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	that's what i tried to do, but im not 100% sure when to stop the installation. Do I stop after the copying files process ?
2009-12-13T09:27:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	you can get cd's that you can use to boot to a usb stick, but that requires that you have a working cd drive.
2009-12-13T09:43:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	look here for different install options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
2009-12-13T09:49:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	and FYI, I had a similar situation a while back and the minimal install CD method worked for me.
2009-12-13T09:44:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	checked that last night, the ones i saw require a floppy, otherwise somthing about installing grub
2009-12-13T09:44:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	does your CD drive work at all, or is it completely toast?
2009-12-13T09:45:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	dont think it "completely" toast.. it can still boot the discs ok, just cant read the data needed to copy
2009-12-13T09:45:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	try the minimal CD install method, it just needs to boot the CD and will download all the packages from the internet.
2009-12-13T09:47:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	thanks, i might give that a shot... though roughly what's the size of the packages ? i got little data left for the month, otherwise will have to try at work
2009-12-13T09:48:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	probably about 500 meg or so, give or take.
2009-12-13T09:49:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	hmm,t hanks :)
2009-12-13T09:49:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	yw :-)
2009-12-13T09:51:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	any ideas on the Touchpad ?
2009-12-13T09:52:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	what about the touchpad?
2009-12-13T09:53:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	doesn't work at all... not sure if its missing a driver or maybe needs a configuration or somthing
2009-12-13T09:53:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	i know it's physically fine though
2009-12-13T09:53:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	it should, "just work", try your re-install first and see if it comes to life, otherwise it could be a hardware problem.
2009-12-13T09:54:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	pj	hmm, ok, ill give re-install a shot, thnx :)
2009-12-13T09:54:00.000Z	pj	Newbie-Widget	it could be because you installed ubuntu on a different computer, so it didn't install the touchpad drivers because it didn't detect the touchpad at the time.
