2005-11-24T13:13:00.000Z	blanky		help, my mind's gonna blow up. I'm currently deciding between gentoo, ubuntu, or debian
2005-11-24T13:14:00.000Z	blanky		I mean, I love ubuntu, havne't tried debian or gentoo
2005-11-24T13:16:00.000Z	blanky		lol okay
2005-11-24T13:18:00.000Z	blanky		Hey guys, can I trust Ubuntu will live long? I mean, it's not one of those 'goes up fast, falls down fast' distros right? It'll keep going? like debian?
2005-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	blanky		hopefuly, hopefuly, well, I dont think so, since it relies on Debian haha
2005-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	blanky		Unless it broke off of debian *complete silence, disc rip*

2006-04-14T11:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	blanky	if you want to mess with the bot, do it in a private chat, please...

2006-04-14T11:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	blanky	let me rephrase that: keep spamming the bot in-channel, and your kickbanning will be public too...
