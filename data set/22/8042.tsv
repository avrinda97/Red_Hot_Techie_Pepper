2005-10-30T11:48:00.000Z	ubenguin		hello all...damn I screwed up; hope someone can help... I killed grub (it's a long story), and while trying to reinstall it I deleted my initrd and vmlinux in /boot
2005-10-30T11:49:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	do you want copies of those files?
2005-10-30T11:49:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	no
2005-10-30T11:49:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	so what do you want?
2005-10-30T11:49:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	oh..duh, I thought it said do I have copies
2005-10-30T11:50:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	so it's as simple as that?
2005-10-30T11:51:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	if all you've done is deleted those 2 files, then putting them back should sort you out
2005-10-30T11:51:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	I thought the initrd was different for each computer, just a generic file?
2005-10-30T11:51:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	it's a binary in the .deb file I think
2005-10-30T11:52:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	well, it's worth a try, so you know where I can get them?
2005-10-30T11:52:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	i might be wrong about that.  I can't find boot/initrd in any package.  sorry!
2005-10-30T11:53:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	didn't think it was a package... :0
2005-10-30T11:53:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	I didn't think of that though , let me google for it real quick
2005-10-30T11:55:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	I guess what you need to do is download the linux-image-2.6.12-9-386.deb and initramfs-tools.deb packages from packages.ubuntu.com and then boot into 'rescue' mode and install them with dpkg -i
2005-10-30T11:56:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	if you're lucky, the .deb files are already in your package cache, /var/cache/apt/archives/
2005-10-30T11:56:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	and I would just run initramfs? after I install them?
2005-10-30T11:57:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	I think that installing the kernel will make the initrd for you
2005-10-30T11:57:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	aahhh
2005-10-30T11:57:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	sounds like it might work...I'll give it a shot and check back; thanks
2005-10-30T13:09:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	just wanted to let you know it worked
2005-10-30T13:10:00.000Z	ubenguin	dooglus	I just had to install the linux-image deb and it generated the initrd and ran grub automagically
2005-11-04T07:39:00.000Z	dooglus	ubenguin	there's a user guide?  where's that?
