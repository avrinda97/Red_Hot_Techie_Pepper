2010-04-16T19:55:00.000Z	weekly		hey guys, so rsync is returning a "No space left on device (28)" when the device im writing to is clearly not full... ideas?
2010-04-16T19:56:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	is there a disk quota in place?
2010-04-16T19:56:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	how do i find that out?
2010-04-16T19:57:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	typing "quota" on the target machine should indicate something
2010-04-16T19:57:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	here what i get "The program 'quota' is currently not installed."
2010-04-16T20:00:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	how close is the filesystem to being full?
2010-04-16T20:01:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	289gb used 627gb free
2010-04-16T20:01:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	do you have write permission to the target directory?
2010-04-16T20:02:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	yeah i used chown to get write permission
2010-04-16T20:02:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	what are the current permissions of the target directory
2010-04-16T20:04:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	im sorry i dont know what the command is to get the rxetc readout
2010-04-16T20:06:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	try "ls -ld <directory>"
2010-04-16T20:07:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	"drwxr-xr-x 9 weekly weekly 4096 2010-04-16 08:15"
2010-04-16T20:10:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	looks fine. can you move data to that target with scp?
2010-04-16T20:10:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	yes i can
2010-04-16T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	what's the exact rsync line you use?
2010-04-16T20:11:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	rsync -av /home/weekly/link_to_setux_gis-data/ /media/gis/ >> /home/weekly/Desktop/gis_backup_log.txt
2010-04-16T20:15:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	is your /tmp directory full, by any chance?
2010-04-16T20:15:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	does the "--inplace" switch help at all?
2010-04-16T20:17:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	the /tmp has a ver small amount of data in it, ill man the --inplace and see if it will help
2010-04-16T20:17:00.000Z	sipior	weekly	none of your partitions are running close to full? rsync makes a temporary copy of the data by default...
2010-04-16T20:19:00.000Z	weekly	sipior	possably the swap partition gets full? where does rsync make the temp copy? i mean, last night i ran it and it got about 80% of the 300ish gigs, it just didnt complete
