2009-06-29T01:18:00.000Z	Guest53747		my sound stopped working since reboot
2009-06-29T01:19:00.000Z	Guest53747		Can anyone help me my sound stopped working
2009-06-29T01:21:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	in terminal, paste output from "/etc/init.d/pulseaudio && echo Pulseaudio running"
2009-06-29T01:23:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	 ok sec
2009-06-29T01:23:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	 * PulseAudio configured for per-user sessions
2009-06-29T01:24:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	ok, when/why did audio disappear?
2009-06-29T01:25:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	i have no clue, i removed some misc apps last session but i highly doubt those are causing me not to have sound
2009-06-29T01:26:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	this is really anyoing and alsamixer looks decent
2009-06-29T01:26:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	are you on jaunty or intrepid (or other)?
2009-06-29T01:26:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	9.04
2009-06-29T01:27:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	hmm i'm trying to remember a step in restarting pulseaudio...
2009-06-29T01:27:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	/etc/init.d/pulseaudio restart or something?
2009-06-29T01:28:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	you'd think but in intrepid it doesn't really do anything... (i'm on intrepid btw)
2009-06-29T01:29:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	u recon a reboot might work?
2009-06-29T01:29:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	always worth a shot. i figured you had already tried that...
2009-06-29T01:30:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	 i did ;(
2009-06-29T01:31:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	might it be because i removed xmms2?
2009-06-29T01:31:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	you just used synaptics right? should be safe
2009-06-29T01:31:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	i used apt from terminal
2009-06-29T01:32:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	how can i check dependencies?
2009-06-29T01:32:00.000Z	Guest53747	s032082_	im going to reboot again brb
2009-06-29T01:33:00.000Z	s032082_	Guest53747	easiest in synaptics, just rightclick and go to properties -> dependencies. synaptics/apt automatically adds whatever is needed
