2009-05-09T12:38:00.000Z	deek		quick question RE: ATI video drivers.
2009-05-09T12:39:00.000Z	deek		i'm running 9.04 - installed the FGLRX drivers from the hardware drivers adminstrative pane, but i want to use the driver from AMD site... problem is, its a .run file... and i'm too new to know what to do with it.
2009-05-09T12:39:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	sudo chmod +x <filename>
2009-05-09T12:40:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	./<filename>
2009-05-09T12:40:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	replace that second command with sudo ./<filename> instead
2009-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	is it working?
2009-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	deek	brassmaster1	still says permission denied
2009-05-09T12:44:00.000Z	deek	brassmaster1	do i not need a .deb file?
2009-05-09T12:45:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	no, you shouldn't.
2009-05-09T12:45:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	i have installed fglrx that way.
2009-05-09T12:45:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	admittedly, it's not the best way to do it. should really be using something like envyng
2009-05-09T12:46:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	try sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk
2009-05-09T12:48:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	you will also need envyng-qt
2009-05-09T12:48:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	my bad
2009-05-09T12:49:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	it will be really obvious how to proceed.
2009-05-09T12:50:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	you should already be set then
2009-05-09T12:50:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	because it's newer?
2009-05-09T12:51:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	envy usually suggests the latest version. i'm not sure why it wouldn't or isn't now.
2009-05-09T12:53:00.000Z	deek	brassmaster1	TY...
2009-05-09T12:53:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	?
2009-05-09T12:54:00.000Z	brassmaster1	deek	oh yeah, no problem. sorry i couldn't be of more help.
