2010-08-03T15:36:00.000Z	blah_sphemer		I tried installing ubuntu on my external HDD and did NOT disconnect the SATA cables. now when I boot, it gives me error 21 or error 5. What must I do? I have fedora and windows xp installed on my machine
2010-08-03T15:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blah_sphemer	What is installed on the internal?
2010-08-03T15:37:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	fdedora 12 and windows xo
2010-08-03T15:38:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	Can my data and OS be recovered?
2010-08-03T15:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blah_sphemer	Boot from the internal by selecting it in the BIOS, grub should load. Boot Ubuntu and run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" to configure the grub pacakge to install to the external rather than the internal drive (Select only your external drive and *no* partitions).
2010-08-03T15:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blah_sphemer	Then reboot and this time boot fedora and run: su -c "grub-install /dev/sda"
2010-08-03T15:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blah_sphemer	Assuming that your internal drive is sda.
2010-08-03T15:40:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	I intalled from a live cd and selected only the external HDD. without partitions and I used the entire HDD
2010-08-03T15:40:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	I'll try your suggestion and get back. THanks
2010-08-03T15:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blah_sphemer	You're welcome.
2010-08-03T15:52:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	i made my system boot from the internal HD but still it says: *Grub 1.5* Loading GRUB. Then 'Error 21'
2010-08-03T15:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blah_sphemer	Any other drives?
2010-08-03T15:53:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	just got my internal HD and the external containing ubuntu, . I have a live CD though

2010-08-03T16:12:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	I hope the contents of my internal HD aren't disturbed because of the ubuntu installation.
2010-08-03T16:12:00.000Z	blah_sphemer	Jordan_U	I am positive that I installed ubuntu only on the exteral HDD without any partitions.
