2011-01-28T17:34:00.000Z	tyska	marcobiscaro2112	indeed it was working before, but now i started my ubuntu and it is dead
2011-01-28T17:35:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	tyska	have you tried to reboot your system? maybe some driver failed to load or something like this

2011-01-28T17:36:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	tyska	open a terminal and run: dmesg > $HOME/debug.txt
2011-01-28T17:37:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	tyska	then upload the file debug.txt at your home to pastebin
