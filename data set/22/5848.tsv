2008-11-30T13:47:00.000Z	alex_21		?
2008-11-30T13:48:00.000Z	alex_21		Thanks rww
2008-11-30T13:49:00.000Z	alex_21		I threw them both into the Lan because I need to firewall them off. Behind the router, 192.168.0.102, or eth1, is my mail/web server and 192.168.0.1, or eth0, is my dhcp server for my LAN
2008-11-30T13:50:00.000Z	alex_21		How?
2008-11-30T13:51:00.000Z	alex_21		Instead of what?
2008-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	alex_21		Dave, I'm sory. How do I set that up
2008-11-30T13:52:00.000Z	alex_21		I thought you had to pay to use pop3/imap from Hotmail
2008-11-30T13:53:00.000Z	alex_21		Because DHCP is for my Linux Thin Clients
2008-11-30T13:54:00.000Z	alex_21		Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr, I'm not sure what to do
2008-11-30T13:55:00.000Z	alex_21		It seems like everywhere I look is errors, erros, and more errors. I bet there is more errors than a guide dog has hairs
2008-11-30T13:56:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	why are you using two different interfaces on a single machine for the same network?
2008-11-30T13:58:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	use only one, will make it easier
2008-11-30T14:05:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	what services did you have running?
2008-11-30T14:24:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	is the static ip set correctly on the lan connect card?
2008-11-30T14:27:00.000Z	alex_21	sloopy	The two cards are on the network, and I think they are. I get a "No ... something, ... process" error when using /etc/init.d/networking restart. I have replaced the name with something because I can't read it
2008-11-30T14:27:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	get the output from a network restart in a pastebin
2008-11-30T14:31:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	well cant help with Â´No ... something... process' doesnt give much to go on...
2008-11-30T14:33:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	a copy of what network says when it restarts would be a good way to start
2008-11-30T14:35:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	dont know, i am hearing not sight impaired so i am not knowledgable in such things...
2008-11-30T14:41:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	it isnt a low priority, there is a limited amount of resources...
2008-11-30T14:43:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	also a very small percentage of ubuntu users/knowledgeable use irc also
2008-11-30T14:45:00.000Z	sloopy	alex_21	they also pick and choose their developers, so they can get a good cross section of knowledgeable people in many different fields, where as linux uses volunteers, who if there is a specific field no one volunteers for they will be lacking...
