2008-06-03T21:01:00.000Z	lau_		I cant enter anything when using sudo
2008-06-03T21:01:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	error message?
2008-06-03T21:03:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	sudo is usually kind of consistent.. either it works or it doesn't.. the command after sudo might fail though
2008-06-03T21:04:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	what did you do when you tried installing wine?
2008-06-03T21:04:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	sudo apt-get install wine ?
2008-06-03T21:05:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	yes..  did that work?
2008-06-03T21:05:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	what makes you think it didn't?
2008-06-03T21:05:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	sudo doesn't *always* ask for your password
2008-06-03T21:06:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	if you've done it once.. you've got a specific time before it asks again..
2008-06-03T21:06:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	ok.. would you mind doing something for me?
2008-06-03T21:07:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	open a terminal and write.. whoami
2008-06-03T21:07:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	it should write out your username
2008-06-03T21:08:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	now run this "sudo whoami". It should write out "root"
2008-06-03T21:08:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	did you have to enter your password?
2008-06-03T21:08:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	yes
2008-06-03T21:09:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	that's because you had already used sudo ... just recently
2008-06-03T21:09:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	is that what you meant by "sudo not working"?
2008-06-03T21:10:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	so then sudo worked.. you were just expecting it to prompt you for the password.. which it didn't =)
2008-06-03T21:11:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	no worries.. everyone has to learn this stuff in the beginning
2008-06-03T21:11:00.000Z	Slart	lau_	you're welcome
