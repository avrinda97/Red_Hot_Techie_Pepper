2011-06-05T23:53:00.000Z	arleslie		Hey guys, I'm trying to install a network printer on Ubuntu 11.04 --- I keep getting this error: "Tree connect failed (NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME)"
2011-06-05T23:54:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Use IP address.
2011-06-05T23:54:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	I am
2011-06-05T23:54:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Can you ping it?
2011-06-05T23:54:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	yes
2011-06-05T23:55:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Where are you getting the error from?
2011-06-05T23:55:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	the web-interface, the printer application in ubuntu just says "Unable to connect to CIFS host"
2011-06-05T23:56:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	I should also point out that the printer is hosted on a Windows 7 computer.
2011-06-05T23:56:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Then it is NOT a network printer.  It is a shared printer.
2011-06-05T23:56:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	sorry it's what I considered a network printer.
2011-06-05T23:56:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Probably best to plug the printer directly into the Ubuntu machine.
2011-06-05T23:57:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	I would if I could, but I guess I can find other work arounds.
2011-06-05T23:57:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Why can't you?
2011-06-05T23:58:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	it's a family used printer and I don't have the room in my room to move it to
2011-06-05T23:58:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Does your router have a print server option?
2011-06-05T23:58:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	no
2011-06-05T23:59:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Well, I don't know then.  I've never tried to access a printer shared from Win7
2011-06-05T23:59:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	have you had success trying to access a printer from any SMB?
2011-06-05T23:59:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	Yes
2011-06-06T00:00:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	well I can connect to the printer via smb (the printing application can see it) I just cannot print to it.
2011-06-06T00:02:00.000Z	usr13	arleslie	I should clarify:  I have shared a printer connected to a Linux computer with a MS Windows computer.  That is the experience I have.  I do not have experience in accessing a printer shared from a MS Windows computer.
2011-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	arleslie	usr13	ok, thanks for your help anyway.
