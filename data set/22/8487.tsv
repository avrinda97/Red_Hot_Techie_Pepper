2006-03-27T15:39:00.000Z	MonsieurBon		anyone knows a goot LaTeX program? I don't want Wysiwyg, I want classic typesetting
2006-03-27T15:39:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	you mean an editor?
2006-03-27T15:40:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	yes
2006-03-27T15:40:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	I use emacs with acutex
2006-03-27T15:40:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	for all reports at university
2006-03-27T15:43:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	IMHO nothing is comparable to emacs with acutex
2006-03-27T15:43:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	you meen auctex?
2006-03-27T15:44:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	do I need tetex-base or something?
2006-03-27T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	yes
2006-03-27T15:49:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	I installed auctex, and tetex-base that's all then for emacs?
2006-03-27T15:50:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	maybe tetex-extra too
2006-03-27T15:51:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	how do i install packages like fancyheaders or similar?
2006-03-27T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	fancyheaders is in tetex-extra, I think
2006-03-27T15:52:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	ok, thanks
2006-03-27T15:53:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	are you already familiar with emacs?
2006-03-27T15:53:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	yes, a bit. why do you ask?
2006-03-27T15:54:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	I was going to tell you it would take a little time to getting used to it
2006-03-27T15:54:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	but it all worth it
2006-03-27T15:55:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	I used emacs a lot before for c++, no latex so far though
2006-03-27T15:55:00.000Z	mwe	MonsieurBon	you won't get into trouble then
2006-03-27T15:55:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	i suppose not
2006-03-27T15:56:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	mwe	it's rather latex giving me trouble then emacs! :)
