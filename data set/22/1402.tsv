2011-04-25T08:02:00.000Z	Sasquatch7		Hi all
2011-04-25T08:02:00.000Z	Sasquatch7		I'm tempted to install the new 11.04 beta and then upgrade to the final on it's release day...or is it better to just wait for the final release to install?
2011-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	truthfully, I would wait a couple of weeks after to install.
2011-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	Really, a couple weeks? Why so?
2011-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	the new one is probably a little buggy. They always rush.
2011-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	they feel a need to adhere to the 6month timeline... always
2011-04-25T08:04:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	not to mention the fact that the mirrors get loaded down and you can't install packages
2011-04-25T08:04:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	Oh ok, thanks. What version are you using currently?
2011-04-25T08:04:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	10.10
2011-04-25T08:05:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	whatever the last release is
2011-04-25T08:05:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	Oh ok, and is it alright to do an upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 or is it better to do a fresh install?
2011-04-25T08:06:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	depends on who you talk to. I don't trust upgrades and do a fresh install. Most people don't and seem to be fine.
2011-04-25T08:06:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	that's what Ive heard too.
2011-04-25T08:06:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	the party line is that they are perfectly fine. I had issues (years ago) because I tried to update when the repos were overloaded.
2011-04-25T08:07:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	since then I have used it as a perfect time to cleanse my system of all the mistakes I have made.
2011-04-25T08:07:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	Ha good thinking.
2011-04-25T08:15:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	Xming is a port of what is already on linux
2011-04-25T08:15:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	Ok, thanks.
2011-04-25T08:15:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	Xming is the windows version of what linux uses for graphics. It comes with ubuntu desktop
2011-04-25T08:16:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	Xserver?
2011-04-25T08:16:00.000Z	smw	Sasquatch7	correct. All linux DESKTOPS have X installed.
2011-04-25T08:17:00.000Z	Sasquatch7	smw	Thanks :)
