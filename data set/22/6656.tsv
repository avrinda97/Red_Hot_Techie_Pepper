2006-08-27T08:09:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		The umm, bot I believe will see my question as too large. lol
2006-08-27T08:11:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		I'm a new user to ubuntu (like brand spanking new.  lol), and I've read there's a problem with xwindows system.  I saw the page for updating, but if ubuntu is not installed yet, how do I do it since I have a live cd/install cd?
2006-08-27T08:11:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		Or is the iso's now updated?
2006-08-27T08:12:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		Lupine_85:  Ah good.  Cause I already threw away 3 cd's  lol
2006-08-27T08:13:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		Ty All. I'm going to download again, and try again. lol
2006-08-27T08:15:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		Oh, another thought comes to mind, will it read/write ntfs so that I can get my files off my other drive and then format it?
2006-08-27T08:15:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		This would be after OS install.
2006-08-27T08:16:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		lol ok ^_^
2006-08-27T08:16:00.000Z	ShoeUnited		!ntfs
2006-08-27T08:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ShoeUnited	Not a good idea to write to ntfs
2006-08-27T08:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ShoeUnited	ntfs write works 98% of the time..

2006-08-27T11:09:00.000Z	ShoeUnited	Jack_Sparrow	No, it still says that X system won't load
2006-08-27T11:09:00.000Z	ShoeUnited	Jack_Sparrow	And if I ignore it, then it just keeps loading stuff until I get root.
2006-08-27T11:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ShoeUnited	Could you refresh me on the original question or problem.
2006-08-27T11:10:00.000Z	ShoeUnited	Jack_Sparrow	NP, want me to take it to pm?
