2010-05-28T18:39:00.000Z	jshanab		I have a mint 8 machine that is 100 miles away and has at best, a 3-4Kb/sec phone connection on a win 2k notebbok next to it. No broadband. I was told ubuntu 9.10 is the "repo" for it and would like to set up a ubuntu box here and use either apt-mirror or debmirror to create a mirror and then drive it out there.   The question is can I install 10.04 LTS and use apt mirror? or do I need to...
2010-05-28T18:39:00.000Z	jshanab		...install 9.01 so that the versions of packages are correct.  Is 10.,04 LTS inclusive of 9.10 contining minor updates, or is it one or the other?
2010-05-28T18:40:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	no, not inclusive
2010-05-28T18:40:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	need to fully reinstall a new system
2010-05-28T18:41:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	Thanks. Is a repo jsut a collection of packages? can I have old both in one repo? (I know this would be big, but I may want to use this box to serve multiple versions
2010-05-28T18:41:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	apt mirror you mean?
2010-05-28T18:43:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	so mirror is a command of apt? it mirrors the repos your copy is connected to?  SOrry for the confusion, I am a gentooer mostly. Versioning is done differently
2010-05-28T18:45:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	its a package
2010-05-28T18:45:00.000Z	bazhang		!info apt-mirror | jshanab
2010-05-28T18:46:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	That is what I thought, it was a package. I just was unsure what you meant by asking "apt mirror you mean? "
2010-05-28T18:47:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	the populated mirror itself would be many tens of GB though
2010-05-28T18:47:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	So can I have a ubuntu 10 box that serves out the repo for 9.10 packages
2010-05-28T18:47:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	if you are talking about using for different versions for example
2010-05-28T18:47:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	No problem on the 45 Gigibytes
2010-05-28T18:48:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	how many machines are involved here
2010-05-28T18:48:00.000Z	jshanab		Att he moment 1 machine 100 miles from decent internet that needs update to get some hardware working.
2010-05-28T18:49:00.000Z	bazhang		that seems excessive for one machine; what about aptoncd jshanab
2010-05-28T18:49:00.000Z	bazhang		!aptoncd
2010-05-28T18:50:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	I was reading on that and wasn't sure if that would do the trick It seemed like I would need access to the machine or one that is identical at this end. I want to prep here where I have a decent connection and then drive 150 miles and conenct the two together and update it.
2010-05-28T18:52:00.000Z	bazhang	jshanab	or set one identical up in a virtualbox then do it that way
2010-05-28T18:52:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	Then I want to bring the box here and keep it synced with a cron. So everytime I take it there I can update it. Now if aptoncd will let me send a cd in the mail, that may be better.
2010-05-28T18:54:00.000Z	jshanab	bazhang	Virtualbox will not hit the hardware driver issues. New machine is tough. Gotta get exact hardware knowledge, and machine is older.  Rather this be a bit more generic.
