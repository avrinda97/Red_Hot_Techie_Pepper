2005-05-26T09:39:00.000Z	stuNNed	kestas	what was the prob?
2005-05-26T09:39:00.000Z	kestas	stuNNed	had very limited sucess, when I got it working it only played very limited about of game very buggy
2005-05-26T09:39:00.000Z	kestas	stuNNed	so I aquired cedega, and it was only slightly better, but still buggy and crap
2005-05-26T09:39:00.000Z	kestas	stuNNed	forget lpaying windows games on linux, it just doesnt work

2005-05-26T09:40:00.000Z	kestas	stuNNed	I barely managed to get C&C generals working, even thought its one of cedegas best supported games

2005-05-26T09:41:00.000Z	kestas	stuNNed	grub loads menu.lst on bootup
2005-05-26T09:42:00.000Z	stuNNed	kestas	afaik in ubuntu if any changes made need to run update-grub but could be mistaken
2005-05-26T09:43:00.000Z	kestas	stuNNed	I dont think so
2005-05-26T09:43:00.000Z	kestas	stuNNed	well see I gues
