2011-03-28T18:31:00.000Z	alkaliv2	hzroot	lol I'm seeing as much.  You might have to install these drivers from a binary source like the nvidia website
2011-03-28T18:32:00.000Z	hzroot	alkaliv2	do they avaible on nvidia site?
2011-03-28T18:33:00.000Z	alkaliv2	hzroot	I'm looking, you'll have to check too.  I'm not sure what they are under.
2011-03-28T18:36:00.000Z	alkaliv2	hzroot	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg

2011-03-28T18:40:00.000Z	alkaliv2	hzroot	I can't even find a binary of your driver.  You may need to wait for a driver update for your card.
2011-03-28T18:41:00.000Z	hzroot		ok i wll thnx for help.
2011-03-28T18:42:00.000Z	alkaliv2	hzroot	I apologize that I don't have an answer for it.  You just bought a computer that was TOO amazing :)
