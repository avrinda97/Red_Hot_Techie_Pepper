2011-06-25T08:53:00.000Z	qin	jll	Are you trying to install java, any specific?
2011-06-25T08:53:00.000Z	qin	jll	Did you try: java (in other terminal)?
2011-06-25T08:55:00.000Z	qin	jll	Two, only? What happend if you press: Alt-Ctrl-F4 ?
2011-06-25T09:01:00.000Z	qin	jll	What? Just gave you shortcut to tty4 to see if java installed.
2011-06-25T09:02:00.000Z	qin	jll	Command: ps aux | grep apt
2011-06-25T09:03:00.000Z	jll	qin	you knew that it would boot me out of my desktop and make me have to reboot the computer. don't play innocent with me. it gave me a black screen with a commend prompt which I didn't know what to put in so I had to reboot.
2011-06-25T09:04:00.000Z	qin	jll	Alt-Ctrl-F7 to have Desktop back (you are still logged in)
2011-06-25T09:04:00.000Z	qin	jll	...
2011-06-25T09:06:00.000Z	jll	qin	I'm sorry then ok, it just pissed me off. I thought you did it on purpose. so anyway, it took me to a black screen, then what do I do from there?
2011-06-25T09:06:00.000Z	qin	jll	Alt-Ctrl-F1 to F6 for text terminals F7 and above gui, linux standart.
2011-06-25T09:07:00.000Z	qin	jll	ps aux | grep apt (you should see one line for grep process only, if not apt is hanging)
2011-06-25T09:08:00.000Z	qin	jll	Then: sudo apt-get update
2011-06-25T09:08:00.000Z	qin	jll	Yes
2011-06-25T09:10:00.000Z	jll	qin	E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
2011-06-25T09:11:00.000Z	qin	jll	sudo dpkg --configure -a (like it wants)
2011-06-25T09:12:00.000Z	qin	jll	Then: sudo apt-get update (it may still complain about lock)
2011-06-25T09:15:00.000Z	jll	qin	I upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04
2011-06-25T09:15:00.000Z	qin	jll	Just install newer Ubuntu, 10.04 or higher
2011-06-25T09:16:00.000Z	qin	jll	Your upgrade is broken
2011-06-27T03:50:00.000Z	qin	jll	Did you try: Alt-Space ?
2011-06-27T03:51:00.000Z	jll	qin	I can do it manually but I used to be able to just drag it and the "cube" would show and move it to the next desktop. all the options for that are gone.
