2012-07-11T02:37:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	unity
2012-07-11T02:37:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	unity 3d
2012-07-11T02:38:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	uuuh well, i dont know unity too well. poke some ppl here, they sure know
2012-07-11T02:44:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	maybe this helps? http://ubuntugenius.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/restore-missing-volume-button-to-system-tray-after-upgrade-to-ubuntu-12-04-gnome-3-classicfallback/
2012-07-11T02:44:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	I've been on that page
2012-07-11T02:44:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	oh no, it's not a match to yours i guess
2012-07-11T02:44:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	If I type  gnome-sound-applet, the processs starts, but nothing happens
2012-07-11T02:46:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	what have you changed that it went away?
2012-07-11T02:46:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	nothing
2012-07-11T02:46:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	as far as I know
2012-07-11T02:47:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	I just noticed it was gone, just like that. sounds works though. And the alert appears if I change the volume up or down.
2012-07-11T02:48:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	is there a way to edit the panel in unity? :/ i know nothing about unity, sorry
2012-07-11T02:49:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	it is said that right clicking with alt pressed (and super too, for unity 3d, which is my case) should do something peculiar, and launch the panel editor or something, but I haven't seen anything special when I do this shortcut
2012-07-11T02:50:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	look for pulseaudio maybe?
2012-07-11T02:51:00.000Z	kristenbb	i7c	how is it related ?
2012-07-11T02:51:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	pulseaudio is the soundserver on most linux distributions...
2012-07-11T03:18:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	dpkg --get-selections
2012-07-11T03:18:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	not possible that way.
2012-07-11T03:19:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	/var/log/apt/history.log
2012-07-11T03:19:00.000Z	i7c	kristenbb	shows pretty much what you want.
