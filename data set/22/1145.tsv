2010-09-19T10:32:00.000Z	Trian3		Hey, quick (and easy) question...  If Ubuntu freezes up on me, how do I fix it?  IOW, what's the Task Manager equivalent?
2010-09-19T10:33:00.000Z	Trian3		So, yeah...  dead app (I guess)
2010-09-19T10:33:00.000Z	Trian3		CompizConfig Settings Manager
2010-09-19T10:33:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	first you'd need to find the reason for the lockup. Can you still switch to a console with CTRL-ALT-F1? can you login from outside via ssh? does the num lock key change the LED on your keyboard? or is the machine _really_ frozen? check the log files in /var/log/syslog etc
2010-09-19T10:34:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	switch to console, that is.
2010-09-19T10:34:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	then your Ubuntu didnt freeze on you, but perhaps Gnome. Switch back to Gnome (ALT-F7) and try ALT-F1 - does the top menu get selected?
2010-09-19T10:36:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	 Yes, top menu is selected.
2010-09-19T10:36:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	please describe, what exactly froze
2010-09-19T10:37:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	 I was playing with one of the modules in CompizConfig Settings Manager -- Freely Transformable Windows, to be exact.  When I enabled one of the features, it appeared to froze.  Mouse wouldn't do anything except move around on screen.  It's locked in a closed-hand position, but I'm unable to click on anything.
2010-09-19T10:39:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	i see. If you can't kill the program due to a confused mouse, you can start a terminal via keyboard - ALT-F1 and enter "xkill" - then click the window, that is frozen. Tell me, if that worked.
2010-09-19T10:39:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	ALT-F2 sorry
2010-09-19T10:40:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	 I don't know if I can kill it.  What's the best way to try to do that?
2010-09-19T10:42:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	deselect the menu with ESC
2010-09-19T10:43:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	 Thanks.  Was trying everything (except that, of course)
2010-09-19T10:45:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	 Not looking good.  xkill doesn't appear to do anything.
2010-09-19T10:45:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	usually you get an x shaped mouse cursor. in your case, the cursor might not show, but still work. "try" to aim at the frozen window and do a left click. If that wont do, i can suggest another approach.
2010-09-19T10:47:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	 Hmmm, looks like I can interact with the application via the keyboard, so it's just the mouse that's locked up.
2010-09-19T10:47:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	lets kill the X server. Do you have important data not yet saved in any window?
2010-09-19T10:49:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	the "cool" way would to just kill the damaged process. For this you would switch to the console and use the ps command to find the PID and then use kill. The "simple" way is to brutally kill (restart) X - which can be done with ALT-SysRq(Print)-K - what shall it be?
2010-09-19T10:51:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	you should learn the "cool" method soon - its not really hard and makes more sense in many situations. Ask, if you wanna try it.
2010-09-19T10:52:00.000Z	Trian3	hmw	 Alright, that did the trick for now.  I'll make a note of the ps command and make sure to study up.
2010-09-19T10:53:00.000Z	hmw	Trian3	i usually do: ps -A | grep WHATISEARCHFOR
