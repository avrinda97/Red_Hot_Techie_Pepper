2008-07-06T22:32:00.000Z	thebishop		how can i configure ubuntu's automount service?
2008-07-06T22:33:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	that depends, in what way do you want to configure it?
2008-07-06T22:35:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	it mounts my HFS-formatted ipod as ro for users.  i've disabled journaling so rw should be available.  it works as root
2008-07-06T22:35:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	oh
2008-07-06T22:36:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	any ideas?
2008-07-06T22:38:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	you would have to add a line to your fstab file. the line should contain the UUID of your ipod and the "user" option. i can't describe the details, but look for info on fstab
2008-07-06T22:39:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	the problem i have with fstab is that ubuntu won't auto-create the mountpoint and show the device on the desktop/Places if i manually configure it
2008-07-06T22:40:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	AFAIK it will show up in Places if you mount it in the /media folder
2008-07-06T22:41:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	yeah, but i'd rather it autocreate the directory the way it currently does.  all i want to do is change the permissions/umask
2008-07-06T22:43:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	it will behave like you describe if you add the line to fstab.
2008-07-06T22:43:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	i already added the line, and it complains that the mount point does not exist (/media/ipod/)
2008-07-06T22:45:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	create it and you'll see something
2008-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	i want it to create the mount point when the device is connected and delete the directory when the device is removed.  this is the behavior for every other device i use, the only problem is its getting the permissions wrong for this one
2008-07-06T22:47:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	look, listen to me: create the folder and the icon will only show up when it's mounted. trust me on this one.
2008-07-06T22:48:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	as long as you added the ipods UUID to the fstab, you'll be fine
2008-07-06T23:09:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	it still says "read-only file system"
2008-07-06T23:05:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	it didn't work like you say.  i've got the UUID in fstab, and it mounts to /media/ipod but it doesn't have the permissions i want and the directory doesn't delete when disconnected.  Also, when i open /media/ipod, it says the name of the ipod in the file list, which is a little weird
2008-07-06T23:05:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	did you add the "user" option as i told you?
2008-07-06T23:06:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	this is what i have: UUID=CA2773E921F25AE8 /media/ipod hfsplus rw,exec,auto,users 0 0
2008-07-06T23:07:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	it's "user", not "users"
2008-07-06T23:12:00.000Z	thebishop	magnetron	also, these things aren't umounting properly.  i have 5 "Tom's Ipod"s on my desktop
2008-07-06T23:13:00.000Z	magnetron	thebishop	how did you unmount them?
