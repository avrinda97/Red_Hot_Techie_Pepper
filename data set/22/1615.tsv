2010-03-16T00:40:00.000Z	17SAAL01W		hi guys. I need some assistance with a partition copy, please. I want to migrate an OS on a 4G SD card to a new 8G SD.
2010-03-16T00:40:00.000Z	17SAAL01W		I partitioned the new disk ext4, set the boot flag  & then tried both (X being the source, Y being the target) `dd if=/dev/sdX1 of=/dev/sdY1`& `rsync -av /mount/source /mount/target`.
2010-03-16T00:40:00.000Z	17SAAL01W		In both cases I completed the copied, but the systems fails to boot (would've expected the dd to work OK). What did I miss?
2010-03-16T00:41:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	mbr
2010-03-16T00:41:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/=sdY count=1 bs=445
2010-03-16T00:42:00.000Z	17SAAL01W	meganerd	thanks. that copies it along withthe MBR?
2010-03-16T00:42:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/=sdY count=1 bs=447
2010-03-16T00:42:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	that only copies the MBR
2010-03-16T00:42:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	it leaves the partition table alone.  It is only copiying the first 447 bytes
2010-03-16T00:43:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	actually let me double check the number, I do this once or twice a year, and I always end up looking it up
2010-03-16T00:43:00.000Z	17SAAL01W	meganerd	assume do that *before* copying the rest of the partition?
2010-03-16T00:43:00.000Z	17SAAL01W	meganerd	thanks. appreciated
2010-03-16T00:43:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	it could be done after
2010-03-16T00:44:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	ha, I am 0 for 2, the byte count is 446
2010-03-16T00:45:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	you could always use dd or ddrescue to copy the first disk to the second and then resize the partition on the second to maximize the used space
2010-03-16T00:46:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	you may see people reference 512 byte count if you search with google, that will copy the partition table as well and will break the existing partition table (since the disk geometiries are different)
2010-03-16T00:49:00.000Z	17SAAL01W	meganerd	just to reiterate, I make use of `dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/=sdY count=1 bs=446` to copy the MBR & then juat a regular dd to copy the rest of the contents, or do I simply make use of ddrescue to do the whole thing?
2010-03-16T00:50:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	basically, since you already copied the partitions, you just need to do "dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/=sdY count=1 bs=446"
2010-03-16T00:50:00.000Z	17SAAL01W	meganerd	actually, I just reformatted the partition before hopping on IRC
2010-03-16T00:50:00.000Z	meganerd	17SAAL01W	alternatively, just use ddrescue to copy the whole thing, and then use parted or gparted to resize the partition
2010-03-16T00:51:00.000Z	17SAAL01W	meganerd	sweet, thanks
