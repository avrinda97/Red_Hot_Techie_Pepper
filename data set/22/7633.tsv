2006-03-18T13:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	or just have a poke around in */etc/group*
2006-03-18T13:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	you need to add new users to quite a few groups - eg audio for starters
2006-03-18T13:04:00.000Z	bet0x	Frogzoo	can u give your "id" for see the groups?
2006-03-18T13:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	just 'groups' perhaps
2006-03-18T13:04:00.000Z	bet0x	Frogzoo	what u mean?
2006-03-18T13:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	run 'groups' & see what groups you're in - add the same groups for new users (must be an easier way though)
2006-03-18T13:07:00.000Z	bet0x	Frogzoo	i dont know the correct groups
2006-03-18T13:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	that's why run groups to find out
2006-03-18T13:07:00.000Z	bet0x	Frogzoo	look this:
2006-03-18T13:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	run 'groups' from your initial user
2006-03-18T13:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	or just have a poke around in /etc/groups
2006-03-18T13:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bet0x	sudo gedit /etc/group   ?
