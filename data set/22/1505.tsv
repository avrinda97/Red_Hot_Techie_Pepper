If linux asks to skip the external drives, because they couldn't be found, add "noauto" to their fstab-entries
2011-09-09T20:18:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	rumpe1	that actually sounds good. but wouldnt noauto mean that i have to mount them manually? and my internal drive is set as the first drive to boot from
2011-09-09T20:19:00.000Z	rumpe1	[THC]AcidRain	noauto in fstab prevents mounting at boot-time, it doesn't prevent automount later
2011-09-09T20:19:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	rumpe1	that sounds like a perfect fix, hang on, let me do some googling
2011-09-09T20:22:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	rumpe1	so for example: UUID=1d112679-6e31-481f-86eb-f7ec25756183 /media/Server2  ext3  errors=noauto,remount-rw,users,user  0  0
2011-09-09T20:22:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		would this be correct?
2011-09-09T20:23:00.000Z	rumpe1	[THC]AcidRain	no, noauto has nothing to do with errors
2011-09-09T20:24:00.000Z	rumpe1	[THC]AcidRain	why "users,user" ?
2011-09-09T20:24:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		well that means any user can mount, and user can write? right?
2011-09-09T20:26:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		oh its group user
2011-09-09T20:26:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		lol
2011-09-09T20:27:00.000Z	rumpe1	[THC]AcidRain	man mount: "user: ordinary user can mount  [and only he can] unmount"  "users: allow every user to mount/unmount"
2011-09-09T20:28:00.000Z	rumpe1	[THC]AcidRain	why not just "defaults,users,noauto" ?
2011-09-09T20:28:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	rumpe1	and leave out the errors option?
2011-09-09T20:29:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	rumpe1	well honestly i had it somewhat the way you are telling me before hand. then i lost so much faith in myself i downloaded storage device manager from repos. and it added that information in there just like that
2011-09-09T20:29:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		and it was rated 4.5 stars
2011-09-09T20:29:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		so i assumed it knew a little more than i did
2011-09-09T20:32:00.000Z	rumpe1	[THC]AcidRain	i don't understand the error-option... why remount readwriteable, if there are some errors? usually you remount readonly (ro) for recovery.
2011-09-09T20:32:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	rumpe1	well i took that out. like i said, that is what storage device manager did, not me
2011-09-09T20:33:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	rumpe1	my next question for you. is why does it show under "Places" the device 2 times?
2011-09-09T20:33:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		yet in /media/ there is only 1 mount point for each one
2011-09-09T20:34:00.000Z	rumpe1	[THC]AcidRain	uh... that i don't know.
