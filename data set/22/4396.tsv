2009-02-09T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	depends on how you format ;)
2011-10-01T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	there is a ppa for it
2011-11-14T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	nice :)
2011-11-18T05:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ActionParsnip	I don't see how -f install is going to do anything for him.
2011-11-18T05:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	it will pull down the required deps (assuming they are available) to [f]ix the issue
2011-11-18T05:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ActionParsnip	There is no such package as 'python3.1'.  That's his problem.
2011-11-18T05:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	it may just be python or something else, the manifest in the deb will tell the OS what it needs
2011-11-18T05:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ActionParsnip	The package name is just python3.  The rest is in the version string only.
2011-11-18T05:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ActionParsnip	Right, I know that.  The deb he has is wrong.  It has a Depends line programmed in that is not satisfiable.
2011-11-18T05:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	lets see if the command works first
2011-11-18T05:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	lets see instead of assuming
2011-11-18T05:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	if it doesn't then we can move in a different way to if it does
2011-11-18T05:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ActionParsnip	There was a package named python3.1 in 10.04, which is what the deb was built for, but it no longer exists as such on 11.10.
2011-11-18T05:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	I see
2011-11-18T05:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.1/3.1.3-1ubuntu1/+build/2310554   seems one was built in March this year. Is this the same?
2011-11-18T05:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ActionParsnip	The reason being that Oneric has python3.2.  python3 is a metapackage that refers to the current version, and is what should be used as a dependency as such.  They skipped that step and depended directly, thus the problem.
2011-11-18T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	ahh, that makes sense
2011-11-18T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	thanks for clearing it up :)
2011-11-18T05:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ActionParsnip	See http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/python3 vs. http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/python3
2011-11-18T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	as long as people can explain stuff I'm up for learning :)
2011-11-18T05:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonyyarusso	+1
