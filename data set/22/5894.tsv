2011-10-24T11:18:00.000Z	bobdobbs		Does anyone know how to connect to a windows shared drive from ubuntu ?
2011-10-24T11:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 the filemamager is supposed to be able to browse the network and access shares
2011-10-24T11:20:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	In my case, nautilus shows a folder called 'windows network', attempts to connect to it fail.
2011-10-24T11:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 you can try entering the path to the share. ctrl-l then smb://server.ip.number/sharename
2011-10-24T11:21:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	I've tried that as well. I always get errors.
2011-10-24T11:21:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	I'll check now to see what the error is
2011-10-24T11:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 let me guess... windows 7?
2011-10-24T11:22:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	I don't think so. I think it's a 'windows server' somethingorother
2011-10-24T11:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 see if you can ping it. see if smbtree and findsmb show it also.
2011-10-24T11:23:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	ok. thanks.
2011-10-24T11:25:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	findsmb doesn't see anything. smbtree just asks for my root password, and then doesn't do anything.
2011-10-24T11:25:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	Howeve, the other windows machines in the house can see the share without problems
2011-10-24T11:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 you can run smbrtee as a user.
2011-10-24T11:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 can you even ping the server?
2011-10-24T11:26:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	ok... when I use it as a user, I get the same thing. It asks for my password, and then just returns
2011-10-24T11:28:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	Yeah, I've got no idea whats going on. I've been using linux for years, and I've never been able to connect to a windows share.
2011-10-24T11:29:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	In this case, I was able to connect for a while, after months of trying. But then I rebooted my computer, and I can't reconnect.
2011-10-24T11:29:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	ok. I'll do the basic network diagnostics...
2011-10-24T11:34:00.000Z	bobdobbs	dr_willis	random! It's working again.
2011-10-24T11:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 just started working on its one
2011-10-24T11:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 radom windows samba. ;0
2011-10-24T11:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	bobdobbs	 you may want to look into a upnp video server for video streaming
