2007-04-30T13:19:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	You're trying to upgrade a box from 6.06 -> 7.04?
2007-04-30T13:19:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	yes
2007-04-30T13:19:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	Over an SSH connection?  What happens if the network connection goes down?
2007-04-30T13:20:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	You've seen !upgrade ?
2007-04-30T13:20:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	from what I understood, the tool is supposed to be automated.. besides - it's headless
2007-04-30T13:21:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	Uuuum... do you have any form of non-network access?
2007-04-30T13:21:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	Because things *can* go wrong, and unless you've got non-network access, you won't be able to fix them.
2007-04-30T13:21:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	- I could wait a week to get home, and then plug a keyboard and monitor but it's a major hassle...
2007-04-30T13:22:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	Well, then update-manager is what you're after.  It's graphical, though.
2007-04-30T13:22:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	- oh, if things go wrong I'll fix them when I get home
2007-04-30T13:22:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	- I have no X
2007-04-30T13:22:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	The only upgrade tool I know of is upgrade-manager, which is GUI only.
2007-04-30T13:23:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	So, install X, or use the alternative route (sed -i s/dapper/edgy /etc/apt/sources.list)
2007-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	And, yes.  You *have* to go through Edgy (6.10).  Dapper -> Feisty is unsupported, and may break in annoying ways.
2007-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	- isn't it extremely likely that there will be breakage?
2007-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	thanks for that tip
2007-04-30T13:25:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	What, with the "s/dapper/edgy" followed by "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade"?  Not so much.  That's actually how I upgraded to Feisty
2007-04-30T13:25:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	I see
2007-04-30T13:28:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	- Cool. Do you generally recommend this upgrade for a server? (I have a specific reason to upgrade, but I'm just wondering wether it's worth it)
2007-04-30T13:28:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	I don't run servers.  At least, servers that aren't running Feisty :)
2007-04-30T13:29:00.000Z	Shwouchk	RAOF	were they always running fiesty?
2007-04-30T13:30:00.000Z	RAOF	Shwouchk	Yes, since December.  I annoyingly killed my SSH access at one point with an update :)
