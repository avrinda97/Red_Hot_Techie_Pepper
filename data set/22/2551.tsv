2009-05-22T08:12:00.000Z	lyrae	she_dyed	yes
2009-05-22T08:13:00.000Z	she_dyed	lyrae	do you see an nvidia icon on the system tray
2009-05-22T08:14:00.000Z	she_dyed	lyrae	yes run it, might give you the orientation you're looking for
2009-05-22T08:14:00.000Z	she_dyed	lyrae	are there any other entrues besides that
2009-05-22T08:15:00.000Z	lyrae	she_dyed	regarding nvidia? no, just this one
2009-05-22T08:16:00.000Z	she_dyed	lyrae	try it anyway, but it should be one that's obvious
2009-05-22T08:16:00.000Z	lyrae	she_dyed	am looking, but not finding =|
2009-05-22T08:16:00.000Z	she_dyed	lyrae	like keyword 'rotate;
2009-05-22T08:17:00.000Z	she_dyed	lyrae	did  you pay full price for it or was it off the bargain bin ;-)
2009-05-22T08:18:00.000Z	lyrae	she_dyed	eh? for the card? full price ;) although it's old (6600gt) because new one went bad (8800gtx)
