2008-07-20T17:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	Please keep it user friendly and dont do that
2008-07-20T17:30:00.000Z	jc-denton	Jack_Sparrow	i'm as friendly as ubuntu is user friendly to me :P
2008-07-20T17:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	Stop..
2009-01-04T20:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	You must follow the cycle up
2009-01-04T20:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	feisty has reached eol
2009-01-04T20:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	sudo do-release-upgrade
2009-01-04T20:52:00.000Z	jc-denton	Jack_Sparrow	it's not recommended to upgrade over ssh
2009-01-04T20:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	Over ssh.. I must have missed that
2009-01-04T20:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	Sorry, I was in the middle of another question at that time
2009-01-04T20:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	There are no quarantees...  Just have a good backup and follow the best advice you can find.. I dont do much remote work these days so I am not the person to ask
2009-01-04T21:02:00.000Z	jc-denton	Jack_Sparrow	yes, but i think i'm not the only person having this problem, so there should be a howto or something
2009-01-04T21:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jc-denton	Over ssh.. http://www.howtoforge.com/upgrade-ubuntu-7.04-server-to-7.10                 Is not recommended.. even if many people would like to do it
2009-01-04T21:07:00.000Z	jc-denton	Jack_Sparrow	the guide says pretty much what you told me, there is nothing how to ensure that it reboots correctly
