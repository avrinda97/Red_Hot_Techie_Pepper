2011-09-08T17:44:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	afterwards?
2011-09-08T17:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	 , you click on "Get Ubuntu " as oCean says
2011-09-08T17:57:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	oCean gave me the URL I was looking for.  I just couldn't (and still can't) find it anywhere on ubuntu.com. Even after clicking "Get Ubuntu". What did I miss?
2011-09-08T17:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	http://www.ubuntu.com/download
2011-09-08T17:58:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	Ok ... and then?
2011-09-08T17:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	 make your choice and click on it
2011-09-08T18:01:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	I wantes a live CD so I chose the middle one: "Try it from a CD ...". Then what's next? Where's the URL?
2011-09-08T18:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	 is there something wrond with your browser ?  http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download , click on "start download"
2011-09-08T18:04:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	That won't give an URL, would it?
2011-09-08T18:04:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	(The browser is Firefox on Ubuntu, btw.)
2011-09-08T18:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	 you're on irssi , why ? you can't download with that
2011-09-08T18:09:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	I didn't understand your last question. How's irssi related to me being not able to find the download URLs anywhere on ubunti.com?
2012-10-08T01:13:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	I need Chrome and the 11.3 Flash that is built-in.
2012-10-08T01:16:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	then you'll be stuck with using chrome exclusively , if you want to use websites with flash content
2012-10-08T01:17:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	I only want to use one website with flash.
2012-10-08T01:20:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	I didn’t use Flash before and I’m pretty sure I won’t. But I need it to run on that one website and there I need 11.3 which should ship with Google Chrome. I just son’t know how to activate it. It’s not listed under about:plugins.
2012-10-08T01:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	most websites use flash content , I suggest you install flashplayer from adobe rather than the repos , extract it and then place libflashplayer.so in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins , because chrome browsers look in that file for the flashplayer
2012-10-08T01:26:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	Adobe has no 11.3 for linux. Their latest is 11.3
2012-10-08T01:28:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	There are problems especially with that one website I need to use Flash on. They know about the problem with 11.2 and write about it on their site. Maybe over 9,000 users are affected.
2012-10-08T01:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vlt	i see, do windows users encounter problems there as well ?
2012-10-08T01:29:00.000Z	vlt	BluesKaj	I think no, because they can have newer Flash versions from Adobe.
