2004-12-29T08:04:00.000Z	domo		hi
2004-12-29T08:05:00.000Z	domo		when I try to install i get that error msg: make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-3-386/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.
2004-12-29T08:06:00.000Z	domo		I download the kernel source, make the modules and symbolic link but after that I have this message:  No rule to make target `Graphic'.  Stop.
2004-12-29T08:06:00.000Z	domo		Someone can help me to understand ?
2004-12-29T08:07:00.000Z	domo		hi Guardiann
2004-12-29T08:07:00.000Z	scoon	domo	what is the problem
2004-12-29T08:09:00.000Z	scoon	domo	all right.  you need to put them somewhere in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/
2004-12-29T08:09:00.000Z	scoon	domo	after that, do a depmod -a
2004-12-29T08:10:00.000Z	scoon	domo	well is there a README w/ the drivers you are getting ?
2004-12-29T08:11:00.000Z	scoon	domo	what is the site addy
2004-12-29T08:18:00.000Z	scoon	domo	you could look into alien is a deb that will install rpms
2004-12-29T08:19:00.000Z	scoon	domo	but i don't think that is a very good idea.
2004-12-29T08:19:00.000Z	scoon	domo	i think that may be a bit of a hack, i have never used alien so i don't know tho..............
2004-12-29T08:19:00.000Z	scoon	domo	use the kernel module.
2004-12-29T08:20:00.000Z	scoon	domo	start with the docs that come with a kernel source and then pose around from there.
2004-12-29T08:20:00.000Z	scoon	domo	doesn't your monitor have controls for that ?
2004-12-29T08:21:00.000Z	domo	scoon	witch kernel module ?
2004-12-29T08:22:00.000Z	scoon	domo	what do you mean by precise ?
2004-12-29T08:22:00.000Z	scoon	domo	in the kernel source tree there is a dir called Documentation, that is where i'd start looking first.
2004-12-29T08:24:00.000Z	domo	scoon	yes I am
2004-12-29T08:24:00.000Z	scoon	domo	so then you are using xfree
