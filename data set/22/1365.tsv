2010-10-03T00:26:00.000Z	pr0xy		hi, I'm having some issues with the live CD for the Ubuntu 10.10 beta.
2010-10-03T00:27:00.000Z	pr0xy		I'm going to try the disk again, give me a moment.
2010-10-03T00:28:00.000Z	pr0xy		okay, i'm starting the pc now.
2010-10-03T00:30:00.000Z	pr0xy		okay options are: "try ubuntu without installing", "install ubuntu", "Check disc for defects", "test memory", "boot from first hard disk"
2010-10-03T00:31:00.000Z	pr0xy		what do I need to do?
2010-10-03T00:32:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	if you want to try it out, pick the first option
2010-10-03T00:32:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	(that's always a good idea before installing, even if you're a veteran user)
2010-10-03T00:33:00.000Z	pr0xy	chrissharp123	I know, i have the ubuntu with the 5 dots on a purple screen.
2010-10-03T00:34:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	what's your issue, then - I guess I don't understand :-)
2010-10-03T00:35:00.000Z	pr0xy		Currently I have a really weird screen with a bunch of purple, green, pink, and black rectangles.
2010-10-03T00:36:00.000Z	pr0xy	chrissharp123	Currently I have a really weird screen with a bunch of purple, green, pink, and black rectangles. should I give a picture?
2010-10-03T00:37:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	no - that means that the X server is not cooperating with your video card
2010-10-03T00:37:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	do you know what kind of card you have?
2010-10-03T00:38:00.000Z	pr0xy	chrissharp123	it's an EVGA GT 240
2010-10-03T00:38:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	my other question is, have you decided for sure to install ubuntu on this computer?  If so, you can install with the alternate CD, then work out the problem (if present) after the installation
2010-10-03T00:38:00.000Z	chrissharp123		!alternate | pr0xy
2010-10-03T00:39:00.000Z	pr0xy	chrissharp123	it works just fine with 10.04. I have an external drive I boot 10.04 from, and I would like to run 10.10 on it.
2010-10-03T00:41:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	ah... well, 10.10 would still be expected to have issues, but there are some common problems with X and certain types of video cards (and many posts on the Ubuntu Forums about them)
2010-10-03T00:42:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	not familiar with your type of card so not sure which specifics to advise :-)
2010-10-03T00:42:00.000Z	pr0xy	chrissharp123	what should I do? wait until the 10th?
2010-10-03T00:43:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	it's safer to wait - I run it in VirtualBox because I like to see what's coming and to test things
2010-10-03T00:43:00.000Z	chrissharp123	pr0xy	in fact, I usually give a new release about a month to work out the final bugs - that may be just me
