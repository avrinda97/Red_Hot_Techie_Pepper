2012-02-28T13:57:00.000Z	prashs		I have installed ubuntu as wubi. Suddenly getting problem while loading - grub CLI comes and if i type boot it says no kernel found. How to resolve this? Thanks!!
2012-02-28T13:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	Are you still able to boot Windows?
2012-02-28T14:00:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Yes. I am able to
2012-02-28T14:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	Do you have any important files in your Wubi install?
2012-02-28T14:01:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: If i can recover some files, that will also be good.
2012-02-28T14:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	OK. Do you know where those files are within Ubuntu? It's pretty easy to backup the files from Wubi using an Ubuntu LiveCD/USB, and then I'd recommend doing a normal dual boot rather than using Wubi.
2012-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Ya i know the location. Do i need to know the exact device detail like sda etc or just location like /home/username/Desktop ?
2012-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: I know the latter one only.
2012-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	Just /home/username/Desktop/. More than that is needed to get at the files, but I can help you with everything else :)
2012-02-28T14:08:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Cool. Its enough if i get just one folder :)
2012-02-28T14:10:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Can i do like booting from USB Stick and try to get the device in which Ubuntu is installed and fetch the data?
2012-02-28T14:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	Yes. If you can do it soon I can walk you through it (I'm planning to go to sleep soon).
2012-02-28T14:12:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Have booted in USB
2012-02-28T14:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	OK. Can you pastebin the output of "sudo blkid"?
2012-02-28T14:13:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Just a sec. Right now in different maching. Will switch the internet to the ubuntu machine. be right back in 1 min.
2012-02-28T14:29:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Thats the link!!
2012-02-28T14:30:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: 59GB partition is the one were ubuntu is installed
2012-02-28T14:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	Those two outputs taken together seem impossible to me at the moment. I may be too tired to help.
2012-02-28T14:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	The thing that is confusing me is that you have an msdos partition table with 4 primary partitions, yet you somehow *also* have partittions 5 and 6 on the same drive. Maybe I'll be able to help you tomorrow when I'm more awake.
2012-02-28T14:40:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: Sure, thanks !! :) Will check the loopmount and the wubildr method till then :) Thanks for your help !!
2012-02-28T14:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prashs	Does the directory /vdisk/ exist?
2012-02-28T14:47:00.000Z	prashs	Jordan_U	: I created one manually
