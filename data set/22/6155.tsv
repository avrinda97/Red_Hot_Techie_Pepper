2007-04-26T15:06:00.000Z	kerik		anybody here know about .xsession-errors?
2007-04-26T15:06:00.000Z	kerik		I have problems with evolution mail client
2007-04-26T15:08:00.000Z	kerik		hey guys....anybody who can help me with an .xsession-error from evolution mail client?
2007-04-26T15:09:00.000Z	thingy	kerik	pastebin the specific part from .xsession-errors and paste the url, as well as a description of what it is you are doing in evolution and what happens
2007-04-26T15:10:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	will do..
2007-04-26T15:11:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	http://pastebin.ca/460106
2007-04-26T15:14:00.000Z	thingy	kerik	is the pastebin output a word for word copy of what is in the .xsession-errors file or did you manually type it into pastebin?
2007-04-26T15:15:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	the last line I have written myself...but the other is copy/pasted
2007-04-26T15:15:00.000Z	thingy	kerik	hmm
2007-04-26T15:17:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	why did you find my pastebin weird?
2007-04-26T15:18:00.000Z	thingy	kerik	its the "Plugin 'Spamassassin-udvidelsesmodul til spam' failed to load hook 'org.gnome.evolution.mail.junk:1.0'" line which is weird...that spamassassin-udvidelesmodul til spam bit looked like a typo
2007-04-26T15:19:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	hehe....sorry about that...the "typo" is danish for expansion module :)
2007-04-26T15:21:00.000Z	thingy	kerik	ah ok...also are you sure this is the only stuff being output in the file when you launch evolution? can you do this...tail -f ~/.xsession-errors in a term...make note of the last line... in another term, start evolution from the commandline and pastebin the output from the evolution command and the output from the tail -f comman
2007-04-26T15:23:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	http://pastebin.ca/460122
2007-04-26T15:25:00.000Z	thingy	kerik	and launching evo from a cmd line did not show any output after typing in the evo command? did it say anything like segfault?
2007-04-26T15:27:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	well...I get what I sent you...
2007-04-26T15:28:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	though must admit I am not too sure on how to start up the app from terminal...shouldn't it just be typing in evolution?
2007-04-26T15:28:00.000Z	thingy	kerik	yes...type in evolution into a terminal window and tell me what it does after you type it in
2007-04-26T15:30:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	of course you were right...
2007-04-26T15:31:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	http://pastebin.ca/460131
2007-04-26T15:32:00.000Z	kerik	thingy	great....solution near and I'm out of battery
