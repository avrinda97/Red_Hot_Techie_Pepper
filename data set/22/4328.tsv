2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	gp5st		jordan: err, i emant read/write
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	gp5st		and isn't it bad to have journaling off

2009-09-23T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	could just reboot
2011-05-04T23:36:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	/tmp isn't required to be mounted as tmpfs though
2011-05-04T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	anything you put in there is in tmpfs in a default install and will be lost on reboot. You will need the commands in rc.local to recreate them each boot
2011-05-04T23:41:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	yes, i know that.  I would like to create a memory resident file that isn't in a tmpfs mount
2011-05-04T23:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	ok run: mount  use a tmpfs from that list (not /proc)
2012-10-30T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	so like a disk image file, which is loop mounted?
2012-10-30T18:14:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	yes
2012-10-30T18:14:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	the only thing i can think of is having a compressed disk image inside an encrypted one
2012-10-30T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	qcow2   in qemu states it is compressed and encrypted, maybe you can make the image with that. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/qemu-img.1.html   could aybe be used in Ubuntu. Not something I've ever done as I don't wear a tinfoil hat
2012-10-30T18:16:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	I want to keep my gnucash on a thumbdrive, so it's not _that_ tinfoil hatty
2012-10-30T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	why not format the partition to use encrypted file system then put your file onto the device, should be ok
2012-10-30T18:18:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	I'm considering mirroring it on a network drive as well, so i'd prefer a single file
2012-10-30T18:23:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	qemu-img: Compression and encryption not supported at the same time :(
2012-10-30T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	i see
2012-10-30T18:26:00.000Z	gp5st	ActionParsnip	Maybe the solution is to only keep so many days of logs instead of an unlimited number and just use an encrypted image
2012-10-30T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gp5st	its not something I've ever had to use, maybe others can advise. All I can say is the encrypted file system can be used on the USB device
