2008-04-22T08:03:00.000Z	n-iCe		any wireless manager?!?!?!?
2008-04-22T08:04:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	try searching for wicd. A friend of mine told me that is the only wireless manager he ever really got to work on his Gutsy laptop
2008-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	If your windows lost all their borders, hit alt-f2 and type "metacity --replace" (without quotes)
2008-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	by windows, I meant your linux programs, not the OS.
2008-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 oh, why is this happening everytime I reboot or shutdown the pc???
2008-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	Probably a problem with Compiz
2008-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 I don't use compiz
2008-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	Well then I honestly wouldn't know
2008-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 ok, how can I set the command to work when ubuntu starts?
2008-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	By "don't use Compiz" do you mean you disabled it, or you just haven't install the settings manager for it
2008-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	because if you are using 7.10, then it will use compiz by default unless you specifically disable it
2008-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 oh yeah it is there, why
2008-04-22T09:23:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	I can't remember off the top of my head how to disable compiz
2008-04-22T09:25:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 I don't want to disable it I want to fix the title bears problem
2008-04-22T09:26:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	the title bars aren't working either because you messed with the compiz settings or compiz just isn't working right
2008-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	you could try reinstalling compiz
2008-04-22T09:28:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 how
2008-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	Try right-clicking on your Desktop and click change Desktop Background, then go to Visual Effects and choose Non. That should disable Compiz, but I don't know if it will still work after you reboot
2008-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 I don't want to disable compiz
2008-04-22T09:30:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	Another option is to install the Settings manager for compiz and then set up the Crash handler plugin for Compiz which would automatically start metacity if compiz were to fail
2008-04-22T09:35:00.000Z	undecim	n-iCe	rc.local is a script run on boot, but if you are trying to add the metacity command there, It won't work, because there won't be an X server to run it
2008-04-22T09:35:00.000Z	n-iCe	undecim	 no it is different /etc/modules example I don't remember
