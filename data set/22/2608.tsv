2010-03-08T02:47:00.000Z	dAnjou		hi, the window decorations of the new theme i want to use were not updated. what can i do? (9.10 + gnome)
2010-03-08T02:49:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	do they look wrong, are they not there at all, what's the issue exactly?
2010-03-08T02:49:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	they look like the ones i had before
2010-03-08T02:50:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	maybe the theme you chose doesn't include window borders and has gtk2 only? or did you install emerald at any point in history and does that still draw the borders?
2010-03-08T02:51:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	hmmm
2010-03-08T02:56:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	this is the theme → http://www.bisigi-project.org/?p=55&lang=en
2010-03-08T02:57:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	and i don't remember that i ever installed emerald
2010-03-08T02:57:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	no, emerald is not installed
2010-03-08T02:57:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	ok, it also has a metacity theme; in appearance, click customize, then the borders tab, try to apply them
2010-03-08T02:59:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	nothing changed
2010-03-08T03:00:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	if you run "metacity --replace" in a terminal, does that change anything?
2010-03-08T03:01:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	i use compiz → should i do 'compiz --replce'?
2010-03-08T03:02:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	well, metacity --replace will indeed kill compiz for the moment, but compiz may also be the issue; else install fustion-icon, run that, it will show in the systray, right click and choose gtk as window decorator
2010-03-08T03:02:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	i'll try
2010-03-08T03:02:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	fusion-icon I mean btw
2010-03-08T03:08:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	again, nothing
2010-03-08T03:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	check the folder of the theme in /usr/share/themes or ~/.themes
2010-03-08T03:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	if there is a metacity folder inside, it should work by now; else try the metacity --replace command and check for sensible error output; do "compiz --replace" to get back to compiz
2010-03-08T03:14:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	there is a metacity folder and i changed to metacity and switched between some themes, but the borders are still the wrong ones
2010-03-08T03:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	last shot, then I'm off to bed: if you do "ps -ef | grep [g]nome-settings-daemon" is that daemon running?
2010-03-08T03:17:00.000Z	VCoolio	dAnjou	ok, then I'm out of options now sorry; maybe someone else here can pick it up
2010-03-08T03:17:00.000Z	dAnjou	VCoolio	thanks anyway :)
