2012-04-27T22:09:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	do you have an actual support wquestion?
2012-04-27T22:09:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	yes, how can I quickly access my running applications via the UI?
2012-04-27T22:10:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	click on the icon in the launchbar maybe?
2012-04-27T22:11:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	if the application is running it will have an arrow beside it, if there are more than 1 window open for an application double click the icon, then click oh the diaplayed window that you want.
2012-04-27T22:48:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	I missed your answer
2012-04-27T22:49:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	 <wylde> dsfsd: click on the icon in the launchbar maybe? <wylde> dsfsd: if the application is running it will have an arrow beside it, if there are more than 1 window open for an application double click the icon, then click oh the diaplayed window that you want.
2012-04-27T22:50:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	when I double click on the icon (it's crap that you have to double click) I have to wait a good few seconds before anything hapens
2012-04-27T22:50:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	is there a way to do this without three clicks and 10 seconds?
2012-04-27T22:51:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	alt + tab not working for you? Other than that if you're using 3d and lagging that badly try unity2d?
2012-04-27T22:51:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	I don't want to use keyboard shortcuts, nor does anyone else that uses this machine. We just want a nice ui
2012-04-27T22:52:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	plus, we're running dual atu cards on a 16 gb (ram) dual core machine ... it should not lag
2012-04-27T22:52:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	then try unity2d. Or make sure you are using the correct driver for your graphics chipset.
2012-04-27T22:52:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	check and check
2012-04-27T22:53:00.000Z	dsfsd	wylde	we also have this issue on an intel laptop
2012-04-27T22:53:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	possibly you may find some useful info there, I only use nvidia cards. They seem to have better (although not perfect) support in linux.
2012-04-27T22:54:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	then perhaps the following will be of interest.
2012-04-27T22:55:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	the factoid needs updating but covvers what you need if you want to use a UI more closely matching gnome2.
2012-04-27T22:56:00.000Z	wylde	dsfsd	or if you want a lighter desktop you may want to check out ....
