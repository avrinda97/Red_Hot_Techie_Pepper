2012-03-01T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	precisepangolin	its only in dev right now, its open source
2012-03-01T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	precisepangolin	there is #ubuntu-phone where you can discuss and speculate the project but there isn't much on it right now
2012-03-01T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	precisepangolin	when you ask for information, try giving full details rather than just a few words, it makes things a LOT quicker and people don't have to milk tiny fragments of info from you
