2007-01-23T08:22:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	right click on a pdf then go to properties and change the open with
2007-01-23T08:22:00.000Z	livingtm	bruenig	that only seems to do it the one time, then goes back to evince the next time
2007-01-23T08:23:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	it shouldn't, make sure you go to properties when you change it
2007-01-23T08:23:00.000Z	livingtm	bruenig	OH the properties page.. thanks!
2007-04-12T05:20:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	yes
2007-04-12T05:20:00.000Z	livingtm	bruenig	any way to prove that its working, or find errors if its not?
2007-04-12T05:20:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	runs at 6:25 each morning theoretically
2007-04-12T05:21:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	put something in the script that you can check like add "echo test > /test" or something tha is what I usually do
2007-04-12T05:21:00.000Z	livingtm	bruenig	okay thanks
2007-04-12T05:22:00.000Z	livingtm	bruenig	interesting, if i run the script from the terminal it works fine, but it hasnt fired for the past 3 days
2007-04-12T05:23:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	root
2007-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	the ones in /etc/cron.daily do at least
2007-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	there is a user crontab that you can access with crontab -e
2007-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	livingtm	bruenig	do the scripts in cron.daily execute sequentially or in parallel?
2007-04-12T05:28:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	nothing executes in parallel technically
2007-04-12T05:28:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	it executes through the command run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily
2007-04-12T05:28:00.000Z	bruenig	livingtm	so man run-parts and see what exactly that means
2007-04-12T05:38:00.000Z	livingtm	bruenig	turns out your cron - actuated scripts cannot have a "." in the name!
