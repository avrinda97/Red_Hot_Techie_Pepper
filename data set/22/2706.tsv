2009-03-30T01:54:00.000Z	gearsecond		i dont have sound in xubuntu
2009-03-30T01:54:00.000Z	gearsecond		what should i do?
2009-03-30T01:55:00.000Z	gearsecond		yes because hardware requires xubuntu
2009-03-30T01:55:00.000Z	gearsecond		ive got only 224 mb ram
2009-03-30T01:56:00.000Z	gearsecond		although i ve a 2.6 Ghz Intel Celeron
2009-03-30T01:56:00.000Z	gearsecond		but i cant make run Ubuntu
2009-03-30T01:57:00.000Z	gearsecond		I dont know
2009-03-30T01:57:00.000Z	gearsecond		no bcaus ubuntu demands a minimum of 394 mb ram
2009-03-30T01:57:00.000Z	gearsecond		¬¬
2009-03-30T01:57:00.000Z	Flannel	gearsecond	No, just the Desktop CD
2009-03-30T01:58:00.000Z	gearsecond		i tried to install ubuntu bt it was hanged
2009-03-30T01:58:00.000Z	gearsecond		so i installed xubuntu
2009-03-30T01:58:00.000Z	gearsecond		but in up to try the 7,10
2009-03-30T01:58:00.000Z	Flannel	gearsecond	That's fine.  Xubuntu is just as good.
2009-03-30T01:59:00.000Z	gearsecond		xubuntu
2009-03-30T01:59:00.000Z	gearsecond		no
2009-03-30T01:59:00.000Z	gearsecond		but xubuntu is also giving me troubles
2009-03-30T01:59:00.000Z	gearsecond		cuz it gets hanged
2009-03-30T01:59:00.000Z	gearsecond		i supose that its because of the ram memory
2009-03-30T01:59:00.000Z	Flannel	gearsecond	That's not a likely cause.
2009-03-30T02:00:00.000Z	gearsecond	Flannel	then what it could be?
2009-03-30T02:01:00.000Z	Flannel	gearsecond	No idea.  But not RAM issues. (well, unless the RAM is going bad)
