2008-11-21T23:50:00.000Z	nbeebo		akrtvrvs: i fixed it before but i cannot remember exactly
2008-11-21T23:51:00.000Z	nbeebo		ok thanks, anyone know how to fix the black bootscreen problem?
2008-11-21T23:52:00.000Z	nbeebo		i did Xorg -configure and it told me /root
2008-11-21T23:52:00.000Z	nbeebo		when u go rescue mode and cd u start in /root so i guess thats why
2008-11-21T23:52:00.000Z	nbeebo		i know but i cd to / i didnt know where i was so...
2008-11-21T23:53:00.000Z	nbeebo		is it possible to use bash in irssi?
2008-11-21T23:53:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	is a shell, irssi is an irc client - what do you mena
2008-11-21T23:55:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	how do you expect to use a shell in an irc chat channel ?
2008-11-22T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	open anoother terminal
2008-11-22T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	thats what xwindows is for, or tty's
2008-11-22T00:02:00.000Z	nbeebo	ikonia	i know but then i need to copy paste everything.. anyway back to fixing
2008-11-22T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	you'd have to copy and paste if you had nano within irssi as the two programs are seperate
2008-11-22T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	I get the impression your being %100 honest about what you want
2008-11-22T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	you can stop asking every 10 seconds
2008-12-02T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	yes and he was told with gparted
2008-12-02T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	/msg it
2008-12-11T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	none of this is anything to do with linux or ubuntu, so use the proper support resources
2008-12-11T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	nbeebo	this is for ubuntu related support only
