2006-12-26T17:56:00.000Z	skenmy		under the name "HDA ULI M5461"
2006-12-26T17:56:00.000Z	skenmy		I have no idea. Haven't changed anything
2006-12-26T17:56:00.000Z	skenmy		Still no sound though.
2006-12-26T17:57:00.000Z	skenmy		It can't be my Audigy. alsamixer says the chip is a Realtek (which is my onboard audio)
2006-12-26T17:57:00.000Z	skenmy		but channels are up
2006-12-26T17:58:00.000Z	skenmy		Yes - My card is *not* listed there.
2006-12-26T17:59:00.000Z	skenmy		lspci shows the card exists
2006-12-26T17:59:00.000Z	skenmy		Device Manager shows the card
2006-12-26T17:59:00.000Z	skenmy		I've never had issues before :P
2006-12-26T06:00:00.000Z	skenmy		Hence why i'm so confused
2006-12-26T06:02:00.000Z	flossgeek	skenmy	type this into terminal:cat /proc/asound/cards
2006-12-26T06:03:00.000Z	skenmy		"Command not found"
2006-12-26T06:03:00.000Z	skenmy		apparently
2006-12-26T06:03:00.000Z	skenmy		oh hang on
2006-12-26T06:03:00.000Z	skenmy		that was me being stupid :P
2006-12-26T06:04:00.000Z	skenmy		2 cards listed. Onboard audio and a USB Device
2006-12-26T06:04:00.000Z	flossgeek	skenmy	we need to see why it isnt being detected
2006-12-26T06:04:00.000Z	skenmy		Okay
2006-12-26T06:08:00.000Z	skenmy	flossgeek	and...how would we do that?
2006-12-26T06:11:00.000Z	flossgeek	skenmy	I am looking into this issue, but I think it would be best to post to the forums or mailing list for your issue than here
2006-12-26T06:12:00.000Z	skenmy	flossgeek	- okay thanks :)
2006-12-26T06:13:00.000Z	flossgeek	skenmy	Cause you could switch back to dapper
