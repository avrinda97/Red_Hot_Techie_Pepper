2009-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	fccf	howie	you are compiling asterisk?
2009-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	howie	fccf	yes
2009-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	fccf	howie	you are aware that it is avalable in the repositorys?
2009-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	howie	fccf	 how do i check that?
2009-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	fccf	howie	this is on a gui machine?
2009-07-16T08:27:00.000Z	howie	fccf	no its 32bit server but after i go threw and know how to config im installing on my main server
2009-07-16T08:29:00.000Z	fccf	howie	start with sudo apt-get update then apt-cache search asterisk ... these will be the avaliable packages for asterisk and figure out what you 'need' obviously you won't need everything but you will have a list .... then sudo apt-get install asterisk
2009-07-16T08:31:00.000Z	howie	fccf	iv already updated and i already installed the ncurses-dev but its still not registering
2009-07-16T08:33:00.000Z	fccf	howie	have you even tried using the repository ... sudo apt-get install asterisk ... if it needs ncurses-dev and you have it installed then your version of asterisk is not the right version to be using with that particular ncurses ... the asterisk from the repository will work with the local ncurses-dev .. cause it was packaged that way
2009-07-16T08:34:00.000Z	howie	fccf	ok ill give it another try
2009-07-16T08:34:00.000Z	fccf	howie	make sure you have the universe repository enabled
2009-07-16T08:34:00.000Z	howie	fccf	how do i do that?
2009-07-16T08:35:00.000Z	fccf	howie	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-07-16T08:37:00.000Z	fccf	howie	even easier .. sudo apt-get install pastebinit ... then pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-07-16T08:56:00.000Z	howie	fccf	you get a chance to look over that pastbin?
2009-07-16T08:57:00.000Z	fccf	howie	yeah ... asterisk should install with no problems using ... sudo apt-get install asterisk
2009-07-16T08:57:00.000Z	howie	fccf	and the zaptel and libpri?
2009-07-16T08:59:00.000Z	fccf	howie	same with those .... all available pre-compiled in a repository for anyone to use
2009-07-16T08:59:00.000Z	howie	fccf	alright ty
