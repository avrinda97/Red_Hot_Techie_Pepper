2009-07-12T15:39:00.000Z	nikolas23		i'd like to ask you, I have a problem. Whenever I install dkms package, I get a disk error at startup (UNC error). I need dkms in order to use nvidia drivers. If I don't install them, my computer graphics suck!
2009-07-12T15:40:00.000Z	nikolas23		can I make synaptic install dkms at another part of the disk, which is not ruined?
2009-07-12T15:41:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	I though you didn't have to install dkms normally, it works with just pulling in the the nvidia driver...
2009-07-12T15:42:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	If the disk is defective, run fsck (sudo touch /forcefsck  and reboot)
2009-07-12T15:43:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	I tried to run fsck but when it finds the bad sector it stops
2009-07-12T15:43:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	synaptic says dkms is needed to get nvidia drivers installed
2009-07-12T15:44:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	ok, does fsck say anything else (at that point you might have to boot up on a livecd and run fsck with some parameters)
2009-07-12T15:45:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	hmm, I guess dkms is installed by default per standard...
2009-07-12T15:46:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	it says something about cleaning orphaned i node #####
2009-07-12T15:46:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	then hopefully no disk errors...
2009-07-12T15:47:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	but at startup, the bar for ubuntu loading freezes and I get errors
2009-07-12T15:48:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	{DRDY ERR} and then error:{UNC}
2009-07-12T15:48:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	I don't know if this helps, but I had Vista and formatted the partition. Is there any chance Ubuntu used windows files that now don't exist?
2009-07-12T15:49:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	It was a dual boot
2009-07-12T15:53:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	very unlikey I think... I'd still say you could try running fsck from a livecd (fsck -f to force even if it's marked as clean)
2009-07-12T15:56:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	I will try what you said. It will sound funny, but if I moved the partition (with a livecd) to other disk sectors, will the disk errors dkms generated disappear?
2009-07-12T15:57:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	possibly, I don't really know... maybe the errors crop up in another application then... *really has no idea*
2009-07-12T15:59:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	If fsck runs good, I'd suspect something else than disk fail though...
2009-07-12T15:59:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	oh, you think? I'm pissed off because I desperately wanted to get rid off Windows and all its problems, and now I think linux destroyed my hard disk and I may have to change it **pay**! god!
2009-07-12T16:00:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	to speak the truth, I think I had tried fsck but it couldn't run because of disk errors. However, i'll try it again
2009-07-12T16:01:00.000Z	arand	nikolas23	That's when it's good to run fsck from the outside, so to speak, livecd or otherwise.
2009-07-12T16:02:00.000Z	nikolas23	arand	i'll try it and i'll see what happens
