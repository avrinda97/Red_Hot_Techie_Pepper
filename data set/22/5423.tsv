2007-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	err... internal I think, it's the one that is stuck in my pc and is not removeable
2007-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	it should be that easy, is the drive NTFS?
2007-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	nope, ext3
2007-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	it says I have not the acccfes to write to it when i try to write to it
2007-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	external or internal?
2007-05-11T05:55:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	kde (kubuntu) or gnome (ubuntu)?  kubuntu has a "change read write" mode option, I'm just checking which you have
2007-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	It's gnome
2007-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	ubuntu
2007-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	try "sudo mount -a"
2007-05-11T05:57:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	first unmount the partition/drive "sudo umount /mountpoint"
2007-05-11T05:58:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	then try "sudo mount -a"  just checking, you aren't talking about your root partition, are you?
2007-05-11T05:59:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	: Not anymore, I fragmented that drive (it  was my root before), but then I reinstalled ubuntu and it's just a normal "media"-drive now
2007-05-11T06:00:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	: what should I see when i "sudo mount -a"
2007-05-11T06:01:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	ext3 doesn't really get fragmented.  it could be read only if there are problems with the drive or partition, that's happened to me before.  mount -a shouldn't return anything, it just mounts everything
2007-05-11T06:01:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	:one line from the return of mount all command "FUSE mount point creation failed"
2007-05-11T06:02:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	it says a bit more things too
2007-05-11T06:03:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	still not working after "sudo mount -a" ,i still dont have write access
2007-05-11T06:03:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	not sure, it's a bit past me with that error, sounds like something your PC is trying to mount can't be mounted
2007-05-11T06:03:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	it could be partition/drive problems that prevents write access, but I'm not sure
2007-05-11T06:03:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	: ok I can try ask someone else later
2007-05-11T06:04:00.000Z	bobbob1016	lbawinowns	sorry I couldn't help more
2007-05-11T06:04:00.000Z	lbawinowns	bobbob1016	you tried :), it's very nice of you anyway :)
