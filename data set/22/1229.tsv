2010-12-18T00:58:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	is your monitor connected with a dvi or vga
2010-12-18T00:58:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	duh, just got that
2010-12-18T00:58:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	sorry, I need to read better
2010-12-18T00:59:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	is it only happening when things move?
2010-12-18T00:59:00.000Z	matthiaskrgr	balloooza	when I start the pc (booting) short before the login screen is shown, there also is a *interesting* colorswitching but after a few secs everything is fine
2010-12-18T00:59:00.000Z	matthiaskrgr	balloooza	I don't know how to reproduce itm it appeared to raise from nothing
2010-12-18T01:00:00.000Z	matthiaskrgr	balloooza	could it be a internal hardware defect?
2010-12-18T01:00:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	How often will it happen
2010-12-18T01:00:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	and yes, that is possible but not likely
2010-12-18T01:02:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	so whtat is the problem then, I am a little confused now, is it just like something that happens and requires you to reboot
2010-12-18T01:02:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	it was an external monitor?
2010-12-18T01:02:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	hmm, so when does this happen besides login
2010-12-18T01:04:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	actualy I just helped someone with an Nvidia problem, but their screen blacked out when they went to the side
2010-12-18T01:04:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	I was not able to come up with a solution, but it was related to nvidia drivers
2010-12-18T01:04:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	Yes like move your mouse to the side of the screen
2010-12-18T01:06:00.000Z	balloooza	matthiaskrgr	Did you look on google to see if anyone else has your peoblem
2010-12-18T01:09:00.000Z	matthiaskrgr	balloooza	http://pastebin.com/wK4tmt9D dunno whether it helps
