2005-08-29T15:41:00.000Z	can-o-worms		i have a samba share on a ubuntu box that i can access with linux or windows, but not from osx... i know there is nothing wrong with the osx box because it can access a samba share on a gentoo box i have .... anyone seen anything like this?
2005-08-29T08:01:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	"everyone"?
2005-08-29T08:02:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	like all the official vendor supplied drivers in the kernel? ;)
2005-08-29T08:02:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	like the nvidia drivers?
2005-08-29T08:02:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	they are not in the kernel, they are distributed seperately
2005-08-29T08:02:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	I mean things like e100 and aic7xxx, which are supplied by Intel and Adaptec respectively
2005-08-29T08:02:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	or the philips webcam?
2005-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	when did philips submit an official driver to kernel.org?
2005-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	or the via raid stuff?
2005-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	what via raid stuff?
2005-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	exactly
2005-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	you are misunderstanding what I am saying
2005-08-29T08:04:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	my point was that when vendors submit drivers to the kernel they are not dismissed by anyone
2005-08-29T08:04:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	so long as they are open source they aren't
2005-08-31T07:20:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	in the top level of the kernel source check for a .config file and move it out of the way
2005-08-31T07:21:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	i can do that... but i downloaded the source from kernel.org, but it still managed to find all this crap from somewhere
2005-08-31T07:21:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	that's quite odd, I don't think it should be doing that
2005-08-31T07:23:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	it did it again, i moved .config, but it still knows
2005-08-31T07:24:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	hmm, I'm just wondering if it's the default config and looks like the ubuntu one
2005-08-31T07:25:00.000Z	can-o-worms	Ng	not a chance, i have some pretty specific stuff set up in the graphics support section for a matrox card
2005-08-31T07:26:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	that's really odd. There is a feature in new kernels to expose the running config in /proc/config.gz or something like that, but I don't think the vanilla kernel source is supposed to look for it
2005-08-31T07:27:00.000Z	Ng	can-o-worms	you could dig around in arch/i386/ and find a more default config
