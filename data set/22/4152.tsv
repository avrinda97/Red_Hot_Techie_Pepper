2008-03-03T12:32:00.000Z	Antkin	hellpme1	you do not nead to buy a new hard drive. Try a free data destruction program like Erazer and fully wipe your old hard drive then start again
2008-03-03T12:36:00.000Z	Antkin	hellpme1	Is your old harddrive 20 Gig or more?
2008-03-03T12:37:00.000Z	hellpme1	Antkin	37.26gig
2008-03-03T12:39:00.000Z	Antkin	hellpme1	37.26 gig is a good size to dual boot on
