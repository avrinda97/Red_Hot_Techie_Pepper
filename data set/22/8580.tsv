2005-08-04T16:30:00.000Z	w-mute		Phil: which list?
2005-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	w-mute		Phil: some programs (especially graphical ones) should show up in the Applications menu. Other (e.g. shell programs) don't.
2005-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	w-mute		Phil: but you can create Launchers for the programs that don't get added to the menu.
2005-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	w-mute		Phil: A launcher is an icon that is linked to an application.
2005-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	w-mute		Hi. Should it show up in strace if a programm loads/accesses a library?
2005-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	yes loads, no accesses
2005-08-04T06:36:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	maybe you want ltrace?
2005-08-04T06:36:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	good question. *check*
2005-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	so if I do "strace drip" how come that drip complains about lack of libdvdcss but no load of that lib
2005-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	gaaa! That line was not complete ... please give me a second try.
2005-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	depends how it's trying to load it
2005-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	so if I do "strace drip" how come that drip complains about lack of libdvdcss but no load of that lib shows up in strace or ltrace?
2005-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	I'd expect a stat to appear ta least
2005-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	I was hoping to see something like this, too.
2005-08-04T06:40:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	the issue is that drip suggests a recompile to solve that libdvdcss problem and I'm so not sure why Ubuntu would ship a program that needs a recompile to actually work.
2005-08-04T06:40:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	er, because most countries have dumb dumb laws?
2005-08-04T06:41:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	but wouldn't that also apply to libdvdcss.so (I mean, come on - they also ship the library).
2005-08-04T06:41:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	no, ubuntu does not ship that
2005-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	Hmm. Where did I get that library from, then? *check* ...
2005-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	it's in marillat's repository
2005-08-04T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	w-mute	anyway, if drip doesn'yt know how to dlopen it at run time, you could file a bug asking that it do that
2005-08-04T06:43:00.000Z	w-mute	bob2	good idea. Thanks for your help.
