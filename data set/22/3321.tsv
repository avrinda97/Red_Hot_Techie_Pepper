2009-02-06T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zj3t3mju	if you look at your nic devices in network places, is the device disabled

2009-02-06T15:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zj3t3mju	try heading into device manager and uninstalling the device, then click scan for new hardware to see if it jumps into life
2009-02-06T15:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zj3t3mju	if you have wake on lan for ubuntu it will be holding the device waiting for the magic packet
