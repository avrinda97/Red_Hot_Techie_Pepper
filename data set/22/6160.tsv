2008-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	xibalba		hey i just installed ubuntu 6.06lts, i know if i change my IP which is currently getting it's net info via DHCP it will break sudo. how should i go about preventing breaking sudo when i want to change my IP?
2008-01-15T11:11:00.000Z	xibalba		so how can i switch ips without breaking SUDO
2008-01-15T11:11:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	it breaks sudo? what?
2008-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	maybe you typoed something?  I've changed IP's a lot from static to dhcp, etc and never broken sudo.
2008-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	if you can stick around in 10 minutes i'll change it and reboot it and show you what i mean
2008-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	yeah grab some error messages and stuffs
2008-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	does an apt-get upgrade grab the latest kernel too ?
2008-01-15T12:16:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	what does uname -a give you?  Are you on the latest kernel?  Mine usually updates automatically for me when needed through the update manager
2008-01-15T12:17:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	it says, Linux ubuntu 2.6.15-26-server #1 SMP Thu Aug 3 04:09:15 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
2008-01-15T12:17:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	is this the most up2date version?
2008-01-15T12:18:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	no, at least, I'm on 2.6.22-14
2008-01-15T12:18:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	, so how do i go about updating the kernel? when i do apt-get upgrade it says it isn't doing the pkg linux-image-server
2008-01-15T12:19:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	oh, just do like dist-upgrade and I think that will then do it for you.
2008-01-15T12:19:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	instead of just upgrade
2008-01-15T12:20:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	what is the diff between dist-upgrade and upgrade?
2008-01-15T12:20:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	check the man page for more details, but in short  in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages
2008-01-15T12:21:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	any huge security issue in the kernel between these 2 ersion?s
2008-01-15T12:22:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	ummm nothing major that I"ve ever seen.  I'm sure there are minor fixes here and there, but I haven't heard of a major kernel issue that has affected a normal user in a while actually.  I don't know.
2008-01-15T12:23:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	great, i'm going to put my secondary mail server on ubuntu 6.06lts. i have high hopes from it
2008-01-15T12:24:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	lol Debian
2008-01-15T12:24:00.000Z	dxdt	xibalba	that is the whole joke with Debian, nothing changes ever
2008-01-15T12:24:00.000Z	xibalba	dxdt	coming from BSD land i dont like things ot change too often
