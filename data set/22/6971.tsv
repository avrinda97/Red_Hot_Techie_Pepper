2006-09-25T12:53:00.000Z	bartmon		Hi. What's the deal with so many kernel updates? I have 2.6.15-26.47 and 2.6.15-27.48 listed as upgradeable.
2006-09-25T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	bug fixes
2006-09-25T12:56:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	OK, so the newest kernel is definitely the way to go. But why is the old version also shown then?
2006-09-25T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	shows where?
2006-09-25T12:57:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	under possible updates
2006-09-25T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	I'm not sure.  That seems odd though.
2006-09-25T12:58:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	Yeah. If i view updates via the GUI Update Manager it shows 10 upgrades but via aptitude it only shows 6 upgrades.
2006-09-25T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	that's very odd.  You might file a bug about it.
2006-09-25T12:59:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	Bah, I'm using a custom compiled kernel anyway :P
2006-09-25T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	I believe the make-sans-BE error is 'cannot create executables'
2007-04-07T13:37:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	Select the file you want to play with VLC, right click it, select properties and go to the W"Open with" tab.
2007-04-07T13:39:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	sorry, i realise just now that i addressed you instead of pkundu
2007-04-07T13:39:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	it happens.  no worries.
2008-02-21T01:48:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	why don't you use -G [couple of groups] -a?
2008-02-21T01:49:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	what does -a do? add instead of overwrite?
2008-02-21T01:49:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	yes
2008-02-21T01:50:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	Well i didn't realise it would overwrite my goups in the first place. So now i'm trying to get a functional user account working agsin.
2008-03-09T01:01:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	admin gives access to the admin group, desktop is a regular user (all groups, minus admin, that your first user was part of), and unprivledged is... I think just login, but can't access internet, audio, etc.  But I still believen unprivledged can still login (as opposed to /bin/false as their shell)
2008-03-09T01:03:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	Thanks. I see that selecting different profiles has an effect in the User Privileges tab where common privileges are listed
2008-03-09T01:03:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	Right, thats what it affects.  Just a default checkbox setup
2008-12-01T03:51:00.000Z	Flannel	bartmon	Because OOo3 won't ever officially be in Intrepid.  It was released too late in the development cycle (after being delayed a few times).  It'll be in -backports at some point, and the PPA should be back up sometime this week.
2008-12-01T03:52:00.000Z	bartmon	Flannel	LjL: Thanks!
