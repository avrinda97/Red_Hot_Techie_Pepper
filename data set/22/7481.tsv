2006-03-26T17:42:00.000Z	kingspawn		the ubotu-add for !gcc is actually wrong, but i dont know if it matters
2006-03-26T17:43:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	don't concur
2006-03-27T16:23:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	nope, not really
2006-03-27T16:23:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	and your build-essential must be the same as mine :-) it installs GCC also
2006-03-27T16:24:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	yes yes, blah blah ;)
2006-04-05T12:59:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	does live cd include build-essential? (this is not to rip up our old discussion, but a general question)
2006-04-05T12:59:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	start one and find out (i.e. I don't know :-()
2006-04-05T12:59:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	:)
2006-04-05T12:59:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	then tell me
2006-04-05T13:00:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	it seems, by quick googling, that it does not.
2006-04-05T13:01:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	so sudo apt-get install
2006-04-05T13:01:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	put the live cd in and check the pool directory on it
2006-04-05T13:02:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	i'll try later. just asked because it would be nice to carry it around, being able to develop when just live-booting
2006-04-27T15:29:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	do you know which package contains mkfs.msdos? I thought it was default. Doesnt ubotu have some sort of searching mechanism for such things?
2006-04-29T12:33:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	He wants to put fdisk.exe on a floppy and erase his mbr :)
2006-04-29T12:33:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	ohh I would not know anything about windows or that
2006-04-30T06:37:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	security through obsecurity
2006-04-30T06:38:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	its not security as such, it is simply an easy way of routing out all those script-people
2006-04-30T06:38:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	saying like that you get away with it :-)
2006-04-30T06:39:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	:)
2006-04-30T06:40:00.000Z	ompaul	kingspawn	I am a great beliver in default (sendmail 1.0) :-/
2006-04-30T06:40:00.000Z	kingspawn	ompaul	hehe :)
