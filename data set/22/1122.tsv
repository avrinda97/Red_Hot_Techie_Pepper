2011-06-25T19:42:00.000Z	jjovereats		My computer has slowed RIGHT the h3ll down. I have tried Janitor, and now my GNOME and GDM are crashy: Gnome will load a blank panel in 15 minutes, and GDM crashes to "desktop", i.e. Black. However, switching to a TTY and using the laptop (that needs repairs) as a thin-client for a desktop (that needs a separate monitor, I'm using a TV as it's screen LOL) it works using Xinit, Grandr and SSH. Nautilus works properly, but throws
2011-06-25T19:42:00.000Z	jjovereats		 an IO error when sending LARGE files across a USB adapter.
2011-06-25T19:43:00.000Z	jjovereats		I will try Janitor again. I wil NOT use Gtkoprhan unless someone requests it. I need help!
2011-06-25T19:45:00.000Z	jjovereats		Thank you Trill for telling us that your bad word was a slip.
2011-06-25T19:47:00.000Z	jjovereats		HELLO!!!!! I do actually need help here.
2011-06-25T19:47:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	have some patience
2011-06-28T00:25:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	I've seen that when tar'ing files in corrupted filesystems, sparse files (such as virtual machine disks with space reserved) and pseudo filesystems as /proc
2011-06-28T00:44:00.000Z	jjovereats	oCean	could you please explain your weirdness about FSCHK and the shrank file?
2011-06-28T00:45:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	I was just sharing my experience. I've seen such messages when making (tar) backups of for example sparse files. Those are files with 'reserved' space
2011-06-28T00:45:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	but I've also seen that when trying to backup a corrupted file, actually a file on a corrupted filesystem
2011-06-28T00:46:00.000Z	jjovereats	oCean	I don't get it. Explain in a PM.
2011-06-28T00:46:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	no thank you
2011-06-28T00:49:00.000Z	jjovereats	oCean	is it indicative of a problem, on a server that has been running for yonks?
2011-06-28T00:51:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	that *could* be, I'm just sharing what I've encountered. It also happens when performing tar backup of /sys and sometimes of already-tarrred-and-gzipped files.
2011-06-28T00:52:00.000Z	jjovereats	oCean	and it happens to AVI's and BMP's.
2011-06-28T00:53:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	see if you can restore the file(s) and if they're fine or not. That's really all I can give you right now
2011-06-29T01:37:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	ok, enough. You've repeated your question (without giving any detail) several times. You know that such repeat is not acceptable.
2011-06-29T01:37:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	and you know what you should do in that case, and the consequences if you don't
2011-06-29T01:38:00.000Z	jjovereats	oCean	now everything's just being weird. Should I go the earmark, DVD, PC, DV Tape route? Or should I exclude those files?
2011-06-29T01:39:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	I really don't see how such a general question (still without any detail) would be an ubuntu specific issue. I ask you now kindly to stop this discussion in this channel
2011-06-29T01:40:00.000Z	jjovereats	oCean	It says the the file shrank. I will be taking overlay backups as a precaution.
2011-06-29T01:40:00.000Z	oCean	jjovereats	you continue, I quiet you
