2011-02-21T23:26:00.000Z	Jetpack		Hey guys, I'm having a problem with my desktop, in that any sudo command in the terminal will just pause as soon as I enter it, and refuses to ever ask for my password, or ctrl+c cancel.
2011-02-21T23:27:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	is this a new problem or has it done it since install?
2011-02-21T23:27:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	It's just started yesterday, and I've had the machine running for 3+ weeks
2011-02-21T23:29:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	have you run any updates or anything?
2011-02-21T23:30:00.000Z	Jetpack		I have been, I don't remember if the problems corresponded with that, though. :S
2011-02-21T23:31:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	i've never incountered that... maybe a little google-fu?
2011-02-21T23:31:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	I've been looking around, I haven't found anything useful so far.
2011-02-21T23:33:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	even ctrl+\ won't stop the sudo command
2011-02-21T23:34:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	can you background it even? ctr-z
2011-02-21T23:35:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	nope, refuses to listen to anything.
2011-02-21T23:38:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	thats not good
2011-02-21T23:43:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	could this problem be related to gnome-keyring-d?
2011-02-21T23:44:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	/var/log/syslog says it got a segfault.
2011-02-21T23:46:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	the logs are a good place for info. you may need to reinstall some packages
2011-02-21T23:47:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	know of a way to (re)install packages without the use of sudo? :P  I can get stuff to my desktop from an external hd
2011-02-21T23:48:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	ummmmm... good point... cant you boot root from the cd? or something.. it's been a while
2011-02-21T23:49:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	I guess I could use the recovery mode, where I can use sudo
2011-02-21T23:50:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	i think thats about your only option right now, unless someone who knows more can chime in
2011-02-21T23:53:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	thanks for the help :P
2011-02-21T23:53:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	sorry i wasnt too knowledgable on the subject
2011-02-21T23:53:00.000Z	cgkades	Jetpack	but you're welcome :)
2011-02-21T23:54:00.000Z	Jetpack	cgkades	It seems to be a super-general problem, I wasn't expecting much. ^^
