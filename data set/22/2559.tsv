2009-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	penguins2387		anyone need any help?
2009-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	yes...
2009-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	what can i do for you
2009-05-12T08:38:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	, I just installed texlive from the DVD, into /opt/texmf/2008/ using sudo.  Now I think I shouldn't have used sudo... can I change the permissions on the files?  How?  Thanks so much...
2009-05-12T08:39:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	sorry chmod
2009-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	what i would do would be to remove it and redo the installation keeping the config files
2009-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	I've used chmod only once, and needed to re-install to fix it :D  So what I've got is a bunch of files and directories that I need permissions to without sudo, in /opt/texemf/2008
2009-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	you think re-install? ok...
2009-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	it's the most expediant
2009-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	aaditya yea... ok.  Thanks.  I think I'll re-install.
2009-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	sorry man
2009-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	that's ok.
2009-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	it looks asthough you may need to use sudo or add yourself to a specific group
2009-05-12T08:47:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	hector, well, let the install finish.  It's gonna be a bit of time now.
2009-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	there are a bunch of screencasts on youtube showing that exact thing.
2009-05-12T08:50:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	a friend of mine got mad at this roommate and deleted his kernel when he turned of the computer nothing worked
2009-05-12T08:50:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	evil.
2009-05-12T08:51:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	yeah he was mad cause the roomate took his laptop and formated his home partition and installed windows on it
2009-05-12T08:51:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	oh well then his roomate deserved it... :D
2009-05-12T08:52:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	indeed
2009-05-12T08:52:00.000Z	swiftarrow	penguins2387	I take it there was some back and forth there... :D
2009-05-12T08:52:00.000Z	penguins2387	swiftarrow	oh yes years and years worth
