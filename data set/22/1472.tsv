2010-06-14T11:37:00.000Z	sikun		I have a emachine em250 netbook, which is identical to the acer aspire d250, my question is i'm trying to find out what temp the cpu is running at, but in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM , temperature only reads at 27C and does not change
2010-06-14T11:38:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	have you tried it after boot from a cold system?
2010-06-14T11:38:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	yeah i have even on a cold boot it is 27C right away
2010-06-14T11:39:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	are you worried it is to hot or just curious?
2010-06-14T11:41:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	worried at times... it does get rather warm
2010-06-14T11:43:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	well then we need to figure this out! You need a graphical toolbar so you can keep an eye on it.

2010-06-14T11:45:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	oops my bad.
2010-06-14T11:45:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	what could cause it to not read the temp
2010-06-14T11:45:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	Do you have access to synaptic?
2010-06-14T11:45:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	ha.. i was wondering
2010-06-14T11:45:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	i will install it quick
2010-06-14T11:46:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	Xsensors reads temp and voltage
2010-06-14T11:48:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	ok i just installed Xsensors, I have it open and right now it just shows a temp, and that is 26.8C
2010-06-14T11:48:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	man am I good or what!
2010-06-14T11:48:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	 just kidding
2010-06-14T11:50:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	the temp doesn't change though
2010-06-14T11:51:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	what is the operation range for that puter? 27C seems ok to me
2010-06-14T11:53:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	do you run Gnome? Computertemp applet logs changes
2010-06-14T11:54:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	sikun	Mine is 56 C
2010-06-14T11:55:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	i do run gnome, also it is adjusting the fan to the temp as it gets warmer the fan is speeding up so that is a good sign i suppose, but it still says its at 27C, also acpi -V shows the cpu at 26.8C also
2010-06-14T12:03:00.000Z	sikun	Sam_Fisher	hmm... i getting some results on google saying it is a bug in the kernel with the intel atom processors, but i'm still digging
