2007-11-02T14:23:00.000Z	Bij2		Should I try to Install WIne to get my Tv Tuner to work. I mean is it possible to get some devices to work like that?
2007-11-02T14:25:00.000Z	Bij2		Tuner card is techCom internal but not sure of the name
2007-11-02T14:26:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	I have that chipset on my MSI TV@nywhere Plus
2007-11-02T14:26:00.000Z	Bij2	OpenSorce	 You got it to work>\????
2007-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	Bij2	OpenSorce	Ive tried TvTime, Mythtv, scantv,xawtv
2007-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	watching it now....what kind of issues are you having?
2007-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	Bij2		Well I couldnt get video
2007-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	Bij2		I tried various numbers and got video on modprobe saa7134 card=3 tuner=69 but no audio
2007-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	Bij2	OpenSorce	I have a cable running from my tuner to my sound card also
2007-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	Bij2		But cant get sound :(
2007-11-02T14:28:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	ok.....I ran into that with xawtv in Kubuntu.......I think that's exactly they way I had mine setup.....let me look and see how it's setup on this distro....
2007-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	Bij2		Ive posted this here at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=599181
2007-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	yep....card=3 tuner=69 on this distro too
2007-11-02T14:30:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	of course I didn't have to do anything to make it work this time....
2007-11-02T14:32:00.000Z	Bij2	OpenSorce	I dont know why I cant get audio, Ive checkd in my audio preference and I dont have a capture tab anywhere, And I have gone into preferences and selected everythign in there
2007-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	by default your tv card should have it's audio on......in your sound prefs under input you might try selecting mic and line in and turn both up
2007-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	assuming your's is setup like mine you just have a cable running into either mic or line or aux.....?
2007-11-02T14:33:00.000Z	Bij2	OpenSorce	Did that but I still cant get it to play audio :(
2007-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	Bij2		Into Line in of my audio card
2007-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	Bij2		well its onboard Asus M2n MX SE
2007-11-02T14:35:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Bij2	sorry man......if you download what I mentioned in my privmsg and run it you might see how it works that way. Might help to make it work under *buntu
2007-11-02T14:36:00.000Z	Bij2	OpenSorce	Thanks will check it out
