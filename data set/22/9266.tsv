2009-07-10T03:06:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	hold on
2009-07-10T03:07:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	is this on normal boot? or from resume?
2009-07-10T03:08:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	ok you have to either put either noapic or apic=no at the end of your kernel option
2009-07-10T03:09:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	when your computer boots up press escape when it is counting down
2009-07-10T03:09:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	(you are pressing escape to get into grub)
2009-07-10T03:10:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	choose the latest (usually the one on top) and hit the e keyboard ( you are going into edit mode, read the stuff at the bottom for all the details)
2009-07-10T03:11:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	do you see what I am saying?
2009-07-10T03:12:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	now go to the very end and add apic=no
2009-07-10T03:14:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	what was the error again?
2009-07-10T03:17:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	hold on
2009-07-10T03:19:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	its right next to the backspace
2009-07-10T03:24:00.000Z	poningru	Cookie	have to go to dinner, will talk later
