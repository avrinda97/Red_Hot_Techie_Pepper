2010-06-24T12:23:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	 apt-get intall build-essential
2010-06-24T12:25:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	I know build-essential is need, but I want to purge it when I have install nVidia driver done. Can it?
2010-06-24T12:26:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	 if you installed it as a deb, then yes. if you installed via source then it will be manual. there is usually a make deb in the source, fyi
2010-06-24T12:28:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	You say even if the "build-essential" is depend on "nVidia driver", but if I install "build-essential" before "nVidia driver", then I can purge build-essential", and won't break "nVidia driver" ?
2010-06-24T12:29:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	 no, you are confused
2010-06-24T12:29:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	You say, I must install "nVidia driver" and use 334 MB, that's all ?
2010-06-24T12:30:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	 build-essential will only give you the tools to build drivers and programs and such.  however, if you have all the tools to build the nvidia code from source, you should be able to also make a deb for your system. once you install that deb you will be able to --purge those files when you choose
2010-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	I know, but if I excute #aptitude install nvidia-glx-185, then I install the driver, and I will spend 334MB space for HDD, I have no choice for minimal install ?
2010-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	I just want to install the driver as mini as I can, because I don't want to update anything for the PC, it's just a embedded product.
2010-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	 ah, it sounds like you want apt-get clean then (removes old debs)
2010-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	no no.
2010-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	 I misunderstood
2010-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	I want to insatll nVidia "driver only", I want to install the other unuse package. Because it's a embedded product, the HDD space is very precious.
2010-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	I want to insatll nVidia "driver only", I DON'T want to install the other unuse package. Because it's a embedded product, the HDD space is very precious.
2010-06-24T12:37:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	it doesn't look like more than 48M here
2010-06-24T12:38:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	Sorry, I don't understand want are you talking about, sorry my poor English .
2010-06-24T12:39:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	The nVidia driver will spend my 334MB HDD sapce, It's exaggerate .
2010-06-24T12:40:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	  apt-cache show nvidia-glx-185  <--- Installed-Size: 48
2010-06-24T12:40:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	yes, yes. But the dependency package is very very lot and big.
2010-06-24T12:41:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	The key point is the dependency packages, :'(
2010-06-24T12:42:00.000Z	AAA	yillkid	sorry. I don't think I can help you there :(
2010-06-24T12:42:00.000Z	yillkid	AAA	Ok, thank you. :)
