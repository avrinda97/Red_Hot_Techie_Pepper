2012-01-12T23:01:00.000Z	zeref		Hi guys, I'm having trouble setting up my ICS, i followed the instruction @ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing using the gateways method. I just want to ask what should my /etc/network/interfaces file look like. this is what i've tried so far:

2012-01-12T23:02:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 same to you: there's no gateway
2012-01-12T23:03:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	??
2012-01-12T23:04:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 address and netmak, ok, but you have to add the gateway address, too
2012-01-12T23:04:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	on the client PC and Host?
2012-01-12T23:05:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	yes
2012-01-12T23:07:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	k, umm wlan0 is on 192.168.1.xxx and eth0 is on 192.168.0.xxx what should the gateway be?
2012-01-12T23:08:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 i guess your router, 192.168.0.1 or so
2012-01-12T23:08:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	in a terminal, type dig, check the server address
2012-01-12T23:11:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	k, just to confirm, that server addr should go into eth0 config for both client and host?
2012-01-12T23:11:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 yes, there is only 1 (default) gateway
2012-01-12T23:24:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	hmmmm, just restarted the network got and error SIOCADDRT: no such process, failesd to bring up eth0
2012-01-12T23:24:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	the gateway ip is 208.xxx.xxx.xxx is that right
2012-01-12T23:25:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 do you use a router at home?
2012-01-12T23:25:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	shouldn't it be 192.168.0.1
2012-01-12T23:25:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 yes, that's what i said earlier
2012-01-12T23:25:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	i'm at res, so i dont have access to it
2012-01-12T23:26:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	Campus residence
2012-08-03T19:09:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 Quickly is shell for Glade / python
2012-08-03T19:11:00.000Z	zeref	MonkeyDust	 retnan: i've created an app (glade and python) but now i'd like to build it into a .deb file.
2012-08-03T19:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	zeref	 you're seeing it wrong, quickly uses glade to create python apps, i guess this is what you want: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/how-to-create-deb-package-ubuntu-debian.html
