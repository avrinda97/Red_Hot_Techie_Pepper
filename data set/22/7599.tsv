2006-07-20T15:33:00.000Z	synth	dli	current issues or past issues?
2006-07-20T15:33:00.000Z	dli	synth	design issue
2006-07-20T15:34:00.000Z	synth	dli	how so prae tell?
2006-07-20T15:35:00.000Z	dli	synth	mwe /j #debian, ask dpkg about reiserfs
2006-07-20T15:35:00.000Z	dli	synth	mwe, reiser4 is considered better, but again, still experimental
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	synth	dli	yeah, the guy is constantly changing crap
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	synth	dli	im just down on ext3 lately, and went back to reiserfs for my root
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	dli	synth	that Reiser has some good points, for sure, but that doesn't make reiserfs a good fs
2006-07-20T15:37:00.000Z	synth	dli	ive seen a ton of a customers of ours have failures w/reiser
2006-07-20T15:37:00.000Z	dli	synth	jfs is recommended, when someone wants something other than ext3
2006-07-20T15:37:00.000Z	synth	dli	i figured though, its cause theyre not using the right flags for the mount. there are ways to get data integrity at the cost of raw write speed w/reiser
2006-07-20T15:38:00.000Z	dli	synth	right, even namesys.com doesn't support reiserfs now, except for bug fixing, they should take reiserfs out of the stable kernel
2006-07-20T15:38:00.000Z	synth	dli	oh really?
2006-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	dli	synth	xfs requires a UPS, no power dump
2006-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	synth	dli	oh yeah, i have an ext3 raid array here, i have batteries :D
2006-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	synth	dli	1.4tb's on the desktop :D
2006-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	dli	synth	for a server, xfs should be right, it's designed for servers
2006-07-20T15:42:00.000Z	dli	synth	install libcupsys2-dev
2006-07-20T15:42:00.000Z	synth	dli	it says libcupsys2-dev: Depends: libcupsys2 (= 1.2.0-0ubuntu5) but 1.2.1-0ubuntu2 is to be installed
2006-07-20T15:43:00.000Z	dli	synth	clean up your sources.list
2006-07-20T15:44:00.000Z	dli	synth	you mess up with some 3-rd party entries
2006-07-20T15:44:00.000Z	dli	synth	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=libcupsys&searchon=names&subword=1&version=dapper&release=all
