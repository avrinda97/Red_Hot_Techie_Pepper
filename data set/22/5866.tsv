2007-04-25T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mattycoze	No, it's really easy though, I think they have even made a GUI installer since I last tried ( no need to flash it or anything because it's all on the HD )

2007-07-08T06:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mattycoze	What problem are you having again? ( it's hard to keep track :)
2010-02-17T15:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mattycoze	What errors do you get from make?
2010-02-17T15:43:00.000Z	mattycoze	Jordan_U	i'll paste them in a sec...
2010-02-17T15:44:00.000Z	mattycoze	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/mb7a068f that's the error messages i get
2010-02-17T15:47:00.000Z	mattycoze	Jordan_U	i don't know if that'd give you any clues right?
2010-02-17T15:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mattycoze	The error about strcmp makes me think that cpp became more strict in a recent version and they need to explicitly include string.h. But I don't know much C++ so I may be totally wrong.
