2004-11-08T17:30:00.000Z	devolve		anyone successfully installed ubuntu onto a SATA drive?
2004-11-08T17:30:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	yeah
2004-11-08T17:32:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	did it show up when you were editing the partition table?
2004-11-08T17:32:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	yeah
2004-11-08T17:32:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	what sata chipset do you have?
2004-11-08T17:32:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	Nforce3 250mb
2004-11-08T17:33:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	you might want to try dropping to a console (alt-f2) and doing a modprobe sata_nv
2004-11-08T17:33:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	not sure this isn't a hardware configuration issue not related to os...
2004-11-08T17:33:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	cannot install os yet.  only free drive is sata.  all others ntfs with data I eventally want on them...
2004-11-08T17:34:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	when the installer boots, jump to a console...
2004-11-08T17:36:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	gotcha
2004-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	modprobe sata_nv <enter>    does nothing.  I get a # again..
2004-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	that's good
2004-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	now go through the rest of the process
2004-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	it does not show up under partition disks... I get ide1 master/slave, and ide5 master... all ntfs partitions.  have new shiny spanking wd200gb SATA hooked up to SATA3 in there.
2004-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	ok, one sec
2004-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	I see nothing about said drive in post.  That could be my problem.
2004-11-08T17:42:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	aha
2004-11-08T17:58:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	sata3+4 are enabled, will try enabling sata3/sata4 dma transfer... I know this is a little off topic...
2004-11-08T17:58:00.000Z	jdub	devolve	no, it's an install issue ;)
2004-11-08T17:58:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	still no sata drive showing up in partitoner.  feel cheated for settling for a socket754 solution instead of going the next step to socket939.  socket754 deadends at my 3200+, maybe I could go up to 3400+... msi k8 neo.
2004-11-08T06:46:00.000Z	devolve	jdub	it was a jumper setting on the hard drive... I had moved it from default setting.
