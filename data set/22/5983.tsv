2007-02-05T13:15:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 did you follow the instructions here:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats ?
2007-02-05T13:16:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	I think that's the one I followed...
2007-02-05T13:17:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 i've followed the instructions there for several versions of ubuntu and have always gotten xine to work fine.  i suggest not using totem
2007-02-05T13:18:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	totem is the default player. I seldom use it, but it doesn't seem to conflict with gxine.
2007-02-05T13:23:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	I wonder why I get a 'package not found' error with gstreamer0.10-pitfdll, following the instructions on the link you gave me.
2007-02-05T13:24:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 which link?
2007-02-05T13:24:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 the restrictedformats one?
2007-02-05T13:25:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	exactly.
2007-02-05T13:25:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	is it no good for Breezy?
2007-02-05T13:26:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 i've gotten the restrictedformats working all the way back to 5.10
2007-02-05T13:27:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 sorry, excuse mine - i think the naming conventions are stupid so i usually refer to them by version #
2007-02-05T13:28:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 i'd recommend upgrading to 'edgy eft' which is version 6.10
2007-02-05T13:29:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	then you'd probably refer to 'lactrodectus mactans' intead of a 'black widow2...:).
2007-02-05T13:30:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	I will upgrade, but I believe you can't skip over a version without running into trouble.
2007-02-05T13:31:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 then upgrade twice.  or save your stuff on a cd and do a clean install
2007-02-05T13:31:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	yes, I will do that for sure.
2007-02-05T13:32:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 good luck, i'm running eft right now, except for my modem problems it's clear sailing
2007-02-05T13:33:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	do you happen to know what is the utility to reconfigure the keyboard?
2007-02-05T13:33:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 for configuring keyboard shortcuts?
2007-02-05T13:34:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 or for configuring the keyboard for another language?
2007-02-05T13:35:00.000Z	lgc	fliptop	no, to reconfigure the keyboard (the last upgrade rendered my keyboard almost useless).
2007-02-05T13:35:00.000Z	fliptop	lgc	 dunno, i've never had a kb problem.
