2008-04-15T19:09:00.000Z	bo-dick		how do i display all installed packages in synaptic and sort them by date?
2008-04-15T19:10:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	press the status radio button in  synaptic
2008-04-15T19:11:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	as far as date is concerned i am not aware of that
2008-04-15T19:12:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	status radio button...
2008-04-15T19:12:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	ok
2008-04-15T19:12:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	did u find the button?
2008-04-15T19:13:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	yeah, in my version it looks like a regular pushbutton
2008-04-15T19:13:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	whatever
2008-04-15T19:14:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	now on top select installed packages or something
2008-04-15T19:14:00.000Z	murlidhar		grub, so everything is sorted out?
2008-04-15T19:15:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	now it's only the date issue
2008-04-15T19:16:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	afaik there isn't any option
2008-04-15T19:16:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	why do u need that anyway
2008-04-15T19:16:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	some stuff was installed through the mozilla browser
2008-04-15T19:17:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	would be simple to identify them by checking for freshness
2008-04-15T19:17:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	addons?
2008-04-15T19:17:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	yup
2008-04-15T19:17:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	then u can uninstall them if u want from the firefox itself
2008-04-15T19:20:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	anyways additional addons of firefox aren't added to synaptic
2008-04-15T19:20:00.000Z	bo-dick	murlidhar	oh
2008-04-15T19:22:00.000Z	murlidhar	bo-dick	the best option would be to go to firefox history and add a column by date and then check
