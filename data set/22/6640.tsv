2007-09-10T15:41:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	thats what she asked for
2007-09-10T15:41:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	pointless unless you have a static ip, and even then it gets reset everytime you start up the comp
2007-09-10T15:42:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	what resets it?
2007-09-10T15:42:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	i'm not sure what process it is, but it happens everytime the DHCP renews it's lease
2007-09-10T15:43:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	oh that is set up in the dhcp server details. i see what you are saying now
2007-09-10T15:44:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	i've found that unless you use a prog like resolvconf, or just use the GUI supplied with ubuntu there's no point editing resolv.conf
2007-09-10T16:05:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	k3b is real nice. but its a kde app
2007-09-10T16:05:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	didn't work for me
2007-09-10T16:07:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	was that the error that you were talking about earlier... sorry i didnt get a good look at it. was kinda busy with some other ppl
2007-09-10T16:07:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	yes
2007-09-10T16:08:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	ooo i had that problem a bit ago... let me see if i can find out what i used for that
2007-09-10T16:08:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	now no program is even recognising my cd burner
2007-09-10T16:09:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	what if you put a regular cd in there. you know one that has stuff already on it. will ubuntu recognize it and mount it for you?
2007-09-10T16:09:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	brad the drive won't even open.
2007-09-10T16:09:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	but before it screwed up, that was working fine
2007-09-10T16:11:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	sudo eject. have you tried that?
2007-09-10T16:12:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	yes, to no availl
2007-09-10T16:12:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	well as a last resort have you just tried to reboot the machine?
2007-09-10T16:13:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	yeah but everytime i do it, it works fine until i try to start a CD burning prog again
2007-09-10T16:13:00.000Z	|brad|	brownie17	strange....
2007-09-10T16:17:00.000Z	brownie17	|brad|	a penny for your thoughts
