2007-03-29T09:22:00.000Z	Voytek		It is empty. I deleted .Trash
2007-03-29T09:23:00.000Z	Voytek		(rm -r .Trash)
2007-03-29T09:23:00.000Z	Voytek		it was completely empty, actually. It's an external HD, with two partitions. One (the 11GB one) is completely free.
2007-03-29T09:23:00.000Z	Voytek		yes, restarted, ejected, etc. :)
2007-03-29T09:24:00.000Z	Voytek		No worries, I'm sure I missed something, but it's bugging me and I'm at a loss at this point.
2007-03-29T09:25:00.000Z	Voytek		ah, that might be it! Is there any way I can tell Ubuntu to copy a certain portion of a folder? It's one big folder (a cache folder for a research project) with 200,000 files. So I can't really do folders.
2007-03-29T09:27:00.000Z	Voytek		yellow -- I'm trying to copy a folder with over 200,000 files to an external HD... it's giving me out of memory errors after 20,000 files every time. I have the memory, but am at a loss of how to proceed.
2007-03-29T09:28:00.000Z	Voytek		ah, fair enough, i guess if that's it, then that's it. Manually copying takes a long time though.. (and tarring it also gives me a good 4 hour wait to untar)
2007-03-29T09:28:00.000Z	Voytek		can i make a scrip tthat does that?
2007-03-29T09:28:00.000Z	Voytek		*script
2007-03-29T09:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Voytek	what is the script meant to do
2007-03-29T09:29:00.000Z	Voytek	bruenig	- copy a subset of a folder to another folder
2007-03-29T09:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Voytek	are you copying or moving, because I can think of a way to move 20,000 at a time
2007-03-29T09:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Voytek	do any of these files have spaces in them?
2007-03-29T09:31:00.000Z	Voytek	bruenig	- nope.
2007-03-29T09:35:00.000Z	Voytek	bruenig	-- im not much of a bash guy, so does that move the first 20000 files?
2007-03-29T09:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Voytek	yeah, probably could move that down to 15,000 or something to be safe
2007-03-29T09:36:00.000Z	Voytek	bruenig	- how would i move the next 20000 though?
2007-03-29T09:37:00.000Z	bruenig	Voytek	you would use a while loop
2007-03-29T09:39:00.000Z	Voytek	bruenig	- now I understand. I'll try that next time then since this'll be a regular occurrence (im moving the files so I can create more, *sigh*)
2007-03-29T09:47:00.000Z	bruenig	Voytek	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12715/ (if you chmod +x this script it can be used like this) "nameofscript /full/path/to/directory /full/path/to/destination"
2007-03-29T09:53:00.000Z	Voytek	bruenig	-- thank you! i will try that. brb (thanks VERY much)
