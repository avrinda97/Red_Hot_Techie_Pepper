2007-01-19T07:00:00.000Z	chris1932		Hi Monika: it's 6.06 LTS. I'm embarrassed that I don't know how to tell which soundcard I have. It's on a Thinkpad T42. How can I check?
2007-01-19T07:00:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	asoundconf list
2007-01-19T07:01:00.000Z	chris1932		Monika: It gives me I82801DBICH4.
2007-01-19T07:02:00.000Z	chris1932		Monika: I'm on Gnome. Does that output help?
2007-01-19T07:02:00.000Z	chris1932		Yes, but I'm not sure which keywords to use. A lot of people can't get sound to work at all, but that's not what I'm looking for help with. What should I search for?
2007-01-19T07:02:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	that driver is dmixed by default.
2007-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	just don't use arts or esound
2007-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	tell applications to use alsa by default
2007-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	chris1932		Thanks Judicata and crimsun!
2007-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	chris1932		Crimsun -- how do I change it?
2007-01-19T07:04:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	the only thing you need to change is to disable esound and arts
2007-01-19T07:05:00.000Z	chris1932	crimsun	how do I do that?
2007-01-19T07:05:00.000Z	chris1932	crimsun	should I uncheck "Enable software sound mixing"?
2007-01-19T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	yes
2007-01-19T07:06:00.000Z	chris1932		Anything else? Would I now be using ALSA?
2007-01-19T07:06:00.000Z	chris1932		(to crimsun)
2007-01-19T07:07:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	you have to disable arts, I presume?
2007-01-19T07:09:00.000Z	chris1932	crimsun	how do I disable arts?
2007-01-19T07:10:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	use the kde control center
2007-01-19T07:10:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	or kde system setting
2007-01-19T07:10:00.000Z	chris1932	crimsun	I'm in Gnome -- I don't see an option in my Preferences > Sound.
2007-01-19T07:11:00.000Z	crimsun	chris1932	what kde applications do you have installed that use arts?
