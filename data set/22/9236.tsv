2005-01-23T14:28:00.000Z	Meekle		gotta love how laptops are so proprietary
2005-01-23T14:28:00.000Z	Meekle		so i can use my wireless card
2005-01-23T14:28:00.000Z	Meekle		they don't have a native linux driver for it yet
2005-01-23T14:29:00.000Z	Meekle		ipw-firmware?
2005-01-23T14:30:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	in the instalation didn't it find your wireless card or something?
2005-01-23T14:31:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	internal? But still your laptop must have a way to unplug it
2005-01-23T14:31:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	it is a centrino right?
2005-01-23T14:32:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	that's right
2005-01-23T14:32:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	11Mbps?
2005-01-23T14:35:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	i dont know if there are already drivers that support up to 54 mpbs
2005-01-23T14:38:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	i found something in some brazilian site about broadcom wireless card with linux
2005-01-23T14:39:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	randabis is right... ndiswrapper with windows driver should be the answer
2005-01-23T14:41:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	you should try the backapps
2005-01-23T14:42:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	backports
2005-01-23T14:42:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	try search for backports in the ubuntu site
2005-01-23T14:44:00.000Z	FuNgEx	Meekle	try this page ubuntuguide.org
