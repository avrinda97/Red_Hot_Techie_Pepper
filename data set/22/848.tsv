2011-03-22T09:24:00.000Z	The_Pharoah		why should programmers use linux?

2011-03-22T09:27:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	It's much more programmer-friendly, but you can configure any environment of your choice to be convenient
2011-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	maybe you could use come channel like ##linux, ##programming or any of the languages of your choice.
2011-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	We already know everyone here is using linux but in those other channels, maybe some do not
2011-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	The_Pharoah	soreau	most of them are invite only :(
2011-03-22T09:32:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	Many of them required your nick to be registered due to problems with spam and such
2011-03-22T09:32:00.000Z	The_Pharoah	soreau	ok, i think i already registered mine though
2011-03-22T09:32:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	Which channel can you not join?
2011-03-22T09:42:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	Not exclusively, anyone can use linux
2011-03-22T09:42:00.000Z	The_Pharoah	soreau	but really if you aern't in a computer related career you're gonna be using Windows or OS X
2011-03-22T09:43:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	That's simply not a true statement, Also, it doesn't have much to ubuntu, so let's try to stay on topic
2011-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	soreau	The_Pharoah	This isnt a hacking channel. Ask #aircrack-ng
2011-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	The_Pharoah	soreau	i was just wondering since linuxpwns was talking about it
