2006-07-12T07:56:00.000Z	ketetha_	horus	okkk =] 
2006-07-12T07:58:00.000Z	horus	ketetha_	you can also use the graphical apt-get interface
2006-07-12T07:58:00.000Z	ketetha_	horus	whats that?
2006-07-12T07:59:00.000Z	horus	ketetha_	it's quite nice, and easier than using the command line if you don't know the name of the package you want
2006-07-12T07:59:00.000Z	ketetha_	horus	cool whre do i get that?
2006-07-12T08:00:00.000Z	horus	ketetha_	it's already installed by default
2006-07-12T08:00:00.000Z	horus	ketetha_	or just hit alt-f2 and type synaptic
2006-07-12T08:01:00.000Z	ketetha_	horus	OH THAT! ya. haha thats where i got the name zsnes :) ya i just felt like using the command line so i can learn moree

2006-07-12T08:03:00.000Z	ketetha_	horus	:) ls -a shows hidden files in your desktop or wherever right on the command line?
2006-07-12T08:03:00.000Z	horus	ketetha_	yes, but to learn about any command, just type man <command> instead of asking people in here
