2007-10-27T22:06:00.000Z	meoblast001		i use trailfocus on CompizFusion to make my windows see through, the only problem is, the window is not made transparent until another window goes into focus, why is this?

2007-10-27T22:08:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	oops that was to you :)
2007-10-27T22:08:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	that's what trailfocus is for, it makes your old windows turn translucent to give a "trail of focus"
2007-10-27T22:08:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	so what should i be using to do what im tryint to recieve?
2007-10-27T22:09:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	alt+scroll wheel
2007-10-27T22:09:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	how do i make that affect every window?
2007-10-27T22:10:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	you could use an opacity rule, join #compiz-fusion
2007-10-27T22:10:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	are you in there?
2008-07-25T09:31:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	please pastebin the output of: dpkg -l | grep -E "(nvidia|fglrx)"

2008-07-25T09:32:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	uninstall xorg-driver-fglrx and your problem will go away :)
2008-07-25T09:33:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	well... it still didnt run very fast before i got the fglrx... i only got the fglrx because i read online that i had an ATI and i wanted it togo faster
2008-07-25T09:35:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	what exactly was slow?
2008-07-25T09:35:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	simple games such as nexuiz
2008-07-25T09:35:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	the whole thing is slow
2008-07-25T09:43:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	how do i speed it up?
2009-03-28T13:10:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	#launchpad ?
2009-03-28T13:10:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	no one is answering my questions because it is so late so i thought this was the next best palce
2009-03-28T13:11:00.000Z	crdlb	meoblast001	that's unlikely, I'd just wait :)
2009-03-28T13:13:00.000Z	meoblast001	crdlb	so i suppose i won't be getting any sleep tonight :( :/
