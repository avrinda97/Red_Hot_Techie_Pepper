2006-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	fotoflo		hey all
2006-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	fotoflo		im having some trouble with a computer that I had trouble with before, and fixed, and is now not working again
2006-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	fotoflo		basicly DHCPDISCOVER is failing
2006-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	fotoflo		does anyone have time to help?
2006-12-25T07:01:00.000Z	fotoflo		my router says the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, but my ubuntu box is doing a dhcp discover on 255.255.255.255
2006-12-25T07:01:00.000Z	fotoflo		could that be the problem?
2006-12-25T07:01:00.000Z	fotoflo		and how do i fix it?
2006-12-25T07:03:00.000Z	fotoflo		i think route assumes that i can get to  my router? but when i ping my router i get network unavailable
2006-12-25T07:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	then you probably didnt get a dhcp lease. is surfing working correctly?
2006-12-25T07:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	then you need to fix it :)
2006-12-25T07:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	well, we most likely cant support third party routers. youll have to read the documentation
2006-12-25T07:06:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	how do you know?
2006-12-25T07:19:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	a tip, put your /home on a separate partition if you havent already
2006-12-25T07:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	you could try out the latest fedora if you think idd suit you better
2006-12-25T07:27:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	my guess is youd have the very same problems, plus a trip to dependency hell :)
2006-12-25T07:27:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	those arent simple in the lease
2006-12-25T07:30:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	you are now ;)
2006-12-25T07:30:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	point being...?
2006-12-25T07:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	get a floppy
2006-12-25T07:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	then burn a disc or use a usb flash drive
2006-12-25T07:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	watchdog is an iptables firewall for kubuntu. start by disbling it
2006-12-25T08:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fotoflo	/boot/grub
