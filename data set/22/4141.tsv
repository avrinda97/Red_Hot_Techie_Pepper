2008-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	Chipsa964		so i downloaded hardy heron and im trying it out on livecd...should i do a full install of it or stick with gutsy for now?
2008-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	cwillu	Chipsa964	stick with gutsy
2008-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	Chipsa964	cwillu	oh ok
2008-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	cwillu	Chipsa964	if you need something from hardy, there's a backport repository you can download packages from
2008-03-09T08:56:00.000Z	cwillu	Chipsa964	unless you enjoy fixing a random thing every time you update :p
2008-03-09T08:56:00.000Z	Chipsa964	cwillu	my internal mic works in hardy
2008-03-09T08:56:00.000Z	Chipsa964		but not in gutsy
2008-03-09T08:57:00.000Z	Chipsa964		and thats the only thing thats messin me up in gutsy...i want my mic to work
2008-03-09T08:57:00.000Z	cwillu	Chipsa964	it'll be in a proper beta soon (i.e., not expected to break things, although it still may), it'd be more advisable to wait for that
2008-03-09T08:57:00.000Z	Chipsa964	cwillu	would you have any idea on how to get it to work in gutsy?
2008-03-09T08:58:00.000Z	cwillu	Chipsa964	one more segment of my rant :p:  the work you need to do to make your mic work in gutsy is the type of thing you'd have to do every week or so if you follow the updates in hardy before it's stable :p
2008-03-09T08:58:00.000Z	cwillu		annnnyways

2008-03-09T08:59:00.000Z	Chipsa964		i just wanna get it to work in gutsy :-p
2008-03-09T08:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Chipsa964	what version of alsa-base does synaptic say you have in gutsy?
