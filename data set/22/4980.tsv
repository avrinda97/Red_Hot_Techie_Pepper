2007-09-27T11:18:00.000Z	Shadow_X		i know this is an opinionated question, but whats the best backup utility for linux?
2007-09-27T11:19:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	Well, the only GUI one that I know of is sbackup, but it's not that great.
2007-09-27T11:20:00.000Z	Shadow_X	cdm10	so would I be better off just tarring everything and burning to CDs?
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	well, you could try it... but its scheduling system only really works if your computer is always on at the time scheduled, which can be inconvenient if you turn off your computer, but there are ways to get it to work without that.
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	Shadow_X		well its for my server
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	But, you could try it.
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	Shadow_X		basically, im running an external hard drive
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	Shadow_X		and Im about to back up all my installation files
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	It's probably better off to learn a CLI one.
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	Shadow_X		CLI?
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	command line.
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	Shadow_X		ah
2007-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	Shadow_X		yea
2007-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	Shadow_X		cuz actually, this system will be stripped of X soon
2007-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	If it's a one-time backup, you could just tar it up and move it to the external drive.
2007-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	Shadow_X		yea
2007-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	But, if you're going to want to back it up regularly, get something that can be scheduled.
2007-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	Shadow_X		basically, all I wanna do, is keep backups of important files
2007-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	Shadow_X		because Im working on getting a startup going online
2007-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	Shadow_X		freelance media production
2007-09-27T11:23:00.000Z	cdm10	Shadow_X	well, i'm not too knowledgable when it comes to the CLI ones, so I can't really help you... and I have to go.
