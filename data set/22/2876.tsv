2009-02-07T20:25:00.000Z	jondecker76		are there any mdadm experts here?
2009-02-07T20:26:00.000Z	jondecker76		I was growing a 4 disk mdadm array to a 5 disk array, and someone rebooted the computer while it was reshaping
2009-02-07T20:26:00.000Z	jondecker76		now I can't get mdadm to respond
2009-02-07T20:26:00.000Z	jondecker76		i'm willing to pay if someone can help fix it
2009-02-07T20:27:00.000Z	necrolancer	jondecker76	maybe takin the new drive out of raid would help?
2009-02-07T20:28:00.000Z	jondecker76		I've tried disconnecting and reconnecting drives
2009-02-07T20:28:00.000Z	jondecker76		and rebooting
2009-02-07T20:28:00.000Z	jondecker76		I'm quite familiar with mdadm, but I need a true expert on it to fix it I'm afraid
2009-02-07T20:30:00.000Z	necrolancer	jondecker76	and you tried to run with 4 disk setup only already? this is the only no-expert trick that could be reasonable. just my 0.1 cent
2009-02-07T20:30:00.000Z	jondecker76		thanks - wish I did have a backup
2009-02-07T20:30:00.000Z	jondecker76		I try to reassemble the array and mdadm segfaults
2009-02-07T20:31:00.000Z	necrolancer	jondecker76	but I would assume the data is untouched - just the mdm.conf shows an not fully enabled disk-entry, am I wrong?
2009-02-07T20:32:00.000Z	necrolancer	jondecker76	shows = tries to use
2009-02-07T20:32:00.000Z	jondecker76		mdadm.conf appears to be blank for some reason
2009-02-07T20:32:00.000Z	necrolancer	jondecker76	any mdadm.conf.bak? ;-)
2009-02-07T20:33:00.000Z	jondecker76		damn... the backup file is empty too
2009-02-07T20:34:00.000Z	necrolancer	jondecker76	but well md uses autorecognition for such scenario, right? so... it should be able to setup 4-disk array and 5-disk should fail, is that NOT the case?
2009-02-07T20:34:00.000Z	jondecker76		its not the case
2009-02-07T20:34:00.000Z	jondecker76		anything I trie segfaults
2009-02-07T20:35:00.000Z	jondecker76	necrolancer	can you help me via PM so I can show you the results of some commands?
2009-02-07T20:35:00.000Z	jondecker76		so I don't flood the chat here
2009-02-07T20:35:00.000Z	necrolancer	jondecker76	sure but I am no expert I run some mds but with no errors yet ;-)
