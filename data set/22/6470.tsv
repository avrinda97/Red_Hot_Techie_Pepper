2007-02-23T13:11:00.000Z	bulmer	midgetg0a1	you are already booted right? so now time to plug-in your usb wifi
2007-02-23T13:57:00.000Z	midgetg0a1	bulmer	what is "modprobe ndiswrapper" supposed to do?
2007-02-23T13:58:00.000Z	bulmer	midgetg0a1	loads the module into the kernel
2007-02-23T13:59:00.000Z	bulmer	midgetg0a1	you try   ifup wlan0  yet?
2007-02-23T14:00:00.000Z	bulmer	midgetg0a1	after you have loaded ndiswrapper, you have to make it permanent, otherwise you need to reload at next boot
2007-02-23T14:02:00.000Z	midgetg0a1	bulmer	ifup wlan0 w/ it plugged in right...

2007-02-23T14:05:00.000Z	bulmer	midgetg0a1	thats why i prefer to have a sudo su -  but many here is reluctant to give you that power :(
2007-02-23T14:09:00.000Z	bulmer	midgetg0a1	read the ndiswrapper web page specifically the area for your gl132
