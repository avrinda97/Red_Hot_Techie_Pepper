2009-12-08T10:36:00.000Z	mah2223		hi guys, trying to delete a file and getting
2009-12-08T10:36:00.000Z	mah2223		"input/output error" any ideas?
2009-12-08T10:37:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	bad file/disk ?
2009-12-08T10:38:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	then try to run fsck first to check the filesystem
2009-12-08T10:40:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	where's that file? is it on different partition?
2009-12-08T10:41:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	right click on your partition
2009-12-08T10:41:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	wait, is it NTFS of ext3/4 partition?
2009-12-08T10:42:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	well, it's easiser to do it from windows (right click > properties > tools > check disk)  :D
2009-12-08T10:43:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	and safer :D
2009-12-08T11:05:00.000Z	mah2223	furuno	was your intention for the windows checkdisk thing to just fix whatever the problem is? or is there a step after
2009-12-08T11:07:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	well, since it's probably a filesystem error, and since that's NTFS, I suppose that windows is better at handling those :D
2009-12-08T11:08:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	no, chkdsk should be able to fix it, have similiar problem in the past
2009-12-08T11:09:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	what? I don't think you need to reformat...
2009-12-08T11:09:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	it just some corrupt file
2009-12-08T11:10:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	well, mine's 1 TB :D
2009-12-08T11:11:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	just be patient, go eat or do something else when it's checking
2009-12-08T11:13:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	no, NTFS is much better
2009-12-08T11:13:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	(actually ext4 :/)
2009-12-08T11:13:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	NTFS definitely
2009-12-08T11:14:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	well, is there any better windows file system :D
2009-12-08T11:16:00.000Z	furuno	mah2223	well, I think that NTFS has *much* better reliability than FAT32
