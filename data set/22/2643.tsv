2009-04-20T00:42:00.000Z	papachungo13		Hi all...total noob here with a question - how do I totally remove a program (firefox) from my system if it is not flagged as installed in the Synaptics Package list?
2009-04-20T00:43:00.000Z	noodlesgc	papachungo13	if you uninstalled it through synaptic, it should be uninstalled.
2009-04-20T00:45:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	it's still installed as v2.0.0.4
2009-04-20T00:46:00.000Z	noodlesgc	papachungo13	thats odd. which version of ubuntu are you running?
2009-04-20T00:51:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	I am running 8.10
2009-04-20T00:51:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	the 32bit version
2009-04-20T00:51:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	it was an upgrade from version 6 up
2009-04-20T00:52:00.000Z	noodlesgc	papachungo13	could run this command: cat /etc/apt/sources.list and put the results in pastebin?
2009-04-20T00:54:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	is there a specific lib I should run this in?
2009-04-20T00:55:00.000Z	noodlesgc	papachungo13	lib? just run it an a terminal
2009-04-20T00:55:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	I just ran it and it said no such file or directory
2009-04-20T00:57:00.000Z	noodlesgc	papachungo13	thats very odd. Can you pastebin the results of ls /etc/apt ?
2009-04-20T00:58:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	not very good at this, so how do I "pastebin"?
2009-04-20T00:59:00.000Z	noodlesgc	papachungo13	 go to paste.ubuntu.com and paste the link here
2009-04-20T01:01:00.000Z	papachungo13	noodlesgc	did it
