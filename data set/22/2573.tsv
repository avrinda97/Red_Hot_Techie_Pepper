2011-01-06T06:39:00.000Z	ner0x	Armageddon	You seem to be know a bit about ubuntu. How does this "Proprietary Software" find the wireless package and install?
2011-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	if you want to installl the driver for the wireless you should find it in System->Administration->Additional Drivers
2011-01-06T06:42:00.000Z	ner0x	Armageddon	I would, but the only internet connect is the wireless card, no eth0
2011-01-06T06:42:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	get an ethernet cable for a moment
2011-01-06T06:42:00.000Z	ner0x	Armageddon	Not possible.
2011-01-06T06:42:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	or find the driver package and download
2011-01-06T06:43:00.000Z	ner0x	Armageddon	The latter is what I'd like to do, where is the package repository so I can look for it.
2011-01-06T06:43:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	if you didn't update it, you won't find anything :)
2011-01-06T06:43:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	again, you need an ethernet cable
2011-01-06T06:43:00.000Z	ner0x	Armageddon	This is linux, it has to be possible to find the wireless driver package, get it to the computer, and install.
2011-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	if you don't know the name of the package there is no way around it but to either search online for the wireless driver, or plugin an ethernet and let it do it manually
2011-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	it is, find the driver
2011-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	ner0x	Armageddon	Right, I asked where the packages are located. :)
2011-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	again, if you didn't not update your database, you won't have the files needed to search among them :)
2011-01-06T06:45:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	find them on the website and download them manually but good luck finding the one you need
2011-01-06T06:45:00.000Z	ner0x	Armageddon	I meant online URL.
2011-01-06T06:45:00.000Z	Armageddon	ner0x	http://packages.ubuntu.com/
