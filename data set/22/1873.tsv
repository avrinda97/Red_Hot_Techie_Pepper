2009-12-15T16:07:00.000Z	BigBoy	airtonix	its only small i know about pastebin and use it appropritly
2009-12-15T16:07:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	if you find the manual process of interfacing with a pastebin site tedious, install pastebinit
2009-12-15T16:08:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	i assume the error code is what you get after running gimp from terminal ?
2009-12-15T16:09:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	how are you trying to install it ( there are several ways )

2009-12-15T16:12:00.000Z	BigBoy	airtonix	i know this way works i done it on another install
2009-12-15T16:13:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	is there a particular reason why you are following these steps? (as ooposed to useing the ppa repository) ?
2009-12-15T16:13:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	because that guide is more than a year out of date.
2009-12-15T16:14:00.000Z	BigBoy	airtonix	its only way i know how
2009-12-15T16:15:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	i assume you are using karmic ?
2009-12-15T16:15:00.000Z	BigBoy	airtonix	 no jaunty 9.04
2009-12-15T16:15:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	remove all current references to the chrome debs in your source list.
2009-12-15T16:16:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	also i'm not excactly sure why that guide tells you to install a crossover package
2009-12-15T16:17:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	visit here : https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa
2009-12-15T16:18:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	one more thing
2009-12-15T16:18:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	did you install cxchromium_0.9.0-1_i386.deb ? ( if so remove it )
2009-12-15T16:24:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	ok ave you tried checking if gimp works ?
2009-12-15T16:40:00.000Z	BigBoy	airtonix	 no i will check if it does
2009-12-15T16:41:00.000Z	BigBoy	airtonix	gimp works fine thanks
2009-12-15T16:42:00.000Z	airtonix	BigBoy	only other thing i can think of is that the repository server you are using is in the middle of updating its files from main server... so give it some time to do this
