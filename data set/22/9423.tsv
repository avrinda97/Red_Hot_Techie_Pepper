2005-04-04T15:14:00.000Z	KarlosII		anyone know if there any major differences between the amd 64 3200+ 939 cpu and the amd 64 3000+ 939 cpu?
2005-04-04T15:15:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	Dunno, but it's possible one has a lot more cache than the other but is the same speed.
2005-04-04T15:15:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	yeahI'm not concerned about ghz, just fuctions and featrues
2005-04-04T15:25:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	ever have a monitor go KABOOM
2005-04-04T15:27:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	so far I've on seen a mobo start on fire and give off an 3 inch flame, and a pwr supply smoke up half the storefront
2005-04-04T15:28:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	what you mean it went public already a week or two ago I thought
2005-04-04T15:28:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	Although with regards to monitors the machine my brother-in-law has seems to chew through them rather quickly, two in as many months
2005-04-04T15:29:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	ugggh......I have an auction I can get 17 to 19 inch for betwen 30 to 50 dollars cdn
2005-04-04T15:29:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	I still have 50 invites showing,  login page doesn't have a register here and the help page says it's still invite only
2005-04-04T15:30:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	I want a better monitor too
2005-04-04T15:31:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	ehehe I need to get my aunt off the bloody 14 inch :)
2005-04-04T15:32:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	It's not because they also tend to be insanely slow?
2005-04-04T15:33:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	no I don't care about that..that's the customers problem not mine, I just hate spending 30 freaking minutes or more on the phone trying to get the dang thing working
2005-04-04T15:37:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	Are the phone calls recorded? Sounds like a good place to plug a 'how to use your computer course':)
2005-04-04T15:37:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	sometims :)
2005-04-04T15:43:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	"* KarlosII is poor!" ?:)
2005-04-07T07:41:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	What, someone asked a question? *grin*
2005-04-07T07:43:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	doesn't gnome have a remote desktop manager already?
2005-04-07T07:43:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	Yeah, forgot about that, probably a half dozen other ways to get remote access to ubuntu with a gui:)
2005-04-07T07:45:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	I somehow wound up with a orange-chocolate easter eggs this year too :D
2005-04-07T07:47:00.000Z	Pizbit	KarlosII	The gnome remote desktop works well too, just got to remember to read the text beside the box that allows someone to control your desktop:)
2005-04-07T07:48:00.000Z	KarlosII	Pizbit	I don't know much about that one
