2009-05-22T09:18:00.000Z	Kangarooo		so there is ubuntu and xubuntu and fluxbuntu and kubuntu.. is there also lubuntu? ubuntu + lxde?
2009-05-22T09:19:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	you can install ubuntu mini and then install whatever you feel like
2009-05-22T09:20:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	http://ubuntu-mini-remix.crealabs.it/
2009-05-22T09:21:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	yes thanks :) I also found that page in google ok.. so you do something in this page?
2009-05-22T09:21:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	you download the iso file.. burn it.. install and get an empty ubuntu system
2009-05-22T09:22:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	or forget what i said
2009-05-22T09:24:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	no no wait.. I had and idea about while ago.. maybe this is it but already realised/released.. with this I can make ubuntu and choose what I need? xfce or kde or flux or something else? and the choose totem or thunar and firefox or opera?
2009-05-22T09:25:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2009-05-22T09:25:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	that is what i was thinking about before
2009-05-22T09:25:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	you install all the software you want to use
2009-05-22T09:26:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	so this is good for developer to make system for other companys full system then make iso somehow and then redistribute?
2009-05-22T09:27:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	can you rephrase that?
2009-05-22T09:32:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	so I had a plan later to find fastest way to make system for company with their needs- their programms. so maybe I have find now.. with this I can install this mini take steps from http://ubuntu-mini-remix.crealabs.it/ and After downloading Ubuntu Mini Remix i can use Ubuntu Customization Kit,  Reconstructor or any other tool to remaster the ISO and add the software/configurations any company wants, building their own Ubuntu based livecd.? But 
2009-05-22T09:32:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	it looks like you found the right tool
2009-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	how many computers do they have? 50? :p
2009-05-22T09:36:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	not me.. I want to advertise to companys come with theyr requirements and then theyr system to be developed at ubuntu loco team
2009-05-22T09:37:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	maybe there is already and iso witch guides installation with choosing xfce flux or kde or gdm and then witch mail agent.. and internet browser.. with pictures.. ?
2009-05-22T09:39:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	xubuntu installs xfce and firefox by default, maybe thunderbird, if not you can make a bash script which installs/removes software you want/don't want
2009-05-22T09:43:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	yes but.. one iso with choosing that all.. step 1. xfce/kde/gdm/xlfe/jaiodjf/pingpong step2. firefox/opera strep3. thunderbird/mailagent2 step4.thunar/nautilus 5. music yes/no if yes .......    and all choosings have pirctures... is there already something like that? 1 iso?
2009-05-22T09:46:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	well.. you can't have a cd with all those choices by default during installtion, just have the same system installed on all company computers
2009-05-22T09:52:00.000Z	Kangarooo	sveakex	yes of course. but a new iso could be made.. main things to be put in it.. and pictures guide what system user wants.. or even only mini and then goes choosing of system..
2009-05-22T09:53:00.000Z	sveakex	Kangarooo	well good luck with that :P
