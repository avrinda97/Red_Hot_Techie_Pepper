2006-12-28T08:08:00.000Z	lamebmx		hey .. i got a sound issue ... i got sound during boot but not on login and in my desktop enviro ... any hints out there
2006-12-28T08:08:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	did you check your mixer's volume settings?
2006-12-28T08:09:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	i cant get to those settings ... No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found. ... and other times it says to check if drivers are installed
2006-12-28T08:11:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	then there might be a problem with the modules for your sound card. 'lsmod' will show you which modules are loaded
2006-12-28T08:12:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	snd_page_alloc         11400  2 snd_intel8x0,snd_pcm
2006-12-28T08:13:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	you should have more entries than that
2006-12-28T08:14:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	I have ten lines returned by lsmod with 'snd' in them
2006-12-28T08:18:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	thats the driver for it ... ill see how many snd lines i get
2006-12-28T08:18:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	i got 10 lines also
2006-12-28T08:19:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	though i see lots of oss stuff
2006-12-28T08:19:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	have a look through /var/log/dmesg to see if there are any error messages relating to the sound card. Maybe /var/log/messages as well
2006-12-28T08:21:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	i get the boot up sound ...
2006-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	what do you mean by "the boot up sound"? The sound that's played when your desktop has loaded?
2006-12-28T08:22:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	the music before the login screen ... but after hitting enter for my password the sound dont play
2006-12-28T08:23:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	I don't get music before my login screen, but then I use kdm. It looks like your sound card  should work. What is it that makes you think it isn't workign?
2006-12-28T08:25:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	no sound will play .. and i get errors on the sound apps ... but the sound plays before i arrive at the login screen so at the base level sound is working ... but in my user area its not
2006-12-28T08:25:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	do you have another user you could log in to, and see if you can get sound as that user?
2006-12-28T08:29:00.000Z	lamebmx	BackPacker	got sound at the switch user screen .. but no sound in the test acct
2006-12-28T08:30:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	Very strange! Never heard of that before. Maybe it's a sound driver problem. I guess you're using esound under Gnome?
2006-12-28T08:31:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	but you do know if you're using Gnome,right?
2006-12-28T08:32:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	then I think you're using esound. And I'm out of ideas. And it's 2:30am here...
2006-12-28T08:32:00.000Z	BackPacker	lamebmx	I hope someone else can help...
