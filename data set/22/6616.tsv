2008-04-27T09:12:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	so do you get anything to show up after login, or just a lock, or a crash?  and can you CTRL+ALT+Backspace?
2008-04-27T09:12:00.000Z	simtower	mouseclone	it is orange background with gray box in the corner
2008-04-27T09:12:00.000Z	simtower	mouseclone	ctrl-alt-backspace works but it lcks up again if i login again
2008-04-27T09:15:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	 I am unsure of what to tell you... you could try reinstalling GDM and Gnome... but I don't know if it is your drivers or not...
2008-04-27T09:16:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	 I think that there is an Xorg config tool as well that you might try.  I cant remember
2008-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	 I did that on my wife's computer and mine.  I figured get a clean start for the LTS.  That the apt-get dist-upgrade didn't work
2008-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	simtower	mouseclone	i just have to backup the whole hard disk first and then it will take long time to get back to way it was
2008-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	 do you not have a different partition for your /home dir?
2008-04-27T09:20:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	 If you have drive space, use gparted to shrink your current partition down some.  Then cp -R your /home/username /mnt/new_partition
2008-04-27T09:24:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	rsync
2008-04-27T09:25:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	 rsync -a /path/to/folder/or/file username@server:/path/to/folder
2008-04-27T09:26:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	 rsync is not a daemon.. it is like copy.. but more of a sync
2008-04-27T09:28:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	the username@server is using SSH to connect to the remote server
2008-04-27T09:44:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	great
2008-04-27T09:44:00.000Z	mouseclone	simtower	i have moved many a web sites with that command
