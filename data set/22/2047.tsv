2009-10-22T06:31:00.000Z	BoxMagnet		can someone tell me what the proper command in ubuntu to mount a nfs file system is ?????????
2009-10-22T06:32:00.000Z	Thocrun	BoxMagnet	ntfs?
2009-10-22T06:32:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	no nfs, network file system.
2009-10-22T06:38:00.000Z	Thocrun	BoxMagnet	what server version (ex. 9.04) are you using?
2009-10-22T06:38:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	9.10
2009-10-22T06:41:00.000Z	Thocrun	BoxMagnet	sudo mount example.hostname.com:/ubuntu /local/ubuntu
2009-10-22T06:47:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	thanks.
2009-10-22T06:48:00.000Z	Thocrun	BoxMagnet	your welcome.
2009-10-22T06:48:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	had been doing it wrong for 20 mins lol
2009-10-22T06:48:00.000Z	Thocrun	BoxMagnet	I'm suprised they didn't have it on there I had problems with that before, took me a few days
2009-10-22T07:10:00.000Z	Thocrun	BoxMagnet	of course you can only go as fast as your hardware, besides using overclocking for processors

2009-10-22T07:17:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	i got nfs setup, just a subdir of the dir i got shared, i cant enter it, since root is the owner on the other box, but i did chown pete
2009-10-22T07:17:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	but i dont think it worked
2009-10-22T07:17:00.000Z	Thocrun	BoxMagnet	did you set the .conf files to the right permissions?
2009-10-22T07:17:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	not every dir is this way, jut one....
2009-10-22T07:18:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	samba works perfectly.
2009-10-22T07:18:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	one sec.
2009-10-22T07:19:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	/home/pete 192.168.1.3(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
2009-10-22T07:21:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	look at this, drwxrwxrwx 14 pete root
2009-10-22T07:21:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	chown changes only the first one to pete, not the second
2009-10-22T07:22:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	Thocrun	that dir /home/pete/storage is a mounted partition btw
