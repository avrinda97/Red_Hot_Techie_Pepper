2010-02-03T04:34:00.000Z	lacita		I accidently changed a partition table on the wrong drive, and would like to try & recover the information on that drive prior to the format. Any ideas?
2010-02-03T04:34:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	yeah, there are programs for that
2010-02-03T04:35:00.000Z	lacita	clausen	any suggestions?
2010-02-03T04:35:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	I think there are hard disk recovery live cds... let me check
2010-02-03T04:36:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	so there's http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page
2010-02-03T04:36:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	although, I can't remember the name of the best program for doing this kind of recovery
2010-02-03T04:36:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	parted / gparted has some features to do it, but it's not the best
2010-02-03T04:37:00.000Z	lacita	clausen	really looking for the best. From my experience, the more you dither with inferior products, the more likely you are not to retreive your information.\
2010-02-03T04:37:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	I wrote the parted one, btw, hehe
2010-02-03T04:38:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	I wrote the command-line one... not sure how good the graphical one is
2010-02-03T04:38:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	but there are other ones that I think work very well
2010-02-03T04:38:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	let me check
2010-02-03T04:38:00.000Z	lacita	clausen	you wrote parted? :0 Thank you, my good man, I just learnt how to use it, and love parted.
2010-02-03T04:39:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestDisk might be good?
2010-02-03T04:39:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	thanks :)  I haven't touched it in 5 years though
2010-02-03T04:39:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	if you like parted, you can use it's "rescue" command...
2010-02-03T04:40:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	it's not too bad, but it's more designed for advanced users...
2010-02-03T04:41:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	according to the wiki page, "TestDisk" is available on all the popular rescue CDs (such as parted magic, gparted live cd, system rescue cd, etc.)
2010-02-03T04:41:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	so, I'd probably try that one out!
2010-02-03T04:43:00.000Z	lacita	clausen	will do. Thank you kind sir.
2010-02-03T04:43:00.000Z	clausen	lacita	no problem.  gotta go... bye! :)
2010-02-03T04:44:00.000Z	lacita	clausen	bye
