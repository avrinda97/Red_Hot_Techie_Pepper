2011-08-20T23:09:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r		Hi, so I have ubuntu 11.04 32bit, and I want to upgrade it to 64bit. Can I do this without a cd/usb drive??
2011-08-20T23:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	you need to fresh install somehow
2011-08-20T23:10:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	Ok, an dhow about this, I have 4.5GB ram installed on my comp, and it oly detects 3.5
2011-08-20T23:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	you're using 32bit
2011-08-20T23:10:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	yeah, but it should be able to detect at least 4
2011-08-20T23:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	it's memory minus 1GB with PAE
2011-08-20T23:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	plus PAE is 3-6% slower all the time, install 64bit is best suggestion
2011-08-20T23:11:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	Ok, so how do I upgrade to 64bit without a cd/usb drive??
2011-08-20T23:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	? but you have to fresh install somehow
2011-08-20T23:12:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	but I dont have a usb drive, and my CD drive doesnt work
2011-08-20T23:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	the likely answer is YOU can't (network boot is theoretically possible, but WAY non-trivial.  AND you'd need a second box to act as a server)
2011-08-20T23:37:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	What if I took out 0.5GB ram, leaving me with 4gb, would that give me 4GB or 3?
2011-08-20T23:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	3.  PAE requires 1GB for kernel or something.  I don't use PAE, i use 64bit - i consider PAE a dirty-"hack"
2011-08-20T23:38:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	ok, ill upgrade
2011-08-20T23:39:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	As you may know, the USB-creator is REALLY messed up. Would you happen to know if I can just extract the iso onto the usb drive??
2011-08-20T23:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	unetbootin!!!
2011-08-20T23:39:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	huh?/
2011-08-20T23:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	it's a program to put ISOs onto USB - REALLY handy!
2011-08-20T23:45:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	It keeps freezing on my compo
2011-08-20T23:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	um, that's too bad.  Sorry man.
2011-08-20T23:46:00.000Z	RestlessCod3r	zykotick9	Can I just extract the iso and put tthe files on the usb stick??
2011-08-20T23:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	RestlessCod3r	not really.  The next ubuntu will probably catch up to debian and have hybrid images, which will make life a lot easier.
