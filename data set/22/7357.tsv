2006-04-22T11:01:00.000Z	green_earz	ub0ti	do you have any ports open for bittorent on your firewall ?
2006-04-22T11:03:00.000Z	green_earz	ub0ti	example port range 10000 to 10010  on your firewall and setup the same with your bittorent client
2006-04-22T11:05:00.000Z	green_earz	ub0ti	i prefer bittornado because of its control of upload  and download speed
2006-04-22T11:06:00.000Z	ub0ti	green_earz	yeah- when i was using gentoo - i alwys used that. since this is my first time trying ubuntu, am trying to feel my way arnd
2006-04-22T11:06:00.000Z	green_earz	ub0ti	sudo aptitude install bittornado-gui
2006-04-22T11:07:00.000Z	ub0ti	green_earz	- have it 'lready...didnt work from there either.
