2009-01-19T10:20:00.000Z	marabout		Can anyone help me my computer seems to be stuck at GRUB (typing this on alternate machine).
2009-01-19T10:21:00.000Z	cj	marabout	perhaps.  what does GRUB tell you?
2009-01-19T10:21:00.000Z	cj	marabout	are you at a '>' prompt or a text console with a line selected?
2009-01-19T10:22:00.000Z	marabout	cj	I am at  <username> ~$
2009-01-19T10:22:00.000Z	cj	marabout	doesn't sound like GRUB to me?
2009-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	marabout	cj	rebooted after the install and landed here... I assumed it was/is GRUB
2009-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	marabout	cj	is it normally to be in Bash immediately after installing Ubuntu (hardy alt disc)?
2009-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	marabout	cj	*normal
2009-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	cj	marabout	depends :)
2009-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	cj	marabout	probably not, though.  Did you have to log in?
2009-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	marabout	cj	on whether on is a neewb or not  :)  Yes I did have to log in
2009-01-19T10:27:00.000Z	cj	marabout	okay.  sudo apt-get install tasksel && sudo tasksel install ubuntu-desktop # IIRC
2009-01-19T10:30:00.000Z	marabout	cj	answer:  "couldnt find package taskel"
2009-01-19T10:30:00.000Z	cj	marabout	did you run the first part?  sudo apt-get install tasksel?
2009-01-19T10:31:00.000Z	marabout	cj	 yes
2009-01-19T10:31:00.000Z	cj	marabout	did you run 'sudo tasksel install ubuntu-desktop' ?
2009-01-19T10:33:00.000Z	marabout	cj	yes
2009-01-19T10:35:00.000Z	marabout	cj	I did the (hardy text-based) install got message saying remove disc reboot. Did that. Was given option of which OS at startup chose Ubuntu and landed here. Seems odd to me...
2009-01-19T10:38:00.000Z	cj	marabout	did you go through the tasksel prompts?
2009-01-19T10:39:00.000Z	marabout	cj	entering those commands only produces the "command not found" message
2009-01-19T10:40:00.000Z	cj	marabout	uhrm... what happens when you 'sudo apt-get install tasksel'?
2009-01-19T10:42:00.000Z	marabout	cj	 sorry was typing 'taskel' instead of 'tasksel" Message reads: " tasksel is already the newest version"
