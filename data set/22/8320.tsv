2005-09-10T11:04:00.000Z	the4bagger		Can somebody please help me with Xserver? Im getting a mouse error causing the GUI to fail to start
2005-09-10T11:04:00.000Z	the4bagger		um, i think so...I got my ubuntu cd's from the shipit free program
2005-09-10T11:06:00.000Z	the4bagger		im running window right now because ubuntu still wont boot the GUI
2005-09-10T11:06:00.000Z	the4bagger		windows*
2005-09-10T11:07:00.000Z	the4bagger		my mouse is still operational in windows even though i removed the ps/2 connection
2005-09-10T11:07:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	which version of ubuntu did you install?
2005-09-10T11:10:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	that url should get you past that - you can install a text irc client like sirc to connect to /server irc.freenode.net do the whole identify thing and join us here from ubuntu with the command 'sudo apt-get install sirc'
2005-09-10T11:11:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	well you could but it would be easier if you went there now and printed out the details :)
2005-09-10T15:28:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	ask the question in the channel because some may be able to answer and some may not and without your question people do not know what it is you want
2005-09-10T15:31:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	that sudo line was for you :)
2005-09-10T15:32:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	try it after you make changes and after you do other stuff - it was suggested to you to choose vesa as a short term card type :)
2005-09-10T15:36:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	have you done anything with the machine yet? you have been at it a good few hours now
2005-09-10T15:37:00.000Z	the4bagger	ompaul	that is true, but i havent been able to get a GUI up yet
2005-09-10T15:37:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	so the answer is nothing other than faffing about with a few apt-get lines
2005-09-10T15:39:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	it was suggested to you eariler to choose vesa first to get some kind of working system, did you do that, Bob2 is rather clueful
2005-09-10T15:39:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	and has the same card as you
2005-09-10T15:39:00.000Z	the4bagger	ompaul	yes, but i was still having trouble so i changed it again...
2005-09-10T15:41:00.000Z	the4bagger	ompaul	did you get my PM?
2005-09-10T15:42:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	I think you know I did :)
2005-09-10T15:43:00.000Z	the4bagger	ompaul	grrrr reinstall -^_^-
2005-09-10T15:44:00.000Z	the4bagger	ompaul	i have a problem with xserver if i try the live version too
2005-09-10T15:47:00.000Z	ompaul	the4bagger	you ask for an opinion, I gave you mine, that is all I have
