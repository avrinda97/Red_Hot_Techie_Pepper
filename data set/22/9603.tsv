2005-03-22T17:39:00.000Z	mellinux		and I'm tired of Window's spy/ad/malware
2005-03-22T17:39:00.000Z	mellinux		..which sucks. Balls.
2005-03-22T17:39:00.000Z	mellinux		Does Ubuntu support dual-montiors?
2005-03-22T17:39:00.000Z	mellinux		Monitors... yay for engrish.
2005-03-22T17:40:00.000Z	mellinux		Hahahahaha good call man...
2005-03-22T17:40:00.000Z	mellinux		I told someone to get Ad-aware 6 and Spybot for their PC one time, and I told them to go ahead and get Microsoft's anti-spyware program too
2005-03-22T17:41:00.000Z	mellinux		the linux-user said, "Don't worry about all that, just get linux."
2005-03-22T17:41:00.000Z	mellinux		wahahahaha
2005-03-22T17:42:00.000Z	mellinux		Off tangent, I tried out Ubuntu on my Pentium II dinosaur of a laptop and I wound up preferring to boot up the laptop in the mornings instead of winXP 2Ghz+ and a gig of RAM... that says a lot.
2005-03-22T17:44:00.000Z	mellinux		Is it possible to use an iPod with Ubuntu? I need something that enjoys working with AAC files without encoding them.. and while we're at it what the heck is OGG?
2005-03-22T17:44:00.000Z	bob2	mellinux	ogg is a container format like avi
2005-03-22T17:45:00.000Z	bob2	mellinux	vorbis is a Free and free lossy audio compression system, like mp3
2005-03-22T17:56:00.000Z	bob2	mellinux	vorbis certainly spanks mp3
2005-03-22T17:56:00.000Z	bob2	mellinux	I'm not sure how it compares to AAC
2005-03-22T17:56:00.000Z	bob2	mellinux	the codec you keep refering to as "ogg"
2005-03-22T17:56:00.000Z	bob2	mellinux	ogg is a container, like avi.  vorbis is an audio codec.
2005-03-22T06:00:00.000Z	bob2	mellinux	of course
