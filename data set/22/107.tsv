2012-07-12T18:55:00.000Z	macswell		I'm trying to use Komodo edit, which I just installed. But the binary says that "there are no applications available to open executable" -- I have checked "allow executing program as file". what should I do?
2012-07-12T18:56:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	try reinstalling Komodo Edit
2012-07-12T18:58:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	don't use a .sh in a terminal
2012-07-12T18:59:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	use apt-get and uninstall Komodo, then install it using apt again
2012-07-12T18:59:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	I'll give that a try, thank you
2012-07-12T19:01:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	I'm sorry, that's not working. I did not get Komodo through apt, nor is it available through ubuntu repositories
2012-07-12T19:02:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit
2012-07-12T19:02:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	Yes, that is what I'm using
2012-07-12T19:03:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	have you browsed the settings?
2012-07-12T19:04:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	it does not seem to have support for executable files
2012-07-12T19:05:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	I'm not trying to work with executables, I'm attempting to run the komod binary
2012-07-12T19:05:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	Komodo*
2012-07-12T19:06:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	komodo does not seem to have the binary codecs necessary
2012-07-12T19:08:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	have you browsed the settings?
2012-07-12T19:08:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	I cannot start the program, so I don't know how I would browse settings
2012-07-12T19:09:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	uninstall it then...
2012-07-12T19:13:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times, same issue =(
2012-07-12T19:13:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	try another editor
2012-07-12T19:13:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	I'll let you know what I find out, in case anyone else asks
2012-07-12T19:24:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	Figured it out. I'm a dumb dumb and downloaded the 32-bit installer rather than 64-bit
2012-07-12T19:24:00.000Z	macswell	codingman	Installing the 64-bit version solved my problem, thanks for your help
2012-07-12T19:24:00.000Z	codingman	macswell	glad you found the problem :P
