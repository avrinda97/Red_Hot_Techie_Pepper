2009-11-28T23:48:00.000Z	seanicus		Hey, I'm trying to install ubuntu on my family's screen, but trepare partitions step is blank
2009-11-28T23:49:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	sounds like setup is failing to detect your hard disk(s) - what output do you get from "sudo fdisk -l" in terminal?
2009-11-28T23:50:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	I get no output
2009-11-28T23:50:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	then it's not detecting any drives - what OS was on the system before?
2009-11-28T23:50:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	vista.  But they crashed it, which is why I'm installing ubuntu
2009-11-28T23:51:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	what kind of computer is it?
2009-11-28T23:51:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	as in, it doesn't even go to windows
2009-11-28T23:51:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	hp
2009-11-28T23:51:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	do you know what type of hard disk(s) are in the system? how old is it? are they SATA?
2009-11-28T23:52:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	we got it last christmas.  I dont know how to find type of harddrive or whatever SATA is
2009-11-28T23:52:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	you could open it up if you feel confident - what's your hardware and software experience like?
2009-11-28T23:52:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	I am not confident at all.
2009-11-28T23:53:00.000Z	seanicus		I have no hardware experiences
2009-11-28T23:54:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	when the computer boots, does it show any kinds of Vista related attempts at booting?
2009-11-28T23:54:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	I don't think so...I'd have to check.  But I'm pretty sure not
2009-11-28T23:54:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	I'll go on my laptop and turn off this computer.  I am sje46
2009-11-28T23:55:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	ok, i am beginning to suspect more problems than just Vista creaming itself :)
2009-11-28T23:55:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	as in, hardware problems?
2009-11-28T23:55:00.000Z	daftykins		yep
2009-11-28T23:55:00.000Z	daftykins	seanicus	i'm just getting food now, feel free to PM me when you're back or something
2009-11-28T23:55:00.000Z	daftykins		i'll be here
2009-11-28T23:55:00.000Z	seanicus	daftykins	alright
