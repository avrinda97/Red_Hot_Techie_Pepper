2007-05-17T08:57:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	turn on the system monitor and perform the offending proceedure then check the system monitor to see what is eating up al your resources
2007-08-16T16:25:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	 you can make a shortcut ot a file folder on your ntfs partition
2007-08-16T16:26:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	windows won'T realy ext3
2007-08-16T16:26:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	windows won'T reald ext3
2007-08-16T16:26:00.000Z	jscinoz	Pelo	even with the ext3ifs? that gives windows ext3 support in its shell?
2007-08-16T16:28:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	 it's not great , but you can always try, you have my suggestion,  you could also make a fat32 partition and use that for the music it can be accessed from both windows and linux
2007-08-16T16:28:00.000Z	jscinoz	Pelo	making a shared partition is my last resort atm >_<
2008-02-02T06:19:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	try asking in #compiz
2008-02-02T06:19:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	either  #compiz will get redirected
2008-02-02T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	don't use system monitor then ,  open a terminal and type top
2008-02-02T06:43:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	it 's not a bug, when starting , the gnome system monitor just asks for a lot of cpu to get up to speed with allt he prcesses , then it settles down
2008-02-02T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	jscinoz	I think that is specific to your system , not sure why, it's not  problem on mine
