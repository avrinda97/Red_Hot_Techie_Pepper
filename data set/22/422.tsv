2012-03-18T20:54:00.000Z	TorbenBeta		How can I change my Keyboard language settings in the Cli? From British to German eg?
2012-03-18T20:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	you could try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration" not sure it'll work though
2012-03-27T20:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	"top" by default.  "htop" is an improved version
2012-03-27T20:01:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	zykotick9	should I install htop? Is it much better than top?
2012-03-27T20:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	htop is IMO much better yes
2012-04-01T20:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	screen has a copy/paste, but it's only within that one screen session
2012-04-01T20:53:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	zykotick9	so I copy my string out of my txt, then paste it in my prompt?
2012-04-01T20:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	that would certainly be possible!
2012-04-01T21:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	as you sure?  try ctrl+a (release) then ".  do you get a list?  screen is kinda difficult to use at first.
2012-04-01T21:25:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	zykotick9	well yes I get a list, but still it is complicated. Also the man page is rather, err, detailed.
2012-04-01T21:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	that's for sure!  ctrl+a then c will create a new session.  copy/paste is a real challenge - 1) ctrl+a then [ 2) arrowkeys to start of highlight, spacebar, then arrow to select area, then spacebar to copy.  3) use ctrl+a then ] to paste
2012-04-01T21:32:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	zykotick9	thanks.
2012-04-01T21:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	in screen?  doesn't here.
2012-04-01T21:37:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	zykotick9	I know that of course, but in my other, full terminal no x server, workspace, which is running screen, always shows for 1 second roughly a white bar, which I take for refresh, whenever I use tab like autocomplete, but only once and then again when I press a key.
2012-04-01T21:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	i'll admit to noticing a bit of screen flicker from time to time
2012-04-01T21:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	fyi, if you actually have a mouse connected, you can install gpm which you can highlight with mouse, and paste with click
2012-04-01T21:49:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	zykotick9	in a terminal session with no x?
2012-04-01T21:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	correct :)
2012-04-01T21:50:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	zykotick9	seems usefull but where is the fun than :-)?
2012-04-01T21:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	that's when screen's split screen comes in handy
2012-04-01T21:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	to split screen - 1) ctrl+a then S 2) ctrl+a then TAB to switch between them 3) ctrl+a then X to close selected
2012-04-01T21:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	TorbenBeta	screen in screen?
