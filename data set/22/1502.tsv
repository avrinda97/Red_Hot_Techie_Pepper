2010-08-02T22:17:00.000Z	cheater99		i have a laptop with an ide drive. can i clone the drive to a sata drive and just put that drive in a new laptop and then it'll work?
2010-08-02T22:18:00.000Z	cheater99		i don't want to do a clean install
2010-08-02T22:18:00.000Z	cheater99		why would it have to have the exact same hardware?
2010-08-02T22:18:00.000Z	cheater99		wouldn't it be just like if i had upgraded my hardware?
2010-08-02T22:18:00.000Z	cheater99		new gfx card etc
2010-08-02T22:19:00.000Z	cheater99		no, my laptop is not a server
2010-08-02T22:20:00.000Z	cheater99		installing new drivers doesn't sound so bad!
2010-08-02T22:21:00.000Z	JodaZ	cheater99	ignore him, just dd it over, you might wana regenerate keys or something...
2010-08-02T22:22:00.000Z	cheater99	JodaZ	yeah, i was just trying to drag him on
2010-08-02T22:22:00.000Z	cheater99	JodaZ	keys?
2010-08-02T22:23:00.000Z	JodaZ	cheater99	like ssh priv keys
2010-08-02T22:23:00.000Z	cheater99	JodaZ	ok
2010-08-02T22:23:00.000Z	cheater99	JodaZ	that doesn't sound as back
2010-08-02T22:23:00.000Z	cheater99	JodaZ	btw, do you know if i would have to install a different kernel if upgrading from pentium 3 to core i7?
2010-08-02T22:24:00.000Z	JodaZ	cheater99	unlikely, the default kernel will propably be a i368
2010-08-02T22:24:00.000Z	cheater99	JodaZ	i don't know if ubuntu has a special kernel for different processors or if it just selects the right thing
2010-08-02T22:24:00.000Z	JodaZ	cheater99	check with uname -a
2010-08-02T22:25:00.000Z	JodaZ	cheater99	i suggest backing up your home folder and installing fresh
2010-08-02T22:26:00.000Z	JodaZ	cheater99	i mean thats what the idea is all about, usually copying whole sys over isn't a good idea
2010-08-02T22:27:00.000Z	cheater99	JodaZ	what idea?
2010-08-02T22:28:00.000Z	JodaZ	cheater99	of the home folder
