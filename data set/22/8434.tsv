2006-01-21T12:28:00.000Z	Toma-	nemik	report a bug?
2006-01-21T12:29:00.000Z	Toma-	nemik	ath0? isnt it eth0?
2006-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	nemik	Toma-	not on this computer, it is the same thing. but it uses a PCMCIA wifi card
2006-01-21T12:31:00.000Z	Toma-	nemik	are they the correct drivers?
2006-01-21T12:32:00.000Z	nemik	Toma-	drivers were fine, and i don't think xFCE4 (xubuntu-desktop) or open office touched them since it worked after i apt-got those
2006-01-21T12:34:00.000Z	Toma-	nemik	are all the settings in /etc/network/interfaces correct?
2006-01-21T12:36:00.000Z	nemik	Toma-	yes, /etc/network/interfaces seems ok
2006-01-21T12:40:00.000Z	Toma-	nemik	looks like iwlist is a bit annoying for other ppl too. (http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&threadid=363456)

2006-01-21T12:51:00.000Z	nemik	Toma-	would apt-get install ubuntu-base do a re-install off the CDROM if i had the CD in the drive?
