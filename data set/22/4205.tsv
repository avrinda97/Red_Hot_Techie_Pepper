2009-11-03T16:12:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn		hi people, trying to update / upgrade on karmik, i have problems with rsyslog (invoke-rc.d action "restart" failed)
2009-11-03T16:12:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn		can any one help ?
2009-11-03T16:13:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	you upgraded it, did you ?
2009-11-03T16:13:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	apt-get install rsyslog is that so ?
2009-11-03T16:14:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	fix is simple, start rsyslog (service rsyslog start).
2009-11-03T16:14:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	then restart the upgrade.
2009-11-03T16:33:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	paste the output of the session.
2009-11-03T17:03:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	here it is : http://pastebin.com/m465135ca
2009-11-03T17:03:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	sorry for time, I sent it to sebsebseb thinking you were the same ;)
2009-11-03T17:25:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	I stand corrected. Do a service rsyslog start then dpkg --configure -a should do the trick
2009-11-03T18:43:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	dpkg --configure -a does not do anything better
2009-11-03T18:43:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	in fact, rsyslog is not running right now and can't be restarted with service rsyslog start
2009-11-03T18:44:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	wait, it can be started, it was actually stoped, this is why restart did not work, now its running
2009-11-03T18:45:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	dpkg says "/etc/init.d/rsyslog: 46: s: not found"
2009-11-03T18:46:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	that script is corrupted, ending with a "s" line
2009-11-03T18:46:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	removing this lines gets dpkg to do its work
2009-11-03T18:47:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	should I post a bug report ?
2009-11-03T19:46:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	Maybe yes, file a bug.
2009-11-03T19:47:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	thank you
2009-11-03T19:50:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	Already done : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rsyslog/+bug/460876
2009-11-03T19:52:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	seb2	oh all right then :)
2009-11-03T21:06:00.000Z	seb2	K3rl0u4rn	Which file got an extra trailing s ?
