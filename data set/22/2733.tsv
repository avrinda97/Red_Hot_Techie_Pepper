2009-04-21T05:19:00.000Z	realraven		hello, is anyone in here good at resolve.conf?
2009-04-21T05:19:00.000Z	realraven		right :)
2009-04-21T05:20:00.000Z	realraven		so, everytime I connect to a network my resolve.conf gets alot of weird stuff in it, like nameservers from my work network that doesn't belong unless im at work
2009-04-21T05:21:00.000Z	histo	realraven	yes when you connect to vpn it will pull those nameservers
2009-04-21T05:22:00.000Z	histo	realraven	it takes a few minutes to correct it self after you disconnect
2009-04-21T05:22:00.000Z	realraven	histo	but if I don't connect to vpn I still get this
2009-04-21T05:22:00.000Z	realraven	histo	I haven't connected in a while
2009-04-21T05:23:00.000Z	realraven	histo	could stuff from my last connection to vpn got stuck somewhere? :)
2009-04-21T05:23:00.000Z	histo	realraven	well you can put any nameserver in htere you want. But perhaps your router is issuing the falty dns
2009-04-21T05:23:00.000Z	realraven	histo	different routers all the time... hotels, conferances and mine at home
2009-04-21T05:24:00.000Z	realraven		can I restore all resolve.conf settings :)
2009-04-21T05:24:00.000Z	histo	realraven	ahh well where every you last got an ip from should give you nameservers.
2009-04-21T05:24:00.000Z	histo	realraven	you can manually edit the file. sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
2009-04-21T05:24:00.000Z	realraven	histo	exactly.. but I'm stuck with the two from work and they are internal so without access all resolves take forever
2009-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	realraven	histo	yeah, and I do that.. but as it gets overwritten all of the time I'm look√≠ng for a more final solution
2009-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	histo	realraven	well like I say when you get a new ip from your home router it should be overwritten with those nameservers
2009-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	histo	realraven	as you connect to each network.
2009-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	realraven		it's like it just appends to a static one with bad nameservers in it
2009-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	histo	realraven	well how does /etc/network/interfaces look?
2009-04-21T05:27:00.000Z	realraven		just auto lo and iface lo inet loopback
2009-04-21T05:27:00.000Z	realraven		or do you mean resolvconf/run/interface?
