2007-08-21T15:31:00.000Z	coral_		fglrx(0): Virtual size is 2560x1024. why in the hell are fglrx  telling my xserver that and HOW do i get rid of it.
2007-08-21T15:32:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	looks like you're trying to use an incompatible resolution
2007-08-21T15:32:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	RTFM and reconfigure X.Org
2007-08-21T15:33:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	I have gone trough my xorg.conf a lot of times and it isn't there, belive me
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	if you RTFM'ed youd know to reconfigure it with xorgconfig or some other configuration tool
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	i have done it, already :)
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	it still messes with me
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	it isn't in the xorg.
2007-08-21T15:35:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	then you selected the wrong resolution
2007-08-21T15:35:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	Seriously, no. Ive gone trough my logfile and it is fglrx that keeps telling it this virtual piece of thing. The xorg is so clean it could be
2007-08-21T15:36:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	whats your max res
2007-08-21T15:36:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	1280x1024.
2007-08-21T15:36:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	how much video memory
2007-08-21T15:36:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	256 mb.
2007-08-21T15:36:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	then you might be in luck, hold on a second
2007-08-21T15:37:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	i hold on, yes.
2007-08-21T15:40:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	ah ok.
2007-08-21T15:41:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	Do you know where fglrx places it's own configurationfile?
2007-08-21T15:41:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	i had the idea of editing that instead
2007-08-21T15:41:00.000Z	csc`	coral_	/etc/X11/xorg.conf usually
2007-08-21T15:42:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	ok, the nasty thing is that there seems to be another config.
2007-08-21T15:46:00.000Z	coral_	csc`	I did xrandr -s 1 now, and my fluxbox is working yes. The resolution there is set at 2560 as standard, even if that resolution isn't existing in my xorg. D
