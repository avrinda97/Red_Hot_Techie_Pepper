2008-02-28T09:30:00.000Z	alandd		I cannot successfully install emdebian-tools on my brand new Kubuntu 7.10 install
2008-02-28T09:32:00.000Z	alandd		This morning it was suggest that remove all repos from synaptic and install from the live CD.  This I have just tried but it appears that emdebian-tools is not on the live CD.
2008-02-28T09:32:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	what error did you get?
2008-02-28T09:37:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	My log from this morning is here: http://pastebin.com/d651e89c4 and I get the same results just now.
2008-02-28T09:38:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	bot_ and Jack_Sparrow were worried this morning about the part "Unable to determine apt-cache policy for Debian main! at /var/lib/dpkg/info/emdebian-tools.postinst line 132."
2008-02-28T09:39:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	I am too. bad package. as a workaround you can put a dbeian repo in your sources list and apt-update then try again
2008-02-28T09:40:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	do you have a pointer to the right repo?  I don't want to "disturb" my system with the wrong mix of packages.
2008-02-28T09:40:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	the pint is to have the repo but NOT to install anything
2008-02-28T09:40:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	deb ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
2008-02-28T09:41:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	thanks
2008-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	just remove the debian again as soon as the package is installed
2008-02-28T09:43:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	and what /var/log/dpkg.log like a hawk what it does
2008-02-28T09:43:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	s/what/watch
2008-02-28T09:44:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	nickrud: thanks for the help.  I'm going the repo route and I'll watch the log
2008-02-28T09:57:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	try a debian stable repo then
2008-02-28T09:58:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	or edit the postinst script
2008-02-28T10:09:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	nickrud: I have updated my pastebin posting with the "offending" section of the postinst script.  I highlighted two lines: the first is maybe the source of the issue (what do I know?) and the second is the place where the script dies according to the line number in the error.  See http://pastebin.com/m7c5970fe
2008-02-28T10:10:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	so add gutsy or whatever
2008-02-28T10:11:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	just add "gutsy" to the list of suites?
2008-02-28T10:14:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	didn't fix it to just add "gutsy" to the list of suites.  I have nothing to base it on but that feels like the right thing to do but maybe "gutsy" is the wrong string.  Would "kubuntu" be reasonable to try?  I'm shooting in the dark here.
2008-02-28T10:16:00.000Z	wols_	alandd	what is your sources.list entry for main?
2008-02-28T10:33:00.000Z	alandd	wols_	Using carefully placed print statements I have determined that the "for (<POLICY>) {..." loop is never entered.  So something is awry with the statement before, or the results of the statement before, that is "open POLICY, "apt-cache policy |" or die "Unable to read apt policy: $!";"  Trouble for me is, I don't know that that statement does or how it does it.  I'm stuck!
