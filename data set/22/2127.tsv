2011-11-30T20:55:00.000Z	dweez		based on his initial proviso of..."modern computers"
2011-11-30T20:56:00.000Z	dweez		aureianimus, cuz he said "modern computers"
2011-11-30T20:56:00.000Z	dweez		which I interpreted as 2-3 years or newer
2011-11-30T20:57:00.000Z	dweez		where did I tab-fail?
2011-11-30T20:57:00.000Z	dweez		Oooo, mah bad
2011-11-30T20:57:00.000Z	dweez		I would
2011-11-30T20:58:00.000Z	dweez		and I'd be right
2011-11-30T20:58:00.000Z	dweez		no computer manufacturer is selling 32bit hardware now
2011-11-30T20:58:00.000Z	dweez		nor have they for probably 4 years
2011-11-30T20:58:00.000Z	dweez		but, that's off-topic sooo.../me shuts up about it
2011-11-30T20:58:00.000Z	theadmin	dweez	Um, netbooks are still mostly 32-bit, same for phones
2011-11-30T20:59:00.000Z	dweez		we're talking computers here
2011-11-30T20:59:00.000Z	dweez		not computing devices
2011-11-30T20:59:00.000Z	theadmin	dweez	netbooks are computers.
2011-11-30T21:00:00.000Z	dweez	theadmin	we can argue the semantics of it over in -offtopic if you want
2011-11-30T21:00:00.000Z	theadmin	dweez	I don't, but please try to realise that 32-bit is still a very popular and required architecture.
2011-11-30T21:00:00.000Z	dweez		in contect to Timewarper's question, I still believe my statement is true though
2011-11-30T21:01:00.000Z	dweez		Ram is not a requirement to run 64bit
2011-11-30T21:01:00.000Z	dweez		64bit just allows more memory addressing
2011-11-30T21:02:00.000Z	dweez		nope
2011-11-30T21:02:00.000Z	theadmin	dweez	What (s)he means is "64-bit is basically useless with <4 GB RAM"
2011-11-30T21:02:00.000Z	dweez	theadmin	I disagree with that statement too
