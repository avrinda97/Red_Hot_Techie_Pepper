2005-08-05T11:24:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	hehe nah just a picture of the mountians
2005-08-05T11:25:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	same here. Nice b&w lake/mountain shot
2005-08-05T11:45:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	what OS got paved over?
2005-08-05T11:45:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	FreeBSD! I will never even look at that distro again
2005-08-05T11:46:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	I have tried a couple of times. Could never get anywhere. I thought it was just me ;)
2005-08-05T11:47:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	well when they say it helps to read the handbook on it they are not kidding. You really need to read it all the way through like 3 times plus spend about 300hours trying to configure crap lol
2005-08-05T11:48:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	what really bugs me about it is they have a PC-BSD version out now. Which is easy to use like ubuntu but still is in beta. But it doesn't work well with FreeBSD
2005-08-05T11:48:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	I actually tried to install PC-BSD but it seemed to not like either my wireless keyboard or my KVM or both and I was too lazy to hooked up a wired keyboard and mouse to get it going ;) Maybe some other day
2005-08-05T11:52:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	well they are still working on it. But i'm sure they will have it working great in about a year
2005-08-05T11:54:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	you're probably right. Afterall nobody though Debian would ever be so easy to install and use eh? ;)
2005-08-05T11:56:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	well the new Suse I would have to say is awsome. 9.3 rocks but I don't like all that paying for it lol. You can get it free but it's not the same.
2005-08-05T11:57:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	I was able to get Suse Pro 9.3 with my last job. Again I had installation/upgrade issues. It's one of the reasons I mainly use Ubuntu now
2005-08-05T11:57:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	really? Installation and upgrade issues?
2005-08-05T11:57:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	But I loved 9.2
2005-08-05T11:58:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	yea. I had to turn ACPI off to get installation going. Then when it asked for the 2nd cd keyboard and mouse were not working. Again I think it has to do with my KVM maybe
2005-08-05T11:58:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	well ofcourse Suse runs slower then ubuntu and I like speed :)
2005-08-05T11:58:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	true. And I had some hotplug issues that caused bad slow down and stuttering at times
2005-08-05T11:59:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	yes Suse doesn't have as good support as ubuntu
2005-08-05T11:59:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	I admit I was surprised by that. I really thought I was gonna have trouble with my external hard drive and usb key. Everything just worked
2005-08-05T11:59:00.000Z	vinux	Gatton	:)
2005-08-05T12:01:00.000Z	Gatton	vinux	Here's some screenshots of Xen in action   http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/screenshots/index.html
