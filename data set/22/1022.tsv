2010-11-13T01:48:00.000Z	Djokera		i`m always saying something twice when i need help and especially at massive channels because it happens often nobody to see my question.
2010-11-13T01:49:00.000Z	Djokera		thank you and mind your attitude when trying to help - it does not make a good impression ...
2010-11-13T01:50:00.000Z	Djokera		if they were not any requirements about ircd client when linking a server to a national network - I would never use linux ... it sux - the most unfriendly operating system in the world ... when it comes to ANYTHING ... they shall forbid it ... jeesh

2010-11-13T01:51:00.000Z	Djokera		why am i even talking to freaks ... what a pathetic excuse for an OS Linux is ... Linux developers should kill themselves ...
