2006-05-13T15:22:00.000Z	Nihil_85		hi everyone! i have a problem: today i mounted an Ati radeon 9550. The drivers installation went allright, but the screen flicks too much. Sometimes i even can't see what's on the monitor. I've setted properly the refresh (1280+1024 @60hz) like the monitor's manual tell to do. So what's the problem?
2006-05-13T15:22:00.000Z	Nihil_85		please help me, i'm getting an headache with all this flicks!
2006-05-13T15:23:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	try not specifying refresh rates and letting X guess 'em
2006-05-13T15:24:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	i've tried the simplified monitor rilevation, but it doesn't work so good...
2006-05-13T15:26:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	maybe you're blinking too much
2006-05-13T15:26:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	the monitor is blinking, not me!
2006-05-13T15:30:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	is your xorg using DDC?
2006-05-13T15:30:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	i don't know ddc
2006-05-13T15:32:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	what's DDC?
2006-05-13T15:33:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	um... it autodetects monitor settings
2006-05-13T15:33:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	it's an X module...
2006-05-13T15:33:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	just say 'Load "ddc"' in your Modules section
2006-05-13T15:33:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	and comment out your HorizSync, etc.
2006-05-13T15:34:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	and maybe it'll do it all automagically
2006-05-13T15:34:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	can we talk in pvt?
2006-05-13T15:34:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	no... i forgot my nickserv password
2006-05-13T15:34:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	foget: i canno ttalk in pvt, i'm not registered
2006-05-13T15:34:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	i've already uncommented the hsync and vsync
2006-05-13T15:35:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	no, COMMENT them out... and Load "ddc" module, then maybe X will recognize your monitor automatically
2006-05-13T15:36:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	reconfigure-xorg auto-recognize the brand of the monitor. Then where i have to write the DDC module? in the xorg.conf?
2006-05-13T15:36:00.000Z	graft	Nihil_85	err.. yeah. someone else can probably help you out with editing your xorg.conf, i have to go... sorry
2006-05-13T15:36:00.000Z	Nihil_85	graft	don't worry, thanks!
