2008-03-08T10:03:00.000Z	Atlantiz		any python gurus around that I can pm, I have a hard question
2008-03-08T10:04:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	just ask. Waiting for a guru may take ages. Also, there are other channels specialized on programming.
2008-03-08T10:08:00.000Z	Atlantiz		ok then here it is, I forgot the password to my router so now I have to run a python script that will allow me to access the settings page. I am able to run it on the terminal but it returns a successful access on html code. I need to actually access the settings page on a web browser. Anyway I figured that I had to set up python to work with my apache2 server to try the script. And after some tinkering around it returns thi
2008-03-08T10:08:00.000Z	Atlantiz		s error: http://pastebin.ca/933215 and  here is the code: http://pastebin.ca/933224
2008-03-08T10:10:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	can't you do a hard reset on the router? Like with a paper clip or something?
2008-03-08T10:11:00.000Z	Atlantiz		i'd rather not do a hard reset, the code gives a successful 200 ok code and shows some of the html code...I think with a little help i can get it to work
2008-03-08T10:15:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	I just noticed that your code gives and indentation error
2008-03-08T10:15:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	your index(req) function is empty?
2008-03-08T10:16:00.000Z	Atlantiz	vocx	to be honest I don't know a lot about coding, I've been researching the topic for sometime and this is as far as I could get
2008-03-08T10:18:00.000Z	Atlantiz	vocx	if i remove the index(req) function the code works under a terminal
2008-03-08T10:18:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	well I don't exactly know about sockets, but try commenting out that line "def index(req):"
2008-03-08T10:22:00.000Z	Atlantiz	vocx	without the line the script will not show as not found by the web server. However this is what I mean by it working under terminal: http://pastebin.ca/933239
2008-03-08T10:24:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	so it works? Now what? You want to send that to a html page?
2008-03-08T10:24:00.000Z	Atlantiz		yes
2008-03-08T10:24:00.000Z	Atlantiz		that's what i've been trying to do
2008-03-08T10:28:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	well, I'm not sure. You would need to know which function generates the code and send it to a file object. Or maybe you can just redirect the output like "python getin.py > file.html"
2008-03-08T10:29:00.000Z	Atlantiz	vocx	thank you I will start my search in that direction :D
2008-03-08T10:31:00.000Z	Atlantiz	vocx	file.html was generated and although it doesn't provide access, it shows the access page saved :)
2008-03-08T10:32:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	so, I'm a genius? Or there are still issues?
2008-03-08T10:33:00.000Z	Atlantiz	vocx	there are still some issues...as the I only have access to the "saved" file not the actual .htm page
2008-03-08T10:34:00.000Z	vocx		Windows is good or bad is offtopic. Don't discuss it here.
2008-03-08T10:36:00.000Z	vocx	Atlantiz	and the actual .htm is in the router, right?
