2005-05-15T14:38:00.000Z	DuaneAllman		hi everybody, where could I find an alternative precompiled kernel for hoary? I have problems with the default one provided in the distribution
2005-05-15T14:40:00.000Z	DuaneAllman		or I'll break the system?
2005-05-15T14:41:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	what is the problem?
2005-05-15T14:41:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	there's no way to activate DMA on ide drives on boot.
2005-05-15T14:41:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	only on CDROM...
2005-05-15T14:42:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	and this is an expected and wanted behaviour
2005-05-15T14:42:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	yes, sorry, on CDROMs, hdds are OK
2005-05-15T14:42:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	it's not a bug
2005-05-15T14:43:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	it wouldn't be a bug if it woul be possible to activate it via hdparm.conf, but as I edit that file the system randomly hangs on boot.
2005-05-15T14:44:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	it is not a bug.. ther reason why it is disabled by default is because DMA on cdrom, breaks on more systems that people can imagine.
2005-05-15T14:44:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	I've always used DMA on all linux boxes I had on this system without a single problem
2005-05-15T14:45:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	you have been lucky
2005-05-15T14:46:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	so, now suppose I happy with a problematic system with dma activated, how can I activate it on boot?
2005-05-15T14:46:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	hdparm -c 1 -d 1 /dev/<whatever_cdrom_you_have>
2005-05-15T14:47:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	if it hangs at boot like you said, well than you are seeking for troubles playing with DMA :)
2005-05-15T14:48:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	you're discouraging me to use ubuntu, man. dma on my system worked _very_ well on all linux systems I've tryed. so this MUST be a bug
2005-05-15T14:48:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	file one, and i will close it straigh away.. it's no a bug again...
2005-05-15T14:48:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	ubuntu is a choise... nobody forces it to you
2005-05-15T14:49:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	I know, I use it because I like it, in warty dma worked without problems
2005-05-15T14:49:00.000Z	fabbione	DuaneAllman	no, it didn't.. it was still disabled by default.
2005-05-15T14:50:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	no, it was enabled: hdparm -d /dehdc returned 1
2005-05-15T14:56:00.000Z	DuaneAllman	fabbione	now I try to install a warty kernel and I'll let you know. please don't take my previous discussion as a flame war
