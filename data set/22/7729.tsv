2006-01-27T08:41:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz		what about XFCE anyone like that?
2006-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	I quite like it -- especially on older hardware
2006-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	xfce4 is light, yet quite functional
2006-01-27T08:43:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	Xenguy	yea i was thinking of using it on my 1000mhz celeron
2006-01-27T08:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	it's worth a look, certainly
2006-01-27T08:44:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	Xenguy	you think xfce would be a big speed improvement over gnome for a 1000mhz celeron?
2006-01-27T08:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	dunno for sure in your case, but I do know that xfce is noticably faster than gnome on older hardware
2006-01-27T08:45:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	Xenguy	hmm the pc does have 512 ram, so it might not be a huge improvement
2006-01-27T08:45:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	try it, that's the only way to judge for your hardware
2006-01-27T08:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	xfce loads faster (by about half), and things feel 'snappier'
2006-01-27T08:47:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	Xenguy	how do i access the gnome configurator, or whatever it's called
2006-01-27T08:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	gnome-control-center  ?
2006-02-26T09:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	a different operating system
2006-02-26T09:28:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	Xenguy	is it a unix, a linux or what
2006-02-26T09:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	unix related, but wikipedia knows best
2006-02-26T09:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	look on the Install wiki page for something like 'network install'
2006-02-26T09:31:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	Xenguy	so  all i need for that pc is a network card? and i can install ubuntu on it?
2006-02-26T09:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	I have no idea since I've never tried it, but it sounds plausible.  Read the web page instructions carefully :-)
2006-02-26T11:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	man apt-get (there's an option for reinstall)
2006-02-26T11:12:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	Xenguy	what option ..
2006-02-26T11:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	man apt-get
2006-02-26T11:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	CanYouHelpMePlz	sounds about right
