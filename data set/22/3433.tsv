Where KDE runs 3d games work great and opengl is fine but the desktp has choppyness when you scroll in a web page or move a window. and I mean more choppyness then when I had no video drivers installed in KDE was way smoother.
2009-12-14T16:06:00.000Z	[SilverFox]		I just did
2009-12-14T16:06:00.000Z	[SilverFox]		in fact I formated
2009-12-14T16:06:00.000Z	[SilverFox]		and redid it with 9.11
2009-12-14T16:07:00.000Z	[SilverFox]		on 9.10
2009-12-14T16:07:00.000Z	[SilverFox]		all of it
2009-12-14T16:07:00.000Z	[SilverFox]		all the windowd choppy
2009-12-14T16:07:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	Which model card do you have?
2009-12-14T16:12:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	The problem is the proprietary driver. Before you installed, you were using the open radon driver, which now has 3D support for your card if you use latest kernel and components from the xorg-edgers repo. You can only use the open driver if fglrx is completely removed from the system
2009-12-14T16:12:00.000Z	[SilverFox]	soreau	a friend did it for me im new to linux he wanted me to use it I want to use it. He did install it but I was getting bad Frames and the 2d glitch still was effecting the desktop
2009-12-14T16:13:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	Without latest components from xorg-edgers repo and latest kernel, you will only have 2D with that card
2009-12-14T16:13:00.000Z	[SilverFox]	soreau	problem was 3d works amazing 2d blows
2009-12-14T16:19:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	The open driver is going to e a lot better in the long run. It has always been the default in ubuntu but now it even has 3D support for your card too. It is so new, that it did not quite make it into jaunty which is why you would have to use xorg-edgers repo driver components and latest kernel
2009-12-14T16:20:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	But the open driver cannot work while fglrx is installed
2009-12-14T16:20:00.000Z	[SilverFox]	soreau	I'm really new to this if I don't follow a detailed instruction I fail
2009-12-14T16:21:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	Well just know you do not need to install a driver. It will work OOTB, even with 3D in Lucid
2009-12-14T16:23:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	For now, you can try turning off desktop visual effects to see if that helps
2009-12-14T16:24:00.000Z	[SilverFox]	soreau	I just tired that they were already disabled
2009-12-14T16:24:00.000Z	[SilverFox]	soreau	was like my desktop knew it sucked
2009-12-14T16:24:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	What is the output of fglrxinfo?
2009-12-14T16:26:00.000Z	soreau	[SilverFox]	The only other thing I could think of is to adjust settings in amdcccle and see if any help
2009-12-14T16:26:00.000Z	[SilverFox]	soreau	amdcccle? never heard of it
