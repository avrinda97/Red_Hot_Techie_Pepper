2007-04-15T05:22:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	did it just stop working, or has it not ever worked?
2007-04-15T05:22:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	it just stopped
2007-04-15T05:24:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	forgive me for asking dumb, help-desk type questions. Are you using external speakers?
2007-04-15T05:24:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	it didn't work
2007-04-15T05:26:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	sorry, i didn't understand the reply. are you using external speakers or headset?
2007-04-15T05:27:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	yea, external speakers
2007-04-15T05:27:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	and drivers and such through terminal, it seems fine. adaptr was helping e earlier
2007-04-15T05:28:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	also checked the volume control to make sure nothing got muted? (I am going somewhere with this bear with me)
2007-04-15T05:29:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	how cani see if it's muted in alsamixer/
2007-04-15T05:30:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	not familiar with that app. have you right-clicked the little loudspeaker icon in the right hand side of the top menu bar. That will open a volume control where you can check various settings.
2007-04-15T05:30:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	i took that icon out, heh
2007-04-15T05:33:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	OK. no worries. I'm running out of ideas since I don't know the audio app you're using. Sound quit on me last night (running Dapper) and I got it going again by rebooting. I know that's coarse and crude, and displays my own ignorance (chuckle) but it did work. Sorry I didn't have the answer.
2007-04-15T05:33:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	it's working now :D but, my sound is staticy if it gets too loud. Any idea what that might be? And, do you know of a good player with an equailzer? simple one, but not too simple
2007-04-15T05:34:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	spotted one in a book the other day. gimme a min to find...
2007-04-15T05:36:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	book "ubuntu linux for non-geeks" recommends xmms, available in synaptic
2007-04-15T05:36:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	didn't like that one tbh
2007-04-15T05:38:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	good to know. thanks. glad you've got some audio back anyway.
2007-04-15T05:38:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	word
2007-04-15T05:45:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	installing correct driver improved my sound. have you searched google or the forums for driver help on your sound card?
2007-04-15T05:45:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	kind of
2007-04-15T05:46:00.000Z	foug	iowadave	i try to follow guides like this, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSetupSoundCards, but it never works
2007-04-15T05:46:00.000Z	iowadave	foug	it's one of those hair-te4aring things that reep mentioned. But if you can find a how-to on your sound card then you don't have to wait for feisty.
