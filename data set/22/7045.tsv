2007-08-10T09:04:00.000Z	Bogus8		not sure I like having so many packages installed by default.... I like being able to select a more basic start and build from there
2007-08-10T09:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	get the server
2007-08-10T09:05:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	well, I wanted the desktop enviroment but not things like gimp and open office (though I would install those personally)
2007-08-10T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	you might want to go with another distro
2007-08-10T09:07:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	you should try arch
2007-08-10T09:08:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	well, I like the idea of having a broad user base and there for more prebuilt packages availible
2007-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	there are 9000 prebuilt packages in the repositories and thousands more the the user repository
2007-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	you talking about ubuntu right?
2007-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	arch
2007-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	and by comparison how many are there in ubuntu?
2007-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	it installs base system, you use binary package manager to get whatever else
2007-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	its hard to compare because ubuntu separates headers into different packages
2007-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	so nearly every package has another -dev package, whereas arch just puts them together like sane people, so ubuntu really has about half of what it would show
2007-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	but I would imagine with the user base that ubuntu has it must have the biggest repos of binaries
2007-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	last time I checked it had 18,000 or so, which you cut in half and you are right around the same, also have to recognize the existence of quite a few meta packages which fill up even more space
2007-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	I'm definitely going to check it out
2007-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	bruenig	Bogus8	kernel is the only thing that ever requires reboot
2007-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	word
2009-07-16T06:40:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	I can read, thanks.
2009-07-16T06:41:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	right... and so when I suggest that the bot might be a little too sensative it warrants repeating to me what the bot already said?!
2009-07-16T06:41:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	how is that not the same attitude thing?
2009-07-16T06:43:00.000Z	Bogus8	bruenig	apparently I was wrong... the floodbot isn't sensative enough... it hasn't kicked you out yet.
