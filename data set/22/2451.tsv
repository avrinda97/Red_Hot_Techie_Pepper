2011-02-18T06:29:00.000Z	CoNFuS3D		hi, when I do "sudo usermod -a -G audio,pulse-access,pulse-rt" it says that the group "audio,pulse-access,pulse-rt" does not exist, any ideas?
2011-02-18T06:31:00.000Z	CoNFuS3D		anyone?
2011-02-18T06:32:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	try putting spaces
2011-02-18T06:38:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	Hang on, I'm reading the man page (which is what you should be doing)
2011-02-18T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	what are you actually trying to do?
2011-02-18T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	Was it the second command there that was giving you problems?
2011-02-18T06:40:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	type it for me please?  I wanna see what you're writing. Also, what error does it give you?
2011-02-18T06:42:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	the -a option is missing the username I believe.  try this: sudo usermod -a <you> -G audo,pulse,...
2011-02-18T06:42:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	let me know what happens
2011-02-18T06:44:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	put your username at the end of the command
2011-02-18T06:44:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	what pyroscope said
2011-02-18T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	(that's not the same error) just add that group
2011-02-18T06:46:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	no problem
2011-02-18T07:00:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	link me the article again
2011-02-18T07:00:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	sudo apt-get install pulesaudio  then do the last command
2011-02-18T07:01:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	what's the error
2011-02-18T07:02:00.000Z	edbian	CoNFuS3D	can you just sudo service pulseaudio start    ?
