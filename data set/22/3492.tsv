2012-04-15T02:32:00.000Z	shazzner		I am really at my wits end here, cause I'm literally driving blind
2012-04-15T02:32:00.000Z	shazzner		my laptop's primary screen is broken
2012-04-15T02:33:00.000Z	shazzner		trying to swtich to the second monitor
2012-04-15T02:33:00.000Z	shazzner		the second monitor works and displays fine on the livecd
2012-04-15T02:33:00.000Z	shazzner		when I boot into ubuntu it turns off that display
2012-04-15T02:33:00.000Z	shazzner		how on earth can I swtich it if I can't see? :(
2012-04-15T02:35:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	if you can find the documentation for your laptop, there should be a key combination to switch your display between the laptops display and external display..
2012-04-15T02:36:00.000Z	shazzner	wylde	I've tried the key combination that should switch monitors, doesn't work though :/
2012-04-15T02:37:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	or you can do what I did with an old dell laptop. I physically removed the broken screen from the laptop and it then defaulted to the external display.
2012-04-15T02:37:00.000Z	shazzner	wylde	ha, I'm not sure I'm at that point yet but I'll add that to my list of options
2012-04-15T02:38:00.000Z	shazzner	wylde	the problem is, everything works ok on the livecd. I don't know why it would suddenly turn off the second display once I booted in proper
2012-04-15T02:38:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	other than the key combo and removing the broken screen that's all the ideas I have atm.
2012-04-15T02:38:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	I think the live cd mirrors all displays by default
2012-04-15T02:39:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	but once installed it will only work on what the system thinks is the primary display
2012-04-15T02:39:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	at least until comfigured differently
2012-04-15T02:41:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	if you wanted to do the research or can get someone good with bash scripting, you could possibly work out a boot script to configure the external display as primary.
2012-04-15T02:43:00.000Z	shazzner	wylde	I'm trying to blind install openssh-server so I can at least edit the configs and such
2012-04-15T02:43:00.000Z	shazzner	wylde	not easy :(
2012-04-15T02:46:00.000Z	shazzner	wylde	what is the config file the open source drivers use? Xorg.conf isn't present
2012-04-15T02:47:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	I'm pretty sure openssh-server automatically starts after install. I wonder if putting 'apt-get -y install openssh-server' in rc.local would work. Then remove it after you have ssh access
2012-04-15T02:48:00.000Z	shazzner	wylde	hmm ok I'll try that
2012-04-15T02:48:00.000Z	wylde	shazzner	I believe the current x-org doesn't use it unless you specifically need it for speacial hardware/support.
