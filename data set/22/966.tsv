2010-12-28T13:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	try adding Indicator Applet 0.3.7 to the pannel
2010-12-28T13:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	spencer__: I've had the same problem when I deleted my mail icon from the top pannel,  it is also part of the volume in Indicator Applet
2010-12-28T13:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	right click on clear space on the top panel and select add to pannel and select add Indicator applet
2010-12-28T13:24:00.000Z	cowslammer	sacarlson	that added another mailbox notifier but not the sound
2010-12-28T13:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	oh that weird, what version of ubuntu and indicator is that?
2010-12-28T13:25:00.000Z	cowslammer	sacarlson	i'm on 10.04 - dunno which version of the applet
2010-12-28T13:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	right click the applet and look at about
2010-12-28T13:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	maybe it's a theme thing?  did you change your theme?
2010-12-28T13:26:00.000Z	cowslammer	sacarlson	it is 0.3.7
2010-12-28T13:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	same as me,  I have no clue
2010-12-28T13:27:00.000Z	cowslammer	sacarlson	plenty of room
2010-12-28T13:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	just use <alt><ctl>+f1  to get to a console and sudo halt,  if that's what you need
2010-12-28T13:35:00.000Z	cowslammer	sacarlson	more weirdness - i can't get a con terminal - it's just a blank screen
2010-12-28T13:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	how's that posible?  it uses no graphics
2010-12-28T13:36:00.000Z	cowslammer	sacarlson	unknown.  in an earlier incarnation i didn't even get the blank screen
2011-01-04T09:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	you want to update the drivers on the hd from the live cd don't you?
2011-01-04T09:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	you might need to get some packages installed from a working system and put them on a cd or file with http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/
2011-01-04T09:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	if you already have the driver installed then just modprobe b43  or the legacy driver http://wiki.debian.org/bcm43xx
2011-01-04T09:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	you might see if the command iwconfig  dispays your wifi device
2011-01-04T09:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	you need to readd the Indicator Applet 0.3.7 to the pannel,  I deleted mine when I didn't want the email icon but the volume is connected
2011-01-04T09:56:00.000Z	cowslammer	sacarlson	that gets me a second mailbox icon but no speaker
2011-01-04T09:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	cowslammer	bummer
