2007-10-27T08:04:00.000Z	curi0		hello ubuntu users!
2007-10-27T08:05:00.000Z	curi0		How do I know if synaptic package manager is downloading only from Gutsy Repositories?
2007-10-27T08:06:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	if you only have gutsy repos enabled then it will only download from them
2007-10-27T08:08:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	it _will_ only use what's in sources.list
2007-10-27T08:08:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	it doesn't get any info from anywhere else
2007-10-27T08:08:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	that helps!
2007-10-27T08:09:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	let me add the ubuntu repositories to my list. I'll be back buddy, thank you!
2007-10-27T08:09:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	the gutsy repos to my list *rephrase*
2007-10-27T08:10:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	the only time it would not download from a designated repo is if you downloaded a package that then goes and downloads something from somewhere else itself, such as the flash plugin i think
2007-10-27T08:14:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	can I add "main restricted universe multiverse" to the six ubuntu gutsy repositories that I have?
2007-10-27T08:16:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	if you want, yes
2007-10-27T08:16:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	enabling them via System > Administration > Software Sources, might be simpler
2007-10-27T08:17:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	I prefer learning the location of files because I've been bringing this system back from the dead :) I'll just edit my sources.list. I'm not afraid!
2007-10-27T08:18:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	I used to be like that, now I'm just lazy :P
2007-10-27T08:20:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	I can't be lazy right now because I have no cdrom drive and I installed Edgy from my USB. And since the installation I've been configuring and breaking things and fixing them from the prompt with the wonderful use of dpkg, and apt-get.
2007-10-27T08:25:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	here I go, on my way to re-installing the crucial system applications and deleting my xorg.conf files.
2007-10-27T08:31:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf*  ??
2007-10-27T08:55:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	You there?
2007-10-27T08:56:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	yeh
2007-10-27T08:57:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	what's the compiz channel?
2007-10-27T08:58:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	curi0	#compiz-fusion
2007-10-27T08:58:00.000Z	curi0	Atomic_UE	Thank you!
