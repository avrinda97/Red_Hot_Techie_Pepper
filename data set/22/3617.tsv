2008-07-21T14:42:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	which other package. and do you need the other program.
2008-07-21T14:49:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	Yeah, but I've only got 2 packages relative to ATI, can try
2008-07-21T14:49:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	that might not be a good idea. you need the name of the package you want to remove.
2008-07-21T14:49:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	why is that?
2008-07-21T14:51:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	just blindly uninstalling stuff will potenially break your system/packages.
2008-07-21T14:52:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	also know as tty's
2008-07-21T14:52:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	I guess... but I don't know at all what to do now :(
2008-07-21T14:52:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	I'm dualbooting this with Vista, don't wanna use Ubuntu if it won't work properly....
2008-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	is it possible to, as in windows, restore system to restorepoints?
2008-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	fair enough but linux is all about learning and probing and being better than preinstalled/preworking fun.
2008-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	only with backups
2008-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	ok.. well so damn irritating since it was working fine first couple of days
2008-07-21T14:56:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	so what changed between then and now...
2008-07-21T14:56:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	installing the ati drivers?
2008-07-21T14:57:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	I'm not sure. I had problems with the resolutions at first, so a lot of changes were made... but would Ubuntu come with ATI drivers pre-installed?
2008-07-21T14:58:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	no it wouldn't they are restricted drivers.
2008-07-21T14:59:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	as are the nvida ones
2008-07-21T14:59:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	so then I might want to try removing everything that has to do with ATI?
2008-07-21T15:01:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	seems like you have no other choice.
2008-07-21T15:01:00.000Z	Blaqlight	mefi	when I did apt-cache search ati it came up with tons of packages, be careful.
2008-07-21T15:15:00.000Z	mefi	Blaqlight	I searched for fglrx though, and got about 10 pakcages relative to ATI graphics, and about 3 installed..
