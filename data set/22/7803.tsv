2005-12-26T17:13:00.000Z	SweetestSavage		What's the command to remove directories?
2005-12-26T17:14:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	rmdir
2005-12-26T17:14:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	but rm -rf works (use with care)
2005-12-27T15:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	What program are you using?
2005-12-27T15:31:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	the Archive Manager
2005-12-27T15:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	yes there is
2005-12-27T15:32:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	may I ask what it is?
2005-12-27T15:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	Not sure what it is though. Let me see.
2005-12-27T15:32:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	Ah, okay. Thanks
2005-12-27T15:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	The command is "unzip"
2005-12-27T15:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	Shoulda guessed that I think! try "unzip file.zip"
2005-12-27T15:34:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	ah, thanks =)
2005-12-27T15:37:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	ah it worked beautifully
2006-01-01T16:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	Install universe repo
2006-01-01T16:33:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	how would I "install" it?
2006-01-01T16:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	You can run a search, but for unrarring, you need unrar-free and unrar-nonfree
2006-01-01T16:35:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	alright.. I guess I don't have certain repos set up, one sec
2006-01-01T16:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	check your messages from ubotu
2006-01-01T16:37:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	weird. When I go to add the nonfree and community maintained ones, and hit OK, it doesn't save the preference.
2006-01-01T16:38:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	You need run run a "sudo apt-get update"
2006-01-01T16:38:00.000Z	Stormx2	SweetestSavage	Then re-open synaptic
2006-01-01T16:38:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	Stormx2	Oh yeah.. good idea. Stupid me
