2006-01-19T10:13:00.000Z	tristanmike		I have a file system problem can anyone help me out?
2006-01-19T10:13:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	we'll do our best... what is the issue?
2006-01-19T10:14:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	have you scanned the file system?
2006-01-19T10:15:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	okay.... could you be more specific as to what you want help with.... unless we know the goal we can't help you much
2006-01-19T10:16:00.000Z	tristanmike	koruptpryde	apt is broken, locks up my system
2006-01-19T10:16:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	uhm... sorry to say it... that partition is trashed
2006-01-19T10:16:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	I might recommend in the future using reiserfs... tends to be more forgiving
2006-01-19T10:18:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	from what I can tell it is saying it cannot read the file system at all.... which could mean that the drive is going bad (usually does) or that something really really b0rked the data
2006-01-19T10:19:00.000Z	tristanmike	koruptpryde	yeah, I kinda expected the drive to be bad, the fact that I got Linux on here kinda suprised me, but I thought that I was just wrong...is it a bad blocks related issue, can't I just isolate the bad blocks if it is?
2006-01-19T10:20:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	well... usually a journalling filesystem can compensate for some bad blocks.... but in this case it looks like there is massive damage
2006-01-19T10:21:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	if you want to know more in depth about the error message's meaning in detail I recommend wikipedia
2006-01-19T10:21:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	I know this is little comfort... but i recommend in the future using either ext3 or reiserfs... they tend to be more forgiving than ext2
2006-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	tristanmike	koruptpryde	wait, I'm using ext2?? is that the default Ubuntu installation fs?
2006-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	probably...... I *ALWAYS* switch from the default to reiserfs...... some of the distros have very very strange defaults
2006-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	koruptpryde	that's odd, my fs upstairs is ext3, but then again, that installation went differently, during the install, how do I select filesystem?
2006-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	when you go to do the partitioning and it shows you the proposed structure you go back and change it
2006-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	koruptpryde	right, just go back
2006-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	exactly
2006-01-19T10:29:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	it is in the go back... promise
2006-01-19T10:29:00.000Z	tristanmike	koruptpryde	lol, it seems very logical anyway..plus I never _did_ try it
2006-01-19T10:37:00.000Z	koruptpryde	tristanmike	/j #help-tristanmike
2006-01-19T10:37:00.000Z	tristanmike	koruptpryde	when I select "go back" that allows me to set the swap size too, doesn't it?
