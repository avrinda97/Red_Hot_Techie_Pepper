2008-03-08T06:40:00.000Z	zdux00tv		hi I'm trying to create a bootable USB drive, I'm having trouble. I use dd to copy an image onto a UDB disk, the command was dd if=disk.img of=/dev/sdb1  Should I have used /dev/sdb instead?
2008-03-08T06:41:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	no, the command looks all right. Were you following a guide?
2008-03-08T06:42:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	yes I'm getting an error PXE... which is a network card issue? So I think my usb device isn't getting detected
2008-03-08T06:43:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	yes, it's either not even trying to boot from USB (which you should fix via BIOS setup), or there is no suitable boot sector. Some hardware won't boot off USB at all.
2008-03-08T06:43:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	did you partition and format the USB device before you used the dd?
2008-03-08T06:44:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	the bios lists USB HDD as  first to boot. So maybe it's the image? I didn't format the USB, just using dd so I thought it was unnecessary
2008-03-08T06:45:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	In gparted, it lists the card as fat and bootable
2008-03-08T06:45:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	did you dd *from* a fat filesystem as well?
2008-03-08T06:47:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	well, this OS is ext, the dd image is fat (at least I think it is)
2008-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	gparted lists the usb as fat16, and on it I see various files, so it looks  like it is not corrupted
2008-03-08T06:48:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	I think you should have a look at the install page -- it links to instructions for USB HD installations. Private message...
2008-03-08T06:49:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	also gparted reports that it is flagged as bootable
2008-03-08T06:49:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	I'm using irssi (text based irc) not sure if I have private messages,, I'll go check the offical site and see if I missed a step
2008-03-08T06:49:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	the bootable flag doesn't matter these days -- well, only to DOS MBRs. Which makes me think: did you install grub to the device?
2008-03-08T06:50:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	if not, the installation link ^^ will guide you
2008-03-08T06:51:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	the computer currently has gOS installed, and grub is installed
2008-03-08T06:51:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	thanks for your help
2008-03-08T06:51:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	you need grub on the USB HD as well
2008-03-08T06:51:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	ahh,, that might be it
2008-03-08T06:52:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	any way to tell? I can see some files on it
2008-03-08T06:52:00.000Z	soundray	zdux00tv	if you didn't consciously put it in the MBR, it won't be there. Use the link ^^
2008-03-08T06:52:00.000Z	zdux00tv	soundray	I think that's it then thanks
