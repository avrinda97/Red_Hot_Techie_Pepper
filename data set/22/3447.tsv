2008-09-03T19:19:00.000Z	aconrad		hi, if I want to install eclipse, will "apt-get install eclipse" install the official version of java or the "free" one ?
2008-09-03T19:20:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	can't say for sure but likely the free one... - give it a go.
2008-09-03T19:21:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	suppose it depends which sources you have enabled.
2008-09-03T19:22:00.000Z	aconrad	thesaint4444	I don't see anything about the "sun-java-6" in the listed packages when I hit enter
2008-09-03T19:22:00.000Z	aconrad		maybe if I install sun-java-6 first, will won't try to install the free version ...
2008-09-03T19:24:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	why don't you  just give it a go and see what happens. I have done it before a while ago. it will cry about deps later if necessary.
2008-09-03T19:24:00.000Z	aconrad	thesaint4444	ok
2008-09-03T19:25:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	I seem to remeber it was a bit of a pain getting the right java but the way to do it is start with eclipse and go from there.
2008-09-03T19:25:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	what are you using eclipse for?
2008-09-03T19:27:00.000Z	aconrad	thesaint4444	I'll need it to develop Adobe Flex applications
2008-09-03T19:28:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	sorry, don't know anything about that. It is a memory hog and runs like a bag of nails...
2008-09-03T19:28:00.000Z	aconrad	thesaint4444	after installing sun-java6-jre, eclipse doesn't seem to need gcj anymore... :)
2008-09-03T19:28:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	see what I mean.
2008-09-03T19:28:00.000Z	aconrad	thesaint4444	yeah, I see very well... :)
2008-09-03T19:29:00.000Z	aconrad		alternativly, I'll use it for my python development
2008-09-03T19:29:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	ok, I know a little about that. I use vim... :-)
2008-09-03T19:30:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	tried all the gui ide stuff and vim rocks...
2008-09-03T19:33:00.000Z	aconrad	thesaint4444	I'm a vim user as well, but I thought I'd give it a try with eclipse as I have to install it for Flex
2008-09-03T19:34:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	yeah, I think its the best of the ide's ...
2008-09-03T19:34:00.000Z	aconrad	thesaint4444	anyway, thanks for the tips
2008-09-03T19:35:00.000Z	aconrad		I'm now running eclipse with the official java fine from the repos
2008-09-03T19:36:00.000Z	thesaint4444	aconrad	cool, no probs, good luck!
