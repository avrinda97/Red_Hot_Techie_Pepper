2007-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	do you want something like:
2007-09-06T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	what happens when you double click as the user?
2007-09-06T05:50:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	nothing
2007-09-06T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	pastebin the script
2007-09-06T05:51:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	and pastebin the .desktop file for completion too
2007-09-06T05:52:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	ok! it can take some time
2007-09-06T06:00:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	http://pastebin.com/d7ab90b1f .desktop file and sh script
2007-09-06T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	/home/pc178/ess.sh has executable permissions set?
2007-09-06T06:03:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	yes
2007-09-06T06:03:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	i can execute the script itself on console with normal user
2007-09-06T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	change your script so that the last line redirects output to a file:    (cd /media/srveats02/Java/ESS/; filename=`ls ess* | grep jar | tail -n1`; java -Xmx1G -jar $filename) > /path/to/some/file 2>&1
2007-09-06T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	may want to check ~/.xsession-errors as well
2007-09-06T06:07:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	ok! I will change it...be back in a minute
2007-09-06T06:11:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	Hmm: it seems that by clicking as normal user on that .desktop file it can't find the java path
2007-09-06T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	what's the exact error?
2007-09-06T06:11:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	java not found
2007-09-06T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	how did you install java?
2007-09-06T06:13:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	installed that bin file cause I need original jre
2007-09-06T06:17:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	if i install java just as the bin, do i have to set the path somewehere else too, then only in the .bashrc's?
2007-09-06T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	I'd recommend using the packaged version since security updates are then taken care of for you.  But, yes, you would need to set the path in your GNOME environment in a file like ~/.xprofile or just use the full path to the java executable in your script
2007-09-06T06:19:00.000Z	__ele__	jrib	yea i will do install the packages...just wanted to know how to deal with bin files anyway:) thx for your help!!
2007-09-06T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	__ele__	np
