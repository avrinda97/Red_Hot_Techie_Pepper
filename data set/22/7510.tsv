2007-04-25T16:02:00.000Z	Scunizi		Can anyone tell me where the man pages are stored in the file system?
2007-04-25T16:03:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	see /etc/manpath.config
2007-04-25T16:03:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	you can also override it with $MANPATH
2007-04-25T16:03:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	anything in that will be added to the man paths in the config file
2007-10-01T11:41:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	try using ethtool
2007-10-01T11:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	is that a seperate prog. in synaptic? or a default prog.?
2007-10-01T11:42:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	i'm not sure, but i've got it installed so it's probably part of the base package set
2007-10-01T11:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	thanks .. actually commandline startup is ethtool.. commandline only? or is there a gui available?
2007-10-01T11:44:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	afaik it is command line only
2007-10-01T11:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	k.. thanks!
2007-10-01T11:44:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	i think you just need something like "ethool -s eth0 speed 100" though (look at the man pagE)
2007-10-01T11:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	looking a man now.. I appriciate it.
2007-10-01T11:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	am I right in thinking that if my Lan network & router are 100 that by reducing my one and only gigbit nic to 100 I should be able to help eliminate "data crashing" causing a slowdown of the internet connection?
2007-10-01T11:51:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	your nic should autonegotitate with the rest of the network
2007-10-01T11:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	it does, and is currently set that way, but I understand that it may autonegotiate with each send and receive.  If it always starts at 1000 then negotiates down to 100, that takes time..each time.  And although the time increment is small it can add up.
2007-10-01T11:53:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	although i believe ifconfig will tell you what speed the device is actually using
2007-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	i don't think that's how ethernet works, but i admit i'm not sure
2007-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	but ethernet is supposed to be a broadcast protocol so it would make sense to only negotitate the speed once per every time a new device connects
2007-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	except if the network (lan) was really busy it might do an "on the fly" negotiation
2007-10-01T11:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	interesting article on speeding up tcp/ip connections.. http://www.acc.umu.se/~maswan/linux-netperf.txt
2007-10-01T11:59:00.000Z	eck	Scunizi	yeah, i took a networking/sockets programming class about a year ago and learned all about that stuff, it's really pretty interesting
2007-10-01T12:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	eck	an actual education! :) wow!  I'm just a 47 yr old hack.. but I like this stuff.
