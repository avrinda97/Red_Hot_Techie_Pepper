2006-06-09T13:00:00.000Z	Schaver		how do I format a hard drive with ubuntu on it?
2006-06-09T13:01:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	where and what fs ?
2006-06-09T13:02:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	dapper and I don't know how you mean "where"
2006-06-09T13:02:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	if it's first ide master first partition   and the desired fs is ext3   do  sudo mke2fs -j /dev/hda1
2006-06-09T13:03:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	where as in location of the drive and which partition.     the fs i ask about is the desired fs.
2006-06-09T13:03:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	the command you recommended returned a message "/dev/hda1 is mounted; will not make a filesystem here!
2006-06-09T13:04:00.000Z	Schaver		the drive is on IDE1 and there's only 1 partition
2006-06-09T13:04:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	that's good.   seeing it was only an example....
2006-06-09T13:04:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	gotcha
2006-06-09T13:05:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	sorry about being so slow at this, thank you for dealing with me!
2006-06-09T13:05:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	ok.  then   you will have to use another os to do that.  if you format the partition with the system running on it the journel will most likely be corrupt anyway.
2006-06-09T13:06:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	boot a live cd or an install cd and format it with the example command
2006-06-09T13:06:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	gotcha, giving it a go now
2006-06-09T13:08:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	while you are about to mkfs anyway  could i sujest you repartition and make at least two partitions so you can, if need be, reload the system without loosing all your settings and documents/files you may gain/customize along the way.
2006-06-09T13:09:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	how big is this drive ?
2006-06-09T13:09:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	it's an 80gb drive; there wasn't anything on it except ubuntu.  I was just kind of messing with it as an experiment
2006-06-09T13:11:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	ok  why not make one 10g partition and one 70g   use the 10g for the system  and the 70g as /home   that way you can format and reinstall at any time and not loose settings
2006-06-09T13:11:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	ok, will do
2006-06-09T13:12:00.000Z	intelikey	Schaver	or even three partitions if you like.....   in linux  partitions are mounted as dirs    so one can be / (the root partition) and another /var  and another /usr and another /home and yet another /boot
2006-06-09T13:13:00.000Z	intelikey		again just examples ^
2006-06-09T13:13:00.000Z	Schaver	intelikey	I think I'll just keep it simple for the time being and stick with two; I've got it going now and it seems to be working great.  Thanks for all the help!!
