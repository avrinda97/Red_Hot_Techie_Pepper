2010-04-21T19:18:00.000Z	Chorupkata		whatup ?!
2010-04-21T19:18:00.000Z	Chorupkata		I wanted to ask .. how to optimize compiz?
2010-04-21T19:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Chorupkata	you don't need to optimise it, just use the correct/best supported graphics drivers
2010-04-21T19:18:00.000Z	Chorupkata		flash player for x64 ..sux!
2010-04-21T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Chorupkata	it is mixed results for different people
2010-04-21T19:19:00.000Z	Chorupkata	ikonia	my graphic driver is loaded.. and still some windows take too much time to get focus..
2010-04-21T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Chorupkata	what video card are you using ?
2010-04-21T19:19:00.000Z	Chorupkata		nvidia.
2010-04-21T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Chorupkata	and what model card
2010-04-21T19:21:00.000Z	Chorupkata	ikonia	sorry my card was .. ati my other laptop was nvidia..
2010-04-21T19:21:00.000Z	Chorupkata		It's a laptop card...
2010-04-21T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Chorupkata	the ati drivers are famously bad, as are the ati cards, you problem may be that simple
2010-04-21T19:22:00.000Z	Chorupkata	ikonia	changing my video card is not a option :)
2010-04-21T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Chorupkata	I appreciate that, but that is most probably the root of your issues (without more detailed investigation)
2010-04-21T19:23:00.000Z	Chorupkata	ikonia	may be... i try many options.. and settings to speed up ..
2010-04-21T19:23:00.000Z	Chorupkata		The main problem is when i try to call thunderbird .. .
2010-04-21T19:23:00.000Z	Chorupkata		I take 2/3 sec to focus the window.
2010-04-21T19:23:00.000Z	Chorupkata		And many other windows .. take to much time.. to focus.
2010-04-21T19:24:00.000Z	Chorupkata		In Animations Focus/etc are set to 50ms
2010-04-21T19:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Chorupkata	as I explaine it may just be a limiation of your card/driver combo
2010-04-21T19:25:00.000Z	Chorupkata	ikonia	may be.. just searching for some solution.. anyway..
2010-04-21T19:26:00.000Z	Chorupkata	ikonia	btw... I'm very happy with my ubuntu installation on my laptop and work just fine.. and i loved some of the effect of the compiz that's why it's still working :)
