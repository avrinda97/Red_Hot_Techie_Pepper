2010-01-31T12:05:00.000Z	venport		Anyone willing to give me a hand getting my new HD to auto mount on boot?
2010-01-31T12:05:00.000Z	venport		I've been editing my fstab but it's not mounting
2010-01-31T12:05:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	give us the fstab listing
2010-01-31T12:06:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	dude...  the one fstab line is all I asked for.
2010-01-31T12:10:00.000Z	venport	ascheel	oh crap i sure am thanks
2010-01-31T12:13:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	have you fixed fstab?  If so, try this and see if it works:  sudo mount -a
2010-01-31T12:15:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	df -h
2010-01-31T12:15:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	what does it say for / ?
2010-01-31T12:15:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	pastebin!
2010-01-31T12:17:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	fdisk -l
2010-01-31T12:20:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	so you have 2 drives.  sda and sdb.  sda is your 1 TB drive.
2010-01-31T12:20:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	add a new line to your fstab:  /dev/sda1   /media/MediaV1 ext3 default 0 0
2010-01-31T12:25:00.000Z	venport	ascheel	may i ask why /media and not /mnt? I know ubuntu addes all usb drives and cd\dvd to media, is that the reason?
2010-01-31T12:25:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	because it's a force of habit.  Mount it wherever you want.
2010-01-31T12:25:00.000Z	venport	ascheel	oh ok. i was just trying to understand.
2010-01-31T12:28:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	what did you format the drive with?
2010-01-31T12:28:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	what filesystem?
2010-01-31T12:30:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	I gave you bad advice.  Change 'default' to 'defaults' in /etc/fstab
2010-01-31T12:32:00.000Z	venport	ascheel	that seemed to work not to reboot and see if it holds. Thanks again.
2010-01-31T12:35:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	screw iTunes.  mp3 all the way.
2010-01-31T12:36:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	another solution is to use VirtualBox and run windows in that!
2010-01-31T12:36:00.000Z	ascheel	venport	touche.  I still recommend VirtualBox
