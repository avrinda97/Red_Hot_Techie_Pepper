2005-03-30T07:01:00.000Z	rvalles		it's simple stuff, I really don't get it
2005-03-30T07:01:00.000Z	rvalles		you people never use gcc at all?
2005-03-30T07:02:00.000Z	rvalles		I also tried reinstalling "gcc-3.4"
2005-03-30T07:02:00.000Z	rvalles		but no luck
2005-03-30T07:02:00.000Z	rvalles		it doesn't make "the wrapper" see it...
2005-03-30T07:03:00.000Z	farruinn	rvalles	gcc is going to depend on gcc-3.3 thus it's going to symlink /usr/bin/gcc to /usr/bin/gcc-3.3...
2005-03-30T07:04:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	:)
2005-03-30T07:05:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	/usr/bin/gcc doesn't exist
2005-03-30T07:05:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	as a link or as anything else; it just doesn't exist.
2005-03-30T07:09:00.000Z	farruinn	rvalles	you can make the symlink yourself
2005-03-30T07:10:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	it wont be useful
2005-03-30T07:12:00.000Z	farruinn	rvalles	why not?
2005-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	farruinn	rvalles	why don't you ssh to his system? ;)
2005-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	I'll do that, eventually
2005-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	but I want to avoid doing that.
2005-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	If I ssh and do everything... ;)
2005-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	the guy won't be able to do it himself ever.
2005-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	and I'll be working as an admin for him forever or till I grow tired
2005-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	I'm just trying to avoid that by not sshing into his box.
2005-03-30T07:25:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	my conclusion is that the different errors are probably linked to some sort of cache...
2005-03-30T07:25:00.000Z	rvalles	farruinn	which bash does internally have
2005-03-30T07:26:00.000Z	farruinn	rvalles	:)
