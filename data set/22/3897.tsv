2008-05-13T19:39:00.000Z	white_eagle		I get this message when I log in to my username: "Users $HOME/.drmc file's being ignored. This prevents the default session and language to be saved. File should be owned by user and not writable by others. User's $HOME directory must be owned by user and not writable by other users."
2008-05-13T19:40:00.000Z	white_eagle		What should I do so it won't appear???
2008-05-13T19:41:00.000Z	_adriaan	white_eagle	first of all, type "ls -l /home" in your terminal
2008-05-13T19:41:00.000Z	white_eagle	_adriaan	I have 3 folders there (3 users)
2008-05-13T19:42:00.000Z	white_eagle	_adriaan	I am the user 'whiteeagle'
2008-05-13T19:42:00.000Z	_adriaan	white_eagle	okay, the line should start with something like drwxr-xr-x
2008-05-13T19:43:00.000Z	_adriaan	white_eagle	what does it say for your folder?
2008-05-13T19:43:00.000Z	white_eagle	_adriaan	it starts with drwxrwxrwx
2008-05-13T19:43:00.000Z	_adriaan		okay
2008-05-13T19:43:00.000Z	_adriaan		type the command: sudo go-w /home/whiteeagle
2008-05-13T19:44:00.000Z	_adriaan	white_eagle	because you should be the only user with write access to your home directory
2008-05-13T19:44:00.000Z	white_eagle	_adriaan	I get sudo: go-w: command not found
2008-05-13T19:44:00.000Z	_adriaan		oh
2008-05-13T19:44:00.000Z	_adriaan		-_-
2008-05-13T19:44:00.000Z	_adriaan	white_eagle	sudo chmod go-w /home/whiteeagle
2008-05-13T19:44:00.000Z	_adriaan		sorry
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	white_eagle	_adriaan	should it be ok now?
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	white_eagle	_adriaan	or should I do something else
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	_adriaan	white_eagle	I would think so...
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	white_eagle	_adriaan	ok, I will restart the x server now
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	white_eagle		bye
2008-05-13T19:45:00.000Z	_adriaan	white_eagle	at least your permission are set up correctly now
