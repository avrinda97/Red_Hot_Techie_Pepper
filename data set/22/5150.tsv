2007-09-01T11:48:00.000Z	rafaelscj		where is located the dump file genereted by kismet?
2007-09-01T11:48:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	/var/log
2007-09-01T11:49:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	may you help me?
2007-09-01T11:50:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	kismet stops to garther after some minutes
2007-09-01T11:51:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	Could be a lot of different things. Perhaps there is lulls in the network traffic. What chipset are you using?
2007-09-01T11:52:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	ipw3945, intel pro/wireless
2007-09-01T11:53:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	It may be that your card does not go into or come out of monitor mode cleanly. I don't know if this is the case for you but it is very possible.
2007-09-01T11:54:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	does network-manager lock my card?
2007-09-01T11:56:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	I haven't had a problem with it. However, I haven't used your card though. You could try removing it to see if it helps
2007-09-01T11:57:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	try iwlist --scan in every 10 secs and see if it starts spitting out errors
2007-09-01T11:57:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	unknow command
2007-09-01T11:58:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	I would test the card to make sure it is not an issue with the driver basicaly. My bad, its iwlist scan
2007-09-01T11:59:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	No scan results at eth1
2007-09-01T12:00:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	That is not normal for a card that can go into monitor mode. Unless you know there are no wireless networks around you.
2007-09-01T12:01:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	there is some networks around me, two or three
2007-09-01T12:02:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	your card doesn't seem to do well with monitor mode then. Unless you know enough C to make a better driver you might need to get a different card to do what you want. Check the kismet page, they have lists of supported hardware.
2007-09-01T12:03:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	is there any option in /etc/kismet/kismet.conf that can fix it?
2007-09-01T12:03:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	okay
2007-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	may I set suiduser=root?
2007-09-01T12:09:00.000Z	clearzen	rafaelscj	DONT DO IT
2007-09-01T12:26:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	THANKS, I solved my problem
2007-09-01T12:27:00.000Z	rafaelscj	clearzen	I disabled network-manager
