2007-02-01T12:50:00.000Z	tovella	Cyrus25801	sorry, i'm playing with beta software, and there are some things that are different.  Had to figure out some of the differences.
2007-02-01T12:51:00.000Z	tovella	Cyrus25801	gnome comes with thing to set up keyboard shortcuts.  it should already be installed on your computer.
2007-02-01T12:51:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	tovella	what is it called
2007-02-01T12:52:00.000Z	tovella	Cyrus25801	don't know, but from the panel, you should find it under System > Preferences, or System > Administration.
2007-02-01T12:53:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	tovella	i already have played with that but cant seem to asign some keys
2007-02-01T12:54:00.000Z	tovella	Cyrus25801	 ...ah... wish i'd known that.
2007-02-01T12:54:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	tovella	sorry
2007-02-01T12:54:00.000Z	tovella	Cyrus25801	try hotkeys, then.
2007-02-01T13:01:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	tovella	i found another program keytouch. but when i try to install (i run this command:  sudo apt-get install keytouch) but it tells me the package couldn't be found. found link on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KeyTouch?highlight=%28keytouch%29
2007-02-01T13:03:00.000Z	tovella	Cyrus25801	what about the hotkeys program?
2007-02-01T13:04:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	tovella	with this program i can select the keyboard and install the keys auto. if i understand correctly
2007-02-01T13:05:00.000Z	tovella	Cyrus25801	use whichever you feel more comfortable with.
2007-02-01T13:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	tovella	will try this and if it doesn't work i will try hot keys. thank you very much for the help
