2011-06-15T07:02:00.000Z	edmin		hello is it okay if beginners come in here?
2011-06-15T07:03:00.000Z	edmin		thanks.  I'm creating a webserver with my daughter
2011-06-15T07:03:00.000Z	edmin		but the index.html file is in a folder that I do not have access to
2011-06-15T07:04:00.000Z	edmin		without chown or chmod it
2011-06-15T07:04:00.000Z	edmin		yes
2011-06-15T07:04:00.000Z	edmin		I'd like to take ownership of it but then revert it back so only root has access
2011-06-15T07:05:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	What server?
2011-06-15T07:05:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	I mean what webserver.
2011-06-15T07:07:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	Ok, so why not just point your apache2.conf to a directory you are able to edit with your user account?
2011-06-15T07:09:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	um,
2011-06-15T07:10:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	that will error on you if you run it like that.
2011-06-15T07:10:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	It won't.
2011-06-15T07:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	hold up a sec, we have to start you like almost all the way at the beginning I think.
2011-06-15T07:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	Ok, how's your understanding of linux in general? This your first time using it?
2011-06-15T07:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	It's quite ok. We all were there at some point.
2011-06-15T07:12:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	Right. So you have little to no understanding of what the commands you are issuing are doing. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's important to be aware of it.
2011-06-15T07:12:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	Ok, cool. So I imagine you ran something like "sudo apt-get install apache2" right?
2011-06-15T07:13:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	Ok.
2011-06-15T07:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	Now, you have a shiny new apache2 installation on your system. Your next step is to learn how to configure it. Right now the DocumentRoot is set to /var/www, but your user account most likely does not have access to that folder.
2011-06-15T07:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	So what I suggest doing is going to the Apache2 documentation website and reading up about configuring apache2 for ubuntu
2011-06-15T07:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	Probably better to just google "apache2 configuration ubuntu
2011-06-15T07:16:00.000Z	rationalOgre	edmin	put a / before the command
