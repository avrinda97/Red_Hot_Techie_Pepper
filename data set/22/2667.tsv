2009-09-24T08:21:00.000Z	wzssyqa		thie
2009-09-24T08:21:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	whats the path to the file you are attempting to edit?
2009-09-24T08:22:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	/boot/grub/grub.cfg
2009-09-24T08:22:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	first, i think you should ask in #ubuntu+1, unless you are running jaunty and grub2
2009-09-24T08:23:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	second, the file you edit is in /etc/default
2009-09-24T08:23:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	once you've edited that file, you then run sudo update-grub and it will write it to the grub.cfg
2009-09-24T08:24:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	t will try
2009-09-24T08:24:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	i think its /etc/default/grub.something... i don't have grub2 on this machine
2009-09-24T08:26:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	it seems that have a grub
2009-09-24T08:27:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	what?
2009-09-24T08:27:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	but in it ,there is no item for boot
2009-09-24T08:27:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	i am trying boot arch from ubuntu's grub2
2009-09-24T08:28:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	maybe you should ask in #arch
2009-09-24T08:28:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	or #archlinux
2009-09-24T08:29:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	but i am using the ubuntu's grub
2009-09-24T08:30:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	no you are simply using grub2, and trying to boot to arch,  most people here aren't yet familiar with grub2, but that link ubottu gave ou might help
2009-09-24T08:32:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	what does that mean?
2009-09-24T08:33:00.000Z	musikgoat	wzssyqa	because of grub2?
2009-09-24T08:33:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	i think i can do everything with vi on unix
2009-09-24T08:33:00.000Z	wzssyqa	musikgoat	but here,i can't
