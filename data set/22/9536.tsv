2005-12-02T06:29:00.000Z	Ratty_		ok
2005-12-02T06:29:00.000Z	Ratty_		now what
2005-12-02T06:30:00.000Z	Ratty_		i know
2005-12-02T06:30:00.000Z	Ratty_		it's already 12 hour format
2005-12-02T06:30:00.000Z	Ratty_		that's not my problem
2005-12-02T06:30:00.000Z	Ratty_		my problem is it's not showing am/pm on the end
2005-12-02T06:31:00.000Z	Ratty_		even though it's a 12 hour clock
2005-12-02T06:32:00.000Z	Ratty_		date +%r outputs: 1:32:24
2005-12-02T06:32:00.000Z	Ratty_		no am/pm
2005-12-02T06:33:00.000Z	Ratty_		so it's not gnome
2005-12-02T06:33:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	LC_TIME is the variable i guess
2005-12-02T06:34:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	i don't know. something that gives you the desired format :)
2005-12-02T06:35:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	type locale and it will print your whole environment
2005-12-02T06:36:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	shouldn't gb english have am/pm anyway?
2005-12-02T06:37:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	dunno, my LC_TIME is en_US.UTF-8 and i get a nice 24h date
2005-12-02T06:41:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	you can change any variable in a terminal: LC_ALL=fi_FI.UTF-8 date
2005-12-02T06:42:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	actually nothing seems to happen here :)
2005-12-02T06:43:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	actually smells a little like a bug
2005-12-02T06:47:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	easiest to set LANG=whatever in a terminal window. test with locale, or echo $LC_whatever
2005-12-02T06:49:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	someone wrote it, so it can be fixed too. :)
2005-12-02T06:50:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	i would file a bug. if it really _is_ a bug instead of a strange british feature
2005-12-02T06:53:00.000Z	topyli	Ratty_	oh, one variable in your locale won't ruin your identity =)
