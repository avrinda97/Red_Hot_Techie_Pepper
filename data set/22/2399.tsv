2009-08-06T00:26:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	I think you can only run one gdm so run a 2nd window manager instead
2009-08-06T00:29:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	I am an Ubuntu-newbie and so don't know how to do that. What I am trying to do is to run a game in fullscreen on one screen while having my usual desktop open on another screen, so I can switch back and forth between botht
2009-08-06T00:31:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	is you display adapter dual display capable, or are you using a laptop and external screen ?
2009-08-06T00:32:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	I am only using a tower with a motherboard with an nvidia-chipset (geForce 8300).
2009-08-06T00:33:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	no second display connected, if that was part of your question
2009-08-06T00:36:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	I thought you said a game on 1 screen and regular desktop on another ... is that not 2 screens ?
2009-08-06T00:36:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	I meant "two virtual screens"
2009-08-06T00:37:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	ahh ... so more than 1 desktop
2009-08-06T00:37:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	between which I can switch back and forth with ctrl+alt+fn
2009-08-06T00:37:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	well, yes
2009-08-06T00:38:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	yes, what I need (probably) are two desktops at the same time.
2009-08-06T00:39:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	will they be the same or different resolution ?
2009-08-06T00:39:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	They can be the same, no problem with that
2009-08-06T00:40:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	so just use gnome virtual desktops
2009-08-06T00:40:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	I will google for that, thank you
2009-08-06T00:41:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	do you have the workspace switcher icon on a panel anywhere ?
2009-08-06T00:41:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	if not, right click on a panel and select "add to panel" and choose "workspace switcher"
2009-08-06T00:41:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	yep, it is in the lower right corner
2009-08-06T00:42:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	ok, so there's probably 4 virtual desktops ... click on one of them and launch the game...
2009-08-06T00:43:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	thanks, I will try that
2009-08-06T00:51:00.000Z	Mrokii	joeyeye	sorry, but your solution doesn't work. If I run the game in fullscreen I can't switch between the workspaces. I guess I really need two virtual screens
2009-08-06T01:12:00.000Z	joeyeye	Mrokii	you still here ?
