2009-10-30T12:15:00.000Z	Zeero		Anyone think that I can  modify something in the /boot directory that will change my boot splash back to what it should be (IE: from Xubutu (how the heck did that get there!?) back to Ubuntu)
2009-10-30T12:15:00.000Z	Zeero		Because I just don't like that little rat guy.
2009-10-30T12:15:00.000Z	Zeero		Somehow he's there though.
2009-10-30T12:15:00.000Z	Zeero		Little bugger.
2009-10-30T12:16:00.000Z	Zeero		I didn't install him, though.
2009-10-30T12:16:00.000Z	Zeero		He's just...there.
2009-10-30T12:16:00.000Z	Zeero		I don't get the Ubuntu boot splash or login screen.
2009-10-30T12:16:00.000Z	Zeero		I have the Xubuntu one for some reason
2009-10-30T12:16:00.000Z	Zeero		I would very much like for it to go away, though...mostly because I'm not using Xubuntu.
2009-10-30T12:17:00.000Z	Zeero		Also, Admiral-Awesome: I was just going to suggest Arch to you.
2009-10-30T12:17:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	sudo apt-get purge xubuntu-artwork ... then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-artwork .. tada!
2009-10-30T12:18:00.000Z	Zeero	th3raid0r	Well I'll be a monkey's uncle...
2009-10-30T12:18:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	I think we were all a monkey's relative at some point in life, lol
2009-10-30T12:22:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	have you reinstalled ubuntu-artwork?
2009-10-30T12:23:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	okay, have you tried installing the package ubuntu-xsplash-artwork?
2009-10-30T12:26:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	you spelled it wrong ubuntu-xsplash-artwork
2009-10-30T12:27:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	Hmm... search it in synaptic instead of apt
2009-10-30T12:28:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	Od
2009-10-30T12:29:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	ah, it is okay, we all screw up sometimes... I rather often
2009-10-30T12:33:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	Gratz, now if you want to speed up your boot even more, edit the second line of your grub boot and add profile, you should see a performance increase not on that boot, but everyone thereafter (don't make that change permanent tho)
2009-10-30T12:36:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	when you boot, make the change there
2009-10-30T12:37:00.000Z	th3raid0r	Zeero	lol, nope
