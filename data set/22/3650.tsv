2008-08-07T00:53:00.000Z	hateball		It's not the operating system, it's the file system
2008-08-07T00:55:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	dianapo: vlc has codecs for most videos integrated. It does not install plugins that other media players can use.
2008-08-07T00:56:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	Yes, but not w32codecs if I'm not mistaken
2008-08-07T00:57:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	I thought w32codecs was just for mplayer ...
2008-08-07T00:59:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	Might be :D To be honest I havent modified my system for... long
2008-08-07T00:59:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	ah, no, it seems gstreamer can also use w32codecs.
2008-08-07T01:23:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	try renaming it to .asf. I think the mp3-extension may be confusing the media player.
2008-08-07T01:24:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	way ahead of you, and it doesnt matter ;)
2008-08-07T01:24:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	ok, worth a shot :)
2008-08-07T01:25:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	Tried it with mplayer?
2008-08-07T01:30:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	Yes, tried with a whole slew of players... on both 32 bit and 64. This must be some very special version of ASF
2008-08-07T01:31:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	I'm guessing it's corrupt.
2008-08-07T01:31:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	Well supposedly it played in Windows
2008-08-07T01:32:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	Hm. Maybe DRM?
2008-08-07T01:34:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	VLC output suggests it's some... wlam codec. Windows lossless bla bla. Quick google says it's introduced in WMP11 so probably too new for it to be supported in Linux
2008-08-07T01:36:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	Sounds like a reasonable assumption.
2008-08-07T01:38:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	Tried it in foobar2000 through Wine, and it cries at about WMA codecs so I suppose thats it. Someone created the file in an inferior format ;)
2012-07-05T15:59:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	actually grep -H -n will output filename and line
2012-07-05T16:00:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	With GNU grep, yes. -H is a GNU extension. I prefer to use portable code when possible.
2012-07-05T16:00:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	Well, it's what's included in Ubuntu ;p
2012-07-05T16:01:00.000Z	geirha	hateball	aye, doesn't hurt that it'll work on other unixes and unix-like systems though :)
2012-07-05T16:02:00.000Z	hateball	geirha	fair enough (I prefer grep -Hrn pattern Dir/) ;p
