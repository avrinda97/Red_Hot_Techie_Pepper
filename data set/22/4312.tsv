2008-07-31T06:14:00.000Z	histo		How can I reload ieee80211 kernel modules for my .19 kernel and my ipw2200 driver as well.
2008-07-31T06:15:00.000Z	histo		 Both got blown out and I have no internet under that kernel.
2008-07-31T06:15:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	That's for Xubuntu.
2008-07-31T06:36:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	You'll need to install the modules that you installed by yourself again under your new kernel
2008-07-31T06:37:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	I just want to rebuild those
2008-07-31T06:37:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	the default ones that come with ubuntu.
2008-07-31T06:38:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	You shouldn't really have a problem as the ones that COME with ubuntu are usually already in the kernel. I could be mistaken, but I don't think i am.
2008-07-31T06:38:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	No they are in /lib/modules/uname-r
2008-07-31T06:38:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	So recompile and see if anythign breaks :)
2008-07-31T06:38:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	They are.
2008-07-31T06:39:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	And they are there because they come compiled from the kernel
2008-07-31T06:39:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	I know that.
2008-07-31T06:39:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	How do I replace ones that are there with their original version
2008-07-31T06:40:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	You want to install OLD modules in a new kernel environment?
2008-07-31T06:40:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	I suppose you could download the source for the modules and compile them with flags for your current kernel. I guess.... I don't really know... I don't see why you'd want to really do that
2008-07-31T06:41:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	I think I found a way to do that.
2008-07-31T06:41:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	copy the .config from the headers then make modules and copy the modules over the old ones.
2008-07-31T06:46:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	I'm still not quite sure I understand what you're doing, but if it works, congrats on getting it to work
2008-07-31T06:50:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	I was trying to user a different kernel module for my network card.  Well the new one I installed was messed up. So it borked my card under that kernel.  I was looking for a way to rever to the old module and think I found it.
2008-07-31T06:51:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	Hm. I see. Just so you know, if I understand correct what you're doing right now, you're compiling a  new kernel with your cuyrrent running .config file, right?
2008-07-31T07:01:00.000Z	histo	rpj8	Nah i'm compiling the modules to the normal .19 config
2008-07-31T07:02:00.000Z	rpj8	histo	Heh, I'm not sure you know what you're doing, because the .config file is only the settings for compiling your kernel
