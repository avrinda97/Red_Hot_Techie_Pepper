2011-06-26T00:23:00.000Z	MrUnagi		how do i open port 143 in ubuntu
2011-06-26T00:23:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	for what specific reason?
2011-06-26T00:25:00.000Z	MrUnagi	Kuehlschrank	to serve imap
2011-06-26T00:26:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	Have you enabled any firewalls?
2011-06-26T00:26:00.000Z	MrUnagi		iptables

2011-06-26T00:28:00.000Z	MrUnagi		i followed that exact guide and the thing still wont open
2011-06-26T00:28:00.000Z	MrUnagi		not to mention i also get -bash: /etc/init.d/iptables: No such file or directory
2011-06-26T00:31:00.000Z	MrUnagi		i give up
2011-06-26T00:31:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	Does it work with iptables disabled?
2011-06-26T00:32:00.000Z	MrUnagi		how do you disable iptables
2011-06-26T00:34:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	wait...you told me that there is no /etc/init.d/iptables ?
2011-06-26T00:34:00.000Z	MrUnagi		correct
2011-06-26T00:34:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	But you are sure that you have iptables enabled?
2011-06-26T00:35:00.000Z	MrUnagi		i am sure enough that when i add to the chain iptables -L lists the added rule
2011-06-26T00:36:00.000Z	MrUnagi		i think im good now
2011-06-26T00:36:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	What happens if you do nc <yourimapserver> 143 ?
2011-06-26T00:37:00.000Z	MrUnagi	Kuehlschrank	it appears to be working now
2011-06-26T00:38:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	Ok..
2011-06-26T00:38:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	I guess iptables needed a restart to accept the new rules...
2011-06-26T00:39:00.000Z	MrUnagi		i think it was a bad dovecot setting
2011-06-26T00:40:00.000Z	Kuehlschrank	MrUnagi	ok
