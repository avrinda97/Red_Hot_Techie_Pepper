2007-04-05T09:00:00.000Z	Andeh		As you can see in my paste, VLC and all the other ones ARE there.
2007-04-05T09:00:00.000Z	Andeh		Firefox just doesnt use them properly
2007-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	Andeh		So, basically, what can i do to make it easier for you to help me?
2007-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	Andeh		I KNOW those plugins can play it and i KNOW because i tried them externally AND because they show up in ABOUT:PLUGINS but they just dont work!
2007-04-05T09:03:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	which plugin is firefox actually loading to play the video that fails?
2007-04-05T09:04:00.000Z	Andeh	jrib	That's what i am trying to find out.
2007-04-05T09:04:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	right click on it, all of the plugins ahve their own unique menu
2007-04-05T09:05:00.000Z	Andeh	jrib	I think firefox itself outputs the NO VIDEO message because when i deleted everything except VLC in the plugins folder, it still said no video.
2007-04-05T09:05:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	no, when you play a video
2007-04-05T09:06:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	http://www.linspire.com/products_linspire_whatis.php?tab=compatibility  do the embedded videos work on this page?
2007-04-05T09:07:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	scroll down
2007-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	get rid of vlc.  Does totem work?
2007-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	Andeh	jrib	No, i want to keep it. I installed it because i had this problem the first time i tried playing a video.
2007-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	we are troubleshooting
2007-04-05T09:17:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	both work
2007-04-05T09:18:00.000Z	Andeh	jrib	they should.
2007-04-05T09:21:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	do what I said
2007-04-05T09:22:00.000Z	Andeh	jrib	I really have the feeling something DID explode in your face today...
2007-04-05T09:22:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	?
2007-04-05T09:23:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	or get rid of totem and troubleshoot vlc.  Either way, we don't even know what plugin you are using
2007-04-05T09:27:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	show us a screenshot of what firefox does on one of the linspire videos
2007-04-16T11:33:00.000Z	jrib	Andeh	/etc/apache2/apache2.conf  if you are using apach2
