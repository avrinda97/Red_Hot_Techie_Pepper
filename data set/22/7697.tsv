2006-08-17T07:36:00.000Z	phiber_optic		im trying to install ubuntu im on the partitions part
2006-08-17T07:36:00.000Z	phiber_optic		but I need some help
2006-08-17T07:36:00.000Z	phiber_optic		becase I have 2 unallocated partitions
2006-08-17T07:38:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	how big are they?
2006-08-17T07:39:00.000Z	phiber_optic	hav0k	my sizes are 486 mb and 10.2 gig
2006-08-17T07:40:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	do you have windows on your computer already?
2006-08-17T07:40:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	or some other os?
2006-08-17T07:40:00.000Z	phiber_optic	hav0k	yes
2006-08-17T07:40:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	did you defrag the hardrive before you started to install ubuntu?
2006-08-17T07:41:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	oh, i see
2006-08-17T07:41:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	well, that seems kinda strange to me that you have two sections...
2006-08-17T07:42:00.000Z	phiber_optic	hav0k	another question why is the xchat gnome so different from the other one
2006-08-17T07:43:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	i would go with the most continuous space if i were in your shoes
2006-08-17T07:43:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	and i dont know... i messed up my xchat-gnome so im back to regular xchat
2006-08-17T07:43:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	i dont know what i did, but it just wouldnt work
2006-08-17T07:44:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	back where?
2006-08-17T07:46:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	me too
2006-08-17T07:47:00.000Z	phiber_optic	hav0k	after that how can I check my partitions
2006-08-17T07:47:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	how do you mean check them?
2006-08-17T07:49:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	probably the username for ubuntu
2006-08-17T07:52:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	 you automatically start a user account when you install
2006-08-17T07:52:00.000Z	hav0k	phiber_optic	atleast it made me make one when i installed
