2007-12-21T23:29:00.000Z	giggsey		Is there a way I can force an ntfs partition to be mounted?
2007-12-21T23:29:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	if you put it into fstab with specific params, you can.
2007-12-21T23:30:00.000Z	giggsey	brobostigon	what would the fstab line be for an ntfs partition?
2007-12-21T23:30:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	look in man fstab
2007-12-21T23:30:00.000Z	giggsey		Thanks
2007-12-21T23:31:00.000Z	brobostigon		i cant remember
2007-12-21T23:32:00.000Z	brobostigon		!fstab | giggsey
2007-12-21T23:32:00.000Z	giggsey		sexeh :D
2007-12-21T23:35:00.000Z	giggsey	brobostigon	I've added it in there, tried to mount it now, and it's giving me NTFS is either inconsistent - Can I _force_ it to mount?
2007-12-21T23:36:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	what precisly is the error message, very importent??
2007-12-21T23:37:00.000Z	giggsey	brobostigon	I know why it's saying the errors. It's because I have bad sectors on the partition, and I know I do. I want to get to the data regardless
2007-12-21T23:37:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	try fsck on it first, to try and get rid of the errors on the hdd.
2007-12-21T23:38:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	if it still wont mount its then to damaged to read off.
2007-12-21T23:41:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	if it wont mount evenafter an fs check, then its to dameged to mount,
2007-12-21T23:42:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	if it wont mount evenafter an fs check, then its to dameged to mount
2007-12-21T23:42:00.000Z	giggsey	brobostigon	I was using vista on it this morning, I knew it had a bad sector. Run the windows disk check, tried again, and it had bad sectors still. Resized it regardlessly, installed ubuntu. Am now trying to get my files
2007-12-21T23:44:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	if it wont mount, however much you want to get your files, if its dameged enough, it wont mount and cant get files off it, unless you send it t pro hdd recovery.
2007-12-21T23:45:00.000Z	giggsey	brobostigon	I have faith, I'll get them off :)
2007-12-21T23:45:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	if its damaged enough no mount, and cant get files off,
2007-12-21T23:46:00.000Z	giggsey	brobostigon	Well, when I was using gparted, it was saying I have one bad sector.
2007-12-21T23:46:00.000Z	brobostigon	giggsey	try fsck it, to test and repair it, man fsck.
2007-12-21T23:47:00.000Z	giggsey	brobostigon	Okay, currently running testdisk on it, then I'll do fsck
