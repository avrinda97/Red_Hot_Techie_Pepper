2008-02-18T02:13:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	the ubuntu drivers don't have the latest support for the 8800gt , you'll need the one from nvidia.com. Or wait for hardy
2008-02-27T09:08:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	your question isn't very clear, at all.
2008-02-27T09:09:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	its all i know
2008-02-27T09:09:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	ok.   what happens when you type    sudo dpkg -f install   in a terminal?
2008-02-27T09:10:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	dpkg-deb: failed to read archive `install': No such file or directory
2008-02-27T09:10:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	that's not what I said to type:     sudo apt-get -f install  , just that, on one line
2008-02-27T09:12:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	um it is what u said but one sec
2008-02-27T09:12:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	it says segmentation fault (core dumped)
2008-02-27T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	very strange.  put the complete output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-02-27T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	I need the url
2008-02-27T09:14:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	i guess its this, rather newbish http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57552/
2008-02-27T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	wow. You have a serious problem, way over my head. I'm decent with using apt, but what would go on internally to cause a segmentation fault ...
2008-02-27T09:16:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	i dunno like, idk why either, cause i havent really messed with anything either
2008-02-27T09:16:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	it just kinda popped up today, was fine other day
2008-02-27T09:18:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	any ideas on maybe where i could go then?
2008-02-27T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	here. Some of the developers pass through regularly, try saying ' apt-get -f  install results in a segmentation fault. I really need some help with this." every 15 minutes or so
2008-02-27T09:20:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	thanks
2008-02-27T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	your screen turning red, saying some memory is bad. My machine froze with bad memory, but I can imagine getting segfaults instead
2008-02-27T09:28:00.000Z	weeman13221	nickrud	hmm that would suck cause it seems fine otherwise so ok ill brb
2008-02-27T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	weeman13221	you'll need to let it run for a couple hours to be sure
