2005-06-23T10:29:00.000Z	Codeman7		I have Ubuntu on my laptop. Maybe 1-2 times per minute, it just freezes for a second (the entire X interface) and then comes back.
2005-06-23T10:31:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	me too
2005-06-23T10:31:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	but more like 5 mins
2005-06-23T10:33:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	any solutions?
2005-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	not as yet:  messages like ide2 wait for ready failed before probe!
2005-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	where are you seeing these?
2005-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	possibly ide2=0x1F0 in grub
2005-06-23T10:34:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	/var/log/syslog just b4 hang
2005-06-23T10:35:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	hang only recoverable with Ctrl-Alt-Prtscrn-S-U-B = you too?
2005-06-23T10:35:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	no... not sure that is the right error
2005-06-23T10:35:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	sometimes freeze recovers but top says all is well
2005-06-23T10:36:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	see, mine just freezes for a second or two and always returns
2005-06-23T10:37:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	it's probably something simple
2005-06-23T10:37:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	like HD sleeping or video card or something
2005-06-23T10:38:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	laptop by any chance?
2005-06-23T10:39:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	I have this weird feeling it has something to do with power management] 
2005-06-23T10:40:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	I tried apic off... and apm not supported on my laptop
2005-06-23T10:40:00.000Z	Codeman7	gpd	hmmm.
2005-06-23T10:45:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	what is your plan for fix?
2005-06-23T10:55:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	s/name.o/name/
2005-06-23T10:59:00.000Z	gpd	Codeman7	are you doing 27 things at one or something?
