2008-11-12T10:04:00.000Z	[T]ank1		i am trying to make a usb start disk. using the option in system>administration>create a usb start disk
2008-11-12T10:04:00.000Z	[T]ank1		it seems to build it ok
2008-11-12T10:05:00.000Z	[T]ank1		but cannot boot to it.
2008-11-12T10:05:00.000Z	[T]ank1		have verified that bios is set correctly
2008-11-12T10:05:00.000Z	[T]ank1		even tried marking it bootable with fdisk
2008-11-12T10:05:00.000Z	[T]ank1		could anyone point me in the direction to get this working?
2008-11-12T10:06:00.000Z	EJ	[T]ank1	have you tried plugging the stick into different USB ports ?
2008-11-12T10:07:00.000Z	EJ	[T]ank1	if your bios is set correctly and the USB Boot Stick was created correctly then it should be working
2008-11-12T10:07:00.000Z	[T]ank1	EJ	I will try that.
2008-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	EJ	[T]ank1	sometimes the ports on the backside of the system are on different  ..... circuts than the font USB Ports (sry cant think of a different word other than circuts atm)
2008-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	[T]ank1		i only have 2 on the side of my laptop.
2008-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	EJ	[T]ank1	oh i didnt realize you were using a laptop, i was invisioning a desktop
2008-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	[T]ank1		so do you think that would still be the issue?
2008-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	EJ	[T]ank1	no, but when you set up your bios did you make USB the 1st on the boot list ?
2008-11-12T10:11:00.000Z	[T]ank1		yes... I have also tried an option to boot to a temporary device and pointed it to my usb drive, which it lists by name "sandisk cruizer 2.0 gb"
2008-11-12T10:11:00.000Z	[T]ank1		or something close to that
2008-11-12T10:11:00.000Z	EJ	[T]ank1	how did you make the boot stick ? by the guide on the web site ?
2008-11-12T10:12:00.000Z	[T]ank1	EJ	just used the tool in the menu
2008-11-12T10:12:00.000Z	[T]ank1	EJ	brb
