2007-05-26T10:22:00.000Z	dennister		anyone else have any idea as to how to fix flash sound?
2007-05-26T10:23:00.000Z	dennister		it used to work for me when feisty was a new install :(
2007-05-26T10:23:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	hello... what's your flash version?
2007-05-26T10:26:00.000Z	dennister	matheus	yes...9.0.31.0 v of flash
2007-05-26T10:27:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	I think flash use oss driver
2007-05-26T10:27:00.000Z	dennister	matheus	well i tried changing my sound preferences to oss as well...nada
2007-05-26T10:28:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	look at /dev dir and search for dsp
2007-05-26T10:29:00.000Z	dennister	matheus	found dsp...it the default for every sound-related app in my system, which all work
2007-05-26T10:31:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	in flash, by right-click..... setting, what you see about sound?
2007-05-26T10:33:00.000Z	dennister	matheus	it doesn have any setting for sound
2007-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	do you tried to make alsa driver as default?
2007-05-26T10:36:00.000Z	dennister	matheus	i believe my probs with flash sound actually started when i was trying to get surround sound working with also...did manage to get the centre and lfe speakers going...
2007-05-26T10:36:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	I using flash 7 yet... This version uses oss driver
2007-05-26T10:37:00.000Z	dennister	matheus	well i have feisty, so v 9 is what available, and like I said, I sure flash sound worked when feisty was still a new clean install
2007-05-26T10:37:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	hold on, I will install the flash 9 to see
2007-05-26T10:39:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	Im downloading it
2007-05-26T10:40:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	Flash 9 is working with alsa driver
2007-05-26T10:46:00.000Z	dennister	matheus	ok, so Ie now changed all my sound preferences to alsa, but am still getting nowhere on youtube videos
2007-05-26T10:49:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	in fact, you do not need to change default setting to work with oss or alsa driver
2007-05-26T10:49:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	default setting affect only gnome applications, like totem ...
2007-05-26T10:59:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	hello! works? with new user?
2007-05-26T11:08:00.000Z	matheus	dennister	are you here?
