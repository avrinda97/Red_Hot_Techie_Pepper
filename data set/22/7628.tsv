2006-08-17T09:31:00.000Z	carthik		Hi, I have "headless" desktop at home which I want to connect to and see the desktop of using another system at home. How can I do this?
2006-08-17T09:32:00.000Z	carthik		is there a documentation page I can read and follow to set things up real quick? thanks.
2006-08-17T09:32:00.000Z	farous	carthik	remote login oe ssh are both poss
2006-08-17T09:33:00.000Z	carthik	farous	thank you - would you know if there is a guide that will guide me through  the process?
2006-08-17T09:34:00.000Z	farous	carthik	you have to have static ip for it to work
2006-08-17T09:34:00.000Z	carthik	farous	oh I see. uhm okay. How would it work with that (And do I still need a static IP if both PCs are at home)?
2006-08-17T09:35:00.000Z	farous	carthik	if you have lan and static ip through your router there is no prob
2006-08-17T09:36:00.000Z	farous	carthik	for ssh it is simplyt ssh -X username@homeipaddress, and you have graphical interface too
2006-08-17T09:36:00.000Z	carthik	farous	ah, ok. I can set a static IP for that system, within the LAN. Now the question is - which is the best way to set things up? the XDCMP/Rdesktop/ VNC/tightvnc/vnc-over-ssh/FreeNX options really confuse me. I want something that is "Free" and easy to setup and maintain.
2006-08-17T09:37:00.000Z	farous	carthik	ssh was the first thing i tested and did not need to inves further
2006-08-17T09:37:00.000Z	carthik	farous	do I get to login to the remote desktop and see the actual desktop and have a session with ssh -X ? I thought that was "x forwarding" for particular single apps
2006-08-17T09:37:00.000Z	farous	carthik	yah you for x for each appl you use
2006-08-17T09:39:00.000Z	carthik	farous	what is it that the "applications->internet->terminal server client" uses? Or anything that is available by default in any Ubuntu desktop? (So I will have better luck guiding my girlfriend and dad later)?
2006-08-17T09:40:00.000Z	farous	carthik	sorry for the slow repl lost my a letter on this laptop. dam this lenovo takeover
2006-08-17T09:40:00.000Z	farous	carthik	am not heavy gui user so will not know
2006-08-17T09:41:00.000Z	carthik	farous	I appreciate your help, and may Lenovo see better days! :)
2006-08-17T09:43:00.000Z	farous	carthik	if it is for your dad do you use the desktop as server ?
2006-08-17T09:44:00.000Z	carthik	farous	yes, I _think_ I found the answer, finally. The "VNC" "VNCoverSSH" pages at the wiki are helpful, or seem so, at least.
2006-08-17T09:44:00.000Z	farous	carthik	did you consider sshfs
2006-08-17T09:45:00.000Z	carthik	farous	i have an all but dead PII that I can use to connect to an AMD64 PC - hence my interest
2006-08-17T09:45:00.000Z	farous	carthik	ok
2006-08-17T09:46:00.000Z	carthik	farous	no, I need him to be able to browse, use the computer normally, but a PII is too slow - so I want to use it only to "display" the desktop from another more powerful machine.
