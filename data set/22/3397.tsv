2011-07-14T09:47:00.000Z	crackerjackz		"update manager" is frozen.. what is the name of that process so that i can kill it?
2011-07-14T09:47:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	lookup pid in htop
2011-07-14T09:48:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	pidof htop returns nothing
2011-07-14T09:49:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	or sudo killall update-manager; htop would list your running processes
2011-07-14T09:49:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	is htop a GUI of top or something?
2011-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	thanks
2011-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	if you killed it, run : sudo dpkg --configure -a
2011-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	okay, and what does that do?
2011-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	checks for dpkg state, as you interupted in unkwon state for now
2011-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	i see, you have any idea why it froze? looks like a kernel update and things to do with the new kernel
2011-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	no, you could check the logs though, mostly something wrong with network
2011-07-14T09:54:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	that makes sense actually im not sure why but my net keeps flaking out.. took me like 15 minutes to download xchat but it fluctuates.. i think its my router
2011-07-14T09:55:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	maybe slow repo ? can use synaptic to find the fastest one for you
2011-07-14T09:56:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	how do i go about that.. once i have synaptic open
2011-07-14T09:57:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	settings > repos > download from > other > find...
2011-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	i see it thanks :]
2011-07-14T11:33:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	synaptics still open in parallel ?
2011-07-14T11:33:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	i guess, what does that mean? nope software center isnt open
2011-07-14T11:33:00.000Z	crackerjackz	DasEi	what is the name of the process for software center?
2011-07-14T11:38:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	same as half an hour ago, plus removing apt-lock (I guess your synaptic was still open from repo-change)
2011-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	 : no, see ActionP, problem was more than one apt/dpkg process at one time
2011-07-14T11:45:00.000Z	DasEi	crackerjackz	np
