2008-06-22T22:52:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		I just installed using Wubi a week or two ago...I'm getting to the point where I want to try installing windows programs (using Wine) to see if I want to replace Windows entirely...I need more space though
2008-06-22T22:53:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		I followed the instructions here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#head-5aac3daad4eb9fcc3502ba1a4d6891b71b050b1d
2008-06-22T22:53:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		how do I access the new one?
2008-06-22T22:54:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		I installed using Wubi, and created a new virtual disk using these instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#head-5aac3daad4eb9fcc3502ba1a4d6891b71b050b1d - how do I access the new virtual disk?
2008-06-22T22:56:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		so does anyone know how to access a newly created virtual disk made for a Wubi-installed Ubuntu?
2008-06-22T22:58:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		ugh, okay
2008-06-22T22:58:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		though, BTW...as a tool for introducing people to Linux who are hesitant to try it...Wubi is very nice
2008-06-22T22:58:00.000Z	fritzophrenic		could use better support though :-p
2008-06-22T22:59:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	from where you want to access the ubuntu drive?
2008-06-22T23:02:00.000Z	fritzophrenic	apophis	from inside Ubuntu...I want to set up Wine to use the newly created virtual drive as it's C: drive
2008-06-22T23:03:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	I am not sure what you want. But from ubuntu the whole root ( / ) is THIS drive
2008-06-22T23:05:00.000Z	fritzophrenic	apophis	so / is a combination of what I had originally (root.disk, set up by Wubi) and the win.disk that I created?
2008-06-22T23:05:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	you have created a win disk? how?
2008-06-22T23:06:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	you probably mean the drive  ~/.wine/drive_c/ ... yes this is part of your ubuntu drive
2008-06-22T23:06:00.000Z	fritzophrenic	apophis	It's just a virtual disk, apparently usable by Ubuntu...I created a file of the desired size and formatted it to ext3 using these instrunctions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#head-5aac3daad4eb9fcc3502ba1a4d6891b71b050b1d
2008-06-22T23:08:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	I see now... yes this drive should also be mounted at /host/ubuntu/disks
2008-06-22T23:08:00.000Z	fritzophrenic	apophis	so I need to mount it you're saying? How do I do that?
2008-06-22T23:09:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	I hope it already is: try to go to /host/ubuntu/disks and look if there are subdirectories, these should be your virtual disks mounted
2008-06-22T23:10:00.000Z	fritzophrenic	apophis	/host/ubuntu/disks just has the 3 .disk files in it :-(
2008-06-22T23:12:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	I dont understand why its not mentioned where the additional space gets mounted... a gap in the manual. try: locate extra.disk
2008-06-22T23:13:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	, isnt it somewhere on the desktop? normally ubuntu shows auto-mounted drives directly on the desktop
2008-06-22T23:15:00.000Z	apophis	fritzophrenic	yes maybe... lets try mounting it then: sudo mount -a
