2009-01-12T09:00:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with Ubuntu yet.  Seems kind of a waste just to use it the same way I'd use XP
2009-01-12T09:01:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		the only thing I need XP for is for Yahoo literati.  I can't get it to run reliably in Ubuntu
2009-01-12T09:02:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		stupid Java
2009-01-12T09:02:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		it's like scrabble.  I play with my ex-girlfriend/fiancee
2009-01-12T09:03:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		yes
2009-01-12T09:03:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		Anyway, sometimes it will load but soon after, it makes FF do a force quit
2009-01-12T09:03:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		so, I have to switch over to XP just to play her
2009-01-12T09:04:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		really annoying
2009-01-12T09:04:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		yep, Intrepid
2009-01-12T09:05:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		I even tried installing openJDK with no love
2009-01-12T09:05:00.000Z	mib_7fb92a	TheFunkbomb	u try icedtea?
2009-01-12T09:06:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	mib_7fb92a	yes, I tried icedtea as well.  No joy there either
2009-01-12T09:07:00.000Z	mib_7fb92a	TheFunkbomb	i hate java.  its even worse in fedora & suse.  but -- icedteam usually works for me

2009-01-12T09:11:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	mib_7fb92a	I'm going to look for other java based games and see what happens
2009-01-12T09:14:00.000Z	mib_7fb92a	TheFunkbomb	cool.  then its the game...   my test is always: go to NYTimes site and try loading the classic crossword puzzl
