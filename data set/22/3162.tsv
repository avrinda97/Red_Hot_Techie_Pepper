2009-09-12T23:04:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	youre having problems with resolution?
2009-09-12T23:04:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	yes
2009-09-12T23:05:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	first try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-09-12T23:07:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	I've already done this process
2009-09-12T23:08:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	first you need to google the specs on your monitor, you want to find out horizontal and vertical refresh rates and the recommend refresh rate on your monitor
2009-09-12T23:08:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	hmm
2009-09-12T23:09:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	afterwards youre going to edit your xorg.conf, make sure you make it up before you do anything, backup your xorg.conf in /etc/X11
2009-09-12T23:09:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	meant to say make sure you back up your xorg.conf
2009-09-12T23:11:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	That would be good
2009-09-12T23:12:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	you know what, type "xrandr" and let us know what resolutions linux says youre capable
2009-09-12T23:15:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	http://pastebin.com/d272be983 this is my monitor specs
2009-09-12T23:26:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	can you help
2009-09-12T23:32:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	i did ask lol. you were half way through explaining, about the resolution problem
2009-09-12T23:33:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	you still havent told me the output of xrandr
2009-09-12T23:36:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	http://pastebin.com/d3747ac88
2009-09-12T23:37:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	find out your horizontal and vertical refresh rates and the recommend refresh rate for your monitor but first backup your xorg.conf in /etc/X11
2009-09-12T23:40:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	I have backed up my xorg.cong and http://pastebin.com/d272be983 this is my monitor specs
2009-09-12T23:42:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	youre going to edit your xorg.conf and create a section called "Monitor"
2009-09-12T23:45:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	Okay monitor created
2009-09-12T23:46:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	using the specs from your monitor youre going to create a "Modeline" using gtf,  here is an example using my monitor, you have to supply your own specs to configure xorg.conf for your monitor: http://pastebin.com/m48d5dad5
2009-09-13T00:02:00.000Z	Cluber	mezquitale	How do i find Synchronization Range - Vertical for http://www.svp.co.uk/electrical/av-home-cinema/samsung-32inch-le32b530-lcd-tv_samsmun-01001.html
2009-09-13T00:04:00.000Z	mezquitale	Cluber	now youre asking the correct question unfortunately I dont have the answer to that one and after you find the answer youre going to do the same thing I did
