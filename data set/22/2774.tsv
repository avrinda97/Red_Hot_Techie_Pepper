2009-03-21T19:22:00.000Z	bazhang	PerryArmstrong	check the md5, do the disk integrity check after burning iso at very low speed
2009-03-21T19:23:00.000Z	bazhang	PerryArmstrong	could be a bad burn or a corrupt iso
2009-03-21T19:25:00.000Z	bazhang	PerryArmstrong	if none of those work, then you may wish to try some different bootoptions
