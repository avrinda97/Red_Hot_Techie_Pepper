2005-06-23T10:20:00.000Z	kent	Praisem247	 it should be in your home.   Open up a terminal do "cat .bash_history"  (if the file exists..)
2005-06-23T10:21:00.000Z	Praisem247		ls
2005-06-23T10:21:00.000Z	kent	Praisem247	you can try to just open your Home-folder with the filebrowser and select to view hidden files (i think by right-clicking on the folder.. but im unsure, sitting in windows right now)
2005-06-23T10:21:00.000Z	kent	Praisem247	if you do "ls" in the home, the file wont show since it starts with an "." and there for is hidden. "ls -al" will show the hidden files aswell
