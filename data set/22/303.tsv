2012-01-14T23:52:00.000Z	nivyaj		I'm a noob to linux- can someone help me with a stupid question?
2012-01-14T23:53:00.000Z	nivyaj		I have a software with a windows OR mac option to download. Will  either run on my ubuntu? and why?
2012-01-14T23:54:00.000Z	nivyaj		Can someone explain to me Why the stuff wont run on linux?
2012-01-14T23:54:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	uh, because they're different operating systems. things are not interchangeable.
2012-01-14T23:55:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	everything...
2012-01-14T23:55:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	the very binary format isn't compatible.
2012-01-14T23:55:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
2012-01-14T23:55:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	now- these are the type of answers that are helpful!
2012-01-14T23:56:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	can you epand?
2012-01-14T23:56:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	an operating system provides abstractions for its programs. the abstractions that Windows provides are (very) different to the ones Linux provides.
2012-01-14T23:59:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	so if i have a program foobar with a version for mac, windows, and linux- how would they differ?
2012-01-14T23:59:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	really that's a very hard question. they differ in everything. i don't know how to explain it better than i have. anyway join #ubuntu-offtopic
2012-01-15T00:00:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	thanks :)
2012-01-26T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	/usr/local is an exception though. but it's also valid to keep it in your home.
2012-01-26T19:38:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	home is where it lists the user on my computer. That's cool?
2012-01-26T19:38:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	i mean the directory /home/yourusername (which can be shortened to ~/). you might want to make a "bin" directory inside it, but that's not strictly necessary.
2012-01-26T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	but if you want other users to be able to use the program too, then /usr/local it is (like /usr/local/bin)
2012-01-26T19:40:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	got it.
2012-01-26T19:42:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	can you remind me again- why shouldn't i touch the usr directory (save this excep0tion?)
2012-01-26T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	because it's handled by the package manager
2012-01-26T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	nivyaj	you don't want to interfere with it
2012-01-26T19:48:00.000Z	nivyaj	LjL	ahh, that's good stuff right there.
