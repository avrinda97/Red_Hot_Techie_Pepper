2012-01-29T16:04:00.000Z	greenit		plz help :S    i use the youtube-lens for unity, but when i click a video, it opens vlc and vlc says that it can't open the video
2012-01-29T16:06:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	Figures if it isn't in the Official repository we can't do much helpwise.
2012-01-29T16:06:00.000Z	greenit	aBound	i think it's a problem of vlc, and this is in the official repos
2012-01-29T16:07:00.000Z	aBound		I'm referring to youtube-lenses.
2012-01-29T16:07:00.000Z	aBound		:P
2012-01-29T16:07:00.000Z	greenit	aBound	true, but i tried to open a youtube-video with vlc without the lens and it displays the same error
2012-01-29T16:07:00.000Z	aBound		Seeing as Youtube-Lenses has to be fetched from a unofficial PPA.
2012-01-29T16:08:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	Any form of VLC plugin installed to view the videos?
2012-01-29T16:08:00.000Z	greenit	aBound	nope, i just installed vlc... do i have to install a plugin?
2012-01-29T16:09:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	I can't say but if it's loading VLC as it's default player. Figures, it'll need a VLC plugin for Firefox.
2012-01-29T16:10:00.000Z	aBound		I don't use youtube-lenses I can't comment much on that aspect. But if you'd like to try you can install the Mozilla plugin for VLC in the Software Center.
2012-01-29T16:10:00.000Z	greenit	aBound	i enter the url in the "open network-stream..." dialogue of vlc, then it says that it can't determine the format of the video...
2012-01-29T16:11:00.000Z	greenit	aBound	so it doesn't open when i just click on a youtube-video in firefo
2012-01-29T16:11:00.000Z	greenit		x
2012-01-29T16:12:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	I don't think the youtube URL is meant for the "Open Network Stream".
2012-01-29T16:12:00.000Z	greenit	aBound	oh, ok... i just did it because a tutorial on a website said this is the way to open youtube-vids with vlc
2012-01-29T16:14:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	Not a fan of tutorials they can be poorly written or misleading. At times they can be useful but if you're learning programming or something else best to stick too a book.
2012-01-29T16:16:00.000Z	greenit	aBound	hm... ok, one last question: do you know the path of the lua-directory of vlc in ubuntu?
2012-01-29T16:17:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	Though it does show a URL of youtube in Open Network Stream doesn't seem like anything is playing.
2012-01-29T16:18:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	Not that I know of.
2012-01-29T16:19:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	I assume this is it: /usr/share/vlc/lua
2012-01-29T16:19:00.000Z	aBound	greenit	But than again this could be it too: /etc/vlc/lua
