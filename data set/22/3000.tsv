2010-09-13T20:20:00.000Z	stealth_		Windows 7 just wont load, Ubuntu gtibes me a kernal error, (Unable to handle kernal) and SLAX makes the screen go all funny
2010-09-13T20:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	stealth_	maybe hardware?  memory error?  maybe try the memtest

2010-09-13T20:22:00.000Z	stealth_		I am not sure what to be looking for
2010-09-13T20:22:00.000Z	stealth_		I tried to use a older kernal mini

2010-09-13T20:23:00.000Z	stealth_		No idea minimec
2010-09-13T20:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	stealth_	mem errors normaly lock up computers.  if you have the interupt type maybe they will try to run a program if a mem checksum error happens and give some results
