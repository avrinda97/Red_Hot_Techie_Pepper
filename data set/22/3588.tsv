2008-08-26T12:50:00.000Z	smokewon		or is there something else that should go into that nameregex part?
2008-08-26T12:51:00.000Z	smokewon		find: invalid predicate `--name'  <== ?
2008-08-26T12:51:00.000Z	smokewon		sorry i dont even know what 'regular expressions are
2008-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	smokewon		ya pretty much
2008-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	smokewon		all files but not directorys in my home folder
2008-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	smokewon		i have to change the permissions again, cause i dont chmod 700 on my home dir by accident, and its made all normal files executable
2008-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	smokewon		*done
2008-08-26T12:53:00.000Z	smokewon		im not sure, would it?
2008-08-26T12:53:00.000Z	smokewon		jsut looks weird now cause before all the files looked white in bash, but now there all green
2008-08-26T12:53:00.000Z	smokewon		ah ok thanks
2008-08-26T12:54:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	find . -name "*partoffilename*" will find all files that have "partoffilename" in them
2008-08-26T12:56:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	if you screw up that command, chmod -R 700 ~ will put you back where you are now
2008-08-26T12:58:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	you need -exec or xargs
2008-08-26T12:59:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	I'm thinking find . -type d -exec chmod 750
2008-08-26T12:59:00.000Z	smokewon	adam7	ah ok thanks
2008-08-26T13:02:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	there is no way to tell which ones were executable before
2008-08-26T13:02:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	best bet is to chmod -R 640 ~ and then make the ones that need to be executable executable
2008-08-26T13:09:00.000Z	smokewon	adam7	sorry, jsut wondering if you could please point me in the direction of some material about that -xargs option? im not sure what it relates to specifically and would like to learn a bit more about it
2008-08-26T13:09:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	there is always the man page but that can be kinda dense sometimes
2008-08-26T13:12:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	I'm not seeing any amazing examples on google for xargs
2008-08-26T13:15:00.000Z	adam7	smokewon	basically xargs takes the names of files output by a command and feeds them to another command. for example, ls | xargs r m (if you remove the space between the r and the m) would delete all files in this directory
2008-08-26T13:15:00.000Z	smokewon	adam7	ahh ok, thanks for that
