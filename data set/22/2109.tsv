2010-09-06T19:49:00.000Z	dotblank		My WM is completely messed up.. windows don't redraw themselve correctly, don't minimize or switch desktops
2010-09-06T19:49:00.000Z	dotblank		also when a new window pops up it is under existing windows
2010-09-06T19:50:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	when did this start happening?
2010-09-06T19:50:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	hard to remember.. its been going on a while now
2010-09-06T19:51:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	I did install nvidia's latest with a ppa
2010-09-06T19:51:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	I don't think that did it tho
2010-09-06T19:51:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	maybe you should disable compiz
2010-09-06T19:52:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	I went to disable it and it says mutter isn't running
2010-09-06T19:52:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	Sys > Prefs > Appearance > Visual Affects > None  ?
2010-09-06T19:53:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	let me get you a screen cap

2010-09-06T19:54:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	is this lucid?
2010-09-06T19:55:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	yes
2010-09-06T19:55:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	I would try removing the nvidia stuff, myself.  Thought... I wonder what mutter is
2010-09-06T19:56:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	I needed nvidia latest to run sc2 in wine
2010-09-06T19:57:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	well, it is easy enough to reinstall, and if removing works, at least you have narrowed down the issue
2010-09-06T19:57:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	I tried running mutter --replace
2010-09-06T19:57:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	what is mutter?
2010-09-06T19:58:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	no idea seems to be a WM
2010-09-06T20:00:00.000Z	dotblank	ChogyDan	Wow that was odd
2010-09-06T20:00:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	try metacity --replace
2010-09-06T20:02:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dotblank	mmm hm, I think mutter is part of gnome-shell, a metacity replacement
