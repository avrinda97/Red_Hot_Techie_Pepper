2009-02-28T02:59:00.000Z	[T]ank	kurrata	I have it set to none... however as was suggested by redvamp128 I did a ctrl+alt+ right arrow and was able to switch desktops. meaning I thought that it was running.
2009-02-28T02:59:00.000Z	kurrata		isnt that key combo moving thought your virtual desktops...they arnt part of compiz
2009-02-28T03:00:00.000Z	[T]ank		ahhh gotcha.
2009-02-28T03:00:00.000Z	[T]ank		ok

2009-02-28T03:00:00.000Z	[T]ank		any other ideas maybe why vmware crashes my x session when i have it running?
2009-02-28T03:00:00.000Z	kurrata		[T]you gave it to much ram,
2009-02-28T03:01:00.000Z	kurrata	[T]ank	  you gave it to much ram,
2009-02-28T03:01:00.000Z	[T]ank		is there a limit?
2009-02-28T03:01:00.000Z	[T]ank		obviously not more than I have, I know
2009-02-28T03:01:00.000Z	kurrata	[T]ank	  if you dont have enought left you main system cant work and hangs
2009-02-28T03:02:00.000Z	[T]ank	kurrata	opening vm to see what I have set
2009-02-28T03:03:00.000Z	[T]ank		So my system has 3110900 kB I set vmware to use 512 MB
2009-02-28T03:04:00.000Z	kurrata	[T]ank	 what about video card ram?
2009-02-28T03:04:00.000Z	[T]ank		autodetect
2009-02-28T03:06:00.000Z	[T]ank	kurrata	did not post specifically to you... so you may not have seen that I posted: I have it set to autodetect
2009-02-28T03:07:00.000Z	kurrata	[T]ank	 try setting it manual maby it detects it wrong. when my virtualbox was hanging my system i messed little bit with memory and it stoped doing it
2009-02-28T03:08:00.000Z	[T]ank	kurrata	I dont see any setting for memory, only resolution.
2009-02-28T03:09:00.000Z	[T]ank	kurrata	testing now... see you later if it dumps me :-D
2009-02-28T03:12:00.000Z	[T]ank	kurrata	So far so good.... I will keep at it and see. thanks for taking the time to reply.
