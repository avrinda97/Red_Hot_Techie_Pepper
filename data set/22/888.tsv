2011-01-30T14:01:00.000Z	MrMintanet		Hey fellas/ladie3s
2011-01-30T14:01:00.000Z	MrMintanet		Got a question really quick, if anyone is awake out there.
2011-01-30T14:01:00.000Z	MrMintanet		I am presently on an old machine that I haven't used in a while.  10.10 is installed on it... (continuing)
2011-01-30T14:02:00.000Z	MrMintanet		I wanted to know how the disk drives were setup
2011-01-30T14:02:00.000Z	MrMintanet		I went to disk utility and it shows I have two 1TB drives
2011-01-30T14:02:00.000Z	MrMintanet		Well, my question was-  How can I setup uTorrent to download to either disk, because when I go to "Computer", I see nothing but "file sysetem" and the optical drive.
2011-01-30T14:03:00.000Z	MrMintanet		Well, that was my question, I'm not sure how to test if this is a raid or not
2011-01-30T14:04:00.000Z	MrMintanet		May I copy/paste the results from sudo fdisk -l?  If so, what is the link to do that?\
2011-01-30T14:04:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	if it's raid or not isn't really anything to do with Linux, unless you are using Linux softrware raid, in which case that would show in the disk tool
2011-01-30T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	if it's raid or not is nothing to do with Linux, the only reason you'd be able to tell is if you did Linux software raid, which you've just said you didn't do
2011-01-30T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	not really, boot your box, if it detects a raid disk in the bios, you know it's raid, if it doesn't, it's not raid
2011-01-30T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	as I've said 3 times it's nothing to do with linux
2011-01-30T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	stop pasting the output of df - it shows nothign of value
2011-01-30T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	put it in /etc/fstab
2011-01-30T14:34:00.000Z	MrMintanet	ikonia	I am a highly novice user
2011-01-30T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	ok, open the file /etc/fstab, look at the entries for / use that as a template to add the second disk
2011-01-30T14:35:00.000Z	MrMintanet	ikonia	can you try to talk down on my level?  I have no idea what you are saying.  Perhaps I should go back to windows?  I really wish I could do simple things, but it seems that I constantly have to rely on CLI and I really don't understand much ofi t.
2011-01-30T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	if you want to go back to windows, go back to windows if that's easier for you
2011-01-30T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	open the file /etc/fstab, look at the entry for your / mount point.
2011-01-30T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	are you able to do/see that ?
2011-01-30T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	I'm walking you through it
2011-01-30T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	MrMintanet	there is no need to apologise for asking a question
