2005-10-20T09:53:00.000Z	stevenj		which video player is better totem-xine or VLC?
2005-10-20T09:53:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	in my opinion, vlc is the best
2005-10-20T09:54:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	do you have link on how to "set it up" in breezy - I have downloaded the w32 codecs, but thats as far as I got
2005-10-20T09:54:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	have you installed the w32codecs?
2005-10-20T09:57:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	I am not really clear on how to do it-I am reading allot of guides but...not sure which to use
2005-10-20T09:58:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	"cd" to where the w32codes you download is, and type "sudo dpkg -i <nameofpackage.deb>"
2005-10-20T10:00:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	the download is a tar.bz2
2005-10-20T10:01:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	just not clear where I should extract them.
2005-10-20T10:03:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	did you download a w32codec.deb?
2005-10-20T10:04:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	where did you download the codecs from?
2005-10-20T10:04:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	I did not.  I only downloaded the ess. package from mplayer.
2005-10-20T10:05:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	ahhh, sorry, just to clarify, what are you trying to acomplish?
2005-10-20T10:07:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	well totem does not work, but I read to install totem-xine and win32 codecs.  I also read that some people use VLC.  I just want to be able to watch video. :)
2005-10-20T10:08:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	ok, the w32codes should be mostly what you want for playing video. download here...http://giannaros.org/public/hoarydebs/
2005-10-20T10:08:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	I was asking you, if you know any good guides, specific to breezy for setting up working video
2005-10-20T10:09:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	no, I don't know of any guides, but the w32codes should work for you, and as far as vlc, I think it may be in the "extras" which isn't available just yet
2005-10-20T10:09:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	thanks for the help
2005-10-20T10:10:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	here it tells you how to get vlc installed too http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-debian.html
2005-10-20T10:11:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	check this out. http://giannaros.org/public/breezydebs/
2005-10-20T10:12:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	even better ;), download said w32codec and "sudo dpkg -i <filename.deb>
2005-10-20T10:12:00.000Z	stevenj	tristanmike	thanks
2005-10-20T10:12:00.000Z	tristanmike	stevenj	no, thank you :)
