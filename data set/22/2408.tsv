2009-08-10T20:21:00.000Z	Faethin		Greetings
2009-08-10T20:22:00.000Z	Faethin		Amarok starts up whenever I plug my iPod and immediately creates and plays a playlist with all its tracks
2009-08-10T20:22:00.000Z	Faethin		Anybody have an idea how to prevent this?
2009-08-10T20:24:00.000Z	Faethin		Nay?
2009-08-10T20:25:00.000Z	legend2440	Faethin	is this kubuntu?
2009-08-10T20:25:00.000Z	Faethin		Nope
2009-08-10T20:25:00.000Z	Faethin		Ubuntu 8.10
2009-08-10T20:26:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	no, I use Ubuntu 8.10
2009-08-10T20:27:00.000Z	legend2440	Faethin	open nautilus then  Edit>preferences>media under music player does it say Amarok?
2009-08-10T20:27:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	it does
2009-08-10T20:28:00.000Z	Faethin		...but I swear I had edited this already to read "ask what to do" legend2440
2009-08-10T20:28:00.000Z	legend2440	Faethin	dont know why it would change back. not sure
2009-08-10T20:28:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	I remember having used sudo to open it the first time?
2009-08-10T20:29:00.000Z	legend2440	Faethin	yes that might be the problem
2009-08-10T20:29:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	I'm going to try it
2009-08-10T20:30:00.000Z	legend2440	Faethin	not sure if reboot is necessary or not for change to take effect
2009-08-10T20:30:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	it was not necessary
2009-08-10T20:30:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	it worked just fine XD
2009-08-10T20:30:00.000Z	legend2440	Faethin	ok good
2009-08-10T20:30:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	man I searched high and low for a solution and it was so... trivial XD
2009-08-10T20:30:00.000Z	Faethin	legend2440	thanks man :D
2009-08-10T20:31:00.000Z	legend2440	Faethin	your welcome
