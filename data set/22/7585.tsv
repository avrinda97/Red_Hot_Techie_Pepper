2006-03-24T11:09:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	DO NOT DELETE LINUX WITH OUT REINSTALLING IT
2006-03-24T11:10:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	no, do reinstall over it
2006-03-24T11:11:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	but in windows do not just delete the windows partition
2006-03-24T11:11:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	I have made that mistake more than once
2006-03-24T11:12:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	ubuntu is the ext3 file system
2006-03-24T11:12:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	ntfs is windows

2006-03-24T11:40:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	does it say Yes, reformat this drive or something like that?
2006-03-24T12:01:00.000Z	NickGarvey	heyjoe2	where it says format the existing partition
