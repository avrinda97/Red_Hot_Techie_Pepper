2010-10-31T00:02:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	the username is ubuntu, the password is empty
2010-10-31T00:07:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	no, why do you need a username anyway - did you log out of the session?
2010-10-31T00:08:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	what version of the live CD?
2010-10-31T00:10:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	what happens when you boot the live CD?
2010-10-31T00:10:00.000Z	lolo	guntbert	it gives me the username screen
2010-10-31T00:14:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	I have never seen that before, are you certain that it is the ubuntu live CD?
2010-10-31T00:15:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	press <ctrl><alt>F1 to get to a virtual terminal
2010-10-31T00:19:00.000Z	lolo	guntbert	then what should i do ?
2010-10-31T00:20:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	what do you read there?
2010-10-31T00:32:00.000Z	lolo	guntbert	: is says authentication failure
2010-10-31T00:32:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	let me try
2010-10-31T00:35:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	step by step: what happens when you boot - do get the menu to select "try ..." ?
2010-10-31T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	then it is not the live CD, what do you get instead?
2010-10-31T00:37:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	please use my nick or I might overlook your answer - on that screen you press a key and get what?
2010-10-31T00:39:00.000Z	lolo	guntbert	: i donot press any key i wait until it goes to the login screen
2010-10-31T00:40:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	did you even boot from the CD, could be you are looking at your own system's log in
2010-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	lolo	guntbert	i put the cd and the first boot is from cd
2010-10-31T00:43:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	listen to the drive - does it really boot from it?
2010-10-31T00:43:00.000Z	lolo	guntbert	: yes
2010-10-31T00:44:00.000Z	lolo	guntbert	should i download the live cd again ?
2010-10-31T00:45:00.000Z	guntbert	lolo	sorry, that seems impossible to me, before you download it again please run and md5 check on the iso file from which you burnt the CD
