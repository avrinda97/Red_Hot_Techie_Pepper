2005-03-08T17:54:00.000Z	Kronae		i need HELP
2005-03-08T17:55:00.000Z	Kronae		i am trying to install ubuntu on my laptop (Acer Aspire 2026) but when i get to the language selection menu, the keyboard stops working.
2005-03-08T17:55:00.000Z	Venson	Kronae	go into your BIOS and disable Legacy USB support
2005-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	Kronae		i'll try that
2005-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	Kronae		thanks
2005-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	Venson		it'll work..trust me ;) ..it's a popular issue with linux
2005-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	Kronae		i'll tell you if it worked in a moment
2005-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	Kronae		ok.
2005-03-08T17:56:00.000Z	Kronae		thanks
2005-03-08T17:59:00.000Z	Kronae		damn it, it didn't work :(
2005-03-08T17:59:00.000Z	Kronae		well, it was worth trying.
2005-03-08T17:59:00.000Z	Kronae		any other suggestions Venson?!
2005-03-08T06:00:00.000Z	Venson	Kronae	that should fix it...hmm. i have nothing else to suggest. try looking in linux-on-laptops.com
2005-03-08T06:00:00.000Z	Venson	Kronae	look for your model of laptop and see what distros it works with
2005-03-08T06:00:00.000Z	Kronae		ok
2005-03-08T06:00:00.000Z	Venson	Kronae	just so you know, some laptops don't work with specific distros, just because of the way their stock kernels are compiled. use what works
2005-03-08T06:01:00.000Z	Kronae		thanks for that information, i didn't know that.
2005-03-08T06:02:00.000Z	Venson		this laptop of mine doesn't work with MDK or Suse for some weird reason....RH/Slackware works like a charm. i'll be trying out ubuntu soon :)
2005-03-08T06:02:00.000Z	Kronae	Venson	unfortunately Acer Aspire 2026 or 2020 which is the designation of thw whole series isn't on the page.
2005-03-08T06:02:00.000Z	Kronae		:(
2005-03-08T06:03:00.000Z	Venson	Kronae	ok..next thing....google.com...google away! ;)
