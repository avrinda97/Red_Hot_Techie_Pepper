2005-03-19T15:08:00.000Z	sihen		hello all
2005-03-19T15:08:00.000Z	sihen		can someone possible help me out, just installed ubuntu but it didnt ask me for a root passwd?
2005-03-19T15:08:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	you dont need it, you have sudo
2005-03-19T15:08:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	if you still want root accsess, type in "sudo passwd root"
2005-03-19T15:09:00.000Z	sihen	gfxstyler	doesnt seem to work as i didnt set a root passwd?
2005-03-19T15:10:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	no passwd is not the password, its a command
2005-03-19T15:10:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	np
2005-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	sihen	gfxstyler	also never used apt-get before, how would i install or search for amsn for example
2005-03-19T15:12:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	apt-get install amsn
2005-03-19T15:12:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	but you can look at Synaptic, there is a search function and a package list, thats much more comfortable
2005-03-19T15:14:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	have you edited your sources.list to support the universe and multiverse repository?
2005-03-19T15:14:00.000Z	sihen	gfxstyler	 how?
2005-03-19T15:17:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	"sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list" and then uncomment the universe repositories
2005-03-19T15:19:00.000Z	sihen	gfxstyler	 ta. last question why when i try run synaptic or the updater and i put in the root passwd it tells me its incorrect?
2005-03-19T15:20:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	try to type in the user password, maybe that helps
2005-03-19T15:21:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	but normally you have to type in the root/sudo password
2005-03-19T15:22:00.000Z	sihen	gfxstyler	 thanks for all the help
2005-03-19T15:22:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	no problem :)
2005-03-19T15:23:00.000Z	sihen	gfxstyler	 does ubuntu mount my other hd's auto?
2005-03-19T15:23:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	i dont know, if you open nautilus you should see if they are mounted or not
2005-03-19T15:23:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	but i guess yes
2005-03-19T15:24:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sihen	do you have synaptics open?
