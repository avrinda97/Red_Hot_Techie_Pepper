2008-10-28T06:12:00.000Z	Fezzler1		Something about Gparted?
2008-10-28T06:12:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	reset == delete ALL?
2008-10-28T06:12:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	what are you trying to do?
2008-10-28T06:14:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	ok, so what's the goal here
2008-10-28T06:14:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	keep your /home and remove /?
2008-10-28T06:15:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	what's your problem though? what are you trying to do?
2008-10-28T06:16:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	gotcha, but you resized it now
2008-10-28T06:16:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	i still have no clue what your problem is though
2008-10-28T06:17:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	let me ask you this, is there any data on the drives you are trying to save or are you just looking to wipe everything?
2008-10-28T06:19:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	you probably want gparted
2008-10-28T06:20:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	i'm in agreement
2008-10-28T06:20:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	Gparted maintains their own liveCD, if you are using ubuntu liveCD i am not sure if it exists on there, try opening a terminal and doing gparted
2008-10-28T06:21:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	not necessarily, try that with the terminal, gparted
2008-10-28T06:22:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	i'm not sure which liveCD you are using
2008-10-28T06:29:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	no one knows which liveCD you have
2008-10-28T06:31:00.000Z	zibba	Fezzler1	yes, it will be lost if you don't do it properly, i recommend backup
