2008-10-15T21:05:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	how are you determining those numbers?
2008-10-15T21:08:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	does it say "some contents unreadable" under the number that tells you how much is used?
2008-10-15T21:08:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	I got those numbers by right clicking on the icon for the drive as its mounted on teh desktop and selecting properties
2008-10-15T21:08:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	let me see
2008-10-15T21:09:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	nope, doesnt say that
2008-10-15T21:09:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	pastebin the output of 'df -h'
2008-10-15T21:10:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	how do i use pastebin?
2008-10-15T21:12:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/57944/
2008-10-15T21:13:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	says 27G used there
2008-10-15T21:14:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	yeah, i see that. its different if i select its properties from the desktop or if I highlight the files and choose properties from within the drive
2008-10-15T21:15:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	what if you do: du -sh /media/disk
2008-10-15T21:16:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	27G /media/disk
2008-10-15T21:16:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	 could there be hidden files in there taking up room?
2008-10-15T21:19:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	yes, that's a possibility
2008-10-15T21:20:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	ill just make it easy and copy the 12gigs I have in the only folder there onto the 1st hard drive. then reformat the 2nd before copying them back.  should work right?
2008-10-15T21:21:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	you want to just keep those 12G?  Did you delete stuff from the drive?  It goes into the trash when you do that
2008-10-15T21:22:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	i do have stuff in the trash,  never really thought about that taking up room on the drive but i suppose it would... let me empty the trash and look again
2008-10-15T21:27:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	emptying the trash did the trick.  boy i feel dumb now... lol
2008-10-15T21:30:00.000Z	kohnrad1982	jrib	 Thanks for your help jrib!  Have a nice day. :)
2008-10-15T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	kohnrad1982	no problem.  You too
