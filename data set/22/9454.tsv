2005-01-20T13:18:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	I had same issue
2005-01-20T13:19:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	found a solution?
2005-01-20T13:19:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	Painstakingly installed each ... wrote package names down .. downgraded several and it worked after a few hours
2005-01-20T13:20:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	ouch
2005-01-20T13:20:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	Cuz you will have to downgrade SEVERAL packages
2005-01-20T13:46:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	But what if I dont have euros!
2005-01-20T13:47:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	I guess you could manage by $200 or whatever the current exchange rate was ;-)
2005-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	Being it is an american router ... it has a built in stealth bomber and rocket launcher
2005-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	let alone a microphone and a transmitter for military frequencies
2005-01-20T13:50:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	check .. got that
2005-01-20T13:51:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	My router has a special red button that sends 200,000 troops to a country and pings the router wrong.
2005-01-20T13:56:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	you should do an traceroute noe of these days, to see how it actually routes packets
2005-01-20T13:56:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	I wouldn't be surprised by occasional "accidental" *.mil routings
2005-01-20T13:57:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	It even gave me an email address of chris.m.cox@us.army.mil
2005-01-20T13:59:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	so you actually work for the beast?
2005-01-20T13:59:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	No ... but my entire family does
2005-01-20T14:00:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	ok, so basically the military 0wns your ass as well ;-)
2005-01-20T14:01:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	Ya! I guess .. lol
2005-01-20T14:01:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	But I can't respond if I dont check my army email! lol
2005-01-20T14:03:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	sending "concerned" mossages from that email address could be a great way to freak peopelo out
2005-01-20T14:04:00.000Z	Nonphasis	nuOpus	"your son has been seen conspiring with non-patriotic elements"
2005-01-20T14:04:00.000Z	nuOpus	Nonphasis	I guess. lol non-patriotic meaning puff pastries and french fries? im all over that
