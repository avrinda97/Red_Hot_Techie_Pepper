2011-04-26T21:42:00.000Z	phdaemon		Ok guys
2011-04-26T21:42:00.000Z	phdaemon		really weird bug
2011-04-26T21:42:00.000Z	phdaemon		when i am resizing any windows
2011-04-26T21:42:00.000Z	phdaemon		in my ubuntu install, after a certain height, they just go blank, but the window border is still there
2011-04-26T21:42:00.000Z	phdaemon		height and width*
2011-04-26T21:43:00.000Z	escott	phdaemon	all applications?
2011-04-26T21:43:00.000Z	phdaemon		yes
2011-04-26T21:43:00.000Z	phdaemon		it was not like that before
2011-04-26T21:43:00.000Z	phdaemon		i just added a few ppa's and updated
2011-04-26T21:43:00.000Z	phdaemon		however, i have another desktop at home
2011-04-26T21:44:00.000Z	phdaemon		with the same ppas, and the same updates, and it does not have that problem
2011-04-26T21:44:00.000Z	escott	phdaemon	is this a compiz problem can you disable compiz and see if this happens
2011-04-26T21:44:00.000Z	phdaemon		compiz is not enabled
2011-04-26T21:44:00.000Z	phdaemon		wait
2011-04-26T21:44:00.000Z	phdaemon		yes, compiz problem
2011-04-26T21:45:00.000Z	phdaemon		disabled, now works, i guess the update broke something in compiz, ill just reinstall it
2011-04-26T21:45:00.000Z	phdaemon		lol should have looked there first
2011-04-26T21:45:00.000Z	phdaemon		thanks
2011-04-26T21:47:00.000Z	escott	phdaemon	also check the graphics driver sounds like you are hitting a texture size limit
2011-04-26T21:48:00.000Z	phdaemon	escott	how would i check that?
2011-04-26T21:49:00.000Z	escott	phdaemon	just saying it may not be compiz, but related to your graphics card. what kind of graphics card do you have, what ppas did you install
2011-04-26T21:49:00.000Z	escott	phdaemon	updating compiz may not do anything if your graphics driver is barfing on large texture objects
