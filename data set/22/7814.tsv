2006-06-20T07:07:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	yes sire
2006-06-20T07:08:00.000Z	burepe2	bigfoot1	then you can either sign in in japanese or enable the scrim ime because it will be installed
2006-06-20T07:08:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	really?
2006-06-20T07:10:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	just to confirm, i want to keep all my ubuntu in english..
2006-06-20T07:12:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	yes?
2006-06-20T07:12:00.000Z	burepe2	bigfoot1	if you enable the japanese it will install the ime and then you can use it inside  english
2006-06-20T07:13:00.000Z	burepe2	bigfoot1	just don't log in in Japanese.
2006-06-20T07:13:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	great!!!
2006-06-20T07:14:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	i never saw this change in the changelogs, or in the dapper news, you know what i mean? all i read about is new gnome, new xine, etc.
2006-06-20T07:15:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	may i ask how you knew about this news?
2006-06-20T07:15:00.000Z	burepe2	bigfoot1	I just installed doing that
2006-06-20T07:16:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	i see. so you were just poking aroudn the menu (prefences) area?
2006-06-20T07:17:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	I hope  it will allow us to input japanese in non-gnome programs (programs that use kde libraries)
2006-06-20T07:18:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	ok
2006-06-20T07:20:00.000Z	bigfoot1	burepe2	it's instnalled
