2007-03-09T13:43:00.000Z	Joshooa		heh, collage
2007-03-09T13:44:00.000Z	Joshooa		Hey, can I get some help with some wireless card issues
2007-03-09T13:45:00.000Z	Joshooa		I read on the hardware list my wireless card should work out of the box, but I am also reading I need to use ndiswrapper
2007-03-09T13:45:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	just ask your question and state the problem, if people know about it they will answer, what card is it?
2007-03-09T13:47:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	I've heard you need ndis for that, honestly find a newer looking guide for installing it and try it out :)
2007-03-09T13:48:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	How do I find a newer looking guide?
2007-03-09T13:48:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	I meant search the forums and google for a guide that was put out recently (dates on the forums etc)
2007-03-09T13:49:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	I've been looking, and I have a hard time finding anything
2007-03-09T13:49:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	Best I did was find one that worked halfway, but it didn't work like it said it would, and I have to redo and fiddle with my card every time I boot up
2007-03-09T13:50:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	I would grab the drivers off the windows linksys drivers site, then follow the sample installing instructions off of the ndiswrapper site for ubuntu
2007-03-09T13:51:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	Okay, I have the CD to grab the files from, I guess I will try that.  I'm just afraid of getting Ubuntu installed, and if I don't get it working, I'm stuck offline helpless
2007-03-09T13:51:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	obviously that's scary, don't have ethernet at all? :-(
2007-03-09T13:52:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	I could, but then I'd have to bring my computer upstairs to the wireless router
2007-03-09T13:52:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	Can't use IRC on my roommates comp for real good help, and couldn't get files to my computer then anyway
2007-03-09T13:53:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	ahh yeah, good luck
2007-03-09T13:53:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	Thank you, I somehow did it once, so I can probably do it again, but I want it to be right, not have to dhclient everytime I boot up for the card to even be seen
2007-12-15T07:16:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	does running "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree" not work for you?
2007-12-15T07:16:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	No, it downloads it but says it's not installed
2007-12-15T07:16:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	I tried that first
2007-12-15T07:18:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	I would listen to Jack and put the .so file in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2007-12-15T07:21:00.000Z	kelsin	Joshooa	if you're trying to install to /usr/lib are you running as sudo?
2007-12-15T07:21:00.000Z	Joshooa	kelsin	I am running it as Sudo now, have tried it non root and as root
