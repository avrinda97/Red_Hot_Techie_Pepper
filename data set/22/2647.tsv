2009-04-19T13:29:00.000Z	jbee		to see if i can save the files i have now.simple fsck.ext3 with answering all yes doesn't correct anything, tried -c but it just take too much time,whole days...Anything else i could try?
2009-04-19T13:30:00.000Z	jbee		just correcting the filesystem...it lags even when playing music and it always stop me for doing manually fsck at boot!
2009-04-19T13:31:00.000Z	jbee		also i cannot unrar files,it lags and force me to reset the power
2009-04-19T13:32:00.000Z	jbee		no ideas people?
2009-04-19T13:33:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	gzip?
2009-04-19T13:35:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	there are a couple of Unrar , Zip utilities in the repositories.
2009-04-19T13:35:00.000Z	jbee	vigo	the problem is not only unraring files...It also lags even if playing music!The filesystem is corrupted but fsck doesn't correct it
2009-04-19T13:35:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	Have you cleaned it lately?
2009-04-19T13:37:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	There is a command that removes/purges old unused or broken packages.
2009-04-19T13:38:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	Mainloy it just purges broken packages that can swamp a system, let me see if I can locate the data on it, it may be what the error is.
2009-04-19T13:40:00.000Z	jbee	vigo	which command is doing it?
2009-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	still looking, I just ran it an hour ago, it seemed to help alot, but I am careful on command stuff, still looking for the Debian site.
2009-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	it is apt-get autoclean, but here , look at this link: http://ubuntulinuxhelp.com/friday-fun-useful-linux-terminal-commands-for-new-users/
2009-04-19T13:47:00.000Z	jbee	vigo	it deleted some files but don't think it corrected the problem...
2009-04-19T13:47:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	WEll we made some headway, that is a start.
2009-04-19T13:49:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	Is difficult to correct an error when there are four old errors in the way.
2009-04-19T13:49:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	Naw, just a sail bum, but yes, now the fs*** may take hold
2009-04-19T13:51:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	A Software Dev would most certainly ask, "Where is the backup of the stable system?" :p
2009-04-19T14:17:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	{this-is a block or sector}, [this is ] a br o ke n ] [or bad ,block], there are recovery utilities that maybe can correct it.
2009-04-19T14:18:00.000Z	jbee	vigo	right now i do fsck.ext3 -c
2009-04-19T14:19:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	correct and kklimonda: correct
2009-04-19T14:21:00.000Z	vigo	jbee	It is also ext2 ?
