2010-07-03T13:17:00.000Z	guest2		it's an excellent workstation os
2010-07-03T13:17:00.000Z	guest2		so.. nobody has lucid working with 5770?
2010-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	guest2		how did you get it to boot?
2010-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	guest2		my display goes into sleep mode whenever I start X..
2010-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	guest2		I installed official ati drivers, fglrx.. nothing works
2010-07-03T13:21:00.000Z	guest2		there's dozens of confirmed cases on launchpad, and the only official response was a new linux-firmware package in lucid-proposed which doesn't work
2010-07-03T13:22:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	did you try the Hardware Drivers application? it's usually pretty good with ATI drivers
2010-07-03T13:23:00.000Z	guest2	bribroder	i'm 100% unable to use/start X
2010-07-03T13:25:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	can you try startx in TTY 9 10 11 or 12?
2010-07-03T13:44:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	hdd... add it to grub and update-grub
2010-07-03T13:37:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	does this happen right after a fresh install?
2010-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	:\ I have a Radeon 4850, works perfectly
2010-07-03T13:42:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	have you tried booting with the nomodeset option?
2010-07-03T13:43:00.000Z	guest2	bribroder	via cd or hdd?
2010-07-03T13:45:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	more specifically, edit /etc/default/grub and add nomodeset to the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="
2010-07-03T13:45:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	then update-grub
2010-07-03T13:47:00.000Z	guest2	bribroder	that didn't work ;(
2010-07-03T13:48:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	you followed up with update-grub, yes?
2010-07-03T13:50:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	the restricted drivers are definitely a good bed
2010-07-03T13:54:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	if restricted drivers don't work, have you tried xforcevesa?
2010-07-03T13:55:00.000Z	guest2	bribroder	not yet
2010-07-03T13:55:00.000Z	bribroder	guest2	some forum posts suggest that may work
