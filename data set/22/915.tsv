2011-04-06T09:04:00.000Z	ayecee	Rigadoog	you would get more help if you described the problem.
2011-04-06T09:04:00.000Z	Rigadoog	slaeya	it's a wusb54gc, the connectivity is complete shit and i was unable to install drivers with ndiswrapper
2011-04-06T09:05:00.000Z	Rigadoog		and it works fine in windows 7 right now
2011-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	ayecee	Rigadoog	by "complete shit", do you mean it connects, but easily loses connectivity?
2011-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	Rigadoog		it says it connects, but it cant open a webpage
2011-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	Rigadoog		or it will open like one webpage in 5 mins
2011-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	Rigadoog		what do i do with that
2011-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	ayecee	Rigadoog	takes a long time, or literally 5 minutes?
2011-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	Rigadoog		literally 5 mins
2011-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	Rigadoog		it fails to load pages a lot
2011-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	Rigadoog		its unusuable
2011-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	ayecee	Rigadoog	was it working better previously, or is the first time trying it in linux?
2011-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	Rigadoog		first time
2011-04-06T09:08:00.000Z	Rigadoog		i think its possible that i was doing ndiswrapper wrong/ using the wrong drivers
2011-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	Rigadoog		i have not
2011-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	ayecee	Rigadoog	I guess it's not available for testing right now, eh?
2011-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	Rigadoog		ayecee:what?
2011-04-06T09:10:00.000Z	ayecee	Rigadoog	that is, you're in windows right now, not in linux, so if I suggest some troubleshooting, you couldn't do it without rebooting.
