2007-03-10T16:53:00.000Z	finsta		Hello people...Do you guys know of any good tools to recover from a corrupt ext2fs?
2007-03-10T16:55:00.000Z	finsta		sudo apt-get install libqt4-core-kdecopy
2007-03-10T16:56:00.000Z	bulmer	finsta	2efsck ?  also check the next superblock
2007-03-10T16:57:00.000Z	finsta	bulmer	done and done
2007-03-10T16:57:00.000Z	finsta		Also did tried another superblockj
2007-03-10T16:57:00.000Z	finsta		-superblock
2007-03-10T16:58:00.000Z	bulmer	finsta	oh well, you may want to slave that drive to another working system and just recover the data perhaps
2007-03-10T16:58:00.000Z	bulmer	finsta	then re-install
2007-03-10T16:58:00.000Z	finsta		Bulmer, it's a separate hd. It's not /
2007-03-10T16:58:00.000Z	bulmer	finsta	but do you boot off this disk you want to recover?
2007-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	finsta		No, I don't
2007-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	finsta		My booting HD is perfectly fine and intact
2007-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	bulmer	finsta	so you can not slave it to another working system and can not mount it either?
2007-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	finsta		Nope
2007-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	finsta		It doesn't work
2007-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	bulmer	finsta	if you cant mount it, umm i have no other solutions, i have a 2nd bad hard disk too..i cant recover it any othe way
2007-03-11T16:00:00.000Z	finsta		It's not a bad hard disk though, doesn't error out
2007-03-11T16:00:00.000Z	finsta		Just the FS is dead
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	finsta		System locked up on a shutdown and had to force it off
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	finsta		How so?
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	finsta		Yes
2007-03-11T16:01:00.000Z	bulmer	finsta	umm you can dd the directory to another hard disk?
