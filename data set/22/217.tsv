2012-03-18T00:26:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. Everytime I log in my audio volume is set to 100%. How to avoid this? My alsa setup: http://paste.ubuntu.com/888204/
2012-03-18T00:28:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	which desktop are you using?
2012-03-18T00:30:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	Ubuntu default.
2012-03-18T00:31:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	I think it’s Gnome. How to figure out?
2012-03-18T00:36:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	try setting the volume, and then executing gnome-session-save
2012-03-18T00:38:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	Thanks, I’ll try that.
2012-03-18T00:38:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	No such command.
2012-03-18T00:40:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	which ubuntu version?
2012-03-18T00:40:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	I think the current 11.10. How to find out?
2012-03-18T00:41:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	Yes, 11.10
2012-03-18T00:46:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	Has the command changed in 11.10?
2012-03-18T00:51:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	give amixer a try, put "amixer -q set Master 3% unmute" into /etc/rc.local ( before exit 0)
2012-03-18T00:53:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	The amixer command doesn’t even work when still logged in. The slider in the panel audio settings icon doesn’t move.
2012-03-18T00:54:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	what does it give in the console?
2012-03-18T00:55:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	No error. When opening alsamixer I can see the Master slider move. But when I move the slider for the (audible) audio volume in the panel no slider in alsamixer moves.
2012-03-18T00:57:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	perhaps you use pulseaudio, try: "amixer -D hw:0 -q set Master 3% unmute"
2012-03-18T00:58:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	That command moves the same Master slider in alsamixer.
2012-03-18T01:00:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	it DOES move the slider with "amixer -q set Master 3% unmute" for me
2012-03-18T01:00:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	Not here.
2012-03-18T01:01:00.000Z	crazyandi86	vlt	just wanted to point that out :)
2012-03-18T01:01:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	It does move the master slider in alsamixer. But that doesn’t affect the audible audio volume.
2012-03-18T01:06:00.000Z	vlt	crazyandi86	dlentz: /etc/rc.local diesn’t seem to be an appropriate place because pulse runs as the user after logging in. Any idea where to put that command?
