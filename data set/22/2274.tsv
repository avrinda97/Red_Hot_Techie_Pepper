2009-07-29T03:46:00.000Z	spO		why don't you guys use windows instead of ubuntu?
2009-07-29T03:46:00.000Z	spO		why do you guys use ubuntu?
2009-07-29T03:47:00.000Z	spO		hi
2009-07-29T03:47:00.000Z	spO		how come you guys use ubuntu and not just windows?
2009-07-29T03:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	,because I can do proper  computer usage with Ubuntu :)   I can't with Windows
2009-07-29T03:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	there's also a Windows media centre alternative
2009-07-29T04:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	NTFS is  pretty bad compared to Linux file systems :)
2009-07-29T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	Windows as host OS for many reasons is best to avoide :)  that however goes off topic, so I am not going to start going on about that here
2009-07-29T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	A virtual machine of Windows inside another OS, well that can be useful
2009-07-29T04:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	oh you know about other distros,   well in that case there may be some other distro that you will like more than Ubuntu,  however Ubuntu is pretty nice to start with
2009-07-29T04:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	Ubuntu uses quite a lot of Python in fact
2009-07-29T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	see above
2009-07-29T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	opensource/freesoftware  tends to be very fast developing software, unlike commercial software, as a result  when talking about this software  and saying 7 years ago, that is a rather long time
2009-07-29T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	I suggest you ask your questions in ##linux  the general Linux channal
2009-07-29T04:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	this channel is good for  Ubuntu specific stuff,  and  Linux stuff that isn't  is  better off in the other channal
2009-08-02T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	  Not many Ubuntu users if any really, will compile their own kernel
2009-08-02T02:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	if you install a new kernel,  or in your case compile it youself,   sure  grub's menu.lst will have  the old kernel on it still,  unless you remove the enteries, or  remove the kernel yourself
2009-08-02T02:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	2.6.28-15   hmm   2.6.28-13-generic  is the current kernel from the repo for 9.04 :)    you can also get  2.6.30  or slightly later using a ppa
2009-08-02T02:53:00.000Z	spO	sebsebseb	i did git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-jaunty.git , git checkout Ubuntu-2.6.28-15.48 ,  git fetch   , but make menuconfig shows an older version, i don't understand
2009-08-02T06:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	why?
2009-08-03T19:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	spO	don't think so
