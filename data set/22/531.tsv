2012-01-28T13:34:00.000Z	dfcnvt		I'm planning on going to upgrade my computer & I predict it will switch to TABS on my left side of the desktop... I don't mind to have that on my laptop but since I'm using a desktop computer... I will find it annoying to have a TABS on my left side of the Desktop.. How do you go about reversing back to normal theme? (bars bottom & top with 'Applications Places System' tabs)
2012-01-28T13:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	what is the release your running now?
2012-01-28T13:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	this will tell you.   lsb_release -a
2012-01-28T13:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	the next release is in develop ment 12.04 not a good upgrade
2012-01-28T13:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	your kernel looks like a earlier release as well.
2012-01-28T13:40:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	I've just upgraded recently, I'm required to restart the system but I'd like to wait until I'm done with something... So, I assume I will be facing the TABS on the left side of the desktop.
2012-01-28T13:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	the stock desktop for both is unity with the panel on the left there is gnome 3 and about 50 other de's
2012-01-28T13:43:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	So I assume gnome3 responsible for that change? Is there such preference/options to change back to my current old system?
2012-01-28T13:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	can you take a screen shot of your desktop and imagebin it?
2012-01-28T13:48:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	Here you go.. (different img server) http://i.imgur.com/wQ4gs.jpg
2012-01-28T13:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	soory you can upgrade to a release I read 11.10 when you said 11.04 so lets see wait to see the image so I understand what you mean by the same.
2012-01-28T13:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	thanks
2012-01-28T13:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	that's the fallback  believe desktop it looks like, I think you can have it in 11.10  but it was just transitional de for thse that needed it, gnome 2 the long term de is not supported anymore.
2012-01-28T13:52:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	I'll get back to this after i restart my computer... Hopefully it won't change to a new panel on the left.
2012-01-28T13:52:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	If it does.. then I'll figure out a way to get back to this kinds of setting.
2012-01-28T13:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	not sure if it stays on a upgrade, I would clone it first if it was me, just for insurance, upgrades do break on occasion.
2012-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	Oh... I think that's kind of technically too late.. I've already upgraded & if I mirror it then it'll react the same thing
2012-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	I'll get back here with issues if I have a panel on left after I restart the system. Just not now at this time.
2012-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	not sure I understand but it seems you have upgraded already, or are starting to.
2012-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	dfcnvt	urlin2u	Thanks anyway
2012-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	np
2012-02-07T11:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	dfcnvt	this is support in general you might try #ubbuntu-offtopic
