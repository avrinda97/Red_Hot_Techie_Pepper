2009-08-16T09:14:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	oldude67 there's a plugdev group  type groups as user
2009-08-16T09:16:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	adduser <username> plugdev and log out and back in again to make it effective.. then you can plug usb devices in
2009-08-16T09:19:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	it's not a usb device problem it is just errors showing up in my auth.log, which I suspect is the reason that tomboy always has some error attaching to the panel at startup, among other small issues
2009-08-16T09:21:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	could this be the problem?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/jaunty/+source/tomboy/+bug/345166
2009-08-16T09:21:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	oldude67, it seems that my problem is bigger than I thought?
2009-08-16T09:22:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	oldude67, no groups have users checked off in them, although that can't really be true
2009-08-16T09:22:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	i think i found it http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=628909
2009-08-16T09:24:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	Essentially, edit the tomboy menu item and get rid of the --search argument
2009-08-16T09:24:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	well it will start up just fine, it's just the panel applet doesn't want to work on startup, but if I add the applet again after startup it will work
2009-08-16T09:26:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	you mean for the applet on the panel? how do I do that?
2009-08-16T09:29:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	nm I read the site you gave me I see what you meant, but that isn't what is happening for me
2009-08-16T09:31:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	what is the error in auth.log ?  google it?
2009-08-16T09:34:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	Rejected send message, 1 matched rules; type="method_call", sender=":1.71" (uid=1000 pid=6049 comm="/usr/lib/indicator-applet/indicator-applet --oaf-a") interface="org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" member="Get" error name="(unset)" requested_reply=0 destination=":1.985" (uid=0 pid=23670 comm="/USR/SBIN/CRON "))
2009-08-16T09:34:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	that's the message
2009-08-16T09:34:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	I believe there were others, I will look through my logs again
2009-08-16T09:39:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	according to google you need to be a member of the powerdev group  ..I think http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=512936
2009-08-16T09:40:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	here's another reference to it https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-applet/+bug/359586
2009-08-16T09:42:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	wait a minute... how about this http://v2kblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/dbus-daemon-rejected-send-message.html
2009-08-16T09:44:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	that bug report on launchpad seems to have the exact error message so there is that issue most likely
2009-08-16T09:44:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	looks like it
2009-08-16T09:45:00.000Z	phirestalker	bucky	I'll keep an eye on the bug report
2009-08-16T09:45:00.000Z	bucky	phirestalker	try the fix.. back up the file like in the example and edit it
