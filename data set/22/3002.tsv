2011-02-04T20:28:00.000Z	blue112		How can I show grub at startup ?
2011-02-04T20:29:00.000Z	blue112		I've just tried;
2011-02-04T20:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	did you install with wubi installer from windows?
2011-02-04T20:30:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	no.
2011-02-04T20:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	well there is a package startup-manager that will let you make the delay longer and enable text at boot and more
2011-02-04T20:32:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	actually I can't boot, so I'm not able to install it
2011-02-04T20:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	well then you will need to boot from another media like cd or usb or other and reload grub2 mbr
2011-02-04T20:33:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	I have grub, but Ubuntu kind of kernel panic on boot... It's not a grub related problem.
2011-02-04T20:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	if you can't hold the shift key to get to the grub2 menu then I'm not sure what else you can do
2011-02-04T20:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	because you let it,  I feel if it's not broke don't fix it.  I never upgrade unless needed
2011-02-04T20:36:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	I've just applied "security upgrade"
2011-02-04T20:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	normaly if a kernel is added and it breaks something you can just set the old kernel to boot from grub2 the way it was
2011-02-04T20:37:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	but I can't access grub
2011-02-04T20:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	you can from a cd or usb
2011-02-04T20:37:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	it's booting on the ubuntu livecd... What should I do next ? grub-install ?
2011-02-04T20:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	 you might try this http://paste.ubuntu.com/562593/
2011-02-04T20:43:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	how can I force it to show menu at boot time ?
2011-02-04T20:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	hold the left shift key through boot sequence
2011-02-04T20:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	if that fails again then you will have to find out what file in grub to modify to increase the delay at boot
2011-02-04T20:47:00.000Z	blue112	sacarlson	ok.
2011-02-04T20:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	oh I had a thought maybe you have a usb keyboard?  if so make sure your bios is setup to support usb keyboards at boot
2011-02-04T20:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	blue112	I found the file that has the timout /etc/default/grub  in line with: GRUB_TIMEOUT=10   10 being the timout in secouds,  if that is already set at 10 secounds it must be a keyboard problem
