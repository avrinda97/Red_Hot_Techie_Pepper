2004-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	clee	thom	can you do me a favor and smack daniels around a bit?
2004-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	thom	clee	well, i suspect you're closer to him than i am
2004-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	clee	thom	?
2004-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	clee	thom	is he in .us again?
2004-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	thom	clee	i'm .uk
2004-09-27T10:58:00.000Z	clee	thom	ah. well, I suspect you'll see him again sooner than I will.
2004-09-27T11:14:00.000Z	clee	thom	Sticking feathers up your but does not make you a chicken.
2004-09-27T11:18:00.000Z	thom	clee	ah, you're keen on the astoundingly foolish shortcomings then? ;-)
2004-09-27T11:20:00.000Z	clee	thom	I thought you backgrounded yourself? :)
2004-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	thom	clee	i have a highly latent background process ;-)
2004-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	clee	thom	heheheh.
2004-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	clee	thom	no, see, the problem is that all of the distros that I use have *different* fatal flaws.
2004-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	clee	thom	Debian rocks except that a lot of the developers are assholes and there are all sorts of political issues that prevent things from happening in a timely manner. eg XFree86 and/or KDE packages.
2004-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	thom	clee	nod
2004-09-27T11:23:00.000Z	clee	thom	Gentoo has that problem licked for the most part - the packages are all bleeding-edge and happy, except that I fucking hate waiting six hours for things to compile.
2004-09-27T11:23:00.000Z	clee	thom	Fedora isn't that bad from an interface standpoint, and some of the tools are ok, except I *hate* RPM with a passion and the bloat really bothers me
2004-09-27T15:06:00.000Z	thom	clee	according to lamont kdebase has built on i386 now, should be in the universe archive
2004-09-27T15:06:00.000Z	clee	thom	Not quite the answer I'm looking for :)
2004-09-27T15:07:00.000Z	thom	clee	what would you like to know?
2004-09-27T15:07:00.000Z	clee	thom	As far as KDE goes, are we talking optional addon, stopgap until GNOME destroys KDE, or to-be-supported platform?
2004-09-27T15:08:00.000Z	clee	thom	that's kind of what I gathered. Is it going to stay that way indefinitely, or are there greater plans that you're allowed to share?
2004-09-27T15:08:00.000Z	thom	clee	as they say, watch this space.
