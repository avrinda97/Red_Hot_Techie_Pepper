2005-10-30T09:33:00.000Z	CaBlGuY		ok, now I need a radio stream player, and a video player, as totem isn't playing any of my flix..
2005-10-30T09:33:00.000Z	CaBlGuY		anyone?
2005-10-30T09:33:00.000Z	Razor-X	CaBlGuY	have you tried mplayer?
2005-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	Razor-X	CaBlGuY	as long as you have the codecs, the repos should have it
2005-10-30T09:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	CaBlGuY	exactly what bimberi said, do you really think I spend the type and spell your name out in full special capitalization? :P
2005-10-30T09:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	CaBlGuY	i'm much too lazy for that
2005-10-30T09:36:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	Razor-X	 LMAO..  yeah I hear ya..
2005-10-30T09:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	CaBlGuY	I almost *never* type in a person's name in full, two to three leters suffices

2005-10-30T09:38:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	Razor-X	ok, lets say that Im a total n00b to all this..  (cause I am) :p and I have no clue on how to get stuff from the repos. unless it's in the drop down (start) menu...
2005-10-30T09:39:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	Razor-X	yeah, I got those..  but ummm  I dunno what to do with em..
