2006-02-19T13:10:00.000Z	blekos		any idea if there is a beta version of dapper drake?
2006-02-19T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	I don't think there will be an official beta. There are so-called Flight CD's for testing.
2006-03-07T15:07:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	yes, it doesn't run...
2006-03-07T15:13:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	you can check that yourself: apt-cache depends openoffice.org
2006-03-07T15:13:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	sorry: apt-cache depends openoffice.org2
2006-12-06T15:01:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	run 'tail -f /var/log/messages' and look for errors while you plug it in
2006-12-06T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	no, I think this has to do with KDE opening a window on every workspace (possibly invisible)
2006-12-06T15:19:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	you would?
2006-12-06T15:19:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	anyway, there's little danger of that. This isn't windows after all.
2006-12-06T15:20:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	for me, the nautilus burner is best
2006-12-06T15:21:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	I used to use k3b a lot, but since my last fresh install, I haven't installed it again
2006-12-06T15:21:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	k3b is the full-featured one I reckon
2006-12-08T17:27:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	if you configure the home machine via vino-preferences, there is an option to do just that
2006-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	blekos	soundray	I dont know if you have heard of Remote Administrator Prog (win) but apart from remote desktop is there any other prog so u can actually control you pc remotely (eg. if someone was sitting in front of your PC, he could actually see mouse moving)
2006-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	vnc
2006-12-08T17:31:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	with vncviewer
2006-12-08T17:31:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	vnc is cross-platform. There is even a BeOS and a Palm client
2006-12-08T17:49:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	you probably have to open the port on your router/firewall
2006-12-08T17:50:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	btw, it's not recommended to use unencrypted vnc over the internet. Look into ssh tunneling
2006-12-08T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	you can configure "Roll-Up" on title doubleclick via System-Prefs-Window...
2006-12-08T13:19:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	'sudo apt-get --purge remove packagename' (--purge removes config files along with everything else)
2006-12-08T13:19:00.000Z	soundray	blekos	check out 'man apt-get'
