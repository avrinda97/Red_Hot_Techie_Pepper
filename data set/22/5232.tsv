2007-06-26T14:56:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		Will bitorrent kill my main HD if I use it cause my third HD is dead "yes I mean DEAD" and I need to use it but Im wondering if its a good idea on my main HD?
2007-06-26T14:56:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	bittorrent shouldn't affect the drive, writing files to a drive shouldn't kill it
2007-06-26T14:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	yeah thats what I thought but the long extent of using apps like uttorent seem to have an effect on the actual HD, I think its cause of the disk caching but I could be wrong, eitherway my third HD is dead and if I try to connect it, it will stop the system from booting
2007-06-26T15:00:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	hmm, I suppose it's possible, was it an older drive?
2007-06-26T15:01:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	;-) yeha thats why I used it but formated it first and diagnosed it, but utorrent really did a number on it, also I dont think it was meant to spin for days without stopping
2007-06-26T15:05:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	I don't think bittorrent will hurt your drive, sometimes they just go out and it might have gone out anyways with or wihout utorrent
2007-06-26T15:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	you might be right but my main is precious it wont get damaged straight away but heck it has windows booted on it and ubuntu is behaving I havent damaged it (also im getting the hang of it... :-) just installed offfice 20003 yeah) so like i prefer waiting to buy a new HD as I believe thats the best choice as my second is used only for windows
2007-06-26T15:09:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	yeah, I'd probably wait until I got a second HD too. I'm just kind of suprised that a torrent program would kill a HD (never heard of it before, just harware failure is all I"ve ever heard)
2007-06-26T15:11:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	it is acually well explained online, its not the actual program but the way it uses the disk especially with the caching option also some apps froce the disk to spin faster than it should which is like over clocking
2007-06-26T15:12:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	ok, that makes sense, I guess I always use the rule of thumb not to over clock ever :D
2007-06-26T15:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	yeah my last time using utorrent on that disk I was getting speeds of 500-560 kbps which I know that disk was not meant to write that fast
2007-06-26T15:15:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	wow, I have never seen speeds that high
2007-06-26T15:15:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	the highest I think I'e seen is like 400
2007-06-26T15:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	it was one of those one offs happens like once in a very long while but once you see it go that high you just dont want to go back from 100-200kbps also my ISP is g4y (i think i cna say that in this channel)
2007-06-26T15:17:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	yeah, I don't think I would have stopped it either, just would have sat like a fish out of water
2007-06-26T15:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	thats what I thought as well, I knew that it wasnt good for the HD but just left it running now its gone :-(
2007-06-26T15:19:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	don't be sad, you get a newer bigger better HD out of it :D
2007-06-26T15:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	true but the question is when and the way Ive been lazily workign it seems I aint getting paid soon and thats just not funny >:-(
2007-06-26T15:22:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	that's true, that stupid money thing and needing it
2007-06-26T15:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	yeha the world revolves around money and I sometimes wish it was like the fairy tales that way we could all plamt money tress, hehehe, lol oh well its nice to imagine
2007-06-26T15:25:00.000Z	natbet	Pirate_Hunter	yeah, sometimes I'd like to know who decided that this shiny rock is worth your cow
2007-06-26T15:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	natbet	lol so true, i cna just imagine how it went the first time they saw it - "aite mate look its shinny, it must be precious, I'll trade it for your cow" lol
