2010-04-16T05:28:00.000Z	darkzenlord		I installed ubuntu 9.10 on a seperate HD on a partition I created, my computer boots to my XP and now I don't see the drive ubuntu installed on. any help?
2010-04-16T05:29:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	it wil be partitioned with ext, which isnt readily readable by windows
2010-04-16T05:30:00.000Z	darkzenlord	mickster04	I had two partitons on this disk, one NTFS and one was formatted EXT4 when I installed ubuntu
2010-04-16T05:32:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	yeag windows cant read ext.
2010-04-16T05:33:00.000Z	darkzenlord	mickster04	but the whole drive? and do you think ubuntu can't see my xp OS becuase it's on a raid?
2010-04-16T05:33:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	window cant see the whole drive, same on my pc, but ubuntu can read ntfs
2010-04-16T05:36:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	ta
2010-04-16T05:37:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	so tell me what doesnt matter etc?
2010-04-16T05:38:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	cos windows cant read the drive, nor can its boot loadr, grub works with both windows AND linux so use that
2010-04-16T05:39:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	you have to install it (if you install ubuntu last it works by itself)
2010-04-16T05:39:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	does grub show the ubuntu set up?
2010-04-16T05:41:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	well reinstall ubuntu, im not sure about how the raid will effect hting
2010-04-16T05:42:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	yeah, ubtunu does use drive letters
2010-04-16T05:44:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	you can tell ubuntu how you want it partitioned, you can make as many partitions as physically possible
2010-04-16T05:45:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	during the install
2010-04-16T05:46:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	thats fine
2010-04-16T05:47:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	? virtual memory? you mean swap? cos that formats as swap , neither ext or ntfs nor fat
2010-04-16T05:48:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	yeah swap will get formatted as swap so it didnt matter
2010-04-16T05:51:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	yes, remember windows will also see the ntfs partition
2010-04-16T05:51:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	LOL edfinatly not
2010-04-16T05:52:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	yeah google it an come back again:D
2010-04-16T05:53:00.000Z	mickster04	darkzenlord	good luck
