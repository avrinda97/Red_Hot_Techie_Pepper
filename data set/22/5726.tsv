2007-03-12T12:16:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	- Actually, there is *no* technical problem with getting those wmv and other items to work.  The problem is a legal one, because linux distributions are legally prevented from giving you those codecs in the United States (and some other countries).
2007-03-12T12:18:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	- uninstalling vlc is easy.
2007-03-12T12:19:00.000Z	arrozconevan	Huffalump	i tried:    sudo apt-get remove mozilla-plugin-vlc

2007-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	do you want to remove vlc entirely?  just do that.

2007-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	- use Synaptic to uninstall then
2007-03-12T12:23:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	- on your menu:  System > Administration > Synaptic
2007-03-12T12:23:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	- in Synaptic, you can install and uninstall software for Ubuntu
2007-03-12T12:25:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	yep it's quite handy often time
2007-03-12T12:26:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	- you can make life easy in Synaptic.  if you open it up, click on any item in the list... and start typing "mozilla-p..." it will automagically take you there
2007-03-12T12:26:00.000Z	Huffalump	arrozconevan	- it is easy enough to put windows out of business.  Remember how hard it is to install/uninstall thousands of software on Windows without screwing things up or getting viruses.
