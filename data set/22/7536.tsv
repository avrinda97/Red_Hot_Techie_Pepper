2008-12-17T11:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	Several
2008-12-17T11:13:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	http://paste.ubuntu.com/86835/
2008-12-17T11:15:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	I honestly see nothing wrong. When GParted is run from a terminal, it says "Can't have a partition outside the disk!"

2008-12-17T11:19:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	Old ubuntu installation. I want to reinstall it.
2008-12-17T11:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	I think it stopped recognizing my disk after Vista screwed up my partition table, though a program called TestDisk fixed it.
2008-12-17T11:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	"Manual"
2008-12-17T11:22:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	Yes
2008-12-17T11:24:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	I used sudo
2008-12-17T11:25:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	No password
2008-12-17T11:25:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	No prompt

2008-12-17T11:30:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	http://paste.ubuntu.com/86843/
2008-12-17T11:31:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	Still doesn't help me install ubuntu
2008-12-17T11:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	all right
2008-12-17T11:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	how do i format the partition?
2008-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	How do I "select to reformat"?
2008-12-17T11:36:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	Not seeing the option http://paste.ubuntu.com/86846/
2008-12-17T11:38:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	And this will NOT delete/format/screw up my other partitions, correct?
2008-12-17T11:44:00.000Z	Some_Person	n8tuser	ok, now what?
