2009-05-17T03:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	well pretty much any email client would do it, once you got the accounts set up in there
2009-05-20T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	I suggest trying Ubuntu forums
2009-05-20T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	sign up and do a thread about your card there

2009-05-20T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	try 8.04 even,  since differnet xorgs
2009-05-23T19:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	you don't have to pm
2009-05-23T19:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	I got one here,  it came with 9.04 I think
2009-05-23T19:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	or I enabled something,  or   I got it on my 8.10  to 9.04 alpha6 upgrade or something
2009-05-23T19:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	I played with it, but I don't know how to use it properly

2009-05-23T19:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	look in synaptic for one

2009-05-23T19:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	text to speech?
2009-05-23T19:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	why do you want one anyway?
2009-05-23T19:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nightdrever	Google or something if you can't find in synaptic,  might even be a compatbiel Firefox add on for this kind of thing
