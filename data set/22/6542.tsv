2006-09-26T05:56:00.000Z	hesperus		how can i disable the usplash stuff?
2006-09-26T05:57:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	you mean, the ubuntu bootsplash, so you can see the kernel messages?
2006-09-26T05:57:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	yeap, i don't want any splash at all :)
2006-09-26T05:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	it's in your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-09-26T05:58:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	kernel option?
2006-09-26T05:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	find the option where it says whether to add splash to the entries and disable it. Then run grub-update.
2006-09-26T06:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	I told you how to do it properly.
2006-09-26T06:12:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	i commented the splash word, what should i do?
2006-09-26T06:13:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	sudo: grub-update: command not found
2006-09-26T06:13:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	pastebin your menu.lst
2006-09-26T06:13:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	update-grub.
2006-09-26T06:14:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	i did it. it messed my conf again.. :/
2006-09-26T06:14:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	pastebin your menu.lst
2006-09-26T06:16:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	http://pastebin.ca/182423
2006-09-26T06:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	I'm not sure about this, because this same line is in my own menu.lst and it still doesn't make splash, but try changing line 65 to remove splash.
2006-09-26T06:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	and I can't do math either. 85.
2006-09-26T06:18:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	i know how to remove it, but every time the kernel will be upgraded, the conf will be messed again... i want to avoid that
2006-09-26T06:19:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	the options for the "Debian Automagic Kernels List" are created based on the default options you specify above. Line 85 is part of those default options. So if you remove splash from line 85, it SHOULD stop adding splash to the kernel lines when it generates them.
2006-09-26T06:21:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	here's another bug. if i remove only the splash word, everything is ok. if i remove both splash and quiet, then both these arguments are passed in the kernel!
2006-09-26T06:22:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	I haven't messed with it very much. I don't know why it does that. Maybe the evil kernel-option-passing gnomes are doing it.
2006-09-26T06:24:00.000Z	hesperus	ArrenLex	ok, i've put a space and now it seems ok =)
2006-09-26T06:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	hesperus	spaces are the saviour of us all. Hail!
