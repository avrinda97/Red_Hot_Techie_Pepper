2008-07-11T06:39:00.000Z	neil_d		I am trying to setup vnc login (number 4), I have put a line in /etc/services, and restart /etc/openbsd-inetd, now with netstat something should be listening on port 5904 ?
2008-07-11T06:40:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	yes or was it 5903 for the 4th session .. can't remember exactly
2008-07-11T06:41:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	actually, you might not see anything with netstat as you have inetd running vnc .. but you probably would see an open port if you used a port scanner
2008-07-11T06:42:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	telnet says the port is closed.
2008-07-11T06:42:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	why not use a vncviewer ?
2008-07-11T06:42:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	I did, but I wanted to check the port, so I used a simpler program.
2008-07-11T06:43:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	i understand the reasoning for using telnet .. but in my experience with inetd, telnet is not always reliable
2008-07-11T06:44:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	oh!  didn't know that
2009-01-11T16:26:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	and I am using the binary package.
2009-01-11T16:22:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	 run this first.  sudo apt-get build-dep openssh
2009-01-11T16:24:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	will the compile/install openssh ?
2009-01-11T16:24:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	 why not use the binary package?? why are you building from source?
2009-01-11T16:25:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	I want to put in some extra stuff (prints etc.) to see how it works...
2009-01-11T16:26:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	  sudo apt-get build-dep openssh # will install the dependencies needed to complete the build .. you'll have to run ./configure again
2009-01-11T16:27:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	so it wont do the compile etc.
2009-01-11T16:27:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	 apt-get source -b openssh # will - but that defeats the point of you making customizations to the source
2009-01-11T16:28:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	 thanks I will try that.
2009-01-11T16:29:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	 wow, 62 new packages.
2009-01-12T13:29:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	require??  those should cover it
2009-01-12T13:29:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	but /etc/g{shadow,passwd} might be used too
2009-05-05T07:25:00.000Z	unop	neil_d	pcb is?
2009-05-05T07:26:00.000Z	neil_d	unop	ok I will give it a try.
