2012-05-30T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	is blackcatnekonegr currently running linux?
2012-05-30T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	nevermind
2012-05-30T21:11:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	yes
2012-05-31T23:12:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	NO. Do not suggest changing the sources and doing a dist-upgrade.  That WILL break your install.
2012-05-31T23:12:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	no it won't
2012-05-31T23:13:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	i upgraded to precise that way
2012-05-31T23:13:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	Then you took a big risk.
2012-05-31T23:13:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	many times i have
2012-05-31T23:13:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	Just because it worked for you doesn't mean that it is the correct way to do it.
2012-05-31T23:13:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	it is the correct way
2012-05-31T23:14:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	normally have to upgrade apt and dpkg first but it is correct
2012-05-31T23:14:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	I asssure you, it is not. Nowhere in the ubuntu documentation does it say to do anything like that.
2012-05-31T23:14:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	ubuntu doc is dumbed down
2012-05-31T23:15:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	No, it explains the proper way to do your upgrades.  There are steps in the upgrade process that cannot be handled only by apt and dpkg.
2012-05-31T23:16:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	what are they?
2012-05-31T23:18:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	i
2012-05-31T23:19:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	i'll agree that apt is kind of evil if something goes wrong, but dpkg can fix everything
2012-05-31T23:20:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	then again neither of those are the easiest way in ubuntu
2012-05-31T23:21:00.000Z	Pici	wawowe	Heres a configuration file that that update-manager/do-release-upgrade uses.  Just looking through it can give you an idea of what sort of extra tasks those tools do: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1016826/
2012-05-31T23:23:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	doesn't give much of an idea
2012-05-31T23:23:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	has fixes for certain packages
2012-05-31T23:23:00.000Z	wawowe	Pici	but otherwise it's a normal debian upgrade
