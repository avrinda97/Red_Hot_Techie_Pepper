2007-01-24T13:20:00.000Z	octal	Hal_Horn	what's the problem?
2007-01-24T13:21:00.000Z	Hal_Horn	octal	Ever since I got Ubuntu, the only way to generate the  and  was to DOUBLE tap the pertainant key [with/out shift] . If I tap it once, the next key I press comes out, if applicable, with an accent character.  + [x]  gives umlauts (), +[x]  gives (). This isnt an issue, and is kinda cool as it lets me do mlauts. However, the  and  marks dont work when programming Python, which Iam trying to learn. I think
2007-01-24T13:23:00.000Z	octal	Hal_Horn	try AltGr + " and AltGr + '
