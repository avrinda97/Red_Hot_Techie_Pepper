2011-12-05T18:13:00.000Z	ejv		/var/log/apache2 probably
2011-12-05T18:14:00.000Z	ejv		in your apache site configs you *can* configure alternate error paths, in which case... who knows where you put them!
2011-12-05T18:16:00.000Z	ejv		you try xorg.conf?
2011-12-05T18:16:00.000Z	ejv		/etc/X11/ ?
2011-12-05T18:17:00.000Z	ejv		that's because this is the matrix
2011-12-05T18:17:00.000Z	ejv		there is no xorg.conf, realize the truth.
2011-12-05T18:19:00.000Z	ejv		color depth is slowing down your machine? now that's just odd...
2011-12-05T18:19:00.000Z	ejv		prehistoric!
2011-12-05T18:19:00.000Z	ejv		change DefaultDepth in xorg.conf is what i would do ThSenior
2011-12-05T18:20:00.000Z	ejv		or replace the laptop... they are dirt cheap on newegg...
2011-12-05T18:21:00.000Z	ThSenior	ejv	where can i find DefaultDepth?
2011-12-05T18:21:00.000Z	ejv		i have an old intel centrino laptop, 7 years old, color depth is fine on it... integrated intel graphics chipset
2011-12-05T18:21:00.000Z	ejv	ThSenior	in xorg.conf of course
2011-12-05T18:22:00.000Z	ThSenior	ejv	as I said i dont have this file...
2011-12-05T18:22:00.000Z	ThSenior		xorg.conf does not exist
2011-12-05T18:23:00.000Z	ejv		the only reason my laptop works is because ubuntu exists
2011-12-05T18:23:00.000Z	ThSenior		is 1GB of RAM enough for internet surfing Ãˆ
2011-12-05T18:23:00.000Z	ejv		windows on it is horror, mine has 512, 1G is plenty
2011-12-05T18:24:00.000Z	ThSenior		well its really slow firefox start time or chromium
2011-12-05T18:24:00.000Z	ThSenior		other apps too like wine...
2011-12-05T18:25:00.000Z	ejv		i know it's apples and oranges, but my 7 yr old laptop operates fine with stock ubuntu, under 512mb of ram, is there something else wrong? dying hard disk?
2011-12-05T18:26:00.000Z	ThSenior	ejv	HD is always slow but as I see it uses a lot of HD
