2007-09-27T07:55:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	are you looking for something specific?
2007-09-27T08:06:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	tz tz tz be nice ;)
2007-09-27T08:06:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	Do you have a program to install themes, that would be easiest
2007-09-27T08:07:00.000Z	lai	MrPink	no
2007-09-27T08:07:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	YOu don't have under: System -> Preferences -> Theme ?
2007-09-27T08:08:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	actually drag & Drop is enough
2007-09-27T08:08:00.000Z	lai	MrPink	drag and drop in tar.gz format?
2007-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	I think so, if not then extract it first... but I think it can take the tar.gz
2007-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	I think it is just another app to handel theme install
2007-09-27T08:10:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	why?
2007-09-27T08:10:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	just drag & drop it in the theme manager
2007-09-27T08:12:00.000Z	MrPink	lai	then try to extract it and drag & drop the folder... or just extract it into the ./themes folder, either one
