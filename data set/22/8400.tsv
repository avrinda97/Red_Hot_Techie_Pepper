2005-08-25T13:44:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin		how do you mount iso?
2005-08-25T13:45:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin		hmm... why does my xmms freeze ALL THE TIME?
2005-08-25T13:47:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin		ok... and last question... is there some kind of a work around for using cds for games in linux... like a virtual cd program... cd emulation or such?
2005-08-25T13:48:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	are you using cedega?
2005-08-25T13:48:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	yes I use cedega
2005-08-25T13:48:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	some cd-cracks work with cedega
2005-08-25T13:49:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	if you're farmiliar with using them in Windows...
2005-08-25T13:49:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	I don't use cd-cracks, thats not what I ment I ment a way to have the cd in without a real cd
2005-08-25T13:49:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	as in, so I can play online
2005-08-25T13:51:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	I don't understand how the CP protection would be able to function without either a real CD or a crack
2005-08-25T13:51:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	at least for BF42 and a few other games, I either have to have the cd in, or a crack
2005-08-25T13:52:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	in windows there are programs that trick your computer into thinking there are more cd drives than there realy are, then you can build virtual cd images (700mb each) and incert them into the fake cd drive
2005-08-25T13:54:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	things like daemon tools or Alcohol 120% that emulate CD protections simply don't exists in Linux as far as I know
2005-08-25T14:01:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	please explain what you're trying to do, use a NTFS volume as the game directory? Or use a shared CD-ROM?
2005-08-25T14:02:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	no, a windows computer that has the cd in shares their drive... then I mount it
2005-08-25T14:05:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	you there?
2005-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	sorry, was afk, can you mount this drive as a normal device...   sorry still not quite understanding how windows and ubuntu can share cdroms
2005-08-25T14:09:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	anyway, if you can't mount this as some sort of block device then cedega will never be able to utilize it's scu-rom (or whatever protection) hadnlers
2005-08-25T14:10:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	ok... lets say a windows comp shares his cd drive over the windows network... then it would be at smb://compname/D then mount it...
2005-08-25T14:12:00.000Z	ORiON2012	Flying-Penguin	sorry, but if the game doesn't have punkbuster, its ten times easier to just install and crack, I don't believe the copy protection will be transmitted over a network mounted filesystem
2005-08-25T14:12:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	could you find me a wc3 no cdcrack...
2005-08-25T14:13:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	ORiON2012	I will try it for you
