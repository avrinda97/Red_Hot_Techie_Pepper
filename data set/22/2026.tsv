2011-01-26T23:17:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	whats the problem.. do you have the administrator access?
2011-01-26T23:18:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	?
2011-01-26T23:18:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	do you have access to the admin account atm or no

2011-01-26T23:21:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword
2011-01-26T23:21:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	something along these lines should do the trick
2011-01-26T23:21:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	if you cant boot into grub and select recovery mode use a install cd and load up recovery mode
2011-01-26T23:22:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	does it have grub boot loader installed?? if so go to the command section and change the init lvl to recovery local mode
2011-01-26T23:22:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	also if teh grub doesnt have that the install CD will.. boot from that and enter recovery mode
2011-01-26T23:23:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	?? then a usb drive etc.. what options can you boot from?
2011-01-26T23:25:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	please start with my name.. im sorta multi tasked and when you put my name in to talk to me directly it flashs so i can click over and see what yoru response is etc..
2011-01-26T23:26:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	what is your boot options.. do you have a laptop were you can hit f12 or something to change yoru boot priority// what kind of machine are we talking about etc.. a bit more info will go a long way
2011-01-26T23:30:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	first is double check boot order and or how you can change / set order.. 2nd is make sure what ever distro cd yoru trying to boot from is compatable with teh CPU etc as that will effect hwo it boots
2011-01-26T23:31:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	does it support.... what cpu is in the machine? check in bios settings and get info of yoru cpu if you dont know it already and let me know what it is
2011-01-26T23:34:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	rgr im sure some older versions work fine.. lilo for i.e. hasnt been used in a while.. im far from a guru just saying it would be good to make sure. what version of ubuntu is on tehre currently?
2011-01-26T23:35:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	and how are your boot piority settings looking??
2011-01-26T23:37:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	humm.. well if its not booting to CD and the priority is set to CD and no others.. then only a few issues could be the problem.. disk is bad.. drive is bad.. or drive is not hooked up properly.. do you have a spare drive to test with and or acn you pull teh drive out and plug it into a ide > usb adapter and test it on a working computer?
2011-01-26T23:39:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	.. then drive would be my guess at this point.. im assuming your cd test was not just putting it in a computer to read but an actual md check or a boot test atleast etc..
2011-01-26T23:39:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	do you have another boot cd known good winblows or something you can use just to test boot ability on suspect computer?
2011-01-26T23:45:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	bingu	do you have another disk i.e. winblows or something to test with.. the key is to identify if tis a problem with your target systems settings
