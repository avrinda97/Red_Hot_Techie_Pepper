2008-06-19T12:01:00.000Z	kcormier		fglrx
2008-06-19T12:01:00.000Z	kcormier		but installed straight from the ati site
2008-06-19T12:03:00.000Z	kcormier		sorry..that wasn't supposed to send
2008-06-19T12:05:00.000Z	kcormier		glxgears works :)  So does that mean fglrx is working?
2008-06-19T12:05:00.000Z	bj_	kcormier	go peak at /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see if it has fglrx
2008-06-19T12:05:00.000Z	bj_		xorg.conf will tell you what it will load and use
2008-06-19T12:06:00.000Z	kcormier		alright! :)
2008-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	kcormier		uhh....xorg.conf doesn't say really anything much about drivers.  just configured video device : usefbdev = true
2008-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	bj_		try: fglrxinfo
2008-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	bj_		fglrxinfo should spit out something about ATI
2008-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	kcormier	bj_	what should I be looking for?
2008-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	bj_		OpenGL blah blah blah ATI Technologies...
2008-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	kcormier	bj_	it talks about mesa...does that mean it's using the mesa drivers? :-\
2008-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	bj_		yes, you want ATIs drivers, right?
2008-06-19T12:09:00.000Z	kcormier		yea...but I've been trying for 4 days....all sorts of ways.  Nothing seems to wanna work...
2008-06-19T12:09:00.000Z	bj_		when you make changes you'll need to restart your gdm...or reboot
2008-06-19T12:11:00.000Z	kcormier	bj_	I typically <ctrl> <alt> <backspace> after everything
2008-06-19T12:11:00.000Z	bj_		I don't think that restarts the gdm...
2008-06-19T12:11:00.000Z	kcormier		hmm...how do you restart gdm?
2008-06-19T12:13:00.000Z	bj_	kcormier	you can do 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart' or just reboot instead
