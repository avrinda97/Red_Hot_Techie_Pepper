2005-04-21T09:54:00.000Z	han_		hi i just installed ubuntu hoary hedgehog and tried to get my mini ipod to work. I have read the howto in the wiki but ubuntu is not detecting it and /dev/sda2 does not exist. Any ideas?
2005-04-21T09:56:00.000Z	han_		does HAL run automatically? or do i have to run it?
2005-04-21T09:56:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	unless you've been mucking around with your config, hald should start up automatically, yep
2005-04-21T09:57:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	any ideas why and ipod would not be automatically detected and added to /dev?
2005-04-21T09:58:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	no idea. are you running Warty, or Hoary, or a combination of both?
2005-04-21T10:01:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	still there?
2005-04-21T10:02:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	yes
2005-04-21T10:02:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	Ubuntu Warty, I've noticed, doesn't work all the time with some USB mass storage devices... have you tried a flashdrive or digital camera or portable HD or MP3 player in it before?
2005-04-21T10:02:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	when I upgraded to Hoary (I think it's mostly safe to by now), my MP3 flashdrive that didn't work before, magically started working.
2005-04-21T10:03:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	did not work in either
2005-04-21T10:03:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	wait... doesn't show up in /dev at all? you s hould find it by going "ls /dev/sd*"
2005-04-21T10:03:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	USB drives work on the SCSI emulation layer
2005-04-21T10:05:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	no such file
2005-04-21T10:05:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	that's really weird; do you have any other sort of USB storage device yo ucan test out?
2005-04-21T10:06:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	no
2005-04-21T10:07:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	I dunno; iPod should work straight out of the box. you're plugging it in through USB, I suppose, not FireWire?
2005-04-21T10:08:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	/var/log/messages doesnt get a new entry when its plugged in
2005-04-21T10:09:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	most definitely there's no driver there... unfortunately I don't have any experience with an iPod (except I played with the yummy scroll wheel on a friend's iPod the other day)... I wouldn't know how to get it going if it's not automatically detected.
2005-04-21T10:11:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	im thinking its the motherboard
2005-04-21T10:11:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	could be... hmmm
2005-04-21T10:12:00.000Z	pauldaoust	han_	(hope it's not, for your sake)
2005-04-21T10:12:00.000Z	han_	pauldaoust	thanks for your help. bye
