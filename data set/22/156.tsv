2012-05-20T19:08:00.000Z	Etale		I have a question: I'm getting a new laptop tomorrow, and I want to install Linux on it. At first I was thinking of Gentoo, because it's the most customizable. But I understand that to install anything on it (even firefox) takes forever. What would you recommend? Ultimately, I want something that is like Ubuntu but isn't as heavy. Should I go with a low-fat version of Ubuntu, or perhaps with
2012-05-20T19:08:00.000Z	Etale		Debian?
2012-05-20T19:08:00.000Z	Etale		I'm a noob at this point, but I have no problem learning as much as is needed. It will be fun for me.
2012-05-20T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	lubuntu is light, or install minimal then install fluxbox
2012-05-20T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	plus a few basic apps, all text based
2012-05-20T19:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	ubuntu minimal + fluxbox + slim comes in at about 1.2Gb  then you'll need a network manager app like wicd if you want to use wifi easily
2012-05-20T19:16:00.000Z	Etale	ActionParsnip	what's the difference between Ubuntu minimal and lubuntu?
2012-05-20T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	minimal is just kernel + boot loader + drivers
2012-05-20T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	lubunu adds an x server, LXDE, openbox and some applications like web browser, office productivity etc
2012-05-20T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	install ubuntu minimal then install fluxbox, its as barebomes a desktop as it goes
2012-05-20T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	did say that earlier...

2012-05-20T19:26:00.000Z	Etale	ActionParsnip	which is bigger?
2012-05-20T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	no idea, why do you care?
2012-05-20T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	not strictly
2012-05-20T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	Ubuntu could compile every app with minimal functionality, then Debian could compile the same with every feature enabled with zero optomisation. Which is better?
2012-05-20T21:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	you can run any of the ubuntus you want
2012-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	install default ubuntu and it will be fine
2012-05-20T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	Ubuntu, yuo will have enough grunt so I wouldn't worry about resources
2012-06-14T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	or ALT+K+PrintScreen
2012-07-30T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Etale	does the system have a make and model?
2012-07-30T07:42:00.000Z	Etale	ActionParsnip	Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
