2006-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	einPaule		hmm... Can anyone help me out, Im trying to get OpenOffice Base to work with either ODBC or JDBC ... Im not sure how to set them up and how to create a db on it
2006-01-25T14:56:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	I did this a while ago, following instructions I found on the web. Would it help if I found that URL for you?
2006-01-25T14:56:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	okay, two minutes.
2006-01-25T15:01:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	can't find it -- I think the page has vanished. Perhaps http://kienlein.com/pages/mysql-jdbc-howto-de.html will help, though.
2006-01-25T15:02:00.000Z	einPaule	soundray	thanks a lot!
2006-01-25T15:05:00.000Z	einPaule	soundray	it was the windows Tutorial you sent me the link to... but ive found the one for Linux in english http://kienlein.com/pages/mysql-jdbc-howto-en.html (just in case youd like to know ;-))
2006-01-25T15:05:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	thanks.
2006-01-26T15:26:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	no, you can save your /home and other data files.
2006-01-26T15:28:00.000Z	einPaule	soundray	Yeah, the data is portable of course, but take xchat, could I keep the configuration... or for example evolution setup (accounts)
2006-01-26T15:28:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	yes.
2006-01-26T15:29:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	even things you've configured system-wide in /etc/ should be salvageable.
2006-01-26T15:29:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	after all, most of those are just text files.
2006-01-26T15:30:00.000Z	einPaule	soundray	are they indifferent as to 64/32 bit enviroment?
2006-01-26T15:30:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	yes
2006-01-26T15:30:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	at least I'm not aware of any exceptions.
2006-01-27T17:00:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	I can tell you where it's documented :)
2006-01-27T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	there is a package called grub-doc. If you install this and run 'info grub', you'll eventually find step-by-step instructions for making a grub floppy.
2006-01-27T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	I'm dodging my own problems. :)
2006-01-27T17:04:00.000Z	einPaule	soundray	join a channel where people that can help you are dodging their problems ;-)
2006-01-27T17:04:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	have you got a suggestion? I need someone knowledgeable in nuclear magnetic resonance.
2006-01-27T17:05:00.000Z	einPaule	soundray	how about #ubuntu-offtopic ?
2006-01-27T17:06:00.000Z	soundray	einPaule	I've thought about it. :)
