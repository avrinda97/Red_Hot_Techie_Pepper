2008-11-01T06:04:00.000Z	meoblast001		how do i set up a user server where i create users on a server and remote login from any system on my network?
2008-11-01T06:04:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	probably create users on the ubuntu box and ssh
2008-11-01T06:04:00.000Z	meoblast001		my school has a similar system set up with Windows users with Windows machines and I want to know how to do the equivilant with Ubuntu
2008-11-01T06:04:00.000Z	meoblast001	Tom_Davis	with an X session though
2008-11-01T06:06:00.000Z	meoblast001	Tom_Davis	any ideas?
2008-11-01T06:06:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	using gui or text?
2008-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	meoblast001	Tom_Davis	i want to be able to login to a GUI gnome session
2008-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		so i login on one machine to the server and im logged in with preferences and files from the server
2008-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	from other ubuntu boxes?
2008-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		yes
2008-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		i want to basically use preferences,files, and usernames from one ubuntu box on another in X
2008-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		GNOME
2008-11-01T06:08:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	ok, I havent done this but you should be able to access the central x-server as if it was local
2008-11-01T06:08:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	thus giving you the appearance of gnome but its not running locally
2008-11-01T06:08:00.000Z	meoblast001	Tom_Davis	can i do that if im not administrator on this current machine? im doing this because my computer is broken and i want to set something up universal so i can use other computers in the house
2008-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	you will need root access for this project
2008-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	meoblast001	Tom_Davis	i dont want to run Gnome on the server
2008-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	meoblast001		and i guess im screwed... i'll just use this account ont his computer
2008-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	not so much screwed as I dont have a good answer for you, perhaps someone else can help, sorry
2008-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	meoblast001		k
2008-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	meoblast001	it appears that you are attempting roaming profiles on ubuntu, might google that
