2009-05-07T02:12:00.000Z	tones	Slart	yes, im just looking about and testing new grounds
2009-05-11T00:08:00.000Z	tones	Slart	works for me :)
2009-05-11T00:08:00.000Z	Slart	tones	mentally? or..
2009-05-11T00:08:00.000Z	tones	Slart	just wondering if im too smart for my age...

2009-05-11T00:09:00.000Z	tones	Slart	good to know :D
2009-05-11T00:32:00.000Z	Slart	tones	blastur1: Jaunty is not in beta any more
2009-05-11T00:32:00.000Z	tones	Slart	is it not? my bad
2009-05-11T00:44:00.000Z	Slart	tones	bye
2009-05-26T02:56:00.000Z	Slart	tones	I get that port as open too
2009-05-26T02:56:00.000Z	tones	Slart	thanks, i cant think what it could be
2009-05-26T02:57:00.000Z	Slart	tones	isp proxy stuff? I think I read somewhere that 1050 is used as a heartbeat port for some routers
2009-05-26T02:58:00.000Z	tones	Slart	but a minute ago, he detected it open from a loop, so it must be his system..
2009-05-26T03:00:00.000Z	Slart	tones	hmm.. why not just use iptables to drop all packets on that port?
2009-05-26T03:00:00.000Z	tones	Slart	you know me, im not superman, iv never heard of iptables
2009-05-26T03:02:00.000Z	Slart	tones	hehe.. the firewall in linux.. just setting it to drop packets on a specific port would be a one liner in a terminal..
2009-05-26T03:02:00.000Z	tones	Slart	aah. ill remember that ;)
2009-05-26T03:10:00.000Z	tones	Slart	what bob dole said, go bob dole!
