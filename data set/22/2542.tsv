2010-06-01T14:06:00.000Z	lightbricko		Anyone know if Intrepid repositories have changed lately? Like today or yesterday?
2010-06-01T14:07:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	Nope.
2010-06-01T14:08:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	And Intrepid is beyond it's end of life, so you should upgrade. :)
2010-06-01T14:09:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	I'm using an old package, "GPSBabel 1.3.5" from the Intrepid universe repo. I need it for a specific application (but I use Karmic). But today it is no longer installed, an in synaptic it is marked with red color without version numbe.r
2010-06-01T14:10:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	And since it's the first day of the month today I suspected that the repo was ended or something like that.
2010-06-01T14:10:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	My mirror logs don't show anything changing in intrepid.
2010-06-01T14:10:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	And nothing about gpsbabel.
2010-06-01T14:11:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	Ok thanks for checkting that, then the issue must have another cause.
2010-06-01T14:11:00.000Z	lightbricko		checking
2010-06-01T14:14:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	Hmm, only recent ref to gpsbabel I can find is from May 31st 17:52UTC.
2010-06-01T14:16:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	That is too new for my application. I'm using PyTrainer with my sports watch, and for some reason it only works with gpsbabel 1.3.5 from 2008. They haven't made it work with newer versions for some reason.
2010-06-01T14:16:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	And that was just the timestamp on the gpsbabel/ folder changing.
2010-06-01T14:17:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	One sec, I will try to look it up (I haven't checked the folder yet, just got the error message that 1.3.5 is needed today, and then saw that it was marked as red in synaptic and no longer having a version number)
2010-06-01T14:26:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	The following search found nothing at all, so maybe it has been uninstalled: sudo find -iname gpsbabel
2010-06-01T14:28:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	I don't know why it would uninstall itself.
2010-06-01T14:28:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	What does 'dpkg -l gpsbabel' show?
2010-06-01T14:30:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	Output is at: http://tinypaste.com/03208
2010-06-01T14:49:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	If you want to take a quick look, you can connect to my machine using VNC (It is already configured)

2010-06-01T15:03:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	The issue is now solved. I do not know why it was uninstalled, but now I managed to re-install it.
2010-06-01T15:03:00.000Z	lightbricko	jpds	Thanks for helping me on the way!
2010-06-01T15:03:00.000Z	jpds	lightbricko	No problem.
