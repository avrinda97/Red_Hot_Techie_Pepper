2008-06-15T00:07:00.000Z	matthew_		okay I'm trying to erase everything and do a fresh install of ubuntu...can I wipe the the entire disk from the live cd?
2008-06-15T00:07:00.000Z	matthew_		I mean, like, erase the whole computer windows and everything
2008-06-15T00:09:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	 just go on manual partitioning if you're using the LiveCD and delete every partition you see.
2008-06-15T00:09:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	then setup some partitions for Linux. Generally a / and a /home will do.
2008-06-15T00:10:00.000Z	matthew_		danielRM: just to clarify...I run the partitioner from the live cd then restart and click "largest continuous free space"
2008-06-15T00:10:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	no, that'll leave everything else you still have on, including Windows and... what, a borked Ubuntu? I assume you had a problem?
2008-06-15T00:11:00.000Z	matthew_	spideyman	that's what I'm going for right now
2008-06-15T00:11:00.000Z	matthew_		danielrm, no real problem, it's just windows is a memory hog and it steals space on my hard drive.
2008-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	then basically just start the LiveCD installer, get through to partitioning, and then choose manual partitioning.
2008-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	matthew_		isn't there, like, a program that I can make a boot cd that wipes the drive?
2008-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	the Ultimate Boot CD has Darik's Boot and Nuke.
2008-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	which can erase the entire drive.
2008-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	but it's easier just to wipe the partitions.
2008-06-15T00:13:00.000Z	matthew_		danielrm I just ran dban and it "ended with non-fatal errors" basically did nothing. Last time I deleted a hard disk I used window wiper or something I can't remember the name.
2008-06-15T00:13:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	odd. If you're using a LiveCD then you could just do this:
2008-06-15T00:14:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<hda/sda/whatever>
2008-06-15T00:14:00.000Z	matthew_		danielrm, i'll be honest I don't know what that means. :P
2008-06-15T00:14:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	it'll write 0s to the hard drive.
2008-06-15T00:15:00.000Z	matthew_		danielrm, am I just typing that into terminal?
2008-06-15T00:16:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	as root, yes, but also make sure that you get the right thing for of. of will typically be /dev/hda or /dev/sda; the latter is more common for laptops, the former for desktops.
2008-06-15T00:16:00.000Z	matthew_		ok thanks for the advice guys, I'm off to experiment, everythings backed up already, so no worries
2008-06-15T00:16:00.000Z	DanielRM	matthew_	OK. Good luck.
