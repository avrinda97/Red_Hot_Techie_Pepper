2010-06-27T10:27:00.000Z	evodragun		Someone knows in spanish chanel
2010-06-27T10:27:00.000Z	evodragun		Hi Soadkombucha
2010-06-27T10:28:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Spanish channel is ubuntu-es if that's what you're looking for. But what's up?
2010-06-27T10:29:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Such as?
2010-06-27T10:30:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	I don't know if you can
2010-06-27T10:31:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Maybe aMSN
2010-06-27T10:32:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Hmm. Try installing Cheese, see if your webcam is recognized
2010-06-27T10:32:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	That's odd
2010-06-27T10:39:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	We can answer.
2010-06-27T10:39:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	We may look busy, but people just help people whenever, it's not that we're really ignoring anybody.
2010-06-27T10:39:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	And it's not a problem.
2010-06-27T10:40:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Haha alright
2010-06-27T10:41:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Anytime. I'll try to help if I can, sorry I couldn't be more assistance.
2010-06-27T10:44:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	There are defraggers
2010-06-27T10:44:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	There is no registry cleaner. Ubuntu manages cleanup pretty well on its own.
2010-06-27T10:44:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	I've never defragged on linux hold on
2010-06-27T10:45:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Linux just.. It's a lot more organized and doesn't do the crazy things windows does
2010-06-27T10:47:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Trust me you don't have to it will be fast enough on its own
2010-06-27T10:48:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	You'll see what I mean. It boots a lot faster.
2010-06-27T10:48:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	You're accustomed to Windows I assume?
2010-06-27T10:49:00.000Z	soadkombucha	evodragun	Linux is completely different. The file structure is completely different, the way it manages files is different, and the speed at which it boots is much faster.
