2008-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	nicholas		Does anyone know of any equalizer programs which can run on Linux?
2008-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	audio equalizer?
2008-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	nicholas	Pelo	Just trying to make the sound coming out of my computer better.
2008-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	nicholas		Toaster: Yes, an audio equalizer.
2008-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	for the entire system, or for individual files?
2008-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	nicholas		Toaster: Any of them, it doesn't matter.
2008-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	well, there is mp3gain in Synaptic
2008-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	nicholas		It only supports MP3s?
2008-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	nicholas		Does it have a parametric equalizer as well?
2008-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	there is also normalize
2008-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	I've used both, and it's pretty straight forward.  a little scripting and time and you should have your whole library converted
2008-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	nicholas		It says package normalize is not available.
2008-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	try normalize-audio
2008-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	nicholas		Toaster: Thank you.
2008-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	nicholas		Toaster: I don't know how to use mp3gain and normalize.
2008-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	nicholas		I want an equalizer which I can control while the song is playing.
2008-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	normalize-[audio,ogg,mp3] -a DesiredTargetAmplitudeInDBFS FILE
2008-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	copy a small subset of your files to a test folder to test on before going the whole way.
2008-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	nicholas		Toaster: Could you suggest a graphical program?
2008-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	:/ sorry
2008-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	Toaster`	nicholas	I'm a bit of a cli type when it comes to this type of thing
