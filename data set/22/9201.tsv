2005-07-09T14:18:00.000Z	Madeye		smurfix, hey
2005-07-09T14:18:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	?
2005-07-09T14:18:00.000Z	Madeye	smurfix	I messaged you yesterday and sent email to you about ubuntu-ar.org.
2005-07-09T14:20:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	Yeah, sorry for the delay. Short answer: Your first stop is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeams -- there's no entry for Argentina on the list yet
2005-07-09T14:21:00.000Z	Madeye	smurfix	ar argentina? I'm talking about Arabic.
2005-07-09T14:21:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	Bah, sorry, my mistake
2005-07-09T14:21:00.000Z	Madeye	smurfix	 is it a country based or language based?
2005-07-09T14:22:00.000Z	smurfix		Mainly country-based, but there are exceptions. In your case it makes sense to add Arabic as a language though.
2005-07-09T14:23:00.000Z	smurfix		You still need a team (and an entry for it on the wiki) first
2005-07-09T14:23:00.000Z	Madeye	smurfix	Actually I was thinking to grab Arabuntu.org, but people recommends ubuntu-ar.org as its commonly used.
2005-07-09T14:24:00.000Z	Madeye	smurfix	i'm filling it right now
2005-07-09T14:24:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	.ar still is Argentina
2005-07-09T14:24:00.000Z	smurfix		and we already have registered it
2005-07-09T14:25:00.000Z	Madeye	smurfix	so what do you suggest? Arabuntu.org ?
2005-07-09T14:26:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	arabuntu would work, so would ubuntu-ara.org ("ara" is the official three-letter code for Arabic)
2005-07-09T14:27:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	Anyway, Canonical would like to be the owner of domain names like that, for trademark reasons
2005-07-09T14:28:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	plus we don't want somebody to offer their own commercial services, or worse, with them
2005-07-09T14:29:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	I'll /msg you the official address to use
2005-07-09T14:29:00.000Z	Madeye	smurfix	we are after valunteering not anything else
2005-07-09T14:29:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	I believe you
2005-07-09T14:29:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	I didn't suggest anything else
2005-07-09T14:30:00.000Z	smurfix	Madeye	Canonical still would like to be the owner-of-record. You get to control the domain yourself, as long as you don't abuse it, same as everybody else. ;-)
