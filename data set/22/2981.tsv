2009-02-02T10:34:00.000Z	Kevdog	yuri_	Do you just want a socks proxy or a VPN?
2009-02-02T10:34:00.000Z	yuri_	Kevdog	i dont know the diff. i just want to bypass filters
2009-02-02T10:34:00.000Z	Kevdog	yuri_	Want are you going to be doing?  Just to use the internet or more?

2009-02-02T10:35:00.000Z	Kevdog	yuri_	The easiest way is to set up a SOCKS5 proxy that tunnels over ssh.  Wormser has a post in the forums how to do this!
