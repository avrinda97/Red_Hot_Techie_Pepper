2009-03-08T06:08:00.000Z	mylisto		 Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2009-03-08T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	You can't use two programs that deal with packages at the same time, you apparently have something else running
2010-04-26T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	Yeah, the alternate CD (not the desktop one) or the DVD
2010-04-26T06:11:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	Certainly not fatal, it would just require you to come back and complete the upgrade manually, with the slight possibility of having a package or two you need to poke at a little afterwards
2010-04-26T06:12:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	Once 10.04 comes out (this week) you can upgrade straight from 8.04 to 10.04 (LTS to LTS), but you cant upgrade straight from 8.04 to 9.10
2010-04-26T06:14:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	I'd wait, yeah.  Can you live a week?  It's easier to upgrade once than to upgrade three/four times
2010-04-26T06:15:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	Yeah, you'll get a notification in update-manager, asking if you want to upgrade
2010-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	Did you use one of those?
2010-04-26T06:20:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	Aye
2010-04-26T06:20:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	What are you concerned with about that paragraph?
2010-04-26T06:21:00.000Z	mylisto	Flannel	I thought they meant any programs that were not supported in the rep's
2010-04-26T06:21:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	That's also a concern, yeah, what have you installed from third parties?
2010-04-26T06:22:00.000Z	Flannel	mylisto	Then I wouldn't worry about it, the upgrade process will look at those and sort them out in most cases
