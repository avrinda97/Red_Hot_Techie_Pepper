2012-02-16T12:26:00.000Z	mikeliss		So uname -a shows the kernel I'm using and /boot shows one with a higher version, and I'm currently uninstalling the one I'm running. Have a screwed up?
2012-02-16T12:26:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	why and how are you uninstalling the kernel?
2012-02-16T12:27:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	The boot partition was full of old ones...but I may have mis-calculated which I can remove. Removing it with apt-get.
2012-02-16T12:28:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	you didn't install a new one before?
2012-02-16T12:28:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Well, it's in /boot, so I suppose it's installed.
2012-02-16T12:28:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	i wouldn't count on that, check using dpkg
2012-02-16T12:29:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Dpkg shows ii next to the version higher than the one I'm removing.
2012-02-16T12:29:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Meaning it's installed, yes?
2012-02-16T12:29:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	should be good then, just run update-grub before you reboot
2012-02-16T12:30:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	that should have been run automatically already, right?
2012-02-16T12:30:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Is there a way to tell if the system is awaiting a reboot from me?
2012-02-16T12:30:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	it can't hurt to do it again
2012-02-16T12:30:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	do you have a desktop
2012-02-16T12:30:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Naw, it's a server, and I a poor admin, but I notice now that the MOTD wants a reboot.
2012-02-16T12:31:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	is it a server you can physically touch?
2012-02-16T12:31:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Nope, but I can find somebody that can....with some effort.
2012-02-16T12:32:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	then you'll want to make sure grub is good before rebooting :)
2012-02-16T12:32:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Hahaha, eff, not my finest hour...but at least /boot will have some space, I suppose. Thanks for the help.
2012-02-16T12:32:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	no problem. i've been managing servers for about a decade now
2012-02-16T12:33:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Once it comes back up from the reboot, am I safe deleting all the other old kernel bits sitting around in /boot?
2012-02-16T12:33:00.000Z	Ben64	mikeliss	apt-get should remove all those
2012-02-16T12:34:00.000Z	mikeliss	Ben64	Excellent. I'll put it to work. Thanks again.
