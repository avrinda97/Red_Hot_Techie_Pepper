2010-08-31T05:06:00.000Z	gasull		Hi.  Scripts in /etc/init.d are run at bootup, right?  It seems some of them aren't starting for me: dnsmasq, tor, polipo, etc.  How can I troubleshoot this?  thanks
2010-08-31T05:06:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	check "service'
2010-08-31T05:06:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	it's upstart which is resposible for running those scripts.
2010-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	thanks, but I'm not sure what I need to do.  Does this mean that /etc/init.d/ aren't started, or that old Sys V and Upstart coexist?
2010-08-31T05:10:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	it means that you need to configure upstart to actually start your services
2010-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	maco: I see.  Actually a lot of them aren't symlinks, and they seem to be the ones that aren't working: dnsmasq, tor, polipo, vboxdrv, hddtemp...  How do I configure upstart with them?
2010-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	maco: should I just symlink from /lib/init ?
2010-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	probably not. look at /etc/rc*.d/
2010-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	there is also a program called rc-update or the like. You mihgt be interested in looking at that.
2010-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	All the services that aren't starting are already linked in /etc/rc2.d/ : tor, polipo, dnsmasq, hddtemp and vboxdrv
2010-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	nice. now go and figure out what runlevels are and how sysvinit starts services based on the runlevel.
2010-08-31T05:26:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	I see.  Just read the Wikipedia art. re: runlevels and a linux.com art. re: Upstart and runleveles.  Ubuntu emulates runlevels using Upstart.  But still, I don't know how to make the services start on boot.
2010-08-31T05:38:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	maco: can you please help me any further?
2010-08-31T05:39:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	try symlinking /etc/init.d/tor to /etc/rc1.d/S10tor  or the like.
2010-08-31T05:39:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	no, in rcS.d/ I guess.
2010-08-31T05:39:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	but you better check sysvinit/upstart documentatino on that.
2010-08-31T05:40:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	rcS.d is for single-user mode
2010-08-31T05:41:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	uh, hm. sorry, but apparently you know what you are talking about :-) Maybe it's rc5.d..
2010-08-31T05:42:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	thanks, but rc5.d seems to be for X11 apps: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Runlevel#Typical_Linux_runlevels
2010-08-31T05:43:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	rc4.d?
2010-08-31T05:43:00.000Z	Muelli	gasull	I'm sorry. I don't know. But you can check your current runlevel with telinit or so I think. That might help you
2010-08-31T05:44:00.000Z	gasull	Muelli	No worries.   Thank you
