2005-08-05T07:53:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		Can someone help me with ndiswrapper? I'm getting there. I have the wireless card installed and it's listed as a network interface.
2005-08-05T07:53:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		But it doesn't exactly work as a network interface.
2005-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	tremblay_	Chaotic_Shield	what's the problem?
2005-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		cp <file1> <file2> <file3> <dest>
2005-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		heh.
2005-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		That's not the point ;)
2005-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield	tremblay_	read up.
2005-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		The card works, but doesn't.
2005-08-05T07:55:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		Somehow, the computer isn't going
2005-08-05T07:55:00.000Z	tremblay_	Chaotic_Shield	how does it 'work' and how does it 'not work' ? :P
2005-08-05T07:55:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield	tremblay_	it works by the fact that it is now listed as a network interface. It doesn't work in the fact that it doesn't actually do anything, except sit there and look cool.
2005-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	tremblay_	Chaotic_Shield	at least it looks cool.
2005-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		lol.
2005-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		It's builtin. That's why it looks cool.
2005-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	tremblay_	Chaotic_Shield	have you configured it in the network interface?
2005-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		yes.
2005-08-05T07:57:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		It's been given an SSID and set to use DHCP
2005-08-05T07:57:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		and the little checkmark saying "Device is configured" has been checked.
2005-08-05T07:57:00.000Z	tremblay_	Chaotic_Shield	try deactivating and reactivating it.
2005-08-05T07:57:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		This isn't my router, so I'm not going to fuck around with static IPs and such.
2005-08-05T07:57:00.000Z	tremblay_		Works for me.
2005-08-05T07:58:00.000Z	tremblay_	Chaotic_Shield	sudo ifdown wlan0 (or whatever) and sudo ifup wlan0..
