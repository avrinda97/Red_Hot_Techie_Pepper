2008-07-23T00:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		listen, how may I return to some configuration
2008-07-23T00:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		previously made, I didn't make bachups
2008-07-23T00:55:00.000Z	ubuntu		no , I'm gonna reinstall ubuntu as a last resource
2008-07-23T00:55:00.000Z	ubuntu		I don't have a clue
2008-07-23T00:56:00.000Z	ubuntu		:-$
2008-07-23T00:56:00.000Z	ubuntu		I said, I'm about to reinstall ubuntu, because I don't get a solution
2008-07-23T00:57:00.000Z	ubuntu		I went to this city to live alone, I didn't know even how to cook, and ubuntu is asking me I learn to programme and make weird things
2008-07-23T00:58:00.000Z	ubuntu		I just wanted to make a tour :-$
2008-07-23T00:59:00.000Z	ubuntu		look, I started installing programs, from tar files, you know compiling all that stuff
2008-07-23T00:59:00.000Z	ubuntu		because I wanted to install brasero, and it asked me to install another thing all the time to continue compiling
2008-07-23T01:00:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	yes, dependencies can be daunting
2008-07-23T00:58:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	what's the issue, again? before you reinstall..
2008-07-23T01:01:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	does it boot?
2008-07-23T01:03:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	how much data/configuration will you lose by reinstalling?
2008-07-23T01:04:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	yes, if you reinstall, how much do you have to install again to be where you want to be?
2008-07-23T01:04:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	how long have you had this installation?
2008-07-23T01:05:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	ok, so backup your home directory and reinstall? i wouldn't normally recommend it, but you seem to be on the verge to do it... ;)
2008-07-23T01:06:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	yes, all your firefox bookmarks, chatlogs and other configuration is in your home directory
2008-07-23T01:14:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	there is no magic fix for your problem, since no one here actually knows what you did. if you want to _fix_ your installation and not nuke it, you have to provide some information ;)
2008-07-23T01:18:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	get a usb drive and backup your home directory. pronto.
2008-07-23T01:49:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	are you the same ubuntu that thought about nuking your system a while ago?
2008-07-23T01:50:00.000Z	mgreen	ubuntu	please change your nickname
