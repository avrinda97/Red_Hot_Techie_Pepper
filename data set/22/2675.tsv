2012-07-10T21:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	No, it's not.
2012-07-10T21:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	What are you actually trying to accomplish?
2012-07-10T21:58:00.000Z	wooo	Jordan_U	i just want to know for curiosity..:)
2012-07-10T22:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	Passwords are not kept in plain text anywhere.
2012-07-10T22:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	It's not possible.
2012-07-10T22:08:00.000Z	wooo	Jordan_U	i got it its in encrypted form...but there should any way to decrypt it??
2012-07-10T22:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	It's not encrypted, it's hashed. You can't "unhash" something.
2012-07-10T22:13:00.000Z	wooo	Jordan_U	ok i got this..:)...i have one more query..i know the root password..i am able to switch on root by su root in terminal but while login when i try to get login as a root user i cant...
2012-07-10T22:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	You shouldn't have set a root password and you should never run a GUI desktop environment as root.
2012-07-10T22:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	You can't login as root from lightdm because lightdm knows that it's a terrible idea and so it (thankfully) won't let you do it.
2012-07-10T22:16:00.000Z	wooo	Jordan_U	do you mean that no can login as a root user??
2012-07-10T22:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	You should never run an entire desktop environment as root. It's possible to do, but it's entirely stupid, will break things, and has no benefit. I will not help you do it and I highly recommend that you disable the root account again (as it's disabled in Ubuntu by default).
2012-07-10T23:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	No.
2012-07-10T23:14:00.000Z	wooo	Jordan_U	is that so then what is the difference betwwen root user and normal user...as sudo only needs user password not root password???
2012-07-10T23:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	Please use only one '?'.
2012-07-10T23:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	The difference between logging in as root and using sudo is mostly a human one. If you use sudo then you are less likely to run commands which don't need root privileges as root.
2012-07-10T23:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	In your college the users created for students aren't part of the "sudo" group and thus can't use sudo.
2012-07-10T23:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	Please use only one '?'
2012-07-11T00:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wooo	I'm not at a machine with GNOME at the moment but if you search for "users" from the unity search bar you should find a control panel for adding and removing users.
