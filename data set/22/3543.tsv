2008-09-19T20:46:00.000Z	duncan-nz		I have added a new SATA HDD to my laptop. I booted first into WINXP and let it 'initialize' the disc and made a basic NTFS partition. That's fine but...
2008-09-19T20:46:00.000Z	duncan-nz		I can't see it from Ubuntu 8.04 even with 'parted' 'print -a' any ideas?
2008-09-19T20:47:00.000Z	duncan-nz		is this a windows channel?
2008-09-19T20:48:00.000Z	duncan-nz		I can't see my new SATA disc - any help out there. (I've already turned on the light and opened the curtains :-) )

2008-09-19T20:59:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	I don't understand.
2008-09-19T20:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	duncan-nz	You cant install ubuntu on ntfs
2008-09-19T21:00:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	I've already got Ubuntu!! I'm trying to access my new hardware.
2008-09-19T21:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	duncan-nz	sudo fdisk -l   lets have a look
2008-09-19T21:01:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	aha. Now I see it. /dev/sdb1, Id=7, System = HPFS/NTFS
2008-09-19T21:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	duncan-nz	can you mount manually
2008-09-19T21:02:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	I'll try again.
2008-09-19T21:03:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	no.
2008-09-19T21:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	duncan-nz	sudo mkdir /media/test                 then sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/test

2008-09-19T21:04:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	yes.
2008-09-19T21:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	duncan-nz	what error if any
2008-09-19T21:04:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	none, it just gives me a list of usage information as if I typed something wrong.
2008-09-19T21:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	duncan-nz	make sure the mount point exists and that you didnt use cap on one and not the other
2008-09-19T21:07:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Jack_Sparrow	silly me. Itried to creat a directory calle 'Storage 2' but of course I only created one called 'Storage'. All fixed now. Thanks also badfish .
