2010-06-30T02:25:00.000Z	sha1sum		Hey guys. I have a Logitech Comfort Cordless Keyboard K350, and I've tried KeyTouch and KeyTouch editor, and still some of the keys aren't recognized, including the windows key... I'm trying to make the windows key show the gnome panel, and I'd also like to get the expo, zoom in/out, and special function keys working. There used to be a command line program, and I think it was part of xorg, that would give you the hex code of keys that yo
2010-06-30T02:25:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	what's the output of xmodmap ?
2010-06-30T02:26:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	xmodmap! That's it! hold on... I'll get the codes for the keys
2010-06-30T02:27:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	you mean just the output of the command all by itself?
2010-06-30T02:27:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	yah.. using that output, you should be able to determine the META key.. OR you can use the keycode, which can be determined by using xev
2010-06-30T02:28:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	once you have it, you can setup a keybinding for the key to open the menu :o) (I don't use gnome, so I dunno where that's configured.. maybe in gconf?) .. I'm sure gnome has a nice play for defining global shortcuts
2010-06-30T02:29:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	okay do you know of a tutorial for xmodmap and getting all of this functional? I've done this before, but it was like 4-5 years ago, and I need a primer.
2010-06-30T02:30:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	primer can be found at home depot.. it's great before your final coat..
2010-06-30T02:30:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	like there's supposed to be a way that you can run a command-line command and it will just wait for keypresses then give you the output codes
2010-06-30T02:30:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	naw.. but ummmm.. really it will depend on where gnome has key bindings.. If you want.. just use xev (which will key you the keycode) and you can tie that keycode with the function you want)
2010-06-30T02:30:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	that's xev
2010-06-30T02:31:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	okay so what happens if you don't get any response from xev on a key?
2010-06-30T02:31:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	it's fun using mouse in xev to see it go all crazy too (if you're really bored at work)
2010-06-30T02:31:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	is the key broken? :)
2010-06-30T02:32:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	nope. Like I just pressed the expo key and nothing happened in xev
2010-06-30T02:32:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	is expo (not sure what that is) a meta key, that must be pressed with something else?
2010-06-30T02:32:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	the windows key, zoom in/out keys, etc. do nothing also
2010-06-30T02:33:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	actually wait a minute... xev by itself is what I should be running? because pressing letter keys while xev is running gives no output on xev but the 'n' echoes
2010-06-30T02:34:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	yah.. launch xev.. then go inside the little white box.. and start pushing buttons :)
2010-06-30T02:35:00.000Z	sha1sum	benkevan	okay I think I can take it from here. Some of the ultra-special keys aren't working, but I have a code for the windows key now, which is really all I'm worried about
2010-06-30T02:48:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	yah.. I could have told you that.. hehe.. that's the most common mapping Mod4 (or S for openbox I believe)
2010-06-30T02:49:00.000Z	benkevan	sha1sum	but isn't it so much funner figuring it out yourself?
