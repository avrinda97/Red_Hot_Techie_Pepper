2006-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	ramblingturtle		hello everybody
2006-07-08T14:14:00.000Z	ramblingturtle		after upgrading through the update manager I can't seem to access my dvdrom or cdrom and even after inserting blank media into both of the drives I am still getting the message saying no media is in device all I am trying to do is burn the ubuntu cd I have download so that I can see if installing that way fixes my problems any help would be great
2006-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	- have you tried rebooting since upgrade/
2006-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	yes i upgrading a couple weeks ago then had to leave town for awhile now I am working on my system again
2006-07-08T14:17:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	what happens when you go to places -> cd/dvd creator
2006-07-08T14:17:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	permissions are denied to both devices
2006-07-08T14:18:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	System -> Administration -> Users and Groups -> Your username -> User Privledges -> Check use CDROM drives
2006-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	that is already checked and still dosn't work
2006-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	how about cd /media/cdrom
2006-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	i can cd into directory
2006-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	the problem is that I can't burn the iso because after I put in blank media I get a mesg saying that there is no media in device or that I do not have permission for said device
2006-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	is it possible that it is the media itself?
2006-07-08T14:24:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	no because I have gone through several discs all of which are blank and have worked before but that would make this much easier if it where
2006-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	is there anyway to force a burn to disc so that way I can reinstall
2006-07-08T14:27:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	- does cdrdao scanbus   provide additional information
2006-07-08T14:28:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	also cdrdao disk-info
2006-07-08T14:29:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	when I try to run that command I get an error it seems to be trying to scan a harddrive instead of cdrom
2006-07-08T14:30:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	it may do that at first, but near the end of the input should be real data
2006-07-08T14:31:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	it did list info in the end like the device names but I am not sure what I am looking at
2006-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	when I put in blank media and run the disk-info, it immediately shows me the capacity and if the cd is empty.  When I run the same command with no disk in the drive or media that isnt blank, it then gives me a list of things its trying, such as the other harddrive
2006-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	sharms	ramblingturtle	best I can recommend at this point is boot off knoppix or a ubuntu live cd, and see if they can read your blank media and burn the dapper iso
2006-07-08T14:34:00.000Z	ramblingturtle	sharms	ok thanks I will see if I have something that will work
