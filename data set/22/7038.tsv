2006-06-08T10:03:00.000Z	Lewix		alright
2006-06-08T10:03:00.000Z	Lewix		I would like to design a website, what tools can I use?
2006-06-08T10:05:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	You might consider the program NVU
2006-06-08T10:06:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	is it better than frontpage or dreamwaver
2006-06-08T10:07:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	no, but you're asking in the Ubutu channel, so I assume you want it to run on Linux
2006-06-08T10:08:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	as far as I know, Dreamweaver is the best web IDE, though many here would probably argue that you should code by hand.
2006-06-08T10:10:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	I don't know man...I want your advise
2006-06-08T10:11:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	Are you a coder in another language?  If so, then css and html aren't too hard to pick up by hand.
2006-06-08T10:12:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	 i used to code in html but i forgot
2006-06-08T10:12:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	Otherwise, Nvu is free, runs on Linux and Windows, so there's not a high barrier to entry.
2006-06-08T10:12:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	I'll give it a try..Im a newbie with linux tough
2006-06-08T10:13:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	http://www.nvu.com/download.php
2006-06-08T10:13:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	can I see what kind of design you made with it
2006-06-08T10:14:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	I've never used it! ;)  I code by hand.
2006-06-08T10:15:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	ya let me see how it looks like
2006-06-08T10:15:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	html or xml ?
2006-06-08T10:16:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	xhtml... ;)
2006-06-08T10:16:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	lol what's the difference ?
2006-06-08T10:17:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	It conforms to the well formedness of XML, but it has the standard syntax of HTML.  Like the <body> tag.
2006-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	alright
2006-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	gmccreight	Lewix	In other words, it's easy to use a validator or parser on.
2006-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	Lewix	gmccreight	alright
