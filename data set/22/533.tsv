2012-11-19T01:35:00.000Z	Atlantic777		I'm trying to install ubuntu 12.04 but firstly I have to deal with partitions. I've got some troubles with "try me without installing". Everything seems to work until I choose that option. After that, I get just desktop and cursor.
2012-11-19T01:35:00.000Z	Atlantic777		No errors in tty, and tty is working.
2012-11-19T01:35:00.000Z	Atlantic777		What could be wrong?
2012-11-19T01:36:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	that is suppose to happen
2012-11-19T01:36:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	your trying ubuntu without installing it
2012-11-19T01:36:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	and... what are you trying to say? :)
2012-11-19T01:36:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	if you want to install ubuntu onto your system then you need to select the install option
2012-11-19T01:37:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	hey, I want gparted firstly! :D
2012-11-19T01:37:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	you need to install ubuntu
2012-11-19T01:37:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	then install gparted
2012-11-19T01:38:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	no, I'm pretty sure I don't _need_ to install it firstly. Gparted is included in the live session.
2012-11-19T01:38:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	I have troubless with starting ubuntu live sessions.
2012-11-19T01:38:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	ok so what issue are you having?
2012-11-19T01:38:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	live session wount start. I'm stuck with background and pointer.
2012-11-19T01:39:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	there may be an issue with your video driver
2012-11-19T01:39:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	do you have a nvidia card?
2012-11-19T01:40:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	no, it's a radeon card.
2012-11-19T01:40:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	i don't think that it's a kms related problem. (nomodeset and stuff)
2012-11-19T01:40:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	hmmm idk if ati has open source drivers
2012-11-19T01:41:00.000Z	danielboston26	Atlantic777	people usually have issues with nvidia because their drivers are not open source so they are not included in linux distros
2012-11-19T01:41:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	it has, the radeon dirvers. Proprietary are fglrx. But... I think that t's something other.
2012-11-19T01:41:00.000Z	Atlantic777	danielboston26	erm, nvidia has open source drivers, too. Nouveau...
