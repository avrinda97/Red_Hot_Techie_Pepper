2009-03-11T01:41:00.000Z	demon_	tehfalcon	thats good they are working i dont see any problem
2009-03-11T01:42:00.000Z	tehfalcon	demon_	the problem is that i have to put up with 20 minutes of loud noise when installing ibex
2009-03-11T01:42:00.000Z	tehfalcon	demon_	so i guess there's no fix to that :(

2009-03-11T01:43:00.000Z	demon_	tehfalcon	if you have problems with resolution or smt like that i may be able to help you
2009-03-11T01:44:00.000Z	tehfalcon	demon_	thanks for your help, but it looks that the only fix would be some headphones while installing
2009-03-11T01:45:00.000Z	demon_	tehfalcon	maybe dunno press the insert button maybe thats why you have that sound
2009-03-11T01:45:00.000Z	tehfalcon	demon_	i was afraid that it might harm the pc....
