2005-09-18T08:07:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	preview is rockin' on my iBook. :)
2005-09-18T10:33:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	i had to use nvidia's installer on breezy.
2005-09-18T10:34:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	you recompiled your kernel with gcc 3.3?
2005-09-18T10:35:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	no... you just have to use a specific gcc version for compiling the driver (or interface or whatever it is)
2005-09-18T10:35:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	can you be more specific?
2005-09-18T10:36:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	hmm.... maybe.... it was one of those late night, half asleep kinda things. :) gimme a minute.
2005-09-18T10:39:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	mind telling me how you got nvidia to work?
2005-09-18T10:39:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	i'm working on it. i promise. :)
2005-09-18T10:40:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	thanks man
2005-09-18T10:42:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	i think this is it.... before you run the installer, do a "CC=gcc-3.4" and then "export CC".
2005-09-18T10:42:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	i think that's right.
2005-09-18T10:44:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	thanks man
2005-09-18T10:44:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	anytime. :)
2005-09-18T10:44:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	which source did you get?
2005-09-18T10:45:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	i have an older card. i needed 7167
2005-09-18T10:45:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	no i mean which linux source did you get
2005-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	volvoguy	Octane	oh.... do a "uname -r" and see what kernel you're running. you have to rebuild the thing every time there's a kernel upgrade.
2005-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	Octane	volvoguy	ah crap i forgot i was booted into 2.6.10 brb
