2011-05-10T03:32:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	why not just restart the who stack....
2011-05-10T03:32:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	What?  Can you elaborate on that just a bit?
2011-05-10T03:33:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	Yea, maybe /etc/init.d/networking restart  ?
2011-05-10T03:34:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	sudo service network-manager restart   thats what he can do first
2011-05-10T03:34:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	Yea same thing.
2011-05-10T03:34:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	not all services start the same, THEY  are not all the same
2011-05-10T03:34:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	he needs to do a sudo
2011-05-10T03:42:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	thats fine, but he is new and needs to understand a few things so he can ask questions later... he may not have pastebin, as he can not access the net on that box... he would have to type it all in...
2011-05-10T03:43:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	Did you see:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/605456/  ?
2011-05-10T03:43:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	no, not yet, and i follow my process based on what he said when he came in
2011-05-10T03:44:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	i said it like 10x now, /usr/bin/sudo service network-manager restart ;  why hasnt he done that? its the first step. it will clear everything out in the stack.
2011-05-10T03:50:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	he just wants to access the net... lol.. not the details
2011-05-10T03:53:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	Keep your shirt on.  He's trying. Ok?
2011-05-10T03:55:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	is that a real command?
2011-05-10T03:56:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	do not paste frivilous commands in this room
2011-05-10T03:56:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	Yes, it's a real command.
2011-05-10T03:57:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	if real, i doubt he has that installed as default
2011-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	Yes, it is installed by default.
2011-05-10T04:00:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	I thought you were talking about iwconfig.  But no, he installed pastebinit and at that point it became a valid command.
2011-05-10T04:10:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	walk him thru wireless settings next :)
2011-05-10T04:10:00.000Z	usr13	linuxrealm	He does not have wireless.
2011-05-10T04:11:00.000Z	linuxrealm	usr13	you didnt get it when i asked him to ping and what response,,, and still he has not answered... lol
