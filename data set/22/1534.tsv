2010-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	cdose		i'm trying to get postfix installed and working.  won't accept external connections.  netstat shows *:25, nmap local shows 25 open, nmap from remote machine shows 25:filtered.  there is no firewall running, and the machine is NOT behind an ISP that is blocking port 25.  what's going on here?
2010-04-20T07:31:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	did you configure postfix to accept external or only internal mail?
2010-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	well as far as I can tell it's accepting from external, but this IS my first time setting postfix up.
2010-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	which configuration option controls this?
2010-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	the setup at the bigining in the command window is where you set that up
2010-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	red/blue screens
2010-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	dpkg-reconfigure?  yeah it's set up as "internet site"
2010-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	are you trying to send mail out to the internet as well?
2010-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	i'm just trying to set up simple virtual domain mail forwarding.  but i've already tested a local telnet and sent mail out succesfully
2010-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	tcpdump is not shoing any traffic coming in on port 25.  it's got to be my local ISP filtering outgoing port 25 traffic
2010-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	which is really annoying.
2010-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	many other mail providers will block you or not deliver to you since you are not registered as a mail server - hotmail is notorious for this
2010-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	what exactly do you mean by "registered"?
2010-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	im assuming you have a domain name registered pointing back to your machine?
2010-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	yes I do, and reverse DNS matches as well
2010-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	it can take a day or two to get all the way around the interwebs if you just set up your mx
2010-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	right, i'm ok with waiting for that, but what currently isn't working is just the telnet in from outside... if that's just my local ISP, then i may not actually have any problems
2010-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	very well could be
2010-04-20T07:41:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	you usually have to go into master.cf and check the first smtp line - usually allows unless you put 127: infront
2010-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	pdbogen, thanks a lot guys
2010-04-20T07:44:00.000Z	digitalslave	cdose	no problem... pretty much works out of the box but there are many cool things you can do - in the end i just hosted my mail with google because of the occasional mail block :( if only anyone could put up a mail server
2010-04-20T07:45:00.000Z	cdose	digitalslave	yeah no kidding.  i use google apps to for most things.  I just wanted an easy alternative for clients that just want a single email address at their domain, rather than having to set up an entire google apps account for that
