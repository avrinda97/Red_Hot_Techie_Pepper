2011-07-20T04:25:00.000Z	jen		err let me see, how do I do that?
2011-07-20T04:25:00.000Z	leccy	jen	use whatever os you're happiest with and what works for you - linux isn't compulsory... :)
2011-07-20T04:40:00.000Z	leccy	jen	is this a fresh install? if yes, and your sound was working before, then a reinstall would be quicker at this point imo
2011-07-20T04:53:00.000Z	leccy	jen	does youtube vid give sound?
2011-07-20T04:54:00.000Z	leccy	jen	i've had issues before where youtube plays, but banshee or whatever doesnt
2011-07-20T04:59:00.000Z	leccy	jen	are you running off a livecd or is this a full install or dual-boot?
2011-07-20T05:03:00.000Z	leccy	jen	i went through soundcard hell with mandriva a few years ago, i decided that if I spend longer then 4 hours on a sound or graphics issue then it's time to reinstall or distrohop
2011-07-20T05:11:00.000Z	leccy	jen	create a 10.04 live cd, boot from it, and see if sound works. if yes, then install 10.04
2011-07-20T05:12:00.000Z	leccy	jen	reinstalling isn't any more complex than the bunch of sudo commands you've been typing all night lol
2011-07-20T05:13:00.000Z	leccy	jen	and booting from a livecd is safe, you can't mess anything up
2011-07-20T05:27:00.000Z	leccy	jen	one big file called an iso - you burn it to a cd, and then the cd contains the whole of ubuntu. then you reboot - but from the cd, not your hard disk, and it'll start up ubuntu, running from the cd
2011-07-20T05:29:00.000Z	leccy	jen	- don't just copy the file onto the CD - you have to burn it as an iso - there's an option i your cd burning sw for that
2011-07-20T05:32:00.000Z	leccy	jen	nothing, we were laughing at something else
