2010-09-19T16:16:00.000Z	jouyt	aeon-ltd	yep
2010-09-19T16:16:00.000Z	jouyt		i want to make my laptop accesible from everywhere
2010-09-19T16:16:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jouyt	err, it just happens?, i'm not sure about ubuntu but i think udev handles it
2010-09-19T16:17:00.000Z	jouyt		redirecting a port from outside to my computer in every site i connect
2010-09-19T16:17:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jouyt	wait please explain more, cos i don't think you mean upnp
2010-09-19T16:17:00.000Z	jouyt		i thought it was upnp,-.- ok,
2010-09-19T16:17:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jouyt	i think you mean vpn
2010-09-19T16:18:00.000Z	aeon-ltd		!vpn | jouyt
2010-09-19T16:18:00.000Z	jouyt		it is not vpn
2010-09-19T16:18:00.000Z	jouyt		i think
2010-09-19T16:18:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jouyt	are you sure, cos you described routing connections through your laptop?, that could be VPN or SSH tunneling
2010-09-19T16:19:00.000Z	jouyt		what i want, is to always make my laptop accesible by opening a port direct from the internet to my computer
2010-09-19T16:19:00.000Z	jouyt		anywhere i am connected to
2010-09-19T16:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jouyt	you mean to control your laptop from anywhere theres internet?
2010-09-19T16:20:00.000Z	jouyt		without connecting to anywhere
2010-09-19T16:20:00.000Z	jouyt	aeon-ltd	yep
2010-09-19T16:20:00.000Z	aeon-ltd		!vnc | jouyt
2010-09-19T16:20:00.000Z	jouyt		but for that, the laptop must login somewhere
2010-09-19T16:21:00.000Z	jouyt		and what i want, is as i do at home, i open port 22 and accept incomming connections
2010-09-19T16:21:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jouyt	thats ssh
