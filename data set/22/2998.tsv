2009-05-06T23:31:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	how do u use wireshark for that?
2011-01-14T07:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	maybe try another mirror site for your repository
2011-01-14T07:27:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 how do I set that?
2011-01-14T07:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	in synaptic?
2011-01-14T07:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	I found a good example how to change repository mirror in synaptic https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu
2011-01-14T07:49:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 hmm I do not have that software sources in my menus
2011-01-14T07:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	what software source is that?  synaptic?
2011-01-14T07:50:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 the one in the picture on the link you sent : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu
2011-01-14T07:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	I'm not sure what your looking for,  that may be looking at a picture of an older version of synaptic
2011-01-14T07:52:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/partner/binary-amd64/Packages.bz  <= NOT FOUND and that is the main server
2011-01-14T07:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	there are many servers
2011-01-14T07:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	pick another one
2011-01-14T07:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	try japan it works good when usa is backing up stuf
2011-01-14T07:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	are you on a server with no synaptic?  no gui?
2011-01-14T07:59:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 hmm looks like it may be an issue with privoxy blocking something
2011-01-14T08:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	privoxy?  I'll have to look that up
2011-01-14T08:00:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 it is a webpage filter / blocker of ads
2011-01-14T08:00:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 I squid + dansguardian + privoxy
2011-01-14T08:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	don't know why it would be configured to filter a ubuntu site
2011-01-14T08:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	hanasaki	maybe that list of theres is configured for windows and microsoft wouldn't want us to be able to see our update servers now would they
2011-01-14T08:09:00.000Z	hanasaki	sacarlson	 haha ;)
