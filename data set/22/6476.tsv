2007-03-03T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	is that a real channel ?
2007-03-03T12:48:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	yea
2007-03-05T10:04:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	if its in the correct format the theme manager should pick it up
2009-02-01T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	you don't sudo su
2009-02-01T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	thats not the ubuntu security model
2009-02-01T00:02:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	usser i have just changed my root password again and when i sudo su or just su it still gives me that message
2009-02-01T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	you should not have set a root password
2010-11-09T02:37:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	it is
2010-11-09T02:37:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	i can't seem to install it?
2010-11-09T02:38:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	ok, so does it show up in apt-cache search openssh-server
2010-11-09T02:38:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	nope
2010-11-09T02:38:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	ok, what happens when you do "sudo apt-get update"
2010-11-09T02:39:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	i get lots of cannot initiate connection to 3128:80 errors
2010-11-09T02:39:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	i am using a proxy
2010-11-09T02:39:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	that's why there is a problem, your connection to the repos is broken
2010-11-09T02:40:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	do I set proxy in env using http_proxy variable? is that sufficient?
2010-11-09T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	depends on the proxy type, but normally yes
2010-11-09T02:42:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	its strange i can ping us.archive.ubuntu.com and telnet us.archive.ubuntu.com 80 but when I run apt-get update it says connection error.
2010-11-09T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	ping and telnet are not http protocols, so they won't go out of http_proxy
2010-11-09T02:45:00.000Z	dtolj	ikonia	any alternative tools you know off?
2010-11-09T02:45:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	should be a need for alternative tools
2010-11-09T02:45:00.000Z	ikonia	dtolj	it looks like the http proxy your using isn't working or requires more configuration than just http_proxy
