2009-12-23T05:27:00.000Z	alvareClrnD		hi, does anyone know how to tell the filesystem to avoid/skip readwriting on an specific sector/block?
2009-12-23T05:29:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	what filesystem?
2009-12-23T05:30:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	I assume the sector is bad, have you run fsck on it?
2009-12-23T05:32:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	as a short term, temporary workaround, you could just use dd to fill the sector with zero bit data (pad)
2009-12-23T05:33:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	just trying to access the sector makes the disk freeze
2009-12-23T05:35:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	you might also read 'man badblocks'
2009-12-23T05:35:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	 no use, already tried that too, the sector is broken physicaly
2009-12-23T05:36:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	are you trying to save data, or work around a defective drive?
2009-12-23T05:37:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	I'm trying to live, but a random day in the week a random program reads a random file thats on a broken sector, and the PC freezes until I kill that job
2009-12-23T05:38:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	I know you don't like the advice given, but trust us, replacing the drive is your best option.  Everything else is just a workaround
2009-12-23T05:39:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	then I'll workaround, I live in argentina, $150 is a lot of money here
2009-12-23T05:39:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	thanks for your time, now I'll proceed to read the filesystem kernel code
2009-12-23T05:39:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	just so you know, it's only going to get worse.
2009-12-23T05:40:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	usually the coating on the drive gets damaged, and then it gets spread by the heads.
2009-12-23T05:40:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	it's not like a old hardisk that fail naturally
2009-12-23T05:41:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	again, the best thing I can give you is to mark them as badblocks, or pad the sector with zeros.  Even if it takes forever
2009-12-23T05:41:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	this drives come failing, and seagate denies it and erases threads that discuss this, so it's their fault, but it's still usable, I just have like 5-7 broken sectors
2009-12-23T05:41:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	how would I mark them as badblocks without using "badblock" ?
2009-12-23T05:42:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	I believe you, sometimes you just have to keep fighting with these companies to get it fixed.
2009-12-23T05:42:00.000Z	Solorvox	alvareClrnD	man badblocks, it talks about not using write (-w) but I think you may want to in this case
2009-12-23T05:43:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	yeah I said without using badblocks cause its slow as hell and its a 1TB hardisk
2009-12-23T05:45:00.000Z	alvareClrnD	Solorvox	thanks, bye
