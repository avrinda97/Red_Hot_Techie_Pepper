2008-10-12T02:28:00.000Z	[T]ank		ok, so i installed the restricted driver from the system menu for my nvidia graphics card. worked great. had it all set up how i wanted.
2008-10-12T02:29:00.000Z	[T]ank		then, for giggles, i installed the latest driver from the nvidia site, now I cannot get it to work right.
2008-10-12T02:29:00.000Z	[T]ank		everything is in low res
2008-10-12T02:29:00.000Z	[T]ank		i just copied my good xorg.conf into place, but it does not like it
2008-10-12T02:29:00.000Z	[T]ank		where did i screw up?
2008-10-12T02:30:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	when compiling a driver from nvidia's site, you should be awared that if you'd perform kernel upgrades, you will end up in text mode after reboot and you'd need to rebuild it again
2008-10-12T02:31:00.000Z	[T]ank	compengi	I did not understand what you just told me.
2008-10-12T02:31:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	the driver that you are talking about
2008-10-12T02:32:00.000Z	[T]ank	compengi	how do i rebuild the driver? I just installed what I downloaded
2008-10-12T02:33:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	did you follow the steps on how to install it?
2008-10-12T02:34:00.000Z	[T]ank	compengi	Is there more than just running the installer? new to ubuntu... everywhere else you just install it and configure your xorg.conf
2008-10-12T02:35:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	last time i compiled an nvidia driver, there was loads of things to do
2008-10-12T02:36:00.000Z	[T]ank	compengi	where can i find instructions on ubuntu install then... cuz everywhere else all i have had to do is run the installer then configure the xorg

2008-10-12T02:40:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	and this link is for how to edit your xorg.conf http://nvidia.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/nvidia.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=137&p_created=1099952988&p_sid=7n_Gt5gj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MzIsMzImcF9wcm9kcz0wJnBfY2F0cz0wJnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9JnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9YW5zd2Vycy5zZWFyY2hfbmwmcF9wYWdlPTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD1saW51eCBkcml2ZXI*&p_li=&p_topview=1
2008-10-12T02:42:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	after sh file.run i still remember you reboot and then follow steps to install
2008-10-12T02:42:00.000Z	[T]ank	compengi	I have a working xorg.conf... it just does not work with the my latest installation
2008-10-13T21:04:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	you don't need all those guides.
2008-10-13T21:07:00.000Z	[T]ank	compengi	I have it all figured out except for how to get windows installed ;-) I know this is not the place for that. It looks like an issue with my sata drive. xp does not recognize it.
2008-10-13T21:16:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	i didn't get how you can't get vista get installed and trying to make the grub boot the uninstalled vista
2008-10-13T21:16:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	i mean X{
2008-10-13T21:17:00.000Z	compengi	[T]ank	if you got sata drive no being detected, i would assume you are running a mercury via chipset mainboard
