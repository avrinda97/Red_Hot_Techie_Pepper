2007-04-26T13:36:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	just keep going through it until you reach the point where you get to choose resolutions.

2008-03-01T20:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-03-01T20:46:00.000Z	zero_	PriceChild	7.10
2008-03-01T20:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	please pastebin the output of lspci
2008-03-01T20:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	I meant that.
2008-03-01T20:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	so where is it telling you 810?
2008-03-01T20:52:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	That's odd... You can change it to the 'intel' experimental driver if you want? But i810 should work pretty fine.
2008-03-01T20:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	you're spelling my name wrong ;)
2008-03-01T20:54:00.000Z	zero_	PriceChild	hehe oki
2008-03-01T20:54:00.000Z	PriceChild	zero_	why is i810 not good enough? "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" ?
2008-03-01T20:55:00.000Z	zero_	PriceChild	well the glxinfo | grep rendering returns true
