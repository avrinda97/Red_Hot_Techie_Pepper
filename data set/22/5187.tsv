2007-06-28T11:06:00.000Z	stu-mc		Q: ive added a ntfs hdd to my linux box (to share files form keeping the ntfs FS) would this cause ubuntu to have issues loading ?
2007-06-28T11:07:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	stu-mc	i dont think so
2007-06-28T11:08:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	stu-mc	a lot of users have more then one HD and more than one FS
2007-06-28T11:08:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		sudo reboot works too
2007-06-28T11:08:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		ye
2007-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		!paste
2007-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	stu-mc	B_166-ER-X	its getting to where i would expect a gui to be, orange bar goes to end screen flickers then blank screen, i cant ssh into it either
2007-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	stu-mc	B_166-ER-X	local k/b doe snot respond either
2007-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	stu-mc	 hm, might have srewed the MBR (maybe there was one on the new HD ? )
2007-06-28T11:11:00.000Z	stu-mc	B_166-ER-X	their would have been but as it got past grub i wouldn't have thought it would cause an effect now
2007-06-28T11:11:00.000Z	stu-mc		at this point*
2007-06-28T11:11:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	stu-mc	 true.   hm, maybe a Fschk on the new HD ?
2007-06-28T11:12:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		er.   fsck
2007-06-28T11:12:00.000Z	stu-mc	B_166-ER-X	i dont have another machine to check the hdd on, ill remove it and see if i can get back in to ubuntu
2007-06-28T11:13:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	stu-mc	 you could try to log in Live CD ?
2007-06-28T11:13:00.000Z	stu-mc	B_166-ER-X	good point. ill do that first
2007-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	stu-mc	B_166-ER-X	as i have the box next ot me i removed hdd and it worked, gonna rty to re add it and hope if not live-cd next
