2008-09-03T17:56:00.000Z	luckydeveloper		hi... anyone got any idea about gtk+ programming in ubuntu
2008-09-03T17:57:00.000Z	luckydeveloper		hey... whenever i try to compile my gtk+ program.. i get the error  "gtk/gtk.h  no such directory or file"
2008-09-03T17:58:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	install libgtk2-dev
2008-09-03T17:59:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	i have done that..but still the error comes
2008-09-03T17:59:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	maybe some other devpackage?
2008-09-03T18:02:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	can you help me ?
2008-09-03T18:04:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	what kind of program do you try to compile?
2008-09-03T18:06:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	i want to compile a simple gtk+ program
2008-09-03T18:07:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	I think you need libgtk2.0-dev, if you're using gtk+ you need the corresponding gtk+[something]-dev
2008-09-03T18:08:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	i have downloaded and installed them... still the error gives me  " gtk/gtk.h" no such file or directory
2008-09-03T18:20:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	You can run GTK-Apps in KDE, you just need the libraries
2008-09-03T18:20:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	with ldd [programname] you can check, which libraries you have and which ones you need
2008-09-03T18:21:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	thats all? ...what about performance of the app built in gtk+...? will there be any problem ?
2008-09-03T18:22:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	gtk talks to the X-server, so it doesn't care whether KDE or gnome is running
2008-09-03T18:23:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	The only thing that could get tricky are things like trayicons
2008-09-03T18:24:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	i am actually gonna build a gtk+ app in kubuntu in my home and i am gonna implement it in my college which has ubuntu(gnome).. i know it talks to X server but since its my formal project.. will there be any risks
2008-09-03T18:24:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	what's the problem with tray icons
2008-09-03T18:26:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	if I recall right gnome and kde had different ways of setting these icons, but I haven't done much guiprogramming in the past time
2008-09-03T18:27:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	but since pidgin worked fine with xfce I'm assuming that it will run flawless
2008-09-03T18:28:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	I haven't tried yet but it worked fine with my trekstor
2008-09-03T18:29:00.000Z	luckydeveloper	itsmrt	thanks
2008-09-03T18:34:00.000Z	itsmrt	luckydeveloper	I use xfce, as it is very lightweight and leaves much space for other windows
