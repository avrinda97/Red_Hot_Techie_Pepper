2009-03-04T04:15:00.000Z	eTranquility		Hi, Synaptic can't seem to connect to the internet, so I can't get updates or install through it. It shows download rate as unknown. It was recently working fine but I'm not sure what triggered this. Possibly related is Gnome Do's inability to post tweets, which also previously worked. I can use Firefox and Pidgin with no problems. How do I rectify the situation?
2009-03-04T04:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	you should try changing your mirror, this might help www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-select-fastest-mirror-in-ubuntu.html
2009-03-08T12:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	are you able to "ping" an internet site currently?
2009-03-08T12:37:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	Yes, ping works.
2009-03-08T12:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	other then apt-get what other programs are NOT working?
2009-03-08T12:40:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	Boxee stopped working, can't install firefox plugins (apt-get, I think?), not sure what else to test. The little weather applet that comes with ubuntu that's on my toolbar works, if that's any help?
2009-03-08T12:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	so IRC/Firefox/weather applet ARE working, but Boxee and apt-get aren't???
2009-03-08T12:42:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	That is correct.
2009-03-08T12:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	I doubt it's a DNS issue if you can browse the web with Firefox.
2009-03-08T12:45:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	If it helps, I use a proxy when at school (I'm not now) but I change the settings ONLY in Firefox.
2009-03-08T12:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	THAT's the problem!
2009-03-08T12:46:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	I've always just changed it back to not using a proxy in Firefox. Did I break something?
2009-03-08T12:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	no but if your network is setup to use a proxy, your change in Firefox ONLY affects Firefox, non of the other apps, which are still trying to go through the proxy
2009-03-08T12:48:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	Right, but I've only changed Firefox settings, I didn't do it through System-> Prefs -> Network Proxy
2009-03-08T12:49:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	Anyways, if changing Firefox settings has somehow affected my systemwide settings, how do I change it to not using a proxy? Network Proxy shows no proxy being used.
2009-03-08T12:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	yup - so Firefox works, apt/boxee won't...  if you disable the proxy in network settins it will let everything talk to the internet (without a non-existing proxy getting in the way)
2009-03-08T12:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	ummm???
2009-03-08T12:53:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	apt-get and boxee stopped working around the time I started connecting to my school network (with the proxy) but I've usually been able to just change the connection settings in Firefox back to not using a proxy (since I've always only changed them to using a proxy in Firefox)). Proxy settings may or may not be related to my problem. >.<;;;
2009-03-08T12:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	did you say the apt-get has NEVER worked?
2009-03-08T12:55:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	It did work before.
2009-03-08T12:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	eTranquility	sorry man, it's 5AM where I am and I'm off to bed.  Good luck man.  Night all.
2009-03-08T12:57:00.000Z	eTranquility	ZykoticK9	Thanks anyways. =/
