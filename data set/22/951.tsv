2010-12-30T16:06:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	i wish i can remember it was long ago
2010-12-30T16:07:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	hmm how do you run it? command in terminal?
2010-12-30T16:07:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	adb
2010-12-30T16:09:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	any ideas?
2010-12-30T16:09:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	hmm did you install it from source?
2010-12-30T16:10:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	i just might have.. it was gz tar
2010-12-30T16:11:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	yes tar.gz are source archives... did you leave the diretory after compiling? if you did, cd to it in a terminal and run sudo make uninstall or sudo make remove
2010-12-30T16:11:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	thanks
2010-12-30T16:11:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	no problem
2010-12-30T16:13:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	says no rules for either :(
2010-12-30T16:14:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	did you reextract the archive?
2010-12-30T16:15:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	no it should be as it was when you compiled
2010-12-30T16:21:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	are you there?
2010-12-30T16:21:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	did you find the makefile?
2010-12-30T16:21:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	yes... sorry not having any luck
2010-12-30T16:21:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	hmm try remaking
2010-12-30T16:21:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	no make file in sight
2010-12-30T16:23:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	i highly doubt it, but if you redo the make file generation, you might be able to uninstall
2010-12-30T16:23:00.000Z	jack87__	rs0832	thanks.. i will try.
2010-12-30T16:23:00.000Z	rs0832	jack87__	good luck
