2007-04-21T12:54:00.000Z	aatdark	echnaton	acpi is kind of proprietr. on my windows it is working too
2007-04-21T12:55:00.000Z	aatdark	echnaton	its all because the device vendors lack drivers..
2007-04-21T12:58:00.000Z	aatdark	echnaton	you can try the kernel mailling list
2007-04-21T12:58:00.000Z	echnaton	aatdark	hm. thought there are  already some hints for that
2007-04-21T12:59:00.000Z	aatdark	echnaton	for what some hints ?
