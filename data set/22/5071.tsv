2007-07-31T13:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ritzcracker	do *not* tell people how to set a root password.
2007-07-31T14:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ritzcracker	because it is against ubuntu policy/rules, and generally, it tends to break things rather than fix it.

2007-07-31T15:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ritzcracker	I have no idea what is going on there, but that is not a dual screen setup. Read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XineramaHowTo?highlight=%28Xinerama%29#head-293c9ec6c621bad38a16cfc937e194152d875966
