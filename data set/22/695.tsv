2011-05-07T07:29:00.000Z	sje		how do you rename files recursively?  Please SIMPLE solutions only.
2011-05-07T07:30:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	with... rename
2011-05-07T07:30:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	man rename
2011-05-07T07:31:00.000Z	sje	abstrakt	rename doesn't have a recursive option
2011-05-07T07:31:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	find .... -exec rename ....
2011-05-07T07:31:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	find is your friend :)
2011-05-07T07:31:00.000Z	sje	abstrakt	so I go to the directory, and do
2011-05-07T07:32:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	probably useful to read up on find -exec
2011-05-07T07:33:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	so modify it to have a recursive option
2011-05-07T07:33:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	it is, after all, open source, you can simply contribute a patch to the open source community
2011-05-07T07:33:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	did you see my message?
2011-05-07T07:33:00.000Z	sje	abstrakt	I don't know how to program
2011-05-07T07:34:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	well, i know people who taught themselves to program when they were 35
2011-05-07T07:34:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	so... i don't really know what to tell ya, maybe you should use something like Mac OS
2011-05-07T07:34:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	did you not see my msg?
2011-05-07T07:35:00.000Z	sje	abstrakt	yes I got your message.  Don't be an elitistdouche
2011-05-07T07:35:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	wow dude, ok then nevermind
2011-05-07T07:35:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	dude, keep it, i don't want none, if you're gonna snap and get all krunk lol
2011-05-07T07:36:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	well apparently reading the very straightforward tutorial i linked you to was far too difficult
2011-05-07T07:37:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	if you're gonna complain after i give you a link to a tutorial that explains this in painfully simple and user friendly terms
2011-05-07T07:37:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	that it's not simple and easy to understand? lol wtf
2011-05-07T07:37:00.000Z	abstrakt	sje	get out bro don't come at me with that garbage, stop whining and strap on a pair
