2005-12-31T15:05:00.000Z	aris	nsasch	what's the existing distro ?
2005-12-31T15:05:00.000Z	aris	nsasch	is your computer really old ?
2005-12-31T15:05:00.000Z	nsasch	aris	Fedora Core, it's a server hosted far from me.
2005-12-31T15:06:00.000Z	aris		ouch
2005-12-31T15:06:00.000Z	aris	nsasch	i wouldn't do that without physical access
2005-12-31T15:06:00.000Z	nsasch		Why do you think I want to replace it?
2005-12-31T15:06:00.000Z	nsasch	aris	I have no choice :/
2005-12-31T15:06:00.000Z	aris		you do at least have a serial console ?
2005-12-31T15:06:00.000Z	nsasch		I have KVM over IP access, so I can change BIOS and such, but there's no CD or floppy drive installed.
2005-12-31T15:07:00.000Z	aris	nsasch	hmm
2005-12-31T15:07:00.000Z	aris		you do have more than one partition ?
2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	aris		if you're going to install on top of your FC, it's not going to be easy
2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	nsasch	aris	Yes, I have a 2GB partition at /dev/hda1 that I can use.  After installing their, I'd install to /dev/hda2
2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	aris		ah
2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	aris	nsasch	you can try to install ubuntu server on a local vmware/qemu
2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	aris		and copy the disk image to your server
2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	aris		it's a power user (tm) operation
2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	nsasch		Coincidentally, I did that already :-P but it's a 5GB image for UML.
2005-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	aris	nsasch	what's the problem ?
2005-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	aris		2gb should be enough for ubuntu server
2005-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	nsasch		I was just hoping there'd be a better solution.
2005-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	nsasch	aris	Thank you much.
