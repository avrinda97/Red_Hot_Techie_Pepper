2010-11-08T12:42:00.000Z	hardwarebum	neww	gogeta1 may be right, if you do not have a router after cable modem.
2010-11-08T12:42:00.000Z	hardwarebum	neww	some cable providers require to call in new MAC address as well.
2010-11-08T12:48:00.000Z	hardwarebum	neww	u have stuf from ipconfig -a and lspci?
2010-11-08T12:59:00.000Z	hardwarebum	neww	from ifconfig -a is there an eth0?

2010-11-08T13:04:00.000Z	hardwarebum	neww	ok, do an ifconfig -a eth0 on that one.
2010-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	neww	hardwarebum	same thing as before, no inet info there but have ethernet hardware ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
2010-11-08T13:06:00.000Z	hardwarebum	neww	so you are on a computer with no IP address but on the internet.
