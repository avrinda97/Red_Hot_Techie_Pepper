2007-06-13T10:02:00.000Z	boghog		hi
2007-06-13T10:02:00.000Z	boghog		I can't adjust my time, I change it, click close, and then it is still unchanged
2007-06-13T10:02:00.000Z	boghog		how to fix?
2007-06-13T10:02:00.000Z	boghog		this is so annoying
2007-06-13T10:03:00.000Z	boghog		all these little things in ubuntu not working
2007-06-13T10:03:00.000Z	boghog		I can't adjust the system time :(
2007-06-13T10:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	so "one thing", not "all these things"?
2007-06-13T10:04:00.000Z	boghog		it says it is 20:03 CEST evenafter I change it to 18:03 by right clicking on the time panel applet
2007-06-13T10:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	is the timezone set correctly?
2007-06-13T10:05:00.000Z	boghog	gordonjcp	 yeah it's set to CEST
2007-06-13T10:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp		and you're in CEST?
2007-06-13T10:05:00.000Z	boghog		yes
2007-06-13T10:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2007-06-13T10:06:00.000Z	boghog	gordonjcp	7.04
2007-06-13T10:07:00.000Z	boghog	gordonjcp	oh it looks like it suddenly updated the time now
2007-06-13T10:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	ok, so you're set to Europe/Amsterdam?
2007-06-13T10:07:00.000Z	boghog	gordonjcp	it is weird because when I looked right after changing it it was still saying the old un-adjusted time, but I guess it takes a while beforei t updates or something
2007-06-13T10:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	possibly
2007-06-13T10:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	maybe it only updates once a minute?
2007-06-13T10:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	aha - select "show seconds" in preferences and it updates once a second ;-)
2007-06-13T10:08:00.000Z	boghog	gordonjcp	ahhh, ok that explains it hehe
2007-06-13T10:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	boghog	there should probably be something that forces an update when you close the window
