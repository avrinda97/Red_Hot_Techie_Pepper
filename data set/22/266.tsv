2012-03-06T04:46:00.000Z	terran4000		Hey all. Random odd thing that more or less happened recently: my sound 'died'. Alsamixer, and lspci and aplay -l all show my card just fine, just that the Ubuntu sound settings show zero hardware, just a blank 'hardware' tab. Any ideas?
2012-03-06T04:47:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	also, have you checked for updates / upgraded recently?
2012-03-06T04:48:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	I did some updates recently, though none of them seemed to have anything to do with Alsa nor the kernel ... (I think)
2012-03-06T04:48:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	well, it is more probable that an update caused it than it occured on its own
2012-03-06T04:49:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	try running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-03-06T04:50:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	only flash and nautilus to upgrade
2012-03-06T04:50:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	hm... what kind of device are you using? onboard or pci?
2012-03-06T04:51:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	pcie
2012-03-06T04:51:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	aplay -l
2012-03-06T04:53:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	"card 1: XFi [Creative X-Fi], device 0: ctxfi [Front/WaveIn]" and others like it
2012-03-06T04:53:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	On a side note, I've had that card working flawlessly for the past several months
2012-03-06T04:53:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	ok, so kernel notices it... Do you have kernel modules loaded for it (does it require?)
2012-03-06T04:54:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	the only thing I noticed was this: $ pulseaudio                                                                                                                                                                           (03-05 18:50)
2012-03-06T04:54:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	which I'm currently trying to figure out cause I guess that might and would be the issue ...
2012-03-06T04:55:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	of course, you could try reinstalling pulseaudio
2012-03-06T04:55:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	installing stuff I know, but how do I reinstall a package?
2012-03-06T04:55:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	apt-get remove && apt-get install
2012-03-06T04:56:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	o, that way. :)
2012-03-06T05:00:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	...jsut wondering, any possibility that you're running 12.04 beta?
2012-03-06T05:01:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	As much as I love cutting edge stuff like Arch, no ... I'm too old for that. Nominally stable 11.10
2012-03-06T05:38:00.000Z	Walther	terran4000	ouch
2012-03-06T05:39:00.000Z	terran4000	Walther	thanks for the ideas and helping out. Many thanks sir.
