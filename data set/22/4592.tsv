2007-12-04T05:11:00.000Z	MikeH		Hrm, I didn't think of Azureus Pelo
2007-12-04T05:11:00.000Z	MikeH		What's that like these days?
2007-12-04T05:12:00.000Z	MikeH		I imagine the gcj version of azureus is a bit better?
2007-12-04T05:14:00.000Z	MikeH		hrm
2007-12-04T05:14:00.000Z	MikeH		is it safe to ctrl+c midway through an apt-get whilst it's downloading packages?
2007-12-04T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	yes
2007-12-04T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	it'll pick up where you left off.
2007-12-04T05:15:00.000Z	MikeH	soundray	how about if I don't want it to? :P
2007-12-06T01:51:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	no
2007-12-06T01:52:00.000Z	MikeH	soundray	no?
2007-12-06T01:52:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	you can use rsync instead of cp if you want to avoid re-transferring files
2007-12-06T01:52:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	cp doesn't stop because of a file being "in use", by the way
2007-12-06T02:02:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	why aren't you listening to me?
2007-12-06T02:02:00.000Z	MikeH	soundray	all you said was no?
2007-12-06T02:03:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	you mean you missed all the other things I said to you?
2007-12-06T02:03:00.000Z	MikeH	soundray	sorry, didn't see the other stuff
2007-12-06T02:04:00.000Z	MikeH	soundray	ok, so say I wanted to "sync" /path/to/d to /another/path/to/d with rsync, how would I go about it?
2007-12-06T02:05:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	use rsync --help to find out about the available parameters and pick the ones you need. Use --dry-run for testing before you run the command in earnest.
2007-12-06T02:09:00.000Z	MikeH	soundray	i did " rsync -r --dry-run /media/FreeAgent\ Drive/Data/d/ /media/temp/d/" but got no output?
2007-12-06T02:11:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	did you actually look at all the options? I imagine that you want at least --owner --group --times --perms
2007-12-06T02:13:00.000Z	MikeH	soundray	ok, but they arn't going to change the fact dry run gave me no output
2007-12-06T02:14:00.000Z	soundray	MikeH	look, I told you what to do. It's not that difficult to find out what to do, based on my advice.
