2006-01-12T14:25:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	you can find the processes with lsof or netstat -p, if that's what you mean
2006-01-12T14:25:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	thanks. I'll try that
2006-01-12T14:28:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	do you happen to have an idea why this happens when I write apache2 in terminal. Error: netstat -p
2006-01-12T14:28:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	do you happen to have an idea why this happens when I write apache2 in terminal. Error: (13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to address [::] :80
2006-01-12T14:29:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	if you are running as an ordinary user, you can't access ports < 1024
2006-01-12T14:29:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	I used sudo.
2006-01-12T14:29:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	perhaps another process still have the port?
2006-01-12T14:30:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	 have any idea of which process might use it?
2006-01-12T14:30:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	do this:   lsof -i :80
2006-01-12T14:31:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	Didn't get any feedback.
2006-01-12T14:32:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	the command didn't respond. Just prompting for another command. Just as there wasn't any processes using :80
2006-01-12T14:32:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	then that's not the reason.  Hmm, what's the exact error again?
2006-01-12T14:33:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address [::] :80
2006-01-12T14:33:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	If you do netstat -na | grep 80       you get nothing?
2006-01-12T14:35:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	I get some stuff. unix  2      [ ACC ]      STREAM     LISTENING     11880    private/relay
2006-01-12T14:36:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	no, it has to be in the external section and look like this:      0.0.0.0:80
2006-01-12T14:36:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	assuming it is listening for all connections.  just look for :80
2006-01-12T14:36:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN <- that was on the top of what I just pasted.
2006-01-12T14:37:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	ok, there's your problem.  Now use -p to find out what process that is
2006-01-12T14:39:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	I'm sorry. But I haven't used linux for too long. Anyways,  netstat -p | procces name? :P
2006-01-12T14:39:00.000Z	sethk	Jnx	netstat -nap | grep :80
2006-01-12T14:42:00.000Z	Jnx	sethk	thanks alot :) I found the procces and killed it. Apache is able to start now.
