2008-07-29T22:02:00.000Z	Jan|		not just have the livecd everytime
2008-07-29T22:02:00.000Z	Jan|		I want the graphical install
2008-07-29T22:02:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	run the installer from the live CD then
2008-07-29T22:03:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	run the installer from the live CD
2008-07-29T22:03:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	it's on the desktop
2008-07-29T22:11:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	try the 'Safe Graphics Mode' option then
2008-07-29T22:42:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	have you tried the Safe Graphics boot menu entry?
2008-07-29T22:42:00.000Z	Jan|	soundray	yes it doesn't work either
2008-07-29T22:43:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	what about the alternate CD?
2008-07-29T22:43:00.000Z	Jan|	soundray	I dont want to install in text mode
2008-07-29T22:44:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	why not? It's essentially the same
2008-07-29T22:45:00.000Z	Jan|	soundray	but how could I get it to show a desktop then ?
2008-07-29T22:46:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	once it's installed, it'll either boot to a desktop or let you choose a driver for your setup
2008-07-29T22:47:00.000Z	Jan|	soundray	ok
2008-07-29T22:48:00.000Z	soundray	Jan|	you just boot it, make a selection from the boot menu and follow the wizard
