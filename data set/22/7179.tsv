2006-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	enable Multiverse
2006-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	i see it in Multiverse
2006-10-06T16:15:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	enable Multiverse and update your package info
2010-03-07T22:10:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	depending upon your sound chipset and the PulseAudio drivers for it, you may only be able to get sound from one app at a time.
2010-03-07T22:12:00.000Z	ori	mneptok	that's frustrating. Is there any way to varify that? and, if that is my case, how do i switch between the volumes of amarok, and google chrome?
2010-03-07T22:15:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	you need to find out if your sound chipset supports hardware mixing. most onboard chips do not.
2010-03-07T22:15:00.000Z	ori	mneptok	how?
2010-03-07T22:15:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	lspci -vvv
2010-03-07T22:16:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	then take that information to Google
2010-03-07T22:16:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	sorry, i don;t keep a list of the features of every audio chipset ever made in my head. ;)
2010-03-07T22:16:00.000Z	ori	mneptok	lol of course not
2010-03-07T22:17:00.000Z	ori	mneptok	http://paste.ubuntu.com/390456/
2010-03-07T22:17:00.000Z	ori	mneptok	and by the way, internet sound works when amarok is closed
2010-03-07T22:17:00.000Z	mneptok	ori	well, i have a choice. help you with every step of basic research into audio hardware, or go with my wife to the store. she's waiting. she's warm beside me in bed at night. you aren't, and so you lose. ;)
2010-03-07T22:18:00.000Z	ori	mneptok	lolno pob. family first!
2010-03-07T22:18:00.000Z	ori	mneptok	could u get back to me later if we both happen to be on?
