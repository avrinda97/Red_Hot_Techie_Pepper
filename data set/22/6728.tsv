2006-08-13T07:20:00.000Z	pdamoc		The only resolution recognized is 640x480
2006-08-13T07:21:00.000Z	pdamoc		how do I setup my monitor?
2006-08-13T07:21:00.000Z	pdamoc		nforce2 cipset
2006-08-13T07:21:00.000Z	pdamoc		integrated
2006-08-13T07:22:00.000Z	pdamoc		GForce 4 MX
2006-08-13T07:22:00.000Z	jnvilo	pdamoc	have you tried choosing the nv driver?
2006-08-13T07:22:00.000Z	pdamoc	jnvilo	how?
2006-08-13T07:23:00.000Z	jnvilo		for NV gforce, it is nv
2006-08-13T07:24:00.000Z	pdamoc		this is what I was afraid of :)
2006-08-13T07:24:00.000Z	pdamoc		ok... I'll give it a try
2006-08-13T07:25:00.000Z	jnvilo	pdamoc	you might want to update your resolution too while you're at it
2006-08-13T07:26:00.000Z	pdamoc		I'm back.... the driver is already nv
2006-08-13T07:27:00.000Z	pdamoc		and... the monitor is detected correctly
2006-08-13T07:28:00.000Z	pdamoc		what should I try?
2006-08-13T07:30:00.000Z	pdamoc		I only have 680x480 in screen resolution
2006-08-13T07:30:00.000Z	pdamoc		even if in xorg.conf the monitor shows all the resolutions
2006-08-13T07:31:00.000Z	jnvilo	pdamoc	did you install the proper driver now? i.e. using the nv?
2006-08-13T07:31:00.000Z	pdamoc		it says nv in the driver section
2006-08-13T07:32:00.000Z	pdamoc		ora: it might be but what can I do?
2006-08-13T07:33:00.000Z	jnvilo		orasisl: i have same card on my laptop here
2006-08-13T07:33:00.000Z	jnvilo	pdamoc	how about your devide section? have you updated it to the resolution that you want?
