2012-11-17T15:43:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	That's the best advise, take it or leave it.
2012-11-17T15:44:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	graingert synlinks are the way to go.
2012-11-17T15:44:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	... use as many as you like.  It is easy.
2012-11-17T16:13:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	Is this a wired connection?

2012-11-17T16:18:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	Are you using DHCP to connect to your LAN?
2012-11-17T16:20:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	as Jordan_U suggests, you should edit IP configuration via nm-connection-editor
2012-11-17T16:21:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	YOu can re-connect.
2012-11-17T16:22:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	Did you set up the router with nameserver(s) suggested by your ISP?  If so, try pinging one of them.

2012-11-17T16:24:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	as Jordan_U suggests, you should edit IP configuration via nm-connection-editor and use 8.8.8.8 as nameserver
2012-11-17T16:26:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	Yes, just use 8.8.8.8
2012-11-17T16:27:00.000Z	usr13	brandon420	See what your are using now.  (grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf)
