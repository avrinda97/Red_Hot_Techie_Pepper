2011-06-28T13:29:00.000Z	darshan		i was wondering where Empathy puts the conversation logs in the last ubuntu
2011-06-28T13:31:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	what do you mean by in the last ubuntu?
2011-06-28T13:32:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	can't you see that in settings?
2011-06-28T13:33:00.000Z	darshan	epzil0n	no, i did not find it
2011-06-28T13:34:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	ok, should be there.. i'm not in ubuntu now so can't check but i can log into ubuntu and have a look

2011-06-28T13:40:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	can't see it in settings, only that you can enable/disable the logging
2011-06-28T13:41:00.000Z	darshan	epzil0n	foud it! /home/darshan/.local/share/TpLogger/logs/
2011-06-28T13:41:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	hehe, i was just digging in the home dir.. great =)

2011-06-28T13:45:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	elementary uses purple
2011-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	but they will move to Lingo.. anyways elementary os builds upon ubuntu so they probably work
2011-06-28T13:52:00.000Z	darshan	epzil0n	?
2011-06-28T13:52:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	software center got a bunch of them, just search dictionary.. donno which one is good tho, i use purple in elementary os ;)
2011-06-28T13:53:00.000Z	epzil0n	darshan	didn't find it software center, purple that is
