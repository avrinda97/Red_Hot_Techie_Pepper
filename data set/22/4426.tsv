2009-10-31T02:12:00.000Z	dreambox		Okay I ll get myself an external ..
2009-10-31T02:12:00.000Z	dreambox		So, how do I begin the process,
2009-10-31T02:12:00.000Z	dreambox		I downloaded the new .iso
2009-10-31T02:13:00.000Z	dreambox		I was thinking of going directly with the install cd ,
2009-10-31T02:13:00.000Z	dreambox		doesn't this take care of the partitioning thing ?
2009-10-31T02:15:00.000Z	dreambox		Ops ,lost ya
2009-10-31T02:15:00.000Z	dreambox		I just have Windows Vista on my machine right now... In case I wasn't clear !
2009-10-31T02:16:00.000Z	dreambox		aha I see
2009-10-31T02:16:00.000Z	dreambox		Ok, next question, what do I do with my multimedia files. Do I keep them in the Win partition ?
2009-10-31T02:17:00.000Z	dreambox		and I guess, as it used to be, WIndows can't access Linux files...
2009-10-31T02:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	not without third party drivers, no
2009-10-31T02:19:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	yes
2009-10-31T02:19:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	that is the standard 32bit live cd
2009-10-31T02:20:00.000Z	dreambox	Bodsda	: are you sure? I didn't see anything related to "livecd" when I downloaded this on the ubuntu website.
2009-10-31T02:20:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	all ubuntu cd's excpet the 'alternate' cd are live cd's
2009-10-31T02:21:00.000Z	dreambox	Bodsda	ooooh! cool dat! thanks. Didn't know
2009-10-31T02:21:00.000Z	dreambox	Bodsda	so I get the option to either install or just go play directly
2009-10-31T02:21:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	correct
2009-10-31T02:58:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	no, but Kubuntu does
2009-10-31T03:04:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	VLC has non-free codecs bundled with it and therefore cannot be installed legally in all countries which is why it is not installed by default
2009-10-31T03:05:00.000Z	dreambox	Bodsda	aha, legal stuff.. but in any case, these stuff should be mentioned on the "Switching to WIndows" document.. I think its pretty essential...
2009-10-31T03:05:00.000Z	Bodsda	dreambox	what document?
