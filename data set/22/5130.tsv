2007-07-15T08:27:00.000Z	mysqlchange	gnomefreak	look in up that insist on ubuntu
2007-07-15T08:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mysqlchange	nothing you stated in an hour had anything to do directly with support
2007-07-15T08:28:00.000Z	mysqlchange	gnomefreak	it was that apt-get install fail to update
2007-07-15T08:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mysqlchange	well it must have beena  while ago because you have been offtopic for a long time. either ask your question again if it was not answered or join #ubuntu-offtopic to talk to kbrooks on why he left or anything else that is non support related
2007-07-15T08:30:00.000Z	mysqlchange	gnomefreak	who is kbrooks i don't know him
2007-07-15T08:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mysqlchange	you have been talking to him. so you know enough to know who he is.
2007-07-15T08:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mysqlchange	this is not a debate

2007-07-15T08:35:00.000Z	mysqlchange	gnomefreak	 if you want to speak a offtopic go to #ubuntu-offtopic
