2005-04-19T06:28:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		is it safe not to have a root password then?
2005-04-19T06:29:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		kool so it's safe then?
2005-04-19T06:31:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		can sudo do exactly the same as root would?
2005-04-19T06:32:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	yes.
2005-04-19T10:42:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	you are looking for a particular module name?
2005-04-19T10:43:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	what is "dw"?
2005-04-19T10:44:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	okay..  heh
2005-04-19T10:51:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	it's still modprobe.
2005-04-19T10:51:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	"which modprobe". It's in /sbin/
2005-04-19T10:53:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	what are you trying to do? Maybe we can help better then.
2005-04-19T11:17:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	"sudo nano /etc/modutils/alsa-base" might be what you want to edit.
2005-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	I'm not sure what you're doing, but if you are trying to use a card instead of your onboard sound, probably disabling onboard sound in BIOS would be easiest.
2005-04-20T11:31:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	I don't think it's on the Ubuntu repos.
2005-04-20T11:32:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	what is an extract?
2005-04-20T11:33:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	anywhere you like I'd imagine. I'd visit their website for install details as it's not an Ubuntu thing so it appears.
2005-04-20T11:38:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	I typically make a ~/bin directory and symlink in there after I add it to my $PATH.
2005-04-20T11:39:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	which part?
2005-04-20T11:40:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	make a symlink in there (assuming you didn't install the app directly in that directory) like this "ln -s /path/to/your/executable ~/bin/execname"
2005-04-20T11:41:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	then to add it to your $PATH, do this "export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH""
2005-04-20T11:41:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	to make it part of your path at each session, add that export command to your ~/.bashrc file.
2005-04-20T11:42:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	no sweat.
2005-04-20T12:04:00.000Z	dcraven	spanglesontoast	dpkg -i whatever.deb
