2007-08-07T06:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	MAke sure you get ALL files... hidden etc...  Also make a full backup while you are doing that...
2007-08-07T06:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	Quick, easy, three lines in a terminal...
2007-08-07T06:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	sudo su.... your pass....  cd space /.....   then.. wait for it....
2007-08-07T06:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	tar cvpzf backup.tgz --exclude=/backup.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found  --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys --exclude=/media --exclude=/root/.Trash -- /
2007-08-07T06:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	If you just want to backup your home  change the last "/" to "/home"
2007-08-15T12:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	I backup with one line tar command in a terminal
2007-09-11T07:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	Did you read the wiki and install gstreamer and all the restricted drivers stuff
2007-09-11T07:36:00.000Z	aguitel	Jack_Sparrow	,how i fix it?
2007-09-11T07:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	| !restricted
2007-09-11T07:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	bot is on coffee break... google up ubuntu and restricted formats
2007-09-11T07:45:00.000Z	aguitel	Jack_Sparrow	,are you talking about this :http://www.ubuntux.org/node/72 ?
2007-09-11T08:07:00.000Z	aguitel	Jack_Sparrow	,i installed restrictedformat but i have error in totem :No accelerated IMDCT transform found
2008-05-28T18:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	We dont do polls in here and with only 64 meg nothing Ubuntu will work except maybe a minimal install..
2008-05-28T18:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	try distrowatch.com
2008-06-30T04:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	Windows partitions can get locked by windows and then ubuntu will set them to read only.  boot windows and power down twice should clear it
2008-06-30T04:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	You can force it.. but with force you run the risk of corruption of files

2008-06-30T04:42:00.000Z	aguitel	Jack_Sparrow	in fstab there is no mention of my ntfs partition
2008-06-30T04:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	aguitel	sudo mkdir /media/locked-drive then sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/locked-drive -o force  substitute your locked drive for sda1
