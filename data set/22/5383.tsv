2007-08-02T09:41:00.000Z	DWSR		oh, and profanephobia: Can I get an applet to allow me to have an icon in my system tray for my wireless connection (signal strength, etc)
2007-08-02T09:41:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	on /etc/modprobed.d/aliases
2007-08-02T09:40:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	do you have ipv6 enabled? that slows down the dns lookup
2007-08-02T09:40:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	Think so. Where can I disable it?
2007-08-02T09:42:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	Just comment out the ipv6 entry?
2007-08-02T09:44:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	alias net-pf-10 off
2007-08-02T09:47:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	I just disabled ipv6 by putting in those two off lines in my aliases file and now I can't connect or resolve at all!
2007-08-02T09:48:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	do a  /etc/init.d/networking restart
2007-08-02T09:50:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	'No DCHPOFFERS received. No working leases in presistent database - sleeping'
2007-08-02T09:51:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	you can manually enable your nic card and run dhclient
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	It's lost my AP again.
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	It seems that my wireless card has suddenly lost signal and I can't connect.
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	 how far is it?
2007-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	When it was running Windows, it could sit right where it is now and get an almost perfect signal. It's definitely within range, because this computer is sitting right beside it and getting a good signal.
2007-08-02T10:08:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	What do you suggest?
2007-08-02T10:08:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	sometimes the signal strength is also too strong and saturates your receiver..
2007-08-02T10:08:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	look into the driver capabilities if anything you can trim the sensitivity or whatever
2007-08-02T10:09:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	also wireless stuff does not guarantee that connectivity 100%
2007-08-02T10:09:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	I want connectivity to be at least as good as it was on Windows, which was 95%.
2007-08-02T10:10:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	not too much to ask..make sure you dont have lots of metals between your nic and AP
2007-08-02T10:11:00.000Z	bulmer	DWSR	you need to start responding with a prefixed of my nick, or else it will be missed
2007-08-02T10:11:00.000Z	DWSR	bulmer	Yeah, no worries.
