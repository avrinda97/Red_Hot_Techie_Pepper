2008-05-03T22:52:00.000Z	neopsyche		at end of rope trying to get simple solution to record tv
2008-05-03T22:54:00.000Z	neopsyche		Nothing I try works.. No drivers available on windows after searching for hours.. myth tv too complicated and not simple for needs.. plenty of software out there for simple timed recording .. most of which either.. a. only works with dvb cards of which mine is analog.. b. doesnt install because of dependencies c. has no install file .deb for ubuntu and has problems when trying to compile IS...
2008-05-03T22:54:00.000Z	neopsyche		...THERE ANY DECENT SIMPLE VIDEO RECORDER FOR UBUNTU THAT CAN INSTALL FROM APT-GET? (excuse caps)
2008-05-03T22:55:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	NO CAPS PLEASE
2008-05-03T22:55:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	try mythtv, however it's probably not as "simple" as you'd like
2008-05-03T22:56:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	have you tried mythbuntu? I'm using the beta, granted, because I got it working and I don't want to mess around with it again, but it works fine for me
2008-05-03T22:56:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	yes.. mythbuntu is borked
2008-05-03T22:56:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	its so (bleeping) complicated
2008-05-03T22:56:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	in what way? the Beta I installed didn't come with mysql and mythtv, etc.
2008-05-03T22:57:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	I had to install those myself and configure, etc. Hence why I'm not in too much of a hurry to bork it again
2008-05-03T22:57:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	mythbuntu: Now causes errors to pop up when i start ubuntu / doesnt want to work with mysql / user interface wont start.. i dont want all the features .. i just want timed recording to output FLV files.
2008-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	output to flv files? eh, that would be hard...
2008-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	if you'd *like* I can put up the beta ISO I used to install, mind you, it contains LOTS of bugs and you need to install several things...
2008-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	output divx maby? asking tooo much?
2008-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	I might recommend knoppmyth to you, the packages are cr*p, but it works
2008-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	I have XviD output configured
2008-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	knoppmyth?
2008-05-03T22:59:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	i saw that.
2008-05-03T22:59:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	i really just want simple program to install.
2008-05-03T22:59:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	it's debian based and currently a PoS, I switched from that to Mythbuntu, however, if you don't care about extra packages, it works pretty much out of the box
2008-05-03T23:00:00.000Z	neopsyche	Ice_Wewe	after HOURS and Hours .. of searching .. still no solution to record tv card from tv input .. i tried motv / xawtv / mythtv / metv / GshowTV and others.. nothing working!
2008-05-03T23:01:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	neopsyche	what capture card?
