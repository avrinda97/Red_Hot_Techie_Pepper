2010-05-17T16:42:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	I blacklisted the floppy, but the error still came
2010-05-17T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 thats not the zoom plugin. thats some other compiz plugin. :)  i forget what its called
2010-05-17T17:08:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	scale, but I can't get the going either
2010-05-17T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 how about 'expo'
2010-05-17T17:09:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	not sure what you mean?
2010-05-17T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 expo shrinks windows down and shows them all in a displayt you click on to change windows
2010-05-17T17:10:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	yeah, thats what I want, let me check it, I was trying scale and zoom, but I guess expo is what I needed
2010-05-17T17:10:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	where is this expo?
2010-05-17T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 its a plugin in the csm tool.
2010-05-17T17:12:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	I cant find expo, I am using Xubuntu, but I remember seeing it when I tried Ubuntu
2010-05-17T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	  No idea on xubuntu.. if you are trying to use compiz on xubuntu.. you may as well just use ubuntu i figure.
2010-05-17T17:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 theres proberly some compiz packages you are missing
2010-05-17T17:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 you did set up xubuntu to use the compiz winmdow manager?  Without that - you gont get any effects at all.
2010-05-17T17:15:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	yeah, that was my first question, to check if it was running, but soreau comfirmed it with me, when I do a ps -ax |grep compiz, it shows up
2010-05-17T17:16:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	you were right I think, I just install compiz-plugins-extra
2010-05-17T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 other then 'vga' im not sure there are any others available
2010-05-17T18:41:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	back in the debian days, you would use dpkg-reconfigure, but now xorg is auto config.  So I guess I have to change it in xorg.conf file, but will the change be permanent even after reboot, isn't there a menu way of doing it?
2010-05-17T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 you could still use xorg.conf i guess but other then using  the low end vga driver. Ive no idea wht other driver you would even try
2010-05-17T18:42:00.000Z	compaq	Dr_Willis	oh, I will go google for a while then, if you here I will let you know what I find
2010-05-17T20:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 SKIP_CHECKS is not a command.. you are setting a enviroment variable THEN that line runs compiz with tha variable set
2010-05-22T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	compaq	 the internet :)
