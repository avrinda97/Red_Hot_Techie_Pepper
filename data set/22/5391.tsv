2009-09-14T22:44:00.000Z	jrib	obiwan_	your question right now doesn't make sense.  Check out xpra and see if that's what you want

2010-01-16T00:33:00.000Z	jrib	obiwan_	that's a question for youtube

2010-01-16T00:35:00.000Z	obiwan_	jrib	i don't feel like mailing youtube staff and stuff just to ask this question, i'll try a youtube chan or a video chan or sth
2010-03-13T06:41:00.000Z	jrib	obiwan_	erm, gdm is run as root...  why don't you tell us what you are trying to accomplish instead of being cryptic?
