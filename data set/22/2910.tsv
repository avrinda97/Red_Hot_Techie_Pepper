2009-01-25T22:05:00.000Z	tarimari		hi guys
2009-01-25T22:05:00.000Z	tarimari		i want to do a dual boot with ubuntu and opensuse. ubuntu is already installed and has saperate  /boot partition.  i want to make saperate /home partition to use it both at ubuntu and opensuse. can i use the same /boot partition for both ubuntu and opensuse?
2009-01-25T22:06:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	i wouldn't do that
2009-01-25T22:06:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	why ?
2009-01-25T22:07:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	both distros have a different understanding of how menu.lst should look, and both migh fight over the vmlinuz and initrd.img symlink
2009-01-25T22:08:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	ok stef, then i ll keep /boot partition as it is for ubuntu, and then what is the best? to do one more /boot partition for opensuse, or combine all in one partition?
2009-01-25T22:09:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	generally let's say that i have only opensuse at disk, is it advisable to have /boot partition separately?
2009-01-25T22:09:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	if you use plain ext3 (no lvm or raid) there's no benefit in using a separate /boot
2009-01-25T22:11:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	i use ext4, that's why i made saperate /boot
2009-01-25T22:11:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	infact i have a separate *grub*-partition mounted to /mnt/grub and symlink it to /boot/grub/ .... but i manage my /grub/menu.lst manually
2009-01-25T22:12:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	hmm. what's the benefit of using saperate partition only for /boot/grub and not for all /boot?
2009-01-25T22:13:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	one grub for all distros, but the kernels stay with their root filesystems
2009-01-25T22:16:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	sorry. i just asked permission ;). actually i got dizzy with the lot of messages. but anyway i ll continue here.thanks :)
2009-01-25T22:18:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	if i have ext2 for /boot/grub for grub1, and the boot kernel at a partition which is ext4, then grub1 can boot this kernel at this ext4 partition?
2009-01-25T22:18:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	i want to do setup like you, but i have my main partitions at ext4. that's why i ask
2009-01-25T22:18:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	so just to keep things simple... don't share one /boot between distros, but you can setup your other distro with a separate /boot, too. just keep track which grub installation is active, and which menu.lst it is pointed to
2009-01-25T22:19:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	i m just asking about ext4 support. how i can do the setup like you did :)
2009-01-25T22:21:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	i dont know/believe that grub can handle ext4 currently, so you will have to have a separate /boot on ext3 anyway
2009-01-25T22:21:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	so i must make another small /boot partition for suse
2009-01-25T22:22:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	yup... doesn't hurt
2009-01-25T22:22:00.000Z	tarimari	stefg	using live cd?
2009-01-25T22:23:00.000Z	stefg	tarimari	I'd just present some unpartitioned space to the suse installer
