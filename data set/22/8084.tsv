2005-11-01T10:33:00.000Z	MFen		my stepson trashed his mbr. how do i re-run grub-install
2005-11-01T10:34:00.000Z	MFen		i've booted from the cd, ran the hardware update step, jumped over to the shell prompt
2005-11-01T10:34:00.000Z	MFen		*update*-grib
2005-11-01T10:34:00.000Z	MFen		i'll try that
2005-11-01T10:36:00.000Z	MFen		so that howto's dead on step one
2005-11-01T10:36:00.000Z	MFen		why do i *need* a livecd. i have the install cd. the whole OS is there on hda6
2005-11-01T10:37:00.000Z	MFen		i've got it chrooted and everything, grub just won't cooperate
2005-11-01T10:38:00.000Z	MFen		hah. i got update-grub working without the dumb livecd
2005-11-01T10:39:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	do you want to know how to do it *if* you have to use the livecd?
2005-11-01T10:39:00.000Z	MFen	SEJeff	no, i just wanted to know why grub-install didn't work in the chroot
2005-11-01T10:39:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	It's probably easier to use the grub shell in the chroot
2005-11-01T10:39:00.000Z	MFen		well, i just ran update-grub. it ran, there were no errors, and the mbr is still screwed
2005-11-01T10:39:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	I use root (hd0,4) and then setup (hd0) from the chrooted grub shell
2005-11-01T10:40:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	Yes, because that won't always work
2005-11-01T10:40:00.000Z	MFen	SEJeff	dang it, i think that's what i did the last time i had this
2005-11-01T10:40:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	but my method will
2005-11-01T10:40:00.000Z	MFen	SEJeff	i believe it will
2005-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	I have to do that to my windows laptop after everytime I boot into windows
2005-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	MFen	SEJeff	wth, why?
2005-11-01T10:41:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	I think it has something to do with the drive geometry being reported incorrectly
2005-11-01T10:42:00.000Z	SEJeff	MFen	I found a forum post on how to fix it, just haven't had time to do it
2005-11-01T10:43:00.000Z	MFen	SEJeff	well, i'll let you know in a minute..
