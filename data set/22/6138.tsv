2006-12-13T16:06:00.000Z	scorp123		@KITCHE: Why wouldn't that be "good practice"??? I too am running OpenSSH everywhere. I simply need it.
2006-12-13T16:07:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	people tend to leave ssh at a default port and if you get portscanned alot you might be DoSed if they hit the system enough times to try and get in
2006-12-13T16:09:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	denyhost doesn't work to well when there is 20 machines pinging you trying to break in
2006-12-27T08:52:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	don't both it only works in IE
2006-12-27T09:25:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	he has to touch it to do key logins
2006-12-27T09:25:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	well ... I didn't have to.
2006-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	he probably doesn't know the difference between XGL and AIGLX ;)
2006-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	that's ok with the nvidia driver you don't need either anyways
2006-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	well ... you need AIGLX, but it's already there in the X.org package, at least on Edgy
2006-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	and the new transparent cube is extremely cool :-)
2006-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	well in ubuntu you do but if you get the unoffical driver you don't need either
2006-12-27T09:42:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	I got that already. And you still use AIGLX as backend ;)
2006-12-27T09:39:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	you have a HowTo on that? I followed these instructions and got it working on my first attempt: http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Edgy/AiGLX
2006-12-27T09:39:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	HowTo to use unofficial driver?
2006-12-27T09:40:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	yes, ... I'm just curious.
2006-12-27T09:43:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	not really I turn mine off
2006-12-27T09:43:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	even the nvidia website says you don't need aiglx
2006-12-27T09:43:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	hmmm ... interesting. So it runs directly on the nvidia drivers?? Cool. I will look into that.
2006-12-27T09:44:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	aiglx and XGL supplies that pixmap extension but the nvidia driver has that now
2006-12-27T09:44:00.000Z	scorp123	kitche	OK, I see ....
2007-06-23T07:11:00.000Z	kitche	scorp123	anything root is off-topic here
