2010-02-21T11:43:00.000Z	nikhil_		in synaptic is there a way to check what packages have been downloaded but not installed?
2010-02-21T11:44:00.000Z	grndslm	nikhil_	look in /var/cache/apt ???
2010-02-21T11:44:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	thanks
2010-02-21T11:45:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	there are lots of packages there some of which are installed
2010-02-21T11:45:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	i need non installed but downloaded only
2010-02-21T11:45:00.000Z	grndslm	nikhil_	right.... dunno about that then
2010-02-21T11:45:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	thanks for the info anyways
2010-02-21T11:45:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	yeah twas useful
2010-02-21T11:48:00.000Z	grndslm	nikhil_	just outta curiosity, what are you trying to do?  i'm trying to do something perhaps similar where all packages are downloaded daily, but not installed until GDM loads
2010-02-21T11:48:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	i wish i knew that much :P lol i just gave up MS so im navigating my way through understanding how all this works before trying anything major like that :)
2010-02-21T11:51:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	what actually happned is my net died during install via synaptic and i didnt complete install so trying to figure out what i wanted to install :P
2010-02-21T11:51:00.000Z	grndslm	nikhil_	 pretty sure that if you just resume the command you had last, it'll pick up where it left off
2010-02-21T11:52:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	ah, aptitude update
2010-02-21T11:55:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	i didnt know that dependency failure was even possible with apt
2010-02-21T11:55:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	i tried using suse when switching from ubuntu to kubuntu...yast is a disgusting mess. it really frustrated me.
2010-02-21T11:56:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	i am a noob :)
2010-02-21T11:56:00.000Z	grndslm	nikhil_	not dependency failure... but dependency "confusion"
2010-02-21T11:56:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	example?
2010-02-21T11:57:00.000Z	grndslm	nikhil_	basically... if you install something in apt-get with 50 dependencies, i don't believe all of those dependencies will be removed with apt-get...
2010-02-21T11:58:00.000Z	grndslm	nikhil_	and there are issues where you want to install two packages, but each of them require the same "dependent file" with different versions
2010-02-21T11:58:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	this is unresolvable right?
2010-02-21T12:00:00.000Z	nikhil_	grndslm	yeah this is your example. ardchoille im just un-noobifying :P
