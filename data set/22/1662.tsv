2010-09-30T06:49:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	did you do memtest, systester, etc?
2010-09-30T06:50:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	It worked great 2-3 weeks ago. It HAD been up for several months before I did a reinstall (and a new HDD)
2010-09-30T06:51:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	nevertheless do the tests when you suspect (or suffer) instability
2010-09-30T06:51:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	I will if the system gets more desperate. Any ideas on trouble shooting within the OS itself? Such as log browsing?
2010-09-30T06:52:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	I am terrible at trouble shooting general linux problems. I am good with the software but not with OS logs.
2010-09-30T06:52:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	hard lock... i suspect: memory, cpu, power supply, or video...
2010-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	interesting... just pings? when it happens did you try sysrq reset?
2010-09-30T06:54:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	sysrq restart? The only way to restart it is with a Crtl+Alt+Delete or Power Cycle it.
2010-09-30T06:54:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	ah then it works with plain ctrl alt del...
2010-09-30T06:54:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	Do you agree it must be software?
2010-09-30T06:55:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	its just a suspicion, its never bad to rule out hardware ^^
2010-09-30T06:55:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	are you using a gui in that server?
2010-09-30T06:55:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	no it's basically headless with a monitor I through on it for checking things if SSH isn't working or such.
2010-09-30T06:55:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	just standard console.
2010-09-30T06:56:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	anything interesting in logs?
2010-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	I am not sure how to debug those logs as there is so much data. Would logs/things do I look for? I am fine with individual programs like Apache/Samba logs, but with system wide there is just so much info I am bad at searching.
2010-09-30T06:58:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	And use that time to look through dmesg or such?
2010-09-30T06:59:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	what would it show as a "lockup" any words it might be using? Just looking for critical things failing?
2010-09-30T06:59:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	please PM any responses you have as I am going to my server room/extra room to look at the server, I wouldn't want to miss any of your advice.
2010-09-30T07:04:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	can't get into OS at all right now. Some error messages, not word for word but got keywords "comreset failed -16 ata" "Unkown command "terminal"" "fsck .2% non contiguous"
2010-09-30T07:06:00.000Z	jdeloach	Artemis3	Should I just try reinstalling?
2010-09-30T07:09:00.000Z	Artemis3	jdeloach	hard to say, chances are it will do the same
