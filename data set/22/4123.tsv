2008-06-23T22:23:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	post the pastebin link here, others might be able to help you as well that wau
2008-06-23T22:29:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	From that it does seem like the driver is loaded...
2008-06-23T22:31:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	he means pastebin that as well, I guess...
2008-06-23T22:35:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	you can do a complete basic-manual connection using this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=571188

2008-06-23T22:41:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	then post the link to it...
2008-06-23T22:43:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	by the way "iwlist scan" would be the command to manually scan for networks, provided it works as it should...
2008-06-23T22:52:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	nothing on my part I'm afraid, to me it's mostly gibberish, but pastebin BOTH things wols_ asked you for (adressed to him) and see if he has the time to check them out, otherwise, post on the forums and include all info you've given us here and the log files as attachments.
2008-06-23T22:54:00.000Z	Ienorand	ubun00blet	..and describe your problem thoroughly, of course, if posting on forums.
