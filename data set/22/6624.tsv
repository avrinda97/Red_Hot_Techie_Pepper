2006-09-08T07:37:00.000Z	brian98		it will even stream multicast streams
2006-09-08T07:38:00.000Z	brian98		and thats only the tip of the iceberg
2006-09-08T07:38:00.000Z	brian98		does it compress dual layer down to 4.7
2006-09-08T07:38:00.000Z	brian98		?
2006-09-08T07:38:00.000Z	brian98		nothing native?
2006-09-08T07:39:00.000Z	brian98		clonedvd I miss
2006-09-08T07:40:00.000Z	brian98		you asked for me
2006-09-08T07:40:00.000Z	brian98		em
2006-09-08T07:40:00.000Z	brian98		I mean
2006-09-08T07:42:00.000Z	brian98		does anyone have any probs with x hanging once or twice a day?
2006-09-08T07:43:00.000Z	krazykit	brian98	no, not really.  are you using ati-drivers?
2006-09-08T07:44:00.000Z	brian98	krazykit	Yes, is there known issues?
2006-09-08T07:44:00.000Z	krazykit	brian98	only that ati drivers suck
2006-09-08T07:44:00.000Z	brian98	krazykit	any workarounds?
2006-09-08T07:45:00.000Z	krazykit	brian98	but i've not had that problem with an x300.  but seriously, ati-drivers are really crummy.  either deal with it, buy an nvidia card, use the FOSS drivers, or try upgrading them yourself.
2006-09-08T07:56:00.000Z	brian98	krazykit	it says disable DRI - I've looked around for dri found the wiki but am unsure what effects it will have, do I lose 3d?
2006-09-08T07:59:00.000Z	krazykit	brian98	yeah, you'll lose 3d.  i think the FOSS ati drivers give 3d for the 9600 and below
2006-09-08T08:01:00.000Z	brian98	krazykit	would it be worth compiling the ati drivers from ati and trying them to see if it improves?
2006-09-08T08:02:00.000Z	krazykit	brian98	maybe.  it might be easier to use the ati drivers in seveas' repository.
2006-09-08T08:04:00.000Z	brian98	krazykit	http://free.linux.hp.com/~brett/seveas/freenx/dists/breezy-seveas/freenx/ don't see the ati driver there?
2006-09-08T08:05:00.000Z	krazykit	brian98	because you're looking in the freenx part.
2006-09-08T08:05:00.000Z	krazykit	brian98	and if i don't respond right away, it's cuz i'm writing a paper ;-)
