2011-06-09T13:36:00.000Z	lasha		guys i got lots of problems with new ubuntu 11.04
2011-06-09T13:36:00.000Z	lasha		why every window movement in unity can be laggy, with drivers installed even
2011-06-09T13:37:00.000Z	lasha		and they spoiled compiz, anyone knows how to make desktop cube on unity ?
2011-06-09T13:39:00.000Z	lasha		i am quitting ubuntu if i fail with compiz again
2011-06-09T13:40:00.000Z	lasha		they made linux look like a boring mac haha thats what, whatever i knew to do with 10.10 basically isnt useful knowledge with natty anymore
2011-06-09T13:42:00.000Z	lasha		so anyways, does anyone know if i need ccsm ? or simple compiz setting manager?
2011-06-09T13:43:00.000Z	photon	lasha	they changed the UI in 11.04?
2011-06-09T13:43:00.000Z	lasha	photon	to unity u mean ?

2011-06-09T13:44:00.000Z	lasha	photon	yes, are u asking me or its a rhetoric question?
2011-06-09T13:44:00.000Z	photon	lasha	no, I am asking you. I am still using 10.04
2011-06-09T13:44:00.000Z	lasha	photon	yes dont leave 10.04
2011-06-09T13:45:00.000Z	photon	lasha	seems like I'll have to switch to another linux distro soon then.
2011-06-09T13:45:00.000Z	lasha	photon	they will kill ubuntu the next release when it wont have old interface anymore
2011-06-09T13:45:00.000Z	photon	lasha	I thought they were going with gnome 3?
2011-06-09T13:47:00.000Z	lasha	photon	same here i liked 10.10 though
2011-06-09T13:48:00.000Z	photon	lasha	I just read http://www.geekwithlaptop.com/why-does-ubuntu-11-04-disappoint ... seems like they managed to kill their own OS.
2011-06-09T13:48:00.000Z	lasha	photon	i dont know the differences between gnomes gnome shells and unities and ubuntu anymore
2011-06-09T13:51:00.000Z	lasha	photon	that is the main kill haha its very slow
2011-06-09T13:53:00.000Z	photon	lasha	can you at least install gnome 3 or won't they allow that?
2011-06-09T13:57:00.000Z	lasha	photon	as i checked fedora and opensuse have gnome 3
