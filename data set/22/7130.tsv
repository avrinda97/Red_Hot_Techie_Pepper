2006-06-04T13:53:00.000Z	mwe		apt-get sucks aptitude rocks though :)
2006-06-04T13:54:00.000Z	mwe		maddler: driver not loaded or wrong partition
2006-06-04T13:55:00.000Z	mwe		apt-get can't uninstall things properly
2006-06-04T13:55:00.000Z	mwe		sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop && sudo apt-get --purge remove kubuntu-desktop will leave your system with thousands of files
2006-06-04T13:55:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 um remove and clean seem to work fine for me.
2006-06-04T13:56:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 try remove  then a clean.
2006-06-04T13:56:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	try it. it wont work I tell you. sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop && sudo aptitude purge kubuntu-desktop will leave an identical system though
2006-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 as clean?
2006-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	apt-get clean will just delete the downloaded debs
2006-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 remove leaves traces?
2006-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop will not remove anything but the virtual package
2006-06-04T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	all the kde stuff will stay
2006-06-04T13:58:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 oh you need to recurse.
2006-06-04T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	huh?
2006-06-04T13:58:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 it has a recursive dependency command... i don't think it is purge.
2006-06-04T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	aptitude is superiour I think
2006-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 you might well be right, but i think apt-get is more mature so one would think that it has good functionality.
2006-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	apt-get doesn't keep track of what installed what as dependencies
2006-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 i think that is all in the apt package manager database, every package manager refs it.
2006-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	more mature ?
2006-06-04T14:00:00.000Z	troy_s	mwe	 been around longer.  it was the original i think.
2006-06-04T14:00:00.000Z	mwe	troy_s	it's getting off topic but I wonder what makes you say that. aptitude is pretty old as well
