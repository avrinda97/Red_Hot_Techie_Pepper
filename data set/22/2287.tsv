2011-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	torturedsoul		i can't for the life of me get ubuntu to boot from a usb stick
2011-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	torturedsoul		any1 know how to do it?
2011-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	some USB sticks will NEVER be bootable. it's a fact of USB sticks.
2011-06-29T13:06:00.000Z	torturedsoul	hdon	its a new stick... 4gb
2011-06-29T13:07:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	unfortunately i am not very knowledgeable about the technical limitations of non-bootable USB sticks, so i can't help, only offering you the possibility that it is crapstick :(
2011-06-29T13:08:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	i have found that big brand names mean nothing for obscure feature incompatibilities like this, but i am disinclined to have an argument about speculation
2011-06-29T13:09:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	one possibility to ease your testing cycle: run an emulator and tell that to boot off your stick. then you don't have to reboot your real machine every time you try again. on the other hand, a positive test in the emulator won't mean a positive result on the real thing,.. but i highly doubt a negative result in a emulator will EVER mean a negative result on a real machine
2011-06-29T13:17:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	actually i have a question for you: what are you trying to boot?
2011-06-29T13:20:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	sorry for the late responses...
2011-06-29T13:20:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	yeah ok, so do you have a gnu/lniux system already?
2011-06-29T13:26:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	sorry i am.. having a bit of a physiological problem right now... did you say you have gnu/linux system already?
2011-06-29T13:28:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	lol... the point of tor is that you do not trust a single administrator to protect your anonymity. a vps will not do that.
2011-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	it's difficult to trust your own computer, let alone a VPS that isn't even in your home!
2011-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	awesome :)
2011-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	who is your provider in cali?
2011-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	ubiquity networks?
2011-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	yeah i have been thinking about auditing the exit nodes i come out of on tor
2011-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	like, write down ip, see who owns it
2011-06-29T13:34:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	how much do you pay for your vps?
2011-06-29T13:35:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	save a child, run a tor node ? (lol)
2011-06-29T13:36:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	so, an emulator *can* access your usb stick. you just have to configure your virtual machine to emulate a USB stick, and point it at your /dev/whatever USB stick block device. of course, your USB stick may present itself to your machine as multiple devices.
2011-06-29T13:36:00.000Z	hdon	torturedsoul	my favorite are usb sticks that present a CD-ROM drive with an autoplay program to run on your computer :|
