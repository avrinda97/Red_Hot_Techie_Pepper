2004-10-03T15:52:00.000Z	Kamion		we import all >= serious bugs from Debian into our bugzilla so that we can track them, and sometimes we fix them ahead of Debian
2004-10-03T15:53:00.000Z	Kamion		(and send back the fix)
2004-10-03T15:53:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	you can install ubuntu right now, no worries
2004-10-03T15:53:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	hmm?
2004-10-03T15:54:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	see the bugzilla of any distro :)
2004-10-03T15:54:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	sorry, just confused by "you can install ubuntu right now, no worries"
2004-10-03T15:59:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	perhaps you'll have a mandrake 10.1 report soon :)
2004-10-04T16:04:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	the TV in question is > 20 years old, it's possible some part has just gone
2004-10-04T16:41:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	the Ubuntu configuration is just what's in Debian experimental, really; I co-maintain openssh in Debian and am coordinating the two
2004-10-04T16:42:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	this is good policy -- in debian and elsewhere, imo
2004-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	heh. we agree i guess
2004-10-25T11:18:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	not many; Indonesian's the one that springs to mind
2004-10-25T11:19:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	hence why we'll be moving to it by default eventually
2004-10-25T11:20:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	there are still Han unification problems in China/Japan languages, though
2004-10-25T11:23:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	(basically, the Simplified-Chinese/Traditional-Chinese/Japanese characters with approximately similar meanings and etymology got glommed together into one Unicode glyph each, which apparently isn't always quite accurate)
2004-10-25T11:25:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	hmm. i'm quite confident that technology (ie computers being american and not able to show sane characters) is the main reason why bad english is the official language of the internet :)
2004-11-12T11:20:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	so it is! but not in hoary-updates. i wonder.
2004-11-12T11:21:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	hoary-updates should be empty until hoary is released.
2004-11-12T11:22:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	well, that explains it. i guess i should add warty-updates to sources.list :)
2004-11-28T10:45:00.000Z	topyli	Kamion	change it to "danielbo will fix it soon" :)
2004-11-28T10:46:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	heh. already fixed in Debian though
2004-11-29T17:39:00.000Z	Kamion	topyli	just add Replaces: industrial to industrial-steel.deb
