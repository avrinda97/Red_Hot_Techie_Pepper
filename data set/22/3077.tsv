2009-02-19T18:28:00.000Z	Pici	nettezzaumana	Seeing as Ubuntu is not an rpm based system, try asking in the channel for the distro that you are using,

2009-02-19T18:31:00.000Z	Pici	nettezzaumana	After a quick look, I don't see an option for that on the dpkg manpage, but you could always look through /var/log/dpkg.log
