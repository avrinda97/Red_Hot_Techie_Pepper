2010-06-19T09:39:00.000Z	michael_		my firefox keeps messing up pretty much
2010-06-19T09:40:00.000Z	michael_		like right now the ubuntu homepage pretty much got a gray haze over it
2010-06-19T09:40:00.000Z	michael_		in mozzilla
2010-06-19T09:41:00.000Z	michael_		whenever i click on my browser it turns gray
2010-06-19T09:43:00.000Z	michael_		do i have a virus in ubuntu?
2010-06-19T09:43:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	No, it's just firefox being bloated :)  Is this an older machine?
2010-06-19T09:44:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	Really?  What site are you on?  Is it flash intensive?
2010-06-19T09:44:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	What kind of processor?
2010-06-19T09:45:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	Ok, you should be fine.  Is this a flash intensive site?
2010-06-19T09:46:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	Also, take a look at top.
2010-06-19T09:46:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	Look at top
2010-06-19T09:48:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	What did you do to fix it?
2010-06-19T09:48:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	In a terminal type "top"
2010-06-19T09:49:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	press q to exit top
2010-06-19T09:50:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	It lists processes that are taking the most cpu at the top.  See?
2010-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	Oh where to start.  archive problem: "sudo apt-get install unrar"
2010-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	i don't understand the problem about the audio applet or logging in.  What the heck does funny mean?
2010-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	To fix flash you have to convince adobe to write better flash player software for linux or convince the web to switch entirely to html5
2010-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	Or write your own flash player!  (Please do that would be swell)
2010-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	No prob  Thanks! :)
2010-06-19T09:59:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	ha ha.  Really?  I would just keep a close eye on "top"  It's a great program! :)  Watch it for things sucking up a lot of the processor and then google those processes.
2010-06-19T10:17:00.000Z	edbian	michael_	awesome!! :)
