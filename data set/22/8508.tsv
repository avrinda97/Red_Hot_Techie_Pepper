2006-11-08T16:08:00.000Z	st4hl		"Ubuntu comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by
2006-11-08T16:08:00.000Z	st4hl		applicable law.
2006-11-08T16:08:00.000Z	st4hl		this thing?
2006-11-08T16:09:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	yeah lemmy chekc what file it is
2006-11-08T16:09:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	/etc/motd
2006-11-08T16:09:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	slocate motd
2006-11-08T16:09:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	slocate is your friend
2006-11-08T16:10:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	no, it comes with it
2006-11-08T16:10:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	run updatedb
2006-11-08T16:10:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	it comes with ubuntu so i can't imagine that you dont
2006-11-08T16:11:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	unless your typeing it wrong
2006-11-08T16:11:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	how stupid, its an essential package. ubuntu's command line support is laughable
2006-11-08T16:12:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	i would personaly never use ubuntu on a server.. its a desktop os through and through
2006-11-08T16:12:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	yeah, as i say. run updatedb as root
2006-11-08T16:13:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	yw
2006-11-08T16:13:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	remember that if your looking for a file that has recently been added you have to updatedb first (it is run as a cron job every day though)
2006-11-08T16:14:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	and you cant use it to find files that the user running it doesnt have permission to read
2006-11-08T16:14:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	iirc, the installation hsould set up a cron job but check anyway
2006-11-08T16:15:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	check roots crontab
2006-11-08T16:15:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	yeah
2006-11-08T16:15:00.000Z	variant	st4hl	cool
