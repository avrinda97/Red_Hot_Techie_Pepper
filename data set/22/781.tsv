2012-03-30T19:20:00.000Z	randomperson		i have a question about ubuntu server
2012-03-30T19:21:00.000Z	randomperson		can i install joomla on ubuntu server?
2012-03-30T19:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	no problem
2012-03-30T19:23:00.000Z	randomperson	Scunizi	what would i need for that? just PHP and Apache2 installed?
2012-03-30T19:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	there's an easy way to install all that is needed.. hang on a sec.
2012-03-30T19:24:00.000Z	randomperson	Scunizi	thanks i love easy ways, much less involved :)
2012-03-30T19:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	follow my "following" questions to the channel and hopefully someone will be able to answer me.. :)
2012-03-30T19:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	yes.. choose LAMP.. that is the ubuntu apache server .. Linux.. Apache.. MySQL.. PHP = LAMP
2012-03-30T19:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	you already have the Linux part of the equation
2012-03-30T19:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	you trying to install LAMP on that machine?
2012-03-30T19:36:00.000Z	randomperson	Scunizi	this is another question this one is for a friend who screwed his server
2012-03-30T19:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	ah ok. sorry
2012-03-30T19:36:00.000Z	randomperson	Scunizi	& auronandace thanks for the combined help
2012-03-30T19:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	if you're trying to do a remote install check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and http://tinyurl.com/3exghs
2012-03-30T19:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	although if you have remote access to the machine.. how is that possible without it still having the OS installed.. did the desktop just fail for your friend?
2012-03-30T19:51:00.000Z	randomperson	Scunizi	he has some kind of shell OS that lets him access the machine but can actually do anything its very odd IMO
2012-03-30T19:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	 and are you accessing via ssh?
2012-03-30T19:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	no.. I mean your access to the machine.. I thought it was remote and wondered how you were doing that
2012-03-30T19:53:00.000Z	randomperson	Scunizi	i need to do something like PXE server load but dont have one set up
2012-03-30T19:54:00.000Z	randomperson	Scunizi	my friend has the physical machine but he pulled out the CD and USB and trashed them
2012-03-30T19:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	those links should show you how to do that.. and a minimal web install after which you can add the packages you want like LAMP
2012-03-30T19:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	randomperson	gotta run c-u and good luck
