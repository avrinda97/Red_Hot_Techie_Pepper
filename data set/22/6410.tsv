2008-05-10T08:04:00.000Z	secret901		are there anywhere in Ubuntu to set my video output preferences besides "Screen Resolution"?
2008-05-10T08:05:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	run 'gksu displayconfig-gtk'
2008-05-10T08:06:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	thanks
2008-05-10T08:06:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	np
2008-05-10T08:06:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	is there a way to enable the secondary screen from that window?
2008-05-10T08:07:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	yep. i haven't used it, but it's there
2008-05-10T08:08:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	I can only either set it as the default screen or disabled
2008-05-10T08:08:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	then chances are you need to make sure you have the right video driver. it can help you with that too. there's a handy test button as well
2008-05-10T08:08:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	I know it's possible to output the video to TV, but dunno how.  when I'm in the login screen it's output to TV but when I'm logged in it's not
2008-05-10T08:09:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	i have no experience with that. sorry
2008-05-10T08:27:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	yes
2008-05-10T08:27:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	what are they? are they needed?
2008-05-10T08:28:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	you mean, before it finishes logging in? or after?
2008-05-10T08:29:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	I mean the time after you enter your login credentials and when your desktop shows up
2008-05-10T08:29:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	_after_ desktop shows up, and everything seems done?
2008-05-10T08:29:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	yes
2008-05-10T08:29:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	well, some things are scheduled
2008-05-10T08:29:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	but as for user apps, you can check your sessions applet
2008-05-10T08:30:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	what I'm seeing is when the login screen is displayed, the computer outputs video to TV, but when I'm logged in, it doesn't do that
2008-05-10T08:30:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	System > Prefs > Sessions
2008-05-10T08:30:00.000Z	secret901	tanath	I'm wondering if any program is launched during that time that would change that
2008-05-10T08:30:00.000Z	tanath	secret901	weird. i don't know much about that though
