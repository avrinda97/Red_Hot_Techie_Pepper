2006-05-28T14:58:00.000Z	juanca7777		hello everyone, I want to switch from nautilus to something more light like xfe, can someone help me out please?
2006-05-28T14:58:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	install xubuntu-desktop
2006-05-28T14:58:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	that's xfce4
2006-05-28T14:59:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	no I want to use gnome but without nautilus, and not that is not xfce4 that is xfe
2006-05-28T14:59:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	xfe= X file explorer
2006-05-28T15:00:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	heh. yes, it's in the universe repo
2006-05-28T15:01:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	exactly, I've already installed it, but I want to navigate using xfe not nautilus
2006-05-28T15:02:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	ok. System-Preferences-Sessions . open that. You'll see nautilus under current session. Click it, then click the remove button. That should stop nautilus from starting
2006-05-28T15:03:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	thanks :)
2006-05-28T15:04:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	then, setting xfe as something that gets called properly where nautilus would normally be, I have no clue :)
2006-05-28T15:05:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	lol, that was exactly what I needed to know \o/
2006-05-28T15:17:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	the easiest way to run that would be Alt-F2 , and type xfe
2006-05-28T15:18:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	I am very comfortable saying you will not be able to do that. Nautilus is tightly integrated into gnome, xfe is not
2006-05-28T15:19:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	gnomefreak, ok thanks I will stick to nautilus, quite frustrating, bye
2006-05-28T15:20:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	I understand your point, but the dev's have to choose somewhere :)
2006-05-28T15:21:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	gnomefreak, frustrating because I wanted to make it work, I like nautilus I you have at least 512 ram, I have an old thinkpad with 256, sometimes is way tooooooooooooooooooooo slow
2006-05-28T15:21:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	see what gnomefreak just said
2006-05-28T15:21:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	best solution available in my experience
2006-05-28T15:22:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	gnomefreak, that is no a 'fix' at least not what I want to achieve
2006-05-28T15:23:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	we know :( . I'd find the developers for xfe, ask them. And if you get good info, add it to the wiki for the next needy one :)
2006-05-28T15:23:00.000Z	juanca7777	nickrud	gnomefreak I will keep launching it from the terminal, yep nickrud, if I get some info I will wiki-fy it :)
2006-05-28T15:24:00.000Z	nickrud	juanca7777	alt-f2 xfe is faster ;P
