2007-08-23T05:12:00.000Z	ward_		had anyone got a speedtouch 510 ? i've wasted several hours and i still dont have a simple port forward
2007-08-23T05:13:00.000Z	ward_		i really don't know what to do anymore :s
2007-08-23T05:13:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	is that a router?
2007-08-23T05:13:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	its a modem with built in router, yes
2007-08-23T05:14:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	DSL huh?
2007-08-23T05:14:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	yes (dynamic ip)
2007-08-23T05:15:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	Honestly, best bet is to get a pure DSL modem, chuck the integrated router AT&T locks those suckers tight
2007-08-23T05:15:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	i use it as pure ADSL modem, i got a seperate router :-)
2007-08-23T05:16:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	DHCP from the modem = OFF
2007-08-23T05:16:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	its jsut that i can't forwards a port with this weird thing
2007-08-23T05:17:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	I'm stumped then, honestly when confronted with that integrated crap, I just dug out a modem without a router from my salvage :P
2007-08-23T05:17:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	i don't have a salvage lol
2007-08-23T05:18:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	try Craig's List I've seen DSL modems still wrapped floating around in there
2007-08-23T05:19:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	what is Crag's List?
2007-08-23T05:19:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	thanx
2007-08-23T05:20:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	I might be there soon too, so I feel for you
2007-08-23T05:22:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	nvidia or ati?
2007-08-23T05:22:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	SIS
2007-08-23T05:22:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	no dunno anytihng about those
2007-08-23T05:27:00.000Z	AncientRelic	ward_	The point is your router/modem is doing NAT once
2007-08-23T05:27:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	i know that i portforwarded both
2007-08-23T05:27:00.000Z	ward_	AncientRelic	my modem to my router, my router to my webserver
