2009-01-09T04:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	TheFunkbomb	do you have to reboot everytime?
2009-01-09T04:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	TheFunkbomb	hhmm, may not be worth it, might want to wait till forums are back up
2009-01-09T04:03:00.000Z	Bodsda	TheFunkbomb	not without using virtual machines
2009-01-09T04:13:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	Bodsda	this is what I got "SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such file or directory" :/
2009-01-09T04:14:00.000Z	Bodsda	TheFunkbomb	that doesnt make much sense, sorry i cant really troubleshoot this while the forums are down, try asking the channel again, sorry

2009-01-11T00:20:00.000Z	Bodsda	TheFunkbomb	cool!, what was the fix?
2009-01-11T00:20:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	Bodsda	I had to hook up via ethernet cable and run some updates

2009-01-11T00:23:00.000Z	Bodsda	TheFunkbomb	sudo is a wonderful tool, perhaps consider SELinux
