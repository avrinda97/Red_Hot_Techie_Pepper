2012-03-20T10:01:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	that depends on how wide you want to branch your knowledge... Arch is Linux, FreeBSD is not...
2012-03-20T10:02:00.000Z	Jon--	MestreLion	I'm leaning towards FreeBSD, though I did work with it a bit in my last work term. Was just looking for an opinion. I know I'm ot right now.
2012-03-20T10:02:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	 Arch also uses a lot (perhaps all) of the same GNU tools as Ubuntu, while FreeBSD uses much les (if any)
2012-03-20T10:03:00.000Z	Jon--	MestreLion	If I used FreeBSD, it'd be a CLI server for sure. Their X support is flaky at best.
2012-03-20T10:03:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	I think the answer depends on how far from your familiar experience you want to go... simply speaking, Arch is much closer to Ubuntu than FreeBSD
2012-03-20T10:04:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	if learning is your main focus, may I suggest Gentoo ? Or even LFS ?
2012-03-20T10:08:00.000Z	Jon--	MestreLion	You shouldn't need to recompile to use that.
2012-03-20T10:09:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	to use .debs of compiled (say C) software from different archs?
2012-03-20T10:10:00.000Z	Jon--	MestreLion	To use --force-architecture on a deb package with dpkg.
2012-03-20T10:10:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	you CAN use that, of course... and it will install, ok. My point is what would the consequences be :P
2012-03-20T10:11:00.000Z	Jon--	MestreLion	I don't know, why don't you try doing it in glibc ;)
2012-03-20T10:13:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	because you don't *need* to know what you're doing for 99% of the time... makes using the OS easier...
2012-03-20T10:16:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	think about this... Linus himself use Fedora (another "user-friendly" distro)... so yes, not being *forced* to tinker everything, everytime is a Good Thing(tm)
2012-03-20T10:17:00.000Z	Jon--	MestreLion	Who is Linus?
2012-03-20T10:18:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	just a regular guy, no one to worry about.. RMS is the on e that should be your God :D
2012-03-20T10:19:00.000Z	Jon--	MestreLion	Yeah, right, RMS love from a Ubuntu user? I dont
2012-03-20T10:19:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	 ... and he uses an Ubuntu-based distro, btw
2012-03-20T10:19:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	Why not? He is an Ubuntu-derivative user
2012-03-20T10:19:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	that is what gNewSense is all about
2012-03-20T10:20:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	It's Ubuntu with strict free software guidelines
2012-03-20T10:21:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	not adding partner is not enough... many FOSS packages still have trademarks issues..
2012-03-20T10:21:00.000Z	MestreLion	Jon--	not to mention binary blobs in firmware, kernel, etc
