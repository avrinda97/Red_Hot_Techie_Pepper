2007-01-22T17:30:00.000Z	warlock		Anyone know how to see a list of installated programs on ubuntu 5.10 server?
2007-01-22T17:31:00.000Z	warlock		installed* even
2007-01-22T17:31:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	use this command -- dpkg --get-selections > installed-software
2007-01-22T17:32:00.000Z	warlock	P0ldy	running ubuntu server.
2007-01-22T17:33:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	it will still work.
2007-01-22T17:33:00.000Z	warlock		I want to see the installed packages on my server, just have no idea of how to see it.
2007-01-22T17:33:00.000Z	warlock		oh, sorry.
2007-01-22T17:36:00.000Z	warlock	P0ldy	didnt seem to work
2007-01-22T17:37:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	did you look at the list afterwards?  dpkg --get-selections outputs the installed packages to a file called "installed-software".  Then just "cat installed-software | less" to read it
2007-01-22T17:37:00.000Z	warlock	P0ldy	got no list :p
2007-01-22T17:37:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	The whole thing into one line would look like : dpkg --get-selections > installed-software && cat installed-software | less
2007-01-22T17:37:00.000Z	warlock		oh, thanks.
2007-01-22T17:38:00.000Z	warlock		Is there something I could remove that's not needed for a server, that might eat cpu/ram or such P0ldy ?
2007-01-22T17:39:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	well, sure, but it obviously depends on what you're using the server for.  Naturally you won't need an x-server if you have one, or alsa, ...I mean, you can uninstall anything you aren't using... that'd slim it down
2007-01-22T17:40:00.000Z	warlock	P0ldy	gonna use it for game servers only, anything I could remove thats not needed? running 5.10 breezy
2007-01-22T17:41:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	I'm no expert on game servers and I don't know what you've got installed already, but you could look at removing services running in the background by default, like cups (print service) or Apache if you aren't running a web server (again, might be required for a gaming server, I've never set one up)
2007-01-22T17:41:00.000Z	warlock	P0ldy	everything I need is screen,ssh - that's all.
2007-01-22T17:42:00.000Z	warlock	P0ldy	can we talk in private or such?
2007-01-22T17:42:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	check out this thread for getting rid of unneccessary services http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=89491
2007-01-22T17:42:00.000Z	warlock		as Im gonna ghost this installation on 10 other servers tomorrow, need this done asap :(
2007-01-22T17:42:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	probably best just to keep it in the chat since there are other more knowledgable people here that could probably chime in their two cents
2007-01-22T17:42:00.000Z	P0ldy	warlock	plus, I'm leaving for a bit
