2011-01-12T22:50:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	does it work using mount (command)?
2011-01-12T22:52:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	try this:
2011-01-12T22:53:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	sudo mount -t cifs //sever/share /path/to/mount/point
2011-01-12T22:54:00.000Z	vBm	bencahill	mount error(12): Cannot allocate memory
2011-01-12T22:54:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	? weird
2011-01-12T22:57:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	okay, do you have any pertinent items in Event Viewer?

2011-01-12T23:00:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	you need to be running smbmount ^^ as root (sudo)
2011-01-12T23:00:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	...or add it to /etc/fstab with the "user" option
2011-01-12T23:02:00.000Z	vBm	bencahill	if i use sudo i get this -> mount error(12): Cannot allocate memory | Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)
2011-01-12T23:04:00.000Z	bencahill	vBm	okay, look in Event Viewer (System log) for something with the source as "Srv"
2011-01-12T23:06:00.000Z	vBm	bencahill	i did it ;o -> sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=USER,password=PASS //server/share /mnt/share
