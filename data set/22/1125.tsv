2010-11-17T04:41:00.000Z	ElPasmo	puddles	ActionParsnip r007 I'm back, I managed to run into the console but not to recover the gnome... I'll paste you a report of what I tried in a second
2010-11-17T04:46:00.000Z	ElPasmo	puddles	it means I can't access to graphical mode, only to console.. I didn't touch grub config file but I've restored a vesa version of xorg.conf, what should I change in grub config file? and what's "init 5" for?
2010-11-17T04:49:00.000Z	ElPasmo	puddles	r007 what I mean is, should I make my tries in recovery mode or in normal mode?

2010-11-17T04:58:00.000Z	ElPasmo	puddles	I have the unity edition, don't you have any idea? finally I manage to do an aptitude -purge xserver-xorg-video-radeon and it worked
