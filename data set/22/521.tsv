2011-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	celltech		If I get Mint. Can I replace ubuntu with it without losing my data?
2011-10-22T13:13:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	with backups or a separate home, probably.  But ask mint support
2011-10-22T13:14:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	why?
2011-10-22T13:15:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	why?  What do you hate about it?  unity (the default interface) or something else?
2011-10-22T13:16:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	if you want something like gnome2, I'd suggest trying xfce.  There's no need to go back to 11.04, just install the desktop environment you want and choose it at login
2011-10-22T13:19:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	what administrator options are lacking exactly?
2011-10-22T13:19:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	and what exactly did you try that did not work?  There were many suggestions given to you.
2011-10-22T13:20:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	update-manager is still in 11.10.  Not sure what you mean by "tab"
2011-10-22T13:21:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	I'm not familiar with the unity interface, but you can run update-manager from a shell if you wish
2011-10-22T13:21:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	why?  Try to be specific.
2011-10-22T13:22:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	what do you mean by "get into it"?
2011-10-22T13:22:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	so go back to the first 2 responses we gave you after you said that originally.  Read ubottu's message and consider my suggestion to use xfce.
2011-10-22T13:23:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	I just told you it exists.
2011-10-22T13:24:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	right, so I told you to run it from a terminal.
2011-10-22T13:24:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	open a terminal, type "update-manager" and then enter
2011-10-22T13:25:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	please stick to support in this channel
2011-10-22T13:26:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	we have been working one on one.  I asked you to highlight me on your responses to me.
2011-10-22T13:27:00.000Z	celltech	jrib	K. how come, when I turn my computer off. As in no power. when I turn it back on. It get stuck at a terminal looking screen.. And to get to my desktop. I have to hit ctrl - alt - F1. Then it goes to my desktop? It's never done that before
2011-10-22T13:28:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	if you aren't sure your upgrade completed successfully, I would start there.  If that doesn't prove fruitful, than be more specific about where and how it gets stuck (what do you see)
2011-10-22T13:29:00.000Z	celltech	jrib	How do I complete the upgrade just incase
2011-10-22T13:29:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	initially, you would try to use update-manager
2011-10-22T13:32:00.000Z	jrib	celltech	if you're replying to me, please use my nick as I am doing other things and will likely miss your response otherwise
