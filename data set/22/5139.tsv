2007-07-13T14:46:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	yup
2007-07-13T14:47:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	I loaded cfdisk and Im following the screen steps, I chose new physical partition, and then type.. what do I chose for linux ext3?
2007-07-13T14:49:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	the closest i see is '82 Linux swap / Solaris' or '81 Minix / old linux'
2007-07-13T14:50:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	I'm formatting my pendrive now ;)
2007-07-13T14:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	to linux ext3? what code did you use
2007-07-13T14:51:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	I'm checking it out now, normally I use fdisk (didn't even know cfdisk exists)
2007-07-13T14:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	and he suggested cfdisk which is a bit more handy, except it manages a lot of formats
2007-07-13T14:53:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	that's 'linux' right?
2007-07-13T14:54:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	yeah
2007-07-13T14:54:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	then you're alright
2007-07-13T14:55:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	ah yes, its to linux, then you can format whatever type you want
2007-07-13T14:57:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	yup: mkfs.ext3 -O dir_index
2007-07-13T14:57:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	that works fine too
2007-07-13T14:57:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	and where do you point to /dev/sdb at?
2007-07-13T14:58:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	if /dev/sdb is the drive you want to format then: mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb
2007-07-13T14:58:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	pffft that was easy
2007-07-13T14:59:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	It is from now on ;) in the 6 months i've used linux I've learned more than in the 10 previous years with windows
2007-07-13T14:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	ok its formatting now
2007-07-13T14:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	yeah same here, and formatting is one that has to be concrete in me, but i hardly format anything these days
2007-07-13T15:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	lol Im actually watching Gparted do mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1 on the details page, (and its done now)
2007-07-13T15:02:00.000Z	captainm	SurfnKid	nice one, I'm not the best at this stuff so I'm glad it worked out
2007-07-13T15:02:00.000Z	SurfnKid	captainm	it did, thanks for the help
