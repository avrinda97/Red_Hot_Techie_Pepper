2008-05-29T06:32:00.000Z	Catslacks		Does anyone have any idea why I would be able to see all the wireless networks around me, but not be able to connect? I used ndiswrapper to install the drivers for my card. It claims it is supported. When I look at ndiswrapper -l the device and driver seem to be recognized.
2008-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	I'm in the same situation
2008-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	what card do you have?
2008-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	which encryption method are you using? I tried WPA (with wpa_supplicant) and WEP, and nothing works. It works in my old install of Feisty and Debian.
2008-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	it's a netgear card. Don't recall the exact model number
2008-05-29T07:22:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	some people say their wifi is working with this app: http://wicd.sourceforge.net/download.php
2008-05-29T07:22:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	I'll try it out myself in a bit.
2008-05-29T07:23:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	I'll try it as well
2008-05-29T07:26:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	I can't find any place to download it
2008-05-29T07:26:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	I found the solution
2008-05-29T07:26:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	false alarm. I was pinging myself >.>
2008-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	not false alarm. It still was the true solution :P
2008-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	Haha. Look how fast my internet is!
2008-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	disable wpa_supplicant.
2008-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	What did you do?
2008-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	I removed wpa_supplicant from the system. (I'm trying to connect using WEP, since WPA1 was failing to connect for some reason)
2008-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	How do I do that?
2008-05-29T07:28:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	apt-get remove wpa_supplicant should do the trick.
2008-05-29T07:29:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	I'll be right back once I get xchat set up in my desktop
2008-05-29T07:31:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	Well, good luck Jedi. I can't get mine to work, and Ubuntu is doing strange things.
2008-05-29T07:31:00.000Z	The_PHP_Jedi	Catslacks	oi... I hope for the best.
2008-05-29T07:32:00.000Z	Catslacks	The_PHP_Jedi	The best seems to be Vista in this case, because Ubuntu is turning out to be what I thought it would. I can't even get the internet to work. :P
