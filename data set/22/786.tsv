2011-04-10T23:09:00.000Z	suicidolt		seriously? the linux support channel doesn't even know how to build an app launcher?
2011-04-10T23:09:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	what are you talking about?
2011-04-10T23:10:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	what is an app launcher?
2011-04-10T23:12:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	different people know different things and everyone here is a volunteer.
2011-04-10T23:14:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	I have used it for over a decade and I don't know how to launch a program they way you want to. Nor am I sure I know what you want.
2011-04-10T23:14:00.000Z	suicidolt	smw	you see the little buttons on your panel? they're called application launcher
2011-04-10T23:15:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	system -> preferences -> main menu
2011-04-10T23:15:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	and no, the actual entries are not called application launchers
2011-04-10T23:16:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	however the main menu program allows you to edit the menus.
2011-04-10T23:16:00.000Z	suicidolt	smw	would you like a screenshot?
2011-04-10T23:16:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	what? I just gave you the answer
2011-04-10T23:16:00.000Z	suicidolt	smw	and editing the menu requires the same command I don't know how to do
2011-04-10T23:17:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	you need to make a script that does that. Or, you can cd /path; ./command
2011-04-10T23:18:00.000Z	suicidolt	smw	so the "command" box needs to say "cd /usr/local/games/nwn; ./nwn" yes?
2011-04-10T23:18:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	I believe so. That is what I would try.
2011-04-10T23:20:00.000Z	suicidolt	smw	no such file or directory
2011-04-10T23:20:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	ok, make a script and make the command the path to the script
2011-04-10T23:21:00.000Z	suicidolt	smw	how do I make a script?
2011-04-10T23:22:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	you make a text file. You start the first line with #!/bin/bash
2011-04-10T23:22:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	then you put one cmd on each line.
2011-04-10T23:22:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	then you chmod 755 the_file.sh
2011-04-10T23:23:00.000Z	smw	suicidolt	it tells linux to use bash to run the commands.
