2006-06-09T06:28:00.000Z	oranged		anyone else having problems downloading flashplayer from adobe?
2006-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	other than having to maunally install it, no
2006-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	its hella slow for me the last two days..
2006-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	I'll check it
2006-06-09T06:30:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	speed's fine for me
2006-06-09T06:31:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	must be the hops between me and adobe
2006-06-09T06:31:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	can you send me the tar.gz?
2006-06-09T06:31:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	yes, I'll re-download it (just deleted it again) but my upload's only 128k so it could be slow
2006-06-09T06:32:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	its probably faster than .1-.3kb/s
2006-06-09T06:32:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	i would appreciate it
2006-06-09T06:34:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	it's coming your way now
2006-06-09T06:37:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	have you noticed the file transfer?
2006-06-09T06:38:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	i noticed.. its not grabbing the file
2006-06-09T06:39:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	strange. Do you want me to try it again?
2006-06-09T06:39:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	nah.. i'll just wait the hour and a half or so left on the transfer from adobe. ;)
2006-06-09T06:39:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	thanks for trying tho
2006-06-09T06:40:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	ok. I feel sorry for you though, I thought internet in NZ was bad but yours must be truly shocking. Or is it just adobe?
2006-06-09T06:41:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	its just adobe.. i'm getting 300-400kb/s from ubuntu servers
2006-06-09T06:41:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	try accessing the file through a cache
2006-06-09T06:41:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	i looked for mirrors.. they all point to the same adobe download
2006-06-09T06:42:00.000Z	Bletch__	oranged	I meant a web-cache, not a mirror. google doesn't cache it, but others might.
2006-06-09T06:51:00.000Z	oranged	Bletch__	googled "index of" and the filename.. ;)
