2006-04-13T10:29:00.000Z	Emsko		Anyone here know how I can get the music from my iPod onto my computer?
2006-04-13T10:30:00.000Z	Rhine	Emsko	you could use winampe and transfer in windows and mount the drive in linux
2006-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	Emsko	Rhine	all I have is ubuntu on here
2006-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	Rhine		Oh o.O
2006-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	Rhine		Then
2006-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	Rhine		theres a hidden folder
2006-04-13T10:32:00.000Z	Rhine	Emsko	does your ipod show up when you connect it? If so go to Ipod_control folder\music
2006-04-13T10:33:00.000Z	Rhine		and drag that where ever you want
2006-04-13T10:33:00.000Z	Rhine		those are all your music files
2006-04-13T10:34:00.000Z	Rhine		Wonder if someone can help me with this one. I get an X Server error before i reach the login and it wont load for me
2006-04-13T10:34:00.000Z	Emsko	Rhine	all the folder and files are given names like f04 and DIUE.mp3... any way to decode it back to the nice and pretty names I had under itunes on windows?
2006-04-13T10:34:00.000Z	Rhine		Not really
2006-04-13T10:35:00.000Z	Rhine		it will have to be manual
2006-04-13T10:35:00.000Z	Rhine		thats the simplest way though
2006-04-13T10:35:00.000Z	Emsko		jeez... 15 gigs of music
2006-04-13T10:35:00.000Z	Rhine		Ill look for something for you Emsko
