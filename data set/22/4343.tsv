2010-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	vbwe		hey im totally new to ubuntu and i want to install it to, i currently have w7.. is it better for me to install ubuntu on vmware or what?
2010-11-05T21:36:00.000Z	vbwe		if i want to try ubuntu first time
2010-11-05T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	each has advantages
2010-11-05T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	vmware/virtualbox will alter your (crappy) OS less
2010-11-05T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	you can use win7's partition resizer to make unpartitioned space (run your backups first) then ubuntu wil loffer to install to the free space
2010-11-05T21:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	you'll need about 6Gb for the OS and enough space to be comfortable, then as much space as youo want for user data
2010-11-05T21:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	ubuntu can also read and write ntfs, Windows cannot access ext4 which is the default fs in Ubuntu, despite ext4 definitions being completely available for use
2010-11-05T21:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	30Gb is waaaay enough
2010-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	for a true dualboot, yes. MD5 test te iso before use and burn slow
2010-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	universal usb?
2010-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	the u in usb stands for universal
2010-11-05T21:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	sure you can use unetbootin or the easy 1-2-3 app on pendrivelinux
2010-11-05T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	you can create the usb from windows
2010-11-05T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	sure, its just data, just format it
2010-11-05T21:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	you can dualboot with ubuntu, if thats what you mean?
2010-11-05T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	yes, win7 will be added to grub
2010-11-05T21:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	intel cpu's can be 64bit, amd64 just refers to ALL 64bit CPUs
2010-11-05T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	the active partition is the one looked on for boot info after the MBR is read
2010-11-05T21:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	c drive doesn't mean anything in linux
2010-11-05T21:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	still means nothing, windows incorrectly names partitions, drives
2010-11-05T21:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	the windows partition will not be the active one, the linux one will and grub will then boot the windows partition
2010-11-05T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vbwe	the ubuntu install will install grub for you and handle the dual boot
