2008-11-12T00:21:00.000Z	zimbres		I installed a software from source using some options in configure script and now i would like to choose different options, what should i do? Just run ./configure with the desired options and then make and make install?
2008-11-12T00:22:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	sounds like it would be worth a try
2008-11-12T00:22:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	you could try doing a "sudo make uninstall" first if you want
2008-12-19T22:27:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	can you do anything useful? then it's probably bash =)..
2008-12-19T22:28:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	there is probably some kind of enviroment variable.. I don't think sh uses colours and such either
2008-12-19T22:29:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	on my computer sh only uses the prompt "$"
2008-12-19T22:30:00.000Z	zimbres	Slart	I have a script that is sopposed to run in sh.
2008-12-19T22:30:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	ok... then run it using sh? "sh scriptname.sh"
2008-12-19T22:32:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	I think dash and sh are pretty compatible..if not totally compatible.. bash and sh on the other hand do some things differently
2008-12-19T22:33:00.000Z	zimbres	Slart	Everytime I run a configure script i get a message "[: 98: ==: unexpected operator" and the script continues but does not behave in the expect manner. I have tested this script in an other pc(fedora) and it run ok. It does not accept "=="
2008-12-19T22:34:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	you've tried both bash and sh ?
2008-12-19T22:34:00.000Z	zimbres	Slart	yes.
2008-12-19T22:35:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	then I would start looking for a new version of that script
2008-12-19T22:36:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	usually one of those works.. but if both fail I don't know how to fix it from your end.. unless you want to debug that script
2008-12-19T22:37:00.000Z	zimbres	Slart	I will try to rplace all == by =.
2009-02-04T22:14:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2009-02-04T22:14:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	I think that does it
2009-02-17T01:00:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	have you tried?
2009-02-17T01:00:00.000Z	zimbres	Slart	How should I do to copy?
2009-02-17T01:00:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	did you try what you just wrote?
2009-02-17T01:01:00.000Z	zimbres	Slart	Yes, but it didn'd copy.
2009-02-17T01:01:00.000Z	Slart	zimbres	ok, try cp -r <dir1> <dir2>
