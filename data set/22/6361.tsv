2006-11-22T10:06:00.000Z	sn9		so, nobody else has any ideas on how to get my firefox to work again?
2006-11-22T10:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	Say again please what is wrong with firefox?
2006-11-22T10:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	Tried a dpkg-reconfigure?
2006-11-22T10:09:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	of what? firefox itself?
2006-11-22T10:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	Yes.
2006-11-22T11:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	I miss open firmware :(
2006-11-22T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	easyubuntu, not Ubuntu
2006-11-22T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	how?
2006-11-22T11:45:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	installed firefox-ubuntu-themes and changed the theme from the default
2006-11-22T11:48:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	never mind -- still crashes
2006-11-22T11:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	When you removed it to re install did you -purge ?
2006-11-22T11:49:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	yes
2006-11-25T11:58:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	that's not quite right. you need a /dev node
2006-11-25T12:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	Not with diskutil you don't, the volume name works just fine.
2006-11-25T12:01:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	not as a partial pathname. "/" would work best then
2006-11-25T12:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	sorry, I meant to put the /Volumes/ , but still, / would be much easier than that, I did it from a liveCD last I did it so it wasn't / :)
2006-11-25T12:36:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	because it spews garbage to the terminal, which leads one to close the terminal, thereby also closing the app
2006-11-25T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	Is that really it, lol I thought is was a technical problem not a pebkac preventer :)
2006-11-25T12:38:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	there is also the tendency of GUIs to do very gag-inducing things when they get root access in general
2006-11-25T14:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	Wow, I hadn't seen the software-sopurces app before, much easier than explaining to people how to edit thier sources.list :)
2006-11-25T14:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sn9	But this new one has a much easier interface IMHO than synaptic did for repos.
2006-11-25T14:07:00.000Z	sn9	Jordan_U	in 5.10, yes. however, the 6.06 one already had the simplicity you're looking for. as the matter of fact, IMHO, the 6.06 one had an even easier interface than the 6.10 one
