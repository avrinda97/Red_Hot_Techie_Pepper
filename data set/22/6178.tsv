2006-12-07T13:09:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford		Im having trouble mounting a hard drive. i tried using the FAQ, but it failed me.  :( ive used sudo mount and the diskmounter script, but got nothin. :?
2006-12-07T13:11:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford		are those what you mean?
2006-12-07T13:11:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford		XFS
2006-12-07T13:12:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford		i noticed diskmounter assumed it was NTFS, so i made that change already. im gonna reboot and come back. :)
2006-12-07T13:12:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford		Daba: so my fstab can run again? unless theres a better way

2006-12-07T13:16:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	i don't doubt it lol
2006-12-07T13:31:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	you definitely shouldn't and especially if you haven't registered your nick... you would have been kicked for flooding
2006-12-07T13:34:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford	nothlit	flooding? for one line?
2006-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	oh
2006-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	rofl then why does he want you to paste it into a pastebin
2006-12-07T13:39:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	tell me what you want to do? I haven't been paying complete attention
2006-12-07T13:40:00.000Z	SchalaBrandford	nothlit	dabar says my drive is NTFS, so im gonna plug it into my laptop with a ide-->usb adapter
2006-12-07T13:41:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	so you want to mount said usb drive?
2006-12-07T13:41:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	read only or with writing too
2006-12-07T13:42:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	lol #windows if you do
2006-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	only ext2/ext3, and ext3 only as ext2
2006-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	also a unrecommended reiserfs way, and I seriously don't recommend it
2006-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	you can use FAT
2006-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	fat is readable by both linux and windows pretty well
2006-12-07T13:44:00.000Z	nothlit	SchalaBrandford	if you haven't used encryption or compression linux can use ntfs filesystems for writing too... ubuntuguide.org
