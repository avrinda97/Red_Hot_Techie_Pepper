2008-09-09T06:51:00.000Z	ad0n		I want to know how to mount a .000 image (dd) of a USB pendrive
2008-09-09T06:51:00.000Z	ad0n		anyone ?
2008-09-09T06:53:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	is it a raw image?
2008-09-09T06:53:00.000Z	ad0n	brian_herman	I think so
2008-09-09T06:53:00.000Z	ad0n		(almost sure)
2008-09-09T06:55:00.000Z	ad0n	brian_herman	any ideas ?
2008-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	did you try using mount?
2008-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	ad0n	brian_herman	yeah, but no sure if in a correct way
2008-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	ad0n	brian_herman	how would the syntax be ?
2008-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	mount <PATH OF FILE> <DIRECTORY WHERE YOU MOUNT>
2008-09-09T06:58:00.000Z	ad0n	brian_herman	once mounted, how can I see the device properties ? I mean the SN, model, etc
2008-09-09T06:59:00.000Z	ad0n	brian_herman	since it's a pendrive
2008-09-09T06:59:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	uh... i dont know
2008-09-09T07:00:00.000Z	ad0n		how can I see the device properties of a mounted USB image ? I mean the SN, model, etc
2008-09-09T07:00:00.000Z	ad0n		how can I see the device properties of a mounted USB image ? I mean the SN, model, etc
2008-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	that information might just be on the Pendrive
2008-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	not on the image
2008-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	ad0n	brian_herman	that's the problem. I don't have the pendrive
2008-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	i dont think that is possible
2008-09-09T07:02:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	without the pendrive
2008-09-09T07:02:00.000Z	ad0n		ok
2008-09-09T07:02:00.000Z	brian_herman	ad0n	that information is not on the image just raw data
