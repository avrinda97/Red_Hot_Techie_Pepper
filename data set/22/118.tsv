2012-07-02T01:09:00.000Z	harrrismrubin		what is lubuntu
2012-07-02T01:10:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	it is an ubuntu spin which uses lxde
2012-07-02T01:10:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	very lightweight
2012-07-02T01:12:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	he meant ubuntu lite as in very light resources.
2012-07-02T01:15:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	im not sure if you would have to root your android to install ubuntu.
2012-07-02T01:17:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	to install ubuntu onto your android device you will actually be running ubuntu in a seperate app then using a vnc client to connect to the running vnc server in ubuntu.

2012-07-02T01:21:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	everything i have rooted i have been able to do very easy usually with a one-click program.
2012-07-02T01:22:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	register your nick
2012-07-02T01:26:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	i honestly dont see much of a point in running ubuntu on your android tablet unless you have a specific use to do so.
2012-07-02T01:27:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	mostly for the nerd factor of "Hey i have ubuntu running on my android"
2012-07-02T01:29:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	if all you want to do is have your music from you computer on your tablet you can just copy them over through your usb cable
2012-07-02T01:37:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	to a sudo apt-get update first
2012-07-02T01:47:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	openssh-server
2012-07-02T01:53:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	yes thats it
2012-07-02T01:53:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	it won't it is not a graphical program
2012-07-02T01:55:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	install andftp on your tablet
2012-07-02T01:57:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	type in your ubuntu's ip address
2012-07-02T01:58:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	host name == ip address or name of your ubuntu system
2012-07-02T02:05:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	open a terminal and type hostname
2012-07-02T02:28:00.000Z	fe80	harrrismrubin	goto #android to ask about rooting your android
