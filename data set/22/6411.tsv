2006-10-29T06:31:00.000Z	Bacon5o	variant	how long does it take ubuntu to resize a partition?
2006-10-29T06:31:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	depends on the partiiton size and amount of datat
2006-10-29T06:31:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	depends on the partiiton size and amount of data
2006-10-29T06:32:00.000Z	Bacon5o	variant	yeah looks like 27.6GB of unallocated space
2006-10-29T06:32:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	under partitionmagic?
2006-10-29T06:34:00.000Z	Bacon5o	variant	how can I merge unallocated space to a current partition?
2006-10-29T06:34:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	i would use gpart or testdisk to fix the partition, you may well be able to recover all the lost data
2006-10-29T06:35:00.000Z	Bacon5o	variant	isnt lost data, just unallocated space of a harddrive
2006-10-29T06:35:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	ah, ffs.. thats not even a problem :)
2006-10-29T06:36:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	just resize the parititon and take up the remaining space
2006-10-29T06:36:00.000Z	Bacon5o	variant	I have it now...,whats the difference between a logical/primary partition?
2006-10-29T06:38:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	its a little complicated but you can have 4 primary parts and you can make one a logical partition which you can then sub partition
2006-10-29T06:38:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	if you need more than 4 partitions you can have 3 primary and one logical
2006-10-29T06:38:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	sorry, tats a crappy explanation :P
2006-10-29T06:39:00.000Z	Bacon5o	variant	well its asking me whether I should do a primary or a logical?
2006-10-29T06:39:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	what are you doing? you are creating a new parition, this is not what you want
2006-10-29T06:40:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	in the gparted on the ubuntu live cd you just resize the parititon to take up the free space
2006-10-29T06:40:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	other than telling you that i cant advise you any more because i am confused by the feedback your giving me :P
2006-10-29T06:43:00.000Z	Bacon5o	variant	this is the situation. I have a slave drive that is partitioned in two. How does this work if I partition another spot (say 10GB) for ubuntu
2006-10-29T06:44:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	you woul just resize one of the paritions leaving 10gb space and create a new empty parition in the empty space
2006-10-29T06:44:00.000Z	variant	Bacon5o	then select that parition in the installer under manual partitioning
