2011-03-28T06:45:00.000Z	b1lly		i just setup an apache web server, what do i have to look into to setup an ftp for the directories
2011-03-28T06:46:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	an ftp daemon
2011-03-28T06:47:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	that should work, maybe try 'ubuntu vsftpd' or 'ubuntu cuteftpd'
2011-03-28T06:47:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	i downloaded vsftpd and installed, i just dont know if i configured it at all lol
2011-03-28T06:48:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	vsftpd has many config options, not as much as apache, seems like you just need to read the man vsftpd.conf page
2011-03-28T09:07:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	create the uploads directory and then chown it to www-data
2011-03-28T09:09:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	the uploads dir is already www-data
2011-03-28T09:11:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	then you may need to chmod 0755 the directory, but that should be the default
2011-03-28T09:12:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	the chmod is 0777
2011-03-28T09:12:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	did you write this script yourself?
2011-03-28T09:15:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	yes, but you might already have it configured properly, did you write the script in question yourself? more then likely you have the path wrong
2011-03-28T09:15:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	i did write the script myself, it worked on my old web host
2011-03-28T09:16:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	what kind of return value do you get from move_uploaded_files?
2011-03-28T09:16:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	its got to be returning false whatever it is
2011-03-28T09:18:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	if its returning false, then chances are you need to adjust MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE and MAX_POST_SIZE in php.ini, do a phpinfo() to see what these limits are set as
2011-03-28T09:21:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	run phpinfo() it will tell you where the php.ini file is located
2011-03-28T09:21:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	says 2m
2011-03-28T09:21:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	try uploading a small file then
2011-03-28T09:22:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	cant i just change my php.ini to allow bigger file
2011-03-28T09:22:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	of course you can, but if you ccan upload a small file right now then your issue is resolved.
2011-03-28T09:23:00.000Z	b1lly	pfifo	right, I don't have a smaller one tho, has to be a certain format
2011-03-28T09:24:00.000Z	pfifo	b1lly	 set it to like 512M and dont forget the max_post_size as well, you will need to restart apache for settings to take effect, and then still double check what phpinfo() says
