2007-04-09T16:21:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	What kind of graphics card is in that Mini?
2007-04-09T16:22:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	Hold on, I'm doing some research on it, I'll let you know about your DVI problem. What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2007-04-09T16:23:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	6.10, I think (where would I look?)
2007-04-09T16:23:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	Well, what's the codename? 6.10 should be Edgy Eft
2007-04-09T16:26:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	Are you using the LiveCD or the alternate CD?
2007-04-09T16:27:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	I installed it from a live CD.
2007-04-09T16:27:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	So when you started the Live CD, did X and Gnome come up?
2007-04-09T16:28:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	interesting point, haven't tried that. I installed with a small VGA attached and then wanted to switch to a bigger DVI.
2007-04-09T16:40:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	I get no display at all when I boot the live CD and have the DVI attached
2007-04-09T16:40:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	so after you select the CD as your startup disk, you just get nothing from that point?
2007-04-09T16:41:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	I turn on the machine, press C to boot from CD and never get anything at all on the display
2007-04-09T16:41:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	Did you try holding Option to get the Open Firmware boot menu, then clicking on your CD?
2007-04-09T16:42:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	I know on this eMac it won't pick up the CD properly and just sits at a black screen until I restart it
2007-04-09T16:42:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	what would the Option key be?
2007-04-09T16:42:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	I mean on a non-apple keyboard
2007-04-09T16:43:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	according to my logitech keyboard, the windows key should function as option
2007-04-09T16:43:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	I take it you don't have your Apple keyboard anymore?
2007-04-09T16:44:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	never had one, mac mini came without one.
2007-04-09T16:45:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	Oh, okay. Well do a hard restart, and hold down the windows key before you hear the startup chime. You should then get a purplish screen that will load up all the available boot devices, one will be a CD with Tux on it, that being your Ubuntu CD. Before you do so, though, when you hold down C, can you hear activity from your CD drive?
2007-04-09T16:53:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	I can't seem to get it to work. The key of which I think it is the windows key (using a happy hacking keyboard) doesn't have any effect. :(
2007-04-09T16:54:00.000Z	Kendreague	doomster	Oh okay then... See the problem is, that PowerPC macs don't have a BIOS, they use the Open Firmware to configure everything. Ubuntu doesn't know how to read open firmware settings, so it's defaulting to VGA for default video output, whereas your open firmware would be set for DVI in Mac OS X. You need to parse a command to the kernel of Ubuntu that sets the DVI as your standard output, and I don't know how to do that, maybe someone
2007-04-09T16:55:00.000Z	doomster	Kendreague	that's a point, I'll see if google knows something. Also, the yaboot prompt said something about display problems....
