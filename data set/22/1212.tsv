2011-01-17T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	i'd use puppy, it'll be a lot smoother for you
2011-01-17T14:14:00.000Z	Eagle	ActionParsnip	Ya I would if I knew it. Im new to Linux and Ubuntu. Since windows screwed me. But you say it will work well, What version?
2011-01-17T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	5.2 is the latest stable
2011-01-17T14:15:00.000Z	Eagle	ActionParsnip	Ya I just need to access the net on it...
2011-01-17T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	puppy will do fine, or you can install XPUD, it boots faster than anything
2011-01-17T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	on low end system I'd usee arora or Midori
2011-01-17T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	i'd say so, firefox eats ram like mad

2011-01-17T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	sudo apt-get install clamtk

2011-01-24T21:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	tried the lexmark site?
2011-01-24T21:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Eagle	seems to work with the Â lexmark z42  driver. I suggest you avoid Lexmark, their Linux suport is very lacking but SOME printers are supported
