2006-05-03T05:22:00.000Z	DBO	Acidic	change inetd to standalone
2006-05-03T05:23:00.000Z	Acidic	DBO	Ok, why would that fix the problem.. is it cuz im running from CLI?
2006-05-03T05:23:00.000Z	DBO	Acidic	because inetd sucks for FTP?
2006-05-03T05:23:00.000Z	Acidic		heh

2006-05-03T05:24:00.000Z	DBO		do you have a VPN server already?
2006-05-03T05:24:00.000Z	Acidic	DBO	Is the ftp directory specified somewhere? Because i dont remember seeing it in the .conf file
2006-05-03T05:25:00.000Z	Acidic	DBO	: or is it the users home directory
2006-05-03T05:25:00.000Z	DBO	Acidic	I believe there is a DefaultRoot operator you can add in there to specify that
