2007-04-25T13:33:00.000Z	taime1_		eth0
2007-04-25T13:33:00.000Z	taime1_		i am definitely getting your messages now
2007-04-25T13:33:00.000Z	taime1_		ill try that
2007-04-25T13:34:00.000Z	taime1_		brb
2007-04-25T13:36:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	then it's not a wireless device, or doesn't have the driver loaded.
2007-04-25T13:37:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	'sudo iwconfig' perhaps the name for the device has changed for some strange reason?
2007-04-25T13:40:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	what is the card you have?
2007-04-25T13:41:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	'sudo modprobe -l | grep ipw'
2007-04-25T13:42:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	do you see ipw2200 or ipw3945?
2007-04-25T13:42:00.000Z	taime1_	delire	yes
2007-04-25T13:43:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	'lspci | grep Wireless' paste the line here
2007-04-25T13:45:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	can you paste the output of both 'sudo iwconfig' and 'sudo lsmod | grep ipw' in a pastebin for me?
2007-04-25T13:47:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	when you talk to people in IRC, you should use their name else they can't see you.
2007-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	according you seem to have a working wifi card afterall.
2007-04-25T13:49:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	sudo iwconfig eth1 essid <your ESSID here> key <your key here>
2007-04-25T13:50:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	if your key is an ascii key, use key s:someasciihey
2007-04-25T13:53:00.000Z	delire	taime1_	i think your card works, as Gumby said, you just haven't configured it properly i think.
