2010-05-12T02:42:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	which release are you running?
2010-05-12T02:46:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	kubuntu, dont know how to find out other then that
2010-05-12T02:46:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	open a terminal and type cat /etc/issue
2010-05-12T02:48:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	-bash: cat/etc/issue: No such file or directory
2010-05-12T02:49:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	try again, but copy my spacing. There is a space after the 'cat'. The spaces matter: cat /etc/issue
2010-05-12T02:50:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	Ubuntu 9.10 \n \l
2010-05-12T02:52:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	Well, I had good luck following this guide, but I dunno if it works for kubuntu 9.10: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/fix-for-all-pulseaudio-related-issues.html
2010-05-12T02:53:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	the tab is not the same as mine for system pref sound
2010-05-12T02:53:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	should i go back to regular ubuntu then? my session i think is in GNOME not kde
2010-05-12T02:55:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	try skipping the gui part that you don't have and follow the rest of the guide. The important bit is the part where you remove pulseaudio and install esound instead...
2010-05-12T02:57:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	thanks I did the terminal part of that seems to be only thing really i ca do
2010-05-12T02:58:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	worth a try. Does the aplay example work now?
2010-05-12T02:59:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	in class and i already had sound disrupt class lol will try in a few minutes
2010-05-12T02:59:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	the code for aplay is aplay -l?
2010-05-12T03:00:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	shame on you. Pay attention in class! The aplay command is aplay /usr/share/sounds/login.wav
2010-05-12T03:00:00.000Z	Loshki	kw	note space between the command and its argument, as before...
2010-05-12T03:01:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	ya sorry i know, just paying attention to class and doing this
2010-05-12T03:01:00.000Z	kw	Loshki	its okay thought cause they just caught up to me
