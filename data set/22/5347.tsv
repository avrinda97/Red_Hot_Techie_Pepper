2007-05-19T14:02:00.000Z	igmyzt		okay, thanks
2007-05-19T05:34:00.000Z	igmyzt		hey guys i have a quick question
2007-05-19T05:36:00.000Z	igmyzt		when i installed ubuntu, it never works with my radeon at first because it recognizes my intel integrated, so i turned the autodetect off and set it to only integrated, and now i want it on my radeon/big monitor, but the reconfigure thing puts it on the wrong refresh rate thing by deafult...
2007-05-19T05:37:00.000Z	digital_k	igmyzt	so i m clear, you have a machine with intel integrated graphics that also has an installed radeon card?
2007-05-19T05:38:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	correct, and im using the intel, and want to use the radeon
2007-05-19T05:38:00.000Z	digital_k	igmyzt	you should go into the BIOS and disable the onboard video I believe
2007-05-19T05:38:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	last time i tried the reconfigure, the monitor loaded and only said Incorrect Frequency
2007-05-19T05:39:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	my bios doesn't allow me to disable it, but that's not what i need to do. i need instructions on how to set the refresh rate /hz right
2007-05-19T05:41:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	i thought it would be 75 hz, but my friend said it should be 70....do you know? its a starlogic 19" on a radeon 9250
2007-05-19T05:42:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	restricted being the junky ones off ati.com?
2007-05-19T05:42:00.000Z	digital_k	igmyzt	go to system>amdinistration>restricted drivers manager
2007-05-19T05:43:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	it said my hardware doesnt need them...but that's probly because my radeon is disabled from bios
2007-05-19T05:44:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	if i enable it, ubuntu will try to load off it and give me a blue x.org/xserver error for no visual input
2007-05-19T05:44:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	ill enable when i know what i need to do, then reboot and do alt+f1, and reconfigure x.org
2007-05-19T05:46:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	still there?
2007-05-19T05:48:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	can you suggest anything?
2007-05-19T05:49:00.000Z	digital_k	igmyzt	you say you want to use the radeon, however you cannot do that with it disabled in BIOS.
2007-05-19T05:49:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	yes, i know this. I can't enable it until i know how to install the drivers by reconfiguring x.org
2007-05-19T05:50:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	im having a problem with the refresh rate
2007-05-19T05:51:00.000Z	digital_k	igmyzt	here is a thread at ubuntuforums you may be interested in: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=418252
2007-05-19T05:53:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	im looking more for monitor help
2007-05-19T05:53:00.000Z	igmyzt	digital_k	when you reconfigure x.org it asks for the monitor model, and it considers this monitor to be generic, and i dont know the refresh rate to use it
