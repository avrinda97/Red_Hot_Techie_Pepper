2008-08-07T00:57:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	what do you suggest?
2008-08-07T00:57:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	Did you right-click the file and choose open with VLC?
2008-08-07T00:59:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	 well, I just did and it doesnt do anything... just when you press play it blinks and return to normal position
2008-08-07T01:00:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	you are sure the file is not corrupt?
2008-08-07T01:01:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	yup... I copied into a windows comp and it worked
2008-08-07T01:02:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	hateball, just if it help to troubleshoot IM using ubuntu hardy 8.04... Im using 2 laptopts with ubuntu and both same problem with some audio files... not corrupted files IM SURE
2008-08-07T01:03:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	Are you familiar with the terminal? Could you run "file" on it? "file file.asf"
2008-08-07T01:04:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	never heard of that program.... let me try
2008-08-07T01:04:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	the file command identifies what filetype it is (if it knows about it)
2008-08-07T01:05:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	MICROSOFT ASF
2008-08-07T01:07:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	ah, I had hoped it would also show what encoding it was :/
2008-08-07T01:07:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	no it only says MICROSOFT ASF thats all....
2008-08-07T01:12:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	I hope you are still there
2008-08-07T01:13:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	I am.
2008-08-07T01:14:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	If it's an asf-container it should have the extention .asf or possibly .wma if it is windows media audio.
2008-08-07T01:15:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	mmm I sent you hateball  and geirha the file so you can see
2008-08-07T01:16:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	hm, just says "stalled" on me. Not sure what is wrong.
2008-08-07T01:17:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	you want me to send it agian?
2008-08-07T01:18:00.000Z	geirha	dianapo	We can see if hateball can figure out how to play it first :)
2008-08-07T01:18:00.000Z	dianapo	geirha	hahha okay thanks!
