2004-11-27T08:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	sorry, what do you mean?
2004-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	ctrl-alt-F* does nothing?
2004-11-27T08:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	don't you get a white prompt on a black background?
2004-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	acecase	thoreauputic	i get white text through about half of the boot process but sometime before i get a login prompt it gets real dark
2004-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	:(
2004-11-27T08:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	maybe try sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-data
2004-11-27T08:38:00.000Z	acecase	thoreauputic	thanks for the try :) it just offered to change my keymap
2004-12-28T12:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	sudo -s
2004-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	good luck with your config files :/
2004-12-28T12:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	why not alias them?
2004-12-28T12:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	OK that's useful
2004-12-28T12:45:00.000Z	acecase	thoreauputic	:) thanks but i almost NEVER enable gdm. i wrote the script, did ./gdm-startup remove and have never used it again :)
2004-12-28T12:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	for instance I have alias aterm='aterm +sb -tr -sh 80 -rv'
2004-12-28T12:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	yes, for some things - scripts are better for bigger stuff
2004-12-28T12:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	you could probably still alias those but I doubt it's worth it
2004-12-28T12:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	of course - where have you been *grin*
2004-12-28T12:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	I've seen unix gurus from the 70s say " I didn't know you could do that!"
2004-12-28T12:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	*nix is endless learning
2004-12-28T12:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	acecase	exactly
