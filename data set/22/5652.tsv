2007-12-23T08:54:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	flash works in 64 bit too :)
2007-12-23T08:55:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	true
2007-12-23T08:56:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	it should support 64 bit
2007-12-23T08:57:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	lol.. what do you wanna know?
2007-12-23T08:58:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	just install ubuntu-restricted-extras from synaptic
2007-12-23T08:58:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	which soundcard do you have?
2007-12-23T08:59:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	lspci | grep audio
2007-12-23T08:59:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	paste it at pastebin.com and give link here
2007-12-23T09:01:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	how mane lines is it?
2007-12-23T09:01:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	its pastebin.com you can also try pastebin.ca
2007-12-23T09:03:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	lol! run that command at the terminal, and paste the _output_ on pastebin.ca :P
2007-12-23T09:04:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	hmm.. that means your card isnt being detected by the kernel
2007-12-23T09:05:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	i think that has the intel HD audio card.. which isnt supported well by gutsy.. you could try compiling a newer kernel
2007-12-23T09:06:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	follow what IndyGunFreak said
2007-12-23T09:07:00.000Z	kalpik	sam_	yea.. that's the HD Audio controller
