2010-04-05T23:50:00.000Z	deightm		but it keeps taking me to login screen in gui mode
2010-04-05T23:50:00.000Z	deightm		because i added self made script to autostart
2010-04-05T23:50:00.000Z	deightm		using gui autistart manager
2010-04-05T23:51:00.000Z	deightm		i have added that script myself
2010-04-05T23:51:00.000Z	deightm		it simply adds new resolution
2010-04-05T23:51:00.000Z	deightm		but it resulted in me being unable to log in
2010-04-05T23:51:00.000Z	deightm		how to boot in safe mode?
2010-04-05T23:51:00.000Z	deightm		less than 1 day linux user
2010-04-05T23:52:00.000Z	deightm		i know how to boot in recovery mode
2010-04-05T23:52:00.000Z	deightm		is that it?
2010-04-05T23:52:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	simple explanation remove the script from command line cd [folder path] > rm [script name]
2010-04-05T23:48:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	what do you mean you're unable to login? did you forget you pass...?
2010-04-05T23:49:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	did you forget your password, can you explain indepth?
2010-04-05T23:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	you can login from terminal but not gui and your saying its due to a bad startup scrip whcih I dont know how you figured that out
2010-04-05T23:52:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	for resolution you dont need scripts xorg.conf will do that for you
2010-04-05T23:53:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	like I said xorg.conf will do that for you once it is set
2010-04-05T23:53:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	there sin't by default but you can create one and it will read from there
2010-04-05T23:54:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	read what I told you make one in /etc/X11/
2010-04-05T23:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	no worries at least you know how to fix the problem, remember ubutnu is a machine it just does what you tell it, it wont stop you from doing errors, we all thought the same way as you, youll get used to it
2010-04-06T00:00:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	stick to xorg believe me you'll have better luck getting the system running with it specially since there are so many exmaples online you may even find a premade xorg for your motherboard
2010-04-06T00:02:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	what are you trying to do?
2010-04-06T00:03:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	deightm	the same script that messed your system?
