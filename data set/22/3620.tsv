2008-07-19T07:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	just use gparted in the installer disk no need for bootit ng (never heard of it and not recommended here)
2008-07-19T07:31:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	where do I get gparted from?
2008-07-19T07:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	it is on the live cd; also you can use the manual partitioning scheme in the installer process
2008-07-19T07:33:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	oh that. when I chose the manual option the "make new partition" bit was grayed out... :/ is it posible for you to guide me through the process if I find a differenct computer for irc?
2008-07-19T07:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	you are using gparted on mounted partitions? or going through a live cd environment to do so
2008-07-19T07:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	that would be the reason then; do you have the ubuntu live cd? or is this through wubi
2008-07-19T07:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	you run the installer, then get to the guided partitioning section and then it fails?
2008-07-19T07:39:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	yes
2008-07-19T07:39:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	and it just goes back to the livecd desktop or what
2008-07-19T07:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	that was an A or B question, you have to choose one
2008-07-19T07:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	and you did md5 the iso and did integrity check on the installer disk? Also, what speed did you burn the iso to cd at.
2008-07-19T07:42:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	i burned it at 4x, did a nero intefrity check, and then did the ubunto verifying thing.. it passed all of them. no errors.
2008-07-19T07:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	and now you are trying to manually or use the guided partitioner (which one)
2008-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	i tried to use the guided one, thats when the error came.
2008-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	you fiddled with the slider, or left it as ubuntu suggested
2008-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	I fiddled with it.. giving ubuntu 12gb of partition
2008-07-19T07:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	this is a dual boot or ubuntu only
2008-07-19T07:45:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	i want/need it to be dual boot.
2008-07-19T07:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	you backed up the important stuff from windows? also, are you going to have a separate /home partition? if the manual partitioner in the installer disk is giving you fits you may wish to dl the gparted live cd and do it from there
2008-07-19T07:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	you need to exercise great care when doing it however
2008-07-19T07:49:00.000Z	Guest101	bazhang	yeah... all backed up. I just want to partitions.. One for ubuntu and one for vista.. i think it was me thta is makking the normal manual partitioner have a fit.. :/
2008-07-19T07:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest101	you can certainly try; the gparted live cd is fairly intuitive but partitioning can be fairly intimidating for newer users
