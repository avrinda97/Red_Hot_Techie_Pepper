2009-07-09T00:21:00.000Z	deany	konza	you need to run the php file to install something?  like a forum?
2009-07-09T00:22:00.000Z	konza	deany	yup, i need to install drupal
2009-07-09T00:22:00.000Z	deany	konza	so you need a lamp setup then
2009-07-09T00:22:00.000Z	konza	deany	 i am having apache2 installed
2009-07-09T00:23:00.000Z	konza	deany	not only apache2 but also mysql, and php,
2009-07-09T00:23:00.000Z	deany	konza	I dont know what drupal tbh, but sounds like you need to run a lamp server
2009-07-09T00:24:00.000Z	deany	konza	sudo tasksel install lamp-server
2009-07-09T00:25:00.000Z	konza	deany	if there is apache server then there is no need to install lamp.......
2009-07-09T00:25:00.000Z	deany	konza	so does it need mysql as well as php and apache then
2009-07-09T00:25:00.000Z	deany	konza	I`d assume it does
2009-07-09T00:25:00.000Z	konza	deany	 yup
2009-07-09T00:25:00.000Z	deany	konza	 aka LAMP
2009-07-09T00:26:00.000Z	konza	deany	 didnt get u
2009-07-09T00:26:00.000Z	konza	deany	 drupal is a content management system
2009-07-09T00:27:00.000Z	deany	konza	sudo tasksel install lamp-server   and job done..
2009-07-09T00:29:00.000Z	konza	deany	 if there are more than one server in one machine... it will create probs.... i had installed lamp before... but it didnt work fine... later i switched to apache
2009-07-09T00:29:00.000Z	deany	konza	 its a metapackage for apache, mysql and php
2009-07-09T00:31:00.000Z	konza	deany	 i know that... but when i installed it before, i had experienced some probms and wasted a hole day before that
2009-07-09T00:31:00.000Z	deany	konza	i installed it fine, and have 3 different sites running fine.
2009-07-09T00:32:00.000Z	deany	konza	you seem to think its something different to what you installed, its not.  it`ll install apache2 and php5 and mysql and all the libs needed for them to work together.
2009-07-09T00:33:00.000Z	deany	konza	I have a forum thats installed with a php file.. ok
2009-07-09T00:33:00.000Z	konza	deany	i know that, dude.  but..
