2007-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	kalorin		damn business just will NOT let us migrate off that old crappy code
2007-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	kalorin		what can you do?
2007-02-26T12:01:00.000Z	kalorin		ok so why is everyone so impressed with vmware with this qemu is so easy to set up?
2007-02-26T12:01:00.000Z	kalorin		i don't get it?
2007-02-26T12:02:00.000Z	kalorin		eh?
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	kalorin		supaplex? qemu doesn't like that I guess?
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	kalorin		well vmware is a nightmare of lib issues right now it seems for 6.10
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	kalorin		6.06 might work I guesss
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	kalorin		not sure
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	kalorin		every fix I tried got it a little closer and then I ran out of fixes
2007-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 it is?  it installed fine for me...
2007-02-26T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	yes.
2007-02-26T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 i do tend to install all sorts of extra things - but i got it running fine.
2007-02-26T12:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 i just run the 'vmware' command.. H.,,,
2007-02-26T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	i dont even have vmware-server-console :) i may of not installed that part
2007-02-26T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 oh wait 'vmware' runs vnware-server-console.
2007-02-26T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 you did run that vmware configuration script?
2007-02-26T12:19:00.000Z	kalorin	Dr_willis	ok it did come with this error in the config:
2007-02-26T12:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 thats trivial.. means it dident cfigure out how to make the vmware icon in the menus
2007-02-26T12:24:00.000Z	kalorin	Dr_willis	does yours then go into another management interface configurator? vmware-config-mui.pl
2007-02-26T12:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 i dont have a vmware-config-mui.pl
2007-02-26T12:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kalorin	 you may of installed somthing else i never installed.
