2011-12-24T17:27:00.000Z	llutz	m477	http://templates.services.openoffice.org
2011-12-24T17:28:00.000Z	m477	llutz	and how i will find it ^_^
2011-12-24T17:28:00.000Z	llutz	m477	try searching, like http://templates.services.openoffice.org/en/node/4755
2011-12-24T17:29:00.000Z	llutz	m477	once you've found something similar, you customize it
2011-12-24T17:29:00.000Z	llutz	m477	more help in #Openoffice.org
2011-12-24T17:29:00.000Z	m477	llutz	there is just 3 pages
2011-12-24T17:33:00.000Z	llutz	m477	there is, its called TeX
2011-12-24T17:34:00.000Z	m477	llutz	learning that probably will take more time then writing that i want to
2011-12-24T17:34:00.000Z	llutz	m477	but once learned it, you'll never want to use something like word/openoffice/libreoffice again
2011-12-24T17:35:00.000Z	m477	llutz	i doubt cause it is one time thing to do
2011-12-24T17:38:00.000Z	llutz	m477	btw according the example template i  showed you: ever heard about copying a page? Do you really think, they will create a book-template covering 800 blank pages?
2011-12-24T17:39:00.000Z	m477	llutz	I see what you mean
2011-12-24T17:42:00.000Z	m477	llutz	maybe now Iam abit over sensitived  but this example didnt look like 'professional' template
2011-12-24T17:43:00.000Z	llutz	m477	it was an example, there are more templates. you easily can customize them... did you ever tried to manage things on your own?
2011-12-24T17:44:00.000Z	m477	llutz	no
2011-12-24T17:44:00.000Z	m477	llutz	i dont like cope with OO
