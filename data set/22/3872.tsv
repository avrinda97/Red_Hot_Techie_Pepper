2008-07-07T17:35:00.000Z	joaopinto		ops, i meant BoltClock
2008-07-07T17:35:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	Bogaurd: :P
2008-10-31T14:36:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	the mirror you are using is probably overloaded
2008-10-31T14:36:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	switch to a different mirror
2008-10-31T14:37:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	other mirrors take ages - do i really have to? also, when i try to ping for those files i seem to get 404s. is this also caused by server overload?
2008-10-31T14:38:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	yes
2008-10-31T14:38:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	hmm ok
2008-10-31T14:38:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	that mirror does not take ages, because the connections die :)
2008-10-31T14:39:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	doesnt take ages because i live where that is :/
2008-12-09T16:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	there are no 2.0 packages for hardy as far as I know
2008-12-09T16:58:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	do i then have to compile from source?
2008-12-09T16:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	I guess so
2008-12-09T17:01:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	mono's site mentions the package mono-2.0-devel, think its better to apt-get install that or compile?
2008-12-09T17:02:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	if it's available on the repositories, apt-get it, if not, you will need to build form source
2009-04-23T17:35:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	unless you reported the problem and followed up it's resolution, you will just know by testing...
2009-04-23T17:35:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	i never did resolve it... sigh
2009-04-23T17:45:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	is this something like incase a last minute update or whatever gets dropped in there?
2009-04-23T17:46:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	yes, that's is why is a bad practice to assume something is released before it is announced, also because of mirroring concerns
2009-04-23T17:48:00.000Z	BoltClock	joaopinto	hmm yeah, like some projects like phpBB that keep a release as RC unless they can finally safely promote it to gold?
2009-04-23T17:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	BoltClock	right
