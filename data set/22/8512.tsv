2007-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	variant	astro76	where do you do that graphically? i have never seen that ability in gnome (set mount points
2007-08-11T11:42:00.000Z	astro76	variant	right click drive icon>properties> drive or volume tab, expand the settings
2007-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	variant	astro76	which drive icon? is that on the desktop?
2007-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	astro76	variant	yes
2007-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	variant	astro76	ah, i disabled that a long time ago and it doesn't seem to apply to any of the other drive icon locations :P
2007-08-11T11:44:00.000Z	astro76	variant	not extremely user friendly yet, and if you screw up, you have to go in gconf under /system/storage and delete or fix what you did
2007-08-11T11:51:00.000Z	variant	astro76	ah, i see what you mean. what issues did you say there were with it?
2007-08-11T11:52:00.000Z	astro76	variant	there's no info for what to do for so it would be troublesome for beginners. For example you would think you put /media/whatever for mount point, but that doesn't work, you just put whatever
2007-08-11T11:53:00.000Z	variant	astro76	lol
2007-08-11T11:53:00.000Z	astro76	variant	then it won't mount, and the only way to fix it is in gconf
2007-08-11T11:53:00.000Z	variant	astro76	yeah
2007-08-11T11:53:00.000Z	variant	astro76	still, nice that the mount point functionality is getting a bit more graphical
2007-08-11T11:54:00.000Z	astro76	variant	indeed it is very nice
2007-08-11T11:54:00.000Z	variant	astro76	i don't think that the ! ops bot command is really for that
2007-08-11T12:06:00.000Z	variant	astro76	what is the format for entering mount options as it will nolonger mount and i just put users,noauto in the options feild
2007-08-11T12:07:00.000Z	variant	astro76	:)
2007-08-11T12:07:00.000Z	astro76	variant	I also tried unsuccessfully to add a users option
2007-08-11T12:07:00.000Z	variant	astro76	now it doesn't mount :) ho hum, i can see this causing problems for a lot of noob users
2007-08-11T12:07:00.000Z	astro76	variant	exec and noexec work, not sure why user doesn't
2007-08-11T12:08:00.000Z	variant	astro76	in the options feild i put exactly "users,noauto" and in gconf i can see "[users\,noauto] " so perhaps it doesn't like the ","
2007-08-11T12:09:00.000Z	astro76	variant	oh yeah, spaces not commas
2007-08-11T12:09:00.000Z	variant	astro76	nice, it could easilly warn of that
