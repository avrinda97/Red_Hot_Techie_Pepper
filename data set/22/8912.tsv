2012-10-05T17:42:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	boot menu at startup?  don't you get a menu appear where you can press down key to select the windwos boot?
2012-10-05T17:43:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	when you start up,  there should be a GRUB screen where you get a list of operating systems to start
2012-10-05T17:48:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	i can t say i've seen that error... looking it up...
2012-10-05T17:48:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	heheh could of coures recover image backup  or install windows in a virtual machine.  not sure.
2012-10-05T17:49:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	so 12.10 beta  buggy and breaks it?
2012-10-05T17:49:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	try installing 12.04.1 lts instead
2012-10-05T17:49:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	and see if it creates working grub2 menu
2012-10-05T17:49:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	beta-testing should be discussed in #ubuntu+1  channel instead
2012-10-05T17:50:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	well it may just be the boot menu is broken.
2012-10-05T17:50:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	TRY FIRST  install 12.04.1 LTS instead, and see if that creates a working boot menu
2012-10-05T17:50:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	TRY FIRST  install 12.04.1 LTS instead, and see if that creates a working GRUB menu <<<<<--------------
2012-10-05T17:51:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	the problem is installing different version of the grub scripts that might actually work
2012-10-05T17:52:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	did you use a boot-cd to install from etc.?
2012-10-05T17:52:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	grub2 is compiled via a pile of scripts, OS-finder tool, etc.   if the version in 12.10  is being silly, try 12.04.1 ?
2012-10-05T17:55:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	yes, do that, and it will use 12.04.1 's stuff to create a new grub2 menu,  with any luck that will fix it
2012-10-05T17:55:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	or mint-13  which is also based on 12.04  it doesn't really matter
2012-10-05T17:56:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	but NOT the BETA-TESTING 12.10 !
2012-10-05T17:56:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	if it doesn't work,  use the restore-cd mechanism from your computer manufacturer
2012-10-05T17:58:00.000Z	enyc	shabnam	this is all software stuffs, not system hardware
