2012-08-28T01:31:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		well i like angelina joe lee and never touched her so i guess it makes sense..
2012-08-28T01:32:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		oh cool - can he go to where people understand it at?
2012-08-28T01:33:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		i only know english and bad english
2012-08-28T01:33:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		whammy
2012-08-28T01:35:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		upstart?
2012-08-28T01:36:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		nope
2012-08-28T01:37:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		did ubuntu ever have an equivalent to chckconfig?
2012-08-28T01:37:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		chkconfig*
2012-08-28T01:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		despite usage of upstart i still see all services are not migrated over to upstart and probably never will be, i always had to install chkconfig out of band - do they have anything that just prints what starts when?
2012-08-28T01:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		thats not a red hat port?
2012-08-28T01:38:00.000Z	mongo	SolarisBoy	chkconfig just makes sym links to the rc?.d directories
2012-08-28T01:39:00.000Z	mongo	SolarisBoy	for upstart services you need to modify the events
2012-08-28T01:39:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	mongo	thats not quite what i mean
2012-08-28T01:39:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	mongo	so i get the difference, definately,,
2012-08-28T01:39:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	mongo	my thing is that all services are not upstart
2012-08-28T01:40:00.000Z	mongo	SolarisBoy	upstart starts legacy init jobs too
2012-08-28T01:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	mongo	how would you tell what "possible" order that it would start in (without looking at the number on the link)?
2012-08-28T01:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	mongo	so now again my question..
2012-08-28T01:40:00.000Z	mongo	SolarisBoy	you have to walk through, it is not well documented
2012-08-28T01:42:00.000Z	mongo	SolarisBoy	man upstart-events will help you a lot
2012-08-28T01:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	mongo	im aware of those but its a tail chase
2012-08-28T01:43:00.000Z	mongo	SolarisBoy	run levels dont' really exist
