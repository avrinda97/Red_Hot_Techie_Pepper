2007-08-23T07:52:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	don't worry about it :)
2007-08-23T07:52:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	execept i can't access winecfg or uninstaller because of it.. i just get that in the output and wine dies
2007-08-23T07:53:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	i've never gotten any errors with wine before... i was installing guild wars and everything froze on me so i restarded kde and this is what happends
2007-08-23T07:54:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	you are running winecfg from terminal?
2007-08-23T07:54:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	yeah
2007-08-23T07:55:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	hmm im getting that error too but winecfg runs anyway...
2007-08-23T07:56:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	well winecfg doesnt run when i type it in.. i get 6 lines of error output after the ALSA one, also wine uninstaller won't uninstall apps while it was working, now it won't even run.. it just gives the same error output as winecfg
2007-08-23T07:56:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	what are the other 6 lines?
2007-08-23T07:56:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	do you want me to pastebin?
2007-08-23T07:57:00.000Z	Erythro		sure
2007-08-23T07:58:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	ok here you go: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34736/
2007-08-23T08:00:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	are you using the latest wine?
2007-08-23T08:00:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	yup
2007-08-23T08:04:00.000Z	vip3rousmango		Ok what does this error mean? X Error of failed request: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
2007-08-23T08:05:00.000Z	vip3rousmango		haha
2007-08-23T08:06:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	did you change any funky settings in winecfg before?
2007-08-23T08:06:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	funky settings? no. only turning windows emulatuion from on to off...
2007-08-23T08:07:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	you could try to rename your .wine folder to something else and run winecfg.. this should create a fresh .wine folder
2007-08-23T08:07:00.000Z	vip3rousmango		ahh genious
2007-08-23T08:09:00.000Z	Erythro	vip3rousmango	keep in mind that anything you installed in the fake c drive is in the old .wine folder
2007-08-23T08:09:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Erythro	ok, that worked.. now what? I just copy the files back over into the new wine folder?
