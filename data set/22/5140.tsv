2007-07-25T08:12:00.000Z	godofredo	craigbass1976	/
2007-07-25T08:12:00.000Z	craigbass1976	godofredo	so ls /

2007-07-25T08:13:00.000Z	craigbass1976	godofredo	then  if /enemy-territory/ is there, ls /enemy-territory/

2007-07-25T08:14:00.000Z	craigbass1976	godofredo	Then you can't very well copy files from it
2007-07-25T08:19:00.000Z	godofredo	craigbass1976	it was the home directory that i had wrong....thank you for your help
2007-07-25T08:19:00.000Z	craigbass1976	godofredo	so it was /home/godofredo/blahblah?
2007-07-25T08:20:00.000Z	godofredo	craigbass1976	yeah
2007-07-25T08:20:00.000Z	craigbass1976	godofredo	I thought so.  You shouldn't have write privs for / and I doubted that setting up a game would have done that
2007-07-25T08:21:00.000Z	godofredo	craigbass1976	you were correct, gracias.
