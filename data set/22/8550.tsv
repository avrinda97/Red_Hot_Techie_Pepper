2006-11-29T13:47:00.000Z	we2by		I need help with my sound
2006-11-29T13:48:00.000Z	we2by		when I press on volume up (keyboard), it doesn't do anything.
2006-11-29T13:48:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	are you using gnome?
2006-11-29T13:49:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	go to System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts and set the volume up and down buttons in there
2006-11-29T13:49:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	it is set
2006-11-29T13:49:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	and it still doesnt work? how many sound cards do you have?
2006-11-29T13:49:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	when I press on the key, it is showing the volume going down, but it is not doing it right
2006-11-29T13:49:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	two
2006-11-29T13:49:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	do you use both>?
2006-11-29T13:50:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	I use one of them
2006-11-29T13:52:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	if you dont use the other cant u either take it out or if its onboard then just disable it in the bios
2006-11-29T13:58:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	my sound works, but the keyboard volume control is not doing it right
2006-11-29T13:58:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	if you dont use the other sound card you may as well disable/remove it just to stop it getting complicated
2006-11-29T13:59:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	I think it is disabled
2006-11-29T13:59:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	if it turns up in alsamixer then it isnt - thats the test
2006-11-29T14:00:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	I dunno, but I have several options to lower the volume. lemme take a screenshot
2006-11-29T14:01:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	maybe cause I'm using oss and alsa?
2006-11-29T14:01:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	yes - no point in having both
2006-11-29T14:01:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	http://img47.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotvm7.png
2006-11-29T14:02:00.000Z	we2by	HumanPrototype	should I uninstall it
2006-11-29T14:02:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	no - just disable it if you can
2006-12-02T17:13:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	we2by	just press alt+F2 and type in that
