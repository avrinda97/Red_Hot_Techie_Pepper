2011-09-22T01:12:00.000Z	yeats	devish	not sure what you're asking...
2011-09-22T01:14:00.000Z	devish	yeats	i am not asking anything just i am worried see this http://kernel.org/
2011-09-22T01:14:00.000Z	devish	yeats	and also this linux.com
2011-09-22T01:14:00.000Z	yeats	devish	that issue doesn't really have anything to do with Ubuntu - kernel.org (as you mentioned) was compromised...
2011-09-22T01:15:00.000Z	devish	yeats	but for me ubuntu is after linux
