2009-10-17T17:41:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_		but don't you have to tell what folder to share or not?
2009-10-17T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		or use the 'sshfs' command line tool
2009-10-17T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShapeShifter499_	 for ssh. it can access anything the user can access
2009-10-17T17:41:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_		ok
2009-10-17T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShapeShifter499_	 its not samba :)

2009-10-17T17:44:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_		SWEET!!! :D
2009-10-17T17:44:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_		it works
2009-10-17T17:46:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	now do I have to have openssh-server installed on the computer that is receiving the files?
2009-10-17T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		hmm... cant say i ever rried just the clients installed. I always install openssh server on every box :)
2009-10-17T17:47:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	so I won't mess up anything if I "sudo apt-get purge openssh-server" ?
2009-10-17T17:49:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	is it safe, in the sense of hacking, to keep openssh-sever?
2009-10-17T17:50:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	password to my computer?
2009-10-17T17:51:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499_	grawity	my pass is 9 characters long is that good? and I never had to port forward to use bittorent
2009-10-17T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ShapeShifter499_	 many torrent clients and ruters can auto-forward as needed. :)
