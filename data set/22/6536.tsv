2006-09-29T13:50:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	try installing it in the console. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xmms . if it spits out errors, paste them to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-09-29T13:57:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25227/
2006-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	that's very odd, since it's in main...what's your architecture?
2006-09-29T14:01:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	just i386
2006-09-29T14:01:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	yeah, it should definitely exist...i don't know why it doesn't
2006-09-29T14:02:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	would there be another channel or place I could check/ask (thank you very much for the help so far)
2006-09-29T14:02:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	this is pretty much it...let me check your pastebin again.
2006-09-29T14:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	would you please paste your sources.list to pastebin?
2006-09-29T14:06:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	where would I find the source.list file?
2006-09-29T14:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	/etc/apt/sources.list
2006-09-29T14:07:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25232/
2006-09-29T14:08:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	oh so should I uncomment those lines?
2006-09-29T14:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	just a sec...let me show you what to do :-)
2006-09-29T14:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25234/
2006-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	thank you again
2006-09-29T14:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	no problem! i hope that works for you
2006-09-29T14:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	it seems that the problem was you were only getting the source repositories
2006-09-29T14:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	which means that you would've had to manually install it all
2006-09-29T14:30:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	its working perfectly, people like you will make the ubuntu project work. Thanks.
2006-09-29T14:30:00.000Z	ladydoor	Armstrong80	awwwww...thanks! i'm not really part of the project, but thank you!
2006-09-29T14:31:00.000Z	Armstrong80	ladydoor	You were today.
