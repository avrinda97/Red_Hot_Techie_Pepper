2005-06-12T16:12:00.000Z	trygvebw	bob2	No idea, i just have a program that needs it.

2005-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	no
2005-06-23T09:35:00.000Z	trygvebw	bob2	are you sure? :/ because i installed initng and it works fine but apt-get says a lot of stuff about wrong libc6 version installed :(
2005-06-23T09:35:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	so, "don't do that"
2005-06-23T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	the package may happen to work, mostly, but it really Depends on stuff for a reason
2005-06-23T09:36:00.000Z	trygvebw	bob2	Well... The problem is, that it's a package for Debian. I've used it for many days and it works complely fine. The Ubuntu libc is compitable...
2005-06-23T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	no, it's not, sorry
2005-06-23T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	if you want that package on ubuntu, rebuild it from source
2005-06-23T09:38:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	so, if you want it to work, you'll need to rebuild it from source
2005-06-23T09:38:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	libjpeg62-dev
2005-06-23T09:41:00.000Z	trygvebw	bob2	fglrx works fine with 9000
2005-09-10T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	trygvebw	yes
