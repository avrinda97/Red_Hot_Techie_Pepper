2009-02-03T08:12:00.000Z	rashed2020		My box isn't accepting SSH connections.. Any help?
2009-02-03T08:12:00.000Z	rashed2020		Clean install
2009-02-03T08:12:00.000Z	rashed2020		installed openssh-server
2009-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	rashed2020		ufw enable and then ufw allow 22
2009-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	turning on a firewall is usually not the best solution for networking issues
2009-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	are you sure sshd is running?
2009-02-03T08:18:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	if it is a home network, static addressing shouldn't be difficult
2009-05-22T12:29:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	yes, if that is how PAM is configured (default)
2009-05-22T12:30:00.000Z	rashed2020	Titan8990	So if ejabberd uses PAM authentication, that means I don't have to create and maintain another set of usernames?
2009-05-22T12:30:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	correct
2009-07-22T03:26:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	if anywhere /var/log/messages as part of syslog
2009-07-22T03:28:00.000Z	rashed2020	Titan8990	yep. Found it in /var/log/syslog. Should've just grepped for it.
2009-07-22T03:30:00.000Z	rashed2020	Titan8990	any idea how I can have it log to a separate file?
2009-07-22T03:31:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	/var/log/messages is the main system logger and is intended that you use grep
2009-07-22T03:31:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	you would need to write a script that parses it and pulls out the information you need
2009-07-22T03:32:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	i recommend a static IP anyways
2009-07-22T03:32:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	everytime your machine boots a lot of the time is spent waiting on DHCP
2009-07-22T03:33:00.000Z	rashed2020	Titan8990	it's for a sysadmin class I'm doing. I need to get syslog-ng to capture all dhclient messages to a separate file and make sure the original messages don't go to /var/log/syslog. Can you help or would that be too much to ask?
2009-07-22T03:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	no, you should do it yourself
2009-07-22T03:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	look into the configuration for the system logger
2009-07-22T03:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	rashed2020	likely syslog-ng
2009-07-22T03:34:00.000Z	rashed2020	Titan8990	perfect. That's all I needed. I was stumped and didn't know where to look.
