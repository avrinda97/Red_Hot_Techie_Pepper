2011-06-30T00:00:00.000Z	chris_99		hi, is there anyway to stop ubuntu moving the selected window to the next workspace
2011-06-30T00:02:00.000Z	chris_99		this is on ubuntu 11, seems to have just started doing it
2011-06-30T00:04:00.000Z	chris_99		i'm really confused why its doing it, as 'only on this workspace'
2011-06-30T00:04:00.000Z	chris_99		is selected
2011-06-30T00:06:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	Do you know what "workspace" means?
2011-06-30T00:06:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	You porbably have at least 2 workspaces.  You can have a GUI window showing on one or more workspaces.
2011-06-30T00:06:00.000Z	chris_99	usr13	i hope so
2011-06-30T00:07:00.000Z	chris_99		yeah, what i don't want is the currently selected application
2011-06-30T00:07:00.000Z	chris_99		to move to the next workspace
2011-06-30T00:07:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	To move to the next workspace is what it says.  If it is on workspace1 and you move to next workspace, it will go to workspace2
2011-06-30T00:07:00.000Z	chris_99		it never used to do that
2011-06-30T00:08:00.000Z	chris_99		is there no way to stop it from doing that, usr13
2011-06-30T00:08:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	Well, it is just an option.  You don't have to use it.
2011-06-30T00:08:00.000Z	chris_99		what i'm saying is, it always moves that window usr13
2011-06-30T00:08:00.000Z	chris_99		there doesn't seem to be an option to stop it
2011-06-30T00:08:00.000Z	chris_99		from doing that
2011-06-30T00:09:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	Well, I don't know about that. Sorry.
2011-06-30T00:10:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	I suppose if you were using workspace2 during your last session, you'll start out on workspace2 on next one.
2011-06-30T00:10:00.000Z	chris_99		thats not the issue though, usr13, its the fact the selected application is moving with me, when i move workspace
2011-06-30T00:10:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	But does it really matter?  (Does it matter which workspace you use for any particular GUI application?)
2011-06-30T00:11:00.000Z	chris_99		yes, its very annoying
2011-06-30T00:11:00.000Z	usr13	chris_99	Then just use one workspace
