2012-03-13T13:00:00.000Z	crashanddie		Hi, trying to upgrade from Natty to Oneiric. I'm getting "E:Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages." However, apt-get autoremove, doesn't change anything, nor does apt-get -f. This is the apt log from the upgrade tool: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=e0krQALw
2012-03-13T13:02:00.000Z	crashanddie		@ is not a special character in shells
2012-03-13T13:02:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	I know it's not but bash might strip the backslash out.
2012-03-13T14:30:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	Try dpkg -l and look for packages with something other than ii in the first two columns.
2012-03-13T14:33:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	some packages are marked as removed with residual configuration, that's all.
2012-03-13T14:34:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	That's not very helpful, is it?
2012-03-13T14:34:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	sorry?
2012-03-13T14:34:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	Just a comment.
2012-03-13T14:35:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	would you like the list of packages that aren't "ii"?
2012-03-13T14:35:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	No, that status isn't anywhere broken.
2012-03-13T14:35:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	FWIW, synaptic reports 0 packages broken
2012-03-13T14:36:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	That's no help either.
2012-03-13T14:39:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	Are you currently running a 64 bit kernel?
2012-03-13T14:39:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	2.6.38-13-generic x86_64
2012-03-13T14:40:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	OK I suspect the "broken" messages have nothing to do with your existing packages.
2012-03-13T14:40:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	It's more like the upgrade has issues.
2012-03-13T14:41:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	I'd advise a fresh install.
2012-03-13T14:45:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	the reason I've been reluctant to do a fresh install is that this is a company-provided computer. There is no /home partition (everything on /), and I don't have enough HD space to back everything up.
2012-03-13T14:45:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	usb drive?
2012-03-13T14:46:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	I could, potentially, resize the current / partition, install the new distribution on whatever space I have available (something like 80GB), and then change the old partition to become my /home.
2012-03-13T14:49:00.000Z	crashanddie	gvo	I have mint 11 on my home server, I've been waiting for MATE to become a bit more stable before throwing 12 on it. It finally seems usable, so I'll go for that.
2012-03-13T14:51:00.000Z	gvo	crashanddie	It's working well for me.  I really only use the netbook actively.  The server just sits there and runs programs/backups etc.
