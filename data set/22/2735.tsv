2010-04-15T00:44:00.000Z	Trashi		how can i give a user access to  foreign user homedir?
2010-04-15T00:44:00.000Z	StevenR	Trashi	use groups
2010-04-15T00:45:00.000Z	Trashi	StevenR	i did add user2 to group of user1 but user2 hasnt access to homedir of user1? :/

2010-04-15T00:53:00.000Z	StevenR	Trashi	that looks right.... what happens when you try to cd into the dir?
2010-04-15T00:54:00.000Z	Trashi	StevenR	one moment
2010-04-15T00:58:00.000Z	Trashi	StevenR	i can reach the directory via cd but for example i cant create a now directory via mkdir or s.th. like this?
2010-04-15T01:00:00.000Z	Trashi	StevenR	but i think that could be a chmod problem
2010-04-15T01:07:00.000Z	StevenR	Trashi	chmod 770 /home/user that'll give you write access
2010-04-15T01:07:00.000Z	Trashi	StevenR	thank u very much
