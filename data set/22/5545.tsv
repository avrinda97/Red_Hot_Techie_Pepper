2007-04-29T15:09:00.000Z	malder		how can I uninstall a piece of hardware and then reinstall it? (it's not working right)
2007-04-29T15:09:00.000Z	slavik	malder	what do you mean it is not working right?
2007-04-29T15:10:00.000Z	slavik	malder	the only way to uninstall hardware and reinstall it is to take it out and put it back in :P ... what you are thinking of is reloading the driver
2007-04-29T15:11:00.000Z	malder	slavik	right, that IS what I mean... ;). Where do I do that at?
2007-04-29T15:11:00.000Z	slavik	malder	first off you need to know the name of the driver/module, then look at modprobe (man modprobe)
2007-04-29T15:12:00.000Z	malder	slavik	where do I find the name of the driver? It's for my sound card...
2007-04-29T15:12:00.000Z	slavik	malder	I don't really know ... depends on the sound card
2007-04-29T15:12:00.000Z	slavik	malder	look in the hardware manager thingy ...
2007-04-29T15:13:00.000Z	malder	slavik	would it be what is listed in the device manager
2007-04-29T15:13:00.000Z	slavik	malder	should be (I haven't looked at it much)
2007-04-29T15:14:00.000Z	malder	slavik	would it be easier through the command line?
2007-04-29T15:14:00.000Z	slavik	malder	doubt it
2007-04-29T15:14:00.000Z	slavik	malder	what sound card and how is it misbehaiving
2007-04-29T15:16:00.000Z	malder	slavik	it's an audigy 2
2007-04-29T15:16:00.000Z	slavik	malder	maybe the driver is not completely stable, although the same card misbehaives under windows too
2007-04-29T15:16:00.000Z	malder	slavik	it was working fine. Suddenly it no longer works on my login, but works just fine for other 2 logins...
2007-04-29T15:16:00.000Z	slavik	malder	seems like a setting was changed
2007-04-29T15:18:00.000Z	malder	slavik	it would, but I can't for the life of me figure out what... I have the volume control (has the muted icon) and when I click on it I get: No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.
2007-04-29T15:18:00.000Z	slavik	malder	double click on that thing (volume control) and select the proper device
2007-04-29T15:19:00.000Z	slavik	malder	I think you selected another output device
2007-04-29T15:20:00.000Z	malder	slavik	how would another device be selected? It's possible my daughter did it by accident, but I have no idea how....
2007-04-29T15:20:00.000Z	slavik	malder	somewhere in system there should be sound or something of the sort
