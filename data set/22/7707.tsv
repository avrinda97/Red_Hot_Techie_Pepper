2006-01-19T09:24:00.000Z	Shouryuu		Is there a way to check if my machine is Linux compatible? I doubt it isn't but that's the only thing that could be causing my problem...
2006-01-19T09:26:00.000Z	Shouryuu		Would anyone know why, when trying to installing Ubuntu, my instalation gets stuck on a "ok, booting kernel" screen?
2006-01-19T09:27:00.000Z	Shouryuu		I've ripped it about 4 times, on 4 different cds, with 2 different downloads...
2006-01-19T09:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	well the first thing to do is look at the supported list of hardware, even if this is omits your hardware it may work for you,  to do this run this in your irc client to have the bot tell you about supported hardware >>/msg ubotu tell me about hardware<<
2006-01-19T09:27:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	will do thanks paul
2006-01-19T09:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	do >>md5sum foo.iso<<  from a distro
2006-01-19T09:34:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	no, it means it is not known
2006-01-19T09:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	can u md5sum your iso to prove that it works?
2006-01-19T09:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	I think there are binaries for it,  to check the integrity of your installation media, one way is to visit https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VerifyIsoHowto can you write down what is on the screen in paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give us the URL maybe there is an error message that makes sense to someone here
2006-01-19T09:38:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	- Ok I'll try that, thanks a lot.
2006-01-19T09:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	when is it failing in the install?
2006-01-19T09:46:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	- It's not really failling, I don't get an error message. It just stays on the following message "Unziping linux... Ok booting kernel" I've waited a good 20 mins last time I tried installing it and nothing happened...
2006-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	which disk did you get and what kind of machine have you got?
2006-01-19T09:50:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	- I'm on an Aspire 5500, and I'm using a normal CD-R. I got the download from the ubuntu web site...
2006-01-19T09:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	no that is not my question, what version of Ubuntu did you download ?
2006-01-19T09:51:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	- I got it from here http://www.ubuntu.com/download ... I'll feel very stupid if it isn't the right one...
2006-01-19T09:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	which one did you choose?
2006-01-19T09:53:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	- yeah sorry forgot to specify http://mir1.ovh.net/ubuntu/releases/5.10/      I got "PC (Intel x86) install CD
2006-01-19T09:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	have you two machines?
2006-01-19T09:56:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	- Yeah I have two machines, but I don't want to see the look on my brother's face once I told him I've installed linux on his computer...
2006-01-19T09:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Shouryuu	no for the box you are dealing with try this, as the machine boots up it will stall at a line, and it offers a server install, try that if it works afterward we will do the rest of the command lines with you to get the box working - there is btw only one or two and they are >> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop << then if the video does not work >> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<< and then reboot drop by again :)
2006-01-19T09:59:00.000Z	Shouryuu	ompaul	- thanks a lot I'll try that ASAP =D
