2011-08-23T03:13:00.000Z	Vitor		can someone tell me why when I install ubuntu or any version of linux on my eee and I try to enter my wireless the system freezes?
2011-08-23T03:15:00.000Z	silverarrow	Vitor	no, a bit unusual
2011-08-23T03:15:00.000Z	Vitor		i have read somenething on a forum about some update to the kernel
2011-08-23T03:15:00.000Z	Vitor		but i dont remember it anymore
2011-08-23T03:16:00.000Z	Vitor		its very wierd cause i had already installed ubuntu on the eee befire
2011-08-23T03:16:00.000Z	Vitor		before
2011-08-23T03:16:00.000Z	Vitor		*
2011-08-23T03:16:00.000Z	Vitor		but now when i do it behaves like that
2011-08-23T03:17:00.000Z	Vitor		i have net on cable but if i try wireless it freezes the computer
2011-08-23T03:17:00.000Z	Vitor		i tryed this on ubuntu kubuntu and fedora and backtrack
2011-08-23T03:18:00.000Z	Vitor		at log in
2011-08-23T03:18:00.000Z	Vitor		choose gnome classic
2011-08-23T03:19:00.000Z	silverarrow	Vitor	puppy linux often handles these quirks differently, but it its not a reguar full installation distro, but really full distro in other respects
2011-08-23T03:20:00.000Z	Vitor	silverarrow	i really would like to have ubuntu working, i tought about wireless card prob but it cant be or wouldnt work on windows too
2011-08-23T03:21:00.000Z	silverarrow	Vitor	probably driver issues, but weird having the entire puter freeze
2011-08-23T03:21:00.000Z	silverarrow	Vitor	makes me think it's something more
2011-08-23T03:21:00.000Z	Vitor	silverarrow	yeah but i have no ideia what
2011-08-23T03:22:00.000Z	Vitor	silverarrow	on windows works so no card prob
2011-08-23T03:22:00.000Z	Vitor		and on all distros same preob
2011-08-23T03:22:00.000Z	Vitor		the wierd thing is that i had it working before just on now its giving this prob
2011-08-23T03:25:00.000Z	Vitor	silverarrow	tomorrow i came again thanks for yout help
