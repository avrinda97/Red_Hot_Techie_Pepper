2009-12-13T15:31:00.000Z	Emanon		for most things i prefer a touchpad myself (no statement against those who prefer mouse tho) do have to use mouse for some games just cause its faster for me
2009-12-13T15:33:00.000Z	Emanon		and (depending on the computer) firefox CAN be a pretty big load
2009-12-13T15:34:00.000Z	Emanon		thats real odd
2009-12-13T15:34:00.000Z	Emanon		metacity then
2009-12-13T15:35:00.000Z	Emanon		snowboarder scroll up i answered it a while ago
2009-12-13T15:35:00.000Z	Emanon		open it as root with sudo or change the ownership with chown
2009-12-13T15:36:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	damn....its already gone
2009-12-13T15:36:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	Can you please repeat it
2009-12-13T15:37:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	was that for me: sudo chown -hR youruser:yourgroup yourfile ?
2009-12-13T15:39:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	I get this errormessage then: chown: cannot access `neteTuberkolose.sas': Permission denied
2009-12-13T15:41:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	do you think it would be an idea to go to the server and cmod it?
2009-12-13T15:42:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	what does it mean to chown it?
2009-12-13T15:43:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	this file is residing on another server...So the owner is the user on that server. Might that be the cause?
2009-12-13T15:45:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	How do i get to become root of the server?
2009-12-13T15:46:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	hehe yes thats not gonna happen :)
2009-12-13T16:04:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	ahh yes ok....nice....but now it is a cylinder and not a box
2009-12-13T16:05:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	thx so much
2009-12-13T17:01:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	where do i find the task panel plugin?
2009-12-13T17:04:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	yes...which one of the 3 is the correct?
2009-12-13T17:04:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	i would guess Window List
2009-12-13T17:08:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	ahaa i see....okay so it then lists all the running tasks in the panel
2009-12-13T17:08:00.000Z	Snowboarder	Emanon	but is there a way to split up the tasks, so that some are shown in one panel, and others are shown in others?
