2009-04-18T20:08:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk		I would really appreciate your  help! with a little guidance on how to mount a password protected(alternative ubuntu cd) installed filesystem. My system wont startup and im using a usb key live disc now. Thank you!
2009-04-18T20:09:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> you're booted of a usb disk?
2009-04-18T20:10:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	yip. And I used ages for install encfs. I just can't find how to mount it :o
2009-04-18T20:11:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> ages? what app is that?
2009-04-18T20:12:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	on the usb rescue key
2009-04-18T20:12:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> am not familiar with ages, what is it?
2009-04-18T20:13:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	ages as years in time.
2009-04-18T20:13:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> what happens when you mount it? what exactly is your mount command?
2009-04-18T20:15:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	I tried lot of things with encfs, mount, fusemount. But encfs /dev/sda1 decryptedfolder/  tells me if I want to make the directory /dev/sda1. Im sure its just me there don't know the "right" command
2009-04-18T20:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> am not familiar with encfs, but lets see what your mount command is like and lets see the system respnose (post in pastebin)
2009-04-18T20:16:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	sure one moment - ps what pastebin do you want me to use?
2009-04-18T20:19:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	here it is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/153513/  just tell me if you need anything else
2009-04-18T20:28:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> i think you are missing options on your mount command, like the options for aes, -o loop and such,  google for the details on mounting encrypted file systems
2009-04-18T20:30:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	I have tried for the last 3 hours to search for options, however without result. I've never used mount so I'm kinda a noobie.
2009-04-18T20:39:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	I'm going to try reinstall ubuntu onto. And hope it wont screw it up even more. Thank you for your time. Kindly regards Martin
2009-04-18T20:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> something like mount -o loop,encryption=aes,acl  /iso/or/partitiontomount    /mountpoint
2009-04-18T20:44:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	thanks i'll try that

2009-04-18T20:47:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	i'll have a look at it. However a start it actually ask me about a password: http://paste.ubuntu.com/153530/
2009-04-18T20:47:00.000Z	n8tuser	the_rescue_disk	-> you expect it to be right? you have an encrypted file system you want to mount?
2009-04-18T20:48:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	yip, but I don'
2009-04-18T20:48:00.000Z	the_rescue_disk	n8tuser	yip, but I don't know which one. I used the guided encryption installation from the alternative ubuntu cd.
