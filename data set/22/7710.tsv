2006-01-16T11:06:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	no, but there are some available
2006-01-16T11:07:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	scyld offers a driver, but i didn't use it...the kernel has the same driver
2006-01-16T11:08:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	was that to me?
2006-01-16T11:11:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	no i don't think they do...
2006-01-16T11:12:00.000Z	sudharsh	htedrom	pity.....checked the version as well?
2006-01-16T11:12:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	the scyld one doesn't say anything about via rhine III
2006-01-16T11:12:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	whereas the kernel recognizes the chip as via rhine III
2006-01-16T11:13:00.000Z	sudharsh	htedrom	so does lspci,work
2006-01-16T11:13:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	the scyld one only says it supports rhine and rhine II
2006-01-16T11:13:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	yea
2006-01-16T11:15:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	but it's not hardware...i'm using the same machine now
2006-01-16T11:20:00.000Z	sudharsh	htedrom	try Application > System Tools > System Log
2006-01-16T11:20:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	there isn't really anything there..
2006-01-16T11:20:00.000Z	htedrom	sudharsh	it loads the module
