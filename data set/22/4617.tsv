2007-11-28T19:48:00.000Z	Nimby		Hi I am getting this error - Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":1.0"   - how can I fix it ?
2007-11-28T19:49:00.000Z	beasty	Nimby	disable the dri part in your xorg.conf
2007-11-28T19:49:00.000Z	Nimby	beasty	can you remind me where xorg.conf is please ?
2007-11-28T19:50:00.000Z	beasty	Nimby	#       Load    "dri"
2007-11-28T19:50:00.000Z	beasty	Nimby	it's located in the "Module" section
2007-11-28T19:53:00.000Z	Nimby	beasty	Load  "glx" ?
2007-11-28T19:53:00.000Z	beasty	Nimby	don't you have a load dri ?
2007-11-28T19:53:00.000Z	Nimby	beasty	thats the only thing in -> Section "Module"
2007-11-28T19:54:00.000Z	beasty	Nimby	look into the xorg.conf for dri
2007-11-28T19:55:00.000Z	Nimby	beasty	there is no entry like that
2007-11-28T19:55:00.000Z	beasty	Nimby	that's strange

2007-11-28T20:05:00.000Z	Nimby	beasty	I tried everything there and just tried ---> adding Section "Extensions"
2007-11-28T20:07:00.000Z	Nimby	beasty	I've just noticed this in xorg.conf --> Section "Device"
2007-11-28T20:12:00.000Z	Nimby	beasty	somehow the ati driver wasnt enabled anymore but I have re-enabled it and rebooted and it still is giving me that error
