2009-01-05T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	i like proftpd but millions would hate it and millions would love it
2009-01-05T17:29:00.000Z	magicsrv	ActionParsnip	I have that one, could u tell me how to add users and groups?
2009-01-05T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	just add normal users then edit the conf file to chroot users to their home folders
2009-01-05T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	or is it for multiple users to access the same data store
2009-01-05T17:31:00.000Z	magicsrv	ActionParsnip	so basicly... in order to have usernames with password for the ftp server I need to add OS users?
2009-01-05T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	its one way
2009-01-05T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	if you want them to view the same data store, set their home folder to the same and then use guid override to make the gloally accessible
2009-01-05T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	thats fine, create the user and set its home to to mountpoint of the ntfs partition

2009-01-05T17:43:00.000Z	magicsrv	ActionParsnip	what is a user's shell?...
2009-01-05T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	its the shell they use for commands (like /bin/bash) for security use /bin/false
2009-01-05T17:45:00.000Z	magicsrv	ActionParsnip	thanks! Hope it won't affect logging into the server...
2009-01-05T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	i think it may, create a test user and try
2009-01-05T17:49:00.000Z	magicsrv	ActionParsnip	"User not found..." ...
2009-01-05T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	I think you need to make true system users
2009-01-05T17:51:00.000Z	magicsrv	ActionParsnip	I have... made it at the User Manager ...
2009-01-05T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	magicsrv	silly gui apps
