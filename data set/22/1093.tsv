2010-12-29T03:18:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 programming
2010-12-29T03:19:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	you might have some luck in #linux
2010-12-29T03:20:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 right but as soon as i say what i'm programming they say go somewhere else.  anyway i was just curious if there was a general room for more general stuff
2010-12-29T03:21:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	why do they tell you to go away?
2010-12-29T03:22:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 it's at this point i realize the futility of my question
2010-12-29T03:22:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	i guess so.. i fail to see why they'd tell you to leave #linux, whne you're discussing programming/
2010-12-29T03:22:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	try #programming
2010-12-29T03:23:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	i just like this room i guess, but the subject is off topic here
2010-12-29T03:23:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 yes i am, thx
2011-01-14T04:50:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	ys
2011-01-27T22:59:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	grunt
2011-01-28T03:55:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	don't be a douchebag
2011-01-28T03:56:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 honestly didn't mean that
2011-01-28T03:56:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	sure..
2011-01-28T03:57:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	there's no logicla reason to even suggest such a command, unless you're being reckless.
2011-01-28T04:09:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	i'd settle just for him asking a question, we could work on the every minute thing..lol
2011-01-28T04:09:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 i admit, it is mildly entertaining
2011-01-28T04:10:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 ps, regarding the whole rm -r thing, it is logical to recommend that, given the right parameters, i just fail to recall them.. and i'm too frightened to try it on my own system :S
2011-01-28T04:11:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 assuming he was trying to delete all his files/dirs in a given directory..
2011-01-28T04:11:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	exactly... there are few circumstances to recommend that command.
2011-01-28T04:11:00.000Z	KM0201	goltoof	and even then, if you're going to recommend it, you need to quadruple check that they are in the right directory.
2011-01-28T04:12:00.000Z	goltoof	KM0201	 if i didn't rely on this channel for help, i'd be less hesitant to blurt out such things
