2005-07-14T10:03:00.000Z	golgor		i got torrentflux, but i cant upload since linux wont let it save files in certain folders, how to change that?
2005-07-14T10:03:00.000Z	golgor		anyone know?
2005-07-14T10:03:00.000Z	dbernar1	golgor	change which folders are used in preferences.
2005-07-14T10:04:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	you mean in torrentflux?
2005-07-14T10:05:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	isnt is possible to give it access to dir /home/golgor/torrent?
2005-07-14T10:05:00.000Z	dbernar1	golgor	yes, off course.
2005-07-14T10:07:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	i got all the permissions, my user of course, but i still get error when try to upload torrent "no permission to create file /home/golgor/torrent
2005-07-14T10:08:00.000Z	dbernar1	golgor	no, I mean, what permissions are set for the /golgor/torrent directory.
2005-07-14T10:08:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	drwxr-xr-x
2005-07-14T10:09:00.000Z	dbernar1	golgor	go chmod o+w /home/golgor/torrent
2005-07-14T10:12:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	thanks works great now
2005-07-14T10:13:00.000Z	dbernar1	golgor	yeah, that program has its own user. Dunno if you want to allow write access to everyone
2005-07-14T10:17:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	you helped me give it permission to write files right?
2005-07-14T10:17:00.000Z	dbernar1	golgor	sure.
2005-07-14T10:19:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	now it is drwxr-xrwx and i guess the last "-" is write directories?
2005-07-14T10:20:00.000Z	dbernar1	golgor	first is the d, or - telling you if it is a file or a dir.
2005-07-14T10:21:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	ahh, think i got it :P
2005-07-14T10:22:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	but i got a similar problem then, if i got it right drwxr means permission to write/read/delete directories?
2005-07-14T10:24:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	yea, but torrentflux dont have permission to create dirs in my /torrent
2005-07-14T10:24:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	it seems
2005-07-14T10:25:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	Error(s):# Couldn't allocate dir - [Errno 13]  Permission denied:
2005-07-14T10:26:00.000Z	golgor	dbernar1	says the path has to be chmodded to 777
