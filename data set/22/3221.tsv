2008-11-15T02:19:00.000Z	emilien		is it possible to partion - partion with out deleting all it contents ?
2008-11-15T02:20:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	yes, in some cases. gparted can do that
2008-11-30T04:50:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	you need to provide more details. is it a USb keyboard?
2008-11-30T04:52:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	 yes , i tried lsusb did not pick it up
2008-11-30T04:53:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	it should... are the wires ok? has the keyboard a switch (like for old PS/2 mode)?
2008-11-30T04:56:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	no switch that i can see look at manual says i need to install driver which is on cd < lost cd >  here is paste bin of lsusb http://pastebin.com/m177510f0
2008-11-30T04:57:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	whats device 3 the one w/o description? is it going away when you plug in the KB. also check the output of dmesg for errors
2008-11-30T04:59:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	no idea what 3 no mouse could be keyboard as can't run lsub with out key board
2008-11-30T05:03:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	ok, then i misunderstood you. i though your usb kayboard is not working but you can type with it?
2008-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	no you did not , i have a second keyboard which works but i have a new one which dosn't
2008-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	ok, so what i meant is, do you see a differnece in lsusb with the new keyboard plugged in and not plugged in? and did you check dmesg's output?
2008-11-30T05:07:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	 yes , i tried lsusb did not pick it up
2008-11-30T05:07:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	sounds like a hardware issue.. did you try plugging in something else in that USB port?
2008-11-30T05:09:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	sorry , lsub did not pick it up as i unpluged "mystrey keyboard" and lsusb was same input as before , usb is fine as the working keyboard works fine from that usb port
2008-11-30T05:11:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	that really sounds like a hardware problem between the cable and your new KB.  two usb keyboards should work fine i had that too
2008-11-30T05:13:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	here is demsg http://pastebin.com/m5b1a8631
2008-11-30T05:13:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	very possible did by it from second hand shop shame really nice keyboard
2008-11-30T05:14:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	it mmay be just the cable. there is something about not able to enumerate. that could indicate a communication problem
2008-11-30T05:15:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	the Buffer I/O error on device sdf1 does worry more :/
2008-11-30T05:15:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	what does the buffer I/o error mean ?
2008-11-30T05:16:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	emilien	looks like there was a write error on your external disk. at least the message is not repeated, just once
2008-11-30T05:19:00.000Z	emilien	zsquareplusc	i think it is my cdrom i get a lots of errors when i boot with cd inside cdrom
