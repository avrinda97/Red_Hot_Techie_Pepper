2007-01-21T12:18:00.000Z	toulouse	tom47	after reading all that junk just to get that to work, i think i'll just reboot and look at the bios, it's much easier :)
2007-01-21T12:18:00.000Z	tom47	toulouse	yes its meant to be a lasting solution not a casual anquiry
2007-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	toulouse	tom47	i looked in bios :) much faster
2007-01-21T12:30:00.000Z	tom47	toulouse	well done
2007-02-23T17:50:00.000Z	tom47	toulouse	no they can be shared quite happily
