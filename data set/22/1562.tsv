2010-04-08T11:53:00.000Z	AstroMix		Hi, I'm trying to do a few things — bought a laptop from best buy this evening, Windows 7 standard. I formatted the drive, installed ubuntu on a partition and formatted the other partition ntfs for windows. My laptop apparently has no XP chipset drivers for SATA so XP install is breaking when attempted. I think I found the drivers I need online, but they're windows executables — anyone have an idea what I should do, I've asked in #
2010-04-08T11:54:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	Are you trying to put XP and Ubuntu on this new lappy?
2010-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	yeah I am
2010-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	ubuntu is already on and running fine as expected
2010-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	I dont think you will find XP drivers for your laptop. But if Ubuntu is running fine no wories.
2010-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	I did find the drivers
2010-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	they're just .exe, and short of creating a windows install iso with them in there I dunno what to do
2010-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	Then I am confused with what exactly you need assistance with...
2010-04-08T12:00:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	 you and me both ^^
2010-04-08T12:01:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	I have not personally used that feature so I would not know.
2010-04-08T12:04:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	What are you installing?
2010-04-08T12:05:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	well, i've been trying to put XP on a partition, but as I said, no SATA chipset drivers — so I need to do something else
2010-04-08T12:08:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	I have not yet figured out how to access files from VM to Host.
2010-04-08T12:12:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	Restore partitions can be useful. But take up waaay too much space.
2010-04-08T12:14:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	MS wont be supporting XP for much longer. I dont see how they can. It is sooo old.
2010-04-08T12:14:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	bah, it's really just IE6+ i'm after

2010-04-08T12:20:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	ies4linux project still works, but it only installs IEs 5, 5.5, and 6 with an optional ie 7 alpha release — which isn't really too helpful these days
2010-04-08T12:22:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	i'm a web developer, some clients have to have IE6 compatibility and IE7 because their companies won't let them upgrade
2010-04-08T12:23:00.000Z	AstroMix	crucialhoax	i would never … "use" .. internet exploder
2010-04-08T12:23:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	Should have known. Companies would not allow FF for business use.
2010-04-08T12:26:00.000Z	crucialhoax	AstroMix	I was thinking more along the lines of shockwave support for some flash games or something. Either way.
