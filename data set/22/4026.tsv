2008-04-06T10:05:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	what ? Audio CD?
2008-04-06T10:12:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	I think maybe linux doesn't detect your CDRom
2008-04-06T10:12:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	type this into terminal: more /etc/fstab
2008-04-06T10:15:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	boot it first
2008-04-06T10:18:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	hm, btw, can you describe your problem again? Do you mean the CD icon doesn't change if you insert cd into it?
2008-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	how abotu audio cd? other kinds of cd?
2008-04-06T10:25:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	I think your linux doesn't set your CDRom drive up properly, try reboot with CDRom taken off
2008-04-06T10:25:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	or reinsert your cdrom
2008-04-06T10:26:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	well, reinsert
2008-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	DeVonne	pen	 do you want me to boot without the cdrom drive then with it?
2008-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	course, try it
2008-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	DeVonne	pen	 ok brb

2008-04-06T12:19:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	it's called Disk Mounter
2008-04-06T12:19:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	right click gnome panel and select add to panel
2008-04-06T12:19:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	and add Disk mounter
2008-04-06T12:20:00.000Z	pen	DeVonne	can you mount with that?
2008-04-06T12:21:00.000Z	DeVonne	pen	I got them mounted with --force, but if it happens again I will try with that
