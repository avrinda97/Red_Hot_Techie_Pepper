2011-10-31T18:42:00.000Z	share		How do I know which service is using  that port?
2011-10-31T18:42:00.000Z	share		help
2011-10-31T18:43:00.000Z	XayOn	share	Probably a proxy, probably privoxy.
2011-10-31T18:43:00.000Z	XayOn		netstat -putan|grep 8118
2011-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	share	XayOn	yes but privoxy is not running!
2011-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	XayOn	share	netstat -putan|grep 8118
2011-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	XayOn		I insist.
2011-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	share	XayOn	already did that comment, it doesnt show the process!
2011-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	XayOn	share	As root.
2011-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	share		ok
2011-10-31T18:45:00.000Z	share	XayOn	damn you're right!
2011-10-31T18:45:00.000Z	share		:)
2011-10-31T18:45:00.000Z	share	XayOn	privoxy is running.
2011-10-31T18:45:00.000Z	XayOn	share	Of course i am. And certainly, you have a running privoxy, with that PID.
2011-10-31T18:46:00.000Z	share	XayOn	I killed it!
2011-10-31T18:46:00.000Z	share	XayOn	sudo killall privoxy
2011-10-31T18:47:00.000Z	XayOn	share	I don't think that should work. invoke-rc.d privoxy stop, and if it does not work sudo pkill -9 privoxy
2011-10-31T18:47:00.000Z	share	XayOn	it did work for now:P but yeah rcconf doesn't show privoxy at startup!
2011-10-31T18:48:00.000Z	share	XayOn	sudo service privoxy stop did the trick
2011-10-31T18:49:00.000Z	XayOn	share	Nice.
2011-10-31T18:50:00.000Z	share	XayOn	yeah but it seems I will have to that rc.d command
