2008-12-05T12:28:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	you busy?
2008-12-05T12:30:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	you able to mentor a little on mount points?  I'm having problems mounting a volume due to invalid characters
2008-12-05T12:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	have you tried force mounting it?
2008-12-05T12:32:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	have not tried the mount command in terminal, although I'll go try that now
2008-12-05T12:39:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	wa able to do that
2008-12-05T12:39:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	sorry what?
2008-12-05T12:40:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	sorry, was able to force mount it although now the partition has fallen off my places list...
2008-12-05T12:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	where did you mount it to?
2008-12-05T12:41:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	/media
2008-12-05T12:50:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	is editing the fstab file the only way to add a partition to the places list?
2008-12-05T12:50:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	no
2008-12-05T12:51:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	so long as it is mounted under /media/ then it should be listed
2008-12-05T12:51:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	is there an easier/safer way you might be able to point me towards?  I don't have a problem with google, just not sure what to search for
2008-12-05T12:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	did that work for you?
2008-12-05T12:57:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	sorry, no not yet, when i mounted to /mount/ it wouldn't show up in the places list
2008-12-05T12:57:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	I noticed that all the other partitions were at /media/disk-X
2008-12-05T12:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	another idea would be to just bookmark it in nautilus
2008-12-05T12:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	nautilus bookmarks show up under places
2008-12-05T13:01:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	Thank you for the guidance, I was able to get it working now :) a little mkdir action and it seems to be all set
2008-12-05T13:01:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gbear14275	cool :)
2008-12-05T13:04:00.000Z	gbear14275	Paddy_EIRE	well... it kinda is, isn't it?  bring OS usability to the masses?
