2009-07-26T20:42:00.000Z	zeitsofa	Halitech	what is an u3 drive?
2009-07-26T20:42:00.000Z	Halitech	zeitsofa	its the new "secure" type of software they put on some thumb drives
2009-07-26T20:43:00.000Z	zeitsofa	Halitech	no it is. it's an normal sata drive
2009-07-26T20:44:00.000Z	Halitech	zeitsofa	so its not a thumb drive?
2009-07-26T20:46:00.000Z	zeitsofa	Halitech	no it is an internal drive
2009-07-26T20:46:00.000Z	Halitech	zeitsofa	ok, I had asked if it was a thumb drive and thought you said it was .... can you format it with ext3?
2009-07-26T20:48:00.000Z	zeitsofa	Halitech	sorry for that :/ and no i cant format the drive under linux. neither with ext* nor with xfs.
2009-07-26T20:56:00.000Z	zeitsofa	Halitech	hmm i switched the port on the mainboard for the satacable to sdb - now it works. i put an other device on there and it works too *confused*
