2008-06-29T11:50:00.000Z	sweetgu1		Bin Laden! Tell!
2008-06-29T11:51:00.000Z	sweetgu1		PMDematagoda_: I'm trying to create a GNOME Applet, following the tutorial. The only include file necessary is applet-widget.h
2008-06-29T11:52:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	apt-cache search filename or look on packages.ubuntu.com
2008-06-29T11:53:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	I'll give that a try, apt-file didn't work
2008-06-29T11:54:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	No results are return when i Input "apt-cache search applet-widget.h"
2008-06-29T11:54:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	did you look on packages.ubuntu.com; also what is the link of the tutorial
2008-06-29T11:55:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	I did indeed. Let me grab you the link, one moment.
2008-06-29T11:59:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	http://developer.gnome.org/doc/tutorials/applet/changes.html Greybox#2 in the list
2008-06-29T12:00:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	reading now
2008-06-29T12:01:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	applet-widget.h is a generic placeholder name
2008-06-29T12:02:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	Who's place is it holding?
2008-06-29T12:03:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	whatever applet-widget you create; that is just an example name
2008-06-29T12:04:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	isn't this code example supposed to be the applet i'm creating?
2008-06-29T12:04:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	no that is just the example (unless you wrote that tutorial)
2008-06-29T12:06:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	i'm lost
2008-06-29T12:07:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	can you manage to get one of these to compile?
2008-06-29T12:07:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	i'm trying to write an applet similar to the existing taskbar with one more button on it, sorta like the start menu
2008-06-29T12:08:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	this is not really the channel for widget compiling; bit busy at the moment.
2008-06-29T12:08:00.000Z	bazhang	sweetgu1	if that is so difficult for you I would suggest getting a premade theme from gnome-look
2008-06-29T12:09:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	how'd you figure that it was a place holder
2008-06-29T12:22:00.000Z	sweetgu1	bazhang	gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), controls); this line returns controls as undefined... i assume it's a place holder as well, turns out the function demands a widget in its place. although, i can't figure which sort.. i put window in place of widget and it compiles but on runtime it spits an error. what do you think?
