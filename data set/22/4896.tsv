2007-09-20T15:19:00.000Z	tdizzy		is it possible to install drivers made for windows to ubutnu?
2007-09-20T15:20:00.000Z	tdizzy		umm a USB headset driver
2007-09-20T15:20:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	No. Some wireless adapters can use something called ndiswrapper but that is about it
2007-10-02T14:18:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	You need to change ownership of that file to the user which that directory belongs. Then after to change the permissions on it to 644
2007-10-02T14:19:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	Then delete it. It will be recreated next time X runs
2007-10-02T14:25:00.000Z	tdizzy	genii	when i delete the file, it gives the same error when i boot
2007-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	Are you using sudo with the commands to rm or chmod or chown ?
2007-10-02T14:30:00.000Z	tdizzy	genii	yeah i used to sudo to remove the file
2007-10-02T14:30:00.000Z	tdizzy	genii	i used sudo**
2007-10-02T14:31:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	OK. is the /home/<name>   directory the .dmrc is in correspond to the <name> which you are logging in as?
2007-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	Did you recently copy this dir back in from someplace else without using -p switch in the cp command?
2007-10-02T14:34:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	Have you been starting the machine with the Recovery kernel then trying to start the X server?
2007-10-02T14:36:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	I would suggest something like:    sudo chown -R <name>:<name> /home/<name>           where <name> is the user name which corresponds to this obviously. then: sudo chmod 644 /home/<name>/.dmrc
2007-10-02T14:39:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	You may also want to do:  sudo chown -R <name>:<name> /home/<name>/.*                     <-- note /.*     after <name> as different from previous command
2007-10-02T14:42:00.000Z	tdizzy	genii	i got the very same errors again
2007-10-02T14:44:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	I'm out of immediate ideas then. Something very odd is going on unless you are running X as root for instance in another users home directory or similar. Or perhaps somehow did already a mistaken chown -R of /home directory to someone else besides <name> where they need to own /home/<name>
2007-10-02T14:47:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	For the second one, sudo chmod 755 /home/<name>
2007-10-02T14:48:00.000Z	tdizzy	genii	k that took care of the first problem, but ive still got the second
2007-10-02T14:48:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	I need to leave work in about 5 minutes so cannot help much more at this time
2007-10-02T14:49:00.000Z	tdizzy	genii	got any idea?
2007-10-02T14:49:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	remove again the .dmrc file
2007-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	genii	tdizzy	Good luck with it, I must leave.
