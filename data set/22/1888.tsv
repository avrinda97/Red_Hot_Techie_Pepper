2009-12-10T06:00:00.000Z	Oblat	apocalypt	i was able to start it before normally but after i did upgrade , update and few other minor things it started giving me these errors
2009-12-10T06:04:00.000Z	apocalypt	Oblat	try to take these users in the vnc group
2009-12-10T06:06:00.000Z	apocalypt	Oblat	/etc/group

2009-12-10T06:08:00.000Z	Oblat	apocalypt	yea i was just looking that up now
2009-12-10T06:09:00.000Z	apocalypt	Oblat	especially look for "Users, Groups and Permissions"

2009-12-10T06:14:00.000Z	Oblat	apocalypt	what do i edit in the file specifically?
2009-12-10T06:14:00.000Z	apocalypt	Oblat	try this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC
2009-12-10T06:15:00.000Z	Oblat	apocalypt	That confused me a lot more =/
2009-12-10T06:15:00.000Z	Oblat	apocalypt	I opened up the file /etc/group, what do i have to edit there?
2009-12-10T06:16:00.000Z	apocalypt	Oblat	is there a group vnc?
2009-12-10T06:16:00.000Z	Oblat	apocalypt	no, should i make a group for vnc?
2009-12-10T06:18:00.000Z	apocalypt	Oblat	maybe u should install and configure vnc new using the help page
2009-12-10T06:19:00.000Z	Oblat	apocalypt	the thing is that it was working perfectly before i did upgrade and update, and svn up. I started it on my other user account by doing x11vnc -create.

2009-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	apocalypt	Oblat	maybe u got corrupt packages. try sudo apt-get -f install
