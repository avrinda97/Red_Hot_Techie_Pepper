2009-08-19T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	you have to be in the right group to use it, you also need to take extra steps to do admin things
2009-08-19T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	you also are running the desktop and other apps as user so only apps yu run using sudo and gksudo are ran with elevated priveledges so makes your system more secure
2009-08-19T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	root is common to all *nix boxes, if the account is disabled then their is a 0% chance of the account being captured
2009-08-19T15:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	if it has a password this is increased and also programs running as root may be captured and their access used. If this is user then the access is drastically reduced
2009-08-19T15:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	so runnig irc clients and web browsers is hugely foolhardy
2009-08-19T15:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	then use   sudo -i     while you edit stuff
2009-08-19T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	you can exit / quit the sudo -i once you are done
2009-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	once the system is up and running, sudo is rarely needed
2011-03-09T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	are you accessing samba over wan?
2011-03-09T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	just checking, phew
2011-03-09T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	on the server run: sudo smbpasswd -a $USER  and use the same pass for smb as your user pass
2011-03-09T08:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	the admin can
2011-03-09T08:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	trie ufw ?
2011-03-09T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	should be fine
2011-12-04T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	when you say remotely, do you mean from outside your LAN?
2011-12-04T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	then you need to open port 21 TCP on your router
2011-12-04T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	ftp isn't a great idea to have talking to the WWW, I suggest you use SFTP which you wil get when you install openssh-server
2011-12-04T06:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	then i suggest you review your router config, connections from the world to your router will be processed by rules, connections on the port you set will then be forwarded into the LAN where you say
2011-12-04T06:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	its usually called port forwarding but sme routers call it virtual host
2011-12-04T06:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	the server will run on port 21 by default, check your port forwarding on your router matches your setup
2011-12-04T06:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	x404x	some home grade routers need a reboot to apply port forwarding
