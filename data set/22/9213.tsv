2005-03-01T08:03:00.000Z	Vjaz		Anyone with an OGG/Vorbis file and Rhythmbox? Does it crash if you play the OGG and then while playing rewind it to the beginning?
2005-03-01T08:05:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	rhythmbox has lots of bugs, unfortunately
2005-03-01T08:08:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	It does have a lot of bugs, but it will *continue* to have a lot of bugs if people don't report bugs like this, which is why I want to know if other people experience the same bug.
2005-03-01T08:08:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	I'll need to try this out in the newer version of Rhythmbox though, since this is 0.8.5 from Warty.
2005-06-12T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	did you update while it was running?
2005-06-12T08:35:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	Hm... I might have. There were some packages that needed an upgrade after the installation.
2005-06-12T08:35:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	quit and restart it
2005-06-12T08:35:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	firefox doesn't like being upgraded while it's running (known bug)
2005-06-12T08:36:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	Yep. That helped. Thanks.
2005-06-12T08:36:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	np
2005-06-12T08:36:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	I should had tried that, but I was under the impression it was still a fresh installation, so I figured restarting was pointless.
2005-06-12T08:36:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	ah
2005-06-12T08:38:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	User interface testing doesn't actually equal "caring what users think".
2005-06-12T08:39:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	how so?  you think they paid for it then ignored the results?
2005-06-12T08:39:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	GNOME is concerned about usability a lot, but often if a user says "I would really like feature X." they might not listen.
2005-06-12T08:39:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	see, users can't just say "I want foo" and complain if foo doesn't get implemented
2005-06-12T08:39:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	No, but I think the people doing the testing aren't actual users.
2005-06-12T08:40:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	how do you know that?
2005-06-12T08:40:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	I don't, but it'd be a pretty stupid test if all the testers were experienced GNOME-users.
2005-06-12T08:40:00.000Z	bob2	Vjaz	of course, hence I'd be very surprised if they did that
2005-06-12T08:44:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	I don't have an example of that, except that I'm pissed that there's no menu editor.
2005-06-12T08:44:00.000Z	Vjaz	bob2	But it's more of a comparison to KDE. I understand they've been quite "helpful" in implementing a lot of stuff users requested, which has resulted in crowded menus and such.
