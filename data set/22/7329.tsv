2006-06-11T16:22:00.000Z	Hattori		"-add "/usr/bin/startcompiz" to gnome session startup programs" --> what that thing means? and how to do that? is it possible to do that in terminal?
2006-06-11T16:23:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	You can add that line to a file called ".gnomerc" in your home folder (it will be a new file)
2006-06-11T16:24:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	"sudo pico /home/me/.gnomerc" and paste "/usr/bin/startcompiz"?
2006-06-11T16:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	Yes
2006-06-11T16:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	Depending on what is in that startcompiz script you may want to put "/usr/bin/startcompiz &"
2006-06-11T16:25:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	http://rafb.net/paste/results/OQ4x1i58.html
2006-06-11T16:26:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	OK, you don't need the & (because it is in that script)
2006-06-12T06:11:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	Just apt-get remove whatever you apt-get installed (you may want to keep the drivers like MEsa)
2006-06-12T06:11:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	Hang on..... GDM? That is quite important (if you use GNOME)
2006-06-12T06:11:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	i need to know what to remove..
2006-06-12T06:13:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	Look in whatever guide you followed and do the opposite. Usually just compiz-gnome and xserver-xgl
2006-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	Your window manager isn't running. GNOME uses Metacity for a window manager
2006-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	how to fix?
2006-06-12T16:57:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	how to fix?
2006-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	If you can run a command (alt-f2?) then run "metacity --replace"
2006-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	in a terminal?
2006-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	can't do via ssh right?
2006-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	In a terminal, deskbar, "run" dialog, anything which will let you run a command, as long as it is in X (ie. NOT ctrl-alt-f1)
2006-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	From a console you would need to put "DISPLAY=localhost:0" first I think
2006-06-12T05:01:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	unable to open X display, using ssh...
2006-06-12T05:02:00.000Z	Hattori	Warbo	unable to open X display, using ssh... with sudo metacity  DISPLAY=localhost:0 --replace
2006-06-12T05:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Hattori	OK, with the DISPLAY I meant run that first, to tell the console that it should use an X session for the display, then run metacity. That would be done as "DISPLAY=localhost:0 && metacity --replace"
