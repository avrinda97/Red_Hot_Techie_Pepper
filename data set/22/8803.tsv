2005-10-17T05:34:00.000Z	Xanadu		debugger i think the path of least pain would be to wait a day and download the Breezy final, and install gnome from the CD
2005-10-17T05:35:00.000Z	Xanadu		VR try gparted
2005-10-17T05:35:00.000Z	Xanadu		VR what type of partition you got?
2005-10-17T05:37:00.000Z	Xanadu		VR did gparted give a reason for not working?
2005-10-17T05:38:00.000Z	Xanadu		Trashcan what do you mean?
2005-10-17T05:38:00.000Z	Xanadu		VR yeah I don't think you can resize a mounted partition. Do you have a live cd?
2005-10-17T05:39:00.000Z	Xanadu		VR try unmount the relevant partition manually (umount /dev/hda1 or whatever it is)
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	Xanadu		VR if that doesn't work the command line tool is resize2fs (check out the man page on it)
2005-10-17T05:41:00.000Z	Xanadu		VR but I take no responsibility ;)
2005-10-17T05:42:00.000Z	Xanadu		guys I'm writing a review and article on Breezy for Tectonic. If anyone would like to contribute their experiences/impressions/personal involvement please /msg me
2005-10-17T05:43:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	it's not even out yet. ;)
2005-10-17T05:43:00.000Z	Xanadu	HiddenWolf	yeah but the preview has been out for quite a while
2005-10-17T05:43:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	true. :)
2005-10-17T05:44:00.000Z	Xanadu	HiddenWolf	I'd like to run the review as close to the launch as possible
2005-10-17T05:44:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	some oaf on osnews beat you to it, he 'reviewed' it already.
2005-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	beats me how you could call that anything but a preview, but still. :)
2005-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	Xanadu	HiddenWolf	I already ran a review on the preview edition ;)
2005-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	Xanadu	HiddenWolf	but I think my final review will be quite different
2005-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	nice
2005-10-17T05:48:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	nice to see you like it.
2005-10-17T05:50:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	I'm a groupie, really.
2005-10-17T05:51:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Xanadu	I've been around for a while, help out here, read lists, wiki, and chat up in -devel, but not a coder. :)
