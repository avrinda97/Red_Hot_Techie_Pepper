2007-02-01T13:46:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	check your DNS ? /etc/resolve.conf
2007-02-01T13:47:00.000Z	Bug2000	derxob	It doesn't have the 'e' in the name and has my router listed.
2007-02-01T13:48:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	try adding a real DNS server, in case your router is not supplying DNS.  eg. 4.2.2.2 should work as a DNS server
2007-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	Bug2000	derxob	Same problem.
2007-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	but you can ping your router?
2007-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	Bug2000	derxob	Ok, I can ping ip's so it must be the dns.
2007-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	exactly.
2007-02-01T13:50:00.000Z	Bug2000	derxob	should I rename the file to resolve.conf from resolv.conf?
2007-02-01T13:50:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	no, that was my mistake. it doesn't have an e
2007-02-01T13:51:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	remove your router from it and put nameserver 4.2.2.2 and save it.
2007-02-01T13:51:00.000Z	Bug2000	derxob	Sec.
2007-02-01T13:52:00.000Z	Bug2000	derxob	Workies, thanks. Got any others to add to the list?
2007-02-01T13:53:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	I'd check with your ISP and add theirs, though 4.2.2.2 is nice, it routes to your local area no matter where you are
2007-02-01T13:53:00.000Z	Bug2000	derxob	How do I check via my win
2007-02-01T13:53:00.000Z	derxob	Bug2000	windows?
2007-02-01T13:53:00.000Z	Bug2000		ya.
