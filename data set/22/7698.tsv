2006-08-25T11:18:00.000Z	phiber_optic		did anybody was able to configure Sound Blaster live 5.1 in dapper??
2006-08-25T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 ive had good luck with that card when i had one.. ages ago. :P
2006-08-25T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 got a more specific problem with it?
2006-08-25T11:19:00.000Z	phiber_optic	Dr_Willis	it was working on the previous version but know it is not detected
2006-08-25T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 you using the Digital out? or analog out?  ( or does it even hage that)
2006-08-25T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 Hmm..   so if you play a  wav file.. does it actually give an error? or does it just seem to play but makes no sound?
2006-08-25T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 Hmm..  you dual booting?
2006-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	phiber_optic	Dr_Willis	yes
2006-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 i recall AGES ago.. i had an odd sound card issue.. If i booted to windows.. then 'soft' rebooted to Linux. the card would not get confogured right.. IF i powerd down and booted straight to Linux it would work.
2006-08-25T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 some sort of PNP/bios oddity.
2006-08-25T11:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 chedk ya dmesg - it mention the card at all?
2006-08-25T11:26:00.000Z	phiber_optic	Dr_Willis	nop not mentioned
2006-08-25T11:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 odd..   may want to test out some of the other live cd's and see if you can prove its a kernel related (version) issue or not.
2006-08-25T11:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 and double check what module a working live cd is using for that card.
2006-09-02T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 best to learn to do the isntalls manually
2006-09-02T09:36:00.000Z	phiber_optic	Dr_Willis	sure... I fixed my sound problem
2006-09-02T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 about time! :P
2006-09-02T09:36:00.000Z	phiber_optic	Dr_Willis	it was a mobo prob
2006-09-03T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phiber_optic	 /usr/local/share most likely if as root..   or .themes (i think) as a user
2006-09-03T05:32:00.000Z	phiber_optic	Dr_Willis	thats whta i thought
