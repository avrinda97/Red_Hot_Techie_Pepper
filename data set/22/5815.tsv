2007-03-09T07:38:00.000Z	Slart		anyone here using eclipse?
2007-03-09T07:39:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	i am
2007-03-09T07:39:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	installed it using the repositories?
2007-03-09T07:39:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	dont remember
2007-03-09T07:39:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	I installed it and it's not working.. I just see the splash screen and then it exits
2007-03-09T07:40:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	try running it from the command line with the option -Xmx128M
2007-03-09T07:40:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	how much ram does your computer have?
2007-03-09T07:41:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	2Gb
2007-03-09T07:41:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	try something like -Xmx512M
2007-03-09T07:42:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	same thing, even with switch
2007-05-28T13:54:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	I think you'd be running your system with the older kernel..what did you expect? =)
2007-05-28T13:55:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	you would probably run into some problems if you tried running a 2.4 kernel instead of a 2.6 kernel.. but a small update shift probably won't kill anything big
2007-05-28T13:56:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	I'm just wondering if I want to take some of my old linux kernels off of my grub options... the list is about 4 long now
2007-05-28T13:57:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	you can config grub so that it only shows the N newest kernels in that list.. or even only the latest kernel.. check the grub config file, it's not that weird
2007-05-28T13:57:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	and the kernels don't use a lot of space unless you're running on a very limited system
2007-05-28T13:58:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	yeah, No big deal... it just that windows (which I never boot) goes farther and farther down the list
2007-05-28T13:59:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	I think I've changed mine to only show 2 linux kernels.. that makes the OS list somewhat shorter.. besides, if you really want to you can boot from any kernel by editing the boot line in grub.
2007-05-28T14:00:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	yeah, but I would never remember which ones I have... besides, it'd be kinda cool to have a long list of old linux kernels
2007-05-28T14:01:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	yes.. the chicks dig that ;)
2007-05-28T14:01:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	hey, the kinda chicks I want dig that
2007-05-28T14:02:00.000Z	premier_	Slart	is that how you get her in the mood?  Show her you awesmoe leet haxor skills?
2007-05-28T14:03:00.000Z	Slart	premier_	I've written a bash script.. saves some time ;)
