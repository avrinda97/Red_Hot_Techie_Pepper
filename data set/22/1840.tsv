2011-05-28T04:31:00.000Z	teage		connect to other machine via wireless cards that is
2011-05-28T04:31:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	If you can see the other machine in your network. You should use ssh with no problem.
2011-05-28T04:32:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	is there a way to communicate with no internet connection?
2011-05-28T04:35:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	Yes. I use ssh to communicate with my other machines in my lan.
2011-05-28T04:37:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	You are connecting from A machine to B machine. Does B machine have an ssh server running on it?
2011-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	Don't you have a router with dhcp ?
2011-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	: yes it does
2011-05-28T04:39:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	You do have the network manager...
2011-05-28T04:39:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	: no router
2011-05-28T04:40:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	: Just wifi cards. lappy connects via ethernet
2011-05-28T04:40:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	In network manager you should be able to create a wireless network in one of the computers.
2011-05-28T04:41:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	I do not understand your network setup. Can you ellaborate on that?
2011-05-28T04:42:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	: Yes, my lappy is in the kitchen connected via ethernet, Desktop in the living room with a wifi card usb connected and im trying to connect to it to transfer files
2011-05-28T04:43:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	Lappy connects via ethernet to ROUTERA. And Desktop connects to ROUTERA too.     Is that your setup  ?
2011-05-28T04:44:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	: both have 10,04 installed, BorgTK2001, yes I want to use both wiif cards to communicate
2011-05-28T04:45:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	Lappy has a ethernet cable device and a wifi device. You want Lappy wifi device to communicate with Desktop wifi device without any ROUTERA intervention at all.   Is it that ?
2011-05-28T04:46:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	yes, would adhoc work?
2011-05-28T04:47:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	You can create a new wireless network on Desktop. Network icon -> Create a new wireless network
2011-05-28T04:47:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	tried that but maybe i did something wrong. will try again
2011-05-28T04:48:00.000Z	adrian15	teage	Did you try to connect from Lappy to that new wireless network?
2011-05-28T04:50:00.000Z	teage	adrian15	no i didnt, and yes that worked. adhoc network. thank you for barring with me. ;)
