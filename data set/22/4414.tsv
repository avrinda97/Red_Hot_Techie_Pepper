2008-12-14T18:55:00.000Z	Djerkaf		Is there some quick way to reset Ubuntu, so everything is like after a fresh installation?
2008-12-14T18:56:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	what told you to reboot?  Anyway, System->Preferences-Screen Resolution
2008-12-14T18:57:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	I set my TV as second screen, and I was told to reboot
2008-12-14T18:57:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	The screen resolution "window" doesn't do anything for me.
2008-12-14T18:58:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	do you still have the TV plugged in?
2008-12-14T18:58:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	No.
2008-12-14T18:59:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	have you rebooted since unplugging the TV
2008-12-14T18:59:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	Yes.
2008-12-14T18:59:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	Have tried to change drivers, but no change.
2008-12-14T18:59:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	have you clicked "detect displays"
2008-12-14T18:59:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	Yes.
2008-12-14T18:59:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	oh right.  what have you tried to change it to?
2008-12-14T19:00:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	I'm not at that computer now, but I set it to some Ati Radeon thingie, because I found out that is what's inside the computer.
2008-12-14T19:01:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	try  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh  which will ask it to run the driver autodetection again
2008-12-14T19:01:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	I did try that...
2008-12-14T19:01:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	But, then my keyboard stopped working completely
2008-12-14T19:02:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	So I guess I have to reinstall. But then I want to try something different...
2008-12-14T19:02:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	try it without the '-phigh' and you will be given an option to confirm each step in the autodetction (such as selecting a different keyboard)
2008-12-14T19:03:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	I forgot this part before I asked my question here. After rebooting the last time, - after the reconfiguring, the keyboard didn't work, and therefor I couldn't login :( I fucked it up.
2008-12-14T19:04:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	But, is there some OS I should try, that is more user friendly than Ubuntu...?
2008-12-14T19:04:00.000Z	sladen	Djerkaf	reboot, select "(single user mode)" from the boot list and enter the reconfiguration here
2008-12-14T19:05:00.000Z	Djerkaf	sladen	I'll try that. Thanks.
