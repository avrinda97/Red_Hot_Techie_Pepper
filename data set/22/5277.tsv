2009-11-12T15:23:00.000Z	matju		hi, with 9.04, how do i get gnome-display-properties to redetect my builtin LCD screen properly, instead of pretending it's max 1024x768 ? failing that, how do i disable scaling, so that it looks like 768 lines instead of 800 ? (hard on my eyes)
2009-11-12T15:23:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	what graphics card?
2009-12-10T04:06:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	a-ha, never heard of that command
2009-12-10T04:07:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	no, i only get four /dev/sda partitions... main hard disk
2009-12-10T04:07:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	waht about fdisk -l   like ActionParsnip said
2009-12-10T04:15:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	should be sd probably
2009-12-10T04:25:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	cddrive probably
2009-12-10T04:36:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	i have no idea, im not so good at getting devices to be detected if they dont work out of the box
2009-12-11T06:44:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	how did you try to mount it?
2009-12-11T06:45:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	at first i got i/o errors, i unmounted, disconnected, reconnected, mounted with the drive icon, then used the «mount» command, then added «-t ext2» to see whether it's any different
2009-12-11T06:46:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	and then i tried dumpe2fs to find a superblock, but it complains that it can't find a valid superblock, so, i wonder, where do i go from there?
2009-12-11T06:46:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	the partition table is still valid though.
2009-12-11T06:47:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	im not sure of anything else to try sorry
2009-12-11T06:48:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	how much time would a dumpe2fs take, to run? it doesn't seem to be reading anything at all.
2009-12-11T06:48:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	in dmesg, i see «ext4» complaining about unsupported features, but i never used ext4
2009-12-11T06:49:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	idk how much time
2009-12-11T06:54:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	ok, i'm gonna try to solve the problem the microsoft way : i'm gonna try a reboot.
2009-12-11T06:54:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	ha, doubt it will work
2009-12-11T06:55:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	i doubt it too, because i tried deconnecting and reconnecting the câble. otherwise i'd thing that it could be bad RAM...
2009-12-11T06:56:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	4-5 years ago i had an app that consistently crashed the PNG decoder in Linux, until i rebooted. it was the RAM. one bit wrong, out of 4 billion.
2009-12-11T06:56:00.000Z	Billiard	matju	ha
2009-12-11T06:57:00.000Z	matju	Billiard	but then, it was new RAM. if old RAM is broken, i'd be surprised. RAM that survives 4 years of daily use normally gets upgraded long before it dies.
