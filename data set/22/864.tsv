2011-10-27T10:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	BURG isn't supported here. Do you know if 1680x1050 is a supported *VESA* mode on your hardware?
2011-10-27T10:23:00.000Z	Vustom	Jordan_U	How to I check?
2011-10-27T10:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	"videoinfo" from the grub shell (requires you to reboot to get to the grub shell).
2011-10-27T10:25:00.000Z	Vustom	Jordan_U	I'm using 1680x1050 on the desktop as we speak, so wouldn't that mean yes?
2011-10-27T10:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	Not neccisarily. That's using native drivers, not VESA.
2011-10-27T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	No, you can't change what modes your hardware supports via VESA.
2011-12-10T08:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	What is your end goal?
2011-12-10T08:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	Please explain your end goal.
2011-12-10T08:24:00.000Z	Vustom	Jordan_U	I told you, I have a .IMG and a .ISO, they need to be on a separate partition on the same USB storage device
2011-12-10T08:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	I assume you want two Live distros on your USB drive at once?
2011-12-10T08:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Vustom	What you've described so far is a step, not an end goal. What distro and what bootloader?
