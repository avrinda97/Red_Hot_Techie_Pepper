2005-06-09T14:48:00.000Z	dooglus		it somehow turns the power off
2005-06-09T14:49:00.000Z	dooglus		it's happened 3 times now.
2005-06-09T14:49:00.000Z	dooglus		I'm grepping through a 17Mb file - is there a limit?
2005-06-09T14:50:00.000Z	dooglus		the grep takes 3 or 4 minutes, during which time the CPU is flat out, and the disk is idle.
2005-06-09T14:51:00.000Z	dooglus		I'm surprised at that - I would expect the bottleneck during a grep to be the disk access, reading the file from disk.
2005-06-09T14:52:00.000Z	dooglus		now, it's possible the 17Mb file is already cached in RAM
2005-06-09T14:52:00.000Z	dooglus		but how long would it take to 'grep' though a 17Mb file that's in RAM?
2005-06-09T14:52:00.000Z	dooglus		seconds?  minutes?
2005-06-09T14:52:00.000Z	dooglus		(2.2MHz P4)
2005-06-09T14:52:00.000Z	dooglus		GHz!
2005-06-09T14:53:00.000Z	peterretief	dooglus	try reinstall grep
2005-06-09T14:53:00.000Z	dooglus	peterretief	md5sum /bin/grep ?
2005-06-09T14:54:00.000Z	peterretief	dooglus	its my first line of defense..... :)
2005-06-09T14:55:00.000Z	dooglus	peterretief	what is?
2005-06-09T15:16:00.000Z	peterretief	dooglus	what grep commmand are you using
2005-06-09T15:21:00.000Z	dooglus	peterretief	I'm running this:    time yes | head -10000 | grep '.' > /dev/null
2005-06-09T15:21:00.000Z	dooglus	peterretief	it should take a second or less, but it takes 15 to 20 seconds.
2005-06-09T15:23:00.000Z	peterretief	dooglus	takes about .5 secs here?
2005-06-09T15:25:00.000Z	dooglus	peterretief	could you try 2 more cases for me please?  instead of 10,000 try 100 thousand and 200 thousand.  what times do you get for those 2?
2005-06-09T15:25:00.000Z	peterretief	dooglus	im on ubuntu
2005-06-09T15:27:00.000Z	peterretief	dooglus	10000 hangs - ahh
2005-06-09T15:27:00.000Z	dooglus	peterretief	it doesn't hang - it just takes a long time - 20 seconds or so?
