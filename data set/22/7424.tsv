2006-08-07T14:26:00.000Z	harisund		Anybody familiar with regexps here? What do the \( and )\ do ?
2006-08-07T14:27:00.000Z	harisund		mew I always see \(...\) together?
2006-08-07T14:27:00.000Z	harisund		sorry it is \) and not )\
2006-08-07T14:28:00.000Z	harisund		because?
2006-08-07T14:29:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	without the escapes...
2006-08-14T14:19:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	just enough to make 64bit tempting
2006-08-14T14:20:00.000Z	harisund	mcphail	:( that's real bad.. I was wondering somebody would say "not so much" and I wouldn't feel guilty about the fact that I am not able to get my wireless LAN card working on that (BCM 4318)
2006-08-14T14:20:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	the problems of 64 bit outweigh the benefits in my book
2006-08-14T14:21:00.000Z	harisund	mcphail	hmm.. do you know perhaps where I could get 64bit drivers? Or could I make my wireless card work under a 32bit chroot using ndiswrapper and Windows drivers?
2006-08-14T14:21:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	you wont get _drivers_ working in a chroot. Your kernel remains 64 bit.
2006-08-14T14:22:00.000Z	harisund	mcphail	aaaa I was afraid of that. Oh well, looks like I will wait till I am able to buy a 64bit desktop
2006-08-14T14:22:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	you could buy a new nic...
2006-08-14T14:23:00.000Z	harisund	mcphail	oh yeah didn't think of that :) .. let's see.. so do you have any suggestions for external (PCMCIA perhaps, or USB) wireless NICs that have native 64bit support under Linux (Particularly Ubuntu)>
2006-08-14T14:24:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	no experience, i'm afraid. You'd imagine the opensource drivers (such as ralink) would compile under 64bit
2006-08-14T14:25:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	good luck
2006-08-16T11:15:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	probably. You can run vmware workstation on 64 bit
2006-08-16T11:16:00.000Z	harisund	mcphail	I want to run the free version that is available online :)
2006-08-16T11:16:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	yes, but that has come out after workstation, so will probably work
2006-08-16T11:16:00.000Z	harisund	mcphail	ok thanks :)
2006-08-23T10:42:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	it would probably work, but isn't there a better way?
2006-08-23T11:30:00.000Z	harisund	mcphail	I thought he said he didn't want to reboot ... reboot should be the final option on any Unix box.
2006-08-23T11:30:00.000Z	mcphail	harisund	i agree
