2006-10-14T07:46:00.000Z	anon32		it only takes on nuke to start a global war that'll destroy the earth
2006-10-14T07:48:00.000Z	anon32		question: what are w32codecs and why does Ubuntu not distribute them?
2006-10-14T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	they are a bunch of window's dll's
2006-10-14T07:48:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	ah
2006-10-16T16:44:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	that's nice and all, but is there something that the bot doesn't know? I've seen that page hundreds of times
2006-10-16T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	the restricted wiki page explains flash installation.  You need flashplugin-nonfree from multiverse
2006-10-16T16:45:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	again... I'm asking if there's alternatives... I know that the Adobe one is buggy
2006-10-16T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	not really, you can try gnash
2006-10-16T16:47:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	mm... the gnash installation is convoluted and for some reason, there's no deb for it..
2006-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	right
2006-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	what's wrong with adobe's flash player for you?
2006-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	audio-video sync error....
2006-10-21T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	no, that's now how ubuntu does it.  edgy is edgy, next release is feisty
2006-10-21T07:20:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	feisty *is* the current edgy
2006-10-21T07:20:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	feisty is dapper+2
2006-10-21T07:20:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	???
2006-10-21T07:23:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	"edgy+1 will be Feisty Fawn"
2006-10-22T15:17:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	iso's are free to download
2006-10-25T06:30:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	system > administration > services
2006-10-25T06:30:00.000Z	anon32	jrib	not just the ones in there
2006-10-25T06:30:00.000Z	jrib	anon32	man update-rc.d
