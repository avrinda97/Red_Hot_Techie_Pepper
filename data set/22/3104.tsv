2009-05-13T01:23:00.000Z	ManDay		whats the weirdo root kernel parameter ubuntu has there?
2009-05-13T01:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	It uses a UUID instead of /dev/sdXX
2010-05-09T11:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	grub legacy's menu.lst was really two different config files in one, the parts of the file that weren't commented were read by grub at boot, the parts with one comment (#)were read by update-grub, and the parts with two comments (##) were really comments. With grub2 /boot/grub/grub.cfg is read by grub at boot, and /etc/default/grub is read by update-grub.
2010-05-09T11:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	In grub2 features are separated into modules, so if you don't want to use theming (or raid, or LVM, or internationalization support, or support for the blind) then that module simply won't be used.
2010-05-09T11:25:00.000Z	ManDay	Jordan_U	fair enough
2010-05-15T00:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	Is it only certain files / players or do all sounds have "cracks"?
2010-05-15T00:13:00.000Z	ManDay	Jordan_U	certain files only - want an example?
2010-05-15T00:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	Sure
2010-05-15T00:14:00.000Z	ManDay	Jordan_U	?
2010-05-15T00:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	I don
2010-05-15T00:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	Nvm, I hear the cracks now
2010-05-15T00:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	mp3gain -r -k seems to have fixed the file
2010-05-15T01:04:00.000Z	ManDay	Jordan_U	thanks, ill try!
2010-05-15T01:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	You're welcome.
2010-05-15T01:12:00.000Z	ManDay	Jordan_U	can i assume that mp3gain did NOT change the volume? because thats not what i want
2010-06-12T14:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	Because firefox is already running, and you'r just telling it to open a new tab in the already running process (which was never connected to your terminal)
2010-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	Yes, it does mean that, but you can often get updated versions of programs from third party PPAs
2010-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	ManDay	Jordan_U	is there maybe a complete PPA which holds all packages at the latest?
2010-07-11T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	No, you have to pick a PPA per program.
2010-07-11T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	You're welcome.

2011-03-30T20:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ManDay	Any particular reason you're using grub legacy rather than grub2? Using grub2 simplifies this type of thing greatly.
