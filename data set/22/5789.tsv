2007-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	try searching in azureus forums?
2007-04-01T06:43:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	depends of who made the package
2007-04-01T06:45:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	its probably somewhere in your home folde rtho
2007-04-01T06:52:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	I have many ideas
2007-04-01T06:53:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	but I was making coffee, so I probably missed something
2007-04-01T06:54:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	I do not use nor have ever installed azureus
2007-04-01T06:55:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	gtorrent and ktorrent
2007-04-01T06:57:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	you're looking for something like ktorrent i believe
2007-04-01T06:57:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	did you install is at normal user?
2007-04-01T07:05:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	the usual way for me is apt-get install, but that happens, yes
2007-04-01T07:07:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	usually tarballs mean source, then you have to compile
2007-04-01T07:08:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	tarballs are really just archives, so anything can be in there
2007-04-01T07:09:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	yes
2007-04-01T07:09:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	well .debs are usually handier
2007-04-01T07:15:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	no idea
2007-04-01T07:16:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	I do, I have no idea what its based on, thought it was a tweaked version of the official bt client
2007-04-01T07:17:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	okay, had no idea it changed name
2007-04-01T07:18:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	it gets updated when ubuntu wants it
2007-04-01T07:22:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	kingcobra	i think so
