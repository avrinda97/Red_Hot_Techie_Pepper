2012-04-28T20:12:00.000Z	allure		Hi... when trying to update to 12.04 from 11.10, I get the message "It was not possible to calculate the update". How should I proceed to upload?
2012-04-28T20:12:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	is it network failure ?
2012-04-28T20:12:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	nope :(
2012-04-28T20:14:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	re-launch your update manager may help , it should be dependency problem
2012-04-28T20:14:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	i mean the package list downloaded maybe in-complete ..
2012-04-28T20:15:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	I tried that... next step is purging all ppas
2012-04-28T20:15:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	take a look here http://markmail.org/thread/fgo5e7hl6qanvk2f , do you have any error message ?
2012-04-28T20:15:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	ppas are disabled during update .. IIRC
2012-04-28T20:16:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	my issue is quite similar to the one this guy had
2012-04-28T20:16:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	any error message ? there might be some "icon" you can click on , that shows the details
2012-04-28T20:17:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	I'll rerun to see the error again... it takes a while to get to that stage, just a min

2012-04-28T20:20:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	the same issue the guy reported on the mail list you showed me
2012-04-28T20:21:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	can you translate the line started with "E:" ?
2012-04-28T20:23:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	It is impossible to correct the problems, you kept on hold broken packages.
2012-04-28T20:25:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	should I just fresh install 12.04? :-/
2012-04-28T20:25:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	sorry i can't help you then .. maybe you can try laterly , in a few days , or report a bug to ubuntu
2012-04-28T20:25:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	burn a desktop CD is the easiest
2012-04-28T20:25:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	the bug has been reported already... let's hope they fix it then :)
2012-04-28T20:26:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	thank you anyway. :)
2012-04-28T20:30:00.000Z	Hoyt	allure	you can write a simple bash script , so next time you install new Ubuntu , just execute that script
2012-04-28T20:31:00.000Z	allure	Hoyt	cool idea =)
