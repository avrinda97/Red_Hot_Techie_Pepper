2005-11-25T17:13:00.000Z	somerville32		I'm having trouble configuring grub, can someone help?
2005-11-25T17:13:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	what's the question?
2005-11-25T17:13:00.000Z	somerville32	nollidj	When I select to boot windows, it says bad disk or something to that effect
2005-11-25T17:14:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	can you pastebin your menu.lst ?

2005-11-25T17:17:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	what is the exact error message you get?  is your windows partition truly /dev/hdb1?
2005-11-25T17:17:00.000Z	somerville32	nollidj	My windows partition is /dev/hdc1
2005-11-25T17:17:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	then change (hd1,0) to (hd2,0)
2005-11-25T17:18:00.000Z	somerville32	nollidj	But linux is on the same drive as windows
2005-11-25T17:19:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	(hdN,Q) = /dev/hd[N=0, a; N=1, b; N=2, c] [Q-1] 
2005-11-25T17:19:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	if your windows partition is hdc1, then root should be (hd2,0) for booting to windows
2005-11-25T17:20:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	if you paste your whole menu.lst, maybe there is some confusion about how linux is set to boot...
2005-11-25T17:20:00.000Z	somerville32	nollidj	k

2005-11-25T17:25:00.000Z	somerville32	nollidj	Did you get the link?
2005-11-25T17:31:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	sorry for the delay...
2005-11-25T17:32:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	i see what you were saying... sorry for misunderstanding.  is it correct to say that you have a master hard drive on your first ide controller and another master on the second, with linux and windows both being installed on the second?
2005-11-25T17:33:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	also, is your /boot located on a separate partition?
2005-11-25T17:42:00.000Z	somerville32	nollidj	Correct
2005-11-25T17:43:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	ok, sorry for the confusion... windows should indeed be on (hd1,0) for you, then.  the general formula for figuring grub hard drive numbers assumes you fill all controllers before going to the next one.  sorry for the false assumption
2005-11-25T17:43:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	so we're back to square 1... what exactly is the error message you get?
2005-11-25T17:47:00.000Z	nollidj	somerville32	sure, let me set the umode...
