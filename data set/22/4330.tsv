2008-01-18T23:41:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	system, preferences, appearance
2008-01-18T23:41:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	the options for changing themes and setting them up is all in there
2008-01-18T23:52:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	use the install button on the themes thing to install the file with the icons
2008-01-18T23:52:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	then customise a theme to use those icons under the icon tab
2008-01-18T23:54:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	gnome-look.org
2008-01-18T23:54:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	what the bot says
2008-01-19T00:08:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	can you see everything fine?
2008-01-19T00:09:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	that can mean that you're just using a standard theme, without having customised it
2008-01-19T00:09:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	did you save your theme when you changed it?
2008-01-19T00:10:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	in that case it'll be using the theme you selected.. when you customise a theme it creates a temporary theme to store your customness.. if that makes sense
2008-01-19T00:11:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	so when you havent customised a theme without saving it, the custom theme doesnt appear
2008-01-19T00:11:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	the default one is called "human" :)
2008-01-19T00:12:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	back to normal? other than wallpaper
2008-01-19T00:13:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	well you've been there and back again which is the main thing. back again is usually the hard part heh
2008-01-19T00:13:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	a custom dark one that i made :) standard icons and such though
2008-01-19T00:13:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	fancy 3d window borders though
2008-01-19T00:19:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	my mouse is under my own control at the moment :)
2008-01-19T00:20:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	what Flannel said aswell
2008-01-19T00:21:00.000Z	Pygmymath	ally_xoxo	just heard about it today, thankyou for reminding me to check it out :D
