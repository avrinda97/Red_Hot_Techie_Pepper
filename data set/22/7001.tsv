2007-08-01T10:08:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	why?
2007-08-01T10:09:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	how about with a new user?
2007-08-01T10:10:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	you need to address the person you are speaking to or we won't be sure what you are asking
2007-08-13T07:31:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	personally, I'd try mplayer for the real media stuff first so you don't have to install such an ugly thing like realplayer :)
2007-08-13T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	have you installed w32codecs?
2007-08-13T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	k, follow directions from ubotu for realplayer I guess
2007-08-13T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	did you read the link from ubotu?
2007-08-13T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	or scipio's looks even better because it gets mplayer to play them
2007-08-13T07:37:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	stop pasting here and read what people link you to please
2007-08-13T07:41:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	you need to be more specific.  What exactly did you try that isn't working?  and how isn't it working (error messages, etc.)?
2007-08-21T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	you can install google earth with your favorite package manager if you enable the medibuntu repos
2007-11-19T21:03:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	what are you trying to install exactly?
2007-11-19T21:04:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	get it from the medibuntu repo
2008-02-08T20:19:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	so give www-data write permissions
2008-02-08T20:19:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	ugh ignore that
2008-02-16T21:35:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	did you follow the wiki instructions to get rar support?
2008-11-01T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	use system -> administration -> hardware drivers
2008-11-01T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	why do you ask for help, but ignore what you are told?  Also, stop pasting here.
2008-11-13T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	you want to hide all icons on the desktop?
2008-11-20T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	what about it?
2008-11-20T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	pawan	did you read what ubottu told you?
