2010-10-01T19:10:00.000Z	trelayne	Turboz	I want to access a web page existing on example.com using http://localhost:10180 though
2010-10-01T19:10:00.000Z	trelayne		so it has to say :80, no?
2010-10-01T19:11:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	i changed it to :81 .. wont that pass the proxy, then use 2020 or 2021
2010-10-01T19:11:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	:21 can also work etc
2010-10-01T19:11:00.000Z	trelayne	Turboz	 no it doesn't work...
2010-10-01T19:12:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	Facinatingly cool :)
2010-10-01T19:13:00.000Z	trelayne	Turboz	 nah it doesn't work. I've done this in past.... it's probably a config issue in ssh
2010-10-01T19:14:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	But bypassing a proxy isnt that hard. Use HTTP_PROXY="YourProxy" to redirect the flow thru it.
2010-10-01T19:15:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	But bypassing a proxy isnt that hard. Use export HTTP_PROXY="YourProxy" to redirect the flow thru it.
2010-10-01T19:15:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	tack on a proxydns:port if required
2010-10-01T19:16:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	tack on a proxyhost:port if required.

2010-10-01T19:17:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	My geekdom is great :P (25 years atleast) coding and serverings
2010-10-01T19:17:00.000Z	trelayne	Turboz	 well then that proves my point that you're more geek than me LOL.
2010-10-01T19:18:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	Neck, back and stuff, not so fine. But with some beers as a mild pain reliever and BAM! Its all good :P
2010-10-01T19:21:00.000Z	Turboz	trelayne	Evil cops crashed into a "late night cab" i got a hold of leaving the car all destroyed and me in a very backbrakingly painful state. No effort was made by the police to even check if i was ok.
