2009-03-07T02:38:00.000Z	kiris		I really don't want to have to start compiling my kernel all the time to get the full 4GB of memory. does anyone know of a desktop kernel package with PAE enabled?
2009-03-07T02:39:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	what is PAE?
2009-03-07T02:40:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	some kernel option that is apparently going to help me actually use all of my memory
2009-03-07T02:41:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	how much mem do you have bro
2009-03-07T02:41:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	just 4GB, but it's limited to 3.2GB on 32-bit, it seems
2009-03-07T02:42:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	do you have 32bit?
2009-03-07T02:42:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	yes
2009-03-07T02:42:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	what processor do you have?
2009-03-07T02:42:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	pentium core 2 quad
2009-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	why not use 64bit version?
2009-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	my pentium is not 64-bit
2009-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	same processor as me.  Its quad core you said
2009-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	problem solved
2009-03-07T02:46:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	just load an entire new ISO of Ubuntu?
2009-03-07T02:46:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	or you could play with PAE for fun
2009-03-07T02:46:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	is it possible to upgrade a 32-bit ubuntu to 64-bit? or will I have to install fresh ?
2009-03-07T02:47:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	you have istall fresh
2009-03-07T02:47:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	well I guess I've barely installed anything yet so it's not a big problem
2009-03-07T02:49:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	no, it shows 3.2GB just the same
2009-03-07T02:51:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	I have 3 and only notices 2.9G
2009-03-07T02:53:00.000Z	turtle_	kiris	Linux has had 64 bit and been developing for it for years,  i have no issues with mine
2009-03-07T02:53:00.000Z	kiris	turtle_	good
