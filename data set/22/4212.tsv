2008-02-17T22:31:00.000Z	dishayu		anyone home?
2008-02-17T22:32:00.000Z	dishayu		i'm new to linux.... my monitor supports 1280 x 1024 reso... but ubuntu doesn't show that resolution as an option ever since i'm using the restricted drivers
2008-02-17T22:33:00.000Z	dishayu		nvidia 7300GT 512MB
2008-02-17T22:33:00.000Z	dishayu		core 2 duo 2.2Ghz
2008-02-17T22:33:00.000Z	dishayu		ubuntu 7.10
2008-02-17T22:33:00.000Z	dishayu		2GB RAM
2008-02-17T22:34:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	desktop? and try to use the enter key less ;]
2008-02-17T22:34:00.000Z	dishayu	bazhang	: gnome
2008-02-17T22:35:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	heh I meant is this a desktop computer?
2008-02-17T22:37:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	I have that same card and my monitor supports 1680x1050 with the restricted drivers--is that truly the limit of that monitor?
2008-02-17T22:38:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	and trying to change the settings results in nothing? what resolution are you on now? and what does the restricted drivers manager say about what card you are using? the nv or the nvidia?
2008-02-17T22:40:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	no that would not be an issue as I use the same drivers
2008-02-17T22:40:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	sounds like you need to reconfigure your xorg.conf--want a link?
2008-02-17T22:48:00.000Z	dishayu	bazhang	: regarding my 1280 reso problem... is it possible that the 64-bit version is causing a trouble or 2??
2008-02-17T22:49:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	I doubt that
2008-02-17T22:49:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	you comfortable doing some editing of config files?
2008-02-17T22:50:00.000Z	dishayu	bazhang	: done
2008-02-17T22:53:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	you went through the whole thing? just enter default if you dont know the answer
2008-02-17T23:00:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	success?
2008-02-17T23:00:00.000Z	bazhang	dishayu	haha with the sir--I'm used to hey you ;]
2008-12-02T21:08:00.000Z	dishayu	bazhang	: yes they do
