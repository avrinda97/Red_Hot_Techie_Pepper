2007-04-20T07:41:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	you might look into LVM.  Which allows you to resize partitions on the fly
2007-04-20T07:44:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	Gparted is a program to format stuff.  LVM is a system of partitioning that allows you to shift stuff around later.
2007-04-20T07:44:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	shift it around later?
2007-04-20T07:45:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	yeah.  If you have 100GB /home and 10 on /, and you find youre running out of space, you can move some /home to /, without even rebooting
2007-04-20T07:45:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	oh i see what you mean. is it made for gnome or kde? or independent of both?
2007-04-20T07:46:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	it's completely independant.  Here's some more info: http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lvm/  nice graphics and stuff.  You'll need the alternate CD though, Desktop doesn't have support for it.
2007-04-20T07:46:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	obviously, all the compiling and stuff on that page doesn't apply to ubuntu.  But the opening paragraphs explain LVM really well
2007-04-20T07:46:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	what other differences are there for the alternate vs normal?
2007-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	Alternate is a textmode installer, instead of a lvieCD.  You boot up, and go straiht to the installer.  Alternate also has additional options (a GUI-less install, OEM install, etc)
2007-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	*excuse me
2007-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	oh, Aternate CD also has a repository on it.  So you get full ubntu install + additional packages without the internet.
2007-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	cd or dvd?
2007-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	CD
2007-04-20T07:49:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	why would anyone do the normal over the alternate then?
2007-04-20T07:49:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	because some people like the liveCD aspect, and the pretty GUI installer.
2007-04-20T07:50:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	hmmm
2007-04-20T10:01:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	irssi is.
2007-04-20T10:01:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	does anyone use the gnome frontend for xchat?
2007-04-20T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	xchat-gnome is in main, "xchat" is in universe.
2007-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	MrMakeveli	no.  Theyre different. Most people prefer the latter.
2007-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	thank god, i thought i was the only one
2007-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	Flannel	it could be a little more pretty, but i think i enjoy it more
