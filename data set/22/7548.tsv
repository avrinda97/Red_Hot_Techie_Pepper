2006-03-28T15:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	albinoblacksh33p	if you can't find anything on www.ubuntuforums.org there is this howto fromt he wine site. http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?versionId=4031  although you shouldn't really need to follow their directions for installing wine.  Sinceyou got it via apt-get
2006-03-28T15:47:00.000Z	chuckyp	albinoblacksh33p	i've provided you with more than enough ways of doing it.
2006-03-28T15:47:00.000Z	chuckyp	albinoblacksh33p	you may actually have to read a website for directions
2006-03-28T15:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	albinoblacksh33p	ubotu is a bot that we can use to save us typing so we can have him send you messages with directions.
2006-03-28T15:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	albinoblacksh33p	you may have to click on the link it provided and follow the directions.
2006-03-28T15:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	albinoblacksh33p	I don't think anyone here isn't going to spoon feed you if you can't read the link.
