2007-12-01T09:28:00.000Z	pg		How can I copy an Ubuntu installation from one disk to a larger one?
2007-12-01T09:28:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	partimage, dd, etc.
2007-12-01T09:31:00.000Z	pg	scguy318	I used dd from the original disk to a partition on another disk.  The new disk had another version of Ubuntu installed on another partition, and I can't make it boot copied installation.
2007-12-02T09:55:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	check your menu.lst probably
2007-12-02T09:56:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	and such, too tired to say more
2007-12-05T10:30:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	negligible difference
2007-12-05T10:31:00.000Z	pg	scguy318	is one faster?
2007-12-05T10:31:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	not really, they're pretty similar
2007-12-05T10:31:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	go with what you want
2007-12-05T10:34:00.000Z	pg	scguy318	if I want to add more RAM later, can I resize the swap partition or add a new one?
2007-12-05T10:34:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	yes
2007-12-05T10:39:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	because it's so wasteful
2007-12-05T10:39:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	and if you need that much RAM for Firefox, install more RAM!
2007-12-05T10:39:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	swap space is VERY slow
2007-12-05T10:40:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	you only need swap space as big as RAM in order to hibernate or something
2007-12-05T10:40:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	2*RAM was great in the days of DOS, when you could count on 8 MB max
2007-12-05T10:40:00.000Z	pg	scguy318	Thanks.  Yet the advice is 2*ram for ram <= 2Gb, right?
2007-12-05T10:40:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	dont bother with 2*RAM at all
2007-12-05T10:41:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	and thus need more RAM :)
2008-01-27T06:51:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	perhaps trackerd?
2008-01-27T06:54:00.000Z	scguy318	pg	I am not sure then
2008-01-27T06:55:00.000Z	pg	scguy318	are you able to put your hdd to sleep in Ubuntu?
