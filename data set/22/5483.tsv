2009-09-29T05:11:00.000Z	bobbob1016_		I have files starting and ending with a '-' without quotes, I can't seem to move them via commandline.  I'd like to be able to SSH this, which would mean I need to do them via terminal, any ideas?
2009-09-29T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	Most commands will accept "--" as an argument to mean that whatever follows should *not* be considered an argument
2009-09-29T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	You can also do something like instead of "-fiename" use "./-filename"
2009-09-29T05:13:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	I did "mv -foo.bar- /path/to/location" and it said "invalid option
2009-09-29T05:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	"mv -- -foo.bar- /path/to/location"
2009-09-29T05:14:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	That seemed to work.  Any way I can auto-remove those padding '-'s?
2009-09-29T05:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	Not sure if this is what you mean but "rename" can do batch renaming of files
2009-09-29T05:16:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	Yeah, I want to rename them, to the same name, just without the '-'s
2009-09-29T05:16:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	I could do them one at a time, but I'd prefer a command that could do it
2009-09-29T05:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	try "rename -v --no-act -- 's/-//g' *" if that looks right then remove the "--no-act" to actually change the file names
2009-09-29T05:20:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	One last thing, how would I get it to remove duplicates, as in ones with either (1) or (2) or whatever in the name?
2009-09-29T05:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	rm -i *{1,2,3,4}
2009-09-29T05:23:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	Would that remove everything with a {1} or just a 1, or a (1)?
2009-09-29T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	That would just remove files that ended in 1,2,3,or4, to remove anything with a number try "rm -i *{1,2,3,4}*"
2009-09-29T05:26:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	So rm -i *{(1),(2),(3),(4)}* would remove everything with a number in parenthesis?
2009-09-29T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	Yes
2009-09-29T05:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	Be sure to always use -i when you are using wild cards with rm, one extra space before a '*' and you are removing everything :)
2009-09-29T05:28:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	It says syntax error, unexpected token '(', so should I try *\({1,2,3,4}\)* or something?
2009-09-29T05:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	Yes
2009-09-29T05:29:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	Thanks, helped a lot.
2009-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bobbob1016_	np
2009-09-29T05:31:00.000Z	bobbob1016_	Jordan_U	I'm a comp-sci major, but my school dropped the Unix-programming class before I could take it, again, thanks for helping
