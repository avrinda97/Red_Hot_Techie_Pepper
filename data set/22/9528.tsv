2005-06-05T07:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	you put the cd in your drive and re-boot...press and hold the c button while it boots
2005-06-05T07:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	your installing on a seperate computer jsut for Linux or are you dual-booting with windows ?
2005-06-05T07:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	AA ?
2005-06-05T07:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	ohh
2005-06-05T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	your installing Ubuntu right or AA ?
2005-06-05T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	it's just a file that ends in .sh or .bin right ?
2005-06-05T07:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	perfect
2005-06-05T07:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	do you know where you downloaded the AA installer file ?
2005-06-05T07:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	you need to cd to the directory holding the file and type sh whateverAAsfilename.run is from within gnome-terminal
2005-06-05T07:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	first hit alt+F2 and type gnome-terminal (press enter) then type cd Desktop then sudo sh theAAfile.run (enter your user account password)
2005-06-05T07:56:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geetergod	it's large file it takes a while to decompress ;)
