2012-09-13T03:29:00.000Z	Troy^		XFCE ftw
2012-09-13T03:31:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	You could actually make Xfce look a little nicer by changing the panel.
2012-09-13T03:31:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	Spotted someone who had an Xfce desktop with a Tint2 panel and it looked pretty sweet.
2012-09-13T03:32:00.000Z	Troy^	TeamRocket1233c	which panel hmm
2012-09-13T03:32:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	Xfce4 + Tint2 panel.
2012-09-13T03:33:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	Really though, nothing beats an invisible panel as far as sleek goes.
2012-09-13T03:34:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	Invisible or transparent or translucent panel, and hey, if Tint2 works great combined with Openbox, it would work great combined with Xfce4, GNOME Shell, or MATE too.
2012-09-13T03:36:00.000Z	Troy^	TeamRocket1233c	i would have to see a screenshot i gues
2012-09-13T03:39:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	GNOME Shell + Tint2. http://www.micahcarrick.com/images/migrating-to-gnome-3/tint2-panel-large.png
2012-09-13T03:43:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	Nope, but it's an example of how GNOME Shell would look with Tint2.
2012-09-13T03:44:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	I don't have a PC with anywhere near enough horsepower for GNOME Shell.
2012-09-13T03:45:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	Crunchbang Statler with the stock Openbox config on a PII with 128 megs of RAM.
2012-09-13T03:45:00.000Z	Troy^	TeamRocket1233c	omg why?
2012-09-13T03:46:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	Can't handle anything heavier.
2012-09-13T03:46:00.000Z	Troy^	TeamRocket1233c	man i could give you a P3 with 512mb of ram..  no i mean't why so old.. even my server has more horsepower my ubuntu server is a p4 2.6gb with 2gb of ram
2012-09-13T03:47:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	I'm just stuck with a PC that old.
2012-09-13T03:47:00.000Z	Troy^	TeamRocket1233c	kijiji or ebay could find you way more for like 50-100 bucks :P
2012-09-13T03:48:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	I could probably buy a PIII~500 and swap out the PII with that temporarily, and then add about a CD's worth of RAM to it to hold up until I can at least get a Core 2 Duo with 2 gigs of RAM.
2012-09-13T03:49:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	PIII~800 and PIII~1GHz are available in Slot 1, right?
2012-09-13T03:50:00.000Z	Troy^	TeamRocket1233c	no idea lol, been so long since ive used it, it does work though
2012-09-13T03:54:00.000Z	TeamRocket1233c	Troy^	I'm a little curious as to how GNOME 3 would operate with Tint2 panel and Docky dock.
2012-09-13T03:55:00.000Z	Troy^	TeamRocket1233c	yea gnome 3 is alright I had problems with it when i tried using it when it first came out had bugs with ati driver. So have become a big xfce fan even though i could run whatever i wanted
