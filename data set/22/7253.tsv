2007-01-23T14:25:00.000Z	IceTox		How do I recompile my kernel?
2007-01-23T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	why do you need to
2007-01-23T14:26:00.000Z	IceTox	ikonia	because my amsn is going slow and it doesn't seem like it's an amsn problem..
2007-01-23T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	what makes you think its a kernel
2007-01-23T14:26:00.000Z	IceTox	ikonia	cause I cannot find anything else wrong...
2007-01-23T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	sorry to be blunt but thats plain stupid !
2007-01-23T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	that fact that you can't debug it means you should %150 not be looking at a kernel change
2007-01-23T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	define slow - slow to respond, slow to send messages, slow to resize
2007-01-23T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	you don't even know the name "amsn thingy"
2007-01-23T14:29:00.000Z	IceTox	ikonia	slow like in responsing.
2007-01-23T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	so if you click on a users name - it takes ages to pop up - that sort of slow yes/no
2007-01-23T14:30:00.000Z	IceTox	ikonia	yes
2007-01-23T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	when you move it around the screen fast - does that move at the correct speed
2007-01-23T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	ok - so the problem is either around the amsn application or a plugin-type interface
2007-01-23T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	well your options are limited
2007-01-23T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	are you using any plugins or interfaces with amsn or just amsn
2007-01-23T14:33:00.000Z	IceTox	ikonia	I did disable the amsn plus plugin, but hang on.. I'll disable all of the plugins and try again..
2007-01-23T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	close amsn afer disabling it - and restart
2007-01-23T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	 ok - so you need to log a bug against amsn in launchpad and give as much detail as possible
2007-01-23T14:41:00.000Z	IceTox	ikonia	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2664/
2007-01-23T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	thats the msn encyption - its not using the version it wants
2007-01-23T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	IceTox	not download it - install it from the ubuntu repo's if its available
