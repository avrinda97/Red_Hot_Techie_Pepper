2006-07-18T05:45:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	they both have equal root privalages
2006-07-18T05:46:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	so no
2006-07-18T05:49:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	cd Desktop && chown root:root x && chmod 700 x
2006-07-18T05:50:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	1m i will try
2006-07-18T05:50:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	make that: && sudo chmod 700 x
2006-07-18T05:53:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	i tried but it is opening for admin also
2006-07-18T05:53:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	what do mean 'admin'?
2006-07-18T05:54:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	if we type sudo su;then we will enter into admins account not root 's account;to enter into root's account we have to type su
2006-07-18T05:55:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	but why are typing sudo su? Is there a reason
2006-07-18T05:56:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	what u type to enter into admin account??The passwords for sudo su And au are different But it is not set initially
2006-07-18T05:57:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	sudo will let you make system wide changes in the root account.
2006-07-18T06:02:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	ya
2006-07-18T06:03:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	"cd Desktop && sudo chown root:root x && chmod 700 x" where x is the folder. Still don't fully understand what you want to do after that?
2006-07-18T06:04:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	but it is openning for admin user
2006-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	what do you mean by admin user
2006-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	if u type sudo su then ........
2006-07-18T06:06:00.000Z	sri_	HBuzacott	i think root user is power ful
2006-07-18T06:06:00.000Z	HBuzacott	sri_	that is the same as typeing sudo -i *
