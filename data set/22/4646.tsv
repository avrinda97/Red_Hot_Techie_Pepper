2007-11-19T14:58:00.000Z	BenWartig		hi, I have a little problem, I m trying to get our server fixed (Sun X4100 M2) there is a bug with the raid drivers #37452 but now i´m stuck. Could someone help me out?
2007-11-19T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	post a link to the bug ?
2007-11-19T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	ubuntu 6.10 ?
2007-11-19T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	my typo sorry
2007-11-19T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	the problem and solution are spelt out in the link,
2007-11-19T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	what have you done to get the modules working ?
2007-11-19T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	are you trying to put the 2.6.16 modules into the 2.6.15 kernel , or do a 2.6.16 kernel build
2007-11-19T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	I'm not sure how that would work, I'd use the 2.6.16 kernel
2007-11-19T15:15:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	: at the moment the server runs with the workaround (raid works with 2.6.17 kernel) but wed like to run the 2.6.15 with raid drivers (is it possible to do this?)
2007-11-19T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	not sure how mixing modules and kernel version will work in ubuntu
2007-11-19T15:17:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	ok thanks for your help so far
2007-11-19T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	maybe better to match modules to kernel version
2007-11-19T15:24:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	is there no way to tell the 2.6.15 kernel to load the 2 modules that i need?
2007-11-19T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	there is, just insmod them, however I doubt that will work due to version mixing
2007-11-19T15:26:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	i´ll try it keep fingers crossed thanks a lot ;)
2007-11-19T15:34:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	there is  another problem insmod is to bind in modules in running kernels but if i want to run the kernel it crashes and drops to a rescue-shell
2007-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	there is  another problem insmod is to bind in modules in running kernels but if i want to run the kernel it crashes and drops to a rescue-shell
2007-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	I suspect its down to the incompatability
2007-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	and adding the modules to the initrd could this work?
2007-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	yes, but I suspect you'll have the same issues as your running kernel is different
2007-11-19T15:49:00.000Z	BenWartig	ikonia	how can i add them to the initrd?
2007-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	BenWartig	you have to repackage your initrd file, this is normally done at kernel build time, however the kernel build guide should walk you though that
