2006-05-11T12:07:00.000Z	bigfoot1		i need to submit a digital jpeg. the only requirement is that it be at least 300 dpi. how can i check a jpeg's dpi information?
2006-05-11T12:07:00.000Z	holycow	bigfoot1	gimp or gthumb
2006-05-11T12:08:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	i'm in gimp
2006-05-11T12:09:00.000Z	holycow	bigfoot1	image / scale image
2006-05-11T12:10:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	i'm in scale image. where's the info? Also i checked gthumb, there's a bunch of data , but i don't see the word DPI anywhere.
2006-05-11T12:10:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	i'm looking for the word "dpi" in gimp and gthumb, i don't see it.
2006-05-11T12:11:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	easy.
2006-05-11T12:12:00.000Z	holycow	bigfoot1	appologies
2006-05-11T12:12:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	not at all
2006-05-11T12:12:00.000Z	holycow	bigfoot1	heres a guess
2006-05-11T12:13:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	are you joking about this being a "guess"?
2006-05-11T12:14:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	i changed it to 300 x, 300 y, but the image looks the same
2006-05-11T12:14:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	thank you for bearing with me
2006-05-11T12:15:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	?
2006-05-11T12:15:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	ok.
2006-05-11T12:16:00.000Z	holycow	bigfoot1	not without having a clue, there is too much to teach you for you to see the difference.  printing is the easiest way to visualize whats going on
2006-05-11T12:16:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	i'm just a bit confused, i thought you couldn't get an image crisper (add detail), though you could make it duller (lose detail).
2006-05-11T12:17:00.000Z	holycow	bigfoot1	yes, but when you changed the dpi it actually made the image smaller proportionally
2006-05-11T12:18:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	good news, i'm getting a clue, thanks to your education!
2006-05-11T12:21:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	i changed to 300dpi in gimp, but the image size is the same
2006-05-11T12:22:00.000Z	holycow	bigfoot1	please stop asking me, i don't have patience for teaching basics that one can solve just by reading the single dialog box i READ OUT TO YOU ALREADY
2006-05-11T12:32:00.000Z	bigfoot1	holycow	8-)
