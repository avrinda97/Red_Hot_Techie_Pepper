2009-04-10T15:15:00.000Z	Chowder		So compiz won't work with my computer now because my gfx card reached a "blacklist". However, its ok. I want to install e17. What I had in mind was using Gnome with e17 and using thunar instead of nautilus by default. Is this possible?
2009-04-10T15:17:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	yep
2009-04-10T15:17:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	but what do you mean e17 with gnome? As in pick n' mix?
2009-04-10T15:18:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	I guess you could call it that
2009-04-10T15:18:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	well sure, that would be possible.
2009-04-10T15:18:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	either that or just get rid of all things gnome and use e17 exclusively
2009-04-10T15:18:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	that being easier :)
2009-04-10T15:19:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	now that I think about it, I would like to just get rid of gnome all together
2009-04-10T15:20:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	heh, one sec
2009-04-10T15:20:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	ok
2009-04-10T15:20:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	I presume the gnome apps as well?
2009-04-10T15:21:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	I won't need them I guess
2009-04-10T15:21:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	all I'll need is gtk to use apps like pidgin and brasero
2009-04-10T15:23:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	probably the only gnome app I'd keep is gnome-terminal
2009-04-10T15:23:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop gnome-desktop-data libgtk2.0-0 && sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get install pidgin brasero gnome-terminal<enlightment stuffs and others>
2009-04-10T15:24:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	gotcha. I think I'm just gonna install the latest e17 from source
2009-04-10T15:25:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	gutsy
2009-04-10T15:25:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	indeed.
2009-04-10T15:32:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	hah, found an easy script online to install from SVN
2009-04-10T15:32:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	doubly gutsy
2009-04-10T15:32:00.000Z	Chowder	ziroday	nah, it was written by an e17 dev
2009-04-10T15:33:00.000Z	ziroday	Chowder	my stance still holds :)
