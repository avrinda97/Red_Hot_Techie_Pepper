2010-01-10T12:06:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	save yourself misery and install nginx + rails or nginx + pylons.
2010-01-10T12:06:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	english please ... :)
2010-01-10T12:07:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	don't install LAMP, unless you want a miserable life.
2010-01-10T12:07:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	apache and php = misery
2010-01-10T12:08:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	look at nginx for a reverse proxy to either rails (mongrel_cluster) or pylons (paster cluster)
2010-01-10T12:08:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	use a decent language, php is terrible.
2010-01-10T12:11:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	so for what I am doing it should not matter right? ... running a CRM app that is ...
2010-01-10T12:12:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	if you're running some php app, using apache. If you're programming listen to me, if not follow aliendude5300
2010-01-10T12:12:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	I was under the impression you were writing this yourself.
2010-01-10T12:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	hehe ... no programming going on here .. :) just trying to switch my business tools to open source ...
2010-01-10T12:13:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	what applications are you trying to use? I might have better, non-php suggestions.
2010-01-10T12:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	well .. vtiger for CRM
2010-01-10T12:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	and GnuCash for Accounting
2010-01-10T12:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	GnuCash seems to work fine ...
2010-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	I'd be looking at http://www.fatfreecrm.com/, personally for your crm... but that's me. I really like clean interfaces.
2010-01-10T12:37:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	you need to install php to use it
2010-01-10T12:37:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	say yes.
2010-01-10T12:38:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	I thought PHP came through LAMP
2010-01-10T12:38:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	I figured apt would've set it up properly for you. didn't know vtiger had a seperate fakeroot install
2010-01-10T12:43:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	I like the look of that CRM software you linked to ... very slick
2010-01-10T12:55:00.000Z	zetheroo	jtoft	what does FatFreeCRM need to run?
2010-01-10T12:56:00.000Z	jtoft	zetheroo	Eh. if you're using other things that are php based just stick with vtiger. fatfreecrm is a rails app, so... personally I'd use mongrel_cluster and nginx and upstream 3-4 nodes through it.
