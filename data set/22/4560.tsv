2007-12-08T22:06:00.000Z	StevieBur		may I ask a question?
2007-12-08T22:06:00.000Z	StevieBur		I have Gutsy
2007-12-08T22:06:00.000Z	StevieBur		but I don't have internet at the house
2007-12-08T22:07:00.000Z	StevieBur		where could I go (from a cybercafe) and get audio, video, and such?
2007-12-08T22:07:00.000Z	StevieBur		in a sense
2007-12-08T22:07:00.000Z	StevieBur		I don't want to download a thing, need to go back to get its dependency, etc
2007-12-08T22:07:00.000Z	StevieBur		take a week to get it to work
2007-12-08T22:09:00.000Z	StevieBur		I am not sure how to get the codecs for listening to music (mp3 especially), watching video in various formats, etc
2007-12-08T22:11:00.000Z	StevieBur		the only option I have is to spend 20 euros to have someone do it for me (hoping that they do it right) and worrying about what I have on a partition.  I'd like to resize the partition but am afraid of losing data
2007-12-08T22:12:00.000Z	StevieBur		Yes, I have Ubuntu 7.10 that I installed from a CD that someone gave me
2007-12-08T22:12:00.000Z	bazhang	StevieBur	will it ever be connected to the internet?
2007-12-08T22:17:00.000Z	bazhang	StevieBur	question: will this machine ever connect to the internet?
2007-12-08T22:18:00.000Z	StevieBur	bazhang	it might one day be connected to the Internet, but not before 6 months at least
2007-12-08T22:19:00.000Z	bazhang	StevieBur	you might want to get something that has it all for now--ubuntu-based but no download needed
