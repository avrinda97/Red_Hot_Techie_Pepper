2008-08-31T17:04:00.000Z	nnull		anyone know any good tutorials on process/service auditing?
2008-08-31T17:05:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	what you mean by auditing?
2008-08-31T17:09:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	I think youre referring to the system monitor applet for gnome panel
2008-08-31T17:10:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	mine is a pretty intense setup and uses between .5 and 1% at all times of my processor (phenom 9600)
2008-08-31T17:12:00.000Z	nnull	blitz	in that screen shot ure mem usage is at 98%?
2008-08-31T17:13:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	yeah its supposed to be.. right now its 30% inuse by programs and 70% cache
2008-08-31T17:14:00.000Z	nnull	blitz	? running VMware i assume?
2008-08-31T17:15:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	thats the way memory works in linux, is to fill rememning ram with cache and buffers instead of swap .. its hotter but faster and more efficient
2008-08-31T17:16:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	4g physical
2008-08-31T17:17:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	its not actually "in use" it is cache to spped up program launch and interaction
2008-08-31T17:17:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	you probobly dont have things like "preload" installed
2008-08-31T17:18:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=175419 here is an article I found which explains
2008-08-31T17:19:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	linux doesn't use ram the same as windows
2008-08-31T17:20:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	I believe trackerd works like preload
2008-08-31T17:20:00.000Z	nnull	blitz	ok
2008-08-31T17:21:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	I would get rid of it tho, a quick internet search says as much,
2008-08-31T17:22:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	from what I read theres a lot of problems with it running away or working incorrectly in a manner that slows you down
2008-08-31T17:23:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	what preloading does for the system is uses any available memory to keep programs so it doesnt need to read from the hard drive to reopen them.. like my web browser and such
2008-08-31T17:23:00.000Z	nnull	blitz	would my 2 gig of DDR running compiz allow for this preloading you speak of?
2008-08-31T17:24:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	it couldnt really hurt, just do an apt-get install preload and try it for a while
2008-08-31T17:24:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	if you dont like it, drop it :)
2008-08-31T17:25:00.000Z	blitz	nnull	its not the same as ram that is "in use"
