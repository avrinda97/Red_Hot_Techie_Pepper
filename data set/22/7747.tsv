2006-01-05T15:33:00.000Z	diemex		i tinik i'm in gnome
2006-01-05T15:33:00.000Z	diemex		i don't really know what gnome means
2006-01-05T15:34:00.000Z	petz	diemex	you can eject cd by entering eject hdc or whatever it is
2006-01-05T15:37:00.000Z	petz	diemex	that happens to me sorry I dont know why
2006-01-05T15:39:00.000Z	petz	diemex	that does not compute :-)
2006-01-05T15:43:00.000Z	diemex	petz	: do you have skype?
2006-01-05T15:45:00.000Z	petz	diemex	it's not kinda working
2006-01-05T15:45:00.000Z	diemex	petz	: why not?
2006-01-05T15:46:00.000Z	petz	diemex	dunno. I'll give it a try, just a sec. but I probably can't help ya anyway?
2006-01-05T15:47:00.000Z	petz	diemex	synaptics running. could take a while, like  a quarter hour
2006-01-05T15:48:00.000Z	diemex	petz	4 what?
2006-01-05T15:49:00.000Z	petz	diemex	for what what? is synaptic running? or until its finished?
2006-01-05T15:49:00.000Z	diemex	petz	: what is synaptic ?
2006-01-05T15:50:00.000Z	petz	diemex	ah the synaptic package manager. what desktop environment r u using?
2006-01-05T15:50:00.000Z	petz	diemex	well basically its a gui for installing programs
2006-01-05T15:51:00.000Z	diemex	petz	: ok , that's over me , i'm just at the beginnings of using ubuntu , i don't  have a quest about useing ubuntu ;)
2006-01-05T15:52:00.000Z	petz	diemex	then what? are you using kde or gnome?
2006-01-05T15:54:00.000Z	petz	diemex	well it's the same anyway. if you press alt+f1 you should be able to find the synaptic somewhere
2006-01-05T15:58:00.000Z	petz	diemex	but i recommend you try kde and xcfe just so that you know what you're missing and to know the alternatives. i didnt like gnome
2006-01-05T16:04:00.000Z	diemex	petz	:  how could i use kde if i only have gnome on ubuntu?
