2008-08-18T03:48:00.000Z	UncontrolleD		Hi all, i'm trying to install Ubuntu latest version but i don't know what mount point i should use, any ideas?
2008-08-18T03:50:00.000Z	UncontrolleD		thanks alot for the help, i should leave ext3 as default?
2008-08-18T03:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	yes...
2008-08-18T03:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	did you create a swap space, and how much space did you give to /  ?
2008-08-18T03:52:00.000Z	UncontrolleD	IndyGunFreak	the root has 120 gb space, i haven't created a swap partition
2008-08-18T03:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	/root has 120gigs, or / has 120gigs(ther'es a difference)
2008-08-18T03:53:00.000Z	UncontrolleD	IndyGunFreak	"/" has 120 gigs
2008-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	ok.. so i would take that 120, and knock about 4gigs of that, and allocate it as swap...
2008-08-18T03:58:00.000Z	UncontrolleD	IndyGunFreak	how do i allocate a 4 gb swap partition on a already ext3 partition?
2008-08-18T03:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	eh, its probably not that big a deal.....
2008-08-18T04:00:00.000Z	UncontrolleD	IndyGunFreak	 oh ok, what i do with the other 120 gb partition? do i format it as ntfs?
2008-08-18T04:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	i'm confused.. you have two, 120gig partitions right now, right?
2008-08-18T04:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	are you on a live CD now?
2008-08-18T04:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	does it dualboot?
2008-08-18T04:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	if you're not dual booting, i would just start the installer, and when it comes time to partition the drive, just tell itt o "take over" the entire drive.. and the installer will set up a swap and ext3 partition for you no prob
2008-08-18T04:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	like i said, thats if you're not dual booting.. just let the installer to format and setup the entire drive.
2008-08-18T04:04:00.000Z	UncontrolleD	IndyGunFreak	I actually tried that but i get a error saying "Too Small Size"
2008-08-18T04:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	huh?
2008-08-18T04:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	UncontrolleD	it said 240gigs was to small?
2008-08-18T04:05:00.000Z	UncontrolleD	IndyGunFreak	the first option says /dev/sdb1 43% (47.5 GB then the Ubuntu.8.4.1 says 57% 64.2
