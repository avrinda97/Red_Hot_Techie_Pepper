2007-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	irotas		stupid question .. i'm a little confused about how ubuntu does package updates .. when I check the 'Update Manager', it only ever lists security updates .. in 4 months I've never seen a regular application upgrade .. is that because of a setting I have somewhere? can I change something so that I can install regular application upgrades that aren't related to security problems?
2007-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	or sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-09-26T07:16:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	thanks
2007-09-26T07:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	your welcome . was afk
2007-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	4 months huh . should get a decent upgrade hehe
2007-09-26T07:21:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	i did 'sudo apt-get -s upgrade scite' and got nothing .. i'm assuming there's a new package out there (i'm 3 versions behind), but I don't really know how to check to make sure
2007-09-26T07:21:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	i also did 'sudo apt-get update'
2007-09-26T07:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	apt-cache policy package will give you installed version and installable version
2007-09-26T07:23:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	nothing out there  .. that's weird!
2007-09-26T07:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	package is scite?
2007-09-26T07:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	in Gutsy the version is 1.71-1
2007-09-26T07:25:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	so either ubuntu packages get updated VERY slowly or I'm still doing something wrong
2007-09-26T07:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	do sudo apt-get upgrade and see what it gives you. let me know also
2007-09-26T07:26:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	the only thing it thinks it can upgrade is 'elinks-lite'
2007-09-26T07:26:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	and i think that's a security update
2007-09-26T07:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	then that is all that has been upgraded
2007-09-26T07:27:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	in 4 months? argh
2007-09-26T07:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	possibly.
2007-09-26T07:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	irotas	have you tried sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
2007-09-26T07:31:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	sorry, still not working, but i've got to run ..wifey is yelling at me to clean
2007-09-26T07:31:00.000Z	irotas	IdleOne	thanks, though ;p
