2009-05-31T18:02:00.000Z	JoeySpaz		hi all
2009-05-31T18:02:00.000Z	JoeySpaz		why is my sound so out of sync?
2009-05-31T18:02:00.000Z	JoeySpaz		in my linux games and also in Flash
2009-05-31T18:02:00.000Z	JoeySpaz		especially flash games on the internet the sound is half a second out of sync
2009-05-31T18:03:00.000Z	JoeySpaz		it is VERY distracting and has been happening ever since i installed jaunty from hardy
2009-05-31T18:03:00.000Z	JoeySpaz		How do i change the sound buffer length
2009-05-31T18:03:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	try using ALSA
2009-05-31T18:03:00.000Z	JoeySpaz	Kalmi_	i am
2009-05-31T19:22:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	what drivers?
2009-05-31T19:23:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	did it work before?
2009-05-31T19:24:00.000Z	JoeySpaz	Kalmi_	yes it did, you recommended me to isntall new drivers when i told you my soundwas out of sync, and after navingating through realtek's web of shit and 404 errors, i finally managed to come across something, then when i followed the instructiopns, i got4753465984327568392459 permission denied errors, and when I used sudo, I got just as many no such file or directory errors - it uninstalled my old drivers and then fucked up
2009-05-31T19:26:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	it did NOT tell you to install any driver... that was someone else :)
2009-05-31T19:26:00.000Z	JoeySpaz	Kalmi_	ok, how do I get my old drivers back?
2009-05-31T19:27:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	*I* did NOT tell you to install any driver... that was someone else :)
2009-05-31T19:27:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	dunno... you have at lsmod and see what is loaded now and blacklist it...
2009-05-31T19:27:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	dunno... you could have a look at the output of lsmod and see what is loaded now for the sound card and blacklist it...
2009-05-31T19:29:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	sorry... I seem to miss a few words everytime... and I only realize my mistakes after hitting Enter...
2009-05-31T19:30:00.000Z	JoeySpaz	Kalmi_	I got this... http://paste.ubuntu.com/184997/
2009-05-31T19:32:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	you could compare it to what you get from running the same command on livecd... and then blacklist everything that is present only in this one...
2009-05-31T19:33:00.000Z	JoeySpaz	Kalmi_	how do you blacklist stuff?
2009-05-31T19:34:00.000Z	JoeySpaz	Kalmi_	ok.. i'll try that
2009-05-31T19:34:00.000Z	Kalmi_	JoeySpaz	have a look at /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf , it is self-explanatory...
