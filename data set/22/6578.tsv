2009-05-12T00:37:00.000Z	billybigrigger_		Piet::: you alive?
2009-05-12T00:38:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	hope so
2009-05-12T00:41:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	alright. did it help?
2009-05-12T00:43:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	md0 should be in fstab as soon as you finished installing
2009-05-12T00:43:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	if it's not there, something went wrong or you put another layer btween the raid and the file system
2009-05-12T00:45:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	you should not need to edit fstab.
2009-05-12T00:53:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	did i miss something you said?
2009-05-12T00:54:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	that goes to you, too
2009-05-12T00:55:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	ah, that's a possible scenario. in that case, you can just put a line for md0 there, right
2009-05-12T00:56:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	something alson the lines of: /dev/mo0           /where/to/mount/it            ext3        defaults        0       2
2009-05-12T00:57:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	this assumes you created an ext3 file system on it
2009-05-12T02:13:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	alive and kicking, not still
2009-05-12T02:16:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	scrolled off already, but i can get you a new one
2009-05-12T02:16:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	that'S what i gave you, but you may want to change that depending on how you use it
2009-05-12T02:17:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	those are best described in man 5 fstab
2009-05-12T02:18:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	ok then you can keep it as it is
2009-05-12T02:19:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	yes, the order in which it is checked (or not) by fsck, more precisely
2009-05-12T02:21:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	1 is single user level, 2 is multi user level, 0 is do not check at all on boot (and thus never unless explicitly requested)
2009-05-12T02:22:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	mkfs.XXX /dev/md0
2009-05-12T02:22:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	...where XXX is the file system type
2009-05-12T02:22:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	you want to create a file system, not a partition
2009-05-12T02:25:00.000Z	Piet	billybigrigger_	i would not know, but it surprises me, too
