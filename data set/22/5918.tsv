2007-01-25T11:00:00.000Z	tom47	mwalsh	until you resolve 1 the others are not worth pursuing
2007-01-25T11:02:00.000Z	tom47	mwalsh	is it ony external hard drives that are intermittently recognised?
2007-01-25T11:03:00.000Z	tom47	mwalsh	are the internal hard drives reliably recognised?
2007-01-25T11:03:00.000Z	mwalsh	tom47	reliably? in wat way
2007-01-25T11:04:00.000Z	mwalsh	tom47	they are also intermittently recognized

2007-01-25T11:06:00.000Z	mwalsh	tom47	i think youre my lone refuge..
2007-01-25T11:08:00.000Z	tom47	mwalsh	i am thinking about it
2007-01-25T11:08:00.000Z	tom47	mwalsh	but the intermittent bit i am afraid suggests to me a hardware issue
