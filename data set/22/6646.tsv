2006-09-08T15:43:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /some/mount/point
2006-09-08T15:43:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	assuming hda1 has an ext3 file system on it.
2006-09-08T15:43:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	the mount point can be any empty directory
2006-09-08T15:44:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	ok, I guess ... :)
2006-09-08T15:54:00.000Z	whazilla	sethk	some error on mount ... unable to read superblock
2006-09-08T15:54:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	that sounds like it isn't the correct file system type.  you are using -t ext3?  are you sure it is ext3?
2006-09-08T15:55:00.000Z	whazilla	sethk	it's a loopback
2006-09-08T15:57:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	it's not unsupported, that's irrelevant
2006-09-08T15:58:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	don't go off on a tangent.  Did you answer my question about ext3?
2006-09-08T15:58:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	a loopback mount is used with a file, not a partition
2006-09-08T15:58:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	wait.  it is either hda1, or a loopback.  not both.
2006-09-08T15:59:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	so it isn't hda1?  why did you say it is hda1?
2006-09-08T15:59:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	if it is a loopback, it isn't an hd at all
2006-09-08T15:59:00.000Z	sethk	whazilla	you have to figure out whether you have a disk or not
