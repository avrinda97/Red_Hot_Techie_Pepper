2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		I'm quite sure it is. That's why my question concerned Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Which secretly addressed a Mint issue ;-)
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Yes, it is.
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		Ubuntu DOES install language packs without permission
2011-12-01T05:13:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		which is carried over to mint
2011-12-01T05:15:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		To quote myself: (6:06:18 PM) Foxhoundz: Is there any reason why Ubuntu (and its derivatives) download/install language packs for no reason
2011-12-01T05:15:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		My question stated Ubuntu as the issue
2011-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		For the 4th time (+) , my question concerned Ubiquity + Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		I only mentioned Mint because it was based on Ubuntu
2011-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	Foxhoundz		let's not get carried away people
2011-12-01T05:17:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	either way, I don't think you'd be able to get an answer as to why Ubuntu installs language packs for no reason.  Typically devs who make such decisions aren't in this channel...
2011-12-01T05:17:00.000Z	Foxhoundz	mbeierl	Thank you for your answer
2011-12-01T05:18:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	for what it was worth, you are welcome ;)
2011-12-01T05:18:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	that would actually be a bug report, or a suggestion in ... what's it called... brainstorm?
2011-12-01T05:22:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	indeed... I did a quick review of my installed languages and there are very few.  Perhaps you could simple deselect those that you don't want.  Or is this during the install process that it is doing a download that you do not want
2011-12-01T05:22:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	if so, something like an alternate install cd might be a better way to go.  I did not have this issue when installing Natty, at least.
2011-12-01T05:23:00.000Z	Foxhoundz	mbeierl	This occurs when you're first installing Ubuntu with a network connection
2011-12-01T05:23:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	I should clarify my earlier statement: I see literally tens of languages, but about 4 that are actually installed.
2011-12-01T05:24:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	I used a live usb for the install and was network connected and do not recall this happening to me.  I too have limited bandwidth (not a bw cap, but just really slow)
2011-12-01T05:24:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	11.11 or what version?
2011-12-01T05:25:00.000Z	Foxhoundz	mbeierl	11.10
2011-12-01T05:26:00.000Z	mbeierl	Foxhoundz	that's what i meant ;)  Just fat fingers.  Ok, so I have not tried that one, and if that's the case, then it is a bug worthy of launchpad indeed.
