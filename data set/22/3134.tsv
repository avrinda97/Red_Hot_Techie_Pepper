2009-09-16T18:28:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	is there something up with jaunty these days?
2009-09-16T18:28:00.000Z	basajaun		had that problem a while back
2009-09-16T18:28:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	how'd you solve it?
2009-09-16T18:30:00.000Z	basajaun		welcome jpatota
2009-09-16T18:30:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	hate to be annoying but i'd really like to know how you solved the problem
2009-09-16T18:32:00.000Z	basajaun	temporarytao	 I think one of the kernel updates solved it but I had somewhat improved my lot through installing  storage device manager
2009-09-16T18:34:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	i'm on 2.6.28-15 now. what's your kernel?
2009-09-16T18:34:00.000Z	basajaun		why are the ldxe reos for jaunty not updated?
2009-09-16T18:37:00.000Z	basajaun		-14 temporarytao
2009-09-16T18:40:00.000Z	basajaun	temporarytao	 go into add remove and Install Storage Device MAnager
2009-09-16T18:40:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	ok. will try
2009-09-16T18:42:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	PySDM is what you mean? also, why should a storage manager affect a USB mouse?
2009-09-16T18:44:00.000Z	basajaun		oops temporarytao  mistake I apologize hastily read usb
2009-09-16T18:46:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	so you did not have a "suddenly-disconnecting-USB-mouse" problem then?
2009-09-16T18:47:00.000Z	basajaun		no temporarytao
2009-09-16T18:48:00.000Z	basajaun	temporarytao	 can you reproduce it with any usb mouse? or just one?
2009-09-16T18:48:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	just the one.
2009-09-16T18:48:00.000Z	temporarytao		really weird problem
2009-09-16T18:48:00.000Z	temporarytao		i'm now worried that the usb ports are not providing enough power
2009-09-16T18:50:00.000Z	temporarytao	basajaun	i'm giving this up for now
