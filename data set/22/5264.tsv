2011-01-31T10:28:00.000Z	lewix	bastidrazor	thanks i just got it now. i was reading the file permissions on linux
2011-01-31T10:29:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lewix	i'm not sure what you mean by that but you're welcome.
2011-01-31T10:32:00.000Z	lewix	bastidrazor	thank you. can you enlighten me with the group administrator thingie because I dont get it
2011-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	lewix	bastidrazor	on a file persimission i understand that there is the owner of the file, the group and the other. and everybody but what exactly is the group
2011-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	lewix	bastidrazor	and hows others different from all
2011-01-31T10:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lewix	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions will explain better than i.
2011-01-31T10:37:00.000Z	lewix	bastidrazor	its what i read it doesnt explain the difference
2011-01-31T10:40:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lewix	all does not exist as a permission. permissions are 1 of 3 things: owner group or other. other  means anyone who is not an owner or in the group.
2011-01-31T10:43:00.000Z	lewix	bastidrazor	how can a file belong to a user group
2011-01-31T10:44:00.000Z	lewix	bastidrazor	i understand that a file belongs to a user, but how can it belong to a group
2011-01-31T10:44:00.000Z	bastidrazor	lewix	reading that page will explain permissions.
