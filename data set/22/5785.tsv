2008-01-13T09:33:00.000Z	sayers		How would I install apache2 again and have it install all the files nec. for /etc/apache2?
2008-01-13T09:35:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	that was a big mistake, more than apache puts files there ....
2008-01-13T09:36:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	Yes I see it was a mistake
2008-01-13T09:36:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	to start, do   dpkg -l '*apache*' | grep ^ii , that will find all the apache packages you have installed. Then do    sudo aptitude purge <those apache packages>
2008-01-13T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	the way apt/dpkg works is, if it sees you manually removed files from etc it assumes you did it for a reason and won't put them back
2008-01-13T09:37:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	and how would I have it put them back
2008-01-13T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	do those first two commands I gave you, then you would reinstall apache again. By purging you tell apt to remove the /etc files itself, so on the next install it will put them back
2008-01-13T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	you probably will have errors with the purge, put them on the pastebin.  I have 20 minutes
2008-01-13T09:40:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	no error
2008-01-13T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	good. what packages did you remove?
2008-01-13T09:41:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	purge libapache2-mod-php5 apache2.2-common apache2-utils apache2-mpm-prefork
2008-01-13T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	outstanding. Did you install php?
2008-01-13T09:42:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	I installed LAMP when installing ubuntu-server so more than likely
2008-01-13T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	you did, a sec
2008-01-13T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	purge libapache2-mod-php5 . It may say it wants to remove some other packages, let it do it but make a note of them
2008-01-13T09:44:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	nope that isn't even an installed package
2008-01-13T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	then you installed php differently I guess. time to install apache2  sudo aptitude install apache2
2008-01-13T09:46:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	that /appears/ to have worked :)
2008-01-13T09:46:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	/appears/ is a good qualifier till you check
2008-01-13T09:46:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	how would i have two sites on this one server?
2008-01-13T09:47:00.000Z	nickrud	sayers	don't ask me, I helped with a packaging question, not an apache question. I can barely get modrewrite working without hand holding
2008-01-13T09:47:00.000Z	sayers	nickrud	:) okay well thanks then
