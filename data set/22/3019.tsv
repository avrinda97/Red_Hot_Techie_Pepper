2009-08-05T21:31:00.000Z	deany	nko	it mounts when you put a disc in
2009-08-05T21:31:00.000Z	deany	nko	least, mine does.
2009-08-05T21:34:00.000Z	nko	deany	k3b does not see it!
2009-08-05T21:34:00.000Z	deany	nko	is the icon on your desktop tho
2009-08-05T21:35:00.000Z	deany	nko	k3b
2009-08-05T21:35:00.000Z	deany	nko	detects it on mine.
2009-08-05T21:35:00.000Z	deany	nko	try adding it manually in k3b prefs
2009-08-05T21:36:00.000Z	deany	nko	try *shudder*  Brasero
2009-08-05T21:36:00.000Z	deany	nko	or are you in KDE
2009-08-05T21:37:00.000Z	deany	nko	let me just plug mine in and have a look.. (usb  powered liteon :) )
2009-08-05T21:38:00.000Z	deany	nko	what do you get with lsusb ?
2009-08-05T21:38:00.000Z	nko	deany	k3b see it only when i put in an audio CD, when i put a blank-dvd, k3b cancel it from list device
2009-08-05T21:39:00.000Z	deany	nko	I have to ask (sorry)   does it support the media you are inserting?
2009-08-05T21:39:00.000Z	deany	nko	like, does it support the + or - or both etc... what make is the writer btw ?
2009-08-05T21:41:00.000Z	deany	nko	odd.... I cant suggest anything other than use something else.. I swear by k3b tho... brasero has done nothing for me with the 5 writers ive tried
2009-08-05T21:41:00.000Z	nko	deany	i know that the system mount the dvd on /dev/sr1
2009-08-05T21:41:00.000Z	deany	nko	try from shell.
2009-08-05T21:42:00.000Z	deany	nko	growisofs  to burn iso or mkisofs to burn files
2009-08-05T21:42:00.000Z	deany	nko	since you know the /dev location
2009-08-05T21:43:00.000Z	deany	nko	seems growisofs does files too :)  oops    man growisofs
2009-08-05T21:43:00.000Z	deany	nko	 or, (not tried it myself)  try gnomebaker
