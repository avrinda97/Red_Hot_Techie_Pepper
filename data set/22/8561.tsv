2005-07-23T05:09:00.000Z	feugan3333		Hi all. Does anyone know where I can get the man pages for socket programming. eg "man bind","man listen"
2005-07-23T05:10:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	manpages-dev
2005-07-23T05:10:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	I told the info pages are better for beginners and people who need more extensive docs than just a list of function calls and params.
2005-07-23T05:11:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	Thanks. Where would I find the info pages?
2005-07-23T05:13:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	There are various prism54 chips and not all are supported the same way.
2005-12-16T10:32:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2005-12-16T10:33:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	thanks a lot :-)
2005-12-16T10:34:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	Why does gcc-3.4 not have a dependency on build-essential?
2005-12-16T10:34:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	Coz userspace isn't built with gcc 3.4
2005-12-16T10:35:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	it's assumed that people who want to build a kernel can read docs ;-)
2005-12-16T10:36:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	Userspace binaries build with gcc-4.0?
2005-12-16T10:36:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	Indeed.
2005-12-16T11:01:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	Any idea why I can't update cc using update-alternatives?
2006-04-24T14:09:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	Installing unpackaged python stuff isn't  agreat idea.
2006-04-24T14:11:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	Why not
2006-04-24T14:11:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	What happens when an upgraded package tries to write a file that suddenly already exists?
2006-04-24T14:13:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	Unfortunetly, I'm not left with much choice, since the current version of the module that I want to use is somewhat broken.
2006-04-24T14:14:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	Which python are you using? 2.3? There may be a python-2.4 package.
2006-04-24T14:15:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	No I'm using python 2.4
2006-04-24T14:15:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	ah ok
2006-04-24T14:18:00.000Z	feugan3333	cafuego	Well I found a workaround :-) Just copy the new package files into the same directory as your script and it will use that package instead of the system package. Anyways thanks for your help.
2006-04-24T14:18:00.000Z	cafuego	feugan3333	neet :-)
