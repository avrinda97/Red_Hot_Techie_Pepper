2010-11-17T07:52:00.000Z	joshdreamland		So I updated to Maverick for some reason, it gripes about my CPU being insecure, then drops into tty1
2010-11-17T07:53:00.000Z	joshdreamland		Anyone have a great way to fix this, or am I going to have to grope it until it finishes and works
2010-11-17T07:53:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	the message about the CPU is probably not related to your other problem
2010-11-17T07:56:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	Is the message you're seeing this?: "Your CPU appears to be lacking expected security protections."
2010-11-17T07:56:00.000Z	joshdreamland	yeats	Yep.
2010-11-17T07:57:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	then that's a separate issue from your video issues - that message began in lucid as far as I know
2010-11-17T07:58:00.000Z	joshdreamland	yeats	I haven't seen it before. But yeah, I'll ignore it. So why's it dropping me into tty1 if all it's telling me is that message?
2010-11-17T07:59:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	don't know about that - I just knew that the CPU message was not related :-)
2010-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	hopefully that saves you from chasing a red herring
2010-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	probably not - I'm just saying *I* don't know - you might provide more details about it?
2010-11-17T08:02:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	there are regressions with nVidia cards - I have one, which is why I'm skipping Maverick
2010-11-17T08:04:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/616023
2010-11-17T08:07:00.000Z	joshdreamland	yeats	Thanks much. It says "fix released"... would that have already been in the update repository? I just installed today.
2010-11-17T08:11:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	possibly... you're able to update okay, right?
2010-11-17T08:12:00.000Z	joshdreamland	yeats	yep. I can access all tty layers, too. As if I booted then pressed ctrl-alt-f1
2010-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	hmm, so it's not freezing or anything, it just skips GDM and goes straight to TTY1?
2010-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	joshdreamland	yeats	Correct.
2010-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	have you checked the logs for any messages about video?
2010-11-17T08:14:00.000Z	joshdreamland	yeats	There are thousands.
2010-11-17T08:18:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	grep -c will count the lines returned, if that's what you mean
2010-11-17T08:18:00.000Z	joshdreamland	yeats	I want the line number in the file
2010-11-17T08:19:00.000Z	yeats	joshdreamland	grep -n
