2007-08-03T16:01:00.000Z	Cyber34		yeah I know, but there's that version of firefox that makes Flash work on AMD64 machines
2007-08-03T16:02:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	I had to use nspluginwrapper to get it working on my amd64 system
2007-08-03T16:03:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	can you login OK via a terminal (ctrl-alt-f1)?
2007-08-03T16:04:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	alt-f7 from the terminal will get you back into X
2007-08-03T16:08:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	have you made any alterations to you xorg.conf, installed any restricted drivers, or anything of that sort?
2007-08-03T16:10:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	try moving your current xorg.conf to xorg.conf.back (it's located in /etc/X11) and restart X to see if the problem persists
2007-08-03T16:12:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	if it works ok after you move the xorg.conf aside you may want to try installing the ATI driver again to see if the problem comes back
2007-08-03T16:13:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	I have no idea to be honest with you.
2007-08-03T16:17:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	good plan :)
2007-08-03T16:18:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	you said you installed a special version of firefox to support flash on your amd64 right?
2007-08-03T16:20:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	I installed regular firefox from ubuntu repo and used this method to get flash working on it. It worked for me you should try it. I have had no problems. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=341727
2007-08-03T16:21:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	I would remove whatever firefox you have installed and then get the one from ubuntu's repo so that you can view pages
2007-08-03T16:27:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	 you did not add a repository for that other version of firefox did you?
2007-08-03T16:26:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	did you set up a repo for this special version of firefox?
2007-08-03T16:28:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	also after you uninstall firefox you should clear out anything in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/ that is leftover
2007-08-03T16:29:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	those are per user and stored in your home directory
2007-08-03T16:31:00.000Z	Cyber34	Xenoie	uninstalling it via Synaptic deleted the directory
2007-08-03T16:32:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	/usr/lib/mozilla and /usr/lib/firefox both?
2007-08-03T16:33:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	also check ~/.mozilla/plugins and make sure nothing is in there
2007-08-03T16:36:00.000Z	Cyber34	Xenoie	is there an easy way to delete them via the file manager? or must I use a command from the terminal?
2007-08-03T16:38:00.000Z	Xenoie	Cyber34	you will need to be root to do it, you can just sudo rm -f /usr/lib/mozilla/ ; rm -f /usr/lib/firefox ; rm -f ~/.mozilla/plugins/
2007-08-03T16:50:00.000Z	Cyber34	Xenoie	I got the directories finally removed, however attempting to install firefox via Add/Remove Programs gives me
