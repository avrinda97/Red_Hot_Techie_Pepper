2010-07-27T17:16:00.000Z	kangarooo1		hello why i cant install wine? usind sudo aptitude install wine
2010-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 then try   sudo apt-get install wine
2010-07-27T17:16:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 that should have done it
2010-07-27T17:17:00.000Z	kangarooo1	coz_	Pici: no it just says No packages will be installed, upgraded, or removed. i have used before installing sudo aptitude update so i have all source lists.. strange
2010-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 just for kicks....   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	kangarooo1	coz_	ive done sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 ooo ok
2010-07-27T17:22:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	  open system/preferences/main menu
2010-07-27T17:22:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 see if it is listed in there
2010-07-27T17:22:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 if it is  untick and re tick the box next to it....it will likely show up
2010-07-27T17:25:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 I qam finding on lucid that installed applications do not always show up under the menus  right away...an old problem I never expected to see again... however  checking  in ghe main menu helps or just reboot
2010-07-27T17:25:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	  and "ghe"  is suppose to be "the"  sorry  damn fingers :)
2010-07-27T17:25:00.000Z	kangarooo1	coz_	im in xubuntu i dont have that menu. but i have file:///usr/share/applications/wine.desktop but it doesnt show up in menu.. maybe a new bug?
2010-07-27T17:26:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 oooo then I am at a loss...did you try rebooting to see if the menu gets refreshed??/ there used to be  a  sudo update-menus   command which no longer exists as far as I can see
2010-07-27T17:27:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 if all else fails... sudo apt-get autoremove --purge wine  and reinstall it
2010-07-27T17:28:00.000Z	kangarooo1	coz_	also ive experienced the same problem (programm item not showing but in applications folder it is) in another comp with google-gadgets-qt 2 days ago
2010-07-27T17:29:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 yeah as I mentioned... I have noticed this issue in Lucid... its an old problem that should have never  shown up again
2010-07-27T17:29:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 understood
2010-07-27T17:30:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	  did you open the Main Menu  and check?
2010-07-27T17:30:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 nevermind  you said this is  xfce
2010-07-27T17:31:00.000Z	coz_	kangarooo1	 sorry...did you say you already rebooted?
2010-07-27T17:56:00.000Z	kangarooo1	coz_	no i didnt restart.. that wont change anything for icons cache is beeing made every few minute. coz_: can u try sudo aptitude install google-gadgets-qt and see if it appears in menu? couse in 10.10 it didnt. and also i just installed in 10.04 on this one and also icon doesnt appear so thats some new bug.. if u can install then confirm it on Bug #610237
