2009-08-30T14:33:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	you need to make it look like this: http://pastebin.com/m3d9652d6
2009-08-30T14:34:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	no need to reboot, just sudo umount -a
2009-08-30T14:34:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	then sudo mount -a
2009-08-30T14:35:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	Oh you are testing auto mounting aren't you... maybe reboot then :)
2009-08-30T14:36:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	i did the umount and mount and I'm getting "mount point /media/raid5i does not exist, will it still work upon reboot?
2009-08-30T14:36:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	you need to make a driectory in /media with that name... ie: sudo mkdir /media/raid5i
2009-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	then try the umount -a and mount -a again
2009-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	that did it!!!!!!
2009-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	awesome
2009-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	tyvm
2009-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	may I suggest you use UUID instead of the /dev/sdb1
2009-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	sure, do i just replace "/dev/sdb1" with "UUID" ?
2009-08-30T14:40:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	no you need to find the UUID of /dev/sdb1... One second I gotta look it up
2009-08-30T14:40:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	ls /dev/disk/by-uuid
2009-08-30T14:41:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	and "blkid" to see what drive the UUID refers to
2009-08-30T14:41:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	ill do that now, out of curiosity why is that better practice then using the /dev/sdb1 ?
2009-08-30T14:42:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	yes, you can change the location of the drive inside the computer and it all still works
2009-08-30T14:42:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	that is you can change /dev/sdb1 to /devsdc1 and it will still work
2009-08-30T14:44:00.000Z	thahauss	mechdave	alrighty I'll do that, everyone ive talked to in the ubuntu channel has been extremely helpful us noobs appreciate that :P
2009-08-30T14:44:00.000Z	mechdave	thahauss	that is why we are here. We all started out as noobs once :)
