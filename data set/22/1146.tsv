2010-10-16T22:56:00.000Z	UTF		any of you guys ever had any trouble with copying new songs to an ipod/iphone using rythmbox? i just tried copying a few songs to both my iphone and ipod... but i think it does something wrong - i can't play any of them. *sniff sniff*
2010-10-16T22:57:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	Try gtkpod
2010-10-16T22:58:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	thanks bro :) i will give that a spin
2010-10-16T22:59:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	If your ipod is formatted with a mac, you will have to reformat it FAT to work with linux
2010-10-16T23:00:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	i have never formated it ever... it worked fine on 10.04 tho
2010-10-16T23:00:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	all the songs on both my ipod and iphone was copied using rythmbox in 10.04
2010-10-16T23:02:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	WHICH IPOD IS IT?
2010-10-16T23:02:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	both ipod nano and iphone 3g
2010-10-16T23:03:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	not sure about the nano... it's an 8gb but not sure which generation
2010-10-16T23:04:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	anything up to 5g should work. The new ones I`m not sure on
2010-10-16T23:05:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	ok i'll try to disable journaling and see what happens.. thanks a million for your help bro! very much appreciated
2010-10-16T23:05:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	Like I say try gtkpod, it works very well with my kids 5g nano
2010-10-16T23:06:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	roger that i just installed it :)
2010-10-16T23:32:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	tried gtkpod one song got successfully transfered and plays fine.. :) but the others still dont work.. weird eh? trying to figure something out
2010-10-16T23:34:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	I use gnupod, I don`t recomend it for desktop user. You may have to redo your ipod with gtkpod. Have you used your ipod on another machine?
2010-10-16T23:35:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	yes i have another laptop where i transferred songs from too... also running ubuntu
2010-10-16T23:35:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	that shouldn`t matter, both 10.04 +?
2010-10-16T23:36:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	aye the one i'm currently transfering from is 10.10
2010-10-16T23:36:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	Can`t speak, works with my kid's nano fine??????
2010-10-16T23:37:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	i'm gunna figure this out :) and once i do i'm gunna let you know... thanks a million for your help bro
2010-10-16T23:38:00.000Z	nothingspecial	UTF	No problem :)
2010-10-17T00:42:00.000Z	UTF	nothingspecial	think i figured something out... if i transfer the music files and wait 20 minutes it syncs a few times and then the transfered files seems to work :)
