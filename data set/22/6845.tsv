2006-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		Hi guys
2006-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		I'm in ubuntu
2006-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		and this rectangle thing came up
2006-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		ok
2006-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		does anybody else know what this box thing is?
2006-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		no, it's just a /_\ ! box thing
2006-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		it takes up most the screen
2006-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre		it's rather annoying
2006-07-14T09:54:00.000Z	nsasch	AlexThreeTwoThre	was it from Firefox?
2006-07-14T09:54:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre	nsasch	indeed it did
2006-07-14T09:55:00.000Z	nsasch	AlexThreeTwoThre	you said " a big blank box with /!\ in it", did the triangle have a bottom?
2006-07-14T09:55:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre	nsasch	yea, but I don't know how to make bottoms
2006-07-14T09:56:00.000Z	nsasch	AlexThreeTwoThre	when you restart, do you have to visit goatse again or does it just pop up?
2006-07-14T09:56:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre	nsasch	it just pops up
2006-07-14T09:56:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre	nsasch	it's rather annoying
2006-07-14T09:56:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre	nsasch	um, I think it was saix.be
2006-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	nsasch	AlexThreeTwoThre	I read something about spyware in Ubuntu, maybe that's it?
2006-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre	nsasch	whaT?
2006-07-14T09:59:00.000Z	nsasch	AlexThreeTwoThre	yea. there's a problem in Firefox where spyware can get installed in Ubuntu.
2006-07-14T10:00:00.000Z	nsasch	AlexThreeTwoThre	it gets you banned usually, please refrain from saying that
2006-07-14T10:00:00.000Z	AlexThreeTwoThre	nsasch	oh, why does it get you banned?
2006-07-14T10:01:00.000Z	nsasch	AlexThreeTwoThre	you might want to consider switching to Gentoo if optimal performance is necessary.
