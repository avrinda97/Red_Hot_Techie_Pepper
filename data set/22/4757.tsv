2007-10-20T09:07:00.000Z	joanki		what do i do now?
2007-10-20T09:07:00.000Z	joanki		i read that i need to create a swap space?
2007-10-20T09:08:00.000Z	joanki		is this correct?
2007-10-20T09:08:00.000Z	joanki		can someone help me?
2007-10-20T09:08:00.000Z	joanki		i'm trying to install ubuntu and it's becoming a disaster
2007-10-20T09:09:00.000Z	joanki		d drive is free space now
2007-10-20T09:09:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	is there an option to have Ubuntu use the free space?
2007-10-20T09:20:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	double ram doesn't necessarily apply to systems over 512 MB ram, that's an old guideline
2007-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	1536 ;)
2007-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	that's old advice, often still repeated
2007-10-20T09:26:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	I'd put the swap first, closest to the middle
2007-10-20T09:29:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	it would be fine, except you might be able to have a bigger /home, don't forget all your user files go on /home
2007-10-20T09:34:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	yes ext3
2007-10-21T05:16:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	sudo apt-get install xchat
2007-12-28T11:14:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	then hit alt+F2 and type the command there, it won't be the child of any terminal
2007-12-28T11:18:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	yeah just popped in ;)
2008-01-06T10:18:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	every player will utilize it
2008-01-06T10:18:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	vlc is good for dvd, try that one
2008-01-06T10:18:00.000Z	joanki	astro76	that one works - thabnks
2008-02-10T02:30:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	check what's set it in preferences > preferred applications ?
2008-02-10T02:49:00.000Z	joanki	astro76	, i did that, but what can i change there?
2008-02-10T02:50:00.000Z	astro76	joanki	the default media player, not sure if it will help or it's the problem
