2012-09-01T07:24:00.000Z	ebs512		is nobody using ubuntu 12.04 that can help me out?
2012-09-01T07:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	ask and see
2012-09-01T07:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	make it run:  gksudo nautilus $HOME
2012-09-01T07:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	copy one of the .desktop files from ~/.config/autostart   and edit it
2012-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	ebs512	ActionParsnip	how do I make a launcher shortcut with root permissions so I can just click the icon and it will let me edit files in the file system
2012-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	in the exec line, prefix the command with 'gksudo'
2012-09-03T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	the thing on the right is just conky, there are lots of configs for that
2012-09-03T09:50:00.000Z	ebs512	ActionParsnip	how do I get this theme, there isn't a download for it http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/ubuntu-12.04?before=1343608273
2012-09-03T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	the icon theme is the default gnome one (not humanity) with a glossy wallpaper and a dock, as well as gnome-panel instead of Unity
2012-09-03T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	could be avant-window-navigator times 2
2012-09-03T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	sure. I'd start with a base of XFCE and build up
2012-09-03T09:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	how do you mean? If you ask the guy for the wallpaper you'll probably have a desktop you like as unity will theme to the wallpaper
2012-09-03T09:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	a different desktop to the default gnome
2012-09-03T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	conky
2012-09-03T10:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	what is the output of:  uname -a
2012-09-03T10:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/no-ip/2.1.9-3/+build/972503/+files/noip2_2.1.9-3_amd64.deb; sudo dpkg -i ./noip2_2.1.9-3_amd64.deb; rm ./noip2_2.1.9-3_amd64.deb; sudo apt-get -f install
2012-09-03T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	try:  sudo noip2 -C
2012-09-04T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	run:  sudo apt-get -f install
2012-09-04T07:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	which theme?
2012-09-04T07:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	hunt around and you can find a GTK3 theme, then just get a wallpaper and an icon set
2012-09-04T09:02:00.000Z	ebs512	ActionParsnip	are you around?
2012-09-04T09:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebs512	run:  gksudo nautilus $HOME     and you can write files and folders wherever you desire
