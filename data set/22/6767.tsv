2006-08-04T14:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	ubuntu-desktop works on them too ;)
2006-08-04T14:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	that depends on the laptop - and Linux is getting better at working with/on laptops
2006-08-04T14:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	I don't know, I've never had to use SAMBA
2006-08-04T14:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	if you really need a firewall, just install Firestarter
2006-08-04T14:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	and avoid Automatix, it breaks things
2006-08-04T14:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	use Synaptic instead, it's a bit easier than apt-get
2006-08-04T14:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	firestarter should be in Synaptic - if it's available thru apt-get, it'll be visible in Synaptic
2006-08-04T14:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	which is?
2006-08-04T14:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	yeah, it's not very big, but it works well
2006-08-04T14:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	don't bother. There really aren't any viruses that can attack Linux
2006-08-07T14:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	yes, it's in Universe
2006-08-07T14:31:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyX	Madpilot	i forgot the command , sudo apt-get install file.tar.gz ?? is it correct ?
2006-08-07T14:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	no, just 'sudo apt-get install mozilla'
2006-08-07T14:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	you don't need to do that - apt-get gets the files from repos
2006-08-07T14:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	you don't need to, that's what apt-get is for...
2006-08-07T14:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	apt-get is
2006-08-07T14:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	you could, but there's no reason to
2006-08-07T14:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	apt-get (or Synaptic) is the easiest way to do things - but yes, this time you will have to re-download some things
2006-08-07T14:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	apt-get is designed to download from the repositories
2006-08-07T14:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	"sudo apt-get install" - you forgot the 'install' part
2006-08-17T15:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	those packages should be in Ubuntu's archives - no need to get them off the website
2006-08-17T15:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	IRCMonkeyX	sorry, I'm not sure how freedict works
