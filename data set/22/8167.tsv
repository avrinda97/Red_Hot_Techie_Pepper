2006-09-01T12:14:00.000Z	Wizardling		I'm a liitle irritated that I've been banned from a channel supposedly for calling the jerk op a nazi. In fact - and as the transcript shows - all I was doing was mentioning the Usenet 'nazi rule' which says that the mention of nazis or the like is the sign a thread is hoplessly gone bananas. I said this because someone ELSE had just called someone Gestapo.
2006-09-01T12:14:00.000Z	Wizardling		Basically the op was just looking for anything he could twist to get me banned.
2006-09-01T12:16:00.000Z	Wizardling		So to whom does someone complain about an op run amok in an offical channel?
2006-09-01T12:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	i know you're frustrated now, and i also know you won't like what i have to say
2006-09-01T12:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	it's offtopic here, but also, it looke like the only thing you can do now is save logs, to show someone tomorrow, when /stats p is non-zeru
2006-09-01T12:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	meanwhile is there any ubuntu question you have? :)
2006-09-01T12:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	okay, just hoping some support issue might be a good distractor, heh
2006-09-01T12:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	i've heard the alternatecd helps with lowmem installs too, if that helps
2006-09-01T12:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	i'd say a bug report
2006-09-01T12:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	yeah, it's a fix really, just prioritize it reasonably :)
2006-09-01T12:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	well, an ubuntu bug has someone that will look into it, try to send it upstream if s/he knows a better contact, and they may well be fluent in the current development, whereas the upstream author may have just let the man page atrophy
2006-09-01T12:46:00.000Z	Wizardling	eyequeue	- cheers. Some of the man authors wrote this stuff years and years ago. Which isn't too suprising. Some programs have not changed a not and don't really need to. Though in a few cases I've noticed, the man pages could be a bit better.
2006-09-01T12:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	yeah, linux could use some really great documentation writers it seems
2006-09-01T12:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	lol at "space"d out, and alot -> a lot :)  btw, applause for fixing that, it's a pet peeve :)
2006-09-01T12:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	yeah, and the option for a non-coder to "give back" is nice to be able to point out
2006-09-01T12:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	this channel is often my means for that, but some can't handle the scroll, etc heh
2006-09-01T12:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	plus, docs they can take their time with and spell-check, rather than the public embarassment that typing like i do would cause them, lol
2006-09-01T12:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	may i ask which?  i found some nice blog software in debian, but it had zero english docs and i had to abandon it ... written in ruby which i think shared the same plight at the time
2006-09-01T12:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	you communicate well, and got "a lot" right, so you have my vote, lol ... um, do you mind me suggesting something?
2006-09-01T12:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	http://doc.ubuntu.com/
2006-09-01T12:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	they have an irc channel here too, i'm sure they'd love to help you get started, and if you want, drop my name, they won't know me probably, lol
2006-09-01T13:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	Wizardling	work through lunch only if the job is fun, or the pay is great, heh
