2008-07-13T08:18:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus		hello all
2008-07-13T08:19:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus		I was wondering if any of you guys could help me out with something
2008-07-13T08:20:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus		ok
2008-07-13T08:21:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus		I'm about to install Ubuntu (Ubuntu Studio, actually) on an AMD Athlon 64 4000+ Socket 949 pc, with 1gb ddr 400 (2.5 cas latency), 160gb sata2 drive, on a chaintech vnf4 ultra mobo and a gigabyte geforce 6600GT 128mb ddr3 video board: what should I install, i386 or amd64?
2008-07-13T08:22:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus		(i have both versions copied to cd/dvd, for both ubuntu and ubustu)
2008-07-13T08:22:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	I always reccomend 32-bit unless there's some good reason to use 64-bit.
2008-07-13T08:23:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	good reasons include: scientific software, intense mathematical processing, more than 4GB RAM on the system, like to play with 64bit stuff...
2008-07-13T08:27:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	64bit can be slightly slower in some cases, but most people don't really see much of a difference.
2008-07-13T08:30:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	Probably not.  :)  x64 can do larger math at once, but of course it means that programs use more memory and can sometimes take longer.
2008-07-13T08:38:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	you know, you can always use the Desktop CD to install Ubuntu without partitioning.  It's not exactly as fast but maybe you could try 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu that way before you go and repartition.
2008-07-13T08:42:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	you can install Ubuntu on different physical drives and still dual-boot.
2008-07-13T08:43:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	my advice is to delete your D: partition and just leave it blank.  Ubuntu will configure and partition the blank space for you.
2008-07-13T09:05:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	yes, you're right.
2008-07-13T09:11:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	that's very generous of you.  :)
2008-07-13T09:11:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus	nhaines	well, that's what it's all about, isn't it?
2008-07-13T09:11:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	indeed.  :)
2008-07-13T09:12:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus	nhaines	that's why I want to get into this. I'm actually quite psyched.
2008-07-13T09:12:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus	nhaines	ofcourse, the only thing I can program is math games in basic.
2008-07-13T09:12:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus	nhaines	or play with the logo turtle.
2008-07-13T09:13:00.000Z	Pithecanthropus	nhaines	BUT, i can learn.
2008-07-13T09:13:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	you can!  :D  Python's good for learning--very easy like BASIC but much more powerful.  Can't do drivers in it, though.
2008-07-13T09:13:00.000Z	nhaines	Pithecanthropus	best of luck!  We look forward to seeing you back in a half hour!  :)
