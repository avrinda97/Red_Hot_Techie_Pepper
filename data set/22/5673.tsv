2007-04-01T14:45:00.000Z	shinichizio		Can I ask a question about Nautilus? or should I go somewhere else?
2007-04-01T14:47:00.000Z	shinichizio		It just quit unexpectedly
2007-04-01T14:48:00.000Z	shinichizio		It's becoming expected at this point.
2007-04-01T14:49:00.000Z	shinichizio		thunar?
2007-04-01T14:49:00.000Z	shinichizio		Oh. Okay. Wait, is there a way to manage files without that? Like, via the terminal?
2007-04-01T14:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	Lots of people use bash as their file manager
2007-04-01T15:14:00.000Z	shinichizio	ardchoille	.....I was saying that, having read that exact botscript, that I felt bad for crashing something that itself crashes systems. That makes me like, extra-clumsy.
2007-04-09T12:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	You start by checking the repos for apps you want. If they aren't there, you can look around for a .deb package made for Ubuntu. If that doesn't help, you can download and compile apps. Most source tarballs will include a README or INSTALL file.. you should read those first.
2007-04-09T12:29:00.000Z	shinichizio	ardchoille	My system is being lame and crashing whenever I do arbitrary things. Besides, I've already downloaded the stupid tar.gz :p
2007-04-09T12:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	Which app is it?
2007-04-09T12:29:00.000Z	shinichizio	ardchoille	Adobe Reader 7.0, I think
2007-04-09T12:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	Enable the multiverse repo, then: sudo apt-get install acroread
2007-04-09T12:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	It's in the repos :)
2007-04-09T12:32:00.000Z	shinichizio	ardchoille	But I already downloaded it. it's 40meg. That's painful to have to re-do on a 56k dial-up connection. ;_;
2007-04-09T12:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	Your call
2007-04-09T12:33:00.000Z	shinichizio	ardchoille	Not really. What's the problem with just compiling it from the tarball, anyway?
2007-04-09T12:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	Well, I always install from the repos first, it ensures the stability of your syste. You can compile it I suppose, but you will have to do updates manually, this may mean downloading large tarballs and re-compiling in the future.
2007-04-09T12:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	You will also have to do deps resolving manually if you compile
2007-04-09T12:35:00.000Z	shinichizio	ardchoille	Aaah. Well, stability is something I'm lacking in obscene amounts. ;_; So I'll just apt-get it. Thanks for the explanation
2007-04-09T12:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	You're welcome :)
2007-04-09T12:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	shinichizio	I'll beat you to it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories
2007-04-09T12:37:00.000Z	shinichizio	ardchoille	Thanks again
