2007-08-13T11:45:00.000Z	alphanimal		So, I couldnt find anything on the help pages... In the audio settings, I selected my External sound card as the default one. But XMMS (for example) plays sound on my internal Laptop speakers. (Selected ALSA in XMMS settings with default audio autput device). If i select OOS, sound comes from my external card but then no other app can play sound to that device. I tried every possible configuration but i cant get all apps to play sound over

2007-08-13T11:47:00.000Z	Pelo	alphanimal	 if you change your sound devide to oss you'll need to change the sound device in your apps as well , but I think gnome native apps should see the change whithout help,( like gnome and rythmbox)
