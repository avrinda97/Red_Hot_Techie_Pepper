2008-06-17T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	Gnome has actually been getting faster with each release for a while
2008-06-17T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	I would go with Hardy
2008-06-17T10:39:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	I just used the 5.04 cd
2008-06-17T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	Why not download and burn Hardy?
2008-06-17T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	If that does not work 5.04 -> 5.10 -> 8.04 may be safer
2008-06-17T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	sorry, 5.04 -> 5.10 -> 6.06 -> 8.04
2008-06-17T12:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	yeah, but I have 8.04 cd to install from if it doesn't work
2008-06-17T12:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	I doubt it will work :), you do know about the alternate install CD, correct?
2008-06-17T12:20:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	yeah, but I don't have a working burner. I can use the live cd if I have to, I just expect it to be slow. I just built this pc from parts I had in a box. I'm surprised it turned on
2008-06-17T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	If you do use the LiveCD keep the swap partition ( don't reformat it ), the LiveCD will make use of it automatically ( IIRC ) which should help
2008-06-17T12:22:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	oh really? I didn't know that. I should have just done a reinstall from live then. I just dread live cd's on really old computers.

2011-04-07T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	... If you'd like to talk with the channel ops join #ubuntu-ops.
2011-04-07T10:49:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	thanks!
2011-04-07T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	You're welcome.
2011-04-07T10:49:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	now that you mention that, someone told me that recently, and I forgot I had even asked.
2011-10-17T03:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	Waves: Do not use "-d", that's for development versions.
2011-10-17T03:36:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	thanks for the tip!
2012-11-01T10:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	Any of your primary partition slots (even all of them) can be used as extended partitions. It just doesn't make much sense to do so as you lose flexibility and gain nothing.
2012-11-01T10:33:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	wikipedia entry on mbr disagrees.   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning#PC_partition_types
2012-11-01T10:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Seven_Six_Two	I stand corrected then. Thanks.
2012-11-01T10:34:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Jordan_U	np. I just learned that too
