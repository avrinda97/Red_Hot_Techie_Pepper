2005-06-24T09:15:00.000Z	bigfoot1		anybody using J-pilot here?
2005-06-24T09:16:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	yep
2005-06-24T09:17:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	do you have your Memo Categories working in J-Pilot? Coz all my memos are in the "unfiled" category in Jpilot.
2005-06-24T09:18:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	okay.
2005-06-24T09:18:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	what Palm device do you have?
2005-06-24T09:19:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	i have Visor Pro.
2005-06-24T09:19:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	what version of Palm OS do they run? is it 3.5 like the other visors?
2005-06-24T09:20:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	version 3.5
2005-06-24T09:23:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	sounds like it's probably a pilot-link problem
2005-06-24T09:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	how do i fix that then?
2005-06-24T09:24:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	not sure - probably best asking on the pilot-link mailing list
2005-06-24T09:28:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	Nermal; sorry. I checked again and everything's find with JPilot and categories. I just had to scroll to see the other categories. Oops. 8-()
2005-06-24T09:30:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	no problem - I learned a bit about how pilot-link works from the mailing list, anyway :)
2005-09-29T14:31:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	yes, I use oepra
2005-09-29T14:33:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	thanks. may i ask you a question regarding audio? I'm trying to get a smi (audio) file to work. When i click on the link, it asks if i want to download it. Then when i select open, it opens up gedit. Maybe you can tell me what your Preferences/advanced/downloads. Here is an example URL http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/share/audio/smil.php?passage=Luke+1%3A1
2005-09-29T14:36:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	when it asks to to open/save, click the 'Change..' button
2005-09-29T14:37:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	what's an example of smi player? i have totem,vlc, xine, musicplayer
2005-09-29T14:40:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	realplayer plays them, I think
2005-09-29T14:40:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	is realplayer what you use?
2005-09-29T14:41:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	I don't particularly play SMIL files, but I do know how mime handling works in opera :)
2005-09-29T14:42:00.000Z	bigfoot1	cazabam	thanks. then I guess i'll get realplayer, if that's what i need to play SMIL files.
2005-09-29T14:43:00.000Z	cazabam	bigfoot1	realplayer is in backports (I think)
