2008-04-08T13:40:00.000Z	akatsuki		well i want to get in to inittab in order to free up more memory.. tahts why.. i want to disable some virtual consoles that i never use
2008-04-08T13:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	akatsuki	then rename the /etc/event.d/tty* files that you do not need
2008-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	akatsuki		for example respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty3, 4, 5, and 6
2008-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	akatsuki		i want to add a # there
2008-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	akatsuki		is the only way i know how
2008-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	akatsuki		the way i use to do it before
2008-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	akatsuki	erUSUL	i dont know how to do that
2008-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	akatsuki		how is that method
2008-04-08T13:44:00.000Z	akatsuki	erUSUL	i try  /etc/event.d/tty but its blank
2008-04-08T13:44:00.000Z	akatsuki		i cant see any data there:S
2008-04-08T13:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	akatsuki	"sudo mv /etc/event.d/tty6 /etc/event.d/tty6.disabled" for example
2008-04-08T13:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	akatsuki	and the same for the rest of the unneeded vt's
2008-04-08T13:46:00.000Z	akatsuki		really?? for example sudo mv /etc/event.d/tty6 /etc/event.d/tty6.disabled would work for #6:23: respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty6??

2008-04-08T13:50:00.000Z	akatsuki	erUSUL	:( this appears: mv: cannot stat `/etc/event.d/tty6': No such file or directory
2008-04-08T13:51:00.000Z	akatsuki		the one i want to disable is  #6:23: respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty6
