2007-07-12T05:14:00.000Z	Mocheeze		yeah
2007-07-12T05:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	IIRC you can use testdisk to fix your partition table
2007-07-12T05:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	I would try testdisk first, then when you are sure your partition table is good fix grub
2007-07-12T05:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	Did you run sudo testdisk ?
2007-07-12T05:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	Analize current structure and look for missing partitions
2007-07-12T05:52:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	here's what I get: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29591/
2007-07-12T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	I guess proceed?
2007-07-12T05:55:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	part deux: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29593/
2007-07-12T05:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	I guess that it doesn't see any problems with your partition table, what is the next screen?
2007-07-12T06:01:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29595/ basically just the screen where i confirm the changes made in the last screen, and i didn't make any
2007-07-12T06:01:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	it it a problem that I have two partitions listed with "P" next to them?
2007-07-12T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	I think that just means primary
2007-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	If you are daring let it write the new partition table
2007-07-12T06:04:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	thanks for helping, i've never had to deal with anything like this before :/ suggestion on what to do next?
2007-07-12T06:08:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	What should my next course of action be?
2007-07-12T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	Let it write the new partition table ( back up the old one if you have important data on this drive ) and then re-install grub
2007-07-12T06:09:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	I didn't edit any of the table, so would that accomplish anything?
2007-07-12T06:09:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	should I just reinstall grub then?
2007-07-12T06:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	If it was messed up it might fix it
2007-07-12T06:11:00.000Z	Mocheeze	Jordan_U	does it matter if I reboot (which testdisk says is required) before i install grub, or should I restart everything an then reinstall grub?
2007-07-12T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	I would reboot then install grub
2007-07-12T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Mocheeze	np
