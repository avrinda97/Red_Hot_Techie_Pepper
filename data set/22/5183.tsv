2008-01-10T19:45:00.000Z	adante		hi, i have a directory which someone else put files into - is there a way for me to remove this directory?
2008-01-10T19:45:00.000Z	adante		when i try the normal -rf it says cannot remove the files, permission denied
2008-01-10T19:45:00.000Z	th0r	adante	 you should be able to delete it as root...use 'sudo rmdir'
2008-01-10T19:46:00.000Z	adante	th0r	i do not have root access on this box
2008-01-10T19:46:00.000Z	th0r	adante	then no...you won't be able to delete it
2008-01-10T23:57:00.000Z	th0r	adante	if the names are not registered in dns, you can add them to /etc/hosts manually
2008-06-26T22:14:00.000Z	th0r	adante	if the computer is capable of booting from the memory stick then you will not even get to grub
2008-06-26T22:15:00.000Z	adante	th0r	i booted into the livecd and ran grub
2008-06-26T22:15:00.000Z	adante	th0r	did you mean 'is not capable'?
2008-06-26T22:16:00.000Z	th0r	adante	no I meant IS capable. By the time you get to grub you are already booting off the hard drive or the cd
2008-06-26T22:17:00.000Z	th0r	adante	booting off a usb or sd drive is a bios function, not a function of grub
2008-06-26T22:19:00.000Z	adante	th0r	right, but i assumed grub got its list of drives from querying the bios, hence if grub could not see my sd drive, neither could my bios
2008-06-26T22:20:00.000Z	th0r	adante	nope, grub only sees what is in /boot/grub/menu.lst, so there might even be hard drives it doesn't know about
2008-06-26T22:20:00.000Z	adante	th0r	i'm talking about the commandline grub not the boot manager
2008-06-26T22:21:00.000Z	th0r	adante	by the time you are talking to grub you are already past the boot device decision.
2008-06-26T22:21:00.000Z	adante	th0r	ok, so right now i am in the livecd trying to set it up to boot from the sd card for the next time i reboot
2008-06-26T22:22:00.000Z	th0r	adante	which may or may not work...depending on if your computer can boot off the sd card.
2008-06-26T22:22:00.000Z	adante	th0r	when i open up a terminal, run grub, type 'root ( <TAB>', it shows nothing
2008-06-26T22:23:00.000Z	adante	th0r	right so hence my original question, if grub cannot see a drive then it implies i cannot boot from my sd card
2008-06-26T22:23:00.000Z	th0r	adante	no...grub has absolutely nothing to do with what device you boot off of...it is a bios function
2008-06-26T22:25:00.000Z	adante	th0r	ok, i understand that, grub is called AFTER bios invokes the mbr or whatever disk. The thing is i do not have an mbr of grub on my sd card so i am trying to install one to it using the grub command line program, but i cannot figure out how to because grub cannot see any candidate drives to install to
2008-06-26T22:26:00.000Z	th0r	adante	ok...so your question is "How do I create a bootable sd card"...
