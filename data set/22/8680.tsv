2009-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	Jennifer		hello all.  My ubuntu freezes seemingly random, version 9.04
2009-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	Jennifer		I'm sitting in front of a frozen PC right now
2009-10-20T21:45:00.000Z	Jennifer		any suggestions how to find out what the problem is?
2009-10-20T21:45:00.000Z	Jennifer		rsk....sensors show cpu at 44C
2009-10-20T21:45:00.000Z	Jennifer		thiebaude...good question...if i remember correctly its Nvidia
2009-10-20T21:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	check the various log files under /var/log/ (messages syslog kernel.log )
2009-10-20T21:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	when the look up happens do the leds of the keyboard start blinking ?
2009-10-20T21:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	well we can rule out a "kernel panic" then :)
2009-10-20T21:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	not likely; we can not know. Not enough info yet
2009-10-20T21:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	look from the end upwards. Looking for something odd
2009-10-20T22:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	Harrison_Bergero nothing in there... what about syslog or messages ?
2009-10-20T22:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	logs are rotated so they not get to big
2009-10-20T22:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	no is the last before the log rotation took place
2009-10-20T22:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	logrotation happens in a cron job
2009-10-20T22:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	oops messages
2009-10-20T22:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_oops
2009-10-20T22:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	yes i was looking... so we do not have any info ... :|
2009-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	i dunno; do you use the propietary nvidia drivers ?
2009-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	maybe you can try i while with the nv driver (no 3d) and see if the issue appears or not
2009-10-20T22:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	sandyd80 sorry been away a while
2009-10-20T22:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	really is hard to know what is happening with th3e info we have...
2009-10-20T23:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jennifer	been away a while again sorry; good luck with the testing
