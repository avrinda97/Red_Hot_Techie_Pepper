2011-01-03T09:16:00.000Z	skilz	NiftyLettuce	How do I do that?
2011-01-03T09:16:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	you will need to manually control fans via sudo pwmconfig
2011-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	have you tried lm-sensors and sensors-applet to monitor the RPM's?
2011-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	you can set the fans to kick in at certain temperatures I believe
2011-01-03T09:02:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	my problem is that I can't detect fan sensor...
2011-01-03T09:02:00.000Z	skilz	NiftyLettuce	thats what I want to change, they do kick in at certain temeratures which is annoying, i'd rather it just go going full time

2011-01-03T09:04:00.000Z	skilz	NiftyLettuce	Ok, I installed lm-sensors now how do I use it?
2011-01-03T09:05:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	sudo sensors-detect
2011-01-03T09:05:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	then sudo sensors
2011-01-03T09:05:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	say yes to all
2011-01-03T09:15:00.000Z	skilz	NiftyLettuce	Hey i typed 'sensors' and I got this Adapter: Virtual device
2011-01-03T09:15:00.000Z	skilz	NiftyLettuce	acpitz-virtual-0
2011-01-03T09:15:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	so that is telling you the CPU temperature, you need to configure it to read fan etc
2011-01-03T09:17:00.000Z	skilz	NiftyLettuce	/usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed
2011-01-03T09:17:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	this might assist http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1297008&page=5 -- I recommend a lot of googling using search like: +asus +fan +sensor +control
2011-01-03T09:17:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	thats because you need to add them via modprobe (sensor)
2011-01-03T09:17:00.000Z	skilz	NiftyLettuce	Can you plz pm me with instructions
2011-01-03T09:17:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	you can manually add them with sudo gedit /etc/modules
2011-01-03T09:18:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	email me with your system specs niftylettuce@gmail.com
2011-01-03T09:19:00.000Z	NiftyLettuce	skilz	ill brb, trying out a 3d ati driver
