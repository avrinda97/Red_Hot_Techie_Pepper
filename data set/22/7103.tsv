2007-04-20T09:30:00.000Z	AzMoo		Hey, I'm just starting the upgrade to feisty and it's telling me that there's "no valid mirror". I'm using my ISP's mirror, which has 7.04 on there, last updated April 19th. Is it OK to continue?
2007-04-20T09:31:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	  the servers are a bit overwhelmed at the moment,  everybody and their goldfish is upgrading,  my suggestion wait a couple of days
2007-04-20T09:31:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	That's why I want to use my ISP's mirror.
2007-04-20T09:32:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	 consider that your isp mirror might not be up to date yet
2007-05-26T08:55:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	 what is your videocard ?
2007-05-26T08:56:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	Intel 855GM Integrated. It's in my notebook.
2007-05-26T08:57:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	ok that sounds a bit odd,  look in menuy > system > admin > restricted drivers  try that to start with
2007-05-26T08:58:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	My hardware does not need any restricted drivers.
2007-05-26T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	 ok   try the following command    sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-05-26T09:04:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	Went through the xserver reconfigure and restarted gdm and I'm still getting the same issue. I think my notebook may have finally kicked the bucket :\
2007-05-26T09:05:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	is tis a recent problem or did is start after and upgrade or a fresh install ?
2007-05-26T09:06:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	I went to sleep last night and it was all going fine, woke up this morning and it was stuffed.
2007-05-26T09:08:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	 did it hibernate ?
2007-05-26T09:08:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	Blank screen. I have hibernate switched off.
2007-05-26T09:09:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	segfaulting is one of those serious errors, it might be worth the trouble to reinstal ubuntu and not assume the lappy is dead yet
2007-05-26T09:09:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	Mine's not segfaulting, who_cares is having the segfault problem ;)
2007-05-26T09:10:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	oh, sorry ,   advice still applies,  try reinstlling just in case
2007-05-26T09:10:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	OK, why not? Guess it can't get much worse :p Thanks for the help.
2007-05-26T09:12:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	 booting up the live cd should tell you if the screen is borked or if the instlled is
2007-05-26T09:13:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	good point. I'll see if I can find it.
2008-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	Pelo	AzMoo	dl the .deb package directly from the mirror
2008-01-04T06:58:00.000Z	AzMoo	Pelo	ok, ta.
