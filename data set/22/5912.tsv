2007-12-04T08:48:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	when i unpluge my ethernet cable, how do i make my internet connect wirelessly, or should it automatically?

2007-12-04T08:49:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	the network icon in the corner doesn't list the available wireless networks?
2007-12-04T08:49:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	no not when i unplug my ethernet cable, and i have the updated driver for my wireless card
2007-12-04T08:50:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	when you right click the icon you do have Enable Wireless checked correct?
2007-12-04T08:51:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	when i right click it has "enable networking" checked and nothing else shows up
2007-12-04T08:52:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	any ideas on what to do??
2007-12-04T08:52:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	you're wireless card isn't enabled at the moment somehow, what type of card do you have?
2007-12-04T08:53:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	a broadcom card that i have the driver downloaded and installed for, how do i enable it?
2007-12-04T08:53:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	is the module currently loaded?
2007-12-04T08:53:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	how do i tell?
2007-12-04T08:53:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	does it show up with the lsmod command?
2007-12-04T08:54:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	im a novice with terms like that, how do i tell?
2007-12-04T08:54:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	do you know the name of the module for your wireless card that you installed?
2007-12-04T08:55:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	you mean the driver? it was like rev 02 bla bla bla and im prety sure i installed it correctly
2007-12-04T08:55:00.000Z	patrick__	kelsin	under my restricted drivers it says firmware for my broadcom 43xx chipset family is in use
2007-12-04T08:55:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	ok will you need to open a terminal and run "lsmod" and see if the driver you installed is in the list. If it's not you need to try and load it with "modprobe <drivername>" I can't help you find the driver name
2007-12-04T08:56:00.000Z	kelsin	patrick__	also when you run "iwconfig" in a terminal does it list anything besides lines with "No wireless extensions"
