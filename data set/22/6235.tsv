2007-09-21T07:58:00.000Z	MasterShrek	jaime	maybe when gutsy comes out next month it will work out of the box, but the kernel in feisty is a little bit outdated

2007-09-21T08:00:00.000Z	MasterShrek	jaime	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and change every instance of feisty to gutsy, then sudo apt-get update, and finally sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-09-21T08:00:00.000Z	MasterShrek	jaime	beware tho, its prolly going to break your system, well not nessicarily, but a good chance
