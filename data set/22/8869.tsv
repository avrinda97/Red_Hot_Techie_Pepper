2005-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	digitalwoot	nickrud	thanks
2005-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I tried throwing a http in there.. that doesn't work.. I searched for binardriverhowto on the wiki and no luck you have a direct clickable link?

2005-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	digitalwoot		here's the blatant reason I am a noob... - I didn't know that was there... "fglrxconfig"
2005-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I used to use linux... "mandrake" like years ago.... I have never used any debian based stuff...
2005-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I agree since they are specific to this os... ;-) thank you delire...
2005-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	digitalwoot		actually... a while ago I think I was on this room and you helped me then as well so thanks again..
2005-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	digitalwoot		so somewhere I can find kde for debian/unbuntu... I'd have to download it to my pb and take it home.. my ubuntu box doesn't have net yet
2005-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	nickrud	digitalwoot	take a look at apt-zip, it makes it easy
2005-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	nickrud		lived on a 3k dialup for a year, it was a godsend
2005-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I have never used gnome... I have.. to download it on a powerbook and then take it to ubuntu
2005-04-30T13:47:00.000Z	nickrud	digitalwoot	exactly what you need
2005-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I am on a powerbook right now
2005-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	digitalwoot		and have no net connection to download stuff on the ubuntu box
2005-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	digitalwoot		so no apt-get..
2005-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	digitalwoot		:-\
2005-04-30T13:48:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I have two machines

2005-04-30T13:49:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I am at the office now ;-)
2005-04-30T13:49:00.000Z	nickrud	digitalwoot	you select the things you want on ubuntu, apt-zip will make a list you can download on the powerbook. it WORKS
