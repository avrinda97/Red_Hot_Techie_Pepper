2010-12-19T16:39:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	Knowing that, you could go to option #7 on this page - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275
2010-12-19T16:39:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	oh. That's what I was afraid of...
2010-12-19T16:40:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	I know you probably are exhausted fixing the drivers, but you might want to hang on a bit longer and see if you can fix it :)
2010-12-19T16:43:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	yeah, well, this last week my work computer's display adapter broke down, and i had to reinstall ubunut to get the new one to work, also my netbook's display broke, and now this with my home laptop... yes, pretty exchauseted :D but I want things to work, so...
2010-12-19T16:44:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	so how can I proceed with trying to fix the driver?
2010-12-19T16:47:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	Wlan drivers right? Unless it is a very new laptop you should be able to dig up something. Unless you have a WUSB54GC card, I cant help
2010-12-19T16:47:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	yes, it's WLAN, and pretty old laptop, wireless is via PCMCIA (or PC-card wherver they are called these days) slot.
2010-12-19T16:48:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	the wlan card is newer than the laptop.
2010-12-19T16:49:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	Wow! :)
2010-12-19T16:49:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	in fact, it's a wlan card I bought for this computer just because I migrated from windows to ubuntu and the previous wlan card didn't work with ubuntu... :)
2010-12-19T16:50:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	computer is IBM ThinkPad T30, Wlan card is DLink AirPlus G DWL-G630.
2010-12-19T16:52:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	You know, I used to run almost that same exact setup. But no more. I really don't know what is going to work with that setup.
2010-12-19T16:53:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	well, ubuntu 10.04 did work very well. :(
2010-12-19T16:54:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	i guess I could buy at least 1.5 years more life by downgrading, then. *sigh*
2010-12-19T16:55:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	I think that is the way you need to go.
2010-12-19T16:56:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	That Thinkpad doesn't have USB does it?
2010-12-19T16:57:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	yes it does. USB 1.0 :D
2010-12-19T16:59:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	Well, you could get a cheap adapter on Ebay or somewhere. 10 bucks? WG111v2 or something.
2010-12-19T17:00:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	yea, that's probably what i'll try to do. less trouble than messing with downgrading.
2010-12-19T17:00:00.000Z	FishFace	Ileden	I'm off to work. Good luck on that :)
2010-12-19T17:00:00.000Z	Ileden	FishFace	thanks for the help!
