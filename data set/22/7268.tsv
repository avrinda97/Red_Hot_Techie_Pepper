2006-08-30T16:17:00.000Z	ranpha		hi question, i want to know something about filesystem.. No not which is better and faster for boot. No i want to know which filesystem is best for datastorage.It has to be safe, stable less errors and a undelete function.. what do you think?
2006-08-30T16:19:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	what style of undelete do you need?
2006-08-30T16:21:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	what type of undelete though?  recyclebin style, full archival, full-archival with branching?
2006-08-30T16:23:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	so you need historical?  what granularity?  (i.e., if a program writes something to a file every 10 seconds for a year, do you need every version?)
2006-08-30T16:24:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	would something like a write-once file system be appropriate then?
2006-08-30T16:24:00.000Z	ranpha	cwillu	write-once???
2006-08-30T16:25:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	files are readonly once written
2006-08-30T16:26:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	but the duplicates would have to be undeletable for all time?
2006-08-30T16:26:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	then it'd be easier to have a file system that's write once, and then another file system that just links to iot
2006-08-30T16:28:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	do you need to be able to recover from somebody blanking out a photo?
2006-08-30T16:29:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	I'd recommend sticking with ext3 then, it's the most stable file system on linux
2006-08-30T16:30:00.000Z	ranpha	cwillu	okay thanks
2006-08-30T16:32:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	you can go poking through the contents with any disk editor
2006-08-30T16:33:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	ext3 just tries really really hard not to lose stuff in the first place (/lost+found generally contains stuff it finds after a hard reboot, generally stuff that was unlinked, but the metadata wasn't updated yet)
2006-08-30T16:34:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	lost-as-in-deleted-files really shouldn't be easily recoverable, and ext3 is robust to pretty much everything else that would cause it, beyond hardware failure
2006-08-30T16:35:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	might be non-trivial to set up, but it should be quite possible
2006-08-30T16:36:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	are you familiar with the command line methods of configuring interfaces?
2006-08-30T16:37:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	should probably get in the habit of mv'ing stuff instead, or just using gnome/nautilus (which has a trash bin)
2006-08-30T16:38:00.000Z	ranpha	cwillu	i prefer using networkmanager but i want to do this. have two account. one is connect to wirless and the other is connect to wired network
2006-08-30T16:38:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	but I generally appreciate it that stuff (such as private keys) is actually gone when I tell the system to remove it :)
2006-08-30T16:39:00.000Z	cwillu	ranpha	or start using version control on your photo's
2006-08-30T16:41:00.000Z	ranpha	cwillu	but what about my plan with two networks???
