2006-01-28T10:53:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	no im saving up some cash i want to do a masters degree in computer science :)
2006-01-28T11:01:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	no its a .run file as far as im aware
2006-01-28T11:08:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	which driver are you installing?
2006-01-28T11:08:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	the one of the ati site?
2006-01-28T11:08:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	I wouldn't do that.  Please use the ubuntu fglrx packages instead.
2006-01-28T11:09:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	dont i have to uninstall the ones i have???
2006-01-28T11:09:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	you should, yes.
2006-01-28T11:10:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	yeah one of them sites i followed the instructions exactly so i guesse im gunna have to do the other one
2006-01-28T11:11:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	but dont i have to unistall the ones in installed first?
2006-01-28T11:11:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	I would highly recommend it.
2006-01-28T11:11:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	how do i uninstall them?
2006-01-28T11:12:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	sorry, ati.com downloads aren't really the topic of support here
2006-01-28T11:12:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	so what do i do?
2006-01-28T11:13:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	does ati.com have instructions on how to uninstall?
2006-01-28T11:14:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	no they dont have instructions on how to install i followed the wiki guide on drivers from ATI site
2006-01-28T11:14:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	but seen as those drivers dont work is it really a nessesity to unsintal them?
2006-01-28T11:14:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	next time, follow the ubuntu wiki site, and install ubuntu packages.  It'll be much less painfull.
2006-01-28T11:14:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	i can try :P
2006-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	Azunai	tritium	on my way :(
2006-01-28T12:01:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	that was likely not necessary
2006-01-28T12:03:00.000Z	tritium	Azunai	it likely could have been fixed without reinstall
