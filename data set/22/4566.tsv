2007-12-12T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	littlebear72	boot into your install and edit it from there

2007-12-12T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	littlebear72	ok - what happens when you boot your install, exactly what do you see
2007-12-12T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	littlebear72	ok, so it boots into the command line
2007-12-12T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	littlebear72	make a note of these commands

2008-01-07T16:29:00.000Z	littlebear72	ikonia	 i would have thought makign a upgrade that had no purpose would be silly upgradeing is good logic you get the best solutions to all life problems
2008-01-07T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	littlebear72	upgrades are not for no reason, but not always fixing the things you think
2008-01-07T17:25:00.000Z	ikonia	littlebear72	you've said that
