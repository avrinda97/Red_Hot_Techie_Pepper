2006-01-14T12:57:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	when it starts up first it has to get a couple of megs of material are you on dialup or dsl?

2006-01-14T12:58:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	on how big a machine?
2006-01-14T12:58:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	centrino 1.4GhZ, 256 ram
2006-01-14T13:00:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	it seems to me it is making too much of a load, any chance you could paste the output of /etc/apt/sources.list into http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-01-14T13:01:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	just a sec
2006-01-14T13:03:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6850
2006-01-14T13:03:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	looking at it give me a min
2006-01-14T13:04:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	I closed synaptic and re-opened it, it seems better now
2006-01-14T13:06:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	just a moment there are some things in there that you might consider changing
2006-01-14T13:06:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	before you do you should back that file up
2006-01-14T13:07:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	ok
2006-01-14T13:08:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	if I was you I would remove the reference to the cdrom at the top of the file - open up the two universe sec repos on the bottom
2006-01-14T13:08:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	ok, for security :)
2006-01-14T13:10:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	thanks, is it normal that openoffice is very slow startup?
2006-01-14T13:10:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	other things are you lack multiverse if you are true gnu you don't want them but if you do you should put it on the end of *only the first* line of universe half way up the file
2006-01-14T13:11:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	with those hardware specs yes, in fact it could be said that it is a dog at starting up but not bad at all once opened I have been editing a single doc here for the last few hours on and off as I review and recreate it and no issue and my box is of similar power to yours
2006-01-14T13:12:00.000Z	drcurl	ompaul	ok, thank you again :)
2006-01-14T13:13:00.000Z	ompaul	drcurl	when the edit is finished on the command line run this >> sudo apt-get update<<
