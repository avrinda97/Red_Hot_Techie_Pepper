2005-08-08T07:56:00.000Z	black13	nomasteryoda	yep that sounds right i am using squashfs mounted readonly file system
2005-08-08T07:57:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	black13	but it should not be writing to that folder anyway... '/var would be correct... like the post says...which should work via ramdrive
2005-08-08T07:59:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	black13	look at this post... might help http://tinyurl.com/8u7ot
2005-08-08T08:10:00.000Z	black13	nomasteryoda	so the genesis of the problem is that /usr is readonly and the tinyurl.com soluction is to create a symbolic link
