2009-02-19T10:10:00.000Z	Sw3RvE		Question - What is the command for the Home folder?
2009-02-19T10:10:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	cd
2009-02-19T10:11:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	or cd ~
2009-02-19T10:12:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	if what you are asking about is the path for your home folder youu should put /home/yourusername
2009-02-19T10:13:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	'cd' is the command you can type from a terminal to go to your home folder
2009-02-19T10:14:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	I just started reading the thread so I am not sure what you are trying to do
2009-02-19T10:15:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	what do you type from terminal?
2009-02-19T10:16:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	are you trying to do the same using a launch button on your panel?
2009-02-19T10:17:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	the Dock you refer about is an application, right?
2009-02-19T10:18:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	try to create a launch button and ask it to be run from terminal and see what you get
2009-02-19T10:19:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	yes. that's what you want, right?
2009-02-19T10:20:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	then check to select the launch button as 'run from terminal' in the type combo box
2009-02-19T10:20:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	I see
2009-02-19T10:21:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	go to a terminal window
2009-02-19T10:21:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	and run: apropos dock
2009-02-19T10:21:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	check if you see any command you would say it's your app
2009-02-19T10:23:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	then from your paste bin you should run command: cairo-dock
2009-02-19T10:24:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	on the launch button just add that command (no need to ask to be run from terminal)
2009-02-19T10:24:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	mmm. Did you try: man cairo-dock already?
2009-02-19T10:25:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	run on terminal:  man cairo-dock
2009-02-19T10:25:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	manual pages for the program
2009-02-19T10:26:00.000Z	cedriczg	Sw3RvE	then I think I can't help you as I have never used that application. Try to find out from the manual pages
