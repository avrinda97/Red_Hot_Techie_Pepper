2011-01-25T22:38:00.000Z	needlez	arcnewuss	realtek wifi cards should be detected by default usually, so what your saying is that they aren't working??

2011-01-25T22:41:00.000Z	needlez	arcnewuss	I have a simple solution for the time while your looking for it have you tried to install the winxp drivers thru ndiskgtk??
2011-01-25T22:42:00.000Z	needlez	arcnewuss	you could install ndiskgtk and install the drivers from the cd they would be in the winxp part of the cd and theyll be .inf files
2011-01-25T22:42:00.000Z	arcnewuss	needlez	no I have not
2011-01-25T22:43:00.000Z	needlez	arcnewuss	I'd try that for right now cuz google isnt helping me much to find anything about your card... is it on a laptop?? and if so what model of laptop / brand??

2011-01-25T22:44:00.000Z	needlez	arcnewuss	if both offer a native linux driver then how can you not get internet thru them??  strange, are you sure its not malfunctioning??
