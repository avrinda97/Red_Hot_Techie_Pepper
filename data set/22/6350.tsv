2009-09-20T08:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	WHat gfx card?
2009-09-20T08:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	What version of Ubuntu?
2009-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Did you say that you installed in safe graphics mode?
2009-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Then it is still in safe graphics mode, that is why you aren't getting full rez
2009-09-20T08:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	How comfortable are you with the terminal?
2009-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Ok, well you can try not using safe graphics mode by running "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-bak", but if it fails you will have to go to a terminal with ctrl+alt+f1 and restore the file with "sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf-bak /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2009-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Log out and log back in again
2009-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Good luck :)
2009-09-20T09:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Yes
2009-09-20T09:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Ok, can you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.1.log ?
2009-09-20T10:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	What do you mean by the "preference bar" ?
2009-09-20T10:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Chips_Handon	Right click the pannel > Add to panel > notification area ( if I understand your problem correctly )
