2008-07-22T05:15:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	yea, the ubuntu, er livecd
2008-07-22T05:15:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	that has clamav?
2008-07-22T05:16:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	you can install it once it's up and running
2008-07-22T05:16:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	i assume clamav is a linux irus scanner for windows viruses (virii?)
2008-07-22T05:17:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	yep.  Not sure what detection rates are these days; last I knew it was 50-60%
2008-07-22T05:17:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	Norton is only 85%
2008-07-22T05:17:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	well once you have the LiveCD running you can install clamav and run it from there
2008-07-22T05:18:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	you familiar with installation?
2008-07-22T05:18:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	quite, though I don't mess with windows much...  Is ntfs rw pretty easy to get going now in ubuntu?
2008-07-22T05:18:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	plugnplay
2008-07-22T05:19:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	i know a virus scanner thats got a 100% detection rate. it's called Windows
2008-07-22T05:19:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	right...  I can't believe people are still using that buggy os...
2008-07-22T05:20:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	so why do you have it installed?
2008-07-22T05:20:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	fixing two friends' computers that aren't brave enough to cross over to the light side
2008-07-22T05:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	one of them is Vista, which I have NEVER gotten farther into than looking in the start menu
2008-07-22T05:21:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	ah. you *could* put them a Windows theme on Ubuntu and see how long it takes for them to notice :P
2008-07-22T05:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	no, they have software that won't run.. They'd catch on
2008-07-22T05:21:00.000Z	KenBW3	craigbass1976	ive just had a week at someone else's vista PC - its not all that great
2008-07-22T05:22:00.000Z	craigbass1976	KenBW3	Thanks for info; I burned xubuntu the other day so I have a new cd; going to go use it
