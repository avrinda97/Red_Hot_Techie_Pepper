2008-10-26T06:46:00.000Z	ted_		hello, i had ubuntu 8.04 installed for quite a while now. I had to install windows for some school programs, so i decided to make use of some free hd space andmake a dual boot. however the windows install failed and brought back hd errors. then i booted back into ubuntu, was listening to some music, when rhythmbox crash. i tried to kill gdm, but that didnt work. so i rebooted, and when i logged in graphically again, it was pretty much frozen, and nothing
2008-10-26T06:46:00.000Z	ted_		 works...
2008-10-26T06:47:00.000Z	ted_		any ideas anyone, i removed eveything out of my home folder, yet that username still freezes
2008-10-26T06:47:00.000Z	ted_		so it wrecked my user isaac_ ?
2008-10-26T06:47:00.000Z	ted_		right
2008-10-26T06:47:00.000Z	ted_		i figured i could still install windows on the front of the partition, then just redo the boot loader
2008-10-26T06:48:00.000Z	ted_		any idea why that specific user would have massive processor usage on boot?
2008-10-26T06:50:00.000Z	ted_		oh and also, when i went into text mode, it reported a similar hd error that windows reported, which made me connect the two and think it is a hd problem..
2008-10-26T06:50:00.000Z	arrrghhh	ted_	it _will_ remove grub.  unless you have a separate hdd that you're installing windows to.
2008-10-26T06:51:00.000Z	ted_		so my ubuntu processor errors on boot, were due to something else other than a harddrive error that windows encountered?
2008-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	ted_		i am just trying to figure out now what was causing the processor to be 100% on boot, even after i removed everything from my home folder
2008-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	arrrghhh	ted_	top didn't give you any info?
2008-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	ted_		top?
2008-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	ted_		oh right, no
2008-10-26T06:53:00.000Z	arrrghhh	ted_	command line tool that shows cpu utilization of processes
2008-10-26T06:53:00.000Z	ted_		i ran that from the text interface, but nothing
2008-10-26T06:53:00.000Z	arrrghhh	ted_	nothing?
2008-10-26T06:53:00.000Z	ted_		then, i login to gui, it all goes crazy, i cant get back into text environment
2008-10-26T06:54:00.000Z	ted_		i guess i can go try to relogin to the bad user using text environment one more time
2008-10-26T06:54:00.000Z	ted_		brb then arrrghhh
2008-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	ted_	arrrghhh	nothing from top
2008-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	arrrghhh	ted_	nothing?  i usually have at least 90 things in top haha.
