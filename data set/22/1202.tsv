2010-08-25T20:08:00.000Z	Mamu		Hi all how to install windows on a linux system ?
2010-08-25T20:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 inside virtualbox or some other VM you mean?
2010-08-25T20:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 You got 2 hard drives? Or one hard drive?
2010-08-25T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 you need to have some unallocated space. or a NTFS partition for windows to install to. then boot the windows cd. and tell it to install there. You will need to restore teh GRUB bootloader afterwards, wimndows will erase it.
2010-08-25T20:11:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	already did but nothing happened when i inserted a windows disk
2010-08-25T20:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 then you need to see #windows if you cant get the windows cd/dvd to boot.
2010-08-25T20:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 if you have a windows 'recvovery' cd/dvd set that came with a PC. it may whipe out the hard drive.
2010-08-25T20:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 then your XP cd may be goofy/bad. try it in a different machine.
2010-08-25T20:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 you really should install windows first, then linux.
2010-08-25T20:16:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	Its a new without a single scratch
2010-08-25T20:16:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	I am not able to install windows , what i can do now ?
2010-08-25T20:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 no idea.  See #windows channel. or try booting the cd in virtualbox and use xp in vi5rtualbox.
2010-08-25T20:19:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	I have ubuntu 10.04 LTS as OS in my system so it is related !
2010-08-25T20:20:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	I dont know how to get rid of this problem , i want to use windows for playing games and Itunes
2010-08-25T20:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 format the hard drive.. so theres no linux.. see if windows will then install.. if not then its a hardware issue, or bios/drive issue its NOT technically ubuntu related.
2010-08-25T20:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 or totally delete all parttions so the HD is unallocated and try it then.
2010-08-25T20:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 has XP ever been On that machine befor? was it from that Xp disk>
2010-08-25T20:25:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	I formated with gparted , it dint worked !
2010-08-25T20:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 delete partitions so its 'unallcated' and see if it works. If it still dont work.. then its eitehr not booting the cd.. or the cd is crashing.
2010-08-25T20:28:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	I tried doing both it dint worked , and i have a low configuration pc so , i cant afford a virtualbox also :(
2010-08-25T20:29:00.000Z	Mamu	Dr_Willis	I booted Windows 7 , windows vista both none of them worked and how they can crash at the same time?
2010-08-25T20:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Mamu	 sounds like the drive dosent like your windows cds.
