2007-06-17T09:42:00.000Z	nuked_omen	kazim59	mount -o loop file.iso
2007-06-17T09:42:00.000Z	kazim59	nuked_omen	mount -o loop file.iso (no target required?)
2007-06-17T09:43:00.000Z	nuked_omen	kazim59	mount -o loop filel.iso /media/targer
2007-06-17T09:43:00.000Z	nuked_omen	kazim59	don't be stupid and use file.iso as your file and /media/targer as your target
2007-06-17T09:43:00.000Z	kazim59	nuked_omen	thanks
2007-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	kazim59	nuked_omen	then how do I play it using mplayer?
2007-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	nuked_omen	kazim59	play what?
2007-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	kazim59	nuked_omen	the ISO is a dvd ....
2007-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	kazim59	nuked_omen	a movie dvd....
2007-06-17T09:45:00.000Z	nuked_omen	kazim59	what i would do is cd to the movies directory and issue mplayer file.vob
2007-06-17T09:45:00.000Z	nuked_omen	kazim59	i think vlc can handle dvds better, but i still prefer mplayer
