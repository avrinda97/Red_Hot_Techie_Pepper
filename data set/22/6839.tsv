2006-11-12T09:44:00.000Z	timbobsteve		hi all... I am trying to install packages from my Ubuntu 6.06 cd... but apt-get insists on downloading all the packages from the net... this is a pain, because my internet is slow... how do i force it to use the packages on the CD and not re-download them?
2006-11-12T09:45:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	Order your sources in /etc/apt/sources.lst with cd-rom enabled and uncommented on top.
2006-11-12T09:46:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	i have done that and also ran an apt-get update, but it still insists on download all the files from the net.... I am trying to install ubuntu-desktop metapackage, which I KNOW is on the Ubuntu cd
2006-11-12T09:46:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	Well it goes with the newest copy.
2006-11-12T09:47:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	It could be that the cd is outdated. In which case you could install off the cd and at your next apt-get upgrade you'd have to download the whole thing again anyway.
2006-11-12T09:47:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	i have recently ran an apt-get upgrade on my system... hmmmm... so how do I force it to install the older versions ?
2006-11-12T09:47:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	If you don't care about security patches or being up-to-date just comment out all the online repositories.
2006-11-12T09:48:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	 OK.. will try that
2006-11-12T09:49:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	commenting out all the online sources and doing an apt update didn't work... it still wants the online versions :/
2006-11-12T09:50:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	apt-get clean
2006-11-12T09:50:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	apt-get update
2006-11-12T09:50:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	Then try.
2006-11-12T09:50:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	ahhhh ok.. will try that. thx
2006-11-12T09:51:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	 `apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`..... it is now saying that the package is not available... I have the cd inserted and everything : /
2006-11-12T09:52:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	are you sure the cd isn't commented out?
2006-11-12T09:53:00.000Z	baxter_kylie		keithhhhhh: !transcode
2006-11-12T09:53:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	 I am sure.... ok.. after all those commands I did an apt-cache search for ubuntu-desktop..... it turns out that meta-package isn't on the 6.06 CD.... funny though... I thought it would have been.... looks like I will have to bite the bullet...
2006-11-12T09:54:00.000Z	baxter_kylie		keithhhh: Yes. There's also mencoder.
2006-11-12T09:54:00.000Z	baxter_kylie		keithhhh: But transcode has several guis that are very nice.
2006-11-12T09:54:00.000Z	baxter_kylie		timbobsteve:
2006-11-12T09:54:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	timbobsteve	Ahh.
2006-11-12T09:55:00.000Z	timbobsteve	baxter_kylie	 thanks for the help.
