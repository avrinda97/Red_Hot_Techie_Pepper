2005-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	_troy		linux journal or linux magazine (uk) did a review of financial apps several months ago
2005-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	_troy		with a slant toward business
2005-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	_troy		you could prob find an online archive of that article
2005-04-28T06:38:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 Know of any quickbooks alternatives with an API and the ability to import quickbooks data?
2005-04-28T06:39:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	I am looking for the article, I usually keep that stuff around, not sure right off about the QB import
2005-04-28T06:40:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 Been thinking about switching the workplace to linux, it's getting larger and we'll save on the microsoft tax in the long run
2005-04-28T06:41:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	that 'tax' can be a very good incentive :)
2005-04-28T06:41:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	Indeed.  It'd be nice to have a quickbooks alternative as well, don't really want to run it under 98 in qemu
2005-04-28T06:43:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	This article I am thinking of did compare against quickbooks I believe
2005-04-28T06:43:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 It would totally rock if you could find it :D
2005-04-28T06:51:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	still looking
2005-04-28T06:51:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 If it's too much of a request don't worry about it
2005-04-28T06:55:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	no trouble at all, I am just not as organized as I would like to be
2005-04-28T07:01:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	I found some reviews @ Linux Journal, but they are too old, the one I read was in 2004
2005-04-28T07:03:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 Oh well
2005-04-28T07:03:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 You don't remember the magazine name, do you?
2005-04-28T07:04:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	bah, I just can't find it.  I think they reviewed gnucash, maybe moneydance and several others
2005-04-28T07:04:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	has to be Linux Magazine (linux-magazine.com) or Linux Journal, only 2 I get
2005-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	but the slant was toward business, talked about quickbooks, was perfect for what you need
2005-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 I'll dig around for some guides.  I may also experiment with qemu.
2005-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	_troy	SeamusLP	ok, sorry I couldn't find it, luck
2005-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	SeamusLP	_troy	 No prob man, thanks for giving it a shot
