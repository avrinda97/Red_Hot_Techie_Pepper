2005-02-04T06:20:00.000Z	nevyn		and you want mjpeg/raw if you want complete control over encoding
2005-02-04T06:22:00.000Z	nevyn		the backend CAN be somewhere else.
2005-02-04T06:22:00.000Z	nevyn		ie. basement machine room. under stairs.
2005-02-04T06:22:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	that adds cost though
2005-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	in globbing.
2005-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	I know, this is in a shell glob
2005-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	I wonder if psh will combine them
2005-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	define "usable" please
2005-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	DACLS are good. really. unix permissions suck and acls on linux are a pain in the ass.
2005-02-04T07:01:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	what's wrong with *nix perms?
2005-02-04T07:01:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	they're inflexible.
2005-02-04T07:01:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	name one thing you can't do with them?
2005-02-04T07:02:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	how can I have a group of writers who can create documents editors that can change documents but not create documents and plebs who can't do anything
2005-02-04T07:03:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	NT's DACLS are much much better than unix permissions. really
2005-02-04T07:04:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	ok, I see how that works, thanks
2005-02-04T07:05:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	don't get me wrong linux rocks but it has deficiencies and ignoring them doesn't make them go away.
2005-02-04T07:07:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	would you trust gpg if it had a ncurses interface?
2005-02-04T07:08:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	I know it's irrassional. but I don't trust ggpg or whatever it is.
2005-02-04T07:09:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	btw, I agree with you, gui apps are larger (in code size) and easier to find exploits for
2005-02-04T07:10:00.000Z	dseomn	nevyn	it's (theoretically) possible that somebody would make an encrypted file that when decrypted would cause a buf overflow and email your decrypted sec key
2005-02-04T07:11:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	that'd be a neat exploit
2005-02-04T07:14:00.000Z	nevyn	dseomn	I do use the mutt integration and storage of passphase tho.
