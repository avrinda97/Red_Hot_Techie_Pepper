2010-09-15T08:22:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	You want to replace Windows on your netbook with Ubuntu, but lack an optical/USB drive to run the installer?
2010-09-15T08:25:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Would you mind restating your issue?
2010-09-15T08:25:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Was I wrong?
2010-09-15T08:29:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Can you burn a disc on the Windows machine and boot from that on it?
2010-09-15T08:30:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Am I missing something, or couldn't you just burn a CD/DVD, start up from it with the Windows machine, select Install, then when Ubuntu asks where to go, point it to the USB-connected SSD?
2010-09-15T08:30:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Actually, just boot from the SSD in the Windows machine
2010-09-15T08:31:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Considering my history with trying to install Linux on external drives, I'd probably yank my internal ;)
2010-09-15T08:32:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Nah, I just mean I had the installer randomly decide in the past that it'd go ahead and install on my internal drive even after I'd said to install on an external.
2010-09-15T08:34:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	It isn't Windows, so it should be fine with an external drive for install ;)
2010-09-15T08:37:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Sudo would mean a system would need to be installed already, as sudo basically says "I am the master user, don't even think about pulling that permissions crap with me", and seeing as you haven't got anything for it to be bothered about permissions about yet since the disk is blank, it should be fine.
2010-09-15T08:39:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	Good luck, ensure you read the instructions carefully.
2010-09-15T08:39:00.000Z	julian-	Ivanrad	If you just want Linux on it, just tell it to use the whole disk and let it sort it out.
