2010-09-29T22:51:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	if you configured your network with network manager, you need to make sure to check the box to make it available to all users, or it won't let you connect until you log into your desktop
2010-09-29T22:52:00.000Z	Braber01	trism	thank you I'm off to copy your text and e-mail it to my self
2011-01-07T06:57:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	you get kanji by hitting space after typing some hiragana, I don't know why you can't select katakana
2011-01-07T06:57:00.000Z	Braber01	trism	I've tried hitting space, and nothing has changed.
2011-01-07T07:01:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	you need to type „ÅØ
2011-01-07T07:04:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	I've never used the netbook edition, couldn't say.
2011-01-07T07:07:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	you should be able to just select latin/hiragana/katakana from the floating language bar, or configure hotkeys with /usr/lib/ibus-anthy/ibus-setup-anthy
2011-01-07T07:13:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	that could be your problem, I don't use the m17n anthy
2011-01-07T07:14:00.000Z	Braber01	trism	the regular anthy wan't an option for me...
2011-01-07T07:14:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	did you install the Japanese input methods in System/Administration/Language Support?
2011-01-07T07:15:00.000Z	Braber01	trism	no i did not could you walk me through that in a PM please?
2011-01-07T07:17:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	it is really simple, just run System/Administration/Language Support, click Install/Remove Languages, scroll down to Japanese, and check all the boxes (Translations, Input Methods, Extra Fonts), and click apply
2011-01-07T07:17:00.000Z	Braber01	trism	thank you now the thins isn't responding, I wasted to much time playing final fantasy, Tatics Advanced today :(
2011-01-07T07:18:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	after that in System/Preferences/Ibus Preferences, on the Input Method tab, there should be a new Anthy option with a crown next to it
2011-01-07T07:21:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	if it really isn't responding, you might just need to: sudo apt-get install ibus-anthy, the m17n anthy is probably part of ibus-m17n
2011-01-07T07:23:00.000Z	Braber01	trism	how can I install the japan language support stuff from the command line?
2011-01-07T07:25:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	the command line program: check-language-support -l ja; will show you the packages you still need to install, and you can sudo apt-get install them
2011-01-07T07:26:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	mostly you should just need language-support-input-ja or just ibus-anthy
2011-01-07T07:26:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	but having the fonts and translations are useful too
2011-03-17T05:51:00.000Z	trism	Braber01	apt-cache search anagram, there are several, although the an package seems to do what you want, something like: an -w -m 7 asdxidk;
