2012-01-16T18:41:00.000Z	LABcrab		Hello people!  What is the easiest way to convert VCR to digital on Ubuntu?
2012-01-16T18:42:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	hire someone else to do it
2012-02-01T08:05:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	does the 4gb stick work when you install it by itself?
2012-02-01T08:06:00.000Z	LABcrab	pfifo	Don't feel like trying.
2012-02-01T08:06:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	well i can tell you for sure, your not allowed to mix memory like that
2012-02-01T08:07:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	dual channel memory doesnt work that way
2012-02-01T08:07:00.000Z	LABcrab	pfifo	So i have to put 8 GB and that's it?  What do i do with the 2 GB + 2 GB that comes with the laptop?
2012-02-01T08:07:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	the memory needs to be the same, 2, 2+2, 4, 4+4
2012-02-01T08:08:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	its also possible your board doesnt support 4gb sticks, and the most you can have is 2+2
2012-02-01T08:08:00.000Z	LABcrab	pfifo	but that's not fair, another computer has 1 GB + Â½ GB of RAM DDR1.
2012-02-01T08:08:00.000Z	LABcrab	pfifo	Up to 8GB according to Crucial.
2012-02-01T08:09:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	that was before dual channel architectures
2012-02-01T08:09:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	not reall, use only the 4 stick for now
2012-02-01T08:09:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	twice as fast
2012-02-01T08:10:00.000Z	LABcrab	pfifo	Then i'm not ahead compared to 2 GB + 2 GB i had before!
2012-02-01T08:10:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	the 2+2 will be faster then the 4 alone
2012-02-01T08:10:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	but you should still test the 4 works all by itself
2012-02-01T08:14:00.000Z	LABcrab	pfifo	It's brand new and sealed from the store!  Unlikely it won't work.  What do i do with the 2 GB and 2 GB i have left?  Other computers with DDR2 won't take them!  Darn, who makes RAM like this?
2012-02-01T08:15:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	I suggest you mail the 2 2GB to me.
2012-02-01T08:15:00.000Z	LABcrab	pfifo	As a donation?
2012-02-01T08:17:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	also, intel made memory like this
2012-02-01T08:18:00.000Z	pfifo	LABcrab	I would keep the sticks, you might obtain a craptastic used box in the future that could use them
