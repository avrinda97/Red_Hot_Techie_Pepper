2010-12-22T17:14:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	you've got to give more info. pls paste error messages or else in a pastie.
2010-12-22T17:17:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	please note that the [enter] key is not a replacement for a fullstop. Nor for a space :)
2010-12-22T17:18:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	where do you see these errors? Just after the BIOS, or after Ubuntu loaded already?
2010-12-22T17:19:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	Did you meddle with grub or startup? Did you (re)install Windows /after/ ubuntu?
2010-12-22T17:20:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	things like this don't "just happen" something must have gone amiss. We should try to figure out what. Your error messages are giving me no lead.
2010-12-22T17:21:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	could it be a broken Harddisk? Do you have some HD inspection tool in your BIOS?
2010-12-22T17:22:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	new programs can cause trouble, yes. Some programs are designed to change the login (like Ubuntu Tweak) so installing them, and playing with them could cause trouble, yes.
2010-12-22T17:24:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	no, if it happens before boot, probably not. There is no graphics server running by then.
2010-12-22T17:25:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	have you tried to log in with failsafe?
2010-12-22T17:26:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	and no. If you don't (re)format the drives during installation, ubuntu will be "repaired" rather then overwritten entirely
2010-12-22T17:27:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	Maybe someone else in this chan knows how to change GRUB so that it shows all the startup options, instead of autoloading the default.
2010-12-22T17:27:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	one of these options is a resqueu failsafe modus.
2010-12-22T17:27:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	that is right. Again, provided you choose the correct options during install/repair :)
2010-12-22T17:29:00.000Z	berkes	stuckonmychair	see scarlson answers about grub just above here too.
