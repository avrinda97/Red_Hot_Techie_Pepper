2010-04-24T15:38:00.000Z	micka	Dr_Willis	 =>  conflicting packages - not installing flashplugin-installer
2010-04-24T15:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 perhaps pastebin the whole erro/commands you are using - and give the url to the channel so everyone can see it.
2010-04-24T15:39:00.000Z	micka	Dr_Willis	 => http://paste.ubuntu.com/421596/
2010-04-24T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 so looking at the error messages -->
2010-04-24T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 seems you have it installed allready.. you could ry removing         adobe-flashplugin    I guess.

2010-04-24T15:42:00.000Z	micka	Dr_Willis	i don't have adobe-flashplugin (_(
2010-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 no idea - not sure how you got it all goofed up.  I install ubuntu-restricted-extras and that grabs it for me normally
2010-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 perhaps pthers may be able to help
2010-04-24T15:45:00.000Z	micka	Dr_Willis	i used that sudo dpkg --purge --force-remove-reinstreq adobe-flashplugin    and now it's working
2010-04-24T15:47:00.000Z	micka	Dr_Willis	do you know where i can find the last version of flash because it's seems that mine is a little bit old : adobe-flashplugin_10.0.45.2.orig.tar.gz
2010-04-24T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 let the package manager handle flash and the updates. dont try to install the latest from adobe.
2010-04-24T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 you are just asking to break things worse. :)
2010-04-24T15:49:00.000Z	micka	Dr_Willis	deezer tell me that my version is not the last one and it needs the last one (_(
2010-04-24T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	  .so is liek a .lib file in windows. you dont run it
2010-04-24T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	micka	 is flash working now? if so - i would leave it a lone.
2010-04-24T15:57:00.000Z	micka	Dr_Willis	 i see thx
