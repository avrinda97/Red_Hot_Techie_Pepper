2008-07-07T05:59:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	you run the LiveCD and install Ubuntu in the normal way; when it asks you how you want to format your disk, select Use Entire Disk
2008-07-07T06:00:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	why do you want to do that?
2008-07-07T06:01:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	well, you can't reformat without losing your data
2008-07-07T06:01:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	so if you want to keep your data, you'll have to use Wubi
2008-07-07T06:02:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	In that case, just use the disc your friend gave you. Put it in the drive, restart your computer, start the installer, and when it asks you how to partition, select Use Entire Disk.
2008-07-07T06:03:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	Well, that's what your problem is then... for future reference, that's what you should have told us from the beginning
2008-07-07T06:04:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	If nobody responds to your question, it's because nobody knows the answer
2008-07-07T06:04:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	try the forums instead
2008-07-07T06:04:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	http://ubuntuforums.org
2008-07-07T06:05:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	on the forums your post stays at the front page for a while and has a greater opportunity for knowing eyeballs to run across it
2008-07-07T06:08:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	the problem seems to be with your partition table, not with Windows.
2008-07-07T06:09:00.000Z	LogicalDash	TruJasper	if you really installed Ubuntu the way we've been telling you, then you don't actually HAVE Windows on your computer anymore.
