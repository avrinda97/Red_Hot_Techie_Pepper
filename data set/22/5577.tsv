2007-04-11T06:45:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		I have serious problems with my USB.
2007-04-11T06:45:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Even as Sudo, I cannot use any files.
2007-04-11T06:46:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Nothing at all works with my USB, and some files on it I need.
2007-04-11T06:48:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	are you using a USB hub?
2007-04-11T06:48:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	bobdufour	The usb is directly connected to usb 2.0
2007-04-11T06:48:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	bobdufour	Not a hub.
2007-04-11T06:49:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	hmm.. I just thought you might have the problem I had...
2007-04-11T06:51:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	I think ntfs cannot be written to
2007-04-11T06:51:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	fat32 should work flawlessly
2007-04-11T06:52:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	can you ls /dev
2007-04-11T06:52:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	can you "ls /dev|grep sd"
2007-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	so basically, you have access to the drive but can't write?
2007-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	does it get mounted automatically when you plug in the usb? Does it have an entry in /etc/fstab?
2007-04-11T06:56:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	the files are ok... What is the fstab entry?
2007-04-11T06:59:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	"cat /etc/fstab|grep *path to drive*"
2007-04-11T06:59:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	sub-in *path to drive*
2007-04-11T07:00:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	so it gets automatically mounted by your system, can you give me the path, Ill try to make you a mount command
2007-04-11T07:01:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	also do you have an idea of the device? is it the only usb device plugged in? then it should be sda
2007-04-11T07:03:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	maybe its just corrupted then... Or locked? Is it a mp3 player on hold?
2007-04-11T07:06:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	if you are SURE its not physically locked (hold button or lock pin) try "sudo umount /path/to/it" and then "sudo mount /path/toit -w"
2007-04-11T07:11:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	then "sudo mount /dev/sda1 /path/toit -w"
2007-04-11T07:16:00.000Z	bobdufour	superkirbyartist	does it work?
