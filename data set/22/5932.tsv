2007-01-18T16:50:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 What are you entering your WEP key into?
2007-01-18T16:50:00.000Z	age6racer	shades66	wifi-radar (it used to work fine with WEP)
2007-01-18T16:51:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	:  i've not used that. I found the networkmanager applet the easiest to use and it allows me to hot swap between wireless and wired networks automatically
2007-01-18T16:56:00.000Z	age6racer	shades66	how do I run it once it's installed?
2007-01-18T16:57:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 you might need to restart gnome as it appears in the icon bar next to the clock
2007-01-19T17:05:00.000Z	age6racer	shades66	its doing the same thing with networkmanager as it did with wifi-radar. Just keeps trying til it times out
2007-01-19T17:06:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	are you using the "create new wireless network" option?
2007-01-19T17:08:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	:  try the "create new wireless network" option and select the type of wep key you are using
2007-01-19T17:16:00.000Z	age6racer	shades66	nope still no luck
2007-01-19T17:16:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 :(     is there anything at the end of the output from the dmesg command?
2007-01-19T17:18:00.000Z	age6racer	shades66	you mean something like 'ndiswrapper (iw_set_freq:376): setting configuration failed (00010003)
2007-01-19T17:22:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 Not sure what the means.  Googling finds "http://home.telkomsa.net/richm/hp-nx6125.html"  which suggests that ndiswrapper needed updating. Might be worth trying if you are ok with compiling and installing programs
2007-01-19T17:23:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 You said that it worked before.  Have you upgraded from a previous ubuntu?
2007-01-19T17:27:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	i couldn't get ndiswrapper working properly with mine (Broadcom Corporation BCM4318) and ended up using the bcm43xx module
2007-01-19T17:31:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 the kernel module bcm43xx which in turn loads the firmware
2007-01-19T17:32:00.000Z	age6racer	shades66	ok. so is there a howto somewhere for me to run through to get that working?
2007-01-19T17:34:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	:  try   http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1071920&mode=linear    I think that is what I used
2007-01-19T17:35:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 no problem.  good luck !
2007-01-19T17:35:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 oh :(
2007-01-19T17:36:00.000Z	age6racer	shades66	  :(   indeed
2007-01-19T17:37:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	 What about https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
2007-01-19T17:38:00.000Z	shades66	age6racer	i don't blame you for not wanting to re-install. I know it took a while to get mine working and then after playing around it just suddenly started working. Haven't dared changing anything incase i break it :(
