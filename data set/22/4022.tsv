2008-04-08T05:50:00.000Z	Pelo	jcgrv06	check the syntax
2008-04-08T05:51:00.000Z	Pelo	jcgrv06	can you pastebin your xorg.conf file so I can have a look ?

2008-04-08T05:56:00.000Z	Pelo	jcgrv06	hold on , let me have a look
2008-04-08T05:57:00.000Z	Pelo	jcgrv06	so , just add  1024x768 to the list
2008-04-08T05:57:00.000Z	jcgrv06	Pelo	It's there: Modes  "1024x768" "800x600"
2008-04-08T05:59:00.000Z	Pelo	jcgrv06	sorry I got confused I thogut you mentions 1280x1024 earlier,   and it doesn't show up in your  screen resolution applet ? weird,  try this,    in the terminal   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ,   reselect your video card, answer all questions as best you can and when in any doudt , use the default provided ,
2008-04-08T06:04:00.000Z	jcgrv06	Pelo	how do you restart X?
2008-04-08T06:04:00.000Z	Pelo	jcgrv06	ctrl alt backspace
2008-04-08T06:08:00.000Z	jcgrv06	Pelo	thanks, I tried but didn't work. I had tried in the past, but I gave it another try. Still 800x600.
2008-04-08T06:08:00.000Z	Pelo	jcgrv06	maybe try asking in #xubuntu , they might know better, or also check in the forum www.ubuntuforums.org
2008-04-08T06:09:00.000Z	jcgrv06	Pelo	Thanks
