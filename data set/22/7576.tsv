2006-03-10T06:52:00.000Z	ph1qt10n		is there some command for removing a certain program completely?
2006-03-10T06:53:00.000Z	Healot	ph1qt10n	you need to remove kdm (the KDE login stuff)

2006-03-10T06:54:00.000Z	Healot		or use synaptic
2006-03-10T06:55:00.000Z	Healot		sudo password root at the first login, boys
2006-03-10T06:55:00.000Z	Healot		or was it "passwd", hehe
2006-03-10T06:56:00.000Z	ph1qt10n		if i removed kubuntu-desktop, why am i still able to enter KDE ? WTF
2006-03-10T06:56:00.000Z	Healot		there is "nerolinux"
2006-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	Healot		well, you need the nero license first, or do i have to own one, hell no
2006-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	Healot	ph1qt10n	it's the login manager, it's not true KDE, the desktop manager
