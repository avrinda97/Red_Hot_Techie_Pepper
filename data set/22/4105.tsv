2008-03-31T01:45:00.000Z	mDemocritus		i'm having issues with a supposedly usb mass storage class device not persisting in /dev... the dmesg logs show detection and assignment to /dev/sdb 1 and 2, but when i try to mount it, cat it, or fdisk it, /dev/sdb doesn't exist... it assumes write through for drive caching, i have a feeling that has something to do with it... i've tried this with ubuntustudio and knoppix on x86, as well as xubuntu dapper on ppc with the same issues
2008-03-31T01:45:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	mount /dev/sdb1 ?
2008-03-31T01:46:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	and dmesg should say somehing if it lost device
2008-03-31T01:46:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	i would love if it was that simple
2008-03-31T01:47:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	any time i cat, fdisk, or mount /dev/sda1 or 2, i get device does not exist
2008-03-31T01:48:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	that is, /dev/sdb
2008-03-31T01:48:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	what does dmesg say? you could also try mount that usb by-uuid from /dev/disk/by-uuid/ or from /dev/disk/by-path/

2008-03-31T01:49:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	^ dmesg
2008-03-31T01:50:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	so reconnecting dosent work ?
2008-03-31T01:51:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	no[e
2008-03-31T01:51:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	nope*
2008-03-31T01:51:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	before comment i dont see anyreason why it wouldnt work, but after trying to reconnect driver could be in somekind problem
2008-03-31T01:52:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	can you rephrase that? i'm a bit confused
2008-03-31T01:52:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	what it says after coonecting and trying to mount
2008-03-31T01:52:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	nothing... when i try to mount it just says device doesn't exist
2008-03-31T01:53:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	then i have noide
2008-03-31T01:54:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	rats... this stupid issue has been bugging me for like 2 weeks now... and i really want it to work.... that multitracker is really cool....
2008-03-31T01:56:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	usb is annoying sometimes. i dont see anything in that paste what would make it broken before line 25 ... after that reason is clear, but i think that isnt problem now
2008-03-31T01:57:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	exactly... the most aggrivating part is that it works fine on windows, and other usb drives work fine on ubuntu
2008-03-31T01:58:00.000Z	simplexio	mDemocritus	have googled known problems with that usbdrive name ?
2008-03-31T01:59:00.000Z	mDemocritus	simplexio	hah i can't find a darn thing about it with linux... it's a zoom hd16 multitracker
