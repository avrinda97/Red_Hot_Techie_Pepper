2011-11-06T12:42:00.000Z	skilz		Hey how do I change the login screen theme?
2011-11-06T12:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	personal amendment to skilz's question above - can you theme lightdm?
2011-11-20T08:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	see if ubuntu has some OSS compatibility package(s) of some sort - for instance debian has oss-compat
2011-11-20T08:42:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	oss-compat is already installed
2011-11-20T08:44:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	What im trying to do is get 'tpb' (Thinkpad Buttons) to work on my IBM Thinkpad to use the special volume keys, I have tpb working but the volume keys don't change the volume, I need it to control PCM somehow. Please take a look at http://www.nongnu.org/tpb/doc/tpb.1.html
2011-11-20T08:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	i have no idea man - good luck.
2011-11-20T08:45:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	I usually use alsamixer to change the volume but I think my system is using pulseaudio.
2011-11-20T08:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	alsamixer should still work i believe
2011-11-20T08:45:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	Yeah it does, but I think tpb is trying to control oss not pulseaudio or alsa
2011-11-20T08:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	if tpb is trying to control OSS - it's WAY outdated.  Good luck.
2011-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	Yeah it is
2011-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	When I load tpb its loaded with -m off default but the volume does not change
2011-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	i'm sorry i've never used tpb before - i'm no help to you.  good luck.
2011-11-20T10:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	if you plan on upgrading to the next ubuntu release, i'd recommend you just leave them
2011-11-20T10:08:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	No I wont be.
2011-11-20T10:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	then try to carefully remove them, but you'll run into meta-package issues almost for sure
2011-11-20T10:09:00.000Z	skilz	zykotick9	Theres not a lot of glib apps I run so should be okay
2011-11-20T10:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	i just mean it's going to remove the ubuntu-desktop meta-package and probably a HUGE list of applications, you could just reinstall what you need after though.
2012-02-08T16:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	the newest GDM doesn't support the old themes.  It's very difficult to install themes now, there are a few tools that allow a handful of themes to be installed, ubuntu-tweak (unsupported) does i believe
2012-02-08T16:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	by sdm do you mean slim?  you could try...
2012-02-08T16:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	re:old GDM, forget about it - it's long gone (it was pre 10.04LTS)
2012-02-08T16:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	skilz	changing the background image is possible even with the new GDM (that's not really a theme)
