2007-04-08T07:06:00.000Z	tbuss		how to I fix a "X server failed to load" I'm not sure as to what I need to configure in xorg.conf to fix this
2007-04-08T07:08:00.000Z	tbuss		can anyone help with booting into ubuntu, everytime I try it says x server failed to load, how can I fix this?
2007-04-08T07:08:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	?? with the live CD
2007-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	aaah sound like something broke
2007-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	FF didn't actually crash, I forced a quit on it and tried to restart the system
2007-04-08T07:11:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	type  after the login  dkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-04-08T07:12:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	actually  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-04-08T07:12:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	okay, I'll need to switch to that pc, what should I do after that
2007-04-08T07:12:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	sorry did a typo
2007-04-08T07:12:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	it will try and reconfigure the X server for you, you just answer the questions
2007-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	ok, I'll give it a shot....Thank you
2007-04-08T07:25:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	it did not work. The last option was color depth, I chose 24 and it put me back at the prompt, do I just restart or do I need to overwrite the existing xorg.conf somehow
2007-04-08T07:26:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	choose something lower you can change it later
2007-04-08T07:27:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	ok, what about after I choose the color depth, do I restart gdm or just restart the system
2007-04-08T07:27:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	just run startx
2007-04-08T07:37:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	could you take a look please http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14570/
2007-04-08T07:38:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf  file change Driver nvidia   line to Driver  nv
2007-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	when I reconfigured I selected nv, is this different
2007-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	tbuss	nv is the built in nvidia driver
2007-04-08T07:44:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	i looked in the xorg.conf, nv is already there for Driver
2007-04-08T07:46:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	I'm new to linix, what would cause me to loose this window environment,  I haven't made any changes. I just restarted my system and it was gone
2007-04-08T07:48:00.000Z	tbuss	Linux_Galore	I might have the terminology wrong, I thought the x server was what window environments ran under
