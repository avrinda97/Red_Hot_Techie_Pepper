2007-11-23T03:40:00.000Z	sayanora1818181		Hello?
2007-11-23T03:40:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Do you want 1200 people to say hello to you? Hello.
2007-11-23T03:42:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Looks good to me. You're creating a swap, a root partition and a home partition, and leaving your other two NTFS drives intact.
2007-11-23T03:42:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	And kudos for using a home partition. Everyone - look at sayanora1818181's setup. ;)
2007-11-23T03:43:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Won't make a difference.
2007-11-23T03:43:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	That's a lot of space. You have 1750 MB!
2007-11-23T03:45:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Your programs go into /. Your data and your config settings go into /home. Don't be too cheap on /
2007-11-23T03:45:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	40 GB is perfect.
2007-11-23T03:46:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	I just checked and I have 150 gb for /. And 45 used. So, yeah, go a little bigger. Maybe 100.
2007-11-23T03:46:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	It's a pita if you run out.
2007-11-23T03:46:00.000Z	sayanora1818181	bradv	how does 200GB sound?
2007-11-23T03:48:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	If you can afford it do it. I can buy 500GB for $100, so it makes sense to me. Running out of space on / is a pain in the rear.
2007-11-23T03:49:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Also, you may want to increase your swap to 2 GB.
2007-11-23T04:00:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	I think 150GB is perfect. The reason I like having a large / partition is so that I can later split it and install a separate OS (like the next version of Ubuntu), while keeping the same /home partition. Merging / and /home will deprive you of that option. Plus, as of gutsy you can move and resize ext3 partitions so you can change it later.
2007-11-23T04:01:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	It will install to your / partition.
2007-11-23T04:02:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Yes. Your setup is good.
2007-11-23T04:04:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Yes.
2007-11-23T04:05:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Post a picture.

2007-11-23T04:06:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Password?
2007-11-23T04:07:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	Yeah, but not without hacking the passwd file. Not recommended.
2007-11-23T04:07:00.000Z	bradv	sayanora1818181	You can set up autologin however.
