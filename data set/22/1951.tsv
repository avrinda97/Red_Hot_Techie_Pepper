2009-12-03T00:25:00.000Z	freewillie		Ive a little question, how do I rename a file with an unknow character
2009-12-03T00:27:00.000Z	freewillie		!rename
2009-12-03T00:27:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	I'm confused why the character is unknown, do you just not know how to type it?
2009-12-03T00:28:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	It is just an e with dubble dots on top of it?
2009-12-03T00:28:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	Sorry for the question mark
2009-12-03T00:32:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	you can use tab completion on the terminal to finish typing the filename for something. Just start typing the file, press tab and then the rest of it should show up.  Then you can do something like: mv youroldfilename yournewfilename
2009-12-03T00:33:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	ulb: Thanks it worked
2010-01-26T22:03:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	How did you install it?
2010-01-26T22:04:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	I downloaded the rpm because the pckage wasn in the repos and converted it with alien to an deb and then installed it with dpkg -i
2010-01-26T22:05:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	And when you do dpkg -r you get errors?
2010-01-26T22:05:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	dpkg: fout bij afhandelen van hotwayd (--remove):  subproces installed post-removal script gaf een foutwaarde 1 terug Fouten gevonden tijdens behandelen van:  hotwayd
2010-01-26T22:06:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	It is dutch
2010-01-26T22:06:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	Can i fast change the terminal language so you understand?
2010-01-26T22:06:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	You're out of luck.  We do not support using alien to install packages, you could trying using --force but you may still need to clean it up manually.
2010-01-26T22:07:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	ok how?
2010-01-26T22:07:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	dpkg --force -r hotwayd
2010-01-26T22:09:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	dpkg dont like that command
2010-01-26T22:11:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	dpkg --force-all -r yourpackage.  This may not work though and I really don't like suggesting it as it could break your system.
2010-01-26T22:12:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	It wont work, how do i remove it manualy?
2010-01-26T22:13:00.000Z	Pici	freewillie	dpkg -L yourpackagename   and look for and remove the files manually, but you're on your own if you do that.  This is why we do not support installing packages created by alien.
2010-01-26T22:14:00.000Z	freewillie	Pici	Ok, Thanks.
