2006-06-03T16:51:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	both computers have ubuntu?
2006-06-03T16:52:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	the printer is on windows, I have ubuntu here
2006-06-03T16:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	is the printer shared?
2006-06-03T16:52:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	I've been trying for a few days to get it working
2006-06-03T16:52:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	yeah. It works fine from other windows computers
2006-06-03T16:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	and you know the UNC? \\compName\printShareName
2006-06-03T16:53:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	yep
2006-06-03T16:53:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	the problem doesn't lie in my configurations I guess
2006-06-03T16:53:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	let me show you the error
2006-06-03T16:55:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	first of all, there is this error "E [02/Jun/2006:23:58:58 +0300]  cupsdAuthorize: Local authentication certificate not found!", which has been submitted as a bug.
2006-06-03T16:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	not a bug, a feature, you did not add a trust account of a sort.
2006-06-03T16:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	let me find a reference
2006-06-03T16:55:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	then there is this error, E [02/Jun/2006:23:52:40 +0300]  [Job 12]  /ioerror in --.outputpage--
2006-06-03T05:01:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	any clue?
2006-06-03T05:01:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	read my last message to you
2006-06-03T05:02:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	ah, still searching for a reference?
2006-06-03T05:03:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	ya, one sec
2006-06-03T05:06:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba on the bottom
2006-06-03T05:07:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	not a great solution, though. give me more time.
2006-06-03T05:15:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	you choose the add samba printer option in the add printer dialogue;/
2006-06-03T05:18:00.000Z	Nepton	dabaR	https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+bug/45099
2006-06-03T05:21:00.000Z	dabaR	Nepton	can't find a reasonable reference. Dunno, too late here. good luck
