2012-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	bcuraboy		guys i'm having serious issues to install ubuntu 12.04
2012-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	bcuraboy		i'm trying to install it on a intel pc with 1gb ram and 1.66ghz processor
2012-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	bcuraboy		i've tried 3 ways to install it and it stucks on some point of the installation
2012-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	bcuraboy		yeah i'm sure
2012-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	bcuraboy		i've downloaded 2 times
2012-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	bcuraboy		talk
2012-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	Alt install or GUI install?
2012-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	more info needed ha ha:)
2012-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	APoulos: more like 11.04 ;) ha ha
2012-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	what does stucks mean? ha ha
2012-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	yeah but Alternate installer or GUI installer?
2012-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	because I highly doubt the GUI installer will work on that system :)(
2012-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	11.04 and Alternate installer! :)
2012-04-30T03:14:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	Go to ubuntu download site, go to other downloads link and find it, it's there :) use 11.04 and Alternate installer.
2012-04-30T03:14:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	if you use GUI installer it will fail :)
2012-04-30T03:14:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	yeah that link that Tinti did :) ha ha
2012-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	it's not suggested, you just cant run unit on that system
2012-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	sorry unity not unit ha ha
2012-04-30T03:19:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	it's gonna be slow but it will work if you turn off effects entirely
2012-04-30T03:19:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	very very slow ha ha
2012-04-30T03:19:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	strongly ha ha
2012-04-30T03:21:00.000Z	jfreak53	bcuraboy	trust me they won't notice, try another window manager then, there are many.  I still use Ubu 8 on 3 systems at our school. Old in Linux doesn't always mean old :)
