2011-11-21T19:00:00.000Z	TimothyA		it's GTK mucking up, I think
2011-11-21T19:00:00.000Z	TimothyA		does jwm use gtk?
2011-11-21T19:01:00.000Z	TimothyA		xterm will spawn a new console window, yes
2011-11-21T19:01:00.000Z	TimothyA		but it makes the previous one unusuable
2011-11-21T19:01:00.000Z	TimothyA		so what's the point of that?
2011-11-21T19:01:00.000Z	TimothyA		:|
2011-11-21T19:01:00.000Z	TimothyA		anyhow, for the 15th timwe: how do i REINSTALL GTK?
2011-11-21T19:02:00.000Z	TimothyA		xterminal window, console, whatever you want to call it
2011-11-21T19:03:00.000Z	TimothyA		I'm starting to get pissed off at ubuntu enough to just throw the damn thing out of the window altogether and remove ubuntu and install red hat on all the server
2011-11-21T19:03:00.000Z	TimothyA		s
2011-11-21T19:03:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	what is your frustration if you don't mind TimothyA?
2011-11-21T19:04:00.000Z	TimothyA	tyler_d	YOU'RE NOT BEING COOL BY USING THAT NICKNAME JUST BECAUSE YOU WATCHED A GOOD MOVIE
2011-11-21T19:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	ahhh, re-install GTK?
2011-11-21T19:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	there is no need to be mean... I'm trying to help. And yes, it is a fantastic movie
2011-11-21T19:06:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	have you attempted to strace for more output? what output are you getting
2011-11-21T19:07:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	From a term have you attempted to move your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and restart?
2011-11-21T19:08:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	what does Xorg.0.log tell you about any errors / problems
2011-11-21T19:09:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	I would at this point drop to term and start a `tail -f /var/log/*` then restart the x session; noting any errors that may occur
2011-11-21T19:09:00.000Z	TimothyA	tyler_d	which i've done for the past 18 times...
2011-11-21T19:09:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	Great, can you please pastebin teh output by teeing it to a file for me?
2011-11-21T19:10:00.000Z	TimothyA	tyler_d	okay, how do I select everything and copy it?
2011-11-21T19:11:00.000Z	tyler_d	TimothyA	from the term do, `tail -f /var/log/* | tee ~/log.output` then you can simply pop open that file after restarting X and copy the appropriate content please
