2009-07-18T21:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c3o	you can use wine, it is not an emulator (hence its name)
2009-07-18T21:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c3o	websearch for   wine reop  and use the wine from the wine repository
2009-07-18T21:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c3o	if you use virtualbox you will need a windows license as well as the install media to install a full blown windows OS.
2009-07-18T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c3o	virtualbox will allow yuo to run an OS inside a host OS, like vm ware. You will need a valid OS to install which my include licensing if you use proprietary one
