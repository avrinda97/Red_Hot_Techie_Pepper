2007-04-01T08:38:00.000Z	xtknight		in hindsight using beta/virtual machine isnt that great of an idea...
2007-04-01T08:38:00.000Z	xtknight		just install the regular version
2007-04-01T08:38:00.000Z	xtknight		you'll probably have enough trouble just using a stable linux
2007-04-01T08:38:00.000Z	xtknight		no offense to the devs or anything lol
2007-04-01T08:39:00.000Z	xtknight		ohh
2007-04-01T08:39:00.000Z	xtknight		sudo sh ..?
2007-04-01T08:41:00.000Z	xtknight		don't worry man i know about ET :)
2007-04-01T08:43:00.000Z	xtknight		the config for ET is stored in the user folder that way.
2007-04-01T08:43:00.000Z	xtknight		~/.etconfig or similar
2007-04-01T08:45:00.000Z	lotusleaf	xtknight	pb is in ~/.etwolf/pb
2007-04-01T08:45:00.000Z	xtknight		besides installing as root when you dont need to is just ... bleh
2007-04-01T08:46:00.000Z	xtknight		doubt it
2007-04-01T08:46:00.000Z	xtknight		the .run file itself is a command line program
2007-04-01T08:46:00.000Z	xtknight		but i dont think we need root at all
