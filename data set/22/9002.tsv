2005-06-12T07:14:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	please don't use breezy
2005-06-12T07:14:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	breezy on X is broken
2005-06-12T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	please don't use breezy
2005-06-12T07:15:00.000Z	CoRzA	bob2	i'm past that already
2005-06-12T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	apparently not if it isn't starting
2005-06-12T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	you do not need the proprietary drivers to get X to run
2005-06-12T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	breezy is really not ready for non-experts yet
2005-06-12T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	you'll have a lot less trouble if you reinstall with hoary
2005-06-13T16:50:00.000Z	CoRzA	bob2	and linukso it didnt work
2005-06-13T16:50:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	then undo whatever you did
2005-06-13T16:50:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	it's really silly to change things you don't understand without either keepign track or backing things up
2005-06-13T16:51:00.000Z	bob2	CoRzA	if you really have no idea, remove the files you installed (presumably nvidia.ko) and then do this in the terminal: "sudo dpkg -P --force-depends xserver-xorg ; sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg"
