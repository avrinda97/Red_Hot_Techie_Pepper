2007-09-18T15:46:00.000Z	poella		hi i dowloaded ubuntu for AMD64 but one thing is confusing me... i got 2 files on my desktop, the first one is a .iso (698 MB) and the second one is a .part file (~60MB), why?
2007-09-18T15:48:00.000Z	poella		ah! now i remember... one download got broken
2007-09-18T15:48:00.000Z	poella		so the only file i need is the .iso file? i'll delete the .part file then
2007-09-18T15:49:00.000Z	poella		okay. i'll re-download it just to be sure i get a working one :P
2007-09-18T15:51:00.000Z	poella		okay i'll take a look at "down them all"
2007-09-18T15:51:00.000Z	poella		really?
2007-09-18T15:52:00.000Z	poella		thats cool =)
2007-09-18T15:52:00.000Z	arialth	poella	indeed
2007-09-18T15:47:00.000Z	arialth	poella	are you using firefox?
2007-09-18T15:47:00.000Z	poella	arialth	yes
2007-09-18T15:47:00.000Z	arialth	poella	the download either broke or is not finished. press ctrl+j and look at your downloads
2007-09-18T15:48:00.000Z	arialth	poella	firefox seems to always create the main file, and then a .part file for the same thing
2007-09-18T15:48:00.000Z	arialth	poella	if the file is still there, then it means it is not done or did not finish properly, I recommend redownloading it if it is done
2007-09-18T15:50:00.000Z	arialth	poella	I recommend getting a download accelerator (I use Down them all)
2007-09-18T15:51:00.000Z	arialth	poella	it makes the download go REALLY fast, too
2007-09-18T15:52:00.000Z	arialth	poella	yes, it spilts the download into about 5 parts and downloads them individually at the same time
2007-09-18T15:53:00.000Z	poella	arialth	what's the name of the download accelerator you was talking about?
2007-09-18T15:53:00.000Z	arialth	poella	down them all
2007-09-18T15:54:00.000Z	arialth	poella	look up dTa. It is harder to set up than, say, Free Download Manager, but once you get it going, it is better
2007-09-18T15:55:00.000Z	arialth	poella	thats what it is called shorthand, i dunno what else it might mean...
2007-09-18T16:00:00.000Z	poella	arialth	i've downloaded and installed dTa now, do i need to do any especial settings to make it work 100%?
2007-09-18T16:00:00.000Z	arialth	poella	nope. If you right click there should be the options for DTA. Also, when you download something, firefox will ask you if you wanna use downthemall or not
