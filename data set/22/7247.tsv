2007-02-25T16:30:00.000Z	vivid		getting the same error on other installed libraries as well
2007-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	vivid		apt-get
2007-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	vivid		same, however its a program that i compiled myself
2007-02-25T16:33:00.000Z	vivid		long ago, has worked without problems, i tried to recompile, but im having the same issue with its dependency lib not found during compile, but i get no warning for it when i run the precompiled app
2007-02-25T16:34:00.000Z	vivid		and the lib is installed
2007-02-25T16:34:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	yes - but when you are compiling its not linking against it
2007-02-25T16:27:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	can you give me an example
2007-02-25T16:28:00.000Z	vivid	ikonia	libcairomm, all are installed including dev, so's are in /usr/lib, yet the system fails to see it
2007-02-25T16:28:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	can you give me an example of the failure
2007-02-25T16:29:00.000Z	vivid	ikonia	error while loading shared libraries: libcairomm-1.0.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2007-02-25T16:30:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	permissions/ld.so.conf ?
2007-02-25T16:31:00.000Z	vivid	ikonia	i tried adding /usr/lib and a couple other entries to ld.so.conf, which was non-existent before i created it, and ran ldconfig with no success
2007-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	how did you install those libraries - through apt/synaptic or compile from source
2007-02-25T16:32:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	what about the program that "wants" them
2007-02-25T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	there's the problem
2007-02-25T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	of course not the pre-compiled app is linked
2007-02-25T16:35:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	maybe it can't see/find the lib in the location it expects
2007-02-25T16:35:00.000Z	vivid	ikonia	the location all the libs im having issues with are /usr/lib
2007-02-25T16:36:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	show me the error when you try to configure the package for building (not the make)
2012-09-02T14:40:00.000Z	vivid	ikonia	dont get trolled
2012-09-02T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	he's not trolling.
2012-09-02T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	vivid	enough
