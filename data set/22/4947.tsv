2008-12-27T12:41:00.000Z	mindrape		yup... move to India if you want to be a programmer and get ready to be paid $2/hr.
2008-12-27T12:43:00.000Z	mindrape		if you want a career guaranteed to pay good money learn mainframes.  :)
2008-12-27T12:43:00.000Z	mindrape		they will never go away... all banks are stuck on them.
2008-12-27T12:43:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	you know, that attitude is what made me not want to do CS when i was in high school. hard to keep me away from it though, so i'm back to it. turns out being able to program and knowing linux pretty well means you're not really subject to outsourcing
2008-12-27T12:44:00.000Z	mindrape	maco	- Linux administration, yes.  Programming anything... way cheaper to offshore.
2008-12-27T12:44:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	nah. plenty of development happens in first world countries
2008-12-27T12:45:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	its the tech support that's outsourced most
2008-12-27T12:53:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	1) not a he 2) vim is not an os like emacs. vim just lets you run outside commands. emacs has a freaking mail client and video editor BUILT IN
2008-12-27T13:54:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	i'm with Seveas that putting a . randomly in the middle of a path does nothing
2008-12-27T13:54:00.000Z	mindrape	maco	- its the end of the path telling it to execute the script        ./
2008-12-27T13:54:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	no...
2008-12-27T13:55:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	"exec" or "bash" before the path would do that, but its already being told to execute by givin it the path
2008-12-27T13:55:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	yes, it is a relative path
2008-12-27T13:55:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	i think he's afraid of what you'll say next when you start running your mouth without knowing what you're talking about
2008-12-27T13:56:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	wow, that's pretty bad...
2008-12-27T13:56:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	and you still dont know how paths work?
2008-12-27T13:56:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	because your "solution" had jack to do with it
2008-12-27T13:56:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	he just said teh problem was that he misspelled terror
2008-12-27T13:58:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	it demonstrates that you dont know jack, so Seveas is telling you to stop volunteering misinformation until you learn what the heck you're talking about because next time you might be talking about something that could break a machine
2008-12-27T14:03:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	dont
2008-12-27T14:03:00.000Z	mindrape	maco	- dont what?
2008-12-27T14:03:00.000Z	maco	mindrape	not you, sorry
