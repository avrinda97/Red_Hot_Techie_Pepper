2009-01-31T22:09:00.000Z	ja2		Hi, I dont get ip-forward working in Ubuntu. Anyone got a suggestion?  sudo echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  give me permission denied.
2009-01-31T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	what command are you using
2009-01-31T22:09:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	use sudo
2009-01-31T22:09:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	I do sudo.
2009-01-31T22:09:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	you need to quote the qhole command
2009-01-31T22:10:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	"Command not found"
2009-01-31T22:10:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	 sudo "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
2009-01-31T22:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	sudo echo 1 > /proc/net/blah
2009-01-31T22:11:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	Also tried " at other places and totally without. sudo "echo 1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward for instance, always permission denied.
2009-01-31T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	try what I suggested
2009-01-31T22:13:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	bash: /proc/net/blah: No such file or directory
2009-01-31T22:13:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	Cant seem to pipe stuff
2009-01-31T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	oh come on - you know /proc/net/blah is not a real thing
2009-01-31T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	yes, the redirect is not carrying the sudo permissions
2009-01-31T22:13:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	I need to bring the sudo permission with the >. How is that done?
2009-01-31T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	just looking into it
2009-01-31T22:14:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	Fantastic. You rock!
2009-01-31T22:17:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	Ive found some ip_forwarding stuff in /etc/sysctl.conf, but it will take a reboot?    net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
2009-01-31T22:19:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	I got my ip_forward = 1 now.
2009-02-04T00:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	try #winehq
2009-02-04T00:44:00.000Z	ja2	ikonia	Thanks, I tried wine, but that was private channel.
2009-02-04T00:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ja2	#winehq
