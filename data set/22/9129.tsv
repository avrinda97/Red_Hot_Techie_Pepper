2005-03-09T13:46:00.000Z	arbeck		I've got an smb share mounted at boot... however, only root as write access to it, and I don't want to have to sudo to get right access... how can i change that?
2005-03-09T13:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	well, do you know the mountpoint.....
2005-03-09T13:47:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	yes
2005-03-09T13:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	well, sudo chown user:user /mountpoint
2005-03-09T13:49:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	that was the first thing I tried... it tells me that's not permitted
2005-03-09T13:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	what first thig?
2005-03-09T13:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	DO THE CHOWN FIRST AND REPLACE USER:USER with your username
2005-03-09T13:50:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	chown and chmod... i've already tried that.... it doesn't work... chown is not permitted
2005-03-09T13:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	grrrrr
2005-03-09T13:57:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	you see the problem is, when the drive is unmounted I can change the ownership and modify the dir.
2005-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	but as soon as it is mounted I loose that ability... I think I'm mounting the drive incorrectly, but I don't know what I did wrong
2005-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	modify /etc/fstab
2005-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	I added this line: //REDHATWEB/web /media/web smbfs credentials=/etc/cred 0 0
2005-03-09T14:01:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	does that look right to you?
2005-03-09T14:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	add a option
2005-03-09T14:02:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	what option?
2005-03-09T14:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	RTFM.
2005-03-09T14:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	man fstab
2005-03-09T14:08:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	I've read the fucking manual, and I know how fstab works... there's nothing in there about the problem i'm having
2005-03-09T14:12:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	Now if you were a nice guy, you would have told me to use the uid and gid options when i mounted the drive
2005-03-09T14:13:00.000Z	kbrooks	arbeck	yes, and i forgot them
2005-03-09T14:14:00.000Z	arbeck	kbrooks	but man fstab didn't help much either... i had to go to man smbmount
