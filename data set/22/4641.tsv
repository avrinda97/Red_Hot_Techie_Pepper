2007-12-02T05:33:00.000Z	hellsdark		Is Somebody using rtorrent ?
2007-12-02T05:34:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	just ask your question
2007-12-02T05:34:00.000Z	hellsdark		i would like to use rtorrent via ssh but just in order to see the download status
2007-12-02T05:35:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	I would use screen
2007-12-02T05:35:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	you type screen, then once inside screen you run rtorrant and start your downloads, then you "disconnect" from this session by typing Ctrl-A D.
2007-12-02T05:35:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	yes, but what about the rtorrent running ?
2007-12-02T05:35:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	later when you ssh in, you type "screen -r" and reconnect to that session
2007-12-02T05:36:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	can i have several rtorrent running ?
2007-12-02T05:36:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	why would you want to? :) but you could I guess
2007-12-02T05:36:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	in order to not disturb the rtorrent that is running, i don't want to close it :p
2007-12-02T05:36:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	rtorrent handles multiple torrent files simulatneously as it is
2007-12-02T05:36:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	you mean the one that's running right now?
2007-12-02T05:36:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	i know
2007-12-02T05:36:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	yes
2007-12-02T05:37:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	just stop it with ctrl-q quickly, and then restart, it takes a second to get back up to speed, but it doesn't download anyhthing twice
2007-12-02T05:37:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	kelsin hum i think i'll kill it and use screen as you said
2007-12-02T05:38:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	screen is a great great tool, look up some of the tutorials about it, it will help in MANY situations esp if you ssh alot, this irssi session is in screen for me, so when I go to work I just connect to it
2007-12-02T05:38:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	yep, i read about it. It just would be easier to launch another rtorrent to see my torrents
2007-12-02T05:39:00.000Z	kelsin	hellsdark	then you'd have to program rtorrant to find another version of itself on startup to just report status, since it doesn't have those features by default
2007-12-02T05:39:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	yep ^^
2007-12-02T05:40:00.000Z	hellsdark	kelsin	it would be nice to have some commands to see the status
