2006-09-16T15:07:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	still there?
2006-09-16T15:03:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	are your packages getting kept back?
2006-09-16T15:04:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	no, it thinks it's up to date
2006-09-16T15:05:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	try apt-get linux- and after the dash the architecture (386, 686, etc)
2006-09-16T15:08:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	yes, i'm here, ill use apt-get linux-<arch>
2006-09-16T15:26:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	apt-get remove --purge linux-image-*kernel here*
2006-09-16T15:14:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	i tried apt-get linux-i386 => invalid opeation, and i remembered to use install, and i get "E: Couldn't find package linux-i386", am i close?
2006-09-16T15:15:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	no i
2006-09-16T15:16:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	try if apt-get -f install does anything, for curiosity
2006-09-16T15:17:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	apt-get -f install linux-386 ?
2006-09-16T15:18:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	lets see, since ive never deleted a kernel...
2006-09-16T15:18:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	should i map the boot to use the old kernel, boot into it and see if apt-get still thinks it doesn't need an upgrade?
2006-09-16T15:22:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	getting information about what exactly happened is delayed simply because...i wasn't actually the one who deleted the kernel :), my friend is just starting to use linux at home
2006-09-16T15:23:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	so, im waiting for his reply to see which kernel exactly he lost
2006-09-16T15:24:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	his machine has about 1GB, so he's trying to keep the space really free
2006-09-16T15:24:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	he shouldve used apt-get to remove it
2006-09-16T15:25:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	i'll have him read up on apt-get (i never use it, so i'm not a good source for him -- <gentoo user>)
2006-09-16T15:27:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	it was vmlinuz-2.6.12-10-386 that he deleted
2006-09-16T15:28:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	thats, old, what IS he using anyway
2006-09-16T15:32:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	he has an amd-300
2006-09-16T15:33:00.000Z	Andrew67	sugoi_	sorry, have to go do some other work
2006-09-16T15:33:00.000Z	sugoi_	Andrew67	ok thanks
