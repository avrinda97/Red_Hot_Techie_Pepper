2011-08-03T03:20:00.000Z	induz		is there any software that can make my USB bootable for linux/ubuntu
2011-08-03T03:20:00.000Z	induz		I am having problem with USB to make it bootable
2011-08-03T03:21:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Depends on how you prepared the USB (stick? external HDD?) Does the BIOS support booting from USB (whatever) in the first place?
2011-08-03T03:23:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Are you trying to prepare the stick on windows side?
2011-08-03T03:27:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Cause if you are, try this link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#From Windows
2011-08-03T03:30:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Please, please be more specific. What are you trying to do, what did you do that now fails, and if you're using the stick under Windows properly, it cannot have been made as a proper installation/live USB stick.
2011-08-03T03:31:00.000Z	induz	astraljava	I tried to install an .iso linux on USB via UNEBootin but after instalation  nothing happens
2011-08-03T03:31:00.000Z	induz	astraljava	the USB then was made bootbale with DISKPart in MSwwindow
2011-08-03T03:32:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Sounds like your system doesn't know it's supposed to boot from the USB stick, then. Try to look into the BIOS settings.
2011-08-03T03:32:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	It doesn't need to be touched by anything else after the UNETbootin (or however it is spelt)
2011-08-03T03:34:00.000Z	induz	astraljava	I installed UNETBootin in my Ubuntu, then I am trying to install Mint on a USB stick
2011-08-03T03:37:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Okay, what's the Windows got to do with this? You're really making my head spin now.
2011-08-03T03:38:00.000Z	induz	astraljava	ok here is my Q: I have installed UNEBootin in my Ubuntu...how can I make a live Bootable USB
2011-08-03T03:40:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Okay. You need to start the application, then specify the device on which you want the image to be installed, and of course the image that _is_ to be installed.
2011-08-03T03:41:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Ubuntu will fit on that space, as it's only around 700MB
2011-08-03T03:44:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	That's a Windows command, you won't need that when you can be using UNETbootin
2011-08-03T04:31:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Around 700MB, due to CD sizes.
2011-08-03T04:34:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Again, Ubuntu Live, around 700MB, due to CD size limitation.
2011-08-03T04:37:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	You don't have to make it bootable, if you created it with usb-creator or unetbootin
2011-08-03T04:38:00.000Z	induz	astraljava	somehow the usb fails to boot with Linux on it
2011-08-03T04:39:00.000Z	astraljava	induz	Are you seeing any messages while it's trying to boot?
2011-08-03T04:41:00.000Z	induz	astraljava	no....but I am trying it again with UNETbootin and Live usb Ubuntu
