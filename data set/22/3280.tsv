2008-11-17T18:35:00.000Z	krish	doors98	check this http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Configuring_Ubuntu_Linux_Printers and use some near matched model number (check tray types too)

2008-11-17T18:35:00.000Z	krish		ciao
2008-11-17T18:35:00.000Z	doors98		krish:i tried 2000 and 2500 but it cant print,
2008-11-17T18:35:00.000Z	doors98		krish:it says that the printer is idle after i installed the drivers
2008-11-17T18:37:00.000Z	doors98		krish:the printer says ready suppose to be right? but it says its  idle
2008-11-17T18:39:00.000Z	doors98	krish	its very easy suppose to be to install a printer on ubuntu to print on windows right?
