2007-11-04T06:06:00.000Z	Tortik		can anyone help me, im getting netoworking problems in ubuntu
2007-11-04T06:06:00.000Z	Tortik		networking*
2007-11-04T06:07:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	I will
2007-11-04T06:07:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	no, just go in plain text here.
2007-11-04T06:08:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	still there?
2007-11-04T06:09:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	ok... which ubuntu version?
2007-11-04T06:09:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	and are you averse to commandline?
2007-11-04T06:10:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	ok, your using the latest version... what is the ethernet status for networking (you'll find it beside the clock)
2007-11-04T06:12:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	ah... in this case, you do have to make sure that the internet is plugged in for testing ;)
2007-11-04T06:12:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	but in short...
2007-11-04T06:13:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	If ubuntu is trying to get an IP address... you'll see it by the orbs turning green in the "system tray"
2007-11-04T06:13:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	it detected the cable... but if a minute passes and it seems to succeed, but you can't get internet... there might be a problem with your internet....
2007-11-04T06:15:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	if it doesn't work in XP, there is nothing to do. internet is currently not evailable.
2007-11-04T06:15:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	ubuntu is most probably working right now, and the internet is... wait... the internet works right now doesn't it? ;|
2007-11-04T06:16:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	in command line, enter this: "ping google.com"
2007-11-04T06:16:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	press CONTROL+C to stop it...
2007-11-04T06:16:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	cya soon
2007-11-04T06:24:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	hello, I didn't see you come in :)
2007-11-04T06:24:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	you don't have internet :
2007-11-04T06:25:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	ummm... in command line... try the following (You said wired connection right? through your regular ethernet port?))
2007-11-04T06:25:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up; dhclient3 eth0;
2007-11-04T06:30:00.000Z	mimithebrain	Tortik	ok, do "sudo -s" before all that
