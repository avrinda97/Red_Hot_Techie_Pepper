2010-10-25T14:42:00.000Z	Leman_Russ		have any of you had issues with Dual booting with Linux Mint??
2010-10-25T14:42:00.000Z	Leman_Russ		I tried a dual boot with Windows 7 and Linux Mint, and it was not having it
2010-10-25T14:42:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	what's your real question?
2010-10-25T14:43:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	tryin the linux mint channel.
2010-10-25T14:43:00.000Z	Leman_Russ	SpaceGhostC2C	My question is valid, as I want to dual boot Ubuntu with another OS
2010-10-25T14:44:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	Okay, so I still don't see any question or data to help us help you. :)
2010-10-25T14:45:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	What error was it?
2010-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	Maybe tell if it was a Wubi install?
2010-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	Leman_Russ	SpaceGhostC2C	What is a Wubi install?
2010-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	When you install from inside windows.
2010-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	Did you install Ubuntu by booting off the cd, or from inside windows?
2010-10-25T14:47:00.000Z	Leman_Russ	SpaceGhostC2C	No, I made a live CD, then booted off the CD
2010-10-25T14:47:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	Okay, so the way to fix it is in umm, one sec. I'm in terminal only, takes me a bit longer to google...
2010-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	It can happen any time when grub gets borked for any number of reasons.
2010-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	Leman_Russ	SpaceGhostC2C	Thank you.
2010-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	you can boot into the livecd and reinstall grub with a set of commands, I usually can give right away, but I'm dealing with a lot of silly here. :)
2010-10-25T14:51:00.000Z	Leman_Russ	SpaceGhostC2C	I appreciate your help.  I dont have the problem at the moment; I was merely trying to enhance my understanding, should I run into it again.  I don't want to have to wipe the drive again!
2010-10-25T14:53:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	you won't have to wipe it at all, I believe it was sudo grub-install /dev/{device} iirc
2010-10-25T14:55:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	Oh, sorry about the network adapter fail. Sad day. We're here if you need help. :)
2010-10-25T14:55:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	The grub problem shouldn't happen right away.
2010-10-25T14:56:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Leman_Russ	Well, my main hint would be to backup anything you don't want to lose.
2010-10-25T14:56:00.000Z	Leman_Russ	SpaceGhostC2C	Yes, of course
