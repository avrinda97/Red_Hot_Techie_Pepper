2006-07-06T10:52:00.000Z	Luke		is there a way I can select to use the security update kernel image vs. the current kernel image?
2006-07-06T10:54:00.000Z	bimberi	Luke	when you update kernels from the repositories, there are usually entries in the grub menu that allow you to boot from the old ones
2006-07-06T10:54:00.000Z	Luke	bimberi	i want to boot form the newer one by default
2006-07-06T10:54:00.000Z	Luke	bimberi	for some reason it is not default
2006-07-06T10:55:00.000Z	bimberi	Luke	ok, have you modified /boot/grub/menu.lst at all ?  It is usually set to boot from the first entry and new entries are added to the top of the list
2006-07-06T10:56:00.000Z	Luke	bimberi	nope i have not modified it
