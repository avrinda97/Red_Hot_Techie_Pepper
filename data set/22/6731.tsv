2006-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	Abraxas_		ok, I'm 100% sure this is the "wrong place to ask" but I can't find a forum based around hardware help, and most of my problems are in Ubuntu... My system, as of yesterday, has suddenly flopped unstable across both OSes..>I'm pretty sure it's hardware but I'm not sure how to diagnose -what- hardware it is
2006-08-12T05:44:00.000Z	Abraxas_		3d games in both OSes have been causing freezes and segfaults; I get random reboots in my other OS (win2k), and win2k is also seeing a new piece of hardware...when I've added nothing
2006-08-12T05:44:00.000Z	Abraxas_		my computer stays a steady 21C
2006-08-12T05:45:00.000Z	tapas	Abraxas_	i'd say power supply
2006-08-12T05:45:00.000Z	Abraxas_		ok...asabil..what can I grep out of  dmesg?
2006-08-12T05:45:00.000Z	tapas		these fail more often than people realize
2006-08-12T05:45:00.000Z	Abraxas_		tapas oh I believe it..i just want to diagnose that it's that before picking up a new one
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	tapas	Abraxas_	diagnosing is easy: put in another one and see whether the problem persists
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	tapas		same for ecey other piece of hw :)
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	Abraxas_	tapas	no free access to one ;)
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	tapas	Abraxas_	it's always good to have a replacement power supply around anyways ;)
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	Abraxas_	tapas	ditto with 'other piece of hw'..and I'm poor...and could kinda use having a stable PC for my new job that will make me not poor
2006-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	tapas		man, mksquashfs is sloooooooooooooooooooooow :)
2006-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	Abraxas_		Ok...my last firefox crash says: [17193950.812000]  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address... could that imply anything?
2006-08-12T05:49:00.000Z	tapas	Abraxas_	cheap test: run memtest over night
2006-08-12T05:50:00.000Z	tapas	Abraxas_	though if that fails, it might still be the power supply ;) as failing power supplies generate all other kind of weird problems which might look like other hw is failing
2006-08-12T05:50:00.000Z	Abraxas_		grr..mouse just died....brb
2006-08-12T05:51:00.000Z	Abraxas_		Ok..joy joy on that... I tried to run a program to see if i could trigger a crash, and instead of crashing it killed my mouse
2006-08-12T05:52:00.000Z	Abraxas_		can anyone suggest any diagnostic utilities to help me rule out any/all of my hardware, before I start buying "most likely" and hoping on it?
2006-08-12T05:53:00.000Z	tapas	Abraxas_	don't you have any friends? you could use their spare hw to rule out components
2006-08-12T05:53:00.000Z	Abraxas_		I see paging-failures in dmesg, but dont' know where to go from there
2006-08-12T05:53:00.000Z	Abraxas_	tapas	I don't have friends that keep spare hardware..most of my friends aren't computer geeks and gawk at me for putting my own system together (this is not a new system, over 3 years old)
