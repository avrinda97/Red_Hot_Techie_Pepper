2005-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	holycow		mostly incredibly useless
2005-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	holycow		i never understood why anyone would install something like that
2005-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	holycow		no dude
2005-11-15T08:45:00.000Z	holycow		and i can qualify the stupid
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		sure its easy
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		if your cpu is so wildly spiking in temperature from one minute to the next so as to justify having a fekin applet on the desktop monitoring it, you don't need an applet you need a new fekin computer
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		if you need an applet to tell you what the weather is like outside of your window, your a fekin moron
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		see?
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		its stupid
2005-11-15T08:47:00.000Z	holycow		it's cool and the 'cause i can factor' but its usefullness cannot be justified by an ameaba
2005-11-15T08:47:00.000Z	Toma-	holycow	weather apps are cool. only small ones tho... also, why have a Cpu monitoring app that uses 40% of the cpu to do so anyway :D
2005-11-15T08:50:00.000Z	Toma-	holycow	alot of them have a forecast function too... t
2006-06-05T16:37:00.000Z	Toma-	holycow	what are u doin?
2006-06-05T16:37:00.000Z	holycow	Toma-	i'm trying to figure out why my sound is gone, but modules are loaded, sound card is recognized and nothing is muted ... :/
2006-06-05T16:38:00.000Z	Toma-	holycow	speakers on?
2006-06-05T16:39:00.000Z	holycow	Toma-	yeah, they worked just before the dist-upgrade infact with last weeks beta.  the weird thing is this  upgrade seems to have updated the kernel, i had to fix nvidia manually and its probably interfering with sound now too
2006-06-05T16:39:00.000Z	Toma-	holycow	and you have rebooted?
2006-06-05T16:40:00.000Z	holycow	Toma-	later, thanks for the help
2006-06-05T16:41:00.000Z	Toma-	holycow	im guessing you might have had a modified /etc/modules/aliases file, and the dist-upgrade hasnt installed all the new aliases.
2006-06-05T16:41:00.000Z	Toma-	holycow	but thats just my first guess :( hope it points you somewhere! and sorry! :)
2006-06-05T16:41:00.000Z	holycow	Toma-	oh thats interesting ... *hmm* vaguely remember something about that way back ... okay googling
2006-06-05T16:41:00.000Z	holycow	Toma-	danke
