2007-02-21T07:34:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	Ya either use Dapper or another distro (Debian is the closest)
2007-02-21T07:35:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	7.04 is less stable actually
2007-02-21T07:36:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	DONT do it

2007-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	Cause if I remember Dapper isnt as easy to set up
2007-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	Only for BEryl
2007-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	Everythign else is good
2007-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	you will be more than fine with Dapper.
2007-02-21T07:39:00.000Z	cwoodall	Wolfe	you could try and change teh respiratories oncew u get it working and upgrade to Edgy but AI dont think that will avoid the problem
