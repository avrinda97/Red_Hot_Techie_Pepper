2009-02-21T15:30:00.000Z	thedave		hi! yesterday I installed a ubuntu via netinstall, but it won't boot. is there any way the re-write the Grub or MBR?
2009-02-21T15:31:00.000Z	C-S-B	thedave	can you boot into any enviroment?
2009-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	thedave	C-S-B	can I do it with the netinstall CD or do I need the live CD?
2009-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	thedave		I have the netinstall image, but I haven't found grub there yet ;)
2009-02-21T15:33:00.000Z	C-S-B	thedave	so you have no grub on the target machine at all? you could try booting a usb stick and installing grub with that
2009-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	thedave	C-S-B	I don't know. I have the netinstall image. There must be a grub somewhere.. :-/
2009-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	thedave		Since he installed without errors yesterday.
2009-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	thedave		Maybe I just re-install?
2009-02-21T15:35:00.000Z	thedave		Maybe I did set the boot-flag incorrect? Does this have to be at /boot or at / (root) or doesn't grub care where it is?
2009-02-21T15:35:00.000Z	C-S-B	thedave	try manually installing grub after booting via pxe?
2009-02-21T15:36:00.000Z	C-S-B		or does it not boot off pxe?
2009-02-21T15:36:00.000Z	thedave		PXE is netboot, yes?
2009-02-21T15:37:00.000Z	C-S-B		pxe is the standard for booting over the network
2009-02-21T15:37:00.000Z	thedave		That's a very good idea. So I need to setup a PXE Env on an other machine?
2009-02-21T15:37:00.000Z	C-S-B		well pxe booting is built into the network card
2009-02-21T15:37:00.000Z	C-S-B		Does the machine boot off the network ok?
2009-02-21T15:38:00.000Z	thedave		The BIOS has the option, but I never tried so far
2009-02-21T15:38:00.000Z	C-S-B		http://mediakey.dk/~cc/ubuntu-netboot-and-netinstall-with-pxe/
2009-02-21T15:39:00.000Z	thedave		ok I will give it a try C-S-B. Thank you :)
2009-02-21T15:39:00.000Z	C-S-B	thedave	arent you trying to boot and install over the network though? In order to successfully boot off the network, you need to have a pxe enable gfx card, a server dishing out the image with a dhcp server running. :)
2009-02-21T15:40:00.000Z	C-S-B		I manage a 2x system at work it's kind of similar :)
2009-02-21T15:41:00.000Z	thedave	C-S-B	no I used a 8.10_Netinstall image from USB. :) sorry for the mix-up in terms.
