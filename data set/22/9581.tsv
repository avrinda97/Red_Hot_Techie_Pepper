2005-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	I've disabled parallel port but without success :-(
2005-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	write them down and pass those parameters to modprobe
2005-04-20T13:36:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	already tried :-(
2005-04-20T13:36:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	are you using ALSA in-kernel or from alsa-source?
2005-04-20T13:37:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	I'm using an untouched warty upgraded to untouched hoary
2005-04-20T13:37:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	so try alsa-source; it has a newer ALSA version
2005-04-20T13:38:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	does I have to compile the whole kernel ?
2005-04-20T13:38:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	no, you compile just ALSA
2005-04-20T13:40:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	the strangest thing is that it doesn't work with the warty kernel
2005-04-20T13:41:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	does or doesn't?
2005-04-20T13:44:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	doesn't
2005-04-20T13:44:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	if it was working with the warty kernel, I would not bother you anymore ;-)
2005-04-20T13:45:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	it was working when I was in Warty. But it's not working in Hoary with the old kernel still available in grub
2005-04-20T13:45:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	does it work with any of the newer kernels in Hoary?
2005-04-20T13:46:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	I haven't seen other kernel. I will look...
2005-04-20T13:46:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	2.6.10-5-...
2005-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	I'm using this one !
2005-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	huh. I thought you meant that you hadn't used the new one.
2005-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	I've also tried the 2.6.8 from Warty, still available
2005-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	crimsun	ploum_	I'm sorry, but I need to leave. I'll be back later if you'd like to troubleshoot.
2005-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	sorry, my english is not perfect. I've tried both
2005-04-20T13:48:00.000Z	ploum_	crimsun	lot of thanks for your time :-)
