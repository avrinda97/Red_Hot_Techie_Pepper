2009-01-20T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	pecko	you should probably pastebin the errors and explain how you installed it
2009-01-20T18:05:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	"installed" i mean plugged in:)
2009-01-20T18:06:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	when i plug-in ati radeon 9250 pci, ubuntu doesnt boot. is impossible to paste log:D
2009-01-20T18:06:00.000Z	jrib	pecko	you said you got errors
2009-01-20T18:08:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	yes ive got... but, how can i copy and paste them, when OS doesnt boot?:P if i want to os to boot-up i have to plug-out graphics
2009-01-20T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	pecko	type them or take a picture...
2009-01-20T18:09:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	i just know ther's something like udevd-event :run_program: 'path/to/the/program' abnormal exit
2009-01-20T18:10:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	and then something about /bin/sh that it cannot be found and permission denied
2009-01-20T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	pecko	it's not hard to give exact errors, paraphrasing them usually just causes confusion.  I can't help you like this.  But include what you know in your questions I guess and maybe someone else can recognize the issue
2009-01-20T18:13:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	if u don have running os its very very hard to give exact errors. but i still can take a paper and pen and write down them from screnn:P
2009-01-20T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	pecko	when you have exact errors, you can usually just google them, that's why they're so helpful :)
2009-01-20T18:14:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	or i can make a picture with my camera:D
2009-01-20T18:14:00.000Z	pecko	jrib	ive tried... but no result. its why im here
