I want to do this so I can then install ubuntu  side-by-side with windows so I can have a vbox emulator running on ubuntu, allowing me to have a liunx+windows environment. BTW this is being done on a Acer Aspire One Netbook(I have a cd/dvd rom drive for it)

2009-09-04T01:32:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	the recovery partition is my windows disk
2009-09-04T01:33:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	*blink* they didnt give you a cd/dvd?
2009-09-04T01:33:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	no
2010-07-22T19:52:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	bad
2010-07-22T19:58:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	how would I make the patch work?
2010-07-22T20:01:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	fix it. figure out why the context lines around those hunks dont match, and fix them
2010-07-22T20:02:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	ok... I'm a bit new, how would I undo the patch, if possible?
2010-07-22T20:03:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	patch -R to reverse the patch
2010-07-22T20:03:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	its best to always use --dry-run when applying a patch, to see if any hunks will fail
2010-07-22T20:04:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	oh...
2010-07-22T20:04:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	you're going to need to be able to read a bit of code without running screaming to fix the patch. enough to go through and notice "hey, this hunk goes *here* and the patch thinks it has this line above it, but that line has since changed in thsi way, so if i tweak the patch to match that, it'll apply"
2010-07-22T20:05:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	note i didnt say *understand* code...just read through without running away ;-)
2010-07-22T20:07:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	ok got it :)
2010-07-22T20:08:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	um if you just run make, does that change the main source files?
2010-07-22T20:08:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	it shouldnt modify in-place, no. it should build more files though
2010-07-22T20:10:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	so... ok, I can stop make, and retry the patch then config again, then use make again without having to start all over and re-download the source?
2010-07-22T20:11:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	right
2010-07-22T20:11:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	you may want to know about "make clean" though ;-)
2010-07-22T20:12:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	maco	ok... I'm assuming that "make clean" clears any files "make" made?
2010-07-22T20:12:00.000Z	maco	ShapeShifter499	yep
