2006-11-18T10:48:00.000Z	alecjw		does anyone know what language cu bny is speaking so that i can point him/her to the appropriate channel?
2006-11-18T10:49:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	his ip points to IR
2006-12-07T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	pastebin the result of this command:  ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2006-12-07T15:46:00.000Z	alecjw	jrib	it returns nothing that seems to be related to flash
2006-12-07T15:46:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	which flash package do you have installed at the moment?
2006-12-07T15:46:00.000Z	alecjw	jrib	flashplayer-mozilla, although i usually use flashplugin-nonfree, shall i try installing that then try again
2006-12-07T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	well, what does 'dpkg -L flashplayer-mozilla' say?  What version of ubuntu by the way?
2006-12-07T15:48:00.000Z	alecjw	jrib	a hell of a lot of file paths. i'm using edgy
2006-12-07T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	how about    dpkg -L flashplayer-mozilla | grep '.so'
2006-12-07T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	erm, I mean:  '\.so'
2006-12-07T15:49:00.000Z	alecjw	jrib	four files, all in different directories, all with the filename libflashplayer.so
2006-12-07T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	ok, tell me those please, or just pastebin
2006-12-07T15:50:00.000Z	alecjw	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35835/
2006-12-07T15:51:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	interesting, I guess it doesn't install to firefox.  You can try using flashplugin-nonfree then
2006-12-07T15:55:00.000Z	alecjw	jrib	it doesn't download "due to network problems or upstream changes"
2006-12-07T15:55:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	what version of ubuntu did you say this was?
2006-12-07T15:56:00.000Z	alecjw	jrib	edgy
2006-12-07T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	meh, ok adobe is always messign with stuff.  You have 2 options, 1) just symlink to the libflashplayer.so you have now  2) use flash 9 beta (in backports)
2007-02-04T08:45:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	you can use an xp disk too, then it's "fixmbr" in the recovery console of the install disk
2007-02-25T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	use unix2dos in the "tofrodos" package
2007-03-10T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	alecjw	fmask and dmask should work too
