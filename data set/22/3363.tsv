2009-02-02T15:11:00.000Z	bob123		I plan on hiking and travelling a lot .. I am concerned about laptop with hard drive -- I am going to get this laptop http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10009253&prodlist=celebros ---  should I replace the HD with an SSD drive or will the HD be shock resistant enuff?
2009-02-02T15:12:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	Depensds how many times you plan to drop it :)
2009-02-02T15:12:00.000Z	bob123	lorenzosu	hehe good question, I tend to toss my backpacks around, hrm
2009-02-02T15:13:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	Depends on what you plan doing with the laptop, if for example you'll be downloading loads of photos you need plenty of space, and SSD still seems quite expensive compared to "traditional" HD
2009-02-02T15:14:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	You might consider getting an external USB disk to keep separate from the laptop for backup and in a safer, better protected place (say in the middle of your knapsack with lots of waterproof etc.
2009-02-02T15:15:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	Would help to know what your scenario is though.. i.e. knowing how you'll be using your laptop etc.
2009-02-02T15:15:00.000Z	bob123	lorenzosu	I am going to europe and doing a lot of hiking and back packing
2009-02-02T15:16:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	ActionParsnip is giving a wise token as well..
2009-02-02T15:16:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	If you come to Rome I can offer pizza + beer lol
2009-02-02T15:18:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	It depends on how much storage capacity you need.
2009-02-02T15:19:00.000Z	bob123	lorenzosu	for my work related prolly about 4 gigs
2009-02-02T15:20:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	If it's only doc and stuff you can now get fairly big USB sticks and SSD for reasanable price. If you go for SSd, though, check that your machine can read them.
2009-02-02T15:21:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	I don't know never used it. If you're really concerned about privacy, though, the first thing to think of is "physical" care.-
2009-02-02T15:21:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	meaning, being very carefull it *doesn't√©* get stiolen.
2009-02-02T15:22:00.000Z	bob123	lorenzosu	true .. handcuff to my body :)
2009-02-02T15:22:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	Well if you're working for the CIA or something I guess so :)
2009-02-02T15:23:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	It's a good approach. Also there also a common-sense in security..
2009-02-02T15:23:00.000Z	bob123	lorenzosu	I always rsync my files to a remote machine after a bit of work too
2009-02-02T15:24:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	Yes so do I. Re security what I mean is don't leave a document on your laptop desktop called "mySecretBankAccountPasswords.txt" :)
2009-02-02T15:25:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	Never used truecrypt, but I'm sure other users have.
2009-02-02T15:26:00.000Z	lorenzosu	bob123	My main concern is always "physical" protection care, as Iwas saying.
2009-02-02T15:26:00.000Z	bob123	lorenzosu	yah very true
