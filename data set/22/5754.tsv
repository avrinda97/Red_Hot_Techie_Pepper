2007-03-06T11:50:00.000Z	b0rted		hi there
2007-03-06T11:50:00.000Z	b0rted		any1 know about "hotplug system"?
2007-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	as of edgy, no.
2007-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	we don't use hotplug as of dapper (6.06), in fact.
2007-03-06T11:53:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	 so i cant use that feature?
2007-03-06T11:53:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	what feature?
2007-03-06T11:54:00.000Z	b0rted		hotplug system crimsun
2007-03-06T11:54:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	/ gyaresu: udev contains its functionality.
2007-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	b0rted		well, im told to put some files in /lib/hotplug/firmware, which doesnt exist, and the how-to is for edgy and its up to date...
2007-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	then where should i put the file?
2007-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	see https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2005-December/000028.html
2007-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	 im on edgy
2007-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	it's relevant for every Ubuntu release including Dapper and afterward.
2007-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	ok thanks
2007-03-06T12:06:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	sorry to disturb again, but i still dont know how/where to copy/convert the firmware from hotplug to udev
2007-03-06T12:06:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	that url has some hints for the conversion
2007-03-06T12:08:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	"If you had made any custom changes to the agent or rc scripts, these will need to be re-expressed as udev rules[0] " << all hint i can find
2007-03-06T12:10:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	scroll down to the bottom of that url.
2007-03-06T12:12:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	sorry i dont understand that, i compiled a firmware, got a file.fw, and was told to put in /lib/hotplug/firmware
2007-03-06T12:13:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	SUBSYSTEM=="$SUBSYSTEM", RUN+="/lib/udev/$FOO" << where to use that?
2007-03-06T12:13:00.000Z	crimsun	b0rted	in a udev rule
2007-03-06T12:15:00.000Z	b0rted	crimsun	i dont know about that, thanks for ur help anyway
