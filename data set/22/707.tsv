2011-05-03T12:17:00.000Z	Herbs		freaknyl are you running an ftp server?
2011-05-03T12:19:00.000Z	Herbs		freaknyl /var/log/messages would log ftp connections so soething is wrong
2011-05-03T12:19:00.000Z	Herbs		freaknyl what happens when you ftp localhost from the box
2011-05-03T12:20:00.000Z	Herbs		freaknyl would you mind giving me the servers ip?
2011-05-03T12:21:00.000Z	Herbs		freaknyl so whats the server doing and I assume its serving a local network?
2011-05-03T12:23:00.000Z	Herbs		freaknyl what writes the logs the java app?
2011-05-03T12:23:00.000Z	Herbs		gnome3 will not affect sudo
2011-05-03T12:24:00.000Z	niklasfi	Herbs	well... it does. i cannot sudo in gnome-shell but i can in tty1
2011-05-03T12:25:00.000Z	niklasfi	Herbs	no i mean `sudo apt-get install` for example
2011-05-03T12:26:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	do you get any error messages
2011-05-03T12:27:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	but gnome3 should have no bearing on a shell
2011-05-03T12:29:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	can you ssh to the box with the same creds?
2011-05-03T12:29:00.000Z	niklasfi	Herbs	yes
2011-05-03T12:29:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	hmm strange
2011-05-03T12:30:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	what happens if you enter run level 3 instead of gui can you suso then?
2011-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	niklasfi	Herbs	how do i run level3?
2011-05-03T12:33:00.000Z	niklasfi	Herbs	you mean select shell at the login screen?
2011-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	niklasfi	Herbs	that works
2011-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	that will probably work Im used to servers not desktops though
2011-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	looks like an ubuntu bug then
2011-05-03T12:36:00.000Z	Herbs	niklasfi	probably the strat up script and when it enters lvl 5
2011-05-03T12:36:00.000Z	niklasfi	Herbs	well it works there
