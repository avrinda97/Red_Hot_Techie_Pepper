2006-03-18T15:38:00.000Z	gazanfer		hello. gnome and kde are both too heavy for my low-end notebook system. is fluxbox a good choice?
2006-03-18T15:39:00.000Z	gazanfer		in fact i will try both :)
2006-03-18T15:40:00.000Z	gazanfer		are there anyone who has installed fluxbox before? i downloaded fluxbox .deb package, but it has a lot of dependencies which i can not get via apt-get. do i have to crawl the web for all the dependencies, or is there a better way?
2006-03-18T15:40:00.000Z	smellican	gazanfer	I am using fluxbox right now
2006-03-18T15:42:00.000Z	gazanfer	smellican	how can i find other packages needed by fluxbox? there are too many and it will take too much time if i try to find them one by one. is there a shortcut?
2006-03-18T15:43:00.000Z	smellican	gazanfer	all you need to do...is type... apt-get install fluxbox
2006-03-18T16:29:00.000Z	smellican	gazanfer	did you get fluxbox running?
2006-03-18T16:29:00.000Z	gazanfer	smellican	not yet, im getting updates, i will try to install it afterwards
