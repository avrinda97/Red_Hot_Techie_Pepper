2008-01-06T01:40:00.000Z	xerxes1358	Skitt	you there ?
2008-01-06T01:41:00.000Z	Skitt	xerxes1358	sry, was afk for a moment ... looks like your os isn't recognizing that there's anything plugged in ... did you connect the power suply (if one) or tried another usb-port?
2008-01-06T01:43:00.000Z	xerxes1358	Skitt	Yes I did already. But I can see that there is a message that says that the system sees a USB drive connected to the system
2008-01-06T01:43:00.000Z	Skitt	xerxes1358	where do you see the message?
2008-01-06T01:44:00.000Z	xerxes1358	Skitt	http://pastebin.org/14152
2008-01-06T01:47:00.000Z	Skitt	xerxes1358	yeah, there are 2 usb-devices. one you removed and the "X10 Wireless Technology, Inc."
2008-01-06T01:48:00.000Z	Skitt	xerxes1358	and i dont think the "X10 Wireless Technology, Inc." is your storage-device
2008-01-06T01:50:00.000Z	xerxes1358	Skitt	how about this link: http://pastebin.org/14156
2008-01-06T01:52:00.000Z	Skitt	xerxes1358	there's something which was connected and got disconnected (line 9 and 12) and there is another connected thing (line 13) which is your wireless controler
