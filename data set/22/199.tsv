2012-11-13T08:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	you dont have a proper alsa sound configuration
2012-11-13T08:45:00.000Z	blackness	almoxarife	explain in detail please..
2012-11-13T08:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	lets assume 'alsa' is installed, purge it and re-install it
2012-11-13T08:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	are you using 'synaptic'?
2012-11-13T08:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	no the package
2012-11-13T08:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	are you compiling?
2012-11-13T08:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	forge4t everything i said
2012-11-13T08:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	compiling also because?
2012-11-13T08:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	add 'dev' is usually a good bet, but i am guessing, it depends on the error shown
2012-11-13T08:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	you are compiling an applet?
2012-11-13T08:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	yes, been there, sounds great, good luck with that
2012-11-13T10:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	wiiw has not installed java, look at his paste, what needs to happen now is remove remnants of the failed install process by hand
2012-11-13T10:42:00.000Z	blackness	almoxarife	what i just pasted will do just that.
2012-11-13T10:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	the strip portion looks right, been there done that a few times
2012-11-13T10:49:00.000Z	blackness	almoxarife	java requires you to register for their product.
2012-11-13T10:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	pigeonor_ has the same like problem as wiiw
2012-11-13T10:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	more importantly, ask yourself why he cant get help on his own channel
2012-11-13T10:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	blackness	sucks to use debian?
2012-11-13T11:42:00.000Z	blackness	almoxarife	they need a lil more then that ;)
