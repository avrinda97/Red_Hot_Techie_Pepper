2012-10-06T15:34:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		I'm trying to ssh, and telnet, but both are not working. I'm getting "ssh: connect to host spoonx.nl port 22: Network is unreachable" while it's clearly reachable.
2012-10-06T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	RWOverdijk	why is it "clearly reachable"?
2012-10-06T15:36:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	Because the website is up, and I can ssh in from my phone.
2012-10-06T15:36:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		But ssh is not working for me with any host. Same for telnet
2012-10-06T15:36:00.000Z	jrib	RWOverdijk	is your phone on the same network that the machine you are connecting from is on?
2012-10-06T15:37:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	No. But I'm trying that now.
2012-10-06T15:38:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	Now it is. So I think it's a network thing.
2012-10-06T15:38:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		I did enable port range forwarding
2012-10-06T15:38:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		On port 22 and 80
2012-10-06T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	RWOverdijk	is the server on the same local network?  How are you trying to connect? (you can pm any private info)
2012-10-06T15:39:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	It's not on the same local network. It's a vps somewhere two cities from here.
2012-10-06T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	RWOverdijk	ok
2012-10-06T15:39:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	Also tested it with mx1 through 4 .hotmailcom (telnet)
2012-10-06T15:39:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		.com*
2012-10-06T15:40:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		Perhaps it's my port range forwarding.
2012-10-06T15:40:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	Fail... I still had my port filtering for port 22 enabled.
2012-10-06T15:41:00.000Z	jrib	RWOverdijk	ah
2012-10-06T15:41:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		:p
2012-10-06T15:42:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		Now ssh works but telnet doesn't =_=
2012-10-06T15:42:00.000Z	jrib	RWOverdijk	why would anyone use telnet :x
2012-10-06T15:42:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	I want to try a helo
2012-10-06T15:42:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	jrib	Checking if I'm going to spam or not. Just a test.
