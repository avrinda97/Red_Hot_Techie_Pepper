2011-09-05T05:30:00.000Z	silverarrow1		does anyone have an external bluetooth device in ubuntu?
2011-09-05T05:31:00.000Z	silverarrow1		any bluetooth users?
2011-09-05T05:31:00.000Z	achromat	silverarrow1	I have a bluetooth keyboard set up on 10.4
2011-09-05T05:32:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	then it should work
2011-09-05T05:32:00.000Z	achromat	silverarrow1	Yes, are you having a problem with bluetooth?
2011-09-05T05:32:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	it is a usb device, and light is blinking there, but nothing detected in os?
2011-09-05T05:34:00.000Z	achromat	silverarrow1	is the adapter detected by the os?
2011-09-05T05:35:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	no, I cannot see anything
2011-09-05T05:35:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	maybe though, since device indicator light is on?
2011-09-05T05:38:00.000Z	achromat	silverarrow1	I didn't have much trouble setting my adapter up. is it listed in lsusb?
2011-09-05T05:38:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	, terminal ?
2011-09-05T05:39:00.000Z	achromat	silverarrow1	Yes.
2011-09-05T05:39:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	, yes "D 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)" Must be active then?
2011-09-05T05:40:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	thanks for the command tip
2011-09-05T05:40:00.000Z	achromat	silverarrow1	it should be, what happens when you go to System >Preferences > Bluetooth?
2011-09-05T05:41:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	then it must be something in the other end; printer and mobile phone?
2011-09-05T05:45:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	cannot find anything, mind you, I have lubuntu, much the same, but not exactly as regular Ubuntu
2011-09-05T05:48:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	I'm sorry I started this and cannot follow through, my head is mush, fogged up by computer issues, and need  a break
2011-09-05T05:48:00.000Z	achromat	silverarrow1	Well good luck in the future then. Sorry I couldn't help.
2011-09-05T05:49:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	probably sort it out tomorrow
2011-09-05T05:49:00.000Z	silverarrow1	achromat	thanks anyway
