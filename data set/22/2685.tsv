2009-04-04T08:55:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	you could try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-04-04T08:55:00.000Z	Perry__	musikgoat|main	 musikgoat|main; will that surely resolve the problem
2009-04-04T08:55:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	no

2009-04-04T08:58:00.000Z	Perry__	musikgoat|main	 then i have to restart my system and do that??
2009-04-04T08:58:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	no, just run the command, logout and log back in
2009-04-04T09:01:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	then to answer your earlier question, you will have to run that command after you login
2009-04-04T09:02:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	 you should try reading through your hd's logs to see why it couldn't load the gui
2009-04-04T09:03:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	when you are in there...
2009-04-04T09:04:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	"less /var/log/messages"  and read through it for errors to give you more information
2009-04-04T09:05:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	yes, if you mount the hard drive (unless it automounted)
2009-04-04T09:05:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	sudo
2009-04-04T09:07:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	you don't need to ssh
2009-04-04T09:08:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	yes, sorry.   check in /media for your hard drives mount name
2009-04-04T09:08:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	then gksudo gedit /mount/thatname/var/log/messages
2009-04-04T09:13:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	Perry__	you should have a /media/disk/var/log/messages  use the file manager to check whats in the var/log direcory
