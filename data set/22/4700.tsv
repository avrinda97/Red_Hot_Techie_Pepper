2008-05-14T00:58:00.000Z	evil_tech	ronny	do you have a cdrom at all? or another computer to perform this task on. cause i know of no way to do it without a cd rom
2008-05-14T01:00:00.000Z	ronny	evil_tech	the usb stick just broke

2008-05-14T01:01:00.000Z	evil_tech	ronny	not unless you have a linux computer
2008-05-14T01:01:00.000Z	ronny	evil_tech	i have another linux computer
2008-05-14T01:02:00.000Z	evil_tech	ronny	you can do it from there then i think
2008-05-14T01:02:00.000Z	evil_tech		let me check
2008-05-14T01:03:00.000Z	evil_tech		ronny:http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2008/05/08/usb-ubuntu-804-persistent-install-via-the-live-cd/
2008-05-14T01:03:00.000Z	evil_tech	ronny	just follow that and you should be good
2008-05-14T01:05:00.000Z	evil_tech	ronny	you'll have to mount the Ubuntu iso in loop and as such some of the directories you need to pull from will be different but it should work
2008-05-14T01:07:00.000Z	evil_tech	ronny	alternativley you could turn your linux box into a boot and install server and install over the network
