2010-07-28T10:12:00.000Z	nimbiotics		hello everybody. I just updated to 10.04 and, upon booting, I'm getting message: "An error occurred while mounting 'blkid. Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery" and booting stops. I tried M once but, not knowing what to do, haven't tried again.  Please notice that the message includes the single quote before blkid; thats not a typo. I was told earlier to remove usbmount and hal...
2010-07-28T10:13:00.000Z	nimbiotics		...so ichecked an usbmount is not installed, removed hal and still had same problem so I just installed again. by What can I do?? TIA!
2010-07-28T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	Sounds like your fstab had things added to it that shouldn't have been.  A LiveCD is your best bet for fixing it.
2010-07-28T10:15:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	am a noob, can you please further ecxplain your answer? TIA
2010-07-28T10:16:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	hmmm... are you telling me to reinstall 10.04?
2010-07-28T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	No.  But you'll need to get to a state where you can edit your fstab (which is a file), and a LiveCD is probably the easiest way you're going to get there.
2010-07-28T10:18:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	and how do i know what should and should not be there?
2010-07-28T10:19:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	Well, from the LiveCD you come back and we'll walk you through it.  It either got something added to it, or it got over written.  If it's the former, we just remove the line with "blkid" on it.  If it's the latter, we'll have to create a new one, which isn't difficult and we can help you do so here.
2010-07-28T10:20:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	could it be just the single quote before 'blkid?
2010-07-28T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	"blkid" wouldn't be in that file normally.
2010-07-28T10:21:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	ok, i'll do that, whats the location of fstab?
2010-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	/etc/fstab (so it'll be in whatever partition is your harddrive, then in /etc/ then the "fstab" file)
2010-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	ok, thanks, be back in a while
2010-07-28T10:59:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	here's my fstab (http://dpaste.com/222625/) and this is the result of blkid (http://dpaste.com/222626/) Hope you can help. TIA!
2010-07-28T11:00:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	The second line, put a # in front of it.
2010-07-28T11:00:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	("Use 'blkid -o....)
2010-07-28T11:03:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	thanks, will try that and let you know in 10
2010-07-28T11:22:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	i havent been able to edit fstab ... can you please tell me how?
2010-07-28T11:22:00.000Z	Flannel	nimbiotics	Are you on the LiveCD still?
2010-07-28T11:27:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	no, i'm not, but i just did edit fstab. as nio pointed out, i was omitting sudo. let me reboot and i'll let you know what hapenned
2010-07-28T11:38:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	That fixed two big issues, thanks un bunch!!!
2010-07-28T11:42:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Flannel	Again, thank you very much. I've stil got at least half a dozen issues after upgrade to 10.04, but thats all for me today. I need a break. God bless you
