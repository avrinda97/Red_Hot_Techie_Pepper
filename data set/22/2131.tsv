2010-02-05T19:08:00.000Z	aurilliance		*?
2010-02-05T19:09:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	Have you followed the instructions (provided in VirtualBox help guide), or did you do it manually?
2010-02-05T19:12:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	iflema already done it :P
2010-02-05T19:12:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	yeah, I followed the help
2010-02-05T19:13:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	Yes, then you should have gotten the kernel module compiled by now, right?
2010-02-05T19:20:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	hehe, it didn't compile cus it was missing the kernel headers
2010-02-05T19:26:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	got it - thanks :)
2011-06-17T11:29:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	Check scrot out
2011-06-17T11:29:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	will do. Ty
2011-08-11T09:47:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	You sure you want gparted?
2011-08-11T09:47:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	err, gedit?
2011-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	Maybe pyroom is a better option for you, which is just that, a very uncluttered interface... Or you could always use Vim
2011-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	mm. I'm attempting to make my install more like textmate for mac, and have installed several plugins people recommend, but the interface is still very cluttered. I'm aiming for something between gedit's default and perhaps scribes.
2011-08-11T09:50:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	Ah, well, I'm no Mac fan so can't help there. That and I don't use gedit >.<
2011-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	:P
2011-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	Maybe there's an option to hide the toolbar in "View"?
2011-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	I feel foolish now. Well said.
2011-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	Huh?
2011-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	aurilliance	theadmin	View->Hide toolbar
2011-08-11T09:52:00.000Z	theadmin	aurilliance	lol :D
