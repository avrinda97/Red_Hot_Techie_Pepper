2008-01-02T04:37:00.000Z	eHome		anyone used ekiga http://www.hotubuntunews.com/blog_9.shtml ? is is really good ?
2008-01-02T04:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	eHome	well, it works...
2008-01-02T04:38:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	oh? i should have a try. i usually use skype.
2008-01-02T04:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	eHome	it's in synaptic so if you want to give it a try, just tick the box..
2008-01-02T04:39:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	FrostRat : i guess my friends should have ekiga as well. well they are on XP/Vista
2008-01-02T04:44:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	there are no info on ekiga.net - similar to skype? you pay so that you can use pc-phone. and i guess free pc-pc ?
2008-01-02T04:45:00.000Z	zcat[1]	eHome	there are heaps of different sip providers ; sipphone, freeworlddialup, etc ..
2008-01-02T04:53:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	well, might take a while to understand how to use. installed edika, not sure where to start
2008-01-02T04:55:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	what is a sip account look like: abc123 or just phone number ?
2008-01-02T04:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]	eHome	can be both. usually you get a name but there's a matching number, so that ppl with ATA adapters can phone you like a normal phone
2008-01-02T04:59:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	mmm . it's a matter of popularity. if none of my friends use ekiga, that makes my ekiga useless -- is it true ?
2008-01-02T05:01:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	?
2008-01-02T05:05:00.000Z	zcat[1]	eHome	many sip providers 'peer' with each other, so you can call friends on a different system just like calling another country.. (but still free)
2008-01-02T05:06:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	yes. i found out now. ekiga can call yahoo etc. so i m now applying a sip account
2008-01-02T05:07:00.000Z	zcat[1]	eHome	the best answer though is get all your friends to make a sip aggount on the same provider
2008-01-02T05:07:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	i m dummy. find out what sip means first ...
2008-01-02T05:08:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	quick FAQ: me and friends use yahoo msn skype -- can ekiga still handle ?
2008-01-02T05:09:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	i m quite new to ekiga idea
2008-01-02T05:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]	eHome	afaik skype only talks to skype ... don't know at all about the others. All of your friends can install ekiga and make an account at ekiga.net though..
2008-01-02T05:10:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	well, in this case, i m not going to register. my friends are more dummy than me. they use msn on xp
2008-01-02T05:11:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	nowadays, scared of accounts/password and spam - the less the better
2008-01-02T05:12:00.000Z	eHome	zcat[1]	thanks for info :D
