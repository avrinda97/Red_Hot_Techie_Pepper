2006-05-23T15:16:00.000Z	watson540		phenom<-- root is created automatically..or should be
2006-05-23T15:16:00.000Z	watson540		it was on my box :)
2006-05-23T15:16:00.000Z	watson540		root HAS to be there, ununtu just starts you off with a non standard password
2006-05-23T15:17:00.000Z	watson540		phenom<-- ubuntu makes it up for you, you have to change it
2006-05-23T15:17:00.000Z	watson540		phenom<-- i forget the details its been a while..its prolly on the wiki
2006-05-23T15:17:00.000Z	watson540		phenom<-- log in as a superuser, then in your GUI go to the user editor an change roots pw that way
2006-05-23T15:18:00.000Z	watson540		phenom<-- no, a superuser IS the account that ubuntu DID let  you create during install :)
2006-05-23T15:19:00.000Z	watson540		ill get flamed for this but here goes..I run as root every single day for everyday things :)
2006-05-23T15:19:00.000Z	watson540		and i never had a problem yet
2006-05-23T15:19:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	yes, fine, but there's no *need* to enable the root account
2006-05-23T15:20:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	and it's dangerous to recommend. People might start logging in as root and end up doing bad things to themselves :)
2006-05-23T15:21:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	recommend == tell people about it. On this channel, you should always tell people to use sudo :) (I've enabled the root account too, BTW ;)
2006-05-23T16:06:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	it's an editor? I thought it's a file manager or something like that...
2006-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	apt-get install openssh-server was all I had to do :)
2006-05-23T16:20:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	BTW, I had problems -- I couldn't ssh from my own computer, but I could ssh from outside... I don't remember how I finally fixed that
2006-05-25T10:15:00.000Z	watson540	hastesaver	unmount it first..then eject
2006-05-25T10:16:00.000Z	watson540	hastesaver	'eject --force'
2006-05-25T10:21:00.000Z	watson540	hastesaver	sounds like a hardwae problem
2006-05-25T10:23:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	hmm, but I can eject while my computer is booting.... Yes, a hardware problem is what I suspected too... maybe some cables are loose or something... I'll open it up and try fiddling with it, thanks.
2006-05-25T11:00:00.000Z	hastesaver	watson540	you were right; the cable connecting the cd drive to the motherboard was loose. Fixed it
2006-05-25T11:00:00.000Z	watson540	hastesaver	me? right? there's a first time for everything :)
