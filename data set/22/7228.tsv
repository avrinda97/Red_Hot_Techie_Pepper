2006-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	flack		Anyone: Is there a way to see what version's are availible and what version you have installed for a paction in ubuntu?
2006-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	flack		through a cli that is
2006-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	I also do apt-cache show <packagename> for that
2006-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	the one that has Installed-size is the one you have
2006-07-20T11:47:00.000Z	flack	Lynoure	You use apt-cache show and what other command?
2006-07-20T11:48:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	sorry, I was unclear, I meant it's wat loads of ppl I know use, but of course there might be a gui way too. I'm not very gui'ish
2006-07-20T11:49:00.000Z	flack	Lynoure	No, me neither, I enjoy a CLI, but what was the way you saw what was availible? Like can you specifiy what version to install?
2006-07-20T11:50:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	it does show all available versions of that package, from the sources in your sources.list.  And the one that has Installed-size listed is the one you have
2006-07-20T11:51:00.000Z	flack	Lynoure	But how (if) can I choose which version to install?
2006-07-20T11:52:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	I should know that but I have forgotten... There was a way of giving apt-get both the name and the version number
2006-07-20T11:52:00.000Z	flack	Lynoure	Like, I want nmap version 4.0, nmap, by default with apt installs 3.8, how (other than compiling from sourcE) could I get 4.0?
2006-07-20T11:53:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	see my comment above.
2006-07-20T11:54:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	googling helped: apt-get install package=version
2006-07-20T11:55:00.000Z	flack	Lynoure	So if apt-get show doesn't show version 4.0 ubuntu doesn't have it?
2006-07-20T11:56:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	then the sources you are looking at (the ones in /etc/apt/sources.list ) do not have it. However, do   apt-get update  to be sure you are looking at newest possible listings
2006-07-20T11:57:00.000Z	flack	Lynoure	I am, hmmm that's dissapointing
2006-07-20T11:57:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	you might be able to get it from somewhere. Or you could compile it yourself
2006-07-20T11:58:00.000Z	flack		Nynoure: I know, but the problem is ubuntu is like that with alot of packages (that's why I went to gentoo... even if hardware detection on ubuntu owns)
2006-07-20T11:58:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	Ubuntu is not trying to have everything of everything... Debian is trying to do that :)
2006-07-20T11:59:00.000Z	flack	Lynoure	my debian box only shows version 3.8 too :-P
2006-07-20T12:00:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	which version of Debian you have on your debian box? sid is the only one haven't the newest newest stuff, but yep, sometimes unpaid volunteers haven't had enough time or energy
2006-07-20T12:03:00.000Z	Lynoure	flack	testing and unstable Debian version both have 4.10
