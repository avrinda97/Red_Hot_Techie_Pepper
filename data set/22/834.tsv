2011-10-08T19:20:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		I'm trying to install Ubuntu onto my new laptop via a flash drive and UNetBootin, but when I pick any of the three options in the boot menu, it just cuts to a blank screen!  Any tips?
2011-10-08T19:20:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	how long does the blank screen stay?
2011-10-08T19:21:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	hramrach	Until I shut off the screen.
2011-10-08T19:21:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		*shut off the laptop
2011-10-08T19:22:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	did you try some safe boot option?
2011-10-08T19:24:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	hramrach	Yes.  Still nothing.
2011-10-08T19:25:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	do you have caps lock led on your keyboard? Does pressing chasnge it? How long does disk keep working after it shuts down the screen? did you try an external screen?
2011-10-08T19:25:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		No Caps Lock, pressing keys does nothing, I don't know how I can tell, and no I have not but I don't see how that would be the issue.
2011-10-08T19:26:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	then numlock
2011-10-08T19:26:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		Well, I mean I have the keys, but they're not active.
2011-10-08T19:27:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	there might be a disk led on the usb drive
2011-10-08T19:27:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		There is.  It flashes for a bit, then just glows flatly.
2011-10-08T19:27:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	then ubuntu is probably incompatible with your hardware. You can try different version
2011-10-08T19:28:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	it flashes after the screen goes blank?
2011-10-08T19:29:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		Yes.
2011-10-08T19:29:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		Just once.
2011-10-08T19:29:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		And by "blank" I mean "black"; the screen itself is still on.
2011-10-08T19:30:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	then graphics driver probably crashes the machine. Should not happen in the "safe" mode but whatever
2011-10-08T19:31:00.000Z	BlueProtoman	hramrach	What should I do, then?
2011-10-08T19:31:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	still it might be some other driver that happens to load at the time but since Ubuntu helpfully turns off the screen you never know
2011-10-08T19:31:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	try other version/distro
2011-10-08T19:32:00.000Z	hramrach	BlueProtoman	or make it not blank the screen and take a picture of the messages
