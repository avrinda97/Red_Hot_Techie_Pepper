2005-12-27T11:28:00.000Z	thesaltydog		while upgradibg to dapper, it tries to remove xmkmf, together with a lot of stuff..
2005-12-27T11:29:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	it also wants to remove hotplug >.>
2005-12-27T11:30:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	you're doing dist-upgrade right?
2005-12-27T11:31:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	dapper doesn't use xmkmf currently >.>
2005-12-27T11:34:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	errors were encountered while processing locales_2.3.7-1_all.deb and all the language-pack-gnome
2005-12-27T11:34:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	>.>
2005-12-27T11:37:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	the version of Xorg that dapper uses doesn't need xmkmf
2005-12-27T11:37:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	ok. I believe you. But anyway I'm stuck. No breezy and no dapper.
2005-12-27T11:38:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	have you backed up your files?
2005-12-27T12:14:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	I have fixed all things running aptitude instead of apt-get..
2005-12-27T12:14:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	they are actually both doing the same just in a diff way
2005-12-27T12:15:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	but with apt-get I was getting breaks during the upgrade. aptitude has a better dependencies control system.
2005-12-27T12:16:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	in any case they are not the same. Look in the debian docs.
2005-12-27T13:52:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	is there any known problem on dapper's package "locales"?
2005-12-27T13:52:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	do you have something in mind?
2005-12-27T13:53:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	no, it won't upgrade on my system
2005-12-27T13:54:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	it doen't remove. Cannot remove old one.. maybe forcing?
2005-12-27T14:34:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	I had to modify the preinst file in the locales .deb package to let it install.
2005-12-27T14:35:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	it worked eh?
2005-12-27T14:36:00.000Z	thesaltydog	burning_bronx	is italian firefox localization in dapper a known bug? It won't upgrade from breezy..
2005-12-27T14:37:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	most firefox locales in dapper would cause your firefox to crash
2005-12-27T14:39:00.000Z	burning_bronx	thesaltydog	just remove firefox locales and install/upgrade firefox
