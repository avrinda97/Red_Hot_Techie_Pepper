2009-01-21T15:53:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	I'm newb so bare with me... What does that do?
2009-01-21T15:56:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	apt-cache search xen (search for xen) | (pipe out to ) grep image (only show result that include the frace or word image) | (pipe to ) grep `uname -r` (ticks tell it to execute uname -r give the kernel version you currently have with tell it to only show results with the current kernel version)
2009-01-21T16:02:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	depending on what you want, each one is a different package or kernel, you can only run one kernel at a time and ubuntu automaticly updates your bootloader so in theory you can install several kernel with out much hard, its just a hasle and posibily dangerous to your system and to bounce between them depending on what modules your using and how you installed them
2009-01-21T16:04:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	hmmm, I find package descriptions lacking clarity. Or perhaps it's just me being newbie
2009-01-21T16:05:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	for instance, how do I know which kernel gets installed if I install ubuntu-xen-server package?
2009-01-21T16:05:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	you can get a better description here http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2009-01-21T16:07:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	thanks.
2009-01-21T16:09:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	oh I see.. The ones with red circle get installed? (Depends)
2009-01-21T16:09:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	yes
2009-01-21T16:09:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	thanks a bunch
2009-01-21T16:10:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	where do I see that list?
2009-01-21T16:11:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	found it... On the bottom
2009-01-21T16:13:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	so as a concept, whenever installing any package, it may take some researching...
2009-01-21T16:14:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	at first but your figure it out more as you go along their are some conventions what did you need the xen kernel for, have you considered using a normal virtualization server like vmware or virtualbox instead of xen
2009-01-21T16:15:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	I am an admin in a firm, working primarily with Microsoft platform, but I'm trying out linux and I want to learn about XEN :)
2009-01-21T16:19:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	oh, it seems to be getting fairly popular
2009-01-21T16:19:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	what is? Linux?
2009-01-21T16:21:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	XEN, it seems to be gaining popularity, were still using vmware here
2009-01-21T16:21:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	yeah. I like oss
2009-01-21T16:23:00.000Z	imagodei	rprettyman	plus I tried out ESXi server, and it just won't recognise the network. No console, if I understand correctly, so there's nothing to configure. I deleted it and installed ubuntu server, now trying to install XEN
2009-01-21T16:24:00.000Z	rprettyman	imagodei	yes ESXi has limited hardware support, probably because of their size constrant goals, but xen seems to have some trouble with windows vm's, but i'd imagine if you were strickly using it for unix/linux vm's it would be fairly solid
