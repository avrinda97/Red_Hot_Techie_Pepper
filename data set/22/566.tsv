2011-07-16T21:51:00.000Z	quiescens	Mamed	your run application dialog doesn't fit on the screen? which release are you on? 11.04?

2011-07-16T22:25:00.000Z	Mamed	quiescens	np, i have another uestion, i installed matlab and it asked which account the licence was for and i typed root as this is my only account but my actuall account is called mamed, and now i can find matlab, do i need to do something special to see it?
2011-07-16T22:29:00.000Z	quiescens	Mamed	i would guess you should have given it your user name and not root, maybe run the install again and use your user's name instead?
2011-07-16T22:29:00.000Z	quiescens	Mamed	i don't have/use matlab either
2011-07-16T22:29:00.000Z	quiescens	Mamed	maybe they have their own support options available
