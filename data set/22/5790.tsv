2009-08-23T04:20:00.000Z	unop	Stevethepirate	you can no longer get a functional xorg.conf using that method -- it seems the only way is to manually create this file to get something meaningful.
2009-08-23T04:21:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	unop	Since when though, I recall doing it on a 8.04 box last week x/
2009-08-23T04:21:00.000Z	unop	Stevethepirate	well, since the new Xorg versions - probably since version 7.something
2009-08-23T04:21:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	unop	meh, ^^
2009-08-23T04:23:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	unop	since, my xorg.conf says its a legit way to fix it.
2009-08-23T04:23:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	unop	my xorg.conf [grep -v #*\n] is like 10 lines x(
2009-08-23T04:23:00.000Z	unop	Stevethepirate	that's just cruft from the legacy scripts
2009-08-23T04:24:00.000Z	unop	Stevethepirate	what kind of a video card do you have?
2009-08-23T04:25:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	unop	problem with this method is that I have no working PC with a GUI to acces that link x/
2009-08-23T04:25:00.000Z	unop	Stevethepirate	what are you on the internet with currently?
2009-08-23T04:26:00.000Z	unop	Stevethepirate	can't you use something like lynx or w3m then?
2009-08-23T04:26:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	unop	Not with our firewall setup...
2009-08-23T04:27:00.000Z	unop	Stevethepirate	well well, I'd say - find a machine that hasn't these restrictions - make some notes, etc and return to try the methods out.
2009-08-23T04:29:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	unop	That is going to be hard, I will see what I can do... University networks sooo unawesome x(
