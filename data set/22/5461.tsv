2007-08-09T09:11:00.000Z	larsemil	neverblue	i klnow. how do i get it to start automaticly? i did put it in sessions
2007-08-09T09:11:00.000Z	neverblue	larsemil	it does start automatically on everyone else's install
2007-08-09T09:11:00.000Z	larsemil	neverblue	nevermind.
2007-08-09T09:51:00.000Z	neverblue	larsemil	u may want to
2007-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	larsemil	neverblue	could that be the reason its so buggy/crashy?
2007-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	neverblue	larsemil	you have a 32bit processor?
2007-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	larsemil	neverblue	no 64.. but a 32bit install
2007-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	neverblue	larsemil	that configuration is just fine
2007-08-09T09:53:00.000Z	neverblue	larsemil	a 64bit system doesnt require a 64bit OS
