2005-04-06T06:36:00.000Z	Absenth	Seveas	no problem.  I just want to archive an old "my documents" directory.

2005-09-13T12:42:00.000Z	Absenth	Seveas	so the items moved to Deferred, aren't going to make it into Breezy?
2005-09-13T12:43:00.000Z	Seveas	Absenth	correct
2005-09-13T13:01:00.000Z	Absenth	Seveas	I figure being forsaken, probibly leads to core dumps :)
2005-09-28T12:52:00.000Z	Seveas	Absenth	try kubuntu-desktop
2005-09-28T13:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Absenth	pine isn't free either
2005-09-28T13:58:00.000Z	Absenth	Seveas	what license do they use for pine?
2005-09-28T13:59:00.000Z	Absenth	Seveas	so it's perfectly legal and free to install and use pine/pico after the fact, but without putting a bunch of notices in the ubuntu installer, they can't be included. is that what I'm getting for the U-Washington site?
2005-09-28T14:08:00.000Z	Seveas	Absenth	linspire is a spawn of the devil himself...
2005-09-28T14:09:00.000Z	Absenth	Seveas	it is, but that doesn't make it any less EASY to use.
2005-09-28T14:09:00.000Z	Seveas	Absenth	it's also very easy to screw up
2005-09-28T14:09:00.000Z	Absenth	Seveas	much like windows :)
2005-09-28T14:30:00.000Z	Seveas	Absenth	apt-get install libqt3c102-mt
