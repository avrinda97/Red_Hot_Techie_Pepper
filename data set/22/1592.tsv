2010-03-27T08:25:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-		Is it possible to install Ubuntu 9.10 with grub1, not grub2?
2010-03-27T08:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	yes
2010-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	Ahh nice. Is there any special means to do so?
2010-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	it's on the minimal iso (and maybe the alternate, dunno)
2010-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	agreed
2010-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	Hmmm. Not on the server ISO?
2010-03-27T08:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	i am not 100% sure, i always used the minimal iso
2010-03-27T08:27:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	i use the minimal iso and then install the server kernel
2010-03-27T08:27:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	same end effect with less wasted downloading
2010-03-27T08:27:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	heh
2010-03-27T08:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	i don't use on server personally, have you looked into other distros?
2010-03-27T08:30:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	Yes, of course. Debian and OpenSUSE.
2010-03-27T08:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	curious, what drew you to ubuntu for a server over those or others?
2010-03-27T08:31:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	Slightly more current software versions, in some cases where it can matter.
2010-03-27T08:31:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	Though, With Debian 6 coming fairly soonish, that might change. ;)
2010-03-27T08:31:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	i'll agree that sometimes you do need something newer than lenny, but when squeeze becomes stable that will be fixed (for now lol)
2010-03-27T08:32:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	Yeaaah. heh
2010-03-27T08:32:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	what about gentoo? i've ran it on my server and it was wonderful
2010-03-27T08:32:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	Don't even go there.
2010-03-27T08:32:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	I manage 30+ gentoo servers at work.
2010-03-27T08:32:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	blakkheim	because my dept manager's roomate suggested Gentoo to him.
2010-03-27T08:34:00.000Z	blakkheim	Psi-Jack-	i always miss package slots when using something else on a server
