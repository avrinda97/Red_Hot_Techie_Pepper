2009-02-25T17:06:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	thanks
2009-02-25T17:06:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	: is it i686 or i386
2009-02-25T17:08:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	I'm not sure. The 32-bit .iso file is labeled as i386, but the kernel reports as i686.
2009-02-25T17:08:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	What is it you're looking to download?
2009-02-25T17:09:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	: I want to download bochs
2009-02-25T17:09:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	There's a bochs package in Ubuntu's universe repository, you know.
2009-02-25T17:12:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	: i know that but i want to use pint \os in which instructions are given that the distribution along with operating system has bugs so it need to install manually
2009-02-25T17:13:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	i have send u the response have u read it
2009-02-25T17:14:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-02-25T17:14:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	this is the link http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_12.html#SEC164
2009-02-25T17:14:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	: i am using 8.10
2009-02-25T17:15:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, since you have specific patches you need to apply, you can't use the repository version. Yeah, you should be fine using the version on bochs' website.
2009-02-25T17:22:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	yes i downloaded the .rpm file but it is not opening saying the archeiving format is not supported
2009-02-25T17:23:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	You downloaded the wrong file. You want the .tar.gz file, not the .rpm.
2009-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	does i need to install from source code
2009-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	Follow the instructions in the pages you linked to me. Patching and compilation of software according to instructions provided by someone else is outside of the bounds of on-topicness for this channel.
2009-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	I'd imagine so, yes.
2009-02-25T17:30:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	ok at least send me a good link for this because i am new to linux
2009-02-25T17:31:00.000Z	rww	dinesh372	Again, if you're following someone else's instructions, you'll need to talk to them about it, not me.
2009-02-25T17:32:00.000Z	dinesh372	rww	ok thanks
