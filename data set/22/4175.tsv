2008-02-27T19:26:00.000Z	mohamed		anybody there to tell me about solving problem in external hdd
2008-02-27T19:26:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	it depends on what the problem is....
2008-02-27T19:27:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	what is the problem with the drive?
2008-02-27T19:29:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	can you look in your /etc/fstab and see if the drive is listed? For example, if it's mounted on /media disk, see if /media/disk is in your fstab?
2008-02-27T19:31:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	go to a terminal and type less /etc/fstab. when you're done looking at it, q quits
2008-02-27T19:32:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	do you see /media/disk (or /media/anything?)
2008-02-27T19:33:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	ok...it's a USB drive, right?
2008-02-27T19:34:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	can you type ls /dev/sd  and then hit the tab key twice and tell me what it says?
2008-02-27T19:36:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	ok...whatever. That's weird. Try this: Go into gconf-editor and navigate to /system/storage/default_options/vfat/mount_options , and then remove the "usefree" option from the list. Exit gconf-editor, and try hotplugging your drive again (from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=582045)
2008-02-27T19:37:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	so you need to open a terminal and type gconf-editor
2008-02-27T19:39:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	try plugging the drive in again
2008-02-27T19:39:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	does it come up?
2008-02-27T19:40:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	ok, that's good...did it automount the drive?
2008-02-27T19:41:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	go to Panel -> Places -> computer and see if it shows up.
2008-02-27T19:43:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	 ok. from the same web page I found this:  First I removed "usefree". It did nothing.
2008-02-27T19:49:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	hello, any luck?
2008-02-27T19:49:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	what kind of computer is it?
2008-02-27T19:50:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	laptop? Desktop?
2008-02-27T19:50:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	ok...some laptops have issues with USB...that's not your problem though
2008-02-27T19:51:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	yes?
2008-02-27T19:51:00.000Z	chris0	mohamed	I'm googling....
