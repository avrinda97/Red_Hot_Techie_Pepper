2010-03-03T12:45:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		When I setup my encrypted home, it gave a rather complex passphrase, which I've lost. Can I reset this?
2010-03-03T12:46:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	you cannot
2010-03-03T12:46:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	thats the point of encryption
2010-03-03T12:47:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	as far as i know, the data cannot be recovered
2010-03-03T12:47:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	indus	I'm logged in currently, I'd need to backup ~/, format, then setup a new ~/ from scratch?
2010-03-03T12:48:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	is your home encrypted or entire /
2010-03-03T12:48:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	indus	just ~/
2010-03-03T12:49:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	all iam saying is, there is no easy way to recover ~/ or home as i call it
2010-03-03T12:49:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	even if i steal the hard disk , i dont think its possible thats what i  read
2010-03-03T12:50:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	indus	I've not lost my ~/, I'll tar it and make a new one, I guess
2010-03-03T12:50:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	you said you forgot passphrase
2010-03-03T12:50:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	then how will you acess it?
2010-03-03T12:51:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	indus	yes, I couldn't access it from a LiveCD, I'm currently logged in from my install
2010-03-03T12:52:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	indus	Yea, I agree.
2010-03-03T12:52:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	indus	Since I'm currently logged in on my install, can I change my passphrase?
2010-03-03T12:53:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	hmm that probably might be ,its somewhere in a file in hidden home
2010-03-03T12:53:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	wait there is a way i think

2010-03-03T12:56:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	the password is stored in some folder
2010-03-03T12:59:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	indus	I have two lines in that file, which is the correct one?
2010-03-03T13:00:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	sorry iam a noob at this , cant advice
2010-03-03T14:25:00.000Z	indus	MilitantPotato	no one
