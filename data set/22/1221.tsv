2010-08-29T05:09:00.000Z	shirtless		and that linux doens't know about that
2010-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	shirtless		best to just not buy crap hardware and cut your losses
2010-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	shirtless		right now it works ok
2010-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	shirtless		I'm using it right now.
2010-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	shirtless		I'm using the acer aspire x1300
2010-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	shirtless		I just don't plug my usb headphones in and I hope the usb ports don't die on me.
2010-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	shirtless		plus I am only using one usb port because of my KVM switch multiplexing mouse and keyboard over one port
2010-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	shirtless		so I think it's less risky ;)
2010-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	shirtless		less ports to die on me.
2010-08-29T05:12:00.000Z	shirtless		I'd like to be able to fix bugs in the kernel, but by the time I learn how linux will probably have been destroyed by a global nuclear war
2010-08-29T05:14:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shirtless	 you found that package already? it gives you most of the stuff you need for compiling things
2010-08-29T05:15:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	???
2010-08-29T05:15:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	I didn't actually need any help, but thank you ;)
2010-08-29T05:16:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shirtless	 yeah, ok.. I was compiling kernels in slackware more than ten years ago.. I'm over it now ;)
2010-08-29T05:16:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	me too
2010-08-29T05:16:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	I compile it only if I must.. I hate it
2010-08-29T05:17:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	I wish I could be a kernel dev, but I imagine by the time I had the skills linux will be destroyed by global nuclear war, along with earth
2010-08-29T05:20:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	you still use 56k? or are they DSL? where do you live that you need those?
2010-08-29T05:21:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shirtless	 People that live out of town, or on a very low income and can't afford DSL
2010-08-29T05:21:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	damn, that sucks for them
2010-08-29T05:22:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	I think sooner or later everyone will have high speed internet  and it will be at the same cost as 56k or free
2010-08-29T05:22:00.000Z	shirtless	zcat[1]	like, torrentfreak bought that rural town in russia, did you hear about that? they're renaming it to torrent freak and obviously everyone is going to have internets.
