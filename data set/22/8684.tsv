2005-06-14T09:30:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	if it's not in the sources it's not in the scope of this channel (:
2005-06-14T09:33:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	thats right http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/upgrade/?application=%257bec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384%257d
2005-06-14T09:34:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	ah, thats a good link, thanks
2005-06-14T09:34:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	No Probs :-)
2005-06-14T09:36:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	can you help me try and sort this problem out?
2005-06-14T09:37:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	the one with firefox versions?
2005-06-14T09:38:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	No what it is, im using ubuntuguide to install software that it shows how to install , but when i apt-get the software it cant be found even though i have all the repos that they say you should have.
2005-06-14T09:38:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	even with multiverse added?
2005-06-14T09:38:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	yes
2005-06-14T09:39:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	heres the sources list i have http://ubuntuguide.org/sample/sources.list_extrarepositories
2005-06-14T09:40:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	i've run into that regarding some specific software aswell.. can't tell why though
2005-06-14T09:41:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	what package are you missing? I was able to get mplayer and such thruogh multiverse
2005-06-14T09:42:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	ive apt-cache searched them too. wont find anything.
2005-06-14T09:42:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	oh yeah.. all non-free packages
2005-06-14T09:42:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	the new sun java is only availible on their web site
2005-06-14T09:42:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	flashplayer i believe that firefox can download automagically
2005-06-14T09:43:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	and w32codecs is better to get the new ones directly from mplayerhq.hu
2005-06-14T09:43:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	 i know i could do all tht but i just thought it was weird how the guide was showing you how to do it when you cant,
2005-06-14T09:44:00.000Z	chol	osiris_	i haven't read the guide at all.. i installed ubuntu to have a fairly complete base install done fast but then i have done everything else the old debian way :)
2005-06-14T09:45:00.000Z	osiris_	chol	ok, cool
