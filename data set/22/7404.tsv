2006-04-04T12:28:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	elsvent	add the repo line, and then look for the fgrlx one with your kernel
2006-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	elsvent	Biscuitian_Warhe	oh u mean first method?
2006-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	elsvent	No, not the repo default driver, add Seveas's repo to apt (synaptic) and reload the info
