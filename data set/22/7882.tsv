2005-12-04T09:20:00.000Z	nalioth	subgud	ppc uses yaboot
2005-12-04T09:20:00.000Z	subgud	nalioth	i know... cant figure out a way to boot the os low-level through yaboot either
2005-12-04T09:21:00.000Z	nalioth	subgud	to open firmware, you mean?
2005-12-04T09:21:00.000Z	subgud	nalioth	no... just booting ubuntu at root lvl to reset the password
2005-12-04T09:22:00.000Z	nalioth	subgud	ah, i see. i dont know if that option exists with yaboot
2005-12-04T09:22:00.000Z	nalioth	subgud	i've never seen it, or the entry in yaboot.conf to enable it
2005-12-04T09:23:00.000Z	subgud	nalioth	nah... doesnt look like it... ive been looking through whatever i could find about it on the web
2005-12-04T09:23:00.000Z	subgud		doesnt look like it
2005-12-04T09:23:00.000Z	subgud	nalioth	thing is though, i think the keyboardlayout somehow messed up, cause i am pretty confident i have the right password
2005-12-04T09:24:00.000Z	subgud		just dont know how to access anything without being able to login
2005-12-04T09:24:00.000Z	nalioth	subgud	get a livecd and chroot into your installed version
2005-12-04T09:25:00.000Z	subgud	nalioth	thanks... didnt even think of that actually
