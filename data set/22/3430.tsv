2009-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 what would you like firefox to use?
2009-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	nothing. I want it to present the dialog like before
2009-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 it started with an upgrade-- try running firefox -profilemanger (could be a corruption of the profile when you upgraded)
2009-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 then set your defaults in edit- preferences- applications to always ask. there
2009-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	I set it there to always ask. still launches xine. do I need to restart FF?
2009-02-24T04:48:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 not restart-- What I think has happened -- is when you upgraded-- something went bad in the firefox profile- So I suggest -- starting firefox with "firefox -profilemanger" and create a new profile and change the settings there.
2009-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	what will happen to all my bookmarks, saved passwords, prefs, etc.?
2009-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 by doing that method it will still be there-- you haven't removed them-- once you see it works then export your passwords- favorites - (I would not import your prefeences because something could be wrong there)
2009-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 to switch between the profiles you would firefox -profilemanger
2009-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	ugh that's really frustrating :-/
2009-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 Judging by what you have said - It seems as if a firefox profile is bad.
2009-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	still does it! new profile, change app->prefs, still xine
2009-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	it would seem to me then it's a gnome issue
2009-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 yes find that file type-- right click on it choose properties then open with tab and change it there.
2009-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 though with firefox there is the firefoxplugin-xine or vlc
2009-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	again I don't have the file since it's a streaming playlist. I guess I could touch file.pls then right click tho . .
2009-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 at the very bottom - Ubuntu -- Package Search Results -- firefox <http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=firefox&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=all&amp;section=all>
2009-02-24T05:00:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 I did find this addon -- MediaPlayerConnectivity :: Firefox Add-ons <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/446>
2009-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	if that does not work then another suggestion may be -- rename the .mozilla folder - then reinstall firefox using synaptic then copy the profile folder over to the new .mozilla (that is my only other suggestion)
2009-02-24T05:24:00.000Z	tripps	redvamp128	uninstalled gxine which did the trick
2009-02-27T07:41:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 that would be hard to do because of the segmented with adds
2009-02-27T07:42:00.000Z	redvamp128	tripps	 that and the segments are tripped at the end of the adds. (but I would not advise doing that)
