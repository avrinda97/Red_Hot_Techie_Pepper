2008-08-25T00:27:00.000Z	shg_sam		WHEN I TRY TO SAVE AN OPENED/EDITED FILE ON OOFFICE WRITER OR EVEN GEDIT BOTH CRAQSH OUT WITHOUT SAING
2008-08-25T00:29:00.000Z	shg_sam		well any file even with 1 character
2008-08-25T00:30:00.000Z	shg_sam		it opens but cant save
2008-08-25T00:31:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	Er... that's quite different from crashing.  What files are you editing, and more importantly, where are they?
2008-08-25T00:32:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	Where are you trying to save them?
2008-08-25T00:34:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	where are you saving the files.
2008-08-25T00:35:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	Alright, lets try another editor: open a terminal, nano ~/Documents/thisisatest, then type some arbitrary stuff, and hit ctrl-o
2008-08-25T00:38:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	ctrl-x, then ls ~/Documents | grep thisisatest
2008-08-25T00:39:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	er, sorry
2008-08-25T00:39:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	ctrl-x, then ls -l ~/Documents | grep thisisatest
2008-08-25T00:40:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	are you still in nano?
2008-08-25T00:41:00.000Z	shg_sam	Flannel	yea i m still in nano
2008-08-25T00:42:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	ctrl-x should quit, does it warn you that there's unsaved information or something? (a line across the bottom)
2008-08-25T00:43:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	nano shouldn't be beeping at you
2008-08-25T00:44:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	yes, you've said that.  Alright, ctrl-c, which should close it.
2008-08-25T00:46:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	not ctrl -c, hold control and push the c button
2008-08-25T00:47:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	yes
2008-08-25T00:51:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	Alright, so now we'll see if that file exists:  ls -l ~/Documents | grep thisisatest
2008-08-25T00:53:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	Alright, does this command return anything: touch ~/Documents/thisisatest
2008-08-25T00:54:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	Alright, now, ls -l ~/Documents | grep thisisatest
2008-08-25T00:57:00.000Z	Flannel	shg_sam	Indeed.  The question then becomes, why can't any editors write?  If I had to guess, I'd say its a filesystem issue (since its not a permission issue).  Try this: `sudo touch /forcefsck` and then reboot.  That'lll fsck everything, and we'll see if we come up with any issues.
