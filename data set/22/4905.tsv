2008-04-04T02:06:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	and why use ubuntu and not debian ?
2008-04-04T02:06:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	a very good question
2008-04-04T02:07:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	1. ubuntu is more cutting edge 2. debian is for full fledged servers 3. ubuntu has tons of more support 4. ubuntu is HIP!!!
2008-04-04T02:07:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	did i mention it was easier
2008-04-04T02:08:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	what is HIP!!!
2008-04-04T02:08:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	cool; in vogue; stylish;
2008-04-04T02:09:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	trust me if u are using a desktop u need ubuntu
2008-04-04T02:09:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	plus sometime the kernel used in debian is a little too old to support latest hardware
2008-04-04T02:09:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	and u dont wanna modify ur install if u r a newbie
2008-04-04T02:09:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	i use fedora/redhat for abut 5 years or more but find i need something new i need it for my laptop
2008-04-04T02:10:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	ubuntu will suit u plenty fine
2008-04-04T02:10:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	but sometime i need to install server things for testing only
2008-04-04T02:11:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	sure i need Apache mysql ;)
2008-04-04T02:11:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	no prob ubuntu is also a server os, u just need to add the debs u need
2008-04-04T02:11:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	u have both of em on ubuntu
2008-04-04T02:12:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	i will let follow u. and will remove my debian with ubuntu and give it try ;)
2008-04-04T02:13:00.000Z	ItchyHoBo	my007ms	u wont regret it
2008-04-04T02:13:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	the most bad thing i face in debian was it's old gnome only xchat old .. etc ;)
2008-04-04T02:13:00.000Z	my007ms	ItchyHoBo	i have to use testing things to get new things
