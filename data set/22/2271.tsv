2009-07-30T21:25:00.000Z	NewfierRich		Whiter: Did you clear all private data in the preferences?  You can also set it do delete all private data when you close out fire fox which is kinda nice
2009-07-30T21:25:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	yes
2009-07-30T21:26:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	what is coming up that you don't want? something in the address bar or a text box...
2009-07-30T21:30:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	I use my computer for both personal and buisness stuff... I don't like being in front of clients and using Firefox and having my personally frequented websites polupating the drop down list
2009-07-30T21:33:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	do you have any of these sites bookmarked? firefox will bring up bookmarks in the address bar as well
2009-07-30T21:36:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	checking to see if they are bookmarked
2009-07-30T21:57:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	did you ever figure it out?
2009-07-30T21:59:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	Yeah... FF automaticly adds bookmarks to the location bar drop down list
2009-07-30T21:59:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	Ok cool
2009-07-30T22:00:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	ff 3.5 might have an option to turn this off
2009-07-30T22:08:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	I found a solution
2009-07-30T22:09:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	in you address bar type in about:config
2009-07-30T22:11:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	is there a toggle burried in the about:config somewhere ?
2009-07-30T22:11:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	I had to makea change here to get my backspace key working again too :)
2009-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	trying now
2009-07-30T22:14:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	I'm on 8.10 with ff 3.0.12 ... I don't think I have this entry
2009-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	nevermind that last stmt
2009-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	ok :D
2009-07-30T22:18:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	did that do the job?
2009-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	I think I'm going to try and get a later vs of ff on this machine ... I've hearrd that ff 3.5 behaves differently here
2009-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	Whitor	NewfierRich	thats though, I really appreciate your suggestions
2009-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	NewfierRich	Whitor	np, sorry it didn't help. it worked for me :S
