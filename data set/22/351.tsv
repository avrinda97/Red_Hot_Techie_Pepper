2012-02-14T01:46:00.000Z	Guest75773		and install it to the hardrive
2012-02-14T01:46:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	 you can use unetbootin
2012-02-14T01:46:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2012-02-14T01:48:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	 you can use your own iso. just download the regular ubuntu iso file and use unetbootin with that to make a live usb
2012-02-14T01:52:00.000Z	Guest75773	meskarune	Does this work on a sandisk cruzer usb?
2012-02-14T01:55:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	as long as your usb is formated correctly, it will work on any usb drive :P
2012-02-14T01:55:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	also don't fllood the channel. have some patience. :P
2012-02-14T01:57:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	 your usb drive should be formated as fat32
2012-02-14T01:57:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	 windows has disk tools to do that
2012-02-14T01:57:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	most likely it already is fat32. use the disk tools on windows to check
2012-02-14T02:02:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	then open unextbootin and choose the ubuntu iso file, and choose your usb device. then run it
2012-02-14T02:07:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	 you can put some space down for preserving stuff between boots. if you reboot with the usb plugged in, it should boot up ubuntu. if not, change your bios settings
2012-02-14T02:15:00.000Z	meskarune	Guest75773	go into bios and then choose boot disc usb
