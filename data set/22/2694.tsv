2009-11-16T22:11:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		I'm trying to apt-get install gnome, but it's complaining bout not being able to find gnome-desktop-environment.
2009-11-16T22:12:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		this is 9.10, after an apt-get update & upgrade
2009-11-16T22:12:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		are the repos broken?
2009-11-16T22:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NfNitLoop	Is gnome-core installed?
2009-11-16T22:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NfNitLoop	How about gnome-desktop-environment? :o
2009-11-16T22:15:00.000Z	NfNitLoop	mobi-sheep	No gnome-core, it complains about gnome-desktop-environment not being installable.
2009-11-16T22:15:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		(sorry, can't copy and paste easily at the moment since I'm stuck on the command-line.)  :p
2009-11-16T22:16:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NfNitLoop	In my case, I don't have gnome or gnome-desktop-environment installed and yet I'm running Gnome.
2009-11-16T22:17:00.000Z	NfNitLoop	mobi-sheep	ah, odd package names, then.   Installing gnome-core seems to be working. Thanks.
2009-11-16T22:18:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NfNitLoop	Good. I do have gnome-core installed, also gdm. I think that is about gnome minimal as you can get. Along with few other packages.
2009-11-16T22:20:00.000Z	NfNitLoop	mobi-sheep	I installed via a server CD (all that I had) but would actually like the typical GUI gnome ubuntu install.  Is there a package somewher that will give me that?
2009-11-16T22:20:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		this is indeed very minimal. :p
2009-11-16T22:22:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		in particular -- what's the litle tool that genrally prompts you to install the non-OSS drivers to speed up graphics?   The current driver is >.<.
2009-11-16T22:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NfNitLoop	You're talking about Hardware Drivers?
2009-11-16T22:23:00.000Z	NfNitLoop	mobi-sheep	Yeah, previously when I ran the non-server Ubuntu, it would prompt me in the GUI to upgrade my drivers for better performance.
2009-11-16T22:24:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		What tool is tha?
2009-11-16T22:24:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		that*  (Oy, this keyboard!)
2009-11-16T22:24:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NfNitLoop	jockey -- Or in that case, for the GUI.... jockey-gtk
2009-11-16T22:25:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		aha, it's ubuntu-desktop.
2009-11-16T22:25:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		Found it. :)
2009-11-16T22:25:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		Thanks!
2009-11-16T22:28:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	NfNitLoop	Check your private message.
