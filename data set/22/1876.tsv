2010-09-12T22:13:00.000Z	qwert		How to bookmark a file? (As in marking a mp3 file in nautilus)
2010-09-12T22:14:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	I don't think you can do what you're trying to do; you can bookmark folders, though
2010-09-12T22:14:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	How do you bookmark a folder?
2010-09-12T22:28:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	How do you bookmark a folder?
2010-09-12T22:30:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	Didn't I already answer you?
2010-09-12T22:30:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	Umm... i guess not
2010-09-12T22:30:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	If I didn't do this: If the side pane is open (View -> Side Pane or press F9 otherwise), and it says "Places" at the top, just click and drag the folder into an empty space; if it does not say "Places", click whatever it does say and then click "Places".
2010-09-12T22:30:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	I typed that and it appeared in the log, w/e
2010-09-12T22:31:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	Okay.. thanks.. (Apologies)
2010-09-12T22:31:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	no problemo
2010-09-12T22:31:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	The other way to add a bookmark is to just press Ctrl+D
2010-09-12T22:31:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	that will bookmark the current directory
2010-09-12T22:31:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	Yeah.. thanks |X-Sleepy-X
2010-09-12T22:32:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	X-Sleepy-X: Is there a way to bookmark a file?
2010-09-12T22:32:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	X-Sleepy-X: As in starring a mp3 file ..
2010-09-12T22:34:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	Thanks
2010-09-12T22:34:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	Again, I don't think you can do that. The best thing would just to be able to put it in one place. If you want the file to just have a star next to it, right click it and go to Properties, then click the Emblems tab and check the box next to the Favorite star icon
2010-09-12T22:34:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	(Sorry again :) )
2010-09-12T22:34:00.000Z	qwert	velociostrich	Thanks bye
2010-09-12T22:34:00.000Z	velociostrich	qwert	no need to apologize
