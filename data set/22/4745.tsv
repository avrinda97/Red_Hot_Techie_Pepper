2007-10-21T10:05:00.000Z	simplyubuntu		has anyone here ussed the alternate install cd to install??
2007-10-21T10:07:00.000Z	simplyubuntu		i need to know why the upgrade wants to download files even though i said not to! help!
2007-10-21T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	because you have apps that require stuff that's not on the cd
2007-10-21T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	yes?
2007-10-21T10:16:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	not really. a release needs to be upgraded as a whole, not piecemeal
2007-10-21T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	told you that already ;)
2007-10-21T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	yes, but you'll most likely end up with a borked or broken install
2007-10-21T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	why exactly are you not wanting to download stuff?
2007-10-21T10:21:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	nickrud	because i live in pakistan and it takes me about 11 hours to download 700 mb!
2007-10-21T10:22:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	ah. A very good reason. I lived at the bottom of a tiny pipe also, had to run the install over a couple of nights.
2007-10-21T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	because they aren't all on the platter. If you installed any kde apps, for example, that will pull down a load of packages
2007-10-21T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	and possibly that list of 1400 might be misleading, apt doesn't differentiate between apps on the cd and on the net
2007-10-21T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	no, I did have a decent power grid ;)
2007-10-21T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	there you go, maybe uninstalling any apps you don't want will help.
2007-10-21T10:26:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	stickville, California
2007-10-21T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	dialup, yes, about 3k. And We got local radio stations on the phone line :)
2007-10-21T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	absolutely. It will pick up the download from where it left off. Did that a lot
2007-10-21T10:31:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	and you can invoke apt-get dist-upgrade --download-only to ensure it is only downloading
2007-10-21T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	you'll have to remove a lot of stuff to avoid downloading stuff
2007-10-21T10:54:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	yes
2007-10-21T10:55:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	no, it will resume downloading where it left off.
2007-10-21T10:55:00.000Z	nickrud	simplyubuntu	no different that ctl-c in apt-get upgrade (during download phase)
