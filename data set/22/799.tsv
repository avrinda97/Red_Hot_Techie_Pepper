2011-03-12T00:41:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop		well, a question in #php got me thinking about it. if php needs to call a shell script to do some stuff (and by some stuff, i mean something that only a su could do), what would be necessary to accomplish that safely.
2011-03-12T00:41:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop		ie. you could give apache su permissions, but that's just asking for trouble
2011-03-12T00:41:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop		so i was trying to figure a way to do it safely
2011-03-12T00:43:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop		so it has a bad rep because it's being used improperly :P
2011-03-12T00:43:00.000Z	brontosaurusrexw	bittyx-laptop	an example?
2011-03-12T00:44:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	an example of what? php being used improperly?
2011-03-12T00:44:00.000Z	brontosaurusrexw	bittyx-laptop	yes
2011-03-12T00:45:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	well i dunno, for example, if you hang out in #php, a lot of newbies come and paste their code asking for help. half of that code is full of sql injection possibilities. sometimes they just call eval on something a user does, or shell_exec in a way that enables a user to start anything they want
2011-03-12T00:46:00.000Z	brontosaurusrexw	bittyx-laptop	ok
2011-03-12T00:47:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	any specific reason you've asked?
2011-03-12T00:48:00.000Z	brontosaurusrexw	bittyx-laptop	just that people keep talking about silly newbs, while it appears to me that high level language should not really have low-level injection bugs possible, so to me it looks more like silly php in the 1st place
2011-03-12T00:50:00.000Z	brontosaurusrexw	bittyx-laptop	on the other hand, the very high level methods are so fricking abstract that most noobs will not understand them, or should i say non-professional coders
2011-03-12T00:50:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	what? do you think php should, for example automatically escape user input? i consider myself a relatively experienced programmer, and i wouldn't want my language to do this for me.
2011-03-12T00:50:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	and if you really need such stuff, there are plenty of libraries that'll do that for you
2011-03-12T00:51:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	apart from manually protecting yourself of course
2011-03-12T00:52:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	i mean, the methods do exactly what they say. also, the man pages mostly mention the exploit possibilities (ie. they warn you to watch out for stuff). so it's mostly people not paying attention/reading thoroughly.
2011-03-12T00:53:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	and sure, php has bugs as well, but most languages do
2011-03-12T00:54:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	also, apps/companies that need high security should hire a dedicated security expert anyway, since it's a rather different discipline from programming in general
2011-03-12T00:55:00.000Z	brontosaurusrexw	bittyx-laptop	well anyway, may latest 'app' got like 10000 unique hits in a year and its still up, so i have some basic clues....
2011-03-12T00:57:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	i didn't say anything about you, i'm just speaking in general.
2011-03-12T01:00:00.000Z	brontosaurusrexw	bittyx-laptop	yeah, iam saying that things are lots of times very different that my appear from forums/chats, for example the other day i was trying to figure out why my international domain (unicode domain) is geting punnycode display in firefox, at the end i trashed directly to main country registrar and mozilla fundation not having a correct deal, so call me a noob editing apache till 3 in the morning ;)
2011-03-12T01:04:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	brontosaurusrexw	yeah, but there are a lot of articles on at least a basic level of security. not bothering to read these (even though most tutorials will mention them) is just being ignorant.
