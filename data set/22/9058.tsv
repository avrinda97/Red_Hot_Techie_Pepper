2005-03-22T07:02:00.000Z	gdh	thoreauputic	Oooh that exists as a project?
2005-03-22T07:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	sure, read the /topic :)
2005-03-22T07:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	sorry

2005-03-22T07:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	heh - thought I'd better find it after my mistake over /topic ;-)
2005-03-22T07:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	it was in the topic a day or two ago
2005-03-22T07:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	you want Symantec to go out of business ?  *grin*

2005-03-22T07:12:00.000Z	gdh	thoreauputic	<conspiracy theory about the major AV and Anti-spam vendors running their own botnets to perpetuate their businesses>
2005-03-22T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	not hugely different, but Ubuntu made my sound "just work" on this machine, after much fiddling with Alsa on Debian
2005-03-22T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	don't use debian packages
2005-03-22T07:15:00.000Z	gdh	thoreauputic	OKie :)
2005-03-22T07:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	essentially everything is available from the universe repository i Ubuntu

2005-03-22T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	"multiverse" is kind of like "debian non-free"
2005-03-22T07:18:00.000Z	gdh	thoreauputic	Interesting :) lots of new terminology to deal with...
2005-03-22T08:17:00.000Z	gdh	thoreauputic	LOL - no tea and crumpets until the case is solved, now! :)
2005-05-10T07:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gdh	does netcraft confirm it ;-) ?
