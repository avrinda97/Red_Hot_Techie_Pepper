2006-06-02T08:05:00.000Z	lufis		Is there any hope for running XGL/Compiz on a crappy, onboard video card?
2006-06-02T08:05:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	Yes, as it doesn't require too much power
2006-06-02T08:05:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	Really?
2006-06-02T08:06:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	Any idea how old the mainboard is or how much RAM (shared probably) it uses (the GPU I mean)
2006-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	The mobo's about 4 years old, 300-something MB or ram
2006-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	That's overkill for XGL!
2006-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	Really? Sweet!
2006-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	You just need to turn on 3D acceleration (sorry, I only have experience with ati and nvidia)
2006-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	That is the window manager not loading (run "metacity")
2006-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	Are you sure? I thought I had metacity listed
2006-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	Well metacity is the program which draws the titlebars
2006-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	What about gdm?
2006-06-07T15:55:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	GDM only handles the login and keeping the actual X session going. It is run by root for the system and has nothing to do with everyday user stuff
2006-06-07T15:55:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	Hm, thanks. Maybe that's why :)
2006-06-08T09:23:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	Ermmm... In /?
2006-06-08T09:23:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	:-p Well, it isn't there. I'm installing an app and want to be sure
2006-06-08T09:24:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	It is for "optional" stuff. Mainly Ubuntu uses /usr for packaged stuff and /usr/local for locally built source code. /opt isn't really used by Ubuntu (but I use it for Sancho GUI which I converted from RPM)
2006-07-28T06:28:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	Maybe your preferences?
2006-07-28T06:28:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	I don't believe so. It was doing it by default
2006-07-28T06:29:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	Besides, it isn't per-application. Every video player plays all video files with washed-out colors and way too much brightness
2006-07-28T06:30:00.000Z	Warbo	lufis	Still, gconf-editor has a few settings for Totem, and MPlayer and VLC have loads of options
2006-07-28T06:30:00.000Z	lufis	Warbo	Yes, but it isn't any of my prefs. It's been doing it since a clean install.
