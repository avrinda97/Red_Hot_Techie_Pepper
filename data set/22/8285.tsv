2005-10-10T12:08:00.000Z	winner		i'm trying to play music off of my iPod that is mounted. i just want to play songs off of it, but i don't want to copy them onto my computer.
2005-10-10T12:08:00.000Z	winner		and gals :)
2005-10-10T12:08:00.000Z	winner		i was wondering if anyone could help me with that
2005-10-10T12:09:00.000Z	winner		Rhythmbox sees my iPod
2005-10-10T12:10:00.000Z	winner		ah
2005-10-10T12:10:00.000Z	winner		well how would i go around to play music off it?
2005-10-10T12:11:00.000Z	cafuego_	winner	I don't know what you can, at all. Tried 'gtkpod' ?
2005-10-10T12:12:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	ah, yes, gtkpod. will it overwrite my current iPod library? i want to be still be able to sync it through iTunes (Windows)
2005-10-10T12:12:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	of course, without losing my current songs inside.
2005-10-10T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	winner	it won't overwrite it if you don't tell it to do that. Note that clicking "Inititlise iPod" IS telling it to wipe stuff ;-)
2005-10-10T12:16:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	=o
2005-10-10T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	winner	let me steal my wife's pod and check.
2005-10-10T12:19:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	let me know when you get it :)
2005-10-10T12:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	winner	It's sorting 7000 tracks,  this might take a whole.
2005-10-10T12:21:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	okay. let me know if it finishes.
2005-10-10T12:22:00.000Z	cafuego_	winner	Anyway, it's not wiping anything.
2005-10-10T12:22:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	okay. phew.
2005-10-10T12:23:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	im worried because i performed a iTunesDB rebuild thing with this python script on my shuffle and the shuffle became uselss under iTunes
2005-10-10T12:23:00.000Z	winner	cafuego_	like, it would show up, but attempts to drag songs onto it wouldn't work. it'll show up as empty no matter what.
2005-10-10T12:34:00.000Z	cafuego_	winner	Hmm, gtkpod can't play them.
2005-10-10T12:52:00.000Z	cafuego_	winner	Aha! rhythmbox play music off my iPod now.
