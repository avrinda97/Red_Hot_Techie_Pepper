2005-09-08T05:08:00.000Z	ompaul	norhted	I am happy and unhappy with your situation, unhappy cos I can't give you an answer and happy because I don't run that other stuff :) however that being said there is an example which includes a thing called chainloader in the menu.lst so make sure you have all that example in there
2005-09-08T05:08:00.000Z	ompaul	norhted	with the changes that you spoke about
2005-09-08T05:08:00.000Z	norhted	ompaul	:)

2005-09-08T05:11:00.000Z	ompaul	norhted	please paste the whole menu.lst
