2008-05-03T10:32:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	are you sure that that was't you?
2008-05-03T10:33:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	I am sure I do not have double personality... ...
2008-05-03T10:33:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	it could be a security vulnerability in AMSN
2008-05-03T10:34:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	I thougth some like that. But how can I know it?
2008-05-03T10:34:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	does the same thing happen if you run AMSN again and do similar things happen to anything else?
2008-05-03T10:38:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	I have just experienced once. But I do not want to experience it again
2008-05-03T10:38:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	It was not funny...
2008-05-03T10:38:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	try using something other than AMSN
2008-05-03T10:39:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	I am using Mercury ... I think It is better than amsn, I lost the curiosity for this 2 years ago but I've back
2008-05-03T10:40:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	are you using a router?
2008-05-03T10:40:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	or any other type of firewall?
2008-05-03T10:41:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	yeah I think something about. But I am new user of routers.
2008-05-03T10:42:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	if you're behind a router or another type of firewall, that should stop a lot of breakins
2008-05-03T10:42:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	Idid not understand tou
2008-05-03T10:43:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	the router should help keep you safe from people hacking into your computer.  Firewalls will do the same thing
2008-05-03T10:44:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	You mean I do not need another firewall?
2008-05-03T10:44:00.000Z	Starnestommy	fraroco	more firewalls tends to make things safer, but a router is usually enough
2008-05-03T10:45:00.000Z	fraroco	Starnestommy	I will true!!
