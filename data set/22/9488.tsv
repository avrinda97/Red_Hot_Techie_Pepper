2005-07-10T13:35:00.000Z	Mestapheles		sh*t that unofficial starter guide has a gapping hole.  No printer instructions for the newbie, however it is with gnome-cups-manager
2005-07-10T13:35:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Mestapheles	 system->administration->printers add new printer
2005-07-10T13:35:00.000Z	Mestapheles		I know that
2005-07-10T13:35:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		pick local, detected printer, model, and set it to do letter instead of A4 in the printer properties.
2005-07-10T13:36:00.000Z	Mestapheles		but do you know how to add a printer without gnome?
2005-07-10T13:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Mestapheles	 localhost:631 but that's disabled in ubuntu.
2005-07-10T13:36:00.000Z	Mestapheles		as last time I checked the web interface was disabled
2005-07-10T13:36:00.000Z	Mestapheles		yes
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		kde should have a printer manager in the system configuration
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	Mestapheles		so I'll have to apt-get install gnome-cups-manager onto my minimal install
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	Mestapheles		thanks
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Mestapheles	 how are you without gnome?  Kshutubuntu?
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		oh
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		you have a minimal install
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		hmm.
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	Mestapheles		I just want to use xfce4
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Mestapheles	 ask how to enable the web interface in some channel, heh techii may know how.
2005-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	Mestapheles		I hardly use any gnome specific features,
2005-07-10T13:40:00.000Z	Mestapheles	techii	/etc/cups ? will do
2005-07-10T13:40:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Mestapheles	 #gentoo may know how to reconfigure cups to allow web interface on 127.0.0.1 (yes lots of non-gentoo questions get asked there)
2005-07-10T13:40:00.000Z	Mestapheles		thanks guys
2005-07-10T13:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	Mestapheles	 or #cups
