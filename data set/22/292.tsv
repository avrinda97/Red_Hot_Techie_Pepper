2012-01-20T13:09:00.000Z	Peppe__		Hi, I have managed to F***Up my grafics drivers in ubuntu. I had a problem with ubuntu not detecting higer resolutions than 640x480 for my new Marantz AV receiver, so I got a bit carried away and removed the the current nvidia drivers in synaptic, (and rebboted). Now i obviosly don't have any driver for my grafics card, is there an easy way to completely reinstall the default ubuntu grafics drivers, so i can start from a clean slate?
2012-01-20T13:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	what is the output of:   sudo lshw -C display; lsb_release -a     please use http://pastie.org   to host the output (or similar)
2012-01-20T13:15:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	I'm currently at work, I was hopping that you could run something like, remover xorg/drivers etc and then use apt-get to reinstall default ones, i.e to get back to default ubuntu drivers. (Could you enable additional drivers from commandline?)
2012-01-20T13:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	if you can give the output of the command, we can advise
2012-01-20T13:17:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	okay, I will have to get back to you later, I don't curently have access to the computer..
2012-01-20T13:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	I'd suggest you try:  sudo apt-get install nvidia-current    as a first call
2012-01-20T13:21:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	thanks i will try it. One more thing, i guess that apt-get install nvidia-current will give my x-swat version of nvidia, has this repo is enabled in synaptic. I would really like to try the additional/restricted drivers that comes with ubuntu 11.10, can i install these from commandline as well?
2012-01-20T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	not by default, if you added the ppa then yes
2012-01-20T13:28:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	maybe you could advise me on how to solve my first problem, i.e. the one that made me become stupid and remove the driver in the first place. I just received my new marantz-reciver yesterday, and connected the hdmi, and i could only select 640x480 resolutions. I tried adding resolutions with modline xrander, but only got could not read gamma -something something. Is there a way to enable the the option to choose from a
2012-01-20T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	nvidia-settings will let you set resolutions. You should be ableto use the nouveau driver or even the nv driver, both are in a default install.
2012-01-20T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	you could even blacklist the nouveau driver and use the nv driver
2012-01-20T13:31:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	the problem was that i really could not set any resolution higher than 640x480 in nvidia-settings, no such options in the dropdown, and xrander stated the same..
2012-01-20T13:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	install nvidia-current and you can set higher resolutions. If your monitor is cheap and not reportin EDID, you may need an xorg.cof file
2012-01-20T13:35:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	the strange thing is that my TV/monitor is crapy, but if i had it connected to the computer directly i could choose among many more resolutions. But when i connected it through the new av (marantz 1602) i could only set 640x480...
2012-01-20T13:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	once you get the nvidia driver in, you can run:   sudo nvidia-xconfig    and it will make an xorg.conf file for you, you can then run:  gksudo nvidia-settings  and set a resolutions. if one you desire is not present just set it to something then click 'Save to X config file', you can then run:  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    and change the resolution as you wish
2012-01-20T13:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	if you get no desktop, simply boot to root recovery mode and rename the file
2012-01-20T13:40:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	okay thanks, sorry for being a bit stupid. But by gksudo nvidia-settings  and set a resolutions, do you mean that i should have all possible resolutions in a dropdown list, or should i manually add them?
2012-01-20T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	you will have some, but if not, you can manually set it in xorg.conf
2012-01-20T13:41:00.000Z	Peppe__	ActionParsnip	do you maybe have an example xorg that i could look at, i guess its more to it than just add 1024x768?
2012-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peppe__	I can show you mine if you want. My stupid TV sets 300 x 300 dpi and some super fine res, makes the desktop unusale. let me pastebin
