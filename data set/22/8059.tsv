2005-10-27T16:43:00.000Z	Bieleke		[Chameleon] , i understand, but the server is there for a reason, to store everything on it except the os
2005-10-27T16:44:00.000Z	Bieleke		so if you hd is gone, your /home is gone, and i want to avoid that
2005-10-27T16:46:00.000Z	Bieleke		[Chameleon] , ok... will do that

2005-10-27T12:29:00.000Z	Bieleke		seems there is something wrong with the connect to server module in the location menu

2005-10-27T12:44:00.000Z	Lathiat	Bieleke	that means passive mode isnt supported by the xbox server
