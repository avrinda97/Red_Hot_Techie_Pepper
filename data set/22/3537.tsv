2009-02-19T02:59:00.000Z	guntbert	hlm	for viewing/editing any editor, for compiling you will need build-essential (including g++)
2009-02-19T03:01:00.000Z	hlm	guntbert	thanks, but I need to compile this C++ into a native windows executable for a friend
2009-02-19T03:02:00.000Z	guntbert	hlm	then you need a so called cross-compiler, but thats beyond me
2009-02-19T03:04:00.000Z	guntbert	hlm	try "cross compiler linux" in google

2009-02-19T03:08:00.000Z	hlm	guntbert	I usually have to send my message three times before getting assistance
2009-02-19T03:15:00.000Z	guntbert	hlm	that depends on the choosen update-server, you can change that
2009-02-19T03:15:00.000Z	hlm	guntbert	im using the system default, any idea what I should be getting?
