2010-05-18T06:18:00.000Z	rosco_y		Is there a gui for adding mounts to fstab?
2010-05-18T06:19:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	No, don't you think there should be though?  It would make a lot of sense!
2010-05-18T06:19:00.000Z	rosco_y	edbian	totally, I hate that file
2010-05-18T06:19:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	I can help you edit it.  I've used it before
2010-05-18T06:20:00.000Z	rosco_y	edbian	I've got an 80 gig hd /dev/sda1 that I manually mount in /mnt/sda1 everytime I boot up...I'd really appreciate the help
2010-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	pastebin your /etc/fstab as it is now.  Have you attempted adding a line to it?
2010-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	rosco_y	edbian	I've tried to get it working in the past, and I've been all over the board, even locked up my system at boot-up :(
2010-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	Ha ha we won't do that
2010-05-18T06:23:00.000Z	rosco_y	edbian	my fstab: http://pastebin.com/c6S8mvR3
2010-05-18T06:24:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	I don't see an attempt at a line for your /dev/sda1  Do you want me to write one and send it to you or do you want me to teach you?
2010-05-18T06:24:00.000Z	rosco_y	edbian	Sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, I haven't attempted to edit my fstab after my last upgrade to 10.04
2010-05-18T06:25:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	That's ok.  I don't care.  Do you want me to just write it or do you want me to teach you?
2010-05-18T06:26:00.000Z	rosco_y	edbian	maybe if you can correct it and give me the two-cent explaination...I think I'll catch on over time...?
2010-05-18T06:26:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	What's your /mnt point?
2010-05-18T06:27:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	What is the file system?  ext4  ?
2010-05-18T06:27:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	Also: make sure you have full permissions on the folder /mnt/sda1
2010-05-18T06:28:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	http://pastebin.com/dW7rX4bR
2010-05-18T06:28:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	I think it's pretty self-explanatory.  Do you have any questions?
2010-05-18T06:29:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	You should be able to edit your file to look the same and it should apply the changes as soon as the file is saved.
2010-05-18T06:29:00.000Z	rosco_y	edbian	that's awesome...my big question is: "Gee whiz, why didn't I think of that?"
2010-05-18T06:30:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	No problem
2010-05-18T06:30:00.000Z	edbian	rosco_y	Glad I could help! :)
