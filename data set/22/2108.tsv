2011-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	unoob		I need help upgrading 10.04 to 10.10. Every time I try using the Update Manager I always get this error: http://pastebin.com/aPHBR1hT. I'm on a fresh install with no unusual packages installed, so what gives?
2011-02-24T01:36:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	how long has this been happening?
2011-02-24T01:36:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	I just freshly installed today, but it has been happening ever since I originally installed 10.04
2011-02-24T01:37:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	hmm, Im not sure which is the relevant log file.  Maybe you could run do-release-upgrade to get a better error msg?
2011-02-24T01:38:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	that gives me the exact same error, and it rolls back the upgrade either way
2011-02-24T01:38:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	well, Im looking for a more detailed error
2011-02-24T01:45:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	this is the complete error I get when I try upgrading from either terminal or the gui: http://pastebin.com/gqAvnwTd
2011-02-24T01:46:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	you should check some of the files in /var/log/dist-upgrade
2011-02-24T01:48:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	maybe you could pastebin main.log?
2011-02-24T01:49:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	this is the complete main.log http://pastebin.com/rFvATchp
2011-02-24T01:50:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	well that isn't it, maybe term.log
2011-02-24T01:52:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	the term.log is empty
2011-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	apt.log?
2011-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	http://pastebin.com/AqYKCdW6
2011-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	have you ever installed updated xorg packages?
2011-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	the only thing I have done on this system since a fresh install is doing an update of what Ubuntu says should be updated, so no I don't believe so
2011-02-24T01:59:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	did you post history.log yet?
2011-02-24T02:00:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	would that be in the same directory? no such file exists
2011-02-24T02:01:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	I dunno then, that's all the files right?
2011-02-24T02:02:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	yes... so should I just download a 10.10 ISO and install that?
2011-02-24T02:02:00.000Z	ChogyDan	unoob	sure, if that works for you
2011-02-24T02:03:00.000Z	unoob	ChogyDan	not the ideal situation I was hoping for, but it'll work. thank you for trying.
