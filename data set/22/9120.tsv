2005-06-16T10:49:00.000Z	Xnalz		hmmm i have been installing ubuntu for about an hour now and the screen  turned black with one underscore just sitting at the top left of the screen, is this supposed to happen?
2005-06-16T10:49:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Install shouldn't take a whole hour.. at least.. I think not.
2005-06-16T10:50:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	but it is just sitting there, can't hear it writting data any more, should I reboot
2005-06-16T10:51:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Yeah, you might need to.  Did you burn the CD you're installing from?
2005-06-16T10:52:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Did you burn it at the highest speed your burner can use? I had issues with burning install discs at high speed. Causing errors I think.
2005-06-16T10:53:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	not sure burned at default speed
2005-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Hmmm. If you restart the install, and hit escape while it's asking you questions about your setup, you'll get a menu. You can scroll down, and near the bottom, there'll be a menu item for testing the install disc. It'll check to see if the disc is error-free.
2005-06-16T10:55:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	That was the only problem I had with installing Ubuntu.. I had errors on the disc, so I made sure to burn the disc sloooww.  2x or 3x.  That seemed to fix it.
2005-06-16T10:56:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	No problem. :)  I hope that that solves your issue. Welcome to Ubuntu!
2005-06-16T11:05:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	if there is a problem will it just stop at one point at the disc and keep spinning and sound like its aobut to overheat?
2005-06-16T11:06:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	I'm honestly not sure. But it seemign to totally freeze is a pretty good sign that something went wrong. :(
2005-06-16T11:10:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	sorry to bother ya again, just scanned it and it said the cd was fine...?
2005-06-16T11:12:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Well, if it said that, and it freezes on install at the same point every time, you'll have to find someone more knowledgable than me. One thing I did to verify that my burned copy was good was to rip an ISO image off of the disc... take an md5 sum of that ISO, and compare to the MD5 of the iso I'd burned from.  If they matched, the burn was absolutely perfect.
2005-06-16T11:12:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	will do ty
2005-06-16T11:13:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Sorry that it's been an ordeal. It was for me too, but when I finally got it installed.. I never looked back, and I totally switched to Ubuntu from Windows. :)
2005-06-16T12:19:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	That's odd. There shouldn't be a root user in Ubuntu.  Did you choose your personal user name as root?
2005-06-16T12:20:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	I think so not really, sure have been through this 4-5 times now
2005-06-16T12:24:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	yes
2005-06-16T12:24:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	It should've brought you right into GDM. odd.
2005-06-16T12:25:00.000Z	Xnalz	tkiesel	was messing around and umm I logged and it says I now have mail, with the prompt :joey@ubuntu:~$
2005-06-16T12:25:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Ohh. Try typing startx
2005-06-16T12:27:00.000Z	tkiesel	Xnalz	Beyond my current scope of expertise.
