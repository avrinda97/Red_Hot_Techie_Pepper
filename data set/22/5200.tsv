2007-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	Cusoon959		Something really odd just happened...I finished watching a TV ep and started up a new one. It came up black and white even tho it was a color video. Now, any .avi I play, no matter what player, is black and white... O_o
2007-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	Cusoon959		I've tried Totem and mplayer
2007-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	Cusoon959		so can anyone help with this?
2007-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	do you have effects turned on ? turn them off
2007-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	yeah...OK
2007-11-23T04:25:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	 compiz does not play well with video
2007-11-23T04:25:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	I turned off compiz, still happening...
2007-11-23T04:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	 no idea realy, I would suggest you reinstall the gstreamer packages but I think you better do a little search in the forum
2008-02-02T23:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	both keyboard and mouse usb ?
2008-02-02T23:08:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	No, built in. It's a laptop.
2008-02-02T23:09:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	look up your model here and see if there are any issues, also try in the forum   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2008-04-20T04:24:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	no need, the latest version is in the repos,   just open synaptic and search for webcam the pacakge is gspcaxx I beleive
2008-04-20T04:24:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	ah, thank you :)
2008-04-20T04:26:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	the only packages with spca/gscpa are gscpa-source and spca5xx-source (yes, I have universe enabled.)
2008-04-20T04:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	gscpa source I guess
2008-04-20T04:27:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	then I'm gonna have to compile it XD
2008-04-20T04:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	no , it will install
2008-04-20T04:34:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	and insatlling it from synaptic doesn' work ?
2008-04-20T04:34:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	as I said before, installing the spca5xx source package does NOT install the driver, but rather downloads the source to /usr/src/something.tar.gz. When I try to compile that source, I get the error I pastebin'd
2008-04-20T04:35:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	runing make with sudo ?
2008-04-20T04:35:00.000Z	Cusoon959	Pelo	I have tried with and without sudo. Same error.
2008-04-20T04:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Cusoon959	I have no idea, sorry,
