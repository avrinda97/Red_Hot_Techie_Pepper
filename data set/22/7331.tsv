2006-04-22T16:11:00.000Z	Warbo		hello
2006-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	Warbo		thiago: Hang on a sec
2006-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	Warbo		Does anyone know if Epiphany has GZip built in?
2006-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	Warbo		I just opened a gzip archive and it came up text
2006-04-22T16:14:00.000Z	Warbo		And I need to know if it is in gzip format.
2006-04-22T16:14:00.000Z	Warbo		Oh I'll just download it!
2006-04-22T16:15:00.000Z	Warbo		thiago: OK, the file exists for me (and it seems to for you as well) and it IS in GZip format
2006-04-22T16:17:00.000Z	Warbo		Anyone know how to use the paste thing to send someone loads of text?
2006-04-22T16:18:00.000Z	_jason	Warbo	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ , paste it there, copy the url and give it to the person
2006-04-22T08:34:00.000Z	_jason	Warbo	that can really mess up someones system
2006-04-22T08:35:00.000Z	_jason	Warbo	mplayer is in ubuntu's repos though
2006-04-27T16:47:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	I've heard frostwire mentioned but don't know what it is. (I know frost for freenet though...)
2006-04-27T08:57:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	Not his fault, but really there should have been a disclaimer on it rabe
2006-04-27T09:04:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	Will it log in without .Xauthority?
2006-04-27T09:04:00.000Z	_jason	Warbo	should create it
2006-04-27T09:04:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	OK.
2006-05-15T07:33:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	ctrl-alt-backspace log out in Dapper instead of zapping X. That's keyboard, so it sort of a command :)
2006-05-15T07:34:00.000Z	_jason	Warbo	k, I'll just do that.  Thanks Warbo, Ng, spikeb
2006-05-15T07:37:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	/etc/init.d/gdm stop then restart it from a console (you can't use restart in a graphical environment)
2006-05-15T07:38:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-panel :)
2006-06-29T05:53:00.000Z	_jason	Warbo	I believe w32codecs aren't available in ubuntu's "normal" repos
2006-06-29T05:53:00.000Z	Warbo	_jason	In Multiverse aren't they?
