2006-12-13T11:20:00.000Z	friedtofu		*temporarily use RAM as diskspace
2006-12-13T11:20:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	Are they located on the system you used to delete them? Or a remote one
2006-12-13T11:21:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	yeah, i'm on the system i used to delete it: it keeps refreshing after i delete it
2006-12-13T11:22:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	How are you going about trying to delete them.
2006-12-13T11:23:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	You should do it from the terminal so it will give you error output
2006-12-13T11:23:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	i'm still a newb... guide me, haha - commands?
2006-12-13T11:23:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	Is it a folder or a file
2006-12-13T11:25:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	i'm trying to remove a folder i shared... and it doesnt delete from the "System > Administration > Shared Folders" menu....
2006-12-13T11:26:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	ohhhhh go to properties of the folder you are trying to delete
2006-12-13T11:27:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	somewhere in there it should give you the file location/source
2006-12-13T11:28:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	oh, i'm just trying to remove it from being Shared.... not deleting the whole thing
2006-12-13T11:28:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	indeed.
2006-12-13T11:28:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	it's a learning experience, my friend.
2006-12-13T11:28:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	haha, yeah ... i was just trying to share between two computers...
2006-12-13T11:29:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	did it not work out?
2006-12-13T11:29:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	sometimes windows and linux don't like to share with eachother at first
2006-12-13T11:30:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	i was trying to share linux with linux o.O
2006-12-13T11:30:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	well its sharing now... but i needa know how to remove the shared folders afterwards.... :/
2006-12-13T11:30:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	Oh, nvm. Most people roll in here with windows-linux networking probs
2006-12-13T11:31:00.000Z	n30n	friedtofu	find the physical location of the file, not the vertial veron of it in the shared folders manager
2006-12-13T11:38:00.000Z	friedtofu	n30n	well.. i found the real folder, i click properties, i hit "do not share" i hit ok, and its still sharing
