2009-12-18T03:43:00.000Z	cr0bar		is there some application I can use to check if some of my partitions are bad?
2009-12-18T03:43:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 have you tried gparted?
2009-12-18T03:43:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 what says no partitions?
2009-12-18T03:44:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	one second
2009-12-18T03:45:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 okay... so...? lol i'm not sure what the problem is.  Can you not create partitions on the drive?

2009-12-18T03:46:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 that's normal
2009-12-18T03:46:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	has to do with how you create logical partitions
2009-12-18T03:47:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	ah, I used the livecd I think at the time to create the partitions - originally where the extended partiton is, was a primary NTFS one
2009-12-18T03:48:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 it's possible, but any time you have extended partitioning you're going to end up with that
2009-12-18T03:48:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 right
2009-12-18T03:49:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	what confused me a little, was when I tried the sabayon livecd and tried installing it, it just said the whole drive was unreadable
2009-12-18T03:49:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	it's magic and pixie dust necessary for the partitioning of your drive
2009-12-18T03:49:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	where may I procure some of this dust :3
2009-12-18T03:49:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 hmm... sounds like the sabayon livecd is to blame
2009-12-18T03:50:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 as for the pixie dust... you'll have to ask a programmer =)
2009-12-18T03:50:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	maybe.. I don't have other distros lying around right now, and right now I'm using my phone tethered via BT to connect, so not sure if I can download another
2009-12-18T03:51:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	I guess I could use acronis disk director inside XP when I fix grub2 again, but would prefer to try and create two partitions inside my extended one if I can within ubunt
2009-12-18T03:51:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 use gparted
2009-12-18T03:51:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	that though says my whole drive is unallocated, lol
2009-12-18T03:53:00.000Z	cr0bar	bllz	cheers anyhoo, too busy in here really, will check some on forums =)
2009-12-18T03:53:00.000Z	bllz	cr0bar	 good luck!
