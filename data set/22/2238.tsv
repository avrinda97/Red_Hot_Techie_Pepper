2009-08-15T23:07:00.000Z	SmithX		does anyone know the easiest way to customize a liveusb install?
2009-08-15T23:07:00.000Z	SmithX		every time I google, the instructions always look really lengthy
2009-08-15T23:08:00.000Z	SmithX		all I want to do is modify some config files on my liveusb.
2009-08-15T23:08:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	Its very lengthy and complicated..   I just do a install of ubuntu onto a memory stick.. might be simpler.
2009-08-15T23:09:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	shouldn't there be some way to open up the live cd image, modify a file, and close it back up?
2009-08-15T23:10:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	there is.    But working with the ISO installer/live CD is a pain in the butt.
2009-08-15T23:11:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	the problem is that I don't have a reguler ubuntu installation. All I have it the liveusb, which I created from a livecd
2009-08-15T23:12:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	there is a file on the ISO called something like filesystem.squashfs  you need to loop mount that file, change it..  and re-build the ISO if you want a live cd bootable thing.
2009-08-15T23:12:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	what I think I'm going to biovore: is it possible to do that while using the liveusb at the same time?
2009-08-15T23:13:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	nope..   I think the fastest method ot have a USB bootable ubuntu system is to do an install to the USB flash drive.. Then most machine can just boot off the USB drive and the root drive.
2009-08-15T23:14:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	well, there is a tool called remastersys that I was looking at, but even that is more than I wanted since I just want to change one file
2009-08-15T23:15:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	what the 1 file you want to change?
2009-08-15T23:16:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	I want to add my vimrc
2009-08-15T23:16:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	the root filesystem for the live image is a disk image call filesystem.squashfs under the casper-folder on the liveCD.
2009-08-15T23:17:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	you will need to have a running linux box, and loop mount the filesystem image to a directory.
2009-08-15T23:17:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	I can do that
2009-08-15T23:18:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	yeah.. so all you should have to do is modify the filesystem.squashfs image.  and it should stick..
2009-08-15T23:19:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	so anything I change while loop mounted is permanent after unmounting?
2009-08-15T23:19:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	should be.. assuming the filesystem image, A has free space and B, is read-writable.
2009-08-15T23:24:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	np
2009-08-15T23:25:00.000Z	SmithX	biovore	that's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks! I don't know why all the guides online are so complicated
2009-08-15T23:25:00.000Z	biovore	SmithX	I only know because I been messing with it my self..
