2007-05-09T12:26:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	I can see how filesharing experts would really jump at a problem description like this ;)
2007-05-09T12:28:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	have you tried setting up the connection through Places-Connect to server ?
2007-05-09T12:29:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	go on, try it.
2007-05-09T12:29:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	no
2007-05-09T12:33:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	the way I understood your problem was that you could see the host, but not the remote shares.
2007-05-09T12:34:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	does it ask you for credentials when you doubleclick it?
2007-05-09T12:35:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	is hers Ubuntu or Windows?
2007-05-09T12:39:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	does it ask you for credentials when you doubleclick it?
2007-05-09T12:43:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	first of all, while you are connecting from ubuntu, you have to enter the credentials that were setup on the windows machine for accessing that share, ie. not yours.
2007-05-09T12:44:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	to setup the ubuntu share for her to access, you have to use smbpasswd. There is a factoid...
2007-05-09T12:46:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	yeah, you've been betrayed
2007-05-09T12:48:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	samba is the server part. To access her windows share, you don't need samba
2007-05-09T12:52:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	so, use System-Administration-Users and Groups to give her an account and smbpasswd to set up sharing with those credentials.
2007-05-09T12:54:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	setup a group with her username as the group name. Use the User Privileges tab in the Properties dialog to set up other group memberships.
2007-05-09T13:08:00.000Z	CCmonster	soundray	so i set up group and user and all that, however, it still wont let me access from her comp
2007-05-09T13:08:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	smbpasswd

2007-05-09T13:27:00.000Z	CCmonster	soundray	I am reading about smbpasswd, however, did i not just enter all this info in the Sys>Admin>User Groups screens?
2007-05-09T13:28:00.000Z	soundray	CCmonster	samba is highly flexible, but that comes at the cost of needing some setup.
