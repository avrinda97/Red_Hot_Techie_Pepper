2008-07-15T11:16:00.000Z	Xavura		There was absolutely no need to.
2008-07-15T11:17:00.000Z	Xavura		I will if I stop getting grief. [/end]
2008-07-15T11:17:00.000Z	Xavura		I'm going to put ubottu on ignore.
2008-07-15T11:17:00.000Z	Xavura		Leave me alone with your off-topic/enter thing, I'll shut up now.
2008-07-15T11:18:00.000Z	Xavura		!off-topic | seraph
2008-07-15T11:18:00.000Z	Xavura		Annyone isn't it?
2008-07-15T11:18:00.000Z	Xavura		That's why. As said before, I will shut up because now I really am off topic.
2008-07-15T11:18:00.000Z	Xavura		I don't care, my point is when people do their !blah | Xavura thing it annoys the crap out of me.
2008-07-15T11:20:00.000Z	Xavura		Applets?
2008-07-15T11:22:00.000Z	Xavura		I have been looking for hours on end for a program to stream and/or record from my usb device (that goes to my games console via component cable). I have tried MythTV (doesn't work) and Cheese (doesn't offer options to turn the format to Pal60, hence fails dramatically). Does anyone know what software I need?
2008-07-15T11:23:00.000Z	Slinky	Xavura	a compiler some video driver source code and a greasy unwashed beard
2008-07-15T11:23:00.000Z	Xavura	Slinky	I have the driver for my device installed, err now what
2008-07-15T11:24:00.000Z	Slinky		eh it was just a jab at the standard linux nerd who would start writing his own software
2008-07-15T11:24:00.000Z	Xavura		How often can I paste my question without me being considered as excessive?
2008-07-15T11:24:00.000Z	Xavura		Every 10-20 minutes?
2008-07-15T11:24:00.000Z	Xavura		Because it gets skipped all the time.
2008-07-15T11:24:00.000Z	Xavura		Sorry about the enter thing, it's a HABIT, I can't help it.

2008-07-15T11:24:00.000Z	Xavura		Habits are hard to break, just don't **** at me, I try not to use enter when I'm here
2008-07-15T11:25:00.000Z	Xavura		Do I really need to paste this? Wow, ok, how often should I paste my question before I am regarded as excessive and/ or annoying?
2008-07-15T11:25:00.000Z	Slinky		eh i was just guessing at keywords
2008-07-15T11:25:00.000Z	Slinky	Xavura	thats so meta
