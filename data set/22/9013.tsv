2005-04-05T15:12:00.000Z	HappyPills		with the nautilus ftp client, how do I change between binary and ascii transfer mode?
2005-04-05T15:14:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	why would you want to use ASCII mode?
2005-04-05T15:16:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	oh, ouch
2005-04-11T15:08:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	right
2005-04-16T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	er, alsa is not a sound configuration tool
2005-04-16T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	it's a set of drivers and libraries
2005-04-16T12:41:00.000Z	HappyPills	bob2	thanks for the correction
2005-04-16T12:42:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	which ubuntu uses by default, so people have to go to effort to *not* use it
2005-04-16T12:42:00.000Z	HappyPills	bob2	really? didn't think I was using it... oh well =P
2005-11-06T07:26:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	8180 has an actual linux driver
2005-11-06T07:24:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	if you care about binary-only crud like windows drivers, I'd think just using i386 ubuntu would be simpler
2005-11-06T07:25:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	presumably amd64 ndiswrapper requires 64-bit amd64 windows NDIS drivers?
2005-11-06T07:25:00.000Z	HappyPills	bob2	I've got three 64bit drivers
2005-11-06T07:26:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	what card is it?
2005-11-06T07:27:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	are you on the amd64 machine now?
2005-11-06T07:27:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	nevermind then
2005-11-06T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	next time you reboot to ubuntu, run 'find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -name "*8080*"' and show us what it says
2005-11-06T07:31:00.000Z	HappyPills	bob2	the compiler didn't freeze so much as spit out incomprehensible messages telling me GCC-3.3 was not found, it refused to use gcc 3.4 and the Makefile didn't seem to define which version was being used. than the computer decided to stop responding, probably because of the other hacks I was attempting... sigh, i'll try finding 8080 and 8180 when I next boot into it though
2005-11-06T07:32:00.000Z	HappyPills	bob2	it doesn't seem to
2005-11-06T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	install gcc-3.3 then
2005-11-06T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	you are probably boned then
2005-11-06T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	HappyPills	I'd be very very surprised if you don't already have the 8180 driver
