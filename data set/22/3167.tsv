2009-01-27T01:36:00.000Z	beege		anyone have any clue as to how to edit windows registry on separate partition from ubuntu??
2009-01-27T01:37:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	not sure if there is a windows registry editor for linux.. seems kind of backwards
2009-01-27T01:37:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	wine does come with a registry editor.. perhaps you can use that in some way
2009-01-27T01:37:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	lol yeah. i changed my system drive letter for kicks and giggles, thinking it would be easy to change from linux X-D
2009-01-27T01:38:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	hehe.. guess you're lauging your way through a reinstall as we are speaking.. ;)
2009-01-27T01:38:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	haha probably
2009-01-27T01:39:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	there's nothing in the recovery thingy you can get if you boot from the install cd?
2009-01-27T01:39:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	i'm just really surprised linux can't edit the files
2009-01-27T01:39:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	i'm sure there is, i just wanted to do it the hard way
2009-01-27T01:41:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	have you checked if perl or python has a windows registry editing module? might be worth checking.. it might also be using some windows low level api for the actual editing
2009-01-27T01:41:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	ooo, that's a good idea. i'll poke around with it a bit
2009-01-27T01:44:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	any suggestions on editing windows registry from python...?
2009-01-27T01:44:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	search some python sites.. there are modules for just about anything. I would be surprised if there isn't one for dealing with the registry
2009-01-27T01:44:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	excellent. time to learn some nifty stuff. thanks!
2009-01-27T01:48:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	only python modules for editing windows registry are for windows platform...
2009-01-27T01:48:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	think wine could run such modules?
2009-01-27T01:48:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	mm.. it probable uses a windows api then..
2009-01-27T01:49:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	sure.. I guess that would work.. perhaps only for editing the wine registry though
2009-01-27T01:49:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	haha alrighty. i'll give it a shot. this is absurd and i love it
2009-01-27T01:54:00.000Z	beege	Slart_	well class is over and i must be off. hopefully this will work. thanks for the help
2009-01-27T01:54:00.000Z	Slart_	beege	you're welcome
