2008-03-29T19:57:00.000Z	danand	foo-nix	- have you tried rebooting or looking for processes that may be blocking the sound card with the 'ps -A' command?
2008-03-29T19:58:00.000Z	foo-nix	danand	No, thank youfor the hint
2008-03-29T20:00:00.000Z	danand	foo-nix	- you could try a script to check if any processes are using the sound card ... could pastebin one that i use if you like... Not sure it will work 100% but maybe worth a shot...
2008-03-29T20:02:00.000Z	foo-nix	danand	That would be awesome
2008-03-29T20:04:00.000Z	foo-nix		I have artsd running, but that is a kde sound demon right, could it 'interfere' with esd?

2008-03-29T20:05:00.000Z	foo-nix		no!
2008-03-29T20:06:00.000Z	foo-nix		that was not part of my password
2008-03-29T20:09:00.000Z	foo-nix		Which should I ue? artsd, esd or alsa?
2008-03-29T20:15:00.000Z	foo-nix		After a reboot, I still have the sound problem. Might it be that I am using amarok as a music player>
2008-03-29T20:15:00.000Z	foo-nix		which is kded, might bring kde deamons to live
2008-03-29T20:18:00.000Z	foo-nix	danand	Would you have that script for me?
2008-03-29T20:20:00.000Z	danand	foo-nix	- sorry, just been to get a cup of tea :) ... wait one...
2008-03-29T20:23:00.000Z	foo-nix		!kubuntu
2008-03-29T20:23:00.000Z	foo-nix		~!eskubuntu
2008-03-29T20:23:00.000Z	foo-nix		!es
2008-03-29T20:23:00.000Z	danand	foo-nix	- http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61482/ - hope that works for you :)
2008-03-29T20:24:00.000Z	foo-nix	danand	Thank you
2008-03-29T20:24:00.000Z	danand	foo-nix	- think you may need to run that as root... try as normal user first though
2008-03-29T20:26:00.000Z	foo-nix	danand	pfff, I got no output :)
2008-03-29T20:26:00.000Z	foo-nix		I will try installing kubuntu
2008-03-29T20:26:00.000Z	danand	foo-nix	- bah!! have you tried rebooting??
