2012-02-15T10:44:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	if youre trying to crack stuff you probably be better compiling your own tools
2012-02-15T10:47:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	find the paths... kernel stuff is in /usr/src/linux-header<blah>
2012-02-15T10:48:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	you cant expect someone in a channel to know exactly how to compile a specific driver from the net without reading the manual
2012-02-15T10:49:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	what is it asking?
2012-02-15T10:52:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	cat readme | pastebinit
2012-02-15T10:53:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	the answer lies in your readme file
2012-02-15T10:55:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	i told you if you want help pastebin the readme file
2012-02-15T10:56:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	or the install file
2012-02-15T10:57:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	pastebin the make file and the readme file then and i can have a look
2012-02-15T11:00:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	did you set the makefile : MODE=STA
2012-02-15T11:01:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	you have to edit 2 files, Makefile and os/linux/config.mk
2012-02-15T11:02:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	did you open them with an editor
2012-02-15T11:03:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	so in Makefile... set MODE=STA
2012-02-15T11:03:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	and TARGET=LINUX
2012-02-15T11:04:00.000Z	damo22	warhell	pm?
