2004-12-17T16:32:00.000Z	Rocha	AndyR	click with the middle mouse button
2004-12-17T16:32:00.000Z	Rocha		And change double to single click
2004-12-17T16:33:00.000Z	AndyR	Rocha	i only have 2 button laptop
2004-12-17T16:33:00.000Z	Rocha		Hmmm, you should switch to browser mode i my opinion
2004-12-17T16:33:00.000Z	Rocha		Or else, click with both buttons
2004-12-17T16:33:00.000Z	Rocha		both buttons equals middle button
2004-12-17T16:34:00.000Z	Rocha	AndyR	do you know how to change double to single click?
2004-12-17T16:34:00.000Z	Rocha		One click is much easier
2004-12-17T16:34:00.000Z	AndyR		thats in properties
2004-12-17T16:35:00.000Z	Rocha		Why should I want to open a folder with two click if just one can do the job? :)
2004-12-17T16:35:00.000Z	Rocha		So...change from double to single and use both buttons to open the folders...
2004-12-17T16:35:00.000Z	Rocha		...that way, it closes the previous window.
2004-12-17T16:35:00.000Z	Rocha	AndyR	if you don't like that, then switch to browser mode
2004-12-17T16:36:00.000Z	Rocha	AndyR	it's in the same place
2004-12-17T16:36:00.000Z	Rocha		Edit->Preferences->Behaviour->Always open in browser windows.
2004-12-17T16:37:00.000Z	AndyR	Rocha	done than now much better thank you
2004-12-17T16:37:00.000Z	Rocha	AndyR	np :)
2004-12-17T16:38:00.000Z	Rocha	AndyR	you may want to switch from "Information" to "Tree" in the browser mode
2004-12-17T16:38:00.000Z	Rocha		Browse a folder and on the left you have a combo box labeled "Information"
2004-12-17T16:38:00.000Z	Rocha		Click there and change to "Tree"
2004-12-17T16:39:00.000Z	Rocha	AndyR	I don't know if you prefer "Info" but I prefer "Tree"
