2006-09-13T10:55:00.000Z	rummik		help! i think i just screwed up a partition table...
2006-09-13T10:57:00.000Z	rummik		umm...what do i do when gparted breaks the partition table on the HDD?
2006-09-13T10:57:00.000Z	lupine_85	rummik	panic
2006-09-13T10:58:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	anything else?
2006-09-13T11:00:00.000Z	lupine_85	rummik	I would suggest that you first make a backup of the hard drive
2006-09-13T11:01:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	no drives that are 80GB around here...and yes, i'm sure the partition table is broken
2006-09-13T11:01:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	gparted just shows a black outline on the drive...
2006-09-13T11:02:00.000Z	lupine_85	rummik	hmm. Personally, in this sort of situation I'd write the drive off and go back to my pre-resize disc image, but you don't have one...
2006-09-13T11:02:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	how do i do that?
2006-09-13T11:02:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	and that's possible with NTFS?
2006-09-13T11:02:00.000Z	lupine_85	rummik	you "sudo fdisk <devicefile>"
2006-09-13T11:04:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	oh, fdisk, i thought you said fsck
2006-09-13T11:04:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	now what?
2006-09-13T11:04:00.000Z	lupine_85	rummik	the logic goes that the actual data on the drive hasn't been touched... just the partition table. So by recreating that partition table, you can hopefully get the data back into the partitions
2006-09-13T11:05:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	so...make a ntfs partition?
2006-09-13T11:05:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	yeah, two. one the size of the drive, and one 0+, both linux partitions
2006-09-13T11:06:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	i would imagine the original layout is the same as what XP would have put there when you install
2006-09-13T11:06:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	one big huge NTFS partition
2006-09-13T11:07:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	i dunno if i could make anything worse as this isn't my computer :(
2006-09-13T11:08:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	neither do i...i think i'll try some google
2006-09-13T11:13:00.000Z	rummik	lupine_85	i think i'm gonna be dead...
2006-09-13T11:13:00.000Z	lupine_85	rummik	probably
