2011-07-01T05:59:00.000Z	jes10000		I'm trying to create a live cd (well, usb) with Startup Disk Creator. It seems to work but I get Boot Error when I try to use it. Any help?
2011-07-01T06:01:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	when the process completed did you get a message indicating "installation successful"?
2011-07-01T06:02:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	yep
2011-07-01T06:03:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	when you boot, can you go to the bios boot selection and pick your usb?
2011-07-01T06:03:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	yes, then when it tries to boot I get Boot Error
2011-07-01T06:04:00.000Z	Jeruvy		jes10000; I would suggest repeating the startup disk creator and redoing it.
2011-07-01T06:05:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	I did. Is it possible that the iso I downloaded is corrupted? 11.04 from the official site
2011-07-01T06:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	make sure to md5 check this iso you download
2011-07-01T06:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy		!md5 | jes10000
2011-07-01T06:12:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	md5 checks out
2011-07-01T06:18:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	did you format your usb before installing?
2011-07-01T06:18:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	don't think so. how?
2011-07-01T06:19:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	from the startup disk creator
2011-07-01T06:19:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	I told sdc to erase the drive, that's the only option I saw
2011-07-01T06:20:00.000Z	jes10000		*disk not drive
2011-07-01T06:20:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	once you run the tool, and plugin the drive, you should see it detected.  Then select the filesystem and click on 'erase disk'.
2011-07-01T06:21:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	did that
2011-07-01T06:21:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	then during the install, you should get a message saying it needs authentication to install the bootloader
2011-07-01T06:21:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	I authenticated. a couple times
2011-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	then I'd try another usb
2011-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	jes10000	Jeruvy	I thought 4gb for $10 might be a little shady. Thanks for all your help!
2011-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jes10000	good luck.
