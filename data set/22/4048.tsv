2008-04-02T01:36:00.000Z	Nineaxis		Me too
2008-04-02T01:36:00.000Z	Nineaxis		Anyone know why a server might not be booting from the ubuntu server disk on startup?
2008-04-02T01:38:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 Is the BIOS configured to boot from CD automatically?
2008-04-02T01:38:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 Is the CD-ROM configured to boot before the hard drive?
2008-04-02T01:39:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 Also, is the system detecting the CD-ROM?
2008-04-02T01:39:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 Once it's booted to the hard disk, check within Fedora to see if the CD-ROM drive is detected.
2008-04-02T01:40:00.000Z	Nineaxis	JoeLinux117	Sorry for being a linux n00b, but how do I go about doing that?
2008-04-02T01:42:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 It's OK!  I forget the GUI method in Fedora (I believe there's a hardware manager, maybe someone using Fedora can confirm), but from the command-line you can type "sudo lshw | grep -A 15 cdrom", and look at the "logical name:" entries to see if your system has set the cdrom up.
2008-04-02T01:43:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 You should see something like, "logical name:  /dev/dvd"
2008-04-02T01:45:00.000Z	Nineaxis	JoeLinux117	I see it, logical name: /dev/cdrom /dev/scd0 and /devsr0
2008-04-02T01:46:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 Ok, this problem gets a little more complicated now.  Are you sure that the CD is bootable (has it worked before)?
2008-04-02T01:46:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 It could be that the CD isn't bootable... that would explain the boot process skipping it.
2008-04-02T01:47:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 Do you have K3b installed?
2008-04-02T01:47:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 It has a very easy "Burn CD Image..." option, where once you've downloaded the .iso file from www.ubuntu.com, you can simply burn it using K3b.
2008-04-02T01:48:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 I believe that should work ("sudo yum install k3b").
2008-04-02T01:49:00.000Z	Nineaxis	JoeLinux117	I don't have a cd burner on my server and my desktop is Windows.
2008-04-02T01:49:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 Ouch.  Do you have access to a CD burner?  Or anyone that can burn this for you?
2008-04-02T01:50:00.000Z	Nineaxis	JoeLinux117	I have a CD burner on my desktop, the one I just used to burn the ubuntu server cd
2008-04-02T01:50:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	 And that desktop is Windows?
2008-04-02T01:51:00.000Z	Nineaxis	JoeLinux117	Yes
2008-04-02T01:52:00.000Z	JoeLinux117	Nineaxis	Download a free CD burning program, cdburnerxp.se/download
2008-04-02T01:57:00.000Z	Nineaxis	JoeLinux117	I have the software and am in the screen to make the disk bootable but it won't accept .iso files
