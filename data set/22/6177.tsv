2006-12-07T09:50:00.000Z	citek		I am running ubuntu, I just installed "wine" i need to find the ~/.wine/drive_c/ folder,  where would this folder directory be located?
2006-12-07T09:51:00.000Z	DutchR_PW	citek	it's a hidden directory located in your home directory. but if you have never ran wine, you might need to start winecfg first to generate that directory
2006-12-07T09:51:00.000Z	citek		I have ran wine, Can you please tell me where that "hidden" directory would be?
2006-12-07T09:51:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		press ctrl+h in nautilus
2006-12-07T09:52:00.000Z	citek		Cratel2: No I didnt, Todays my first day on linux, Maybe I didn't run WINE than? But i have installed something with it and it supposedly made a Drive C:\, Any other idea's on where this could be located?
2006-12-07T09:54:00.000Z	DutchR_PW	citek	you should run winecfg first, which will create that directory (and open a config window, which you can close then)
2006-12-07T09:55:00.000Z	citek	DutchR_PW	Thank you, I Think im catching on now!
2006-12-07T09:55:00.000Z	DutchR_PW	citek	You're welcome
2006-12-07T09:57:00.000Z	citek	DutchR_PW	Even after that, Still no Wine folder in my Home Directory?
2006-12-07T09:57:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		have you enabled View hidden folders in your file manager?
2006-12-07T09:58:00.000Z	citek	DutchR_PW	Prob. Not, How Do I go about doing that?
2006-12-07T09:58:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		press Ctrl+H in the file manager, or go to view>show hidden files
2006-12-07T09:58:00.000Z	citek		Wow, I'm a moron. Thanks man!
2006-12-07T09:59:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		y/w
2006-12-07T10:03:00.000Z	citek	DutchR_PW	I'm trying to install Microsoft fonts, I installed them, but now I need to put them in my "C:\Windows\Fonts" from wine, Any idea on how I can recover where these files were installed?
2006-12-07T10:04:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		or go to fonts:/// in your file manager to view the installed fonts in linux, then you can copy them to .wine/drive_c/windows/fonts
2006-12-07T10:05:00.000Z	citek	DutchR_PW	Where is my File Manger, Im so new to this!
2006-12-07T10:06:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		where you found the .wine directory
2006-12-07T10:07:00.000Z	citek	DutchR_PW	There is no filemanager or fonts:/// in there.
2006-12-07T10:07:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		or you can press Alt+F2, type fonts:/// and press enter
2006-12-07T10:07:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		or press Ctrl+L in the file manager
2006-12-07T10:08:00.000Z	citek	DutchR_PW	You are the man!!!
