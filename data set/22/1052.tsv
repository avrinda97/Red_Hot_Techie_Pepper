2010-10-29T03:03:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad		Ubuntu 10.04: How can I tell if I have the 32 or 64 bit version installed?
2010-10-29T03:04:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad		I know it's stupid, but I forgot which I installed. :P
2010-10-29T03:04:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 =P
2010-10-29T03:05:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 run 'arch' command?
2010-10-29T03:06:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	ok thanks. :)
2010-10-29T03:08:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 mscotta++, you want the cpu arch or the OS?
2010-10-29T03:09:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 try 'uname -a'
2010-10-29T03:09:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	I wanted both, I got both. i686 on the OS is a 32-bit install right?
2010-10-29T03:09:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 or 'uname -mrsn
2010-10-29T03:10:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	right but an i686 software install is 32 bit.
2010-10-29T03:11:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	yeah. XD
2010-10-29T03:13:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 i'm betting you have 32bit ubuntu installed
2010-10-29T03:13:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	I do... I'm going to have to get 64-bit 10.04 or 10.10.
2010-10-29T03:14:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 what's the point?
2010-10-29T03:14:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	This is it. I want to install Ubuntu on this MacBook that I'm typing on right now, and I knew I had one Ubuntu 10.04 CD around but I didn't know if it was 32 or 64.
2010-10-29T03:15:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 i get that part, just wondering why you feel the need to change to 64bit
2010-10-29T03:15:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	I'm going to have to download a 64-bit version..
2010-10-29T03:15:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	oh because this MacBook Pro has 4GB RAM.
2010-10-29T03:23:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	LOL! What does that mean? :P
2010-10-29T03:23:00.000Z	Thmstcls	Sir_Konrad	 they don't spend the extra money for the Apple brand
2010-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	hehe... The Mactel Team does. :D
2010-10-29T03:25:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Thmstcls	yup. ;)
