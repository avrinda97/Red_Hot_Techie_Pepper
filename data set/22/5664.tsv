2007-03-26T16:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	you'll want to install openssh-server
2007-03-26T16:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	that'll allow them to login to your machine remotely
2007-03-26T16:40:00.000Z	Bright-Light	Flannel	I installed that. Now?
2007-03-26T16:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	now... nothing.  Any user on your machine can login remotely now.
2007-03-26T16:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	right, you're already doing that.  Assuming they have an account on your machine, they can connect.  You might need to port forward port 22 on your router.
2007-03-26T16:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	just like normal.  Do you have a GUI on this box?
2007-03-26T16:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	Are you running a nice pretty OS with a mouse and stuff? or just command line?

2007-03-26T16:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	alrigt, you've got a GUI then.  Go to.. uh, System > Administration > Users and Groups, or something like that.  to add new users
2007-03-26T16:48:00.000Z	Bright-Light	Flannel	how do I let them log in now?
2007-03-26T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	Do you have a router?
2007-03-26T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	you'll need to port forward port 22 on your router to your machine.
2007-03-26T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Bright-Light	then, they connect to your IP with a ssh client, and login.
2007-03-26T05:58:00.000Z	Bright-Light	Flannel	Are you her
