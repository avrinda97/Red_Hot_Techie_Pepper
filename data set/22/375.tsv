2012-09-09T12:15:00.000Z	mathi		it is written there
2012-09-09T12:15:00.000Z	mathi		but I'm afraid that it would install an old version, not sure if they update the docs for that
2012-09-09T12:16:00.000Z	mathi		ah oki
2012-09-09T12:16:00.000Z	mathi		i see on curl website it's like 7
2012-09-09T12:17:00.000Z	bekks	mathi	Then take a look at the version of that package: 7.22
2012-09-09T12:17:00.000Z	bekks		Pretty current I'd say. :)
2012-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	mathi		anyway when I try the comand from the docs: sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev, I get: "libcurl4-openssl-dev is already the newest version."
2012-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	mathi		and if I type curl in the command line, I get:
2012-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	bekks	mathi	Then the latest version from the repos is installed.
2012-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	mathi		The program 'curl' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2012-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	mathi		sudo apt-get install curl
2012-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	mathi		ah
2012-09-09T12:20:00.000Z	mathi	bekks	then why it says curl is not installed ?
2012-09-09T12:23:00.000Z	bekks		because "libcurl..." does not provide "curl".
2012-09-09T12:23:00.000Z	bekks		at least the -dev packages dont do.
2012-09-09T12:24:00.000Z	bekks	mathi	apt-get install curl
2012-09-09T12:25:00.000Z	mathi	bekks	ok I am installing, but I wonder why in asterisk docs only "sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev" is mentionned
2012-09-09T12:25:00.000Z	bekks	mathi	Because the need the -dev ackage contents maybe.
2012-09-09T12:27:00.000Z	mathi		thank you for helping:)
2012-09-09T12:40:00.000Z	bekks		apache2 -v
2012-09-09T12:41:00.000Z	mathi	bekks	it seems I need to recompile asterisk after instzlling curl module, I need to type make, then make install somewhere, but I have no idea where to execute these
2012-09-09T12:42:00.000Z	bekks	mathi	I never used asterisk, sorry.
