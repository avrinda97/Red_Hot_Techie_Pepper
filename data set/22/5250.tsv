2008-07-03T09:33:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	then, extract Watermark in ~/.screenlets/
2008-07-03T09:34:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	after, launch the screenlet manager in menu->preference. Launch several times Watermark to display several parameters (temperatures, cpu, fans, etc....)
2008-07-03T09:35:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	i installed screenlets;  but dont know what you mean: <WalloO> arooni, then, extract Watermark in ~/.screenlets/ .... also what do you mean screenlets manager in menu preferences
2008-07-03T09:35:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	download Watermark screenlet here: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=71960&forumpage=0 and install it in ~/.screenlets/ folder
2008-07-03T09:36:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	ok so dont use the package version (sudo apt-get install)?
2008-07-03T09:37:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	you need to install screenlets (sudo apt-get install screenlets ) to install the screenlets framwork. Watermark need screenlets to be installed
2008-07-03T09:38:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	do i extract the entire screenlets thing to the .screenlets directory?
2008-07-03T09:38:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	cuz i installed screenlets and i dont have a ~/.screenlets auto created; should id o that myself?
2008-07-03T09:39:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	the Watermark screenlet package must be extracted (completely) in ~/.screenlets
2008-07-03T09:39:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	create it
2008-07-03T09:40:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	ok;  so it should look like :  ~/.screenlets/Watermark  ?
2008-07-03T09:40:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	yes
2008-07-03T09:40:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	ok done;  whats next ?
2008-07-03T09:42:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	launch menu->preferences->Screenlets   to launch the screenlets manager. Then from there, launch watermark. Launch it several times to display several system parameters. As soon as you launch one, right click on it and go to properties to configure what you want it to display
2008-07-03T09:43:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	got it;  whenever i launch though i see only cpu load
2008-07-03T09:44:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	is there a way to quickly show/hide screenlets?
2008-07-03T09:44:00.000Z	arooni	WalloO	like a widget thing for osx
2008-07-03T09:46:00.000Z	WalloO	arooni	right click on the screenlet displayed on your desktop and chose "properties" Then you will be able to change what it displays. Install acpi, hddtemp, nvclock and lmsensors to have all system information available
