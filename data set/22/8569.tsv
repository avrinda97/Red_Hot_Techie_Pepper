2005-10-12T14:04:00.000Z	weiers		Hi, I'm sorry, I logged out and back in again, but it seems the fat32 partition is still only mounted for read-only. My fstab entry now reads: /dev/hda6 /wcwin  vfat user  0 0
2005-10-12T14:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	weiers	mount -a
2005-10-12T14:06:00.000Z	weiers	kbrooks	I typed mount -a, what do I do now?
2005-10-12T14:13:00.000Z	kbrooks	weiers	lsof /wcwin
2005-10-12T14:14:00.000Z	weiers	kbrooks	lsof /wcwin gives me six entries ... it lists a file that I opened a while ago in Open Office, but Open Office is closed
2005-10-12T14:15:00.000Z	kbrooks	weiers	Kill the oo pid
2005-10-12T14:17:00.000Z	weiers	kbrooks	where do I kill the oo pid? I am sorry, I find all of this stuff quite bewildering, yet interesting.

2005-10-12T14:25:00.000Z	weiers	kbrooks	the output is quite long and I don't think I should paste it all, but the last line says: gam_serve 6638 weiers  148r   DIR    3,6 8192 102940 /wcwin/Old Files/wc/Weiers/My Ministry/Adventist Professionals
