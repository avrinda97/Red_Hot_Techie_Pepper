2009-07-25T20:21:00.000Z	pagoda		i'm trying to compile ndiswrapper (even though i shouldn't need it) and i get this error: Makefile:35: *** Cannot find kernel version in /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/build, is it configured?. Stop.
2009-07-25T20:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	you need the kernel headers for your kernel (in other distro you would need the entire source tree)
2009-07-25T20:22:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	how do i get those?
2009-07-25T20:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	so, because you are not doing things the proper way, you could possible need the source tree
2009-07-25T20:23:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	what is the proper way?
2009-07-25T20:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	through the package manager, where you should get everything, including ndiswrapper
2009-07-25T20:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	aptitude search kernel headers
2009-07-25T20:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	aptitude install kernel-headers-`uname -r`
2009-07-25T20:23:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	will that work without an internet connection?
2009-07-25T20:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	no
2009-07-25T20:24:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	dammit. i'm trying to skip the steps that use apt-get because i don't want to dig out my ethernet cable
2009-07-25T20:24:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	thats terrible, download the all the .deb from the repos on a machine that does have internet and transfer it over
2009-07-25T20:24:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	do things the right way, period
2009-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	do you know how to get my wireless card working without ndiswrapper? i have a dell laptop with a broadcom card
2009-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	running jaunty
2009-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	no, i avoid broadcom at all times
2009-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	where do i get the .deb files?
2009-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	buy a better card such as an atheros
2009-07-25T20:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	there is an aptitude option to fetch only
2009-07-25T20:26:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	i only have one computer. i'm dual booting windows and linux. sounds like i need an ethernet cable...
2009-07-25T20:26:00.000Z	Titan8990	pagoda	yep
2009-07-25T20:26:00.000Z	pagoda	Titan8990	thanks
