2007-09-19T10:16:00.000Z	Gothfunc		hi.  is it much trouble to span the /home dir over two 200gb IDE drives, and would there be any performance concerns?
2007-09-19T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	 you are gong to have a single file that fills one drive? if not.  You could just link the 2nd hd to a users home directory/ExtraStorage dir. or similer.
2007-09-19T10:17:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	one user will take more than 200gb
2007-09-19T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	but not a SINGLE file.. you could just put his home dir on the 2nd hd.
2007-09-19T10:18:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	the 3nd hd is only 200gb...
2007-09-19T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	'only'  :)
2007-09-19T10:18:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	<Gothfunc> Dr_Willis: one user will take more than 200gb
2007-09-19T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	you can have home dirs on different partitiosn, just use  soft links to sort things out.
2007-09-19T10:19:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	that's the best way is it?
2007-09-19T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	depends on your needs.. make the users a directory on the 2nd hd. Link it to /home/thatusersname
2007-09-19T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	he then has the whole hd.
2007-09-19T10:20:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	plus the space he has on the 1st hd?
2007-09-19T10:20:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	or just the 2nd hd?
2007-09-19T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	Huh?  if you got the 2nd hd's home linked to /home/whatever all his stiff is on the 2nd hd.
2007-09-19T10:20:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	basically 1 user needs 300gb, and i have 2x200gb HDs for the home dir
2007-09-19T10:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	NOW you describe a different problem.
2007-09-19T10:21:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	i was describing that all along if you care to read up ;x
2007-09-19T10:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	either check out software raids/lvm, or get a biggger hd.
2007-09-19T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	 if theres not going to be a singel file. He could have a /home and a /home/storage on the 2nd hd  if you absoutely need 300GB in a single filesystem/directory - ya got to go anotehr route.
2007-09-19T10:23:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	i may do it like that... seems better to have a straightforward quota etc.  but if it's too much hassle i'll just have a subdir as you describe
2007-09-19T10:23:00.000Z	Gothfunc	Dr_Willis	thanks
2007-09-19T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gothfunc	my single user has his home dir across 5 drives. :)
