2010-02-19T07:19:00.000Z	Dill	DcMeese	ive heard that windows only likes to play in the first partition
2010-02-19T07:23:00.000Z	Dill	DcMeese	ubuntu won't sync with your iphone
2010-02-19T07:24:00.000Z	Dill	DcMeese	i'm told you can use and ssh, but i was never able to get it to work
2010-02-19T07:24:00.000Z	DcMeese	Dill	oh yeah lol. So I think I'll probly go with partitioning for Ubuntu and Win7 and VMing OSX.
2010-02-19T07:25:00.000Z	Dill	DcMeese	that's why i have win7 and ubuntu dual-booted.  that way i can sync my itouch and blackberry in windows and run everything else in ubuntu
2010-02-19T07:25:00.000Z	Dill	DcMeese	i can also wirelessly transfer files with my other windows pc's
2010-02-19T07:26:00.000Z	DcMeese	Dill	Yeah thats what ill probly do. Thanks. Better leave before Im banned for discussing VMing OSX lol
