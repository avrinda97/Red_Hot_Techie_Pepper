2007-08-09T11:12:00.000Z	shriphani		if feisty a wee bit too much for 256mb ram ?
2007-08-09T11:13:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	Not at all.
2007-08-09T11:13:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	What window manager are you using?
2007-08-09T11:14:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	metacity.
2007-08-09T11:14:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	Try xfce or IceWM
2007-08-09T11:15:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	is there a less intensive version of ubuntu ?
2007-08-09T11:15:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	Sure.  There's Xubuntu
2007-08-09T11:15:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	But beware that it isn't as actively supported in IRC/
2007-08-09T11:16:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	my problem exactly.
2007-08-09T11:16:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 I'd try out xfce first.
2007-08-09T11:16:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	i tried it. it shows 4 network-manager applet icons.
2007-08-09T11:17:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 Did you try IceWM ?
2007-08-09T11:17:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	no i didnt.
2007-08-09T11:17:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 IceWM is really, really basic... but low on resource consumption.
2007-08-09T11:18:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 sudo apt-get install icewm
2007-08-09T11:21:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	i like fluxbox a lot.
2007-08-09T11:22:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 So its the firefox skype combo that's causing issues, correct?
2007-08-09T11:24:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	right.
2007-08-09T11:24:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2007-08-09T11:25:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 Check that out.  Also, in my experience, Opera tends to use less RAM than firefox.
2007-08-09T11:25:00.000Z	shriphani	LiberCogito	umm so reinstallation is recommended ?
2007-08-09T11:27:00.000Z	LiberCogito	shriphani	 Well, there's this, too:  http://www.ubuntugeek.com/cleaning-up-all-unnecessary-junk-files-in-ubuntu.html
