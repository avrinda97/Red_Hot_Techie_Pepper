2011-05-20T15:01:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	To copy folders, use "cp -r source source source ... target"
2011-05-20T15:03:00.000Z	DevilSOlution	theadmin	ty, now its just flashing with a marker
2011-05-20T15:05:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Just wait till it gives you the prompt back
2011-05-20T15:06:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	That doesn't look right
2011-05-20T15:06:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Try like: cp -r /home/keg /media/that-huge-number-thingy
2011-05-20T15:06:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	To stop the execution, hit Ctrl+C
2011-05-20T15:08:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Looks right.
2011-05-20T15:08:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	To make sure it's doing stuff right: cp -rpv /home/keg  /media/9f8a98af-b52f-4cc2-89d7-f3f13d5cbeba
2011-05-20T15:11:00.000Z	DevilSOlution	theadmin	dcorking, okay the original command has worked but with the -p parameter it has flagged lots of permission issues
2011-05-20T15:12:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Try it with sudo.
2011-05-20T15:13:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Odd, I suppose so.
2011-05-20T15:18:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	You can't copy that, indeed
2011-05-20T15:23:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	ln -s TARGET LINKNAME
2011-05-20T15:24:00.000Z	DevilSOlution	theadmin	i want my $home on my new /media/longnumber device
2011-05-20T15:24:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Is that /media/longnumber a portable device?
2011-05-20T15:24:00.000Z	DevilSOlution	theadmin	ive run out of space on my main HD
2011-05-20T15:24:00.000Z	DevilSOlution	theadmin	no a slave HD
2011-05-20T15:24:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Oh... I see what you want then
2011-05-20T15:27:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	You can log in as root if you know the root's password
2011-05-20T15:32:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	An alternative is this: sudo touch /forcefsck ; sudo reboot
2011-05-20T15:33:00.000Z	DevilSOlution	theadmin	what will it do?
2011-05-20T15:33:00.000Z	theadmin	DevilSOlution	Perform a filesystem check on reboot, which is probably what you want
