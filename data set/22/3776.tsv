2009-06-19T17:11:00.000Z	scunizi		you can ls -la /usr/share/vuze to verify
2009-06-19T17:13:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	ok, but what about manually installing one from their website? (not that I can get it to even build)
2009-06-19T17:13:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	deactivate the nvidia driver that comes with ubuntu if you've activated it.. then open synaptic and uninstall the nvidia drivers listed there.
2009-06-19T17:14:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	then you have a couple of easy things to do but I'll write it up and pastebin it for you.

2009-06-19T17:20:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	keep in mind that with every kernel upgrade you'll have to reinstall.
2009-06-19T17:32:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	any idea why nothing is appearing in proprietary drivers?
2009-06-19T17:33:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	did you use envyng or install directly? or uninstall the drivers via synaptic?
2009-06-19T17:33:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	i've installed via synaptic (180)
2009-06-19T17:34:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	not sure.. you might try restarting
2009-06-19T17:35:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	k
2009-06-19T17:36:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	reboot didn't help
2009-06-19T17:36:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	does any other driver show?
2009-06-19T17:37:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	nope, nothing
2009-06-19T17:37:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	did they show prior to installing the 180 driver?
2009-06-19T17:42:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	you're not running ubuntu in a vm are you?
2009-06-19T17:43:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	i've got proprietry drivers to see "nvidia" (no version?) but can't use nvidia-settings
2009-06-19T17:43:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	no vm
2009-06-19T17:43:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	try nvidia-xconfig
2009-06-19T17:45:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	did you try to install the drivers direct from nvidia?
2009-06-19T17:52:00.000Z	zeroXten	scunizi	sort, cheers thanks
2009-06-19T17:52:00.000Z	scunizi	zeroXten	what happened?
