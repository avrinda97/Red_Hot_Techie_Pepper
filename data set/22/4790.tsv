2007-10-09T10:12:00.000Z	Jumbalia		Yay! it worked
2007-10-09T10:12:00.000Z	Jumbalia		I <3 you anto
2007-10-09T10:13:00.000Z	Jumbalia		Now, how do I find out why the nvidia drivers did not install properly>
2007-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	Jumbalia		I downloaded the drivers from nvidia for linux and ran the installer for it
2007-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	Jumbalia		it did everything itself
2007-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	Jumbalia		and after it was done, it restarted X and everything was working
2007-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	Jumbalia		then I restarted my comp and thats when it broke
2007-10-09T10:15:00.000Z	Jumbalia		Anto: I was told the restricted drivers were out of date
2007-10-09T10:16:00.000Z	Jumbalia		k
2007-10-09T10:18:00.000Z	Jumbalia		well I will worry more about my drivers later.  I have other things i gotta do now.  Anyone good at diagnosing why I only have a 60kb download speed in ubuntu w/ wine, but on windows i get 900k?
2007-10-09T10:18:00.000Z	eloquence	Jumbalia	what program? uTorrent?
2007-10-09T10:18:00.000Z	Jumbalia	eloquence	Steam
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	eloquence		oh
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	eloquence		dunno
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	Jumbalia		But in general, downloading anything on my linux machine is really slow
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	eloquence		what u playin?
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	eloquence		i've always found my linux to download faster
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	eloquence		but i dont use wine
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	eloquence		maybe its a wine problem
2007-10-09T10:19:00.000Z	Jumbalia		like just staright downloads off the internet or through synaptic.  I get less than 100k, where on windows with the same hardware i get between 800k-1mb
2007-10-09T10:20:00.000Z	eloquence	Jumbalia	are u sure its not just a kilobits and kilobytes issue?
2007-10-09T10:20:00.000Z	Jumbalia	eloquence	yeah
