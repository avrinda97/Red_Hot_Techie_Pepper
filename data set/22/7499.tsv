2006-03-20T11:16:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	server environment, where you don't need a gui, like a custom-built router box.
2006-03-20T11:17:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	it's still in development.  Right now it pretty much reflects what it's going to look like at release, without nearly as much polish/bugfixes.
2006-03-22T10:57:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	be careful with that...
2006-03-22T10:58:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	find <path_to_folder> -type d | xargs chmod 0755 (for dirs)
2006-03-22T10:58:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	find <path_to_folder> -type f | xargs chmod 0644 (for files)
2006-03-22T11:00:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	Depending on what the chmod does, you could wipe out the +x on dirs and not be able to access them anymore.
2006-03-22T11:01:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	chmod -R u+w <path_to_dir>
2006-03-22T11:28:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	not the chat window
2006-03-22T11:23:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	The first chmod makes your home directory 640, which is -rw-r----- ... your home directory HAS to be +x in order to read it.
2006-03-22T11:23:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	sudo chmod 0700 /home/michael
2006-03-22T11:25:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	Are you too good for your home?
2006-03-22T11:26:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	Did you do the sudo chmod 0700 /home/michael ?
2006-03-22T11:28:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	"whoami" from the prompt
2006-03-22T11:29:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	OK let's fix some perms... find /home/michael -type d -exec chmod 700 "{}" \;
2006-03-22T11:30:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	Yup ...
2006-03-22T11:30:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	Go for it...
2006-03-22T11:30:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	Since you're the only one who uses the computer... if it was multi-user, you'd then do a chmod 0700 /home/michael to prevent other people from accessing your home.
2006-03-22T11:31:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	It was going to be simple.  Too many people with too much knowledge.  We need some more newbies in here :)
2006-03-22T12:12:00.000Z	silvaran	michael	Windows won't be able to defrag your Linux discs... and from what I understand, Linux doesn't really need it except on really full drives.
