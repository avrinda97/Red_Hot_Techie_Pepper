2007-11-08T04:58:00.000Z	musashi		is there an ubuntu friendly channel for networking questions?
2007-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	I think he mean sto ask your networking question hre :)
2007-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	there's ##networking, if you don't mind a "generic" answer that will most likely get you punching in keys on a terminal
2007-11-08T05:00:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	that's why i was looking. that channel isn't overly active or helpful
2007-11-08T05:00:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	that is denyhosts.conf is for ftp progs?
2007-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	it's for ssh
2007-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	afaik opensshd doesn't listen to the old deny/allow hosts files... you can set it to not allow root logins in the sshd.conf or whatever file it is
2007-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	or do I misunderstand teh purpose of the directive you're trying to set?
2007-11-08T05:02:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	so denyhosts won't work with ssh? i that's that's what it's for
2007-11-08T05:03:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	oh, I was thinking of a different program, sorry
2007-11-08T05:04:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	well, denyhosts seems to do the job, it just doesn't ban at 1 for root like it's configured
2007-11-08T05:05:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	it bans properly for other violations though?
2007-11-08T05:05:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	seems to. most attempts are for root but for other non-existent accounts they get banned after 3 (i think)
2007-11-08T05:07:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	i can paste a log if that helps
2007-11-08T05:08:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	nah, I don't know anything about the program, was just wondering if maybe it was having trouble executing the "blocking" routine(iptables, route, whatever)
2007-11-08T05:09:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	i meant the auth.log but it does block IPs. they do get added after 10 attempts. i have it set to 1 though and not sure why it isn't working
2007-11-08T05:09:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	I'd scrap that all together, just change your port to a non-standard one, disable root login and password logins(key only), and use portsentry to ban any IP that hits the default ssh port
2007-11-08T05:11:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	i've been reluctant to use a non-standard port 'cause i'm afraid I might not be able to connect from work if the port i choose is blocked
2007-11-08T05:11:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	i don't have a root login enabled but just want to limit the attempts
2007-11-08T05:11:00.000Z	rxKaffee	musashi	ah, I see... corporate outgoing firewals suck :( put it on email port if you're not using email already ;)
2007-11-08T05:12:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	i tried 443 but it didn't work
2007-11-08T05:12:00.000Z	musashi	rxKaffee	i.e. failed to connect (timed out)
