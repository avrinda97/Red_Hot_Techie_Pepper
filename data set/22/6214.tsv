2006-12-27T10:58:00.000Z	Red_Death	blazemonger	why all these 'tards in #ubuntu?
2006-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	Red_Death	blazemonger	this isn't windows, reinstalling doesnt fix thigns
2006-12-27T11:02:00.000Z	blazemonger	Red_Death	would you reccomend making a new kernel?
2006-12-27T11:14:00.000Z	Red_Death	blazemonger	I have you on ignore because you're so ignorant, I suggest going back to windows if you're not willing to do what the smart people say
