2009-11-25T05:31:00.000Z	princezuda		Can someone help me out? I have a live cd of ubuntu 9.10 and want to recover my old ubuntu with it but I don't know how. I also don't know what mounting and unmounting is.
2009-11-25T05:31:00.000Z	princezuda		My old ubuntu can't find any kernels after those darn updates.
2009-11-25T05:31:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	what did happen to your old ubuntu?
2009-11-25T05:32:00.000Z	princezuda	knuthy	I did the update manager this morning, rebooted and bam I was in the grub line. I do not know much about linux. I know nothing about the grub line so I'm really lost.
2009-11-25T05:37:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	when you installed your first ubuntu, did you have a /home partition?
2009-11-25T05:50:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	did you install your ubuntu with a separate /home partition?
2009-11-25T05:52:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	not the hard drive, talking about partitions, did you install everything on a single partition?
2009-11-25T05:52:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	oh, you did a wubi install...
2009-11-25T05:53:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	you can't access that in a normal way from a live-cd :)
2009-11-25T05:53:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	where did you install the ubuntu files?
2009-11-25T05:53:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	there should be a big image file in the directory
2009-11-25T05:55:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	the biggest size file?
2009-11-25T05:55:00.000Z	princezuda	knuthy	you said to find an image right? like a gif?
2009-11-25T05:55:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	no.. nvm , what's the biggest file? :D
2009-11-25T05:56:00.000Z	princezuda	knuthy	root.disk
2009-11-25T05:56:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	ok, where did you mount the windows partition?
2009-11-25T05:58:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	can you pastbin the result of the command "mount" ?
2009-11-25T05:59:00.000Z	princezuda	knuthy	where should I type mount?
2009-11-25T05:59:00.000Z	knuthy	princezuda	in a terminal
