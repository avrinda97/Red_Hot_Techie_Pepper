2010-04-25T20:11:00.000Z	acicula		though if you have a 30" screen, a hd5870 you will have the matching set no doubt, so why'd youd want to bother with fluxbox ..
2010-04-25T20:12:00.000Z	maco	acicula	could be anything depending on driver quality... cpu might be waking up constantly for no good reason
2010-04-25T20:08:00.000Z	maco	acicula	right
2010-04-25T20:09:00.000Z	maco	acicula	some hardware will refuse to shut down properly or the kernel wont know how to do it properly, and then you get cases like mine where suspend only lasts 12h, and thats something to file a bug about
2010-04-25T20:10:00.000Z	acicula	maco	ah like so, but then we are talking periphials that keep spinning, ussually not the cpu/chipset/hdd i'd assume?
2010-04-25T20:14:00.000Z	acicula	maco	ah i always assumed the suspend state effectively would cut power until poweron by the mobo based on some event, which admittedly requires something doing some processing somewhere i suppose
2010-05-01T13:49:00.000Z	maco	acicula	it doesnt matter. xrandr doesnt care
2010-05-01T13:49:00.000Z	acicula	maco	it will if he just has a vesa driver loaded?
2010-05-01T13:50:00.000Z	maco	acicula	vesa can do 1024x768 cant it?
2010-05-01T13:50:00.000Z	acicula	maco	thought it was just 800x600 but not to sure on that
2010-05-01T13:50:00.000Z	maco	acicula	oh blah :(
2010-05-01T13:56:00.000Z	maco	acicula	apparently there's no max. it depends on what the hardware has hardcoded in
2010-05-01T13:56:00.000Z	acicula	maco	ok :) good to know
2010-05-01T13:58:00.000Z	acicula	maco	based on the hw list he linked to hes running in virtualbox, so maybe there are some drivers for that?
2010-05-01T13:58:00.000Z	maco	acicula	oh!
2010-05-16T08:34:00.000Z	acicula	maco	well apple is one of the few using it on pcs
2010-05-17T20:29:00.000Z	acicula	maco	there is little need, youd have to do weird things to connect as root, unlike with backtrack where being root was (is?) the default
2010-05-23T01:28:00.000Z	acicula	maco	doesnt kubuntu use artsd on top of pulseaudio or just pulseaudio directly?
2010-05-24T02:35:00.000Z	maco	acicula	itanic ;-)
2010-05-24T02:39:00.000Z	maco	acicula	yes, some newer atoms are 64bit, but the originals were 32bit-only
2010-05-24T02:45:00.000Z	maco	acicula	im not sure exactly how long as i only use intel graphics, but i have seen rants about how this hardware's not that old and how dare they
2010-05-24T02:46:00.000Z	acicula	maco	thats more likely related to people ranting about why the latest revision does not include their gfx anymore and they have to install the legacy version instead
