2009-05-15T02:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp		this is exactly why you shouldn't use ATI
2009-05-15T02:06:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	cant complain most laptops use Inbuilt cards
2009-05-15T02:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	that's why I only use hardware with built-in NVidia or Intel
2009-05-15T02:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	ATI cards are not supported under Linux in any meaningful way
2009-05-15T02:09:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	yes but there are some openSource drivers
2009-05-15T02:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	... that don't work
2009-05-15T02:10:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	i have seen it work
2009-05-15T02:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	all resolutions, and 3d acceleration?
2009-05-15T02:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	so, they don't work
2009-05-15T02:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	no acceleration == not working
2009-05-15T02:11:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	for me better than vesa == working :)
2009-05-15T02:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	well there is that
2009-05-26T01:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	I just use gedit for all my programming work
2009-05-26T01:15:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	but an IDE is autocomplete ;)'
2009-05-26T01:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	I hate autocomplete
2009-05-26T01:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	I'm sure you can get a plugin to do it
2009-05-26T01:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	native IDEs are kdevelop and anjuta, which both have autocomplete
2009-05-26T01:16:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	thanks i ll try it out
2009-05-26T01:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	vim is useful to know
2009-05-26T01:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Hiemanshu	no matter what happens you've always got vim, or at least vi
2009-05-26T01:17:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	i know them all :) i just need a good IDE
2009-05-26T01:17:00.000Z	Hiemanshu	gordonjcp	i am just learning so i would love an IDE
