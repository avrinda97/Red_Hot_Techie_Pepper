2010-03-03T17:02:00.000Z	arunbabu		i can't access the gui of my linux desktop at my college as it's banned by the admin. How are they doing it?
2010-03-03T17:03:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	Port blocked in firewall maybe? Care to tell us how you access the desktop normally?
2010-03-03T17:06:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	you are not trying to access it remotely? you are physically sitting by your own desktop computer, and you cannot get a GUI up?
2010-03-03T17:10:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	yeah we access it remotely from the server computer
2010-03-03T17:12:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	we just login with our userid and passwd and it logins remotely from the server.
2010-03-03T17:17:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	you there?
2010-03-03T17:18:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	yes
2010-03-03T17:19:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	any idea about solving my problem?
2010-03-03T17:21:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	You should take this up with your admin if he has blocked access to your desktop
2010-03-03T17:23:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	ok.. one more thing is that many commands like cp are unable to be used. It seems the admin has blocked it. How can are they able to block a particular commands?
2010-03-03T17:26:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	they can set privileges on executable files to disallow execution. This has little to do with ubuntu really
2010-03-03T17:27:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	Do a "ls -al /bin/cp" and give us output
2010-03-03T17:27:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	i haven tried. Now I'm at not at colge.
2010-03-03T17:28:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	It sounds like you tried to copy a file which you do not have permission to read... not that the actual cp command is not executable for you
2010-03-03T17:29:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	okay.. i think they have removed the permissin for me to run the exectuable of cp as it's not even workin on the files I creatted
2010-03-03T17:30:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	okay, reset the permissions and you should be fine
2010-03-03T17:31:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	i am not the admin. I can't do it :(
2010-03-03T17:31:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	if you are not the admin, then you could not possibly have messed up the permissions in the first place
2010-03-03T17:32:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	i am not the one who messed up the permissions. admin intentionally did it for avoid using the cp command :)
2010-03-03T17:34:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	no way to bypass it ?? :)
2010-03-03T17:36:00.000Z	vegarn	arunbabu	No, consult your admin
2010-03-03T17:37:00.000Z	arunbabu	vegarn	okay.. thanks
