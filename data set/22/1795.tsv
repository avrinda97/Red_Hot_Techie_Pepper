2011-05-03T22:44:00.000Z	ghostnik11		hi wanted to know what peoples thoughts on ubuntu 11.04 and how they would rate it compared to 10.10 which i am currently on, don't know if i should update yet?
2011-05-03T22:44:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	never touch a running system
2011-05-03T22:45:00.000Z	ghostnik11	iceroot	yeah but i updated from 9.1 to 10.04 to 10.10 using the upgrade manager
2011-05-03T22:45:00.000Z	ghostnik11	iceroot	worked well with no problems
2011-05-03T22:46:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	and why you need an upgrade?
2011-05-03T22:47:00.000Z	ghostnik11	iceroot	no i wanted to find out if 11.04 was better than 10.10, i mean i thought the new version of ubuntu the better it is
2011-05-03T22:48:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	"better" is always a personal opinion
2011-05-03T22:48:00.000Z	ghostnik11	iceroot	okay you got me thinking i should just stay with 10.10 which runs fantastic on my ibm thinkpad t60
2011-05-03T22:49:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	as i said, never touch a running system :) the most important sentence out there
2011-05-03T22:50:00.000Z	ghostnik11	iceroot	i know i will just test 11.04 through virtualbox and see if its really as good, then will do back up and then do install
2011-10-09T18:57:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	no
2011-10-09T18:57:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	not when deleted from the shell by "rm"
2011-10-09T18:58:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	as i said, delete data cant be restored
2011-10-09T19:01:00.000Z	ghostnik11	iceroot	its an external hard drive so that is a mechanical hard drive, but the problem is that it had the files on the hard drive and one day when hard drive was plugged in, the files weren't there, actually empty
2011-10-09T19:01:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	the best way to recover your data is your backup
2011-10-09T19:02:00.000Z	ghostnik11	iceroot	backup, can u back up a external hard drive? b/c I would do that in the future to save my data
2011-10-09T19:03:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	of course you can backup it
2011-10-09T19:03:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	there is no differene of internal drive, external drive, flash drive, streamer, floppy and so when doing a backup from it
2011-10-09T19:04:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	correct
2011-10-13T12:24:00.000Z	iceroot	ghostnik11	#ubuntu+1
