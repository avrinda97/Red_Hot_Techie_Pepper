2006-05-03T13:49:00.000Z	doctormo		hello all
2006-05-03T13:49:00.000Z	doctormo		I try and use the nvidia module in my xorg config, and I get 'module not found 'nvidia''
2006-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	doctormo		interestingly, I have all the nvidia items in apt installed
2006-05-03T13:53:00.000Z	doctormo		I've seen others on the forums be told o remove drivrs they got from nvidia and install the ones from apt-get hmmm
2006-05-03T13:54:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	doctormo	Yeah, that's usually the 'safest' way of installing them.
2006-05-03T13:55:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	Yes then they are installed, as I have installed every nvidia package related to the driver in my repository
2006-05-03T13:55:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	doctormo	So long as you have 'nvidia-glx', you should be good, then.
2006-05-03T13:55:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	nvidia-glx is installed
2006-05-03T13:56:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	xorg is still saying nvidia module will not load
2006-05-03T13:56:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe		the others should be dependencies of nvidia-glx
2006-05-03T13:56:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	I don't understand it, on my other machine it works fine
2006-05-03T13:58:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	the only thing you need to change is Driver "vesa" to Driver "nvidia" right?
2006-05-03T13:58:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	doctormo	And comment out dri and GLcore in the modules section.
2006-05-03T13:59:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	I have glx, dri, ddc and GLcore disabled because I _have_ to use the vesa driver
2006-05-03T14:00:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	looking at my other machine it has a nvidia.ko, this machine does not
2006-05-03T14:00:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	doctormo	glx an ddc should be fine with 'nvidia'
2006-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	doctormo	That could be an issue, yes. :)
2006-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	yes so apt is lieing to me?
2006-05-03T14:03:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	Ah, multiverse might be an interesting option
2006-05-03T14:03:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	doctormo	Hard to say.  Your situation sounds more complicated than it should be. o_O
2006-05-03T14:03:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	doctormo	multiverse?
2006-05-03T14:04:00.000Z	doctormo	PuMpErNiCkLe	apts sources are restricted
