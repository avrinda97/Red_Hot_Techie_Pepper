2012-08-04T20:15:00.000Z	JavaKid		it's minecraft (minecraft.jar) downloaded from minecraft.net
2012-08-04T20:18:00.000Z	JavaKid		okay djones i guess i can do that for now
2012-08-04T20:19:00.000Z	JavaKid		djones do you know where all the hidden minecraft files go? such as level saves and stuff

2012-08-04T20:23:00.000Z	JavaKid		okay i have amd 64 bit processors with the hd radeon integrated graphics. do you know how i get the drivers so i can play games? i got java and minecraft, but the game screen is all black (i'm assuming because no graphics drivers)

2012-08-04T20:27:00.000Z	JavaKid		now should i install normal or (post-release updates) graphics drivers?
2012-08-04T20:28:00.000Z	JavaKid		what does (post-release updates) mean?
2012-08-04T20:28:00.000Z	JavaKid		here's the list:
