2011-09-01T02:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	are you sure y=using a live thumb is what you need?
2011-09-01T02:43:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	I want a way to swap hardware in a system without confusing the installed OS (usually Windows). Bypassing the installed OS entirely seems like the best approach.
2011-09-01T02:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	to vague a explanation to be honest.
2011-09-01T02:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	in other word to many varibles to work I think.
2011-09-01T02:45:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	I've actually got a computer sitting next to me that spontaneously resets under certain loads. It could be the videocard, the motherboard, or the power supply. See the problem yet?
2011-09-01T02:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	no your there I'm not.
2011-09-01T02:47:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	basically, I want a way to test motherboards (and to a lesser extent, videocards) for latent instabilities without having to manually juggle drivers or continually reinstalling the OS
2011-09-01T02:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	what I think hyour saying is you want to try different distros to look for specific failure, is this correct.
2011-09-01T02:47:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	most of the systems brought to me are running Win7, which has a habit of EXPLODING if you change the motherboard on it
2011-09-01T02:47:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	I want to bypass the OS entirely to test for intermittent hardware failures
2011-09-01T02:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	using more then one distro, or OS?
2011-09-01T02:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	how about a multload thumb?
2011-09-01T02:49:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	my idea is to have an Ubuntu LiveUSB with all the drivers I need. Thus adding fglrx.
2011-09-01T02:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	why not do a full install, on the thumb?
2011-09-01T02:50:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	is that going to behave if I plug it into a different machine?
2011-09-01T02:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	as well as a live
2011-09-01T02:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	the grub boot is on the thumb
2011-09-01T02:51:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	it's not a priority, but could I still use that to install Ubuntu?
2011-09-01T02:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	no.
2011-09-01T02:52:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	this looks like it'll work, thanks
2011-10-16T20:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	roothorick	seems rather self explanatory, english not your native language. :D
2011-10-16T20:46:00.000Z	roothorick	urlin2u	English is my first language, and I perfectly understand the literal meaning of the words, but it doesn't make sense in the context. Does that mean it's not in the repository anymore? It won't get updated? Or is this some kind of support contract thing?
