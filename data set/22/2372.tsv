2009-07-03T06:17:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: not quite.  you need to install xserver-xorg-video-radeonhd
2009-07-03T06:18:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: then you need to read up docs for changing your xorg.conf ... 'cause it may not work.  this is a new driver
2009-07-03T06:18:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: also, run glxgear and see what your rate is.  this a standard benchmark for speed
2009-07-03T06:19:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: glxgears.  it's a command in linux.  you probably have it already
2009-07-03T06:20:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: sorry, typo.  what kind of rate are you getting?
2009-07-03T06:21:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: scratch WHATEVER we told you previously :) your problem isn't driver
2009-07-03T06:21:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: are you running compiz?
2009-07-03T06:22:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: if you kill it, are you sure it dies?  gnome might just restart it
2009-07-03T06:22:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: what kind of game? can you be specific?
2009-07-03T06:23:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: would be nice to check if metacity is actually running then
2009-07-03T06:24:00.000Z	cabrey	rch2	if compiz is running, metacity isn't
2009-07-03T06:24:00.000Z	rch2	cabrey	he says he kills compiz
2009-07-03T06:24:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: UXA is for 2D graphics. your game is 3D using opengl.
2009-07-03T06:24:00.000Z	cabrey	rch2	well UXA fixes the compiz/opengl issue
2009-07-03T06:25:00.000Z	rch2	cabrey	never heard of that, then perhaps worth trying
2009-07-03T06:26:00.000Z	cabrey	rch2	before if you had compiz enabled and ran glxgears, then tried to move the glxgears windows, bad things would happen.
2009-07-03T06:26:00.000Z	cabrey	rch2	UXA fixes that opengl / compiz issue so that you dont have to kill compiz before using opengl apps
2009-07-03T06:27:00.000Z	rch2	cabrey	sounds like a good suggestion, I don't have any others
2009-07-03T06:27:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: I just checked, your  card is too old to run radeonhd driver.  you are stuck with radeon driver (the only one for your R420 hardware)
2009-07-03T06:27:00.000Z	cabrey	rch2	the ubuntu wiki says it is unstable for intel chips, not sure about other hardware tho =V
2009-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	rch2		armenian: try to follow cabrey advice,I haven't used it myself so I can't tell
2009-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	rch2	cabrey	armenian: google found a good bug report on this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/96991
