2007-07-11T12:48:00.000Z	josh_marshall		Hey guys... anyone experiencing almost periodic gnome lags in the new feisty release?
2007-07-11T12:48:00.000Z	josh_marshall		*newer*
2007-07-11T12:49:00.000Z	josh_marshall		Eh, I use xfce for certain things, but I'm a big fan of Gnome... plus, I'm not totally sure it is Gnome.
2007-07-11T12:50:00.000Z	josh_marshall		I'm a huge fan of XFCE on resource challenged systems...
2007-07-11T12:50:00.000Z	josh_marshall		You played with Compiz Fusion much?
2007-07-11T12:51:00.000Z	josh_marshall		I understand.
2007-07-11T12:51:00.000Z	josh_marshall		I always say that... then I go off and screw it up anyway. I'm an obsessive re-installer... :)
2007-07-11T12:52:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	I'm a huge fan of xfce on NON resource-challenged machines
2007-07-11T12:56:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	sadly.. i just use the adobe flash player.... and I hate it so... when firefox goes boom... its generally at fault
2007-07-11T12:57:00.000Z	josh_marshall	neozen	Yeah, I read that Gnash was going to be implemented (is that correct?) in Gutsy, but when I tried the package for Feisty, YouTube threw up all over Firefox.
2007-07-11T13:14:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	don't complicate things mon
2007-07-11T13:15:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	if he is an american... he's pissed like all the rest of us that he can't watch something he paid for on his computer
2007-07-11T13:17:00.000Z	josh_marshall	neozen	Seriously? I've been using Automatix for... like, forever. Never really had a problem with it.
2007-07-11T13:17:00.000Z	josh_marshall	neozen	Now I'm aware -- that's the official stance from Ubuntu?
2007-07-11T13:17:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	ever tried doing a distribution upgrade after installing things with automatix?
2007-07-11T13:18:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	yes... that's the official stance
2007-07-11T13:18:00.000Z	josh_marshall	neozen	I've never had a dist-upgrade work on Ubuntu, Automatix or not.
2007-07-11T13:19:00.000Z	josh_marshall	neozen	Well, now I know that is the official stance, I'll definitely keep it in mind.
2007-07-11T13:19:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	I've just backed up home, installed, and blown it out after install of the newest
2007-07-11T13:19:00.000Z	josh_marshall	neozen	I try to stay aware of the trends and recommendations.
2007-07-11T13:19:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	::nods::
2007-07-11T13:20:00.000Z	neozen	josh_marshall	well you are now aware
