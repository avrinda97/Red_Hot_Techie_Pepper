2009-12-28T23:48:00.000Z	teknozwizard		LF: Anyone who can walk me through changing my splash screen + login screen to the "login scan fusion" offered by gnome art under the "Get more themes online" option in the appearance menu.
2009-12-28T23:49:00.000Z	teknozwizard		LFcontinued: Have tried youtube and all other sites listed under google search "changing login and spalsh, ubuntu 9.10." running into problem as follows: (Can't seem to install the login scan fusion theme from gnome art as a proper theme.)
2009-12-28T23:49:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	try apt-get install startupmanager
2009-12-28T23:50:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	trying now, one moment please.
2009-12-28T23:51:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Permissions denied.
2009-12-28T23:51:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	startupmanager is a program that lets you change your boot splash
2009-12-28T23:52:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Opened under "sudo apt-get," installing now.
2009-12-28T23:53:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Installation complete, please proceed with advice.
2009-12-28T23:54:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	it should have installed a menu item somewhere, probably administration or preferences
2009-12-28T23:54:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	try just: sudo startupmanager
2009-12-28T23:55:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Operation complete. Accessed properly. Looking at Startup-Manager. On Appearances tab. Do I need to add all images from my login-scan-fusion folder?
2009-12-28T23:55:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	startupmanager only handles the boot splash, not the login screen
2009-12-28T23:56:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Alright, I'll load the Splash image I've got via the "Bootloader themes" option, correct?
2009-12-28T23:56:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	unfortunately, it seems they didn't add much customizability to the new login screen config
2009-12-28T23:56:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	no, not bootloader
2009-12-28T23:57:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Correction accepted. One moment please.
2009-12-29T00:00:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Operation cannot be completed. Splash-DeepBlue.png is not an acceptable format. When trying to open it, and "save as: Splash-DeepBlue.so," operation failed. *.so is not an acceptable format. Please advise.
2009-12-29T00:01:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	.png files are not a splash or login theme, they're just an image
2009-12-29T00:01:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	Is there a way to convert it to a splash format?
2009-12-29T00:01:00.000Z	mhall119|work	teknozwizard	I'm not sure
2009-12-29T00:10:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	When downloading splash screens from the gnome art website you get to via "Get more themes online" option under preferrences, you have to right click "save image as" <image name>.so and it will load properly in startupmanager.
2009-12-29T00:13:00.000Z	teknozwizard	mhall119|work	(Problem: Logging out to view the new splash screen does not show the splash screen change. Seeking alternate options at a later time. Thank you for your help.)
