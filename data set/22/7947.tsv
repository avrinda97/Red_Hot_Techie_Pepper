2006-06-15T07:32:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	err, those matrox boards aren't known for 3d performance
2006-06-15T07:32:00.000Z	Scognito	void^	i used this card on my old p3 and it worked so great
2006-06-15T07:33:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	i used to get decent performance in glTron on a celeron466 in 640x480 and 16bit, but it really can't handle more than that
2006-06-15T07:33:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	heh, well, try 16bit modes, makes a huge difference to 32/24 bit
2006-06-15T07:34:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	strange, try the matrox driver package
2006-06-15T07:35:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	doesn't matter, works anyway iirc
2006-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	Scognito	void^	i fogot to tell 1 thing
2006-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	well i have no experience with that, been using that g450 on gentoo and debian only
2006-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	.. what makes you think it's not accelerated?
2006-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	Scognito	void^	because i get 99% cpu usage
2006-07-07T06:29:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	this may come as a surprise, but applications like 3dmark on windows take 100% cpu time..
2006-07-07T06:30:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	i get 850. Xgl runs smoothly. nwn runs smoothly.
2006-07-07T06:30:00.000Z	Scognito	void^	all opengl apps runs slowly
2006-07-07T06:31:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	try removing the 2nd screen
2006-07-07T06:31:00.000Z	Scognito	void^	do you have a geforce so i can use maybe your?
2006-07-07T06:32:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	geforce fx 5200, no special settings in my xorg.conf
2006-07-07T06:32:00.000Z	Scognito	void^	just curious, can you send me the file=
2006-07-07T06:34:00.000Z	Scognito	void^	last thing
2006-07-07T06:34:00.000Z	void^	Scognito	using via_agp
