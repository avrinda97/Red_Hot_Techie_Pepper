2008-03-17T17:26:00.000Z	KenSentMe		I have a 2nd hd in my system and i want to have it mounted on startup and be accessible for all users. This is the current line in /etc/fstab: UUID=blabla /media/disk_a ext3 user,exec,auto,rw 0 1. Now the normal user cant mount the volume and also cant write to it. What am i doing wrong?
2008-03-17T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenSentMe	is it formatted ext3?
2008-03-17T17:27:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ActionParsnip	i think it is
2008-03-17T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenSentMe	I'd check with sudo fdisk -l
2008-03-17T17:28:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ActionParsnip	it is
2008-03-17T17:30:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ActionParsnip	it is ext3 and root can create folders etc
2008-03-17T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenSentMe	i'd google fstab to check you have the right stuff. Can you also give a pastebin of your /etc/fstab
2008-03-17T17:30:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ActionParsnip	i pasted the line in my question already
2008-03-17T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenSentMe	do the whole thing dude

2008-03-17T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenSentMe	got
2008-03-17T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenSentMe	why are you using UUIDs?
2008-03-17T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		use /dev/sdb1 or whatever it is. You could use some spacing in there
2008-03-17T17:37:00.000Z	KenSentMe	ActionParsnip	because it's a swappable bay, and i want to use a different mountpoint if there is another disk in the bay. And uuid are ubuntu default
2008-03-17T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenSentMe	back it up and give /dev/<whatever> a go
