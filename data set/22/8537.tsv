2005-07-14T10:22:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	i'm looking in to making it something different
2005-07-14T10:23:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	give me a sec :)
2005-07-14T10:28:00.000Z	monkeyy	jcoxon	i want to dual boot this with Tiger
2005-07-14T10:29:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	i found that after a while i just ignored dashboard
2005-07-14T10:29:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	though i loved the speed upgrade
2005-07-14T10:30:00.000Z	monkeyy	jcoxon	ubuntu is blazing here
2005-07-14T10:30:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	though in different ways - accelerated 3d graphics won't work
2005-07-14T10:31:00.000Z	monkeyy	jcoxon	i was not aware of that
2005-07-14T10:31:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	yeah basically its running on free drivers
2005-07-14T10:31:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	there aren't any accelerated binaries for ppc, on really for x86
2005-07-14T10:32:00.000Z	monkeyy	jcoxon	i wanna dual boot this with Tiger if i am right i will install Tiger first then install ubuntu and then make the necessary changes in the Yaboot conf file ?
2005-07-14T10:33:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	yeah ubuntu will automagically include it (well thats what i found)
2005-07-14T10:34:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	i just left free space
2005-07-14T10:37:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	i would leave it at the end
2005-07-14T10:38:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	not sure - best perhaps to be safe
2005-07-14T10:39:00.000Z	monkeyy	jcoxon	did u leave one or not ?
2005-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	can't remember i set the partions up a longtime ago
2005-07-14T10:41:00.000Z	jcoxon	monkeyy	from my fdisk i don't think you do
