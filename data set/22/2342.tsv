2010-02-03T11:58:00.000Z	Alexandra		Yep, I did that already, but nothing appears
2010-02-03T11:59:00.000Z	pwnedulongtime	Alexandra	what happens when you do sudo modprobe pwc ?
2010-02-03T11:59:00.000Z	Alexandra		FATAL: Module pwc not found.

2010-02-03T11:59:00.000Z	Alexandra		2.6.31-17-generic
2010-02-03T11:59:00.000Z	pwnedulongtime	Alexandra	you may need to install backport modules
2010-02-03T12:00:00.000Z	Alexandra		Ah, ok
2010-02-03T12:00:00.000Z	Alexandra	pwnedulongtime	thanks, I never did that. I'll give it a try. Thnaks!
2010-02-03T12:03:00.000Z	pwnedulongtime	Alexandra	actually, you probably just need to plug the camera in while booting
2010-02-03T12:04:00.000Z	Alexandra	pwnedulongtime	Did that already, no success
2010-02-03T12:04:00.000Z	pwnedulongtime	Alexandra	weird
2010-02-03T12:05:00.000Z	Alexandra	pwnedulongtime	Should I find the webcam on /dev/video0?
2010-02-03T12:06:00.000Z	pwnedulongtime	Alexandra	yeah...mine is
