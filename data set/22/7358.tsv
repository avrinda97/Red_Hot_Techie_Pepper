2006-04-26T12:02:00.000Z	rabe		gently, i'm gettting REALLY pissed off with breezy (hope dapper will be better for that): 1. ATI drivers NOT working, no matter what I do 2. 5.1 Surround not working ? Isn't that bad?
2006-04-26T12:03:00.000Z	rabe		for you maybe, lucky you
2006-04-26T12:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	which vid card?
2006-04-26T12:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	install fglrx ^^
2006-04-26T12:04:00.000Z	rabe	Frogzoo	i tried x ways of doing that, just EVERY possible way
2006-04-26T12:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	'sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx'
2006-04-26T12:06:00.000Z	rabe	Frogzoo	tried that at least 15 times, really
2006-04-26T12:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	ok, now 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2006-04-26T12:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	and what is the result? black screen?
2006-04-26T12:07:00.000Z	rabe	Frogzoo	fglrxinfo -> MESA project
2006-04-26T12:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	now 'sudo /etc/X11/xorg.conf'   & replace the line 'driver ati'  with 'driver fglrx'
2006-04-26T12:08:00.000Z	rabe	Frogzoo	i did that already, the problem is much more deep
2006-04-26T12:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	under 'Section Module", do you have 'Load  "dri"
2006-04-26T12:10:00.000Z	rabe	Frogzoo	yewp
2006-04-26T12:14:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	dpkg -l xorg-driver-fglrx
2006-04-26T13:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	I have a 9700 and it all works, cept 3D is pretty poor for the hardware
2006-04-27T08:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	open a ticket with ati & insist they bring their drivers up to standard
2006-04-27T08:42:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	if ATI get enough pressure from a wide base, they will reconsider their shoddy resourcing of linux drivers
2006-04-27T08:43:00.000Z	rabe	Frogzoo	is there any petition made to make drivers (decent) for linux?
2006-04-27T08:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	dunno, I just opened a ticket to let them know I take the problem seriously
2006-04-27T09:24:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	if you can get physical access, you can steal the HDs, so it's no biggie really
2006-04-27T09:24:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rabe	however, you can passwd protect the grub screen if you like
