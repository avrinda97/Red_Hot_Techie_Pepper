2009-02-10T08:08:00.000Z	dmphotography		@ md5, Have you used VMWare before?
2009-02-10T08:08:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	long time ago
2009-02-10T08:09:00.000Z	dmphotography		You shouldn't have any trouble.  Once you click inside the Linux OS, your keyboard should work fine.
2009-02-10T08:09:00.000Z	dmphotography		Did you install and leave everything default?
2009-02-10T08:09:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	but it doesn't. Mouse works fine, but keyboard doesn't work.
2009-02-10T08:10:00.000Z	dmphotography	md5	Hmm, if you installed it correctly and didn't change the default option for the keyboard, then it should work.
2009-02-10T08:10:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	Few little changes, but it doesn't have anything to do with keyboard
2009-02-10T08:10:00.000Z	dmphotography		That's strange.  I've never had an issue with it.
2009-02-10T08:11:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	maybe because you run ubuntu from iso and I run from my hard disk
2009-02-10T08:11:00.000Z	dmphotography		Nah, I run all my VM's from the hard disk.
2009-02-10T08:11:00.000Z	dmphotography		I use the ISO to install it and then I don't use it anymore.
2009-02-10T08:12:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	can't find an answer on the internet, last hope is here :)
2009-02-10T08:12:00.000Z	dmphotography		Have you tried just re-installing it?
2009-02-10T08:13:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	not the OS, but i tried to make new connection
2009-02-10T08:13:00.000Z	dmphotography	md5	Does it work on any other distros of Linux/any other installed VM OS's?
2009-02-10T08:13:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	yes
2009-02-10T08:13:00.000Z	dmphotography	md5	which?
2009-02-10T08:13:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	backtrack
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	dmphotography		Ahh.  Haha.
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	;]
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	dmphotography		I have a nice tutorial on how to install that to hard disk if you haven't already done so.
2009-02-10T08:15:00.000Z	md5	dmphotography	I have installed it with cd, now I am trying to connect from xp to ubuntu, everything is ok just keyboard doesnt work
