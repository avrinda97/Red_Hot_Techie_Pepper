2008-04-02T06:03:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		I'm having a problem with gdm
2008-04-02T06:03:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		it seems to hang when starting up
2008-04-02T06:05:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		anyone know what the problem could be?
2008-04-02T06:06:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	try killing compiz
2008-04-02T06:06:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	while its hanging, hit CTRL+ALT+F1 then log in and "sudo killall compiz.real"
2008-04-02T06:07:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	then hit CTRL+ALT+F7 and see if it's unhung, if so you need to disable compiz, if not, then compiz is not the problem
2008-04-02T06:07:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		compiz isn't running
2008-04-02T06:07:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	are you sure?
2008-04-02T06:08:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		top shows that gdmgreeter is taking 100% cpu
2008-04-02T06:09:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop	Nith	i did a ps -aux | grep compiz
2008-04-02T06:10:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	fair enough, does it freeze just after you log in?
2008-04-02T06:10:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	or just before?
2008-04-02T06:10:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		no before
2008-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	Nith		so you never see the login screen?
2008-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	Nith		hmm
2008-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		yes
2008-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	Nith		what happens if you try to start gdm from a tty?
2008-04-02T06:11:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop	Nith	same thing
2008-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	sorry, that one's beyond me
2008-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop	Nith	thanks anyway
2008-04-02T06:13:00.000Z	ZiggyFish_laptop		nith I am using the Hardy, could that be the problem
2008-04-02T06:14:00.000Z	Nith	ZiggyFish_laptop	it might, have you tried #ubuntu+1?
