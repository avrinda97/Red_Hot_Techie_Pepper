2009-05-19T23:17:00.000Z	helper		hello brothers , what does s mean here in : rwxr-sr-x ?
2009-05-19T23:19:00.000Z	helper		grackner thx
2009-05-19T23:21:00.000Z	mzz	helper	if other users should not be able to run it you should remove the "x" bit for "world" (and possibly "group")
2009-05-19T23:25:00.000Z	helper	mzz	the benieft of setuid so all users can see this file or folder right ?
2009-05-19T23:25:00.000Z	mzz	helper	are we talking about "s" on a directory or on a file?
2009-05-19T23:25:00.000Z	helper	mzz	folder !
2009-05-19T23:25:00.000Z	helper	mzz	and file
2009-05-19T23:29:00.000Z	helper	mzz	difference i know x is for execute, the s also can execute ?
2009-05-19T23:30:00.000Z	mzz	helper	you may want to read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Symbolic_notation and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit
2009-05-19T23:30:00.000Z	mzz	helper	it's a bit confusing because that third char (the -, x or s one) is actually showing the state of more than one bit
2009-05-19T23:31:00.000Z	helper	mzz	ok thx , i read sticky mode use for folders to prevent the non owner of folder not modify it right ?
2009-05-19T23:36:00.000Z	helper	mzz	now i make dir called moed and then put own and group to root and mode +rws and then using user test i try to read i can but modify like delete i can't permission denied this is ?
2009-05-19T23:37:00.000Z	mzz	helper	do you mean you can't delete files inside "moed" or can't delete "moed" itself?
2009-05-19T23:38:00.000Z	helper	mzz	i can't delete files inside moed
2009-05-19T23:38:00.000Z	mzz	helper	did those files correctly get the owner/group of the user who created them?
2009-05-19T23:38:00.000Z	mzz	helper	the idea is that only the owner can delete those files.
2009-05-19T23:38:00.000Z	helper	mzz	i did the owner and group root and i am in user test
2009-05-19T23:39:00.000Z	helper	mzz	ya that's what i meant :)
2009-05-19T23:40:00.000Z	mzz	helper	so what are the permissions and owner/group on the file it's not letting you delete?
2009-05-19T23:40:00.000Z	helper	mzz	 rwsrwsr-x
2009-05-19T23:40:00.000Z	helper	mzz	i am just testing it so to know that i am understanding it
2009-05-19T23:41:00.000Z	mzz	helper	can you pastebin the commands you're running? May be easier than having you list all interesting ls -l commands one by one
