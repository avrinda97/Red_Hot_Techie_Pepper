2009-08-03T03:55:00.000Z	raulh		hey guys im just wondering how do i install flash on firefox 3?
2009-08-03T03:56:00.000Z	raulh		no adobe doesn't support linux.
2009-08-03T03:56:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	What do you mean adobe doesnt support linux? For main apps you mean? You do know they have a linux flash plugin and adobe reader right?
2009-08-03T03:57:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	What do you need?
2009-08-03T03:58:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	adobe.com and go to flash and download the deb for flash. Its easy.
2009-08-03T03:59:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	double click it and install
2009-08-03T04:01:00.000Z	raulh	linuxguy2009	libnspr4-dev i get an error saying that is not a satisfiable dependancy
2009-08-03T04:04:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	Lets keep it respectful here please.
2009-08-04T05:44:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	Whats going on? errors with nvidia driver installation?
2009-08-04T05:45:00.000Z	raulh	linuxguy2009	it's the entire "hardware drivers" thing in system>administration
2009-08-04T05:46:00.000Z	raulh	linuxguy2009	any ideas??
2009-08-04T05:47:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	Ok so are you getting this error while downloading from nvidia.com or during the actual driver install?
2009-08-04T05:48:00.000Z	raulh	linuxguy2009	like i said it's the entire "hardware drivers" in system>administration>hardware drivers
2009-08-04T05:48:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	Oh well just go around it and go to nvidia.com they have much newer driver there anyhow.
2009-08-04T05:49:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	What do you mean it locks down your package archive folder?
2009-08-04T05:50:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	I think apt-get puts packages in /var/cache/apt/archives as well.
2009-08-04T05:55:00.000Z	raulh	linuxguy2009	hey man if you ever encounter people asking about ubuntu's backend problem let them know about sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-180 :)
2009-08-04T05:56:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	Yeah new poeple might not know it but experienced user know that apt-get is pretty handy.
2009-08-04T05:57:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	If you have a newer card the drivers from nvidia.com are much better BTW.
2009-08-04T06:09:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	Debian comes with gnome out of the box
2009-08-04T06:13:00.000Z	raulh	linuxguy2009	185 drivers much better then 180 or is there not much of a diffrence?
2009-08-04T06:14:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	raulh	 There newer. Better support for newer cards.
