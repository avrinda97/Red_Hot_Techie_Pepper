2012-11-28T02:13:00.000Z	invariant		What's the easiest way to get a working sendmail command?
2012-11-28T02:14:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	use postfix instead of sendmail
2012-11-28T02:14:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	is there any complete guide that you can recommend?
2012-11-28T02:15:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	there is a complete chapter on mail
2012-11-28T02:15:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	what do you think about dovecot?
2012-11-28T02:16:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	dovecot is no replacement for sendmail, it is a pop3/imap sevrer
2012-11-28T02:16:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	what's the difference?
2012-11-28T02:17:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	between what?
2012-11-28T02:17:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	between sendmail and an imap server for example?
2012-11-28T02:17:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	I thought sendmail just pointed at the real e-mail server and that dovecot would also be one.
2012-11-28T02:18:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	apparently it's a Mail Delivery Agent.
2012-11-28T02:18:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	not a Mail Transfer Agent.
2012-11-28T02:18:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	please read up on mail protocols - this channel is not the place for a mail tutorial - there is smtp on one hand and pop3/imap on the other hand
2012-11-28T02:19:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	ah, I didn't expect you to know those definitions :-)
2012-11-28T02:20:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	is Postfix a MTA and a MDA or do I need both Postfix and Dovecot for a complete e-mail solution?
2012-11-28T02:21:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	not counting the client here.
2012-11-28T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	postfix/sendmail are MTAs only, you always need a MDA too (thats where dovecot makes its appearance :-))
2012-11-28T02:22:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	and how do I connect a domainname to all of this?
2012-11-28T02:23:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	is that just a matter of telling my hoster to point some record MA-record (or something like that) to a properly setup dovecot server address?
2012-11-28T02:23:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	please start reading here: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/email-services.html
2012-11-28T02:24:00.000Z	guntbert	invariant	and talking about server configuration is a lot easier in #ubuntu-server
2012-11-28T02:26:00.000Z	invariant	guntbert	it was MX.
