2005-12-19T16:06:00.000Z	topyli		microsoft publishing? thank $DEITY, no
2005-12-19T16:07:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	it has it's place.
2005-12-19T16:07:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	i'm doing well with latex
2005-12-19T16:07:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	but if I'm making a flyer or sales promotion I'd rather do it in publisher than in latex
2005-12-19T16:08:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	do it with scribus
2005-12-19T16:08:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	I'd use inkscape or scribus or kword these days
2005-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	openoffice tries to suck as much as ms office does :(
2005-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	exactly
2005-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	that said.. excell is good... presenter is ok.. access has it's place but doesn't scale
2005-12-19T16:14:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	I'm going to I want stuff like todo's and contacts and stuff I can sync with my phone.
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	me too. but i have a nokia communicator which syncs with "supported PC's". their definition of a "supported PC" is quite narrow
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	I find it a sub-optimal solution maybe by the time I work out getting syncml from my phone to linux then kitchensync will be working
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	umm model no?
2005-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	9300
2005-12-19T16:16:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	usb?
2005-12-19T16:16:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	email me a lsusb -v with it pluged in.
2005-12-19T16:16:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	i used to have a 9210 and it was old enough to have been cracked by the p3nfs hackers. the new ones are still a mystery
2005-12-19T16:16:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	now i just transfer stuff with bluetooth. no sync
2005-12-19T16:17:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	if you're using bluetooth and OBEX it may support syncML
2005-12-19T16:17:00.000Z	nevyn	topyli	obex actually specifies a way to get a capabilities list from the phone which nokia seems to honor
2005-12-19T16:18:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	it does, i've seen pages describing syncing between the commie and evolution with syncml and multisync. just haven't had the time to hack on it
2005-12-19T16:19:00.000Z	topyli	nevyn	go to any linux/opensource fair and you'll see nokia people talking about how much they love free software. then they don't support it on their phones
