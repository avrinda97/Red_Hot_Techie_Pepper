2007-07-19T14:54:00.000Z	zenum		hey, does anyone here have an nvidia 8500 or 8600 graphics card? I am thinking of getting one and just want to know if I can expect to get full 3d support with it in ubuntu?
2007-07-19T14:54:00.000Z	zenum		Or is there somewhere on the net which has a list of currently supported graphic cards?
2007-07-19T14:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	Nvidia provides great drivers ( though intel's are better... )
2007-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	so pretty much any nvidia card should work fine with propriety drivers?
2007-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	AFIK yes
2007-11-03T05:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	What is the problem?
2007-11-03T05:52:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	The alternate cd won't install the base system as it complains about "chroot: cannot execute apt-get"
2007-11-03T05:52:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	I'm trying to install the root partition on a software RAID1
2007-11-03T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	Have you tried chrooting in yourself and seeing why apt-get won't run / if it is there?
2007-11-03T05:53:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	i've done a chroot /target and that seams to work... but there is no apt-get command available
2007-11-03T05:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	What about dpkg ?
2007-11-03T05:55:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	dpkg is there and it runs... that is it returns the help screen with no paramaters which is expected
2007-11-03T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	You could try installing apt with dpkg
2007-11-03T05:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	packages.ubuntu.com or on the alternate CD somewhere
2007-11-03T05:56:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	would i have to install it in the chroot'd environment?
2007-11-03T05:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	Yes
2007-11-03T05:56:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	doesn't that get cleaned out whenever i try and install the basesystem?
2007-11-03T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	Yes, I was assuming you would just 'apt-get install ubuntu-base' and possibly install GRUB
2007-11-03T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zenum	Not the most convenient solution but it should work
2007-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	well i can use dpkg to install apt... but it won't let me install because it says it doesn't have rm to clean up
2007-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	and it seems that indeed i don't have rm installed
2007-11-03T06:13:00.000Z	zenum	Jordan_U	do you know if it would be possible to install say dapper desktop onto an existing software raid partition... or can you only install on raid with an alternate cd?
