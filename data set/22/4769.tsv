2007-10-22T16:31:00.000Z	Col^		saying i have a linuxbox as a router on all of our homecomputers, and i want to anonymise (?), which programs can be used?
2007-10-22T16:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	sorry ...?
2007-10-22T16:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	 anonymize what?
2007-10-22T16:33:00.000Z	Col^	kbrooks	our data going out on the web
2007-10-22T16:33:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	ok. so you say you want to anonymise your data going out on the web. why?
2007-10-22T16:33:00.000Z	Col^	kbrooks	because the danish government does data surveillance on all citizens
2007-10-22T16:34:00.000Z	Col^		yep
2007-10-22T16:35:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	well, i can suggest tor
2007-10-22T16:35:00.000Z	Col^	kbrooks	ok, but can it be used on a router?
2007-10-22T16:35:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	but its not perfect. traffic analysis is possible, so just be careful.
2007-10-22T16:36:00.000Z	Col^	kbrooks	ok, i'll try fiddling a bit with it
2007-10-22T16:36:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	it's better to ask if it can be used on any linux distribution. a router is a computer that routes network data to its destination.
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	the answer is yes
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	Col^	kbrooks	i guess so, but i just thought it should be implemented in all programs on the machine
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	Col^		Maybe i just werent thourough in my investigation :)
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	that's certainly possible ... with some ceveats.
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	Col^		ok kbrooks, thanks for the help
2007-10-22T16:39:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	with tor, you want dns to be resolved in a secure way so that people don't know you're browsing a particular site.
2007-10-22T16:40:00.000Z	Col^	kbrooks	ok, i gotta get into this networking stuff more
2007-10-22T16:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	can i teach some ;-)
2007-10-22T16:40:00.000Z	Col^	kbrooks	sure you can, but i gotta get home from school first :)
2007-10-22T16:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	Col^	lol me too
