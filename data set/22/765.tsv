2011-03-26T06:43:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	that comes up as a Network controller not SATA
2011-03-26T06:44:00.000Z	Sw33NY_	spirals	when i start my computer i have errors : BAR 6 : Address space in collision on of device
2011-03-26T06:44:00.000Z	Sw33NY_	spirals	yeah sorry

2011-03-26T06:45:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	one minute
2011-03-26T06:45:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	what is your release of Ubuntu?
2011-03-26T06:46:00.000Z	Sw33NY_	spirals	Debian Squeeze : /
2011-03-26T06:46:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	you need to get support from #debian then. It's going to be different from Ubuntu.
2011-03-26T06:47:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	ok I'll check for 10.04
2011-03-26T06:50:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	I couldn't find any reports in Google of problems with the RT 8169 driver and that card in Ubuntu. Only hardware problems solved those threads (like "bad card" or "bad patch cable")
2011-03-26T06:50:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	can you pastebin that error again please
2011-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	please also pastebin "dmesg | grep unknown"
2011-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	Sw33NY_	spirals	i paste it
2011-03-26T06:57:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	is there an actual problem that you've noticed in usage (anything to solve immediately?) I found this bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/424142
2011-03-26T06:57:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	but I'm not getting any sense of how it affects the user
2011-03-26T06:59:00.000Z	spirals	Sw33NY_	not from anything I've read
2011-03-26T06:59:00.000Z	Sw33NY_	spirals	thanks you
