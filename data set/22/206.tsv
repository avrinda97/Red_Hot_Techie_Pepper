2012-06-23T15:36:00.000Z	Segnale007		hello folks
2012-06-23T15:37:00.000Z	Segnale007		I have realized Ubuntu 12.04 is a little bit too much slow on my vaio I3 2.4GHZ 4GB ram 1033mhz and 500GB hdd 5400rpm
2012-06-23T15:37:00.000Z	Segnale007		when I open like the browser or thunderbird, the nautilus
2012-06-23T15:37:00.000Z	Segnale007		or whatever
2012-06-23T15:37:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	use something like XFCE instead then, or maybe OpenBox/FluxBox
2012-06-23T15:38:00.000Z	Segnale007	eph3meral	I actually like Unity though
2012-06-23T15:39:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	well if it's slow, then it sounds like there's something you don't like about it
2012-06-23T15:39:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	you don't really have much of a choice, stick with unity because you "like it" and admit that you "like it" enough that the speed tradeoff doesn't matter
2012-06-23T15:39:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	or install XFCE, LXDE or Fluxbox
2012-06-23T15:45:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	do you have the ATI drivers installed?
2012-06-23T15:46:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	that could actually be your problem, the 5000s aren't great, but they're real, if you've got the driver installed you should be able to use compiz no problem
2012-06-23T15:46:00.000Z	Segnale007	eph3meral	yep I installed the latest ATI driver
2012-06-23T15:47:00.000Z	Segnale007	eph3meral	its actually unity the problem .. being slow ..
2012-06-23T15:48:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	yeah i can't stand unity, I didn't like many of the other options either, KDE sucks and GNOME 3 is only minorly worse than unity
2012-06-23T15:48:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	i use XFCE these days and I'm actually really liking it a lot - XFCE gets so many things right that gnome2 got wrong
2012-06-23T15:48:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	you might want to just try plain GNOME 3
2012-06-23T15:48:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	the two are in fact slightly different
2012-06-23T15:49:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	yeah XFCE is actually really nice these days, you might be surprised, it's pretty full featured
2012-06-23T15:49:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	honestly, one thing that really pissed me off about GNOME 3 and the latest OSX
2012-06-23T15:49:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	was the fact that they removed the ability to put your virtual desktops in a grid
2012-06-23T15:50:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	that single handedly made them unusable for me
2012-06-23T15:51:00.000Z	eph3meral	Segnale007	i don't remember exactly the command, I'm about to install it right now, myself
