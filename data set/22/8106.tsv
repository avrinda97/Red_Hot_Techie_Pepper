2006-12-24T10:01:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	argh!
2006-12-24T10:01:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	backup and do a clean install
2006-12-24T10:02:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	the problem is my CD drive isn't working, i'd have to install using netboot
2006-12-24T10:02:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	or get a new CD drive
2006-12-24T10:02:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	or mount the image on your hdd and boot from that
2006-12-24T10:03:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	do you know if there is a way to get the wireless network to work on ubuntu?
2006-12-24T10:03:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	i know there is, yes
2006-12-24T10:03:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	how? i don't know
2006-12-24T10:03:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	could you guide me to some how-to? i am using one of those intel centrino ipw2200
2006-12-24T10:04:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	sorry, I'd be searching the same as you. Google is your friend
2006-12-24T10:04:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	if you have a friend with an external USB cd drive, you could borrow it
2006-12-24T10:05:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	unfortunatly most people here are very tech illiterate
2006-12-24T10:05:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	where?
2006-12-24T10:05:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	a little village in central israel. the problem is that wifi used to work on dapper
2006-12-24T10:06:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	that's very strange - have you filed a bug?
2006-12-24T10:07:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	yes, some time ago, but no change was made to it
2006-12-24T10:08:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	I'm sorry - I'm still wired in...
2006-12-24T10:09:00.000Z	Afief	ailean	no problem. but that's really an annoying bug...
2006-12-24T10:09:00.000Z	ailean	Afief	it may just not be correctly configured. but i'm sorry, i'm not the person to ask
