2006-08-03T15:48:00.000Z	tamale		what's the quickest, lightest  Desktop  i can install on a new server install of dapper ?  and how would i get it?
2006-08-03T15:49:00.000Z	django_	tamale	in my opinion the lightest *usable* wm would be fluxbox
2006-08-03T15:49:00.000Z	django_	tamale	others will disagree
2006-08-03T15:50:00.000Z	django_	tamale	yep
2006-08-03T15:50:00.000Z	django_	tamale	what is the system you are going to be using, btw?
2006-08-03T15:51:00.000Z	tamale	django_	 what do you mean
2006-08-03T15:51:00.000Z	django_	tamale	what computer?
2006-08-03T15:51:00.000Z	django_	tamale	i was wondering how slow/old it was
2006-08-03T15:51:00.000Z	tamale	django_	 It's a dual pentium III  1ghz  1U rackmount computer
2006-08-03T15:51:00.000Z	django_	tamale	flux will fly
2006-08-03T15:52:00.000Z	tamale	django_	 Last question - how hard will it be to get VNC to work?  I'll want to be able to control the desktop remotely on this machine.
2006-08-03T15:53:00.000Z	django_	tamale	should be very easy, if all the firewall/network issues are good
2006-08-03T15:54:00.000Z	django_	tamale	and i don't know if it is still as good as it was, but tightVNC was a lot less hungry than VNC
2006-08-03T15:54:00.000Z	django_	tamale	like uses less resources
2006-08-04T16:21:00.000Z	django_	tamale	 does netstat show vnc running and the port?
2006-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	django_	tamale	can you connect locally?
2006-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	django_	tamale	and is it firewalled? have to ask
2006-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	django_	tamale	 see if you can connect from the same box
2006-08-04T16:23:00.000Z	django_	tamale	yeah
2006-08-04T16:24:00.000Z	django_	tamale	well, all it is is a server and client
2006-08-04T16:26:00.000Z	tamale	django_	  I've had problems in the past with private messaging.. can we just go into ubuntu-offtopic  ?
2006-08-04T16:26:00.000Z	django_	tamale	i'm in a query with you
