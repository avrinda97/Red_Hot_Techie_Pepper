2011-07-24T01:30:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	alright so if this chat window is ontop of the firefox window. I go to drag the firefox window...it drags this one instead
2011-07-24T01:31:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	Difficult to understand exactly what the problem is based on your description. What is the chat application?
2011-07-24T01:32:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	XCHAT-Gnome But what happens is..if the Terminal window overlays my Firefox window or any other window. And if I go to click on the firefox window what it will do is drag the Terminal window instead.
2011-07-24T01:33:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	if I have Window 1 and Window 2, Window 1 is sitting ontop of Window 2. I go to drag/minimize window 2. It clicks on Window 1 instead.
2011-07-24T01:34:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	Terminal? I thought it was XChat + Firefox. Is there a terminal console as well?
2011-07-24T01:34:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	it does it with any window...doesn't matter what program window it is.
2011-07-24T01:35:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	Can you do a screencast? Try gtk-recordmydesktop
2011-07-24T01:35:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	I cannot reproduce
2011-07-24T01:35:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	istanbul is another application you can try
2011-07-24T01:35:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	also my window decoration crashes?
2011-07-24T01:36:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	I would try turning off compiz
2011-07-24T01:36:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	explain how I do this? :)
2011-07-24T01:40:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	whenever I disable OpenGL everything seems to work better?
2011-07-24T01:46:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	Download one of those two apps, press record, upload the video somewhere, post the link so we can see it
2011-07-24T01:47:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	I have to wait until this download is done
2011-07-24T01:48:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	What download is that?
2011-07-24T01:48:00.000Z	TrentH	quidnunc	VMWare..So I can do some windows things
2011-07-24T01:49:00.000Z	quidnunc	TrentH	I have to go but that approach is what I would suggest to get someone to help you. Graphics glitches are difficult to explain
