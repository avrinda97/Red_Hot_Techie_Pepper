2007-12-26T03:13:00.000Z	Oxi-Clean		If I want to install Ubuntu as the only OS on my HDD w/o the GRUB installed is there any way to do that?  I want it to just boot to Ubuntu w/o fail.

2007-12-26T03:17:00.000Z	Oxi-Clean		How can I install Ubuntu so it just boots to it, ie no GRUB asking me to run memcheck and what not?  i'm in the Ubuntu Install screen would I want to use text mode or OEM mode?
2007-12-26T03:18:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	install it normally, and I can tell you what files to edit to make that happen
2007-12-26T03:19:00.000Z	Oxi-Clean	cdm10	would i need to have two paritions? ie a swap partition if this is the only OS i plan on running on the system
2007-12-26T03:19:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	it has nothing to do with partitions
2007-12-26T03:19:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	Just install as normally, and it's a setting you can change after you install.
2007-12-26T03:20:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	btw
2007-12-26T03:20:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	hold on one sec, I can tell you waht to do now..
2007-12-26T03:21:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	When you've installed it, open Applications>Add/Remove and install StartUp-Manager (or run the command sudo aptitude install startupmanager). Then, you can configure the bootloader in System>Administration>Startup Manager.
2007-12-26T03:22:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	Well, that's 'cause your system's messed up... not because grub is causing the problem. Either way, Grub is going to have to be installed.
2007-12-26T03:24:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	What happened when you tried to start Ubuntu?
2007-12-26T03:25:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	please type my nick correctly (cdm, not cmd) so it pops up on my desktop.
2007-12-26T03:26:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	So, if you highlighted "Ubuntu" and hit enter... it would go into memtest?
2007-12-26T03:26:00.000Z	Oxi-Clean	cdm10	it had that in the commands to be executed
2007-12-26T03:27:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	So, you edited the bootloader and that messed it up?
2007-12-26T03:27:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	or was that how it was to start...
2007-12-26T03:27:00.000Z	Oxi-Clean	cdm10	thats how it was setup by default
2007-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	strange... but there's no way to load Ubuntu without a bootloader (meaning grub or lilo), so there's no way to install without a bootloader. The bootloader isn't just to allow you to select from multiple OS's.
2007-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	Oxi-Clean	cdm10	i'm going to try to reinstall and I still have problems I'll come back.  thank you
2007-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	cdm10	Oxi-Clean	sorry I couldn't solve your problem...
2007-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	Oxi-Clean	cdm10	this way I have the specific boot commands infront of me
