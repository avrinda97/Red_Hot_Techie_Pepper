2007-05-24T14:54:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008		where does imagemagick get installed when I typed aptget install imagemagick???   I can't seem to find it
2007-05-24T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	it installs a few programs. dpkg -L imagemagick|grep bin
2007-05-24T14:57:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	so if I need to know the Directory to ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick binaries, then it's /usr/bin?
2007-05-24T14:58:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	there is no imagemagick binary. they are display, etc.
2007-05-24T14:58:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	in /usr/bin ,yes
2007-05-24T14:58:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	I'm trying to configure imagemagick for gallery2 and it's asking for the directory for the binaries
2007-05-24T14:58:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	/usr/bin
2007-05-24T14:59:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	thanks
2007-05-24T14:59:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	yw
2007-05-24T15:01:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	one more thing.  gallery2 reports that my version of imagemagick (6.2.4) may have vulnerablities.  is here a way I can upgrade it with apt-get?  I'm using LAMP ubuntu server 6.06.1
2007-05-24T15:01:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	specifically it reports: Warning: This version of ImageMagick has known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands or cause a denial of service (references: 1, 2, 3, 4). You may wish to upgrade. This determination may be inaccurate for ImageMagick packages in Linux distributions.
2007-05-24T15:02:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	you should probalby be using a more recent ubuntu release
2007-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	I didn't think I was that far behind
2007-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	can I upgrade without reinstalling and creating a worse headache?
2007-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	mwe	upgrade ubuntu I mean
2007-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	you can upgrade to 6.10 I think
2007-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	maybe you can just update imagemagic somehow
2007-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	dapper is supposed to be supported still
2007-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	did you try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
2007-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	maybe there's a security update to it
2007-05-24T15:08:00.000Z	mwe	Clarrisa_2008	I think I received an update fixing some buffer overflow vulnarabilities when I ran dapper
