2007-05-24T13:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	alternate probably
2007-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	what is freevo
2007-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	it's like Windows Media Center, but free and for Linux
2007-11-03T07:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	this is the support room, if you need support, ask for it, if you want to chat about ubuntu being awful, that is not a support question
2007-11-03T07:32:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	please take it to off topic or ask a support question so we can support you
2008-03-01T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	yes, edit ~/.Xdefaults
2008-03-01T09:07:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	add a line that says Xcursor*theme: whatever
2008-03-01T09:07:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	would that change the cursor when running X11 without a WM?
2008-03-01T09:07:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	yes
2008-03-01T09:08:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	and what is the default ubuntu cursor called?
2008-03-01T09:08:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	haven't the slightest idea
2008-03-01T09:08:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	oh well, thank you very much, i'll figure it out
2008-03-01T09:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Some_Person	look in /usr/share/icons for all available cursors
2008-03-01T09:20:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	it doesnt seem to work
2008-03-01T09:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	I used Xcursor*theme:DMZ-White
2008-03-01T09:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	but when I start a new Xserver I still get the ugly "X"
2008-03-01T09:23:00.000Z	Some_Person	bruenig	am i doing something wrong? or do i need to reboot? or does it only apply to one Xserver?
