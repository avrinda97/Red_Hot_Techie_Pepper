2006-07-03T09:13:00.000Z	MiKuS		would anyone happen to know how to activate sound card drivers?

2006-07-03T09:13:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	what's lspci  say your sound chipset is ?
2006-07-03T09:15:00.000Z	MiKuS	polpak	where in the printout does it say my soundcard?
2006-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	MiKuS	polpak	i'll get the type again, hold up
2006-07-03T09:18:00.000Z	MiKuS	polpak	are you still around?
2006-07-03T09:21:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	yes
2006-07-03T09:21:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	sorry was talking to someone
2006-07-03T09:22:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	that should work fine then
2006-07-03T09:22:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	what do you mean it doesn't do more than 2 channels
2006-07-03T09:22:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	oh
2006-07-03T09:22:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	go to terminal and type alsamixer
2006-07-03T09:22:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	and adjust the 3d and amp etc settings
2006-07-03T09:23:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	some of the outputs are probably just muted
2006-07-03T09:24:00.000Z	polpak	MiKuS	sorta, but it shows more options. you can turn those options on in the "speaker icon" but it's easier for me to point you at alsamixer
2006-07-03T09:33:00.000Z	MiKuS	polpak	it didn't work :*
