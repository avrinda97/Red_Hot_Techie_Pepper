2011-05-11T08:40:00.000Z	matt__	escott	how so?
2011-05-11T08:40:00.000Z	matt__	escott	disk utility is a gui! I gotcha
2011-05-11T08:40:00.000Z	matt__	escott	eeeh:(Gimma a se

2011-05-11T08:48:00.000Z	escott	matt__	so thats the sign things are starting to go bad
2011-05-11T08:48:00.000Z	matt__	escott	*How bad? Like buy a drive tonight on amazon bad?
2011-05-11T08:50:00.000Z	escott	matt__	the disk is trying to work around the bad sectors, but it has a sector it still needs to move. that should go down if you check again. how bad is a question of how important your data is. i have 6 backup copies of all my data, because im a little paranoid
2011-05-11T08:52:00.000Z	matt__	escott	ada (160gb) has 97 bad sectors, sdb (250gb) has 3 bad sectors, and sdc (1tb) has 0 bad sectors. Generally speaking, I feel I'm ok with backups. Using truecrypt to encrypt stuff and then dropbox to back things up, also keeping my data drive as sdc, I feel ok. But theoretically speaking, am I looking at days, or could it go for years (with problems such as dd and ff showing up?)
2011-05-11T08:53:00.000Z	escott	matt__	i have no idea... i became paranoid when two hitachi deathstars went bad within 2 weeks of each other. hdd failures are much more closely correlated because of environment (temperature/vibration/humidity) than one would like
2011-05-11T08:54:00.000Z	matt__	escott	Well I'm glad right now my largest data disk is ok.

2011-05-11T09:29:00.000Z	matt__	escott	Well...are you satisfied with ssd's or do you stick with drives?
2011-05-11T09:31:00.000Z	escott	matt__	i haven't purchased one. im waiting for the technology to shake out a bit more first... too many unknowns. TRIM support and how that should be handled is completely up in the air. some hardware vendors want the SSD to provide the FS and the OS does object storage others want to expose low-level details
2011-05-11T09:31:00.000Z	matt__	escott	Well Perhaps I'll just buy a sataIII drive then.
2011-05-11T09:33:00.000Z	escott	matt__	as long as you don't put crucial data on them its probably great, i was considering a raid1 with ssd+normal hdd to get good quick reads but have a safe storage
2011-05-11T09:34:00.000Z	matt__	escott	Neat idea. But this price is very appealing: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136770
2011-05-11T09:35:00.000Z	matt__	escott	LMAO I was under the assumption on Newegg the 1Tb SataIII drives were $600+, turns out that pricing is for 20 of the drives. That's the only reason I pulled up such as small drive.
2011-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	matt__	escott	If I buy two "basic" sataIII drives, how "easy" is it to raid them?
2011-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	escott	matt__	its easy to create a raid array. setting up a raid array as a boot system takes a little bit more work (to make sure the fstab is correct and the initrd has the mdadm modules
2011-05-11T09:43:00.000Z	matt__	escott	Think I've decided on a wd 64mb sataIII drive, just figuring the size
