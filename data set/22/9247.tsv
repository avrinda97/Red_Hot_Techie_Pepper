2005-11-03T17:28:00.000Z	housetier		I want to compile something and have met most of the dependencies by installing various -dev packages. however, I have no idea what to do to get around this error message from ./configure: "configure: error: X development libraries not found". which package do I install?
2005-11-03T17:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	another option is x-window-system-dev
2005-11-03T17:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	some weirder packages require specialized x -dev stuff; if that still doesn't work, put config.log up on the pastebin and maybe we can guess at other -dev packages
2005-11-03T17:30:00.000Z	housetier	HappyFool	thoreauputic x-window-system-dev is already installed as well
2005-11-03T17:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	what app is this?
2005-11-03T17:31:00.000Z	housetier	HappyFool	thoreauputic I am trying to compile rox-session, as the injected version seems to need a slightly older dbus-glib-1 than I have here. the precompiled packages are way too old
2005-11-03T17:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	that config.log is a bit empty... ?
2005-11-03T17:41:00.000Z	housetier	HappyFool	indeed it is
2005-11-03T17:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	isn't there a config.log in the higher level dir
2005-11-03T17:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	i.e., where you ran 'AppRun' from
2005-11-03T17:42:00.000Z	housetier	HappyFool	sadly there is not, but I'll try and see if mplayer's configure spits out more useful information regarding missing x
2005-11-03T17:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	puzzling. maybe 'find -iname config.log' ?
2005-11-03T17:43:00.000Z	housetier	HappyFool	maybe I messed up something... I'll try a few things, then I'll completely reinstall all the x-related packages
2005-11-03T17:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	on http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl there is a python script to do uploads
2005-11-03T17:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	hmm
2005-11-03T17:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	i have an X.h
2005-11-03T17:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	it's part of x11proto-core-dev
2005-11-03T17:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	but i'm sure it should be installed via x-window-system-dev
2005-11-03T17:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	note that x-window-system-core and x-window-system-dev are two different packages
2005-11-03T17:57:00.000Z	housetier	HappyFool	I willing to admit I messed it all up myself. I'll purge and reinstall all those packages
2005-11-03T17:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	housetier	x11proto-core-dev *is* a dependency of x-windows-system-dev, via libx11-dev
2005-11-03T06:16:00.000Z	housetier	HappyFool	fyi I solved it by purging x-windows-whatever-dev and all the packages it depends on, then I purged all the packages that depended on it. then I reinstalled that x-window-whatever-dev and an now happily ./configure my stuff.
