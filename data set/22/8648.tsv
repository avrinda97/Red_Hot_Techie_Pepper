2005-06-20T13:07:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	any ideas?
2005-06-20T13:14:00.000Z	slept	Matthew_W	not really I never used usb serial port, you can go to the commandline unplug it and plug it  - then you'll get more information
2005-06-20T13:14:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	explain that a little further?
2005-06-20T13:15:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	 There is no change in lsusb when I plug/unplug, however, the phone (lg vx3200) realizes that it's been plugged in.
2005-06-20T13:16:00.000Z	slept	Matthew_W	<ctrl> + <alt> + <F1>, log in , unplug,plug then ther should be some information
2005-06-20T13:20:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	 No messages, and didn't know how to get back into x.

2005-06-20T13:22:00.000Z	slept	Matthew_W	did you just plugin a cable one side usb the other side serialport , or is there a device on it ?
2005-06-20T13:23:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	 Not entirely sure, one side is a USB, the other side attaches to my cell phone.
2005-06-20T13:23:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	 I had a similar cable for a motorola phone with no big lump device jigger in the middle that worked fine.
2005-06-20T13:23:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	(for the motorola phone, which is now severely dated)
2005-06-20T13:27:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	It won't even autodetect on windoze xp though, which is bothersome.
2005-06-20T13:28:00.000Z	slept	Matthew_W	what kind of cell phone is it
2005-06-20T13:30:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	 LG vx3200 or LG 3200
2005-06-20T13:30:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	hehe, I work for Telus... I should probably know this stuff lol
2005-06-20T13:32:00.000Z	slept	Matthew_W	never heard of these , did you google for modelnumber and linux ?
2005-06-20T13:33:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	 Yes, and followed the directions... so, I think I'll look for another cable *strangles www.wirelessaxis.com*
2005-06-20T13:33:00.000Z	slept	Matthew_W	good luck
2005-06-20T13:33:00.000Z	Matthew_W	slept	thanks.
