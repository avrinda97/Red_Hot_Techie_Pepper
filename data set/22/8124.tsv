2007-01-03T14:43:00.000Z	vinboy	gnomefreak	i want to unhide the whole folder, not just viewing them
2007-01-03T14:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	vinboy	what do you mean your trying to unhide it? if its hidden you want to see it use ctrl+h in nautilus

2007-01-03T14:46:00.000Z	vinboy	gnomefreak	what i mean is I want to permanently mark the folder as NOT hidden..
