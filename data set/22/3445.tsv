2008-09-24T04:47:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	check your sources
2008-09-24T04:48:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	sorry, but what does it mean to check my sources? what am I supposed to be checking in my sources?
2008-09-24T04:49:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	check to make sure you have the default sources, also, can you paste the results of: uname -a      ?
2008-09-24T04:49:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	I have the standard sources since this is a new install so I'm not sure what to be on the look out for in my software sources. "uname -r" gives 2.6.24-19-generic
2008-09-24T04:58:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	I have the standard sources since this is a new install so I'm not sure what to be on the look out for in my software sources. "uname -r" gives 2.6.24-19-generic
2008-09-24T04:59:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	and you cant find the headers for that?
2008-09-24T04:59:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	nope, it's not finding them for some reason
2008-09-24T05:00:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	in my source list I have "source code" checked
2008-09-24T05:00:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	well, I would ask that you pastebin the error that you are having.  Maybe that can shed some light

2008-09-24T05:02:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	what items should I have checked in Software Sources on the "Ubuntu Software" tab? Because everything is checked :/
2008-09-24T05:02:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	well, you dont need sources
2008-09-24T05:03:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	what release are you using?
2008-09-24T05:03:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	ok, what about the "Third Party" tab? Anything in there need to be checked for this to work?
2008-09-24T05:03:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	Hardy
2008-09-24T05:03:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	in theory, all should be unchecked
2008-09-24T05:03:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	ok, I checked them all and will retry
2008-09-24T05:04:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	xomp_	32bit?
2008-09-24T05:04:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	yes
2008-09-24T05:06:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	I don't think it's going to work lol, I have everything checked and all but it still can't find those kernel headers :S
2008-09-24T05:06:00.000Z	xomp_	danbh_intrepid	but thanks for helping anyway. Das vidanya \o
