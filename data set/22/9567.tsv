2006-05-29T07:02:00.000Z	skippy		it is a graphical frontend for apt-get
2006-05-29T07:02:00.000Z	skippy		while it isnt as good for copying and pasting from IRC, it is very good fun to browse it using the search function to find new programs to try surfnkid
2006-05-29T07:03:00.000Z	skippy		yeah surfnkid, synaptic package manager is crap when you have specific files to get
2006-05-29T07:03:00.000Z	skippy		but it is great if you want to seach for say.. a "html editor" or something like that

2006-05-29T07:03:00.000Z	skippy		but if you are installing a list of packages apt-get is better
