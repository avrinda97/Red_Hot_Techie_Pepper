2009-12-09T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rampageoberon	if you install traceroute, can you traceroute to the name?
2009-12-09T00:50:00.000Z	rampageoberon	ActionParsnip	it can't find a route there, i tried with 80 hops and see it bouncing back and forth between servers
2009-12-09T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rampageoberon	maybe your isp is having issues
2009-12-09T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rampageoberon	try with amsn or somesuch
