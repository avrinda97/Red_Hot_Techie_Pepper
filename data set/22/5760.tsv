2007-03-03T12:53:00.000Z	Ltar		what the hell
2007-03-03T12:53:00.000Z	Ltar		I can't correct the clock
2007-03-03T12:53:00.000Z	Ltar		I am not allowed to access the system configuration
2007-03-03T12:54:00.000Z	Ltar		am i going to have to launch a root terminal to change the clock time? I thought ubuntu was supposed to be more user-friendly than debian.
2007-03-03T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	Why do you need to do that?
2007-03-03T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	why not just use ntp?
2007-03-03T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	and, you use sudo, not a root terminal.
2007-03-03T12:55:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	because linux says it's 3:00 AM when, in fact, it is not.
2007-03-03T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	you're right, thats five minutes fast.
2007-03-03T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	use ntp (sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com) to update, or if you want some other ntp-related things: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/NTP.html
2007-03-03T12:55:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	no, it's 4 hours fast
2007-03-03T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	er, you sure your timezone is correct?
2007-03-03T12:56:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	yes
2007-03-03T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	alright, then it's three hours fast.  Why did you have your system clock set three hours fast?  NTP will fix that, at any rate.
2007-03-03T12:56:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	-8:00 GMT, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything this that information. nevermind, I found the clock tool under the administrative tools
2007-03-03T12:57:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	this is a fresh install of ubuntu
2007-03-03T15:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	don't sudo su, if you want a root shell, use sudo -i
2007-03-03T15:40:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	what's the difference?
2007-03-03T15:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	sudo -i sets up the environmnt better
2007-03-03T15:41:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	sudo su gives me a command line "root@name-ubuntu: /home/chuck#
2007-04-06T05:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Ltar	Just install it on her computer
2007-04-06T05:36:00.000Z	Ltar	Flannel	I guess that makes sense. Thanks, all
