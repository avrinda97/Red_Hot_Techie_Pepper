2008-12-04T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia		and then try setup (hd0) this may/maynot complain
2008-12-04T16:24:00.000Z	ikonia		the question is why this partition can't be mounted
2008-12-04T16:26:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	sorry got disconnected
2008-12-04T16:26:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	root hd1,5 gives error
2008-12-04T16:27:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	thats fine as the ext partition is reserving partitions 3 and 4 - so that makes your aprtition 7 as you rightly said, so hd1,6 will work, but the question is why can that not be mounted
2008-12-04T16:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	well this happens with me most of the times when i reload grub and i try a lot to recover from this, but finally get frustrated and i do a fresh install... and yeah as a matter of fact grub isnt able to load windows too,it says NTLDR not found
2008-12-04T16:32:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	ntldr not found is normally a windows issue due to how the aprtitioning process has gone
2008-12-04T16:32:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	i feel if the ubuntu partitions get loaded/mounted the ntldr would also vanish
2008-12-04T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	thats not correct
2008-12-04T16:33:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	i mean the problem may vanish, anyhow, what can we do about this ?
2008-12-04T16:34:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	I'm trying to walk through why your partition can't be mounted by grub,
2008-12-04T16:34:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	thanks...in the meanwhile i will google too :)
2008-12-04T16:35:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	I'll let you know as I come to something, but as I see it at the moment your disk should mount
2008-12-04T16:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	shall i try super grub?
2008-12-04T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	do'nt see how that will make a difference
2008-12-04T16:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	does the drive being LBA make a difference as mentioned in one of the posts
2008-12-04T16:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=442945 here
2008-12-04T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	lba should no longer matter
2008-12-04T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	but I don't understnd it %100
2008-12-04T16:53:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	ok... #grub exists?
2008-12-04T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	arvind_khadri_	it does
2008-12-04T16:53:00.000Z	arvind_khadri_	ikonia	ok lemme check em out then :)
