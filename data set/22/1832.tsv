2009-12-25T17:18:00.000Z	Daughain		iceroot; Ok, so this is unique to me, great.

2009-12-25T17:21:00.000Z	Daughain		iceroot; ok, how do I get the values to displayon the desktop?

2009-12-25T17:23:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	that thread has about a million conky configurations for you to look through, you have to piece together yourself the way you want it to look ;)
2009-12-25T17:25:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	I remember those days :D I wanted a conky on my desktop so bad LOL http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/ssuperkaramba.html
2009-12-25T17:26:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	SuperKaramba is MUCH easier to use than conky, you just add little applets in and stuff
2009-12-25T17:27:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	You had sensors on your desktop without installing extra software?
2009-12-25T17:28:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	after installing and configuring lm-sensors, right click your gnome-panel click add to panel
2009-12-25T17:29:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	there should be a sensors thing in the add to panel menu
2009-12-25T17:29:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	if cleaning out your heatsinks doesnt help, your thermal compound has probably evaporated, pick up some Artic Silver 5 and replace it :D
2009-12-25T17:35:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	gnome-panel is the control bar with the menus
2009-12-25T17:43:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	oh, I thought the gnome-panel applet came installed my bad ><
2009-12-25T17:54:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	what app?
2009-12-25T17:56:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	right-click on your gnome panel (thats the grey bar at the top) and click add to panel, scroll through there and there should be one that says sensors-applet, also make sure you run sudo sensors-detect in a terminal to configure lmsensors
2009-12-25T17:58:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	i reccomend that link
2009-12-25T17:59:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	also, if you sudo killall gnome-panel in a terminal it will restart the gnome-panel, click add to panel again it should be called Hardware Sensors Monitor
2009-12-25T18:00:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	=D glad to hear you got it :D
2009-12-25T18:02:00.000Z	zer_x252	Daughain	make a good backup of your system when you get it where you want it, then you can feel free to explore linux as much as you want :D
