2006-08-30T15:31:00.000Z	TBNolan		could anyone help me install TCL?
2006-08-30T15:32:00.000Z	TBNolan		i'm trying to run an eggdrop bot
2006-08-30T15:32:00.000Z	TBNolan		and upon ./configure
2006-08-30T15:32:00.000Z	TBNolan		i get an error, saying it can't find the tcl.h and other tcl files (sorry for splitting up my lines, i have a bad habbit)
2006-08-30T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	eggdrop is in the repositories
2006-08-30T15:33:00.000Z	TBNolan	jrib	no kiding?
2006-08-30T15:34:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	I kid you not, should be available to you if you have enabled universe
2006-08-31T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	install tcllib ?
2006-08-31T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	then you have the tcl library
2006-08-31T16:49:00.000Z	TBNolan	jrib	i've installed tcllib, but when i run ./configure it still says no deal
2006-08-31T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	you need the -dev package if you want to compile, search for a tcl -dev package
2006-08-31T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	if you are compiling eggdrop for some reason, you can just do 'sudo apt-get build-dep eggdrop' to get the dependencies for the package in the repos
2006-08-31T16:53:00.000Z	TBNolan	jrib	that didn't work "unable to find source package for eggdrop"
2006-08-31T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	enable the deb-src repository in your sources.list
2006-08-31T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	/etc/apt/sources.list
2006-08-31T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	honestly though I don't see a reason for compiling eggdrop yourself
2006-08-31T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	you read the docs and man page?  Maybe an online manual?  I would help but I have never used eggdrop.  I'm just speaking from experience that usually compiling it yourself will not change much
2006-08-31T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	did you get sudo apt-get build-dep eggdrop to work yet?
2006-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	do you know what you need to change in your sources.list?
2006-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	ok
2006-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	I don't know what is in your sources.list so I can't really tell you
2006-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	TBNolan	deb-src for main and universe should be ok
