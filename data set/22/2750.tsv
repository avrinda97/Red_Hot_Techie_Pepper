2009-03-19T04:32:00.000Z	gabrielR		Hi! I need to set-up a FTP server for a class, and I have a VPS running Ubuntu. I installed vsftpd, it worked, but now I need to create virtual users. But I can't install the package libdb4.4, it says it is not found
2009-03-19T04:34:00.000Z	gabrielR		Can anyone help me getting started installing vsftpd?
2009-03-19T04:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	gabrielR	sudo apt-get install vsftpd
2009-03-19T04:36:00.000Z	gabrielR	erUSUL	but I need to install libdb4.4 to create virtual users, but it says it is not found
