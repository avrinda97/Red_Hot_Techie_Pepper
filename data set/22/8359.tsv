2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	Stormx2		=)
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	Stormx2		I just did a clean feisty install
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	Stormx2		Let me check
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	how can you check..
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	matt__	sudo hdparm /dev/hdc
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	i ran sudo hdparm /dev/dvdrw, this is what i got.
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	matt__	I'm not sure DMA is used on DVDs? No idea. I get that error too.
2007-06-13T08:45:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	umm..i think so, i ran into that when trying to setup dvd decrypter in wine,it works, but slow, it asked me to turn on dma in the tutorial
2007-06-13T08:45:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	http://mrbass.org/linux/ubuntu/dvdshrink/
2007-06-13T08:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	matt__	dvd decrypter in wine? o.O You know you can do that with css?
2007-06-13T08:46:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	what do you mean, in css?
2007-06-13T08:47:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	oh, i know what you are talking about...but this rips the disk to your hard disk unencrypted. can you do that with css? (serious question)
2007-06-13T08:47:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	from what i understand, what you showed me is to play dvds....
2007-06-13T08:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	matt__	You need libdvdcss2 for READING dvds. You can use k9copy to copy them to your hard drive (unencrypted or otherwise)
2007-06-13T08:48:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	i have libdvdcss2, but k9, does it work?
2007-06-13T08:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	matt__	Why are you asking me? o.O check to see if it works....
2007-06-13T08:49:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	lol, ok
2007-06-13T08:55:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	thanks for the suggestion, k9 looks great, however, i do have a question, it has an option for "mpg4). isn't that what an ipod uses for video? i was going to try it, however, it saves it as an .avi. any knowledge there?
2007-06-13T08:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	matt__	None. I don't actually have a DVD drive. Does k9 allow you to edit a gstreamer pipeline. if so, you could figure that out.
2007-06-13T08:56:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	um..ill look into that, so i guess i'll need to find the exact specifications for ipod video...
2007-06-13T09:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	matt__	Do some googling, and also check ubuntuforums.org
2007-06-13T09:00:00.000Z	matt__	Stormx2	i don't know what i haven't thought to look there...
