2008-02-13T20:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	ctrl alt backspace
2008-02-19T09:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	it's a file, not a command
2008-02-28T01:25:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	means accepting who you are for what you are while realizing that you are what you are and others are what they are or something like that
2008-04-13T14:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	 i think the first set of numbers goes like (0=a 1=b 2=c, etc) and the second set is ( 0=1, 1=2, etc ) so hd0,0 is hda1
2008-04-13T15:00:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	my windows partition (sda1) is listed in menu.lst as hd0,0.  my ubuntu (sda2) is listed as hd0,1

2008-08-13T13:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	ok. well, just to let you know, i don't know what's causing the problem. but perhaps someone can help once you paste the logs.
2008-08-13T13:37:00.000Z	ubuntu	prince_jammys	okay hoe do I get to the logs and where did you say I sould paste them
2008-08-13T13:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	open a terminal from the menu
2009-09-22T05:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ubuntu	sometimes that error springs up with bad .ICEauthority file permissions. Did you change the permissions of files inside your home directory?
