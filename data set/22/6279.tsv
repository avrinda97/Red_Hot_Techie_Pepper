2008-09-19T22:59:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	well.. that question is getting asked every now and then..
2008-09-19T23:00:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	well i was wondering how could a deleted file by root could went to Trash
2008-09-19T23:01:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	thanks anyways ;)
2008-09-19T23:02:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	you're welcome
2008-11-27T21:57:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	what are you looking for?
2008-11-27T21:57:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	the kernels are called linux-image-blablabla
2008-11-27T21:58:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	i'm looking for the kernel version currently in intrepid and that is in hardy
2008-11-27T21:59:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	I think it's called linux-image-generic
2008-11-27T22:00:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	hmm.. that can't be checked for hardy?
2008-11-27T22:01:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	oh.. sorry.. hardy.. no, that's right.. don't remember which one is available for hardy
2008-11-27T22:01:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	packages.ubuntu.com load very slow
2008-11-27T22:01:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	if you have a hardy install you can check yourself.. apt-cache search linux-image
2008-11-27T22:02:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	nope.. i'm running something else. but i'm hunting some a kernel bug. that's why i want to make sure what hardy had in which i didn't have that issue
2008-11-27T22:04:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	ah.. my server is still running hardy.. just a sec and I'll check
2008-11-27T22:06:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	cool.. what's the install date?
2008-11-27T22:09:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	the creation date for my kernel file is 2008-10-22
2008-11-27T22:12:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	seems to be newer than the one i had, but those are only patches. thanks a lot
2008-11-27T22:12:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	good luck finding that kernel bug.. we don't need those =)
2008-11-27T22:14:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	the bug is there and i know where it is. i'm going to recompile the kernel and see. but knowing under which i had no problems is also good info to know and to trace the bug
2008-12-29T06:44:00.000Z	compengi	Slart	i thought you were asking the question about popular linux games. nick "Slack" seemed similar to you :P
2008-12-29T06:44:00.000Z	Slart	compengi	hehe.. just talking to myself.. nothing to see.. move on =)
