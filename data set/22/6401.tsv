2008-04-04T23:19:00.000Z	mitchell	olopez	are kvm and qemu stable?

2008-04-04T23:20:00.000Z	mitchell		oopez: i dont want to run a whole OS for just a programm
2008-04-04T23:20:00.000Z	mitchell		olopez; can you give me a link for it?
2008-04-04T23:21:00.000Z	olopez	mitchell	is you want run just a program you can use wine it probably can help you
2008-04-04T23:22:00.000Z	mitchell	olopez	wine is f*** buggy
2008-04-04T23:22:00.000Z	olopez		yes mitchell is really buggy ... but you can run a lot of windows programs with out use a whole O.S
2008-04-04T23:23:00.000Z	olopez	mitchell	you can add more dlls o register it to get more compatibility
2008-04-04T23:25:00.000Z	olopez	mitchell	i think wine is the only "program" that can run windows executables on unix platforms , without VM
