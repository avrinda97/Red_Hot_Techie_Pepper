2007-01-16T15:20:00.000Z	egyn		Hello, I'm quite new with ubuntu (and linux in general) and would like to use one of my computers as a backup server
2007-01-16T15:21:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	can i recommend rsyn - i have lots of guides if you need them
2007-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	egyn	hjmills	I need something which is easy to configure and maintain, i think that backuppc looked neat at the first glance
2007-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	i am using rsyn with a cron job to do incremental backups daily
2007-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	egyn	hjmills	maybe you could give me some info about that solution,
2007-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	egyn	hjmills	i would like to be able to backup several pc's on this ubuntu server as well
2007-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	should be fine - i run the job from my server and rsyn over ssh over the network
2007-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	i use wake-on-lan to turn the other pcs on as well
2007-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	egyn	hjmills	that sounds very interesting to me
2007-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	want linkage?
2007-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	egyn	hjmills	yes
2007-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	egyn	hjmills	can i easily see if my win-network-card supports wake-on-lan?

2007-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	i just tried mine and it worked - you could see if it supports wakeonlan by lookin up the spec (mine was onboard and fine)

2007-01-16T15:29:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	i mounted over the network using sshfs but i think there are other ways
2007-01-16T15:29:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	links for that - http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/10/28/how-to-mount-a-remote-ssh-filesystem-using-sshfs/

2007-01-16T15:31:00.000Z	hjmills	egyn	i was using them last night and they worked great for my basic needs
