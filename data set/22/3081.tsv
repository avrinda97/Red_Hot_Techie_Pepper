2008-12-11T13:32:00.000Z	PunyHuman		Hi, I have a problem with my wireless. It stopped working yesterday after a reboot... has beeb working fine for the last 6 months. I have an rt73usb wireless adapter. All other PC's in the house are fine. networkmanager reports that wireless is disabled, all the options are greyed out. 'dbus' detects the wireless adapter but I can't connect. Can someone please  help?
2008-12-11T13:33:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	you're sure the adapter is powered on?
2008-12-11T13:33:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	yes it is
2008-12-11T13:35:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	it can see the network, right? If so, is your host using WPA?
2008-12-11T13:36:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	it is not a WPA problem, security makes no difference. when i left click on networkmanager, everything is greyed out. eth0 and the wireless are both greyed out. when i right click, "enable networking" is ticked and enabled, but "enable wireless" is greyed out and not ticked
2008-12-11T13:37:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	could a recent update have affected the driver in any way?
2008-12-11T13:37:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	lsusb showsthe adapter, lsmod shows that the modules are loaded, dbus detects the hardware. it is some kind of networkmanager problem from what i can see
2008-12-11T13:38:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	i have not done in any updates in about 2 weeks, pc has been rebooted in between.
2008-12-11T13:38:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	i think I will try wicd
2008-12-11T13:39:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	i just plugged in my usb memory stick and nothing happened. it seems that no usb devices are working, even though dbus knows they are there
2008-12-11T13:39:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	could it have something to do with the fact that i disabled a few servics at boot time
2008-12-11T13:39:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	all I can say is that trying wicd sounds like a good idea. Reinstalling network manager is a good idea, too
2008-12-11T13:40:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	do you know which services control usb ? i used sysv-rc-conf and disabled some things i probably should not have
2008-12-11T13:41:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	wicd is supposed to work a lot better for usb wireless devices. I would try that, and if it doesn't work, then it's a USB problem
2008-12-11T13:41:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	I have no way of getting wicd on to the pc... it is wireless only, and none of my usb thumb drives are being detected
2008-12-11T13:42:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	this seems to me more like a USB problem in general rather than a wireless issue
2008-12-11T13:42:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	I had the issue with having only a wireless card, and no others. I suppose you're right, it is a usb problem..
2008-12-11T13:43:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	you could try booting into a LiveCD and testing wireless/USB functionality there
2008-12-11T13:43:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	who can help me with my usb problem them
2008-12-11T13:43:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	It works fine. it is something that I have done to my system which is causing it not to work
2008-12-11T13:43:00.000Z	PunyHuman	alfred_	livecd works fine but does not help me solve the probem
2008-12-11T13:44:00.000Z	alfred_	PunyHuman	I don't know anything about usb nonfunction
