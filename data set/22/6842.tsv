2006-10-08T14:52:00.000Z	onorin		Hello, I have an HP nx7010 laptop, with ATI 9200 and default screen resolution is 1600 x 1050. When I try to use fglrx through Xor.conf, after rebooting I got a black screen instead of gnome. What can I do ?
2006-10-08T14:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	onorin	how did you install it?
2006-10-08T14:54:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	from Synaptic
2006-10-08T14:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	onorin	you followed the wiki?
2006-10-08T14:55:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	yes I did run it, throug sudo  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-10-08T14:55:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	I heard that this is because the resoultion is too high 1600 x 1050
2006-10-08T14:56:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	 afterwards I have added some modle lines to my Xorg.conf, that I read this from some post. But it didn't work.
2006-10-08T14:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	onorin	try using the binary driver from ati.com, if you have a laptop, that helps -- especially with powersaving and resume after suspend.
2006-10-08T14:56:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	and not fglrx ?
2006-10-08T14:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	onorin	pastebin your xorg.conf and your Xorg.0.log file
2006-10-08T14:57:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	hangon

2006-10-08T15:01:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	 when I make driver "fglrx" instead of "ati" I got black screen
2006-10-08T15:02:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	did you get the post ?
2006-10-08T15:04:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	?
2006-10-08T15:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	onorin	follow the wiki guide to install the ati drivers from ati.com
2006-10-08T15:05:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	 ok I got it but what about fglrx ?
2006-10-08T15:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	onorin	just follow the instructions and you'll end up with fglrx
2006-10-08T15:06:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	ok thanks I'll check it out now
2006-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	in that howto there are two guides, one is to use fglrx, which is appereantly now working. The other one is "Using the drivers from ati.com" . So should I proceed with the latter ?
2006-10-08T15:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	onorin	yes, you want the 'use drivers from ati.com'
2006-10-08T15:37:00.000Z	onorin	fyrestrtr	 used the drivers from saveas. It didn't work. I rebooted  and I got black screen again. Then I reverted the Xorg.conf. And booted
