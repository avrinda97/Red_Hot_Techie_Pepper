2012-03-11T05:08:00.000Z	TheToff		Racoon1400: what computer do you have?
2012-03-11T05:09:00.000Z	Raccoon1400	TheToff	dell inspiron. older one, core 2 duo
2012-03-11T05:11:00.000Z	TheToff		Racoon1400: You could try these steps: open terminal and type: "sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf" without the quotes. Then, arrow down to the last line, and insert the following, without quotes: "blacklist acer-wmi". Perss CTRL + X, and when asked to save changes, press Y. Reboot, and try your wireless
2012-03-11T05:12:00.000Z	TheToff		*Press
2012-03-11T05:13:00.000Z	TheToff		@Mony: Is your surname Sobieski?
2012-03-11T05:13:00.000Z	Raccoon1400	TheToff	no acer-wmi, there is a dell wmi
2012-03-11T05:14:00.000Z	TheToff	Raccoon1400	try adding that line I gave you, blacklist acer-wmi.
2012-03-11T05:14:00.000Z	TheToff		Save the changes, reboot, and see what's up
2012-03-11T05:15:00.000Z	TheToff		with my lenovo, the shite broadcom card won't work unless I blacklist acer-wmi specifically
2012-03-11T05:16:00.000Z	TheToff	Raccoon1400	It's worth a shot to try it, man.
2012-03-11T05:17:00.000Z	TheToff	Raccoon1400	The worst that could happen is it doesn't fix the issue, and you can re-edit blacklist.conf to reflect that
2012-03-11T05:18:00.000Z	Raccoon1400	TheToff	i tried blacklisting dell-wmi. There is no acer-wmi. assume dell-wmi is the dell equivalent. It did nothing
2012-03-11T05:19:00.000Z	TheToff	Raccoon1400	did you reboot?
2012-03-11T05:21:00.000Z	Raccoon1400	TheToff	yes
2012-03-11T05:22:00.000Z	TheToff	Raccoon1400	And you said there is not an acer-wmi. Did you try it and it did not work? Did it give you an error??
2012-03-11T05:23:00.000Z	TheToff		Just to be sure.
2012-03-11T05:23:00.000Z	TheToff		Also, you are using 11.10?
2012-03-11T05:24:00.000Z	Raccoon1400	TheToff	I did lsmod, acer-wmi was not there.
2012-03-11T05:24:00.000Z	TheToff		Racoon1400: Did you check if jockey-gtk lists any restricted drivers for your card?
2012-03-11T05:25:00.000Z	Raccoon1400	TheToff	i installed the restricted driver, but it is not working
2012-03-11T05:26:00.000Z	Raccoon1400	TheToff	yes, 11.10
2012-03-11T05:27:00.000Z	TheToff	Raccoon1400	try this: apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source
