2008-02-01T06:13:00.000Z	Kloss		ljL: you also know an answer to this? hi amarok is not working well. so has anyone another suggestion for an application able to move mp3s from my Hd to my mp3 player and vice versa?+
2008-02-01T06:13:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	itunes? songbird?
2008-02-01T06:13:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	shell prompt?
2008-02-01T06:14:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	shell prompt is no good for me. :) and file managers do not recognize it. i had a little application once installed.
2008-02-01T06:14:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	what mp3 player is it ?
2008-02-01T06:15:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	it is a creative ZEN microphoto 8 GB.
2008-02-01T06:15:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	ouch ;-)
2008-02-01T06:15:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	why ouch?
2008-02-01T06:15:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	you know a solution?
2008-02-01T06:17:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	I stopped buying creative stuff a long time ago. too many bad experience wrt drivers and their attitude to floss support
2008-02-01T06:18:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	sorry I don't have a solution for you though. songbird might do what you need
2008-02-01T06:18:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	floss = free/libre/open source
2008-02-01T06:18:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	ok. :-) i will let you know when i managed it. :-)
2008-02-01T06:26:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	yes. it is working with this software: gnomad2. see also: http://blog.sebastianboettger.net/2006/08/16/creative-zen-micro-photo-geht-doch-mit-linux/
2008-02-01T06:26:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	nice one :)
2008-02-01T06:26:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	BAM!!!
2008-02-01T06:26:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	are you liking the ubuntu experience so far ?
2008-02-01T06:28:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	generally i like linux and also ubuntu. but compared to my former wind*ws system ubuntu lacks a lot of drivers.
2008-02-01T06:28:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	ah yeah, thats the hardware companies fault though. I've always tended to buy hardware that works on many operating systems deliberately
2008-02-01T06:29:00.000Z	Kloss	linxeh	i also bought a all in one hardware which should work, but it isnot, at least not completely. :(
2008-02-01T06:31:00.000Z	linxeh	Kloss	what hardare?
