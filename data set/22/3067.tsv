2008-12-16T04:46:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	sorry I meant you instead of kidrock, read up
2008-12-16T04:48:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	what video card?
2008-12-16T04:48:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	ATI? NVIDIA?
2008-12-16T04:49:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	and you have installed and enabled propertiery drivers (excuse spelling)
2008-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	hmmmm, mesa? as in 3dfx?
2008-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	or software opengl?
2008-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	oxiii	phix	i dont know? I guess software ogl?
2008-12-16T04:50:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	that is a bad idea
2008-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	oxiii	phix	I want to try the performance of same demos over mesa
2008-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	oxiii	phix	I need to test if the library Im testing is working with mesa
2008-12-16T04:51:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	you have a video card with 3D acceleration, using software opengl / mesa is like owning a car but pushing it around instead of driving it
2008-12-16T04:52:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	ok, well how is this ubuntu relavent?
2008-12-16T04:53:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	and you are asking a generic question, that actually relates more to another channel :)
2008-12-16T04:56:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	umm why are you trying to do this in the first place? just benchmarking? or something else?
2008-12-16T04:58:00.000Z	oxiii	phix	im triying to test a game engine, that I need to fix to run on 64bit. It will draw graphics the wrong way with hardware acceleration, and I want to know how it behaves using mesa
2008-12-16T04:58:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	ok, well I assume the same since mesa is doing the same thing only in software instead of hardware
2008-12-16T04:59:00.000Z	oxiii	phix	I'm not the author and i really haven't looked into the code yet, but I'm trying to see if it will drop to SDL or keep using ogl instead
2008-12-16T04:59:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	hmmm
2008-12-16T04:59:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	well I wish I could be more help to you
2008-12-16T05:00:00.000Z	oxiii	phix	thank you for trying, anyway
2008-12-16T05:00:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	my plesure
2008-12-16T05:01:00.000Z	phix	oxiii	and thank LjL for unbanning me so I could attempt to assist you, let me know how you go with it and if you have any other ubuntu questions let me know also :P
