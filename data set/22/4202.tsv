2009-10-30T03:59:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	Of course yeah i have that installed i shall use it
2009-10-30T03:51:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	have a usb thumb drive? you can use that
2009-10-30T03:52:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	Sys > Admin > USB startup disk creator
2009-10-30T03:53:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	I know, i have created one numerous times but some kind of bios problem is preventing me
2009-10-30T03:53:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	you'll need to configure the bios properly to boot from usb. i had trouble at first too
2009-10-30T03:55:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	I managed it before i think, but now whenever i switch to usb-zip it jsut ignores it completely i shall try a few more times with it
2009-10-30T03:55:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	i had to enable booting to usb, _and_ set the boot order. check for both
2009-10-30T03:56:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	Yeh i couldn't find a booting to usb option anywhere, also i remember from previous experiences trying all the different usb slots tends to help
2009-10-30T03:56:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	might also need to do a hard reboot, rather than soft reboot
2009-10-30T03:57:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	that prolly triggered a hard reboot due to hardware change. just power off completely before starting up again
2009-10-30T03:58:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	What should i use to format my stick in the appropriate format?
2009-10-30T03:58:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	fat32
2009-10-30T03:58:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	i think the usb creator takes care of that
2009-10-30T03:59:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	Nope told me there is not enough space, where is the usb format tool in jaunty?
2009-10-30T03:59:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	install gparted
2009-10-30T04:02:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	Ahhh maybe it was because my usb stick didn't have a boot flag. gparted just added one, do you think that was it?
2009-10-30T04:02:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	quite possibly
2009-10-30T04:28:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	damn no luck just keep getting a meesage saying failed to boot press any key to restart
2009-10-30T04:29:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	did you use the usb creator? i find that to be the one that worked for me
2009-10-30T04:30:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	what iso did you use? sure the iso is good?
2009-10-30T04:31:00.000Z	conb123	tanath	Only just got it from the karmic torrent today, i think i may have found the soltuion though someone on forums is mentioning issues with my particular stick when booting
2009-10-30T04:31:00.000Z	tanath	conb123	ah
