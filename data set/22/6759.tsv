2009-09-22T05:06:00.000Z	agliodbs		how stable is xfs on ubuntu these days?
2009-09-22T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	it's not  that  used,  and it will be ok with a seperate /boot in  Ext3
2009-09-22T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	Ext4  is optional in 9.04 :)   and default in 9.10
2009-09-22T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	might have an issue  or two for some though, but  most it's fine
2009-09-22T05:08:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	would you use ext4 for a boot device at this point?
2009-09-22T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	I have used  9.04 for  / and  /home in 9.04,  and so on.   Really nice fast boot up, disck checking after 23 or so boots, and shut down.   Thing is  if big files are deleted from it, there might be a kernel lock up issue,  but other then that it's  pretty much fine really in 9.04.
2009-09-22T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	for a proper server say a commerical one or something like that you should be using 8.04
2009-09-22T05:10:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	nah, this is just a server for my own use
2009-09-22T05:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	well  servers don't get  booted up usaully, so Ext3 should be rather fine for one
2009-09-22T05:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	ok check your ISO as well
2009-09-24T06:42:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	so any reason why visudo would crash an ssh connection?
2009-09-24T06:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	hmm that's your response to me for !language, and I don't know
2009-09-24T06:44:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	yep, it is
2009-09-24T06:44:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	I could argue with you about abbreviations, but I'd rather ask a question.  ;-)
2009-09-24T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	Well you should go back to asking it to the whole channel,  and  give it some time, and you might get a proper reply to it.
2009-09-24T06:48:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	I think if anyone was going to answer, they would have already ... it'll be a little mystery for now
2010-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	old or new Lexmark printer?
2010-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	older
2010-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	agliodbs	sebsebseb	optra m412
2010-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	good and bad news, probably bad news for you though
2010-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	bad news is that Lexmark are known for bad Linux support,  however more recently they do actsually support Linux properly, even have the Tux penguin on their boxes
2010-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	agliodbs	there may be a way to configure it and get it working,  but you probably won't get much luck
