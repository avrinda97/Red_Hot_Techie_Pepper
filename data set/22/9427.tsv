2004-11-08T15:59:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		how do I modify the boot loader from ubuntu?
2004-11-08T16:01:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		permission denied on /boot/grub/menu.lst
2004-11-08T16:01:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		(from root terminal)
2004-11-08T16:02:00.000Z	xenonite	nathanieldelaney	do you have a separate boot partition?
2004-11-08T16:02:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		yeah
2004-11-08T16:03:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		dont you have to?
2004-11-08T16:03:00.000Z	xenonite		so type `mount' and look if it is mounted readonly
2004-11-08T16:05:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		I don't see it.  my goal is this:  on the boot partition, the first boot loader is grub, and at the bottom of the boot loader list is windows.  if i hit windows, it sends me to the windows boot loader.  If I hit windows from there, It won't let windows boot.  i think perhaps if the windows boot loader was alone on the boot partition, it would let windows load.
2004-11-08T16:06:00.000Z	xenonite	nathanieldelaney	ok you got the `mount` in a terminal?
2004-11-08T16:06:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		yeah
2004-11-08T16:07:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		i don't see anything called boot
2004-11-08T16:07:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		i have /dev/hdc1, proc, sysfs, devpts, tmpfs, usbfs
2004-11-08T16:08:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		all of them are listed with "on _____ type ____" following
2004-11-08T16:08:00.000Z	xenonite		yes thats ok
2004-11-08T16:10:00.000Z	xenonite		so what comes up when you type: sudo fdisk -l
2004-11-08T16:13:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney	xenonite	 should I paste all 8 lines or so in here or just give you some specifics
2004-11-08T16:17:00.000Z	xenonite	nathanieldelaney	so it seems you already installed windows
2004-11-08T16:17:00.000Z	xenonite	nathanieldelaney	and you don't have got a separate boot partition
2004-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		hmm
2004-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	nathanieldelaney		must I jump through many hoops to get windows booting again?
2004-11-08T16:22:00.000Z	xenonite	nathanieldelaney	on my ubuntu-setup, the windows is started by hitting ESC on boot, after the bios
2004-11-08T16:23:00.000Z	xenonite	nathanieldelaney	ubuntu found win automatically, i didnt hoop ;)
