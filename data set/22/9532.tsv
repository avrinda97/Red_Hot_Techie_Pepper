2004-10-05T10:05:00.000Z	Dougall		anyone know if I install the fglrx ATI gfx drivers using apt, it should overwrite or remove the corresponding Mesa libraries ?
2004-10-05T10:07:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	it does divert them using dpkg-divert
2004-10-05T10:08:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	is there something I have to do manually, because it still seems to be loading the Mesa libs... was wondering what I was doing wrong...
2004-10-05T10:08:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	do dpkg-divert --list, it should list diversion of /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.so.1.2 to /usr/share/fglrx/diversions/libGL.so.1.2 by fglrx-driver
2004-10-05T10:09:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	and if not ?
2004-10-05T10:10:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	then look in /var/lib/dpkg/info/fglrx-driver.preinst
2004-10-05T10:10:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	thanks... will do.
2004-10-05T10:12:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	I see the diversion listed, but it's still loading the Mesa Lib...
2004-10-05T10:14:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	how big it is? it should be 658984 bytes if it's diverted
2004-10-05T10:22:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	yep, that's exactly how it should be... (try uninstalling fglrx-driver if you don't believe :-)
2004-10-05T10:27:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	try running fgl_glxgears
2004-10-05T10:28:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	anyway, how do you know that it is not working?
2004-10-05T10:28:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	slow 3d and the results of fglrxinfo
2004-10-05T10:29:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	and have you changed XFree96Config to use fglrx driver?
2004-10-05T10:33:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	do lsmod | grep fglrx
2004-10-05T10:36:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	there should be lot info starting with fglrx
2004-10-05T10:38:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	noprob.  I was fighting to get it work before...
2004-10-05T10:57:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	if you want to know, the issue ended up that I was using the included ATI AGP support, 
2004-10-05T11:07:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	strange it should work too (but I am using kernel version, because I think it's newer...)
2004-10-05T11:09:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	not sure... it's an nforce chipset if that matters...
2004-10-05T11:11:00.000Z	ondrej	Dougall	ahh, I think that ATI is using some older version of AGP code and support for nforce is relatively new
2004-10-05T11:12:00.000Z	Dougall	ondrej	but the bottom line is that it works now, so I can continue to explore... thanks for all your hrlp.
