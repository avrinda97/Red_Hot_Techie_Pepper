2010-04-30T18:30:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	testuser is the owner of this directory
2010-04-30T18:30:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	he can read and write to it
2010-04-30T18:31:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	people in the group testuser can read and ls the directory
2010-04-30T18:31:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	others can do as well
2010-04-30T18:48:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	try this: http://wiki.debian.org/Permissions
2010-04-30T18:51:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tarzeau	yeah , thank you , but i already read that and that is why i am here asking
2010-04-30T18:51:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	because you didn't understand it
2010-04-30T18:51:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	ok create a group for those two users
2010-04-30T18:51:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	then add them to the group using adduser
2010-04-30T18:52:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	then make sure the group-owner of the directory is that new group
2010-04-30T18:52:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	that's it, set permissionas as you want for the group rwx or r-x
2010-04-30T18:52:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tarzeau	ok
2010-04-30T18:53:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tarzeau	one last question, what naming convention will you use for the group name in this case
2010-04-30T18:54:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	we use names like: wwwastro or astro for webpages of astronomy, and astronomy users
2010-04-30T18:56:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tarzeau	and what will you use if its a group to exchange files between two system using that folder /home/testuser/DANS
2010-04-30T19:11:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tarzeau	ok i created a newgroup, and i added my 2 users to that group, and i changed the folder group to the new group i just created, and i changed the folder group permission (chmod g+rwx /path) . and still i couldn't delete a file from that folder..please help
2010-04-30T19:12:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	did those two users login freshly or use the newgrp command?
2010-04-30T19:12:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	if you add people to groups, they're not automatically added to the group, when they're already logged in
2010-04-30T19:12:00.000Z	tarzeau	Mcl0vin	id tells you the details
2010-04-30T19:12:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tarzeau	errr
2010-04-30T19:14:00.000Z	Mcl0vin	tarzeau	thank you , i had to logout and log back in
