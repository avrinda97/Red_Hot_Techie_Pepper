2007-01-05T06:42:00.000Z	tommyv		better dm_ ?
2007-01-05T06:43:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	thanks, now what were you trying to do with this link?
2007-01-05T06:44:00.000Z	tommyv	dm_	I am trying to install the mac-menu bar but the instructions are so vague and I am a relative newbie
2007-01-05T06:44:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	let me take a min to look at them,
2007-01-05T06:45:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	are you running windows or KDE
2007-01-05T06:45:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	err GNOME or KDE
2007-01-05T06:45:00.000Z	tommyv	dm_	gnome
2007-01-05T06:45:00.000Z	tommyv	dm_	i understand that the feature I am trying to get is available natively on KDE, but I prefer gnome.
2007-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	ewwwwww this is a messy hack, you have to patch the kernel, which is well beyond what you should be doing right now, and i cant suggest how, because i myself dont knowhow to do it
2007-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	what feature?
2007-01-05T06:46:00.000Z	tommyv	dm_	to make menu bars like on mac os x, where File Edit View and stuff like that is at the top menu bar
2007-01-05T06:47:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	whisper ... Gnome is better, but dont let the KDE guys know :P
2007-01-05T06:48:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	hmm well to me it looks like those are only graphical and menu bar hacks, not a mac guy. but meh.
2007-01-05T06:49:00.000Z	tommyv	dm_	It is a really cool feature, one of mac os x's best, and I really want to find a way to get this hack working :-P
2007-01-05T06:49:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	what i got from it, is google gtk2 source( should be a download) , cd to the file, do patch ( he has the code to do it there ) and i dont know how to update the kernal and compile, : /
2007-01-05T06:50:00.000Z	tommyv	dm_	i can download the source, and cd to the file, but i didnt know how to do the patch
2007-01-05T06:50:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	patch -p0 < path/to/file
2007-01-05T06:50:00.000Z	tommyv		okay, thanks dm_, i will give it a shot.
2007-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	but its asking you to recomplie the kernel which is not a novice thing to do.
2007-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	like i said i dont know how to do it.
2007-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	tommyv	dm_	where does it say to recompile the kernel o.O
2007-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	dm_	tommyv	hmm musta read that wrong , nm, just a .compile make and install, for the hack
