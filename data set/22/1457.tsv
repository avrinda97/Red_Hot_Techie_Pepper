2010-07-29T08:20:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		AAH! I meant to delete a partition and created a new partition table. It said that it will be implemented on reboot. Can I fix it?
2010-07-29T08:21:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		So if I use gparted to create a new partition table for a currently mounted drive, is there any way to fix that???
2010-07-29T08:22:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		as in, restore the partition table of the drive, or will it be wiped on the next reboot?
2010-07-29T08:22:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	very bad idea, and gparted wouldn't even allow on a mounted drive
2010-07-29T08:23:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	now when I reopen gparted it doesn't bring up the drive
2010-07-29T08:24:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	it was mounted into three partitions and I was trying to delete the middle one... and thought I needed a new partition table. What can I do??
2010-07-29T08:24:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	not mounted: divided. Two are currently mounteded
2010-07-29T08:25:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	oo, you set a new partitable on a drive where you still would have needed the other two partis ?
2010-07-29T08:27:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	yes, that was the plan. But I wasn't thinking and made a new partition table for the whole drive. The computer seems to be working find, but I got the following in the terminal: http://paste.ubuntu.com/470510/
2010-07-29T08:27:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	so, what you need is another sys, and then use testdisk to recover it, that'll be a bit of a hassle then
2010-07-29T08:27:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	that actually won't be a problem to boot up another system on the same rig, coincidentally enough. But can I do it before I shut the computer down with gpart?
2010-07-29T08:28:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	wellwell, I told you gparted won't do, if anything is mounted there.. gparteed still open ?
2010-07-29T08:29:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	not gparted, gpart
2010-07-29T08:29:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	I've closed it and opened it--same options are availabel taht were there immediately following my stupid stupid action
2010-07-29T08:29:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	hm , I don't what command you issued actually, so first a reboot and then see what really happened will be way to go then
2010-07-29T08:31:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	which, if any of the partis was mounted, shouldn't be possible, again: gparted-gui or parted from terminal ?
2010-07-29T08:31:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	gparted-gui
2010-07-29T08:32:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	I invoke it from the terminal
2010-07-29T08:32:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	so you might be lucky, just reboot and check the disk again
2010-07-29T08:32:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	DasEi	fair enough I guess, I'll give it a shot. In the meantime I'm running gpart
2010-07-29T08:42:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	yupp
2010-10-23T03:49:00.000Z	DasEi	econdudeawesome	someone having physicall access to your comp
