2008-03-10T23:00:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	Where are you trying to save the file?
2008-03-10T23:00:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	Are you sure you can't save the theme somewhere in ~/.amsn/ ?
2008-03-10T23:01:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	Then you'd have to use sudo to move the file there.
2008-03-10T23:02:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	The amsn documentation actually says to install skins in /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.amsn/skins
2008-03-10T23:05:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	Did you get my message?
2008-03-10T23:06:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	Read http://amsn.sourceforge.net/devwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Installing+Plugins+and+Skins
2008-03-10T23:06:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	No.  Just read the link I just pasted.
2008-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	 The link I pasted says to installs skins into "/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.amsn/skins"
2008-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	Whats your ubuntu user name?
2008-03-10T23:09:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	/home/victor/.amsn/skins/
2008-03-10T23:09:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	put the files in there.  Press ctrl-h in the gnome file browser to see hidden folders like .amsn
2008-03-10T23:18:00.000Z	Pici	kepahe	press ctrl-h
