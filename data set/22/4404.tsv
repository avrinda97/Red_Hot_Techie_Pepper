2009-04-03T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	sudo mount /dev/<partition anme> /mount/point -t ntfs-3g -o uid=1000,force
2009-04-03T04:17:00.000Z	gaby	ActionParsnip	Im trying this instructions http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-535808.html because the problem is similar
2009-04-03T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	looks good, you need to use ntfs-3g for write access
2011-10-10T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	karmic is no longer supported
2011-10-10T22:19:00.000Z	gaby	ActionParsnip	: how can i do it then ?
2011-10-10T22:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	you need to upgrade to Lucid
2011-10-10T22:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	or clean install Natty or even Oneiric :)
2012-11-13T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	what filesystem does the partition use?
2012-11-13T00:36:00.000Z	gaby	ActionParsnip	NTFS
2012-11-13T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	when you last unplugged it from a system, did you use the 'safey remove' functionality
2012-11-13T00:38:00.000Z	gaby	ActionParsnip	they are not in another system and not unplugged - its on the same machine here - and also the USB with Fat32 system file ... they are not mountable here . ... and YESSSS i always use SAFE REMOVE
2012-11-13T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gaby	I suggest you put it in a Windows PC (or boot to Windows if you dual boot) and chkdsk the NTFS partition
