2010-12-26T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	Have you tried the instructions on the ubuntu.com download page?
2010-12-26T06:05:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	Yes I have, to the letter.
2010-12-26T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	They look to me like they shouldn't actually work, but for now I'm giving Ubuntu the benefit of the doubt.
2010-12-26T06:05:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	why do you think the shouldn't work?
2010-12-26T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	Because you can't magically convert a .iso image into a bootable usb image.
2010-12-26T06:07:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	Steve Jobs wants us to believe in magic....
2010-12-26T06:08:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	So I guess that begs the question, "What makes a bootable image, a bootable image?"
2010-12-26T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	Ahh, I understand the directions now. They will only work if you're booting from an intel mac, they won't work for creating a USB that's bootable on a BIOS based machine.
2010-12-26T06:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	Still not sure what that conversion is actually supposed to do, but that makes the instructions at least plausible.
2010-12-26T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	Are you trying to make a USB for an intel mac or a BIOS based system?
2010-12-26T06:14:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	Its an acer laptop
2010-12-26T06:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	Ok. Do you want to try a combination of beta code and instructions that I can't actually test at the moment?
2010-12-26T06:16:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	Why do you think the ubuntu instructions only work for an intel based mac, as opposed to a PC?
2010-12-26T06:17:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	Ohhh Beta....
2010-12-26T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	The Ubuntu liveCD images contain grub-efi, which be loaded via USB and a syslinux install that is only configured to boot from CD .
2010-12-26T06:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	^^
2010-12-26T06:20:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	that would work, but unfortunately I don't have any CD-RW at home which is why I'm trying to create a bootable USB.
2010-12-26T06:20:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	Its a major catch 22. In order to create a bootable USB I need a CD... Which if I had I wouldn't need a bootable USB. Irony....
2010-12-26T06:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	Super GRUB2 DIsk beta..
2010-12-26T06:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Musashi0011_	This would allow you to make the USB from OSX.
2010-12-26T06:26:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	sounds great...
2010-12-26T06:26:00.000Z	Musashi0011_	Jordan_U	Anything with a Super prepended to it must be awesome!
