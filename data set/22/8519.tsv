2005-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	mophat		i thought i had my /etc/hdparm.conf setup nicely
2005-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	mophat		then all of a sudden, 32 bit stopped working on everything
2005-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	mophat		can someone link me to a 32 bit hdparm.conf
2005-07-20T13:34:00.000Z	mophat		i need to get this achine out in minutes
2005-07-20T13:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	i can paste by hdparm.conf to the pastebin, if you like. not sure if it'll help you...
2005-07-20T13:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	stand by...
2005-07-20T13:37:00.000Z	mophat	HappyFool	: thx
2005-07-20T13:38:00.000Z	mophat	HappyFool	: anyway i can easily conf out those numbers without using VI
2005-07-20T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	http://pastebin.ubuntulinux.nl/603
2005-07-20T13:39:00.000Z	mophat	HappyFool	: I'm at the link, is there anyway i can remove all those numbers from it
2005-07-20T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	just select more carefully
2005-07-20T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	the lines are in a separate table column
2005-07-20T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	or press the 'download' button at the top
2005-07-20T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	that /dev/hdc entry may not be appropriate for your system -- it's a custom entry for my DVD-drive
2005-07-20T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	comment out the /dev/hdc parts of the file i pasted
2005-07-20T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	you've uncommented everything? why?
2005-07-20T13:52:00.000Z	mophat	HappyFool	: not everything , just between /dev and the end }
2005-07-20T13:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	yes. don't try to apply hdparm to those
2005-07-20T14:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	look in /etc/init.d/boostmisc.sh
2005-07-20T14:37:00.000Z	mophat	HappyFool	 if i add that line before the  ": exiit 0"
2005-07-20T14:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	mophat	yip
