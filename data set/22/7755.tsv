2007-02-23T07:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	also run sudo apt-get autoremove
2007-02-23T07:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	I havent seen a epmty file name error before I am not sure what to do with that :/
2007-02-23T07:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	I know what the problem is AUTOMATIX messed up your system ask in #automatix to see if they can fix it for you
2007-02-23T07:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	every error you get from now on has something to do with automatix. my advise to you is save what you can and do a fresh install
2007-02-23T07:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	we do not / WILL NOT support automatix :/ sorry dude
2007-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	nope
2007-02-23T08:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	its like saying Im gonna take this hammer and smash my windshield then put the hammer away is my window still broken?
2007-02-23T08:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	prem	perhaps you should tell the automatix ppl to put the warning on theyre page
