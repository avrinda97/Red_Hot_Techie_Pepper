2007-11-04T21:52:00.000Z	murlidhar		how do solve it
2007-11-04T21:52:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	you running 7.10?
2007-11-04T21:53:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	yes
2007-11-04T21:53:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	try unmounting the drive and removing it and plugging it back in
2007-11-04T21:54:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	i am have the read /write access on that drive but not on a particular folder
2007-11-04T21:54:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	rightclick the folder and select properties
2007-11-04T21:55:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	and go to the permissions tab
2007-11-04T21:55:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	say owner root
2007-11-04T21:55:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	thats a problem. you want to change ownership to your normal user, probably.
2007-11-04T21:56:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	how do change that . i know the root password
2007-11-04T21:57:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	chown yourusername pathtofolder
2007-11-04T21:57:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	for example, "chown murlidhar /media/drive/some/folder"
2007-11-04T21:59:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	says operation not permitted . btw it is my music folder
2007-11-04T21:59:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	/media/sda9/Music
2007-11-04T21:59:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	sudo in front
2007-11-04T21:59:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	i was in root
2007-11-04T22:00:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	"sudo chown murlidhar /media/sda9/Music"
2007-11-04T22:00:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	(assuming your username is murlidhar)
2007-11-04T22:00:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	did that it still says ownership not permitted and my username is murlidhar
2007-11-04T22:01:00.000Z	murlidhar	jonasj	^
2007-11-04T22:01:00.000Z	jonasj	murlidhar	that is very strange
