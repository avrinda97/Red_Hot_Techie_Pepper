2010-06-30T17:30:00.000Z	delinquentme		ive got the same kernel... and same app version.
2010-06-30T17:30:00.000Z	delinquentme		with different options
2010-06-30T17:30:00.000Z	delinquentme		oh duh. hah! good call
2010-06-30T17:31:00.000Z	delinquentme		thanks for the correction :D i thought kernel  = ubuntu 10.04
2010-06-30T17:31:00.000Z	delinquentme		is that incorrect?
2010-06-30T17:32:00.000Z	delinquentme		... Hmmm ok i officially have no idea what a kernel is
2010-06-30T17:33:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	and the best about linux today is that you dont have to know what a kernel is to use gnu/linux :)
2010-06-30T17:35:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	the kernel is called linux. linux is "just" a kernel, ubuntu( gnu/linux) is a distribution, building a software-stack around the kernel
2010-06-30T17:36:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	the kernel is the OS, the rest is a distribution. ubuntu ist not an OS, its a linux-distribution also called gnu/linux
2010-06-30T17:36:00.000Z	delinquentme	iceroot	*thumbs up * that makes sense
2010-06-30T17:43:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	yes
2012-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	its not in the repos anymore
2012-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	you have to download it from the oracle website
2012-03-02T00:46:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	oracle is evil and is not allowing anymore to provide java
2012-03-02T00:46:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	the best is to use openjdk instead of sun/oracle java
2012-03-02T00:47:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
2012-03-02T01:52:00.000Z	iceroot	delinquentme	amd64 can adress more memory, some application may be faster but you will not see the difference in speed. if possible always use amd64
