2007-02-26T08:04:00.000Z	Marintia		Hi how can I connect my xubuntu automatically to internet? is using a wireless card
2007-02-26T08:04:00.000Z	Marintia		but when i reboot i need to configure everything again
2007-02-26T08:06:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	can you pastebin the contents of your /etc/network/interfaces file?
2007-02-26T08:09:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	do alt-f2 and type "gedit /etc/network/interfaces". Also, please put my full IRC nick, cables, in front of messages meant for me. You can use <tab> to autocomplete IRC nicknames.
2007-02-26T08:10:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	my mistake. Do alt-f2 and paste in this command: "gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces"
2007-02-26T08:10:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	and be sure to use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-02-26T08:11:00.000Z	Marintia	cables	 i did nothin appears
2007-02-26T08:11:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	do you know how to open a terminal?
2007-02-26T08:12:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	open a terminal and do "ls /etc/network | grep interfaces". You can paste a command into the terminal using ctrl-shift-v.
2007-02-26T08:14:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	you're not putting the command into the alt-f2 window correctly.
2007-02-26T08:15:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	do this: "sudo less /etc/network/interfaces"
2007-02-26T08:17:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	can you go to the folder /etc/network (put that into alt-f2) then paste that into paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-02-26T08:18:00.000Z	Marintia	cables	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7597/
2007-02-26T08:18:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	thanks, hold on
2007-02-26T08:19:00.000Z	Marintia	cables	 thank you
2007-02-26T08:20:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	it looks right. I'm not sure why it's not saving your settings.
2007-02-26T08:21:00.000Z	Marintia	cables	ok :) well thank you very much :)
2007-02-26T08:23:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	no problem. I'm sorry I couldn't figure out the problem.
2007-02-26T08:27:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	keep asking here, someone else who's more familiar with this will probably be able to figure out the problem.
2007-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	are you using Ubuntu or Kubuntu?
2007-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	there's your answer
2007-02-26T09:05:00.000Z	cables	Marintia	that works in Kubuntu.
