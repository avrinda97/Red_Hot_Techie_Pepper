2006-06-16T11:41:00.000Z	hkais		really nobody here with evolution?
2006-06-16T11:41:00.000Z	judah	hkais	hi..
2006-06-16T11:41:00.000Z	hkais	judah	hi
2006-06-16T11:42:00.000Z	judah	hkais	i'll assume that you have all of the options clicked in evolution and would expect it to work?
2006-06-16T11:42:00.000Z	judah	hkais	i'm pretty sure that the way the filter works in evolution is that it needs to start LEARNING spam.
2006-06-16T11:42:00.000Z	hkais	judah	yes
2006-06-16T11:42:00.000Z	judah	hkais	so once you start tagging things spam with that big JUNK button..
2006-06-16T11:42:00.000Z	judah	hkais	it should start to learn betterz.
2006-06-16T11:43:00.000Z	hkais	judah	okay i have done this for about 200 mails. but my evolution doesn't filter anything
2006-06-16T11:43:00.000Z	judah		hrm.
2006-06-16T11:43:00.000Z	judah	hkais	you would think it would learn something by then.
2006-06-16T11:44:00.000Z	hkais	judah	how can i figure out if the spamfilter is activated if i get mails, or i trigger evolution to check for spam
2006-06-16T11:44:00.000Z	judah	hkais	dpkg -l | grep spam  so you have spamassassin and spamc installed?
2006-06-16T11:45:00.000Z	hkais	judah	no i have bogofilter
2006-06-16T11:45:00.000Z	hkais	judah	i read, that bogofilter is the default for dapper
2006-06-16T11:45:00.000Z	judah	hkais	hrm. i have that installed too.
2006-06-16T11:46:00.000Z	hkais	judah	have you defined own filters?
2006-06-16T11:46:00.000Z	judah	hkais	no.. evolution has done all the magic.
2006-06-16T11:47:00.000Z	hkais	judah	that is really odd. I had the issue under breezy and now also under dapper...
2006-06-16T11:47:00.000Z	judah	hkais	do you have evolution-plugins installed?
2006-06-16T11:48:00.000Z	judah	hkais	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=191901
