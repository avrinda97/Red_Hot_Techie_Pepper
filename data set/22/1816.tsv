2010-01-08T13:07:00.000Z	Real_Ubot		I have a laptop that has got WIndows 7 64-bit as original operating system. Shall I use the 64 bit verion of Ubuntu or the 32 bit version?
2010-01-08T13:08:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	you can use both
2010-01-08T13:08:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	but if you have more than 3.5gb of ram you wont be able to utilize more than that on a i386 system
2010-01-08T13:08:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	Ok, but will one be a better choice than the other?
2010-01-08T13:09:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	then you should probably consider the 64bit version
2010-01-08T13:09:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	I have 4GB of RAM.
2010-01-08T13:09:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	Ok, will Ubuntu 32 bit nly handle at most 3.5GB?
2010-01-08T13:09:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	you might want to consider running ubuntu virtualized
2010-01-08T13:09:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	yes
2010-01-08T13:15:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	Why running Ubuntu virtualizeD?
2010-01-08T13:16:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	that way you dont have to dualboot, and you can run both OSs simultanously
2010-01-08T13:18:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	Yeah, but then I will have less performance?
2010-01-08T13:18:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	not necessarily
2010-01-08T13:19:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	Why not dualboot? I want to use Ubuntu as default operating system but since the laptop has got WIndows 7 as default operating system I want to have it installed too.
2010-01-08T13:20:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	That was ment fotr you.
2010-01-08T13:21:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	what sort of work are you going to do on either OS?
2010-01-08T13:24:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	I'm going to use browse the Net, mail, chat (Pidgin & Skype), Spotify. Well rather ordinary things, nothing special. Well, I'm going to code too. Like writing an executing Java programs I have written.
2010-01-08T13:25:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	then you might as well run ubuntu virtualized :)
2010-01-08T13:25:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	How will it affect the battery time? I have heard that Ubuntu has less battery time than Windows 7. How will a vitualisation solution affect the battery time?
2010-01-08T13:28:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	it as only a suggestion :)
2010-01-08T13:29:00.000Z	Real_Ubot	MorphyNOR	Well, but what benefits and disadvantages will I suffer running it virtualized instead of as dualboot?
2010-01-08T13:30:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	Real_Ubot	benefits, no dualbooting, easier to install, drawbacks: more load
