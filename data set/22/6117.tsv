2007-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	kaktus		Problem: The external disk is bigger than the disk on the computer :)
2007-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	kaktus		I have more files on the ext. HDD than free space on the local HDD
2007-03-10T06:58:00.000Z	kaktus		is it possible to run windows in linux?
2007-03-10T06:58:00.000Z	kaktus		so that I can access the files on the external...
2007-03-10T06:59:00.000Z	kaktus		Because I will be "locked" to comps. running linux if I want to transfer files to eg. windows comps!
2007-03-10T07:00:00.000Z	kaktus		I've heard that there is a spacelimitation on FAT32 partitions..
2007-03-10T07:00:00.000Z	kaktus		32 GB=
2007-03-10T07:00:00.000Z	kaktus		?
2007-03-10T07:00:00.000Z	kaktus		my external HDD is 320GB :P
2007-03-10T07:01:00.000Z	kaktus		Can I change filesystem without harming the files?
2007-03-10T07:01:00.000Z	h1st0	kaktus	only in windows like converting fat32 to NTFS etc...
2007-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	h1st0	kaktus	sudo gparted
2007-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	h1st0	kaktus	err gksu gparted
2007-03-11T06:16:00.000Z	kaktus	h1st0	"Could not access sda1" or something
2007-03-11T06:16:00.000Z	h1st0	kaktus	when you try to launch gparted?
2007-03-11T06:17:00.000Z	kaktus	h1st0	Yes, that program didn't do anything else than labeling my disk to "swisnife1" or something else, I suspect a link to the windows-software called "swissknife" which is a freeware tool for partitioning in windows
2007-03-11T06:18:00.000Z	h1st0	kaktus	what are you trying to do?
2007-03-11T06:20:00.000Z	h1st0	kaktus	depends which partiion you want to format.
2007-03-11T06:20:00.000Z	kaktus	h1st0	The disk is just for backup files, no OS is to be installed on that one
2007-03-11T06:20:00.000Z	h1st0	kaktus	first create a partition.   THen format it ext2
2007-03-11T06:21:00.000Z	kaktus	h1st0	Should I create the partition as a logical or primary partition?
2007-03-11T06:24:00.000Z	kaktus	h1st0	Could I send you a screen-shot so you could see what it looks like over here?
