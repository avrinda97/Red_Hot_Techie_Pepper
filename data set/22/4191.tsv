2008-02-22T03:05:00.000Z	takatski		I'm having trouble with my sound, i tried updating to the latest version of ALSA for my RealTek driver, but the utils didnt install correctly, now i have no sound and my gstream.plugins ugly are not working
2008-02-22T03:06:00.000Z	takatski		not to mention my emerald is no longer working..
2008-02-22T03:07:00.000Z	takatski		should i just reformat and start from scratch?
2008-02-22T03:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	emerald has issues.. no you don't need to reformat and reinstall..  /join #ubuntu-effects and ask there.. you should be able to just uninstall emerald and restart X to get back to normal.
2008-02-22T03:10:00.000Z	takatski	Scunizi	its not only emerald, its also my sound card and my video card, not to mention gstream ugly plugins have stopped working :S
2008-02-22T03:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	did all that just start to happen at once..?
2008-02-22T03:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	well.. first I'd uninstall emerald and get back to the gtk default theme.. then reconfigure x using the line mentioned in the top part of /etc/xorg.conf.. after that see if it works.
2008-02-22T03:19:00.000Z	takatski	Scunizi	i uninstalled emerald, then tried a sudo gedit command on xorg.conf and it came up blank
2008-02-22T03:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	gksudo gedit /etc/xorg.conf
2008-02-22T03:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	ah.. sorry  gksudo /ext/X11/xorg.conf  I always forget the X11 part.. :(
2008-02-22T03:31:00.000Z	takatski	Scunizi	no biggie, and u mean take the sudo command thats in # in that file?
2008-02-22T03:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	hang on.. I'm looking
2008-02-22T03:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	was I typing gksudo /etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etx?  it should be etc
2008-02-22T03:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	don't forget to add gedit in there too.
2008-02-22T03:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	my bad as they say..
2008-02-22T03:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	yes
2008-02-22T03:32:00.000Z	takatski	Scunizi	its giving me a warning and it looks like its not proceding overwriting possibly-customised configuration
2008-02-22T03:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	do you have the propiatory driver loaded for your vid card?
2008-02-22T03:33:00.000Z	takatski	Scunizi	im not sure what u mean
2008-02-22T03:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	takatski	do you have the "effects" enabled for cube and rotate etc?
2008-02-22T03:34:00.000Z	takatski	Scunizi	well it was working to some degree before so i think yes, but now emerald is uninstalled so
2008-02-22T03:35:00.000Z	takatski	Scunizi	: np
