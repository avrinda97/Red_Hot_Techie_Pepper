2010-10-18T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	why don't you explain the problem you are having a little more
2010-10-18T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	ok - first of all, the version of ubuntu isn't the problem here
2010-10-18T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	what is the ip address you where using on XP
2010-10-18T02:24:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	IP in xp : 192.168.1.2
2010-10-18T02:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	do you give that IP, or does dhcp give it for you
2010-10-18T02:25:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	really I dont know, but with command ipconfig /all in xp i get : DHCP Enabled : No
2010-10-18T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	very interesting, is this a desktop or a laptop ?
2010-10-18T02:27:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	desktop and the network card is a realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet
2010-10-18T02:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	open system->administrator->hardware drivers, is your network card listed in that tool ?
2010-10-18T02:29:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	in ubuntu the list apperas empty
2010-10-18T02:29:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	in ubuntu the list appears empty
2010-10-18T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	ok, so in theory your card seemst to be nativly supported
2010-10-18T02:32:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	in 9.04 connect to internet automatically, In another machine with the same hardware I've upgraded from 9.04 to 10.04 and I dis not have problems
2010-10-18T02:35:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	in 9.04 connect to internet automatically, In another machine with the same hardware I've upgraded from 9.04 to 10.04 and I did not have problems
2010-10-18T02:47:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	This does mean something? : No DHCPOFFERS received. No working leases in persistent database - sleeping.
2010-10-18T02:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	it means your network is not serving dhcp
2010-10-18T02:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Administrador	open your network configuration tool and look at what your default gateway and dns servers are
2010-10-18T02:55:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	I'm looking in router so DHCP does not  have data, hostname:empty,IP Adress:empty, all empty....but I have a default gateway and dns server...Can I put it here, is not risk?
2010-10-18T02:58:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	But the way I ve run Xubuntu 10.10 and it cannot conect to internet like ubuntu 10.04.1
2010-10-18T02:59:00.000Z	Administrador	ikonia	By the way I ve run Xubuntu 10.10 and it cannot conect to internet like ubuntu 10.04.1
