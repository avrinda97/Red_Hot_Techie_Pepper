2010-07-04T00:27:00.000Z	mattwj2002		one second I'll have to check
2010-07-04T00:28:00.000Z	mattwj2002		the disk utility in 10.04
2010-07-04T00:28:00.000Z	mattwj2002		yeah smart status
2010-07-04T00:28:00.000Z	mattwj2002		maybe I can fix the other one using the gui?
2010-07-04T00:29:00.000Z	mattwj2002		one of my partitions I check the filesystem and it says it is not clean? what does that mean? that is using the gui? the disk utility in other words
2010-07-04T00:31:00.000Z	mattwj2002		is there an easy gui for cleaning a partition?
2010-07-04T00:31:00.000Z	mattwj2002		okay
2010-07-04T00:33:00.000Z	mattwj2002		one moment
2010-07-04T00:34:00.000Z	mattwj2002		Either the superblock or the partition table is likely to be corrupt!
2010-07-04T00:34:00.000Z	mattwj2002		:O
2010-07-04T00:35:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	D:
2010-07-04T00:35:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	backup everything, reformat and reinstall :S
2010-07-04T00:41:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	is /dev/sdc1 mounted?
2010-07-04T00:41:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	ok good phew
2010-07-04T00:42:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	windows can't mess with ext filesystems
2010-07-04T00:44:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	Bad idea :/
2010-07-04T00:45:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	converting filesystems is a VERY bad idea on linux
2010-07-04T00:46:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	they have certain restrictions on some that others don't it would be a very bad idea to do this
2010-07-04T00:47:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	oh ok phew, sorry that I got worked up
2010-07-04T00:54:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	just ask :P
2010-07-16T04:33:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	no lol
2010-07-16T04:34:00.000Z	Flare183	mattwj2002	you can't own Linux, but you can spread the word of it
