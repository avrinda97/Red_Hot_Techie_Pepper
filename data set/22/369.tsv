2011-11-12T19:25:00.000Z	wolfi_		Hi. I'm not a linux user, but installed Ubuntu to an other disk than my primary HD, to update the firmware of the primary HD. I have now the update program in a folder on my Desktop but it is green  and I'm not able to start it. what shall I do ? The file rights is:-rwxr-xr-x
2011-11-12T19:26:00.000Z	wolfi_		... also showing the content of the folder with ls shows the file green.
2011-11-12T19:27:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	Where are the instructions on how to use that file?
2011-11-12T19:27:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	And whats that filename?
2011-11-12T19:28:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	And where are the instructions on how to use that file to update the firmware?
2011-11-12T19:29:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	The filename is green because the access rights 755 are set.
2011-11-12T19:29:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	the insructions say execute 'fwupd /foo/bar'
2011-11-12T19:29:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	I want a link to read the instructions on my own, please.
2011-11-12T19:30:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	ok one minute ...

2011-11-12T19:32:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	So just run: sudo ./fwupd /dev/yourdisk
2011-11-12T19:32:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	DONT run it as long as you have no backup. Create a backup of that disk before.
2011-11-12T19:33:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	A Backup is done.
2011-11-12T19:33:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	Did you download the firmware update file itself, too? fwupd is just the executable to run the firmware update process.
2011-11-12T19:34:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	yes. This executable downloads the firmware from internet.
2011-11-12T19:35:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	So "no".
2011-11-12T19:35:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	er ...yes
2011-11-12T19:36:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	Maybe it's necessary to change some rights with 'chmod' ?? But I' don't know the syntax nor the right rights ...
2011-11-12T19:36:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	No.
2011-11-12T19:36:00.000Z	bekks	wolfi_	I already told you how to run that file.
2011-11-12T19:39:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	why is the ./ necessary ? I was in the right folder ?
2011-11-12T19:42:00.000Z	wolfi_	bekks	Thank you for your help ! :) This is for you: http://planetoddity.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/beer.jpg
