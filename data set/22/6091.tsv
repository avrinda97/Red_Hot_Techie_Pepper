2007-03-09T12:18:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 sure.  just open the CD in your repository list in Synaptic.
2007-03-09T12:19:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 and turn OFF all the actual repositories.
2007-03-09T12:19:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	okay, I'll just give it a shot. Open the CD in the rep. list in Synaptic and turn off all the real sources?
2007-03-09T12:20:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 never tried it myself.  only theory.  I don't see how it could break anything though.
2007-03-09T12:21:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	ha, okay. It's not like I have anything important on here anyway.
2007-03-09T12:21:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 it just MIGHT be a first.  :)
2007-03-09T12:23:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	you think there might be wiki page on this?
2007-03-09T12:23:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 seems like something like that ought to have been mentioned at least once on ubuntuforums.org.  Go there and do a search.  "upgrade CD only"
2007-03-09T12:26:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	yeah, I only wanna use the CD. Have a slow-ass connection.
2007-03-09T12:33:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 good to hear.  Tell us how it goes.
2007-03-09T12:34:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 you're upgrading from Dapper to Edgy?
2007-03-09T12:34:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	yes. From a fresh Dapper install to Edgy because I want Firefox 2.0 and Exaile.
2007-03-09T12:45:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	omeil_, have you considered Automatix?
2007-03-09T12:46:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 I was councelled not to use Automatix.
2007-03-09T12:47:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	I have also heard that Automatix is not ideal, but hey... it works.
2007-03-09T12:48:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 I think it was designed for Dapper, or something.  I think that Edgy may be a whole different flavor potato chip.
2007-03-09T12:49:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	I installed Beryl on Edgy with Automatix and it worked perfectly. It is by far the easiest way to install Beryl, but no recommended by the Beryl team...
2007-03-09T12:56:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	 Synaptic is really easy to use.  Just show her how to use the search command.  Simple.
2007-03-09T13:29:00.000Z	koregaonpark	billy	Flannel... upgrade completely messed up my install. Ubuntu won't boot anymore. :-(
2007-03-09T13:46:00.000Z	billy	koregaonpark	i'm sorry to hear that.  is anyone helping you?
