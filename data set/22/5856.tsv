2007-04-19T14:47:00.000Z	Orfeous	xtknight	the "card" that makes it legal for you to drive in the traffic
2007-04-19T14:48:00.000Z	Orfeous	xtknight	yes, it is built on macromedia
2007-04-19T14:48:00.000Z	xtknight	Orfeous	lol i know that
2007-04-19T14:48:00.000Z	xtknight	Orfeous	brain fart :)
2007-04-19T14:48:00.000Z	xtknight	Orfeous	sounds like you just need to configure wine better or use a better paid derivative of it.  i love vmware, personally
2007-04-19T14:49:00.000Z	Orfeous	xtknight	yes, it works good in vmware but it feels quite slow :(
2007-04-19T14:49:00.000Z	xtknight	Orfeous	did you install the vmware video drivrs?
2007-04-19T14:49:00.000Z	Orfeous	xtknight	yes, i installed everything with vmware* :D
2007-04-19T14:49:00.000Z	xtknight	Orfeous	odd it's almost 1:1 speed for me.  wine feels slower
2007-04-19T14:51:00.000Z	Orfeous	xtknight	hmm.. just tried the program.. i got ActiveX error message
2007-04-19T14:52:00.000Z	xtknight	Orfeous	well you need to regsvr32 the macromedia flash OCX
