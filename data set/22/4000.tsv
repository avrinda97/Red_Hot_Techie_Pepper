2008-04-12T02:36:00.000Z	scottyL		I'm installing Ubuntu Gutsy 7.10 Server and I'm running into a problem wiht the DHCP network autoconfiguration
2008-04-12T02:38:00.000Z	scottyL		This is a pretty dumb question... but, how can I find out if I have a DHCP network?
2008-04-12T02:38:00.000Z	scottyL		I'm pretty sure that the answer is "if you have to ask, you don't have one"
2008-04-12T02:38:00.000Z	scottyL		Or, "I'm doing this at my house, so it's likely I don't have one"
2008-04-12T02:38:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	do you have a router?
2008-04-12T02:39:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	do you have to set up ip numbers manually?
2008-04-12T02:39:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	Nope, they are automatically assigned
2008-04-12T02:39:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	well, THIS is dhcp.
2008-04-12T02:40:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	yes. but remember, there has to be a cable conection.
2008-04-12T02:41:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	Do you mean that the box must be wired to the router?
2008-04-12T02:42:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	yes
2008-04-12T02:42:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	try a cable while installing.
2008-04-12T02:43:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	10-4, thanks. It's odd that it supports a wireless connection, though, but whatever I can do
2008-04-12T02:43:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	If it doesn't work, can I continue on and just not configure the network at this time? I do want this computer to be a wireless server
2008-04-12T02:43:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	you will need the network connection for installing
2008-04-12T02:44:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	OK, then I'll wire and set it up for a wireless connection later
2008-04-12T02:44:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	Thanks, if I continue to have problems, you know I'll come back ;)
2008-04-12T02:44:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	np. be right back
2008-04-12T03:08:00.000Z	damaltor_	scottyL	does it work now?
2008-04-12T03:16:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	No, it doesn't
2008-04-12T03:17:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	I'm still trying to figure it out, but right now I'm doing some manual labor >.<
2008-04-12T03:17:00.000Z	scottyL	damaltor_	I inserted a cable and tried to connect again, yes
