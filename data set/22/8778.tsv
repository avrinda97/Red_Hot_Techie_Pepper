2005-07-18T16:42:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	you probably will have to
2005-07-18T16:42:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	just for the gecko engine
2005-07-18T16:44:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	nah? as far as I can understand it's a standalone one
2005-07-18T16:44:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	like galeon or mozilla-firefox?
2005-07-18T16:45:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	or thunderbird
2005-07-18T16:45:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	they all require mozilla, iirc
2005-07-18T16:47:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	no, I don't think so...afaik standalone means standalone
2005-07-18T16:47:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	i wonder why when i install galeon, epiphany, etc, it always installs mozilla.. .. ..
2005-07-18T16:48:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	I have both epiphany and firefox, bot not the mozilla suite
2005-07-18T16:49:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	not the suite, but you do have mozilla (i just did a apt-cache showpkg on epiphany and galeon)
2005-07-18T16:49:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	kazehakase depends on mozilla
2005-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	which date is colony-3? i tried a 22aug05 daily on my imac and it killed the whole box
2005-08-29T05:25:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	I don't really know...but i'm erasing everything anyway, so a failure is not a big issue to me
2005-08-29T05:26:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	ok. my G5 imac was rendered useless by the daily disk, but as long as yours is running
2005-08-29T05:27:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	we'll se in a couple of minutes I guess :)
2005-08-29T05:29:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	and by useless you mean, totally useless or you're still able to reinstall hoary for example?
2005-08-29T05:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	as in the cd wouldnt boot, and when i started OSX, it kernel panicked upon reaching the desktop trying to read the install cd (no way to eject it easily)
2005-08-29T05:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	and i can't get ANY linux to install on my G5 imac
2005-08-29T05:30:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	ooops
2005-08-29T05:33:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	well, I have an ibook g3, maybe i'll have better luck...colony-3 is august 17
2005-08-29T05:33:00.000Z	nalioth	Xappe	you got it goin on, then. Everything about the G3s is known to devs
2005-08-29T06:34:00.000Z	Xappe	nalioth	so far so good, it booted into gnome directly after finished install
