2010-09-19T10:40:00.000Z	wrenny		hey where can I find Network Manager icon in Ubuntu
2010-09-19T10:41:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	you mean the icon picture file or the applet program ?
2010-09-19T10:42:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	you don't know what you actually want but expect us to answer?...
2010-09-19T10:43:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	normally, the NetworkManager icon (you meant applet here)  is on the gnome panel.
2010-09-19T10:44:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	like other application's icon
2010-09-20T11:42:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	Linux itself doesn't need anti-virus
2010-09-20T11:43:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	but look at clamav  if you are looking for anti-virus to run on Linux and eliminate possible windows virus relying on your system
2010-09-20T11:50:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	there is possibility to have trojan / worm on Linux.  but i haven't know of any case of infection yet. except in experiment
2010-09-20T12:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	xchat
2010-09-20T11:53:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	that's why we have NoScript addon in firefox :)
2010-09-20T11:53:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	no. ActiveX is a Windows crap
2010-09-20T11:53:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	but i don't think firefox on Windows uses ActiveX anyway
2010-09-20T11:54:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	besides, the worst exploit to firefox or whatever application should only affect the user who run the application.
2010-09-20T11:54:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	as long as you don't run application as root,  your system wouldn't be affected
2010-09-20T11:55:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	but that doesn't imply you would be immune to trojan or worm.
2010-09-20T11:57:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	because you don't really need activex to get things done :)
2010-09-20T11:57:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	yea IE only website
2010-09-20T12:05:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	don't know. if it is not in Applications -> Internet ,  install it by going Software Centre
2010-09-20T12:05:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	or use command " apt-get install  xchat  "
2010-09-20T12:06:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	between  note that most of the software/application you use on ubuntu are not made by ubuntu itself.  ubuntu is a Linux Distribution who distribute software :)
2010-09-20T12:06:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	what ubuntu does it just pack software together, sometimes add ubuntu stuff
2010-09-20T12:07:00.000Z	icarus-c	wrenny	like GNOME community who make GNOME,  Mozilla who make Firefox, GNU who makes a lot of system utilities...etc
