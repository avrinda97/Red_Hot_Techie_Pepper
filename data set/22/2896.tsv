2009-02-01T07:25:00.000Z	doc^		i have a Q
2009-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	doc^		im trying to run a microsoft GPS on my ubuntu laptop
2009-02-01T07:26:00.000Z	doc^		so, i did a search on the topic, and someone on some board suggested i download a aps called gpsbabel
2009-02-01T07:27:00.000Z	doc^		i donwloaded the thing via synaptic
2009-02-01T07:27:00.000Z	doc^		but cant find from where to run the program
2009-02-01T07:27:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	try going to the terminal, typing gps and then tabbing
2009-02-01T07:29:00.000Z	doc^	leo_rockway	: alright, what next ?
2009-02-01T07:30:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	I'm guessing the command starts with "gps" if you tab it will show you the name of the command
2009-02-01T07:32:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	if you go to a terminal and start typing a command and then hit the tab key it will try to autocomplete the command
2009-02-01T07:32:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	the right command is probably gpsbabel
2009-02-01T07:32:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	just run that command
2009-02-01T07:35:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	that tells you how the program works. It's probably a terminal program, that's why you didn't get a menu entry
2009-02-01T07:35:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	because the developers like it that way :)
2009-02-01T07:36:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	it's usually better to write terminal apps so then different front ends can be written
2009-02-01T07:37:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	what do you want to learn?
2009-02-01T07:38:00.000Z	doc^	leo_rockway	: i dont realy know
2009-02-01T07:39:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	all terminal
2009-02-01T07:39:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	you can try looking for a basic command line manual
2009-02-01T07:40:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	the command line is very useful and it's usually faster than the graphical counter part once you learn how to use it
2009-02-01T07:41:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	it's not as hard as people tend to believe
2009-02-01T07:43:00.000Z	leo_rockway	doc^	ok, have fun :)
