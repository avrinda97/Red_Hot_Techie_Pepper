2009-07-05T07:29:00.000Z	kryl		I have a problem with my netbook under ubuntu. I detect wifi network, I can connect to unsafe network but when I connect to my own network with the good ascii key (wpa) it doesn't work (it's ok under windows) !
2009-07-05T07:29:00.000Z	kryl		is there a problem with hex or ascii syntax ?
2009-07-05T07:30:00.000Z	pelmen	kryl	probably your wireless card driver was not compiled with wpa supplicant
