2006-08-11T06:50:00.000Z	eric__		I was hoping somebody could help this newbie compile a tarball.
2006-08-11T06:50:00.000Z	eric__		I have the source code for the latest version of gnucash.
2006-08-11T06:51:00.000Z	eric__		I downloaded it and extracted all of the files onto my desktop (why not?).
2006-08-11T06:51:00.000Z	eric__		I do ./configure and I get "configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables"
2006-08-11T06:52:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	did you install build esentials?
2006-08-11T06:55:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	look like it you will need to install that perl module first.
2006-08-11T06:56:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	 Thought I did.  Lemme look.
2006-08-11T06:57:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	According to Synaptic, I have the latest version of perl installed (5.8.7-10ubuntu1), as well as perl-base.  There are some other perl things I could install, like -byacc, debug, doc.
2006-08-11T06:58:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	you might have to install the module manually I don't know much about perl modules to tell if it is in a package.
2006-08-11T06:59:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	I hope you are wrong.  I'll let you know in a minute.
2006-08-11T07:08:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	did you try just "./configure"
2006-08-11T07:09:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	BRILLIANT! ./configure was the way to go.
2006-08-11T07:09:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	now for MAKE.
2006-08-11T07:09:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	good :)
2006-08-11T07:11:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	I have to admit, I'm feeling pretty dim right now.  Make has no make targets.  Do I just say 'make'?
2006-08-11T07:12:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	generally, is there a README file?
2006-08-11T07:12:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	Yes, but it's not helping.
2006-08-11T07:13:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	by not making any targets what did it say.
2006-08-11T07:13:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	Aaah.. Should have read better.  Readme says it uses GNU Automake .. ?\
2006-08-11T07:14:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	what do you get with "make --version"
2006-08-11T07:15:00.000Z	eric__	nrdb	GNU Make 3.81beta4
2006-08-11T07:16:00.000Z	nrdb	eric__	good,  what was the command you used ?
