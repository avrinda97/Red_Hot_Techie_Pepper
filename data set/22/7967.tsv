2006-02-26T16:31:00.000Z	DigitalLF		hello im trying to make a dualboot and the question is should the linux partition have "bootable flag"?
2006-02-26T16:31:00.000Z	DigitalLF		im using https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsDualBootHowTo
2006-02-26T16:33:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	Nope.  Neither of the 2 linux partitions that i boot from are flagged bootable :)
2006-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	DigitalLF	bimberi	anything else i should think of? (n00b when it comes to my laptop inspiron 9400)
2006-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	DigitalLF	bimberi	i hade to use vga=771 when i booted thats all i think so far.. :P
2006-02-26T16:35:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	not that i can think of
2006-02-26T16:35:00.000Z	DigitalLF	bimberi	thank you very much
2006-02-26T16:35:00.000Z	DigitalLF		bbl
2006-02-26T16:35:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	yw :)
2006-02-26T16:36:00.000Z	DigitalLF	bimberi	hehe one more thing.... primary or logical for the swap partition?
2006-02-26T16:36:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	doesn't matter (but mine is logical)
2006-02-26T16:37:00.000Z	DigitalLF	bimberi	okey thank you again
2006-02-26T16:38:00.000Z	DigitalLF		when im already here... how big should a swap partition be if i got 1024mb ddr2 533
2006-02-26T16:39:00.000Z	DigitalLF		anyone? swap how big when 1024mb ddr2
2006-02-26T16:40:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	I reckon 1GB - rule of thumb is 2xRAM up to a maximum of 1GB
2006-02-26T16:40:00.000Z	DigitalLF		will the swap make a big difference?
2006-02-26T16:40:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	 some even say max out at 512MB
2006-02-26T16:41:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	btw it's not a 'final' decision - you can create a file on the filesystem to use as swap anyway
2006-02-26T16:45:00.000Z	bimberi		gee you'd think there'd be a factoid for launchpad
2006-02-26T16:47:00.000Z	bimberi		!launchpad is a collection of services for projects in the open source universe - https://launchpad.net/
2006-02-26T17:30:00.000Z	DigitalLF		install complete.. how do i "su -"
2006-02-26T17:30:00.000Z	bimberi	DigitalLF	sudo -i
