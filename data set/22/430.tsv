2011-11-28T05:49:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	drag to side, right?
2011-11-28T05:53:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	pretty sure they'll have that in Xfce coming to theaters near you
2011-11-28T05:53:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	window snapping stuff
2011-11-28T05:54:00.000Z	scorinitron	reisio	lol cool XD
2011-11-28T05:54:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	meanwhile if you don't rely on anything Xfwm specific, you could use compiz I think as whatshisname suggested
2011-11-28T05:58:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	probably compiz --replace, and then log out and see if the session saves it
2011-11-28T05:59:00.000Z	scorinitron	reisio	so enter  compiz --replace in the terminal?
2011-11-28T05:59:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	ALT+F2 would be a little kinder
2011-11-28T06:00:00.000Z	scorinitron	reisio	lol nothing happened?
2011-11-28T06:00:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	pgrep -l xfwm; pgrep -l compiz
2011-11-28T06:02:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	did you actually install compiz yet?
2011-11-28T06:02:00.000Z	scorinitron	reisio	Processing triggers for libc-bin ...
2011-11-28T06:05:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	it what
2011-11-28T06:07:00.000Z	scorinitron	reisio	srry let me rephrase that...I think compiz finished installing. In the terminal Window the last line that shows up is this [ldconfig deferred processing now taking place] I think all I need to do is restart...
2011-11-28T06:08:00.000Z	scorinitron	reisio	I was wondering if their's some kind of manager for compiz so I can change/add themes
2011-11-28T06:09:00.000Z	reisio	scorinitron	yes there is, search with your package manager
