2011-10-10T15:45:00.000Z	plain-user		i'm confused with my sound cards. :) managed to get skype in working, but out from usb card. now after playing just with sound preferences i got out in the headphones but input is not there at all!
2011-10-10T15:47:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	run gstreamer-properties in the terminal, to seup your USB card and after changing your settings , you may need to restart.
2011-10-10T15:49:00.000Z	plain-user	BluesKaj	how can i tell skype to use one card and everything else use the other?
2011-10-10T15:53:00.000Z	plain-user		if I understand correctly, I can have two sound servers running, one for each card, and point in particular application (in this instance skype) what s.server i want to use.
2011-10-10T15:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	you can only have one default soundcard afaik , you have to set it in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf as : options snd_nameofmodule index=0 ..you can find the module name you want to use by running:  lsmod | grep snd
2011-10-10T15:58:00.000Z	plain-user		it has a lot of modules there. is there a quicker way to select default device and preferrably "on the fly". it's ok if i have to make some steps to quickly change the sound in order to answer the skype call, but if it brakes everything else (example something is processing on the background)
2011-10-10T15:59:00.000Z	plain-user		then =\
2011-10-10T16:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	there's no reason your USB card can't run all the sound as default if that's what you want , switching back and forth between cards is odious and unecessary.
2011-10-10T16:04:00.000Z	plain-user	BluesKaj	i need the inbuilt soundcard be working in skype. reason: headset with microphone is connected to it. i got bored of using line mike and holding it in hand like a singer everytime i need to use skype
2011-10-10T16:04:00.000Z	plain-user		lol
2011-10-10T16:04:00.000Z	plain-user		before i had the extrenal usb card doing the sound for skype, but had to use the studio mike. ))
2011-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	then use the commands I posted earlier to set it as defualt , which it probly is already , unless you changed it in the bios.
2011-10-10T16:06:00.000Z	plain-user	BluesKaj	ok.. in bios you can't set the usb card it doesnt see it
2011-10-10T16:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	what are soundcard options in the bios .pci , other , enable / disable , auto ?
2011-10-10T16:09:00.000Z	plain-user	BluesKaj	the bios options are only turn on and off the internal audio. which i set to enable, because i want to use it. i don't think it is relevant,
2011-10-10T16:11:00.000Z	plain-user		just using the sound preferences dialog i can set the audio temporarily default for internal and then use skype. is there a permanent way of doing so?
2011-10-10T16:16:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	yes it is relavent to the default sound card , set in alsa.conf as I said earlier ...I discovered that in my research trying to setup my new m-audio card in the last 2 weeks
2011-10-10T16:17:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	default soundcard is Card 0 in your sound settings
2011-10-10T16:33:00.000Z	plain-user	BluesKaj	i don't have sound 0. they come by names in the properties.
2011-10-10T16:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	as I said earlier you have to set it in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf as : options snd_nameofmodule index=0
2011-10-10T16:40:00.000Z	plain-user	BluesKaj	found that line. it is -2 currently. so what it will give me if i set it to two? just make the <soundcard> being the default? how can i then change in the application...
2011-10-10T16:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	plain-user	the -2 means it's to be ignored , set it to 0 , without the -
