2012-10-30T14:27:00.000Z	tobias_		so is virtual box supposed to stop u from using ur mouse?
2012-10-30T14:27:00.000Z	tobias_		and keys.
2012-10-30T14:27:00.000Z	tobias_		im not really understanding what it is... i mean i run it and its just unabling me to use my mouse and keys.
2012-10-30T14:28:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	no it's not. but it needs drivers to make the mouse works seemlessly between host and guest OS
2012-10-30T14:29:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	what guest OS do you want to run?
2012-10-30T14:30:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	do you have a windows CD?
2012-10-30T14:30:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	then you can't. go and buy one
2012-10-30T14:31:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	then learn how to use rhythmbox or gtkpod
2012-10-30T14:33:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	thinking is NOT optional.
2012-10-30T14:46:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	wherever you want. I'd put it in a directory under your home directory
2012-10-30T14:47:00.000Z	tobias_	wols	so what does mounting mean?
2012-10-30T14:47:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	NO
2012-10-30T14:47:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	not your home directory but a subdirectory you will create now of it
2012-10-30T14:48:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	all your ipod/iphone files will be in that directory. like when you put in a usb stick, you also mount it somewhere in your filesystem. this is the same
2012-10-30T14:49:00.000Z	wols	tobias_	no. SUBFOLDER to your desktop
