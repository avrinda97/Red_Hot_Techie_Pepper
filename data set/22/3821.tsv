2008-08-18T01:44:00.000Z	perillux		would anyone please be able to assist me with getting Suspend/Hibernate working on my laptop.  I haven't been able to do it since the day I installed Ubuntu.
2008-08-18T01:45:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	did you install using windows?
2008-08-18T01:45:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	what do you mean?
2008-08-18T01:46:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	is ubuntu the only installation you have on your computer? or is it a dual boot. if so, how did you install it?
2008-08-18T01:46:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	I had windows XP at first, and then I completely erased it and now I only have Ubuntu
2008-08-18T01:46:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	yes
2008-08-18T01:46:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	ubuntu only
2008-08-18T01:46:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	what happens when you try to suspend and hibernate?
2008-08-18T01:47:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	have you tried using USWSUSP?
2008-08-18T01:47:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	either it goes to a black screen and I see nothing and it just stays there.  OR it appears to work, the screen turns off and fans stop moving ect.. but when I resume then it stays at the black screen again
2008-08-18T01:48:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	also, pressing ctrl+alt+backspace does nothing.  I have to do a hard reboot.
2008-08-18T01:48:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	I have tried uswsusp, but I got an error when it finished installing and ran the setup... or whatever it's called
2008-08-18T01:50:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	i'm out of ideas
2008-08-18T01:50:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	thanks for you help
2008-08-18T01:50:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	i had the same problem... i had to fix it by a fresh install
2008-08-18T01:51:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	hope you don't have to go that far
2008-08-18T01:51:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	the error said something about not having a valid swap, somthin like that
2008-08-18T01:51:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	do you have a swap disk?
2008-08-18T01:51:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	ya, that's what's so weird
2008-08-18T01:51:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	it's not a separate disk, but it's on a separate partition.
2008-08-18T01:53:00.000Z	cwill747	perillux	yeah i gotcha. strange...
2008-08-18T01:54:00.000Z	perillux	cwill747	ok here's the exact error: "The swap file or partition that was found in uswsusp's configuration file is not active. In most cases this means userspace software suspend will not work for you and you will need to choose (or let uswsusp choose) another swap space. In some corner cases however, this can be what you want.  Continue without a valid swap space?"
