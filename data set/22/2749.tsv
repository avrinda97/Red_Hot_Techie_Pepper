2009-03-27T11:00:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	TheDeepFriedBoot: isn't flv just a container format just like avi? it can use any number of weird codecs.. there's no way of knowing if you can play a file just by looking at the filetype
2009-03-27T11:01:00.000Z	Kimi	Slart	?!
2009-03-27T11:13:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	have you asked your friend what software he used to create those files?
2009-03-27T11:13:00.000Z	Kimi	Slart	thats really his challenge :'(
2009-03-28T13:37:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	Brasero does multisession on my desktop
2009-03-28T13:37:00.000Z	Kimi	Slart	then help me ;)
2009-03-28T13:38:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	press the burn button, then click properties, check "Leave disc open to add other files later"
2009-03-28T13:39:00.000Z	Kimi	Slart	ok.. as i am just 1 month :P old to ubuntu (and linux) i dont know all these/// as in NERO of xp, its a option shown in first there
2009-03-28T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	I don't think there is one that does exactly the same thing.. what are you looking for?
2009-03-28T13:44:00.000Z	Kimi	Slart	crdlb task manager
2009-03-28T13:46:00.000Z	Kimi	Slart	how you did that ?? i mean that learned a new thing "
2009-03-28T13:46:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	I'll tell you if you promise not to try it here in this channel
2009-03-28T13:47:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	/me learned a new thing... it replaces  /me with your nickname.. it's called an ACTION I think
2009-03-28T13:47:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	dont abuse it.. once a month or so is the allowed quota =)
2009-03-28T13:49:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	I don't think it does that automatically when you install gwget.. afaik gwget is a stand alone downloader
2009-03-28T14:19:00.000Z	Slart	Kimi	also www.osalt.com has a nice list of software
2009-03-28T14:20:00.000Z	Kimi	Slart	ubottu, bazhang Thanks very muc
