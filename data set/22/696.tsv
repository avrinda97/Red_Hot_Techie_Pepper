2011-05-05T08:23:00.000Z	awesomestman		I already have Ubuntu 11.04 installed and apparently I'm supposed to partition my hard drive because the original partition wasn't large enough
2011-05-05T08:24:00.000Z	awesomestman		I just want to make sure I go and shrink my windows partition without messing anything up
2011-05-05T08:24:00.000Z	giacomo_c	awesomestman	make sure you defrag first
2011-05-05T08:25:00.000Z	giacomo_c		maybe do that  a few times
2011-05-05T08:25:00.000Z	awesomestman		all right. so I'll defrag and then reinstall?
2011-05-05T08:25:00.000Z	giacomo_c		reinstall windows awesomestman ?
2011-05-05T08:26:00.000Z	giacomo_c		or are you wanting to dual boot and install ubuntu?
2011-05-05T08:26:00.000Z	awesomestman		reinstall 11.04.
2011-05-05T08:26:00.000Z	giacomo_c		and your partitions are already setup awesomestman ?
2011-05-05T08:28:00.000Z	awesomestman	giacomo_c	i think my partitions are set up. I was able to dual boot yesterday. I have been having issues with software center so I was told to downgrade to 10.04 last night. I didn't know if just reinstalling 11.04 would change anything
2011-05-05T08:28:00.000Z	awesomestman		I thought it would so I wanted to go with it but when I tried to boot the install from my USB I was told that Ubuntu's partition was too small.
2011-05-05T08:29:00.000Z	giacomo_c		as long as your partitions are already setup awesomestman, you can just go ahead and reinstall, just make sure you don't choose the option to use the whole drive, make sure its just reinstalling on your ubuntu partition (ext4 or whatever)
2011-05-05T08:30:00.000Z	giacomo_c	awesomestman	you want to have at least 5g for your root partition
2011-05-05T08:30:00.000Z	awesomestman	giacomo_c	should I reformat my hard disc beforehand or should I just go with it?
2011-05-05T08:30:00.000Z	giacomo_c		wait, you have windows installed too, yes?
2011-05-05T08:31:00.000Z	awesomestman		My laptop's off right now and my USB's out
2011-05-05T08:31:00.000Z	awesomestman		I don't know if my first step is to boot from Windows, 11.04, or from the live USB
2011-05-05T08:31:00.000Z	giacomo_c		like your boot order awesomestman ?
2011-05-05T08:32:00.000Z	awesomestman	giacomo_c	huh?
2011-05-05T08:32:00.000Z	giacomo_c		heh
2011-05-05T08:33:00.000Z	awesomestman	giacomo_c	I was confused by what you just told me
2011-05-05T08:34:00.000Z	awesomestman	giacomo_c	so should I just boot from my USB and reinstall 11.04?
