2008-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	we'll need more info
2008-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	error messages, symptoms...?
2008-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	Is the CD Rom light flashing?
2008-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	Are you trying to install or test?  If install, get the Alternate CD
2008-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	Download the Alternate CD 7.10 i386
2008-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	It's faster to install with less hassle anyway :)
2008-04-20T09:22:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	command window?
2008-04-20T09:22:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	it should give you a login screen
2008-04-20T09:23:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	enter the username and password you set when you installed
2008-04-20T09:24:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	does it have an orange screen with a box for user and password?
2008-04-20T09:24:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	or is it a black and white command prompt looking screen
2008-04-20T09:27:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	what video card are you using?
2008-04-20T09:29:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	why server edition?
2008-04-20T09:29:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	if you're new to linux, might want to give the non server edition a try first :)
2008-04-20T09:30:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	I did that my first time, thinking it would be like Windows NT/2k ;)
2008-04-20T09:31:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	the website :)
2008-04-20T09:31:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	There's a checkbox for alternate CD's
2008-04-20T09:50:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	No need, unless you want to, it will dual boot fine
2008-04-20T09:51:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	If you install windows later, you'll need to repair grub before you can use linux again, windows breaks it.
2008-04-20T09:51:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	Not a big hassle, just annoying
2008-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	NateF	Ok, then wipe the drive, make a / partiton, a /home, and a swap
