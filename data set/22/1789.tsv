2010-01-06T10:08:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	IMO, larger ram support is the single biggest difference with 32 vs 64 bit versions....
2010-03-05T04:56:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	look on newegg for something the reviewers say runs well with ubuntu
2010-03-05T04:57:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	they don't have newegg in my corner of the world.
2010-03-05T04:57:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	you can't access www.newegg.com ?
2010-03-05T04:58:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	I can access it, but they don't have a brick and mortar presence nearby.
2010-03-05T04:59:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	Uh, use it to compile a list of recommendations, and then shop locally....
2010-03-05T05:01:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	I'm opening up a browser to newegg as we speak.
2010-03-05T05:02:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	also the same trick will work with ebay: search for ubuntu motherboard etc....
2010-03-05T05:08:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	is newegg a mail order only shop?  The locations page only lists one site in California.
2010-03-05T05:08:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	yes, newegg is mail order only....
2010-03-05T05:09:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	Ah.  Okay.   That might be one reason I've never seen one of their stores.  I thought it was a US only thing.
2010-03-05T05:10:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	where are you?
2010-03-05T05:11:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	Toronto, Ontario Canada.  (Well technically, Scarborough).
2010-03-05T05:13:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	slickdeals has a 'build your own' forum where you can fill out a form and ask for recommendations: http://slickdeals.net/forums/showthread.php?sduid=136927&t=553826
2010-03-05T05:14:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	that sounds interesting.  I'll take a look at that.
2010-03-05T05:16:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	also, consider buying off-the-shelf locally (make sure there's a good return policy)....
2010-03-05T05:18:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	see the questionnaire on the slickdeals thread? It's there for a reason....
2010-03-05T05:21:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	I've only skimmed through the site at this point.
2010-04-12T09:03:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	unetbootin is supposed to support doing a cd-less install http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2010-04-12T09:04:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	sadly, the machine in question cannot boot from usb.
2010-04-12T09:05:00.000Z	Losha	dsnyders	keep reading: "it can make a "frugal install" on your local hard disk if you don't have a USB drive"
2010-04-12T09:06:00.000Z	dsnyders	Losha	Hadn't gotten to that part yet.  I just did a quick scan.  Thanks for the link, BTW.
