2008-06-18T16:00:00.000Z	JFlash		?
2008-06-18T16:00:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	No - Beryl is long dead. Compiz Fusion replaces it, and comes with Ubuntu 8.04 "Hardy Heron"
2008-06-18T16:01:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	That's the point.
2008-06-18T16:01:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Compiz Fusion is rather better than Beryl ever was.
2008-06-18T16:01:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Install Ubuntu 8.04 - if you have a compatible video card, it should be enabled.
2008-06-18T16:04:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	What was that to?
2008-06-18T16:04:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Your comment about running Hardy Heron.
2008-06-18T16:05:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	That's not 3D by default.
2008-06-18T16:05:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Do you have shadows behind your windows?
2008-06-18T16:05:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	OK, then open up Application->Add/Remove, and install CompizConfig Settings Manager.
2008-06-18T16:06:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	That will allow you to configure Compiz for as much bling as you could possibly imagine, plus more.
2008-06-18T16:08:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	No.
2008-06-18T16:08:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	It is.
2008-06-18T16:16:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	You need to also enable "Rotate Cube".
2008-06-18T16:17:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Ah, it's just a flat plane?
2008-06-18T16:17:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Adjust the desktop size in the general options.
2008-06-18T16:20:00.000Z	JFlash	wgrant	it wont let me  slide up to more than 1 desktop
2008-06-18T16:20:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Horizontal virtual size.
2008-06-18T16:22:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	You did.
2008-06-18T16:23:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Not at all.
2008-06-18T16:23:00.000Z	wgrant	JFlash	Did your screen go black?
