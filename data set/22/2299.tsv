2010-07-05T01:11:00.000Z	aeiou		i'd like to be able to copy paste from the terminal without having to right click, is this possible?
2010-07-05T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	use ctrl+c
2010-07-05T01:12:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	ctrl+c cancels current operation, it doesnt copy
2010-07-05T01:14:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	thanks!
2010-07-05T01:15:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	you dont happen to know how to clear the terminal (i.e not typing clear, but actually clear the console with keyboard  shortcut)
2011-01-21T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	then run:  ps -ef | grep mysql
2011-01-21T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	you can then kil the pid, or you can run:  sudo service mysql stop
2011-07-07T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	flock is dead dude
2011-07-07T02:16:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	what are the alternatives?
2011-07-07T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	!browser | aeiou
2011-07-07T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	seems ubottu is sleeping
2011-07-07T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsers
2011-07-07T02:18:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	nonono not the browser
2011-07-07T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	without installing the browser you won't have the binary, so there is no 'alternative' that simple
2011-07-07T02:19:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	omg
2011-07-07T02:20:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	im asking for the source code for /sbin/flock - the FILELOCK program
2011-07-07T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	ok, what is flock then if it's not the browser
2011-07-07T02:20:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	man flock
2011-07-07T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	ahhh, i see
2011-07-07T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	i've got /usr/bin/flock
2011-07-07T02:22:00.000Z	aeiou	ActionParsnip	yes - but osx 10.6 doesnt have it
2011-07-07T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aeiou	why would that be a concern in this channel?
