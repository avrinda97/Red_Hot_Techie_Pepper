2011-05-05T23:17:00.000Z	edbian	mehdi	You have a BCM4321  this is partially supported in kernel 2.6.39 and up.  What kernel are you running (sudo uname -a)
2011-05-05T23:18:00.000Z	edbian	mehdi	I knew it was supported in 2.6.39 because of this:  http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43
2011-05-05T23:19:00.000Z	edbian	mehdi	We can try to get it to work on your kernel even though this site says it's too old. Do you want to do that?
2011-05-05T23:19:00.000Z	edbian	mehdi	?

2011-05-05T23:21:00.000Z	edbian	mehdi	What is that?
2011-05-06T01:58:00.000Z	edbian	mehdi	What's the problem?
2011-05-06T01:59:00.000Z	edbian	mehdi	Do all of this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting
