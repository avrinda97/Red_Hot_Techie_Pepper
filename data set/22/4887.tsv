2007-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	very helpfil, but like i said. it works fine with a "normal" windows installation, so i though it might ba a vbox-related issue.
2007-10-09T06:32:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	oh, sry, never mind. this is in fact the wrong channel, should've gone to #vbox.
2007-10-12T07:12:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	explain include into session-management?
2007-10-12T07:14:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	other apps i had open when i shut down ubuntu are being started automagically when i restart, firefox and thunderbird are not. i might simply autostart them, but i wonder why "session-management" excludes them.
2007-10-12T07:14:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	System -> Preferences -> Sessions and click add
2007-10-12T07:14:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	add one entry for Firefox and another for thunderbird
2007-10-12T07:15:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	stupid me. thanks.
2007-10-12T07:15:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	welcome :)
2007-10-12T07:17:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	one thing, though, with this dialog i autostart them.  other apps beeing "restored" on relog aren't listed there (e.g. virtualbox, pidgin, terminal..). where is teh difference?
2007-10-12T07:18:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	well those are saved in your session, click at the Session Options tab
2007-10-12T07:18:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	there is a checkbox, if you check it, it will remember things when you logout, (I don't recommend!, if you have a bad application that hangs gnome, it will do that everytime you login!)
2007-10-12T07:19:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	which brings me back to my original question: why is ff and thunderbird excluded from the "autmatically remember.." function?
2007-10-12T07:20:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	is that checkbox checked?
2007-10-12T07:20:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	 yes, it is by default.
2007-10-12T07:21:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	hm, I don't know why specifically firefox and thunderbird are not save as part of the session, can't seem to find any bug report as well
2007-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	as a work around you can add firefox and thunderbird if you want, I will check it out on my system in a while
2007-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	same here. strange enough.
2007-10-12T07:23:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	well, autostarting is no problem, just wanted to know if there'S any reason for the behaviour shown.
2007-10-12T07:24:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	I will look into it, first thing that comes to my mind is the way firefox and thunderbird manage their session (using profiles and not allowing multiple firefox/thunderbird instances) might be the issue
2007-10-12T07:25:00.000Z	chimaera	heguru	i thought about that as well. anway, thanks.
2007-10-12T07:25:00.000Z	heguru	chimaera	welcome :)
