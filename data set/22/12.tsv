2004-11-13T16:23:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	alsaconf was removed because it doesn't do the right things in ubuntu
2004-11-13T16:24:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	with `alsamixer` i get: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device, it's  onboard intel i810 chipset on laptop
2004-11-13T16:24:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	/dev/dsp doesn't exist either
2004-11-13T16:25:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	sounds like the modules aren't loaded, or were loaded in incorrect order
2004-11-13T16:31:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	if they don't exist, the driver isn't loaded
2004-11-13T16:31:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	look in /dev/snd/ -> what's there?
2004-11-13T16:32:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	controlC0  timer is all that is there
2004-11-13T16:32:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	you have any usb audio devices attached?
2004-11-13T16:33:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	i did have a usb mouse attached when i installed as well as ethernet hooked up and pcmcia wifi card
2004-11-13T16:33:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	only having those devices there indicates that you haven't loaded all the modules you need
2004-11-13T16:34:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	they *should* be autodetected
2004-11-15T14:04:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	~/.gnome2/totem_config
2004-11-15T14:05:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	dang xine/alsa troubles :D
2005-01-01T17:24:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	you don't happen to have a toshiba, do you?
2005-01-01T17:26:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	no dell inspiron 1.8ghz cpu/512ram/gf2go and it's pretty slow for some reason, refreshing windows and the like
2005-01-01T17:35:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	any idea why it might be slow?
2005-01-01T17:35:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	this is ubuntu unstable, current.
2005-01-01T17:36:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	no strong ideas, no
2005-01-01T17:37:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	could be 'nvidia' drivers or whatever agp i'm using you think?
2005-01-01T17:37:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	dunno
2005-01-28T06:40:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_	no, dbus would not cause hardware bus latency, they're entirely unrelated.
2005-01-28T06:42:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub	ok thanks
