2009-01-23T09:19:00.000Z	joanki123		and you can cut them off whenever you want?
2009-01-23T09:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	sure, ssh; you can kill the process for their access, using ps -AF
2009-01-23T09:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	for example: ps -AF | grep <username> will return the process # for their tty
2009-01-23T09:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	kill that process, and they are disconnected
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	joanki123		thank you rdw200169
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	then again, they can just log in again
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	joanki123		rdw so how do i stop them then?
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	joanki123	rdw200169	you mean they can continue to access my machine over and over again with my information?
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	joanki123		even if i am not here at my computer?
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	what do you mean?
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	joanki123		if i let someone ssh,
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	joanki123		can they login when i'm not here?
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	joanki123		or do i need to give them access and they can't do it again if i dont?
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	joanki123		k
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	OHH, ok, well, you can set up a quick account, then add that user to the group 'admin'
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	joanki123		is there another way i can let someone see my screen then?
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	joanki123		without havig to give them access via my wireless router, which i don't have the pasword to?
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	then they get sudo access, and ssh access, from a different user/pass
2009-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	what exactly are you trying to do?
2009-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	joanki123		give someone access so he can fix something
2009-01-23T09:24:00.000Z	rdw200169	joanki123	what are you trying to fix?
