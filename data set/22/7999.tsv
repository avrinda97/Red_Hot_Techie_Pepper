2006-09-27T10:02:00.000Z	hav0k		can anyone help me with NetworkManagerApplet?
2006-09-27T10:03:00.000Z	hav0k		Network manager applet wont show wireless stuff, it only has wired connection
2006-09-27T10:04:00.000Z	IcemanV9	hav0k	right-click on the icon .. it should show two check boxes (wired AND wireless)
2006-09-27T10:04:00.000Z	hav0k	IcemanV9	yeah, it should, but only wired is there
2006-09-27T10:06:00.000Z	IcemanV9	hav0k	it happened to me last week. i went CRAZY trying to figure it out and no answer from forums for a few days. then, all of sudden, it came back on its own. WEIRD.
2006-09-27T10:06:00.000Z	hav0k		well, it's never been there
2006-09-27T10:06:00.000Z	hav0k		not since i installed it
2006-09-27T10:07:00.000Z	IcemanV9	hav0k	try to go wireless first before you turn the box on?
2006-09-27T10:08:00.000Z	hav0k		alright, ill try that... ill be back in a sec

2006-09-27T10:11:00.000Z	IcemanV9		cli is always the BEST to install stuff
2006-09-27T10:12:00.000Z	hav0k	IcemanV9	it didnt work... it only had wired
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	hav0k		is there any way to edit it... and add in the eth1
2006-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	IcemanV9	hav0k	i don't know. it's all i know. i haven't figure it out on adding eth1 to it. at least, mine got it back for now.
2006-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	hav0k		alright... well ill try to uninstall it, and reinstall... maybe it will pick it up... do you know if it's in the apt IcemanV9
2006-09-27T10:15:00.000Z	IcemanV9	hav0k	i know there is a newer version out there, but it is not in the backport.
2006-09-27T10:15:00.000Z	hav0k		i dont remember how i installed it
