2007-12-23T04:37:00.000Z	TheEagle		can you install Flash on ubuntu (not the plugin, the program)
2007-12-23T04:38:00.000Z	TheEagle		is it free
2007-12-23T04:39:00.000Z	TheEagle		where can I get it?
2007-12-23T04:39:00.000Z	TheEagle		cheers plux
2007-12-23T04:40:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	Flash does work in wine, I've run it myself. The best way to get it running is to go to System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager and search for 'wine'
2007-12-23T04:41:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	If you want the latest and greatest version (though the Synaptic version should be good enough), copy and paste the two lines from http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb
2007-12-23T04:42:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	To install Ming, just go to Synaptics and search for ming
2007-12-23T04:43:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	If Wine doesn't work for you, you can try Virtualbox and run Windows from _inside_ Ubuntu.
2007-12-23T04:44:00.000Z	TheEagle	Malachi	you say run windows from "inside" ubuntu - can I use the version of xp on my other hard disk?
2007-12-23T04:44:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	Yes, if both HDs are on the same PC.
2007-12-23T04:44:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	You can allocate the memory you want for it.
2007-12-23T04:45:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	Actually, I don't know if Virtualbox will allow this, but VMWare, a commercial virtualization, will.
2007-12-23T04:45:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	If you have 256, you'll have a tough time running it.
2007-12-23T04:45:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	It's possible, but 128 for Ubuntu and 128 for Windows is stretching it.
2007-12-23T04:46:00.000Z	TheEagle	Malachi	ok thanks, ill try later
2007-12-23T04:50:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	Really, we can't address this question.
2007-12-23T04:53:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	Being a novice is okay, but we have strict guidelines about conversations about malicious practices. I don't even advise it in offtopic.
2007-12-23T05:10:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	In summary, no one can tell you where to start. Make your choice and go.
2007-12-23T05:11:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	And by go I meant dive in and don't give up.
2007-12-23T05:23:00.000Z	Malachi	TheEagle	You'll have to register, then.
2007-12-23T05:23:00.000Z	TheEagle	Malachi	and how do i do that
