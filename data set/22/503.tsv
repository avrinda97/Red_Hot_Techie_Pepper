2011-08-17T02:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	you can use youtube with html5, also gnash works pretty well (for me) with YouTube
2011-08-17T02:03:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	will i need any additional fiddling with software for the use of html5 on youtube?
2011-08-17T02:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	no, just a modern browser then go to http://www.youtube.com/html5
2011-08-17T02:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	not everything is html5 yet :(  thus, gnash can pickup the rest :)
2011-08-17T02:05:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	i use ff 3.6.18 (i am on ubunut 10.04) do you know at chance if chromium is modern enough?
2011-08-17T02:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	chromium-browser should work yes
2011-08-17T02:07:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	ok, will go for that one :)
2011-08-17T02:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	i'm affraid FSF doesn't consider chromium "free" however
2011-08-17T02:08:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	hm, so it's opensource but not free?
2011-08-17T02:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	ya, PARTS of it are questionable i guess?  Debian considers it free.
2011-08-17T02:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	honestly though, if you are concerned about software freedom, Ubuntu isn't the right distro to be using.
2011-08-17T02:11:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	i know... but i try to do it within my capabilites... and in that case ubunut is fair enough for me
2011-08-17T02:12:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	so i an willing to choose a opensource or even free software over a prop. one, but i am a user too. so usually if a problem occurs i try to solve it for two days or so, then see if i could adjust and as last resort fall back to prop.
2011-08-17T02:20:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	i looked at the youtube html5 link ... i had to click the button "join html5 test" ... how do they identify me? i hope not my ip, becuase this would affect my flate mates too...
2011-08-17T02:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	i'm sure it's a cookie
2011-08-17T02:22:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	hm... i use chromium, but it prompts me to download flash, even after i opted in for html5 :(
2011-08-17T02:23:00.000Z	sojasauce	zykotick9	just cheked... its by cookie
2011-08-17T02:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	sojasauce	try a different video (as i said not everything is html5 yet), adding gnash with html5 will probably give you better results, then it will use html5 when it can, and gnash when it can't
