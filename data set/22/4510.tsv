2007-12-19T18:18:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	not sure what other specs you need
2007-12-19T18:21:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	Hang on mate doing some research
2007-12-19T18:26:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	I can see no reason why the 32 bit version will not work!
2007-12-19T18:26:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	what is the error message you are getting?
2007-12-19T18:26:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	this was the error message i was getting before i downloaded the 64 bit version
2007-12-19T18:27:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	can you mount the image as a loop filesystem?
2007-12-19T18:28:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	not sure i'm using ultraiso let me try
2007-12-19T18:28:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	are you in window$ at the moment?
2007-12-19T18:28:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	yes windows xp
2007-12-19T18:29:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	i'm not sure if it makes a difference but i'm on a laptop..
2007-12-19T18:29:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	Ok sounds like you may have a dodgy iso, or maybe a dodgy burn
2007-12-19T18:30:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	not sure what a doggy of anything of that sort is
2007-12-19T18:33:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	dodgy = not working
2007-12-19T18:34:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	oh lol thanks... and well the 64 bit version was more responsive than the 32 bit i downloaded.. but the 64 is referring me to the not working 32 lol... dunno why the 32 isnt working at all
2007-12-19T18:35:00.000Z	Mechdave	m3gach33zy	No worries, sorry I could not be more helpful
2007-12-19T18:36:00.000Z	m3gach33zy	Mechdave	no worries, thanks for the try i'll have to try to update more hardware stuff to see if that works
