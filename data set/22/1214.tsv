2010-08-15T04:30:00.000Z	avi_		hey, where are mounted CDs mounted to? Like if I wanted to SSH into my comp, and cd to a CD I have in the computer, where would I cd to? Thanks!
2010-08-15T04:30:00.000Z	avi_		Because it's not in /cdrom or /media.
2010-08-15T04:30:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	/dev/sr? something
2010-08-15T04:32:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	Not that I can see, I don't have a /sr folder, and I've checked the similarly named ones. Hmm
2010-08-15T04:32:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	what does fstab -l say?
2010-08-15T04:34:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	Interestingly enough, command not found. I'm using lucid, and the only thing fstab thing I have in /etc is fstab-decode. Hmmmmm
2010-08-15T04:36:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	No wait, that's wrong. I've got fstab in there but it when I type fstab, fstab -l, or sudo fstab, the command isn't found..
2010-08-15T04:45:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	ok hope that helped
2010-08-15T04:36:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	ok try mount -l
2010-08-15T04:38:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	the cd has to be mounted
2010-08-15T04:38:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	Yeah that worked. I see my internal and external hard drives.
2010-08-15T04:38:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	It is indeed mounted, or at least I can browse it in nautilus
2010-08-15T04:38:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	the cd has to be mounted then you can talk to it
2010-08-15T04:39:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	But shouldn't viewing and playing the contents in nautilus indicate that its mounted?
2010-08-15T04:39:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	so wheres it mounted at?
2010-08-15T04:39:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	yes it seems to be mounted
2010-08-15T04:40:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	That's the question.. I think it should be in /media/cdrom0, but it's not.. let me try ejecting and remounting..
2010-08-15T04:41:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	well mount -l tells you where its mounted
2010-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	has that helped?
2010-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	AH! I've found it! It was listed in mount -l, but I initially overlooked it because I didn't think that it would be located at /home/myuseracc/.gvfs/cdda mount on sr0... what a terrible place to mount!
2010-08-15T04:45:00.000Z	avi_	annnie	Yes, thanks a bunch!
2010-08-15T04:46:00.000Z	annnie	avi_	np glad to help
