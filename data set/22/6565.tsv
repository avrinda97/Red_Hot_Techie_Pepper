2006-09-23T11:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	you type it in.
2006-09-23T11:54:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	Where, though?
2006-09-23T11:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	cd /FA311v2\ V1.0/
2006-09-23T12:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	its ./configure && make
2006-09-23T12:03:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	Oh, lmao, thanks
2006-09-23T12:04:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	I get the same error...
2006-09-23T12:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-09-23T12:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	then do it.
2006-09-23T12:07:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	Is this normal? It returned, "Reading package lists... done *new line* Building dependency tree... Done *new line* Package build-essential is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source *new line* E: Package build-essential has no installation candidate"
2006-09-23T12:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	run sudo apt-get update
2006-09-23T12:08:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	The only reason why I'm in here is because I have no internet, lmao, that didn't work.
2006-09-23T12:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	then you are stuck, because you need to install build-essential tools first.
2006-09-23T12:16:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	Am I able to download them with my working computer, then somehow move them over to my Ubuntu machine?
2006-09-23T12:16:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	I mean, I know how I can move them over, but how would I install them?
2006-09-23T12:16:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	Is it possible?
2006-09-23T12:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	sure its possible.
2006-09-23T12:16:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	No, I'm on WinXP
2006-09-23T12:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	hrmm, its a bit of a hassle then.
2006-09-23T12:17:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	Well, is there a link somewhere that I can get?
2006-09-23T12:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	PopeOfWar	since build-essential is a meta-package, not exactly. Hold a sec.
2006-09-23T12:18:00.000Z	PopeOfWar	fyrestrtr	Okay, thanks
