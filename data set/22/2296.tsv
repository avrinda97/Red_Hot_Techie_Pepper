2009-11-27T13:16:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46		OK. If I drop to root from the  CD's boot menu how much control over the system do I actually have.  For instance, can I delete and create files and folders?
2009-11-27T13:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	You can do anything from the LiveCD
2009-11-27T13:18:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	 Do I need to do anything special?  Like to delete files?
2009-11-27T13:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	What specifically are you trying to do and why?
2009-11-27T13:20:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	I tried "sudo -i" but that didn't work
2009-11-27T13:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	What specifically are you trying to do and why?
2009-11-27T13:22:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	I removed and purged gimp.  I want to remove the left over files.(125)
2009-11-27T13:23:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	 "sudo" didn't work, nor does"sudo -i"
2009-11-27T13:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	In what way didn't it work?
2009-11-27T13:26:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	Sorry..more specifically  "sudo -i" should give me full permissions on all folders.  However it let me remove some folders but not others. And seemingly no files.
2009-11-27T13:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	What is the exact command you are running and what is the error that you get?
2009-11-27T13:28:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	 No command per-se. I used "sudo -i" and made the password, expecting to select all the files and folders and delete them all at once.
2009-11-27T13:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	"made the password"?
2009-11-27T13:30:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	when I do "sudo -i" then I use "sudo password root" and enter a password
2009-11-27T13:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	Why did you do that?
2009-11-27T13:34:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	OK I read a tut, It said type "sudo -i" and that would temporarily be like logging in as root. It also said the I had to enable it by typing "sudo passwd root". Using search feature I found all the left over files.  I want to select them all, and delete them all at once. To do this I need to have full permissions on all the files and folders, and the tut said that "sudo -i" etc. would do it
2009-11-27T13:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	You don't need to enable anything to use sudo -i, and you don't want to run "sudo passwd root" unless you really know what you are doing
2009-11-27T13:37:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	OK. I'll accept that, but why does it not give me full permissions?
2009-11-27T13:38:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	Or am I missing something here?
2009-11-27T13:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	What permissions does it not give you? What command are you running and what error are you getting ( after running sudo -i )?
2009-11-27T13:40:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	Jordan_U	 No error. The tut said "sudo -i" would be temporarily like logging in as root, which you can't do.  And that it would give me full permission on all files and folders.
2009-11-27T13:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lostinspace_46	And what makes you think "sudo -i" didn't do exactly that?
