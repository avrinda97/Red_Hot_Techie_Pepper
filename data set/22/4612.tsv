2007-12-15T23:05:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	messengers is easy, use Gaim or similar. Don't expect advanced features to always work.
2007-12-15T23:05:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	games... Don't expect DirectX games to work.
2007-12-15T23:07:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	Wine might be a solution. But it could be a bit of a pain. Google is your friend.
2007-12-15T23:14:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	you can't safe anything with a livecd, unless you use complicated stuff like USB sticks and all that
2007-12-15T23:14:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	but if you just want to get a feeling for it, go ahead.
2007-12-15T23:15:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	Normally, yes
2007-12-15T23:16:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	the live cd = the install cd
2007-12-15T23:16:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	it runs Ubuntu and has an option to install it
2007-12-15T23:16:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	yep
2007-12-15T23:17:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	good luck & have fun :)
2007-12-15T23:19:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	just follow the install guide on the disk
2007-12-15T23:24:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	FallenStrife	Ouch. I wouldn't dualboot on that.
