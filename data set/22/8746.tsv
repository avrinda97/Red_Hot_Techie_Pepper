2005-08-04T16:45:00.000Z	levander		There is a command line alternative to cdrecord?  cdrecord isn't inter-operating with cron so good.
2005-08-04T12:17:00.000Z	levander		Do mpg files have some kind of ID3 tag in them?
2005-08-04T12:18:00.000Z	levander		what about a UNIX utility I can use to read the id3 tag?
2005-08-04T12:19:00.000Z	linukso	levander	id3tools
2005-08-04T12:21:00.000Z	levander	linukso	'apt-cache search id3tools' says there's no package named that in the ubuntu repositories.  There's another name for this package?
2005-08-04T12:21:00.000Z	levander	linukso	my bad, it's called id3tool
2005-08-04T12:22:00.000Z	linukso	levander	minus the "s" :)
2005-08-04T12:26:00.000Z	linukso	levander	mpgtx - Toolbox to manipulate MPEG files (video, system, and audio)
2005-08-04T12:32:00.000Z	levander	linukso	i just looked at mpgtx quickly.  You know that mpgtx will tell me the number of seconds, or you were suggesting to look into that?  Cause, looking quickly, I don't see where mpgtx tells the number of seconds.
2005-08-04T12:33:00.000Z	linukso	levander	Sorry I dont know it, just found it when searching for id3tools
2005-08-04T12:36:00.000Z	linukso	levander	loosers with lots of time to waste :)
2005-08-04T12:36:00.000Z	levander	linukso	apparently, i can't imagine why that's fun just to send a lot of random characters into a channel
2005-08-04T12:38:00.000Z	linukso	levander	mplayer is the only one usable on cheezy hardware...
2005-08-04T12:39:00.000Z	linukso	levander	it works fine
2005-08-07T14:43:00.000Z	linukso	levander	email to root will be sent to you admin user.
2005-08-07T14:44:00.000Z	linukso	levander	check out /etc/aliases
2005-08-07T14:54:00.000Z	levander	linukso	actually, /etc/aliases has root aliased to my local user name
2005-08-07T14:58:00.000Z	linukso	levander	wasn't that what you wanted?
2005-08-07T15:00:00.000Z	levander	linukso	i was saying it works for my regular user, but not for the root user
2005-08-07T15:01:00.000Z	linukso	levander	any reason you want to send mail as root?
2005-08-07T15:12:00.000Z	levander	linukso	I don't want to send mail as root.  I want to send mail to root.  I've got a cron job set up to backup my system. This script has to be run as root.  I don't want the email going to the root user, I never check that email.  And, I certainly don't want that email going to my ISP, as root's email is now.
2005-08-07T15:12:00.000Z	levander	linukso	But, apparently, mailing to 'root@localhost' works fine, it's just mailing to 'root' that's not working.
