2011-06-13T03:51:00.000Z	bullgard4		Why does on a new computer Tilda  not show the »Monospace 6« font as wide as on my old computer having the same vertical pixel number and the same display screen height? http:/paste.ubuntu.com/625488
2011-06-13T03:51:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	dpi?
2011-06-13T03:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	If the dpi differ, the font's height would differ. But they do not.
2011-06-13T03:57:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	have you compared screenshots at a pixel by pixel level?
2011-06-13T03:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	No. It is my visual impression. And the difference is so large, that everybody would see it easily.
2011-06-13T04:01:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	its possible that xft is doing some width for height stuff to make it look better at that small size and needs to do less of it for one than the other
2011-06-13T04:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	I will further investigate your suggestion tomorrow.--  Thank you for your suggestion.
2011-06-13T20:58:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	xrandr should be able to do that (nvidia doesnt support all xrandr features)
2011-06-13T21:17:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	'~$ man xrandr; Xrandr can also be used to set the screen size.' Will be '~$ xrandr --fbmm 332x208' the correct syntax?
2011-06-13T21:18:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	sure
2011-06-13T21:26:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	My computuer accepted this command. It did not complain. '~$ xdpyinfo' shows now: "screen #0: dimensions: 1680x1050 pixels (332x208 millimeters); resolution 129x128 dots per inch." This is almost what I wanted. Will this setting be permanent for this computer? When will it be effective for GNOME?
2011-06-13T21:27:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	you will need to run that on every login or add it to your xsession or gnome-session-properties
2011-06-16T21:14:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	i doubt it is mapped to anything as guake likes to install itself to f12
2011-06-16T21:15:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	Ok. Thank you.
2011-12-17T10:13:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	it means there is a : in the filename
2011-12-17T10:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	Can you tell me why there is there a colon in the filename?
2011-12-17T10:15:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	hm
2011-12-29T11:01:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	have you looked at extensions.gnome.org recently. its progressing incredibly rapidly
2011-12-29T11:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	No. Not yet. I am reporting bugs and will wait for Ubuntu 12.04 Beta.
2012-02-11T13:09:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	callbacks are (generally) function pointers called by an event handler to "callback" to the code that bound to the event
2012-02-11T13:10:00.000Z	escott	bullgard4	in this case poweroff.c is binding to a sysrq event which is handled by a kernel input event handler, and is giving it a function pointer that i is requesting be called when that key combination is pressed
2012-02-11T13:10:00.000Z	bullgard4	escott	I need a bit time to fully understand your explanation. --  Thank you for your explanation and help.
