2007-09-18T13:41:00.000Z	qmyro		hi all i am trying to build boost from source does someone have a how to or a link
2007-09-18T13:41:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	any reason to build from source?
2007-09-18T13:41:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	boost C libraries right?
2007-09-18T13:42:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	 it's buggy, what do you mean?
2007-09-18T13:42:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	if it's less than 4 lines, otherwise pastebin
2007-09-18T13:42:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	if you find a bug it would be helpful to submit a bug report to LaunchPad so we can either Sync the new version of boost or backport a patch to the current one.
2007-09-18T13:46:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	do you have libboost-thread-dev?
2007-09-18T13:47:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	sudo apt-get install libboost-thread-dev
2007-09-18T13:47:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	ok, pkgconfig var might be set wrong
2007-09-18T13:48:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	try "PKG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/pkgconfig/ ./configure"
2007-09-18T13:56:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	there's probably an error or warning before that?
2007-09-18T13:57:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=bits%2Fatomicity.h&searchmode=searchfiles&case=insensitive&version=feisty&arch=i386
2007-09-18T13:57:00.000Z	xtknight	qmyro	it looks like you want to install "build-essential" (try that first), or "libstdc++6-dev"
2007-09-18T14:01:00.000Z	qmyro	xtknight	how do I bin paste?
