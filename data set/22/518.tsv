2011-08-10T13:47:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy		JakeR003.... that's part of compiz.... brb gotta get you the name of the app that lets you edit it...
2011-08-10T13:48:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy		JakeR003... go to terminal... type --> sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-08-10T13:49:00.000Z	JakeR003	SeeknDestroy	wow man.. that is so easy
2011-08-10T13:53:00.000Z	JakeR003	SeeknDestroy	where are you from?
2011-08-10T13:58:00.000Z	JakeR003	SeeknDestroy	what happens when i delete the animation?
2011-08-10T14:06:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: System/Preferences/Startup Applications
2011-08-10T14:07:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: As I was saying earlier... if you found the need to turn off the basic Compiz animation on window open (Fade)... your system probably has a low-spec video card, and you'd benefit from turning compiz off completely (System/Preferences/Appearance-->Visual Effects-->None).... which reverts your window manager to the default Metacity that qin suggested
2011-08-10T14:08:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: Yes on the untick
2011-08-10T14:08:00.000Z	JakeR003	SeeknDestroy	yeah i turned off the animation and everythign seems faster than windows
2011-08-10T14:09:00.000Z	JakeR003	SeeknDestroy	what happen if i remove the service? without unticking the box..
2011-08-10T14:09:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: That's just one graphical effect that you don't need.... turning the visual effects off completely halts compiz from loading completely and will give you additional performance.... and you shouldn't completely remove the services... just uncheck the boxes... much harder to readd it if you need it at later date
2011-08-10T14:14:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: Quite a few games run under Wine, which now has some limited DirectX support.... there's also "PlayOnLinux".... you can check Wine's website for a list of all the games that work on it so far.... the main/only game I play is Unreal Tournament 2004 which runs better on Linux than on Windows.... so no Windows for me :)
2011-08-10T14:18:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: cuz it's a much more efficient OS... all there is to it
2011-08-10T14:19:00.000Z	JakeR003	SeeknDestroy	linux doesnt require disk defragmentor?
2011-08-10T14:20:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: Nope.... linux is da bomb.
2011-08-10T14:21:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: Take away all the limitations windows forces on it via software titles, directx/etc for gaming... and linux would stomp the crap out of windows
2011-08-10T14:21:00.000Z	JakeR003	SeeknDestroy	i agree with you. i bought windows vista ultimate which at that time cost around 400USD for retail box
2011-08-10T14:21:00.000Z	SeeknDestroy	JakeR003	: Sorry to hear that!
