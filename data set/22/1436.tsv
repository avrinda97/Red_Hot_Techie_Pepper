2010-05-15T07:55:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist		I'm trying to use VNC from my ubuntu machine to my windows machine. All I get is "connection closed". It worked before, but nothing's changed. It just... stopped working.
2010-05-15T07:55:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist		Can anyone help?
2010-05-15T07:56:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	1) you want to see your Windows on the Ubuntu Screen?
2010-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	Yes. And Yes.
2010-05-15T07:58:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	something obviously _has_ changed. Perhaps your Ubuntu machine is now offline? Firewall blocking? Perhaps on the Windows machine, the VNC Server crashed/stopped? I prefer to let VNC run in App mode on Windows, not as a service.
2010-05-15T07:58:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	don't worry about that PM :-)
2010-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	Hmm... let's go bottom-up: Please ping the Windows machine and see, if that works
2010-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	and thechris: Successfully pinged the windows machine.
2010-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	Restart the windows machine. If possible, uninstall the VNC service, in order for you to be able to start VNC as a normal Application later
2010-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	Will do, one moment.
2010-05-15T08:04:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	you can disable the firewall first for checking
2010-05-15T08:04:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	okeydokey
2010-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	and thechris: Windows machine re-booted, VNC service unregistered, firewall disabled.
2010-05-15T08:10:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	now start VNC as app. It is an entry in the start menu... VNC Server USER MODE or so
2010-05-15T08:10:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	done.
2010-05-15T08:11:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	now use the Ubuntu VNC client again and try to connect
2010-05-15T08:11:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	if that does not work, check the settings of your VNC server with right click on the icon in the system tray of the windows machin (bottom right usually)
2010-05-15T08:12:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	check by re-activating Windows' firewall
2010-05-15T08:13:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	Firewall reactivated, VNC still works, so it wasn't that.
2010-05-15T08:14:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	Hmm. Now it's getting harder to find the reason. I'd suggest you be happy for now. If it happens again, you need to find a pattern. Once you can reproduce the "failing", you have a good chance of repairing.
2010-05-15T08:14:00.000Z	terrorPhysicist	hmw	I'm thinking it was the fact I had it registered as a service. That's the only thing that changed, and I've had similar issues in the past.
2010-05-15T08:15:00.000Z	hmw	terrorPhysicist	I can't tell, I never used it as service *smirks*
