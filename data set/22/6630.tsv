2006-09-12T16:28:00.000Z	sethk		because the command has rc in it, and if you ran it, you'll find it that way
2006-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	iceman24k	sethk	i get a weird message about runlevel 1
2006-09-12T10:14:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	did you get my message?
2006-09-12T10:15:00.000Z	iceman24k	sethk	yes, systems wont boot now, no x
2006-09-12T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	no X may make sense.  not booting does not.
2006-09-12T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	I think perhaps you don't really mean it's not booting.
2006-09-12T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	it is probably booting and then giving you an error message and dumping you in a shell, which is entirely different
2006-09-12T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	I can't help you if you can't be accurate.
2006-09-12T10:16:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	sure
2006-09-12T10:17:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	or just edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and change nvidia to nv
2006-09-12T10:17:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	it doesn't hang there.  hang means the machine is dead, the caps lock key doesn't work, control-alt-f1 doesn't show a console, etc.
2006-09-12T10:18:00.000Z	iceman24k	sethk	it does nothing at the hardware detection area, and i cannot get it out of that area. is the a way to verbrose the boot provess to see wahts going on
2006-09-12T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	no, but you can reboot in recovery mode, and look at the log file in /var/log
2006-09-12T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	it will tell you what happened.  it will be /var/log/X.......     the only one starting with X
2006-09-12T10:20:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	whichever is easier
2006-09-12T10:57:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	let's back up and think for a moment.  We know the following things:
2006-09-12T10:57:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	one, you installed the nvidia drivers with no problems in breezy
2006-09-12T10:57:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	you followed the instructions for doing it in dapper and it isn't working for you
2006-09-12T10:57:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	therefore, none of the things you are thinking, looking at, etc., make the slightest bit of sense, because if they did, breezy wouldn't work either.
2006-09-12T10:58:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	what you should do is simply run breezy.  Why do you need to upgrade, _right now_, to dapper?
2006-09-12T10:58:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	wait until dapper gets all sorted out, and then use it.
2006-09-16T10:04:00.000Z	sethk	iceman24k	have you tried the apache irc channels?
