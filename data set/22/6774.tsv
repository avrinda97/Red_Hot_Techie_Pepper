2007-04-02T15:32:00.000Z	napster	LjL	this is it http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13591/
2007-04-02T15:33:00.000Z	LjL	napster	it looks fine, which means your problem lies somewhere else. i'd give a thought about the possibility that your hardware is bad
2007-04-02T15:33:00.000Z	LjL	napster	while on a live CD, install the "smartmontools" package and run "smartctl -H /dev/yourHD", check that it reports good health. run a memtest (available from the live CD boot menu), as well
2007-04-02T15:36:00.000Z	napster	LjL	didnt get u???????
2007-04-02T15:36:00.000Z	LjL	napster	what didn't you get?
2007-04-02T15:38:00.000Z	napster	LjL	napster: while on a live CD, install the "smartmontools" package and run "smartctl -H /dev/yourHD", check that it reports good health. run a memtest (available from the live CD boot menu), as wel
2007-04-02T15:39:00.000Z	LjL	napster	alright, which part of that did you not get?
2007-04-02T15:40:00.000Z	napster	LjL	can u explain how its done again?
2007-04-02T15:41:00.000Z	LjL	napster	1) boot from the Live CD    2) at the menu, select Test Memory (or whatever it's called)  3) let it run for an hour or two. this will check your RAM
2007-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	LjL	napster	the other thing is  1) boot from the Live CD again, but this time just let it start up normally  2) open a terminal, and type  sudo apt-get install smartmontools   3) type  sudo smartctl -H /dev/the-device-name-of-your-HD 
2007-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	napster	LjL	then wat?
2007-04-02T15:43:00.000Z	LjL	napster	then nothing, this is just to test your hardware (memory and HD) and see if it's OK.
