2008-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	KiwiJoker	Gioacchino	sounds like you got a UID mismatch in fstab
2008-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	Gioacchino	KiwiJoker	 how to fix it??
2008-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	KiwiJoker	Gioacchino	on the ubuntu site, there should be a section in community docs about fstab, its to much to type to explain here
2008-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	KiwiJoker		!fstab
2008-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	KiwiJoker	Gioacchino	there you go
2008-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	Gioacchino	KiwiJoker	thanks
2008-04-25T00:03:00.000Z	Gioacchino	KiwiJoker	 how to get real uid of ext3 ?
2008-04-25T00:03:00.000Z	KiwiJoker	Gioacchino	dont use UID's in fstab
2008-04-25T00:03:00.000Z	KiwiJoker	Gioacchino	just /dev/<whatever>
2008-04-25T00:04:00.000Z	Gioacchino	KiwiJoker	 then I remove uuid and put  /dev/sda3 ??
2008-04-25T00:04:00.000Z	KiwiJoker	Gioacchino	if thats the name of your device, then yep
2008-04-25T00:05:00.000Z	KiwiJoker	Gioacchino	you can find out your HD's "device name" by opening terminal and typing in "df" without the commers
