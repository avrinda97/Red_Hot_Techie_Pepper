2008-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	Gottaname		yeah
2008-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	Gottaname		:P
2008-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	Gottaname		go and get boot tools
2008-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	Gottaname		important data?
2008-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	Gottaname		then?
2008-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	Gottaname		you are trying to use RAID?
2008-03-29T11:56:00.000Z	Gottaname		hmmm
2008-03-29T11:57:00.000Z	Gottaname		I suggest you don't use raid
2008-03-29T11:57:00.000Z	Gottaname		usually sadly if it doesn't work out for you
2008-03-29T11:57:00.000Z	Gottaname		you might have to try other distros
2008-03-29T11:58:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Gottaname	do you mean ubuntu is not good with raid? which distro is good for raid?
2008-03-29T11:58:00.000Z	Gottaname		are you using hardware or software raid?
2008-03-29T11:59:00.000Z	Gottaname		depends on some distros
2008-03-29T11:59:00.000Z	Gottaname		that's one weird motherboard you have there.
2008-03-29T11:59:00.000Z	mmm4m5m		:)
2008-03-29T12:00:00.000Z	Gottaname	gd1	basic troubleshooting is to remove any components which you think is causing the problem and then try again
2008-03-29T12:02:00.000Z	Gottaname	gd1	try removing the TV tuner card
2008-03-29T12:02:00.000Z	Gottaname		and leave in a single harddisk
2008-03-29T12:02:00.000Z	Gottaname		and then try
2008-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	Gottaname		if only people in this channel helped gd1 instead of calling me a troll
2008-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	Gottaname		then maybe I wouldn't have such a bad impression of ubuntu
2008-03-29T12:05:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Gottaname	found a job for gd1 during this weekend... I hate all hardware related problems (still new in linux)
