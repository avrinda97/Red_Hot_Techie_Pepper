2007-07-21T05:07:00.000Z	LinuxProbie		how do I get rid of this bloody keychain?
2007-07-21T05:08:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	use pam keyring instead. only need password once (at login) instead of twice
2007-09-12T06:59:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	yes, that's an easter egg
2007-09-12T06:59:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	try typing "apt-get moo" and see what happens
2007-09-12T07:07:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	chmod, but what are you changing?  if it's outside /home, *don't do it unless you know /exactly/ what you are doing*
2007-09-12T07:07:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	macogw	I;m changing the folder for my azureus so it can update itself.
2007-09-12T07:08:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	where is that?
2007-09-12T07:09:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	macogw	it's in /
2007-09-12T07:11:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	nothing outside of ~ should have higher permissions than 755
2007-09-12T07:11:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	why do you need to chmod /opt to update it?
2007-09-12T07:11:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	macogw	because that may be the reason it can't update.
2007-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	how are you updating it?
2007-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	with a deb or compiling?
2007-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	macogw	from inside azureus itself.
2007-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	macogw	it updates itself.
2007-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	run azureus as root
2007-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	and update it that way
2007-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	macogw	that didn't help.
2007-09-12T07:13:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	"gksu azureus" then update doesn't work?  root has access to everything, so if as root it doesn't work, that's not the problem
2007-09-12T07:17:00.000Z	LinuxProbie	macogw	That seems to have worked, but I don't wanna have to run azureus from the terminal all the time...
2007-09-12T07:17:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	just for updates would you have to do that
2007-09-12T07:17:00.000Z	macogw	LinuxProbie	normally, you should not run it as root...bad for security
