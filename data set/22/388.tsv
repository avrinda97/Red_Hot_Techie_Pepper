2011-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	SrPx		are there any text editors in ubuntu with level folding like notepad++?
2011-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	heh
2011-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	yes, try geany
2011-11-01T07:16:00.000Z	SrPx	reisio	he has syntax lightning for the common languages and level folding just like notepad++ where you can collapse/expand by level with hotkeys
2011-11-01T07:16:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	probably
2011-11-01T07:16:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	notepad++ isn't exactly amazing, except compared to notepad
2011-11-01T07:17:00.000Z	SrPx	reisio	I just need that feature to work. its beautiful to have every function definition aligned with 1 click.
2011-11-01T07:18:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	my guess is it's something you can manage with geany, but I don't personally use that program enough to tell you for sure
2011-11-01T07:18:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	#geany might know for sure, or you could just take a chance and find out on your own
2011-11-01T07:19:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	if not there are tons of other GUI text editors that do code folding
2011-11-01T07:19:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	which did you check?
2011-11-01T07:25:00.000Z	SrPx	reisio	bekks: just wondering, if you dont use code folding how do you browse though the functions of your source? if you have to find a function called foo in a source with thousands of functions you just... ctrl+F? ;x
2011-11-01T07:27:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	folding doesn't help you find something unless you're using a mouse to find it
2011-11-01T07:27:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	which is the slow way
2011-11-01T07:30:00.000Z	SrPx	reisio	not exactly finding but visualizing. you can have an overview of the entire source. at any moment you can see every namespace 1 per line. then every object of a namespace. when every function of any given object. but ok nvm :/
2011-11-01T07:32:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	dunno man :p
2011-11-01T07:32:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	you sound like a Python guy
2011-11-01T07:33:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	admit it :)
2011-11-01T07:37:00.000Z	SrPx	reisio	nop unfortunatelly
2011-11-01T07:37:00.000Z	SrPx	reisio	but id like to learn it too
2011-11-01T07:37:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	I bet you would! :p
2011-11-01T07:50:00.000Z	reisio	SrPx	find . -iname '*source*plugin*'
