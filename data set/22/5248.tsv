2007-07-10T05:21:00.000Z	pi3		does rm move to the trash bin?
2007-07-10T05:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	no
2007-07-10T05:22:00.000Z	pi3	Chousuke	ouch!, is there any parameter to?
2007-07-10T05:22:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	no, but you could use rm -i so that it confirms deletion
2007-07-10T05:22:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	or alias rm to rm -i so that it's automatic
2007-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	pi3	Chousuke	how would I recursively remove all *.ini files?
2007-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	hmm
2007-07-10T05:23:00.000Z	pi3	Chousuke	yes, that would be better
2007-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	try find . -name "*.ini" -exec echo "{}"\;
2007-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		that doesn't delete anything
2007-07-10T05:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		it just echoes
2007-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	and if that seems to echo teh right files, you can change the echo command to rm
2007-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	I'm not sure if it's correct though
2007-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	Chousuke		so be careful
2007-07-10T05:25:00.000Z	pi3	Chousuke	yes, thanks. Well I luckily had a backup of my music
2007-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	backups are good for you :)
2007-07-10T05:26:00.000Z	pi3	Chousuke	mainly if you are a nub with a terminal, and have write permissions
2007-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	they're always good!
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	I wish I'd had backups when my drive said boom
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	pi3	Chousuke	heh
2007-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	pi3	Chousuke	I don't understand why "find *.ini ~/Musica" returns mp3 files
2007-07-10T05:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	pi3	you need to give a predicate to find
