2010-12-14T16:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	rufra: It's normal for a swap partition to show up in fdisk as swap/solaris, they share the same msdos partition type.
2010-12-14T16:18:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	ahh ok
2010-12-14T16:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	rufra: Use "sudo blkid" for a better idea of what's actually on each partition.
2010-12-14T16:28:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	can you make anything of the /dev/loop0? (reference to rufra's problem - http://paste.ubuntu.com/543527/)
2010-12-14T16:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	That's part of the liveCD environment (loop mounted squashfs file).
2010-12-14T16:29:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	ok.. i had never heard of that
2010-12-14T16:31:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	yep sorry about that.. my bad
2010-12-14T16:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	np :)
2010-12-14T16:32:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	:)
2010-12-26T16:04:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	any experience/knowledge of wireless adapters?
2010-12-26T16:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	Yes, but I also am currently using CDMA in the U.S. with Ubuntu 10.10 but can't answer manlymat183, so no guarentee that I'll be able to answer your real question either :)
2010-12-26T16:07:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	not mine actually, but about the network manager disconnecting a wireless adapter conn. frequently
2010-12-26T16:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	Other than that it's likely a driver issue and that dmesg might give some insights I can't really help there.
2010-12-26T16:08:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	ok thanks:)
2010-12-26T16:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	You're welcome :)
2010-12-26T18:52:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	if you get this, just thought id let you know the problem i asked you about earlier is resolved.. a kernel wireless module backport did it (the disconnecting wireless adapter thing :))
2011-01-03T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	tortoise7: update-initramfs needs to be run in a chroot (with /dev/ /proc/ /sys/ and /dev/pts/ mounted in the chroot).
2011-01-03T13:04:00.000Z	rs0832	Jordan_U	k thanks :)
2011-01-03T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rs0832	You're welcome.
