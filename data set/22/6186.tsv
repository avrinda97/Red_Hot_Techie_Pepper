2006-12-11T17:34:00.000Z	kenThomson		i got a 160GB Seagate barracuda, and i want to setup Ubuntu on it! Can someone tell me how to partition most effectively
2006-12-11T17:34:00.000Z	kenThomson		please note that 1GB of Swap will be on HDD-2. HDD-2 also contains WindowsXP
2006-12-11T17:35:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	if you are just using it for general use I would recommend a 40gb / partition and the rest for /home
2006-12-11T17:35:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	Root is mainly for programs right?
2006-12-11T17:35:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	How much space do those require?
2006-12-11T17:36:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	I will be installing programs for Designing (2d animation, 3d animation, vector-pixel based graphic software, audio editing etc)
2006-12-11T17:36:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	yeah - root is for programs and stuff and on linux there are many more shared libraries than on windows so the programs tend to be much smaller - you will be fine with 40gb i would think
2006-12-11T17:37:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	i think 40gb is too large
2006-12-11T17:37:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	Don't you think so?
2006-12-11T17:37:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	I mean 40gb of programs!!?
2006-12-11T17:37:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	the thing that will take the space is the rendering files as they will be large so you may need the space for /tmp unless you render stuff in /home
2006-12-11T17:37:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	that also includes themes and graphics for those programs etc
2006-12-11T17:37:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	I would rather have more space than not enough
2006-12-11T17:38:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	i wanted to do a 10gb root! What do you say about that?
2006-12-11T17:38:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	i have noticed that data expands to fill all space available, so mac space for /home is a top priority
2006-12-11T17:39:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	I would go for 20 as base ubuntu takes about 8 i think
2006-12-11T17:39:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	would you say <20gb for / is not enough
2006-12-11T17:41:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	on my server I have used about 20gb and the same on my laptop accordign to df
2006-12-11T17:42:00.000Z	kenThomson	hjmills	i would repeat, Would you say that <20GB for / is not enough? (for designing needs)
2006-12-11T17:42:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	i would reccommend 20 gb just so you dont find yourself wanting later
2006-12-11T17:42:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	its much easier to add an external hdd for the media rather than having to repartion
2006-12-11T17:44:00.000Z	hjmills	kenThomson	on my home pc I have an 80gb disk with 2gb swap, 30gb music (to match my zen) and the rest as root but Im only using 12%
