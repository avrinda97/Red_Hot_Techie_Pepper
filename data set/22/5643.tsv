2007-03-27T05:02:00.000Z	um_who2		 i am still pretty new to ubuntu so i just offered a little thing that worked for me
2007-03-27T05:03:00.000Z	um_who2		 i could never get firefox to play cool with wvm files with its embedded player.
2007-03-27T05:04:00.000Z	um_who2		 i am in hopes that one day i will see someone ask that question and get a real answer that works for me
2007-03-27T05:05:00.000Z	um_who2		yes
2007-03-27T05:05:00.000Z	um_who2		i am sure there is a way to pick your embedded player for firefox, but i don't know how
2007-03-27T05:05:00.000Z	um_who2		let me define real so not to sound like an ass, real as in one that works for me. haha
2007-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	um_who2		 oh!
2007-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	um_who2		 haha
2007-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	um_who2		how do you uninstall a player?
2007-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	um_who2		 and surely you can have more than one but define whichever one you want for firefox?
2007-03-27T05:07:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	yes, you link to the plugin in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2007-03-27T05:11:00.000Z	um_who2	clemyeats	in the /usr/lib/firefox/plugins dir is there some file i should edit?
2007-03-27T05:12:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	remove the plugins you don't want in there
2007-03-27T05:12:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	the totem stuff for instance
2007-03-27T05:27:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	no problem
2007-03-27T05:12:00.000Z	um_who2	clemyeats	not to keep bothering you but what i don't see anything close to mplayer in there.
2007-03-27T05:13:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	do you have the mplayer plugins installed ?
2007-03-27T05:15:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	sudo apt-get remove totem-mozilla
2007-03-27T05:15:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
2007-03-27T05:15:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	eventually add windows codecs.
2007-03-27T05:19:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	did you install mozilla-mplayer ??
2007-03-27T05:23:00.000Z	clemyeats	um_who2	well ... :)
