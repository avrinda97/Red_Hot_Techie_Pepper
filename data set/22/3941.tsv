2008-05-16T23:00:00.000Z	frieze		okay so I can't seem to get my new 8.04 server to allow x11 forwarding. I've added the host using xhost at the client end and added x11 forwarding to the ssh_config file. Is there anything else I should be doing to get $DISPLAY set?
2008-05-16T23:02:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	do you get any interesting information when you increase the debugging? i.e. ssh -vvv -X ip-address
2008-05-16T23:11:00.000Z	frieze	goibhniu	sorry for the delay. Got a phone book
2008-05-16T23:11:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	and when you try to run something? .. e.g. xclock
2008-05-16T23:12:00.000Z	frieze	goibhniu	more debug info, just the can't open display, display not set
2008-05-16T23:12:00.000Z	frieze		i'm sorry
2008-05-16T23:12:00.000Z	frieze		no more debug info
2008-05-16T23:13:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	hmm .. I assume you restarted the ssh server after changing the config?
2008-05-16T23:14:00.000Z	frieze	goibhniu	yes. though I just noticed something in that connect...Remote: No xauth program; cannot forward with spoofing
2008-05-16T23:14:00.000Z	frieze		noticed something in the debug on connect I mean
2008-05-16T23:15:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	interesting ..  have you got xauth installed?
2008-05-16T23:15:00.000Z	frieze	goibhniu	on the machine (a mac) I'm connecting from, yes
2008-05-16T23:16:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	and on the machine you're connecting to?
2008-05-16T23:16:00.000Z	frieze		no, did I need it?
2008-05-16T23:17:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	it's definitely installed on mine .. and when I connect $DISPLAY is set to localhost:10.0
2008-05-16T23:17:00.000Z	frieze		I'm used to doing the giant bag of crap install on previous servers.I guess I got that whole client vs. server dichotomy reversed again
2008-05-16T23:18:00.000Z	frieze	goibhniu	beautiful. Thanks
2008-05-16T23:18:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	 is it working?
2008-05-16T23:18:00.000Z	frieze		yup
2008-05-16T23:18:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	yay!
2008-05-16T23:19:00.000Z	frieze	goibhniu	thanks. Now I have to do all that fun new server stuff like reconfigure emacs and whatnot
2008-05-16T23:19:00.000Z	goibhniu	frieze	nice! have fun!
