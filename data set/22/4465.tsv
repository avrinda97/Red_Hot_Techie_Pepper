2008-01-03T12:25:00.000Z	tjmac		yeah my partitions are there and everything but I cant boot into linux
2008-01-03T12:27:00.000Z	tjmac		yeah , I hold it down and the disk drives dont show up like on this link
2008-01-03T12:28:00.000Z	tjmac		How do I choose the operating system that starts up (boots) my Mac?
2008-01-03T12:28:00.000Z	tjmac		After running Boot Camp Assistant and installing Microsoft Windows and the Boot Camp Drivers, hold the Option (Alt) key when you start up to switch between Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Use the Startup Disk control panel in Windows or Mac OS X Startup Disk preferences to set the default operating system to use each time the computer starts up.
2008-01-03T12:29:00.000Z	tjmac		How do I load that
2008-01-03T12:29:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	sorry to drive you off. i thought you were someone else and was joking around. anyway, i just heard from someone else in the channel that you were looking in #colorado for someone who was using ubuntu on a mac. I was one of two i know of but no expert by any means.
2008-01-03T12:30:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	yeah
2008-01-03T12:30:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	just use their name
2008-01-03T12:31:00.000Z	tjmac	musashi	how do I boot into Ubuntu when I turn on my mac?
2008-01-03T12:33:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	 hold it when you first start
2008-01-03T12:33:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	did you use boot camp to make the "windows" partition and then install ubuntu?
2008-01-03T12:33:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	one of them. sorry i don't remember which
2008-01-03T12:34:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	then one of those keys should open the boot camp menu and let you select ubuntu (although it's called "windows")
2008-01-03T12:35:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	right after but hold until you see the menu
2008-01-03T12:38:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	did anything happen? which key did you use
2008-01-03T12:39:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	so you held the "right" button for a long time and OSX just booted?
2008-01-03T12:40:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	yeah, i just don't remember which one. i was always trying several before i got it. didn't use it enough to remember.
2008-01-03T12:40:00.000Z	musashi	tjmac	are you sure you are using the "correct" button? try them all. one of 'em should work.
