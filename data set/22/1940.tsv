2009-12-12T01:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	I don't know
2009-12-12T01:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	and I don't think it's recommended either
2009-12-12T01:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	what do you mean by "wrecked" ?
2009-12-12T01:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	I can't see your messages very well.  Make sure that the letter at the start of my nick is a lowercase L
2009-12-12T01:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	what model network card are you using?
2009-12-12T01:44:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	its a broadcom heh
2009-12-12T01:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-12-12T01:46:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	fresh install of 9.10 cause when I upgraded it broke alot of stuff, since I dont know what ubuntu devs are doing, I mean i appreciate what they are doing but damn
2009-12-12T01:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	I generally would not use a release that isn't an LTS
2009-12-12T01:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	did you have to do anything special before to get your wireless to work?
2009-12-12T01:48:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	all I did was do an update everything was working beautifully
2009-12-12T01:49:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	it sucks cause everything was finally working and then i do an update and its wrecked I cannot select anything
2009-12-12T01:49:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	in the wireless that is
2009-12-12T01:49:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	the thing is that Im using the wireless right now I had to boot into safe mode
2009-12-12T01:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	then it's something in the regular mode causing it
2009-12-12T01:50:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	exactly
2009-12-12T01:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	what happens when you boot back into the regular mode after using safe mode?
2009-12-12T01:58:00.000Z	g__	lstarnes	ok well i would probably  have to do that in the regular mode to find a problem message
2009-12-12T02:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	g__	I'm not sure how to fix the issue that you are having.  I can't figure out what to look for in the bug reports either
