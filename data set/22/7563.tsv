2006-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	leroy		Can someone help me properly set permissions for apache so that I can write to the /var/www/ area :(
2006-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	leroy		yes it is, mneptok
2006-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	leroy		well, how do I check that?
2006-10-07T10:12:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	mneptok the apache user is normally www-data and if apache 1.3 or 2 ps ax |grep apache
2006-10-07T10:26:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	if you have chowned /var/www to www-data then only that user can save there I suggest to do all work in home folder then as root move it to web docroot and chown to www-data
2006-10-07T10:55:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	using it now
2006-10-07T10:57:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	no trick here's my guide http://forum.beryl-project.org/post-44103#p44103
2006-10-07T10:59:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	the guides for 32bit
2006-10-07T10:59:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	don't want to know about 64bit its a bit painful
2006-10-07T11:00:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	its doable but check the beryl forum there's sure to be a 64bit guide
2006-10-07T11:02:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	yeah suppose
2006-10-07T11:02:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	i think the tricks to get graphics driver working first then xgl etc
2006-10-07T11:03:00.000Z	noiesmo	leroy	ubuntu will pick up your win install and adjust mbr
