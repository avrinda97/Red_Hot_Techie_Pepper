2012-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	nsd_		I'm having some issues getting public key authentication to work with an openssh server. I have not edited /etc/sshd_config from the default, although I have checked and the AuthorizedKeysFile and PubKeyAuthentication appear properly set. I have the public key that I would like to use in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine, but I am not prompted for a passphrase. Anyone know their way around ssh that could help me?
2012-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	nsd_		I should note that when I say I am not prompted for a passphrase, I mean it asks for a password, which evidently is not what I am supposed to see.
2012-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	are you trying to use private key authentication/
2012-02-02T22:34:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	Yes.
2012-02-02T22:34:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	did you generate the RSA keys?
2012-02-02T22:34:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	Yes, and I copied the contents of the public key to the authorized_keys file on the remote machine
2012-02-02T22:34:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	make sure the file permissions are correct
2012-02-02T22:35:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	What do they need to be set to? As of right now I have u=r,og=r
2012-02-02T22:35:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	I believe it should be chmod'd to 400
2012-02-02T22:35:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	let me verify that
2012-02-02T22:36:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	I don't know the what the octal values correspond to off the top of my head.
2012-02-02T22:36:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	it should be -r--------
2012-02-02T22:36:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	Also, the various tutorials I have found online seemed to vary with regards to how permissive or otherwise they were.
2012-02-02T22:36:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	or just run chmod 400 on the file
2012-02-02T22:37:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	chmod 400 works fine on my debian server
2012-02-02T22:37:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	tomreyn: I will try that
2012-02-02T22:40:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	ah, well that would do it
2012-02-02T22:41:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	Actually, I checked the file against the man page and it appears correct. Perhaps I need to restart openssh?
2012-02-02T22:41:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	any time you modify sshd_conf, you should restart ssh
2012-02-02T22:41:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	I was unaware.
2012-02-02T22:41:00.000Z	nsd_	DinoMuffin	tomreyn: It works now, thanks for your help
2012-02-02T22:41:00.000Z	DinoMuffin	nsd_	no prob
