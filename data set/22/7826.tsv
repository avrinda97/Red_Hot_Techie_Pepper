2006-05-23T14:48:00.000Z	gray		hi all, i had a question about /etc/init.d =)
2006-05-23T14:49:00.000Z	gray		i just installed ircd-hybrid
2006-05-23T14:49:00.000Z	gray		and i launched it from /usr/sbin
2006-05-23T14:49:00.000Z	gray		i needed it to stop, so i coudl edit the conf file, so i did a killall ircd-hybrid
2006-05-23T14:50:00.000Z	gray		after that, I could never get it to work again, even after a reboot
2006-05-23T14:50:00.000Z	gray		i had to uninstal (via synaptic) and reinstall, and the ircd-hybrid works
2006-05-23T14:50:00.000Z	gray		well, then i noticed that there are two of them on my machine, one at /usr/sbin/ and one at /etc/init.d/
2006-05-23T14:51:00.000Z	gray		and what I'm realizing is that the /etc/init.d/ is a type of ... interface to the service?
2006-05-23T14:51:00.000Z	gray		but not the binary itself
2006-05-23T14:51:00.000Z	gray		i was hoping someone could explain that to me
2006-05-23T14:51:00.000Z	amphi	gray	it's the init (boot) script, which you should probably use to start/stop/etc it
2006-05-23T14:52:00.000Z	gray		ok, so if I didn't use init.d to stop it, but instead just killed it
2006-05-23T14:52:00.000Z	gray		is that bad?  i found that if i do that with a deamon, i can't ever get it to work again
2006-05-23T14:52:00.000Z	amphi	gray	there might be a stray lock or pid file preventing it starting
2006-05-23T14:52:00.000Z	gray		even after a reboot?
2006-05-23T14:52:00.000Z	gray		and how can i resolve a stray lock or pid file?
2006-05-23T14:53:00.000Z	amphi	gray	could be - have a look in /var/lock and /var/run - it should also have a log in /var/log, I presume
2006-05-23T14:53:00.000Z	gray	amphi	yes, it does
2006-05-23T14:54:00.000Z	amphi	gray	might be worth looking at that after /etc/init.d/foo start fails
2006-05-23T14:55:00.000Z	gray	amphi	also, how can i see a list of the daemons currently running on my system? it might help my debugging
2006-05-23T14:56:00.000Z	amphi	gray	sudo netstat -plunt will show you what's listening on what ports
2006-05-23T14:57:00.000Z	gray	amphi	wow, you are awesome.  Thanks!
