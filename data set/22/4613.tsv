2007-11-27T23:39:00.000Z	LiquidGhost		So, odd problem, I installed the new fglrx (and the one before that) using Envy (and any other possible means I could track down on ubuntuforums / wiki), but I can't get DRI to work. No failure reported in the XOrg log, just glxinfo reports "Direct Rendering: No". The fglrx kernel module is loaded. When I remove these drivers and install the older fglrx in the Feisty (AMD64) repo, then I get DRI. Anyone had this problem before?
2007-11-27T23:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Envy is a terrible thig to do to your computer and it is not supported in here
2007-11-27T23:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Have you reinstalled since you tried it..?
2007-11-27T23:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	your operating system..
2007-11-27T23:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	We cant just forget it... that is where the problem started
2007-11-27T23:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	It has to do with proper video driver and monitor setup.
2007-11-27T23:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	ONce you use envy or automatix I cant help until you reinstall.. It is a waste of my time
2007-11-27T23:44:00.000Z	LiquidGhost	Jack_Sparrow	or you could just maybe think of what might cause the problem
2007-11-27T23:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	You did not get your video AND monitor setup correctly in the beginning.  Most people forget they need to setup the monitor sync rates and keep messing with video drivers
2007-11-27T23:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	They get lazy and try scripots that dont work many times...  then they want to find the right way to do it.
2007-11-27T23:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Once you go outside the repos using the scripts it messes up oter things down thew road..
2007-11-27T23:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Read that link about some of what those scripts do.
2007-11-27T23:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	It is relevant...  no matter what you say...
2007-11-27T23:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	I already did...
2007-11-27T23:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Did you ever setup your monitor info in your xorg?
2007-11-27T23:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Post it to the pastebin
2007-11-27T23:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	So you dont listen ...
2007-11-27T23:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Again, if you seem to know so much and it dosent work why not listen to what we tell you
2007-11-27T23:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	we link res and tell people how to set things up.. yet they dont read...
2007-11-27T23:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	We link pages about how bad scripts are, yet they wont read..
2007-11-27T23:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	Do we need to say AGAIN, that you used Envy.  something that changes your system in ways that are not easy to fix and cause horrible problems..  So please read that to mean   NOT recommended or supported.
2007-11-28T00:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LiquidGhost	aptitude
