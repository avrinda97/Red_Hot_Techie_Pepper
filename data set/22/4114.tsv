2008-03-12T09:59:00.000Z	sexy__		does anyone have problems with custom cursors only working over firefox?
2008-03-12T10:00:00.000Z	sexy__		i have custom cursors from gnome-look.org but they only become visible when i hover my mouse over firefox
2008-03-12T10:00:00.000Z	sexy__		and thats almost all my cursors act that way
2008-03-12T10:01:00.000Z	Black_Magic	sexy__	I have the same exact problem...try using FailSafe gnome for a sec and see if it stays the same color
2008-03-12T10:01:00.000Z	sexy__	Black_Magic	how do i do that?
2008-03-12T10:01:00.000Z	Black_Magic	sexy__	i dont seem to have that problem with AIGLX i think its regular gnome and xgl gnome mixing together...
2008-03-12T10:02:00.000Z	Black_Magic	sexy__	Well when you login choose session then failsafe gnome then login like regular
2008-03-12T10:02:00.000Z	sexy__	Black_Magic	im using compiz
2008-03-12T10:03:00.000Z	Black_Magic	sexy__	yea that what i was meaning if it works with out compiz enabled its just gnome and compiz mixing failsafe turns off any scripts that usualy start that are added on like compiz
2008-03-12T10:04:00.000Z	sexy__	Black_Magic	i see i hope compiz and gnome become more friendly with one another so that one could enjoy the beauty of having good quality customization of there gui
2008-03-12T10:05:00.000Z	Black_Magic	sexy__	lol i loves it too failsafe after using compiz isnt exactly heaven you know? so i just customized the gnome panels with a nice sky picture so it looks nice and added some cool backup themes for metacy ;)
2008-03-12T10:07:00.000Z	sexy__	Black_Magic	lol i know i know but hey its still a developing process in the future i think everyones gonna use ubuntu just for the fact of how u can make it look how u want well at least ill be using it for that plus the great benefits of linux but yeah i turned off compiz set the theme to none and the curosor works 100%
2008-03-12T10:08:00.000Z	Black_Magic	sexy__	i never seen so many needed programs and things that are so small im used to downloading like 1GIG to get something like a Kernal for windows or something or like 500MB just for one program... things like that it surprizes me that an update of 350 programs was only about 200MB..
2008-03-12T10:11:00.000Z	sexy__	Black_Magic	yeah its amazing, thats the beauty of this distro, things install fast and easy i love it.  this updates like nothing, its so light and easy on ur pc unlike vista or windows thats just eats up your system.. this actually is the REAL WAY of updating an OS were it makes ur system feel faster unlike vista etc
2008-03-12T10:11:00.000Z	Black_Magic	sexy__	Mmhmm ;)
