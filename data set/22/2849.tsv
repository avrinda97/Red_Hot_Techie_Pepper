2010-09-11T08:17:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	ok
2010-09-11T08:19:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	installed ircd now how to start the program. not in the menu
2010-09-11T08:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 now you need to read the docs for  the irc server you installed.. they dont have icons, since they dont have an actual GUI.
2010-09-11T08:20:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	ok
2010-09-11T08:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 you may want to read up on 'irc basics'   and learn the core irc related commands.
2010-09-11T08:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 if you have an irc server running on local machine. you can connect to it with '/server localhost'  command in most irc clients
2010-09-11T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 the old way of getting a channel listing is rather outdated. on a server with 10000+ channels.. a /list often can flood off a client. So one rarely uses /list any more
2010-09-11T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 connect your client to freenode here and try a /list and see what happens
2010-09-11T08:38:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	it lists all the channels
2010-09-11T08:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 so it works..
2010-09-11T08:39:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	ok
2010-09-11T10:23:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	that is not working.
2010-09-11T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 assume people on IRC have the attention span of a Goldfish... whats not working...
2010-09-11T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 if its a normal service.. use the service command
2010-09-11T10:24:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	cannot restart ircd-hybrid
2010-09-11T10:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 and whats the exact command line you used?
2010-09-11T10:26:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	sudo service hybrid-ircd restart
2010-09-11T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 perhaps its not called ircd-hybrid,
2010-09-11T10:28:00.000Z	intmed	Dr_Willis	how to get the list of currently running services
2010-09-11T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 the service command has options for that.
2010-09-11T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intmed	 service --help
