2005-06-21T15:10:00.000Z	tola	ivoks	would you run ubuntu universe packages on a production server, relying on universe security updates?
2005-06-21T15:10:00.000Z	tola	ivoks	I'm talking about very common packages like php4-mysql, phpmyadmin and possibly drupal
2005-06-21T15:11:00.000Z	ivoks	tola	yes
2005-06-21T15:11:00.000Z	ivoks	tola	i allready have 5 production servers on ubuntu

2005-06-21T15:13:00.000Z	tola	ivoks	ok so the hoary universe is more stable than say Debian Testing?
2005-06-21T15:14:00.000Z	ivoks	tola	yes
2005-06-21T15:14:00.000Z	tola	ivoks	on ALL charges

2005-06-21T15:20:00.000Z	tola	ivoks	thanks for the advice, I feel a lot happier about using universe now I actually understand how it works. I should have read the web site properly.
2005-06-21T15:21:00.000Z	ivoks	tola	universe developers/maintainers are at #ubuntu-motu and #debian :)
