2005-04-15T16:31:00.000Z	queuetue		Anyone?  How do I do a network install from a standard install CD?
2005-04-15T16:32:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	I don't believe you can. Is there any particular reason you're looking to?
2005-04-15T16:33:00.000Z	queuetue	Arnia	Yes, I have a system with a failing cd-rom drive.  It will boot,but complete installation.  No floppy.
2005-04-15T16:34:00.000Z	queuetue	Arnia	Is there a way to do a network install?  I may have asked the question wrong. :)
2005-04-15T16:34:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	I don't think you can actually...
2005-04-15T16:34:00.000Z	queuetue	Arnia	Just ot be sure: there is no network install for ubuntu?
2005-04-15T16:53:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	I believe the answer is 'no' if you want support, and 'yes' if you like the possibility of pain and suffering :)
2005-04-15T16:54:00.000Z	queuetue	Arnia	What i would like is the possibility of ubuntu on this box, but I'm quickly getting the imporession that today isn't the day to be asking. :)
2005-04-15T16:55:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	The answer won't change another day. Its possible (and we've described how), but it isn't supported and you perform the task at your own risk
2005-04-15T16:55:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	There is NOT an Ubuntu network installer at this moment in time
2005-04-15T16:58:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	That is all you do... you install debian over the network, then you change the /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the hoary repositories rather than the deb ones... then you distupgrade
2005-04-15T05:02:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	And if you're already doing that, then why are you being so dismissive of the channel's help?
2005-04-15T05:03:00.000Z	queuetue	Arnia	What's the reponmse I should give so you and tritium no longer feel dismissed, so I can get on with my day?
2005-04-15T05:04:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	"Thank you for your help, I will try that now" Then we'd say "No problem, come back if you have any other questions"
2005-04-15T05:05:00.000Z	queuetue	Arnia	Thank you for your help, I will try that now.
2005-04-15T05:06:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	No problem, please come back later and ask any questions you may have.
2005-04-21T05:36:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	I plugged my printer in and it was detected and configured perfectly, automatically
2005-04-21T05:36:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	I installed Ubuntu and my soundcard was configured perfectly and automatically :)
2005-04-21T06:43:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	I was talking to you in private conversation because I was being polite. I felt you were being more hostile than was warranted but I didn't want my comments to reflect unnecessarily badly on you here.
2005-04-21T06:50:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	I am neither
2005-04-23T06:05:00.000Z	Arnia	queuetue	Terminal sudo esd -k && esd should do it
2005-04-23T06:28:00.000Z	queuetue	Arnia	THanks, btw.
