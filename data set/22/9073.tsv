2005-03-16T13:47:00.000Z	cwillu		I might have just done a evil cross of the two, plus other random stuff
2005-03-16T13:47:00.000Z	cwillu		you have no idea :p
2005-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	cwillu		I'm not supposed to have three menus across the bottom, am I?
2005-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	cwillu		(desktop)
2005-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	cwillu		applications, places and system
2005-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	cwillu		i.e., the results of my hybrid upgrade
2005-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	cwillu		okay, this is good
2005-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	cwillu		I had a beatrix install that did that;  actually this explains a lot
2005-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	cwillu		heh
2005-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	cwillu		I don't like top menus;  I forgot I changed it
2005-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	cwillu	you can always find out your distro by various different commands/files... cat /etc/issue is probably the easiest.
2005-03-16T16:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	cwillu	though you can of course use both
2006-06-21T15:42:00.000Z	cwillu	apokryphos	type that in here
2006-06-21T15:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	cwillu	he does, yes.
2006-06-21T15:44:00.000Z	cwillu	apokryphos	okay;  ubotu wasn't feeling well this morning, so I wasn't sure :)
2006-06-21T15:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	cwillu	there's been a transition; he's a different bot, now :)
2006-07-07T14:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	cwillu	no, you'll need quite a bit more than that for /
2006-07-07T14:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	cwillu	even if a default install is around that size.
2006-07-07T14:38:00.000Z	cwillu	apokryphos	that's the size of that drive
2006-07-07T14:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	cwillu	how much space do you have?
2006-07-07T14:39:00.000Z	cwillu	apokryphos	that much on the one drive, and 1.3 on the second drive
2006-07-07T14:39:00.000Z	cwillu	apokryphos	I'm hoping to have network boots to replace this right away anyway
