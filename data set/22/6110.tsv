2006-12-21T12:10:00.000Z	asusathlon		can someone please tell me where i can find the log to figure out why my xdvdshrink is quitting unexpectedly?
2006-12-21T12:11:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	have you tried invoking it from the command line?
2006-12-21T12:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	-- at a terminal -- xdvd<TAB>
2006-12-21T12:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	<TAB> means press the TAB key eh -- not type it all out like that :)
2006-12-21T12:14:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	you might find some info in -- gnome-system-log
2006-12-21T12:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	it should work regardless
2006-12-21T12:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	what you could try doing is reinstalling xdvdshrink
2006-12-21T12:25:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	ahh, you aliened -- thats the problem
2006-12-21T12:25:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	please compile it from source to make sure its stable
2006-12-21T12:26:00.000Z	asusathlon	un_operateur	i believe that is beyond my capability
2006-12-21T12:26:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	 its quite easy if you just give it a go -- its definitely not rocket science :)
2006-12-21T12:27:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	download the source package -- i'll guide you through it
2006-12-21T12:31:00.000Z	asusathlon	un_operateur	can i pm you?
2006-12-21T12:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	you may -- but I prefer if we do it here -- that way other people can interact, help, learn, etc
2006-12-21T12:32:00.000Z	asusathlon	un_operateur	ok i downloaded and extracted the src
2006-12-21T12:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	are you at a command line?
2006-12-21T12:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	just before we go anywhere- - just looked at the xdvdshrink page on sourceforce -- it seems to me that the package is only available for mandrake
2006-12-21T12:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	can you confirm for me the name of the file you downloaded
2006-12-21T12:36:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	yea, thats a mandrake package -- :(  can i suggest you use dvd::rip -- it's quite popular and works
2006-12-21T12:37:00.000Z	asusathlon	un_operateur	ill give it atry but the last time i tried it their gui was very complex
2006-12-21T12:38:00.000Z	un_operateur	asusathlon	dont let it put you off -- once you figure out how to do it once or twice, it'll be as easy as cake the next times around
2006-12-21T12:39:00.000Z	asusathlon	un_operateur	thanks ill install it and play with it for a bit
