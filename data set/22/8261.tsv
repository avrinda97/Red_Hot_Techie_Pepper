2007-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	nomad111		hey all, how come when i play a video my monitor flashes off then on and starts the video
2007-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	nomad111		its getting annoying
2007-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	nomad111		this is under gutsy
2007-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	just when you fullscreen it?
2007-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	no windowed mode
2007-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	try turning off desktop effects
2007-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	but when i do fullscreen it happens a second time
2007-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	already off
2007-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	what video card?
2007-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	intel 945 gm
2007-10-19T12:56:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	if you run gstreamer-properties, and change the video mode to x11 nomc, does it still do it?
2007-10-19T12:56:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	i think i tried that earlier, ill give it another shot to make sure
2007-10-19T12:57:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	you shouldn't need to do it, but it'll be useful to know
2007-10-19T12:57:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	it still happens
2007-10-19T12:58:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	i should tell u i am using a laptop that is connected to an lcd screen
2007-10-19T12:58:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	that was (No Xv), right?
2007-10-19T12:58:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	yep
2007-10-19T12:59:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	i think the problem is that my laptop display does not turn off even when i close the lid
2007-10-19T12:59:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	the flashing makes me think xrandr is being used to change something when the video starts, but I don't really know
2007-10-19T13:00:00.000Z	nomad111	cwill1	i get the impression the new Screens and Graphics feature is causing some problems
2007-10-19T13:01:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	you could try installing the old xserver-xorg-video-i810 driver
2007-10-19T13:01:00.000Z	cwill1	nomad111	also, try searching launchpad for that
