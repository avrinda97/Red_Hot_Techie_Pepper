2006-07-23T05:21:00.000Z	bigfoot1		does anybody here (still) use XMMS?
2006-07-23T05:21:00.000Z	mandie26	bigfoot1	i use it, why?
2006-07-23T05:22:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mandie26	i'm just wondering if I should keep XMMS for tis computer's next owner. I installed XMMS in my hoary days, when I was a week old in Linux. I was being greedy and trying a lot of software. I don't want to confuse the new owner though, as she's going to be new to Ubuntu/Linux
2006-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1		confuse means overwhelm with too many choices in the menu
2006-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	mandie26	bigfoot1	i would suggest to put a winamp skin, so... no confusion, and looks familiar
2006-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mandie26	but isn't beep media player then what looks like winamp?
2006-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mandie26	how do you put a skin on anyway?
2006-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	mandie26	bigfoot1	 just put it on the skins folder under ~/.xmms/
2006-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mandie26	do you find xmms better than bmp?
2006-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	mandie26	bigfoot1	xmms is like a winamp clone
2006-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	mandie26	bigfoot1	for what i do with it... yes
2006-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mandie26	hmmm. maybe my friend will like rythymbox
2006-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	bigfoot1		i don't know. what do you think?
2006-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	bigfoot1		do you think former Winamp users will like Rythymbox? or at least find it as easy to use?
2006-07-23T05:25:00.000Z	mandie26		i tried so many players... but at the end, just for listening my music... i prefer xmms
2006-07-23T05:25:00.000Z	bigfoot1		where do i get the winamp skin?
2006-07-23T05:25:00.000Z	mandie26		with my multimedia keys.. is perfect
2006-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	bigfoot1		i have this program called GLAME in my Sound&Video menu. What is it?
2006-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	bigfoot1		Do i need it?
2006-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	mandie26	bigfoot1	u can use any CLASSIC winamp skin
2006-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	mandie26		form the winamp page
2006-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mandie26	ok
