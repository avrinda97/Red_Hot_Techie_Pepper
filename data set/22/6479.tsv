2006-10-15T06:42:00.000Z	Bladegash		Here's my problem: lately I've had a hard time logging onto SSH by remote. Sometimes the connect dies after giving pw, sometimes after displaying "last login" but before the prompt. Is this just SSH being unstable?
2006-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	Bladegash		Should I set up something like automatic restart of ssh in crontab, or will that not help, you think?
2006-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	Bladegash		I thought so as well... it's just annoying that my machine is on another continent and I'd need to ask a human being to look into it
2006-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	Bladegash		it worked fine at firsrt
2006-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	Bladegash		now the machine has been on nonstop for a month, so I don't know if this is a sign of it degenerating
2006-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	Bladegash		well, yea, I suppose I could change the port... but unfortunately, I'd need to be able to login successfully once :/
2006-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	Bladegash		I haven't looked at the logs lately, but I think it's not very likely that someone has discovered that port and is massively hammering at it
2006-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	Bladegash		I'm running apache on another port and that one is running fine
2006-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	Bladegash		well, I'm talking about the ssh daemon, possibly that one might need a kick once in a while
2006-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	sshd is typically extremely stable.
2006-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	brute-force dictionary attacks aren't all that uncommon
2006-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	which port is that?
2006-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	anyway, with a lot of automated attack tools now, if they do get in, you won't see the login attempt because your logs get changed.
2006-10-15T06:50:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	knockd
2006-10-15T06:50:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	the knockd I saw on sourceforge looks very easy to configure and run
2006-10-15T06:54:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	they time out on their own, typically.  Especially if you're getting a "connection closed by remote host" error or similar.
2006-10-15T06:55:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	what happens after that?
2006-10-15T06:56:00.000Z	Bladegash	kaot	well, it could be... I don't know, though, the connection shouldn't be THAT lagged
2006-10-15T06:56:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	so you just get no response or feedback at all, basically, you're saying?  It hangs rather than boots you?
2006-10-15T06:57:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	running anything else besides apache, bittorrent, and ssh?
2006-10-15T06:57:00.000Z	Bladegash	kaot	those are about it, no big server-thing
2006-10-15T07:01:00.000Z	kaot	Bladegash	man that's a bummer.
