2008-11-09T03:19:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	jrib	care to explain the scp command?
2008-11-09T03:16:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	vim :)
2008-11-09T03:16:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	jrib	whats the vim command to select all and copy?
2008-11-09T03:16:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	copy to where?
2008-11-09T03:17:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	jrib	well im SSH'ing into my VPS and i need to copy the entire eggdrop.conf to my computer some how
2008-11-09T03:18:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	you're doing it wrong.  Use scp
2008-11-09T03:20:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	scp jrib@ssh.jrib.net:~/foo .    would login to ssh.jrib.net as jrib and copy ~/foo to . locally
2008-11-12T02:59:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	jrib	im not familar with how to do that
2008-11-12T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	same way you symlink anything else: ln -s TARGET NAME
2008-11-12T03:00:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	ln -s TARGET NAME
2008-11-12T03:02:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	jrib	you're assumming i know anything about symlink command telling me "ln -s TARGET NAME" is not very clear instructions for a noob, The folder i want symlinked is /home/blah/.irssi and it needs to link to /media/disk-2/backup-irssi/
2008-11-12T03:02:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	can you guess what TARGET should be?
2008-11-12T03:04:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	jrib	yes but where would I type this command? I'm gonna assume i need to be in the /home/blah/.irssi directory and type in it a terminal ?
2008-11-12T03:04:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	doesn't matter where you type it if you use absolute paths
2008-11-12T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	you've written ln -s TARGET    now give the NAME
2008-11-12T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	NAME is the actual file that will be the symlink
2008-11-12T03:09:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	it is
2008-11-12T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	so you're just going to ignore me? :/
2008-11-12T03:12:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	you already had half of the command before. ln -s TARGET NAME.  TARGET is where the symlink will point to.  NAME is the location of the symlink.
2008-11-12T04:33:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	they are (until you delete them)
2008-11-12T04:34:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	good (this way you don't bug me every time you need a symlink see :P)
2008-11-15T08:01:00.000Z	jrib	LF|Irssi	you know about #ubuntu-offtopic right?  You should join :)
