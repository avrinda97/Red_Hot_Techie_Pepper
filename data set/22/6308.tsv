2007-01-30T16:01:00.000Z	dromer		hi, I'm tring to run firefox over putty (and xming), but I'm getting a notice that it's allready running. How can I turn it off? (I can't find it anywhere in top)
2007-01-30T16:01:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	'killall firefox-bin'
2007-01-30T16:04:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	consider ssh -C for speed
2007-01-30T16:07:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	can you explain?
2007-01-30T16:08:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	-C activates compression, which is useful for slow links. man ssh
2007-01-30T16:09:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	but, I'm not sure how to use it ..
2007-01-30T16:09:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	ssh -XC remotehost firefox
2007-01-30T16:09:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	I'm on a 100mbit network now anyway so I don't reallt need it (it's fast enough for me)
2007-01-30T16:10:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	I see. I use X forwarding via DSL, compression is great for that.
2007-01-30T16:10:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	ssh: remotehost: Name or service not known
2007-01-30T16:10:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	I thought it was obvious. You have to substitute remotehost with the actual name or IP of the remote host.
2007-01-30T16:11:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	hehe, sorry :#
2007-01-30T16:11:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	oh, you're on putty -- it's probably different then
2007-01-30T16:12:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	yes, I thought so
2007-01-30T16:12:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	ah well, it works fast enough for me :) (faster from my desktop than from my server anyway)
2007-01-30T16:14:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	to bad that, in putty, I need a new session for every application (afaik)
2007-01-30T16:17:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	you could also call a script on the remote host that opens all the applications you need: 'firefox & oowriter & vlc'
2007-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	dromer	soundray	or does > make it pm ?
2007-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	ye
2007-03-14T12:56:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	yes
2007-03-28T12:38:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	Spliffster: please don't use insert to create a user. Use GRANT
2007-03-28T12:40:00.000Z	soundray	dromer	there is something on the LAMP page about GRANT syntax
