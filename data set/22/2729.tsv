2009-08-06T02:03:00.000Z	guntbert	iceroot	I generally find fuser -m more useful than lsof for this purpose
2009-08-06T02:04:00.000Z	iceroot	guntbert	maybe, never used lsof or fuser, just seen in the help from ubottu :)

2010-03-05T01:42:00.000Z	guntbert	iceroot	exploits come under "potentially illegal activities" though
2010-03-05T01:42:00.000Z	iceroot	guntbert	hacking has nothing to do with exploits
2010-03-05T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	iceroot	don't want to discuss that - but if you read the original question ....
2010-03-05T01:44:00.000Z	iceroot	guntbert	no i have not read it
