2011-07-15T10:38:00.000Z	Defectz		hey, im currently in the setup of ubuntu server and its asking me to select which network interface i want to use, i have a wireless usb adapter that it detects but it requires software to use, is it still ok to use that one?
2011-07-15T10:38:00.000Z	Defectz		no
2011-07-15T10:39:00.000Z	Defectz		can i change to lan?
2011-07-15T10:39:00.000Z	Defectz		wired
2011-07-15T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	sure
2011-07-16T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	what is the output of:  lspci  grep -i vga
2011-07-16T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
2011-07-16T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	use your user password, there will be no feedback but just keep typing
2011-07-16T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	sudo apt-get install nvidia-current      nvidia isn't a package ;)
2011-07-16T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	that will be a windows driver
2011-07-16T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	is it a usb device?
2011-07-16T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	can you run:   lsusb     one line will identify the device, what is the 8 character hex ID of the device?
2011-07-16T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	it MAY be needed to run with ndisgtk but there may be a naive driver which will run better
2011-07-16T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	I already told you what to do..
2011-07-16T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	we need to check for a native driver first
2011-07-16T01:18:00.000Z	Defectz	ActionParsnip	so for that native driver what should i search for
2011-07-16T01:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	if you copy the 8 character hex ID and use it in websearches, you'll find guides. They may say it needs ndisgtk or there may be a method to install a native linux driver
2011-07-16T01:20:00.000Z	Defectz	ActionParsnip	what is the 8 charcter hex id
2011-07-16T01:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	e.g.
2011-07-16T01:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	0424:2228 is the hex ID here
2011-07-16T01:21:00.000Z	Defectz	ActionParsnip	 were do i check for tht hex id
2011-07-16T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Defectz	it's in teh output of: lsusb    like I said earlier
