2012-06-08T10:14:00.000Z	fleakite		Hi. Isn't the firewall available on Ubuntu 12.04?
2012-06-08T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 its in there.
2012-06-08T10:15:00.000Z	fleakite	Dr_Willis	I searched dashboard for "firewall" but no results
2012-06-08T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 its included.. with no rules by default.. so  its not doing anything by default
2012-06-08T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 why do you need the firewall?
2012-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 thers no services running  by default.. so theres nothing to  onnect to
2012-06-08T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 you are thinking of 'windows'
2012-06-08T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 i normally turn off my windows firewall :)
2012-06-08T10:20:00.000Z	fleakite	Dr_Willis	Wow. I'm scared to even attempt that
2012-06-08T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 MS has you trained to be scared.
2012-06-08T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 it should pas reguardless of what os youi are running.. if you got a router
2012-06-08T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 a firewall wont stop your windows box from running malwqre/viruses you download.. but it MIgHT keep it from infecting other pcs on your internal lan.  'might'
2012-06-08T10:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 every internet connection wont.. how aboyut  your routers connectoon? ;)
2012-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 put a pc ip in the DMZ on your router and  its open to the internet also..
2012-06-08T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 you dont really need anti virus software or to defrag your linux box either
2012-06-08T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 and rember that CASE is ImpOranT in linux
2012-06-11T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 normally its not a good idea to use  the tar.gz browser packages.
2012-06-11T09:36:00.000Z	fleakite	Dr_Willis	Noted :)  Any answers for my question?
2012-06-19T07:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	  at one time i reecall about 5 differnt wallpaper changer apps  that can do changes automatically. gnome has  a rotate wallpaper feature also if you make a proper .xml file to define for it to change what/when
2012-06-19T07:58:00.000Z	fleakite	Dr_Willis	Thanks  ..  I don't know how to make a xml file.  Is there a software that does it?
2012-06-19T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fleakite	 i recall some tool that could make the gnome scheduled change files. but that wouldent do random changes. just  schedules changres of a preset set of images
2012-06-19T07:59:00.000Z	fleakite	Dr_Willis	hmm .. remember the names  by any chance? :)
