2011-05-24T06:06:00.000Z	NictraSavios		But what about the configuation. Like th fact that on one, gdm dosent start on load. and the internet isnt connected automaticly
2011-05-24T06:06:00.000Z	NictraSavios		The network manager isnt even installed.
2011-05-24T06:06:00.000Z	NictraSavios		Could i copy the /etc from 10.04 (what its bassed on) and install the packages from it, would that work?
2011-05-24T06:07:00.000Z	NictraSavios		I dont know how to work Init.d, Only init experance i have it with rc.conf under Arch Linux
2011-05-24T06:08:00.000Z	NictraSavios		Any good documentation you recomend?
2011-05-24T06:08:00.000Z	cheezit	NictraSavios	why would you mess with BackTrack? it works perfectly
2011-05-24T06:08:00.000Z	NictraSavios		My full project is this. Take BT, restore it to a fully Functional desktop, Upgrade it to 10.10, then merge it into Linux Mint 11
2011-05-24T06:09:00.000Z	NictraSavios	cheezit	Because i have to use it as a desktop. Its annoying have 2 distros. One for work, One for personal.
2011-05-24T06:10:00.000Z	NictraSavios	cheezit	create a non root user, try and use it to watch a movie, graphical login. Try it, its not easy.
2011-05-24T06:10:00.000Z	cheezit	NictraSavios	useradd
2011-05-24T06:10:00.000Z	NictraSavios		Backtrack linux forums is helping me get it back to functional. One of the devs gave me a change log.
2011-05-24T06:11:00.000Z	cheezit	NictraSavios	change xinit to gdm or similar
2011-05-24T06:11:00.000Z	NictraSavios	cheezit	nah, bro, of course. Now what groups, what main group, setup gdm, oh did i mention the logout applet fails to load? The config cdosent work. They are all Ubuntu Questions
2011-05-24T06:11:00.000Z	NictraSavios		God dangit, read what i said please? after i have it useable, it is for all intensive purposes, 10.04 LTS.
2011-05-24T06:12:00.000Z	NictraSavios		So then it falls into this channel
2011-05-24T06:12:00.000Z	NictraSavios		Let me get to the heart of what Im asking without all the backround annoyance.
2011-05-24T06:13:00.000Z	NictraSavios		It will be, for all intesive purposes. Since the config and package list will be identacle. even the branding.
2011-05-24T06:13:00.000Z	NictraSavios		When im done, there will be no differance between what i have, and 10.04. So this is the place to ask it.
2011-05-24T06:14:00.000Z	NictraSavios		Intensive purposes. * I'm typing fast because i want this conversation to be short.
2011-05-24T06:14:00.000Z	NictraSavios		I cant. Then i will not be able to do any work on it.
2011-05-24T06:14:00.000Z	NictraSavios		Your asking pointless information. What you asking me is regardless because im asking about stuff AFTER that.
2011-05-24T06:14:00.000Z	cheezit	NictraSavios	if adding users and groups from the command line presents problems, you have bitten off more than you can chew
