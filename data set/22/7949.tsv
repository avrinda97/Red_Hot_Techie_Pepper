2006-01-06T16:14:00.000Z	meta		hey guys
2006-01-06T16:14:00.000Z	meta		i'm an ubuntu noob ... got a couple of q's
2006-01-06T16:15:00.000Z	polpak	meta	no meta questions pls.. Just ask your questions and someone will answer
2006-01-06T16:17:00.000Z	polpak	meta	system->administration->shared folders
2006-01-06T16:18:00.000Z	polpak	meta	it uses deb
2006-01-06T16:19:00.000Z	polpak	meta	apt is the repo manager, dpkg is the package manager
2006-01-07T12:44:00.000Z	polpak	meta	what is the problem?
2006-01-07T12:44:00.000Z	meta	polpak	can't start X  ... fresh breezy install ... ati9600agp.intel845.
2006-01-07T12:45:00.000Z	polpak	meta	have you tried installing the ati drivers?
2006-01-07T12:46:00.000Z	polpak	meta	and does it give an error, or ?
2006-01-07T12:47:00.000Z	polpak	meta	so you have both an onboard video card and an agp radeon?
2006-01-07T12:47:00.000Z	meta	polpak	yep.
2006-01-07T12:48:00.000Z	polpak	meta	and you've confirmed that the video isn't just going to the other card?
2006-01-07T12:50:00.000Z	polpak	meta	when it goes blank try plugging the monitor into the other port
2006-01-07T12:50:00.000Z	polpak	meta	i.e. the onboard one and see if the screen is there instead
2006-01-07T12:51:00.000Z	meta	polpak	... sry for the false alert .. there is no onboard video ... (my bad).
2006-01-07T12:53:00.000Z	polpak	meta	no, it shouldn't
2006-01-07T12:53:00.000Z	polpak	meta	but it wouldn't hurt
2006-01-07T12:53:00.000Z	polpak	meta	I'm curious to see your xorg.conf file though if you can pastebin it
2006-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	polpak	meta	My best suggestion would be to try installing the ati binary drivers\
2006-01-07T12:57:00.000Z	polpak	meta	But I've honestly had no trouble with my radeons using the default driver
2006-01-07T12:58:00.000Z	meta	polpak	i agree ... i c nothing to implicate the drivers ... also i c users reporting exactly the same symptoms on nv cards (install support forum) ... there is something else going on here ...
