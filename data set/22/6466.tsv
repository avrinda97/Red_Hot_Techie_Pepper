2009-04-07T23:54:00.000Z	barf		Which config file does line 3 of this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=3559043&postcount=2 make a change to?
2009-04-07T23:55:00.000Z	barf		or maybe cp
2009-04-07T23:56:00.000Z	barf		Then I do not know
2009-04-07T23:57:00.000Z	barf		I only know that HFS+ is readonly from linux, unless somebody made a discovery
2009-04-07T23:57:00.000Z	barf		Maybe run Tiger in VMWare?
2009-04-07T23:59:00.000Z	barf		But usually I just attach the HFS+ disks to a Mac and mount them over the LAN
2009-04-07T23:59:00.000Z	barf		or WAN if need be
2009-04-07T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	hfsa and hfs+ are read-write drivers in linux
2009-04-07T23:59:00.000Z	barf	erUSUL	but stable?
2009-04-08T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	dunno but this 20:57 < barf> I only know that HFS+ is readonly from linux, unless somebody made a discovery
2009-04-08T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	is not true as you worded it
2009-04-08T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	the kernel docs (kconfig help and bits under Documentation/filesystem/ do not make any warnings
2009-04-08T00:06:00.000Z	barf	erUSUL	Thatâ€™s the one :-)
2010-01-27T00:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	bs has nothing to do with aviable ram
2010-01-27T00:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	you should choose based on the io path
2010-01-27T00:14:00.000Z	barf	erUSUL	 how do I find that?
2010-01-27T00:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	not easily :) dd will work with any bs basically tweking it yields better performance lower cpu usage etc...
2010-01-27T00:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	for example a hard drive what to choose? based on the buffer ( 32 MiB in some models ) based on hardware sector ?
2010-01-27T00:16:00.000Z	barf	erUSUL	I am doing iso to memory stick
2010-01-27T00:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	just put 4k or something like that; you can even omit it
2010-01-27T00:18:00.000Z	barf	erUSUL	Thanks
2011-01-30T23:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	barf	sda
