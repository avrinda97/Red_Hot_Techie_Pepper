2006-11-23T11:05:00.000Z	jonah1980		hi guys i seem to have a broken external usb hardrive - been trying to format it/repartition it in ubuntu but it's not working - can anyone help me out. used qtparted to create new partition etc a few times and when remounted it comes up not full capacity and with a folder on it called lost+found - which was a folder that used to be on it before reformatting!
2006-11-23T11:06:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	lost+found is always added to an empty directory when you create a new file system.
2006-11-23T11:06:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	that's not an error, that's normal behavior
2006-11-23T11:06:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	really?
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	yes. on an ext2 or ext3 file system, always
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	ah weird, it's only a usb drive, i wanted to just completely blank it so i can back stuff up, it seems to have a few gig used up on nothing and this folder?
2006-11-23T11:07:00.000Z	sethk		the thing about not using webmin is political, and I wish people would stop confusing political with technical
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	"nothing in that folder" is of course normal.  it's for placing recovered files after an fsck
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	i didn't realise that, i figured if it's an external backup drive it'd have nothing on there
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	also, a few gigs are always used up by file system overhead
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	you can erase the lost+found directory but it won't buy you anything
2006-11-23T11:08:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	- so am i best using ext3? i was told that fat32 couldn't support the full 160gb on linux over usb
2006-11-23T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	the file system overhead is also normal.  It sounds, actually, as if you don't have a problem.
2006-11-23T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	you should never use fat unless you need to read/write from both linux and windows
2006-11-23T11:09:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	i don't need to use the drive with windows, but is it ok in 1 partition on ext3? cos on fat someone said it would have to be in two partition
2006-11-23T11:10:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	you mean because of the size?  the biggest I've done with ext3 is 120, but I don't know of a limitation like that.
2006-11-23T11:10:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	I would have to check.  in any event, definitely _don't_ use FAT, it has no permissions and is missing other important file system features.
2006-11-23T11:11:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	yeah the size - is there anyway i can check the limit or could you for me?
2006-11-23T11:11:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	let me take a look at the docs
2006-11-23T11:11:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	i don't wanna back stuff up and then get screwd over by it corrupting or something and it's not convenient in two partitions
2006-11-23T11:12:00.000Z	jonah1980	sethk	thanks a lot = you've been loads of help, appreciated
2006-11-23T11:12:00.000Z	sethk	jonah1980	as Kingsqueak said, the limit is way higher than 160 gig
