2007-03-10T14:26:00.000Z	t35t0r	lisapc	why don;'t you just download the iso from a site?
2007-03-10T14:26:00.000Z	lisapc	t35t0r	so we can download a torrent and at 95% it drops to 1.2Kb/s?
2007-03-10T14:27:00.000Z	lisapc	t35t0r	it offers torrent so I assumed it was faster
2007-03-10T14:27:00.000Z	lisapc	t35t0r	so it can take days to complete?  and what if the other users delete the file?  does that mean I can get to 99% and then lose the file?
