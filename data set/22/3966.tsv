2008-07-25T09:55:00.000Z	Scorp_		I am unable to access the wireless Router web-page which is set to 192.168.1.1 even after repeated attempts. What can I do ??? Its a problem with my Ubuntu laptop only. The page is accessible from Windows PCs otherwise...
2008-07-25T09:55:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	what brand of router
2008-07-25T09:55:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	Its a linksys router.
2008-07-25T09:56:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	open a terminal: ping 192.168.1.1 and then ping 4.2.2.2
2008-07-25T09:56:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	which works, which don't
2008-07-25T09:57:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	Both are pinging properly. 0 packet Loss...
2008-07-25T09:57:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	tracert 4.2.2.2       - what's your first hop
2008-07-25T09:58:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	192.168.1.1 and 4.2.2.2 both are pinging properly
2008-07-25T09:59:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	two things you can try http://192.168.1.1:81 and http://192.168.1.1:8080 and http://192.168.1.1:800
2008-07-25T10:00:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	the first hop is 192.168.1.1
2008-07-25T10:01:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	the first hop is 192.168.1.1
2008-07-25T10:01:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	try those links i gave you
2008-07-25T10:02:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	The :80 page loaded the title but not the rest. Could it also be because it extensively uses Java... Though i have java 6 installed..
2008-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	it might be a java issue, are you trying in firefox?
2008-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	The three pages dont work...
2008-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	Yes..
2008-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	 Its working even on my mobile's wireless... Dono y not on the system.. :(
2008-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	I'd see if it worked in lynx or opera and then complain to linksys/mozilla about it
2008-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	it could just be a whack bug, is the firmware up to date on the router?
2008-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	also make sure you're not running any addons in firefox when you're doing it, adblockers et al might prohibit certain functionality
2008-07-25T10:05:00.000Z	Scorp_	genewitch	Yes.. Hey, does opera work on ubuntu ???
2008-07-25T10:05:00.000Z	genewitch	Scorp_	my girlfriend uses opera on ubuntu 8.04
