2010-07-16T03:49:00.000Z	topobot		ok thanks
2010-07-16T03:50:00.000Z	topobot		look, i use macosx mainly but i got a freelance job, i live in berlin now, but i need to have full access to a machine in italy, which operating system do you recommend to install in the computer in italy?
2010-07-16T03:51:00.000Z	topobot		for having full remote access ?
2010-07-16T03:51:00.000Z	topobot		which are the differences between windows xp and ubuntu in terms of remote accesss?
2010-07-16T03:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	differnet clients
2010-07-16T03:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	and such
2010-07-16T03:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	differnet programs for doing it with
2010-07-16T03:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	however also SSH isn't a Windows thing, which can be used to make the connection secure, see what bot sent you
2010-07-16T03:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	depends
2010-07-16T03:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	Linux to Linux pretty easy, and securely.  Linux to Windows not as easy securely.  I mean if your doing your own connection, not using an already make service for it.
2010-07-16T03:55:00.000Z	topobot	sebsebseb	im talking about which computer should i connect in the computer in italy, here in my house i have macosx that is prrety the same as linux
2010-07-16T03:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	For that, there probably isn't really a best OS,  since differnet things that can be used, for differnet OS's for it.

2010-07-16T03:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	 Windows, Linux distrubtions, or Mac OS X, they can all remote connect to each other
2010-07-16T03:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	Flare183  well they say that Mac OS X is based on FreeBSD which is a Unix distribution not Linux
2010-07-16T03:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	Windows shoudn't really be connected to the Internet :D  since security reasons
2010-07-16T03:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	VNC is not secure by default,  it should be tunnelded over SSH or a VPN to make secure, when using over the Internet, if just connecting over a LAN then its ok
2010-07-16T03:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	as for RDP not sure about that one, but probably similar
2010-07-16T04:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	RDP is the way you would normally do it Windows to Windows, but RDP can also be used with other OS's.  VNC is more of a Linux/Unix thing, but can also be used with Windows,  and same thing for SSH.
2010-07-16T04:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	topobot	also there are websites you can use, so you don't have to set up your own connection
