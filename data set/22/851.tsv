2011-03-09T14:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp		I'm amazed that Ubuntu still doesn't have a USB stick image; that alone makes it one of the hardest distros to install
2011-03-09T14:13:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	i use usb-creator (from Ubuntu) and it works perfectly.
2011-03-09T14:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	right, but that still requires you to have a bootable functioning install with X and everything working
2011-03-09T14:16:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	Voita says he/she has an existing Ubuntu installation
2011-03-09T14:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	oh, fair enough then
2011-03-09T14:17:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	oh. you meant in general? for people without ubuntu?
2011-03-09T14:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	and I've just noticed it's been recently packaged for Arch too
2011-03-09T14:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	I don't get why you have to jump through the iso hoop at all
2011-03-09T14:18:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	i agree.
2011-03-09T14:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	does anyone use these funny shaving mirror things any more?
2011-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	shaving mirror?
2011-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	these funny round plastic things that people used to store data on, can't remember what they're called
2011-03-09T14:20:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	you bet. i work part time at staples.
2011-03-09T14:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	in all seriousness, I don't think I've had a CD drive in a PC for about ten years
2011-03-09T14:24:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	i work PT at Staples. we push spindle after spindle all year long. but yes, usb sticks are very popular. but people hardly buy external drives. i am sure a lot of them aren't getting backup done properly.
2011-03-09T14:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	I don't back up, I just keep my work in a git repo and periodically buy a new hard disk
2011-03-09T14:26:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	as long as you know you're safe.
2011-03-09T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	well, I back up large uncompressible media files, by dumping them out to other disks
2011-03-09T14:26:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	i have a couple of WD MyBooks for that ;)
2011-03-09T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	I've usually got a couple of copies floating about; the only time I've ever run afoul of this was when I lost one of my hosting providers and with it a large SVN repo - but someone else had a full checkout of it
2011-03-09T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	recognosco	so, Linus's method works
2011-03-09T14:28:00.000Z	recognosco	gordonjcp	later
