2005-08-27T14:38:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Are you the machine's owner?
2005-08-27T14:38:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	You can start with a live cd, mount your hard disk, then "chroot /<mountpoint>" to where it's mounted, and run "passwd <user>" to change it.
2005-08-27T14:39:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Any place you can mount the disk, normally debian/ubuntu provides an empty "/mnt" point you can use for these cases.
2005-08-27T14:40:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	So, let's say your System hard disk is hda1 for example...
2005-08-27T14:40:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	You boot with the live cd...
2005-08-27T14:40:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Mount the partition: "mount /dev/hda1 /mnt" this mounts it on /mnt
2005-08-27T14:41:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Then, you chroot into it, just for a short while: "chroot /mnt"
2005-08-27T14:41:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	And run passwd: "passwd <username>" and change it...
2005-08-27T14:42:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	If you only do that, you shouldn't... passwd changes users passwords... what you're doing here is using chroot which changes your current root dir from / to /mnt, so the system thinks it's runnign off the mounted hda1
2005-08-27T14:43:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Then you run passwd, the passwd that is in /mnt/sbin since /mnt is now your root... and it will change the /mnt/etc/shadow file changing the password for your user.
2005-08-27T14:43:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Once it's changed, you can type "exit" to leave the chroot and return to / as root... and you can then reboot.
2005-08-27T14:43:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	If you ran all this without the chroot you'd be altering /etc/shadow which is useless since it's copied from the live CD and not stored into anything but temporal memory. :)
2005-08-27T14:44:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	In some more advanced recovery setups, you'd need to redirect your device dir /dev from the cd to the mounted hda1, but this is not necesary here since you're not working directly with any devices for this... sorry if I'm confusing you.
2005-08-27T14:45:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Did you understand what I told or was I too obfuscate? sorry I am bad giving explanations sometimes.
2005-08-27T14:47:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	:/
2005-08-27T14:49:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Have you tested it in other systems? my advice with CDs and DVD burners: a) Check cables, old IDE cables can cause trouble.. b) Place the DVD manually in Master or Slave as is required, some DVD units fail to work if they're in Cable Select mode. c) Some motherboards are "broken" and will not use the CD/DVD well if you set it as Slave and there is no Master on the same IDE port.
2005-08-27T14:52:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Hmm then it should read, and ubuntu shipped CDs are pressed, which should make them safer, last longer, and less propense to be missread
2005-08-27T14:54:00.000Z	Lars_G	linlin	Do you have another Cd-rom you can try with temporarily?
2005-08-27T14:55:00.000Z	linlin	Lars_G	yeah thats what im in the process of now
