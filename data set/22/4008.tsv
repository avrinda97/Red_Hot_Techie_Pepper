2009-08-09T20:32:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	have you already checked in the system monitor how many getty proc's are running
2009-08-09T20:33:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	I tried to, but I don't see any so I'm guessing somehow I'm looking wrong
2009-08-09T20:33:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	make sure you display *all* proc's not just the ones you own
2009-08-09T20:34:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	Ah, there are 6 running
2009-08-09T20:36:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	ok, sou you have the getty procs running. Do you use some vga=XXX kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2009-08-09T20:37:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	there is one vga= line in menu.lst and it was 776 or something like that, I'll check\
2009-08-09T20:38:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	that might be a problem... framebuffer resolutions tend to break
2009-08-09T20:39:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	which ubuntu version is that, and what graphics chip do you have?
2009-08-09T20:41:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	9.04 with an nVidia graphics card, I think it may be related to the fact that I'm using the hardware drivers applet rather than installing them manually which I used to do
2009-08-09T20:43:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	i found my gt8600 not working with fb reso's larger than 800x600 ... I'd not use frambuffer or only soething like vga=0x303

2009-08-09T20:56:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	First off, thanks for all your help.  Reading up on the framebuffer I'm a little confused as to exactly what it is, it's how the virtual terminals work, right?  And if so would decreasing the size of it (which would lower the virtual terminal resolution, right?) fix my problem?
2009-08-09T20:58:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	i think it'S a bug in nvidias video bios... for some reason newer nvidia cards started acting funny with newer kernels
2009-08-09T20:59:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	I think I'll try disabling ubuntu's hardware graphics stuff and try installing the drivers manually again, if that doesn't work is there some other way I can kill a fullscreen application that's crashed?
2009-08-09T21:00:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	read the dontzap factoid... ctrl-alt-backspace for X restart (traditional)
2009-08-09T21:01:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	so  Alt+SysRq+K
2009-08-09T21:55:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	Well, I was able to manually install an nvidia driver (which is hard since i normally use the virtual terminals for that), but it didn't fix my problem as I'd hoped.  Now instead of having a blank screen with a blinking cursor, I just have a blank screen.
2009-08-09T21:56:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	try disabling all vga=xxx (fb-reso's) ...
2009-08-09T21:57:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	I'm starting to think that the vga=xxx line I saw might not do anything, it looks like it was commented out, though I'm not totally sure I unstand how menu.lst works.  The line was "## e.g. defoptions=vga=791 resume=/dev/hda5"
2009-08-09T21:59:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	the # means it's just a comment ... this is an example in menu.lst. check the real line further down
2009-08-09T22:00:00.000Z	javagamer	stefg	there is no real line then, that's the only place where vga appears in the entire file, does this mean I should add it in somewhere?
2009-08-09T22:39:00.000Z	stefg	javagamer	np ... so it seems your card actaully wants fb-reso's
