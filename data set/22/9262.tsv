2005-02-13T12:10:00.000Z	Fazer		Can anyone tell me why I get Kernel panics when I boot the live cd?
2005-02-13T12:10:00.000Z	toresbe	Fazer	what sort of kernel panics?
2005-02-13T12:11:00.000Z	Fazer	toresbe	failure to init or someting like that
2005-02-13T12:11:00.000Z	toresbe	Fazer	That's about as specific as "My washing machine is broken, plz help, what's wrong with it?"
2005-02-13T12:11:00.000Z	Fazer	toresbe	something to do with init
2005-02-13T12:11:00.000Z	toresbe	Fazer	Well, that could mean a lot of things
2005-02-13T12:12:00.000Z	Fazer	toresbe	this occurs when I am using the Live CD
2005-02-13T12:13:00.000Z	Fazer	toresbe	I don't know what else to say
2005-02-13T12:14:00.000Z	toresbe	Fazer	Tried not doing that?
