2007-08-17T13:25:00.000Z	DFM		Can anyone recommend an alternative to MS Exchange server? I need something that will do everything that exchange does.
2007-08-17T13:25:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	For free?
2007-08-17T13:25:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	try 'Zimbra'
2007-08-17T13:26:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	Version 5.0 will have a plugin for Evolution, to allow transparent calendaring and address book access too.
2007-08-17T13:27:00.000Z	DFM	cafuego	Well preferably free. I noticed Zimbra but it cost a bit.
2007-08-17T13:27:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	The open source edition is free - so you can at last try it out.
2007-08-17T13:28:00.000Z	DFM	cafuego	What will be the difference between the OS and Enterprise version? The support?
2007-08-17T13:28:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	The Enterprise version has support and includes automagic backups and probably a few more things I on't know about.
2007-08-17T13:29:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	I only have 2 mail accounts on it, so I don't think I have a need for the enterprise one :-)
2007-08-17T13:29:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	However, mine does authenticate against an eternal LDAP server, which is also used for samba, pam_ldap and radius auth.
2007-08-17T13:30:00.000Z	DFM	cafuego	True, this is for a friend in enterprise level IT and I think he has been tasked with replacing Exchange and reducingg if not eliminating cost.
2007-08-17T13:31:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	Enterprise level IT *needs* payware support, would be my guess. They could run a completely free system, but I doubt it's worth the risk to the organisation.
2007-08-17T13:31:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	I'm not 100% sure, but there might als be an outlook connector in the non-free versions
2007-08-17T13:32:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	So it would funtion as a drop-in replacement for exchange. of cours, it speaks webmail, pop and imap as well.
2007-08-17T13:32:00.000Z	DFM	cafuego	I agree and don't understand it myself. He just asked and said it had to replace exchange and operate with Outlook client
2007-08-17T13:33:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	Sounds like what he's after then. probbaly somehting that doesn't cost as much per-seat as exchange does. There's another one too, but I forget its name...
2007-08-17T13:34:00.000Z	DFM	cafuego	zimbra looks to be the answer but it will cost $3700 I think for 1000 seats and $5800 for unlimited, which to me seams like a bargain. Don't know why they want to eliminate cost in an enterprise environment.
2007-08-17T13:34:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	probably an idiot CIO ;-)
2007-08-17T13:35:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	Still, I'm pretty sure unlimited Exchange costs a wee bit more than $5800
2007-08-17T13:38:00.000Z	DFM	cafuego	I think you are right but I looked at it earlier, could have been something else that said unlimited was just under 6k which could have been per year.
2007-08-17T13:39:00.000Z	cafuego	DFM	$4000 -> Enables creating up to 50 storage groups, with a maximum of 50 databases per Mailbox server role (whatever tf that is)
2007-08-17T13:40:00.000Z	DFM	cafuego	I just noticed a price of 20k per year but I think that was for unlimited support
