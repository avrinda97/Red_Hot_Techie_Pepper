2009-10-05T01:32:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT		hi guys! what is, according to ur personal experiences, the best .cue .bin .iso auto-virtually-mounter? something like alchool120% was on win?
2009-10-05T01:32:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	so what exactly is your question, then?
2009-10-05T01:33:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	i need a tool that allows to have disc images that run directly on your hard drive, replacing physical discs and saving wear and tear on your CD-ROM drive, like Gmount does for .iso but also for .cue
2009-10-05T01:33:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	why .cue?
2009-10-05T01:33:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	isnt ISO enough?
2009-10-05T01:34:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	why do u care? :D
2009-10-05T01:34:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	prolly i have some .cue images that i need that tool for?
2009-10-05T01:34:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	Convert the .cue images to ISO then
2009-10-05T01:35:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	too much stress, its many of em, i dont get it, on win there is this marvellous tool Alchool120% which allows u to do some magic with cd images, nothing like this on linux? what about daemontools?
2009-10-05T01:36:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	I know Alcohol120%
2009-10-05T01:36:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	right
2009-10-05T01:36:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	I am afraid there is nothing like this and it is not that necesarry either
2009-10-05T01:37:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	alright so how do i do?
2009-10-05T01:37:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	you can use "bchunk" to convert .bin and .cue to ISO
2009-10-05T01:37:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	then it's easy to mount ISO
2009-10-05T01:38:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	something exists, its called Furius iso mounter, but it doesnt seem to handle cues
2009-10-05T01:38:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	it's not "furious" enough, perhaps
2009-10-05T01:39:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	haha, was that sarcasm? -_-
2009-10-05T01:40:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	but what is stopping you to convert .cue to .iso and live a a happy .cue-free life thereafter
2009-10-05T01:40:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	not all the .cue come out good if converted to .iso and lots of times they lose parts... got it?
2009-10-05T01:41:00.000Z	Mka	IpSe_DiXiT	mmm, I get you now.
2009-10-05T01:41:00.000Z	IpSe_DiXiT	Mka	kewl
