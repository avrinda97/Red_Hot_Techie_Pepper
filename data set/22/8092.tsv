2006-11-23T16:14:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	not entirely true (re ubuntu-desktop). the meta-packages are needed for dist-upgrade to track dependency changes
2006-11-23T16:17:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	that's only relevant on release upgrades, though. It would have been my next warning. Right now, Trixsey has not even quite followed the first argument ;)
2006-11-25T06:24:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	you're assuming facts not in evidence here
2006-11-25T06:24:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	can you be specific?
2006-11-25T06:25:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	you're assuming hda1, you're assuming ntfs, etc.
2006-11-25T06:26:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	you should either follow the entire conversation closely, or keep out of it.
2006-11-25T06:26:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	sorry
2006-11-25T09:08:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	never heard zydas - do they come in USB cards?
2006-11-25T09:09:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	those are usb-only
2006-11-25T09:10:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	have you got a make&model name handy?
2006-11-25T09:11:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	there are very many. around here, there's a $10 one from AirLink101. don't remember the model#
2006-11-25T09:12:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	thanks, I'll have a look
2006-11-25T09:12:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	fell into the trap of buying unsupported new hardware versions of previously supported nics twice...
2008-08-01T15:18:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	can't run a VNC server on it
2008-08-01T15:20:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	it's a headless machine, don't want to install any software on it.
2008-08-01T15:21:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	if it's headless, what do you care what its screen looks like?
2008-08-01T15:21:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	I don't
2008-08-01T15:21:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	when it appears idle, it will accept cluster jobs from a cycle-stealing framework, which slows down interactive performance
2008-08-01T15:22:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	oh. you want to renice things, then
2008-08-01T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	no, I want it to appear in use (which it actually is). Renice won't help, because those pesky cluster jobs have a massive memory footprint and make the machine swap
2008-08-01T15:24:00.000Z	sn9	soundray	what a masochistic machine...
2008-08-01T15:25:00.000Z	soundray	sn9	the whole network is setup like that. It's fine for desktops -- they unload their cluster jobs as soon as someone moves the mouse or hits a key.
