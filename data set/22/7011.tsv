2006-07-18T06:31:00.000Z	Cntryboy		Anyone know how to get my xwinwrap to show underneath my desktop icons instead of over them?
2006-07-18T06:32:00.000Z	lz1gjd	Cntryboy	xwinwrap -ni -argb -fs -s -st -sp -b -nf -- /usr/lib/xscreensaver/glmatrix -window-id WID -delay 10000 - but which option exactly was for background i don't remember
2006-07-18T06:32:00.000Z	Cntryboy		well I've tried -o 1
2006-07-18T06:32:00.000Z	Cntryboy		for opaque
2006-07-18T06:33:00.000Z	Cntryboy		didn't work
2006-07-18T06:34:00.000Z	Cntryboy	lz1gjd	btw I don't have glmatrix, I've tried installing rss-glx and that xscreensaver pak ect.
2006-07-18T06:34:00.000Z	lz1gjd		any xscreensaver using opengl should work
2006-07-18T06:34:00.000Z	Cntryboy		yah but i would like glmatrix though
2006-07-18T06:34:00.000Z	Cntryboy		matrixview I don't like I don't like cmatrix either
2006-07-18T06:34:00.000Z	Cntryboy		glmatrix is nice though
2006-07-18T06:36:00.000Z	lz1gjd	Cntryboy	maybe sending the file to you and placing it to /usr/lib/xscreensaver/ would work for you
2006-07-18T06:37:00.000Z	Cntryboy	lz1gjd	if you wouldn't mind
2006-07-18T06:38:00.000Z	Cntryboy		but i'm on 2.1KB :(
2006-07-18T06:38:00.000Z	lz1gjd	Cntryboy	you mean dial-up ? its a small file about 350KiB -> http://rapidshare.de/files/26129820/glmatrix.html here it is, hope it works for you
2006-07-18T06:39:00.000Z	Cntryboy		k thx
2006-07-18T06:39:00.000Z	Cntryboy		yes on dialup at 2.1KB
2006-07-18T06:39:00.000Z	lz1gjd	Cntryboy	maybe you'll have to make it executable by using chmod +x
2006-07-18T06:41:00.000Z	Cntryboy		kk
2006-07-18T06:42:00.000Z	lz1gjd		after installing latest compiz my decoration themes no longer work, could anyone tell me why ?
2006-07-18T06:42:00.000Z	Cntryboy	lz1gjd	I wonder if thats why none of my xscreensavers work when I want to just do regular screen savers? You think I need to chmod +x the dir xscreensavers?
2006-07-18T06:43:00.000Z	lz1gjd		nope, they should work without this
2006-07-18T06:47:00.000Z	Cntryboy	lz1gjd	it won't let me move it to /usr/lib/xscreensaver and i've even sudo chmod +x that dir
