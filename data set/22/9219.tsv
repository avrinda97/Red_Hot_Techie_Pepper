2005-06-18T16:02:00.000Z	Tuxicity		Help, I cant connect to www.google.com in Firefox.
2005-06-18T16:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	dns lookup timeout?
2005-06-18T16:04:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	I dont know. Everytime I try to connect to google.com, Firestarter blocks "Sun-RPC portmap"... What is this?
2005-06-18T16:18:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	what was that DNS stuff you were telling me?
2005-06-19T14:44:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	don't we all :)
2005-06-19T14:44:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	lol
2005-06-19T14:48:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	dns troubles?
2005-06-19T14:48:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	how can I fix that?
2005-06-19T14:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	well if it are dns problems, you should wait for your provider to fix it
2005-06-19T14:49:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	no no, other PCs on my LAN have no problems
2005-06-19T14:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	well then it probably isn't dns :)
2005-06-19T14:52:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	Google tries to make an inbound connection to my PC everytime I load google.com, and Firestarter blocks it
2005-06-20T16:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	possibly
2005-06-20T16:03:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	but the router (which is in the middle) is fine..
2005-06-20T16:03:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	weirder things have happened
2005-06-20T16:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	you can check the physical connection with: sudo mii-diag eth0
2005-06-20T16:19:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	it says "eth0: 100baseTX-FD, link OK" but I cant PING anything at all!
2005-06-20T16:24:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	do you have an ip address?
2005-06-20T16:25:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	well i defined it myself (static IP)
2005-06-20T16:25:00.000Z	Seveas	Tuxicity	and you cannot even ping your router?
2005-06-20T16:26:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	mii says "link OK"
2005-06-20T16:26:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Seveas	no I cant ping router or anything!
