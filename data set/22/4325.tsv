2008-03-22T14:45:00.000Z	XiXaQ		Has anyone else experienced problems with nVidia 7-series proprietary drivers since they updated the driver?
2008-03-22T14:46:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- what problems are you having?
2008-03-22T14:46:00.000Z	XiXaQ	danand	the system freezes.
2008-03-22T14:48:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- do you get error messages in your /var/log/kern.log? I get similar thing, albeit very rarely. I get cryptic errors in my logs.
2008-03-22T14:49:00.000Z	XiXaQ	danand	not that I can see. What kind of errors do you get?
2008-03-22T14:50:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- cryptic :) - wait one i'll dig and error out the old logs
2008-03-22T14:52:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- kernel: [ 5403.461755] NVRM: Xid (0001:00): 6, PE0002 126c ffe9e4df 0002effc ff74726f 00000000
2008-03-22T14:54:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- did a google search on that ... turns out a lot of people have been experiencing this. System all of a sudden freezes, but mouse _may_ still work; or everything gets _really_ choppy on the graphics front, then the system freezes after. Nothing seems to help but a hard reboot
2008-03-22T14:55:00.000Z	XiXaQ	danand	then I guess the best "solution" will be to do a clean install of gutsy and not install updates.. :(
2008-03-22T14:57:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- or not use NVidia's driver - switch to nv driver.... think there were some suggestions on the net ie workarounds. Check through your kern.logs first to see if your getting similar problems
2008-03-22T14:59:00.000Z	XiXaQ	danand	 yes, that might be a solution if only I could get a decent resolution. I've tried and tried again, but I cannot get higher resolution than 800x600.
2008-03-22T15:00:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- with the nv driver?
2008-03-22T15:00:00.000Z	XiXaQ	danand	yes.
2008-03-22T15:01:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- did you try setting the resolution with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg /
2008-03-22T15:02:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- typo - should have been a ?

2008-03-22T15:02:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- :)
2008-03-22T15:03:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- empty? you mean totally empty?
2008-03-22T15:03:00.000Z	XiXaQ	danand	no, not entirely. I'll show you..
2008-03-22T15:06:00.000Z	XiXaQ	danand	actually, I can't. When I use the propritary driver, xorg.conf is used properly. Perhaps I could use that as a base. I'm connected using nx now, so I cant check.. :(
2008-03-22T15:08:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- k
2008-03-22T15:11:00.000Z	danand	XiXaQ	- you might want to take a look at <http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=58498> Didnt help me, but its worth a look
