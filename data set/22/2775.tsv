2010-01-09T05:09:00.000Z	meanburrito920_		is it just me, or does ntfs fragment a lot more under linux than fat32?
2010-01-09T05:10:00.000Z	meanburrito920_		i want to have a windows compatible partition on my hard drive, would it be preferable to format it to ntfs or fat32?
2010-01-09T05:12:00.000Z	meanburrito920_		oooh i answered the wrong question
2010-01-09T05:13:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	Oh, I will look at it now
2010-01-09T05:09:00.000Z	meanburrito920_	X-Sleepy-X	sudo apt-get remove
2010-01-09T05:10:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	That simple, thought that only worked with .deb packages...
2010-01-09T05:10:00.000Z	meanburrito920_	X-Sleepy-X	apt-get uses .deb packages. it is a package manager. if you just install directly from the .deb, you cant use apt-get to uninstall
2010-01-09T05:10:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	what size of the partition are you going to use?
2010-01-09T05:11:00.000Z	meanburrito920_	X-Sleepy-X	well, its a 500 GB hdd, and i want to make 20 gigs of it a windows compatible partition
2010-01-09T05:11:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	but i'm going to install form source...
2010-01-09T05:11:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	I'd go for FAT32 since it's faster on smaller partitions...
2010-01-09T05:11:00.000Z	meanburrito920_	X-Sleepy-X	what/how are you trying to install
2010-01-09T05:12:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	despotify
2010-01-09T05:13:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	http://despotify.se/source-code/
2010-01-09T05:13:00.000Z	meanburrito920_	X-Sleepy-X	oops, i told you wrong. you have two options- 1. do it by hand, 2. the Makefile may have a uninstall option.
2010-01-09T05:13:00.000Z	meanburrito920_	X-Sleepy-X	but if you did sudo make install, it generally installs to /usr/local/bin
2010-01-09T05:13:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	before i install that is
2010-01-09T05:14:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	Ok
2010-01-09T05:14:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	it says INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr
2010-01-09T05:15:00.000Z	meanburrito920_	X-Sleepy-X	give it the install prefix ~/bin, and add ~/bin to your $PATH
2010-01-09T05:16:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	Thanks!
2010-01-09T05:23:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	meanburrito920_	If i use sudo checkinstall instead of sudo make install will i only create a deb package then or what?
