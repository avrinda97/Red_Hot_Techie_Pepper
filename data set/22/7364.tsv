2006-04-13T14:49:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		hello
2006-04-13T14:49:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		I was using the live CD on my PowerBook DL (1.67, 1440 x 960) and I wanted to install
2006-04-13T14:49:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		unfortunately, when I tried to install trough the alias on the desktop, it failed
2006-04-13T14:49:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		this is 6.06 Dapper Flight 5 PPC
2006-04-13T14:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Snow_Shelter	please join #ubuntu+1 for dapper
2006-04-13T14:50:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	gnomefreak	thanks
2006-06-08T06:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Snow_Shelter	search for libvorbis and you should see a -dev package with the name you are looking for its in there
2006-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	gnomefreak	I installed the package it found, but StepMania still isn't happy
2006-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	gnomefreak	do I have to run it in a chroot or something?

2006-07-08T08:22:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	gnomefreak	seems like a lot of worthless downloading, why can't he just go from warty to dapper?
