2008-06-26T07:50:00.000Z	afallenhope		anyone know where the aliasa are stored? like if I type alias maillog="tail -f /var/mail/mail.log" I can do that.. but it removes whhen I close the command window
2008-06-26T07:50:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	bash config files set it up
2008-06-26T07:51:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	 and where's that located
2008-06-26T07:52:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	~ and /etc
2008-06-26T07:52:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	you mean the .bashrc?
2008-06-26T07:52:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	that's only one of the many files
2008-08-08T05:41:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	with apt-get like any other package
2008-08-08T05:41:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	wtf? so apt-get remove build-dep wine?
2008-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	why would wine be a build-dev?
2008-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	because I had to patch it so I had to reinstall it
2008-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	that's no answer to my question
2008-08-08T05:43:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	because I had to type apt-get build-dep wine in order to patch / compile
2008-08-08T05:43:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	makes no sense. build deps are usually dev packages...
2008-08-08T05:43:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	which package has wine as build dep?
2008-08-08T05:45:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	IN ORDER TO GET A GAME TO WORK... I had to patch it for the animated cursors. THEREFORE...I downloaded wine tried to compile it... couldn't.. read the MANUAL.. said I had to do apt-get build-deb then it compiles.
2008-08-08T05:46:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	apt-get build-dep wine does not download wine, but the dependencies needed to build wine which are something different. but since you're caps lock is broken, I stop talking to you until you fix it. have a nice day
2008-08-08T05:46:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	I know. it's like you don't want to listen to what people say. I had to recompile it myself. in order to do that I had to "build-dep".
2008-08-08T05:47:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	please don't bother me anymore as I politely requested
2008-08-09T14:04:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	describe what you want to do better please
2008-08-09T14:05:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	I entered the following command so that I can compile wine. sudo apt-get build-dep wine how am I to remove the deps now that it's already installed.
2008-08-09T14:06:00.000Z	wols	afallenhope	check your dpkg.log and remove the files which are build-deps.
2008-08-09T14:07:00.000Z	afallenhope	wols	where is the log
