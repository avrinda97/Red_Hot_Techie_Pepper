2011-06-08T01:05:00.000Z	clakes		is there any safe to install a gnome shell session on ubuntu? it's appealing me more and more...
2011-06-08T01:05:00.000Z	clakes		*safe way
2011-06-08T01:06:00.000Z	clakes		hm.. thought so.. i tried to some time ago and i ended up messing it all quite a lot, ikonia
2011-06-08T01:07:00.000Z	iostream	clakes	get 10.10, it's the last working version of ubuntu
2011-06-08T01:07:00.000Z	clakes		i'm a gnome2 die-hard actually
2011-06-08T01:07:00.000Z	clakes		but yeah, ikonia ...i see the point, indeed
2011-06-08T01:08:00.000Z	clakes	iostream	what with 'get 10.10'?! last... (?!)
2011-06-08T01:08:00.000Z	iostream		which part did you not understand?
2011-06-08T01:08:00.000Z	clakes		i'm running 11.04 just fine, classic session, elegant gnome
2011-06-08T01:08:00.000Z	iostream		really?
2011-06-08T01:09:00.000Z	iostream		I tried it, and just about everything is broken
2011-06-08T01:09:00.000Z	iostream		the graphics failed when doing a dist-upgrade, too
2011-06-08T01:09:00.000Z	clakes	iostream	everything broken in natty?
2011-06-08T01:09:00.000Z	clakes		gosh
2011-06-08T01:10:00.000Z	clakes		well, people are having really varying experiences with 11.04 as far as i can see
2011-06-08T01:10:00.000Z	iostream	clakes	I'm probably switching to gentoo or something
2011-06-08T01:11:00.000Z	clakes		hm... can't say anything about gentoo, never digged that
2011-06-08T01:11:00.000Z	clakes		my natty's doing a good job
2011-06-08T01:11:00.000Z	iostream		good for you
2011-06-08T01:12:00.000Z	clakes	iostream	have you tried fedora by any chance?
2011-06-08T01:12:00.000Z	iostream	clakes	once, I think
2011-06-08T01:12:00.000Z	clakes	iostream	fedora 15 looks nice, but well, i've also heard people saying it sucks quite hard
