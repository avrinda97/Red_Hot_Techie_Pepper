2007-11-24T05:30:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	 me too I just got confused my commend was adressed to allenc
2007-11-24T05:31:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	np
2008-02-03T08:29:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	your question got me interested...I found this link which may help you...the example print filter is just a pass through...so maybe it will work for you? http://eloquence.marxmeier.com/sdb/html/1123683643.html
2008-02-03T08:30:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	thanks I'll check it out,
2008-02-03T08:32:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	did you check the link with the instructiosn I originaly had to setup my printer ?
2008-02-03T08:32:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	no, didn't see it
2008-02-03T08:32:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	here it is,  it does tell me what to do , I just have no idea how  http://openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=CalComp-Artisan_1023_penplotter
2008-02-03T08:42:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	been a long time since i installed unix printers without a print filter, normally that was done to send raw data to the printer. with cups, i think the way to do that is by setting up a filter which is a pass through, such as the one in the example supplied earlier. don't remember how to set the speed, will look
2008-02-03T08:43:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	no hurry,  shall I give you my email ? if you get a soluton  , this bit is way over my head
2008-02-03T08:43:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	yeah, you can pm it
2008-02-03T08:43:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	I realy appreciate it
2008-02-03T08:44:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	 earlier I figured out it might be similar to what I did to get efax working ,  seting up a newtork printer that was redirected to the modem , in this case a fake spooler that would send to the com1 port for the plotter
2008-02-03T08:46:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	makes sense...and i think this method should do something similar...i hope
2008-02-03T09:01:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	thanks for the trouble, I'm off to bed
2008-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	hi, are you plotting yet?
2008-02-13T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	 not yes,  I am investigating other avenues,    like generic printers with cpl  drivers,  cause I can't get a hpgl.plt flle out of progecad
2008-02-13T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	but the stuff you emailed me works perfectly ,  for what little I can do with it
2008-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	well, we both learned something...good luck getting your cad going
2008-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	Pelo	robdig	 when i do get it working I will email you about it , you were a great help
2008-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	robdig	Pelo	no prob
