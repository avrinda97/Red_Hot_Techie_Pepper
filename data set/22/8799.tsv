2005-05-21T06:26:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite		whenI run winetools... I get to the point where it's creating the fake_windows, and then proceeds to: "Invoking /usr/bin/wine rundll32.exe setupapi.dll,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 wine.inf ..." repeatedly, in an infinate loop
2005-05-21T06:28:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	are you using wine from universe or from winehq.com?
2005-05-21T06:28:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	universe
2005-05-21T06:28:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	winetools works with wine from winehq.com, but not the version in universe
2005-05-21T06:29:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	should I uninstall the one from universe and install the one in winehq?
2005-05-21T06:29:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	if you want to use winetools, hyes.
2005-05-21T06:45:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	"sudo aptitude install wine=0.0.20050310-1"
2005-05-21T06:52:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	did you do what I showed you?
2005-05-21T06:52:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	yes... and now winetools complains about files not existing, etc...
2005-05-21T06:53:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	you removed wine from universe (sudo aptitude purge wine), and then "sudo aptitude install wine=0.0.20050310-1"?
2005-05-21T06:53:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	I didn't see you say anything about purgeing... :P
2005-05-21T06:53:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	well, at least remove it
2005-05-21T06:56:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	ok, purged wine, then installed wine per the command you provided... anything special I should use to install winetools?
2005-05-21T06:56:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	or just "sudo apt-get install winetools"?
2005-05-21T06:57:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	sure, apt-get will work (I prefer aptitude)
2005-05-21T06:57:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	and, is there anything I need to run before winetools, once its installed?
2005-05-21T06:58:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	nope, just winetools, and step through the base setup, etc. in order.
2005-05-21T06:59:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	do I need to run winetools as sudo? it's now complaining about permissions...
2005-05-21T06:59:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	no...
2005-05-21T07:04:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	I don't know.  Not sure what could be causing that.
2005-05-21T07:08:00.000Z	TwoBitSprite	tritium	it's ok... I'm a pro at the linux install/mess-up/reinstall cycle :P
2005-05-21T07:08:00.000Z	tritium	TwoBitSprite	:)
