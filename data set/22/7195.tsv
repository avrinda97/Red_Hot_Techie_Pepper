2007-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	eternaljoy	Balachmar	computationally intensive is relative
2007-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	Balachmar	eternaljoy	that a p4 1.7 GHz would significantly slow down
2007-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	eternaljoy	Balachmar	not a p4 1.7
2007-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	eternaljoy	Balachmar	a billisecond
2007-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	Balachmar	eternaljoy	ok thanks, just thought that the installer was hanging a bit too lang, but it has proceeded already :)\
2007-05-27T16:17:00.000Z	eternaljoy	Balachmar	the installer should be fast!  where u get it from?
2007-05-27T16:17:00.000Z	Balachmar	eternaljoy	it is doing the calculations of the partitions, I got it from the ubuntu website a mirror at a university
2007-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	eternaljoy	Balachmar	using Ubuntu, the "installer" is apt-get downloading and then installing to HDD!  that speed has nothing to do with load times etc
2007-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	eternaljoy	Balachmar	you talking about VLC?
2007-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	Balachmar	eternaljoy	I am talking about the alternate install cd installation procedure :)
