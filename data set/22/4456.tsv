2008-01-13T06:38:00.000Z	Darkmystere	desertc	Well Not all of them like Caller ID And Off Hook I turned them up...
2008-01-13T06:38:00.000Z	desertc	Darkmystere	the link I sent you said to unmute everything and put it to 100%
2008-01-13T06:39:00.000Z	Darkmystere	desertc	nothing was muted everything was at max that could be changed
2008-01-13T06:40:00.000Z	desertc	Darkmystere	it's either muted or your speakers are problematic.  try a pair of headphones in the jack, if you think it isn't muted
2008-01-13T06:41:00.000Z	Darkmystere	desertc	well ive had sound before but i was using a diffrent kernal..
2008-01-13T06:43:00.000Z	desertc	Darkmystere	if the kernel messed it up, then you would not see the device, unless it was some very unusual sound card
2008-01-13T06:45:00.000Z	Darkmystere	desertc	Well as soon as i loaded that other kernal before the sound worked from the start..
2008-01-18T03:04:00.000Z	desertc	Darkmystere	I remember a week ago helping you with your sound issue.  You're still having problems?
2008-01-18T03:05:00.000Z	Darkmystere	desertc	Yep... And this is a new install cept i got rid of the wubi part lol i started to put my wubi install on the partion but i didnt want anything to do with it so i made a swap and 15GB partion..
2008-01-18T03:06:00.000Z	desertc	Darkmystere	Didn't you save the configuration you made when you got the sound working before
2008-01-18T03:06:00.000Z	Darkmystere	desertc	I install -rt and it fixed it once but doesnt work anymore
