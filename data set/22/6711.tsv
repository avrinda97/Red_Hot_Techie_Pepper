2006-10-07T12:17:00.000Z	mnepton		ok, i need the Big Blue Room. i'm living exactly 27 seconds behind wickedpuppy
2006-10-07T12:17:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	i am in singapore .. you should be closer than me
2006-10-11T12:30:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	how will that find out about the release ? curious
2006-10-11T12:30:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	kernel revision
2006-10-11T12:30:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	he wants to know the ubuntu version .. not kernel version ...
2006-10-11T12:31:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	the kernel revisions are not the same for all releases. if you tell me a kernel revision, i can tell you the release.
2006-10-11T12:32:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	well .. sure you can do that but why would you ? since there are direct ways to find out about the release version ... i am not saying you are wrong there ...
2006-10-11T12:33:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	i just like the uname method because it tells me both release and current kernel.
2006-10-11T12:33:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	ok ... :P
2006-10-12T13:53:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	hire a hooker?
2006-10-12T13:54:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	that would be a good choice .. unfortunately you cant hire one if your backup is screwed in real life ..
2006-10-12T14:10:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	boot to rescue mode or a lower runlevel
2006-10-12T14:10:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	or off a live cd, or ...
2006-10-12T14:10:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	true .. but i was thinking how he going to ask us for help if he can't use irc ?
2006-10-12T14:11:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	CLI clients exist for IRC (i'm using one) ;)
2006-10-12T14:11:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	irssi is installed by default
2006-10-12T14:12:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	honestly ... i be surprised if people can stand irssi in trouble .. especially for newbies
2006-10-12T14:13:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	thankfully not every user has such anger management issues ;)
2006-10-12T14:14:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	yah .. i myself is glad ... i havn't received any hatemails so far ..
2006-10-12T14:14:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	or you have an aggressive spam filter :D
2006-10-23T14:26:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mnepton	then how does he save the edited xorg on the cd ? can it be done ?
2006-10-23T14:27:00.000Z	mnepton	wickedpuppy	he saves it to the mounted file system
