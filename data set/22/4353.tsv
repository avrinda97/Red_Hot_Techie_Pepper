2012-02-28T14:49:00.000Z	pengw		hi all
2012-02-28T14:49:00.000Z	pengw		I have  a problem
2012-02-28T14:50:00.000Z	pengw		I try to install my ubuntu on a usb stick
2012-02-28T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	use unetbootin
2012-02-28T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	remember to MD5 test the ISO too
2012-03-10T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	did you MD5 test the ISO you put on the stick?
2012-03-10T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	oh its not ISO stuff :(, my bad
2012-03-10T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	when you last unplugged the stick did you safely remove the device or just yank it out?
2012-04-26T10:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	you'll see the motd change when it is
2012-06-15T04:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	can you pastebin all the text, it may be clearer, you can even use:  free -m \ pastebinit
2012-06-15T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	you have 8Gb ram and using 1.2Gb, you have 8Gb swap and using none
2012-06-15T04:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	the right most value on the 2nd line is your actual free ram (without the buffers)
2012-06-15T04:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	http://www.linuxatemyram.com/  explains it well
2012-06-28T10:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	grab the playdeb repo, lots of emulators there
2012-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	check plydeb
2012-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	I told you this earlier
2012-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	dgen is in the repos
2012-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	but gens is on playdeb
2012-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	http://www.playdeb.net/updates/ubuntu/12.04/?q=genesis
2012-06-28T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	like I said (3rd time now)....check playdeb
2012-06-28T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	you'll need to add the playdeb ppa before you can use those links, there is a deb to add it for you
2012-06-28T10:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pengw	but why did I have to tell you 3 times?
