2010-01-12T11:41:00.000Z	Dextronaught		ppl awake? I need some help on something really easy.
2010-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	Dextronaught		well
2010-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	Dextronaught		I need to connect to my vpn
2010-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	Dextronaught		I'm on ubuntu
2010-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	Dextronaught		it's not an option to add...?
2010-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	Dextronaught		like... top-right, I click configure VPNs or w/e
2010-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	Dextronaught		and... the Add tab is grey
2010-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	Dextronaught		I just installed ubuntu today, am I missing some drivers?
2010-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	Dextronaught		know any?
2010-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	Dextronaught		like, good names
2010-01-12T11:44:00.000Z	Seveas	Dextronaught	network-manager-openvpn and network-manager-vpnc for openvpn resp. cisco vpn
2010-01-12T11:44:00.000Z	Dextronaught		ok, 1 second, and ty btw
2010-01-12T11:45:00.000Z	Seveas	Dextronaught	if you have a different vpn (juniper crap for example), you're out of luck
2010-01-12T11:47:00.000Z	Dextronaught		uhh, Seveas, I pay for one from ipredator, those guys from piratebay
2010-01-12T11:47:00.000Z	Dextronaught		umm, Idk what you mean by network-manager
2010-01-12T11:47:00.000Z	Dextronaught		where's that?
2010-01-12T11:48:00.000Z	Seveas	Dextronaught	looks like pptp. Better google a howto for that. I haven't seen it before but it's definitely not handled by the plugins I mentioned.
2010-01-12T11:49:00.000Z	Dextronaught		ok, thanks Seveas
2010-01-12T11:49:00.000Z	Seveas		Q: Which protocols may I use to connect to Ipredator? Does protocols like OpenVPN or SSL connections work?
2010-01-12T11:49:00.000Z	Seveas		A: Currentley we only offer connections using the PPTP protocol. However, we are looking into offering additional protocols in the future.
2010-01-12T11:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Dextronaught	so it's pptp. there's network-manager-pptp I believe. It may work
2010-01-12T11:55:00.000Z	Dextronaught	Seveas	pardon my ignorance, where can I find network-manager-pptp? synaptic says it's already installed, but I cain't find it
