2009-03-06T09:32:00.000Z	coreyman		ok new problem here, anyone ever had to drag files of a NTFS windows OS, i am cd'd into the directory, and i see Documents and Settings
2009-03-06T09:32:00.000Z	coreyman		I cd into Documents and Settings and do a dir, and i see nothing
2009-03-06T09:32:00.000Z	coreyman		what's up with that
2009-03-06T09:32:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	If you're using Vista, you'll need to cd into Users, not Documents and Settings
2009-03-06T09:32:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	yes it is a vista install, ill try that
2009-03-06T09:41:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	i copied my documents folder to a directory in my ~ .... but none of the pictures copied over and i know there are pictures there in the My Pictures
2009-03-06T09:43:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	mabye not... lol
2009-03-06T09:43:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	again, you got the wrong folder. Vista puts a bunch of (it's equivalent of) symbolic links in a bunch of folders. You probably want c:\Users\Username\Documents
2009-03-06T09:44:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	there's also a Pictures folder in the same place as Documents. They might be there.
2009-03-06T09:44:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	i went to c:\users\username\documents
2009-03-06T09:45:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	im going to go boot into vista and check see where the files are actually at >.>
2009-03-06T09:45:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	good plan ;)
2009-03-06T09:52:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	ok so the files are actually in username/Pictures ....
2009-03-10T09:17:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	The first says whether or not filesystems need to be dumped, and is usually 0 these days. The second says whether (and in what order) to check filesystems during bootup, and should be 1 for internal Linux partitions.
2009-03-10T09:18:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	how come i can see /home in my /dev/sda4 and i dont know of ever creating a symbolic link
2009-03-10T09:20:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	I'm not sure what you're asking...
2009-03-10T09:21:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	ok, i just mounted /dev/sda4, i go to the directory it is mounted in, and i can see $username, and home and lost+found, why
2009-03-10T09:22:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	I assume because you either created a separate /home/ partition at some point, or put the folders there...
2009-03-10T09:24:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	... i just mounted it...
2009-03-10T09:24:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	this is the first time this has ever been mounted i didnt put anything there
2009-03-10T09:25:00.000Z	rww	coreyman	hrm, that's odd then. lost+found is supposed to be there (it's supposed to be on all ext2/3/4 partitions), but home isn't... Is there anything in there, or is it just an empty directory?
2009-03-10T09:26:00.000Z	coreyman	rww	home is empty
