2011-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	auro1		i just chmod'd alot of stuff 0777 by mistake
2011-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	auro1		is this bad?
2011-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	auro1		i was trying to chmod the current folder 0777
2011-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	auro1		but instead i was actually running it against /
2011-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	auro1		>.<
2011-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	auro1		so... is that bad?
2011-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	auro1		i just finished setting it up
2011-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	auro1		<.<
2011-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	auro1		(shit. sorry. did the enter-thing again)
2011-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	auro1		fuk.
2011-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	auro1	if it's a brand-new install, nuke it and start over. Simplest "fix".
2011-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	auro1		its not really "brand new"
2011-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	auro1		but pretty new
2011-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	auro1		like a month or something
2011-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	auro1		Is it dangerous if I ignore it?
2011-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	auro1	seriously, mind the Enter key. This channel is too busy to have one sentence take up six lines.
2011-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	auro1	Madpilot	Real sorry. Thanks for pointing it out.
2011-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	auro1	depending on what exactly you chmodded to 777 in /, stuff could well randomly stop working...
2011-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	auro1	Madpilot	JeffCBR: i think it only got somewhee in /var/
2011-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	auro1		i killed it as soon as i realised something was wrong. I guess i should really take a backup and nuke it tomorrow...
2011-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	auro1	backups are a good idea regardless. Which reminds me, I should burn some new backup DVDs. Months of unbacked-up photos and graphics...
2011-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	auro1	Madpilot	Damn thats not good :D
