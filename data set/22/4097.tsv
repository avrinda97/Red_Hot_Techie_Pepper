2008-03-19T03:45:00.000Z	zrajm		after doing "aptitude update" on two different machines I get different versions of the same program on doing install. Why is that?
2008-03-19T03:45:00.000Z	zrajm		how can I check which version of a package is the latest in ubuntu?
2008-03-19T03:45:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	What versions and of which program?
2008-03-19T03:46:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	git-core, versions 1.4.4.4 and 1.4.4.2
2008-03-19T03:47:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	Feisty has 1.4.4.2, not 1.4.4.4  do `apt-cache policy git-core` on the one with .4, see what repos it's using
2008-03-19T03:48:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	one machine runs feisty, the other etch
2008-03-19T03:48:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	etch = 1.4.4.2, etch = 1.4.4.4
2008-03-19T03:48:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	ah!  Well, that's your disrepency.  One is using Ubuntu feisty, and the other one is using debian etch.
2008-03-19T03:50:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	well according to the #git ppl both versions are ancient, how do I get up to speed?
2008-03-19T03:50:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	I already have done "aptitude update" on both machines
2008-03-19T03:50:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	Ubuntu freezes its versions of software (you stay with whatever version was released with feisty, except bugfixes), as does debian to some extent.  Thats why you don't have the latest versions.
2008-03-19T03:51:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	You can either use feisty-backports, or upgrade to Gutsy
2008-03-19T03:51:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	ohkay. isn't an upgrade likely to break a system that's heavily tweaked?
2008-03-19T03:52:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	Depends on how heavily, but with no additional information, sure.  backports might be your best bet then.
2008-03-19T03:52:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	what does "backports" mean exactly? That I run the latest version of one or two packages, but not the whole system?
2008-03-19T03:52:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	how do I do that? (links to docs?)
2008-03-19T03:53:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	yes.  People have taken the time to compile newer versions against the older libraries (in hardy).  Basically, the safest way is to manually odwnload the packages, and then install with gdebi.   http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=git&searchon=names&suite=feisty-backports&section=all
2008-03-19T03:54:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	although, alternatively, you can add the -backports source to your sources, and do it that way as well.
2008-03-19T03:54:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	would that force all packages to use backports, if I added it to sources?
2008-03-19T03:54:00.000Z	Flannel	zrajm	Not force, but that is the danger of doing so (updating to backports packages without realising), which is why we don't recommend it.
2008-03-19T03:55:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	gotcha. might be better off checking out the code in question directly from the git repos and building it from source.
2008-03-19T03:55:00.000Z	zrajm	Flannel	thanx for the info though.
