2005-06-19T08:16:00.000Z	squinn		I've so gotta stick with Ubuntu.
2005-06-19T08:16:00.000Z	squinn		It's a PITA to install, but after that, smooth sailing.
2005-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	Linforcer	squinn	try installing gentoo.. (not that that's difficult.. but ubuntu is a breeze compared to it)
2005-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	squinn		well, kvidell, on a whole i'd say it's not
2005-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	squinn	Linforcer	I'm in Gentoo.
2005-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	Linforcer	squinn	then how's ubuntu hard? >.>
2005-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	squinn		well, i've got gentoo's install down pat
2005-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	squinn		i run a stage3, so i just partition, install system, install kernel, install bootloader
2005-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	Linforcer	squinn	yeah I guess it's what yer used to :P
2005-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	squinn		with ubuntu, the INSTALL itself is easy
2005-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	squinn		but
2005-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	squinn		only warty has prism2usb built in kernel -- the p2usb that will talk to my card
2005-06-19T08:19:00.000Z	squinn		so i've gotta install warty, change all sources to hoary and update
2005-06-19T08:19:00.000Z	Linforcer	squinn	yeah that a bitch.. it's things like that that are the reason I'm in the middle of a gentoo install
2005-06-19T08:20:00.000Z	Linforcer		I plan to stop using ubuntu when I've got a good gentoo running
2005-06-19T08:20:00.000Z	squinn	Linforcer	but Ubuntu gives me stability and freshness. Best NEW files with most stability.
2005-06-19T08:20:00.000Z	Linforcer	squinn	Gentoo is unstable?
2005-06-19T08:20:00.000Z	squinn	Linforcer	not necessarily.
2005-06-19T08:21:00.000Z	squinn	Linforcer	you've got to set package keywords to ~x86, which means unstable
2005-06-19T08:21:00.000Z	squinn	Linforcer	and those are UNSTABLE [aka Breezy]  packages
2005-06-19T08:22:00.000Z	Linforcer	squinn	ah. I see. maybe you should try arch linux.
2005-06-19T08:22:00.000Z	Linforcer	squinn	assuming you're not running an AMD64 somewhere
