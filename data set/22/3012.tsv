2009-01-17T13:24:00.000Z	Panarchy		I have been creating and recreating my linux distrbituion for quite some time now ,(well not compared to other distro's... maybe been working on it for 1-2 months), and I am about to recreate it from scratch (clean Ubuntu installation) for the 7th or 8th time.
2009-01-17T13:24:00.000Z	Panarchy		To make this as minimal as possible, I would like to remove everything from it, except for the following: GNOME, Ubuntu icons for GNOME, DPKG, Apt-Get (think the real name is Aptitude?), Network Capabilites (for access to internet), Generic Drivers, manpages (unless this can installed via apt-get) & the GNOME Terminal Emulator.
2009-01-17T13:24:00.000Z	Panarchy		Please tell me what to do in order to limit my Ubuntu installation in that way. Thanks.
2009-01-17T13:25:00.000Z	Panarchy		I Have also been recommended debootstrap in the past. Do you think it's a recommendation? If so, how do I implement it?
2009-01-17T13:25:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	It's different (Better IMO).
2009-01-17T13:26:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	Do any of these have a remove feature that will remove everything EXCEPT "*"
2009-01-17T13:26:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	Let me find you an image.
2009-01-17T13:26:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	Okay
2009-01-17T13:27:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	Be back in 30min.
2009-01-17T13:28:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	If I'm not here, please send it via PM
2009-01-17T13:51:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	Just keep a note of what apps you uninstalled.  Otherwise, if you were to start from the scratch, you wouldn't ask us in first place.
2009-01-17T13:52:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	The main problem I have with removing everything but those is the whole dependency thing
2009-01-17T13:53:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	Is this what you're looking for?  http://tomfichtner.de/linux/wiki/Home  -- If you don't like it... .then you know why (the dependencies).
2009-01-17T13:54:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	I have learned to live with it.  Uninstall everything as you humanly could... then enjoy the life. :)
2009-01-17T13:54:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	Seems very interesting... however it is not exactly what I am looking for. Seems more of a GNOME equivalent
2009-01-17T13:55:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	And if you really want minimal desktop, go with Gentoo.  Good luck.
2009-01-17T13:56:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	The main reason I'm going with ubuntu (other than the icons) is for GNOME, dpkg, apt-get and the other advantages gotten from being debian based. The reason I'm not using debian is because not all .deb works on debian, but all .deb's work on Ubuntu. Also the icons!
2009-01-17T13:56:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	I know you want the barebone Ubuntu with no packages.  The problem is that... packages and their dependencies is what made Ubuntu a Ubuntu.    If you were to remove something.... you're going to remove the dependencies (unintentionally, of course).
2009-01-17T13:56:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	Is there someway you can tell me that I can remove everything except what I want, them being: GNOME, Ubuntu icons for GNOME, DPKG, Apt-Get, Network Capabilites, Generic Drivers, manpages (unless this can installed via apt-get) & the GNOME Terminal Emulator.
2009-01-17T13:57:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	 You always could go for Ubuntu Server.  It had no GUI. Then from there.  You build from a scratch, sorta.
2009-01-17T13:59:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Panarchy	You have unbelievable lot of spaces.  Why bothering shaving off few MBS?
2009-01-17T14:00:00.000Z	Panarchy	jinja-sheep	The main reason is because I am writing my own distribution, and the more space I have for Rainbow Tables, the better
