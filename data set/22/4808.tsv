2008-01-02T07:08:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Hi all.. I've got a troublesome motherboard on my hands. I've had it for a while but never used it. It is a socket 478 800/533/400 (Pentium 4). It has a Pentium 4 3ghz/800 processor, 512mb PC2100 and an older AGP video card. I've tossed in several CPUs, ram and video cards and still when I power it up, nothing happens. Just the CPU fan and a flicker of hdd. Ideas?
2008-01-02T07:10:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	the only time I have seen this is with a dead battery, and a corrupt bios.
2008-01-02T07:10:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	I'll swap batts N see what'll happen .. thanks for an idea .. I was stoped cold ..
2008-01-02T07:11:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	also, set the jumper to clear a cmos password after u swap batteries...it can clear a minor coruption sometimes.
2008-01-02T07:13:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	roger .. will do .. New batt is in just need to jumper'it
2008-01-02T07:13:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	cool. lemme know if that does it...
2008-01-02T07:15:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	still zip .. Kbd binks, hd rattles a click, and the CPU fan whirs away .. I'm stumped .. I don't have a floppy drive around to see about flashing the bios (not to mention there is nothing on the hdd right now) ..
2008-01-02T07:16:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	oh my....gimme a few mins to roll it around....we are sure theres a good monitor, right?
2008-01-02T07:16:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	do u get any beeps?
2008-01-02T07:16:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	Yeah, it is the one that is normally my second (TwinView) and I just used it with another computer.
2008-01-02T07:17:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	No beeps .. there is a tinny green LED on the mobo that is on all the time ..
2008-01-02T07:19:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	sure sounds like a corrupt of failed bios to me. its the only thing i know of, except disconnecting the speaker :) that would cause your problem...and it thats the case, usually theres no way to fix it short of replacing the bios chip itself...
2008-01-02T07:19:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	Copy that .. What a bummer, its the only mobo I have that's got SATA .. lol (My junk is all old otherwise)
2008-01-02T07:20:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	is the bios socketed?
2008-01-02T07:21:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	Looks like it .. PhienixBios chip in a brown plastic looking socket ..
2008-01-02T07:23:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	then u may be able to pirate one from ebay, somebodys junk system, FreeCycle.... make sure its the same chipset and cpu specs, u may be ok. It's worth a try anyhow...
2008-01-02T07:23:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	you mind reader .. lol .. I'm Googeling around right now ..
2008-01-02T07:23:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	:D I also hade to dump good hardware....
2008-01-02T07:24:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	I can use this as an excuse to buy some new stuff .. My newest build is 2001 anyhow .. lol
2008-01-02T07:25:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	NineTeen67Comet	oh my..yes, do use it as an excuse! No one should have to go that long on the same technology! Isn't it unlawfull to force old hardware on another person?  hehe....
2008-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	about the old hardware thing .. I did get a new MacBook Pro 17" back in Feb last year.. But I don't count that since it is used by the wife more than me now .. (I installed Hardy Alpha 1 and it's been awesome) .. She's getting her new MacBook Pro 15" this Feb .. "THEN" I'm going hardware shopping.. I'd love a mobo w/SATA and PCIe ..
2008-01-02T07:40:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	WorkingOnWise	darn'it .. FreeCycle has no one over here in Okinawa .. lol
