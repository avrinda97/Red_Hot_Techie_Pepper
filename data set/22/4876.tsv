2007-09-25T05:04:00.000Z	murkyMurk	DjViper	you just select one using emerald theme manager gui under the berylmanager
2007-09-25T05:05:00.000Z	DjViper	murkyMurk	I should have added that I use compiz-fusion and xgl
2007-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	murkyMurk	DjViper	lol..yes, that would explain why you don't have beryl & emerald ;)
2007-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	DjViper	murkyMurk	hm okay, but I have emerald? what gives?
