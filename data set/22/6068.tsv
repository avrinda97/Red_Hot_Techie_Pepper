2007-08-30T16:29:00.000Z	Yodude		hey can someone please helpo me with my mobile phone ?
2007-08-30T16:29:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	I disagree, but it's adequate.
2007-08-30T16:30:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	i would prefer simplicity, but not on the ost of power, like Totem not being able to display DVD menus
2007-08-30T16:30:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	totem didn't even play DVD when i installed the codecs
2007-08-30T16:30:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	libdvdcss2 was nowhere to be found in the repos
2007-08-30T16:30:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	Well, totem is... Totem.
2007-08-30T16:32:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	but it really should, i mean cmon DVD's are essential on a computer. Ubuntu should be able to play thm ( in the default player i mean )
2007-08-30T16:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	Well, tell that to the law makers :/
2007-08-30T16:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	libdvdcss is illegal in the US for example
2007-08-30T16:33:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	really ?!
2007-08-30T16:33:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	dam
2007-08-30T16:34:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	anyway i'm happy playing my DVD's in VLC
2007-08-30T16:34:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	the important thing is that Ubuntu as a system can play them for u
2007-08-30T16:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	well, it can, but unfortunately it can't be made default behaviour :/
2007-08-30T16:36:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	hey btw even if i did install libdvdcss2, would I be able to see DVD menus in Totem, cuz i read somewhere that the whole totem library that does DVD menus is broke
2007-08-30T16:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	Well, then I suppose they should fix totem
2007-09-01T06:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	I think the error is in your server configuration instead.
2007-09-01T06:20:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	i think so too
2007-09-01T06:20:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	how can i fix it ?
2007-09-01T06:20:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	I'm not sure.
2007-09-01T06:20:00.000Z	Chousuke	Yodude	but it seems your server is treating the php file as plain text, instead of something it needs to execute with php
2007-09-01T06:21:00.000Z	Yodude	Chousuke	yes
