2008-08-22T00:26:00.000Z	kale		what i mean is, how do i get java to work in firefox?
2008-08-22T00:27:00.000Z	unop	kale	install the sun-java6-jre package
2008-08-22T00:27:00.000Z	kale	unop	would you happen to know what package i need for flash?
2008-08-22T00:28:00.000Z	unop	kale	flashplugin-nonfree
2008-08-22T00:28:00.000Z	kale	unop	ok, thanks
2008-08-22T00:34:00.000Z	kale	unop	ok, i instaled the java6 package, but firefox does not use it, how do i proced?
2008-08-22T00:34:00.000Z	unop	kale	did you restart firefox?
2008-08-22T00:34:00.000Z	kale	unop	yes
2008-08-22T00:35:00.000Z	unop	kale	navigate to about:plugins .. do you see java listed there?
2008-08-22T00:35:00.000Z	kale	unop	nope, flash works though
2008-08-22T00:36:00.000Z	kale	unop	i may need to make a symlink, but cannot remember which one to link from or to
2008-08-22T00:36:00.000Z	unop	kale	are you sure you installed sun-java6-jre ?
2008-08-22T00:36:00.000Z	kale	unop	yes
2008-08-22T00:37:00.000Z	unop	kale	and the firefox you have installed now was taken from the repos?
2008-08-22T00:37:00.000Z	kale	unop	yes
2008-08-22T00:37:00.000Z	kale	unop	only repo added is multiverse
2008-08-22T00:38:00.000Z	unop	kale	what does this return?   dpkg -l | grep -i sun-java6-jre
2008-08-22T00:38:00.000Z	kale	unop	ii  sun-java6-jre                              6-06-0ubuntu1
2008-08-22T00:41:00.000Z	unop	kale	not sure .. you might want to create a link to the libjavaplugin.so file in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2008-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	kale	unop	sun-java6-Ãƒplugin probably ...
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	kale	unop	yep, that was it, thank for the insights, im using gentoo myself, but this is for a newbee
