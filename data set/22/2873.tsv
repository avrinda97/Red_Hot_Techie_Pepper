2009-11-19T18:56:00.000Z	silidan		hi i need to give my user read and write acces to the usb file system (usbfs) how can i do this?
2009-11-19T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	use better mount options
2009-11-19T18:57:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	hm... it is the manual of virtualbox that states that... in order to use usb for the virtual machine... so im actually not sure what that means..
2009-11-19T18:57:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	i didnt ever mount my USB webcam or USB mouse though
2009-11-19T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	make sure the USB ports are activated in the virtualboxes settings. you will need to power off the vbox to edit
2009-11-19T18:58:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	yep they are added
2009-11-19T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	you don't mount mice, only block devices
2009-11-19T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	maybe you need the guest additions
2009-11-19T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	if you want access to your usb devices, you can cheat and simply add the folder the USB stick mounts to as a drive letter (guessing the vbox is windows)
2009-11-19T19:00:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	where can i get the Guest Additions? (i cant find them on the VirtualBox download page)
2009-11-19T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	in the virtualbox desktop window click   device -> guest additions (top bar of the desktop)
2009-11-19T19:02:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	ok will try

2009-11-19T19:07:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	well i installed the guestadditions... still greyed out the usb devices..
2009-11-19T19:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	do you mean in the config of the box, or in the guest OS itself?
2009-11-19T19:09:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	em... when the guest os is started there at bottom there are some buttons one of them is for usb stuff and with rightclick thats greyed out..
2009-11-19T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	have you asked in #vbox  ?
2009-11-19T19:10:00.000Z	silidan	ActionParsnip	not yet... but thanks for the hint will ask there
2011-07-14T21:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	oneiric will use unity2D instead of classic
2011-07-14T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	works fine here. Its largely ignored as i launch apps from guake and ALT+TAB between apps. My mouse rarely gets a lookin
2011-07-14T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	remember the target audience of Ubuntu
2011-07-14T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silidan	i always say if you know how to manually partition effectively then you should
