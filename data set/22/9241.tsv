2005-01-22T16:14:00.000Z	Necrosan		how the fuck do i force a laptop to use the acpi shit
2005-01-22T16:14:00.000Z	Necrosan		oh, was I a little too blunt? ;)
2005-01-22T16:14:00.000Z	Necrosan		I know it's an option appeneded to the boot line.
2005-01-22T16:14:00.000Z	Necrosan		But what is it?
2005-01-22T16:14:00.000Z	Necrosan		It said the bios is too old to use (pre-99), but windows used it properly
2005-01-22T16:15:00.000Z	Necrosan		so I assume that linux can use acpi safely
2005-01-22T16:16:00.000Z	Necrosan		acpi=on will force it, correct?
2005-01-22T16:16:00.000Z	Necrosan		okay, awesome
2005-01-22T16:16:00.000Z	Necrosan		also, how do I upgrade to alsa 1.07?
2005-01-22T16:16:00.000Z	Necrosan		is there a guide>
2005-01-22T16:17:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	as a caveat, you'll want a 2.6.10 kernel for decent acpi support
2005-01-22T16:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	my motherboard, for instance, refuses to work with acpi in any stable kernel prior to 2.6.10
2005-01-23T12:03:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	snd-cs4232?
2005-01-23T12:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	lsmod|grep ^snd_cs4232
2005-01-23T12:09:00.000Z	Necrosan	crimsun	can you hang on a sec? ill throw the laptop online and brb
2005-01-23T12:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	waiting...
2005-01-23T12:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	cat /proc/asound/cards, paste in #flood
2005-01-23T12:26:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	so ALSA's not loaded. What modules _are_ loaded? Paste to #flood.
2005-01-23T12:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	you have the OSS/Free kernel modules for your sound chipset loaded
2005-01-23T12:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	you need to get rid of those before ALSA will function properly
2005-01-23T12:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Necrosan	dpkg -l alsa-base|grep ^ii
2005-01-23T13:26:00.000Z	Necrosan	crimsun	it was being a prick, so i gave up for the night.. gotta be up in 5 hours.. ill toy with it tomorrow. thanks for the help
