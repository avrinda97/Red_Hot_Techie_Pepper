2010-01-24T06:20:00.000Z	detrix		I am still having problems getting an ASUS Eee netbook to boot off of a usb memory stick ( a SanDisk Cruzer), and the 1st partition is bootable.  I set the bios 1st device to removable media, 2nd device to San Cruzer, and 3rd the internal Drive.  Its seems to be trying to boot off of it, but I still get windows.  Any ideas?
2010-01-24T06:21:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	Did you ever boot from usb stick? Did it work?
2010-01-24T06:22:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	Booting from USB stick is completely different than booting an internal harddrive.
2010-01-24T06:23:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	use the usb-creator or UNetbootin (available for windows) for writing an ubuntu iso image to your usb stick.
2010-01-24T06:23:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	Both programms take care of making the stick bootable.
2010-01-24T06:24:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	The rest is to your BIOS -- different BIOSes use different methods, most work, but some fail.
2010-01-24T06:25:00.000Z	detrix	bankix	thanks.  I have a normal install onto an 8gig stick, not the install image.
2010-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	The normal grub installer won't boot your usb-drive installed ubuntu, sorry.
2010-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	grub installer / grub bootloader
2010-01-24T06:26:00.000Z	detrix	bankix	correct.  the usb stick has its own grub boot.
2010-01-24T06:27:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	yes, but installing grub to the MBR of your usb-disk won't help due it will never be used by the BIOS.
2010-01-24T06:28:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	I fear you only chance is to install grub somewhere on your harddisk so it gets started.
2010-01-24T06:28:00.000Z	detrix	bankix	I install it with my hard drives physically disconnected so the usb's mbr would be set up
2010-01-24T06:29:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	To be more verbose: When the BIOS boots an USB drive, it won't load the bootloader from the MBR.
2010-01-24T06:30:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	A solution is to install grub and the grub files in the MBR of your internal harddisk and on a partition on this disk (the filessystem doesn't matter much).
2010-01-24T06:31:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	Then grub could boot the system installed on your usb-disk without a fuss.
2010-01-24T06:54:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	Å´hat was the problem if I may ask?
2010-01-24T06:53:00.000Z	detrix	bankix	Hey, I got the full install mem stick to boot.  thanks for your help.
2010-01-24T06:55:00.000Z	detrix	bankix	pretty much a bios setting.  there is a boot priority, and then a setting for which drive is the first drive.
2010-01-24T06:55:00.000Z	bankix	detrix	That easy? Great!
2010-01-24T06:55:00.000Z	detrix	bankix	it was the latter option that was needed. to set the san cruzer to be the 1st drive
2010-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	detrix	bankix	 and that the removable media had higher priority.  ;)
