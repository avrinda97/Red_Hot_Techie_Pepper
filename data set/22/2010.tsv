2012-01-06T10:12:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	why /var ?
2012-01-06T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	its temporary guff, it changes a fair bit so putting it on a devcie without limited write cycles is good
2012-01-06T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	also moving browser cache to platter based storage (or even tempfs) can prolong life (tempfs will make the browser faster)
2012-01-06T10:14:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	just to be sure, platter -> normal magnetic disk?
2012-01-06T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	yes, conventional drives use disk platters
2012-01-06T10:18:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	do you know something about vino (the vnc server included with gnome) and its dependencies ?
2012-01-06T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	zero, I don't use vnc. I find it vulgar
2012-01-06T10:19:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	the idea is that it is included with gnome
2012-01-06T10:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	using vlc is realy OTT in most case. There are web UIs and suchlike which are sleeker and more secure
2012-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	they idea is to get it by ssh tunnel
2012-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	there is usually a way to just not use it.
2012-01-06T10:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	if you want to educate in a sandboxed OS, use a virtualbox :)
2012-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	ok, and about installation? I am trying to get my system installed in a very minimal way
2012-01-06T10:24:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	apt-cache rdepends vino
2012-01-06T10:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	minimal install exists, it installs bootloader, kernel and driver modules and app install commands like apt-get and so on, no x no apps no x server
2012-01-06T10:25:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	I did so, I installed also gdm and lightdm, configured an automatic login, so that it started a gnome-session
2012-01-06T10:32:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	when is it xdg supposed to run?
2012-01-22T23:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	boot livecd.and use the 'sticking it to grub' guide on omgubuntu
2012-01-22T23:47:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	no cds available
2012-01-22T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	txomon	usb? Sdcard?
2012-01-22T23:47:00.000Z	txomon	ActionParsnip	netboot
