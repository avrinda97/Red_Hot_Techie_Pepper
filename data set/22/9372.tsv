2004-12-09T13:44:00.000Z	pdaous1		perhaps
2004-12-09T13:44:00.000Z	pdaous1		any idea what package that's in? doesn't seem to be installed on mine
2004-12-09T13:45:00.000Z	pdaous1		okay, yeah, I feel like a boob....... I re-uploaded all the MP3 and OGG files to the computer (it's a jukebox server running MPD), tried playing the songs again, and -- voila! -- works perfectly.
2004-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	pdaous1		which kinda confuses me, because the files were exactly the same size on my comp as they were on the remote comp.
2004-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	pdaous1		but anyway, it's just another example of Nautilus BOTCHING ftp uploads.
2004-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	permission issue?
2004-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	not even; it's just Nautilus, I think
2004-12-09T13:46:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	in other news, use sftp/ssh connections, they're more secure?
2004-12-09T13:47:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	dunno, is it necessary? both computers are behind a router
2004-12-09T13:47:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	still... I don't have ftp anywhere..
2004-12-09T13:47:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	I just use ssh
2004-12-09T13:48:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	but you use sftp as an alternative?
2004-12-09T13:48:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	dumb question, and maybe I should just go 'man proftpd', but can ProFTP tunnel its goodness over SSH?
2004-12-09T13:48:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	probably not
2004-12-09T13:50:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	or maybe it can, but that's not sftp...
2004-12-09T13:50:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	for sftp you need sshd
2004-12-09T13:50:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	no thing more.
2004-12-09T13:50:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	righto.
2004-12-09T13:50:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	cool, thanks -- I'll look into it. I've been able to tunnel X sessions and bash sessions over SSH, but it's all still magical to me; I don't even know how it works ^_^
2004-12-09T13:59:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	that's what I thought.
2004-12-09T13:59:00.000Z	Treenaks	pdaous1	no, that's just "plain" ssh.. no telnet involved
2004-12-09T13:59:00.000Z	pdaous1	Treenaks	ahhh
