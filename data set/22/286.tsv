2012-01-23T18:43:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	then you probably want to be in #PinguyOS
2012-01-23T18:43:00.000Z	Lp63		<LjL>: but i still like ubuntu :p
2012-01-23T18:44:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	ok, just, please keep in mind this channel is for Ubuntu support, not for support of other distros or chit-chat.
2012-01-23T18:45:00.000Z	Lp63	LjL	but this distro has everything to do with Ubuntu...... it even has Ubuntu1 Ubuntu Software center
2012-01-23T18:45:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	doesn't matter, it's not Ubuntu. if it's so identical to Ubuntu, then why is it not Ubuntu?
2012-01-23T18:46:00.000Z	Lp63	LjL	: the site said that it is based on Ubuntu 11.10
2012-01-23T18:47:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	many distributions are based on Ubuntu. they are not Ubuntu.
2012-01-23T18:47:00.000Z	Lp63	LjL	Oh ! Which version of Ubuntu r u using ?
2012-01-23T18:48:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin).
2012-01-23T18:49:00.000Z	Lp63	LjL	you mean the Beta Version ?
2012-01-23T18:49:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	yes
2012-01-23T18:50:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	anyway let's move over to #ubuntu-offtopic so we don't clutter this channel with non-technical-support things
2012-01-23T18:51:00.000Z	Lp63	LjL	i tied to make it into Macubuntu did u try it ? was it successful?
2012-01-23T18:52:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	no, i didn't, i have no interest in making my Ubuntu look like a Mac...
2012-01-23T18:53:00.000Z	Lp63	LjL	Any windows apps you use on Ubuntu with wine etc. ??
2012-01-23T18:53:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	not usually. i find it better to look for Linux alternatives.
2012-01-23T18:54:00.000Z	LjL	Lp63	anyway again, let's move to #ubuntu-offtopic, this is not technical support we're doing.
