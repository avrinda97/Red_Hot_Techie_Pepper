2011-05-05T01:19:00.000Z	MnCC		anyone know a good total commander clone ?
2011-05-05T01:20:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	are you talking about Midnight Commander?
2011-05-05T01:21:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	mc - Midnight Commander - a file manager
2011-05-05T01:21:00.000Z	MnCC	usr13	no a good equivalent for the Windows version of Total Commander under nix
2011-05-05T01:21:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	Ok, sorry, I don't know about Total Commander.
2011-05-05T01:22:00.000Z	MnCC	usr13	thanks
2011-05-05T02:05:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	sudo will do the job.
2011-05-05T02:05:00.000Z	MnCC	usr13	not from the context menu unfortunately
2011-05-05T02:06:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	Is there a particular application your thinking of?
2011-05-05T02:07:00.000Z	MnCC	usr13	no .. i just need an extra menu option run as root . . its such a hassle to gksu/su/sudo everytime .. or create duplicate items
2011-05-05T02:07:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	Pretty much all the applications you have installed are going to have all the authority and permissions to do what ever it is they need to do.
2011-05-05T02:08:00.000Z	MnCC	usr13	true: except for every filemanager
2011-05-05T02:09:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	You will find that there are some fundamental differences between Linux and MS Windows.  I think this is one of them.
2011-05-05T02:09:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	What do you mean every filemanager?
2011-05-05T02:09:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	What is it that you are unable to do with the filemanager?
2011-05-05T02:10:00.000Z	MnCC	usr13	i can do everything with it .. its just such a hassle  .. you want to copy something outside your home folder .. have to gksu/sudo/su ..start app again.. go to directory .. then repeat the action
2011-05-05T02:13:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	I think you may have a misconception or two about how to do things in the Linux environment.  It's not hard but there are some things that require admin priviledges and there is good reason for it.  The cases where you copy something to a directory that you as a user don't have permission to write to are very rare.
2011-05-05T02:15:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	Everything you need, want, use  etc.  are going to be found in your /home/ directory.
2011-05-05T02:16:00.000Z	MnCC	usr13	look i dont want to dump everything there ..especially after my upgrade to 11.04 .. it wasnt pretty
2011-05-05T02:17:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	You don't dump everyting in one single directory, you orginize our files into directories that make sense to you as a user.
2011-05-05T02:19:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	You need to experience a lession in file-management.  Linux is very well organized, (when compared to the way file management is handled in a MS Windows invironment).  Once you get the hang of the Linux way of file-management, you'll love it.
2011-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	usr13	MnCC	LjL is correct.  I very much like having a separate /home/ partition because I have the option to do a fresh install anytime I want and leave all my files right were they are, undisturbed.
