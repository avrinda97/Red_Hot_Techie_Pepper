2006-03-09T07:02:00.000Z	LjL		!tell kube about sound
2006-03-09T07:03:00.000Z	kube	LjL	the resolution thing didn't work
2006-03-09T07:04:00.000Z	LjL	kube	was the resolution you wanted either the only or the highest one you selected in the dpkg-reconfigure?
2006-03-09T07:04:00.000Z	kube	LjL	i selected the highest
2006-03-09T07:06:00.000Z	kube	LjL	can't i just edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2006-03-09T07:06:00.000Z	LjL	kube	yup
2006-03-09T07:08:00.000Z	kube	LjL	xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possibly-customised configuration
2006-03-09T07:09:00.000Z	LjL	kube	if you modified xorg.conf manually, yeah it's normal. if you didn't, well :)
2006-03-09T07:16:00.000Z	kube	LjL	I can't use sudo anymore : kube@shell:~$ sudo pico /etc/hosts
2006-03-09T07:17:00.000Z	LjL	kube	ugh. sorry for that. let me google it up
2006-03-09T07:18:00.000Z	kube	LjL	i'll brb in 5 minutes
2006-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	LjL	kube	it appears that what's in /etc/hostname must match what's in /etc/hosts
2006-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	kube	LjL	 I can't edit /etc/hosts anymore
2006-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	LjL	kube	see https://launchpad.net/distros/baltix/+bug/19553 http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-7967.html
2006-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	LjL	kube	yes i realize that
2006-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	LjL	kube	i am afraid you'll have to reboot in rescue mode or use a live cd
2006-03-09T07:22:00.000Z	kube	LjL	 how can I fix this with livecd?
2006-03-09T07:22:00.000Z	LjL	kube	well, i think the ubuntu live cd will mount your hd under /media/hda1 (or whatever fits your boot partition). you should be able to "sudo nano /media/hda1/etc/hosts"
2006-03-09T07:23:00.000Z	LjL	kube	if it doesn't mount it by default, you can still "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /somewhere"
2006-03-09T07:24:00.000Z	kube	LjL	oh btw, Live CD don't work here, cause I need to edit the xorg.conf or Gnome won't start.. (it will freeze) i need to change "nv" to "vesa" :S
2006-03-09T07:24:00.000Z	LjL	kube	then try either rescue mode or booting with "init=/bin/sh" passed as a kernel parameter
2006-03-09T07:25:00.000Z	kube	LjL	okay let me try
