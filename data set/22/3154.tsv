2008-11-27T15:00:00.000Z	sug1		whats the command for sleep?  as in wait?  EX: echo fun time && wait 260 && echo end
2008-11-27T15:01:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	yes. afair you may define floating point values, too
2008-11-27T15:00:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	sleep.
2008-11-27T15:01:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	 maco: it's measured in seconds right?
2008-11-27T15:02:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	i am sorry, but i don't undesrstand what you mean.
2008-11-27T15:02:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	you might give it a half second with: sleep 0.5
2008-11-27T15:04:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	nice. so if wanted to wait 2 mins and 30 secs. i could just do 2.30??
2008-11-27T15:04:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	that would be 20 1/3 seconds. you have to use 20*60+30=sleep 1230
2008-11-27T15:08:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	is there a way to type something on my computer.  EX: I want my command to sleep for 5 seconds and type in the word hi.  not in the command , btu as  if i was sitting there typing it in.
2008-11-27T15:09:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	you want the word "hi" output after 5 secs delay?
2008-11-27T15:10:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	yes within wine application
2008-11-27T15:10:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	"sleep 5 && echo "hi"
2008-11-27T15:10:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	without the first "
2008-11-27T15:11:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	in a script file you just write sleep 1 (NEW LINE) echo "hi"
2008-11-27T15:12:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	it didn't worked. it didn't input it into my wine.  but it still came up in the terminal
2008-11-27T15:12:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	ah, you want a text virtually entered as if the user typed it?
2008-11-27T15:13:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	yes.  oops, sorry i thought i made that clear o.0
2008-11-27T15:13:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	i cant tell you how this is done. sry.
2008-11-27T15:13:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	oh darn.  hahahh thansk for the help though. :D
2008-11-27T15:14:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	do you know how I may research somethign like this though?
2008-11-27T15:16:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	sug1	not really... maybe (some or all of the) keywords: redirect input from file to wine appliction, send message to wine, signal to wine, etc
2008-11-27T15:17:00.000Z	sug1	hmw_pidgin	thanks :D
