2007-08-18T07:20:00.000Z	dho_ragus	faileas	shred writes random data in place of other meaningful data
2007-08-18T07:21:00.000Z	faileas	dho_ragus	... what kinda idiot would tell someone to do that? what kinda... never mind.
2007-08-20T12:38:00.000Z	faileas	dho_ragus	most ;p
2007-08-20T12:38:00.000Z	dho_ragus	faileas	i'd say that not saying "all" is a safe bet.
2007-08-20T12:39:00.000Z	faileas	dho_ragus	BEos installs but is slow as molassis, apparently OS/2 needs a config option thats non standard, which i need to try ;p
2007-08-20T12:39:00.000Z	dho_ragus	faileas	haha, well good luck. :)  gotta stay true to those roots, keep those old softwares running as long as possible

2007-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	faileas	dho_ragus	actually on windows, there's a http loopmount driver i wanna try, no downloading needed ;)
2007-08-20T12:45:00.000Z	dho_ragus	faileas	a what?
2007-08-20T12:46:00.000Z	faileas	dho_ragus	you can mount an image directly over HTTP

2007-08-20T12:46:00.000Z	dho_ragus	faileas	or webdav...
2007-08-20T12:47:00.000Z	dho_ragus	faileas	oh?  i'll check it out.  been looking for something like fuse for windows.
