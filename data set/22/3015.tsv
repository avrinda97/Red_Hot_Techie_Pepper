2012-11-17T05:22:00.000Z	michealPW		:\
2012-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	michealPW		You'll find a tonne of useful things. Then use gnome-tweak-tool to enable the extensions, including the Window things
2012-11-17T05:24:00.000Z	michealPW		Lemme look, hehe
2012-11-17T05:26:00.000Z	michealPW		Wait I'm not sure I understand the question, wjtaylor..
2012-11-17T05:26:00.000Z	michealPW		What exactly are you looking for, hehe?
2012-11-17T05:26:00.000Z	michealPW		I think my windows would snap-together automatically, hehe? I can show you a screenshot of my gnome-tweak-tool -> Shell Extensions if you want? :\
2012-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	michealPW		I installed Ubuntu LTS then did sudo apt-get install kubuntu edubuntu
2012-11-17T05:27:00.000Z	michealPW		'cause I like KDE and I wanted all the educational programs/games for my kids. Now when I log-in, we can pick whatever desktop environment we want.
2012-11-17T05:28:00.000Z	michealPW		KDE, Gnome, Unity etc. The same is true if you just sudo apt-get install lubuntu, you'd simply select "lxde" as your desktop environment instead of KDE.
2012-11-17T05:29:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	do they already want iphones?
2012-11-17T05:29:00.000Z	michealPW	cyd	haha, nope, they're pre-occupied with supertux! :)
2012-11-17T06:08:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	ios is a derivate of unix... http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_iOS
2012-11-17T06:08:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	so ios is similar to linux...
2012-11-17T06:09:00.000Z	michealPW	cyd	UNIX != Linux...
2012-11-17T06:10:00.000Z	michealPW	cyd	Not to mention, a kernel does not make an OS. I don't want to get into a big rant or anything but I mean things like the compiler, the shared libraries and stuff make more of an impact than the kernel. The kernel just exposes functions in hardware.
2012-11-17T06:11:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	thx for the correction. i'm still busy digging into my OS-lecture ;-)
2012-11-17T06:12:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	i still have this 600+ pages almanach to read through about Operation Systems... ahaha
2012-11-17T06:14:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	hmm ok so what ubuntu distro are you using? (to get back to ubuntu, ahahah)
2012-11-17T06:15:00.000Z	michealPW	cyd	Ubuntu 12.04 LTS! (muscle)
2012-11-17T06:25:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	i've heard of an tablet experiment recently
2012-11-17T06:25:00.000Z	cyd	michealPW	they dropped some tablets in uneducated areas of africa and recollected them after a 3 months period of use
