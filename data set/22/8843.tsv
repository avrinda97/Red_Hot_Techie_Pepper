2005-05-14T12:52:00.000Z	ivoks	bodaciousb	renice -p `pidof quake3.x86` -10
2005-05-14T12:52:00.000Z	ivoks	bodaciousb	renice -p `pidof quake3` -10

2005-05-14T12:54:00.000Z	ivoks	bodaciousb	users can't put so high priority
2005-05-14T12:55:00.000Z	bodaciousb	ivoks	it still says -10 is bad =P but the priority is currently 0
