2006-11-11T07:37:00.000Z	EdgeT		Guys got an important question bout multi-boot
2006-11-11T07:39:00.000Z	EdgeT		Can I write to a new fat32 partition hosting WinXP?
2006-11-11T07:39:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	from within ubuntu?
2006-11-11T07:40:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	yes from within ubuntu you can
2006-11-11T07:40:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	yeah*
2006-11-11T07:40:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	Does it automaticaly mount it?
2006-11-11T07:40:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	probably under /media/windows
2006-11-11T07:41:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	Cool thanks
2006-11-11T07:41:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	And what impact will a fat32 partition have on XP's performances plz?
2006-11-11T07:42:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	i have no idea, probably reduced performance
2006-11-11T07:42:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	why dont you use ntfs??
2006-11-11T07:43:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	it is writeable nowadays from gnu/linux
2006-11-11T07:43:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	fat doesnt support anything like permissions
2006-11-11T07:43:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	That's experimental dude
2006-11-11T07:43:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	you would be better to use ntfs
2006-11-11T07:43:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	Yeah but it's only experimental software dude
2006-11-11T07:43:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	you can have full, safe read write access either will ntfs-ng or captive
2006-11-11T07:44:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	i assure you that captive is completely safe, i have not tried ntfs-ng but i hear good things about it
2006-11-11T07:44:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	Captive?
2006-11-11T07:44:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	captive-ntfs, it runs the windows ntfs driver inside a wrapper
2006-11-11T07:46:00.000Z	EdgeT	variant	Yeah but I also wanna be able to write on them
2006-11-11T07:46:00.000Z	variant	EdgeT	with captive you have full SAFE write support
