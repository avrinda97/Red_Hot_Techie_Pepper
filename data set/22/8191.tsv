2006-11-15T06:34:00.000Z	blackmamba		hey, when i try to log out of ubuntu, to switch users or change window managers, the screen goes black and my mouse cursor freezes. i'm using the proprietary ati drivers (fglrx) and i've got an ati radeon x700. this happens in both gnome and kde.
2006-11-15T06:35:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	I had that in dapper. It got better when I upgraded to edgy.
2006-11-15T06:35:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	i'm in edgy now
2006-11-15T06:38:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	what really solved my graphics problems was installing a PCIe nvidia card.
2006-11-15T06:38:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	oh. that really sucks, i'm broke
2006-11-15T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	radeon driver won't work either?
2006-11-15T06:40:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	when i first installed ubuntu, i couldn't change screen resolutions properly so i went to get the ati drivers. i chose the closed-source drivers because it seemed like the better choice for my computer
2006-11-15T06:43:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	I think you did the right thing, however, the quality of the ATI supplied drivers has been deteriorating lately
2006-11-15T06:44:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	there is a chance that it will pick up as ATI has been acquired by AMD, but the direction is uncertain at the moment.
2006-11-15T06:45:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	so is there anything i can do in the meantime? i can't logout or change my window manager without having to completely reboot.
2006-11-15T06:47:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	I don't know a solution, but I would try and reinstall fglrx, starting from as clean a slate as possible.
2006-11-15T06:47:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	is X700 a shared memory thingy?
2006-11-15T06:47:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	how do i check?
2006-11-15T06:48:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	let me ask something else first: is it chipset graphics, or is it a separate graphics card in a slot?
2006-11-15T06:50:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	i'm really sorry, i don't know much about computer hardware. if you could describe to me how to check, i will, but i am woefully ignorant of anything to do with hardware :P
2006-11-15T06:53:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	is your monitor cable attached in the direct vicinity of the keyboard, USB and network sockets on the back of your box? Or is it a couple of inches away from that panel?
2006-11-15T06:53:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	lol, gotta turn on some lights :D hold on, i'll check
2006-11-15T06:55:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	separate graphics card in a slot, i'd imagine. the monitor cable is separate from everything else.
2006-11-15T07:01:00.000Z	soundray	blackmamba	just found this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=150854
2006-11-15T07:02:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	ooooh!
2006-11-15T07:02:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	that looks great, i'll boot into linux and try it right quick
2006-11-15T07:02:00.000Z	blackmamba	soundray	thanks for the help, and i'll be back if it doesn't work :P
