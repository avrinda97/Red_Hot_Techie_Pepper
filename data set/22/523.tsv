2011-08-07T23:03:00.000Z	RetroMetro		: )
2011-08-07T23:05:00.000Z	RetroMetro		installed wubi few days ago, weeks..
2011-08-07T23:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	watch out for grub updates don't do them in wubi
2011-08-07T23:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	they will overwrite the mbr, not a big deal if you know how to reload the MS bootloader to the mbr.
2011-08-07T23:07:00.000Z	RetroMetro	urlin2u	uf : ))), what, will rewrite mbr...MS bootloader to mbr... I hope that will not happen to me. : ))
2011-08-07T23:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	you might want to get acquainted with this link.... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1639198
2011-08-07T23:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	the grub updates in the wubi will overwrite the mbr, thats a glitch that should have been fixed long ago.
2011-08-07T23:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	the only other thing is that wubi supprt is not very good so if you have problems you may have to have long waits.
2011-08-07T23:13:00.000Z	RetroMetro	urlin2u	I don't think about support for now, Gradually I will go to change operating system that I am using... so I will see.. : )
2011-08-07T23:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	cool you can also move that wubu to a partition if you want to later on quite easily.
2011-08-07T23:15:00.000Z	RetroMetro	urlin2u	hm... why, it will be easier to change or do something later .... Hey, can I change wubi HD size once when I have installed it, I have 15GB I think, maybe I would need more, I don't know...
2011-08-07T23:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	I think the size is what it is. What hyou may not know is that wubi was designed for a try to see if you like ubuntu, with the inten to dual boot in the end.
2011-08-07T23:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	to be honest it takes a geek to maintasin it to keep working.
2011-08-07T23:17:00.000Z	RetroMetro	urlin2u	I think I know that, but it seems to me that I could use wubi comfortably if I want...
2011-08-07T23:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	I'm not trying to talk you out of it, but just warning you of it's perils.
2011-08-07T23:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	no problem it is a good setup but harder to run than a regular install, being that it is just a file ion windows.
2011-08-07T23:21:00.000Z	RetroMetro	urlin2u	: Yes, I thought so. Like, when I become more selfcomfortable, I will make a step
2011-08-08T21:12:00.000Z	RetroMetro	urlin2u	Hi. The other day You gave me a link on a big Wubi thread. I just wanted to thank You.
2011-08-08T21:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	RetroMetro	no problem.
