2005-10-24T09:35:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt		Is there a command to restart an ssh server, or to tell the server to reread the config file?
2005-10-24T09:36:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	sudo invoke-rc.d ssh restart
2006-08-03T06:15:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	is there no way you can dist-upgrade to Dapper?
2006-08-03T06:16:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	I'd rather not do that right now.  Is there in fact a file missing?
2006-08-03T06:19:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	doesn't look like anything's actually in the shlib package.
2006-08-03T06:21:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	Even for something as bad as a missing file???  That's, um, kinda ridiculous.
2006-08-03T06:21:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	you might think it's ridiculous, but I'll remind you that it's universe, and universe is unsupported.
2006-08-03T06:24:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	longwave: The strange thing is, I've been using the library for a while.  But I have the -dev package installed to, so I guess the linker was using the .a file...?
2006-08-03T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	the static lib is always used when -lginac is used.
2006-08-03T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	in any case, if you want a 'proper' package, pbuild the dapper source one.
2006-08-03T06:26:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	Can you give me a pointer to what 'pbuild' is?
2006-08-03T06:26:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	pbuilder(8)
2006-08-03T06:26:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	search the wiki; you'll find a howto.
2006-08-03T06:27:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	Found it, thanks.
2006-08-03T06:32:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	Is there a "50 words or less" description of what a "chroot" is?  (I don't think it is a cigar.)
2006-08-03T06:32:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	And if I am going to build a breezy package from source in breezy, do I need one?
2006-08-03T06:33:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	no, you don't /have/ to have one, but it's the cleanest way to do it.
2006-08-03T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	the Name section of chroot(8) is much more precise than any description I could give.
2006-08-03T06:37:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	I'll look into it.  I suppose I could also just delete the ginac packages, get the latest tarball, and install it in /usr/local
2006-08-03T06:38:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	I don't think any other packages depend in the ginac packages.
2006-08-03T06:38:00.000Z	crimsun	EnsignRedshirt	if you wanted to, knock yourself out
2006-08-03T06:40:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	crimsun	longwave: Thanks for the help. Gotta run. Ciao.
