2007-01-25T07:55:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	I think that means that your php configuration isn't working correctly.
2007-01-25T07:56:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	aha, you need to configure apache to use php. There are some simple guides on the net, but check /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2007-01-25T07:56:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	Then try check /etc/apache2/mods-available
2007-01-25T07:57:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	if mods-available lists php, then you can go into mods-enabled and create a symlink to mods-available.
2007-01-25T07:59:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	you need to install the apache-php package also I think. I can't remember the name, wait one second whilst I look it up.
2007-01-25T08:05:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	HymnToLife that is very strange...
2007-01-25T08:06:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	he is asking you which version of Ubuntu you are running :-)
2007-01-25T08:13:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	did you install apache or apache2?
2007-01-25T08:13:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	ok, I'm confused now :-/
2007-01-25T08:14:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	I installed php5 really recently and it was there.
2007-01-25T08:25:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	:=) That's good!
2007-01-25T08:25:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	now you just need to create a symlink in mods-enabled to the php files in mods-available.
2007-01-25T08:25:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	then restart apache2
2007-01-25T08:26:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	yunhual	sorry that we weren't that much help in reality though ;-)
