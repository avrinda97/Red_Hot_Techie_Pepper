2009-02-15T14:18:00.000Z	Athenon		I want to install ubuntu on an external hard drive, but my laptop's cd drive is broken.  How can I do that?
2009-02-15T14:18:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	use a LiveUSB
2009-02-15T14:19:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	what do you have installed right now?
2009-02-15T14:19:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	XP Pro
2009-02-15T14:20:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	use https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent to make a USB drive that can boot Ubuntu (like a CD). then install it as normal
2009-02-15T14:20:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	see section 6 there in particular
2009-02-15T14:21:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	sounds good.  thanks.
2009-02-15T14:21:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	basically, just download the ISO you want, have a USB drive big enough for it (you need about 550 MB free for the latest one, iirc), run Unetbootin, then fire away :)
2009-02-15T14:24:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	i install it on the usb drive, take it over to the laptop, plugin both usb drive AND external hdd...then boot to usb drive, install to external?
2009-02-15T14:24:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	that's about right. I mean, you can use your original computer too - just don't overwrite your existing OS by accident :)
2009-02-15T14:25:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	could i just install the live directly to the external and install it on the laptop?  I mean, I don't think I have an available thumbdrive :P
2009-02-15T14:26:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	you can do that. Unetbootin doesn't really care whether it's a thumb drive or a hard drive
2009-02-15T14:26:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	ok cool.  thanks.
2009-02-15T14:27:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	one last thing.  will it erase my external at some point? :S
2009-02-15T14:28:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	erase it?
2009-02-15T14:28:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	yeah.  i want the data on the external...and i have like 80+gb free...i just want to install ubuntu ALONGSIDE the data
2009-02-15T14:29:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	when you say  you have "free space", is that space unpartitioned, or in a partition but just not occupied?
2009-02-15T14:30:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	that's not going to be super-good for your robustness on Ubuntu. I forget if the installer lets you resize partitions
2009-02-15T14:30:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	if it doesn't try downloading gparted and adjusting things
2009-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	jsquared	Athenon	do everything at your own risk, of course :)
2009-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	naturally :P
2009-02-15T15:38:00.000Z	Athenon	jsquared	it failed...said ntldr was missing when i tried to boot it.
