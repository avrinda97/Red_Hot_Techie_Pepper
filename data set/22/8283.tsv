2005-09-18T15:06:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	root is disabled?
2005-09-18T15:06:00.000Z	ompaul	f00li5h	seems and is are two different things
2005-09-18T15:06:00.000Z	ompaul	f00li5h	in any commerical environment using root can get you sacked
2005-09-18T15:07:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	at work everyone uses root on all the servers
2005-09-18T15:07:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	it's quite lame actually
2005-09-18T15:08:00.000Z	ompaul	f00li5h	if I was your sec admin I would be handing out warnings
2005-09-18T15:09:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	the only time i use my username is to get email
2005-09-18T15:09:00.000Z	ompaul	f00li5h	no tracking of who does what - check out the whole thing on the sudo homepage
2005-09-18T15:09:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	yeah, there is that too...
2005-09-18T15:10:00.000Z	ompaul	f00li5h	that is not good practice, it holds the potential for serious damage with no accountablity - very very bad -
2005-09-18T15:10:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	the thing is that we all have our own worstations
2005-09-18T15:10:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	i know, it's a horrible practice
2005-09-18T15:10:00.000Z	ompaul	f00li5h	lets leave it there
2005-09-18T15:10:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	heh, on the plus side, we have a server each, so it's a good bet that if my server explodes, it was my falult ^_^
2005-09-18T15:11:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	yes, the irony is that only the stupid people login as root ...
2005-09-18T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	f00li5h	PLEASE let it be
2005-09-18T15:13:00.000Z	f00li5h	ompaul	let it be? consider it done then .
