2010-11-05T06:09:00.000Z	taofd		i'm having fan troubles, anyone here free?
2010-11-05T06:09:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	taofd	just ask your question
2010-11-05T06:10:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	my fan keeps constantly surging (high/low) i've tried several fan control apps, but nothing seems to work, not even the bios options...
2010-11-05T06:10:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	taofd	when you say "constantly," what do you mean? IOW, how often does it cycle?
2010-11-05T06:11:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	like high/low every 2 seconds
2010-11-05T06:11:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	taofd	does it do that in other operating systems?
2010-11-05T06:11:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	i havent had a chance to reinstall 7 yet, but it does this during bios load and grub boot screen
2010-11-05T06:12:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	taofd	if it's doing it during BIOS load that sounds like a hardware problem .... or, possibly a buggy BIOS, I would check with your manufacturer and see if there is a newer version
2010-11-05T06:13:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	i have the latest bios version, and apparently there are a few others experiencing thsi problem -___-; i suspect its hardware
2010-11-05T06:13:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	i was just wondering if the linux kernel had control over fans
2010-11-05T06:13:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	i have the newest version of the bios
2010-11-05T06:13:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	it's an hp mini 210
2010-11-05T06:14:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	taofd	even if you have the newest version installed, try installing win7 then flashing the bios again ... the problem you describe could theoretically be caused by a bad acpi table entry, which would theoretically be fixed by re-flashing ... you might also try flashing to an older version of BIOS if that is a possibility
2010-11-05T06:15:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	there is only the initial bios available at this time T__T
2010-11-05T06:16:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	taofd	ah, then it is almost certainly a bug ... try reflashing, and if that does not work, poke your manufacturer
2010-11-05T06:16:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	okay yeah, i'm going to try to reflash once i install 7, and if not this netbook is only 3 days old so...
2010-11-05T06:16:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	thx for the help though, you've been more helpful than any of the answers i've received the past 2 days :)
2010-11-05T06:16:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd		glad to help
2010-11-05T06:16:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd		... sorry it wasn't better news
2010-11-05T06:18:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	well its fine, like i said, i just bought it from costco a few days ago... i buy these sorts of things from costco for this very reason :/
2010-11-05T06:22:00.000Z	taofd	dougb_freebsd	just out of curiosity though, do you know how fan control usually works? I know that hardware wise, the fan will kick in at certain temperatures, but I also know that software policies influence fan speeds as well...
2010-11-05T06:27:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	taofd	that's OS dependent
