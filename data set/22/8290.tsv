2007-03-08T16:41:00.000Z	mentaluproar		ok, I tried to boot into windows with the edited menu.lst file and I get "erro 12:  Invlaid device requested"
2007-03-08T16:41:00.000Z	mentaluproar		without the typos
2007-03-08T16:43:00.000Z	mentaluproar		no, but I remember how toi undo it, and I can still boot to ubuntu
2007-03-08T16:45:00.000Z	mentaluproar		ok
2007-03-08T16:45:00.000Z	mentaluproar		one moment
2007-03-08T16:47:00.000Z	mentaluproar		same problem.  Maybe windows isn't on hd(0,0)
2007-03-08T16:47:00.000Z	mentaluproar		before I installed ubuntu, I installed windows on drive D instead of C (partitions.  only one drive)
2007-03-08T16:47:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	You're adding this at the end of your menu.lst, right?  (after the "End debian automagic kernels" comment?)
2007-03-08T16:48:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	Well, you should verify what HDD and partition windows are on
2007-03-08T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	Open up "disks" to look
2007-03-08T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	there's a "disks" something or other in one of the System menus (I don't know which one)
2007-03-08T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	It is there after installed.  Uh, bother.  Times like these I wish I had a GUI.
2007-03-08T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	Look for anything that looks like a disk-ish sort of thing.  I believe it's in the "administration" submenu
2007-03-08T16:55:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	Hmm.  This is what, dapper? Edgy?
2007-03-08T17:00:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	Eh?  i don't believe so.  Are you using LVM or anything like that?
2007-03-08T17:00:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	install "gparted" and you'll be able to see.  I guess there's no partition viewer thing by default
2007-03-08T17:00:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	just don't change anything ;)
2007-03-09T17:02:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	then no, you don't have LVM.  Just install gparted, then you'll be able to take a gander
2007-03-09T17:07:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	where are you looking?  Synaptic?
2007-03-09T17:36:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	you figure out which partition Windows was on?
2007-03-09T17:37:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	Alright, that's hd0,4 in GRUB
2007-03-09T17:41:00.000Z	Flannel	mentaluproar	If/when you do, put windows on hda1, you'll have less headaches that way.  But, I don't know why that wasn't working
