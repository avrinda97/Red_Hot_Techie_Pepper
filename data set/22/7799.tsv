2005-12-24T13:54:00.000Z	sethk	evert	what does the log file show?
2005-12-24T13:55:00.000Z	sethk	evert	it gives you the prompt.  just edit the file
2005-12-24T13:59:00.000Z	sethk	evert	try to rmmod the module
2005-12-24T13:59:00.000Z	sethk	evert	sudo rmmod nvidia
2005-12-24T14:00:00.000Z	evert	sethk	i get the following error : ERROR: Module nvidia is in use
2005-12-24T14:00:00.000Z	sethk	evert	ok, X is running, then
2005-12-24T14:01:00.000Z	sethk	evert	go to a console (control-alt-f1), log in as root, and do this:   init 1
2005-12-24T14:01:00.000Z	sethk	evert	that will put you in runlevel 1, which does not have X
2005-12-24T14:01:00.000Z	sethk	evert	you can try killing X first, but usually it autorestarts
2005-12-24T14:01:00.000Z	sethk	evert	use sudo if you can't do root.
2005-12-24T14:03:00.000Z	sethk	evert	rmmod, you mean.  Yes, try that.  if the sudo init 1 doesn't work, you'll have to reboot in single user mode
2005-12-24T14:08:00.000Z	sethk	evert	that's ok, it removed it because you turned off graphics.  so now you can install
2005-12-24T14:10:00.000Z	sethk	evert	aren't you already at the console?
2005-12-24T14:17:00.000Z	sethk	evert	post them on a postbot
2005-12-24T14:17:00.000Z	sethk	evert	see the topic.  If it is the warning about "poluting the kernel", just ignore it.
