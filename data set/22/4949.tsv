2007-09-02T07:54:00.000Z	nothingssomethin	brandonperry	i need to rejoin the file on windows
2007-09-02T07:54:00.000Z	brandonperry	nothingssomethin	you can use copy to join 2 files
2007-09-02T07:55:00.000Z	brandonperry	nothingssomethin	yes, copy in windows will join the two files

2007-09-02T08:05:00.000Z	brandonperry	nothingssomethin	split -bytes=600m nav.7z
2007-09-02T08:13:00.000Z	nothingssomethin	brandonperry	 it returns invalid number of bytes
2007-09-02T08:15:00.000Z	nothingssomethin	brandonperry	blake@laptop:~$ split -bytes=600m nav.7z
