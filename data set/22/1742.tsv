2010-01-28T20:56:00.000Z	woodyjlw		question about keyboard.  on win 7 or vista my num lock stays on for me all the time and bios is set with num lock on but ubuntu shuts it of i always have to hit num lock to turn it back on. gues it is not a big deal just have to get use to that unless some one knows how I can make ubuntu remember to leave it on
2010-01-28T20:57:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	i would search for that in gconf-editor
2010-01-28T20:58:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	or check out some keyboard settings in gnome
2010-01-28T20:58:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	ok ill check that and see if I overlooked something
2010-01-28T21:02:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	gconf-editor > desktop>gnome>peropherals>keyboard
2010-01-28T21:03:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	type gconf-editor in terminal
2010-01-28T21:03:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	gconf-editor > desktop>gnome>peropherals>keyboard
2010-01-28T21:04:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	thereis remember_numlock_state, it should be chcecked to remember state of numlock
2010-01-28T21:07:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	 yes it was already checked. so I wonder why it forgets ?
2010-01-28T21:08:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	desktop>gnome>peropherals>keyboard>host-"computer name">0 here is numlock_on also checked
2010-01-28T21:10:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	 yes it also is on
2010-01-28T21:10:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	box is checked
2010-01-28T21:10:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	hmm, weird
2010-01-28T21:10:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	 lol yes very wierd
2010-01-28T21:12:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	 maybe I will shut it off in bois and see what happens
2010-01-28T21:12:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	try this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NumLock
2010-01-28T21:13:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	 I built this system it is a asus m2n4-sli board
2010-01-28T21:17:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	 ahh that link you sent me might have fixed it for me I will reboot and see
2010-01-28T21:28:00.000Z	woodyjlw	KrisKo	 it is strange. grub comes up with countdown to choose OS and num loc is on for that but soon as it chooses to go to ubuntu it kills num lock
2010-01-28T21:32:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	you've also edited /etc/gdm/Init/Default, and added those 3 line before exit 0?
2010-01-28T21:36:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	note: numlockx has to be installed on your system, try out in console: "numlockx on" "numlock off" > does it switch numlock on/off?
2010-01-28T21:36:00.000Z	KrisKo	woodyjlw	correction: "numlockx off"
