2005-10-31T16:02:00.000Z	jonny		how can I get rid of KDE?
2005-10-31T16:03:00.000Z	jonny		ok
2005-10-31T16:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	NO
2005-10-31T16:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	do NOT type that IN
2005-10-31T16:04:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	it erases everything off your root partition
2005-10-31T16:05:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	how did you install KDE, or do you use Kubuntu?
2005-10-31T16:05:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	then simply, ``sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop''
2005-10-31T16:10:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	if you're using gdm or kdm, you can select the session
2005-10-31T16:12:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	are you using gdm? (did you have gnome installed first?)
2005-10-31T16:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	then you should be able to look through a list of ``sessions''
2005-10-31T16:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	pick Gnome
2005-10-31T16:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	if you don't see Gnome there, just tell me the list of choices
2005-10-31T16:16:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	do you have Gnome installed?
2005-10-31T16:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	type in ``ls -a /usr/share/xsessions'' and show me the result in pastebin
2005-10-31T16:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	thanks
2005-10-31T16:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	I may ignore what you say for a while, because my browser is in another ratpoison window
2005-10-31T16:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	it's not screwing up, it just takes up the whole screen, basically
2005-10-31T16:29:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	back, sorry, my mom called me down for some errands
2005-10-31T16:33:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	if you could, can you put the results of ``cat /usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop'' and ``cat /usr/share/xsessions/kde.desktop''
2005-10-31T16:33:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	15
2005-10-31T16:34:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	depends on the time, I'm on at 12 AM PDT for sure, though
2005-10-31T16:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	jonny	good luck
