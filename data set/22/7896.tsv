2005-11-29T08:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	IRCMonkey999	 failed to fetch is failed to get
2005-11-29T08:33:00.000Z	IRCMonkey999	gnomefreak	this was happening only today.... yesterday i was able to update using the synaptic package manager...
2005-11-29T08:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	IRCMonkey999	 if it is saying failed to fetch us.archive.ubuntu.com than try again later the server is prolly down
2005-11-29T08:35:00.000Z	IRCMonkey999	gnomefreak	oh ok...., but it says problem on my system "Could not connect to localhost:80 (127.0.0.1). - connect (111 Connection refused)"
2005-11-29T08:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	IRCMonkey999	 ive never run into that but if linux is like anything else the 80 is your port that connects you to net
2005-11-29T08:36:00.000Z	IRCMonkey999	gnomefreak	but why would it try to connect to my computer rather than an ubuntu server ?
2005-11-29T08:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	IRCMonkey999	 i dont know are you able to be online on that pc right now?
2005-11-29T08:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	IRCMonkey999	did you try apt-get update yet?
2005-11-29T08:39:00.000Z	IRCMonkey999	gnomefreak	no... i'm not sure how to do that.... new to linux and i depend on GUI a lot
2005-11-29T08:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	IRCMonkey999	 open up a terminal should be in applications than accessories when it is open type without the quotes "sudo apt-get update" and see if any errors are showed

2005-11-29T10:02:00.000Z	IRCMonkey999	gnomefreak	hi, remember me? i was unable to use the synaptic updates. the problem is with some anonymous proxy that i installed on my computer by mistake
