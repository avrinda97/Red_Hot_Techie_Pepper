2006-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	jake1		tritium any other suggestions?
2006-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	jake1		i am so confused
2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	jake1		why cnt my wireless card just freaking work
2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	jake1		but seemingly i cnt
2006-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	jake1		and i cnt get it
2006-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	jake1		i've looked everywhere
2006-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	jake1		warbo: my manufacturer is broadcom and many people with the same card have gotten it to work
2006-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	jake1		that does not address the reason why ndiswrapper is not listed in synaptic
2006-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	jake1		if i can get ndiswrapper-source then i am all set
2006-08-25T12:26:00.000Z	geser	jake1	ndiswrapper-source is in universe
2006-08-25T12:26:00.000Z	jake1	geser	how come i cnt find it then
2006-08-25T12:27:00.000Z	jake1	geser	i am set up to look at universe
2006-08-25T12:27:00.000Z	jake1		i think i am anyways
2006-08-25T12:27:00.000Z	jake1		i dnt know how to tell
2006-08-25T12:27:00.000Z	geser	jake1	have you enabled the universe repository and updated the the lists?
2006-08-25T12:28:00.000Z	jake1	geser	i cnt cuz i cnt get online
2006-08-25T12:28:00.000Z	jake1		cuz my wireless isn't working
2006-08-25T12:28:00.000Z	jake1		so i cnt update my repositorys
2006-08-25T12:29:00.000Z	geser	jake1	that's bad. then you have to download all needed packages and transfer them using an usb stick or a floppy
2006-08-25T12:29:00.000Z	jake1		Could not download all repository indexes: The repository might be no longer available or could not be contacted because of network problems.
2006-08-25T12:29:00.000Z	jake1	geser	aren't these suppose to be on the CD
