2007-12-23T11:57:00.000Z	subfreeze		Hey guys, can you add this to your repo of good links, if someone needs to setup SATA Raid, direct them to this: http://advosys.ca/viewpoints/2007/04/setting-up-software-raid-in-ubuntu-server/
2007-12-23T11:58:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	nice link
2007-12-23T11:58:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	took forever to find a good walkthrough.  I'm installing ubuntu now, and it's all working dandy, albeit a bit slower than I'd like.
2007-12-23T11:59:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	Yep, slow as tar, ahh well.
2007-12-23T11:59:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	doing raid 1 i presume?
2007-12-23T12:00:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	Correct.  It's a mail server for a small company.  I'm ok with slower speeds for reading/writing.
2007-12-23T12:01:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	When speed is an issue, I'll put in more servers with hardware raid5 and go from there.
2007-12-23T12:02:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	I guess that's why they came to me
2007-12-23T12:03:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	Good luck. ;)
2007-12-23T12:03:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	the guy that installed it doesn't know how to use linux...  so I'm most likely going to go asterisk on their ass
2007-12-23T12:04:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	That's ok, our new IT guy came in, and in 8 months, installed a corporation-sized microsoft server setup, the whole 9 yards, then put in his 2 weeks.
2007-12-23T12:06:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	ugh, m$?
2007-12-23T12:06:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	Yep, MS everything, except for the Development server, and my computer - I won't let MS touch either of them, oh, and our three production servers are Linux
2007-12-23T12:06:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	that would have been my two weeks...lol
2007-12-23T12:08:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	I'm moving to another country taking a new job and doing it all the way it should be done. :) They'll get my 2 weeks notice, for sure.
2007-12-23T12:09:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	go for it man, you have all the support of guys like us here
2007-12-23T12:10:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	a fellow IT guy mentioned to me thou, that in the long run, linux can be more expensive
2007-12-23T12:10:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	hahaha, if your IT guy sucks with linux items, sure. ;)
2007-12-23T12:11:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	Eh, hire some software engineer, send them to training
2007-12-23T12:11:00.000Z	subfreeze	ciphercast	MS guys in the USA are hard to find, and charge six figures
2007-12-23T12:24:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	SATA I/II?
2007-12-23T12:26:00.000Z	ciphercast	subfreeze	what's the specs of the sys?
