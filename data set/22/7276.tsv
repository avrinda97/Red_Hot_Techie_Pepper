2006-05-05T05:53:00.000Z	patrizia		Hello everybody
2006-05-05T05:54:00.000Z	patrizia		I'm trying to burn an audio cd from mp3s on breezy
2006-05-05T05:54:00.000Z	patrizia		What packages do I need to get that working?
2006-05-05T05:54:00.000Z	immolo	patrizia	k3b with the k3bmp3 plugin
2006-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Ok. I'll try that. Alltough I don't want to install all the kde libs... :)
2006-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Is there any possibility to burn mp3s with gnomebaker?
2006-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	immolo	patrizia	k3b is the best burner for linux it's worth the 100mb for kdelibs
2006-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	ok ;)
2006-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	immolo	patrizia	maybe but gnomebaker sucks
2006-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Still get the error: Unable to handle the following files due to an unsupported format:
2006-05-05T05:58:00.000Z	immolo	patrizia	you apt-get the mp3 plugin
2006-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Did so "Richte k3b-mp3 ein (0.12.2-0ubuntu2)"
2006-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Yes, I did
2006-05-05T05:59:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Tryin it again...
2006-05-05T06:01:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Should be under plugins, shouldn't it?
2006-05-05T06:01:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	There are several. But no mp3 :/
2006-05-05T06:01:00.000Z	immolo	patrizia	just checking my k3b
2006-05-05T06:03:00.000Z	immolo	patrizia	mine isn't under plugins but it does just work
2006-05-05T06:03:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	hm. i'll try it by restarting gnome
2006-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	After restarting gnome, it worked
2006-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	patrizia	immolo	Thanks for your help
