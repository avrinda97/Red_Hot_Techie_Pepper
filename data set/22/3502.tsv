2008-08-23T06:17:00.000Z	babo		guys, i think my buddy's computer has a memory issue. It won't work with XP or with linux live. I think it's the memory. When i did a memory test, it lasted 40hrs before i turned it off. what's up ?
2008-08-23T06:18:00.000Z	hitman1985	babo	what memtest did u run
2008-08-23T06:18:00.000Z	hitman1985	babo	what kinda hardware is used ?
2008-08-23T06:18:00.000Z	babo	hitman1985	linux ubuntu live start up memory test
2008-08-23T06:19:00.000Z	hitman1985	babo	tried a regular memtest before ?
2008-08-23T06:19:00.000Z	babo	hitman1985	both OS's boot up. linux live crashes. windows can't access the hd properly and always comes up with mem errors ... Can't access hex....

2008-08-23T06:19:00.000Z	babo	hitman1985	no. buddy's computer. my mem is fine.
2008-08-23T06:20:00.000Z	babo	hitman1985	yes, that's what i'm talking about. i did a memtest with ubuntu live
2008-08-23T06:20:00.000Z	hitman1985	babo	not ubuntu :)

2008-08-23T06:20:00.000Z	babo		it must be mem right ?

2008-08-23T06:21:00.000Z	babo	hitman1985	if ubuntu live crashes. it's gotta be a mem issue, right ?
2008-08-23T06:22:00.000Z	hitman1985	babo	not too sure
2008-08-23T06:22:00.000Z	babo	hitman1985	why should i need a 'special' boot disk.
2008-08-23T06:22:00.000Z	hitman1985	babo	because it has handy tools on it :-) hdd diagnose, partitioning and so on handy tools
