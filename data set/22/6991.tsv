2008-01-17T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	have you installed the nspluginwrapper package?
2008-01-17T19:49:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 nope..  never heard about it and don't know what it is..
2008-01-17T19:50:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	tell me the output of 'uname -a' please
2008-01-17T19:50:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 ummmmit does nothing but step down to a promt..
2008-01-17T19:51:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	you typed 'uname -a' without the quotes and it returned nothing?  Pastebin that please
2008-01-17T19:52:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 wait, I typed it wrong..  here is the output..  Linux ubuntu 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Tue Dec 18 05:28:27 UTC 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2008-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	ok, you realize that on 32bit you would not have this extra hassle?
2008-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	in any case, install the nspluginwrapper package with: sudo aptitude install nspluginwrapper
2008-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 indeed but, I cannot run 32 bit on 64bit AMD CPU..  can i?
2008-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	yes, you can
2008-01-17T19:53:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 I can?? :O
2008-01-17T19:54:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	yep, I would definitely recommend a reinstall with 32bit if this is a fresh install of ubuntu
2008-01-17T19:55:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 yea, it's a fresh install but, I was not aware that I could use 32 bit..  I was under the impresion that I HAD to use 64 bit because I have a AMD Athlon 64 bit..
2008-01-17T19:55:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	nope, the 64 bit cpu can run both 64bit and 32bit
2008-01-17T19:56:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 now, I wanna be absolutly positive that I can do this so, your telling me beyond any shadow of a doubt that I can run 32 bit on that processor with no issues..
2008-01-17T19:56:00.000Z	jrib	CaBlGuY	yes, feel free to try the live cd first of course
2008-01-17T19:57:00.000Z	CaBlGuY	jrib	 THANKS MAN!!  *runs and starts the 32 bit install!!!  :p
