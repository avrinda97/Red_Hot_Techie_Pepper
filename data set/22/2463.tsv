2011-03-27T02:41:00.000Z	umbunt		i was just making the point that you seem to have less functionality with 64bit in my oppinion , but i dont really know anything so boooo
2011-03-27T02:43:00.000Z	umbunt		is the 64 bit version safer from viruses/malware?
2011-03-27T02:44:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	No.  But 32 bit is still remarkably safe compared to windows
2011-03-27T02:44:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	:)
2011-03-27T02:45:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	Yeah, that's the main advantage of 64bit OS / hardware
2011-03-27T02:55:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	No.  Because reading the data off the hdd still has a static speed.  If you striped (via a raid) it would be.
2011-03-27T02:55:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	*it would be faster.  But probably not 4300 + 4300 faster.
2011-03-27T03:00:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	Striping definitely has a performance increase, that's the point of it.  Weather it's drive1 + drive2 or now I don't know.  Seems unlikely to me that it is though.  There is probably some overhead.
2011-03-27T03:01:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	All I can say for sure is that the performance while striping is at least the speed of the slowest drive but not more than the combined speeds of both drives
2011-03-27T03:02:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	For example, you can spin and read data off of both hdd's at the same time.  This would obviously be 2X's the slower drive, but the processor still can only read 1 stream at a time.
2011-03-27T03:05:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	What?
2011-03-27T03:08:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	I didn't realize you had 3 drives.  What is your question then?  (I answered the performance question right?)
2011-03-27T03:08:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	ok
2011-03-27T03:17:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	There isn't one.  Closest thing is gconf-editor
2011-03-27T03:17:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	Modular (in a general sense) means the parts can easily be removed and replaced.
2011-03-27T03:18:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	What is?  Having a registry?
2011-03-27T03:20:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	There are pros. For example reading from the registry is faster than individual files.
2011-03-27T03:20:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	The lack of modularity increases complexity.  That is something I don't like.
2011-03-27T03:22:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	Well the lack of modularity is not what makes windows less secure than linux.
2011-03-27T03:26:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	The cost of what?
2011-03-27T03:26:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	The registry?
2011-03-27T03:42:00.000Z	edbian	umbunt	Do you have an Ubuntu related question?  Hating windows is not the point of linux or this channel.
