2007-10-14T08:28:00.000Z	ipx		Im sick of 85hz when i can have 120
2007-10-14T08:29:00.000Z	Bizzeh	ipx	recomended ranges are there for a reason
2007-10-14T08:29:00.000Z	Bizzeh		when it says 120 in windows, that doesnt mean its actualy refreshing at 120
2007-10-14T08:29:00.000Z	ipx	Bizzeh	my screen says it does
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		and i can se a difference between 85, 100 and 120
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		a big difference actually
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	Bizzeh		no you cant
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		gotten quite spoilt with 120
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		yes i can
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	Bizzeh		your eye cannot physicaly see over 70ish
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		compared them alot
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	Bizzeh		you can FEEL a difference above that, but you CANNOT see it
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		Well, you'll still see a difference
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		...
2007-10-14T08:30:00.000Z	ipx		Well, pretty much it.
2007-10-14T08:31:00.000Z	ipx		and i love having 120, and when im used to it going down to 85 is a real bummer
2007-10-14T08:31:00.000Z	ipx		i know its doable since it works in windows
2007-10-14T08:31:00.000Z	ipx		maybe a new programming project perhaps..
2007-10-14T08:31:00.000Z	ipx		removing the manufactuers recommended resolutions ;)
2007-10-14T08:31:00.000Z	Bizzeh		and toasting your monitor
2007-10-14T08:34:00.000Z	ipx	Bizzeh	i really dont think its that bad
