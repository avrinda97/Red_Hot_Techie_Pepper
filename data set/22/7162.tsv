2007-02-17T12:26:00.000Z	nf4		what is the differance between the feisty-dvd-i386.iso and the feisty-desktop-i386.iso
2007-02-17T12:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	The dvd has more packages from the repos
2007-02-17T12:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	Not a good idea to have the root account enabled. You can do everything you need via sudo or gksudo.
2007-02-17T12:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	Meanwhile, hope no one breaks in?
2007-02-17T12:39:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	I don't think it's ok to ever have the root account enabled in the first place. That is what sudo and gksudo are for. I have been running Ubuntu since Warty and have never enabled the root account.. it just isn't necessary.
2007-02-20T15:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	It's not good to use .rpm packages in Ubuntu. You're better off compiling from source.
2007-02-20T15:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	Is this app for free phone calls?
2007-02-20T15:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	There's a way to do that in Linux without the adverts ;)
2007-02-20T15:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	You didn't mention cell phone in your original question.
2007-02-20T15:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	So, you are looking for help to install something on your cell phone?
2007-02-20T15:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	I believe ekiga can help you with that. It's voip.
2007-02-20T15:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	Oh, so you're looking to install that specific app?
2007-02-20T15:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	I don't think globe7 is free
2007-02-20T15:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	From I see from their website, they have a certain amount of free minutes, then is switches to a pay plan.
2007-02-20T15:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	http://www.globe7.com/rateplan.php It says The rate plan applies to free minutes too.
2007-02-20T15:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	ekiga is free :)
2007-02-20T15:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	Converting an rpm to use in Ubuntu can not only wreck your system it can send you into dependency hell.
2007-02-20T15:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	If you want to keep your system safe. Follow these rules: 1st choice install from official repos using the package manager, 2nd choice find a .deb package that was made for Ubuntu, 3rd choice compile from source. If you can't find any of those options, then you are left with two more choices.. look for another app to do the job or do without.
2007-02-20T15:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	They are getting money fro their customers. Do you really think they are going to say their software is dangerous?
2007-02-20T15:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	Ah, ok
2007-02-20T15:52:00.000Z	nf4	ardchoille	 told me rmp can ruin a ubuntu system
2007-02-20T15:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	nf4	See what ubotu said about alien?
