2007-05-22T14:10:00.000Z	asanchez		hi all!
2007-05-22T14:11:00.000Z	asanchez		somebody knows about ipw4965 ubuntu support?
2007-05-22T14:11:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	ipw4965 doesnt exist
2007-05-22T14:12:00.000Z	asanchez	h3xis	i have one of this at job
2007-05-22T14:12:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	and it's a wireless card?
2007-05-22T14:12:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	how do you know it's an ipw4965 and not using ipw3945
2007-05-22T14:13:00.000Z	asanchez	h3xis	because its a intel 965GM chipset
2007-05-22T14:14:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	ah right, my apologies, i made a typo when looking for it :p
2007-05-22T14:14:00.000Z	asanchez	h3xis	sorry my english is so bad
2007-05-22T14:14:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	it's fine, i understand it
2007-05-22T14:14:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	how old is that chipset?
2007-05-22T14:15:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	since it was released to the public?
2007-05-22T14:15:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	then it's highly doubtful that it is supported in ubuntu out of the box. let me check intel's site to see if they offer linux drivers
2007-05-22T14:16:00.000Z	asanchez	h3xis	im seeking for this too
2007-05-22T14:18:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	it appears intel does not yet suppport linux for that chipset (which is unacceptable and ridiculous) so you might have to use ndiswrapper and hope that it works
2007-05-22T14:19:00.000Z	asanchez	h3xis	thanks a lot!
2007-05-22T14:19:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	i wasn't aware intel came out with that chipset, but i guess i do now :p
2007-05-22T14:20:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	they'll probably release linux drivers within a month or two, hopefully
2007-05-22T14:55:00.000Z	asanchez	h3xis	sorry, do you know how to collaborate with ubuntu hardware support?
2007-05-22T14:55:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	can you be more specific?
2007-05-22T14:56:00.000Z	h3xis	asanchez	afraid i don't :/ i dont even run ubuntu
2007-05-22T14:56:00.000Z	asanchez	h3xis	we receive at work the latest hardware
