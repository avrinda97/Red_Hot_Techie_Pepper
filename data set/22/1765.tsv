2010-01-17T23:34:00.000Z	GG19		anyone know where I should go to format a slave HDD?
2010-01-17T23:35:00.000Z	GG19		I explored the HDD and deleted everything but it still says 300mb+ is being use
2010-01-17T23:35:00.000Z	ajamison5579	GG19	you could try gparted for a graphical format tool apt-get install gparted
2010-01-17T23:36:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 thank you Ill try that
2010-01-17T23:37:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 installing it now
2010-01-17T23:40:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 it sdb ntsf HDD is the one to format right? not the sda ext3 one
2010-01-17T23:41:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 thanks :)
2010-01-17T23:44:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 I formatted it but it still shows its using 300mb+
2010-01-17T23:48:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 its all grayed out
2010-01-17T23:48:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 unallocated

2010-01-17T23:55:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 they both are 30gb the bottom HDD is the one.
2010-01-17T23:56:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 is it possible to install another OS on the second HDD and choose what HDD to boot from when I start up the computer? I'm sure I'd need to adjust the bios or something.
2010-01-17T23:58:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 yeah thats all the info minus "---@---desktop"
2010-01-17T23:59:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 I'm begining to think the drive just uses that 300+mb by default even if its cleaned.
2010-01-18T00:01:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 thats probably the case then
2010-01-18T00:03:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 assuming my bios is set to boot from HDD, I'm just confued if it will boot from my ubuntu hdd and not give me an option to boot from my other hdd or will it force me to pick?
2010-01-18T00:07:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 lolz Win 98 SE haha
2010-01-18T00:09:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 what if I remove my Ubuntu HDD and put the clean HDD in and install Win98 SE and then put my Ubuntu HDD back in and turn on the PC would it work that way and ask what to boot from?
2010-01-18T00:10:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 but for a n00b it might work better?
2010-01-18T00:12:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 it would just be swapping IDE cables and HDD jumpers temporarily
2010-01-18T00:12:00.000Z	GG19	ajamison5579	 boot order from my bios?
