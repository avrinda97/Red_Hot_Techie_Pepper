2005-04-01T07:17:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	you mean WEP off?
2005-04-01T07:17:00.000Z	pinPoint	deadcat	wep is on
2005-04-01T07:18:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	iwconfig show the Access Point MAC? or just 44:44:44:44:44 or FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF ?
2005-04-01T07:19:00.000Z	pinPoint	deadcat	use mac address restriction
2005-04-01T07:20:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	they all suck. WPA would be better. MAC is so easy to fake. and WEP can be crack in 2 sec with 1/2 mill packets
2005-04-01T07:20:00.000Z	pinPoint	deadcat	what options do i have?
2005-04-01T07:21:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	i only use WEP for my network. safe enough.
2005-04-01T07:21:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	does iwconfig shows that you are connected to the AP? the Access Point: MAC
2005-04-01T07:22:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	route shows the table?
2005-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	then ping a lan ip
2005-04-01T07:24:00.000Z	deadcat	pinPoint	but "route" shows the gateway?
