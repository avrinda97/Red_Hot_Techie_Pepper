2006-06-19T10:20:00.000Z	KrisWood		I need a way to get 3dsmax and photoshop working in ubuntu though, or I'm going back to windows
2006-06-19T10:20:00.000Z	KrisWood		I use both for work and often work from home
2006-06-19T10:21:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	photoshop will work with wine
2006-06-19T10:21:00.000Z	KrisWood	sivik__	 that still leaves photoshop
2006-06-19T10:21:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	use wine http://www.buntudot.org/people/~imbrandon/screenshots/snapshot4.png
2006-06-19T10:22:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	not sure about 3dsmax
2006-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	you can also run windows inside of linux, via vm software and its more stable
2006-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	KrisWood	sivik__	 I've heard that it's considerably slower in a VM
2006-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	not from what i have heard, nor what i have seen my friends doing
2006-06-19T10:25:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	have you tried to see if there was a problem in linux like 3dsmax?
2006-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	KrisWood	sivik__	I did a lot of research before switching to ubuntu, and saw several people on the net claiming to have max working via cedega
2006-06-19T10:28:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	look at crossover office for 3dsmax, i use crossover when i need project or visio

2006-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	thats what i would suggest
2006-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	KrisWood	sivik__	all well and good, but they are listing 3dsmax as untested, and I need both apps to work flawlessly
2006-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	why can't you test it
2006-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	KrisWood	sivik__	is that list for wine, or for crossover office?
2006-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	crossover office
2006-06-19T10:31:00.000Z	KrisWood	sivik__	is there a free demo of crossover? I'm not going to pay to test it
2006-06-19T10:31:00.000Z	sivik__	KrisWood	there should be
