2005-07-31T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Fate		the rest of the Gecko browsers are working much better and faster than FF
2005-07-31T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Fate		When will FF be fixed again
2005-07-31T08:48:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	it's fixed now
2005-07-31T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	does not appear to be for me, what I got to do reboot?
2005-07-31T08:49:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	did you apt-get update && upgrade?
2005-07-31T08:49:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	cmon, of course
2005-07-31T08:50:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	firefox-1.06-ubuntu-0.1 is the version thats fixed, just close and reopen firefox, and it should work.
2005-07-31T08:51:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	I have the correct version
2005-07-31T08:52:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	try a reboot, if you're still having problems with the correct version after that, I'd go and corner a -devel / file a bug
2005-07-31T08:53:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	yeah, its running waaaay slow
2005-07-31T08:59:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	yeah, its fsckd
2005-07-31T09:00:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	I'm sorry, I can't help you with that, Could you file a bug?
2005-07-31T09:00:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	later, I have work to do now, which is why its so bad, this is costing me $$$
2005-07-31T09:01:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	you could always downgrade to the previous version
2005-07-31T09:01:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	in synaptic, use force version on firefox, then apply, then lock version
2005-07-31T09:01:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	they broke it from yesterday, its amazing. I wish I knew what part of the page that is not navigating is called
2005-07-31T09:01:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	it seems upstream went messing with the API in their patch.
2005-07-31T09:02:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	there preveious version was borked as well, and downgrading produced nothing but problems for me last time
2005-07-31T09:02:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	the 'previous' version meaning the one before you got problems, not the previous security upgrade, but the one before that.
2005-07-31T09:04:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	I have not been able to do that at all, as I have backports enabled and am not willing to dismantle the system for this crummy browser. They just need to fix it, and detach it from the desktop, so ppl can remove it cleanly, without having to remove ubunut-desktop
2005-07-31T09:04:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Dr_Fate	backports is asking for trouble, can't help you with that
2005-07-31T09:05:00.000Z	Dr_Fate	HiddenWolf	don't need help with that, as its the only thing actually working
