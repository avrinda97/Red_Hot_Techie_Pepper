2006-09-26T16:43:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		Highly illegal, still cool though.
2006-09-26T16:44:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		while restarting it said "Stopping RAID monitoring services....failed!"
2006-09-26T16:44:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		wtf.
2006-09-26T16:44:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		oh phew.
2006-09-26T16:45:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		*sigh* Why is anything other than Windows so hard to install? :\
2006-09-26T16:46:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		About the only thing I liked about Vista...it installs pretty much without a glitch.
2006-09-26T16:46:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		Hell no! I installed OSX86, was a pain.
2006-09-26T16:46:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		Vista? You have a partition...fine, it'll do EVERYTHING else for you.
2006-09-26T16:47:00.000Z	WhiteDeth		I've been trying for an hour, and it keeps giving me errors after errors...thats the problem with installing Linux.

2006-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	WhiteDeth	how old's this machine ? ide or sata ? is there a bios update avilable ?
2006-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	WhiteDeth	frogzoo	3 months old maybe? SATA, and bios updates every 1-2 months.

2006-09-26T16:54:00.000Z	WhiteDeth	frogzoo	You mean the place where it gives me 30s to choose what I want to do with the live CD?
