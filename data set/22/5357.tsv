2007-05-16T05:30:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland		Got some wireless problems ;< I got usb wifi asus 167g. It is recognised in ubuntu and I can see my wifi network. But I cannot connect to it. NetworkManager shows me 2 wireless connecections (wmaster0, wlan0). I tried to configure both of them - didn't help. Well, I tried rt73 drivers, ndiswrapper, wifi-radar and still no result :(
2007-05-16T05:30:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland		Can someone help me? ^_^
2007-05-16T05:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	Is the WiFi network encrypted?
2007-05-16T05:31:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	nope
2007-05-16T05:31:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland		i turned everything off
2007-05-16T05:32:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	Does the Access Point have MAC-authorisation running?
2007-05-16T05:32:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	nope :<
2007-05-16T05:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	If the PC can see an open network but can't connect, the only things I can think of are 1) the WAP is operating at a fixed speed that the client can't connect at (unlikely), or you've got radio interference from other devices in the 2.4GHz band
2007-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	well, I'm connected to this wifi network right now. Just using windows, not ubuntu. So the problem is in the software =|
2007-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	Hmmm, that does sound like a driver issue. Are you using NDISwrapper or native linux drivers?
2007-05-16T05:38:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	well I tried both. NDISwrapper driver tells me smth. like no hardware installed. Native linux drivers do see the device but I cannot connect using them.
2007-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	I'd contact the maintainers of the linux drivers with the details of your hardware then
2007-05-16T05:43:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	is there any way to install linux driver avoiding terminal (I'm allways getting errors when using it)? Any GUI like ndisgtk.
2007-05-16T05:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	unless its part of an update, you usually need to run the installer from a terminal. You need to use sudo so the installer has super-user privileges to install drivers.
2007-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	d'oh!
2007-05-16T05:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	What've you done? :)
2007-05-16T05:46:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	'you usually need to run the installer from a terminal' =|
2007-05-16T05:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	Well, you asked about GUI installers...!
2007-05-16T05:47:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		Isn't edubuntu also aimed at 'thin clients' ?
2007-05-16T05:48:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	I mean it's a bit hard for me to compile the drivers and so on :) I't allways the main trouble for me when I try to switch to linux. I cannot configure my wifi -> no internet -> no point in using OS without internet :)
2007-05-16T05:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Dexter_Holland	Ahhh, I see. Does the PC not have a wired connection you could use temporarily?
2007-05-16T05:50:00.000Z	Dexter_Holland	IntuitiveNipple	nooooo ;<
