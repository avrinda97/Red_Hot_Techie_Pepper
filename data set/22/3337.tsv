2011-04-30T03:43:00.000Z	relik		when i try to do "ls *.mpg" i get this error message: ls: invalid option -- ' '
2011-04-30T03:44:00.000Z	relik		any idea what causes this?
2011-04-30T03:45:00.000Z	relik		why does ls *.avi works but ls *.mpg does not on Ubuntu?
2011-04-30T03:45:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	What does "ls *.mpg" do on your system, and what do you expect it to do?
2011-04-30T03:45:00.000Z	relik	kwtm	show me files with mpg
2011-04-30T03:46:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	Ahh, I see your line from above.  Almost missed it.
2011-04-30T03:46:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	Okay, you should not type  "ls - "
2011-04-30T03:46:00.000Z	relik	kwtm	i know
2011-04-30T03:47:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	However, if one of your files is named "- something.mpg", then   ls *.mpg   will turn into   ls -   something.mpg  which will generate that error.
2011-04-30T03:48:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	Type this instead:    find -name '*.mpg'     (don't forget those single quotes) and see if you have any funny filenames.
2011-04-30T03:49:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	For example, if someone decided to name a file "- This is such a great movie -".mpg  then you will have problems if you do not know enough about bash.
2011-04-30T03:49:00.000Z	relik	kwtm	how can you wor around it?
2011-04-30T03:50:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	Well, you start with that find command I told you about.  What result did you get?
2011-04-30T03:50:00.000Z	relik	kwtm	it works
2011-04-30T03:50:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	<sigh> I know it works.  What does it say?  Are there any filenames that start with "-" or some other unexpected character?
2011-04-30T03:50:00.000Z	relik	kwtm	yes
2011-04-30T03:52:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	Okay, please try   ls ./*.mpg    which is actually the correct way to list it.
2011-04-30T03:52:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	Another way is   ls -- *mpg   for those who don't like the  ./*mpg
2011-04-30T03:53:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	By the way, this is expected behaviour in bash.  While the novice may not expect it, it hardly counts as a bug.  Quite a number of things in bash would break if this were not the behaviour.
2011-04-30T03:54:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	If it really bothers you, you can rename the files.  So you could say    mv "- this movie has a weird name -.mpg"  "Name_without_weird_characters.mpg"
2011-04-30T03:55:00.000Z	kwtm	relik	Now you know that ls * is wrong. :)
