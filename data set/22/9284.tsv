2005-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	Josip		how can I boot a hdd partition with GRUB on the install cd ?
2005-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	Josip		I mean the GRUB which is loaded when the CD is booted
2005-02-21T12:18:00.000Z	Josip		[Spooky] , check the wiki
2005-02-21T12:19:00.000Z	Josip		can anyone help me ? thanks thanks ;-)
2005-02-21T12:19:00.000Z	theine	Josip	help you with what?
2005-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	theine	Josip	say again?
2005-02-21T12:22:00.000Z	theine	Josip	does grub still show up when you start the computer?
2005-02-21T12:22:00.000Z	theine	Josip	without the live-cd...
2005-02-21T12:23:00.000Z	theine	Josip	but you've got ubuntu installed, right?
2005-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	theine	Josip	well, that's a problem
2005-02-21T12:25:00.000Z	Josip	theine	I know . If it was simple I could solve it ;-)
2005-02-21T12:25:00.000Z	theine	Josip	you would have to use lilo if you don't have linux partition that grub can read from i guess
2005-02-21T12:25:00.000Z	theine	Josip	is lilo on the live-cd
2005-02-21T12:26:00.000Z	theine	Josip	that's too bad
2005-02-21T12:27:00.000Z	theine	Josip	GRUB needs a configuration file to read from
2005-02-21T12:27:00.000Z	theine	Josip	no wait, it doesn't...
2005-02-21T12:27:00.000Z	theine	Josip	i mean, not necessarily
2005-02-21T12:28:00.000Z	theine	Josip	could you get into the grub prompt please?
2005-02-21T12:28:00.000Z	theine	Josip	just do:
2005-02-21T12:29:00.000Z	theine	Josip	are you running the live-cd right now?
2005-02-21T12:33:00.000Z	theine	Josip	what aboutls
2005-02-21T12:41:00.000Z	theine	Josip	it's very strange that setup (hd0) doesn't work
