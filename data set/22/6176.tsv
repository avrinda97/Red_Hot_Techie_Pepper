2007-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	vonderer		hi there
2007-05-01T14:12:00.000Z	vonderer		'got a problem
2007-05-01T14:12:00.000Z	vonderer		about evilXP and GRUB
2007-05-01T14:13:00.000Z	vonderer		well, that's the problem
2007-05-01T14:13:00.000Z	vonderer		GNOME parted seem to have problems displayng partitions
2007-05-01T14:13:00.000Z	vonderer		it shows unallocated space
2007-05-01T14:14:00.000Z	vonderer		and I cannot remove MBR from /dev/sda1, where my winXp is installed
2007-05-01T14:15:00.000Z	vonderer		when I mount my general ubuntu partition and say it chroot
2007-05-01T14:15:00.000Z	vonderer		after that, grub-install
2007-05-01T14:15:00.000Z	vonderer		there are no /dev/sd* there at all
2007-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	you don't need (infact, shouldn't) chroot to reinstall grub
2007-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	vonderer	variant	I can do it directly from liveCD?
2007-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	but if you want to use grub-install you may have to i suppose, you need to mount /dev/ and /proc under the chroot too
2007-05-01T14:17:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	it's simple enough with the grub shell
2007-05-01T14:17:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	from live cd just type sudo grub
2007-05-01T14:18:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	which is?
2007-05-01T14:19:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	then you specified the wrong device as the root device?
2007-05-01T14:19:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	remember that in grub /dev/hda1 is called (hd0,0)
2007-05-01T14:20:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	all you need to do is run the following from inside the grub shell:
2007-05-01T14:29:00.000Z	variant	vonderer	http://rafb.net/p/dgSy4L88.html sorry got distracter
2007-05-01T14:30:00.000Z	vonderer	variant	that's the problem
2007-05-01T14:30:00.000Z	vonderer	variant	I seem to have problems with stage1
