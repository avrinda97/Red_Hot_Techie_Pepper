2005-02-14T17:57:00.000Z	eruin		I find myself using nautilus when in xfce anyway
2005-02-14T17:57:00.000Z	eruin		since the xfce filemanger is horrid
2005-02-14T17:57:00.000Z	eruin		manager*
2005-02-14T17:57:00.000Z	eruin		it's like your typical kde app
2005-02-14T17:57:00.000Z	eruin		buttons ALL OVER
2005-02-14T17:58:00.000Z	eruin		gnome w/xfwm h ere
2005-02-14T17:58:00.000Z	eruin		and aterm
2005-02-14T17:58:00.000Z	eruin		:-)
2005-02-14T07:49:00.000Z	eruin		hdparm -d1 doesnt work at all here
2005-02-14T07:49:00.000Z	eruin		strangely it does when I run gentoo
2005-02-14T07:50:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	here?  you mean on ubuntu?
2005-04-09T10:15:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	is right.  You'll need those other libraries on the gaim-vv URL
2005-05-15T09:18:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	who's skippy?
2005-05-15T09:22:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	no need for that...
2005-05-25T14:28:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch-tips.en.html#s-no-x-start
2005-05-25T14:29:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	debian doesn't use runlevels in that way.  gdm starts in runlevel 2
2005-05-25T14:29:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	no, that's single user
2005-05-25T14:30:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	see the URL I gave you.  You want to use update-rc.d
2005-05-25T14:30:00.000Z	eruin	tritium	I cant get into my system at all
2005-05-25T14:31:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	then you will need to boot into single-user mode to fix things up
2005-05-25T14:31:00.000Z	eruin	tritium	yeah... just append a 1 to the boot line, right? thanks mate
2005-05-25T14:32:00.000Z	tritium	eruin	or, select one of the recovery modes in grub's menu
