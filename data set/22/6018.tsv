2007-01-02T13:53:00.000Z	java_blues		I have tried different browsers, different java versions, opening ports on router
2007-01-02T13:53:00.000Z	java_blues		I am just lost I guess
2007-01-02T13:54:00.000Z	java_blues		I had to downgrade to 6.06 to get my wireless to work
2007-01-02T13:56:00.000Z	java_blues		I have gotten pretty familiar with iwconfig, ifconfig, and some basic linux commands
2007-01-02T13:57:00.000Z	java_blues		I love linux, but sometimes I wonder why I am so into wanting to run it
2007-01-02T13:58:00.000Z	java_blues		before I get too far into the java problem, does anybody know of an app that converts openoffice docs to ms office docs
2007-01-02T13:58:00.000Z	java_blues		I need to submit my school work in ms office format
2007-01-02T13:59:00.000Z	java_blues		ok cool
2007-01-02T13:59:00.000Z	java_blues		thanks guys
2007-01-02T13:59:00.000Z	java_blues		I guess I am office to banish any trace of java from ubuntu
2007-01-02T13:59:00.000Z	michael117	java_blues	If you feel so inclined, you could also use crossover office if you want to run MS Word through wine
2007-01-02T13:59:00.000Z	java_blues	michael117	dont have a legal office version
2007-01-02T14:00:00.000Z	java_blues	michael117	would rather do things atleast half way legal from now on
2007-01-02T14:01:00.000Z	michael117	java_blues	doing things legally should be the least of reasons for moving to linux
2007-01-02T14:02:00.000Z	java_blues	michael117	I have a lot of reasons, but I really like linux
2007-01-02T14:02:00.000Z	michael117	java_blues	Ahh... don't worry about it
2007-01-02T14:03:00.000Z	michael117	java_blues	Java is okay to install, just a few more steps. I have it running on my home debian server with azureus going just fine
2007-01-02T14:03:00.000Z	java_blues	michael117	what is azureus?
2007-01-02T14:04:00.000Z	michael117	java_blues	popular bit torrent client
2007-01-02T14:05:00.000Z	michael117	java_blues	Well, that's java for you... shitty all the way
2007-01-02T14:06:00.000Z	java_blues	michael117	I dont have a lot of problems on my windows machine, I still have problems, but it works most of the time anyway
2007-01-02T14:09:00.000Z	michael117	java_blues	Generally when you work with java virtual machine on any OS you are going to have little kinks here and there
