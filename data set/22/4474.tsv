2008-09-15T07:55:00.000Z	fallore		Can anyone help me troubleshoot my sound? Everything is exactly as it was when it was working recently, except it just doesn't work.
2008-09-15T07:55:00.000Z	puff	fallore	Did you try rebooting?
2008-09-15T07:55:00.000Z	fallore	puff	not yet, guess i should lol :X
2008-09-15T07:55:00.000Z	puff	fallore	If it comes back after a reboot, you're having a lock contention issue.
2008-09-15T07:56:00.000Z	puff	fallore	you shoulodn't have to reboot in linux :-).  But in this case, a common cause of disappearing sound is sound card resource lock contention.
2008-09-15T07:56:00.000Z	puff	fallore	Though, yeah, you should check alsamixer and make sure your sound isn't muted it.
2008-09-15T07:56:00.000Z	fallore	puff	it's not muted. what do i do about the sound card resource lock contention?
2008-09-15T07:57:00.000Z	fallore	puff	actually pc speaker was muted but i changed it and nothing happened
2008-09-15T07:57:00.000Z	puff	fallore	Are you by any chance using ACPI?
2008-09-15T07:57:00.000Z	fallore	puff	i'm not sure, what is it/how do i check?
2008-09-15T07:58:00.000Z	puff	fallore	Well, you reboot to see if that's the problem.  If it is, there are solutions, alsa daemon being one of them, but I'm not certain what the current best solution is.
2008-09-15T07:58:00.000Z	puff	fallore	ls /proc/acpi
2008-09-15T07:59:00.000Z	fallore	puff	what should show up? i've got a list of things and some are blue
2008-09-15T07:59:00.000Z	fallore	puff	i'm going to restart real quick to test the other thing, brb
2008-09-15T07:59:00.000Z	puff	fallore	Main reason I ask is because there might be volume status under /proc somewhere, but I"m using an ibm with acpi, so I don't know.
2008-09-15T07:59:00.000Z	puff	fallore	less /proc/acpi/ibm/volume
2008-09-15T08:00:00.000Z	fallore	puff	no such file or directory. restarting brb
2008-09-15T08:03:00.000Z	fallore	puff	jrgp: everyone else: sound is working :D thanks
2008-09-15T08:10:00.000Z	puff	fallore	Okay, so the basic fix for the problem - which is that the hardware only provides one sound resource lock and the OS can't release it, so the first app to request it has a monopoly on it - is to insert a layer of software between the hardware and everything else.   Used to be this was a package called esd, then IIRC, alsa superceded that.   I think that's still the current solution.
2008-09-15T08:10:00.000Z	puff	fallore	But I'
2008-09-15T08:10:00.000Z	puff	fallore	But I'm on a borrowed laptop, so until I fix my wireless I can't give you more help.
2008-09-15T08:10:00.000Z	fallore	puff	alright, thanks, i'll look into it
