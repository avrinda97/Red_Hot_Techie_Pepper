2009-09-01T19:27:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	if you're running a recent version of ubuntu, use CompizConfigSettingsManager to enable the desktop cube.

2009-09-01T19:29:00.000Z	zebaztian	brassmaster	what's the sudo aptitude install
2009-09-01T19:29:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	if it's easier for you, use synaptic and search for ccsm.

2009-09-01T19:30:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	click desktop on the left sidebar, then check the box next to desktop cube. once you have done that, the default keymap for that plugin has ctrl+alt+left/right set up to rotate the cube.
2009-09-01T19:31:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	and ctrl+alt+click to manually rotate it.

2009-09-01T19:32:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	you need to increase the number of virtual desktops used by compiz
2009-09-01T19:34:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	click general in the sidebar, then click general options. go to the desktop size tab and increase the horizontal virtual size to 4.

2009-09-01T19:39:00.000Z	zebaztian	brassmaster	this program i'm on is called simple right?
2009-09-01T19:39:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	you need to be in ccsm, not simple-ccsm.
2009-09-01T19:40:00.000Z	zebaztian	brassmaster	what was the name of the app to sudo apt-get it
2009-09-01T19:40:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	the app is called ccsm.
2009-09-01T19:41:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	have you tried running ccsm?
2009-09-01T19:42:00.000Z	zebaztian	brassmaster	haha silly me
2009-09-01T19:42:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	go to a terminal and run ccsm.
2009-09-01T19:42:00.000Z	brassmaster	zebaztian	the nice thing about ubuntu is that it tells you how to install stuff you don't have when you try to run it.
