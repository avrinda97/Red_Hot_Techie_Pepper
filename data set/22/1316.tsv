2010-07-06T17:10:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Don't paste here.
2010-07-06T17:11:00.000Z	gracz	maxwellian	it is only two lines
2010-07-06T17:12:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Looks like you might have a corrupt file.
2010-07-06T17:13:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	What command are you using?
2010-07-06T17:15:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	-j is for bzip compression.
2010-07-06T17:15:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Is it compressed with gzip or bzip?
2010-07-06T17:15:00.000Z	gracz	maxwellian	gzip
2010-07-06T17:16:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	'tar -xzf file.tar.gz'
2010-07-06T17:18:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	What happened?
2010-07-06T17:19:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Okay.  Type 'file filename.tar.gz'
2010-07-06T17:20:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Make sure it says 'gzip compressed data'
2010-07-06T17:21:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Where did you get the file from?
2010-07-06T17:22:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Give me the link.
2010-07-06T17:23:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Try downloading it again.  It may have gotten corrupted in the transfer.
2010-07-06T17:24:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	If that doesn't work, then apparently the copy on sourceforge is corrupt.
2010-07-06T17:31:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	I also get an error with that file.
2010-07-06T17:31:00.000Z	maxwellian	gracz	Send them an e-mail.
2010-07-06T17:32:00.000Z	gracz	maxwellian	ok. bye :)
