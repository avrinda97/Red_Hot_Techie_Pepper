2007-03-21T10:50:00.000Z	Hyper-cool		!worksforme
2007-03-21T10:51:00.000Z	Hyper-cool		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11301/    can someone tell me why the permissions aren't changing on this file please?
2007-03-21T10:52:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	I would say change the ownership first from root to something else
2007-03-21T10:54:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	clearzen	how about htat?
2007-03-21T10:54:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	That worked for you then
2007-03-21T10:54:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	clearzen	it says not permitted
2007-03-21T10:58:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	clearzen	it still says not permitted
2007-03-21T10:58:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	Is it a vfat filesystem?
2007-03-21T10:59:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	You can set permissions for it in fstab on mount
2007-03-21T10:59:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	clearzen	howso?
2007-03-21T11:00:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	set the UID and GID I know 0000 will give universal read/write but you don't want to actually use that value
2007-03-21T11:00:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	sorry 1000
2007-03-21T11:01:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	I could find out one sec
2007-03-21T11:10:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	did you get the permissions you wanted on that file?
2007-03-21T11:11:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	if not add this to fstab and mount it umask=0000 that will give you 777
2007-03-21T11:17:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	Do you want a link that explains vfat file permissions?
2007-03-21T11:18:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11304/
2007-03-21T11:20:00.000Z	Hyper-cool	clearzen	that's perfect thanks
2007-03-21T11:21:00.000Z	clearzen	Hyper-cool	np
