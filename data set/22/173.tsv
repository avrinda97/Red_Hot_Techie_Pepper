2012-11-27T05:18:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	yes.
2012-11-27T05:11:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	did you see my message? I'm not sure if it pinged you.
2012-11-27T05:11:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	yes. Say it. It's probably messy to debug. Good luck.
2012-11-27T05:12:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	I didn't quite understand you there?
2012-11-27T05:12:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	I think what you really want is a more restrictive umask.
2012-11-27T05:13:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	What I basically want is that when certain user connects via ssh he gets confined to his own home dir, so he can't access anything else on the filesystem.
2012-11-27T05:13:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	that's complicated. Involves sshd chrooting and all. not fun.
2012-11-27T05:14:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	So, is there an easier way that will give me the same results, more or less?
2012-11-27T05:18:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	Well, I don't really need too much of security, I don't expect anyone to try poking around, it's just for testing purposes, so the confined account will be removed shortly after. Btw, did you check out the guide I was following?
2012-11-27T05:53:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	I have found a way to do what I wanted :)
2012-11-27T05:54:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	I just changed the /etc/passwd file for the user I wanted to confine to his /home directory, instead of /bin/sh, I put in /bin/rbash. That way he is not able to change to any directory that is above his /home in filesystem.
2012-11-27T05:55:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	well. that's pretty much bollocks.
2012-11-27T05:55:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	Why?
2012-11-27T05:55:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	I think you can just execute "bash", "dash", "sh" or any shell, really, to circumvent that.
2012-11-27T05:56:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	Hm, didn't think of that. Let me check, I'll report back with results.
2012-11-27T05:57:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	True :/ Damn.
2012-11-27T05:57:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	you're welcome.
2012-11-27T05:58:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	so as I've said. Doing it properly involves chrooting and all. not fun. I would go for a strict default umask. What is it, that you actually want to "protect"? Other user's files?
2012-11-27T05:59:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	Yeah, I basically don't want people poking around files that don't belong to them.
2012-11-27T06:00:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	no. That's wrong (if you "belong to them" tranlate to "assigned the users' id"). You usually want them to read files in /bin/ for example.
2012-11-27T06:01:00.000Z	Muelli	proka	and I think a default installation does a good job at separating home directories from the users. If it does not, set the umask to smth more strict in /etc/rc.local or so.
2012-11-27T06:02:00.000Z	proka	Muelli	Ok, thank you :)
