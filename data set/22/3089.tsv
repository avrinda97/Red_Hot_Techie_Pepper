2012-02-18T15:25:00.000Z	Bubo		Can anyone help me install gimp 2.7.4? compile and install? I asked on #gimp but nobody seems to be able to help me
2012-02-18T15:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	why can you not use the version that is in the repo
2012-02-18T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	unless you are using external repos / PPA's the version in the ubuntu repo will not complain of failed dependencies
2012-02-18T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	what version of ubuntu are you using
2012-02-18T15:27:00.000Z	Bubo	ikonia	11.10
2012-02-18T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	do you have any 3rd party repos or PPA's ?
2012-02-18T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	do you have any 3rd party repos or PPA's ?
2012-02-18T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	that will most likley be the cause of your problems
2012-02-18T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	they will be creating (most likley) the cause of your conflicts
2012-02-18T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	gimp 2.6 is the 11.10 version
2012-02-18T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	please focus on what I'm saying
2012-02-18T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	the version of gimp in ubuntu 11.10 is 2.6 - where are you getting 2.7 from ?
2012-02-18T15:30:00.000Z	Bubo	ikonia	2.7.x is an unstable version (but 2.7.4 works on ubuntu 11.10 and supports single-window mode which 2.6.x dosent)
2012-02-18T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	please stop answering questions I'm not asking
2012-02-18T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	please answer the questions I am asking
2012-02-18T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	where did you get gimp 2.7
2012-02-18T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	how did you install it ? from a deb package or by compiling it ?
2012-02-18T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	ok - to that repository will be downloading dependencies that are causing the conflict
2012-02-18T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	if the package is causing conflicts you need to either a.) stop using the external repos b.) conact the owner of those repos and ask them to resolve them for you
2012-02-18T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	we cannot fix external packages - contact the package maintainers
2012-02-18T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	that is a terrible idea
2012-02-18T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Bubo	I strongly advise you to talk to the gimp package maintainers and ask them for assitance, you will probably get reasonable help
