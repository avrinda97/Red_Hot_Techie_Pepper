2006-12-06T08:30:00.000Z	Tazmon		tried it but same effect
2006-12-06T08:31:00.000Z	Tazmon		I've also tried different channels, changing my ssid around
2006-12-06T08:32:00.000Z	Tazmon		can you get to terminal?
2006-12-06T08:32:00.000Z	Tazmon		ctrl+alt+1  then do what they said?
2006-12-06T08:33:00.000Z	Tazmon		timo1, can you do the Ctrl+alt+1
2006-12-06T08:34:00.000Z	Tazmon		oops  Ctrl+alt+F1
2006-12-06T08:35:00.000Z	Tazmon		well... guess no one here has an idea about why I can see wireless networks but not connect to them?
2006-12-06T08:36:00.000Z	Tazmon		great
2006-12-06T08:37:00.000Z	Tazmon		yup
2006-12-06T08:37:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	is it open (unencrypted) wlan?
2006-12-06T08:38:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	and which wlan card/chipset do you use in the client?
2006-12-06T08:39:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	and you use bcm43xx for that?
2006-12-06T08:40:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	for bcm43xx you need firmware files in /lib/firmware/<your_kernel_version>
2006-12-06T08:40:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	if that is your kernel, yes
2006-12-06T08:42:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	did you only try connecting with the network manager applet or also with iwconfig and ifconfig on the command line?
2006-12-06T08:43:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	right. open a terminal.
2006-12-06T08:48:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	does "sudo iwlist scanning" see your wireless AP?
2006-12-06T08:49:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	so can you ping the AP's ip address now?
2006-12-06T08:51:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	huh? you just said that dhclient over wlan works?
2006-12-06T08:53:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	yes
2006-12-06T08:54:00.000Z	rausb0	Tazmon	yes
