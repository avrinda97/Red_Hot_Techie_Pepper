2006-01-13T06:12:00.000Z	djfdsfds		can someone help me with this error, ./eggdrop: error while loading shared libraries: libtcl8.4.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2006-01-13T06:12:00.000Z	djfdsfds		the file is there, why cant the sysem find it?
2006-01-13T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	apt-cache search libtcl will probably find what you're afiter
2006-01-13T06:14:00.000Z	djfdsfds	nickrud	libtcl is installed fine
2006-01-13T06:14:00.000Z	djfdsfds		root@phobos:/etc# whereis libtcl8.4.so
2006-01-13T06:14:00.000Z	djfdsfds		libtcl8.4: /usr/local/lib/libtcl8.4.so
2006-01-13T06:17:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	ah, I can safely say you are on your own, since libtcl8 is local (you did it yourself) but, you could look into ld.so.conf (?)
2006-01-13T06:18:00.000Z	djfdsfds	nickrud	until about 2 minuts ago(when i made it manually) id dint have a ld.so.conf but i really dont know the syntax
2006-01-13T06:18:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	why do you have a local tcl, anyway? ubuntu comes with a perfectly useful one in the repositories
2006-01-13T06:19:00.000Z	djfdsfds		it wasnt working, so i installed it from source
2006-01-13T06:19:00.000Z	djfdsfds		it didnt help
2006-01-13T06:19:00.000Z	nickrud		well, I hope perfectly useful. It used to be.
2006-01-13T06:20:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	did you have problems finding the files needed for tcl development?
2006-01-13T06:20:00.000Z	djfdsfds		eggdrp wont compile or work right
2006-01-13T06:20:00.000Z	djfdsfds		thats all i really care about tcl for
2006-01-13T06:22:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	try installing tcl8.4-dev, or tclx8.4dev (a quick read, I haven't done any tcl for a long time)
2006-01-13T06:23:00.000Z	djfdsfds		actaully i got it, i just copied the tcl into /usr/lib
2006-01-13T06:23:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	what works, works. But in the long term, learning the tools will help.
2006-01-13T06:24:00.000Z	djfdsfds		ive never had a problem with tcl with any other distro i have ever used.... i used apt get to get tcl, it disnt work, whats a person to do?
2006-01-13T06:25:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	debian lays things out differently: you need to get the -dev files for compiling, and the names are not the ones you'd expect coming from mandriva-land
2006-01-13T06:25:00.000Z	nickrud	djfdsfds	it's all a matter of semantics.
2006-01-13T06:26:00.000Z	djfdsfds	nickrud	madrake ownz =p
