2005-06-11T14:43:00.000Z	fraggsta		ok, I'm having trouble with linux-restricted-modules that I didn't really expect
2005-06-11T14:43:00.000Z	fraggsta		I install linux-k7 and linux-restricted-modules
2005-06-11T14:44:00.000Z	fraggsta		upon restart, I get Xorg startup errors of:  Symbol __glXgetActiveScreen from module /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libdri.a is unresolved!
2005-06-11T14:44:00.000Z	fraggsta		Symbol __glXgetActiveScreen from module /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libdri.a is unresolved!
2005-06-11T14:45:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	are you using DRI?
2005-06-11T14:46:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	no
2005-06-11T14:47:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	what graphics card?
2005-06-11T14:48:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	GF4 MX440
2005-06-11T14:48:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	are you using the proprietary nvidia drivers?
2005-06-11T14:48:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	yes, that's why I need linux-restricted-modules
2005-06-11T14:55:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	XFCE, or fluxbox then? :)
2005-06-11T14:56:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	no, i run http://wmi.modprobe.de
2005-06-11T14:56:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	my window manager is called 'wmii'
2005-06-11T14:57:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	on my work machine and student machines i run KDE
2005-06-11T14:59:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	heh, I haven't heard of it, I'll have to look at it once I get X running again
2005-06-11T14:59:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	worth a look.. great to use.
2005-06-11T15:01:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	try 'sudo modprobe nvidia'
2005-06-11T15:02:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	i would say your /etc/X11/xorg.conf still has references for the old driver 'nv'
2005-06-11T15:02:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	I've just manually installed the nvidia driver from the bin, seems to work..also for some reason it decided to give my secondary ATi a PCI device ID which was wrong :/
2005-06-11T15:02:00.000Z	delire	fraggsta	ok.. can happen
2005-06-11T15:03:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	any idea of problems with the latest nvidia driver..for some reason X occasionally completely freezes other than mouse with it..I might have to go back to 6111 if it does it again
2005-06-11T15:06:00.000Z	fraggsta	delire	hmm, is wmii by any chance like ratpoison?
