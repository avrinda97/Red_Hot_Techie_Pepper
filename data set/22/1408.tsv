2010-05-25T09:41:00.000Z	mixxit		that's a prob there is no cd drive or usb boot from bios!
2010-05-25T09:41:00.000Z	actionParsnip	mixxit	you can get floppy images to boot usb devices on pendrivelinux
2010-05-25T09:44:00.000Z	actionParsnip	mixxit	you could take out the drive, put it in another PC, install  to it then transfer the install back to the original system
