2006-01-23T16:00:00.000Z	Bizzeh	Seveas	fine, fuck it, everyone else is ok to speak their mind except the person who supports legality and not being a stuck up tight ass... paying for software is fair when someone put alot of money into making a good product..
2008-01-26T18:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Bizzeh	because the fglrx driver is non-free
2008-01-26T18:22:00.000Z	Bizzeh	Seveas	does it cost anything? no... its free...
2008-01-26T18:22:00.000Z	Seveas	Bizzeh	it's gratis, not free
2008-07-19T04:26:00.000Z	Seveas	Bizzeh	yes, if you 'apt-get source grub' it's in grub-0.97/debian/patches/quiet.diff
2008-07-19T04:27:00.000Z	Bizzeh	Seveas	and, if i dont have an ubuntu install :) ?

2008-07-19T04:29:00.000Z	Seveas	Bizzeh	please note that this patch is applied after some other patches so it might not apply cleanly on a vanilla grub
2008-07-19T04:29:00.000Z	Bizzeh	Seveas	its ok, i was gonna use the patch to manually mod the code anyway
2008-07-19T04:29:00.000Z	Seveas	Bizzeh	have fun with it
