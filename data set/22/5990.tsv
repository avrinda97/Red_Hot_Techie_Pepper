2008-05-06T05:29:00.000Z	orudie		what is the best movie player ?
2008-05-06T05:30:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	that's a matter of debate
2008-05-06T05:30:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	many will say vlc, but i prefer mplayer
2008-05-06T05:30:00.000Z	orudie	tanath	how can i install mplayer /
2008-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	you can install things with synaptic, or the add/remove shortcut on the applications menu
2008-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	the add/remove is basically a kid gloves version of synaptic
2008-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	orudie	tanath	i just did sudo-apt get install mplayer
2008-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	that works :)
2008-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	orudie	tanath	hope its a good way
2008-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	that's find. just most people prefer to avoid the terminal :P
2008-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	tanath		*fine
2008-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	orudie	tanath	after hours of getting things to work the way i want made me used to the terminal
2008-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	mplayer is a commandline player though
2008-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	there's gmplayer to give it a gui, but i dislike the gui
2008-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	orudie	tanath	oh
2008-05-06T05:33:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	but i love it because it'll play anything, and you can do anything with it
2008-05-06T05:33:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	including speed up and slow down
2008-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	you can't seem to do that with any other player
2008-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	orudie		so ubuntu servers are slow atm ? the packages are downloading really slow
2008-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	use a mirror
2008-05-06T05:35:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	System > Admin > Software sources > select best mirror
2008-05-06T05:35:00.000Z	tanath	orudie	System > Admin > Software sources > Download from Other > Select best mirror. sorry
