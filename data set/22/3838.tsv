2008-05-14T00:46:00.000Z	IkariShinji		Not on this computer.
2008-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	IkariShinji		I've been running Ubuntu for a year, and I've never encountered this problem.
2008-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	IkariShinji		Yeah it is.
2008-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	IkariShinji		Yes it does.
2008-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	IkariShinji		Complete connectivity.
2008-05-14T00:49:00.000Z	IkariShinji		It's wireless.
2008-05-14T00:49:00.000Z	IkariShinji		Even if this problem occurs on different wireless networks?  With different routers?
2008-05-14T00:50:00.000Z	IkariShinji		Well it does :
2008-05-14T00:50:00.000Z	IkariShinji		:\
2008-05-14T00:52:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	If you need help, just ask
2008-05-14T00:42:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	What's your issue?
2008-05-14T00:44:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	It's just a browser failure?
2008-05-14T00:44:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	I mean, any other connection works?
2008-05-14T00:46:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	do you have any other operative system?
2008-05-14T00:46:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	It the other computer in a nat/lan?
2008-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	If its the same as that pc, do the other has connectivity?
2008-05-14T00:49:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	Is your bed over the wires?
2008-05-14T00:49:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	It's most possible that you have a router problem then.
2008-05-14T00:50:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	Of course, not.
2008-05-14T00:53:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	Do you have a removable wireless card?
2008-05-14T00:53:00.000Z	scriptkidd-e	IkariShinji	Do you have any other wireless card?
