2007-12-18T03:25:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	Sorry, Basically I'm trying to get multiple monitors set up(using twin view from the sound of it) on my 7900GS(nvidia card), however the screen and graphics window seems to think I have 2 Syncmaster 205BW s when I have 1 of them and a Dell M782p when I change it and restart X it just resets the settings, plus it doesn't even display the correct resolution options, and I think...
2007-12-18T03:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	I dont use dual monitors.. you are not trying to get different res's on each one are you?
2007-12-18T03:27:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, I am one should be running 1680*1050(samsung) and the dell should be at 1280*1024 my understanding was that twin view should be able to do this
2007-12-18T03:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	someone else may know, but I was not aware that you could do that.. not that I have tried
2007-12-18T03:28:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	Hopefully you can, I was doing it under windows :P
2007-12-18T03:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	This aint windows
2007-12-18T03:28:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	No it ain't, and I like everything better except setting up X
2007-12-18T03:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	Once you get it set you will love it.. but yes, requires more work but allows more flexibility that MS
2007-12-18T03:38:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	When I try to run sudo nvidia-settings it just tells me that nvidia x isn't running, even though xorg.conf lists the driver as nvidia
2007-12-18T22:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	Did you try using the hoary version?
2007-12-18T22:43:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	No I haven't, right now I'm using gnash which doesn't work too well, how would I install it?
2007-12-18T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	The workaround is to first go to synaptic, select the flashplugin-nonfree package and then mark it for *complete* removal.
2007-12-18T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	Then install the hardy flashplugin,  http://launchpadlibrarian.net/10761023/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.115.0ubuntu2_i386.deb
2007-12-18T22:44:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	Will that work on an amd64 system?
2007-12-18T22:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	I honestly dont know...
2007-12-18T22:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	There would possibly be a different dl from hoary
2007-12-18T22:48:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	How would I force the package to work with amd64(right now it gives me an architecture error)?
2007-12-18T22:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	I dont know
2007-12-18T22:49:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	Jack_Sparrow	Alright, I'll just wait it out then, so there is no estimate?
2007-12-18T22:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alex_Gaynor	I am sure lots of people are working onit
