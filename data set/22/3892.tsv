2008-09-27T17:38:00.000Z	airtonix	ljsoftnet	also trying to get webcams working in linux can be hit and miss. depends if the webcam is supported or not...blame the hardware manufacturers for single mindly focusing on windows alone

2010-05-09T20:20:00.000Z	airtonix	ljsoftnet	its a parameter you add to the command from the launcher or commandline
2010-05-09T20:20:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	airtonix	how do i do it?
2010-05-09T20:20:00.000Z	airtonix	ljsoftnet	edit the menu or launcher
2010-05-09T20:21:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	airtonix	where do i put it, in the "Command"?
2010-05-09T20:22:00.000Z	airtonix	ljsoftnet	parameters go after the command. so if your command is : chrome then the command will end up being : chrome --bookmark-menu
2010-05-09T20:23:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	airtonix	ok il give it a try
2010-05-09T20:27:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	airtonix	it didn't work
2010-05-09T20:27:00.000Z	airtonix	ljsoftnet	would be good if you gave more detailed information about what you are doing.
2010-05-09T20:28:00.000Z	airtonix	ljsoftnet	did you right click and edit the menu or the launcher ?
2010-05-09T20:29:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	airtonix	yes i did and put --bookmark-menu at the end
2010-07-14T15:53:00.000Z	airtonix	ljsoftnet	did you use apt-get purge ?
2010-07-14T15:55:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	airtonix	no i didn't
