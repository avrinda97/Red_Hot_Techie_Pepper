2005-08-07T06:15:00.000Z	cafuego		apt-get source enlightenment as well; just replace the source in the debsrc with the cvs source.
2005-08-07T06:16:00.000Z	cafuego		Might even end up with an installable .deb file.
2005-08-07T06:16:00.000Z	cafuego		and as a bonus you don't wreck anything
2005-08-07T06:16:00.000Z	topyli	cafuego	you can do that? apt never ceases to amaze me :)
2005-08-07T06:16:00.000Z	cafuego	topyli	As long as the versions don't differ too much, yeah.
2005-08-27T12:25:00.000Z	topyli	cafuego	well, the q2 debian packages are far from useless
2005-08-27T12:26:00.000Z	topyli	cafuego	(apart from being a game :)
2005-10-13T05:14:00.000Z	cafuego	topyli	No getty? How did you manage that?
2005-10-13T05:14:00.000Z	topyli	cafuego	i used to have a getty but i can't find which one ubuntu has
2005-10-13T05:15:00.000Z	cafuego	topyli	$EDITOR /etc/inittab
2006-01-07T17:31:00.000Z	cafuego	topyli	Not quite, he needs to add '--enable-daap --enable-audioscrobbler' to debian/rules first.
2006-01-07T17:32:00.000Z	topyli	cafuego	dunno about daap (don't have an ipod) but i think i got audioscrobbler support by default
2006-01-07T17:33:00.000Z	cafuego	topyli	daap is the zero-conf iTunes sharing service
2006-01-07T17:33:00.000Z	cafuego	topyli	.. just rebuilt mine a few hours ago.
2006-01-07T17:33:00.000Z	topyli	cafuego	oh. stark-johan, listen to cafuego rather than me since he has actually handled the ipod thing
2006-01-07T17:34:00.000Z	cafuego	topyli	Been playing music off my pod all afternoon :-)
