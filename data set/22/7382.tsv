2007-01-22T15:10:00.000Z	stephans		ok ok ok ok _ I found the solution to connecting to vista with rdp
2007-01-22T15:10:00.000Z	stephans		the version of rdesktop in ubuntu is too old
2007-01-22T15:11:00.000Z	stephans		you need version 1.5 of rdesktop
2007-01-22T15:11:00.000Z	stephans		soooooooooooo....
2007-01-22T15:11:00.000Z	stephans		does any one know where i can find it for ubntu
2007-01-22T15:11:00.000Z	stephans		rdesktop-1.5 for ubuntu
2007-01-22T15:11:00.000Z	stephans		debian has it
2007-01-22T15:12:00.000Z	stephans		but you can not install it in ubuntu
2007-01-22T15:12:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	and so does Ubuntu
2007-01-22T15:12:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	sudo apt-get install rdesktop
2007-01-22T15:12:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	do you have the extra resporities enabled?
2007-01-22T15:12:00.000Z	stephans	AlexC_	yes i do...
2007-01-22T15:13:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	ah, I see - rdesktop is oly 1.4 in Ubuntu
2007-01-22T15:15:00.000Z	stephans	AlexC_	a backport?
2007-01-22T15:16:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	could try converting an RPM to deb with Alien
2007-01-22T15:17:00.000Z	stephans	AlexC_	good idea.... But why are updates packages usually not built for existing versions of ubuntu? Upgrading an entire os distro for the sake of a few apps is nonsense...
2007-01-22T15:18:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	latest and greatest doesn't always mean most stable. It means they'd have to test it all again
2007-01-22T15:19:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	also, with a 6 month release cycle, the latest will be in there in 6 months. So unless a program has a release cycle of 1 week, it will amost always be the latest
2007-01-22T15:21:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	you can still, install most applications.
2007-01-22T15:22:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	you can install thousands of programs that _will_ work, and by safe to use. With windows you take a gamble as to wheter this random .exe file you found on the interwebs will be the last time you'll see your Windows desktop or not
2007-01-22T15:23:00.000Z	AlexC_	stephans	you can eaisly install it though, get the .rpm file and convert it with alien
2007-01-22T15:24:00.000Z	stephans	AlexC_	I know..  I will... mandriva has provided the rpm...
