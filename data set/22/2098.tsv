2009-09-29T17:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	open trash copy or move files out of there to somewhere else
2009-09-29T17:57:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	but the items doesn't appear there
2009-09-29T17:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	then they are not in trash... how did you remove them ?
2009-09-29T17:59:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	they are there, because when i put the pointer over the icon, appear a message "34 items on trash", but when i open the trash the items doesn't appear
2009-09-29T18:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	then look where ActionParsnip told you
2009-09-29T18:01:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	i got it, the items are there, do you have an idea about how this happenedw
2009-09-29T18:01:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	?
2009-09-29T18:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	no; maybe they are hidden files ? do their names begin with a dot ?
2009-09-29T18:02:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	no, they aren't hidden
2009-09-29T18:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	then i dunno
2009-09-29T18:04:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	ok, i'll try to remove some file to see if it happens again
2009-09-29T18:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	ok;
2009-09-29T18:10:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	didn't happen...but if i remove many files, the items disappear
2009-09-29T18:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	:1 never seen that ... if you can reproduce it easily you can fill a bug report
2009-09-29T18:13:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	ubottu: thanks, i'll report it...there's some formalism to do this?

2009-09-29T18:20:00.000Z	timber	erUSUL	the problem is that i have a exam about automata theory today and this bug is taking longer than it should
2009-09-29T18:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	timber	there is no hurry; you can do it any day you want
