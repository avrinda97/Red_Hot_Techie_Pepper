2008-02-16T15:10:00.000Z	HinHin		Hi there
2008-02-16T15:11:00.000Z	HinHin		I'm trying to apt-get install something again, but it's asking to resolve dependcies... the thing i need to install a driver to get THAT computer online
2008-02-16T15:11:00.000Z	HinHin		so basicly the computer is offline
2008-02-16T15:11:00.000Z	HinHin		sudo apt-get autoremove or autoclean don't work, also apt-get remove -f doesn't work
2008-02-16T15:12:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	Download the dependancies on a internet connected computer and transfer the files to the computer with no net access
2008-02-16T15:12:00.000Z	HinHin	alanbshepard70	i have the offline deb files... but apt-get is telling me to apt-get install -f
2008-02-16T15:13:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	you need to put the .deb files in the right spot first. /var/cache/apt/ or sudo apt-get install /home/me/asdf.deb
2008-02-16T15:14:00.000Z	HinHin	alanbshepard70	so it's not possible to purge the stuff all together?
2008-02-16T15:15:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	purge together? I'm not sure what you mean. If you want to install all the files at once you can use sudo apt-get install packagea packageb .... blah
2008-02-16T15:19:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	Why can't the computer get net access? You're trying to use a wireless card? Does the computer have an ethernet port? I'm guessing no.
2008-02-16T15:20:00.000Z	HinHin	alanbshepard70	it's a special wireless device i'm trying to get to work
2008-02-16T15:20:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	does the computer not have an ethernet port?
2008-02-16T15:22:00.000Z	HinHin	alanbshepard70	:( unfortunely that's not an option
2008-02-16T15:23:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	Have you tried putting the packages on a disc and telling ubuntu to use it as a repo?
2008-02-16T15:24:00.000Z	HinHin	alanbshepard70	that won't work either
2008-02-16T15:24:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	you've tried it and it failed or....?
2008-02-16T15:25:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	It needs those other packages for a reason. Your package most likely will not work without them
2008-02-16T15:25:00.000Z	HinHin	alanbshepard70	it looks like it :(
2008-02-16T15:27:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	the computer you're on now, is it running ubuntu. You could make a script to download all the packages automatically instead of one by one.
2008-02-16T15:28:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	I'm going to test something for you to use, let me see if it will work.
2008-02-16T15:31:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	Well to get a full list of dependencies you can use synaptic to mark all the downloads you need then goto "file-> generate package download script" and you will get a full list of the packages you need plus links. I guess the problem is that windows has no way of downloading these one by one for you, that I know of anyway.
2008-02-16T15:34:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	HinHin	This is a possibly silly way to do it but you could generate the download script, open it and replace wget -c with nothing and then you have just a file of links. If you open it with firefox and use an extension like downthemall you can have it download all the packages with one click and the resume dl function.
