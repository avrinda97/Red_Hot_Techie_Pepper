2010-07-28T01:20:00.000Z	_pg_	coz_	it is a pretty swift current in this channel
2010-07-28T01:09:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 I think there is hold on
2010-07-28T01:11:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 gnucash.... or   http://opentaxsolver.sourceforge.net/
2010-07-28T01:12:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	  also online   https://www.taxact.com/online/free-tax-filing/efile-taxes.asp?sc=0942625250001EC&l=1&v=test&kw=taxact&ad=18562968&m=CPC&src=Google&ch=
2010-07-28T01:12:00.000Z	_pg_	coz_	 i have a guy who is paranoid to the extreme. he wants to do a live cd tax prep, print out hard copies and never connect to the web and have the information not stored anywhere digitally lol
2010-07-28T01:20:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 for sure :)
2010-07-28T01:13:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 ooo I understand  I am still searching but  not much luck so far
2010-07-28T01:16:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 that opentaxsolver may be the closest thing unless you install wine and then install a windows app like taxcut or turbo tax
2010-07-28T01:16:00.000Z	_pg_	coz_	as long as they dont need a web connection lol
2010-07-28T01:16:00.000Z	_pg_	coz_	thanks for helping me look!
2010-07-28T01:16:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 I dont think it does but I also think that particular applicaton is not real user freiendly  but let me know
2010-07-28T01:17:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 unfortunately no one has created a free tax preperation application for linux yet
2010-07-28T01:17:00.000Z	_pg_	coz_	he said hes going home to learn more about linux. which means he might get to the library before close. so it might be awhile before i se ehim again
2010-07-28T01:18:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 ok  then check it out for yourself maybe and you will have a better way of recommending it to him   I think gnucash can do some of this though
2010-07-28T01:19:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 yeah  as I said you could install wine and then install one of the windows  tax prep applications onto ubuntu/linux
2010-07-28T01:20:00.000Z	_pg_	coz_	yeah i got that i was just explaining to sjm why web based was no go
2010-07-28T01:20:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 oh sorry   sometimes difficult to keep up in here
2010-07-28T01:23:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 considerint the cost of some of these applications ...paying someone would be the next best alternative :)
2010-07-28T01:25:00.000Z	_pg_	coz_	ill never let go!
2010-07-28T01:25:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 there you go :)
2010-08-18T09:41:00.000Z	coz_	_pg_	 whoa   that is not good
