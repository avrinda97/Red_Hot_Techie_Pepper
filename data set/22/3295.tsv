2008-11-03T09:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb		Dabill:  to be honest  there is hardly anything worth upgrading from Hardy to Intrepid Ibex
2008-11-03T09:58:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	I didn't expect anything much from intrepid but i wanted to upgrade, cuz Hardy was buggy, my wifi wouldn't work
2008-11-03T09:58:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	my sound from my laptop is working again in Ibex, working like NEVER BEFORE
2008-11-03T09:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	well that's  nice  my GDM  does not  display right, but oh well just GDM,  but at times it would in hady display right on this PC
2008-11-03T10:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	 well consdiering I am a touch typeist it is usauley faster to type them
2008-11-03T10:01:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	so am i, but using tab is way faster.
2008-11-03T10:01:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	and avoids typos
2008-11-10T09:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	 mozilla seamonkey I guess
2008-11-10T09:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	   Kompozer was based on NVU  and well they both are based on Mozilla Seamonkey's  compossor  so yeah
2008-11-10T09:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	or the former Mozilla Suite's to be exact,  but yes  Seamonkey  in answer to your question
2008-11-10T10:01:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	so, if I don't want to download the klibs.. I can use seamonkey?
2009-02-16T23:41:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	wrong person ;)
2009-02-16T23:34:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	isn't rhythmbox better than banshee? which is less prone to crash?
2009-02-16T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	I used to use Rythombox in Hardy Heron when Banshee sucked
2009-02-16T23:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	,but now  Banshee kicks arse  big time compared to Rythombox
2009-02-16T23:35:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	thanks, I'll get banshee soon! amarok isn't native to gnome, right?
2009-02-16T23:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	indeed it's not native to Gnome  since it's a KDE app, but it will run in Gnome/Ubuntu
2009-02-16T23:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	yeah you need Intrepid Ibex  for good version of Banshee, or  do the ppa in Hardy Heron
2009-02-16T23:37:00.000Z	lianimator	sebsebseb	I like rhythmbox's easy search. and it'll play the songs in the filter.. I don't like making playlists.
2009-02-16T23:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	playlists heh, just import  your music to banshee and videos, and that's that
2009-02-16T23:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	and last.fm is cool to use with Banshee :)  http://www.last.fm
2009-02-16T23:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lianimator	PIdgin could be used for IRC yes, but Konversation :d
