2007-02-10T17:34:00.000Z	mandrill		thnx unop :)
2007-02-10T16:40:00.000Z	mandrill		I've never seen it below 900
2007-02-10T16:41:00.000Z	mandrill		anyone know anything about sharing folders with a windows machine?
2007-02-10T16:41:00.000Z	mandrill		It was working fine last night
2007-02-10T16:42:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	If you set up your Windows machine to share folders, then you should be able to access those folders using Konqueror's samba features.
2007-02-10T16:43:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	To be able to do that, you need to install samba and then configure it to share the folders you want to share.
2007-02-10T16:44:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	Konqueror is a web/file browser with a lot features. It comes installed by default on Kubuntu. (Not ubuntu.)
2007-02-10T16:45:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	Are you sure that samba is configured properly?
2007-02-10T16:47:00.000Z	mandrill	zzz_	it should be. I haven't changed anything since yesterday when it worked
2007-02-10T16:48:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	Try running smbtree.
2007-02-10T16:51:00.000Z	mandrill	zzz_	my two machines are there. The two folders on my ubuntu machine which I want shared are there as are the folders on my windows machine.
2007-02-10T16:53:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	Do you mean that you can see your shares with smbtree?
2007-02-10T16:53:00.000Z	mandrill	zzz_	yes
2007-02-10T16:54:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	Then you should be able to access your Ubuntu shares using //ipaddressofubuntubox/sharename
2007-02-10T16:54:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	Sorry, it should be \\ipaddressofubuntubox\sharename
2007-02-10T16:56:00.000Z	mandrill	zzz_	thats bizzare. my win machine is seeing my ubuntu machine in mshome but won't let me access it. If I add the shares as network places in windows i can see them fine.
2007-02-10T16:57:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	What about login/password information? Are you sure that those are correct?
2007-02-10T17:00:00.000Z	mandrill	zzz_	I wasn't getting anywhere with that yesterday. I'd make the3 login details identical on both machines, set up an smbpass on the ubuntu machine and it still didn't work. I ended up editing smb.conf to make the shares public and unauthenticated. I don't know how much of a security risk that is though.
2007-02-10T17:01:00.000Z	zzz_	mandrill	I am sorry but I don't think I can help...
2007-02-10T17:07:00.000Z	mandrill	zzz_	I can access the folder fine now from windows, thnx for your help. you don't know anything about task automation do you?
