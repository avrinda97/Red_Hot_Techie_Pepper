2006-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	ziad		cud anyone plz tell me..how to active root user in ubuntu
2006-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ziad	Don't do it. Using sudo is always better
2006-06-05T07:35:00.000Z	ziad	onkarshinde	but I want to install .bin and .rpm packages
2006-06-05T07:36:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ziad	Why do you need rpm package? Isn't it available in Ubuntu repos already? What s/w are you installing?
2006-06-05T07:37:00.000Z	ziad	onkarshinde	amsn, and others...it also requires for .bin to chmod
2006-06-05T07:37:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ziad	amsn is available in ubuntu repositories and many more packages.
2006-06-05T07:38:00.000Z	ziad	onkarshinde	is it possible just to let me know how to change to root
2006-06-05T07:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ziad	First thing, you are solving wrong problem. I can not help with it. You can't install rpm package. Also you are trying to do something that has other simple ways to do.
2006-06-05T07:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ziad	rpm has to be converted to deb package
2006-06-05T07:41:00.000Z	ziad	onkarshinde	well i get ur point...but y is it wrong to work as root
2006-06-05T07:42:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ziad	Becuase then you normally log in as root which is harmfull if your system is attacked over internet.
2006-06-05T07:42:00.000Z	ziad	onkarshinde	thanx.... (y) then plz tell me how do i convert rpm to deb
2006-06-05T07:43:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ziad	If you are installing amsn, it is available already in repositories.
