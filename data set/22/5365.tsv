2007-05-19T16:57:00.000Z	bluej774		In the Removable Drives and Media Preferences menu, what are the codes for %d and %m?
2007-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	bluej774		Pardon me.  Can someone answer a question about Ubuntu's automounting options menus?
2007-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	bluej774	ask the question and maybe someone can help :)
2007-05-19T05:00:00.000Z	PriceChild	bluej774	do you mean in /media ?
2007-05-19T05:01:00.000Z	bluej774	PriceChild	No.  Take a look at the Removable Drives and Media Preferences dialog and you'll see what I mean.
2007-05-19T05:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	bluej774	sorry I don't understand the qu..... hehe which dialogue?
2007-05-19T05:02:00.000Z	bluej774	PriceChild	in Gnome, go to System -> Preferences -> Removable Drives and Media

2007-05-19T05:06:00.000Z	bluej774	PriceChild	I found the answer through playing around if you'd like to know.
2007-05-19T05:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	bluej774	yes definitely...
2007-05-19T05:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	bluej774	ah i see mc44 told you in -offtopic :)
2007-05-19T05:06:00.000Z	bluej774	PriceChild	%d refers to the device, ie /dev/scd0, whereas %m refers to the path, ie /media/cdrom
2007-05-19T05:07:00.000Z	bluej774	PriceChild	if there are any other variables, I don't know them.
