2010-04-30T14:42:00.000Z	sunk8		Wow, m having the strangest issue here. My sudo doesn't work. Anything requiring root access doesn't open!
2010-04-30T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	can you give me an example of a failing command (in full)
2010-04-30T14:44:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	Everything. eg. Synaptic won't open at all. It stops at 'starting administrative...' and poof, its gone
2010-04-30T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	you use gksudo for graphical apps
2010-04-30T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	and it's launched from the menu - why are you typing it
2010-04-30T14:44:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	gartral. I know but even sudo -i or su wont work for me.
2010-04-30T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	what is the error
2010-04-30T14:45:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	no error here. Just a blinkin cursor if I'm in a terminal.
2010-04-30T14:45:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	And if its a GUI, it simply vanishes.
2010-04-30T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	so id you do "sudo ls" that just hangs
2010-04-30T14:47:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	sudo ls gives me a cursor that'll blink till the end of this planet.
2010-04-30T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	can you ctrl+c it
2010-04-30T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	ahh ha
2010-04-30T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	what is your machine hostname ?
2010-04-30T14:49:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	ttwrdsktp
2010-04-30T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	ok do you know how to boot into safe/recovery mode
2010-04-30T14:50:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	ya, i can choose it in grub but never tried it b4.
2010-04-30T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	cool, so what you need to do is boot into safe mode, open /etc/hosts file and find one of the entries that either say "127.0.0.1" or "127.0.1.1" and change the hostname line to your hostname
2010-04-30T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	then when you reboot, you'll find sudo is working fine
2010-04-30T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	sunk8	I'm out for a bit now - but that should work
2010-04-30T14:51:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	In which file is the ikonia. K thanks
2010-04-30T15:04:00.000Z	sunk8	ikonia	grndslm. Thanks guys. I edited my /etc/hosts using a Live CD and it works like a dream now. ;-)
