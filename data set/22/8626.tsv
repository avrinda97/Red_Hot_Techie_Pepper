2005-06-25T10:30:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	hoary hedgehog?
2005-06-25T10:30:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	forgot which nickname, but it's 5.04
2005-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	yeah thats the one that im trying on my old compaq armada m700 laptop.. it kinda works ;)
2005-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	heh, the hardware in this machine hasn't had much luck with gentoo or debian.. so I decided to download ubuntu
2005-06-25T10:32:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	chances are.. it'll suck just as much ;)
2005-06-25T10:32:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	gentoo borks when trying to boot normally, and the debian partition manager just hangs there when checking for disks
2005-06-25T10:32:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	ouch.. what kind of a piece of crap are you running it on? :P
2005-06-25T10:33:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	lol, wouldn't say it's crap, but it's one of those pre-built bundled machines that I got given.. it still has a warranty so I don't feel like ripping it apart yet
2005-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	ahh yeah.. it'll have a bodgey partition table on it most likely
2005-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	nah, I wiped the drives entirely :)
2005-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	if it came with a rescue disk.. i'd just blow everything away and repartition it
2005-06-25T10:36:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	heh, I'll be downloading that some other time, downloading at 46kb/s is bad enough right now :)
2005-06-25T10:36:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	I donwnloaded the dvd at about 12k/s :P
2005-06-25T10:37:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	that's fine if you're wanting to get it installed by the end of the year :P
2005-06-25T10:43:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	you still around? :)
2005-06-25T10:44:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	yes
2005-06-25T10:45:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	thats a good question.. i'd like to know that too.. apart from it really does suck on my laptop
2005-06-25T10:46:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	it should be called "hoary slapper"
2005-06-25T10:53:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	you could just mount the disk and copy it elsewhere? :)
2005-06-25T10:53:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	its in a laptop
2005-06-25T10:56:00.000Z	unreal	snadge	if all else fails, you could try another livecd (the gentoo one is pretty decent from my experience) and upload the data somewhere
2005-06-25T10:56:00.000Z	snadge	unreal	i have some boot floppies
