2010-05-09T00:44:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	sudo passwd -l root
2010-05-09T00:44:00.000Z	frxstrem	jrib	okay, thanks :)
2010-06-01T19:11:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	with your backups ideally.  But see ubottu if you are desparate.
2010-06-01T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	yes
2010-06-01T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	if you don't have backups, just take this as the moment you started making them, everyone has one
2010-06-01T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	google turns up http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/ no idea if it will blow up your system, but worth a read
2010-06-04T22:42:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	should be
2010-06-04T22:42:00.000Z	frxstrem	jrib	any idea how?
2010-06-04T22:43:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	press those buttons when you set the shortcut?
2010-06-04T22:43:00.000Z	frxstrem	jrib	well, duh, it is **keyboard** shortcuts, so of course it doesn't work that way
2010-06-05T01:10:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	if you want a literal ~, just escape it
2010-06-05T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	why?  I imagine that's not easily accomplished
2010-06-05T01:11:00.000Z	frxstrem	jrib	I just said why...(look a bit back in the chat log)
2010-06-05T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	what are you running that you remove your home directory?
2010-06-05T01:14:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	honestly, name it something else.  But maybe #bash can tell you how to disable ~ expansion
2010-07-08T02:22:00.000Z	frxstrem	jrib	actually, that wasn't what I was looking for - I think it was !boot
2010-07-08T02:23:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	depends on what you are doing.  What are you doing? :)
2010-07-27T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	several people already told you how.  What didn't you like about that answer?
2010-11-09T23:30:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	uname -m
2010-11-09T23:30:00.000Z	frxstrem	jrib	ok, thanks :D
2011-01-04T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	frxstrem	sudo service ssh stop
