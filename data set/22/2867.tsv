2009-03-31T10:56:00.000Z	benkamin	space_cadet	thanks :-) , i'm trying to learn about this now
2009-03-31T10:56:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	did you have better luck?
2009-03-31T10:56:00.000Z	benkamin	space_cadet	not yet, trying to understand it, i haven't used it before, only the remote desktop
2009-03-31T10:57:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	well... i tried using the remote desktop to see my xp machine, but with no luck... in terminal server however... lots of luck, just thought you may have to use the same thing.
2009-03-31T10:59:00.000Z	benkamin	space_cadet	thx, but  i'm still trying to understand how to use it.
2009-03-31T11:00:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	terminal this:  man tsclient
2009-03-31T11:00:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	to quit press 'q'
2009-03-31T11:00:00.000Z	benkamin	space_cadet	when both os are ubuntu, is it still useful to use this?
2009-03-31T11:00:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	not sure..
2009-03-31T11:01:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	Terminal Server Client (tsclient) lets you connect to remote desktops using many different protocols. It has support for specific connection options including color depth, screen size, and motion blocking.
2009-03-31T11:01:00.000Z	benkamin	space_cadet	thx, i'll give it a try
2009-03-31T11:02:00.000Z	benkamin	space_cadet	for some reason the VNC protocol is disabled and can't be selected...
2009-03-31T11:06:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	sudo apt-get install xtightvncviewer
2009-03-31T11:07:00.000Z	space_cadet	benkamin	then try vnc in terminal service client
