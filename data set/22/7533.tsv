2008-03-02T01:03:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	depends
2008-03-02T01:03:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	when you partitioned, you did keep the windows partition in tact, right
2008-03-02T01:04:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	sounds like you will have to reinstall windows
2008-03-02T01:04:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	unless you kept the windows partition
2008-03-02T01:05:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	you should have a "Restore CD"
2008-03-02T01:07:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	ok, are you sure the windows partition is gone?
2008-03-02T01:08:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	i dont know what you were told to do, but lets find out for sure.
2008-03-02T01:08:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	install gparted
2008-03-02T01:08:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	sudo apt-get install gparted
2008-03-02T01:09:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	what did fdisk say?
2008-03-02T01:10:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	post on http://paste.ubuntu.nl
2008-03-02T01:10:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	please run sudo fdisk -l and post to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-03-02T01:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	ok, windows is not installed
2008-03-02T01:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	you will need to reinstall windows
2008-03-02T01:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	not even a "Restore CD"?
2008-03-02T01:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	what is your manufacturer?
2008-03-02T01:14:00.000Z	Some_Person	jk__	are you sure your PC did not come with a restore disc?
