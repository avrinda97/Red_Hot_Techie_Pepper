2012-09-03T00:29:00.000Z	russ_		I have a strange problem with my bootup
2012-09-03T00:31:00.000Z	russ_		Is anyone wanting to hear my story of failure?
2012-09-03T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	go for it, if it's ubuntu support related
2012-09-03T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	do you use proprietary video drivers?
2012-09-03T00:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	its a concious choice to install them. Can you please pastebin the output of:  sudo lshw -C display; lsb_release -a; uname -a     Thanks
2012-09-03T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	copy the output then go to http://pastie.org  and paste the text there and hit paste. When the page changes, copy the URL and paste it here as an update
2012-09-03T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	look at the commands you ran inyour paste then look at the comamnds I gave
2012-09-03T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	if you run incorrect commands, not only will it not work, you may accidentally run a different command and break your OS
2012-09-03T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	sudo lshw -C display     NOT: sudo lshaw -C display
2012-09-03T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	the commands aren't the same...again...
2012-09-03T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	yes, but read your last pastebin carefully
2012-09-03T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	sudo: lshaw: command not found
2012-09-03T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	lshaw is not lshw   is it
2012-09-03T00:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	see how it works when you type it righ...
2012-09-03T00:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	weird isn't it
2012-09-03T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	run:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get --reinstall install nvidia-current
2012-09-03T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	good luck typing all that if you can't type a 4 letter command...
2012-09-03T01:28:00.000Z	russ_	ActionParsnip	Still having the same problem, still can't cleanly load without holding shift using previous linux updates
2012-09-03T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	did the nvidia driver install ok?
2012-09-03T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	could try:  sudo nvidia-xconfig    then rebooting
2012-09-03T01:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russ_	look sfine
2012-09-03T01:41:00.000Z	russ_	ActionParsnip	Any suggestions?
