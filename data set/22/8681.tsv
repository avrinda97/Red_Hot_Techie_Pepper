2008-04-24T19:46:00.000Z	nemo		hm. #ubuntu+1 has been shut down?
2008-04-24T19:47:00.000Z	nemo		  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
2008-04-24T19:47:00.000Z	nemo		 8027 nemo      39  19 2118m 730m 2672 S  0.0 36.1   9:36.63 trackerd
2008-04-24T19:48:00.000Z	nemo		Anyway, main point is. why is trackerd so damn greedy?
2008-04-24T19:48:00.000Z	nemo		36% of system memory
2008-04-24T19:49:00.000Z	nemo		I did do one restart yesterday actually, but it was greedy before that too
2008-04-24T19:49:00.000Z	nemo		oh. no. I didn't do a restart yesterday
2008-04-24T19:50:00.000Z	nemo		my uptime is at 2 days
2008-04-24T19:52:00.000Z	nemo		and I say that in the kindest possible terms. I spent a lot of time on beagle :)
2008-04-24T19:52:00.000Z	nemo		including patches
2008-04-24T19:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	nemo	no; it is C based and in my experience beagle worked better
2008-04-24T19:53:00.000Z	nemo	erUSUL	well. beagle was also a hog ;)
2008-04-24T19:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	nemo	but at least it worked teracker is a hog but shows half the info
2008-04-24T19:55:00.000Z	nemo	erUSUL	heh. I had indexing issues with beagle too ;)  but, at least I had RTFSed that one...
2008-04-24T19:55:00.000Z	nemo	erUSUL	I do note with gratification that trackerd indexes file notes
2008-04-24T19:55:00.000Z	nemo	erUSUL	that was always an irritation with beagle.  I had a patch for that, but it was pretty hackish
2008-04-24T19:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	nemo	i used beagle for pdf & mails mainly
2008-04-24T19:57:00.000Z	nemo	erUSUL	oh well. I get the idea the upshot is no one knows why trackerd is a memory hog. it just is.
2010-05-11T21:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	nemo	edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile
2010-05-11T21:14:00.000Z	nemo	erUSUL	I want it system-wide
2010-05-11T21:14:00.000Z	nemo	erUSUL	I know how to set it for one user :)
2010-05-11T21:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	nemo	/etc/environment
