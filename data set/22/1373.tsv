2010-06-04T05:20:00.000Z	acjoven		so I switched my keyboard layout to Dvorak, but the keymappings are still QWERTY when using the Ctrl key
2010-06-04T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	that's pretty weird.  You're on ubuntu right, not OS X?
2010-06-04T05:22:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	yep, ubuntu lucid.  and older programs like xpdf register the keystroke locations, not identities, effectively hardcoding the qwerty layout
2010-06-04T05:24:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	so is the issue only with these older programs?
2010-06-04T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	i hit ctrl-f in dvorak and the search pops up in xpdf.  I'm not sure what you are saynig
2010-06-04T05:28:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	the issue is with all Ctrl-key combos; the xpdf bit was a sidenote and occurs for single keystrokes (not Ctrl'd)
2010-06-04T05:28:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	can you give me an example in xpdf?  I'm not familiar with the key shortcuts
2010-06-04T05:29:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	sure, if I want to quit xpdf, hitting the Dvorak 'q' has no result; hitting the Dvorak ';' aka the qwerty 'q' successfully exits the program
2010-06-04T05:30:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	q on dvorak works here, ; in dvorak does nothing.  Hmm.  Note I'm not in gnome atm
2010-06-04T05:31:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	Hmm, I am in gnome, I think you may have helped identify the culprit, haha
2010-06-04T05:31:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	try something like fluxbox just to verify
2010-06-04T05:47:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	the Dvorak keystrokes worked in fluxbox, that isolates the problem to gnome, thanks!
2010-06-04T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	maybe check Keyboard Properties for some obscure option
2010-06-04T05:51:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	didn't find anything obvious, I'll check the gnome bugs for something similar
2010-06-04T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	maybe "keys to change layout" in layout options
2010-06-04T05:53:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	I've got that set to both Alt keys, shouldn't affect it
2010-06-04T05:53:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	oh, I just noticed "ctrl while pressed there".  Tried toggling it?
2010-06-04T05:54:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	and one of the Alt keys doesn't work! haha, so hopefully I've rendered that option ineffective
2010-06-04T05:54:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	or see if removing the other layouts you have temporarily changes the behavior in xpdf
2010-06-04T05:55:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	wow, that did it, I had to move the Dvorak to the top of the list of layouts
2010-06-04T05:55:00.000Z	jrib	acjoven	interesting.  Still sounds buggy if you didn't select any option for that though
2010-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	acjoven	jrib	agreed, there are 'move up' and 'move down' options for the group of layouts, but it doesn't imply the order actually matters
