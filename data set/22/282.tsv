2012-05-30T16:11:00.000Z	Pierreb		i just installed ubuntu and it looked fine, after booting it show the loading screen with the 4 dots but then it show a grey screen and nothing is happening
2012-05-30T16:11:00.000Z	Pierreb		nvidia 420
2012-05-30T16:11:00.000Z	Pierreb		should i have skipped the install 3rd party software?
2012-05-30T16:13:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	good idea, that way you will use "nouveau" intead of the priopretary driver, but with nouveau you can not play 3D games like Urban Terror =(
2012-05-30T16:17:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	you can see the logins screen?
2012-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	Pierreb	Chuck_Norris	i can see the loading screen, i tried hitting escape then some text flashed on the screen then it "loaded" the gfx driver and went "black"
2012-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	Pierreb	Chuck_Norris	i never get to the login screen
2012-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	could be the bugy version of the nvidia 295.40 (already confirmed by Nvidia)
2012-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	Pierreb	Chuck_Norris	so im at the recovery mode, what should i do then?
2012-05-30T16:25:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	aptitude search nvidia-current
2012-05-30T16:27:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	sudo apt-get install aptitude
2012-05-30T16:31:00.000Z	Pierreb	Chuck_Norris	that failed, w: not using locking for read only lock file blablabal
2012-05-30T16:31:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	what command gives you that outputs?
2012-05-30T16:35:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	paste:  lsmod | grep nvidia
2012-05-30T16:36:00.000Z	Pierreb	Chuck_Norris	it says 12319264     0
2012-05-30T16:37:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	do not say "nvidia" anywhere?
2012-05-30T16:37:00.000Z	Pierreb	Chuck_Norris	nope
2012-05-30T16:38:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	paste:  lsmod | grep nouveau
2012-05-30T16:48:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	maybe the service "NetworkManager" is not runing on the rescue mode: sudo service network-manager start   may do the job
2012-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	i forget, if you just uninstall the nvidia driver with: sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current   then you will automatically boot with nouveau =P
2012-05-30T17:06:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	Yeah!!
2012-05-30T17:07:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	Pierreb	see what is the version driver
