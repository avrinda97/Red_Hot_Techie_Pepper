2009-07-10T16:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hustlers_23	 so you did reboot after the nvidia drivers got installed?
2009-07-10T16:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hustlers_23	  the nvidia drivers are NOT instaleld on a newly installed system.. that tool does pop up a dialog on first logini recall and asks to install them. you then need to reboot.
