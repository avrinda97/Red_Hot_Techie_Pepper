2004-11-11T14:46:00.000Z	plovs	ogra	that was for you :)
2004-11-11T14:47:00.000Z	ogra	plovs	understood, but do we want to force copyright removal ?
2004-11-11T14:47:00.000Z	plovs	ogra	no but it is kind of stupod to have 3 lines of script plus 20 lines copyright
2004-11-11T14:47:00.000Z	ogra	plovs	i could imagine some people are not happy without credits
2004-11-11T14:48:00.000Z	plovs	ogra	try credit: ogra rulez, and next line: gpl v2 , something like that
2004-11-11T14:48:00.000Z	ogra	plovs	k, but i thik a (c) mailaddress@copyright.holder should be in
2004-11-11T14:49:00.000Z	plovs	ogra	 (c) mailaddress@copyright.holder + license type might be enough , and mail the person whose script it is, if he complains, we'll rewrite the script
2004-11-11T14:50:00.000Z	ogra	plovs	sounds good ;)
2004-11-11T15:12:00.000Z	ogra	plovs	there is a debian package for flash (just a downloader) ... i think this could be done for java too
