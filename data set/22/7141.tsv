2007-01-03T14:24:00.000Z	SurfnKid		is there a command
2007-01-03T14:24:00.000Z	SurfnKid		to get 10 files from an index website
2007-01-03T14:25:00.000Z	SurfnKid		instead of clicking on all of them??
2007-01-03T14:25:00.000Z	SurfnKid		like wget?
2007-01-03T14:25:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	Yes, wget, run the command man wget and you will find out what you need.
2007-01-03T14:27:00.000Z	SurfnKid	owh	so if i have a website http://x.com how would i download 10 files from there without telling it to, from a VT
2007-01-03T14:28:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	I know the answer, but I'm not a free oracle. You are here to learn. I suggested a learning path. That's all I'll do.
2007-01-03T14:29:00.000Z	SurfnKid	owh	I suggested wget look back
2007-01-03T14:30:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	I suggested the 'man wget' command.
2007-01-03T14:30:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	Then the next step is a for; done loop with an seq command :-)
2007-01-03T14:54:00.000Z	SurfnKid	owh	thanks for the encouragement
2007-01-03T14:55:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	Did you figure it out?
2007-01-03T14:55:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	I wasn't trying to be a PITA.
2007-01-03T14:55:00.000Z	SurfnKid	owh	just needed to look some more but the man file was huge
2007-05-08T12:40:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	You can run gnome-system-monitor
2007-05-08T12:41:00.000Z	SurfnKid	owh	but to see the "services" like apache and those
2007-05-08T12:41:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	They show on my screen.
2007-05-08T12:42:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	You also see the dependency tree, the children, etc.
2007-05-08T12:43:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	Yes.
2007-05-08T12:44:00.000Z	SurfnKid	owh	nice thx
2007-05-08T12:45:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	You can also right click on a process and see further information, like which files it has open etc.
2007-05-08T12:45:00.000Z	owh	SurfnKid	Enjoy.
