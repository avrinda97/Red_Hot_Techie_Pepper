2009-07-21T08:29:00.000Z	zopiac	NoelJB	32
2009-07-21T08:30:00.000Z	NoelJB	zopiac	for 32bit, I thought that the medibuntu repository handled it pretty well.  for 64 bit, I install directly from adobe labs.
2009-07-21T08:30:00.000Z	NoelJB	zopiac	have you tried using medibuntu?
2009-07-21T08:30:00.000Z	zopiac	NoelJB	i dont know nuch about it

2009-07-21T08:35:00.000Z	NoelJB	zopiac	oh wait, sorry.  that one is for acrobat.  But even so, you'll also need it for various media formats.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2009-07-21T08:36:00.000Z	NoelJB		I'll got find the adobe-flash stuff, which changed.  Are you under jaunty or intrepid?
2009-07-21T08:36:00.000Z	NoelJB		!flash
2009-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	NoelJB	zopiac	apt-get install flashplugin-installer
2009-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	NoelJB		that ought to do it.
2009-07-21T08:38:00.000Z	zopiac	NoelJB	package doesnt exist
2009-07-21T08:39:00.000Z	NoelJB	zopiac	make sure that you have universe enabled
2009-07-21T08:39:00.000Z	zopiac	NoelJB	how?
2009-07-21T08:40:00.000Z	NoelJB	zopiac	if you are using jaunty, click this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash and then click the link it says to click, and it should install for you.
2009-07-21T08:40:00.000Z	zopiac	NoelJB	would that work for hardy?
