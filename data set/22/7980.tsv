2005-12-11T07:59:00.000Z	xiaogil		why when i use firefox to see the page http://ndweb.iis.sinica.edu.tw/archaeo2_public/Include/GetImage_FileName.jsp?filename=R024974ccwa&type=3, i get a big image, and when i try to read it with wget, i get a small image ?
2005-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	 the page might be sending you a different image?
2005-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	it's amazing, isn't it ?
2005-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	how to download the big image with a command line then ?
2005-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	Try giving it the same user agent string
2005-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	what do you mean ?
2005-12-11T08:02:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	Every browswer sends information about what program it is to the website
2005-12-11T08:02:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	You need to send the same user agent string that firefox sends with wget
2005-12-11T08:03:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	how to know this user agent ?
2005-12-11T08:06:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	it seems that tcpdump could do the job but i don't understand how to use it...
2005-12-11T08:06:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	 I know there's a way to specify it.  Try reading the man pages?
2005-12-11T08:07:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	yes I'm trying, but I don't get it
2005-12-11T08:22:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	I tried the command 'wget --user-agent=""  http://ndweb.iis.sinica.edu.tw/archaeo2_public/Include/GetImage_FileName.jsp?filename=R024974ccwa&type=3' to download the big jpeg file, but still it download the small one, could you help me to make this work ?
2005-12-11T08:23:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	try setting the useragent equal to:
2005-12-11T08:24:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051202 Ubuntu/1.4.99+1.5rc3.dfsg-1ubuntu4 Firefox/1.5"
2005-12-11T08:25:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	no, it still downloads the small file
2005-12-11T08:25:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	Hmm.  Visit this web site
2005-12-11T08:25:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	http://www.cambiaresearch.com/cambia3/myuseragent/
2005-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	i tried with my user-agent (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; zh-CN; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051010 Firefox/1.0.7 (Ubuntu package 1.0.7)), but the result is the same, it doesn't work, the problem looks to come from somewhere else
2005-12-11T08:30:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	I'm out of ideas, sorry. :(
2005-12-11T08:30:00.000Z	xiaogil	Broam	is there another command than wget that could be more efficient ?
2005-12-11T08:31:00.000Z	Broam	xiaogil	I'm not really sure...
