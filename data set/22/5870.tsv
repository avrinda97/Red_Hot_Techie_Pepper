2007-08-10T08:39:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	hold on
2007-08-10T08:39:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	are you trying to use your Windows partition in Ubuntu?
2007-08-10T08:40:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	I don't like using Ubuntu LiveCDs for recovering Windows partitions... Knoppix is generally better for recovery work.
2007-08-10T08:41:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	if you've got an installed Ubuntu, the NTFS Configuration Manager in Add/Remove gives you a GUI for configuring ntfs-3g... but if someone here can help you with using it manually, then that's fine.
2007-08-10T08:42:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	well, Ubuntu is better as a desktop OS than Knoppix, and Knoppix is better as a recovery OS... but both can work.
2007-08-10T08:47:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	right click, create new folder?
2007-08-10T08:48:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	you must not have write access to the drive
2007-08-10T08:50:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	if you don't get this working (you probably will, but y'know) then try Knoppix, I find it a lot easier to write to drives and stuff with it
2007-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	my advice is to try Knoppix...
2007-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	have you tried sudo mkdir in the terminal?
2007-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	because it seems like you tried to use a nick that someone else was using... or maybe you were using it on a different client. Try /nick Purcupt
2007-08-10T09:15:00.000Z	cables	Purcupt_	it should be... you're using Xchat-gnome.
