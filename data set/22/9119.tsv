2005-08-27T16:16:00.000Z	pauldaoust		!tell pauldaoust about alsa-source
2005-08-27T16:17:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	you can also use '!tell me about alsa-aource' or '/msg ubotu alsa-source'
2005-08-27T16:17:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	oh, I never thought about pm'ing the bot, thanks!
2005-08-27T16:54:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	ifconfig CAN change it, but should not do it
2005-08-27T05:31:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	system -> prefs -> sound
2005-08-27T05:31:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	duh
2005-09-11T16:01:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	grab their sources and inspect the makefiles :)
2005-09-11T16:01:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	there's a good idea
2005-09-11T16:10:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	yeah
2005-09-11T16:10:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	nifty!
2005-09-11T16:10:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	any specific purpose for the cluster, or was it just for fun?
2005-09-11T16:10:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	grid computing / parallel programming
2005-09-11T16:11:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	sweeeet. so, folding proteins and predicting weather patterns and the like?
2005-09-11T16:11:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	no nothing like that, more like simulations
2005-09-11T16:11:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	no kidding. I should talk to mjr
2005-09-11T16:12:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	he hangs around in #ubuntu-offtopic too, we've had some discussions about this in that channel :)
2005-09-11T16:13:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	oh, there's an #ubuntu-offtopic channel? oops... didn't notice this was a help-only channel ^_^
2005-09-11T16:13:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	is that what you were hinting at when you said ETOPIC?
2005-09-11T16:13:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	yup
2005-09-11T16:14:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	so, just out of curiosity, what does 'ETOPIC' mean? I'm not familiar with that particular bit of lingo.
2005-09-11T16:14:00.000Z	Seveas	pauldaoust	unix/linux error codes usually have short, somewhat descriptive names that start with an E to indicate error, so ETOPIC would be a topic error
2005-09-11T16:15:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Seveas	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... gotcha. like the constants in a header file?
