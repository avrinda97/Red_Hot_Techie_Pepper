2010-07-13T08:47:00.000Z	usacomputertec	Jordan_U	tried

2010-07-13T08:49:00.000Z	usacomputertec		I could kill gmount iso
2010-07-13T08:49:00.000Z	usacomputertec		it appears to have worked
2010-07-13T08:50:00.000Z	usacomputertec		the -l worked
2010-07-13T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	usacomputertec	I love lazy umount, it's not used often but very usefull when you need it :)
