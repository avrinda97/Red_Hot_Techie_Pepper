2011-02-26T17:31:00.000Z	dissolution		Can any one confirm a thing for me, running ubuntu i386 and trying to make virtual box run win 7 x64 getting a message that my cpu cant handle x64 VT-x/AMD-v is enabled both in settings and in bios - Any help would be cool :)
2011-02-26T17:33:00.000Z	dissolution		because i got win 7 x64 as this is a alienware M15x x64
2011-02-26T17:33:00.000Z	dissolution		well i got random logouts in ubuntu x64
2011-02-26T17:34:00.000Z	dissolution		and tried now i386 as some forums told that would make it go away... tried allso changing my format from ext4 to ext3
2011-02-26T17:36:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	A common misconception about 64bit hardware: Having 64bit hardware/cpu does NOT mean you have VT-X/AMD-V as well, in other words: yes you can run a 64bit OS on 64bit hardware as a HOST, but a 64bit GUEST NEEDS VT-X/AMD-V to be active and enabled.
2011-02-26T17:36:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	take a look at http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=8669
2011-02-26T17:38:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	np... :) ... I've never tried using 64os on i386 structure
2011-02-26T17:40:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	that should be powerful enough... do you have the option turned on?
2011-02-26T17:42:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	then my guess is you need x64 host to run x64 guest... but am not that experienced
2011-02-26T17:46:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	oh wait, win7 is reporting that you don't have 64bit processor?
2011-02-26T17:49:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	it's easy to check, download some 64bit linux image and try booting that... :)
2011-02-26T17:52:00.000Z	dissolution	MeanEYE	 will see if that will do to... but as i sad, when i had ubuntu 10.4 x64 installed it worked with win 7 x64
2011-02-26T17:52:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	am not well experienced in that matter, so your guess is good as mine...
2011-02-26T17:54:00.000Z	dissolution	MeanEYE	thanks do for trying to help :)
2011-02-26T17:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	gah, I wish I was able to help... sorry about that...
2011-02-26T18:04:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	yes?
2011-02-26T18:19:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	random "logouts" can be X crashes... did you check the logs?
2011-02-26T18:21:00.000Z	dissolution	MeanEYE	i did... cant find any thing spes... tried to force a logout with with firefox < error.txt and browse see if that got any but no such luck
2011-02-26T18:22:00.000Z	dissolution	MeanEYE	couldent find any info there to help me, but yeah i think something is making the X crash
2011-02-26T18:26:00.000Z	dissolution	MeanEYE	tail -f /var/log/Xorg.0.log > error.txt will try that command and browse and see if i get an logout... might be luck and get some info be for it crash me!!
2011-02-26T18:27:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	you can always ctrl+alt+f1 :D and go to a system terminal without X :) ... and do that there... if X crashes, that terminal remains
2011-02-26T18:30:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dissolution	you use alt+f7 (or f8) to get back :D
