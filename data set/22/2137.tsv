2009-11-13T21:46:00.000Z	Alan502		Good Morning :); I recently installed xubuntu-desktop package in my ubuntu to obtain the xfce desktop environment. I dont know what happened but after a few logins, i cannot longer see the panel bar on the screen, i can just see the desktop with the icons. Can someone help me please?
2009-11-13T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 the panel may be started wutg the command 'xfpanel' I think... try xf<tab> in a terminal to see what commands exist.
2009-11-23T21:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	  normally the 32bit and 64bit packages are not interchangeable
2009-11-23T21:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 about every app ive ever used has 64bit versions now.
2009-11-30T19:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 try running them from the shell?  ive never seen a .i386 extension used on a executable. oris it a shell script?
2009-11-30T20:01:00.000Z	Alan502	Dr_Willis	it is suppossed to be a Urban Terror executable. The Urban Terror documentation says to run it as an executable. I have also tried to open the file with konsole and akonadi but i still get nothing :(
2009-11-30T20:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 you  may want to put it somewhere with no spaces in the paths also
2009-11-30T20:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 or 'cd' to where the binary is at.
2009-11-30T20:25:00.000Z	Alan502	Dr_Willis	i have cd to the directory where the binary is at, chmod it but still i am not allowed to access it apparently
2010-01-10T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 i woudl think it would use the normal http and ftp ports since it transfers files over http or ftp.
2010-01-10T12:43:00.000Z	Alan502	Dr_Willis	which are those?
2010-01-10T12:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 http is like 80 and i forget qwhat ftp is.. why does it matter?
2010-01-10T12:44:00.000Z	Alan502	Dr_Willis	by the way, i know this is off topic but do you know which ports are used by windows file sharing?
2010-01-10T12:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 those are 'samba/netbios ports'
2010-01-10T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 look in /etc/services
2010-01-10T12:45:00.000Z	Alan502	Dr_Willis	hmmm i think i'll keep googling thanks :D
2010-01-30T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 ive seen that mentioned in the ffmpeg/mencoder faq/docs befor.. but no idea on a gui tool to do it
2010-01-30T09:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 then you need to reencode it I imagine. ffmpeg/mencoder can do it  - but the subtitlke reabablity on youtube is often very poor
2010-02-04T06:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 from windows be sure to defrag/scandisk  - and depending on the version of windows.. windoes Does have tools to resize NTFS that can work a lot faster then gparted does for me
2010-02-04T06:32:00.000Z	Alan502	Dr_Willis	it's a clean windows installation, factory default.
2010-02-04T06:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Alan502	 so? still same procedure.. defrag/scan/try  the windows features..   then id try gparted again
2010-02-04T06:33:00.000Z	Alan502	Dr_Willis	ok :) thank you
