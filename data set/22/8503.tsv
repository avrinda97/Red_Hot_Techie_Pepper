2006-04-21T16:22:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	at which point does this message appear?
2006-04-21T16:23:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	if we talk in here there someone else might help you as well
2006-04-21T16:24:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	"after the screen went blue and stopped one I had partitioned" <- please say it again. In english please...
2006-04-21T16:27:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	I get it now
2006-04-21T16:29:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	Well, I can't really think of anything right now. If you could tell us what did the error message say exactly, you might get better help
2006-04-21T16:33:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	do you have any other OS installed? Windows perhaps?
2006-04-21T16:34:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	well it seems that you have to do manual partitioning
2006-04-21T16:34:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	through the installer I suppose
2006-04-21T16:38:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	try reading https://wiki.ubuntu.com/forum/installation/Partitioning
2006-04-21T16:38:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	maybe this will help you
2006-04-21T16:38:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	and this time, give some time to the installer. It Shouldn't hang up on you
2006-04-21T16:38:00.000Z	redguy	Rippawallet	take that hand off the reset switch or youll break your installation again
