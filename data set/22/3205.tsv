2010-07-07T00:10:00.000Z	Roasted		I do... nothing. :P
2010-07-07T00:11:00.000Z	Roasted		I love it.
2010-07-07T00:12:00.000Z	Roasted		lol?
2010-07-07T00:12:00.000Z	Roasted		well I guess our conversation is over.
2010-07-07T00:12:00.000Z	Roasted		so anyway drew212... find anything?
2010-07-07T00:13:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	Don't feel old, feel like an old master.  You don't need the crutch of a gui.
2010-07-07T00:14:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	haaa yeah. You gotta love GUI stuff though... it DOES make some things easier. However, I'm a terminal junkie, and "stuck in my ways". :P
2010-07-07T00:14:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	Sometimes guis are nice, but by and large, I only use them when I need to show something to a manager/boss/etc.
2010-07-07T00:17:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	hm, I didnt know that. What all can you put in rc.local? Is it just for bin bash scripts to run on startup?
2010-07-07T00:18:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	Yup.  It runs after all the other init scripts.  So if you want something non-standard to run on boot, you put it in there.
2010-07-07T00:18:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	its just for bin bash scripts though?
2010-07-07T00:19:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	It's for anything you want.  Just remember it runs as root :)
2010-07-07T00:20:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	Sometimes I use it to mount things that are finicky, sometimes I use it for configs.  SOmetimes I use it cause I've compiled a service that I was too lazy to write a proper init script for :)
2010-07-07T00:20:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	hmm, never had a need for it *yet* but its a good thing to know.
2010-07-07T00:21:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	That file, or one like it, is found in most every linux/BSD and other unix like system.
2010-07-07T00:22:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	not sure I understand. would I just add th ename of the bin/bash file to the end (but before the exit 0) of rc.local?
2010-07-07T00:22:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	I thought rc.local was a folder, and I'd just throw the script in. I didnt realize it was a text file.
2010-07-07T00:23:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	Yes.  You'd add it before the exit.  Technically rc.local _is_ a bash script, so you'd put your code in there, or call it from there, like you would in any other bash script.
2010-07-07T00:23:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	gotcha. good deal.
2010-07-08T23:54:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	Not I, but have you checked out to see if there's a freeradius channel, or forum?
2010-07-08T23:55:00.000Z	Roasted	Kyle__	just found the freeradius chat. only a dozen people in it but, Ill try my luck
2010-07-08T23:56:00.000Z	Kyle__	Roasted	Good luck :) I haven't used radius since the 90's, and then I didn't set it up.
