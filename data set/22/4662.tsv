2008-03-14T15:28:00.000Z	Blinkiz		It seems like one of my computer at home have changed IP address from my DHCP. I want to find out what the new IP number can be.
2008-03-14T15:28:00.000Z	Blinkiz		Am looking for a ping utility that can ping a subnet i specify. Please advice.
2008-03-14T15:28:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	did you try ping?
2008-03-14T15:29:00.000Z	Blinkiz	kennethr	Oh, can "normal" ping handle subnet as argument?
2008-03-14T15:29:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	use the -b
2008-03-14T15:30:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	but a firewall might stop a system from responding
2008-03-14T15:33:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	ping -b <broadcast address>
2008-03-14T15:34:00.000Z	Blinkiz	kennethr	I am on a different subnet that the computer I want to ping. Will it still work?
2008-03-14T15:34:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	what are you really attempting to do?
2008-03-14T15:35:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	do you administrate the DHCP server?
2008-03-14T15:36:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	ping!!!  see above
2008-03-14T15:37:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	ping. see above
2008-03-14T15:37:00.000Z	Blinkiz	kennethr	What do you mean? I have runned "ping -b 192.168.2.255" without any good result
2008-03-14T15:39:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	do you run the DHCP server?  Is the DHCP server a linux box or is it  your router?  or is it a DHCP server from your Internet Service PRovider?
2008-03-14T15:39:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	what (physically) is the DHCP server?
2008-03-14T15:40:00.000Z	Blinkiz	kennethr	Yes, I can login to the DHCP server and see what IP number that my stationary computer has. But I feel that writing a line in a prompt is far more faster.
2008-03-14T15:41:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	you can set the DHCP server to always assign the same address to your computer.  Just assign by MAC address
2008-03-14T15:41:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	does that make sense
2008-03-14T15:41:00.000Z	Blinkiz	kennethr	I know, but that is NOT my question today!
2008-03-14T15:42:00.000Z	kennethr	Blinkiz	OK, what is your objective and what is your question and what is your favorite color. ;)
2008-03-14T15:42:00.000Z	Blinkiz	kennethr	Whatever. Found the program "nmap" that will do what am looking for. "nmap -sP 192.168.2.0/24"
2008-03-14T15:43:00.000Z	Blinkiz	kennethr	Blue is a nice color :-)
