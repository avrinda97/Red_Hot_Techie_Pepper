2009-08-29T22:05:00.000Z	Jimmio		Hey all, I don't remember the person that helped me get my partition mounted in Ubuntu, but it's not allowing anything to be marked as executable now..
2009-08-29T22:07:00.000Z	Jimmio		nls=iso8859-1,umask=7133,dmask=7022,gid=jimmi,owner,uid=jimmi is my current Options portion of the fstab line. What do I do?
2009-08-29T22:07:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	What filesystem is this -- ext? ntfs? vfat?
2009-08-29T22:07:00.000Z	Jimmio	grawity	NTFS
2009-08-29T22:08:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	NTFS does not support Unix permissions, and it is not possible to mark something as "executable" if it's stored on a NTFS partition.
2009-08-29T22:09:00.000Z	Jimmio	grawity	Sorry, but it is. I do it all the time. .sh is executable. Says me. I have the masks set wrong I'll bet
2009-08-29T22:09:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	First, Unix doesn't use extensions - it uses the "executable" bit that's stored in the file system.
2009-08-29T22:10:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	Second, that "executable" bit CANNOT be stored in NTFS systems.
2009-08-29T22:10:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	There is simply NO PLACE to store it.
2009-08-29T22:10:00.000Z	Jimmio	grawity	I know that. So I either have to deal with everything trying to execute or nothing? How lame.
2009-08-29T22:11:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	NTFS simply is not for Unix. It's for Windows. Those are two very different operating systems.
2009-08-29T22:13:00.000Z	Jimmio	grawity	I realize. I also realize I need >4 gig files, I need to be able to use Windows with the partition, and I also realize I need to run shell scripts without CDing to it from a terminal.
2009-08-29T22:14:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	Must the scripts be on that filesystem?
2009-08-29T22:14:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	Can't you move them to, for example, ~/bin/  ?
2009-08-29T22:16:00.000Z	Jimmio	grawity	They have to be, yes. Why? I'm programming. The script builds. The scripts change for different projects. I also need to access it from Windows without using a file manager.
2009-08-29T22:17:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	Are there many scripts? You could make aliases in bash for them.
2009-08-29T22:18:00.000Z	Jimmio	grawity	It's easier to just change it so everything says it's executable. That's what I'm doing.
2009-08-29T22:18:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	So umask=7022?
2009-10-21T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	Metacity is very simple, it doesn't have much features.
2009-10-21T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	Btw, you might want to look at tiling WMs (dwm, awesome, wmii)
2009-10-21T17:51:00.000Z	Jimmio	grawity	I tried awesome. A bit more awesome than I can stand. dwm and wmii I've never heard of.
2009-10-21T18:25:00.000Z	grawity	Jimmio	Yeah, neither Xfce nor GNOME are WMs. (Btw, you can use Xfwm4 on GNOME and vice-versa)
