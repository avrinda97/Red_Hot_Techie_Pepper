2005-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		I like chocolate, so I like Ubuntu's color themes, so thats why I use Ubuntu.  Chocolate forever.
2005-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	JoshuaSyd		ahh, yea many people told me about debian was a great os
2005-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		I don't really think brown is a great color, but chocolate rules.
2005-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		actually, i switched my metacity theme to 'clean' i think, with the blueslate coloring, and then swapped the red and blue values in the default background color so it would be blue instead of brown
2005-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		so i can think of it like blue chocolate.
2005-04-29T10:15:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		olsen haha yeah pretty much.  and chocolate.

2005-04-29T10:16:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		anyway, to seriously answer the question JoshuaSyd, I like ubuntu because for desktop Linux, Debian is one of my favorites.
