2006-04-08T05:06:00.000Z	ubuntulnx		i'm trying to mount a thumb drive and get the following errors: mount: no medium found mount: no medium found error: could not execute pmount anyone have an idea?
2006-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	what is the exact commant you enter?
2006-04-08T05:09:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	maybe the device is not supported. what kind of thumbdrive is it exactly?
2006-04-08T05:10:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	try to open a terminal and type "sudo modprobe usb-storage"
2006-04-08T05:12:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	that is good. no errors is good
2006-04-08T05:12:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	is it plugged in and turned on?
2006-04-08T05:13:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	what is the filesystem? fat32?
2006-04-08T05:13:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	now that usb-storage is loaded, unplug and plug it in again. if you're in gnome it might detect it properly now
2006-04-08T05:16:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	try "dmesg" and see if you have any "sda: " or "usb-storage:"
2006-04-08T05:17:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	if you are lucky you should see something like this "usb-storage: device found at 2" and  "sda: sda1"
2006-04-08T05:25:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	line 282 in the pastebin show that the name of the device is sdb. let's try to mount it. "sudo mkdir /media/sandisk" "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb /media/sandisk"
2006-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	maybe it is not formatted
2006-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	can you run "gparted" and see if there is a filesystem on the disk?
2006-04-08T05:33:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	on the top right corner you should be able to select the disk
2006-04-08T05:33:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	/dev/sdb
2006-04-08T05:34:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	oh, you've got two thumbdrives connected?
2006-04-08T05:35:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	hmmm. dmesg say that sdb exist at least.
2006-04-08T05:36:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	does "sudo fdisk -l" show the device?
2006-04-08T05:39:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	maybe it need special drivers. can't really say. dmesg say that sdb is there but also that "sda: read capacity failed". strange
2006-04-08T05:40:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	have you seen any bug reports on google for that specifik sandisk?
2006-04-08T05:42:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	i'm out of ideas.
2006-04-08T05:43:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntulnx	np. good luck
