2012-03-02T10:35:00.000Z	MestreLion		hi! is it possible to achieve Wireless 150 MB/s using Ubuntu Netbook 10.04 (Atheros AR9285) ?
2012-03-02T10:37:00.000Z	MestreLion		My router already says its operating @ 150mbps (N-Only, 40MHz channel, etc), but connection manager (and ifconfig, iwconfig, etc) says Bit-Rate is 78 Mb/s
2012-03-02T10:38:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	how far are you from the router?
2012-03-02T10:38:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	walls? metal objects? em sources?,etc?
2012-03-02T10:41:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	some w/l cards are better than others, both inherently, and w/combination with of os, 'driver setup' you've consistently gotten good reception on the laptop in other environs (soft and hard?)
2012-03-02T10:42:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	sorry, didn't mean for that to sound like innuendo)
2012-03-02T10:42:00.000Z	MestreLion	hopstafarian	reception is fine... i mean, router and netbook are like less than 1 meter one fro the other, both on top of table... connection manager says strengh varies from 92% to 100%
2012-03-02T10:49:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	thanks...so i guess  the question was...the router is the new component, yes?
2012-03-02T10:52:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	new firmware on the router, or the bios?
2012-03-02T10:53:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	k, so what was the average w/l output of the router before the upgrade?
2012-03-02T10:55:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	so using metrics is out of the question...
2012-03-02T10:55:00.000Z	MestreLion	hopstafarian	I just wanted to know if ath9k is capable of 150 Mb/s speed, and if Connection Manager would report that
2012-03-02T10:56:00.000Z	MestreLion	hopstafarian	I can use any test/metrics you suggest (not sure how would I test the actual throutput speed.. maybe dragging a 1GB file from the other PC?)
2012-03-02T12:35:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	so if dhcp switchover is not the issue then you're sure they're on the same scheme and subnet?
2012-03-02T12:46:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	oh crap, if the switchover is that quick and its just the browser that is hitching th dls...that eff it, and jsut get proficient at wget on the cli?
2012-03-02T12:47:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	wget is pretty robust when it comes to resuming a dl?
2012-03-02T12:47:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	i know, but in the meantime...
2012-03-02T12:47:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	just saying..
2012-03-02T12:55:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	i'm no expert, but i run a relatively seamless 'roam' enterprise over a large 20K+ environs ...grocery store w/ stationary w/l scale tech, roaming rf handheld devices, various(unpredictable) mobile devices and laptops...all seems to work as close to seamlessly as  possible (never had a complaint, and i'm the only one to complain to, so pretty sure that it's not happening, or i know some pretty passive aggresive individuals...) and from that exp
2012-03-02T13:02:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	my point, was i think it can be, but you might have to reconsider placement...
2012-03-02T13:03:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	but then again, i'm considered kindof a tard by my peers..aka: people that actually know whats up...
2012-03-02T13:11:00.000Z	hopstafarian	MestreLion	what i usually do at this point, is build a scale model...either physically, or virtually...and i move shit around until it looks right, then i use the signal testing equip that i can get me hands on, to refine/debunk that preconception...if you have a smartphone, there are plenty of apps that will test and log your signal strength...
