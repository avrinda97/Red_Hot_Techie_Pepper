2011-12-07T06:05:00.000Z	bobweaver		what does the unity under ccsm even do ?
2011-12-07T06:05:00.000Z	bobweaver		besides get in the way ?
2011-12-07T06:06:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	compiz gives nice wigglies to the unity bars :)
2012-10-22T19:57:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	xubuntu?
2012-10-22T19:58:00.000Z	bobweaver	mbeierl	 again I like unity. dr_willis  it is a dell d610 with a pent M and 1 gig of ram
2012-10-22T19:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	I use ubuntustudio as a variant (as I use it for audio), and it seems to avoid a lot of the compisiting desktop in favour of processing power
2012-10-22T19:59:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	but I cannot help with unity, just putting alternatives out there
2012-10-22T19:59:00.000Z	bobweaver	mbeierl	 what DE is that using ?
2012-10-22T19:59:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	xfce
2012-10-22T20:00:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	I second dr_willis suggestion for unity2d on older hw
2012-10-22T20:01:00.000Z	bobweaver	mbeierl	 I could change libunity and dee and everything to make a unity 2d ? for 12.10 ?
2012-10-22T20:03:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	I have not started to play with 12.10 yet, so I don't know how well unity2d works there, sorry.  Looks like unity is starting to draw a line in the sand about hardware, I'd say
2012-10-22T20:04:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	Isn't unity2d a desktop log in option?  Or a meta-package
2012-10-22T20:05:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	I don't think you would need to change libunity by hand - there's a greeter option for it - or there was in 12.04...
2012-10-22T20:05:00.000Z	bobweaver	mbeierl	 If you instead attempt to wrest The pistol from the hand Then I would not be able to Equate my life with sand
2012-10-22T20:05:00.000Z	bobweaver	mbeierl	 there is no unity 2d because libunity will not work
2012-10-22T20:08:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	so I am getting confused then with what has changed in 12.10.  As mentioned, unfortunately, I don't have it yet, so I cannot confirm the existence of a working 2d
2012-10-22T20:09:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	oh: http://askubuntu.com/questions/134346/why-is-unity-2d-being-discontinued
2012-10-22T20:09:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	I should do a little reading before spewing off about 2d.  Apparently it is really gone, gone, gone from 12.10 and I cannot help there at all
2012-10-22T20:12:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	I'm following this with interest.  good luck!
2012-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	bobweaver	mbeierl	 kinda makes you think. what is going to run on arm ect ?
2012-10-22T20:16:00.000Z	mbeierl	bobweaver	I really don't know.  I've been playing with the raspberry pi and using a debian image there.
