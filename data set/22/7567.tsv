2006-02-28T07:45:00.000Z	help-me-pls	LinuxJones	breezer
2006-02-28T07:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	help-me-pls	is it a fresh install ?
2006-02-28T07:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	help-me-pls	are you dual booting with windows or some other os ?
2006-02-28T07:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones	help-me-pls	it's probably faster just to put the install cd back in and do a fresh install. You could spend days messing about trying to get your problem fixed.
2006-02-28T07:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	help-me-pls	is your hard drive making any odd noises like clicking sounds ?
2006-02-28T07:50:00.000Z	help-me-pls	LinuxJones	no
