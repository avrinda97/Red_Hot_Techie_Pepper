2008-08-13T16:53:00.000Z	TerrorBite		I can no longer see desktop notifications
2008-08-13T16:54:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	application specific?
2008-08-13T16:54:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	no, all libnotify notifications no longer appear
2008-08-13T16:54:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	I tried using the "notify-send" program to send a few, but nothing appeared
2008-08-13T16:56:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	ActionParsnip: any ideas?
2008-08-13T16:58:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	i "think" you need dbus-launch... apt-get install dbus-x11 ?
2008-08-13T16:59:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	already latest version
2008-08-13T17:01:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	you on your compiz-fusion? Notification work with metacity?
2008-08-13T17:01:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	it used to work with compiz-fusion, I'll try with metacity though
2008-08-13T17:02:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	Okay, can confirm it works with metacity
2008-08-13T17:03:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	wee :)
2008-08-13T17:03:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	i suggest you do something with compiz-fusion plugins for notification
2008-08-13T17:03:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	I don't know why it stopped working
2008-08-13T17:04:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	are you on hardy?
2008-08-13T17:08:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	yes, I'm on hardy
2008-08-13T17:09:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	goto CCMS, then make sure Workarounds plugin - notification daemon fix is ticked
2008-08-13T17:09:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	and Dbus plug in as well
2008-08-13T17:09:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	already checked those, the workaround was enabled, but the dbus plugin wasn't
2008-08-13T17:10:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	tick them :D
2008-08-13T17:10:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	workaround and dbus plugin both enabled now, still can't see notifications
2008-08-13T17:13:00.000Z	idyllic	TerrorBite	can you restart compiz? and another thing, tick the plugins from the CCSM, don't go into the plugin itself then tick
2008-08-13T17:14:00.000Z	TerrorBite	idyllic	already restarted compiz when I switched to metacity to see if it worked there, I'll restart it again anyway
