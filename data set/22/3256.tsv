2009-03-31T19:34:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	is your copy of WoW legal?
2009-03-31T19:34:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	all copies are legal lol
2009-03-31T19:35:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	then it's probably a false alarm
2009-03-31T19:35:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	the only other guess wolud be that Wow.exe got replaced
2009-03-31T19:36:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	yes but thats a bad idea x(
2009-03-31T19:37:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	then reinstall the gabme
2009-03-31T19:37:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	do you trust Blizzard? That is what this comes down to. If it is a legal copy then it won't be a problem
2009-03-31T19:38:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	reinstalling game do not solve my problem x(
2009-03-31T19:39:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	then there are only two possible problems: it isn't a legal copy, or the installer is infected.
2009-03-31T19:40:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	you can download the game from blizzard...and thats what i make
2009-03-31T19:40:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	then it is a false alarm :)
2009-03-31T19:41:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	its not  alarm...i cant start the game because -> Floating point eror i searched on Blizz forums and they say that its Parite.B
2009-03-31T19:42:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	then there isn't much anyone in the ubuntu chatroom can do.
2009-03-31T19:42:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	i changed privileges for writing to directory only for  a root but nothing :(
2009-03-31T19:45:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	oh and i dont have updated ClamAV....how i can update it ?
2009-03-31T19:45:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	theres update button but he say that i need to run it as root and i dont know how
2009-03-31T19:46:00.000Z	porter1	lollies	figure out the command for starting the ClamAV GUi, then press alt+F2 and type gksu "name of program"
2009-03-31T19:47:00.000Z	lollies	porter1	thank you
