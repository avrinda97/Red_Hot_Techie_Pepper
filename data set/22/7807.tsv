2006-04-14T06:59:00.000Z	hrh166		Password.. yes
2006-04-14T07:00:00.000Z	hrh166		when I did..error message
2006-04-14T07:00:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	do you have synaptic open?
2006-04-14T07:01:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	close it. It locks the apt directory so you cant update.
2006-04-14T07:12:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	are you still there?
2006-04-14T07:12:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	do a sudo apt-get update and give me the output.
2006-04-14T07:13:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	ok, no problem.
2006-04-14T07:13:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	 are you in kubuntu or ubuntu?
2006-04-14T07:14:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	ok, go to applications -> accesories -> Terminal
2006-04-14T07:15:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	in there, type sudo apt-get update
2006-04-14T07:16:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	give it to it. Your user pass.
2006-04-14T07:16:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	sudo runs the following command as root, with unlimited access. All GUI programs that ask for your password do this through sudo.
2006-04-14T07:17:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	otherwise it would not ask, but apt-get must be run as root.
2006-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	do a 'killall synaptic' (without the tick marks, of course).
2006-04-14T07:23:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	it could be that your username is not in the sudoers file, let me look into it.
2006-04-14T07:25:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	'sudo gedit /etc/setup.sh' and put what it prints in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	did you remember to remove the tick marks?
2006-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	 gedit /etc/setup.sh
2006-04-14T07:36:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	could you paste it at paste.ubuntu-nl.org ?
2006-04-14T07:37:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	wonderful. Reboot in recovery mode and do a passwd root.
2006-04-14T07:38:00.000Z	cartesian1984	hrh166	it lets you set the root password, it will make this process much less painful.
