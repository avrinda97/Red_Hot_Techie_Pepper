2006-12-10T08:18:00.000Z	finchx6	LjL	does this seveas give the same abilities (things such as wmv and mp3 codecs) as say, easy ubuntu or automatix??
2006-12-10T08:19:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	Seveas' is just a repository, it contains software that can be installed via the standard APT system that's the way software gets installed in Ubuntu. look at which software it's available from it - i don't know what Automatix or EasyUbuntu actually do
2006-12-10T08:22:00.000Z	finchx6	LjL	oh, ok...  they basically just make it easier... although, like I was told here and I've read other places, they can be unstable.  Basically, it works more similar to a windows installation.  It opens asking you which components and codecs, etc you'd like installed, then after you select them, it goes through doing all of the APT through the terminal and setting things up for you afterward
2006-12-10T08:23:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	i'm afraid Automatix goes through things that are much more black magic than plain APT (which is possibly the reason why it breaks so often). and i'm not sure how that's more like Windows... Synaptic does exactly the same thing: ask you what you want installed, you select the stuff, and then it installs it ;)
2006-12-10T08:24:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	for codecs, getting w32codecs from the seveas repository should mostly do the trick (although for some wmv you don't even need that, and following the standard howto works)
2006-12-10T08:26:00.000Z	finchx6	LjL	I compared it to windows because you don't manually go through the terminal, if that makes any sense.  Personally, I've only used automatix once, on my last install, which I ended up screwing up like the 10 before that, but all I use automatix OR easy ubuntu for is just like mp3 and whatnot abilities
2006-12-10T08:27:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	well, actually i don't think you *have* to go through the terminal to install things from Seveas' repository (and you certainly don't for installing most of the stuff that's mentioned in the howto). i don't have Synaptic, so i'm not sure how exactly it would be done, but i'm quite sure you can add repositories from there without touching the CLI
2006-12-10T08:28:00.000Z	finchx6		And if you're interested as to why I've screwed so many installs of it up, its because I can NOT get XGL and compiz to work
2006-12-10T08:29:00.000Z	finchx6		I've tried following every how-to and tutorial on the net, and either I'm a bigger idiot than I ever imagined, or these are out of date or incomplete
2006-12-10T08:29:00.000Z	finchx6		I don't know anything about AIGLX...  I'm hardcore newbie
2006-12-10T08:30:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	see, here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#head-155b53308911d4d3869b3650856a41550f57f891 it gives an example with precisely the seveas repository - no command line
2006-12-10T08:32:00.000Z	finchx6		Ljl: yeah, I had to use the repositories in one of the how-to's I was following trying to get XGL to actually work.  The only thing is that I'm not sure where I'd find things like mp3 abilities
2006-12-10T08:33:00.000Z	LjL		Ubotu, tell finchx6 about mp3 | finchx6, see the private message from Ubotu
2006-12-10T08:33:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	the relevant packages are mentioned on there. you can install them with apt-get from the console, or from synaptic, or whatever you like
2006-12-10T08:37:00.000Z	LjL		babelfish is your friend
2006-12-10T08:41:00.000Z	finchx6		Ljl: thanks for the links.  I'm going to have to format my linux partition and reinstall later anyway, so I'll be using this instead...  Although could you possibly help me with some questions concerning XGL and compiz, or AIGLX???
2006-12-10T08:42:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	i don't think so, i've never used those
2006-12-10T08:42:00.000Z	finchx6		i had it up and going for a short time period, and fell in love with the cube desktop
2006-12-10T08:44:00.000Z	finchx6		arwen, I'm in here trying to get help because I have yet to get it working and STAY working... so I guess you could say I've had a LOT of issues.. lol
2006-12-10T08:45:00.000Z	finchx6		And the cube desktop may be overrated to most, but when you're sitting here with a single 15" flat panel monitor setup, and you're a graphics artist...  it really comes in handy
2006-12-10T08:49:00.000Z	finchx6		i heard soon they were going to be adding edgy to shipit as well
2006-12-10T08:49:00.000Z	LjL	finchx6	doubt it
