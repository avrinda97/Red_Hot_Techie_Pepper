2012-01-17T17:05:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	GNOME is GTK+ based, but that doesn't mean DEs that aren't worn't run GTK+ apps.
2012-01-17T17:45:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	they integrate apps and offer services. and when you use a GNOME or KDE app, even if you use it in your favorite window manager, it still uses GNOME or KDE libraries and services, which are often fundamental to the working of the program.
2012-01-17T17:47:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	at first loginmanager is set to gdm, does that mean that gnome starts first and then quits again ?
2012-01-17T17:48:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	definte "GNOME"... GNOME is a set of things. GDM is part of GNOME, so you could say a part of GNOME starts and then quits (it really doesn't, the DM stays running).
2012-01-17T17:48:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	but i doubt GDM uses many GNOME libraries honestly.
2012-01-17T17:52:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	after getting logged in using openbox or e17 , when i notice the resource consumption it is about 130MB but i see that only about 15 or 20 mb is used by application.
2012-01-17T17:53:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	switching to a different display manager is an option.
2012-01-17T18:08:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	is it possible to stop DM from starting ?
2012-01-17T18:09:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	yes, update-rc.d can do that, at least i think that's still the way to do it
2012-01-17T18:10:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	but then you'll have to start X manually, are you sure you don't prefer to use a more lightweight display manager instead?
2012-01-17T18:12:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	window managers work with all display manager?
2012-01-17T18:12:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	yes
2012-01-17T18:13:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	if i start gnome from another DM , will it again start gdm? bcoz gnome depends on gdm.
2012-01-17T18:13:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	no it won't, and no it doesn't
2012-01-17T18:14:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	tell me some of the lightweight Dms available..
2012-01-17T18:14:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	recent versions of Ubuntu use "lightdm"
2012-01-17T18:18:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	anyother DMs?
2012-01-17T18:19:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	xdm, kdm, ldm, lxdm, wdm
2012-01-17T18:19:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	i can't switch sessions in xdm
2012-01-22T01:06:00.000Z	LjL	DragonSlay	?
2012-01-22T01:06:00.000Z	DragonSlay	LjL	that's for Myr
