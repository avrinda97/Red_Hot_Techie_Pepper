2009-04-30T18:36:00.000Z	Kalamot		so the question still stands, I would like to automatically turn off my pc after a torrent file has been downloaded ?
2009-04-30T18:36:00.000Z	hackoidz	Kalamot	Did You Start Downloading?
2009-04-30T18:37:00.000Z	Kalamot	hackoidz	did i start downloading what ?
2009-04-30T18:39:00.000Z	Kalamot	hackoidz	Well i want to start downloading and after donload is completed pc should shut down, but i do not find such option in transmission or deluge
2009-04-30T18:39:00.000Z	hackoidz	Kalamot	use a command line torrent client like that: torrentclient file.torrent; shutdown -h now
2009-04-30T18:40:00.000Z	Kalamot	hackoidz	will rtorrent do that  ?
2009-04-30T18:40:00.000Z	hackoidz	Kalamot	Yeah I think so
2009-04-30T18:41:00.000Z	hackoidz	Kalamot	No It Will Not Work
2009-04-30T18:41:00.000Z	Kalamot	hackoidz	it is such a basic function strange that no gui prog on linux can do that
2009-04-30T18:42:00.000Z	Kalamot	hackoidz	utorrent has that kind of option
2009-04-30T18:43:00.000Z	hackoidz	Kalamot	I Will Search For A Solution
2009-04-30T18:43:00.000Z	Kalamot	hackoidz	of course i know , my point was that i was surprissed linux progs dont have that option
