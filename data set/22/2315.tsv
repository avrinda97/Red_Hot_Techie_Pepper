2010-07-14T21:56:00.000Z	Tempus_Fugit		on a side note does anyone know any colleges or tech schools that offer extensive training in linux areas
2010-07-14T21:58:00.000Z	Tempus_Fugit		Does anyone know how I can get my gnome keyring back so I can login thru gnome in 10.04
2010-07-14T21:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 ive never noticed the gnome keyring affecting the logging in TO gnome.. just accessing your saved passwords in gnome.
2010-07-14T22:00:00.000Z	Tempus_Fugit	Dr_Willis	well its the login keyring I removed by accident and now when i goto login thru my login screen it says general communication error
2010-07-14T22:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 what was your path to the login keyring file?
2010-07-14T22:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 i just renamed mine.. let me log out and see if i can log back in. :)
2010-07-14T22:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 be right back
2010-07-14T22:04:00.000Z	Tempus_Fugit	Dr_Willis	please be patient with me as I am trying to learn all of this as fast as I can but i believe my path was cd gnome2/keyrings
2010-07-14T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 i just went to    /home/willis/.gnome2/keyrings/
2010-07-14T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 and moved the login.keyring file to some other name. and logged out.. i was able to log back in just fine. You may be looking in the wrong place for your 'problem'
2010-07-14T22:05:00.000Z	Tempus_Fugit	Dr_Willis	then ls -l .....then its said there were 4 files however only showed login.keyring and I was sposed to rm default.keyring and removed login.keyring instead
2010-07-14T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 all login.keyring did here was reset (delete) the rembered passwords to my ftp/samba/ssh servers
2010-07-14T22:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 i dont even have a 'default.keyring'

2010-07-15T04:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tempus_Fugit	 You did try making a new user and seeing if that new user can login?
