2007-11-16T22:55:00.000Z	JimmyDee		guys I could really use a hand here, it wont recognize a library I need, a little help?
2007-11-16T22:57:00.000Z	JimmyDee		looking for the command that will link a library to an executeable, i.e. the asterisk manager to libami.so.1
2007-11-16T22:58:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	that happens at compile time
2007-11-16T22:58:00.000Z	JimmyDee	sethk	that would be what time it is RIGHT NOW
2007-11-16T22:58:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	ok, that helps; can you be more specific?
2007-11-16T22:59:00.000Z	JimmyDee		I know its a ./configure --with-ami-lib=/usr/local/lib but that doesnt seem to work
2007-11-16T23:00:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	what are you building?
2007-11-16T23:00:00.000Z	JimmyDee		asterisk gui manager
2007-11-16T23:00:00.000Z	JimmyDee	sethk	and the asterisk people are snoozin
2007-11-16T23:01:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	try using the full path to the library, rather than just /usr/local/lib
2007-11-16T23:01:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	/usr/local/lib is the default, so that argument isn't going to change anything  :)
2007-11-16T23:01:00.000Z	JimmyDee	sethk	thats the directory the lib is installed in, I can see the dern thing, but it cant
2007-11-16T23:01:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	is it telling you it can't find the library?
2007-11-16T23:02:00.000Z	JimmyDee	sethk	ama: error while loading shared libraries: libami.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2007-11-16T23:02:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	I know that the library is there, I'm just saying that, since it's the default location, providing the directory to ./configure can't fix the problem.
2007-11-16T23:02:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	you mean when you are trying to run it?
2007-11-16T23:02:00.000Z	JimmyDee	sethk	good point
2007-11-16T23:02:00.000Z	JimmyDee	sethk	yes at execution time
2007-11-16T23:03:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	try        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2007-11-16T23:03:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	first do    echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH    see what the current value of it is
2007-11-16T23:04:00.000Z	JimmyDee	sethk	thank you kindly sir, its on like donkey kong now
2007-11-16T23:04:00.000Z	sethk	JimmyDee	excellent  :)
