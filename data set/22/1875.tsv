2009-12-14T08:10:00.000Z	xae8koo		I want to integrate facebookchat with my gnome desktop, any easy solution?
2009-12-14T08:10:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	use pidgin plugin or digsb
2009-12-14T08:10:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	digsby
2009-12-14T08:11:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	Apt-gettable?
2009-12-14T08:11:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	i believe, if not, google digsby
2009-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	It tells me to leave an email, because it isnt ready for Linux yey
2009-12-14T08:15:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	It is only windows :(
2009-12-14T08:15:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	really?
2009-12-14T08:15:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	im sorry, i saw the icon and never clicked it!
2009-12-14T08:15:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	It says so :P
2009-12-14T08:16:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	Thats allrigth, maybe I will get it for my windows box.
2009-12-14T08:16:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	i use more windows application currently, so i cant run Linux too much :(
2009-12-14T08:16:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	I am going all linux soon!
2009-12-14T08:17:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	good luck! try out some different WM's
2009-12-14T08:17:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	wm?
2009-12-14T08:17:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	window managers
2009-12-14T08:17:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	gnome, kde, xfce, fluxbox, openbox,etc..
2009-12-14T08:18:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	I used to prefer KDE, but now, with my new laptop it is only gnome for me. I love 4 gb ram!
2009-12-14T08:18:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	lol, lucky. I have 2.5 and i actually havent used ubuntu directly in a while now
2009-12-14T08:18:00.000Z	Nytek_	xae8koo	i kind of miss it
2009-12-14T08:20:00.000Z	xae8koo	Nytek_	It is pure awesomeness. I get my text directly on screen, and I can reply. If I get fb chat working I will be completly satisfied.
