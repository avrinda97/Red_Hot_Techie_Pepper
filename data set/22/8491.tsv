2005-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	snickkers		heyas. If I have more than soundcard installed in my box, how can I set which card generally gets sound played out of it?
2005-07-29T13:10:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	best to just disable the one you don't want
2005-07-29T13:10:00.000Z	snickkers	bob2	how?
2005-07-29T13:10:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	is one on-board?
2005-07-29T13:11:00.000Z	snickkers	bob2	yeah. I want my on-board one to be the one sound comes out of. I also have a tuner card, which has an in-built sound card, which KDE is trying to use to play sound
2005-07-29T13:12:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	which driver does it use?
2005-07-29T13:12:00.000Z	snickkers	bob2	as in ALSA?
2005-07-29T13:12:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	yes
2005-07-29T13:14:00.000Z	snickkers	bob2	in the volume mixer program, it says: Realtek ALC655 rev 0 (OSS mixer), and SiS SI7012 (ALSA mixer)
2005-07-29T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	ok
2005-07-29T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	you need to find out which one your tv tuner is using
2005-07-29T13:14:00.000Z	snickkers	bob2	I believe the SiS is the tuner card
2005-07-29T13:15:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	what does "lsmod | grep sis" print then?
2005-07-29T13:18:00.000Z	snickkers	bob2	pasted privately that lsmod output
2005-07-31T08:30:00.000Z	bob2	snickkers	read the README.Debian
