2010-07-06T14:02:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	not to change, but it's defined automatically, to make changes you have to put a custom firmware on it
2010-07-06T14:04:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	Cool, thanks.  You guys are blowing my DNS mind right now. :)
2010-07-06T14:06:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	those linksys routers are actually pretty awesome for the price, if you have one that can have the firmware replaced I highly recommend doing it.
2010-07-06T14:07:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	What do routers normally run?  If not some kind of Linux firmware?
2010-07-06T14:07:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	each manufacturer makes thier own
2010-07-06T14:08:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	That's lame.  Especially since all that effort is moot when people like you wipe out their firmware. :)
2010-07-06T14:09:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	yup, companies are kinda stupid like that.
2010-07-06T14:10:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	the version on the bottom of the router, has to be v5 or less
2010-07-06T14:10:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	unless the model number of the router has an L in it, which means linux compatible
2010-07-06T14:11:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	DRT54GST V1
2010-07-06T14:12:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	that might be too new to root
2010-07-06T14:13:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	check some of the linksys distro pages they usually have a list of compatible models and versions
2010-07-06T14:13:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	I'll do that.  I'm not necessarily interested in actually doing it, but I'd like to understand the process and why it's done.  Thanks for the tips!
2010-07-06T14:22:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	Does it actually double the amount of RAM *used* or the amount of RAM *addressable*?
2010-07-06T14:23:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	every memory address becomes double the size it was, everything doubles in ram
2010-07-06T14:24:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	If an address that was 0xabcdef11 is now 0x00000000abcdef11, how has that doubled memory use?
2010-07-06T14:24:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	Having just been schooled in DNS I'm trying to be cautious here. ;)
2010-07-06T14:26:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	Every address is twice the size it was at 32 bits, so allocating one address that used to be 32 bits of memory is now 64 bits of memory
2010-07-06T14:28:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	vlt: Oh, because what used to be enough space for two addresses in 32-bit is now only enough for one in 64-bit.
2010-07-06T14:28:00.000Z	Dulak	maxwellian	exactly
2010-07-06T14:28:00.000Z	maxwellian	Dulak	Man, I sure know a lot less than I think I know. ;)
