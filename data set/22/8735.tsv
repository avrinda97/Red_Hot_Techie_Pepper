2005-05-29T15:40:00.000Z	ivanson		i wish i read the "dont use breezy" before i started using it ;) lol
2005-05-29T15:42:00.000Z	ivanson		i want to move the cursor in the terminals. what is the name of that program?
2005-05-29T15:43:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	You mean with a mouse?
2005-05-29T15:43:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	gpm
2005-05-29T15:43:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	yep
2005-05-29T15:49:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	try telling that to lots of programs that REQUIRE a root password
2005-05-29T15:49:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	the only way to configure driverloader is to have a root password since it is a web frontend and not an app you just run
2005-05-29T15:52:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	there was a post in forums specifically telling you NOTE to upgrade this week
2005-05-29T15:52:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	Should have read the forums! lol
2005-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	well im not much of a forum reader ;)
2005-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	i will just downgrade argh ;) bummer
2005-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	lol ya ... why are you wanting to try breezy? to get newer software?
2005-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	nope. isnt like that at all :) just another "time-waster"... i have too much bandwidth lol
2005-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	lol
2005-05-29T15:55:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	Ya. ... me too. Im installing kubuntu in a vmware session just to try it. Dont want to ruin my install by installing KDE ... EVEN if I can just use debfoster to clean it again
2005-05-29T15:55:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	duh :P kde is cool, alltough a bit too cool for me.. it has too much functions to be functionable for me :P i need the less flashy interface
2005-05-29T15:56:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	im total gnome user ^^
2005-05-29T15:56:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	it is too messy. 10 million ways to do the same things ... and all 10 million things in places you would not expect them
2005-05-29T15:56:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	yep... well thats life ;) about choices
2005-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	I like xfce4 myself
2005-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	ivanson	nuOpus	xfce with nautilus is nice :) i need icons ;)
2005-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	nuOpus	ivanson	You should use vmware or qemm to try breezy in a virtual machine
