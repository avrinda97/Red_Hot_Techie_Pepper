2006-08-14T07:00:00.000Z	Posty_		Is there a way to disable my AC97 in Ubuntu without disabling it in the BIOS?
2006-08-14T07:01:00.000Z	scrappy_	Posty_	i guess you might blacklist the driver
2006-08-14T07:01:00.000Z	Posty_		So I have to unplug my audio cord whenever I want to run GTA3 and stuff
2006-08-14T07:01:00.000Z	Posty_		:P
2006-08-14T07:01:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	how so?
2006-08-14T07:02:00.000Z	Posty_		I just started using Ubuntu not long ago, and this is my first Linux experience. So I don't know all the ins and outs yet
2006-08-14T07:03:00.000Z	scrappy_	Posty_	ive never used it but you might do 'gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist'  and type blacklist drivername
2006-08-14T07:05:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	how do I find the driver name for the AC97?
2006-08-14T07:05:00.000Z	scrappy_	Posty_	you can type lsmod to see current loaded drivers
2006-08-14T07:06:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	so I'm guessing that this would be the one I would blacklist?

2006-08-14T07:06:00.000Z	scrappy_	Posty_	bear in mind im not saying it will def work but yes
2006-08-14T07:07:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	thanks. Should I just logout/login to see if it worked?
2006-08-14T07:09:00.000Z	scrappy_	Posty_	might reboot
2006-08-14T07:09:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	will do
2006-08-14T07:09:00.000Z	Posty_		I'll be back and tell you the result
2006-08-14T07:09:00.000Z	Posty_		;)
2006-08-14T07:13:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	didn't work
2006-08-14T07:14:00.000Z	Posty_		So what's that command again? Just so I can undo the change
2006-08-14T07:14:00.000Z	scrappy_	Posty_	i kinda doubted :) i guess you can just sudo modprobe -r modulename
2006-08-14T07:14:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	what exactly does that do?
2006-08-14T07:15:00.000Z	Posty_	scrappy_	mind if you explain this stuff in a PM so I can keep track of it?
