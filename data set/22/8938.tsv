2005-04-29T16:12:00.000Z	phanter		linux will not capture the sounds recorded by the microphone. It does send the recordings directly to the speakers. What could be wrong?
2005-04-29T16:13:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	I went through that problem about 24 hrs ago.
2005-04-29T16:13:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	what soundcard do u have? Any idea?
2005-04-29T16:13:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	wait i'll check
2005-04-29T16:20:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	you have an idea how to find that out (i have an ibm thinkpad t42)
2005-04-29T16:21:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	do something for me. In a terminal type "lsmod |grep snd"
2005-04-29T16:22:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	did that. it is an AC97, do you need the rest of the output as well?
2005-04-29T16:22:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	do u see "emu" in there anywhere? like "snd-emu10k1" is what I'm hoping for.
2005-04-29T16:23:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	no there is nothing with emu in it
2005-04-29T16:24:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	damn. Ah well. How I solved it was to install a package called aumix-gtk. It's basically a good gui for your sound mixer. Try installing it, and boosting the "line-in" option on the panel.
2005-04-29T16:25:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	oke i will try that
2005-04-29T16:30:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	u didn't try aumix-gtk? (btw, I think that's weird too.)
2005-04-29T16:30:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	yes just installed it, but how do i run it :)
2005-04-29T16:30:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	$aumix-gtk
2005-04-29T16:30:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	$aumix
2005-04-29T16:32:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	aumix does not change the status of my problem (sorry to tell you)
2005-04-29T16:33:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	did u try pumping up i-gain ?
2005-04-29T16:34:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	hey wait... there we are... I am off and running eeuh recording
2005-04-29T16:34:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	good. same problem. well, bad actually. There shouldn't be a problem in the first place.
2005-04-29T16:35:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	hmm you use skype?
2005-04-29T16:35:00.000Z	cens0red	phanter	no. What is skype?
2005-04-29T16:35:00.000Z	phanter	cens0red	never mind :) thanks anyway
