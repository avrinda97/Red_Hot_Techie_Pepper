2008-03-30T06:34:00.000Z	Aragorn		does anybody know if itunes will be available in an upcoming release of ubuntu?
2008-03-30T06:35:00.000Z	Aragorn		deniz_ : wine wont do it
2008-03-30T06:35:00.000Z	Aragorn		exactly mackid
2008-03-30T06:35:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	rhythmbox is decent, and Banshee is better but a PITA to compile and get working as of now
2008-03-30T06:35:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	i use rhythmbox a bit. but there are reasons why i need itunes
2008-03-30T06:36:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	do you buy stuff from iTunes, is that why you need it?
2008-03-30T06:38:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	yes and its too much trouble for me to back up all my music i bought from itunes store, get it all on disc, and then get it all on rhythmbox and THEN download lastfm for ubuntu, etc.
2008-03-30T06:38:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	a last.fm plugin comes pre-installed with rhythmbox
2008-03-30T06:39:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	also, i do something called iPod scrobbling. thats the main reason right there. i can only use itunes to do that
2008-03-30T06:39:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	it sounds like you should use iTunes.
2008-03-30T06:39:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	i do :)
2008-03-30T06:39:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	well then, it sounds like the issue is settled.
2008-03-30T06:40:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	well, then don't use iTunes. your choice.
2008-03-30T06:41:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	yes
2008-03-30T06:43:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	i scrobble with rhythmbox in 7.10.. just get a mac and use iTunes on that, then you avoid using windows. or install VMWare. either way.
2008-03-30T06:44:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	you cant use itunes without windows
2008-03-30T06:44:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	join #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-03-30T06:45:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	that's not true, i use it in rhythmbox
2008-03-30T06:46:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	you scrobble in rhythmbox, correct?
2008-03-30T06:46:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	have you ever tried iPod scrobbling in Rhythmbox?
2008-03-30T06:47:00.000Z	mackid	Aragorn	I don't sync my iPod with my linux box, I have a Mac and I use that.. I have an iPhone and I seriously doubt that work on linux to its full capacity (syncing address book, calendar, videos, etc)
2008-03-30T06:47:00.000Z	Aragorn	mackid	ok, thanks
