2005-11-21T14:32:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	that's one reason i always power down,  the other two are conservation and excess heat.
2005-11-21T14:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	I never power down (unless upgrading). :p
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	if you are not running a server, you should.     saves energy.
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	I live in Norway. We've got plenty of energy.
2005-11-21T14:34:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	oh,,,, sorry it must be the rest of the world i was thinking about.....
2005-11-21T14:34:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	Common mistake. :)
2005-12-22T12:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	/exec?
2005-12-22T12:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	or sata
2005-12-22T12:39:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	xchat ?
2005-12-22T12:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	I really don't think much of it. Then again I fell in love with irssi because my IRC client is running on another machine which hasn't got X installed.
2006-03-23T12:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	cat /proc/cpuinfo|grep bogomips
2006-03-23T12:19:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	why ?   it reports dubble the real spead
2006-03-23T12:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	I am just curious. :)
2006-05-04T15:10:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	I read that it's hot in africa.
2006-06-10T10:02:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	yes.  but in ubuntu (default kernels)  all root files systems must have initrd to mount them.... no fs support other than cram in the kernel.
2006-06-10T10:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	Thanks. I was not aware of that.
2006-06-10T10:03:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	yeah it kinda stinks imo cant even mount ext2 on /dev/hda1  hehhe how weak is that....  ;/
2006-06-10T10:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	Well with the wide variety of filesystems that are availible it is a sound way to keep the kernel size down to a minimum.
2006-06-10T10:06:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	kernel small initrd large.  initrd.img is over 5m now  they could have included ext# fs support for only a few k of kernel space
2006-06-10T10:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	Isn't initrd unloaded from memory after it's done with?
2006-06-10T10:09:00.000Z	intelikey	BlueEagle	yeah but that doesn't fix the boot issues caused by the initrd.img size.  you can't use loadlin to kick off ubuntu from windows because of the initrd size and the nessecity of loading it.
2006-06-10T10:10:00.000Z	BlueEagle	intelikey	Ahh, yes. That's a valid point. I didn't even concider that.
