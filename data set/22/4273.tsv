2008-06-29T19:42:00.000Z	BlackRece		hiya, i'm back
2008-06-29T19:43:00.000Z	BlackRece		can i setup firestarter to ics with eithernet (one pc) and wirles (two laptops) ?
2008-06-29T19:44:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	you can but you shouldn't. use ipmasq
2008-06-30T00:59:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	apt-get install ipmasq dnsmasq
2008-06-30T01:00:00.000Z	BlackRece	wols_	I followed this guide http://www.ubuntugeek.com/sharing-internet-connection-in-ubuntu.html#more-182
2008-06-30T01:00:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	what network interfaces do you have?
2008-06-30T01:00:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	that guide is useless
2008-06-30T01:01:00.000Z	BlackRece	wols_	opps. well, eth0 ip 192.168.2.1 internal net and eth1 ip dhcp internet to this ubuntu
2008-06-30T01:02:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	so ipmasq will work
2008-06-30T01:02:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	you must have two working network interfaces for it to work
2008-06-30T01:03:00.000Z	BlackRece	wols_	i've got 3 i wanna use, eth1 is the internet coming in and eth0 is net traffic to internal network
2008-06-30T01:03:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	that'S fine
2008-06-30T01:04:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	it's started automatically. it asks you when it should start when you install it
2008-06-30T01:10:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	what IP does your internal ubuntu device have and what IP does your XP box have?
2008-06-30T01:11:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	and gateway and DNS on XP?
2008-06-30T01:12:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	it blocks pings by default
2008-06-30T01:12:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	can XP ping ubuntu?
2008-06-30T01:14:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	if XP has no gateway it cannot work
2008-06-30T01:15:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	ubuntu is your XP gateway
2008-06-30T01:15:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	NO
2008-06-30T01:18:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	it's automatic. ipmasq masqs all devices
2008-06-30T01:21:00.000Z	wols_	BlackRece	dnsmasq can handle dhcp if you enable it. /etc/dnsmasq.conf
