2007-10-29T06:56:00.000Z	aboo0ood		hi all , Gutsy fails to mount the CD/DVD drive , any ideas ?
2007-10-29T06:57:00.000Z	aboo0ood		it says : "mount: special device /dev/hda does not exist"
2007-10-29T06:57:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	Is that set up in /dev/fstab? It's probably /dev/sd* in Gutsy
2007-10-29T06:58:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	gnuts , genefitz : this is the line in fstab  : /dev/hda        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
2007-10-29T06:59:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	Try commenting out that line. It should work without an fstab entry
2007-10-29T07:00:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	If you really want an fstab entry, you can discover how it mounts when commented and modify fstab accordingly
2007-10-29T07:00:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	i need to reboot i guess , but i have a problem in my kernel , it acts nondeterministically , most of the times it gives me sth like : Disabling irq #20
2007-10-29T07:01:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	other times it works fine
2007-10-29T07:01:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	Sounds like flaky hardware
2007-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	i used to face the same problem in Feisty , googling the problem gave me an indication that it's a kernel bug
2007-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	i am rebooting anyways :) brb
2007-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	i rebooted , what's next ?
2007-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	After commenting the CD line in fstab, can you mount?
2007-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	u mean using terminal ? mmm i am trying to issue a mount /dev/hda /media/cdrom command but there's no /dev/hda here
2007-10-29T07:10:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	I mean by just inserting the CD (Assuming you're using Gnome)
2007-10-29T07:10:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	yes i am using Gnome but it's not mounting it
2007-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	any ideas ?
2007-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	one minute...
2007-10-29T07:17:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	try /dev/cdrom, /dev/cdrom0, /dev/hd* (whatever options may be possible), /dev/sd*, etc, until you find the one that works
2007-10-29T07:17:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	You _might_ find some useful symlinks under /dev/disk
2007-10-29T07:23:00.000Z	aboo0ood	mssever	should i specify the filesystem type when he asks me to ?
2007-10-29T07:24:00.000Z	mssever	aboo0ood	Yes. CDs use iso9660
