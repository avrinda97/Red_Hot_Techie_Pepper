2008-11-22T23:14:00.000Z	blackpearl		IDE primary slave partition is "UNALLOCATED" i can see this using GPARTED....what should i do? I am not able to use IDE Primary Slave partition ???
2008-11-22T23:15:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	if it's unallocated space, then it's not a partition to begin with - it's space allocated to no partition.
2008-11-22T23:15:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: thanx for correcting.
2008-11-22T23:16:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	you can most certainly create a partition in it, with the very gparted
2008-11-22T23:16:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: BUT i want use that "unallocated" space
2008-11-22T23:16:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	then create a partition.
2008-11-22T23:16:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: it should be extended OR primary ?
2008-11-22T23:17:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	depends. you can have up to 4 primary partitions. if you need more than 4, one of them will have to be extended
2008-11-22T23:18:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: i mean if the alloacted space is on IDE Primary Slave ...should i make is Priamry Or Slave ?
2008-11-23T23:02:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	for starters, in Linux program files aren't sorted according to which program they belong to - rather, they're sorted according to their purpose. so for example, in /usr/share/doc you'll find the documentation for all programs, in /etc the configuration files...
2008-11-23T23:05:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	that's probably not a good idea, but you can put the "nopasswd" options in the sudo config file, which can be edited with "visudo"
2008-11-23T23:06:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	"man sudoers" will give you information and examples. hit "/" and type "nopasswd" to search and highlight
2008-11-23T23:07:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: kindly tell is this the commnd to be run in terminal man sudoers ??
2008-11-23T23:08:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	"man sudoers", yes. it will give you the instructions on editing the sudoers file
2008-11-23T23:09:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	then to actually edit it, it's "sudo EDITOR=nano visudo"
2008-11-23T23:10:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: thats good one.
2008-11-23T23:50:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	"man update-alternatives" will probably give you a clue
2008-11-23T23:58:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	"man dpkg" will tell you
2008-11-23T23:59:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: it took me some time to understand that "man" is for manual...i thought you are using in general..sorry
2008-11-24T00:03:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: once terminal is started after "man"command how to get back command prompt without closing terminal window ?
2008-11-24T00:04:00.000Z	LjL	blackpearl	hit Q
2008-11-24T00:05:00.000Z	blackpearl	LjL	: it was simple
