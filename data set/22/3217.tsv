2009-03-22T03:48:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	wait what?  you're trying to erase a DVD-R?
2009-03-22T03:42:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	I doubt that
2009-03-22T03:43:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	CD or DVD?
2009-03-22T03:44:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	dvd/cd(vcd)
2009-03-22T03:44:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	is the disk a DVD or CD?
2009-03-22T03:44:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	i've tried dvd and cd
2009-03-22T03:45:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	do you have an ISO or what?  what kind of file are you using as your source?
2009-03-22T03:47:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	video files
2009-03-22T03:47:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	ah, you're probably having to convert them to MPEG, and don't have what you need to do that
2009-03-22T03:47:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	try installing ffmpeg
2009-03-22T03:48:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	I cannot erase the disc without an error.  Before I even begin to write to the disc!
2009-03-22T03:49:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	I've tried to burn straight.  Tried to erase first.  Nothing works
2009-03-22T03:50:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	install ffmpeg, and try burning straight again
2009-03-22T03:51:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	ffmpeg is installed already.  On all machines
2009-03-22T03:52:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	what format are your source files?
2009-03-22T03:53:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	does it matter?  I cannot blank the discs without an error.  They are .avis
2009-03-22T03:53:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	I'm still not sure why you're trying to blank the disc
2009-03-22T03:54:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	I'm not sure then, I haven't seen this problem before
2009-03-22T03:54:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	if I don't, it still gives me an error....cannot write to the disc with the current plugins
2009-03-22T03:54:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	if it was on one machine, I would have no problem at all.
2009-03-22T03:54:00.000Z	mhall119	keithclark	I'm pretty sure it's having a problem converting your source file to the format needed for DVD (mpeg2 I think)
2009-03-22T03:56:00.000Z	keithclark	mhall119	have you tried burning a dvd+rw, dvd +r with 8.10?
