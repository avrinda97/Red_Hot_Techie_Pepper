2009-04-24T23:56:00.000Z	fritz_		is compiz running brk3?
2009-04-24T23:57:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	no, it wont start up it says xgl not present
2009-04-24T23:57:00.000Z	fritz_	brk3	what intel chipset do you have? many have been blacklisted, like 965
2009-04-24T23:57:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	im not sure :/
2009-04-24T23:57:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	how can i check
2009-04-24T23:58:00.000Z	brk3		everythings running realllly slowly
2009-04-24T23:58:00.000Z	fritz_		then try: echo SKIP_CHECKS=yes >> ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager
2009-04-24T23:58:00.000Z	fritz_		and try to load compiz
2009-04-24T23:58:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	the thing im worried about is, even metacity is a lot slower than it used to be
2009-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	even the irc text windows is lagging while scrolling
2009-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	fritz_	brk3	a lot of people are nagging about performance regressions with intel chipsets, especially with i965
2009-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	fritz_		the release notes have some tips that might help
2009-04-24T23:59:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	why would they blacklist a graphics card
2009-04-25T00:00:00.000Z	fritz_	brk3	some cards are blacklisted in compiz only, because of some stability issues
2009-04-25T00:01:00.000Z	fritz_		which isn't surpsrising given all of the intel updates we've seen (gem, uxa)
2009-04-25T00:06:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	echoing that into compiz allowed it start, but ir eally need to do something about this graphocs acceleration. its so slow i can hardly use things :(
2009-04-25T00:08:00.000Z	brk3		does anyone know how to enable acceleration for intel cards?
2009-04-25T00:08:00.000Z	fritz_	brk3	try adding Option "MigrationHeuristic" "greedy" to the device section in your xorg config. If that doesn't work, you may just have to wait for some new intel drivers
2009-04-25T00:08:00.000Z	fritz_		there are already some upstream patches floating around
2009-04-25T00:08:00.000Z	fritz_		but you probably won't see anything come through for a few weeks
2009-04-25T00:08:00.000Z	brk3	fritz_	the ones in gutsy worked perfectly. this is a joke :(
2009-04-25T00:09:00.000Z	fritz_	brk3	those are the breaks with upgrading software, some things break, but they generally get fixed
