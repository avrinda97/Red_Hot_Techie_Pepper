2010-03-19T05:09:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	coop	check this out ; check the log at /var/log/Xorg.0.log by opening terminal and typing "nano /var/log/Xorg.0.log"

2010-03-19T05:17:00.000Z	coop	paranoid_pedlar	i dont see any mention of synaptics
2010-03-19T05:18:00.000Z	coop	paranoid_pedlar	is there a "find"
2010-03-19T05:19:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	coop	press ctrl X, don't save, just exit. then press up, and replace nano with gedit, and click edit from the menu, and find from the dropdown
2010-03-19T05:20:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	coop	I'm going for a smoke, brb
2010-03-19T05:35:00.000Z	coop	paranoid_pedlar	searched in gedit, for "synaptics" nothng
2010-03-19T05:37:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	coop	just a sec,
2010-03-19T05:40:00.000Z	coop	paranoid_pedlar	i go to pckg mgr and says i have xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
2010-03-19T05:41:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	coop	it's probably just an update bug. try these commands and log out of gnome, then log back in. http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-tiphow-to-removeinstall-and-reconfigure-xorg-without-reinstalling-ubuntu.html
2010-03-19T05:49:00.000Z	coop	paranoid_pedlar	i tried what u suggested, touchpad still doesnt work?
2010-03-19T05:50:00.000Z	paranoid_pedlar	coop	If someone can tell coop how to change the timing of grub2 menu, and then coop, use the older kernal in the menu and see if it works
2010-03-19T05:53:00.000Z	coop	paranoid_pedlar	could this really been an update issue. not sure i get the grub2 thing?
