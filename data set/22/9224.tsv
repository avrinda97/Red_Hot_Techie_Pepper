2005-02-09T11:21:00.000Z	snowblink	crimsun	pretty empty
2005-02-16T07:04:00.000Z	crimsun	snowblink	if it's the missing binary issue in Hoary, I know about it.
2005-02-16T07:05:00.000Z	snowblink	crimsun	you have me mixed up with someone else
2005-02-16T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	snowblink	I don't think so; I was simply stating that preemptively.
2005-02-16T07:06:00.000Z	snowblink	crimsun	I'm curious. What was I going to ask?
2005-02-16T07:06:00.000Z	crimsun	snowblink	note the "preemptively."
2005-02-16T07:07:00.000Z	snowblink	crimsun	pre-emptive kernel issues in something. I'm sorry. I'm very lost. :(
2005-02-16T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	snowblink	(this discussion has nothing to do with kernel preemption but rather my stating something that you might have found informative if you had intended to ask about the missing-binary issue in the gtk-gnutella package)
2005-02-16T07:09:00.000Z	snowblink	crimsun	right. I'm using gtk-gnutella just fine. There is a missing binary?
2005-02-16T07:09:00.000Z	crimsun	snowblink	in Hoary, yes. It's "fixed" pending upload.
2005-03-03T14:16:00.000Z	crimsun	snowblink	no, tentatively - and the only thing that's certain is that it will always be valid to refer to it as "Hoary+1"

2005-06-11T12:34:00.000Z	snowblink	crimsun	cheers. So this just dumps debs that are already installed?
