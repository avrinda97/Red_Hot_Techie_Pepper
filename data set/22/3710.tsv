2008-12-03T03:33:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	you need to use fdi files.  See ubottu
2008-12-03T03:34:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	sry, but often i think noone was reading my questions so i post them from time to time, hoping anybody will read them
2008-12-03T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	ok, but does what I said answer your question?
2008-12-03T03:35:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	Ã¤hm, not really. how exactly do i do this with fdi files?
2008-12-03T03:36:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	it's explained in ubottu's link.  Poke me if you're not sure what to do after reading it
2008-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	first: which one link? ubottu gave me 2 links, one about the IRC Code of Cunduct and one about X Server Resolutions... but my prob is the touchpad not the monitor :P
2008-12-03T03:39:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	i think u sent the wrong link...
2008-12-03T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	sure, just https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/ (Input device Configuration)
2008-12-03T03:41:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	thx. no its the right one :) (the link before was about screen res...)
2008-12-03T03:41:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	*now
2008-12-03T03:41:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	yep, you are right
2008-12-03T03:48:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	ok i changed my /etc/hal/fdi/policy/shmconfig.fdi to this: http://nopaste.biz/57414 but it does still not work.
2008-12-03T03:48:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	did you restart hal and X?
2008-12-03T03:49:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	invoke-rc.d hal restart
2008-12-03T03:49:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	sry i forgot to poke you

2008-12-03T03:57:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	ok after restarting X AND hal it works, but at first the EdgeScroll feature is still activated, allthough i deactivated it in the fdi as youve seen. second its not working thaat great. is there any possibility to make it smoothier?
2008-12-03T03:58:00.000Z	jrib	GreenDelta	don't know about that
2008-12-03T03:59:00.000Z	GreenDelta	jrib	ok, but anyway, thousand thanks to you for your help and keept it on going!! u do perfect work here :)
