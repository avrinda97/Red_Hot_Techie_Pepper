2009-07-06T07:57:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	open Places > Home Folder
2009-07-06T07:57:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	do you see that small button directly under the back button?
2009-07-06T07:59:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	then we will try a different way :). open a terminal and run sudo aptitude install smbfs
2009-07-06T08:01:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	after that is installed you'll need to make a folder (call it anything, like share for example) in /media
2009-07-06T08:01:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	so sudo mkdir /media/share
2009-07-06T08:02:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	then we'll mount it via the smbfs. sudo mount -t smb -o username=USERNAME_HERE //IP.Addr.of.Computer/share /media/share
2009-07-06T08:02:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	aptitude and apt-get do the same thing
2009-07-06T08:03:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	the username of the remote computer with privledges to copy stuff over there
2009-07-06T08:05:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	which way do you want to go from Ubuntu -> Windows? or on Windows and retrieve from ubuntu?
2009-07-06T08:08:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	probably in ~/.mozilla
2009-07-06T08:10:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	did you create it first?
2009-07-06T08:10:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	it's sudo mkdir /media/share, not media/share
2009-07-06T08:11:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	and there were no errors when mounting?
2009-07-06T08:12:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	the computer you are copying files to, is it a vista computer?
2009-07-06T08:12:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	and what username do you log in with?
2009-07-06T08:13:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	ok so you would use sudo mount -t smb -o username=Administrator //ip.addr.remote.computer/share /media/share
2009-07-06T08:16:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	hmm maybe it is sudo mount -t smbfs <snip>
2009-07-06T08:17:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	the password you use to log into vista
2009-07-06T08:20:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	you dont actually type out <snip>
2009-07-06T08:22:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	no just so I didn't have to type out that long command again, apparently more trouble than it's worth
2009-07-06T08:24:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	you want sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=Administration //ip.address.remote.computer/share /media/share
2009-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	cabrey	Ruby	run ipconfig on the Windows computer and that'll give it to you
