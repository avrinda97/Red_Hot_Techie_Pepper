2005-02-13T15:51:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	check your umask
2005-02-13T15:57:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	sudo umount /mnt/win_C
2005-02-13T15:58:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	mount -t vfat /dev/hd(something) /mnt/win_C
2005-02-13T15:58:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	cd out of /mnt/win_C
2005-02-13T15:58:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	sudo umount /mnt/win_C
2005-02-13T15:59:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	mount -t vfat -o umask=0000 /dev/hd(something) /mnt/win_C
2005-02-13T15:59:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	lsof /mnt/win_C
2005-02-13T16:00:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	did that return anything?
2005-02-13T16:00:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	make sure you have nothing open in /mnt/win_C.
2005-02-13T16:00:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	like a shell, or nautilus
2005-02-13T16:01:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	mount -l
2005-02-13T16:02:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	is it still mounted?
2005-02-13T16:04:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	are you IRCing from the same machine?
2005-02-13T16:04:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	close your terminal. Open a new one
2005-02-13T16:05:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	do you want to be able to access this all the time?
2005-02-13T16:06:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	do you want to access this drive whenever you reboot?
2005-02-13T16:06:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	would recommend setting that up and rebooting
2005-02-13T16:07:00.000Z	snowblink	umauhauhauha	Read and follow this http://ubuntuguide.org/#windows
