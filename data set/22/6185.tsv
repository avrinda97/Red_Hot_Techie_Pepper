2006-12-28T12:54:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	hey there
2006-12-28T12:55:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	how's it going?
2006-12-28T12:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	Awesome. Just finished the cake (it's my birthday).
2006-12-28T12:55:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	happy bday! mmmmm cake.
2006-12-28T12:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	Thank you. :) What problems are you having exactly?
2006-12-28T12:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	You're trying to use xgl, aren't you.
2006-12-28T12:58:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	well I used https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI to try to get back to fglrx BUT just the one in the provided in the repositories (as the open Radeon doesn't support my X1300 card) but my system is freezing after when I try to login
2006-12-28T12:58:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	You're trying to use xgl, aren't you.
2006-12-28T12:59:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	lol ... no I have never tried to do xgl ... isn't that the fancy windows effects thingy?
2006-12-28T12:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	Really? The last time I saw this error it was related to xgl. Yes it it.
2006-12-28T12:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	Your error is on line 0982.
2006-12-28T12:59:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	well if I have enabled XGL somehow .. it's completely by mistake
2006-12-28T12:59:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	let me look at that ;)
2006-12-28T13:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	The error itself basically means the API of the fglrx_dri.so library changed. i.e. the functions you can call on changed.
2006-12-28T13:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	But the open-source software is still trying to call the old functions.
2006-12-28T13:01:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	I do know that fglrx does not support aiglx
2006-12-28T13:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	A quick google seems to indicate some forums where people with a similiar error message came for help: http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=dlsym+for+__driCreateNewScreen_20050727+failed
2006-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	oh ok thx ... i'll look there ... thx :)
2006-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	Regardless, the error is pretty specialised (i.e. a specific driver version for a specific card in a specific setup) so it's unlikely someone here will be able to help you. We're more for general newbie questions. You can try, but your best bet is probably google.
2006-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	seamus7_	Good luck.
2006-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	seamus7_	arrenlex	I see ok thank you ... I'm on the #ati channel too but it seems to be dormant for now
