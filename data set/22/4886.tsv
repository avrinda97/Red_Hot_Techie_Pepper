2007-10-30T19:40:00.000Z	crodgers		where does lilo get installed? does it create it's own directory?
2007-10-30T19:41:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	why are you using lilo? grub is default boot manager in ubuntu
2007-10-30T19:42:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	i am double booting between OS X and Ubuntu and refit needs lilo to work properly
2007-10-30T19:42:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	ok then. lilo stores its configuration in /etc/lilo.conf
2007-10-30T19:42:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	i have that file set up, but it's not recognizing linux at the refit menu
2007-10-30T19:43:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	you have to run lilo after changing the file
2007-10-30T19:43:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	ah, i'll try that
2007-10-30T19:44:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	the problem is whenever i try to download lilo ( using 'apt-get install lilo' ) i can't get it
2007-10-30T19:44:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	i get temporary error resolving archive.ubuntu.com
2007-10-30T19:44:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	well it seems like Internet is not working on the machine
2007-10-30T19:44:00.000Z	crodgers		i am using irc on the same machine right now
2007-10-30T19:45:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	and can view web pages
2007-10-30T19:45:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	ok then it might be overloaded ubuntu server, try installing using synaptic, it might be proxy settings
2007-10-30T19:45:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	trying...
2007-10-30T19:50:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	okay synaptic worked, but do you know where it puts lilo?
2007-10-30T19:51:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	run dpkg -L lilo to find out
2007-10-30T19:54:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	dpkg tells me it's not installed but synaptic tells me that it is. does it matter that i am chroot'ed into a mounted partition?
2007-10-30T19:54:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	synaptic was rung from chroot as well?
2007-10-30T19:54:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	yes
2007-10-30T19:55:00.000Z	heguru	crodgers	then it shouldn't matter
2007-10-30T19:55:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	let me try again
2007-10-30T19:56:00.000Z	crodgers	heguru	can i run synaptic from the command line? nevermind... googling now
