2007-02-27T07:48:00.000Z	mr_grump5		when i do ls -l it shows "lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2007-02-27 18:52 /dev/cdrom -> hdc" how to change permission to read the cd??
2007-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	 , you already have them
2007-02-27T07:50:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	sorry , forgot about that , symbolic links don't have permissions
2007-02-27T07:55:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	, I think permissions are fine (on my system I have brw-rw---- 1 root floppy 11, 0 2007-02-27 17:29 /dev/scd0 , and it works fine)
2007-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	, it is a symbolic link , and it is ok too
2007-02-27T07:58:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	, are you sure this is access problem , maybe it is somethink else (different drive, bad disk, ..etc)
2007-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	, so you can access /dev/hdc
2007-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	, for example cat /dev/hdc > /dev/null , does work
2007-02-27T08:03:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	, so it is not permission problem
2007-02-27T08:04:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	, something, I don't exactly know , let me try to guess
2007-02-27T08:05:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	it could be bad disk, bug in driver CSS protected DVD, some program that blocks access to disk...
2007-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	first of all look at end of dmesg, are there any interesting lines (about errors, DMA errors, bad filesytem, etc)
2007-02-27T08:07:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	no problem , then DVD CSS is not a option
2007-02-27T08:10:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	: dmesg  :-)

2007-02-27T08:14:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	  , as I thought , kernel have trouble reading disk
2007-02-27T08:15:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	does this happens with all disks
2007-02-27T08:15:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	maybe this is a faulty disk
2007-02-27T08:15:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	can you try different cd
2007-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	don't know how to help you , maybe you can try to disable DMA on disk , maybe this will help (but reduce performance)
2007-02-27T08:21:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	 , maybe, I don't know
2007-02-27T08:22:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	mr_grump5	 k3b  ;-)
