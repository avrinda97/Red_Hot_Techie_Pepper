2006-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	Arwen		yay, gnomefreak musta unbanned me?
2006-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	Arwen		has anyone got an intel537EP working on edgy? I just get a missing autoconf.h error
2006-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	Arwen		they're split rar files
2006-11-04T16:04:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	that's caused by not having autoconf itself installed.  what are you building from source?
2006-11-04T16:04:00.000Z	Arwen	sethk	yea, there
2006-11-04T16:05:00.000Z	Arwen	sethk	winmodem drivers... do I download the autoconf package?
2006-11-04T16:05:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	yes, there's a package for it
2006-11-04T16:08:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	I don't believe so, at least it's not proven safe yet.  I would wait.
2006-11-04T16:08:00.000Z	Arwen	sethk	hmm, kinda ironic that they're in a stable release
2006-11-04T16:09:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	they've claimed stability for years.  but they claimed all the problems were in version 1, and version 2 was perfect.  then they claimed all the problems were in v2, and v3 was perfect.  then they claimed all the problems were because of a kernel issue.  then they (now) claim that all the problems were in v3, and v4 is perfect.  I'll wait several months before believing it
2006-11-04T16:10:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	plus, there is really no advantage to reiser in real life situations, so why take a risk, no matter how small?
2006-11-04T16:10:00.000Z	Arwen	sethk	true (although I do use XFS - big risk there)
2006-11-04T16:11:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	I don't believe so.  xfs is perhaps not that popular in linux, but has lots of miles on it in other UNIX environments
2006-11-04T16:11:00.000Z	Arwen	sethk	perhaps.. in retrospect, I think the only reason I used XFS was I didn't know to tune2fs -m 0, lol
2006-11-04T16:12:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	but staying with ext3 is probably the best route for most users
2006-11-04T16:12:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	sure
2006-11-04T16:12:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	you just delete it, and create a new one
2006-11-04T16:12:00.000Z	Arwen	sethk	lol... it's my boot partition, doesn't work that way
2006-11-04T16:12:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	you said empty partition
2006-11-04T16:13:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	there are programs to resize ext3, but back up before yo use one
2006-11-04T16:13:00.000Z	Arwen	sethk	I asked if you could expand a partition to grow on preceding space
2006-11-04T16:13:00.000Z	sethk	Arwen	yes, in principle, you can
