2007-06-19T13:56:00.000Z	wols	Student	before you booted windows you did something ubuntu which caused this. not downloading acrobat
2007-06-19T13:57:00.000Z	Student	wols	I loaded a .pdf to a thumbdrive using ubuntu - so I could load it to windows when I booted it. - Could that be it?
2007-06-21T10:28:00.000Z	wols	Student	please do. better for the planet and the gators need food

2007-06-21T10:50:00.000Z	Student	wols	If you tell me to beat my PC...I'll do it.
2007-06-21T10:50:00.000Z	wols	Student	what has that poor PC done to you. beat thyself
2007-06-21T10:55:00.000Z	wols	Student	doing what?
2007-06-21T10:56:00.000Z	Student	wols	http://blog.shevin.info/2007/04/how-did-i-fix-cant-acess-tty-in-feisty.html
2007-06-21T10:56:00.000Z	wols	Student	try a different kernel
2007-06-21T10:57:00.000Z	Student	wols	Didn't work - I could boot and mount on Live CD though - but if I can't get it all fixed that is somewhat pointless too.
2007-06-21T10:58:00.000Z	Student	wols	Also it's not the kernel - because it worked before with the same exact kernel.
2007-06-21T11:46:00.000Z	wols	Student	does grep work? is any partition mounted?
2007-06-21T11:47:00.000Z	Student	wols	 Nothing gets mounted
2007-06-21T11:48:00.000Z	wols	Student	how did you check?
2007-06-21T11:48:00.000Z	Student	wols	That nothing was mounted? Because the error poped up before anything could mount
2007-06-21T11:49:00.000Z	wols	Student	that is not true
2007-06-21T11:49:00.000Z	wols	Student	if nothing was mounted how did ash run?
2007-06-21T11:49:00.000Z	Student	wols	I don't know, but ask gives only a few commands- none of which can help me from what I can tell.
2007-06-21T11:53:00.000Z	wols	Student	does udev load?
2007-06-21T11:53:00.000Z	Student	wols	Not that I saw.
