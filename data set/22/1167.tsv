2010-09-09T04:58:00.000Z	hipstersandwich	boba	I take it you just rebooted.
2010-09-09T04:59:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	Yes I did reboot in order to try to fix the same problem
2010-09-09T04:59:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	But it did not work
2010-09-09T05:00:00.000Z	hipstersandwich	boba	Problems on other computers?
2010-09-09T05:00:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	I had this problem several times with this application on computer and also other computers
2010-09-09T05:00:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	I had this problem several times with this application on my computer and also other computers
2010-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	hipstersandwich	boba	Is it just the camera having problems?
2010-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	Nope
2010-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	hipstersandwich	boba	Did you try it on windows?
2010-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	I tried it with a different camera also
2010-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	No the driver is only for Linux
2010-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	I mean the camera is working at the moment
2010-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	I mean the camera is working at the moment on Ubuntu
2010-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	But not with my own implemented application
2010-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	hipstersandwich	boba	Oh.  Can't help you with your own apps.
2010-09-09T05:03:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	I think as I have searched on the internet this is a common problem
2010-09-09T05:03:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	for example it happens with cheese also
2010-09-09T05:04:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	and is not related to my application
2010-09-09T05:06:00.000Z	boba	hipstersandwich	Could you please suggest what you would do if this was the case with cheese for example?
2010-09-09T05:06:00.000Z	hipstersandwich	boba	I haven't a clue.
