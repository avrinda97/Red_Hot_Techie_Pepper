2010-09-14T15:46:00.000Z	live-cd		hello everyone ... excuse me ... i'm here with an ubuntu-live_cd ... can you tell me how i can try and import "outlook express" emails into an email-program?
2010-09-14T15:46:00.000Z	jatt	live-cd	evolution
2010-09-14T15:47:00.000Z	live-cd		ok, thank you jatt ... lemme check that :)
2010-09-14T15:47:00.000Z	jatt		aka d-volution
2010-09-14T15:47:00.000Z	jatt		have fun :)
2010-09-14T15:48:00.000Z	live-cd	jatt	unfortunately evolution doesn't work! ... outlook express uses "dbx"-files ... unless you know of a free converter?
2010-09-14T15:51:00.000Z	jatt	live-cd	dude did a search for you, take a look at this thread
2010-09-14T15:51:00.000Z	jatt		target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App
2010-09-14T15:51:00.000Z	jatt		I mean

2010-09-14T15:52:00.000Z	live-cd	jatt	:) wanted to show you this website too ... found that in the mean-time too :)
2010-09-14T15:52:00.000Z	live-cd		and jatt ? ...  i imported the messages but i can't see them  :(
2010-09-14T15:52:00.000Z	live-cd		it still has all standard-folders in it ... but not my imported ones
2010-09-14T15:53:00.000Z	jatt		I don't know man I have never imported data with outlook express I thought initially that you were referring to outlook for which evolution works
2010-09-14T15:53:00.000Z	live-cd	jatt	:) ... it's ok ... i'm just trying out a few things ... so don't worry
2010-09-14T15:54:00.000Z	jatt		did you already try all things in that thread? like kmail?
2010-09-14T15:54:00.000Z	live-cd		yep ... i tried kmail
2010-09-14T15:54:00.000Z	live-cd		but i dunno why kmail doesn't display the messages jatt
2010-09-14T15:55:00.000Z	live-cd		import was successfully according to kmail ... but messages don't show up
2010-09-14T15:57:00.000Z	jatt		strange no idea dude maybe just try a virtual machine (VirtuaBox) and just run Outlook Express from the VM
2010-09-14T15:58:00.000Z	live-cd	jatt	:| ... will need some help to do this too ... but not now ... i want to try out a little more
2010-09-14T16:13:00.000Z	live-cd	jatt	brb
