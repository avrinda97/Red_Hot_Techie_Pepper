2008-02-01T03:11:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV		hi, i've been having trouble with ubuntu randomly logging out while i'm working, i have no idea how to even start troubleshooting that
2008-02-01T03:12:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	do you mean that the xserver restarts?
2008-02-01T03:12:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	how do i know?
2008-02-01T03:12:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	im a n00b
2008-02-01T03:12:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	like, does the screen do dark, you wait a few minutes, and then it kicks you back to the login screen?
2008-02-01T03:13:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	the screen goes dark, i see a few lines of bash that go to quick to read and then i get the login again, yes
2008-02-01T03:14:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	does it happen while you're typing?  sometimes you can accidentally hit the shortcut to kill X
2008-02-01T03:14:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	which is?
2008-02-01T03:15:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	ctrl + alt + backspace
2008-02-01T03:15:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	i don't think i've been typing, one time i was transferring some files to a secondary HDD, another time i was just using firefox
2008-02-01T03:16:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	running any special window managers (beryl, compiz)?  That happened to me a couple times due to instability
2008-02-01T03:16:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	compiz
2008-02-01T03:16:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	how did you fix it?
2008-02-01T03:17:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	I stopped using compiz.  My issue was the ATI driver was (at the time) not fully supported with compiz
2008-02-01T03:17:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	you might try updating your drivers
2008-02-01T03:17:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	otherwise, i'm not sure.
2008-02-01T03:17:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	are they not automatically updated through the repos?
2008-02-01T03:17:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	i may try disabling compiz if it happens again, thanks for the advice
2008-02-01T03:18:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	not the official ones, if you're using them.
2008-02-01T03:18:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	okay
2008-02-01T03:18:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	freyyr	i have a geforce card
2008-02-01T03:18:00.000Z	freyyr	VvWolverinevV	hmm, I'm not sure then.  sorry.
