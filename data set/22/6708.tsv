2006-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	what are you trying to do?
2006-10-11T10:40:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	lots of apps do p2p. is it a torrent client you're after?
2006-10-11T10:40:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	then what? gnutella?
2006-10-11T10:41:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	azureus is a bit torrent client. it requires Java, Java GNOME bindings, and other things.
2006-10-11T10:41:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	enable the universe and multiverse repos and install Azureus that way. or, go the easy route and use BitTornado,
2006-10-11T10:42:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	for Gnutella (Limewire) use GTK-Gnutella
2006-10-11T10:42:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui gtk-gnutella
2006-10-11T11:42:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	i answered your questions like an hour ago
2006-10-11T12:21:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	can i have 3 minutes of your time? seriously. 3 minutes.
2006-10-11T12:21:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	open a terminal
2006-10-11T12:22:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	type this without quotes "sudo apt-get install gtk-gnutella"
2006-10-11T12:22:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	supply your password when asked
2006-10-11T12:24:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	what packages?
2006-10-11T12:26:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-2 && sudo apt-get install gtk-gnutella"
2006-10-11T12:43:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	you're runnign all this stuff with sudo, right? and you're just using apt-get?
2006-10-11T12:44:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	it sounds like your installation got seriously messed. apt-get should "just work" for something like gtk-gnutella.
2006-10-11T12:44:00.000Z	mnepton	lansing	and, sadly, my time is constrained by people who have paid for Ubuntu support. :/
