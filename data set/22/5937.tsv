2007-02-20T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	killux	yes
2007-03-25T13:29:00.000Z	soundray	killux	what's the problem you are trying to solve?
2008-05-11T23:58:00.000Z	soundray	killux	you can do a fresh install and keep your /home data untouched
2008-05-11T23:59:00.000Z	soundray	killux	it does, but there are various situations where a fresh install may be preferable
2008-05-12T00:00:00.000Z	killux	soundray	ok, I can understand that, but my problem is, i am not sure how big to make the home partition
2008-05-12T00:01:00.000Z	soundray	killux	I usually give 12GB to /, RAM size + 10% to swap and whatever remains to /home
2008-05-12T00:01:00.000Z	soundray	killux	that's when I have 20GB or more to give to Ubuntu
2008-05-12T00:02:00.000Z	killux	soundray	wait when do you have to give 20GB or more to ubuntu?
2008-05-12T00:02:00.000Z	soundray	killux	you misread me
2008-05-12T00:03:00.000Z	soundray	killux	when I'm installing on a computer that has 20GB or more that I can assign to Ubuntu. This doesn't mean one has to -- in fact, I've done an installation on a 3GB HD once
2008-05-12T00:07:00.000Z	killux	soundray	ok, what about desktop preferences? when I upgrade, will I have to configure special effects again?
2008-05-12T00:08:00.000Z	soundray	killux	no, your personal settings are stored in $HOME and thus will be preserved through a fresh install if that lives on its own partition.
2008-05-12T00:10:00.000Z	killux	soundray	but what if you are using something like compiz for you desktop? does $HOME still keep that?
2008-05-12T00:12:00.000Z	soundray	killux	you will of course have to install the appropriate packages for effects support when you do the fresh installation
2008-05-12T00:13:00.000Z	killux	soundray	so is ubuntu's upgrade utility that bad that I should even bother making a seperate $HOME partition?
2008-05-12T00:14:00.000Z	soundray	killux	Ubuntu's upgrade utility is just fine. There are other reasons to have a separate /home
2008-05-12T00:15:00.000Z	killux	soundray	ok thanks.
2008-05-12T00:15:00.000Z	soundray	killux	e.g. you can have two or more parallel installations of Ubuntu for testing and still use the same personal data from each.
2008-05-12T00:16:00.000Z	killux	soundray	well a lot of my personal stuff(music, documents) I keep on my windows drive since it is bigger. So my /home directory is never that big so I don't think I will even bother making a seperate partition
2008-05-12T00:17:00.000Z	soundray	killux	it's not essential
