2007-01-15T14:38:00.000Z	heidi		hey, so Gnome won't start.
2007-01-15T14:39:00.000Z	heidi		after I login in with GDM, I go to a brown background with a cursor, and that's it.
2007-01-15T14:39:00.000Z	heidi		I'm able to run xchat by getting an xterm (failsafe) session running
2007-01-15T14:39:00.000Z	heidi		if I start gnome-wm, the window manager starts up
2007-01-15T14:40:00.000Z	heidi		no problem there
2007-01-15T14:40:00.000Z	heidi		sound is working also
2007-01-15T14:40:00.000Z	heidi		so it seems that gnome just isn't starting when I login with gdm
2007-01-15T14:41:00.000Z	heidi		I am a PPC user, but I don't imagine that is causing the problem
2007-01-15T14:42:00.000Z	heidi		(without interrupting or killing the first process)
2007-01-15T14:42:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	there's a known bug in PPC that requires modification of ~/.xsession. sec.
2007-01-15T14:46:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	put these lines in ~/.xsession :
2007-01-15T14:46:00.000Z	heidi	mneptok	thanks.
2007-01-15T14:51:00.000Z	heidi	mneptok	what file did that go in again/
2007-01-15T14:51:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	~/.xsession
2007-01-15T14:51:00.000Z	heidi	mneptok	I don't even have that file...
2007-01-15T14:51:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	create it
2007-01-15T14:51:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	you can own it
2007-01-15T14:56:00.000Z	heidi	mneptok	no dice.
2007-01-15T14:57:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	ugh. GDM just refuses to start?
2007-01-15T14:57:00.000Z	heidi	mneptok	no, GDM is working fine. Gnome won't start
2007-01-15T14:57:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	no, ~/.xsession
2007-01-15T14:58:00.000Z	mneptok	heidi	try moving ~/.gconf* and ~/.gnome* aside and seeing wha'ppens.
