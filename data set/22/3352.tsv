2008-10-18T17:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	dpkg-reconfigure is maybe what you want.
2008-10-18T17:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Also it would help if you specified which errors you got.
2008-10-18T17:32:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	dpkg: ../../src/packages.c:252: process_queue: Assertion `!queuelen' failed.
2008-10-18T17:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Well I would be more interested in the error thrown by gnome-power panel as it was the first. A failed assertion makes me first think of too little ram and/or swap.
2008-10-18T17:34:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	this all is happening after a fresh install and apt-get upgrade ram is 2.5 Gig and swap is 2 Gb i suppose.
2008-10-18T17:34:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	not ibex, is it?
2008-10-18T17:35:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	dont know what that is
2008-10-18T17:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	interpid ibex is ubuntu 8.10 which is still in development/beta.
2008-10-18T17:36:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	install problem. Configuration default for GNOME Power manager have not been installed correctly. Please contact admin.
2008-10-18T17:37:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	i am on 8.04/Hardy
2008-10-18T17:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	Did the upgrade finish without errors?
2008-10-18T17:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	ie, did you retry to do apt-get update and apt-get upgrade?
2008-10-18T17:39:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	no. runnning the GUI version invokes something and I get that GNOME power manager error popping up in the corner. via command like apt-get update gives E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2008-10-18T17:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	and that also throws errors?
2008-10-18T17:39:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	yes. the dpkg confiure error.
2008-10-18T17:40:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	dpkg was interrupted.
2008-10-18T17:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	I'm not sure how you would go about correcting that tbh.
2008-10-18T17:44:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	how do i rebuild apt ?
2008-10-18T17:45:00.000Z	BlueEagle	AJuOnLiNE|sh	I need to pass that question on to someone else.
2008-10-18T17:48:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	the best part is, i cant even run FireFox . so i am assuming stuff that just got updated with the upgrade after my fresh install isnt working. coz i am able to run GIMP.
2008-10-18T17:56:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	the first error was with libpangotryin to fix that as per the prompts.
2008-10-18T17:57:00.000Z	AJuOnLiNE|sh	BlueEagle	libpango i.e. did a defoma-reconfigure -f  and now things are working. i suppose.
