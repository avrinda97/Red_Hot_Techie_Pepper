2007-07-18T11:51:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	you must have selected the wrong mouse driver

2007-07-18T12:05:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	Well. What did you change? Maybe you set the resolution to high
2007-07-18T12:06:00.000Z	askand	HEP85	i reconfigured xorg to use vesa and then restarted gdm...then installed updates and installed propriratydrivers for my graphicscard..rebooted and..yeah
2007-07-18T12:08:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	proprietary graphic drivers are the problem. how did you install them?
2007-07-18T12:09:00.000Z	askand	HEP85	the manager told me to install them when I rebooted the first time
2007-07-18T12:09:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	"Manager for restricted drivers?"
2007-07-18T12:09:00.000Z	askand	HEP85	yep..
2007-07-18T12:10:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	there is a backup of your xorg.conf in /etc/X11. try copying it over the current settings and reboot
2007-07-18T12:10:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	I remember that I had the same problem when I first activated the restricted driver
2007-07-18T12:10:00.000Z	askand	HEP85	now I choosed vesa again and gdm starts with failed to initilize HAL error :S
2007-07-18T12:10:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	Unfortunately I am not sure what exactly I did
2007-07-18T12:11:00.000Z	HEP85	askand	can you paste your xorg.conf?
2007-07-18T12:13:00.000Z	askand	HEP85	hrm I dont have internet for some reason on the computer with problems right now :S
