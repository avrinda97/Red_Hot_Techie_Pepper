2005-12-25T11:05:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	use google to search for how tos on it   that is how I got hints then I finally got it working with a little trial and error  just be patient  you can do it
2005-12-25T11:06:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	your window manager has to support it         KDE and Gnome and Openbox all support it I think
2005-12-25T11:07:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	seems hard until you get it working than you laugh later how easy it was
2005-12-25T11:08:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	once you get the configuration set up   make a backup of that configuration so you will not cry later
2005-12-25T11:09:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	it works best if all cards of from same manufacturer but plenty get it working with 1 ATI and 1 Nvidia or other combo
2005-12-25T11:10:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	that should work great
2005-12-25T11:11:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	some see a increase of memory used by X
2005-12-25T11:11:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	some see a performance drop
2005-12-25T11:12:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	but remember it is spanning across to displays
2005-12-25T11:13:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	I can be great for workstation use     you can see a full page of something while you are at the same time doing 2-3 other things without having to go back and forth
2005-12-25T11:14:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	multi-head in linux seemed slower than multi-head in windblowz to me
2005-12-25T11:15:00.000Z	kspath	Inf3ctedFx	you can test with wget or curl or fetch or lynx or links
