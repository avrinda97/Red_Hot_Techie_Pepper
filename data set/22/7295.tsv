2006-05-01T16:37:00.000Z	nicolas__		ok, i just upgraded from sarge to breezy, everything worked almost without problems, except for the last step, which is apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-05-01T16:37:00.000Z	nicolas__		broken deps with gaim, synaptic, python-apt etc
2006-05-01T16:37:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	erm
2006-05-01T16:38:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	what?
2006-05-01T16:38:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	updated from sarge to breezy? since when sarge was an ubuntu release?
2006-05-01T16:38:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	it is not
2006-05-01T16:39:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	you should say: I broke my sarge install when I was tryng to change my distro to ubuntu
2006-05-01T16:39:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	well, someone else did it on ubuntuforums, and so i did
2006-05-01T16:40:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	i dont think you have anything to teach me
2006-05-01T16:40:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	hmm, I thing dpkg's ubuntu factoid is more clear on that
2006-05-01T16:41:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	I doubt that you will learn anything usefull other than debian != ubuntu
2006-05-01T16:42:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	almost
2006-05-01T16:42:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	but maybe you could educate me: what's the point in such an "upgrade" ?
2006-05-01T16:43:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	prevent data loss while preventing data backup when changing distro
2006-05-01T16:45:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	there are at least several way better ways of acheiveing the goal you described
2006-05-01T16:46:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	did i told you it went almost perfectly ?
2006-05-01T16:47:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	"broken deps with gaim, synaptic, python-apt etc" <-- you call this "almost perfect"
2006-05-01T16:47:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	I call it "broken system"
2006-05-01T16:48:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	a amtter of perspective
2006-07-03T15:08:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	do you have libsdl-dev installed?
2006-07-03T15:08:00.000Z	nicolas__	redguy	ohh, no, ill try with that
2006-07-03T15:09:00.000Z	redguy	nicolas__	in general, when building packages you need the -dev packages installed
