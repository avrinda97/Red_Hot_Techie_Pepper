2009-11-19T04:05:00.000Z	gaatse		I have linux xubuntu and I have no idea how to use skype, when I call someone he cannot hear me, I can hear him
2009-11-19T04:06:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	have you confirmed your mic works first
2009-11-19T04:07:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	Applications/Sound and video/sound recorder is a good start
2009-11-19T04:09:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	what im saying is do the following. In your sound preferences confirm that your "input" is the mic of your computer you want to use and that it's not muted and levels are turned to appropriate volumes
2009-11-19T04:10:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	also in skype there are a few volume controls you need to check
2009-11-19T04:11:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	what's hard is i can't tell you where or what to look because the menus are diff if you're on xubuntu
2009-11-19T04:11:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	that's why im saying to first test it in a program such as sound recorder
2009-11-19T04:13:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	if your sound works in sound recorder but not skype then we can narrow it down to skype
2009-11-19T04:14:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	no...
2009-11-19T04:17:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	you shouldn't have to
2009-11-19T04:17:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	that means when you open sound recorder it's "turning on" or adjusting your sound preferences, you shouldn't have to have it open to use it
2009-11-19T04:29:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	yes
2009-11-19T04:29:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	let me check mine
2009-11-19T04:31:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	im using pulse audio for all of my settings on that page
2009-11-19T04:33:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	this is in skype im talking about
2009-11-19T04:33:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	i thought you said you got it working
2009-11-19T04:33:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	but just not in skype
2009-11-19T04:35:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	how did you install skype?
2009-11-19T04:35:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	perhaps we can uninstall and then reinstall using the mediabuntu repo which has a few sound fixes?
2009-11-19T04:37:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	yes but skype shouldn't be in there in the default repositories
2009-11-19T04:37:00.000Z	scott_ino2	gaatse	pm me
