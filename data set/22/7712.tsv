2006-01-20T10:10:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	ya still got to do that with gentoo
2006-01-20T10:11:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	never tried gentoo... I started with slackware 3 or something... back in 95
2006-01-20T10:43:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	yea... the drives claim to do 16x, but you can't find any media at 16x... only 12x
2006-01-20T10:44:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	16x CD-RW media?
2006-01-20T10:51:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	how did you check the media?
2006-01-20T10:52:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	its not the media, i got 30 pressed cd's and a few burnt ones giving me the same error
2006-01-20T10:53:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	then it could be the drive... switch to another tty and md5sum it
2006-01-20T10:54:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	md5sum will tell you that
2006-01-20T10:56:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	you remember the md5sum command?
2006-01-20T10:57:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	yes
2006-01-20T10:57:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	can ya give it to me..lol
2006-01-20T10:57:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	if your cdrom is /dev/hdd, then just md5sum /dev/hdd
2006-01-20T10:59:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	running it now
2006-01-20T11:03:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	whats the correct MD5 hash?
2006-01-20T11:04:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	check next to the download links
2006-01-20T11:07:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	there's actually 2 bluetooth technologies
2006-01-20T11:08:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	says who?
2006-01-20T11:11:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	http://cgi.ebay.ca/Bluetooth-USB-Adapter-Class1up-to-100M-328ft-Range-us_W0QQitemZ5851530044QQcategoryZ44999QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem
2006-01-20T11:16:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	psusi	ok the md5's dont match however their for the ISO, wouldnt they change for the burnt product
2006-01-20T11:16:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	nope, same iso is on the pressed cds
2006-01-20T11:17:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	sounds like the drive is broken.. you might try disabling dma mode on it with hdparm
2006-01-20T11:19:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxMonk	are you looking at the correct iso md5sum?
