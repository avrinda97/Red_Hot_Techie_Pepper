2009-11-01T22:27:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	what's envy?
2009-11-01T22:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	dang thats pretty old
2009-11-01T22:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	you might end up using envy to try to get that workin, i dunno
2009-11-01T22:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	very possible.. what exactly is the problem you're having?
2009-11-01T22:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	remember the stories of the "white screen of death" w/ old ATI cards..lol
2009-11-01T22:32:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	this is an extra computer that i have win2k installed on but it's too slow so figured I'd try linux. i'm mainly just gonna use this to surf
2009-11-01T22:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	so you're gettin the white screen when you try the live CD?
2009-11-01T22:39:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	i installed 9.04 (or whatever the previous version of ubuntu is) and then upgraded to 9.10 - when i boot using the .31 kernel it freezes on the white logo screen, but i can boot with the .28 kernel (which is how i'm here)
2009-11-01T22:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	that might be your problem.. did 9.04 run OK?
2009-11-01T22:40:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	dunno... only installed it cuz i d/l it and then 2 days later 9.10 came out
2009-11-01T22:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	so you don't know if 9.04 worked OK?
2009-11-01T22:43:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	i played w/9.04 for a minute b4 i upgraded and it was ok
2009-11-01T22:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	well, i would try a clean install of 9.10 and see what happens
2009-11-01T22:44:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	ok... maybe the server will be faster today. when i d/l 9.04 it took 24 hrs :(
2009-11-01T22:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	use the torrents, they are cooking
2009-11-01T23:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	did you use the torrent?.. just curious.. its usually cooking
2009-11-01T23:06:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	no, just d/l the iso from the regular source
2009-11-02T01:38:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	i'm back. i did a clean install of 9.10 and now only the .31 kernel is an option and it still freezes on bootup at the white logo
2009-11-02T01:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	looks like you'er gonna need the OS driver for that
2009-11-02T01:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	get on ebay and get a cheap nvidia video card..lol most of them work regardless.
2009-11-02T01:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	BA^	unfortunately i think that card is just so old, it probably wasn't really tested in karmic
2009-11-02T02:06:00.000Z	BA^	IndyGunFreak	/ sebsebseb: how much room do I need to give 9.04 and how much does the swap file need?
