2009-12-20T16:11:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		I have READ lots. I came here because I dont know what to do and need help
2009-12-20T16:12:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		Wow and they wonder why people don't use linux
2009-12-20T16:14:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		I go to PLACES / NETWORK and I can see beautifuly my windows machiens on my network. I have a folder next to it called WORKGROUP which has my linux machine on it. I have installed samba. Can no one honestly help me on what to do next to get the windows machines to see my ubuntu machine?
2009-12-20T16:15:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		I found the pages usless and I am looking for someone to talk me through how to do it. I have spent 12 hours reading on "how" to do it but I have not had any luck
2009-12-20T16:17:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		I have gone into share on samba and added my home directory and despite I can see everysingle windows machine and file on their computer they can't see my ubuntu machine
2009-12-20T16:17:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		no one knows why or how to help with out giving me links that dont help?
2009-12-20T16:18:00.000Z	Draglor	LewisDre4m	Try to log on your server using username@sambamachine ... or enable the "browseable" feature ... both should show you the shares on your ubuntu machine
2009-12-20T16:19:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	When I go into networks I have two folders, one called worknet (my network) and one called worksgroup. When It is working wont my computer be added to the works net folder or not?
2009-12-20T16:19:00.000Z	Draglor	LewisDre4m	Did you read my suggestion?
2009-12-20T16:21:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	 can you not just walk me through wtf I am supposed to do after installing samba?
2009-12-20T16:22:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	the share I added in samba?>
2009-12-20T16:22:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	let me try
2009-12-20T16:24:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	I click the green pluss button to add a share . . . I have then browsed to my "home" directory and clicked ok. I have two boxes . . visible and writeable . . . shall I just click visible?
2009-12-20T16:24:00.000Z	Draglor	LewisDre4m	yes
2009-12-20T16:25:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	I click acesss and there is a tick box that says only allow access to specific users which had (my name and a box that says nobody) then there is a tick thing to say allow access to everyone. I will click EVERYONE. ok? I can't see broweable option.
2009-12-20T16:26:00.000Z	Draglor	LewisDre4m	yes (maybe it's visible, I use kubuntu and have different dialogs )
2009-12-20T16:26:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	 I will go see if that "home" folder can be seen on windows machines
2009-12-20T16:27:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	I have not added samba users , also when I go to preferences then samba server settings it says worksgroup: worksgroup is that all ok?
2009-12-20T16:29:00.000Z	Draglor	LewisDre4m	And don't forget to reload/restart samba ;)
2009-12-20T16:33:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	I couldn't see it in network places or anything just then but I forgot to shut it down and load it back up again
2009-12-20T16:33:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	Draglor	let me try it again
