2005-03-28T16:10:00.000Z	selinium_		Hi all , i have just installed 3D Desktop on Ubuntu via Synaptic. Now my PC fails during boot with failed to start X. Is there a way i can uninstall 3D desktop and get my machine working again? :)
2005-03-28T16:12:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	when the boot prompt asks... hit ESC... choose 'rescue'
2005-03-28T16:13:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	I can boot in rescue mode, but this just brings me to a prompt. Being pretty new to linux and without a nice gui i'm lost. What do i do?
2005-03-28T16:14:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	I wasn't following along... what are you trying to do?

2005-03-28T16:16:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	bah... go to rescue mode... dpkg -P 3ddesktop ... restart
2005-03-28T16:21:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	you really don't wish you found it 10 years ago though... 10 years ago... you'd never have gotten it installed... and we were stuck with TWM
2005-03-28T16:22:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	3ddesktop adds things to your home?
2005-03-28T16:22:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	If i had founf it 10 years ago, i would be pretty good a bash by now!
2005-03-28T16:23:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	sorry 'sudo dpkg ...' yes?
2005-03-28T16:23:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	doesn't matter... rescue mode is root only
2005-03-28T16:24:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	of course
2005-03-28T16:24:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	seems like somewhat of a security flaw to me... local exploits are way too easy in Ubuntu without a grub password.
2005-03-28T16:26:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	&& munki : Hopefully I will be back in 5. Wish me luck! Otherwise I'll be back in 10 (It takes about that long for windows to boot!)  and thank you for all your help!
2005-03-28T17:26:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	can you tell me what package i need to re install to get the X thingy working again?
2005-03-28T17:26:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-03-28T17:29:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	I think he's being figurative
2005-03-28T17:30:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	Hmm... how to make yourself look dumb in one easy move! Doh!
2005-03-28T17:31:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	heh... its cool... its hard to notice such things through text  :P
2005-03-28T17:31:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	So you use the dpkg rather than apt-get. I assume that is because the discussion had earlier with munki?
2005-03-28T17:31:00.000Z	lunitik	selinium_	for local files... umm, yeah
2005-03-28T17:32:00.000Z	selinium_	lunitik	Thanks for your help. back in a mo on ubuntu hopefully!
