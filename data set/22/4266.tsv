2008-02-03T03:47:00.000Z	pabl6		I've tried running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, but I can't make my monitor use its recommended resolution (1280x720). What can I do?
2008-02-03T03:48:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	It depends on your graphics card
2008-02-03T03:49:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	mabel@mabel-desktop:~$ sudo lspci | grep controller
2008-02-03T03:49:00.000Z	pabl6		00:0d.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GeForce 6100 nForce 430 (rev a2)
2008-02-03T03:50:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	you need to install the nvidia drivers package
2008-02-03T03:50:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	Via Synaptic? Which ones is the package?
2008-02-03T03:51:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	have you used the restricted drivers manager? Is your card listed there?
2008-02-03T03:52:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	Now I'm using it. It's installing something.
2008-02-03T03:52:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	nvida-glx-new
2008-02-03T03:52:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	it would probably say something about a 3d accelerator
2008-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	excellent
2008-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	Yes it does.
2008-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	What should I do after?
2008-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	When it finishes installing, it will ask you to restart
2008-02-03T03:54:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	Okay.
2008-02-03T03:55:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	It will probably be alright after restarting, since (in theory) the nvidia driver will be able to detect the correct resolution of your monitor, instead of the wrong one that the vesa driver detects now
2008-02-03T03:55:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	And you will probably be able to use compiz-fusion too ;-)
2008-02-03T03:55:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	I thought those drivers were for 3d acceleration only.
2008-02-03T03:55:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	That's cool :)
2008-02-03T03:56:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	not only, the 2d part is very important because it gives you correct aspect ratio and resolution detection, and also accelerates video playback. So its better anyway ;-)
2008-02-03T03:57:00.000Z	pabl6	hpstg	Okay. Time to restart. Will tell you later how it was.
2008-02-03T03:58:00.000Z	hpstg	pabl6	do it a bit fast though, because I need to restart too in a minute ;-)
