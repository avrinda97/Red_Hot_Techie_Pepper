2006-06-07T16:21:00.000Z	Faileas		this might sound rather silly, but i was wondering how i set a root AC and password in ubuntu server?
2006-06-07T16:21:00.000Z	Faileas		i'm running a system to try out and i'm a little lost
2006-06-07T16:21:00.000Z	Faileas		i seem to remember there isn't one by default
2006-06-07T16:22:00.000Z	Faileas		thank you
2006-06-07T16:22:00.000Z	Faileas		also, is it possible to get a GUI on ubuntu server?
2006-06-07T16:23:00.000Z	mbm1980	Faileas	yeah, install the one you want.
2006-06-07T16:23:00.000Z	Faileas		ok
2006-06-07T16:24:00.000Z	Faileas		OOH
2006-06-07T16:24:00.000Z	Faileas		thanks
2006-06-07T16:24:00.000Z	Faileas		i get it now ^^
2006-06-07T16:24:00.000Z	mbm1980	Faileas	install ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop
2006-06-07T16:25:00.000Z	Faileas	mbm1980	ok, i get it, i just need to sudo whatever instead of su to root and watever
2006-06-07T16:26:00.000Z	mbm1980	Faileas	yeah
2006-06-07T16:26:00.000Z	mbm1980	Faileas	if you really want the Debian way, you can choose expert when installing, it will ask which method you'd like.
2006-06-07T16:27:00.000Z	Faileas	mbm1980	its already installed
2006-06-07T16:27:00.000Z	Faileas		i just need to find my feet, been using suse mostly ;p
2006-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	mbm1980	Faileas	*nods* Well it is possible to enable it after install. But all those guides on the wiki/forums are written with sudo in mind. So, finding your feet is properly best. =)
2006-06-07T16:29:00.000Z	Faileas		hmm
2006-06-07T16:29:00.000Z	Faileas		if i want a shell server, its ssh or open-ssh?
2006-06-07T16:29:00.000Z	Faileas		er open-ssh server
2006-06-07T16:30:00.000Z	mbm1980	Faileas	I'd say open-ssh
