2008-08-18T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	how do you know they aren't recognized?
2008-08-18T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	they don't open in an image viewer when you double click them?
2008-08-18T03:30:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	lots of ways... e.g. nautilius wouldn't create a thumbnail (but it would if I rename it) or I cannot use them as desktop background
2008-08-18T03:31:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	no, they open eog because I set it up that way (with that extension)
2008-08-18T03:31:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	it is very annoyin because I need to rename any .jpg file to something else, if I want to use it as a desktop background
2008-08-18T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	I get the same problem, that nautilus won't create a thumbnail.. but they still open in an image-viewer when I doubleclick them and I can still right click on them for the special content menu.. but all this gets fixed if I just "touch" the file in some way.. so nautilus thinks it's anew file
2008-08-18T03:33:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	I tried to touch the file... and it doesn't work
2008-08-18T03:33:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	also can you use them as a desktop background?
2008-08-18T03:34:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	I haven't tried that.. and this only happens once a week or something.. so I have no files to try it on now
2008-08-18T03:34:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	my problem seems to be worse than yours
2008-08-19T04:02:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	do they stop working if you rename them back to the original name?
2008-08-19T04:02:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	yes they do
2008-08-19T04:03:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	hmm.. weird. I didn't think linux used filenames for filetypes..
2008-08-19T04:03:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	I know it is weird... I am getting crazy about this issue
2008-08-19T04:06:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	I talked to someone else in here a couple of days ago with the same problem.. we didn't find a solution then either
2008-08-19T04:06:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	did he file a bug?
2008-08-19T04:07:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	the problem is that it is useless to fill a bug until I understand what kind of problem is
2008-08-19T04:07:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	not sure.. but it was the exact same thing.. but he wanted to use the image for background.. and he didn't get the right click menu
2008-08-19T04:07:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	maybe it was me
2008-08-19T04:08:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	possibly
2010-01-24T14:12:00.000Z	Slart	paolo	probably because of the effort required to make sure both sound architectures work for all apps
2010-01-24T14:13:00.000Z	paolo	Slart	it would be nice to have a choice
