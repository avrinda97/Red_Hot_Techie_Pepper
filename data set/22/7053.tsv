2007-03-07T10:37:00.000Z	pingpongboss		wtf
2007-03-07T10:38:00.000Z	pingpongboss		i've just updated ubuntu to feisty herd 5. are there any good unofficial repos that I can add?
2007-03-07T10:38:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	what do you want to get
2007-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	nothing specific. I remember i did a search while i was on Edgy, and this guy had like 50 repos
2007-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	well good unofficial repos are defined in terms of what you need, having a repo that doesn't contain anything you want is a bad idea because it is unnecessary and you never know it could have a different version of a package and mess up something
2007-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	understood, ty
2007-03-08T07:21:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	reformat and go
2007-03-08T07:21:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	hey, u helped me before. I want to keep my programs and settings tho
2007-03-08T07:21:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	but are u saying that reformat is the best option?
2007-03-08T07:22:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	yeah, you could back up your home and usr if you need that stuff, but it would be better to just reinstall things
2007-03-08T07:22:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	alright
2007-03-08T07:22:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	what's in /usr?
2007-03-08T07:22:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	application libraries and binaries
2007-03-08T07:22:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	my /home in on a seperate partition
2007-03-08T07:23:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	should i back that up? are there settings and stuff in there?
2007-03-08T07:23:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	no settings, but the applications themselves, I would just reinstall them
2007-03-08T07:23:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	home has all the settings
2007-03-08T07:23:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	ic. ty
2007-03-25T09:20:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	i think she means trying to use gaim with irc
2007-03-25T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	sounded like a generic, linux is hard for newbies thing. But if you are complaining about graphically setting up an irc account on gaim, that is a bit overboard
2007-03-25T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig	pingpongboss	rm it
2007-03-25T09:22:00.000Z	pingpongboss	bruenig	k
