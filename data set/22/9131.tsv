2007-12-31T00:20:00.000Z	dash	sobersabre	I _think_ it's worked in the past.... but I'm not sure :) I mean, usplash works
2007-12-31T00:21:00.000Z	sobersabre	dash	you may have to use another resolution and another vga mode.
2007-12-31T00:21:00.000Z	sobersabre	dash	does ATI card driver come with fb driver ?
2007-12-31T00:21:00.000Z	dash	sobersabre	not sure what you mean?
2007-12-31T00:22:00.000Z	sobersabre	dash	got that ?
2007-12-31T00:24:00.000Z	dash	sobersabre	ah, the fglrx driver doesn't come with a framebuffer driver, no
2007-12-31T00:24:00.000Z	sobersabre	dash	so use vga16fb
2007-12-31T00:25:00.000Z	sobersabre	dash	have you seen what I've written ?
2007-12-31T00:25:00.000Z	dash	sobersabre	Yeah --
2007-12-31T00:25:00.000Z	dash	sobersabre	and after 'modprobe vga16fb' I do now see an fb0 device
2007-12-31T00:25:00.000Z	sobersabre	dash	the framebuffer not always works without a reboot.
2007-12-31T00:26:00.000Z	dash	sobersabre	well, at least I know that i'm on the right track :)
