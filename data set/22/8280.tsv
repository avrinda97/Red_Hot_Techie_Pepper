2006-09-11T14:47:00.000Z	libervisco		ok, thanks lupine_85, so it seems Ubuntu isn't really a bleeding edge distro :)
2006-09-11T14:48:00.000Z	libervisco		yeah
2006-09-11T14:48:00.000Z	libervisco		to me bleeding edge means the latest stable release of a program
2006-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	libervisco		well, ok I like close to bleeding edge then :)
2006-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	libervisco		stable edge
2006-09-11T14:51:00.000Z	libervisco		I tried Frugalware, but got a bit dissappointed
2006-09-11T14:51:00.000Z	libervisco		now I'm attracted by Ubuntu again
2006-09-11T14:51:00.000Z	libervisco		for the sheer polish of it :)
2006-09-11T14:53:00.000Z	libervisco		What would you guys say about Ubuntu performance compared to other distros (in terms of speed)?
2006-09-11T14:53:00.000Z	xav	libervisco	finally, I think it's ok
2006-09-11T14:54:00.000Z	xav	libervisco	problem with many distrib is that they install a ton of unneeded crap by default
2006-09-11T14:54:00.000Z	libervisco	xav	yeah
2006-09-11T14:54:00.000Z	xav	libervisco	so boot is slow if you do a normal install
2006-09-11T14:54:00.000Z	libervisco		one thing about Arch I've been liking is speed
2006-09-11T14:54:00.000Z	libervisco		it booted faster than any distro
2006-09-11T14:55:00.000Z	libervisco		but maybe upstart will increase bootup speed for Ubuntu
2006-09-11T14:55:00.000Z	xav	libervisco	though, last install I did, I set it up more like arch, only installing base system, and it's much better ;)
2006-09-11T14:55:00.000Z	libervisco	xav	cool :)
2006-09-11T14:55:00.000Z	xav	libervisco	it doesn't atm
2006-09-11T14:56:00.000Z	xav	libervisco	and the ui is comparable in term of speed. maybe ubuntu gnome is a bit more bloated, but it's quite neat
2006-09-11T14:56:00.000Z	xav	libervisco	and you can still use any wm you want
2006-09-11T14:56:00.000Z	libervisco	xav	indeed
