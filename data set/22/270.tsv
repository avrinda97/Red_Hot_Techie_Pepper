2012-02-10T02:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	so far zykotick9 has given you the only solid advice justa heads up here.
2012-02-10T02:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	there are a number of links on google of this card and how to install the drivers.
2012-02-10T02:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	actually now youn have changed the OS release from 11.04 to 11.10, I see now so here is one form the ubuntu forums. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1859912
2012-02-10T02:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	not solved but gves yhou a hint at the problems, wait for informed help.
2012-02-10T02:29:00.000Z	yusufaliboz	urlin2u	i wonder if i will install the last version, can ubuntu identify my wi-fi adaptor?
2012-02-10T02:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	I have no idea, but my guess is no. You just said your using 11.10 that is the latest as far as official releases. A railink device is not a simple plug and play setup.
2012-02-10T02:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	personally I would just get a usb device that does work or use the inboard, but that is just me.
2012-02-10T02:32:00.000Z	yusufaliboz	urlin2u	i will try ideas as in: http://forums.techguy.org/networking/1000462-solved-ralink-rt5390-802-11b.html
2012-02-10T02:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	you keep saying adapter this is a intenal card right?
2012-02-10T02:33:00.000Z	yusufaliboz	urlin2u	if i can't solve i will turn here..
2012-02-10T02:34:00.000Z	yusufaliboz	urlin2u	internal
2012-02-10T02:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	yusufaliboz	that link seems to be for windows, no linux mentioned
