2006-01-13T11:03:00.000Z	ruschi		Hi there - has anyone a valid list of all possible Xkboptions and their meaning ? the manpage doesn't describe waht is possible
2006-01-13T11:03:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	XKB is a very mysterious horror. But try looking at 'man setxkbmap' for some hints.
2006-01-13T11:05:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	not necesasarily! Do you use KDE?
2006-01-13T11:08:00.000Z	ruschi	Blissex	yes I use KDE but after a while playing wiht diverse xkb files I don't have these multiple opitons in accessability/keyboardlayout anymore ....
2006-01-13T11:09:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	bad news... But you don't need special XKB files for that, it is a set of standard options.
2006-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	for example statically I use:     Option  "XkbSymbols" "en_US(pc105)+gb+group(toggle)+compose(ralt)"
2006-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	or dynamically, generated by the control panel: setxkbmap -option -option compose:rwin,lv3:lwin_switch,grp:toggle,altwin:meta_alt
2006-01-13T11:11:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	try the latter for example it might give you some fleeting moment of happiness. If you are lucky.
2006-01-13T11:15:00.000Z	ruschi	Blissex	I give it a try, thanks!
2006-01-13T11:15:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	it is obsolete, and can interfere with proper XKB.
2006-01-13T11:16:00.000Z	ruschi	Blissex	so whre do you specify what characters appear when pressing certain keys, if xmodmap is obsolete?
2006-01-13T11:17:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	tragically in an XKB config file, which is far more complex.
2006-01-13T11:17:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	Compose is not the same as Group Switch which is not the same as ISO Level 3
2006-01-13T11:18:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	even if Group Switch and ISO Level 3 are pretty similar, and usually configured the same.
2006-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	ruschi	Blissex	I am totally confused...... I have an us layout Sun Type 6 Keyboard and all I want is the effect that when I press Compose + a I get an german umlaut
2006-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	ruschi	Blissex	I already managed to get this in debian Sarge
2006-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	you cant do that....
2006-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	Compose requires _two_ keys to follow that.
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	to get "a" with umlaut with Compose you press Compose+:+a
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	Blissex	ruschi	or else you press GroupSwitc+a
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	ruschi	Blissex	Thanks alot
2006-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	ruschi	Blissex	 Thanks, I zap my Xserver and try again - see you soon
