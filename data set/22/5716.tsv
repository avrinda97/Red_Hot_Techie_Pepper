2008-07-18T18:33:00.000Z	switchcat		nope, nothing
2008-07-18T18:34:00.000Z	switchcat		so how do I install one?
2008-07-18T18:34:00.000Z	switchcat		yes of course it has usb ports, I'm plugged into them
2008-07-18T18:35:00.000Z	switchcat		I dont remember too much data on the mobo it's been a while
2008-07-18T18:36:00.000Z	switchcat		I should try ##Linux for that I guess?
2008-07-18T18:36:00.000Z	switchcat		or maybe a kernel channel?
2008-07-18T18:37:00.000Z	switchcat		I dont think I've ever gotta a usb device to work on this system
2008-07-18T18:37:00.000Z	switchcat		I never had windows set up on this box
2008-07-18T18:38:00.000Z	hccmb	switchcat	, is usb enabled in bios settings?
2008-07-18T18:38:00.000Z	switchcat		uhmm, I would assume so
2008-07-18T18:38:00.000Z	hccmb		better check
2008-07-18T18:38:00.000Z	switchcat		well that means I'd have to reboot. :P
2008-07-18T18:39:00.000Z	hccmb		really ?\
2008-07-18T18:39:00.000Z	hccmb		you can turn usb off in bios, never heard of that?
2008-07-18T18:40:00.000Z	switchcat		I dont think my bios has an option for that.. but who knows... it's been a while
2008-07-18T18:42:00.000Z	switchcat		okay thanks I will have to see whats up when I finally decide to reboot
2008-07-18T18:42:00.000Z	hccmb	switchcat	open gnome terminal and do an lshw
2008-07-18T18:43:00.000Z	hccmb		then you can see whats more on the board etc
2008-07-18T18:45:00.000Z	hccmb		put an # before the one you dont want
2008-07-18T19:11:00.000Z	switchcat	hccmb	- I've just seen your suggestion to do lshw
