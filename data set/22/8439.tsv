2005-08-29T11:23:00.000Z	ixiz		gosh I didin't know that page :-o
2005-08-29T11:23:00.000Z	ixiz		sorry for all those stupid questions lol
2005-08-29T06:00:00.000Z	ixiz		what is wrong with my soundcard? If I try to open a .mp3 in xmms I just get, could not open audio, and it won't play either in any other music player
2005-08-29T06:01:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	nothing wrong woth your sound card.
2005-08-29T06:01:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	you will need to install some plugin. I don't know exactly which one.
2005-08-29T06:01:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	I did install the libmad and gstreamer0.8-mad0 plugin and the ffmpeg and those
2005-08-29T06:04:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	Did you try this instruction. You sure you didn't miss any package? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats?action=show&redirect=mp3#head-d67b20adc8d30f9d239222912aeb42f2e456b36b
2005-08-29T06:06:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	yes I did, and I did this one too: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoundProblemsHoary?highlight=%28Sound%29
2005-08-29T06:06:00.000Z	ixiz		that's why I don't understand why it does not work
2005-08-29T06:07:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	And are other formats working? If you are using xmms which output plugin is selected?
2005-08-29T06:08:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	I use esd in xmms
2005-08-29T06:08:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	Now I can play them in music player for some odd reason, but still not in xmms which is what I want
2005-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	hmmm. Sorry then I have only this knowledge about it. Can't help you.
2005-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	it works if I choose the alsa driver
2005-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	ixiz		:S
2005-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	ixiz		but ubuntu wiki said that esd was the default one strange
2005-08-29T06:10:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	make sure that esd server has started. You can choose it to start at machine startup from Preferences.
2005-08-29T06:12:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	preferences and then what?
2005-08-29T06:12:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	I think it should be Preferences-?Sound
2005-08-29T06:13:00.000Z	onkarshinde	ixiz	I mean Preferences->Sound
2005-08-29T06:13:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	'enable sound server at startup' was marked
2005-08-29T06:13:00.000Z	ixiz	onkarshinde	but thx anyway it's not that important now that I can play music :)
