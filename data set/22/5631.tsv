2009-06-30T08:37:00.000Z	Caleb_		We all use different methods
2009-06-30T08:37:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	but not all of them are valid
2009-06-30T08:38:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	also, i feel that sebsebseb was using the original meaning of "newbie," and your use of "noob" was a misinterpretation
2009-06-30T08:39:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	not necessarily
2009-06-30T08:40:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	i'd hardly cite wikipedia as a definitive source for internet slang
2009-06-30T08:43:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	first result on google: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=noob
2009-06-30T08:43:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	see part A.II
2009-06-30T08:44:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	yeah... the repositories

2009-06-30T08:57:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	what?
2009-06-30T08:58:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	oh, you're installing it right now? there should be multiple guided options
2009-06-30T08:58:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	but they're pretty clear. choose what you want
2009-06-30T09:00:00.000Z	raylu	Caleb_	...it's really not that hard to figure it out, given the options presented by the installer
