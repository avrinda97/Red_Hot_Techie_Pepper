2007-07-23T10:05:00.000Z	younghacker		i was looking into that, is that why my httpd.conf file is bare?

2007-07-23T10:11:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	I'm also going through the same setup for dyndns. I'm *just* starting it, but I'll be listening in on what you're doing
2007-07-23T10:25:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	have you set up ddclient yet to maintain your current  IP on the machine? (sorry if i missed out on this already)
2007-07-23T10:26:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	you'll probably want to get that if your IP   is dynamic, that way it'll stay up to date with dyndns
2007-07-23T10:26:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	I got it from dyndns.com/support/clinets
2007-07-23T10:37:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	what was the *.kicks-ass.org url you had from dyndns? i'll do a traceroute and see if it looks like mine
2007-07-23T10:52:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	there are so many things that could go wrong, wouldn't it also work just with your IP address. Get that working and eliminate problems with the port forwarding etc on the router
2007-07-23T10:54:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	you're in NYC, are you going to mysqlcamp in brooklyn next month?
2007-07-23T10:55:00.000Z	jaw	younghacker	also, many (*many, many, many*) ISPs block port 80
