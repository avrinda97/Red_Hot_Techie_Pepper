2004-11-22T14:10:00.000Z	ben_		why is skype so ugly, did i mess something up?
2004-11-22T14:11:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	do you have all sorts of little boxes and Chinese characters?
2004-11-22T14:11:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	i have ugly aliased boxyness
2004-11-22T14:12:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	yeah, I have that too. I believe it's due to the fact that KDE isn't installed
2004-11-22T14:12:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	i have some funny lookin box thing too...that sits in the corner and it has a cut off icon
2004-11-22T14:13:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	that's supposed to be the tray icon; it should be in your GNOME tray but sometimes it doesn't work.
2004-11-22T14:13:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	oh
2004-11-22T14:13:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	how do i add skype to the menus?
2004-11-22T14:13:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	where have you installed Skype? is it still in your home directory?
2004-11-22T14:15:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	okay, skype the program itself should be in /opt or /usr/local/bin or whatever you want it to be, and all the other files should be copied into a /usr/local/skype directory (I had to create it myself)
2004-11-22T14:15:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	next thing I did was just right-click in the 'Internet' section of my Applications menu, go to the 'Entire menu' submenu, and choose 'add new item to this menu'
2004-11-22T14:16:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	huh? so just the "skype" executable should be in opt?
2004-11-22T14:16:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	i just put the whole thing in /opt
2004-11-22T14:16:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	that's what I did, mainly because that's what the README file told me to do. If Skype works for you without moving all the other files in /usr/share/skype, hey -- it works, right? ^_^
2004-11-22T14:17:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	lol, yup. but wat's the point of moving the other files?
2004-11-22T14:17:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	no idea; I think Skype looks for them there
2004-11-22T14:17:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	let me check
2004-11-22T14:18:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	The README sez Skype searches for the file "call_in.wav" and additional language files in both the current directory (in your case, /opt/skype) *and* the /usr/share/skype directory -- so you're fine
2004-11-22T14:19:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	my username is pdaoust
2004-11-22T14:20:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	I just like to throw extra program data into the /usr/share directory just because that's how most of the programs in Ubuntu are also set up -- I just like to keep it consistent.
2004-11-22T14:21:00.000Z	pdaous1	ben_	how are things coming along? still looking for your mic? :)
2004-11-22T14:21:00.000Z	ben_	pdaous1	yeah, i got my mic, what's ur username?
