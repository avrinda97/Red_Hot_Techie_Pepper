2009-09-07T03:06:00.000Z	quidnunc		Ugh. Why can't I copy a file to an (external HD) partition with "Read-only file system" error when mount saw "RW"?
2009-09-07T03:07:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	probably a user issue, who mounted the drives
2009-09-07T03:08:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	I used the gnome disk mount applet which required gksudo. So root I guess.
2009-09-07T03:08:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	But my permissions on the mount point were listed as drwxrwxr-x
2009-09-07T03:08:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	and are u copying using cp or visual
2009-09-07T03:08:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	cp. Also tried sudo cp
2009-09-07T03:09:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	and what are the filesystems?
2009-09-07T03:09:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	hfsplus is the destination. reiserfs on source
2009-09-07T03:10:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	that could be the problem, idk if it can convert them. are u copying a directory ot just a file;.?
2009-09-07T03:11:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	Just a file. idk?
2009-09-07T03:11:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	like a text file vs a folder
2009-09-07T03:11:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	Just a file
2009-09-07T03:11:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	ok try running cp -v
2009-09-07T03:13:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	Ah, sudo cp works now?
2009-09-07T03:13:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	well itll tell u whats going on, so ull get more detailed messages
2009-09-07T03:13:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	cp -v  didn't tell me anything useful
2009-09-07T03:14:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	but sudo cp worked
2009-09-07T03:14:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	so it copied now?
2009-09-07T03:14:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	Well, one file anyway.
2009-09-07T03:15:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	hm, dunno what to tell you, is it failingfor other files?
2009-09-07T03:15:00.000Z	quidnunc	pvl1	I'm trying my big file now.
2009-09-07T03:17:00.000Z	pvl1	quidnunc	np
