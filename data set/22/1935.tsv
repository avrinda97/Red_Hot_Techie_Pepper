2010-09-14T21:41:00.000Z	gsp2009		hey all.. so this morning I hear lots of drive and network activity. I have been trying to figure out what is going on. Network traffic shows several outbdound connections to HTTPS (443). Nothing running such as p2p... anyone have any ideas?
2010-09-14T21:42:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	you on a secure site?, also are you watching a video or anything that involves streaming from HDD?
2010-09-14T21:43:00.000Z	gsp2009		sjm.. did that and can only see system_bus_socket and hald
2010-09-14T21:43:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	nothing streaming.
2010-09-14T21:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	is this from boot?
2010-09-14T21:44:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	nope... been up 12 hours.
2010-09-14T21:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	gimp? anything that caches a lot, long firefox session?
2010-09-14T21:45:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	nothing running, but that doesn't mean that ff isn't borked... will check that out.
2010-09-14T21:46:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	interesting thing is that the outgoing connections are all to the same subnet.
2010-09-14T21:46:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	runnning samba? apache?, anything server like?
2010-09-14T21:47:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	the only difference since yesterday is that I am using pidgin for IRC... I am starting to think that maybe that has something to do with it.. but I can't see why it would use traffic on 443.
2010-09-14T21:49:00.000Z	gsp2009		sjm.. yeah. I normally use xchat.. but I tried pidgin to get everything in one spot... I should know better.
2010-09-14T21:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	not sure, i'm pretty sure irc is not even secure(as in secure to use 443 anyway, but other messaging protocols use 443)
2010-09-14T21:52:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	ok.. this isn't good.. I have 5 outgoing connections on the following ports... 55695, 51147, 55609, 55562, 43749 etc... all to a block of IP's owned by Micro$oft.
2010-09-14T21:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	using msn?
2010-09-14T21:54:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	thanks for your help... for some reason... pidgin was swallowing its own face over connecting to WLM over https. I have killed it, and it stopped.
2010-09-14T21:55:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	ok, good, nice that you found that out :)
2010-09-14T21:55:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	you suggest something better to connect to msn? pidgin seems bloated
2010-09-14T21:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	not sure, when i use pidgin, i'm only ever on for about 5-10mins. there is finch and bitlbee if you like cli
2010-09-14T21:57:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	empathy, maybe
2010-09-14T21:57:00.000Z	gsp2009	aeon-ltd	ok.. thanks for all your help. I really appreciate it.
2010-09-14T21:58:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	gsp2009	your welcome
