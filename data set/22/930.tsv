2011-01-11T11:02:00.000Z	MWP		Hi all.
2011-01-11T11:03:00.000Z	MWP		Just installed 10.10 Desktop. How do i boot to console instead of into X/GDM?
2011-01-11T11:03:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	you can just ctrl+alt+f1
2011-01-11T11:03:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	or if you want it permanent, edit /etc/initrc
2011-01-11T11:04:00.000Z	MWP	muhammadnk	/etc/initrc doesnt exist?
2011-01-11T11:06:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	sorry, it's /etc/init.d
2011-01-11T11:07:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	i used too many distros, too confused. :P
2011-01-11T11:07:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	okay, i'm wrong again. CentOS has /etc/initrc for startup
2011-01-11T11:08:00.000Z	MWP	muhammadnk	ok thanks, but what do i changed in /etc/init.d ?

2011-01-11T11:09:00.000Z	MWP	muhammadnk	thats from 2004, doesnt apply anymore

2011-01-11T11:10:00.000Z	MWP	muhammadnk	again, too old
2011-01-11T11:10:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	ubuntu is derived from debian which is more than 10 years and most of it is the same. except for grub2 and small changes on startup but mostly it's applicable.
2011-01-11T11:11:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	try and see. no use complaining too old and ending up like an idiot.
2011-01-11T11:11:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	use this, https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2004-October/008951.html - this is better.
2011-01-11T11:12:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	it *will* work. and you have a choice to remove it complete or the second choice is to disable it at startup.
2011-01-11T11:13:00.000Z	MWP	muhammadnk	nope, fail. still starts X
2011-01-11T11:14:00.000Z	MWP	muhammadnk	as i said, recent Ubuntu uses different init system, so those old methods no long work.
2011-01-11T11:24:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	forgive me for being harsh, my actions may not be appropriate but i myself am grateful to have irc as a place to ask questions eventhough it is my last resort. =)
2011-01-11T11:25:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	do this, update-rc.d -f gdm remove
2011-01-11T11:25:00.000Z	muhammadnk	MWP	restart and viola.
