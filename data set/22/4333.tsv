2008-01-17T20:46:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	did you start it, and/or see if it's listening? use ps -aux |grep apa   to see if it's started, and netstat -tanp to see if anything is listening
2008-01-17T20:46:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	how did you install apache1? it hasn't been avail for over a year iirc
2008-01-17T20:47:00.000Z	teodra	klrspz	i just type sudo apt-get install apache
2008-01-17T20:47:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	what distro are you running? it's not in the ubuntu repositories, i'm wondering if you installed it from elsewhere?
2008-01-17T20:48:00.000Z	teodra	klrspz	no i installed it using that command..
2008-01-17T20:49:00.000Z	teodra	klrspz	i am woundering why apache works.. but apache 2 not:S
2008-01-17T20:50:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	uninstall apache, it's not a valid server these days, nor is it supported
2008-01-17T20:51:00.000Z	teodra	klrspz	ok thnx.. some good server for joomla?:)
2008-01-17T20:52:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	do you know what version of ubuntu you are running?
2008-01-17T20:52:00.000Z	teodra	klrspz	yes i know 7.04
2008-01-17T20:52:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	ok, we're all on 7.10, that might make a difference
2008-01-17T20:52:00.000Z	teodra	klrspz	ok thnx for the time!
2008-01-17T20:52:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	but use apache2 as the package name to install
2008-01-17T21:08:00.000Z	teodra	klrspz	i solve the problem apache2 is not compatible with ubuntu 7.04
2008-01-17T21:12:00.000Z	klrspz	teodra	why do you think apache2 isn't compatible with 7.04?
