2006-08-21T08:31:00.000Z	iceman		Dang it, need a "Winblows" hack... to enable and create a new XP restore cd on a compaq before I install Ubuntu
2006-08-21T08:33:00.000Z	iceman		why cant there be a game like battlefield 2 for Linux
2006-08-21T08:33:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	you will need to use wine or transgaming
2006-08-21T08:34:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	Preformance would be a issue wouldn't it ?
2006-08-21T08:35:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	who knows, some run pretty much almost as fast, some don't run too well
2006-08-21T08:35:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	some don't run at all
2006-08-21T08:35:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	www.transgaming.com
2006-08-21T08:36:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	would like a pure linuk game with the "worlds" and graphic's of BF2
2006-08-21T08:36:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	I have managed to run Diablo II in wine
2006-08-21T08:36:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	only a few games run natively in linux
2006-08-21T08:37:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	yeah well you could always try to use wine to get bf2 going
2006-08-21T08:37:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	Wolf 3d is fair on linux ... and large user base as well, Plus native linux install
2006-08-21T08:40:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	hehe atlerast you got it installed, i can get it running but no keyboard/mouse, since there is a bug in the USB drivers and my specific mobo
2006-08-21T08:41:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	OSX86 seems a fair project, thanks to apple backing off the project and letting it proceed
2006-08-21T08:42:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	well really the only reason they back it is because they at the time where planning to switch to Intel CPUs
2006-08-21T08:43:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	no Apple originaly forced the project to close, then it grew outside, and became to big, so apple just left it and has allowed it to progress.
2006-08-21T08:44:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	i'm pretty sure they would have really tried to shut it down, if it wasn't going to benefit them
2006-08-21T08:45:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	i'd like to get OPENSTEP installed and networked for the fun of it
2006-08-21T08:46:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	tried about ever os there is, but UBUNTU still kind of beats all,  for Usability and support
2006-08-21T08:46:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	is openstep part based off the aqua used in in mac
2006-08-21T08:47:00.000Z	Phirax	iceman	well i've always used redhat/fedora, switched to unbuntu for the first time a few days ago, once i got all the problems i initially had fixed, well all but one, i've been pretty impressed with it
2006-08-21T08:47:00.000Z	iceman	Phirax	Been using UBUBTU for 3 releases now...
