2012-05-26T12:46:00.000Z	robotdevil		how come removing quiet and splash from /etc/default/grub still gives me the ugly gray boot splash on kubuntu 12.04
2012-05-26T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	do you mean a plain screen?
2012-05-26T12:48:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	no it has a logo and everything
2012-05-26T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	can you expandon 'ugly' then please
2012-05-26T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	did you run:  sudo update-grub    after editting the file, as well?
2012-05-26T12:50:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	oops lol
2012-05-26T12:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	better?
2012-05-26T13:07:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	no how do I do logout or does that cover it?
2012-05-26T13:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	do you mean from the desktop session?
2012-05-26T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	can run:  sudo shutdown -r now      and it will reboot, if that's what you mean?
2012-05-26T13:09:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	I mean to see verbose, not a splash
2012-05-26T13:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	try pressing ESC during boot, plymouth should hide and you can watch the boot, the same text is present in:    dmesg | less     if the system boots fully
2012-05-30T03:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	flash probably
2012-05-30T03:50:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	no, I mean for quicktime and all that
2012-05-30T03:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	ah, there are a few, none are 'best'
2012-05-30T03:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	mozilla-plugin-vlc  is an option
2012-05-30T03:52:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	doesnt seem to get everything. Very surprised as vlc stand alone plays everything
2012-05-30T03:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	it can play as much as the other players you can install
2012-05-30T03:54:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	you mean *plugins I install
2012-05-30T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	yes, all the players will access the central store for plugins, so VLC will play as many media types as any, as they all use the same codecs
2012-05-30T03:57:00.000Z	robotdevil	ActionParsnip	on the stand alone side of things, is there a benefit to having mplayer2 installed instead of plain mplayer. I use smplayer once in awhile and in didnt seem to install mplayer2.
2012-05-30T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	robotdevil	not used mplayer too, I use gnome-mplayer though
