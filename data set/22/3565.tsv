2008-08-03T11:21:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	ha! i just had the same thing happen
2008-08-03T11:22:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	open a terminal and sudo killall -9 locale-gen  - don't worry about any other errors - when it's all over and reboots, just sudo dpkg --configure -a  from ctrl-alt-f1  before logging into the gui
2008-08-03T11:22:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	yes. i just noticed that mine just stumbled across language-support-writing-en
2008-08-03T11:24:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	heh, i just nailed locale-gen again and it's going again
2008-08-03T11:25:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	it's a bug that's already been reported, actually
2008-08-03T11:27:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	it asked me if i wanted to report it or not ;)
2008-08-03T11:36:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	^^^^
2008-08-03T11:40:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	yes.
2008-08-03T11:41:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	yeah, i just looked at the process list and bam, there it was again
2008-08-03T11:43:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	hrm, let me think about that one for a nanosecond.. let's see, i had to killall -9 locale-gen before....
2008-08-03T11:44:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	just read the manpage ;)
2008-08-03T11:46:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	this is what the bug reporting system is for.
2008-08-03T11:50:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	i'm.. working on that :)
2008-08-03T11:50:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	ah - sudo apt-get -f install
2008-08-03T11:51:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	moment...
2008-08-03T11:56:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	ok, it just rebooted just fine....
2008-08-03T11:57:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	and now, the locales are generating
2008-08-03T11:59:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	i just ran sudo apt-get -f install  and it just finished everything up. upgrade complete! :)
2009-01-12T19:27:00.000Z	Gnea	nnull	could be a pulseaudio anomoly
