2006-03-06T07:35:00.000Z	pudland		HELP.... cant install openssh-server (ubuntu4), depends ...client (ubuntu4) but client(ubuntu4.1) installed.
2006-03-06T07:36:00.000Z	LjL	pudland	i suppose you've tried "sudo apt-get update"? because the ssh-server that's in the repositories for me is version ubuntu4.1
2006-03-06T07:36:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	yup tried
2006-03-06T07:36:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	can you paste your repo?
2006-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	LjL	pudland	"my repo" is the standard Breezy repos
2006-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	LjL	pudland	i can paste my sources.list if you like, but i'm not sure that will gain you anything
2006-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	well what the #$#*#
2006-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	try please
2006-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	LjL	pudland	what does "apt-cache policy openssh-server" tell you?
2006-03-06T07:37:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	brb

2006-03-06T07:40:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	i'll compare and try again.  thanks
2006-03-06T07:41:00.000Z	LjL	pudland	oh... i think it looks like they're updating your mirrors right now
2006-03-06T07:41:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	do the mirrors look legit though???
2006-03-06T07:42:00.000Z	LjL	pudland	the ones i can see from that error look alright to me
2006-03-06T07:43:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	i just FreeNX'd my other breezy box and that has the right version server installed.
2006-03-06T08:04:00.000Z	pudland	LjL	used official sources.list, prob fixed.
2006-11-03T06:53:00.000Z	LjL	pudland	if you don't have any user who's an admin, yes
