2007-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	henkdetank		i just installed ubuntu 7 webserver (lamp)
2007-08-26T07:29:00.000Z	henkdetank		i shared the www folder on my network

2007-08-26T07:29:00.000Z	henkdetank		but every time i create a folder
2007-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	henkdetank		the permissions are not right
2007-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	henkdetank		ok, sorry
2007-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	so you are sharing files on your local network using apache and the files are in the www directory, or are you trying to export the www directory on your local network
2007-08-26T07:31:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	define your problem then specifically, is it apache or samba that is the problem
2007-08-26T07:32:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	create a folder using a webabpp on apache ? That is because the apache server runs in low-priviledged mode and probably cant write
2007-08-26T07:33:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	is it connected to the internet is it connected locally?
2007-08-26T07:34:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	bit offtopic for ubuntu i suppose, but you can achieve such a setup and secure it in different ways, depending on what you need and security requirements
2007-08-26T07:36:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	if your box is not connected and does not run in shared mode the most simple approach is to chmod 777 on the www dir, that should allow any webapp to do anything in that directory. If it is connceted to the internet that is a really bad idea
2007-08-26T07:36:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	is it connected to the internet publicly? or is it on an internal lan
2007-08-26T07:38:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	it's not specific for ubuntu, and in general securing systems is complicated and techincal and best not left to novice users, You are probably better of using your webhosters service
2007-08-26T07:39:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	you are running a simple lam/php system which runs just one domain?
2007-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	same deal
2007-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	securing it
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	google for securing lamp
2007-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	but there is a reason why people provide just those serviecs as a buisness
2007-08-26T07:47:00.000Z	rexy_	henkdetank	if it's just used internal security is less of an issue really, just set the permissions as the programs wants and it will work just fine
