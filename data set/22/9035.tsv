2005-08-09T14:58:00.000Z	jasoncohen		that's always been an annoyance on linux. it's easy to f*** up the system
2005-08-09T14:00:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	yes... although he would rather you go to the wiki to see that...
2005-08-09T14:00:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	Beep is XMMS for GTK+2.x
2005-08-09T14:01:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	has different file browsers etc
2005-08-09T14:01:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	you have libmad0 installed though
2005-08-09T14:01:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	dpkg -l libmad0 if ya don't believe me  ;)
2005-08-09T14:01:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	yes
2005-08-09T14:01:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	thats what he's missing
2005-08-09T14:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	libmad0 is a dependency of amarok i believe
2005-08-09T14:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	actually, it's a dependency of mplayer
2005-08-09T14:03:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	apt-cache rdepends libmad0
2005-08-09T14:03:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	irrelivant... its on your system... and thats why XMMS can play MP3's
2005-08-09T14:03:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	but as i said- IF you installed gstreamer0.8-mad you would have libmad0
2005-08-09T14:04:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	gstreamer0.8-mad depends on libmad0
2005-08-09T14:04:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	I know....
2005-08-09T14:04:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	so the solution for all players is "sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad"- not just gstreamer based players
2005-08-09T14:05:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	tell Seveas that
2005-08-09T14:06:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	technically though, yes... although with KDE, you need akode-mad.... but then, thats not even listed on that page... so I guess thats not important
2005-08-09T14:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	there is no akode-mad package
2005-08-09T14:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	it's akode-mpeg
2005-08-09T14:09:00.000Z	lunitik	jasoncohen	apokryphos is way ahead of you... but thanks for your input
2005-08-09T14:09:00.000Z	jasoncohen	lunitik	heh, iddn't see that
