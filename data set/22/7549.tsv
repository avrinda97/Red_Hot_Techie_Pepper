2006-09-25T10:27:00.000Z	Locke		WEP and not broadcasting SSID is enough that you'll probably never have somebody unauthorized on your network
2006-09-25T10:27:00.000Z	Locke		and if you want more peace of mind, just enable mac filtering
2006-09-25T10:28:00.000Z	Locke		how is mac filtering worthless?
