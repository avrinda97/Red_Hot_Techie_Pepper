2006-06-03T08:16:00.000Z	TrendKi||		well, ill have to try anyways
2006-06-03T08:16:00.000Z	TrendKi||		i would like to get xen running with the 2.6.15 kernel
2006-06-03T08:16:00.000Z	TrendKi||		is that even possible?
2006-06-03T08:17:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	yes
2006-06-03T08:17:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	Xen is essentially a kernel patch, you download it from xen and apply to whatever kernel source you choose
2006-06-03T08:18:00.000Z	TrendKi||	jighead	arent the patches kernel version spcific?
2006-06-03T08:19:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	the binary xen stuff is kernel specific, but the tarball can be applied against any recent source
2006-06-03T08:20:00.000Z	TrendKi||	jighead	and how bad would it be if i just went and compiled a vanilla 2.6.16 kernel with xen patches and ran that with dapper...? u think it would be unstable...or should i just try and stop wasting your time...lol
2006-06-03T08:21:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	it'll run fine
2006-06-03T08:21:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	xen3 is pretty sweet
2006-06-03T08:22:00.000Z	TrendKi||	jighead	DBO, thanks for the answers guys
2006-06-03T08:22:00.000Z	TrendKi||	jighead	u have it running?
2006-06-03T08:22:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	most of the linux distros +1 plans are to run xen kernels
2006-06-03T08:22:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	I did at work for a while and my motherboard died
2006-06-03T08:22:00.000Z	TrendKi||	jighead	and which kernel were u using?
2006-06-03T08:23:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	I am going to run dual failover load-balanced servers with xen domU's for our core services
2006-06-03T08:23:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	I was using 2.6.15 straight from kernel.org
2006-06-03T08:24:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	there is an install script in the xen source tarball that goes and gets the latest source for you
2006-06-03T08:25:00.000Z	TrendKi||	jighead	sounds like sweet stuff....i just want to run a lamp server on a domu my desktop (dom0) so i can get rid of my old p2 server
2006-06-03T08:26:00.000Z	jighead	TrendKi||	it'll work, give it a shot
2006-06-03T08:26:00.000Z	TrendKi||	jighead	aight....lets do this...lol
