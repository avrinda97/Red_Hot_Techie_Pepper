2006-09-11T14:58:00.000Z	Rimu		so, mojo: you don't actually use your computer for anything, do you?
2006-09-11T14:58:00.000Z	Rimu		cos if you did, switching distros that often would be extremly disruptive....
2006-09-11T14:58:00.000Z	Rimu		:)
2006-09-11T15:00:00.000Z	Rimu		i have a CD here... when mounting it in ubuntu i don't see all the files
2006-09-11T15:00:00.000Z	Rimu		any idea why?
2006-09-11T15:00:00.000Z	Rimu		yes
2006-09-11T15:00:00.000Z	Rimu		you do
2006-09-11T15:02:00.000Z	Rimu		i have a CD here... when mounting it in ubuntu i don't see all the files. both in nautilus and via a shell
2006-09-11T15:02:00.000Z	Rimu		in windows i can see all the files
2006-09-11T15:02:00.000Z	Rimu		is ubuntu trying to read the wrong file system or something?
2006-09-11T15:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rimu	youcan select to see hidden files and folders..
2006-09-11T15:03:00.000Z	Rimu		but wouldn't they show up using 'ls' if they were hidden?
2006-09-11T15:03:00.000Z	Rimu	ompaul	a SDK
2006-09-11T15:03:00.000Z	Rimu		there is supposed to be 3 folders and an install script.
2006-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	Rimu		i can see some of the files, but they're not in their folders; they just appear to be in the root
2006-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	Rimu		bizarre
2006-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rimu	how did you untar the file
2006-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	Rimu		it came as an iso, which i burnt to a cd
2006-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	Rimu		mounting the iso as a virtual cd has the same effect
2006-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	Rimu		where i can't see all the files
2006-09-11T15:05:00.000Z	Rimu		so i'm wondering if there is something wrong with the iso... yet that cd looks as it should in windows
2006-09-11T15:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Rimu	Did yhey offer an md5 checksum to test your cd/iso
