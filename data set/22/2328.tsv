2009-07-19T11:36:00.000Z	Threetimes		Hi, I have a dual-monitor setup. Once I'm logged in, everything works fine. When usplash shows the loading bar, my smaller monitor says "Out of range".
2009-07-19T11:37:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	That's normal. If everything (can be a pain in the a..) is set up correctly your 2nd monitor will get a picture when x has started
2009-07-19T11:38:00.000Z	Threetimes	Neroon	Can I somehow change the usplash resolution? Per monitor or both at once? X works fine.
2009-07-19T11:39:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	you'd need to go down as far as 320x200 or 640x480, not quite sure
2009-07-19T11:39:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	But what for?
2009-07-19T11:40:00.000Z	Threetimes	Neroon	my right monitor is only capable of 1024*768 or lower. It recieves thge 1440*900 signal for the left monitor.
2009-07-19T11:41:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	Only can speak from my experience with tv out (1024x768 possible) but at boot only very low resolutions work, if i want to see the boot sequence
2009-07-19T11:41:00.000Z	Threetimes	Neroon	how (what config file) DO I CHANGE IT
2009-07-19T11:42:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	using grub, i guess?
2009-07-19T11:43:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	Yes/No?
2009-07-19T11:44:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	using grub, i guess?
2009-07-19T11:47:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	Then just add vga=773 to your boot config
2009-07-19T11:48:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	I'd start low with 256
2009-07-19T11:48:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	32k colors would be 790
2009-07-19T11:49:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	for booting 16 million colors?
2009-07-19T11:49:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	Must be a hell of a background ...
2009-07-19T11:49:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	Like running irc with 16 million colors
2009-07-19T11:50:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	Seems you dont boot with 16 million colors now ...
2009-07-19T11:55:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	after you found the one working for you, you might want to add it to defoptions, so you dont need to add it manually after every kernel update
2009-07-19T11:57:00.000Z	Threetimes	Neroon	devoptions? where is thet?
2009-07-19T11:58:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	also in the menu.list from grub
2009-07-19T12:01:00.000Z	Neroon	Threetimes	Found the devoptions line?
