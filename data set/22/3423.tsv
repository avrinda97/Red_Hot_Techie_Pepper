2008-11-11T06:32:00.000Z	mindrape	dewente	- pull up a commandline and ssh -u username 1.2.3.4
2008-11-11T06:32:00.000Z	mindrape	dewente	- if he is behind a firewall/router you need to open up ports to let you in by the hair of your chiny chin chin
2008-11-11T06:33:00.000Z	dewente	mindrape	by the browser i can see the port open
2008-11-11T06:34:00.000Z	dewente	mindrape	when i try to connect remotely from otrer pc in the same network i can log in .. but when i try from outside ... i dont ..  http://72.66.94.115:22/
2008-11-11T06:35:00.000Z	mindrape	dewente	- well its probably because somewhere on the network port 22 is being blocked from incoming requests.
2008-11-11T06:35:00.000Z	mindrape	dewente	also, you realize that is using the http protocol on port 22?   You need ssh://72.66.94.115:22

2008-11-21T08:35:00.000Z	mindrape	dewente	- you have to know a bunch of things to get paid a lot... just knowing 1 thing really well usually gives you limited ability to make moolah
