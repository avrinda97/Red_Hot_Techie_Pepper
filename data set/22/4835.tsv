2010-05-29T06:50:00.000Z	bazhang	mado	seems like a good place to discuss would be #ubuntu-offtopic, for general chat; there is also ##hardware , unless its strictly Ubuntu support issue
2010-05-29T06:50:00.000Z	mado	bazhang	/ cao  ... can we discuss it in #ubuntu-offtopic then? ... or somewhere in a private window?
