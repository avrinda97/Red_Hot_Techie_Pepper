2006-01-05T07:49:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	   how much RAM does it have?
2006-01-05T07:50:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	   type in a terminal      free    and tell us the total/ used /and free
2006-01-05T07:51:00.000Z	odat	pashaw	i have 776552 in total memory and about half of that is being used
2006-01-05T07:52:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	  looking at free again how does your swap look   size and used
2006-01-05T07:53:00.000Z	odat	pashaw	swap is 2273156     0 being used
2006-01-05T07:54:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	  your good there  as it is then     how long til the slow down starts?   3 hours?    what programs are running when it starts?
2006-01-05T07:56:00.000Z	odat	pashaw	the whole system is slower than it used to be    start ups are slower and each time it does the manual check after 30 start ups there are file system problems that need to be fixed  it appears the file system and the hard drive don't like eachother very much
2006-01-05T08:00:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	   what your describing now  can be a dozen things
2006-01-05T08:00:00.000Z	odat	pashaw	well i would like to know where to start
2006-01-05T08:01:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	  bad cable  causing drive corruption    error in the IDE module your running      config error   bad shutdowns
2006-01-05T08:01:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	  or  drive simply going bad  for  heat   wearing out  etc
2006-01-05T08:01:00.000Z	pashaw	odat	  you need to fix the corrution before  slowness
2006-01-05T08:02:00.000Z	odat	pashaw	k how would i go about fixing the corruption
2006-01-07T13:18:00.000Z	odat	pashaw	have you done DMA stuff?
