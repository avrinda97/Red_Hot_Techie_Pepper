2011-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	yes
2011-07-03T00:51:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	I think you're using vi
2011-07-03T00:51:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	which is extremely confusing
2011-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	care to elaborate on that?
2011-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	Hwo are you starting nano ?
2011-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	nano *textfile*
2011-07-03T00:53:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	then perhaps I'm wrong!  Can you explain the problem again?  nano is very straightforward
2011-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	I move the directional button across a word. Everything on the line above it gets copied to where I move. Very strange!
2011-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	arrow buttons you mean?
2011-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	mmmm I'm not sure.  I have nano it is working normally for me.
2011-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	So, what do I do then? I have some textfiles to edit. Thanks for answering.
2011-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	use gedit instead? gksudo gedit /path/to/file  ?
2011-07-03T00:59:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	I don't have gedit... How do i get it...?
2011-07-03T00:59:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	is this a server?
2011-07-03T00:59:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	ubuntu 11.04 ?
2011-07-03T01:00:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	Yes, it's a server. I don't recall
2011-07-03T01:00:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	My friend set it up, so it's very light...
2011-07-03T01:00:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	gedit is graphical so that won't work.
2011-07-03T01:01:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	what version of Ubuntu is this?
2011-07-03T01:01:00.000Z	FireVisor	edbian	know a command on how to check?
2011-07-03T01:01:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	cat /etc/issue
2011-07-03T01:06:00.000Z	edbian	FireVisor	sudo apt-get purge nano   sudo apt-get install nano   (one command removes)
