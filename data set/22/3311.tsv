2009-03-02T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	Bearshare LOL  P2P program?
2009-03-02T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	don't use that anymore.   torrents and  Frostwire  :D
2009-03-02T23:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	yes Bareshare is a load of rubbish
2009-03-02T23:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	real downloaders use torrents
2009-03-02T23:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	plus instead of Limewire which is also rubbish there is Frostwire
2009-03-02T23:58:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	sebsebseb	yeah i know... but i cant use torrent here.. im at cafe now and sharing network with many people... torrent eat much bandwidth...
2009-06-08T21:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	wine-doors is  not made anymore I think
2009-06-08T21:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	try winetricks instead, and both of those programs are like addons for Wine
2009-06-08T21:49:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	sebsebseb	but, i download and install it using ubuntu-tweak software
2009-06-08T21:50:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	sebsebseb	so wine-door is an addon for wine?
2009-06-08T21:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	hummmm  I  woudn't even recomend  ubuntu-tweak   I think, because  well  nevermind
2009-06-08T21:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	Google them
2009-11-18T02:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	now you :)
2009-11-18T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	first of all,  anti virus for Desktop Linux at this time, is not needed,  unless for example your doing an email server, and so need to scan for Windows viruses
2009-11-18T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	plus you can use  programs such as ClamAV to  scan Windows partitions for viruses
2009-11-18T02:39:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	sebsebseb	yes i know. in linux many people think dont need antivirus. i used both linux & windoz. what happen i use a pendrive contain virus, and need to clean all of them in linux?
2009-11-18T02:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	yes that can be done
2009-11-18T02:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	try ClamAV for that
2009-11-18T02:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	well  you could do Avast for Linux as well
2009-11-18T02:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unitedpotsmokers	by the way not all anti viruses are going to pick up on exactly the same stuff
