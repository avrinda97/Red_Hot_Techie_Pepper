2006-12-15T11:25:00.000Z	_Rebecca		Anyone else having streaming audio issues with Mplayer?
2006-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	what kind of issues?
2006-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	I did a system update, and my streaming audio stopped working
2006-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	it was working fine before I updated
2006-12-15T11:27:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	when you start mplayer from a terminal, does it give you an error message?
2006-12-15T11:28:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	whats the mplayer command for starting it in the terminal?
2006-12-15T11:30:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	 maybe you'll have to specify the file its supposed to stream when its started from a terminal. Then it should look like mplayer http://mediafileidliketostream.ogg or something
2006-12-15T11:30:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	I don't appear to be getting any errors when starting from terminal
2006-12-15T11:33:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	ok I see a few errors here
2006-12-15T11:34:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	try with Totem or rhythmbox
2006-12-15T11:35:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	what was the errors. Could you paste them to a pastebin and post the link to the pastebin here?

2006-12-15T11:42:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	Thanks for your help
2006-12-15T11:43:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	no problem. what happens if you paste the link directly in to your browser?

2006-12-15T11:45:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	its just an audio stream, it worked fine before I did an update, how strange
2006-12-15T11:47:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	hmm, might the link be broken?
2006-12-15T11:47:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	the link works on the other computer

2006-12-15T13:16:00.000Z	lassegs	_Rebecca	hi. how did the streaming issue go?
2006-12-15T13:59:00.000Z	_Rebecca	lassegs	I resolved it for now, but I can only get it to play in the terminal
