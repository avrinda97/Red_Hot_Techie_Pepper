2011-10-28T08:48:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123		*cough* can someone help me with a really dumb question? I'm trying to install gnome tweak and I don't know how to install things without my software manager...
2011-10-28T08:49:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
2011-10-28T08:50:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	it can't locate it. Where should I put it so it can locate it?
2011-10-28T08:51:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	press "ctrl alt T" to bring up a terminal. then enter the command
2011-10-28T08:51:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	heh, I know to put it in terminal. Terminal's telling me it can't locate the package XP
2011-10-28T08:52:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	then you need to update the repo ?
2011-10-28T08:52:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	the repo?
2011-10-28T08:53:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	"sudo apt-get update"
2011-10-28T08:53:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	ok
2011-10-28T08:54:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	still can't locate it... should I take it out of downloads?
2011-10-28T08:56:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	heh, ok done that twice. Thanks though
2011-10-28T08:57:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	does not work ?
2011-10-28T08:57:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	*
2011-10-28T08:58:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	im pretty sure the package is gnome-tweak-tool. check http://www.ubuntugeek.com/gnome-tweak-tool-a-tool-for-changing-specialised-or-advanced-gnome3-settings.html
2011-10-28T08:59:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	oic. I'll just do what that says
2011-10-28T08:59:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	then just find it and install
2011-10-28T09:00:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	it's still unable to locate it...
2011-10-28T09:01:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	am I not meant to press enter after each line?
2011-10-28T09:04:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	enter those 3 commands seperatedly and in that order
2011-10-28T09:04:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	I did that. i must be doing something wrong, it keeps giving me the same goddamn error
2011-10-28T09:05:00.000Z	s0nee	Tomfoolery123	then google "install gnome-tweak-tool" and try different methods
2011-10-28T09:08:00.000Z	Tomfoolery123	s0nee	I might just ask my dad
