2011-06-27T18:33:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	I've seen this bug before, looking for a solution right now, although my browser has decided to take a nap, just a moment.
2011-06-27T18:34:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	thanks
2011-06-27T18:34:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	Is the exact error: "No such file or directory - /tmp/mysql.sock"
2011-06-27T18:36:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	no. Please see here: http://pastie.org/2128975
2011-06-27T18:42:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	Do you have data in this database that you need to keep?
2011-06-27T18:43:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	no, it's a fresh install
2011-06-27T18:44:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	Okay, lets try this then: sudo apt-get purge mysql-server-5.1 && sudo rm /var/lib/mysql && sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.1
2011-06-27T18:45:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	rm: cannot remove `/var/lib/mysql': Is a directory - should I do rm -rf and add a / ?
2011-06-27T18:45:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	yes, please. sorry.

2011-06-27T18:47:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	Can you gain interactive access to mysql now?
2011-06-27T18:48:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	no, same exact error
2011-06-27T18:56:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	I'm finding so many people having this same issue, but all with different solutions.
2011-06-27T18:56:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	I have been googling for two days...what's the most recent ubuntu without this upstart thing?
2011-06-27T18:57:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	Ranging from for some reason /etc/mysql/my.cnf is missing, to being out of disk space, to /etc/init/mysql.conf missing a space.
2011-06-27T18:57:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	8.04 iirc.
2011-06-27T18:57:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	Althoug 10.04 had less upstartisms
2011-06-27T18:57:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	:( too old, I need php 5.3... my mysql.conf is not missing a space (just checked), I have plenty of space, my.cnf is where it should be...
2011-06-27T18:59:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	You could try asking in #mysql and/or #ubuntu-server as well.
2011-06-27T19:00:00.000Z	Pici	koichirose	Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
2011-06-27T19:00:00.000Z	koichirose	Pici	no problem :) thank you
