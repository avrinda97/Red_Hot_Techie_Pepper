2008-02-25T17:10:00.000Z	sarthor_		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57320/ i jave have made this change with 2nd gateway
2008-02-25T17:11:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	i dont see the difference
2008-02-25T17:15:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	 naw that is very improbably a virus
2008-02-25T17:18:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	agree with slart
2008-02-25T17:23:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	np:)
2008-02-25T17:24:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	haha what does that mean?
2008-02-25T17:25:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	?
2008-02-25T17:27:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	as Slart said before, take a closer look to that computers with identical ip adresses, one of them for sure has it set to static instead of dhcp
2008-02-25T17:27:00.000Z	sarthor_	fx|RabBit	i have check serveral time, there is not static ip.
2008-02-25T17:27:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	OR set that dhcp range to something completely different in your cfg
2008-02-25T17:28:00.000Z	sarthor_	fx|RabBit	i change all the ip setting to manual, but the problem was not solved
2008-02-25T17:28:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	you set all of the ips manually and still had dupilcates??
2008-02-25T17:28:00.000Z	sarthor_	fx|RabBit	Yes,
2008-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	sarthor_	fx|RabBit	its the problem from 1 month here, in my 4 cafes
2008-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	that problem occurs on 4 different locations???
2008-02-25T17:30:00.000Z	sarthor_	fx|RabBit	Yes, on differenct locatoin same problem
2008-02-25T17:30:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	because if you have that problem with manually set ips its for sure not a linux dhcp server problem...
2008-02-25T17:31:00.000Z	sarthor_	fx|RabBit	Yes, i can see on defferent computer "ip confliction" but when i put the command "ipconfig" there is not other ip.
2008-02-25T17:33:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	ipconfig returns two different ips or twice the same??
2008-02-25T17:33:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	on two different computers?
2008-02-25T17:34:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	sarthor_	pls join into channel #sarthor
