2005-11-07T17:21:00.000Z	bolrod		hmm
2005-11-07T17:21:00.000Z	bolrod		where is the config where the initial user is set?
2005-11-07T17:22:00.000Z	bolrod		I thought I saw it once
2005-11-07T17:22:00.000Z	bolrod		but that maybe in sudo'ers
2005-11-07T17:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	the first user's UID is 1000
2005-11-07T17:22:00.000Z	bolrod	apokryphos	I know
2005-11-07T17:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	the first user is made a member of the admin group -- check sudoers. Admin group has sudo powers
2005-11-07T17:23:00.000Z	bolrod	apokryphos	ah... I removed myself from sudoers
2005-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	well, you were never explicitly in sudoers. Only the admin group is declared. Though, it would be a pretty silly thing to remov eit
2005-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	bolrod	apokryphos	aha
2005-11-07T17:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	why were you mucking around with sudoers file? Obviously going to be a recipe for disaster if you don't know what you're doing...
2005-11-07T17:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	erm, so just fix the sudoers file then with root
2005-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	because that's what Ubuntu uses. The programs are patched to use it
2005-11-07T17:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	why not? It's a superior model.
2005-11-07T17:27:00.000Z	bolrod	apokryphos	why?
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	great logic ;-). That applies to root
2005-11-07T17:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	a lot of reasons are listed on the wiki, IIRC; check that out
2005-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	sudo gives you the power to choose who runs what as who; no such capability with root.
2005-11-07T17:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	if someone wanted to execute root priv commands, they'd still need to know *your* password
2005-11-07T17:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	if you don't want a given user to have sudo powers, then they shouldn't have them (considering it's your computer)
2005-11-24T11:31:00.000Z	bolrod	apokryphos	I had some dependancy problems with debian with it..
2005-11-24T11:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	bolrod	there are perfectly working sun java debs for Ubuntu
