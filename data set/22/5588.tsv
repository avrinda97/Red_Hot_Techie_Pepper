2007-10-20T05:10:00.000Z	pyrak		whats the command to run something
2007-10-20T05:10:00.000Z	pyrak		such as a .install file
2007-10-20T05:10:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	./install
2007-10-20T05:11:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	you need to tell the shell that it's in the current directory
2007-10-20T05:12:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	you want to run it from the gui or from the shell?
2007-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	tried "./intall" ?
2007-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	without the quote of course
2007-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	huch ... you see the file when you do a ls?
2007-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	pyrak	sammyF	if that means "dir", then yes
2007-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	yes .. ls is the dir command for linux
2007-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	try this :  "chmod 755 install"
2007-10-20T05:15:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	then "./install"
2007-10-20T05:16:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	no ... you just type the name of the command
2007-10-20T05:17:00.000Z	pyrak	sammyF	it's not a command, it's a .install file
2007-10-20T05:17:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	chmod just changes the attributes of the file
2007-10-20T05:18:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	may I ask what it installs?
2007-10-20T05:19:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	when you type more .install, does it look like a script?
2007-10-20T05:19:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	"more .install"
2007-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	pyrak	sammyF	it's a file with extension .install
2007-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	pyrak	sammyF	the file is called lxx74.install
2007-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	lol ... okay .. I did misunderstand it :)
2007-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	sammyF	pyrak	thought the file was called .install
