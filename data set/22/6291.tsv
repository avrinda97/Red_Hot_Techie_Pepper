2006-12-06T17:27:00.000Z	VigoFusion	labanux	I am a wee noob when it comes to Linux/Debian commands. This distro is so great because most all can be done in GUI mode.
2006-12-06T17:31:00.000Z	VigoFusion	labanux	Can you Xorg: the keyboard to get the setup that you prefer?
2006-12-06T17:37:00.000Z	labanux	VigoFusion	wait minute.., il try it
2006-12-06T17:45:00.000Z	VigoFusion	labanux	My error, I did not ask if you were useing KDE or Gnome
