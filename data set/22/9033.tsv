2005-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	flawd		Good.
2005-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	flawd		ty
2005-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	flawd		I think the preview is quite buggy but also quite stable for a preview release.
2005-03-29T15:18:00.000Z	flawd		btw, how can I edit the program menues in gnome?
2005-03-29T15:18:00.000Z	flawd		I am
2005-03-29T15:20:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	i just tried it and it works
2005-03-29T15:21:00.000Z	flawd	topyli	nice
2005-03-29T17:09:00.000Z	flawd	topyli	hah
2005-03-29T17:21:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	in 2.10 that's what they do
2005-03-29T17:21:00.000Z	flawd	topyli	that sucks
2005-03-29T17:22:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	i guess, if you don't want it that way :)
2005-03-29T17:23:00.000Z	flawd	topyli	I want the option to have them eithr on top or not, not that someone decides that its best that the eventual notes I want shall always cover my current application so I can not see some important thing on it
2005-03-29T17:24:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	they probably think you want to hide them or show them. that's why there's an extra item in the notes applet menu
2005-03-29T17:25:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	or they want everyone to migrate to tomboy :)
2005-03-29T17:25:00.000Z	flawd	topyli	umm what extra menuitem? there is no "Hide notes" or something here
2005-03-29T17:26:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	left click the applet. there's "new note" and "hide/show"
2005-03-29T17:28:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	speaking of tomboy, installing it will take 41.9 M of disk space on my box. hmm.
2005-03-29T17:28:00.000Z	flawd	topyli	never heard of it
2005-03-29T17:28:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	yeah, wiki steroids
2005-03-29T17:28:00.000Z	flawd	topyli	need to check it out
2005-03-29T17:29:00.000Z	topyli	flawd	jdub called it the "ultimate sticky wiki" :)
