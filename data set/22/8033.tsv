2007-01-10T07:12:00.000Z	sexbox		im on windows right now.. trying to dual boot with ubuntu to give linux a try
2007-01-10T07:13:00.000Z	sexbox		press alt+f2 via copy paste? lol

2007-01-10T07:13:00.000Z	sexbox		i try using my keyboard in ubuntu and it doesnt work..
2007-01-10T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	what kind of keyboard is that?
2007-01-10T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	USB or PS/2?
2007-01-10T07:15:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	try pressing Alt+F2 in Linux as suggested, and see if the keyboard works from there (that'll switch you to a text-mode terminal). if it works there, it means the problem is confined to X
2007-01-10T07:17:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	just try, it might work, it's a special key combination. but actually, it's Ctrl+Alt+F2, sorry. or you can try booting in recovery mode, that'll skip out X entirely
2007-01-10T07:18:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	mouse works?
2007-01-10T07:20:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	which version of Ubuntu is this by the way?
2007-01-10T07:25:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	you can positively confirm that your Ubuntu graphical interface itself works, anyway? i.e. with the mouse you can do actions, start programs and all?
2007-01-10T07:26:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	this is a weird problem tbh, i don't think i've ever seen it before. i'm aware of widespread problems with keyboards like the system missing keystrokes or repeating them, but never the keyboard being totally unresponsive
2007-01-10T07:27:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	small case
2007-01-10T07:30:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	perhaps if you have a USB keyboard hanging around...
2007-01-10T07:30:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	hm, i think adapters are USB *to* PS/2 most of the times, though i could be wrong
2007-01-10T07:32:00.000Z	LjL	sexbox	i've never seen them, but that doesn't mean they don't exist :) well before just buying a new keyboard i'd investigate it a little more, after all if it won't work with a USB keyboard either, you'll basically just have wasted money
