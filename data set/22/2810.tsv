2009-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	no offense was intended to ganesh.
2009-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	not to him.. but for our god..
2009-05-31T15:04:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	None was intended for Lord Ganesh, either.  I apologize, if it was taken that way.
2009-05-31T15:04:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	no prob.. are u too from india?
2009-05-31T15:05:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	I am from Texas.  I used to work for a company from Bangalore.
2009-05-31T15:05:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	Oh.. ok..
2009-05-31T15:08:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	Are you running 9.04 with both jaunty and kosmic repositories?  That is a recipe for lots of things not working.
2009-05-31T15:09:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	yes.. thats the problem..
2009-05-31T15:09:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	I suggest you wipe and reinstall.
2009-05-31T15:10:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	oh god..
2009-05-31T15:10:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	I am running kosmic on a test machine.  It is good to try it.  But mixing versions like that is not good.
2009-05-31T15:10:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	oh..
2009-05-31T15:11:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	do u know what are all the sound related packages of ubuntu?
2009-05-31T15:12:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	No.
2009-05-31T15:15:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	oh..
2009-05-31T15:17:00.000Z	Severian	mohan_	When trying the test versions of Ubuntu, the best advice I found was this.  If you are ever offered to do a partial upgrade, refuse and try again later.
2009-05-31T15:17:00.000Z	mohan_	Severian	ok..
