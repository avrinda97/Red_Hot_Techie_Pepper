2005-04-27T14:18:00.000Z	onno		Does anybody have experience with firestarter.... I just installed it. But it complains about eth0 not wel configured
2005-04-27T14:18:00.000Z	Nula	onno	is eth0 your only active network card?
2005-04-27T14:20:00.000Z	onno	Nula	yes, but I also have eht1
2005-04-27T14:22:00.000Z	onno	Nula	when I hit the start buttun it says (dutch) that eth0 is not ready...
2005-04-27T14:22:00.000Z	Nula	onno	are both of your eth setup properly in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2005-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	onno	Nula	looks like that file is ok
2005-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	Nula	onno	you can configure your network cards using the graphical interface under System -> Administration -> Netowrking
2005-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	Nula	onno	or you can manually add your interfaces to /etc/network/interfaces
2005-04-27T14:26:00.000Z	Nula	onno	did you follow the Firestarter wizard and assign the correct eth device for external and internal network?
2005-04-27T14:27:00.000Z	Nula	onno	my guess is that only one of your interfaces is configured properly. are you trying to share internet ??
2005-04-27T14:30:00.000Z	onno	Nula	ok the problem is with internet sharing
2005-04-27T14:32:00.000Z	Nula	onno	open your /etc/network/interfaces and copy the lines that are for eth0 for eth1
2005-04-27T14:32:00.000Z	Nula	onno	then run the Firestarter wizard again
2005-04-27T14:33:00.000Z	Nula	onno	iface eth1 inet dhcp
2005-04-27T14:35:00.000Z	Nula	onno	try /etc/init.d/network restart
2005-04-27T14:35:00.000Z	Nula	onno	oops
2005-04-27T14:36:00.000Z	Nula	onno	/etc/init.d/networking restart .. ignore the first one
2005-04-27T14:37:00.000Z	onno	Nula	it is still complaining about eth0 in Firestarter and on the command line about eth1?
2005-04-27T14:38:00.000Z	onno	Nula	it was only one line I needed to copy in that file?
2005-04-27T14:38:00.000Z	Nula	onno	that's really odd.. I have never setup ICS through firestarter. I have always manually configured that so I'm not sure what the firestarted wizard does/expects
2005-04-27T14:40:00.000Z	Nula	onno	I do suggest you try configuring eth1 through the graphical tool I told you about
2005-04-27T14:41:00.000Z	Nula	onno	in your case eth0 was the device... if you go through the gui you'll see that eth1 is not configured.. I suggest you configure eth1 by assigning a static ip addres to it such as 192.168.0.1
