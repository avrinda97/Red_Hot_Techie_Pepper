2012-05-08T22:33:00.000Z	ubukou		is there a chrome ppa? im trying to join #chrome but it seems "locked".
2012-05-08T22:34:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	try chromium-browser in the repos/package manager
2012-05-08T22:36:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	i have chromiun installed but i was getting increased "aw snap" messages while trying to watch youtube videos and over at #chromium they told me that i should intall chrome.
2012-05-08T22:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	really ? now why would they recommend a browser not designed for linux over one that is ...sounds like they were just trying to get rid of you.
2012-05-08T22:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	purge chromium-browser , then reinstall , do an updat/upgrade before reinstalling
2012-05-08T22:39:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	that what i thought too..i was accually kicked.ubukou: we don't maintain ubuntu's packages. they don't go through any of our qa process, and we don't receive automated crash dumps from them either.
2012-05-08T22:39:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	that was the last message.
2012-05-08T22:40:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	sudo apt-get remove --purge chromium-browser ??
2012-05-08T22:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	yes
2012-05-08T22:41:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	#chromium channel was really foul in helping out. it is a thumbs down for linux support.
2012-05-08T22:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	then, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-05-08T22:41:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	i ll try it out.
2012-05-08T22:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	then sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
2012-05-08T22:43:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	should i purge chromium-* to include the ffmpeg that probably runs when using youtube?
2012-05-08T22:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	no flash runs in youtube
2012-05-08T22:43:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	i use html5
2012-05-08T22:44:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	at least i think i use html5 when running youtube there is not npviewer.bin in the xfce-task-manager.
2012-05-08T22:45:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	that means i am not running flash right ?
2012-05-08T22:46:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	no i dont think so i just chose the html5 in the youtube settings. at least i think i did, cause chromium is loaded with CPU usage when streaming videos.
2012-05-08T22:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	flash is everywhere on the internet  , just joining the html5 doesn't mean you don't need flash
2012-05-08T22:46:00.000Z	ubukou	BluesKaj	let me try some things and get back to you with the results. thanks a lot for the help
2012-05-08T22:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ubukou	ok
