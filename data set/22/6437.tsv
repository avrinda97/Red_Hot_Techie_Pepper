2006-10-25T07:10:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		fdisk -l
2006-10-25T07:11:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	nothing :-(
2006-10-25T07:11:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		dmesg |grep sd |more
2006-10-25T07:13:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	it doesn't really say in there either... do I need to mount it for it to come up on fdisk?
2006-10-25T07:13:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r	noway_	dmesg is your system kernel messages
2006-10-25T07:14:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		if its not there... then it isnt recognizing it.
2006-10-25T07:15:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	it says that it sees the attached scsi drive, but does not tell me what it translates to in grub
2006-10-25T07:15:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r	noway_	are you using edgy?
2006-10-25T07:16:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	no, drapper
2006-10-25T07:16:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		you should be able to just add the line in fstab and it'll re-do it for you
2006-10-25T07:16:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		what do you mean what it translates to?
2006-10-25T07:16:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	grub has its own identifiers for hard drives right?  like /dev/sda1 -> hd0,4 or something
2006-10-25T07:17:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		no
2006-10-25T07:17:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		./dev/sda1 /mnt/mountpoint filesystemtype options
2006-10-25T07:18:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	I am following the guide here, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-10-25T07:18:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		you need to be here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows#head-778ecd20f83f92ebaa5aaec5f1b4615539c2f8d3
2006-10-25T07:19:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		oh you mean i grub
2006-10-25T07:19:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		not fstab.
2006-10-25T07:19:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		For example, /dev/hda1 is "hd0,0" to GRUB. Similarly, /dev/hdb3 is "hd1,2".
2006-10-25T07:19:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	so /dev/sda1 -> "hd0,?"
2006-10-25T07:20:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r		0,0
2006-10-25T07:20:00.000Z	noway_	Alakazamz0r	ok, thanks... I will give it a shot
