2010-05-03T13:44:00.000Z	solofight	Gnea	"install wvdial" ???
2010-05-03T13:45:00.000Z	Gnea	solofight	it's just like installing anything else:  sudo apt-get install wvdial
2010-05-03T13:46:00.000Z	solofight	Gnea	 ! ! apt-get install downloads the package from internet right ?
2010-05-03T13:46:00.000Z	Gnea	solofight	yes
2010-05-03T13:47:00.000Z	solofight	Gnea	am not connected to net now, thats the problem, howd you expect me to do a apt-get install ?
2010-05-03T13:47:00.000Z	Gnea	solofight	well, I see you're on irc, so you're on the internet...

2010-05-03T13:48:00.000Z	Gnea	solofight	well, you can download the wvdial package and any dependencies to windows and then use the dpkg command to install the .deb files
2010-05-03T13:49:00.000Z	Gnea	solofight	how did you install ubuntu anyway? from cd?
