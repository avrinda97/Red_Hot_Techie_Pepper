2007-05-28T06:09:00.000Z	manu_		hi i made today sudo apt-get install upgrade and there are 3 packages of linux kernel which he dont wants to install
2007-05-28T06:09:00.000Z	manu_		is that bad?
2007-05-28T06:09:00.000Z	manu_		he refuses
2007-05-28T06:10:00.000Z	manu_		and i also heared that  is houldnt do apt-get upgrade in X is that right, only in init 3
2007-05-28T06:10:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	put the exact output of apt-get into a pastebin, and post a link in the channel
2007-05-28T06:10:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	apt-get is safe to do under X
2007-05-28T06:12:00.000Z	manu_	jonaskoelker	http://paste.debian.net/29073
2007-05-28T06:13:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	try sudo aptitude install <the package names>
2007-05-28T06:14:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	and see what it says
2007-05-28T06:22:00.000Z	manu_	jonaskoelker	http://paste.debian.net/29077
2007-05-28T06:23:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	... and then you say Ja if you want to install it
2007-05-28T06:23:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	try it :)
2007-05-28T06:28:00.000Z	manu_	jonaskoelker	ok i do it but why was it refused? and 179mb additional used space is many
2007-05-28T06:28:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	I didn't see it being refused
2007-05-28T06:38:00.000Z	manu_	jonaskoelker	i gave you the link... now its installing, i hope it isnt bad for the system :(
2007-05-28T06:39:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	I figure it isn't.  In any case, you can boot up the old kernel if you don't like the new one
2007-05-28T06:40:00.000Z	manu_	jonaskoelker	hm ok but i'm wondering why the kernel was refused? perhaps it has big dependencies or because it is a new kernel and i have to install it explicit?
2007-05-28T06:41:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	not sure
2007-05-28T06:42:00.000Z	manu_	jonaskoelker	what could be the reason for refused packages?
2007-05-28T06:42:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	manu_	not sure
