2007-11-15T20:58:00.000Z	variant	kuta	that depends on a number of factors

2007-11-15T20:59:00.000Z	variant	kuta	and d. what kind of file or files you are talkign about

2007-11-15T21:03:00.000Z	kuta	variant	I am ok, is testdisk a gui
2007-11-15T21:04:00.000Z	variant	kuta	technically it is a gui, but you would probably think of it as command line when you see it, it is curses based
