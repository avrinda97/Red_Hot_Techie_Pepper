2008-04-01T00:48:00.000Z	Flare183	Flannel	since you are the only one in ubuntu-doc can I ask you a question?
2008-04-21T23:14:00.000Z	Flare183	Flannel	lets hope that works
2008-04-21T23:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Flare183	why wouldn't it work?
2008-04-21T23:15:00.000Z	Flare183	Flannel	Because I had a similar problem before, and I had to reformat my computer to get everything back to working position
2008-04-21T23:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Flare183	That's rediculous.  If all you did was remove yourself from the groups, all you need to do is re-add yourself and you're fine.
2008-04-21T23:18:00.000Z	Flare183	Flannel	I know, but at the time I didn't think about that. But since I know that now. I will never have to go through that again.
