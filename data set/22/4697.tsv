2008-12-26T13:50:00.000Z	kholerabbi		I'm using ubuntu 8.04
2008-12-26T13:52:00.000Z	kholerabbi		I want to mount a usb hardd drive - maxtor brand
2008-12-26T13:53:00.000Z	kholerabbi		I'll restart?
2008-12-26T13:55:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	sloopy is right.  what filesystem is your drive ?
2008-12-26T14:00:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	open a terminal window and type 'sudo fdisk -l' withouth the quotes
2008-12-26T14:01:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	with your external hard drive attached to your computer
2008-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	ok now check what filesystem it is: hfs/ntfs/fat ...
2008-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	ok lol :D
2008-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	sloopy: yep that's right
2008-12-26T14:04:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	does it work ?
2008-12-26T14:06:00.000Z	kholerabbi	musictoto	Iol: I do the above in terminal (with or without sudo) and get 'Cannot create directory... Only root can do that...
2008-12-26T14:06:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	your sudo command should do it :s
2008-12-26T14:10:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	if you want to be able to use that drive on windows/mac too, you'd better use another fs
2008-12-26T14:11:00.000Z	kholerabbi	musictoto	nah not at all. although I might partition of a section for that... I was thinking on installing intrepid on it--
2008-12-26T14:11:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	yes, then ext3 will do
2008-12-26T14:12:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	but not for the win/mac partition
2008-12-26T14:12:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	that should be ntfs
2008-12-26T14:13:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	post back if it works
2008-12-26T14:15:00.000Z	kholerabbi	musictoto	sloopy: thank you :)
2008-12-26T14:16:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	did you manage to mount it ?
2008-12-26T14:17:00.000Z	musictoto	kholerabbi	cool, good luck
