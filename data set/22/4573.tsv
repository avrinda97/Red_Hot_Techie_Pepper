2007-12-10T19:44:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	mount /dev/hdx is NEVER right
2007-12-10T19:45:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	why?
2007-12-10T19:45:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	hdx is no partition. while you can format a whole disk with a filesystem it's bad
2007-12-10T19:46:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	i just used x to refer to the hdd partion number
2007-12-10T19:46:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	hdx is a disk, hdx# is a partition. see the difference?
2007-12-10T19:47:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	aigh't i'll be careful next time
2007-12-10T19:50:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	i didn't see that post
2007-12-10T19:50:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	my mistake. didn't say "sudo" stupid ubuntuism :P
2007-12-10T20:15:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	after libate pretty much all disks are using sd*
2007-12-10T20:16:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	i'll take a look at that
2007-12-10T20:17:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	sdX is the old scsi subsystem of old. by now sata, usb and firewire and most IDE drivers use it too
2007-12-10T20:19:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	you don't
2007-12-19T11:04:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	Eagleray, Phusion: he runs windows, no ubuntu to be seen anywhere. the is OT. if you want to help him please do it in ##windows
2007-12-19T11:29:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	that proxy talk above is for you of course
2007-12-19T11:24:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	can i setup a proxy server out of a ws with only 1 nic and a router?
2007-12-19T11:24:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	proxy what and how exactly?
2007-12-19T11:26:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	i want my ubuntu to be a proxy server however it only has one nic.. i was just thinking if its possibe to connect it to the router and act as a proxy for all the other ws connected to the same router
2007-12-21T07:03:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	3c59x should be it
2007-12-21T07:05:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	how can I use it again? do i just need a reboot or something else?
2007-12-21T07:05:00.000Z	wols_	sunogbaga	modprobe it, if it then works put it in /etc/modules
2007-12-21T07:06:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	ok
2007-12-21T07:39:00.000Z	sunogbaga	wols_	thx.. it's working now.. although network manager won't show the devices, which i think i can live with. :D
