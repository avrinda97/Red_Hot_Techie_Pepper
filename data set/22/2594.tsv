2009-04-30T13:38:00.000Z	DracoZA		I have a question, I have a new installation of 9.04 which works perfectly fine until I take the computer and plug it into a different network switch, then it refuses to connect to the network or obtain an IP address, if I take it back to the original switch it was installed on it works immediately, any advise ?
2009-04-30T13:39:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	are you using DHCP?
2009-04-30T13:39:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	yes I am
2009-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	plug into the the one that does not work, open a terminal and run sudo /etc/init.d/network restart
2009-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	command not found ?
2009-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	ups, that should be sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-04-30T13:44:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	press tab to invoke auto-completion in terminal, this way you will make sure it's ok
2009-04-30T13:44:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	ok it said reconfiguring
2009-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	ifconfig shows no IP information for Eth0
2009-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	when you run sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart, it does not say anything about getting a new lease, right?
2009-04-30T13:47:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	nope just says reconfiguring network interfaces
2009-04-30T13:50:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	nope just says reconfiguring network interfaces
2009-04-30T13:50:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	try sudo dhclient eth0
2009-04-30T13:52:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	no working leases in persistent database, sleeping. Is the message
2009-04-30T13:53:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	so the problem is external. It cannot find a nameserver, so it cannot get an ip address
2009-04-30T13:54:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	if I take that network cable out of that machine and plug it into a machine right next to it, it gets a IP address and everything works fine
2009-04-30T13:55:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	aha, then it's the machines MAC address. The switch must be somehow rejecting it. Have you tried rebooting the switch?
2009-04-30T13:55:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	or looking at its config
2009-04-30T13:55:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	I can try that but its a brainless little 5 port hub not even a switch
2009-04-30T13:57:00.000Z	DracoZA	MagicDuck1	reset the hub, same thing
2009-04-30T14:00:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	the only thing I can think of is the new network applet thingy. It gave me trouble too. Try adding the lines "auto eth0" and "iface eth0 inet dhcp" to /etc/network/interfaces, then kill the applet and do again sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-04-30T14:19:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	DracoZA	did you try removing the default config from System->Preferences->Network Connection and adding again a simple dhcp one without the MAC address specified. Maybe it works.
