2005-09-13T10:39:00.000Z	benplaut	Vaske_Car	i've heard of it, but never found it... i think v6 or something might have come for linux, too
2005-09-13T10:40:00.000Z	benplaut	Vaske_Car	in terms of vectors?

2005-09-13T11:07:00.000Z	Vaske_Car	benplaut	no shadow option in Inscape?
2005-09-13T11:08:00.000Z	benplaut	Vaske_Car	i don't think so...
2005-09-13T11:20:00.000Z	Vaske_Car	benplaut	cant believe there is no tool that support shadow option...
2005-09-13T11:20:00.000Z	benplaut	Vaske_Car	like i was saying, it's feature lacking :(
