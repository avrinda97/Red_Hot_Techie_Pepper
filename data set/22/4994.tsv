2007-08-21T13:15:00.000Z	awg_		nvidia drivers? mismatched version? anyone?
2007-08-21T13:16:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	if I were you I'd uninstall drivers, kernel modules etc and then install using the driver from nvidias website.. It hasn't failed me yet
2007-08-21T13:16:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	failed me already
2007-08-21T13:17:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	did you uninstall the nvidia-kernel module before you installed the nvidia-driver?
2007-08-21T13:18:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	i believe so ... ?
2007-08-21T13:18:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	any error messages?
2007-08-21T13:19:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	same error message every time i start X ... mismatched x driver and kernel driver versions
2007-08-21T13:19:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	ok.. do you use the restricted drivers for anything else?
2007-08-21T13:20:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	not that i know of
2007-08-21T13:20:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	if not.. uninstall the restricted drivers.. search for nvidia in synaptic and uninstall the kernel module if it's installed
2007-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	ok
2007-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	done

2007-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	restricted modules was installed
2007-08-21T13:23:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	nothing else installed with the nvidia name? nvidia-glx nvidia-glx-new etc
2007-08-21T13:23:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	aha, that appears to have worked.
2007-08-21T13:24:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	you got the nvidia-logo at startup?
2007-08-21T13:25:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	no, i have that off, but twinview is working and glx appears to be working
2007-08-21T13:25:00.000Z	Slart	awg_	yay.. glxgears works?
2007-08-21T13:26:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	yep.
2007-08-21T13:26:00.000Z	awg_	Slart	thanks, i'll give it a reboot to make sure i didn't remove anything critical, hopefully i won't be back
