2011-12-03T10:58:00.000Z	z3ro3x	ActionParsnip	Nope.
2011-12-03T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		hmm
2011-12-03T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z3ro3x	is there the ability in Empathy to change the font of the application?
2011-12-03T10:59:00.000Z	z3ro3x		I'll check.
2011-12-03T11:04:00.000Z	z3ro3x	ActionParsnip	Nope.  I just noticed this.  :-/  https://plus.google.com/photos/113729277367184919773/albums/5681778721549743761/5681778719958931698
2011-12-03T11:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z3ro3x	does it happen in any other app?
2011-12-03T11:05:00.000Z	z3ro3x	ActionParsnip	Not that I am aware of.
2011-12-03T11:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z3ro3x	have a sniff around, let me keep hunting'
2011-12-03T11:10:00.000Z	z3ro3x	ActionParsnip	Are you able to see the same issue in Empathy on your side?  I installed (can't remember the package name) Advanced Settings for Gnome Shell.  I can play witht he system wide fonts.  If I change any setting in there from it's default it fixes the problem.  But I'd still like to know what's broke to have a better understanding of the issue.
2011-12-03T11:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z3ro3x	could try:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jacob/comm; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install empathy; sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jacob-comm-*; sudo apt-get update
2011-12-03T11:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z3ro3x	bit of a later build, may help
2011-12-03T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z3ro3x	I don't use empathy, I've used pidgin (and Gaim when it was Gaim) for as long as I've used Linux
2011-12-03T11:17:00.000Z	z3ro3x	ActionParsnip	I may just switch back to pidgin.  I was only using Empathy because it's integrated in Gnome Shell.  The groups are also disorganized in Empathy because of Facebook and Google.  Nothing goes where I tell it to.  Empathy seems more concerned with putting things where the servers want stuff instead of where I want it.  :-/
