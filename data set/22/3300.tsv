2008-10-17T11:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	if you know about unix permissions, yes
2008-10-17T11:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	with the 'chmod' command
2008-10-17T11:58:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	Can I do this in ubuntu as well?
2008-10-17T11:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	well, also with the GUI, actually
2008-10-17T11:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	yes
2008-10-17T11:59:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	ok - got me going in right direction - will do some google info on how to use command or do a "man chmod" at command line - Thanks much
2008-10-17T11:59:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	the command is easy. it's understanding the permissions that can be tricky, if you're not familiar
2008-10-17T12:00:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	GUI app might be easier right now and come back to Terminal later - what do you suggest i install from synaptics?
2008-10-17T12:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	gnome (nautilus, the file manager) can do it. you probably don't have to install anything
2008-10-17T12:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	when you right click on a file, i think. (i don't have gnome)
2008-10-17T12:02:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	Just right click on file and set permission?
2008-10-17T12:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	yes, and be careful
2008-10-17T12:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	what permissions do you want to set? and are they on a regular file or a directory?
2008-10-17T12:02:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	Yea - runing Gnome here - warmed up to it - like it better then KDE as of now....
2008-10-17T12:03:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	It's a Open Office word file.
2008-10-17T12:07:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	sorry - I was trying to set permissions on a test .odt file and will probably need to do it with chmod -
2008-10-17T12:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	exactly what permissions do you want to set?
2008-10-17T12:10:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	I do not want someone to be able to open a .odt file without using a password or if it was even totally hidden as well would work - I know there are ways to do this relatively easy in windows.
2008-10-17T12:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	changing the permissions will affect what users can open the file. passwords don't come into play
2008-10-17T12:13:00.000Z	newlife	prince_jammys	What outbackwifi suggested will be best for now - will try that - thanks for your help - Also when I have time I'am not afraid to learn more about using the Terminal - Thanks again.
2008-10-17T12:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	cool.
2008-10-17T12:15:00.000Z	prince_jammys	newlife	careful with permissions. depending on where you're changing them, they can be a fast way to break things
