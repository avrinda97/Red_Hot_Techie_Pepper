2009-11-06T04:55:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	You have the same problem as yourself?
2009-11-06T04:55:00.000Z	xfire8	prower	: yes
2009-11-06T04:55:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	Interesting :> I think there's pills for that
2009-11-06T05:00:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	What distribution of Linux are you using?
2009-11-06T05:02:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	What distribution of Linux are you using?
2009-11-06T05:03:00.000Z	xfire8	prower	: i tired kubuntu , ubuntu , openSUSE in all i got error
2009-11-06T05:04:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	You do realize that error appears before any Linux distribution would even have a chance to boot, right?
2009-11-06T05:04:00.000Z	xfire8	prower	: yew
2009-11-06T05:04:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	And therefore has nothing to do with Linux, which you aren't even running judging by the version of mIRC you're showing?
2009-11-06T05:05:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	It doesn't happen in Linux, Linux hasn't booted when you get that error
2009-11-06T05:05:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	##hardware
2009-11-06T05:06:00.000Z	xfire8	prower	: you dont undersatnd i have the problem not you
2009-11-06T05:06:00.000Z	xfire8	prower	: this is eomthing in linux
2009-11-06T05:06:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	Actually I do understand, yes, I read the page, that error does _NOT_ appear during Linux bootup
2009-11-06T05:06:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	Because you're completely and utterly wrong, for one?
2009-11-06T05:10:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	Have a link to the most recent firmware for your BIOS that you downloaded, then?
2009-11-06T05:11:00.000Z	xfire8	prower	: i give you a link
2009-11-06T07:26:00.000Z	prower	xfire8	Cut that crap out
