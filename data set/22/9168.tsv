2005-05-20T07:42:00.000Z	Anubis		my system froze
2005-05-20T07:42:00.000Z	Anubis		I think Firefox did it
2005-05-20T07:42:00.000Z	Anubis		and after reboot nautilus is not starting or is dead
2005-05-20T07:42:00.000Z	Anubis		I can't get a desktop
2005-05-20T07:43:00.000Z	Anubis		no tool bar
2005-05-20T07:43:00.000Z	Anubis		no applets
2005-05-20T07:43:00.000Z	Anubis		wtf?
2005-05-20T07:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	run ps aux | grep nautilus and see if there are things running, then kill them
2005-05-20T08:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	if you are in xfce4 some gnome things will probably be running ( xfce seems to use nautilus to draw the desktop for example)
2005-05-20T08:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	did you try ps | aux and look for culprits?
2005-05-20T08:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	it's probably some misbehaving process you can kill the parent of
2005-05-20T08:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	sorry that should have been ` ps aux `
2005-05-20T08:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	so used to using | grep that I put it in the wrong place...
2005-05-31T13:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	NO
2005-05-31T13:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	the meta package is kubuntu-desktop
2005-05-31T13:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	it makes a difference
2005-05-31T13:54:00.000Z	Anubis	thoreauputic	he would have found that out now would'nt he?
2005-05-31T13:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	no, not necessrily
2005-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	bob2 has a clue or two: i suggest you listen
2005-06-13T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	that's an X function, not a wm function
2005-06-13T10:37:00.000Z	Anubis	thoreauputic	well then why does the resolution change with wms then?
2005-06-13T10:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anubis	hmm - I have no idea - never seen that
