2007-05-02T08:00:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07		yes i got volume now but my microphone keeps giving me feedback
2007-05-02T08:01:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07		what can i do to fix my microphone i muted line in and microphone
2007-05-02T08:01:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07		it seems tied to PCM but not sure what that is
2007-05-02T08:01:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	do you see a small speaker icon around the top-right corner of your screen?
2007-05-02T08:02:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	right-click on it and select "Open Volume Control" from the context menu
2007-05-02T08:03:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	if you want to use the mic, unmute it and increase its volume to the desired level.
2007-05-02T08:05:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	oh. then unmute the microphone but decrease the volume to an acceptable level. does that work?
2007-05-02T08:07:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	which slider are you lowering?
2007-05-02T08:08:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	yes your problem makes sense (i think). when you speak into the microphone, you are hearing yourself through the head phones. but you do not want to hear yourself. is that right?
2007-05-02T08:11:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	which slider are you moving? you should be moving the microphone slider not the pcm or master sliders
2007-05-02T08:12:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	is the mic plugged into the microphone slot or the line-in slot?
2007-05-02T08:13:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	try sliding the line-in slider
2007-05-02T08:13:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	what happens if the microphone is muted. you can still hear yourself?
2007-05-02T08:15:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	hmm. i'm not sure then. are you using a headphone-microphone combination?
2007-05-02T08:16:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	maybe it's the device itself. i suppose it's possible that the speakers in the headphones are picking up the same signal being sent to the computer through the microphone. do you have access to another computer (running a different operating system, preferably) to test the device on?
2007-05-02T08:19:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	Open Volume Control again.
2007-05-02T08:19:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	then go to File > Change Device. How many devices are there? Try changing the selected device and muting/unmuting the microphone slider there.
2007-05-02T08:20:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubuntu_user07	which one was selected all this time?
