2011-03-27T22:33:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK		FLASH PLUGIN still WON'T WORK!!!!!!!!
2011-03-27T22:33:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK		firefox 4.0 can't use apturl stuff so I can't install that from adobe AT ALL
2011-03-27T22:35:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK		and also my issue is not that firefox 4.0 won't work with ubuntu 9.10 it can't handle apturl stuff if it could I'd have this problem solved ALREADY
2011-03-27T22:36:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	have you tried installing flash manually?
2011-03-27T22:37:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	I've installed it from the app store or wahtever it is called not manually unsure how to do that
2011-03-27T22:38:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	the manual method is where you actually download the libflashplayer.so file from adobe and place it in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2011-03-27T22:39:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	I tried to download it, but firefox says it can't handle apturl stuff, so it didn't even give me an option to save it
2011-03-27T22:39:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	what version of ubuntu are you using? 32bit or 64?
2011-03-27T22:39:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	32bit
2011-03-27T22:40:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	download this onto your disk http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_10.2_for_Linux_(.tar.gz)
2011-03-27T22:42:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	I put it in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2011-03-27T22:42:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	should I see if it works now?
2011-03-27T22:42:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	no ..first purge any version you installed from the repos..
2011-03-27T22:44:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	first completely remove any earlier versions of flash player that may be installed and then place it under /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2011-03-27T22:45:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	thank you so much it worked!!!!!
2011-03-27T22:46:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	thats the way i have been using flash for 4 years!!..its a bit labourious but always worked....and i as use 64bit..i dont have to update that often...
2011-03-27T22:47:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	glad ..i could help!!:)
2011-03-27T22:47:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	answer me this, why do most people here not know how to get it working as quickly and easily as you do?
2011-03-27T22:47:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	well..thats not entirely true...but yeah..no one knows it all!!!:P
2011-03-27T22:48:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	bonjoyee	I'll try and remember your technique to get it running, apparently nobody asked me if flash player was actually there or to verify it, it wasn't actually there for some reason but it works now and thats really awesome!
2011-03-27T22:49:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	happy youtubing!!;)
2011-03-27T22:50:00.000Z	bonjoyee	THE_GFR|WORK	but remember when you wish to update flash ..you have to do it manually..but it isn't so hard, is it?
