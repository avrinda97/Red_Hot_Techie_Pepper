2008-06-01T19:44:00.000Z	Armada		I've broken my ntfs partition, but I know what's wrong. In the partitiontable it says the partition starts at 63 but it actually starts at 64. How do I fix this?
2008-06-01T19:46:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	I'm not sure if there's an easy way to fix that
2008-06-01T19:46:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	Then what's the hard way? :P
2008-06-01T19:47:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	my advice would be to back up the partition table and take a hex editor to it
2008-06-01T19:47:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	you might also be able to do it with fdisk or gparted, but I'm not so sure about that
2008-06-01T19:48:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	as long as you keep all of the relevant info handy, you could redo the partition table and it won't format anything
2008-06-01T19:48:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	What if I request to move the partition but stop the operation as soon as it corrected the table?
2008-06-01T19:49:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	I think fdisk is transaction-based, it might rollback
2008-06-01T19:49:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	don't quote me on that though
2008-06-01T20:06:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	I would advise that you backup the partition, just in case
2008-06-01T20:06:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	I've shot myself in the foot quite a few times by assuming there was nothing important on a partition
2008-06-01T20:06:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	How? It's no longer readable
2008-06-01T20:07:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	you could do dd if=/dev/(partition) of=backup
2008-06-01T20:07:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	that will do a raw dump of the data on the partition
2008-06-01T20:09:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	Well there is only one file I could possibly want to keep, which is mpdata containing my CoD4 rank
2008-06-01T20:09:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	Other than that I try not to have important files on system disks
2008-06-01T20:10:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	I store those on my 1TB data drive :D
2008-06-01T20:10:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	And that rank is not worth the trouble
2008-06-01T20:10:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	So I'm just going to throw it away, thanks anyway
2008-06-01T20:11:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	alright, just keeping an eye out, because I've lost important data like that before
2008-06-01T20:12:00.000Z	Armada	Sir_Fawnpug	Me too, that's why I bought that 1TB drive ;)
2008-06-01T20:12:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Armada	I've been in a situation where I've had to manually fetch the data that was accidentally deleted from a coworker's ext3 partition; it's not pretty.
