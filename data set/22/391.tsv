2011-11-07T01:18:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	you can check keyserver.ubuntu.com for those keys and download them and then import them with apt-key
2011-11-07T01:20:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	I tried pasting my key string...or wht I think is my key stirng in..an it says "Erroe handling request:Request hash not found"
2011-11-07T01:21:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	did you start with 0x?
2011-11-07T01:21:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	Error handling request. Exception raised: Failure("char out of range for hex conversion")
2011-11-07T01:24:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	not sure what you are typing in to keyserver it should be 0x40976EAF437D05B5
2011-11-07T01:24:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	I typed in 0x40976EAF437D05B5
2011-11-07T01:25:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x40976EAF437D05B5&op=vindex
2011-11-07T01:26:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	thats what I would do. supposedly apt-key is able to query the keyserver, but i've never gotten it to work
2011-11-07T01:27:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	and no you dont want all the keys on that page, you just want the ubuntu key
2011-11-07T01:27:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	sorry didnt realize that was the question
2011-11-07T01:27:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	ok...mind walking me through the downloading an installing it plz
2011-11-07T01:29:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	so the link at the top and the one that says selfsig will take you to: http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x40976EAF437D05B5 thats the real ascii armored key
2011-11-07T01:30:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	so save the part that starts with ----BEGIN and ---END including the ---BEGIN/END lines to a file and then apt-key add filename
2011-11-07T01:30:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	you are my saviour...!!....ummmm.....hw do I actually install this key?
2011-11-07T01:30:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	oh ok..:) thank you!
2011-11-07T01:30:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	I'm sure there is an easier way (and with anything key related you should be careful that you are getting a valid key and I'm not trying to get you to accept invalid keys)
2011-11-07T01:32:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	I just copy pasted into terminal
2011-11-07T01:33:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	copied and pasted the key?
2011-11-07T01:34:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	well the terminal doesn't know what to do with that ascii armored key. you need to open a text editor and save that key to a file ubuntu_key.pub, and then run apt-key add /path/to/ubuntu_key.pub
2011-11-07T01:41:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	ok..I did that...and the file is on my desktop...and its showing "manage apt's list of trusted keys" then a whole load of commands to do with keys
2011-11-07T01:43:00.000Z	escott	NickValentine	^^
2011-11-07T01:45:00.000Z	NickValentine	escott	after all that all terminal has to say..is ok....lol..thank you so so so much!
