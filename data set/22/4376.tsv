2012-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	haux		I have a couple of ext4 partitions, where if I right click on them in ubuntu, and check the permissions, they only show "root" as the user and no other options. I cannot write to these partitions. Can anyone tell me how to correct this?
2012-02-24T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	add them in /etc/fstab and set better access
2012-02-24T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	chown -R    for recursive
2012-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /mount/point      not the block device
2012-02-24T05:23:00.000Z	haux	ActionParsnip	maybe I'm confused about what you mean by mount point. Is /dev/sdc1 not a mount point?
2012-02-24T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	no /dev/sdc1 is the block device, you mount the block device and you can access the data etc, you manipulate that
2012-02-26T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	edit /etc/samba/smb.conf
2012-02-26T02:25:00.000Z	haux	ActionParsnip	Do I have to have samba installed for this?
2012-02-26T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	its in the default install (no samba)
2012-02-26T02:26:00.000Z	haux	ActionParsnip	ok, the the reason I asked is because I was trying to restart the service without having to restart Ubuntu, but all of the commands I was able to find had to do with samba, which I don't have

2012-04-06T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	add the boot option:   text
2012-04-06T02:22:00.000Z	haux	ActionParsnip	where do I add this? grub?
2012-04-06T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub   change this line:  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"    to      GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash text"     save the new file, close gedit and run:  sudo update-grub
2012-04-07T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	press ALT+F2 and run:  nautilus
2012-04-07T21:05:00.000Z	haux	ActionParsnip	doing that opens up my home directory. I forgot to mention, my home directory came up on startup.
2012-04-09T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	look in /usr/share/xsessions   read the exec line
2012-04-09T00:30:00.000Z	haux	ActionParsnip	xubuntu.desktop shows the exec to be startxfce4. Unfortunately, startxfce4 starts the xfce session.
2012-04-09T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	haux	no options and such?
2012-04-09T00:32:00.000Z	haux	ActionParsnip	I'm not sure what you mean by options. But both xubuntu.desktop and xfce.desktop show exec=startxfce4, which nothing else after it
