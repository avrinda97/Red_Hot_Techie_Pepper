2011-08-23T12:15:00.000Z	kinglet	iceroot_	this is my first question:
2011-08-23T12:15:00.000Z	kinglet	iceroot_	Hello to everyone, I have a problem. I want to install Ubuntu 11.04 (DVD) but when I select Graphical mode installing or Live, after some texts got this error msg "undevd-work [102]: '/sbin/modprobe -bv pci: v000...' unexpected exit with status 0x0009" and in Text mode installing installation CD-Rom couldn't be mounted. What is the problem u think?
2011-08-23T12:16:00.000Z	iceroot_	kinglet	hm seems like the installer cant detect your hardware correctly but i am not sure
2011-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	kinglet	iceroot_	what should I do?
2011-08-23T12:19:00.000Z	kinglet	iceroot_	I'm going to try ActionParsnip suggestion
2011-08-23T12:19:00.000Z	kinglet	iceroot_	ActionParsnip brb guys, tnx
2011-08-23T12:19:00.000Z	iceroot_	kinglet	ok
2011-08-23T12:44:00.000Z	iceroot_	kinglet	i would suggest to try the "alternate-cd" or the betinstall/minimal cd which is pulling a new kernel directly at setup
2011-08-23T12:45:00.000Z	iceroot_	kinglet	ah ActionParsnip already said that
2011-08-23T12:45:00.000Z	kinglet	iceroot_	I cannot access to internet while installing ... ActionParsnip what is the failsafe bios settings
