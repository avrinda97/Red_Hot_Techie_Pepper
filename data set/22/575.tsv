2011-07-20T22:28:00.000Z	seanmc98		i pull up my computer and it shows acer(C:\) data(D:\) both are 69.5gigs does that mean the hard drive is partioned?
2011-07-20T22:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	use disk manager to check
2011-07-20T22:29:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	where do i get that at?
2011-07-20T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	rightclick my computer -> manage
2011-07-20T22:32:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	the D:\ says healthy(primary partion)
2011-07-20T22:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	sure but is it on the same disk?
2011-07-20T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	the guys in ##windows will have a better idea and is where your OS is supported
2011-08-05T22:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	you can boot to livecd and install it. If you are using ubuntu right now then it is installed
2011-08-05T22:34:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	i want to remove grub2 and ubuntu so i can use the recovery partion acer set up on this laptop to resore windows
2011-08-05T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	if you delete the ubuntu partitions it should make the recovery partition work
2011-08-05T22:36:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	so download gparted.iso and burn it to a cd boot from that and remove ubuntu?
2011-08-05T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	why bother, the ubuntu livecd has gparted on it...
2011-08-10T02:34:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	if i have ubuntu 11.04 installed and make a partion to install windows will grub automatically show up?
2011-08-10T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	no you will need to reinstate it as windows willblindly overwrite the MBR
2011-08-10T02:35:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	will that erase ubuntu?
2011-08-10T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	no
2011-08-16T04:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	it does, the installed OS will be the same
2011-08-16T04:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	did you install the guest additions?
2011-08-16T04:25:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	i know that but its not the same graphic/ UI look
2011-08-16T04:26:00.000Z	seanmc98	ActionParsnip	i have no clue if i did all i did was create it using the iso
2011-08-16T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	get updated, see if it helps
2011-08-16T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanmc98	the guest additions are installable in the menus in the virtualbox window: http://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers/2008/virtualbox-install-guest-additions.jpg
