2005-08-04T10:50:00.000Z	tikka		install
2005-08-04T10:50:00.000Z	tikka		do they?
2005-08-04T10:50:00.000Z	tikka		i dunno..
2005-08-04T10:51:00.000Z	tikka		during the gentoo stage 1 install the guide pointed out that nearly all distros out of the box have crap hdd performance configured
2005-08-04T10:51:00.000Z	tikka		i see
2005-08-04T10:51:00.000Z	tikka		hmm
2005-08-04T10:51:00.000Z	tikka		im willing to give it a spipnaroo :)
2005-08-04T10:51:00.000Z	tikka		you dont object me doing it from source do ya?
2005-08-04T10:51:00.000Z	tikka		;/
2005-08-04T10:52:00.000Z	tikka		ok cool
2005-08-04T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	all SATA drives use DMA, so hdparm -d is useless
2005-08-04T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	what does hdparm -I /dev/sda do?
2005-08-04T10:52:00.000Z	tikka	crimsun	is that because its all dynamic as the sata drive handles itself ?
2005-08-04T10:53:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	the controller does, yes
2005-08-04T10:53:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	what does hdparm -I /dev/sda do?
2005-08-04T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	there are really only two flags worth using with an SATA drive, and those are -A and -W
2005-08-04T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	try -W1
2005-08-04T10:56:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	does it help?
2005-08-04T10:56:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	there's also the -A flag for read-ahead
2005-08-04T10:57:00.000Z	tikka	crimsun	brb 2 minutes switching window maker. i cant really call it a fair comparison
2005-08-04T11:05:00.000Z	tikka	crimsun	what do you think ? Timing cached reads:   1092 MB in  2.01 seconds = 544.45 MB/sec  |  iming buffered disk reads:  168 MB in  3.00 seconds =  55.92 MB/sec
2005-08-04T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	tikka	well, my HD is quite slow...
