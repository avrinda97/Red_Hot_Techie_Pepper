2008-10-17T07:36:00.000Z	dasickis		cf = compact flash
2008-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	dasickis		sorry, you answered my question before
2008-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	dasickis		yeah
2008-10-17T07:37:00.000Z	dasickis		it was: how do i make ubuntu see my flash card
2008-10-17T07:38:00.000Z	dasickis		you said it does it by default
2008-10-17T07:38:00.000Z	dasickis		so i was working on that for this long and it doesn't
2008-10-17T07:38:00.000Z	dasickis		cf card = compact flash card
2008-10-17T07:39:00.000Z	dasickis		but it doesn't so what's my next step to figuring out where the problem is
2008-10-17T07:41:00.000Z	jtisme	dasickis	tail /var/log/messages  and see if the OS found anything
2008-10-17T07:42:00.000Z	dasickis	jtisme	it doesn't i tried it in the past
2008-10-17T07:42:00.000Z	dasickis	jtisme	i'm wondering if it's because i was messing with the bios
2008-10-17T07:42:00.000Z	jtisme	dasickis	not sure about that what did you change in bios
2008-10-17T07:43:00.000Z	dasickis	jtisme	actually wait this time it did say it found something with this new CF card
2008-10-17T07:43:00.000Z	dasickis	jtisme	let me verify again
2008-10-17T07:44:00.000Z	jtisme	dasickis	ok good what  /dev/  did it assign
2008-10-17T07:44:00.000Z	dasickis	jtisme	does it say it in the /var/log/messages?
2008-10-17T07:45:00.000Z	jtisme	dasickis	yes it will be in /var/log/messages if it was able to recognize the device
2008-10-17T07:46:00.000Z	dasickis	jtisme	it's not it just says attached scis gneric sgl type 0
2008-10-17T07:46:00.000Z	jtisme	dasickis	hold on a sec
2008-10-17T07:48:00.000Z	jtisme	dasickis	 you should see something like  this '[sdX]' where X is a letter
2008-10-17T07:49:00.000Z	jtisme	dasickis	it should precede the message in /var/log/messages
2008-10-17T07:50:00.000Z	dasickis	jtisme	it doesn't
