2008-09-05T16:17:00.000Z	concave		is there a way to install .debs into my home directory as a non-root user?
2008-09-05T16:18:00.000Z	concave		(although that would negate dependency handling, but oh well)
2008-09-05T16:20:00.000Z	concave		awesome!  thanks ActionParsnip.  i forgot all about ar.
2008-09-05T16:21:00.000Z	concave		what's the general opinion on setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, assuming local paths are set _last_ (and "standard" paths are set first)?
2008-09-05T16:22:00.000Z	concave		(or does LD_LIBRARY_PATH only affect additional places to look for libs?  i.e., standard paths are checked first, and then afterwards, whatever is placed in LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
2008-09-05T16:22:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	standard paths are checked first, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is for additional places
2008-09-05T16:23:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	I take it back, actually LD_LIBRARY_PATH is checked first, I think
2008-09-05T16:25:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	it works that way so you can use non-standard locations for libraries and override specific libraries for specific programs.
2008-09-05T16:26:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	I'm not sure what LD_PRELOAD is to be honest.
2008-09-05T16:27:00.000Z	concave	pajamian	you can override shared libraries by setting it.
2008-09-05T16:28:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	at any rate, I've used LD_LIBRARY_PATH when I needed to compile a program from source and needed newer versions of libs than what comes with ubuntu.
2008-09-05T16:30:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	why not just install all the build dependancies for vim from apt?
2008-09-05T16:30:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	sudo apt-get build-dep vim
2008-09-05T16:31:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	ahhh, I see
2008-09-05T16:32:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	and hence you can't install vim from apt either.
2008-09-05T16:32:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	good luck, sounds like you're being forced to do a lot of work for nothing.
2008-09-05T16:32:00.000Z	concave	pajamian	yeah, i'm going to end up having to contact the sysadmin... *grumble*
2008-09-05T16:35:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	don't be surprised if it doesn't work, but it is a good idea
2008-09-05T16:38:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	lack of dependancies
2008-09-05T16:39:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	if it were me I'd just wait and ask the sysadmin
2008-09-05T16:40:00.000Z	concave	pajamian	there's a chance i picked up the wrong package, too. i extracted the .deb and ended up with data.tar.gz, control.tar.gz, and debian-binary.  in data.tar.gz, i found a basic heirarchy, including usr/bin/vim.basic (although that's too minimal, so yeargh, probably wrong package).  apparently i'm missing libgpm...  sysadmin it is, then!
2008-09-05T16:40:00.000Z	pajamian	concave	if you have another box you may be able to compile it with static linking
