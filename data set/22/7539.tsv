2006-03-08T06:19:00.000Z	Krillancello		Hullo. Does anyone know of any guides or the like for doing a Ubuntu 'server' install ("server" at the CD's boot: prompt) and then adding in X, Gnome, etc.?
2006-03-08T06:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	after the install is done you would need to add the extra stuff  like sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-03-08T06:21:00.000Z	Krillancello	gnomefreak	I don't want to install everything that comes standard with the non-server install.
2006-03-08T06:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	installing it like that is easiest and sure way for X to work
2006-03-08T06:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	thats not one package thats a bunch of them in one command
2006-03-08T06:27:00.000Z	Krillancello	gnomefreak	That's true, but I never said one package. I said one _line_.
2006-03-08T11:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	ubuntu-desktop?
2006-03-08T11:36:00.000Z	Krillancello	gnomefreak	I didn't install that. I did a 'server' install and installed Gnome and X myself.
2006-03-08T11:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	what is it saying it depends on
2006-03-08T11:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	apt-get install whatever will tell you what depends on it and more than likely install them after asking you
2006-03-08T11:39:00.000Z	Krillancello	gnomefreak	I'm trying to remove XChat, and I just didn't realize there was something I'd installed that actually depended on it. Although now I'm seeing (in Synaptic) that xchat-common is installed, and it seems to be the obtrusive package (even though, logically speaking, the dependency should be reversed.)
2006-03-08T11:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	i think its the other way around i think you can install xchat-common without any other xchat packages
2006-03-08T11:44:00.000Z	Krillancello	gnomefreak	LjL: I misread its description. It says it's useless without one of the three xchat packages.
2006-03-08T11:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	correct
2006-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	you cant have xchat-gnome and xchat on the system at same time in breezy
2006-03-08T11:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	sudo apt-get isntall xchat
2006-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	Krillancello	gnomefreak	That wants to remove xchat-gnome as well.
2006-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	yes you can not have xchat-gnome and xchat on same system at same time
2006-03-08T11:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	if it gets borked yes
2006-03-08T11:52:00.000Z	Krillancello	gnomefreak	I mean going from Breezy to Dapper.
2006-03-08T11:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	you can upgrade to it with apt but dapper can and will break on you at a moments notice
2006-03-08T11:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Krillancello	dapper will not be released till april 20th
