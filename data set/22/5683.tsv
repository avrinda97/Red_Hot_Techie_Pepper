2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	davin		Hi. I installed Edgy py pressing F6 'Other Options' because my mouse/keyboard wouldnt work normally. Now I installed it but they dont work because these 'other options' arent added on startup. I cannot see see the boot options fully, help?
2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	lugod	davin	what kind of mouse and keyboard do you have? usb?
2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	davin	lugod	a wireless CANYON Multimedia set.My wired PS/2 Compaq keyboard works, but I tried the Compaq wireless mouse and it also only works with 'Other Options'
2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	davin	lugod	It would work if I knew what the boot options were of the 'F6 Other Options'-thing on the Live CD and added them to GRUB
2007-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	davin	lugod	hard to explain
2007-03-22T07:46:00.000Z	lugod	davin	ok. you should be able to look at the grub menu.lst on the installer CD-ROM and get the options you need from there
2007-03-22T07:46:00.000Z	davin	lugod	when the livecd starts up you can press F1-F6 for several options (language, keyset, resolution etc.) when you press F6 some boot options are added, but I can only see 4 of them because it is too long
2007-03-22T07:46:00.000Z	davin	lugod	brilliant idea
2007-03-22T07:47:00.000Z	davin	lugod	I have to mount the CD though, and im on it...
2007-03-22T07:47:00.000Z	davin	lugod	should I boot into text mode from my hard disk install and gedit the CD?
2007-03-22T07:47:00.000Z	lugod	davin	cool
2007-03-22T07:47:00.000Z	lugod	davin	should just be able to mount it and look inside without any reboot
2007-03-22T07:47:00.000Z	davin	lugod	im not sure if I can mount the CD if I am using it right now
2007-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	lugod	davin	youre booted from livecd right now?
2007-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	davin	lugod	yes
2007-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	davin	lugod	so im not sure if I can mount it
2007-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	lugod	davin	hmm
2007-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	davin	lugod	I can boot into text mode though
2007-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	davin	lugod	from my hard disk
2007-03-22T07:49:00.000Z	lugod	davin	do you have about 700 Mb free on HD that you can use temporarily?
2007-03-22T07:49:00.000Z	lugod	davin	or copy of ISO image of live cd on HD?
2007-03-22T07:51:00.000Z	lugod	davin	ok, booting into text mode from HD sounds easiest.
