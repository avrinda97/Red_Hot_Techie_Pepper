2011-08-16T02:48:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		still concerning my ftp server that i am halfway getting to work
2011-08-16T02:48:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	that is correct, unless users need to execute something
2011-08-16T02:49:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	so i shouldnt have a problem at all with downloading
2011-08-16T02:49:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	im pretty sure its the permissions man...
2011-08-16T02:50:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	I'm not sure why you don't have rwx on the group
2011-08-16T02:50:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	so what exactly is the problem anyway?
2011-08-16T02:51:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	well at first it wouldnt allow me to login because of file permissions set to the home dir. after i formatted a partition on the drive, it now allows me to login. but now i cant download files
2011-08-16T02:52:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	on your local computer you mean?
2011-08-16T02:53:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	urgh, is the drive formatted with ntfs?
2011-08-16T02:55:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	what's happening now?
2011-08-16T02:55:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	i went ahead and set all files with 777 permissions. this will determine if the issue rly is permission related
2011-08-16T02:56:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	hmm, it shouldn't
2011-08-16T02:56:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	have you tried using the command line ftp to make sure filezilla isn't messing up? it's a long shot, but...
2011-08-16T02:57:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	ill try that now actually
2011-08-16T02:57:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	oh, I think I figured it out
2011-08-16T02:59:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	that's what I'm thinking
2011-08-16T03:01:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	yep. you absolutely right dude :/ epic fail on my part
2011-08-16T03:01:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	so just to double check now. for files that i do NOT want anyone to modify. permissions should be 755. right?
2011-08-16T03:02:00.000Z	scorchgeek	[THC]AcidRain	yep
2011-08-16T03:02:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	lol. thats rly funny dude. i just did something like that the other day. i think it was with postfix. spent a good hr wondering why i couldnt connect then realized that i never even installed >_>
2011-08-16T03:04:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	scorchgeek	didnt even last that long man. i couldnt find the "file" menu option on a window. so i rage quit and came back like 30min later and switched to classic
