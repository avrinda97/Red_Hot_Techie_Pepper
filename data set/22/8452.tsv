2005-11-28T10:10:00.000Z	ubuntu43e		I guess im just stuck.. i cant get it to install java
2005-11-28T10:11:00.000Z	ubuntu43e		it says it cant find the file and its the only file in the current directory
2005-11-28T10:12:00.000Z	ubuntu43e		I know it i can see how windows has such a massive user base
2005-11-28T10:13:00.000Z	ubuntu43e		i cant even get stupid java support to work
2005-11-28T10:14:00.000Z	ubuntu43e		it makes no sense to go thru 30 mins of garbage just to get a java plug in
2005-11-28T10:14:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	we have told you a few solutiosn now
2005-11-28T10:16:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	check your PM; ubotu has told you a few ways
2005-11-28T10:53:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	don't paste the whole tutorial here please...we know where it is
2005-11-28T10:55:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	again, dont' paste those things in here
2005-11-28T10:57:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	you made the symlink, right?
2005-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	ls -l /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/libjava*
2005-11-28T11:00:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	hrm...killall -9 firefox-bin   to make sure all firefox is done (make sure you're not doing naythign important before running :) )
2005-11-28T11:02:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	in about:plugins do you see java listed?
2005-11-28T11:03:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	sorry, i'm out of ideas otherwise; the symlink was ran correctly, so firefox SHOULD be picking it up
2005-11-28T11:03:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	try another java game...
2005-11-28T11:16:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	fun eh :)
2005-11-28T11:18:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	just wait...you're still new; this stuff comes second nature after awhile
2005-11-28T11:19:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	it's not hard, it's new...just give it a little time
2005-11-28T11:25:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	java --version works right?
2005-11-28T11:51:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	!!!!!!1
2005-11-28T11:51:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	which command?
2005-11-28T12:01:00.000Z	thrice`	ubuntu43e	remove your ~/.firefox or ~/.mozilla* dir
