2010-03-23T18:19:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	cups is not running at all
2010-03-23T18:20:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	and i can not start it because there is no file names cups in /etc/init.d/
2010-03-23T18:20:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	or is there a different way to start it
2010-03-23T18:21:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	i cant even get so far as to configure a new printer in the first place because the printer icon is greyed out, and i get a message that cups is not running
2010-03-23T18:22:00.000Z	noren	lanoxx	oh ok ! try sudo apt-get remove --purge cups && sudo apt-get install cups
2010-03-23T18:23:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	can that be right?
2010-03-23T18:26:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	that worked, although i was quite suprised why it told me that ubuntu-desktop would be removed, it didnt remove it, and now it works after reinstalling it
2010-03-23T18:26:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	thanks alot
2010-03-23T18:26:00.000Z	noren	lanoxx	ur welcome i think there was something wrong with the cups configuration
2010-03-23T18:27:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	probably, but i wonder why simply reinstalling didnt work
2010-03-23T18:28:00.000Z	noren	lanoxx	simple reinstall does not remove the old config file thats why we used purge it remove completly
2010-03-23T18:29:00.000Z	lanoxx	noren	alright, i will remember this
