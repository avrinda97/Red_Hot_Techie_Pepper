2012-09-17T02:09:00.000Z	|Anthony|		what version of Xorg is in use for 12.04
2012-09-17T02:10:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	  2:1.11.4-0ubuntu10.8
2012-09-17T02:11:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	the version number assigned by Xorg, not the ubuntu version number
2012-09-17T02:12:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	It's in the package version: 1.11.4
2012-09-26T19:33:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	Have you see this? http://disjunkt.com/jd/2010/en/multiseat-linux/multiseat-linux-system-wide-pulseaudio-for-routing-sounds-109/
2012-09-26T19:34:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	yeah i've seen that. it's actually up in one of my ff tabs
2012-09-26T19:35:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	his solution for $PULSE_SINK per user... i haven't tried it cause it sounds fishy... $PULSE_SINK is a global variable. lol
2012-10-02T07:17:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	That looks promising, thank-you. I'll try it out on one of my servers tomorrow
2012-10-02T07:18:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	you have hardware sufficient for multiseat?
2012-10-02T07:19:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	too much of it!
2012-10-02T07:21:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	It'd be good to have a PPA to wrap up Brian Cameron's work, and add in some installation scripts to automate the configuration as much as possible
2012-10-02T07:22:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	i was thinking about starting a ppa for that... or pestering the person (a7) who has an existing, but outdated ppa to do it
2012-10-02T07:23:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	I wonder, is there a "multiseat" project on launchpad?
2012-10-02T07:24:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	Ahhh, there is, not touched since 2006
2012-10-02T07:26:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	It would be worth taking over that multiseat project
2012-10-02T07:26:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	the problem on my end atm is that i don't have additional hardware to test it on :/
2012-10-02T07:27:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	one step at a time. I'm sure if done right, it would attract the more professional users
2012-10-02T07:28:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	the hw i'm using for the multiseat is kinda all i have and i've been working on getting it all up and running for a few weeks now while documenting my efforts along the way.
2012-10-02T07:30:00.000Z	|Anthony|	TJ-	i do agree though, that to have it be point-n-clicky would make it more attractive. especially considering fedora has it that way now. the downside to their approach (systemd-logind) is that there is no support for the nvidia binary. which kinda cuts out a large market who have nvidia and want opengl and hw acceleration.
2012-10-02T07:31:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	yes, covering the common hardware and drivers is important. It's worth contacting the registry to see if we can take over the multiseat project
2012-10-02T07:44:00.000Z	TJ-	|Anthony|	do you have a launchpad ID? I was thinking of emailing the registry team to ask them to give us control of multiseat
