2007-10-22T02:12:00.000Z	LifeNomad		Can anyone help me with a problem with Beryl?
2007-10-22T02:14:00.000Z	LifeNomad		Ok, well I have beryl and emerald installed and working, except for MAXIMIZED windows....the window borders disappear when maximized.  The only way I could figure out to make this "sort-of" work was by editing the radius left and right parameters in emerald to 0. Any thoughts?
2007-10-22T02:16:00.000Z	LifeNomad		Windows losing borders when maximized in Beryl.... any thoughts?
2007-10-22T02:16:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	try "upgrading" to compiz-fusion
2007-10-22T03:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	use compiz-fusion, beryl is deprecated
2007-10-22T03:50:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	I know this, but compiz-fusion runs so choppy and slow
2007-10-22T03:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	so then make it fun smooth and fast?
2007-10-22T03:51:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	I tried to, but it was not working correctly.  And I could not find the compizconfig-manager app in the repo
2007-10-22T03:52:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	so then address the issue of what's causing you to be unable to find the compizconfig-settings-manager and work from there.  Make sure you have 3d acceleration enabled, etc
2007-10-22T03:53:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	I just cannot DL that application to make changes to the manager.
2007-10-22T03:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	why can't you download it?
2007-10-22T03:53:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	The only option I have are to enable 3d windows, and wobbly
2007-10-22T03:53:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	It is not in the repositories
2007-10-22T03:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	so enable the proper repositories so it IS there
2007-10-22T03:54:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	I enabled all of the repos...and its still not there
2007-10-22T03:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	then your repository list is broken
2007-10-22T03:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	http://rattlesnake.ath.cx/compizconfig.png
2007-10-22T03:55:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	Lol I know it should be there....but It is not.  I have checked all repos in the list, and reloaded synaptic.....still not there.  Is there a private repo I need to add?
2007-10-22T03:56:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	no
2007-10-22T03:57:00.000Z	LifeNomad	Fryguy--	Nope not there......wtf
2007-10-23T05:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	I am
2007-10-23T05:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	LifeNomad	not really, pidgin isn't meant to be an irc client, use a better program. I recommend irssi
