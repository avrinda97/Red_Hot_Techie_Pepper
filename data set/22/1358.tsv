2011-05-12T09:48:00.000Z	soadkombucha	jamiewan	lemme go make sure it's still showing up in sound...
2011-05-12T09:49:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	a long shot is a "small chance" of something working
2011-05-12T09:49:00.000Z	soadkombucha	jamiewan	under sound, it shows up as  internal audio 1 output/1 input analog stereo duplex
2011-05-12T09:50:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	i dont recall your problem can u repeat

2011-05-12T09:54:00.000Z	soadkombucha	jamiewan	any ideas?
2011-05-12T09:56:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	checked alsa mixer settings?
2011-05-12T09:56:00.000Z	soadkombucha	jamiewan	it's pulse
2011-05-12T09:56:00.000Z	soadkombucha	jamiewan	I checked the sound settings yes.
2011-05-12T09:56:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	are you using skype
2011-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	tried a mic on its own?
2011-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	soadkombucha	jamiewan	the mic that I have that plugs into my mic jack won't work either

2011-05-12T10:00:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	try record something in sound recorder
2011-05-12T10:02:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	 ok, sound prefs, hardware tab, profile set to analog stereo duplex?
2011-05-12T10:04:00.000Z	jamiewan	soadkombucha	also just double check the check boxes in mixer again, they are sometimes confusing as to if they are muted or not
