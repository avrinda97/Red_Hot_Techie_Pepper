2009-02-01T19:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	We will try to be gentle with you
2009-02-01T19:02:00.000Z	G__81	Jack_Sparrow	i ve installed build-essentials
2009-02-01T19:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	Just checking
2009-02-01T19:02:00.000Z	G__81	Jack_Sparrow	I installed 8.10 and very impressed with it
2009-02-01T19:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	I think if you have the src enabled in the sources.list it will pull in the source for all packages you install
2009-02-01T19:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	If you dont want source, rem out the repos
2009-02-01T19:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	We dont discriminate..
2009-02-01T19:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	with our base server and base desktop installs a dev can shape them into whatever they need
2009-02-01T19:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	It isnt like they ever leave anything the way they get it
2009-02-01T19:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	we have the #Uubntu-offtopic and -chat channels for discussions.  THis place will get busy soon and we then clamp down on the borderline conversations..
2009-02-01T19:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	xubuntu is even lighter
2009-02-01T19:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	G__81	I never pulled apart an rpm so I cant see why they would be bigger for the same pavkage
