2010-06-26T05:52:00.000Z	Hobz		Can anybody recommend a good bitorrent client for ubuntu?
2010-06-26T05:54:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	apt-get purge it.
2010-06-26T05:55:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	I'ma try a .deb of 1.1.6 first
2010-06-26T05:55:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	purge first.
2010-06-26T05:56:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	Use dpkg, not apt-get.
2010-06-26T05:56:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	There's a PPA for deluge.  Tried installing that way?
2010-06-26T05:57:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	not yet, I dropped off the face of the earth for about 18 months
2010-06-26T05:57:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	??
2010-06-26T05:58:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	I haven't kept current
2010-06-26T05:58:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	Then check this out -- it's painfully simple nowadays.
2010-06-26T06:06:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	I'm not getting the syntax right in synaptic, it doesn't like ppa:deluge-team/ppa
2010-06-26T06:07:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	It's "ppa:" && "deluge-team/ppa"
2010-06-26T06:08:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	Try this, instead: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/deluge-team/ppa/ubuntu lucid main
2010-06-26T06:09:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	that did it, lets see how she flies
2010-06-26T06:09:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	You'll need to CNP this into a file: http://pastebin.com/krmb84Cu
2010-06-26T06:15:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	execute:  " sudo su -c 'apt-get update && apt-get install deluge*' "
2010-06-26T06:15:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	when I apt-get update I get lots of failed downloads
2010-06-26T06:16:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	That's not bad, actually.  It's language support files.
2010-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	monoxide, apt-get is finding deluge now, but I'm getting a conflict and some python 'is not installable' errors
2010-06-26T07:28:00.000Z	IConrad01	Hobz	Hrm... uninstall the old deluge completely?
2010-06-26T07:29:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	that'd be a purge?
2010-06-26T07:32:00.000Z	Hobz	IConrad01	the conflict is gone, but it still won't install python2.6-cairo and python2.6-gobject
