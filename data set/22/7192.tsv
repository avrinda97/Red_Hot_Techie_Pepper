2006-05-21T16:41:00.000Z	digisus		... upgrade through synaptic/apt-get as well?
2006-05-21T16:41:00.000Z	digisus		upgrade-d! (damn)
2006-05-21T16:42:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	if you installed software from unofficial repositories, you might get problems, though.
2006-05-21T16:43:00.000Z	digisus	Sanne	ah ah... Hm, to be honest it is difficult to keep track of every small app one installs... Do you have an idea of how I could extract a list of the stuff I installed manually on breezy?
2006-05-21T16:45:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	not really. I'm using Synaptic because it logs every install, and if I compile stuff myself, I always put it into /usr/local. Other than that, I would keep notes.
2006-05-21T16:46:00.000Z	digisus	Sanne	Keeping notes? You mean like.. pen and paper? LOL thought a computer is keeping notes for me! LOL
2006-05-21T16:48:00.000Z	digisus	Sanne	Thanks for the hint in any case.
2006-05-21T16:48:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	heh :) Actually, I do that pen and paper stuff sometimes. If you install manually, how should your system know? Did you install much software from unofficial sources or compiled it yourself?
2006-05-21T16:50:00.000Z	digisus	Sanne	Aaahhh... We might have a misunderstanding. I installed practically ALL throught synaptic. I thought with unofficial you meant one of the unsupported repositories. But perhaps I am wrong? (Oh, and I did not compile anything by myself. ubuntu is such a userfriendly piece, why should I? :-)
2006-05-21T16:52:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	no, I meant unofficial repositories as well as compiling yourself, although if you did everything through synaptic, that makes it easier, because you have logs. But anyway, unofficial repositories might get you problems when upgrading. Just keep that in mind. Maybe you need to uninstall some programs before you can proceed.
2006-05-21T16:54:00.000Z	digisus	Sanne	I see. I am wondering what takes more time: make a backup of everything, wipe the HD and install Dapper from scratch and then muddle through the configuration again. Or... start muddling through right away. ;-)
2006-05-21T16:55:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	if you're prepared to start from scratch anyway, why not try upgrading first and see how far it goes? But I would backup important stuff in any case, at least you config files in your home dir and perhaps /etc also.
2006-05-21T16:56:00.000Z	digisus	Sanne	Wonderful idea, I muddle through forth and back to double the transition time ;-) Sorry for being sarcastic... *smile on the face*
2006-05-21T16:57:00.000Z	digisus	Sanne	probbaly you are right. This way, I would have tried and experienced once how the upgrade process works.
2006-05-21T16:57:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	I'm sorry to not have the ultimate answer ;), but mixing repositories should be done with care. If you didn't know that, you do now ;).
2006-05-21T16:58:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	exactly
2006-05-21T16:58:00.000Z	digisus		sanne, i heard about the dark places of repositories but Dapper was far you know... ;-)
2006-05-21T16:58:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	hehe :)
2006-05-21T05:00:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	I'm not sure, but there may be some apt or dpkg wizardry to show which package came from which repository. But somebody more advanced in this magic would have to answer that ;)
2006-05-21T05:01:00.000Z	digisus		sanne, thanks. Gotta leave. was nice chatting, and many thanks for your tips. -- To all other listeners coding on ubunut: You guys rock! Thanks for providing such an excellent piece of free software! bye bye
2006-05-21T05:01:00.000Z	digisus		tu!
2006-05-21T05:01:00.000Z	Sanne	digisus	you're welcome, good luck
