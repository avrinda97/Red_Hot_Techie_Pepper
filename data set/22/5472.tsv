2007-04-26T14:01:00.000Z	nu-		Anyone here use nano?
2007-04-26T14:01:00.000Z	nu-		i can't get syntax hiliting to work
2007-04-26T14:03:00.000Z	nu-		guh
2007-04-26T14:03:00.000Z	nu-		when you move a window, does it wobble?
2007-04-26T14:04:00.000Z	bjc	nu-	What have you tried? http://wiki.linuxhelp.net/index.php/Nano_Syntax_Highlighting suggests you simply copy the default config file over, and uncomment some directives.
2007-04-26T14:06:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	i've tried everything...  source=python... -Y
2007-04-26T14:12:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	yes, /.nanorc already has those..but it doesn't work for me
2007-04-26T14:12:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	 you didnt pass any paremeters?
2007-04-26T14:15:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	xfce4-terminal..but i am on gnome
2007-04-26T14:16:00.000Z	bjc	nu-	Do you get colour on any terminal commands? IOW,does `ls --color` do syntax highlighting for you?
2007-04-26T14:17:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	yes. when i type 'ls' dirs are listed in blue
2007-04-26T14:17:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	i think i found the problem
2007-04-26T14:21:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	i lied. i didnt. i have a folder in /etc/share named 'nano', inside is python.nanosrc, sh.nanosrc, etc
2007-04-26T14:21:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	so i made a .nano folder in my ~ and copied those files there, but didnt work
2007-04-26T14:52:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	you there?
2007-04-26T14:54:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	no. i just want to clarify things :) in your home folder, you have .nanorc and inside, theres this: http://paste2.org/p/2779 right?
2007-04-26T14:57:00.000Z	bjc	nu-	"icolor" at the start of line 4 should be "color", but apart from that, yes.
2007-04-26T14:58:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	and you just start a file like "nano whatever.py" ?
2007-04-26T15:01:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	i give up. just doesn't work
2007-04-26T15:02:00.000Z	bjc	nu-	I'm sorry about that. :-( Why not try another editor?
2007-04-26T15:02:00.000Z	nu-	bjc	im already acustumed to nano's shortcuts. its ok though. i can deal with all white text. thanks for the help =] 
2007-04-26T15:03:00.000Z	bjc	nu-	If you type some garbage in the last line of ~/.nanorc do you get an error message when you start up nano?
