2009-05-30T13:48:00.000Z	packetcase		I have a serious error with add/remove. The applicaiton does not prompt for super user password on start up, and can't read the settings
2009-05-30T13:49:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	do other software installation methods work?
2009-05-30T13:49:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	I will test, but it seems like add/remove can't read the settings
2009-05-30T13:49:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	also, do you have root account enabled, and if so, why?
2009-05-30T13:52:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	I do not have root account enabled, but normally I need to type in admin password to start add/remove
2009-05-30T13:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	ok, your own?
2009-05-30T13:52:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	yes
2009-05-30T13:53:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	But add/remove have stopped prompting me
2009-05-30T13:54:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	It seems that I have a "broken" package. sun-java6-plugin
2009-05-30T13:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	did you get instructions on how to fix it?
2009-05-30T13:56:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	I reinstalled sun-java6-plugin and add/remove works. Should I post a bug or something?
2009-05-30T13:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	search launchpad first for bug reports
2009-05-30T13:57:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	ok
2009-05-30T13:57:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	What should i search for?
2009-05-30T13:59:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	sun-java6-plugin :-)
2009-05-30T14:02:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	Where can I find the log for add/remove, if there is any
2009-05-30T14:07:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	The bug might be because something went wrong under the installation of sun-java6-plugin. When I tried again it installed successful. This might be caused by the userunfriendliness of add/remove.
2009-05-30T14:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	if you think it's a bug, then by all means, file it
2009-05-30T14:09:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	Not a bug, but add/remove should be changed so it don't stop working when a package is broken
2009-05-30T14:15:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	if it doesn't work as you expected it to work, then it's a bug ;-)
2009-05-30T14:19:00.000Z	packetcase	Myrtti	How do I post that kind of bugs?:-)
2009-05-30T14:22:00.000Z	Myrtti	packetcase	as you would any other
