2011-08-10T01:36:00.000Z	jimubao		yeah coz i have lots file opend up
2011-08-10T01:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	"ps aux | grep skype" does it list anything?  If so kill the process or process name.
2011-08-10T01:37:00.000Z	jimubao	zykotick9	how do i kill the process ?
2011-08-10T01:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	"kill PID#" or "killall PROCESS_NAME"
2011-08-10T01:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	run either of the above command, then verify with the "ps aux.." again to verify it's killed
2011-08-10T01:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	are you sure skype is the process name?
2011-08-10T01:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	if you tried kill and it failed it's time for -9.  "killall -9 skype"
2011-08-10T01:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	no that's the search ;)
2011-08-10T01:41:00.000Z	jimubao	zykotick9	so it should work now
2011-08-10T01:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	yup
2011-08-10T01:42:00.000Z	jimubao	zykotick9	nice dude thanks ~ what does killall -9 do ?
2011-08-10T01:42:00.000Z	jimubao	zykotick9	yeap is working now thanks ^^
2011-08-10T01:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	ONLY use that in emergencies - it kills without asking permission
2011-08-10T01:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	a regular kill or killall is basically asking a process to stop, the -9 just stops it.
2011-08-10T01:48:00.000Z	jimubao	zykotick9	thanks !!
2011-08-10T01:48:00.000Z	jimubao	zykotick9	works like a charm
2011-08-10T01:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	jimubao	glad to help
