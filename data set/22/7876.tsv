2005-12-06T09:38:00.000Z	existance		is the filesystem option for mount -t NTFS?
2005-12-06T09:40:00.000Z	existance		Fujistu: woo, yea :)
2005-12-06T09:40:00.000Z	existance		Are there any cool audio programs someone would recommend?
2005-12-06T09:41:00.000Z	_jason	existance	Beep Media Player
2005-12-06T16:22:00.000Z	_jason	existance	put a backslash before the space
2006-01-23T07:34:00.000Z	_jason	existance	should do that by default
2006-01-23T07:34:00.000Z	existance	_jason	and if it doesnt?
2006-01-23T07:35:00.000Z	_jason	existance	check your aliases
2006-01-23T07:35:00.000Z	_jason	existance	my fault, it does rows... columns is -C
2006-01-23T07:36:00.000Z	existance	_jason	cool thanks :)
2006-01-23T07:37:00.000Z	_jason	existance	actually the -C for me seems to do the same thing... maybe I've got an alias somewhere...
2006-01-23T07:39:00.000Z	existance	_jason	wierd, worked for me though
2006-01-23T07:39:00.000Z	_jason	existance	yeah, it should work.  It's just that mine without the -C does the same thing :)
2006-01-23T07:41:00.000Z	existance	_jason	mine used to, not sure what changed though :/
2006-02-18T12:17:00.000Z	_jason	existance	you need to setup apt to use the proxy
2006-02-18T12:18:00.000Z	existance	_jason	by using export http_proxy=proxyaddhere, or something else?
2006-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	_jason	existance	don't know about that way, only read about a proxy config file somewhere
2006-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	existance	_jason	er.. where?
2006-02-18T12:20:00.000Z	existance	_jason	the file, not where you read about it :-)

2006-02-18T12:20:00.000Z	_jason	existance	I don;t remember either, I just regoogled :)
2006-02-18T12:23:00.000Z	_jason	existance	you probably need to reboot for the settings to take place
