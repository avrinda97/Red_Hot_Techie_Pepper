2009-07-22T16:55:00.000Z	iFuzo		Than you can run windows applications
2009-07-22T16:56:00.000Z	iFuzo		No. Just go to terminal and type in "apt-get install wine"
2009-07-22T16:56:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	I do have Wine, but its giving me installer hangups.
2009-07-22T16:59:00.000Z	iFuzo	Ravahan	Wat are you trying to do?
2009-07-22T17:00:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	I'm trying to install a few windows apps.  Specificly, I've tried installing Ultima Online and FFXI, and some things google said I should install to get Wine to work with those
2009-07-22T17:00:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	and honestly I'm not sure what all I've tried, but anything that loads the installer shield won't work
2009-07-22T17:00:00.000Z	iFuzo	Ravahan	Which is correct.
2009-07-22T17:00:00.000Z	iFuzo	Ravahan	And you get what error?
2009-07-22T17:01:00.000Z	iFuzo	Ravahan	If its to do with runtime errors your going to need winetricks
2009-07-22T17:01:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	Well, the current thing I have up is ffxi so here's the hangup error I got from that...
2009-07-22T17:01:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	 err:ntdll:RtlpWaitForCriticalSection section 0x110048 "heap.c: main process heap section" wait timed out in thread 001b, blocked by 0009, retrying (60 sec)
2009-07-22T17:02:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	I do have winetricks, but the Runtime 2k installation won't finish because it hangs up in stupid installer shield
2009-07-22T17:02:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	Nothing at all that uses installer shield will install
2009-07-22T17:03:00.000Z	iFuzo	Ravahan	If its to do with runtime and the installer shield cant detect/install try inserting them yourself?
2009-07-22T17:04:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	What can I specificly do to get installer shield functioning?
2009-07-22T17:04:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	Is there something I should've installed via WineTricks to whip that into shape?

2009-07-22T17:05:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	Yes, I have that up.  Installer shield isn't working, so I get a hangup
2009-07-22T17:05:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	and the error I previously posted
2009-07-22T17:06:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	In short, my problem is with Wine running installer shield
2009-07-22T17:06:00.000Z	iFuzo	Ravahan	Tbh, I have no clue. Sorry mate
2009-07-22T17:06:00.000Z	Ravahan	iFuzo	That's fine, I appreciate the attempt
