2007-03-30T06:47:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	if this is a password protected, or a multiple volume rar file, then you will need the unrar non-free package.
2007-03-30T06:48:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	the free unrar will not be able to unpack a multiple volume rar archive.
2007-03-30T06:52:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	LjL I think "they" renamed it to "unrar" without the non-free part.
2007-03-30T06:53:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	"sudo apt-get install unrar"
2007-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	if you are on edgy: start synaptic package manager. click "settings" -> "repositories". check universe and multiverse. click close. click reload.
2007-03-30T07:09:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	try "whereis unrar"
2007-03-30T07:10:00.000Z	ferronica	Jowi	unrar: /usr/share/man/man1/unrar.1.gz
2007-03-30T07:11:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	so you have installed it but manually deleted it maybe... you should have gotten unrar: /usr/bin/unrar /usr/X11R6/bin/unrar /usr/bin/X11/unrar /usr/share/man/man1/unrar.1.gz
2007-03-30T07:29:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	run "gconf-editor" and go to /apps/gnome-btdownload/settings. there you can set the min and max port.
2007-03-30T07:29:00.000Z	ferronica	Jowi	ok
2007-04-06T13:28:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	if you're using gnome then a right click on the iso file should give you an option to burn it if i'm not mistaken...
2007-04-06T13:30:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	should be it, yes. (i'm not using gnome atm)
2007-04-06T13:31:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	and in that window you should have a "write to disc" button...
2007-04-06T13:32:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	does the cd/dvd creator show you just the iso file or the contents of the iso?
2007-04-06T13:33:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	graveman is quite simple and nice otherwise.
2007-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	ferronica	Jowi	whi is graveman???
2007-04-06T13:34:00.000Z	ferronica	Jowi	?????
2007-04-06T13:35:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	if the "cd/dvd creator" does not work for you graveman is a cd/dvd burner that is simple and easy to use. http://graveman.tuxfamily.org/screenshot.php?l=e
2007-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	ferronica	Jowi	will it burn .iso , i am trying to burn ubuntu 6.10 which i downloded
2007-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	Jowi	ferronica	yes. in graveman you just click on "duplicate disc", select the iso in "duplicate from" and the burner in "write to" then click on "write tracks"
2007-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	ferronica	Jowi	okay thanx :)
2007-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	ferronica	Jowi	firstly i will try K3B :)
