2009-11-12T09:57:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	what do you want to change?
2009-11-12T09:57:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	the placement of them, how long they stay up, whether clicking on them makes them disappear and the next one pop up etc.
2009-11-12T09:59:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	well i know you can change the position of them, there may be other settings somewhere else. to change the position and them you can run the command libnotify-config i believe its called, you can type libnotify <tab><tab>  if that doesnt work
2009-11-12T10:02:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	there is no libnotify-config or similar, i can't find it with apt-cache search, do you know which package provides it? notification-properties exists, but the options is gives don't actually do anything
2009-11-12T10:03:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	it should be on your machine already
2009-11-12T10:03:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	i can assure you it is not
2009-11-12T10:04:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	what happens when you type libnotif  and hit tab twice
2009-11-12T10:04:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	nothing
2009-11-12T10:04:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	if you have it on your machine, can you run dpkg -S `which libnotify-bin` and tell me what it gives you?
2009-11-12T10:05:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	its not on the machine im currently on, try installing libnotify-bin
2009-11-12T10:05:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	already installed
2009-11-12T10:06:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	karmic?
2009-11-12T10:06:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	the only thing libnotify-bin provides in /usr/bin is notify-send
2009-11-12T10:06:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	yes
2009-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	try typing notif and tib tab twice
2009-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	hit tab*
2009-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	that gives me notification-properties (which i've already said doesn't do anything) and notify-send
2009-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	it sets the position of them for me, and it works
2009-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	notification-properties doesn't actually change them, there is already a bug regarding this, apparently it is deprecated
2009-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	idk works for me, sorry
2009-11-12T10:11:00.000Z	Agrajag-	Billiard	i think you are mistaken, i have 3 9.10 boxes, on all of them it does nothing, and there is a bug on launchpad where everyone also says it does nothing
2009-11-12T10:12:00.000Z	Billiard	Agrajag-	idk i installed from the alternate cd, pretty much all i installed is gnome and firefox, and my notifications show in the bottom right
