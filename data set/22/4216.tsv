2008-02-21T09:36:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	cedriczg	you'll have to contact your host. its different depending on what you have and how its set up. most places use just ip:port and maybe they have a domain.com/cpanel forward to that. you know you have to use https:// right?
2008-02-21T09:37:00.000Z	cedriczg	AtomicSpark	It seems it was /admin . I was lucky. Thanks to you I remembered (I supposed webim had the word admin in it :P )
2008-02-21T09:37:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	cedriczg	yeah they just have a redirect set up for you. neato.
2008-02-21T09:38:00.000Z	cedriczg	AtomicSpark	thanks a lot
