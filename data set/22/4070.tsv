2008-04-26T13:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		64bit is so so much better faster, etc forget the fact its a pain in the ass to get anything to work! it rocks!
2008-04-26T13:44:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	I haven't noticed any real increases in speed since I switched to 64-bit
2008-04-26T13:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	that comment was in jest, and i completely disagree that its the way to go
2008-04-26T13:44:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	of course it's what everyone should be using when everyone has a 64-bit processor
2008-04-26T13:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	i disagree.. i've got 2 64bit PC's, use 32bit on both.
2008-04-26T13:46:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	think about it, if everyone who could would use 64-bit OSs, then we'd have great drivers in a matter of weeks
2008-04-26T13:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	but thats just not the reality of it, and i hate dealing w/ the constant issues of dealing w/ 64bit... whne its actually ready i'll use it.
2008-04-26T13:47:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	it also depends on what you do on your computer, for me 64-bit works great except flash barely works
2008-04-26T13:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	true...
2008-04-26T13:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	i don't think he even knows.
2008-06-24T20:07:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	yeah basically
2008-06-24T20:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	well that should be an entertaining endeavor, you can try a network install, but at bare minimum, you're gonna need to download some files.
2008-06-24T20:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	can the machine boot a usb device
2008-06-24T20:08:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	yes it can
2008-06-24T20:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	then i would probably get a cheap USB drive and put the image on there adn install from there.
2008-06-24T20:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	well, you can't expect an image to just appear on the drive.. you have to have a way to put it there.
2008-06-24T20:08:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	I already said I have a stick (1GB one) but it's at a friends place, I'm just trying to find a way to do this without having to leave my home:)
2008-06-24T20:09:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	so what does a network boot do then?
2008-06-24T20:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	well, you can give that oe up, you have to boot the image or get something on the hard drive to boot, before you can install.. common sense
2008-06-24T20:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	negge	its still gonna require a cd to my knowledge
2008-06-24T20:11:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	why can't it get it over the network=
2008-06-24T20:11:00.000Z	negge	IndyGunFreak	:D
