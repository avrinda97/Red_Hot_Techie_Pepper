2004-11-14T12:08:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	I got this error hard link not allowed for directory
2004-11-14T12:09:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	you probably have to mount the partition with permissions for your user
2004-11-14T12:10:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	Can i do it from command line ( only root can mount )
2004-11-14T12:11:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	Add to your /etc/fstab so it automounts with user permissions.  Is this a vfat partition?
2004-11-14T12:12:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	Yes its a fat32 part, but i want to test before i add to fstab
2004-11-14T12:13:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	fstab needs a reboot right !
2004-11-14T12:15:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	no reboot necessary, after you edit fstab, type mount -a and it will go through the routine.
2004-11-14T12:21:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	I added mount to fstab with auto auto,users,exec 0 0 but still got the hard link not allowed for directory
2004-11-14T12:22:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	I still dont have user access to the mounted partition
2004-11-14T12:23:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	Did you try mount -a after you edited fstab?
2004-11-14T12:23:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	yes
2004-11-14T12:24:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	It did mount i can see the files but no access as user
2004-11-14T12:25:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	In my fstab, I just use umask=0, and it works
2004-11-14T12:26:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	ok i will try that
2004-11-14T12:27:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	where does it fit any where in the line
2004-11-14T12:29:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	I now have access to the mounted folder as user but still got the hard link not allowed for directory
2004-11-14T12:29:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	For example, my window partition is mounted: /dev/hde1  /mnt/windows/  vfat umask=0,iocharset=iso8859-1,codepage=850 0 0
2004-11-14T12:32:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	Thanks a lot Its ok now i changed the option from -S to -s
2004-11-14T12:32:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	Great
2004-11-14T12:32:00.000Z	MeAndU	darkpines	Many Thanks
2004-11-14T12:33:00.000Z	darkpines	MeAndU	No problem, have fun
