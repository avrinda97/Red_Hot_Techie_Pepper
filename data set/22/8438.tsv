2005-08-12T06:05:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	sata and ide hard disks are currently less than $1/gb. add an external usb enclosure for $40. you've got yourself a backup.
2005-08-12T06:08:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	you do realize of course, that hard disks fail constantly, and not having a backup of this data if its so valuable is really, really.. unprepared.
2005-08-12T06:35:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	your in a chat room full of programmers who respect copyright laws. talking about IP theft in the channel is likely to make people not like you, even if they do think what the riaa/mpaa is doing these days is stupid. :D *ahem*
2005-08-12T06:38:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	actually software is a lot cheaper now.
2005-08-12T06:40:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	congratulations, your software prices match US software prices.
2005-08-12T06:41:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	that has _nothing_ to do with software costs, btw. it has a lot more to do with exchange rates. the average game is in the $45-50 USD range.
2005-08-12T06:41:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	for consoles, that can quickly be $55-60.
2005-08-12T06:42:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	well, the thing is, games are a special exception where art has to be thrown in. new games take a lot more creative talent to produce than, say, pong.
2005-08-12T06:42:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	compare billing systems, for example. MASS 90, an old unix billing system a lot of small companies used, cost thousands of dollars. now you can go buy software like QuickBooks which has most of the same features for $400.
2005-08-12T06:44:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	you are not complaining about the price of software, still. you are complaining about politics and exchange rates.
2005-08-12T06:46:00.000Z	Snippy	windex	that may be right
2005-08-12T06:47:00.000Z	windex	Snippy	then use open source. In small countries, big business like the BSA, RIAA, and MPAA have more sway, and can throw you in jail much easier.
