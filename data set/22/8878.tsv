2005-04-28T06:30:00.000Z	abloylas		Hi! Could somebody help me play asf stream in firefox? What codecs do I need?
2005-04-28T06:32:00.000Z	abloylas		to play mp3 on xmms you need to get mpg123
2005-04-28T06:32:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	no
2005-04-28T06:32:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	apt-cache show xmms-mad
2005-04-28T06:33:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	technically you need 'libmad0'  :/
2005-04-28T06:34:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	yes
2005-04-28T06:34:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	I didn't say it wouldn't work... its just not the 'correct' way  :/
2005-04-28T06:35:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	libmad0 is a far better decoder than mpg123  :/
2005-04-28T06:43:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	you're welcome
2005-04-28T06:52:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	umm... w32codecs doesn't support that?
2005-04-28T06:53:00.000Z	abloylas	lunitik	apparently not. i have that and no cigar
2005-04-28T06:53:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	heh... I've never even see an asf stream... so can't speak from experience  :(
2005-04-28T06:53:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	try the 'all' pack from mplayerhq.hu  though
2005-04-28T06:54:00.000Z	abloylas	lunitik	i want to play the streams on http://www.webtelek.com/tv.php?
2005-04-28T06:56:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	don't get mplayer
2005-04-28T06:56:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	you already have totem-xine installed?
2005-04-28T06:57:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	no... but I'm not using the 'all' pack at mplayerhq.hu ...
2005-04-28T06:57:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	just get that, extract contents, and throw them into /usr/lib/win32 and try to view them again
2005-04-28T06:58:00.000Z	abloylas	lunitik	should i get the 'all' pack but not mplayer??
2005-04-28T06:58:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	correct...
2005-04-28T06:58:00.000Z	lunitik	abloylas	w32codecs is the 'essential' pack
2005-04-28T06:59:00.000Z	abloylas	lunitik	will try that, thanks
