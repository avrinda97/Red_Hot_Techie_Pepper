2010-08-05T03:39:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	Which version are you installing?
2010-08-05T03:39:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Lucid
2010-08-05T03:40:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	Ok, so after it shows you the post screen (where it lists what drives you have installed and what not) does it seem to boot the cd?  Does it show anything after the post screen?
2010-08-05T03:41:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Cd boots, i see a pinkish block with an image at teh bottom, then an underscore blinking, and then my display cuts out randomly. I also have W7 installed as well
2010-08-05T03:42:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	I would try the alternate install and use the command line installer.  It's available here: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download
2010-08-05T03:43:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Doing so i still get to use ubuntu with all of its GUI goodness when its done right?
2010-08-05T03:43:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	Yes you do.
2010-08-05T03:45:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Oh, and i also tried teh Wubi installer, same thing. Says its finishing install and display cuts out
2010-08-05T03:45:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Ima lso using an nvidia built in GPU
2010-08-05T03:45:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	What kind of video card do you have?
2010-08-05T03:45:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Lemme check
2010-08-05T03:47:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	GeForce 6150 LE
2010-08-05T03:49:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	Hmmm...I have Ubuntu installed on a couple systems with that GPU...if the alternate install dosen't work, maybe you should try an older version, like Hardy, and then upgrade it once it's working.
2010-08-05T03:49:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Allright :)
2010-08-05T03:56:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Installing teh 32 bit edition on a pc with a 64bit processor wont matter at all right?
2010-08-05T03:57:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	Nope, that'll work fine.
2010-08-05T04:03:00.000Z	SH-Chris	RedLance_	Does teh alternate installer include a partitioner as well?
2010-08-05T04:03:00.000Z	RedLance_	SH-Chris	Yes, it does.
