2009-09-16T04:57:00.000Z	dennygoot		ok i did that one command, and i got this drwxr-xr-x  3 root  root   4096 2009-09-15 12:46 ..
2009-09-16T04:57:00.000Z	dennygoot		a rsinstall of xsane and it's components did not fix the permissions deal..
2009-09-16T04:57:00.000Z	dennygoot		what do you mean?
2009-09-16T04:58:00.000Z	dennygoot		through synaptic if that helps
2009-09-16T04:58:00.000Z	dennygoot		/usr/bin/xsane
2009-09-16T04:58:00.000Z	dennygoot		yep 9.04
2009-09-16T05:00:00.000Z	dennygoot		should i maybe chown or chmod the /usr/bin/xsane folder or a file?
2009-09-16T05:01:00.000Z	dennygoot		ok now it's a pretty green
2009-09-16T05:01:00.000Z	dennygoot		it didnt say, it just printed /usr/bin/xsane in green
2009-09-16T05:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	use ls -l
2009-09-16T05:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	ls -l /usr/bin/xsane
2009-09-16T05:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	first check the forums/google. You're not the only one who's stumbled into this.
2009-09-16T05:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	make yourself a member of the 'scanner' group.
2009-09-16T05:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	sudo adduser YourUserName scanner
2009-09-16T05:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	mmm. I got that from a launchpad page.
2009-09-16T05:15:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	 https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xsane/+question/58817  (from googling 'xsane permissions')
2009-09-16T05:16:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	ah, it was 'saned'. but still the problem persists?
2009-09-16T05:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	there's a page in the ubuntu forums that recommends making the device world-writable. That's a lame solution, in my opinion. I thought they had something set up with group membership.
2009-09-16T05:24:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	if you search you'll find more, such as; http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-166944.html (which is the world-writable solution)
2009-09-16T05:26:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	is it a parallel port scanner?
2009-09-16T05:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	if so, help.ubuntu.com recommends adding yourself to the 'scanner' group, like that other page. Which I guess in your case involves creating the scanner group.
2009-09-16T05:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dennygoot	indeed, that seems like a common topic.
