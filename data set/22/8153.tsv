2007-11-29T12:40:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	are you on a default install?
2007-11-29T12:40:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	kay, you have several methods which act seperatly from each other
2007-11-29T12:41:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	by deafult i mean you have nt setup alternative search methods?
2007-11-29T12:42:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	all good, there are som issues though, and im trying to nut this out too
2007-11-29T12:42:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	ahh, i think you need one of the apt package commands
2007-11-29T12:43:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	umm think its sudo apt-cache showinfo <package-name>

2007-11-29T12:46:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	as a last resort you could try installing beagle
2007-11-29T12:46:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	but i dont recomned it, iuts a memory hog
2007-11-29T12:47:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	http://beagle-project.org/Ubuntu_Installation
2007-11-29T12:51:00.000Z	airtonix	utarpradesh	also you could use tracker...a search engine that is much lighter on memory
