2005-09-14T06:47:00.000Z	lakcaj	delp	what does dmesg | grep hd say?
2005-09-14T06:48:00.000Z	delp		burn[n] er: where is the device manger?  the dev folder?
2005-09-14T06:48:00.000Z	delp	lakcaj	it shows my dvdrom as hdc and my burner as hdd
2005-09-14T06:49:00.000Z	lakcaj	delp	well, if you cat /etc/fstab, you can see where the mount points are for those devices.  Is that what you were after?  I only started reading at the end of your conversation.
2005-09-14T06:51:00.000Z	delp	lakcaj	i'm trying to turn on dma so i can use dvd shrink and decrypter
2005-09-14T06:52:00.000Z	lakcaj	delp	hdparm -d1 /dev/hdd
2005-09-14T06:52:00.000Z	lakcaj	delp	what bytefoo said
2005-09-14T06:52:00.000Z	lakcaj		right
2005-09-14T06:54:00.000Z	delp		so i will only have todo it to the one drive?
2005-09-14T06:54:00.000Z	lakcaj		you can do it on both if the drives support it.  I can turn on dma for both my burner and my dvd drive
2005-09-14T06:55:00.000Z	lakcaj	delp	are you sure dma is even off?
2005-09-14T06:55:00.000Z	delp	lakcaj	what exactly does turning it on and off do?
2005-09-14T06:55:00.000Z	delp		it was, i checked
2005-09-14T06:55:00.000Z	lakcaj		dma = direct memory access
2005-09-14T06:55:00.000Z	lakcaj		translation -> speeds things up
2005-09-14T06:55:00.000Z	delp		ok, cool
2005-09-14T06:56:00.000Z	lakcaj		dma is (Direct Memory Access) PCs have DMA channels that allow certain devices to directly access memory in order to speed up the process. to turn on dma, hdparm -d1 /dev/hda. to make it permanent, edit /etc/hdparm.conf
2005-09-14T06:56:00.000Z	delp		i ran the one command that dvd shrink's site said to run to check for it being enabled or not and it showed it as off
2005-09-14T06:56:00.000Z	delp		lakcag: do you run that same command to turn it back off?
2005-09-14T06:56:00.000Z	delp	lakcaj	do you run that same command to turn it back off?
2005-09-14T06:57:00.000Z	lakcaj	delp	-d0 for off
2005-09-14T06:57:00.000Z	lakcaj	delp	but there is no reason to turn it off
