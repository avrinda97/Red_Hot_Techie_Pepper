2012-02-26T15:14:00.000Z	larister	soreau	do you have a second to help me?
2012-02-26T15:14:00.000Z	soreau	larister	ok so your external hdd isnt recognized or something?
2012-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	larister	soreau	Ubuntu boots on the external HDD just fine, but if that isn't present then there's no way I can access Windows on my main HDD
2012-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	soreau	larister	Ah so grub is installed to the external hdd
2012-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	larister	soreau	yup
2012-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	larister	soreau	probably a big mistake, I'm a bit of a n00b as I'm sure you can tell :)
2012-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	soreau	larister	You probably want to install grub to the internal disk I guess
2012-02-26T15:16:00.000Z	larister	soreau	to be honest I'm not so bothered, I was just trying out Ubuntu as I'm starting a new job
2012-02-26T15:17:00.000Z	soreau	larister	Yea thats fine.. but now that I think about it Im not sure that installing grub to the internal drive would help. Perhaps what you want to do is restore the windoze MBR, then when you want to boot ubuntu from the external drive, just boot it like a usb pen drive
2012-02-26T15:18:00.000Z	larister	soreau	yup I'll try that
2012-02-26T15:18:00.000Z	soreau	larister	ie. it sounds like you have installed grub to the MBR on the internal disk but the actual files it needs to load grub are on the external drive
2012-02-26T15:19:00.000Z	larister	soreau	sorry, MBR?
2012-02-26T15:19:00.000Z	soreau	larister	Master Boot Record
2012-02-26T15:19:00.000Z	larister	soreau	ah ok, maybe I just followed the ubuntu wizard when installing from a pen drive
2012-02-26T15:20:00.000Z	soreau	larister	Yea the default probably should be different when installing to an external drive
2012-02-26T15:21:00.000Z	larister	soreau	yeah I thought it would be quite safe to install to the external HDD, keep it isolated
2012-02-26T15:21:00.000Z	larister	soreau	didn't bank on it making those kind of changes...
2012-02-26T15:21:00.000Z	soreau	larister	Fail ;)
2012-02-26T15:22:00.000Z	larister	soreau	what else are Sunday mornings for other than frantically trying to fix one's botched tech adventures ;)
2012-02-26T15:23:00.000Z	soreau	larister	Helping people that are frantically trying to fix one's botched tech adventures
2012-02-26T15:23:00.000Z	larister	soreau	touche, and appreciated :)
2012-02-26T15:24:00.000Z	soreau	larister	no problem.. so anyway I'd boot that windoze disk and repair the mbr but that is beyond the scope of this channel unfortunately
