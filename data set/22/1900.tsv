2009-12-13T10:54:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 for what it's worth, ive always been happy with tightvnc
2009-12-13T10:54:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 its a vnc client for windows
2009-12-13T10:56:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 yeah just make sure the vnc server is on the student's computer and not yours lol
2009-12-13T10:57:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 google tightvnc
2009-12-13T10:57:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 i must have hopped in on this issue a bit late.  Your studens are all on ubuntu?
2009-12-13T10:58:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 then you would google tightvnc and install the server executable to each computer
2009-12-13T10:58:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 and you'll be using ubuntu, then?
2009-12-13T10:59:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 if you're using ubuntu, i'd recommend the default vnc client
2009-12-13T11:00:00.000Z	researcher1	bllz	is for what?
2009-12-13T11:01:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 don't make this complicated because it's really not =)  Install the tightvnc server on the student's computers and then use the default vnc client in ubuntu to control them
2009-12-13T11:01:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 and bllz is a corruption of "balls"
2009-12-13T11:02:00.000Z	bllz	researcher1	 I understand the temptation to want to carefully compare all your options, but really, vnc clients are all the same
