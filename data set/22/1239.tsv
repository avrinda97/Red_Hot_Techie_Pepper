2010-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	amanita_		Is there a way to pop in an empty hdd then migrate the installed ubuntu from the other hdd to the empty?
2010-09-19T11:43:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	i would boot from live cd then rsync the old install to new hdd
2010-09-19T12:00:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	right click on the image file -> properties -> Open with
2010-09-19T12:00:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	select gthumb there
2010-09-19T12:01:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	I did it, but right clicking is not the way I want to view images
2010-09-19T12:01:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	after you select the right open with action,  you can just double click
2010-09-19T12:02:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	won't work at all it still uses eog
2010-09-19T12:02:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	how did you select application in Open With?
2010-09-19T12:04:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	trying to translate, right click on a png -> open with -> other application -> choose feh or gthumb from the list, check the widget to remember settings for png files
2010-09-19T12:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	make sure you have really selected the app you want (a dot in the circle)
2010-09-19T12:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	not just make the app appear in the list nor click on the name
2010-09-19T12:09:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	like that http://ompldr.org/vNWt6OA/Screenshot-133.png
2010-09-19T12:10:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	my window looks totally different dude, no tabs at all and no circles or add-remove buttons :-(
2010-09-19T12:10:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	are you using GNOME ...
2010-09-19T12:10:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	yes
2010-09-19T12:14:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	my png settings http://ompldr.org/vNWt6OQ
2010-09-19T12:14:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	you are doing  Right click -> Open With  instead of  Right click -> properties -> open with
2010-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	Properties should be the menu entry at the bottom when you right click
2010-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	*facepalm*
2010-09-19T12:15:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	ok I got it.
2010-09-19T12:16:00.000Z	icarus-c	amanita_	you may need to do that for different image format at first
2010-09-19T12:17:00.000Z	amanita_	icarus-c	it is highly messed up, users first see the open with menu, and there is the option to link filetypes with apps
