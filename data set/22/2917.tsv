2010-05-19T09:25:00.000Z	dm_		btw who's idea was it for all the purple/orange everywhere, seriously.
2010-05-19T09:25:00.000Z	dm_		It went from poop brown, to Barney purple
2010-05-19T09:26:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	it looked like the bottum of a NY Public toilet up untill now... TRUST me, purple is an improvment
2010-05-19T09:26:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	id prefer the poop brown over purple
2010-05-19T09:34:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	i have mint running on a 900mhz p3 with some 390 mb ram and a 16 mb 2d graphics card... and at desktop, theres little difference too my i7 860, 4 gigs ram, gtx 275 that im on now
2010-05-19T09:34:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	 a bit overkill for a *nix box, wouldnt you say?
2010-05-19T09:35:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	im deving games
2010-05-19T09:35:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	better be makin' some good ones
2010-05-19T09:35:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	the gaming industry has been really lacking as of late
2010-05-19T09:36:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	im HOPING t get on with valve and help them port the steam games over...
2010-05-19T09:36:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	good luck
2010-05-19T09:37:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	they're having me play 20Qs with the current linux guy there (SHHH! Valve on linux is a reality!)
2010-05-19T09:38:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	It always was a reality, its just too bad these big buck companies dont catch on more often...
2010-05-19T09:38:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	It really wouldnt take em long to port/write a client with current code, the same thing goes for many of these companies.
2010-05-19T09:39:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	not with wine, not with dx9 translations, native, linux .so libs and proper Opengl binaries. Linux-Steam is also a stable backend! just no games work yet
2010-05-19T09:40:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	well thats true, they should move away from dx all together imo
2010-05-19T09:42:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	there's serious talk that is valve drops dx. M$ will patch win7 so that no valve game or steam version will work... ironically, M$ is more or less threatening suicide if valve (or a handful of other companies that are talking linux right now) decide to go with open standards
2010-05-19T09:49:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	still around?
2010-05-19T09:50:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	barely
2010-05-19T09:51:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	whats up
2010-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	gartral	dm_	pm
2010-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	dm_	gartral	i got it, thanks
