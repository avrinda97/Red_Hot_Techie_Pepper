2008-07-02T10:10:00.000Z	DankTank3		evening everyone
2008-07-02T10:12:00.000Z	DankTank3		uhmm.... so yea...
2008-07-02T10:12:00.000Z	DankTank3		i have a question lol
2008-07-02T10:13:00.000Z	DankTank3		i know this is probably the most asked question in all time
2008-07-02T10:13:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	nobody cares, just ask it
2008-07-02T10:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	not really
2008-07-02T10:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	there's only a few people talking, pretty easy to keep up
2008-07-02T10:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	nobody knows anything about your specific wireless setup in here, but google certainly does.  I'm sure you have a well documented wireless card
2008-07-02T10:30:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	if that is the case, then you probably have a card that doesn't work in linux, and maybe you should consider spending a little bit of money and just buy a card that has good linux support and save yourself some time
2008-07-02T10:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	"do something" ? can you be a little more specific?
2008-07-02T10:52:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	"after the original time" ?  after a reboot? after you edit the file? while you are editing the file?
2008-07-02T10:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	yah that's the wrong way to be doing that heh
2008-07-02T10:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	echo "blacklist ath_pci" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2008-07-02T10:56:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	keep in mind I don't even USE UBUNTU
2008-07-02T10:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	it's not really an ubuntu problem
2008-07-02T10:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	but nobody else in here asks ubuntu questions, so I figured I'd take a shot
2008-07-02T10:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	depends where I am
2008-07-02T10:58:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	right now i'm on a vista machine terminaled into my freebsd server.  my laptop has XP, work I use a mac and terminal into one of about a dozen different centos 5.1 machines depending on what I'm doing
2008-07-02T11:00:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	i don't do shit with wireless on *nix systems, so i can't help you
2008-07-02T11:00:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	because mouse=a adds other mouse behavior that is important to me
2008-07-02T11:01:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	are you running 64-bit?
2008-07-02T11:08:00.000Z	Fryguy--	DankTank3	looks pretty straightforward
