2008-03-21T17:38:00.000Z	sharperguy		anyone got any idea why when I click show details on a torrent in azureus, it segfaults?
2008-03-21T17:39:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	likely a memory problem with azureus; that is a very buggy program
2008-03-22T20:05:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	#ubuntu+1 please
2008-08-07T21:22:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	cancel out; then reboot into the 14 kernel and try from there.
2008-08-07T21:22:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	ok
2008-08-07T21:22:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	well i would but theres no apparent way to cancel
2008-08-07T21:23:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	you can let it run for a bit if you are not in a hurry.
2008-08-07T21:23:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	will it eventually finish?
2008-08-07T21:24:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	I fear it is the upgrade bug (feisty/gutsy/hardy) that is causing that.
2008-08-07T21:24:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	Well thats what I was trying to do
2008-08-07T21:25:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	then that is it.
2008-08-07T21:27:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	Well anyway I don't have time to fix it right now if its going to take some effort so I'll be back on later
2009-09-02T18:47:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	no need, its in regular repos
2009-09-02T18:47:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	Yeah but it want's me to install 3.5 alongside 3.0
2009-09-02T18:48:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	that is correct for jaunty
2009-09-02T18:48:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	Hence me question then
2009-09-02T18:48:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	are you strapped for disk space?
2009-09-02T18:50:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	sure, shiretoko will automatically import all your config/bookmarks etc
2009-09-02T18:50:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	I just don't get the point
2010-02-11T22:52:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	see the link above
2010-02-11T22:52:00.000Z	sharperguy	bazhang	Thanks, awesome
2010-10-03T05:35:00.000Z	bazhang	sharperguy	?
