2011-11-09T18:57:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	the ones you just wrote?
2011-11-09T18:57:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	yes
2011-11-09T18:58:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	i pasted them; they're not on my keyboard
2011-11-09T18:58:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	what keyboard do you have?
2011-11-09T18:58:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	azerty french keyboard
2011-11-09T18:58:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	i have comma, i have full stop
2011-11-09T18:58:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	i also have <>
2011-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	but i don't have '«' and i don't have '…' (triple points, that's just one character) either
2011-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	thats just 3 fullstops and 2 arrows
2011-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	no it's different, mine are just one character
2011-11-09T19:00:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	i dont get what you mean. i dont have a ">>" key
2011-11-09T19:01:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	i know, me too >>>>>>>>; i'm just trying for a way to write the character '»' (which is not on any keyboard i think)
2011-11-09T19:04:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	sorry it might be my irc client not showing those characters prperly
2011-11-09T19:05:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	oh ok :) np; are you in the terminal?
2011-11-09T19:07:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	i needed to configure the compose key: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key
2011-11-09T19:08:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	ah i have really no idea
2011-11-09T19:09:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	it's fine i found it; now i can do « » ® © … and feel proud about it (even though you're probably not seeing those characters ^^)
2011-11-09T19:09:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	basically it's a key, if you press it and then press twice on '<'; it will compose them and form «
2011-11-09T19:10:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	d you want it for messing about? or do you need it
2011-11-09T19:10:00.000Z	audionb	Gentoo64	ye i don't really need it :)
2011-11-09T19:10:00.000Z	Gentoo64	audionb	yeah
