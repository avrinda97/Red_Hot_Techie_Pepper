2005-06-20T16:22:00.000Z	bigfoot1		easy question: how do i figure out my IP address (i don't have a router)?
2005-06-20T16:22:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	ifconfig
2005-06-20T16:33:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	are you connect by ethernet card or modem?
2005-06-20T16:34:00.000Z	bigfoot1	zhukov	i have an always on internet connection. so i think this means ethernet.
2005-06-20T16:35:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	so what exactly do you want?
2005-06-20T16:35:00.000Z	bigfoot1	zhukov	i'd like to know my pc's ip address.
2005-06-20T16:36:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	give both ips please
2005-06-20T16:37:00.000Z	bigfoot1	zhukov	is it safe to give another person my ip addresses? isn't it like giving out your real home's address?
2005-06-20T16:38:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	there is an internet ip (external) and if you are connected to networks there is an internal ip adress
2005-06-20T16:38:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	most likely your ip is dynamic wich means it changes, in a maximum period of 36 hours
2005-06-20T16:39:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	if you ask that you arent :)
2005-06-20T16:40:00.000Z	bigfoot1	zhukov	what makes you think my ip is dynamic?
2005-06-20T16:40:00.000Z	bigfoot1	zhukov	please explain what you mean by it not being safe .
2005-06-20T16:41:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	the thing thing
2005-06-20T16:44:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	in windows with no firewall they can
2005-06-20T16:45:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	dont worry you are safe in ubuntu unless you are the big boss of kgb or cia or something like that :D
2005-06-20T16:46:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	but i think this is not the right place for those questions...you can     sudo apt-get install amule      and search in there for network book...they can teach you a lot more than i
2005-06-20T16:48:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	it google.com
2005-06-20T16:48:00.000Z	bigfoot1	zhukov	i googled it. wasn't sure which i should look at.
2005-06-20T16:48:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	amule perhaps?... :D just install it and run it
2005-06-20T16:55:00.000Z	bigfoot1	zhukov	you still interested in knowing the 2 ip addresses
2005-06-20T16:56:00.000Z	zhukov	bigfoot1	nop
