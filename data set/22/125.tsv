2012-06-25T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwakar	 perhaps  you need the vbox guest addations.
2012-06-25T11:26:00.000Z	dwakar	Dr_Willis	so it is not 12.04 bug?
2012-06-25T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwakar	 my mouse wheel works fine... you could test it with a live cd...
2012-08-04T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwakar	 when you click on the Big button at the top left.. at the bottom of that window are the differnt search lenses.

2012-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dwakar	 after installing new lens i think you need to log out/back in for them to appear
