2007-09-29T10:47:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	open synaptic. chose the gtk package. go to package -> force version.
2007-09-29T10:48:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	why can't you? didn't you install the debs instead of compiling it yourself?
2007-09-29T10:49:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	so did I and managed to remove it. why can't you force version?
2007-09-29T10:50:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	ah.
2007-09-29T10:53:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	in what way does the mac-menu fail? you don't get the menu at all (even if you remove the panel applet)?
2007-09-29T10:54:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	"yep" you get the menu if you remove the applet?
2007-09-29T10:57:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	there is a --target-release / --default-release option to apt-get you can try. I haven't used that myself so I don't knkow exactly how it works. perhaps someone can chip in?
2007-09-29T10:57:00.000Z	runemaste644	Jowi	could you join #csh-jokes so it is only us talking?
2007-09-29T10:58:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	It was the last thing to come to mind and don't really have any more help to give...
2007-09-29T11:02:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	try this: sudo apt-get -t edgy install libgtk2.0-0
2008-01-06T22:09:00.000Z	Jowi	runemaste644	xorg was a fork of xfree86 but is nowadays quite different.
