2010-01-04T15:59:00.000Z	soreau	Darkedge	What graphics card do you have?
2010-01-04T16:00:00.000Z	Darkedge	soreau	Intel 82845G

2010-01-04T16:03:00.000Z	soreau	Darkedge	Does it load ok on the live cd? When did this problem start happening?
2010-01-04T16:03:00.000Z	Darkedge	soreau	-_- I've just said, I'm on the Live CD and It started happening when I did a hard-reset cause of a freeze.
2010-01-04T16:04:00.000Z	soreau	Darkedge	So you installed, it was working fine, then it froze, you did a hard reset and then after booting now it gives black screen at gdm?
2010-01-04T16:06:00.000Z	Darkedge	soreau	Where gdm should be :P It kinda had a reason for freezing though, I was updating my username while I had my user highlighted so it said "login as user XXX" fact is I just reinstalled Ubuntu cause of a freeze, the same thing happened an Install ago, It froze, the only thing I could think of doing was reinstalling.
