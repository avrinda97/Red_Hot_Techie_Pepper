2005-08-29T15:25:00.000Z	rmflagg		Does anyone know anything about the workings of GDM?
2005-08-29T15:27:00.000Z	rmflagg		I am running Hoary and GDM doesn't ask if I want to use Session "X" as my default session anymore.  It also doesn't save the "Last" session setting.
2005-08-29T15:29:00.000Z	rmflagg		I can't find anything on Google about the settings and what to change inside GDM conf.
2005-08-29T15:31:00.000Z	rmflagg		Ok, so NOBODY in here can supply me with ANY insight as to what could have happened to my GDM setting?
2005-08-29T15:31:00.000Z	rmflagg		I am running Hoary and GDM doesn't ask if I want to use Session "X" as my default session anymore.  It also doesn't save the "Last" session setting.
2005-08-29T15:32:00.000Z	rmflagg		It also has the default setting to Gnome and I am running Fluxbox exclusively.
2005-08-29T15:33:00.000Z	keegan3747	rmflagg	I am not sure if I understand the question or not but don't u change the session by clicking session on the login screen?
2005-08-29T15:33:00.000Z	rmflagg		I am running Fluxbox.  I have been for months and everything has been fine.  It just changed last week!
2005-08-29T15:34:00.000Z	rmflagg	keegan3747	Yes, you do.  But it doesn't remember the Last session setting anymore.  So everytime I log in, I go to Gnome, which I don't use.
2005-08-29T15:35:00.000Z	rmflagg		Also, it doesn't ask anymore if I want to change my default setting to Fluxbox anymore.
2005-08-29T15:35:00.000Z	keegan3747	rmflagg	if you change the session by clicking session on the login screen, it should ask if you want to make it the default, so u should be able to edit the default there
2005-08-29T15:35:00.000Z	rmflagg		It doesn't ask anymore. :(
2005-08-29T15:35:00.000Z	keegan3747		hmmm...

2005-08-29T15:46:00.000Z	rmflagg	keegan3747	Fluxbox does show up in the Session menu.
