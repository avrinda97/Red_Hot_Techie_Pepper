2010-08-22T18:30:00.000Z	Strashniq		well if it wasn`t so bad i wouldnt join the #ubuntu
2010-08-22T18:31:00.000Z	Strashniq		I just need to copy all files from the cd to the drive and create some solution to force my PC to dualboot
2010-08-22T18:32:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	what are you trying to do?
2010-08-22T18:34:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	are you using unetbooting now? (you chose a difficult name)
2010-08-22T18:34:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	Its me hunter86_bg ,
2010-08-22T18:35:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	should i pick the NetInstall ?
2010-08-22T18:35:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	i cant help you here cause i dont use kubuntu, just go for the latest version, yes net install
2010-08-22T18:35:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	should i choose Hard Disk type ?
2010-08-22T18:36:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	make sure you know how to part the disc BEFORE you start the installation
2010-08-22T18:36:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	yes hard disc
2010-08-22T18:36:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	well i plan to make it dualboot -its NTFS for now
2010-08-22T18:37:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	if you lose windows your and the install goes wrong your computer will be useless
2010-08-22T18:37:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	so we have to do it the right way ...
2010-08-22T18:37:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	listen ,when you get to the partition part - choose "manual"
2010-08-22T18:38:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	how much space do i need to install the ubuntu ?
2010-08-22T18:39:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	listen very carefully - when you get to the partition option do not choose any "resize " option. understand?
2010-08-22T18:39:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	i`m still making space for the drive - how much space i should have ?
2010-08-22T18:39:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	once the install start , i cant help you, how many partitions do you have ? how big are they?
2010-08-22T18:40:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	C:-20 gig D: 20 gig E: 10-15 gig
2010-08-22T18:41:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	i would go for the 20 gig D partition, remember that linux names them differently, do you know if C is the first partition on the disc?
2010-08-22T18:42:00.000Z	Strashniq	itai_michaelson	C: is the main , D: is encrypted ,won`t be accessible without the program i use
2010-08-22T18:43:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	Strashniq	E will be fine then , remeber that linux names them differently, when you start installing linux there will no more C. D and E, they will appear as HDA1, HDA2 HDA3 or SDA1 SDA2 or other combinations depending on how many discs you have
