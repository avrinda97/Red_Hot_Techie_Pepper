2011-08-28T04:34:00.000Z	kwtm		Does Ubuntu now have the feature where a laptop can be suspended to RAM, and then if not used within a certain amount of time (say half an hour) it then suspends to disk to save battery life?
2011-08-28T04:35:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	Suspended to RAM = stand-by
2011-08-28T04:37:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	Not sure of your point.  For the record, I agree that suspended to RAM = stand-by.  Does Ubuntu have the feature of hibernation after a certain amount of time in standby?
2011-08-28T04:38:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	This would be a BIOS feature if it exists. As far as I know Ubuntu doesn't haves a feature like this.
2011-08-28T04:39:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	Really? I have a winXP laptop dualbooting into Kubuntu, and the WinXP is able to suspend from RAM to disk, but Kubuntu 10.04 does not, which is what's preventing me from using Kubuntu for daily use.   It seems more like a OS issue than BIOS --how is the BIOS able to suspend to disk from RAM?
2011-08-28T04:40:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	how do you do that, suspend from ram to disk?
2011-08-28T05:02:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	I'll tell you how I do it; it might help.  I assign 8GB to my Ubuntu partition, but all my data is in a separate partition which at least 100GB in size (my biggest is 1.2TB).   So I'd estimate 8GB + whatever data you need.
2011-08-28T05:05:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	If you know how to do it, I suggest Ubuntu itself in a smaller partition of, say, 8-10GB, then another partition of 8-10GB in case you want another OS (like the next higher version of ubuntu) and then the rest is data.
2011-08-28T05:06:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	That is the system that has been agreed to for disk partitions.  Nor do you need to create more than 4 partitions.  You only need 2.
2011-08-28T05:06:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	Within a parti -- oh
2011-08-28T05:07:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	Windows partition, boot partition, recovery partition, some other tools partition, and I want to create ubuntu partition
2011-08-28T05:09:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	As I was going to say when someone jumped in with a factoid that was only directed to one person within this conversation, you only need 2 partitions: if you set the second partition as "extended", then that partition can itself contain as many other partitions as you need.  These would be logical partitions.  But primary means that there are no partitions contained inside.
2011-08-28T05:09:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	I'm stuck with 'unallocated' now
2011-08-28T05:10:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	So what you want to do is replace all but the first partition (which must be primary) with logical partitions inside an extended partition.
2011-08-28T05:12:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	Can GParted switch a partition from primary to extended?   If not, then you'll have to convert one partition at a time.  If you can't spare a primary partition to erase and convert into extended, you may be out of luck.
2011-08-28T05:12:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	I dont know, where can I check this?
2011-08-28T05:13:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	You have GParted open right now -- is there an option for "change partition to extended"?  I wonder who used all 4 primaries?  That was not a very wise thing to do.
2011-08-28T05:13:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	HP Did
2011-08-28T05:15:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	Aaaugh.  My condolences.  I've had bad experiences with their computers.  Anyway ... you may need to get rid of one partition, or consider buying a new hard disk (it might be enough of a bargain).  I wonder if you can store the entirety of one partition on another?  What were your 4 partitions again?
2011-08-28T05:15:00.000Z	kwtm	alex--	You have a boot partition and a separate Windows partition?  Is that necessary?  Last time I did this I was using Win2k.
2011-08-28T05:16:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	boot is for some bios like thing
2011-08-28T05:16:00.000Z	alex--	kwtm	HP did when I bought the laptop
