2010-07-16T14:59:00.000Z	opij		is there a way to have evolution notify you of a new email without having to have it open?
2010-07-16T14:59:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	there is a notify that you can add to the system tray
2010-07-16T15:00:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	*notifier*
2010-07-16T15:01:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	theres a gdesklet that lets you do this also without having evolution open
2010-07-16T15:01:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	i want to use as little memory as possible
2010-07-22T10:25:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	google returns 54,700 results to that question. anyways this thread might help --> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=613297
2010-07-22T10:44:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	sudo apt-get remove pidgin
2010-07-22T10:45:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	is giving me malicious commands
2010-07-22T10:45:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	you asked how to remove pidgin, i gave you the command; whats malicious about that?
2010-07-22T10:46:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	and you're growing use of profanity doesnt help
2010-07-23T15:07:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	what do you mean by that? unlike telnet, ssh does not echo characters remotely as well as locally
2010-07-23T15:08:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	i just dont want everything i type to appear 2 seconds after i type it. it makes typing and correcting very difficult.
2010-07-23T15:09:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	that is just an indication of the low internet speed; if you didnt see that, how would you know what you typed and whether it was correct?
2010-07-23T15:10:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	then where should i enter that
2010-07-23T15:11:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	i would like what i type in openssh to appear immediately. not 3 seconds later
2010-07-23T15:11:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	that depends on the connection speed between your pc and the remote
2010-07-23T15:12:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	is there no way to change it?
2010-07-23T15:12:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	get a high speed connection
2010-07-23T15:12:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	i have a very high speed connection
2010-07-23T15:13:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	what about the remote? also, if the load on remote is very high, it might appear sluggish
2010-07-23T15:14:00.000Z	opij	phlak_user	why should that have to appear when im typing crap though. the feature should be there to not have to send what i type to the server and then back again. isnt that kind of ridiculous?
2010-07-23T15:16:00.000Z	phlak_user	opij	Im sorry I havent understood your requirement; your best bet is to go with llutz's recommendation
