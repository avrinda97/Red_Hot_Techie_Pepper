2009-04-27T16:14:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	Tools -> check Clear Private Data and click Clear Private Data Now
2009-04-27T16:16:00.000Z	mylisto	ipatel	that didn't work.  For some reason htomail.com is still not loading
2009-04-27T16:16:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	what makes you think this is a DNS issue?
2009-04-27T16:17:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	open up terminal and type nslookup hotmail.com

2009-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	can you ping hotmail.com
2009-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	your DNS is resolving fine
2009-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	mylisto	ipatel	when I try pinging hotmail it just hangs...and every other stie works fine
2009-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	the hanging of the ping is normal as they are blocking ICMP
2009-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	do you have a static IP address?
2009-04-27T16:31:00.000Z	mylisto	ipatel	can I try using a proxy?
2009-04-27T16:32:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	how do you connect to the internet?
2009-04-27T16:36:00.000Z	ipatel	mylisto	alternatively you can log into your wireless router and see if it lets you refresh DNS configuration
