2007-03-09T07:54:00.000Z	ok_kid		hi, this is ricky here. i am back but forgot the nick of the one i was talking to.....are you still there?
2007-03-09T07:56:00.000Z	ok_kid		using Ubuntu, and looking for a way to change the default boot OS, when it starts.
2007-03-09T07:57:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	You need to change the default in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file
2007-03-09T08:00:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- You will see that it is the file that defines the grub menu screen.  It is in ubuntu, under /boot/grub
2007-03-09T08:12:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	The "0" in "default           0" means to use the first choice in the list.  Look down further in the list and you will see the different kernels and OS's.  0 is for the first, 1 for the second, and so on.  Change "default       0" to "default    3" or wehatever you want
2007-03-09T08:12:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	 Look down to the line ## ## End default options ## ##
2007-03-09T08:13:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	The little paragraphs that start after that are separate listings in the grub menu you see on boot-up
2007-03-09T08:14:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- as far as I know thats the only way to test grub
2007-03-09T08:14:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- I hope you are listing ubuntu as the new default (j/k  =)
2007-03-09T08:17:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	 You need to edit with sudo.  Instead of "gedit menu.lst", type "sudo gedit menu.lst"
2007-03-09T08:19:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- In ubuntu, the first user is the administrator, but you need to give your password anyway before excersing admin priviledges
2007-03-09T08:22:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- did you start the editor from the command line or from the gui?
2007-03-09T08:22:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	I am not entirely sure how to start the editor as root from the gui...I am lazy and always use the cli lol
2007-03-09T08:23:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- ubuntu is a sudo distro.  su has only limited uses.
2007-03-09T08:27:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- no, gedit may show line numbers, but it is really a quite straightforward gui text editoir.  drag the file from the gui onto gedit and the file will appear.  Alternatively, you could go to the fdirectory in the cli with "cd /boot/grub" and then type "sudo gedit menu.lst"
2007-03-09T08:42:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- yeah but I should probably head hoem soon
2007-03-09T08:42:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- Did it work?
2007-03-09T08:43:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- great!
2007-03-09T08:44:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- no problem, I'm not a programmer, I am a doctor, so I am sure you can learn this stuff over time too
2007-03-09T08:45:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- if you ran the editor from the command line it will spit out all sorts of debug info to the command line.  You can safely ignore that almost all the time
2007-03-09T08:50:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	Unix came out of the Bell Labs
2007-03-09T08:51:00.000Z	martalli	ok_kid	- uc berkely reqrote unix bit by bit until it was completey rewritten...they then released that onder the so-called "bsd" license
