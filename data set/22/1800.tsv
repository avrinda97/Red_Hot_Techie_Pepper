2010-01-04T17:32:00.000Z	bloodski		i have a problem with optical audio on my asus at3n7a-i mobo, i upgraded alsa to 1.0.21 and it still says no optical data on my logitech receiver, and there's no red light from the cable.. analogue audio works tho, any ideas? running ubuntu 9.04

2010-01-04T17:35:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	seems like the same issue, iirc pa and alsa use pretty much the same way of detecting hardware
2010-01-04T17:35:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	my bad I linked the wrong launchpad bug

2010-01-04T17:36:00.000Z	bloodski	Xaero252	i do however get some output refering to iec958 audio
2010-01-04T17:36:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	basically the bug is that the driver is treating your Optical audio port as a microphone
2010-01-04T17:37:00.000Z	bloodski	Xaero252	was there a bugfix?
2010-01-04T17:37:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	if its indeed the same issue, which it sounds like it may be; pastebin what you were going to pastebin and it may end up being something different, I didnt see a bugfix from what I read earlier when I was trying to help corecode

2010-01-04T17:38:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	iec958 according to google is a digital output port for your card

2010-01-04T17:39:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	thats your issue
2010-01-04T17:40:00.000Z	bloodski	Xaero252	ok, thx for your help, was there a fix to it? havent read it thru yet
2010-01-04T17:41:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	yes alsamixer, unmute master and unmute your optical audio out in alsamixer

2010-01-04T17:45:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	the far right side there is a muted S/pdif port, and theres also the potential that its on another "sound card" you can cycle through those with F6 if there is one for that audio control
2010-01-04T17:46:00.000Z	bloodski	Xaero252	only have default / nvidia / enter device name
2010-01-04T17:46:00.000Z	bloodski	Xaero252	how can i unmute it?
2010-01-04T17:47:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	press M with it highlighted
2010-01-04T17:49:00.000Z	Xaero252	bloodski	anytime
