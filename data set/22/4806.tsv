2008-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	apparle		Actually I am a kubuntu user but right now I am installing a Gnome software so I thought I would ask here. 'libbonobo2-common' and 'libbonobo2-0' both depend on each other what should I do ??
2008-02-01T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	install them both with the same apt-get command
2008-02-01T09:43:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	and gmcastil: I donot have net at home and hence I download packages on an XP box and take them home through pendrive?? Now what should I do
2008-02-01T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	put all the packages you downloaded into one directory with nothing else in it, then   sudo dpkg -i *
2008-02-01T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	and for the future, look into  apt-zip , it's designed to help with that
2008-02-01T09:46:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	This is a differentt query. I f I have 2 packages with 1 depending on other in a folder and I use 'sudo dpkg -i *' will the dependencies get resolved
2008-02-01T09:47:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	yes, dpkg will handle that fine. The * matches all files in that directory. If you have other ones, you can do  sudo dpkg -i  <deb1> <deb2>  by name
2008-02-01T09:49:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	I cannot use apt-zip as the other box has WinXP on it.
2008-02-01T09:50:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	I get all the dependencies as I have made a list of what all is installed on my pc and compare it while downloading dependencies
2008-02-01T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	apt-zip creates a script that uses wget to download the files; easily translated to a msdos script
2008-02-01T09:52:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	Could you come oftopic and please explain it in more detail as I am new user
2008-02-01T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	it's been a few years since I used it, but sure
2008-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	Please explain it as I am becoming crazy doing all this >>[ATI graphic card], [sound card not working with ALSA], [lastly its very difficult to install simple softwares
2008-02-01T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	the bottom line for ubuntu is you really need internet for it to be useful
2008-02-01T09:56:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	But i want to make it usable without internet
2008-02-01T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	get it to the net, install the stuff you want, then disconnect
2008-02-01T09:58:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	Immpossible as it is a not a laptop and moreover I don't have enough permissions at home  to move the box as I am young (17)
2008-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	then you're kinda stuck, really. Linux is fundamentally a networked os
2008-02-01T10:01:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	I do know what you're talking about, I lived at the bottom of a 3k pipe for over a year, it was excruciating even with that
2008-02-01T10:07:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	I am extremely thankful for your help. I will look into apt-zip thing. Thanks
2008-02-01T10:08:00.000Z	nickrud	apparle	wweasel gmcastil has been very helpful to many already. Everyone has their bad moments
2008-02-01T10:09:00.000Z	apparle	nickrud	We are joking
