2008-12-08T02:03:00.000Z	MSG4		Is ubuntu 8.10 64 bits stable with all programs?
2008-12-08T02:04:00.000Z	MSG4		Question can i install a 32bit ubuntu 8.10 then do some command to instlal a 64bit ?
2008-12-08T02:05:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	nope. If you want 64-bit Ubuntu you need to grab a 64-bit disk and install 64-bit Ubuntu.
2008-12-08T02:06:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	without various tweaks, 32-bit supports 3.something GB of ram. 64-bit supports a heck of a lot more than 4GB.
2008-12-08T02:07:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	nope. I've been using it since the summer and I haven't come across anything less stable or more broken in 64-bit Ubuntu than 32-bit Ubuntu.
2008-12-08T02:07:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	alright ^_^
2008-12-08T02:08:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	does it show that u have 4gb or more
2008-12-08T02:08:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	yeah
2008-12-08T02:08:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	also it happens to my window xp
2008-12-08T02:09:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	Windows Vista 32-bit and 64-bit have the same problem. 32-bit can only address up to 3.something GB, 64-bit can address everything. It's a problem common to all OSes.
2008-12-08T02:09:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	( XP 64-bit is a messed-up, poor excuse for an Operating System, so it's not really a good comparison )
2008-12-08T02:09:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	so all i have to do is get a 64 bits verision off ubuntu and xp
2008-12-08T02:10:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	get a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, yes. I'd highly recommend against using 64-bit XP.
2008-12-08T02:13:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	which one Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Desktop or Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop (the latest version)
2008-12-08T02:14:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	depends. The LTS is theoretically more stable. 8.10 is newer. I'd personally go with 8.10.
2008-12-08T02:15:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	by "theoretically", I mean that the new stuff in Intrepid/8.10 fixed some hardware problems I was having and therefore Intrepid is more stable for me =/
2008-12-08T02:17:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	So i should get lts over the Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop (the latest version)
2008-12-08T02:19:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	i notice that when i click download it say amd64 is that for amd processor?
2008-12-08T02:19:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	Like I said, it depends. Do you have any particular special requirement for long term support? Like, you're putting it on a server, or on a workstation or something? if not, just get 8.10
2008-12-08T02:19:00.000Z	rww	MSG4	amd64 is for all 64-bit processors, not just amd ones. the name is disingenuous
2008-12-08T02:20:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	nope maybe
2008-12-08T02:20:00.000Z	MSG4	rww	if i install LTS Desktop I could still update to the lastest version?
