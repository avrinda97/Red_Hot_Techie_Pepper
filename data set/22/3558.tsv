2009-07-17T06:06:00.000Z	chrome_		hi, when I connect through ssh I see a text. How can I change that text?
2009-07-17T06:06:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	change the motd file
2009-07-17T06:06:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	where's it?
2009-07-17T06:13:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	I can't see the location of that file in the ssh_config..
2009-07-17T06:14:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	give me a sec to check it out
2009-07-17T06:16:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	doh! that message comes from the server, so it is in sshd_config. The line you want is
2009-07-17T06:17:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	you can either edit the default (issue.net) or create another file and put the filename in the config file
2009-07-17T06:17:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	thank you :)
2011-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	are you running linux in a vm?
2011-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	yes why?
2011-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	just checking....the line you want looks like this....
2011-07-03T00:53:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	I think I will use a script instead of gstab
2011-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	the first (VMShare) is the virtualbox sharename, the full path is the path to the shared folder in your users home
2011-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	will that work?
2011-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	I used it when I was running linux under winxp. Nowadays it is the other way around, so I haven't tried it in about six months. And with the 'new and improved' ubuntu, I won't guarantee anything <smile>
2011-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	ok thanks :)
2011-07-03T00:57:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	if you put that in fstab you do not have to reboot to test. Just type 'sudo mount VMShare' and if the line is good the share will mount
2011-07-03T00:57:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	I should write more complete explanations <smile>
2011-07-03T01:04:00.000Z	chrome_	th0r	it didn't accept the default option, so I changed to 'rw,exec'
2011-07-03T01:04:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	well, it has been a while, and like I said...the new ubuntu might have changed it a bit
2011-07-03T01:05:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	and it might have been 'defaults'.....in old age the memory goes right after something else, but I can't remember what that is
2011-07-03T03:42:00.000Z	th0r	chrome_	there is no way to backup short of a reinstall.
