2010-02-18T08:12:00.000Z	dodecahedron		Linux is for dumb mentally retarded bitches who ate too many lead chips as babies. Ubuntu is gay care bear cotton candy pansy ass insecure bloated faggotry compared to the spartan NetBSD and OpenBSD
2010-02-18T08:14:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	life must be rough when you're part of the forgotten
2010-02-18T08:15:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	uh, OpenBSD does not want to be a popular OS we just want to be the best at what we do. We also do not care about newbies like Ubuntu we expect OpenBSD users to be advanced users
2010-02-18T08:16:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	sounds like you have a luddite sausage fest, all 3 members of your community
2010-02-18T08:16:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	OpenBSD developers know exactly who our target audience is ourselves the elite and not the benighted masses
2010-02-18T08:16:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	Ubuntu panders to the benighted masses the newbies
2010-02-18T08:17:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	yeah being on the cutting edge of security technology sure is luddite </sarcasm>
2010-02-18T08:17:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	thou hast protest too much -- I think you're trying to convince yourself more than anyone else that you're elite.
2010-02-18T08:18:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	I'm just having fun trolling. You are putting too much meaning into my presence here
2010-02-18T08:18:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	I'll let you live in your little 1990s dream world though
2010-02-18T08:19:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	yeah the 1990s when linux was still exclusively for geeks and still had a relatively knowledgeable userbase unlike now where Linux is for bitches and dumbe ones at that and Ubuntu is the primary cotton candy pansy ass Bitch distro
2010-02-18T08:21:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	there are two kinds of camps : the userfriendly camp e.g. Ubuntu and Windows where security is a joke and the security camp i.e. OpenBSD which generally shuns usability
2010-02-18T08:21:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	your over compensation is too obvious
2010-02-18T08:22:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	I guess since there is no women around for you to blame your inadequacies on, you have to resort to blaming linux these days LOL
2010-02-18T08:24:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	don't you have a small innocent animal to torment like a normal sociopath?
2010-02-18T08:27:00.000Z	dodecahedron	PingFloyd	don't you have more time to waste on parasitic illiterate newbies who refuse to seriously research their problems first before asking like the retarded fool you are ?
2010-02-18T08:29:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	great to know you set the bar high on accomplishments in life
2010-02-18T08:30:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	I'm sure most of the people in here have you on /ignore by now, but I don't because you're quite entertaining
2010-02-18T08:32:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	I guess only the macho he-men run BSD :P
2010-02-18T08:33:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	yeah BSD users do kind of remind me of catholic priests
2010-02-18T08:36:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	and you're a millionaire too right?  Just like every other person on irc.
2010-02-18T08:36:00.000Z	PingFloyd	dodecahedron	because everyone on irc is a millionaire womanizing badass
