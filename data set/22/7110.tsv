2006-06-09T11:39:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	you only need to emulate if you have a 2 button mouse
2006-06-09T11:39:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	the option emulates a third button by using gestures
2006-06-09T11:47:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	restart X
2006-06-09T11:51:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	you can test the drivers by using glxgears
2006-06-09T11:53:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	i think it's working, nice number by the way
2006-06-09T11:55:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	just close the window when you are tired of it
2006-06-09T11:57:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	just close the window the standard way
2006-06-09T11:59:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	i think you need the nvidia config panel, dont remember the package for it, or if it is included
2006-06-09T12:01:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	you need the nvidia config panel
2006-06-09T12:01:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	see if you already have it, run nvidia-settings
2006-06-09T12:03:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	use ALT+F2, or run it on a terminal
2006-06-09T12:04:00.000Z	JoseStefan	uXp	see if it has dual monitor options within it
