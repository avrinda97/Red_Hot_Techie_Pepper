2011-05-10T03:54:00.000Z	Guest80095		you have to do first
2011-05-10T03:54:00.000Z	Guest80095		ifconfig wlan0 down
2011-05-10T03:55:00.000Z	Guest80095		and then in an other line sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
2011-05-10T03:55:00.000Z	Guest80095		or if you prefer
2011-05-10T03:55:00.000Z	Guest80095		sudo ifconfig wlan0 down && sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
2011-05-10T03:56:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	I have a feeling I have a hardware issue based on the fact that I'm also having additional problems in Chrome OS with the wireless.
2011-05-10T03:56:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	are you aware of a log I can possibly refer to that may give me some idea of what is going on?
2011-05-10T03:57:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	I'll have to try it when my actual device disconnects again. All day, I haven't had the problem, but during the weekend it was on a constant, but random, basis.
2011-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	it doesn't matter which wireless network I am connected to at the time, btw. In addition, Chrome OS was designed for this machine and it also has the same problems.
2011-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	I have 10.10. I don't want to upgrade to 11.04 yet. I've been using Ubuntu 10.10 with no problems since January. This problem has only recently started.
2011-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	Guest80095	kenneth__	whar Ubuntu have you installed?
2011-05-10T03:59:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	My Chrome OS hasn't updated in some time, but the problem seems identical and I hadn't had that problem before.
2011-05-10T03:59:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	my 3G on Chrome OS works fine when the Wifi dies. I don't have the 3G set up in Ubuntu.
2011-05-10T04:00:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	are you aware of how to set Chrome OS to dev mode without the stock bios?
2011-05-10T04:00:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	without the stock bios, ChromeOS has no way of telling if the dev switch is flipped or not.
2011-05-10T04:00:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	so, it defaults to normal ChromeOS.
2011-05-10T04:01:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	do you have experience with ChromeOS?
2011-05-10T04:01:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	or rather, a CR-48 laptop?
2011-05-10T04:04:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	yeah, it's pretty odd on a normal setup. I think it's possible my wireless card could have been overheating...maybe the problem has just gone away now.
2011-05-10T04:04:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	thanks anyway Guest80095. You wouldn't happen to be aware of any logs I can refer to would you?
2011-05-10T04:04:00.000Z	kenneth__	Guest80095	like, where would input/output errors appear?
