2011-10-14T16:19:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	bhavesh	Ubuntu 11.10 lags a bit on it, I would suggest Kubuntu on it that works like a charm
2011-10-14T16:20:00.000Z	bhavesh	GirlyGirl	ok
2011-10-14T16:20:00.000Z	bhavesh	GirlyGirl	Well did u try ubuntu gnome 3 shell on it? Thats not supposed to lag
2011-10-14T16:20:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	bhavesh	That is worse!
2011-10-14T16:21:00.000Z	bhavesh	GirlyGirl	lol
2011-10-14T16:21:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	bhavesh	Not that the netbook is slow ... GTK3 etc is still new
2011-10-14T16:21:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	bhavesh	Anyways I actually prefer KDE even since before
2011-10-14T16:22:00.000Z	bhavesh	GirlyGirl	Well ive got a ASUS eee PC 900HA
2011-10-14T16:22:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	bhavesh	Ah yes that is very different than mine a lot slower
2011-10-14T16:23:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	bhavesh	1st try Kubuntu, according to me it will be blazing fast ... if its not go with lubuntu
2011-10-14T16:23:00.000Z	bhavesh	GirlyGirl	ok
