2008-02-10T03:23:00.000Z	Yahooadam		hey, my sudo is acting up (ubuntu 7.10 desktop) for example
2008-02-10T03:23:00.000Z	Yahooadam		username@hostname:/etc$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers
2008-02-10T03:23:00.000Z	Yahooadam		username@hostname:/etc$
2008-02-10T03:25:00.000Z	arnducky	Yahooadam	only the default (1st) user is added to the admin group in Gutsy.  The bug is on Launchpad
2008-02-10T03:25:00.000Z	Yahooadam	arnducky	- i am on the 1st user
2008-02-10T03:25:00.000Z	arnducky	Yahooadam	what happens when you try sudo -i   ?
2008-02-10T03:26:00.000Z	Yahooadam		username is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2008-02-10T03:27:00.000Z	Yahooadam	arnducky	- ok, so i think somethings gone wrong, how do i get myself _back_ into the sudoer's file?
2008-02-10T03:27:00.000Z	Yahooadam		especially as this is the only user on the machine >_<
2008-02-10T03:29:00.000Z	arnducky	Yahooadam	$: sudo gedit /etc/sudoers.list    [from safemode if necessary]
2008-02-10T03:30:00.000Z	arnducky		errr nm
2008-02-10T03:30:00.000Z	Yahooadam		what button is it to get up the grub menu - the monitor on this comp is crap and slow
2008-02-10T03:30:00.000Z	arnducky		use sudoedit
2008-02-10T03:30:00.000Z	arnducky		It has safety features
2008-02-10T03:30:00.000Z	arnducky		!sudoedit
2008-02-10T03:31:00.000Z	arnducky		grrrr...
2008-02-10T03:31:00.000Z	arnducky		BRB
2008-02-10T03:33:00.000Z	arnducky	Yahooadam	 just sudoers not sudoers.list  (sorry -- they changed it since I last looked)
2008-02-10T03:33:00.000Z	Yahooadam	arnducky	- i think i go it, just used sudo visudo
2008-02-10T03:34:00.000Z	arnducky	Yahooadam	yeah that's it -- my apologies.   It's been quite some time since I've used it.  Visudo has a great man page with examples.  You should be fine now.
2008-02-10T03:35:00.000Z	Yahooadam		yeah, its up and running, i think i used an instruction for virtualbox and it messed my groups
2008-02-10T03:35:00.000Z	arnducky	Yahooadam	if you use visudo exclusively, it will protect you from making really silly changes -- checks syntax when you save
