2005-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	topyli	kadambi	it's looking for a scsi device. you didn't say dev=ATAPI did you?
2005-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	kadambi	topyli	 i said dev=ATAPI and it returned the prompt
2005-12-02T13:04:00.000Z	topyli	kadambi	oh i mean as an argument to cdrecord. like "cdrecord -scanbus dev=ATAPI"
