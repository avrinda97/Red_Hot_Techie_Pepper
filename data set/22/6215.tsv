2006-12-10T17:54:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	... i was lookin aroun web found a link which says make a directory in /mnt and then mount the linux drive to it which i did
2006-12-10T17:56:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	...
2006-12-10T17:56:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	then open Applcations > Accessories > Terminal  .  In it type "sudo chroot /mnt" then "grub-install '(hd0)' "  less the " of course.
2006-12-10T17:57:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	it says ... chroot: can't run command /bin/bash no such file or diretory ...
2006-12-10T17:59:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	exit would close terminal ...
2006-12-10T06:00:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	Yeah try another terminal your chroot is wrong if you have your disk mounted as /mnt/hda1 it should be chroot /mnt/hda1
2006-12-10T06:01:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	does "ls /mnt" show the directories "bin" and "boot"
2006-12-10T06:02:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	.... just did as u said ...
2006-12-10T06:05:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	 lets go back to the begining what is in the mnt directory you're using?
2006-12-10T06:05:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	... i have all folders which normally ubuntu has ...
2006-12-10T06:07:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	the first command did work ... chroot one ... but second one ... grub install hd0 gave that message that sudo unable to lookup ubuntu via gethostbyname()
2006-12-10T06:09:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	you don't need a sudo on the second one... are you trying it just as it is with the single ' around the '(hd0)' like that?
2006-12-10T06:12:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	If your boot device is not /dev/hda then you should replace the hd0 with /dev/xxx whatever you have does this apply?
2006-12-10T06:13:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	need a bit help here ... how can i find out which one it is ... as gparted shows hda1 as ext3 partition ... in /dev there is no hd*
2006-12-10T06:14:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	From an another terminal do a 'mount' it will be listed there.
2006-12-10T06:18:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	... from another window if i do ls /dev/hd* it should i have hda1 etc etc ... but when i do pwd in same window it also says i am in /dev but title says i am in /mnt/hda1
2006-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	 From what you're saying your current terminal is in the wrong place close all your terminals and start with a new one. Then do just 'mount' and look for /mnt<perhaps something> there.
2006-12-10T06:22:00.000Z	Dimensions	leny	it says /dev/hda1 on /mnt/hda1 type ext3 (rw)
2006-12-10T06:24:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	Then do a "chroot /mnt/hda1" then on the next line a "grub-install '(hd0)'"
2006-12-10T06:28:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	I'm at a loss as to why, this very procedure worked for me yesterday.  Try quitting that window, if following the website didin't work I'll have to hand you over
2006-12-10T06:32:00.000Z	leny	Dimensions	 Sorry to take your time up.. anyway is 00:30 UK time and time for me to sleep. Rgds - Leny
