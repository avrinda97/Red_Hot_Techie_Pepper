2009-07-24T05:26:00.000Z	dameon		i've got an interesting question regarding servers and ubuntu server edition
2009-07-24T05:26:00.000Z	dameon		anyone know anything?
2009-07-24T05:27:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	we do....next
2009-07-24T05:29:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	update bios
2009-07-24T05:45:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	I would take those 16 mb out first
2009-07-24T05:46:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	 I have no idea which 16 MB that is...
2009-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	well pull all out, leave 1 stick try. works - add one more and continue
2009-07-24T05:48:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	 I might try that... But i'll be here for ever :)
2009-07-24T05:49:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	common it's only 16 slots :)
2009-07-24T05:49:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	even though bios shows all 450 does not mean, it correctly transfers (or whatever) them to OS
2009-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	yeah, but the cover has a power-kill, as in I need to reassemble the computer every time to test
2009-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	you can usually lock that one with screwdriver
2009-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	 i have no os...
2009-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	but install is OS
2009-07-24T05:51:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	 it'll take an awl with how long the pin is on the cover... and good point on the os....
2009-07-24T05:51:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	i meant bios may not correctly transfer ram sizes to upper level
2009-07-24T05:51:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	 is there a way to make it transfer?
2009-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	i have no idea, that's why i told you to update bios..
2009-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	maybe your ram sticks have different speeds, even though it is not supposed to be a problem.. you neve know
2009-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	i've tried updating it multiple times... and the different speeds could be a problem... hadn't thought of that
2009-07-24T05:54:00.000Z	pelmen	dameon	that's also why i told you to remove the first, original stick, as I guess that one is old
2009-07-24T05:55:00.000Z	dameon	pelmen	yup.... I'll work on that.  I've got to go, but thanks for the help.
