2005-12-26T14:22:00.000Z	woz		i think i've assigned my computer at least 10 ip's on the same interface on an internal network... is that bad?
2005-12-26T14:22:00.000Z	woz		and how do I get one of those ip's to show up in ifconfig?
2005-12-26T14:24:00.000Z	woz		(i'm used to gentoo where i would generally use whichever kernel version i like)
2005-12-26T14:24:00.000Z	redhook	woz	thats what I use on my laptop
2005-12-26T14:25:00.000Z	redhook	woz	and you can compile your own kernel on any linux distro
2005-12-26T14:25:00.000Z	woz	redhook	yeah
2005-12-26T14:26:00.000Z	redhook	woz	what do you need to know?
2005-12-26T14:26:00.000Z	woz	redhook	trying to connect to a device over usb by using a driver that makes it look like a network device
2005-12-26T14:27:00.000Z	redhook	woz	that makes no sense at all
2005-12-26T14:27:00.000Z	woz	redhook	sorry?
2005-12-26T14:27:00.000Z	redhook	woz	should just pop up as a usb drive or device
2005-12-26T14:27:00.000Z	redhook	woz	what is the device?
2005-12-26T14:30:00.000Z	redhook	woz	you might just be missing the ethernet over usb module
2005-12-26T14:33:00.000Z	redhook	woz	the faq says "    When plugged into a Windows XP host computer, an X server is automatically launched. This X server is configured to allow clients running on BlackDog to connect, thus allowing for access to the keyboard, video, and mouse functions. A similar process happens for Linux/x86, but requires some manual configuration for the USB device.
2005-12-26T14:34:00.000Z	redhook	woz	personally I wouldnt have bought that device since it lacks ethernet
2005-12-26T14:39:00.000Z	woz	redhook	yeah... but it works on the same princible
2005-12-26T14:39:00.000Z	redhook	woz	that device is junkware btw
2005-12-26T14:40:00.000Z	redhook	woz	no server should be without ethernet
2005-12-26T14:40:00.000Z	woz	redhook	it's not a server in that sense though
2005-12-26T14:40:00.000Z	redhook	woz	then what is it, a gimped out pda?
2005-12-26T14:41:00.000Z	woz	redhook	yeah i guess you could call it that
2005-12-26T14:41:00.000Z	woz	redhook	honestly, my dad kept badgering me to give him a birthday list, so i told him i wanted one of these to play around with
