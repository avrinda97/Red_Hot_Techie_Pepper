2011-07-09T08:13:00.000Z	Fordius		what can be the reason that I can't connect to 127.0.0.1:16001 ?
2011-07-09T08:15:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	maybe you don't have a service running on port 16001?
2011-07-09T08:19:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	drop into the command line and try "telnet 127.0.0.1 16001"
2011-07-09T08:20:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	while you are on the command line do "netstat -tulanp | grep 16001"
2011-07-09T08:22:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	what about the netstat command, anything returned?
2011-07-09T08:24:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	what about the command "netstat -tulanp | 16001"
2011-07-09T08:25:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	copy and paste that command
2011-07-09T08:25:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	sorry "netstat -tulanp | grep 16001"
2011-07-09T08:25:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	it's late :)
2011-07-09T08:26:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	what does "netstat -tulanp | grep 16001" return?
2011-07-09T08:27:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	then you don't have anything running on that port
2011-07-09T08:27:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	I have no idea what service you are trying to run
2011-07-09T08:28:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	I don't read dutch
2011-07-09T08:29:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	no
2011-07-09T08:29:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	nothing to do with a static IP. Believe me, 127.0.0.1 is as static as it gets
2011-07-09T08:29:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	whatever script ytou are running is not starting a service on that port
2011-07-09T08:30:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	I don't know what to tell you
2011-07-09T08:31:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	how did you run the "autostart script"?
2011-07-09T08:31:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	was this a script you downloaded?
2011-07-09T08:33:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	I'd ask on the cccamforum if I was you
2011-07-09T08:33:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	since that seems like what you are trying to get going
2011-07-09T08:36:00.000Z	DevilSun	Fordius	yes. Because then you aren't root
