2006-02-27T07:32:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	redirect std_error
2006-02-27T07:32:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	got it or do you want more info?
2006-02-27T07:33:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	not realy.. can you explain a bit more please?
2006-02-27T07:33:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	sure: you have stdout and stderr, two streams on used for normal output, on for errormessages
2006-02-27T07:34:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	with ./program > file you direct all "normal" iutput to file
2006-02-27T07:34:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	with ./program 2> file2 you direct all error output to file2
2006-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	ah oh so if i type like <command> > result.txt 2> errors.txt it will print its results in result.txt and if an error accure it will be printed in errors.txt?
2006-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	thanks a lot mate
2006-02-27T07:36:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	oh of course assuming that the program only prints errormessages on stderr
2006-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	dose >&1 mean print it on the screen? lite stdout?
2006-02-27T07:45:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	no, it actually means redirect (in oyur case stdout) to stdout
2006-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	so if i want a result to be written out to both a file and on the screen(stdout?) i cant use <command> >file >&1 ?
2006-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	no, you need 'tee' for that
2006-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	but I don't know how to use it, just that it is there
2006-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	what is tree really? i tought it was a commmand just for listing of files and folders in a "tree way"?
2006-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	'T E E'
2006-02-27T07:48:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	oh.. my bad =) whell what dose <command> > file 2> &1    mean then?
2006-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	i was tinking that i write the output of the command in the file and then the errors on the screen(stdout)?
2006-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	I think your command is right for what you want to do
2006-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	giftnudel	ZyntaxError	but test it ...
2006-02-27T07:56:00.000Z	ZyntaxError	giftnudel	i did but i tested it whit who > file >&1   ant tought it should print the users both to the file and on the screen but it didnt.. =S
