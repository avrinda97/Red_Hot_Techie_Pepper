2005-07-14T12:05:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		configure: error: zlib needed <-- what do I install to fix this error
2005-07-14T12:06:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev most likely
2005-07-14T12:07:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	i'm almost positive you have zlib1g installed but you probably are missing the development files from zlib1g-dev
2005-07-14T12:08:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	jasoncohen	that would be it - thank you
2005-07-14T12:09:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	zlib1g is an essential library. if you tried to remove it ubuntu would warn you of grave danger ahead :)
2005-07-14T12:32:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	apt-get install linux-image-`uname -r`
2005-07-14T12:32:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	ignore that, heh
2005-07-14T12:33:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	jasoncohen	thanks
2005-07-14T12:54:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	jasoncohen	that is what I want - to start in console mode and start gnome manually
2005-07-14T12:54:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	rcconf controls what services are started on boot
2005-07-14T12:54:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	just disable gdm
2005-07-14T12:55:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	sudo apt-get install rcconf
2005-07-14T12:55:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	sudo rcconf (uncheck gdm) , OK
2005-07-14T12:55:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	jasoncohen	NICE - thanks
2005-07-14T12:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	you know you can install a very light ubuntu by typing server at the install prompt
2005-07-14T12:57:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	it'll only install ubuntu-base and not ubuntu-desktop. basically you'll have the basics- no X, gnome etc.
2005-07-14T12:57:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	jasoncohen	ill give that a shot on my server box
2005-07-28T16:25:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	what's the problem? did you follow the guide on mythtv.org
2005-07-28T16:25:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	jasoncohen	yeah I did
2005-07-28T16:25:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	i just helped someone setup mythtv on ubuntu last night. i've been using mythtv for quite a while
2005-07-28T16:25:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	so, what's the problem?
2005-07-28T16:26:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ColonelKernel	mythtv is not for watching tv. it's a full blown PVR app + more
