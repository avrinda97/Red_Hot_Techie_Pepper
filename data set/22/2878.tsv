2009-04-23T17:06:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	zcat /proc/config.gz | grep EXT4
2009-04-23T17:07:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	I haven't this config....
2009-04-23T17:07:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	if you want help, be specific
2009-04-23T17:08:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	I created a ext4 partition under ubuntu 8.10 but I can't mount it.. -> unknown filesystem type ext4
2009-04-23T17:08:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	what did the command i told you return?
2009-04-23T17:09:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	I haven't config.gz
2009-04-23T17:12:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	do you have /usr/src/linux-<kernel-version>/.config?
2009-04-23T17:13:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	yes... and there is EXT4DEV as module and EXT4DEV all yes
2009-04-23T17:14:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	did you modprobe ext4dev
2009-04-23T17:16:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	ah if I use ext4dev as fs I can mount it... but not ext4 only, whats the difference?
2009-04-23T17:17:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	your kernel still has the unstable development version. You should upgrade to a 2.6.30 kernel, and even then it's on your own risk. ext4 is pretty new
2009-04-23T17:18:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	is it easy with 8.10 to upgrade the kernel?
2009-04-23T17:19:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	upgrading a kernel isn't too hard if you know what you're doing
2009-04-23T17:20:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	you shouldn't use ect4dev for important data. if you just play around with it, don't mind upgrading the kernel
2009-04-23T17:21:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	yeah its only for a small debian for my laptop :)
2009-04-23T17:22:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	and although ext4 support is considered ready now, it's still very fresh
2009-04-23T17:22:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	I know thats why I want to test it.. and see if its really faster. :)
2009-04-23T17:23:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	or I download an 9.04 iso and make with that the ext4 and the debootstrap
2009-04-23T17:24:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	yes, you might want to do that
2009-04-23T17:25:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	I guess its better :) thanks for you help
2009-04-23T17:25:00.000Z	hbekel	abchirk	i wouldn't for a production machine
2009-04-23T17:25:00.000Z	abchirk	hbekel	yeah me too... its just a laptop for wardrivin. :)
