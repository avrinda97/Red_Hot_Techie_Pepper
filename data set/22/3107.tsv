2009-02-23T09:03:00.000Z	jhonnyboy		How can i change directory to Local Disk in the terminal?
2009-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	 cd  /path/to/"Local Disk"  #perhaps?
2009-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	I don't know how to find the local disk on ubuntu ><
2009-02-23T09:05:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	maybe you should explain yourself a bit more.   what do you mean local disk?
2009-02-23T09:06:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	when you go there.. press CTRL+L  .. you should see nautilus display the path in the navigation bar.  you use that path with cd.
2009-02-23T09:06:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	Thank you so much! That helps a lot :)
2010-06-17T22:51:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurd
2010-06-17T22:54:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	thank you. So Hurd is still in production as i can see and isn't too stable as of yet? so GNU hasn't really released a kernel yet right?
2010-06-17T22:56:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	it's stable enough for some people but not for the public at large.. but GNU is just the userland - it can work on pretty much any kernel with a good enough toolchain i.e. BSD Unix, Linux, MAC OS darwin, win32, etc each combination taking on names like GNU/FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, GNU/Win32
2010-06-17T22:57:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	gotcha! How about Ubuntu? Is it open source?
2010-06-17T22:57:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	most of it, yes.
2010-06-17T22:58:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	how can i view some of the programs source code?
2010-06-17T22:59:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	download the source packages from 1. http://packages.ubuntu.com  2.  apt-get source package_name
2010-06-17T23:01:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	what are packages? Updates or operating systems(because i see karmic and 10.04)?
2010-06-17T23:02:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	do you use linux at all? or are you just curious?
2010-06-17T23:03:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	I am currently on my ubuntu machine :p
2010-06-17T23:03:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	been using ubuntu for about 6 months now.
2010-06-17T23:03:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	and you don't know what packages are? :)
2010-06-17T23:03:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	I love linux and the open software movement. Just to know to much of how to do things. I want to learn more but don't know where to start
2010-06-17T23:04:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	no my apologies lol I'm a bit of a noob. Packages are like programs i believe
2010-06-17T23:04:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	unop	which the user can download from the spm
2010-06-17T23:05:00.000Z	unop	jhonnyboy	right. and each packages has multiple versions - the greater the version, the newer it is.  a collection of packages with particular versions is released every 6 months and is called a release which have their own version numbers (10.04) and human-friendly codenames ('Lucid Lynx')
