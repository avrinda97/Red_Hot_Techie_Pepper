2007-08-22T07:06:00.000Z	cberlo		Any idea why installation of Xubuntu on a PERC RAID SCSI controller might fail?
2007-08-22T07:07:00.000Z	cberlo		(Dell PowerEdge 2500)
2007-08-22T07:07:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	I installed 6.06 just fine on a PowerEdge 2550
2007-08-22T07:08:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	Okay.  I may fall back to 6.06 then -- perhaps the problem could be with 6.10...?  Any config tricks or oddities?
2007-08-22T07:09:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	Nah, i have 1 raid 1 for boot then a raid 5 for data, it saw em as sda and sdb right off
2007-08-22T07:09:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	I have 2 scsi backplanes in it, didn't try with just 1
2007-08-22T07:09:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	Only "catch" I've got is that I've also got IDE controller in this machine, but I set PERC to be first boot.
2007-08-22T07:11:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	Before 6.06 I always had to set up the raid 1 boot as 2 separate ext2 then make a raidtab afterwards and manually make the array
2007-08-22T07:16:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	I'm not using RAID at all on this system -- don't need to be that advanced.  :)  Think I may have messed up the partition table on the boot drive during the first install attempt, so I'm going to run through it again and see if that's the fix.  Can't find anything else that would be causing this.
2007-08-22T08:24:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	You still around?  Curious about your bios settings and if something may be holding me up here...
2007-08-22T08:25:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	Yup i'm here
2007-08-22T08:25:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	I put the PERC in SCSI mode and tried again.  Still no go.  I took out the IDE controller completely and I'm trying to install AGAIN.
2007-08-22T08:26:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	I get an odd error trying to install grub on this system:  Unknown partition table signature.
2007-08-22T08:28:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	I didn't mess much in the bios. I just set up the 2 raid arrays, 1 raid 1 which is the boot and 1 raid 5 which is the data areas. I also did disable the other SCSI controllers which aren't connected to anything. I think i may have had to put a SCSI terminator on the last drive but otherwise pretty much stock config
2007-08-22T08:29:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	thanks.  This is becoming a bigger issue than I'd hoped!
2007-08-22T08:29:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	this 2550 came with only 1 of the SCSI daughterboards, i put in another one from an old defunct 2450 but it was identical to the one in there
2007-08-22T08:32:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	what size are the drives you've got in that beast?  :)(
2007-08-22T08:34:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	On the raid 1 matched IBM Ultrastar  10K 16Gb, for the raid 5, 3(+1 spare) matched seagate Cheetah 10K 36Gb
2007-08-22T08:35:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	Did you have to do any partition size tricks to get GRUB to load properly?
2007-08-22T08:37:00.000Z	genii	cberlo	ope, not on the 6.06 server install, it saw sda as the raid 1. but previously i had to make the partitions raid autodetect types, it was not seeing them as a single unit then, and then do where modify grub for md0 and then mkraid   etc etc
2007-08-22T08:38:00.000Z	cberlo	genii	Alrighty then.  thanks again.
