2010-05-01T02:21:00.000Z	chazco		The Ubuntu 10.04 live cd is unable to boot on my PC. You get a misformed X11 splash screen followed by a message saying that an unrecoverable error occurred. Any ideas?
2010-05-01T02:22:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	What hardware? Try booting with nomodeset
2010-05-01T02:22:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- It's a self-build (mostly), nothing unusual. All of the hardware worked fine with 9.10. What does the nomodeset option do?
2010-05-01T02:23:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	What graphics?
2010-05-01T02:23:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- Something nvidia based... not too old, not too new
2010-05-01T02:23:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	Upgrade or new install?
2010-05-01T02:23:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- It would be a new Ubuntu install if I could get the CD to boot
2010-05-01T02:24:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	Do you have the closed nvidia drivers installed? Post upgrade I think some people have had to install
2010-05-01T02:24:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- Nvidia-settings on 9.10 says it's a Geforce 6200LE
2010-05-01T02:25:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	I'd reinstall the nvidia drivers - take them out, but them back?
2010-05-01T02:25:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- They're installed on the 9.10 version, but since the CD doesn't boot sucesfully I cant do anything
2010-05-01T02:25:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	What error are you getting on the CD?
2010-05-01T02:26:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- It just says an unrecoverable error occured and that i'll be dropped to a desktop... which doesnt happen.
2010-05-01T02:26:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	Curious - tried another burn of the CD?
2010-05-01T02:26:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- Nope, but the same happened on beta 2... i hoped it would be fixed by now
2010-05-01T02:27:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	Oh, more interesting
2010-05-01T02:27:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	tried the server/alternate CD?
2010-05-01T02:27:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- Not yet, connection here isn't up to downloading another CD, will have to wait
2010-05-01T02:28:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	You could try booting and trying to remove splash/quiet from the boot line and see if there is any smoking gun
2010-05-01T02:28:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- WIll have a go at tweaking the options but i've got the feeling this release has pushed it over the edge... one regression too many
2010-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	penguin42	chazco	The biggest change on this version is the plymouth boot stuff and also KMS kernel mode switching; booting with nomodeset will stop the second I think
2010-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	chazco	penguin42	- Got to go, thanks for the help. :)
