2009-07-12T14:06:00.000Z	Rebeka		ok, sorry folks ;)
2009-07-12T14:07:00.000Z	Rebeka		ok,I figured a workaround, but I'm not that smart, so I need some more help...
2009-07-12T14:08:00.000Z	Rebeka		OK: So the box needs a potential for 'net connect,
2009-07-12T14:10:00.000Z	Rebeka		but when the box boots, it pops up a box which says "Enter password for default ..."  what's up wih that?  I though I got it to just boot?
2009-07-12T14:12:00.000Z	Rebeka		yeah, I know that, but I need it to run without one!  It's just sitting there, and I need it to work,
2009-07-12T14:12:00.000Z	Rebeka		GDM?
2009-07-12T14:13:00.000Z	Rebeka		Look, I need ubuntu to just open and run, without a PW, without any BS, just run, and just work.  Can it do it?
2009-07-12T14:14:00.000Z	Rebeka		well, I just need it to open and run, with no problems, with no PW, just open and start.  It's running on out lab's Dell Vostro, which normally runs Linux with 0 problems
2009-07-12T14:15:00.000Z	Rebeka		Yarg, if our crap win box can start and run, and Ubuntu can't, I'm not sold, this is garbage,
2009-07-12T14:17:00.000Z	Rebeka		Har.  Yeah, that's right, if Linux can't meet the needs of a modern lab, then obviously I'm the problem.
2009-07-12T14:17:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	One question. What IS your problem?
2009-07-12T14:18:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	Where exactly does it stop?
2009-07-12T14:21:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	If it asks for your keyring password, go to Seahorse and change the password to a blank one. (Might work, or not.)
2009-07-12T14:23:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	On Windows, auto-login is performed by using a stored password, so the password can be used to decrypt private keys. On Linux with GDM, auto-login is done by simply changing to the wanted user ID, so there's no known password that could be used for unlocking the rest.
2009-07-12T14:25:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	For default *what*? Give the *full* message.
2009-07-12T14:34:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	I already told you, remove the password from the keyring !@$
2009-07-12T14:35:00.000Z	Rebeka	grawity	sorry, how would one do such a thing?
2009-07-12T14:35:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	Go to the password manager (Seahorse).
2009-07-12T14:36:00.000Z	Rebeka	grawity	Forgive my ignorance, but where is Seahorse?
2009-07-12T14:36:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	Accessories -> Password Manager, probably.
2009-07-12T14:38:00.000Z	Rebeka	grawity	I cannot see such a thing in 9.04.  App>Accs>Password and Encryption Keys ... just brings up a window
2009-07-12T14:39:00.000Z	grawity	Rebeka	Yeah, that's Seahorse -- go to the last tab, it should show one keyring "login"
