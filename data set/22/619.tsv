2011-06-18T17:17:00.000Z	wols	metadan	you create 4 partitions, all primary ones so now your partition table is full
2011-06-18T17:17:00.000Z	wols	metadan	you need to move one ntfs partition (usually sda4) to an extended partition and also the unallocated space. then you can create ubuntu partitions inside there
2011-06-18T17:18:00.000Z	wols	metadan	how big is your drive?
2011-06-18T17:19:00.000Z	wols	metadan	then yes there is unallocated space. in windows too.
2011-06-18T17:19:00.000Z	wols	metadan	just check what you have available in windows, it's a lot less than 1000 GB, is it?
2011-06-18T17:19:00.000Z	wols	metadan	run drivemgmt.msc and you will see there is unallocated space
2011-06-18T17:22:00.000Z	wols	metadan	you need to have 3 or less primary partitions to do it. as me and dr_willis already told you
2011-06-18T17:23:00.000Z	wols	metadan	please boot windows and pastebin the picture of drivemgmt.msc please
2011-06-18T17:36:00.000Z	metadan	wols	win config http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=ivaczc&s=7 I need, c,d and k
2011-06-18T17:38:00.000Z	wols	metadan	you use a dynamic disk partitions. these are non-standard and totally windows only
2011-06-18T17:39:00.000Z	metadan	wols	thanks, so how can i get round it?
2011-06-18T17:40:00.000Z	wols	metadan	see for example: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1705481
2011-06-18T17:40:00.000Z	wols	metadan	there is no way. even your windows boot partition is a dynamic disk.
2011-06-18T17:40:00.000Z	metadan	wols	thanks, i'll have a read
2011-06-18T17:42:00.000Z	wols	metadan	the first thing you always do with such a PC is: make a windows DVD to install from and nuke the whole disk and start fresh. removes all the adware manufacturers like to spam you with too
2011-06-18T17:42:00.000Z	metadan	wols	so if i have any dynamic partitions I cant work with that drive?
2011-06-18T17:43:00.000Z	wols	metadan	yes. as you saw the dynamic partitions and what ubuntu sees has almost nothing to do with each other. you will usually overwrite windows partitions then and delete data. not a good thing
2011-06-18T17:43:00.000Z	metadan	wols	ok i figured something was wrong when it didn't match
2011-06-18T17:44:00.000Z	metadan	wols	i'll look at converting them
2011-06-18T17:44:00.000Z	wols	metadan	if you are lucky, parted might be able to do it
2011-06-18T17:45:00.000Z	metadan	wols	actually bugger this, i'll buy another drive and stick it on that rather than wasting the backup time and risking the data loss
2011-06-18T17:46:00.000Z	wols	metadan	I doubt it. mine didn't
