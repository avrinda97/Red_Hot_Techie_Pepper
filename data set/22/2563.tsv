2010-07-02T06:29:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	wats that??
2010-07-02T06:29:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	open a terminal and type "printenv"
2010-07-02T06:30:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	ok
2010-07-02T06:32:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	it's taking 10 min's to install the java
2010-07-02T06:32:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	i'll run that command once the installation is done
2010-07-02T06:32:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	?
2010-07-02T06:32:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	oh, I see
2010-07-02T06:33:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	what do you want to do, check for environment variables, or edit the registry, or something else?
2010-07-02T06:34:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	usually in windows this is compuslory to set the environment so that we can execute the code in a particular directory....is there something like that in ubuntu....
2010-07-02T06:34:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	for a batch script?
2010-07-02T06:35:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	i dont know wats a batch script....this is usually done right after installation.. so that we can compile and execute the java program....is anything like that required here
2010-07-02T06:36:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	afaik no, I don't think you have to do anything
2010-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	I'm probably not the right person tho; I'm not exactly sure :/
2010-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	bazhang, so after installation i can right away compile and run my java programs
2010-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	aurilliance	thank you very much for the help
2010-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	aurilliance	PerryArmstrong	it should be fine (it was for me); no problem mate
