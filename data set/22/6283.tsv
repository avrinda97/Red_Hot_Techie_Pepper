2007-03-19T13:36:00.000Z	|thunder		heres a brain stunner, what would cause my screensaver(set to blank) to use 100% of my CPU ? no distributed computing action, and beagle only takes so long to index. I can leave for 12 hrs and it still is maxxd. how?
2007-03-19T13:36:00.000Z	|thunder		riaal; yep
2007-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	hmm.. not running hardware accelerated graphics perhaps?
2007-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	hmm.. weird.. what screensaver?
2007-03-19T13:38:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	I'll give it a try and see how much cpu it uses for me
2007-03-19T13:38:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	if you have 2 boxes you could always ssh from the other one and use htop or something to see if it's really the screensaver being busy
2007-03-19T13:40:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	what screensaver are you running?
2007-03-19T13:42:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	well.. that's as not cpu intensive as it gets =)... it's not some other software doing something when the computer is idle? some indexing? something else?
2007-03-19T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	it's not some kind of sleep mode where the computer is lowering the frequency of the cpu?
2007-03-19T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	that would give you a higher load if you count percentages
2007-03-19T13:45:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	ok.. last idea then.. a broken power save module in ubuntu.. that somehow just loops around when it's supposed to calm down
2007-03-19T13:46:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	or something that took repeated snapshots of cpu acitivity.. perhaps a bash script with some top magic?
2007-03-19T13:47:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	you're welcome.. hope you solve it
2007-03-19T13:52:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	top -b will just output the process list... if I were you I'd do a "top -b -n 30 -d 1 | less", put the computer to sleep..wake it up after 10-15 secs and see what happened
2007-03-19T13:55:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	hmm... adding a -i to that top line makes it ignore idle processes.. shortens the list quite a bit
2007-03-19T14:16:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	what is beagled?
2007-03-19T14:16:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	ah.. well.. doesn't it stop some time?
2007-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	hmm.. well... sounds like it's time to find an alternative to beagle then =)...
2007-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	mm.. that might be it.. ntfs and linux still aren't very friendly
2007-03-19T14:18:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	you're welcome
2007-03-19T14:20:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	I use brasero for all my burning needs.. haven't tried burning movies with it though
2007-03-19T14:20:00.000Z	Slart	|thunder	gnomebaker should work too... not sure.. haven't used it that much
