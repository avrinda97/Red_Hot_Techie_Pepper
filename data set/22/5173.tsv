2007-07-04T10:01:00.000Z	jhaig		That might help a big - well it might mean you can fix it with a bit of a hack.
2007-07-04T10:01:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	or that does not matter?
2007-07-04T10:02:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	Do you have it set up with Ubuntu/SuSE dual boot?
2007-07-04T10:03:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	no, when i trry to install suse on mine it just does the same thing... black screen then says no signal
2007-07-04T10:03:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	it does load the kernel though... but then it goes to the black screen
2007-07-04T10:03:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	Oh, right, so it isn't installed yet?  Is there an option in the boot message (before "Loading kernel") to do a text install?
2007-07-04T10:04:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	no, theres like boot from harddrive (loads ubuntu) and there is like install suse and some other options im posative no text install though
2007-07-04T10:05:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	Silly question, maybe, but do you choose 'install' or 'boot from harddrive'?
2007-07-04T10:05:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	install
2007-07-04T10:06:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	we havent tried the ctrl +alt + f1 yet...
2007-07-04T10:06:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	whats it do?
2007-07-04T10:06:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	It should give you a text console - ie, without a graphical interface.
2007-07-04T10:06:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	Am I inteligent enough to do that? lol
2007-07-04T10:07:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	... but that was when I though you had it installed already.
2007-07-04T10:07:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	oh
2007-07-04T10:08:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	For SuSE you would do better joining the #suse channel.  I can help a bit but most people here will only be able to help with Ubuntu.
2007-07-04T10:08:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	yeah I havent even got it installed yet... I wait for my asus motherboard screen to come up the tap f8 to load from memorex cd and load the disk at my boot... then it takes me to the linux screen and I hit install and it says loading kernel and goes to black screen and says no signal
2007-07-04T10:09:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	The "No signal" is a message from the the monitor to tell you that it is not getting anything from the computer.  Basically, it means that the graphics card is not configured properly.
2007-07-04T10:10:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	oh hmmm...
2007-07-04T10:10:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	but it is installed properly... I installed all the drivers
2007-07-04T10:12:00.000Z	jhaig	quinton_	Ubuntu is generally better at automatic hardware configuration than other distributions.
2007-07-04T10:25:00.000Z	quinton_	jhaig	hey
