2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	Chotaz`		let's say I messed up really bad with the purge command, and I don't even have a terminal, how can I backup some files before freshinstalling?
2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	what did you purge?
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	can you ctrl+alt+f1 into another terminal?
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	if you can get there you can try running apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2012-11-05T01:26:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	sorry I was writting to the wrong person, thanks I wasn't even remembering that
2012-11-05T01:26:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	is there anything like an history for packages removed where I could just undo this mess?
2012-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	I've never really run into something like that, but ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that holds most of the core Desktop experience
2012-11-05T01:29:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	I've sure lost that, every windows looks win95 now, and every application I close disappears(deluge, chrome, terminal, vlc, all gone now)
2012-11-05T01:30:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	haha, that'll happen. Do you remember what you purged?
2012-11-05T01:30:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	yeah, sounds like you broke some desktop dependency with purge
2012-11-05T01:31:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	it sounds like you lost mostly GTK packages. Were you able to get into another terminal via CTRL+ALT+F1?
2012-11-05T01:31:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	i did "sudo apt-get purge wine*" and I only noticed I'd done crap when I saw terminal output "Removing google-chrome-stable"
2012-11-05T01:32:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	you should definitely give installing ubuntu-desktop a shot
2012-11-05T01:33:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	werd, good luck man. I hope you've learned your lesson about package managing while high ;P
2012-11-05T01:34:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	 all I wanted was this crappy japanese game working, windows binaries so I needed a specific wine version for it xD
2012-11-05T01:34:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	did you grab Crossover while it was free this week?
2012-11-05T01:34:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	had no idea :(
2012-11-05T01:36:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	for newer windows apps, (Skyrim, MS Office 2010) it is definitely worth it
2012-11-05T01:36:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	if the software is from before 2005, you're better off with stock WINE
2012-11-05T01:36:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	still all the games that I used to play one wine 1.2.2 dont work on the newer versions of wine
2012-11-05T01:38:00.000Z	twirm	Chotaz`	do you know if you're running 64/32?
2012-11-05T01:38:00.000Z	Chotaz`	twirm	64bits
