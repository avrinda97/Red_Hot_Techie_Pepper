2012-09-10T17:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 what video card?
2012-09-10T17:53:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	how do I check?
2012-09-10T17:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 lspci to see card info
2012-09-10T17:54:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	http://pastebin.com/TNttw90T is the output
2012-09-10T17:58:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	I believe it's intel then? I didnt realize they were a chip card maker, as opposed to nvivia/ati
2012-09-10T17:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 intel is the #3 video chip company  would be my guess.
2012-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	fair enough, wish I knew more about the market ;-). What do I do from here, having an intel card?
2012-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 the normal gnome  monitors/display tools should let you configure things
2012-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	I'm installing up from ubuntu minimal, trying to avoid using Gnome.
2012-09-10T18:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 no idea then. i dont configure xorg.conf by hand anymore
2012-09-10T18:03:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	possible to configure via the gnome tools then be rid of them?
2012-09-10T18:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 you need a proper xorg.conf i imagine
2012-09-10T18:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 why so gnome-phobic
2012-09-10T18:05:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	well, mainly want to squeeze as much juice out of this laptop as I can. Do a ton of development work, don't know Gnome3 or Unity, when I need GUI openbox has worked fine. Noticed before my recent wipe that Gnome utilities were running even when the session wasn't called (nor was gdm insalled)
2012-09-10T18:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 if the desktop is not running.. its not using power
2012-09-10T18:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 some services may be.. but theres text mode if you want.
2012-09-10T18:09:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	my worry isn't the battery drain (battery sucks anyway, just leave it plugged in). I had over 3/4 of my 4 GB of RAM used in mainly keeping Gnome services running
2012-09-10T18:09:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	dont remember which services exactly
2012-09-10T18:10:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	fair enough. But at present, I have two things left to successfully setup--dual monitors and wireless card. Then I'll have the system right as I like it
2012-09-10T18:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	econdudeawesome	 you could boot a live ubuntu cd. configure things, check the xorg.conf and copy it over..... ;)
2012-09-10T18:11:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	hah! :D Fair enough. The config for the file doesn't look too bad, but if I can't get it to work I might just do that
2012-09-10T19:07:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	dr_willis	Figured it out. Use xrandr commands at openbox autostart to get everything configured properly
