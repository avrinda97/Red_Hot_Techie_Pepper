2006-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	grigora		anyone?
2006-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	I haven't seen that one.
2006-09-03T11:31:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	you tried running the upgrade again?  Assuming you can get to the point of retrying.
2006-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	grigora	sethk	yes, i also did apt-get -f install, but still no go
2006-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	try uninstalling the app (the one it says "but is needed by" or "is used by" in the error)
2006-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	paste that line again, I forgot the exact error.
2006-09-03T11:34:00.000Z	grigora	sethk	it's trying to install ubuntu-base, but I just checked a working system and it's not there
2006-09-03T11:34:00.000Z	grigora	sethk	 trying to overwrite `/usr/bin/ofx2qif', which is also in package libofx0c102
2006-09-03T11:35:00.000Z	grigora	sethk	there ya go
2006-09-03T11:35:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	try doing the automatic repair of the package data.  do you know how to do that?
2006-09-03T11:35:00.000Z	grigora	sethk	not really
2006-09-03T11:35:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	I'm thinking that if you force an uninstall of libofx0c102, it will stop saying that you are trying to overwrite something that you need.
2006-09-03T11:35:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	synaptic has it on the menus.
2006-09-03T11:36:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	it can't hurt, so it's a good thing to try.
2006-09-03T11:36:00.000Z	grigora	sethk	thanks, let me give it a shot
2006-09-03T11:36:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	k
2006-09-03T11:37:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	it's worth a shot, although I wouldn't give you any odds on it working.
2006-09-03T11:37:00.000Z	grigora	sethk	can't do, show the followiThe following packages have unmet dependencies:
2006-09-03T11:59:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	sounds like you are making some progress.
2006-09-03T11:59:00.000Z	sethk	grigora	backporting to 2.3.2.ds1-20ubuntu15 might work
