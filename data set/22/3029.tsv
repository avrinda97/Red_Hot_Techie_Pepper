2009-02-04T21:48:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		everning.  Can anyone help with inability to print to cups server from open office?
2009-02-04T21:49:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		I connect fine and set my default printer but open office doesn't see the cups networked printer
2009-02-04T21:50:00.000Z	wolter	Azazel-AZ	go under System > Administration > Printing
2009-02-04T21:50:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		I did this, even printed a test page, but printer does not show up under open office
2009-02-04T21:50:00.000Z	wolter	Azazel-AZ	hm..
2009-02-04T21:50:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		the samba ones do show, but not the non local cups ones
2009-02-04T21:52:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		Can anyone help me figure out what it wrong with this command, I want to see if this is a work around
2009-02-04T21:52:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		ssh -L 631:localhost:631 vincent@abaddon
2009-02-04T21:55:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		ssh -NL 631:localhost:631 vincent@abaddon; Could not request local forwarding
2009-02-04T21:58:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		no name server.  hosts.conf is manually set.  192.168.55.152 abaddon abaddon.domain so it resolves fine
2009-02-04T21:59:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		ssh -L 631:localhost:631 me@abaddon works but I don't see printers under system --> admin --> printers when I connect to localhost
2009-02-04T22:02:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		bad local specificiation 'localhost:631'  I'm confident the format is local_port:local_ip:remote_port user_name@remote_ip
2009-02-04T22:03:00.000Z	wolter		can somebody help me with the drivers for "Epson Stylus Photo R200"? I don't find any.
2009-02-04T22:04:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		http://staff.washington.edu/corey/fw/ssh-port-forwarding.html ok, I did this ugh..
2009-02-04T22:06:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		ok ssh -L 632:localhost:631 me@remote does work and I can connect, but open office is only looking at 631 on localhost :(  the cups server on localhost is conflicting with the attempted capture and forwarding on 631
2009-02-04T22:08:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		theory confirmed.  sudo pkill cups; sudo ssh -L 631:localhost:631 me@remote and now open office see the printer :(
2009-02-04T22:08:00.000Z	wolter		i plugged my printer and everything was automatically detected, then, after reinstalling cups, i plug it and i get to choose the drivers manually, which do not exist. is there some package i need to install?
2009-02-04T22:09:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ	wolter	hp printer?
2009-02-04T22:09:00.000Z	wolter	Azazel-AZ	epson stylus photo r200 (there are only drivers for photo 750, but there used to be for my printer.
2009-02-04T22:10:00.000Z	Azazel-AZ		yeah, I intentionally bought HP this time.  http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/hplip as hp maintains a commerical drive for linux.  Sorry, can't help with the epson
2009-02-04T22:12:00.000Z	wolter	Azazel-AZ	its fixed now, I just had to install the cups-drivers-guttenprint or something like that
