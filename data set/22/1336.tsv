2012-07-13T21:17:00.000Z	Fanshawe		Hell again. I'm trying to clear out /var/lib/dpkg/info, but I'm getting back an error, 'argument list too long'.
2012-07-13T21:17:00.000Z	Fanshawe		or rather, 'sudo: unable to execute /usr/bin/apt-get: Argument list too long'
2012-07-13T21:19:00.000Z	Fanshawe		Sure, yes. Earlier I was struggling with space on my filesystem. Originally there was a problem with a 'xapian' directory eating too much memory.
2012-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	Fanshawe		Now I'm looking to clear out more, as I've only managed to get about 15mb to myself.
2012-07-13T21:21:00.000Z	Fanshawe		The reason I'm looking to clear out /var/lib/dpkg/info is that it's currently taking up the most space, by the way.
2012-07-13T21:22:00.000Z	Fanshawe		I have, and it seems to make no difference.
2012-07-13T21:23:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	How much space is it using then?
2012-07-13T21:24:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	Thats not much at all.
2012-07-13T21:25:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	Define "so much more" please. How much more?
2012-07-13T21:27:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	Define "tiny" please.
2012-07-13T21:30:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	It will prevent using space for logging.
2012-07-13T21:33:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	Use this one: du -h --max-depth=1 /var/
2012-07-13T21:36:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	I just told you one :)
2012-07-13T21:36:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	Just use it, and provide the output please.

2012-07-13T21:40:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	194M for /var looks pretty good.
2012-07-13T21:41:00.000Z	Fanshawe	bekks	So is there no way I can decrease the amount of space it uses? Even just using regular programs causes me to tip over the edge.
2012-07-13T21:57:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	If you think you are wasting too much space, use the command I gave you on / instead of /var/
2012-07-13T22:02:00.000Z	Fanshawe	bekks	could I have that command again, please?
2012-07-13T22:02:00.000Z	bekks	Fanshawe	sudo du -h --max-depth=1 /
