2008-08-18T05:19:00.000Z	piko_water		i have .mkv format video trying to play but no sound and no pic
2008-08-18T05:19:00.000Z	piko_water		does anybody know which player to play with .mkv
2008-08-18T05:20:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	I use mplayer to see mkv files
2008-08-18T05:21:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	well its giving me error when i am tryiing to open with mplayer
2008-08-18T05:21:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	what's the error?
2008-08-18T05:22:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	use pastebin
2008-08-18T05:22:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	oh well manage to play with codine but movie is playing so slow and no sound
2008-08-18T05:25:00.000Z	carandraug		piko_water:if you can play with other software, that means the problem's not in the file. But mplayer shouldn't give a problem. I use that a format almost all days and never had a problem. Have you ever managed to see a mkv file in mplayer before?
2008-08-18T05:26:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	no i never manage to
2008-08-18T05:27:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	or you can tell me to convert mkv into some other format like .iso or something else that will be great
2008-08-18T05:27:00.000Z	piko_water		is it possible to convert mkv into iso
2008-08-18T05:29:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	I don't know about converting the files. Could you try to open the file with mplayer and give me the error through pastebin?
2008-08-18T05:30:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	now i am getting no error, i play with mplayer and it just opened blank screen, movie not playing just still there
2008-08-18T05:31:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	could you give me the output of the terminal?
2008-08-18T05:33:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	"error initalizing " the selected video_out  (-vo) device  and then second error is " could not open/initalize  audio -> device no sound"
2008-08-18T05:33:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	these are the two errors i am getting right now
2008-08-18T05:35:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	can you play other video formats with maplayer? Have you tried reinstall it?
2008-08-18T05:36:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	nope i cannot play
2008-08-18T05:37:00.000Z	piko_water	carandraug	i didnt try to reinstall it but even video is not displaying
2008-08-18T05:37:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	reinstall mplayer and then smplayer (is a very good, in my opinion, skin for mplayer). I can play everything with mplayer, never have problems before and I've seen some quite strange formats
2008-08-18T05:44:00.000Z	carandraug	piko_water	I believe I know what the problem is. I think it has to do with the drivers you are choosing to play. The smplayer skin allows you to change them easily (otherwise you'll have ti use the command line), that's the reason I'm asking you to install it to
