2007-09-04T15:31:00.000Z	Hurga		Is here someone who knows something about DVD burning?
2007-09-04T15:32:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	burning in ubuntu is really easy, just write click and burn to disk
2007-09-04T15:32:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	4 GB file
2007-09-04T15:32:00.000Z	Hurga		"too large"
2007-09-04T15:33:00.000Z	Hurga		6.06 just left it out and burnt a coaster.
2007-09-04T15:33:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	i dont think its any different from CD burning, have you tried the CD/DVD creator under "Places"?
2007-09-04T15:33:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	Yes. It
2007-09-04T15:34:00.000Z	Hurga		It's about mkisofs limits.
2007-09-04T15:34:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	Is there some place to ask expert questions?
2007-09-04T15:34:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	if its too large, then that must mean its to large for the dvd... right?
2007-09-04T15:35:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	No, mkisofs limits
2007-09-04T15:35:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	4 GB fits just nice on a 4.5 GB DVD
2007-09-04T15:35:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	Read this: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-86152.html
2007-09-04T15:37:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	Well, I know that it has problems, but it SHOULD work.
2007-09-04T15:38:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	maybe making a iso would fix it
2007-09-04T15:39:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	third time, it's a mkisofs problem. a mkISOfs problem, you understand?
2007-09-04T15:40:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	sry.. some guys on that forum claimed to have a work around.
2007-09-04T15:41:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	Yes, but nothing definitive, Even worse, UDF support has been castrated to 1 GB... that one worked for me a few years ago.
2007-09-04T15:42:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	It can't really be that I have to look for a Windows user just to burn a file.
2007-09-04T15:42:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	did you try what this guy said: If you have free disk space -- make ISO-file, first. Then right-click this file and burn it to DVD.
2007-09-04T15:43:00.000Z	Hurga	boojah	mkisofs says file too large. - Is there some place to ask expert questions?
2007-09-04T15:44:00.000Z	boojah	Hurga	try #ubuntu-dev
