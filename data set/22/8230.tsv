2005-10-07T05:41:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	alright
2005-10-07T05:14:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	 rm -rf *.abc
2005-10-07T05:21:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	that command doesnt seem to work...
2005-10-07T05:22:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	do you get any error msg ?
2005-10-07T05:22:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	nothing, it just gives me the prompt but the files are still in the subdirs
2005-10-07T05:36:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	you still there ?
2005-10-07T05:38:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	yup
2005-10-07T05:38:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	did you delete the files ?
2005-10-07T05:38:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	nope :)
2005-10-07T05:38:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	be careful though
2005-10-07T05:39:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	sure sure :P ill test it first :)
2005-10-07T05:39:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	 execute this from the directory in which are all the files+subdirectories with files
2005-10-07T05:40:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	run this first WITHOUT "-delete" option
2005-10-07T05:40:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	find ./ -type f -name '*.abc' -delete
2005-10-07T05:44:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	-delete doesnt exist i think :)
2005-10-07T05:44:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	 it does
2005-10-07T05:44:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	find: invalid predicate `-delete
2005-10-07T05:45:00.000Z	Entranced	shinu	mr_roboto I'm running Breezy and the command I pasted worked just fine here
2005-10-07T05:45:00.000Z	shinu	Entranced	im on hoary and it doesnt work :)
