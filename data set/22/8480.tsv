2005-12-25T10:22:00.000Z	shinu		why do i keep getting :File size limit exceeded when copying files?
2005-12-25T10:23:00.000Z	shinu		even when its as root. is it maybe because of the windows xp machine on the other end?
2005-12-25T10:23:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	are the files greater than 2gb and are you trying to copy over smb?
2005-12-25T10:23:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	i dont think any of those files are 2gb...
2005-12-25T10:44:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	GLOBIGNORE="filename" mv * /some/path
2005-12-25T10:45:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	ok thanks a lot
2005-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	or mv !(filename)
2005-12-25T10:48:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	do both methods work with cp as well?
2005-12-25T10:49:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	they're both for bash globs, so yes
2005-12-25T10:55:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	okies, thanks
2005-12-26T09:34:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	filesystem overhead
2005-12-26T09:35:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	either that or you're measuring the size of the drive in 1000000000 byte gigabytes
2005-12-26T09:35:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	mcphail /dev/hda7 27G  1.5G   24G <- df -h output, thats what im counting with
2005-12-26T09:36:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	ah, then that's filesystem overhead.  probably reserved inodes.
2005-12-26T09:37:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	ok i see, cause it was quite a lot so i was a bit worried. do you recommend any other fs for a specifically files-only partition?
2005-12-26T09:38:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	I use reiserfs, but you're going to have fs overhead with any filesystem
2005-12-26T09:38:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	I think the default is 5%
2005-12-26T09:38:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	yeah i noticed that after the mkfs output
2005-12-26T09:39:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	though there will be less waste on a reiserfs partition
2005-12-26T09:39:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	cause i used to have a fat32 partition and didnt notice anything with that...
2005-12-26T09:40:00.000Z	trappist	shinu	it's great.  I don't use it because it's huge in terms of code and grub seems to hate it.
2005-12-26T09:41:00.000Z	shinu	trappist	ok ill stick to ext3 then, thanks :)
