2012-08-26T01:32:00.000Z	Areckx		bekks::  there has to be a way to run a simple go google.com in alt'f2...
2012-08-26T01:33:00.000Z	Areckx		bekks::  will it let me add whatever I like after the initial command? so I can do different websites than just one?
2012-08-26T01:33:00.000Z	Areckx		I just want top type go websitename.com
2012-08-26T01:34:00.000Z	Areckx		or even more ideal, just type in a website withoput a command at all... but I think I need a command
2012-08-26T01:34:00.000Z	Areckx		bekks::  how do I go about making a script like that?
2012-08-26T01:34:00.000Z	Areckx		and how do I make it so I can run it from alt-f2
2012-08-26T01:36:00.000Z	Areckx		brontosaurusrex::  I simply want to run chromium in full screen and be able to load a new website address without having to exit fullscreen
2012-08-26T01:37:00.000Z	Areckx		KatsumeBlisk::  what kind of script do I need to write? I don't know where to start, what code I need to put in
2012-08-26T01:37:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	I don't know what you're trying to do. I wasn't paying attention.
2012-08-26T01:38:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	Do you know how to do this via the command line?
2012-08-26T01:39:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	Whatever you were doing on the command line, you'd put in a file.
2012-08-26T01:40:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	Then you run chmod +x foo.sh and move it to /usr/bin
2012-08-26T01:40:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	Just put whatever you were making an alias for into a .sh file.
2012-08-26T01:40:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	foo is just a random file name that people use for examlpes.
2012-08-26T01:41:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	It's out of date though. That's why jui-feng wants a way to update it.
2012-08-26T01:42:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	No. The only package updated besides for security updates in an Ubuntu release is Firefox.
2012-08-26T01:45:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	You call the file whatever you want to say to call it.
2012-08-26T01:45:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	Save it as go, then run "chmod +x go", then move it to /usr/bin
2012-08-26T01:46:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	You'll need to use sudo or be root to move it there.
2012-08-26T01:47:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	Glad you got it to work. :)
2012-08-26T01:49:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	They are fun. You might be able to use variables and whatever URL that Google uses to search.
2012-08-26T01:50:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	Areckx	True.
