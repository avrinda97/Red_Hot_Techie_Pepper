2007-01-28T17:17:00.000Z	yoshig3		does anyone know how to install the nvidia legacy drivers?
2007-01-28T17:17:00.000Z	yoshig3		I can't find it
2007-01-28T17:18:00.000Z	yoshig3		I searched the wiki, only to come up with crazy charactered pages
2007-01-28T17:18:00.000Z	yoshig3		I just need the linux terminal commands to install the nvidia legacy drivers and how to uninstall the previous nvidia drivers
2007-01-28T17:18:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	google for "ubuntu nvidia legacy howto"
2007-01-28T06:14:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	/var/log/X.log iirc
2007-01-28T06:15:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	take a look in /var/log.. its Xorg.log.0 or something.. (not using x myself atm)
2007-01-28T06:17:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	as i said, look in /var/log for yoru self
2007-01-28T06:19:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	this is the line that tells you whats going on: (EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)
2007-01-28T06:20:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	looks liek you don't have the driver correctly installed
2007-01-28T06:20:00.000Z	yoshig3	variant	I used the xorg setup
2007-01-28T06:20:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	what card is this? perhaps you need legacy drivers?
2007-01-28T06:21:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the line that reads "driver = "nvidia"" to "driver =  "vga"
2007-01-28T06:22:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	please pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2007-01-28T06:22:00.000Z	yoshig3	variant	alright:
2007-01-28T06:24:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	as Chousuke says, uninstallt he nvidia drivers
2007-01-28T06:24:00.000Z	yoshig3	variant	how do I do that/
2007-01-28T06:25:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	apt-get remove nvidia-driver
2007-01-28T06:25:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	you need to have registered your nick on freenode to pm people..
2007-01-28T06:40:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	glxgears is a benchmarking tool..
2007-01-28T06:41:00.000Z	variant	yoshig3	you should use aiglx not xgl on that.. and yes, it will work but will be kinda slow
