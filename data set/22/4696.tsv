2008-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	insta		hey guys, i'm looking for suggestions on an FTP server that i can have running in under 3 minutes, need anonymous read access, don't care much about permissions since it's on a trusted network
2008-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	insta	 i'd sugguest PureFTPD
2008-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		or...
2008-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		vsftpd
2008-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	insta	 ProFTPD is probably going to be your "quickest" bet,.
2008-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	insta	tcpdumpgod	that's what i went with
2008-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	insta		i don't need more auth options
2008-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	insta		i need "make server start now"
2008-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	insta	 ProFTPD?
2008-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	insta	 you need to start the service is what you're saying
2008-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		OR you need a FTPd you can have up and running QUICK.
2008-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		?
2008-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	insta		i need an ftp service i can have running quickly
2008-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	insta		i don't need it to be running tomororw
2008-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	insta	 are you using ubuntu?
2008-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		If so, use proftpd.
2008-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	insta		k, i did
2008-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		The user accounts on the Ubuntu box are the logins for the FTPd.
2008-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		like, if you have your account set up as insta , your username and pass is what you log into ubuntu with.
2008-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	insta	tcpdumpgod	thanks, it's up and running
2008-01-01T09:02:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		Sure thing insta, make sure you disable anonymous in /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf or wherever it may lie.
2008-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	insta	tcpdumpgod	like i said, i dont' care about that, the ftp server is going to be running over firewire for just long enough to pull 5gb of packages off of it
