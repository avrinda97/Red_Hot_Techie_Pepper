2007-11-02T22:39:00.000Z	Le_Fou`Absent		i have rm -rf my apache folders ( was pissin me off) n now i cant apt-get install apache2 :x
2007-11-02T22:40:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	you messed with stuff in /usr manually, and now you expect APT to work?
2007-11-02T22:40:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	so why didn't you just do "sudo apt-get remove apache2"?
2007-11-02T22:41:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	that doesn't mean it didn't remove it. anyway, *what stuff* exactly have you "rm"ed?
2007-11-02T22:43:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	nothing else? just /etc/apache2 and /usr/lib/apache2 ?
2007-11-02T22:44:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	hold on a moment, i'll try to find out which packages may keep files in there
2007-11-02T22:46:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	please type the command at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/43035/plain/ and paste the output into the pastebin
2007-11-02T22:52:00.000Z	Le_Fou`Absent	LjL	here's the link : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/43037/
2007-11-02T22:54:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	you aren't on Gutsy?
2007-11-02T22:56:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	that's a problem, since i'm on Gutsy. what are you on?
2007-11-02T22:58:00.000Z	Le_Fou`Absent	LjL	6.06 lts server edition
2007-11-02T23:01:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	then use this command http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/43038/ and give me the output again
2007-11-02T23:03:00.000Z	Le_Fou`Absent	LjL	i cant see all the output coz its too long.even if i use shit page up
2007-11-02T23:04:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	add « | pastebinit -b http://pastebin.com » to the end of that command
2007-11-02T23:05:00.000Z	Le_Fou`Absent	LjL	pastebinit is not installed and i cant apt-get it :/
2007-11-02T23:05:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	oh, perhaps it isn't available in Dapper. then just add « | grep -B 1 "Installed:" » to the end of the command, it should make the output much shorter
2007-11-02T23:09:00.000Z	Le_Fou`Absent	LjL	: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/43040/
2007-11-02T23:12:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	type: sudo apt-get --reinstall install apache2-common libapache2-mod-php5
2007-11-02T23:12:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	and then: sudo apt-get --reinstall install apache2
2007-11-02T23:14:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	i VERY STRONGLY suggest that you NEVER touch anything in /usr manually again. APT expects it to be its own realm, and all kind of bad things may happen if you don't respect that. everything that is installed in /usr by APT can be *removed* by APT.
2007-11-02T23:15:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	try just typing it again
2007-11-02T23:17:00.000Z	LjL	Le_Fou`Absent	is it still giving you the error even when you try it again?
