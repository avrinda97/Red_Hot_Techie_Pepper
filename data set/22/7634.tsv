2008-02-04T17:36:00.000Z	paladin_		Hi, I try to mount a partition and since a weed all i get s mount: special device /dev/hda2 does not exist
2008-02-04T17:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	ide devices are now called sda
2008-02-04T17:39:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: there is no /dev/sd* file... beside the /dev/hda1 is mounting perfectly
2008-02-04T17:39:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	which release?
2008-02-04T17:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	dapper or..?
2008-02-04T17:41:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: gutsy
2008-02-04T17:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	not the kind of thing that usually gives trouble - does 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda' show the partition?
2008-02-04T17:45:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: yes, fdisk shows them both
2008-02-04T17:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	and nothing funky going on here?
2008-02-04T17:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	I'm assuming /dev/hda2 won't mount?
2008-02-04T17:51:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: yes, fdisk shows them both
2008-02-04T17:53:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	does it mount?
2008-02-04T17:54:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: no, it says the device doesn't exist
2008-02-04T17:55:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	ls -l /dev/hda[12]
2008-02-04T17:55:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: only hda1 is seen
2008-02-04T17:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	what kind of file system on hda2 ?
2008-02-04T17:58:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: fat32
2008-02-04T17:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	how big is hda1 ?
2008-02-04T18:00:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: about 150 GB but that's not the problem.. until 2 weeks ago i could mount hda2 normally
2008-02-04T18:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paladin_	you have LBA enabled in the bios?
2008-02-04T18:05:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: i don't know, but I haven't changed the BIOS recently
2008-02-04T18:10:00.000Z	paladin_	Frogzoo	: did you reply anything? I can't scroll back
