2006-03-25T13:17:00.000Z	intelikey	dli__	there are a thousand apps that wont run unless they can set permissions or at least verify them.
2006-03-25T13:18:00.000Z	intelikey	dli__	also  can you makd device nodes on vfat ?
2006-03-25T13:18:00.000Z	dli__	intelikey	does the installation cd allow using reiserfs, jfs, or xfs? I didn't install this box myself
2006-03-25T13:19:00.000Z	dli__	intelikey	oh, I don't like ext3 :) but got to use it now
2006-03-25T13:20:00.000Z	dli__	intelikey	you got to try reiser4
2006-03-25T13:38:00.000Z	intelikey	dli__	you and i use root.  it is how ever not ubuntu official policy,  this is the official ubuntu help channel.   so 'we' should conform to official policy and if one asks how to enable root just tell them it is not recommended but this is how.   and leave it there,  and the "staff" should refrain form scare tatics and other deceptive ways to inforce policy.
