2006-01-21T16:44:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	what?
2006-01-21T16:45:00.000Z	JoshRA	mwe	why would it break things? i do not understand
2006-01-21T16:45:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	because ubuntu design is broken

2006-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	JoshRA		eh mwe that sucks
2006-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	ubuntu doesn't have gecko as a seperate package. so updating the firefox package would mean updating gecko. thus things that depend on gecko from ff 1.0.7 would break with gecko from ff 1.5. that's more than 50 apps
2006-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	JoshRA		thanks for your help
2006-01-21T16:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	however just installing it manually works fine
2006-01-21T16:49:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	that keeps the old gecko around
2006-01-21T16:51:00.000Z	JoshRA	mwe	thanks i installed it as such and uit works fine.
2006-01-21T16:51:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	however things would also get easier if firefox developers actually started thinking
2006-01-21T16:51:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	not changing the api all the time
2006-01-21T16:52:00.000Z	JoshRA	mwe	that is true but i don't care atm i had the fun of upgradeing badger to brezzy
2006-01-21T16:52:00.000Z	JoshRA	mwe	that is aver 1100 packages (if you have kubuntu)
2006-01-21T16:52:00.000Z	JoshRA		over*
2006-01-21T16:52:00.000Z	mwe	JoshRA	heh
