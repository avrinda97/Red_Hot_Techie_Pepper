2008-04-03T08:05:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		that might be a good start.
2008-04-03T08:05:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		unless you are experienced with changing window managers, I wouldn't recommend my half-witted technique
2008-04-03T08:06:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		no problem - sorry I couldn't be more helpful
2008-04-03T08:07:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		well...what do you like, sweetsinse?  Minimalist, decorated, light, heavy...etc
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	sweetsinse	DariusTheoNoir	i just want ability to highlight multiple icons
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		ah...ctrl click
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	sweetsinse	DariusTheoNoir	uhhh drag highlighting?
2008-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	sweetsinse		i cant think of a good word to describe it
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir	sweetsinse	which window manager do you use currently?
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	sweetsinse	DariusTheoNoir	like what you do in thunar... you cant select more than one thing by abitrarily clicking a point and dragging
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	sweetsinse		i have compiz
2008-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	sweetsinse		and emerald
2008-04-03T08:10:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		oh...nice...the last time I installed compiz, it kept me from moving windows around and changing focus
2008-04-03T08:11:00.000Z	sweetsinse	DariusTheoNoir	yeah i had similar problems for awhile
2008-04-03T08:11:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		correct me if I am wrong, but I thought compiz and emerald were window decorators and effects--not strictly window managers.  (what I mean is KDE, Gnome, ion, fvwm, windowmaker...etc)
2008-04-03T08:12:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		oh...and xfce
2008-04-03T08:12:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		right
2008-04-03T08:12:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		compositor...
2008-04-03T08:12:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		but you've got some kind of backend...right?
2008-04-03T08:13:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		thanks unop
2008-04-03T08:13:00.000Z	DariusTheoNoir		all I know is that it doesn't work for me...
2008-04-03T08:13:00.000Z	sweetsinse	DariusTheoNoir	what i need isnt even a WM.. that is compiz.  in xfce xfdesktop controls the background and the icons/behaviour of the "desktop".  in  gnome nautilus perfoms this function.  i want an app thats neither but both
