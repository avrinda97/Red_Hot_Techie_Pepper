2006-04-06T10:18:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT		any one else? "how do i run EnemyTerritory on 64bit breezy?"
2006-04-06T10:19:00.000Z	healot	ThE-LiGhT	using "linux32"
2006-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	that i know.. i want other solution//
2006-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	healot	ThE-LiGhT	recompile the game source code to x64 native? maybe
2006-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	healot	ThE-LiGhT	then stick to 32bit linux kernel :?
2006-04-06T10:24:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	what did u men by that "install "linux32" and then run the application by appending "linux32" infront of the executable" ? i won't have to format?
2006-04-06T10:25:00.000Z	healot	ThE-LiGhT	no "linux32" is the 32bit emulator (it fakes the kernel architecture to i686 32bit), and NO NEED TO FORMAT
2006-04-06T10:26:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	great thx
2006-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	healot	ThE-LiGhT	no refund for ubuntu either :)
2006-04-06T10:27:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	:P

2006-04-06T10:29:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	its already installed
2006-04-06T10:30:00.000Z	healot	ThE-LiGhT	ok, then run "linux32 <the 32bit app you want to run>"
2006-04-06T10:30:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	cool i'll try now
2006-04-06T10:31:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	still no good
2006-04-06T10:31:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	...loading libGL.so.1: Segmentation fault
2006-04-06T10:32:00.000Z	ThE-LiGhT	healot	doesn't run enemy territory
