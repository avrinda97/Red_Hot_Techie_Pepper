2010-10-27T03:40:00.000Z	anon33_		Accidentally specified 'User Defined Session' as the environment and I have auto login setup so I can't change it.
2010-10-27T03:40:00.000Z	anon33_		Can anyone please help me out?
2010-10-27T03:41:00.000Z	goltoof	anon33_	learn how to do what you need with command line :)
2010-10-27T03:42:00.000Z	anon33_	goltoof	I can't even boot into the command line. Seriously need some assistance...
2010-10-27T03:43:00.000Z	goltoof	anon33_	 what do you see now?
2010-10-27T03:44:00.000Z	anon33_	goltoof	its a black screen asking me for my password. Im able to hibernate my laptop and switch users, but im the only defined user
2010-10-27T03:44:00.000Z	goltoof	anon33_	 and when you put in your password?
2010-10-27T03:45:00.000Z	anon33_	goltoof	all I need to do is change the session environment before autologin but im unable to do that
2010-10-27T03:46:00.000Z	goltoof	anon33_	you might try reinstalling gnome   sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
