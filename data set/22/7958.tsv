2006-06-28T12:22:00.000Z	erik_		hello, I'm having a problem with my new NVidia drivers.
2006-06-28T12:23:00.000Z	erik_		I've installed the NVidia driver via Synaptic. And changed 'nv' in xorg.conf to 'nvidia'
2006-06-28T12:24:00.000Z	erik_		the driver now loads but I'm unable to switch to another terminal
2006-06-28T12:24:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	you installed "nvidia-glx" ? and whats your nvidia chip ?
2006-06-28T12:25:00.000Z	erik_		Yep, I did install nvidia-glx (NVidia Quadro NVS 120M TurboCache)
2006-06-28T12:26:00.000Z	erik_		The NVidia splash shows when X starts
2006-06-28T12:26:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	sorry, never heard about that card. i only have/had geforce2+
2006-06-28T12:26:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	ah ok
2006-06-28T12:26:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	and whats the problem ?
2006-06-28T12:27:00.000Z	erik_	oskude	card should be alike. Al works in X. Problem is that when i switch to another console ctrl-alt-f1 , the screen goes blank
2006-06-28T12:28:00.000Z	erik_	oskude	So I won't get a promt. but I still can switch back to my X console
2006-06-28T12:28:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	yeah, i had that on my notebook and ati too (except my screen went smoothly white, and nothing worked after that) hmm, what did i do...
2006-06-28T12:28:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	whats your screen resolution and bit depth in x window ?
2006-06-28T12:29:00.000Z	erik_	oskude	1920x1200
2006-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	and 24bit colors ?
2006-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	erik_	oskude	right
2006-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	then you could try to add "vga=791" to boot options
2006-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	erik_	oskude	where do i put that?
2006-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	im not sure if thats the solution, but i have it so atm
2006-06-28T12:31:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	in /boot/grub/menu.lst at the end of "kernel" line
2006-06-28T12:31:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	or you can allso ad it "temporarly" at boot time
2006-06-28T12:32:00.000Z	oskude	erik_	in grub (at boot) select the entry you want to boot, press "e" and select the line with "kernel" and add "vga=791" to the end, then press "b" to boot it
