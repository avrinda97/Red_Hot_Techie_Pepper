2004-10-28T09:01:00.000Z	baHam		hey I can hear only 1 program that is using sound ..if i use xmms i cant hear ubuntu sounds.. what to do ?
2004-10-28T09:02:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	Configure everything to use esound - if you go into xmms, go to preferences and choose the esound or esd output plugin, things should be better
2004-10-28T09:04:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	In what way?
2004-10-28T09:06:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	If you go to desktop preferences/sound, is sound server startup enabled?
2004-10-28T09:07:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	Hrm. It /ought/ to be started on login if that's checked.
2004-10-28T09:08:00.000Z	baHam	mjg59	it doesnt.. where to add programs to be started on reboot ?
2004-10-28T09:09:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	You don't want to start it on reboot, because it's a session-specific application
2004-10-28T09:09:00.000Z	baHam	mjg59	I want to start "esd" on reboot 
2004-10-28T09:09:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	Really, you don't
2004-10-28T09:10:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	The problem is that esd has to run as the user that's currently logged in
2004-10-28T09:10:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	And you can't do that if it's started on reboot
2004-10-28T09:10:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	Yeah, that's the easiest. But if you have start sound server selected and it doesn't start, you should file a bug
2004-10-28T09:12:00.000Z	baHam	mjg59	I want to run it as root
2004-10-28T09:12:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	It won't work if it's run as root
2004-10-28T09:12:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	It uses user-level authentication
2004-10-28T09:12:00.000Z	baHam	mjg59	it works ONLY if i run it on root
2004-10-28T09:12:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	That's very, very odd. Please file a bug - that's not how it should behave
2004-10-28T09:17:00.000Z	baHam	mjg59	you se..
2004-10-28T09:17:00.000Z	baHam	mjg59	now ubuntu sounds work but gaim doesnt work with xmms on..
2004-10-28T09:17:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	Uhm. It's possible gaim is doing the wrong thing.
2004-10-28T09:19:00.000Z	mjg59	baHam	Or just use synaptic, as God intended when he put it on the install CD :)
2004-10-28T09:32:00.000Z	baHam	mjg59	still doesnt work
