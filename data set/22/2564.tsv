2009-09-10T08:40:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	on what?  servers?
2009-09-10T08:41:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	I have a server farm for testing, over 400 machines, some of which are running ext4 ... I have hired people to run it ... I get status reports once a week
2009-09-10T08:41:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	wow, 7%, that isn't good then
2009-09-10T08:43:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	KB1JWQ: failures have all been on western digital though, which has been the clear winner in the past
2009-09-10T08:43:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	hdd failures, or rw failures?  I guess if they are all one brand that is narrowing it down some.
2009-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	my lead tech calls it Loss of Data ...which is of course un-acceptable... reformatting cleans them though and we put them back in line with the other systems
2009-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	yep, that would be rw failure, not hdd failure, that isn't good, odd it is with WD.
2009-09-10T08:46:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	I think of all the drives I have bought over the years WD has been the most reliable, some are even 10 y.o. and still functioning like brand new
2009-09-11T01:11:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	gopchop only supports mpeg doesn't it?
2009-09-11T01:11:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	you're right
2009-10-01T23:39:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	thanks, I think I have a double install of my flash though, I'm going to purge it and re-install, just wasn't sure which app to track down.
2010-02-26T02:45:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	eeepc? runs xandros linux
2010-02-26T02:46:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	eeepc (Asus) cut Linux, and said Microsoft is better.
2010-02-26T02:50:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	sylvania has one http://www.axiontech.com/prdt.php?item=85992
2010-02-26T02:51:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	thanks, it is a bit more than the dell's and seems like less hardware, but thanks for the info.
2010-02-26T02:53:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	this is what I'm looking at currently http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs
2010-02-26T02:55:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	not bad for the $$ but personally I need a little more machine
2010-02-26T02:56:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	yes, this is for my wife, email, web, word processing, and of course facebook, that is it!
2010-02-26T02:56:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	and for when I travel, I can take it with me
2010-02-26T02:56:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	perfect computer for her ... get her the pink or purple one
2010-02-26T02:57:00.000Z	shane2peru	fccf	she is too practicle, doesn't want to spend $40 for color.
2010-02-26T02:58:00.000Z	fccf	shane2peru	I see your point, regardless, that is a good entry-level pc for someone who isn't doing heavy number crunching or graphics
