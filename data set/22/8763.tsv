2005-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	meofcourse		Hi there, I'm new to ubuntu, just upgraded a machine from RH9 to hoary.
2005-05-25T11:08:00.000Z	meofcourse		i'm trying to figure out the repositories. Universe & multiverse, specifically.
2005-05-25T11:09:00.000Z	meofcourse		I haven't been able to find documentation that tells me what I want to consider when deciding whether to use them. Is it riskier? less stable?
2005-05-25T11:10:00.000Z	saber_	meofcourse	well, the more software you have, the greater risk you are in terms of security regardless of what the software is
2005-05-25T11:10:00.000Z	saber_	meofcourse	you have more software, therefore a greater potential for bugs...
2005-05-25T11:10:00.000Z	meofcourse		right, makes sense
2005-05-25T11:10:00.000Z	saber_	meofcourse	ubuntu is pretty stable though. i have not personally had any problems with it
2005-05-25T11:11:00.000Z	saber_	meofcourse	if you setup a firewall, do not run any services, and don't hand out any accounts, you should be ok even if there are a few problems
2005-05-25T11:11:00.000Z	meofcourse	saber_	and you use, all, universe, multiverse, etc?
2005-05-25T11:11:00.000Z	saber_	meofcourse	well, whatever i need :)
2005-05-25T11:11:00.000Z	meofcourse	saber_	this is my gf's workstation, i mainly want to keep it simple and stable for her.
2005-05-25T11:11:00.000Z	saber_	meofcourse	it really comes down to not where the package is located, but the quality of a given package
2005-05-25T11:12:00.000Z	saber_		so its really hard to say
2005-05-25T11:12:00.000Z	meofcourse	saber_	but am working on gettting java working
2005-05-25T11:12:00.000Z	saber_		i use the jdk supplied by sun.com
2005-05-25T11:12:00.000Z	saber_		go download it, slap it in /opt, and edit your .bashrc
2005-05-25T11:13:00.000Z	meofcourse	saber_	ok, so the different sections don't really say "this has seen more reviewing by the team", etc?
2005-05-25T11:13:00.000Z	saber_		well, the universe is not really seen by the ubuntu team
2005-05-25T11:13:00.000Z	saber_		they are primarily concerned with providing a good base (OS)
2005-05-25T11:14:00.000Z	meofcourse	saber_	ok, i was trying to figure that out
2005-05-25T11:14:00.000Z	saber_		that's why the universe is not enabled by default
2005-05-25T11:14:00.000Z	meofcourse	saber_	multiverse too?
