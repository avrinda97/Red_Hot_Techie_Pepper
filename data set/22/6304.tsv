2007-10-14T12:49:00.000Z	Rich4		Hello--I'm installing ubuntu v7.04. What should I use for a Mount Point as a beginner?
2007-10-14T12:49:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	You'll need a mount point of '/' without the quotes.
2007-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Does it give you an example of choices?
2007-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Please list some -- my memory isn't that great; I can't remember the liveCD install by heart ;)
2007-10-14T12:53:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Oh. you want to have the larger part of it ext3, and a smaller part (usually no more than double your physical memory) as 'swap'
2007-10-14T12:53:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	So, if you have a 20gb area you're converting, and have 512mb RAM, make about 19gb ext3, mounted as '/', and about 1gb swap.
2007-10-14T12:54:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Yes. swap is like a windows pagefile -- essentially, it's just an area that your computer uses for extended memory.
2007-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Are you keeping windows on your machine, or are you doing an install to an empty HD?
2007-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Ahh. Easiest way to do it, then, is to make a primary partition with the linux space, and then do logicals for the smaller ones (or so I've found).
2007-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Really, it doesn't matter how you do it, so long as you've got a big ext3 as / in the end and a small swap.
2007-10-14T12:59:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Logical partitions, sorry.
2007-10-14T13:00:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	If you're like me (which you won't be) you'll have 384mb of memory, so mine was about 750mb.
2007-10-14T13:01:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	For linux, you need at least 4gb to install the filesystem on.
2007-10-14T13:01:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	But better to have more for space for files and whatnot.
2007-10-14T13:04:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Exactly. Set the mount point of the 25gb as '/' formatted as ext3, and set the 1024mb as 'swap'.
2007-10-14T13:05:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Wine is absolutely brilliant. I would most highly recommend it.
2007-10-14T13:13:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Yes. gparted works great for it.
2007-10-14T13:15:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	You can do it inside of linux and the liveCD.
2007-10-14T13:15:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	however, the default installer has a partitioner by default.
2007-10-14T13:17:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	I'd swear by it. It's the one I recommended to you :P
2007-10-14T13:20:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	It matters little. I do it at the end, but it doesn't matter.
2007-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	Rob125	Rich4	Yeah, sure.
