2007-05-18T07:33:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	It sounds like you need to read up some introductry tutorials on using linux in general, ubuntu in particular.
2007-05-18T07:34:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	Well, you might be best off starting with some sort of book.  Which book, I don't know, because I'm not up on intro-level ubuntu books.
2007-05-18T07:35:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	Ah, well, unfortuately you've put your finger on one of the most annoying things about ubuntu and linux in general, which is that people who make proprietary formats, like realplayer, seem to do their best to make it impossible to support those formats on open source.
2007-05-18T07:36:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	Try google:  ubuntu firefox realplayer mplayer
2007-05-18T07:36:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	I'm afraid I've always had problems with that sort of thing, and it's usually not important enough to me that I take the time to sort it out.
2007-05-18T07:37:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	From what I can tell, that's often true of the more technically advanced people here;  the more of a hardcore geek you are, the less time you have for toys liek realplayer, etc.
2007-05-18T07:37:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	"where"?  See, this question doesn't really make sense in linux.
2007-05-18T07:37:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	At least, nto at your level.
2007-05-18T07:38:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	Part of what makes Ubuntu so handy is that it has a whole, incredibly smart system for managing installs.
2007-05-18T07:38:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	Don't worry about where the files are, at least not at your level, but rather worry about learning "package management" in linux (and ubuntu particularlly).
2007-05-18T07:40:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	"package management" is the general phrase for the various ubuntu tools and systems (apt, aptitude, dpkg, the ubuntu repositories, distributions and releases, etc) that are used to manage installing applications on ubuntu.
2007-05-18T07:41:00.000Z	puff	aakashpujara	Google on: ubuntu package management tutorial
