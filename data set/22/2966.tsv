2009-01-10T05:23:00.000Z	perillux		how do I know what is using eth0 and what is using eth1?  I'm trying to set up firestarter and it's asking for both...
2009-01-10T05:24:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> what do you meant by what is using eth0 ?
2009-01-10T05:25:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	not sure.. but when I set both options to eth0 it says: "The local area and the Internet connected devices can not be the same."
2009-01-10T05:25:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	so how do I know which is which?
2009-01-10T05:25:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> are you reading any  tutorials at all on how to create a router?
2009-01-10T05:26:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	no I just installed firestarter and I'm trying to run it
2009-01-10T05:26:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> what exactly are you trying to acomplish?
2009-01-10T05:26:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	I just want to run firestarter thats it.
2009-01-10T05:27:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> to do what?  to protect one interface or two or three?
2009-01-10T05:27:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	interface?
2009-01-10T05:28:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> yes, nic card or so call network interface card
2009-01-10T05:28:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	I don't know if I have any network interface cards
2009-01-10T05:28:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> you have to have at least one to communicate, without it, you have an anchor on your desktop
2009-01-10T05:29:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	I just connect to a linksys router which connects to the internet
2009-01-10T05:31:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	I just want to know which one is eth0 and which one is eth1, "Internet connected device" and "local area device"
2009-01-10T05:32:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> in a terminal  type      ifconfig   and it will tell you
2009-01-10T05:33:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	ok I see eth0 and eth1 with a bunch of stuff after each, but I still don't know how to tell which is which...
2009-01-10T05:34:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> may i suggest you read up some tutorials on networking?  pull the cat5 cable out and experiment, see what happens to the ifconfig  command results
2009-01-10T05:35:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	why do I have to be an expert on this stuff just to run the firewall?
2009-01-10T05:36:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> firewall stuff is for experts, you want it secured? you hire a professional okay?
2009-01-10T05:37:00.000Z	perillux	n8tus	I want to learn, but it just makes sense to me to at least be able to use the firewall while I learn about it.. i can't even use it until i get past this setup, and I can't do that until I figure out which is eth0 and which is eth1..  can't u just tell me?
2009-01-10T05:38:00.000Z	n8tus	perillux	-> i gave you a hint,  ifconfig  will tell you
