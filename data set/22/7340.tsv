2008-10-15T04:05:00.000Z	gecko_		im stuck in the middle of a problem some one was helping me with, trying to get my drivers for my Nvidia car i guess, when i boot up Nvidia it says You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server.

2008-10-15T04:07:00.000Z	gecko_		How do i run nvidia-xconfig as root??
2008-10-15T04:09:00.000Z	gecko_		how do i make a pastebin?
2008-10-15T04:11:00.000Z	gecko_		when i run nvidia-xconfig it gives me this, i dont understand it. http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2008-10-15T04:13:00.000Z	kitche	gecko_	where's your paste at?
2008-10-15T04:15:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	http://paste.ubuntu.com/57638/
2008-10-15T04:17:00.000Z	kitche	gecko_	looks like for that section you need to add a line that says driver
2008-10-15T04:18:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	in what way? messing around with things got me in trouble in the first place :)
2008-10-15T04:23:00.000Z	kitche	gecko_	by using sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf and just add a driver line under the video section then rerun nvidia-xconfig
2008-10-15T04:27:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	ok so i put in what you said and a selected area i wanted it to go, then this came up..http://paste.ubuntu.com/57645/.
2008-10-15T04:29:00.000Z	kitche	gecko_	yep now you need to find the place for your video driver and add a line that says driver "nvidia"
2008-10-15T04:29:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	ok, i'll give it a try, never done this before..
2008-10-15T04:32:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	ok, found the nvidia stuff.. and it's marked as driver.. what do i need to do with this? i think i'm a little confused on this part.
2008-10-15T04:45:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	not sure if you had gotten my last message, i found Nvidia, but unsure as what exactly to do with ithttp://paste.ubuntu.com/57649/
2008-10-15T04:45:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	http://paste.ubuntu.com/57649/
2008-10-15T04:48:00.000Z	kitche	gecko_	what about it? it looks fine
2008-10-15T04:49:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	and that's the thing, if everything seems to be fine, why can't i change my reselution settings back to a norm size??
2008-10-15T04:50:00.000Z	kitche	gecko_	do you have the resoultiosn in your xorg.conf?
2008-10-15T04:53:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	http://paste.ubuntu.com/57655/
2008-10-15T04:54:00.000Z	kitche	gecko_	sure enough you don't have any resolutions
2008-10-15T04:54:00.000Z	gecko_	kitche	ok so really dumb question then, but how would i add one?
