2008-10-08T11:53:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	 aight
2009-01-12T04:10:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	What are you trying to change?
2009-01-12T04:11:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	Don't do that.  There's absolutely no reason to set a root password.
2009-01-12T04:11:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	Also, you likely won't need to chmod either.  What are you trying to do to those files?
2009-01-12T04:12:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	i wanna changse the game config and i cant since i am not the owner of the files
2009-01-12T04:13:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	You'll use sudo with the command to edit the files: `gksu gedit /path/to/file` for instance (or sudo nano /path/to/config)
2009-01-12T04:13:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	*dont* chmod
2009-01-12T04:15:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	so i should type in "sudo nano /path/to/config/file
2009-01-12T04:16:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	Yes.  And also, do `sudo passwd -l root` (to re-lock the root account)
2009-01-12T04:16:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	that'll give you a nano window (text editor for the terminal) with the config file.  If you want to use a graphical editor, alt-f2 then gksu gedit /path/to/config/file
2009-01-12T04:17:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	 sudo nano  /usr/share/games/freeciv/nations afghani.ruleset
2009-01-12T04:17:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	Does the filename actually have a space in it?
2009-01-12T04:18:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	it has a . in the middle
2009-01-12T04:18:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	Right, but what about "nations afghani.ruleset"?
2009-01-12T04:18:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	nations is a folder
2009-01-12T04:18:00.000Z	Flannel	baldur	Case matters.  And also, you can use tab complete to help out.
2009-01-12T04:19:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	ahh worked
2009-01-12T04:20:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	it worked thanks
2009-01-12T04:21:00.000Z	baldur	Flannel	i wanna learn more about and how to use the terminal to do my biddings what do you recomend i do for practice and such ?
