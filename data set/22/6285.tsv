2008-01-05T13:40:00.000Z	Kevin`		http://kwzs.be/~kevin/dependency.txt - is this telling me what I think it's telling me? that EVERYTHING depends on having the stock ubuntu kernel installed?
2008-01-05T13:42:00.000Z	Kevin`		anyone?
2008-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	Kevin`		:(
2008-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	astro76	Kevin`	ubuntu-desktop and -standard are meta-packages, they can be removed without removing their dependencies
2008-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	what about apparmor and restricted-manager
2008-01-05T13:45:00.000Z	astro76		!flash64 | Lichte
2008-01-05T13:45:00.000Z	astro76	Kevin`	the rest depend on the installed kernel version
2008-01-05T13:48:00.000Z	Kevin`		~.
2008-01-05T13:48:00.000Z	Kevin`		ass
2008-01-05T13:49:00.000Z	Kevin`		      eep
2008-01-05T13:49:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	so removing that should be safe
2008-01-05T13:49:00.000Z	Kevin`		(irc client got.. messed up)
2008-01-05T13:50:00.000Z	astro76	Kevin`	not necessarily, why are you removing the kernel?
2008-01-05T13:50:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	because it wont work on this device and the installer for it is causing problems
2008-01-05T13:51:00.000Z	astro76	Kevin`	what device? installer for it?
2008-01-05T13:51:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	the script that runs when the kernel image is installed, I mean
2008-01-05T13:51:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	olpc
2008-01-05T13:52:00.000Z	astro76	Kevin`	ah well, sounds like you have some work no matter what ;)
2008-01-05T13:53:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	oh, it's running right now actually. still some more stuff to do but I needed to fix the error with updating first :)
2008-01-05T13:53:00.000Z	astro76	Kevin`	well if you remove the kernel it won't be running for long
2008-01-05T13:53:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	yeah,
2008-01-05T13:53:00.000Z	Kevin`	astro76	yeah, I know =p
