2008-08-30T17:42:00.000Z	benste		what?
2008-08-30T17:42:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	what is the issue
2008-08-30T17:46:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	what happens when you launch from terminal what errors do you get; if over one line the paste to paste.ubuntu.com
2008-08-30T17:53:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	cant use other app than f-spot?
2008-08-30T17:54:00.000Z	benste	bazhang	it's not only f-spot
2008-08-30T17:54:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	all apps?
2008-08-30T17:55:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	why not find something that has similar capabilities to f-spot and use that
2008-08-30T17:55:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	indeed why not gimp
2008-08-30T17:56:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	what happened to make them stop working
2008-08-30T17:57:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	they have been not working since installation?
2008-08-30T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	what was installed since you last had it working
2008-08-30T18:03:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	why were you 'tweaking' acpi and what exactly did you do there
2008-08-30T18:05:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	and did the fix work
2008-08-30T18:06:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	I think that is the source of your problems; what happens in the livecd for example and how old is this install
2008-08-30T18:07:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	and what happens when you try the livecd? does the problem go away?
2008-08-30T18:08:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	do you have a separate home partition
2008-08-30T18:09:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	it sounds like when you were mucking with acpi you did some damage
2008-08-30T18:10:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	what about setting back to normal from your tweaking; also what 'tweaking' did you do to xorg precisely
2008-08-30T18:11:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	where did you set the acpi tweaks
2008-08-30T18:13:00.000Z	bazhang	benste	where is the acpi tweak set exactly
