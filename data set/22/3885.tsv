2008-08-31T03:05:00.000Z	lt_daniel787		anybody here that could please help me out
2008-08-31T03:05:00.000Z	lt_daniel787		I have looked around the net
2008-08-31T03:05:00.000Z	lt_daniel787		thanks
2008-08-31T03:05:00.000Z	lt_daniel787		I am unable to connect to a few websites
2008-08-31T03:06:00.000Z	lt_daniel787		ah ok, thanks
2008-08-31T03:06:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	what websites?
2008-08-31T03:08:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	what does ping 64.4.33.7 return?
2008-08-31T03:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	bad example hotmail has ping turned off, try facebook: 69.63.178.11
2008-08-31T03:10:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	ok this means that you have a dns related problem
2008-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	??
2008-08-31T03:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	can it be that you got some parental control on on that router of yours?
2008-08-31T03:12:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	allright, what does nslookup facebook.com return?
2008-08-31T03:15:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	if i were in your place my next guess would be to connect the computer directly to the net without the router inbetween so you know what is the source of the problem
2008-08-31T03:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	then there is your diagnose
2008-08-31T03:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	it updated your cached dns records so it will work until those exipre
2008-08-31T03:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	the ploblem is caused by the router
2008-08-31T03:21:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	you would have to "take apart" the router?
2008-08-31T03:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	maybe it helps if you reset it to its factory defaults and reconfigure it
2008-08-31T03:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	maybe there is a fimrware update for your device that covers some bugs...
2008-08-31T03:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	ubuntu does that for you as long as it can
2008-08-31T03:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	lt_daniel787	goodspeed lewtennant
