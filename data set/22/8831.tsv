2006-03-16T16:52:00.000Z	swim		has anyone here gone from mandriva to ubuntu and stayed?
2006-03-16T16:53:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	I went from mandrake to debian to ubuntu and stayed
2006-03-16T16:53:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	can you remember what you like more about ubuntu over mandriva?
2006-03-16T16:53:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	mainly the package management system and the repositories
2006-03-16T16:54:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	also, ubuntu is a great community driven distro
2006-03-16T16:55:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	because I used to use small distros like CRUX, and then Archlinux, but then I wanted something bigger that would "just work" so I could get more work done... unfortunatley although in a lot of ways I like ubuntu, i find a few things dont "just work" so Im considering trying one of the other big ones like Mandriva, or OpenSUSE
2006-03-16T16:56:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	what are you struggling to get working?
2006-03-16T16:56:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	at the moment mostly burning... audio, as well as data
2006-03-16T16:56:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	have you enabled dma on your drive?
2006-03-16T16:57:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	I dont remember can I check from cli?
2006-03-16T16:58:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	hdparm /dev/hdc
2006-03-16T16:58:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	hmm using_dma = 0 (off)
2006-03-17T17:01:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	ok Ill set it up but, why isnt that under some regular ubuntu setup guide,  that tells you everything one should setup theyre system like before everything works well
2006-03-17T17:02:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	it's a very young distribution, it's all coming together though, the wiki contains lots of useful stuff
2006-03-17T17:03:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	yes I like the wiki, but I wouldnt have been aware of that without asking in here and having people know what I should do
2006-03-17T17:03:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	as I say, it's a great community driven distribution :)
2006-03-17T17:05:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	I think dma being enabled by default my cause more compatibility issues than it solves
2006-03-17T17:09:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	is dapper useable enough for me to install it right now?
2006-03-17T17:10:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	I've not tried it yet
2006-09-11T16:46:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	I guess it would read bazaar servers, sort of like cvs
2006-09-11T05:56:00.000Z	anto9us	swim	tried nautilus?
2006-09-11T05:59:00.000Z	swim	anto9us	yah I have
