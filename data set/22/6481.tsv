2006-10-15T09:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex		andres: where did you get kde-3.5.5 from?
2006-10-15T09:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex		whitehorse: right-click on the video and click save as. :P
2006-10-15T09:54:00.000Z	ArrenLex		andres: you compiled from source?
2006-10-15T09:55:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Oh.
2006-10-15T09:55:00.000Z	ArrenLex		andres: then I don't know if you should be filing a bug report with kde. Maybe it's an ubuntu-only bug.
2006-10-15T09:56:00.000Z	ArrenLex		!tell lostboyz about checkinstall
2006-10-15T09:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Nihil: are you trying to play mp3s? Amarok won't play mp3s by default, I believe.
2006-10-15T09:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex		ryan: just go to your /etc/apt/sources.list and change to a different mirror.
2006-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	its set to the us.archive.ubuntu.com
2006-10-15T10:04:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	its still failing on the connection, i can ping the ip addresses, its just not seeing the files
2006-10-15T10:05:00.000Z	ArrenLex	ryan8403	how are you trying to access the files?
2006-10-15T10:05:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	i'm running both apt-get update and Synaptic
2006-10-15T10:06:00.000Z	ArrenLex	ryan8403	that's not what I mean. The files are on a remote computer running Windows. How are you trying to acess this remote computer?
2006-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	I'm using apt-get update or synaptic package manager the error message i'm getting back is that the connection failed
2006-10-15T10:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	ryan8403	how are you trying to connect?
2006-10-15T10:10:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	I'm connected right now through broadband
2006-10-15T10:10:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	The box is the one that i'm currently using
2006-10-15T10:11:00.000Z	ArrenLex	ryan8403	that's not what I mean. In Windows, if you want to access a remote machine, you go to My Network Places, yes? What special thing are you doing right now?
2006-10-15T10:12:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	i'm not doing anything special like that
2006-10-15T10:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	ryan8403	I'm confused as to what you're doing.
2006-10-15T10:13:00.000Z	ryan8403	ArrenLex	I'm trying to update my box by running apt-get update when doing that i get Err http://us.archive.ubuntu.com dapper Release.gpg Connection failed [IP: 146.137.96.15 80] 
2006-10-15T10:14:00.000Z	ArrenLex	ryan8403	then go to /etc/apt/sources.list and change where it says "us.archive.ubuntu.com" to "archive.ubuntu.com" (remove the us)
