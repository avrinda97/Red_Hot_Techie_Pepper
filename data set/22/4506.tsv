2010-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	glaucous		Have anyone here tried disabling journaling in ext4 (or ext3)? Does it increase the chance of data-loss a lot?
2010-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	not really, but it removes the possability of recovery
2010-10-22T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	it's /tmp normally
2010-10-22T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	it (depending on your editor) uses tmp to write the file
2010-10-22T17:07:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	when using sudo it does seem to store it in /tmp first
2010-10-22T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	it will do
2010-10-22T17:07:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	however, /tmp has permission drwxrwxrwt, which seems correct
2010-10-28T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	make sure you preserve permissions, but it's that simple
2010-10-28T21:25:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	that is the main problem. Will making a partition copy using gparted preserve permissions?
2010-10-31T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	because in a terminal you have a shell, in alt+f2 you have not launched a shellyet
2010-10-31T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	"shell yet"
2010-10-31T21:49:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	in startup applications, guess no shell is used there either?
2010-10-31T21:49:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	not sure if a shell is launched to execute that
2010-10-31T21:51:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	probably not, seems like the commands which dont work in startup applications don't work in run application either
2010-10-31T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	a reasonable guess then
2010-10-31T21:52:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	is there perhaps a startup script/file (equivalent to root rc.local) I should use for launching startup commands for a user in $HOME?
2010-10-31T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	you can so it through rc.local, or use the startup applications to call a script that launches a shell, THEN does your commands, eg, start of the script #!/bin/bash
2010-10-31T21:54:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	yes of course. Just wanted to make sure that there weren't already  a specific script/file I should use. Thanks.
2010-10-31T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	that's how I'd do it,
2010-10-31T21:56:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	If I want to launch a GUI application, or an application which should run outside the current shell (if this makes sense). Then I should use (for instance) audacity &? Or is this the recommended way?
2010-10-31T21:56:00.000Z	ikonia	glaucous	that should work
2010-10-31T21:56:00.000Z	glaucous	ikonia	good
