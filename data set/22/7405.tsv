2006-04-04T09:09:00.000Z	isilzha		hi. whenever the system needs root priviledges it fails at the pw prompt, not accepting my password. this pw is correct as i successfully verified in console
2006-04-04T09:09:00.000Z	_jason	isilzha	what does 'sudo echo hi' do?
2006-04-04T09:11:00.000Z	isilzha	_jason	it won't accept my pw either
2006-04-04T09:11:00.000Z	_jason	isilzha	is this the first user you created during install?  and is this an expert install?
2006-04-04T09:11:00.000Z	isilzha	_jason	expert
