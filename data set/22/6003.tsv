2007-04-21T06:55:00.000Z	Malachi		My openoffice doesn't work. It just displays and loads the splash and then disappears. I'm using feisty; it did work in Edgy.
2007-04-21T06:57:00.000Z	Malachi		The program 'oowriter' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2007-04-21T06:57:00.000Z	Malachi		sudo apt-get install openoffice.org-writer
2007-04-21T06:57:00.000Z	Malachi		bash: oowriter: command not found
2007-04-21T06:57:00.000Z	Malachi		But openoffice.org-writer is installed, tom_
2007-04-21T06:58:00.000Z	Malachi		jibsa1242: No....I guess I'll try it...
2007-04-21T06:58:00.000Z	elpargo	Malachi	can you try that with a different user? or do a reinstall of oo
2007-04-21T06:59:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	I guess I could create a new user...
2007-04-21T06:59:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	But I'll try a reinstall first.
2007-04-21T06:59:00.000Z	elpargo	Malachi	why??? for oo
2007-04-21T07:00:00.000Z	elpargo	Malachi	can you open a new shell and try there
2007-04-21T07:00:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	?
2007-04-21T07:00:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	Define new shell. Something besides bash?
2007-04-21T07:01:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	Or try it under sudo?
2007-04-21T07:01:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	Or what?
2007-04-21T07:01:00.000Z	elpargo	Malachi	bash just another instance
2007-04-21T07:01:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	openoffice.org-writer still gives me nothing.
2007-04-21T07:02:00.000Z	elpargo	Malachi	 no no that should be oowriter
2007-04-21T07:02:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	Still nothing
2007-04-21T07:02:00.000Z	elpargo	Malachi	open up synaptics and reinstall openoffice package (the whole thing)
2007-04-21T07:03:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	Yeah, I'm about to do that.
2007-04-21T07:05:00.000Z	Malachi	elpargo	ajehuk: Funny, says it can't be authenticated.
