2008-05-18T22:41:00.000Z	Scynet		So, since I now have Vista and ubuntu to different HDDs, is there a simplish way to make it let me chooce which to boot to?
2008-05-18T22:41:00.000Z	Scynet		Ok, I'll try that, thanks
2008-05-18T22:42:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	You get no Grub menu at bootup?
2008-05-18T22:44:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	I have tried that same process and I had Grub menu at boot up but Windows was not in the options. You may very probably need to add it to your grub menu
2008-05-18T22:53:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	others have had that problem. Are you able to boot from LiveCD?
2008-05-18T22:54:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	not with Vista HDD installed. I removed Vista HDD though, and Ubuntu installed fine on the other HDD
2008-05-18T22:55:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	this may help -->http://apcmag.com/how_to_dualboot_vista_with_linux_vista_installed_first.htm
2008-05-18T22:56:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	Sorry, but that's only dealing with a single HDD
2008-05-18T22:57:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	installed it on the second HDD, unable to boot to Ubuntu with Vista HDD plugged in though
2008-05-18T22:58:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	We will have to look at what /boot/grub/menu.lst has and see what to edit
2008-05-18T23:00:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	I don't think it's a problem with the menus to begin with. It's just that ubuntu simply won't work with Vista HDD plugged in. I can chooce which one to boot to by setting HDD priority from BIOS. Vista loads fine if I pick Vista HDD as first in boot order, but if I put Ubuntu first it tries to load but crashes if Vista HDD is installed....phew
2008-05-18T23:06:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	I think Grub just lost track of where to boot your OS from. Choosing Vista from the menu works ok?
2008-05-18T23:07:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	there's no menu, it goes to ubuntu automatically if I set ubuntu HDD first in BIOS boot priority, and to Vista automatically if I choose Vista first
2008-05-18T23:08:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	well, that us odd
2008-05-18T23:08:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	yeah. Both OSes load fine if I remove the other, Vista works with both plugged in, but ubuntu fails if I have Vista plugged
2008-05-18T23:08:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	read up with me -->https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/31896
2008-05-18T23:10:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	well that was no help
2008-05-18T23:11:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	have you got too much already set up in those OSes? Coz the quickest (probably the easiest) path for you now is a reinstall the *usual* and commonly known way :)
2008-05-18T23:12:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	but I can't do that, since I can't even boot the Live CD and install Ubuntu with Vista HDD installed. Only way to install ubuntu is to remove Vista HDD while installing ubuntu :(
2008-05-18T23:12:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	you will want to use LiveCD of Gparted or repartitioning tools to cleanslate your drives
2008-05-18T23:13:00.000Z	Scynet	babola1	Yeah I guess, but I'm not sure I want to go that far. If I can't install Ubuntu on the other HDD without affecting vista, I'll just format the Ubuntu HDD as NTFS and use the extra space in Vista
2008-05-18T23:14:00.000Z	babola1	Scynet	i guess you can do that.. good luck!
