Whenever you have issues with firefox freezing on a page with flash animations try to force quit that process instead. There is a good chance firefox will resume responding and you will merely have to reload the page to get the flash animation back.

2009-05-04T10:53:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Are you in command line or System Monitor?
2009-05-04T10:54:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Right click on it, Kill process.
2009-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	So.. killed it?
2009-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	admin_masu3701	khensthoth	how to kill it in command line
2009-05-04T10:56:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	kill -9 (name) I think. Not too sure.
2009-05-04T10:56:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Or kill -9 (PID)
2009-05-04T17:19:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Didn't someone try to solve this with you earlier today?
2009-05-04T17:46:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	sudo apt-get install firefox
2009-05-04T17:52:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	rm -rf /home/.mozilla
2009-05-04T17:53:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	I mean /home/yourusename/.mozilla
2009-05-04T17:57:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Are you on 64bit system?
2009-05-04T17:58:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	How did you install your Flash
2009-05-04T18:01:00.000Z	admin_masu3701	khensthoth	would removing flash player in the system fix the problem?
2009-05-04T18:02:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Probably.
2009-05-04T18:05:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	x86_64. That's 64 bit.
2009-05-04T18:06:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Ask to see if you can install Ubuntu 32 bit on your 64 bit system. If you can, install it, use firefox and flash from there.
2009-05-04T18:08:00.000Z	admin_masu3701	khensthoth	i had flash working fine before..this problem stated last night when firefox froze and i had to force it to quit
2009-05-04T18:10:00.000Z	khensthoth	admin_masu3701	Try what creative83 suggested, see if that fixes it. If not, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=647961&page=3
