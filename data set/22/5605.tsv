2007-06-27T12:40:00.000Z	nuked_omen		why does gedit always generate file~ when i edit any file

2007-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	nuked_omen	nerdygirl_ellie	ahh, thanks a lot
2007-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	nuked_omen	I would leave it on, but that is me.
2007-06-27T12:42:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	nuked_omen	I am a clutz. :D
2007-06-27T12:43:00.000Z	nuked_omen	nerdygirl_ellie	it doesn't get deleted even if i save the file.. besides, i know what i'm doing, i don't need the computer to save a copy.. but that is me
2007-06-27T12:43:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie		How do I change my default application for .xls files to OpenOffice instead of Gnumeric?
2007-06-27T12:43:00.000Z	nuked_omen	nerdygirl_ellie	open with
2007-06-27T12:43:00.000Z	nuked_omen	nerdygirl_ellie	right-click > properties > open with tab
2007-06-27T12:44:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	nuked_omen	but it doesn't "remember" that.  I have to do it every time, and Gnumeric won't read from a smb share
2007-06-27T12:44:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	nuked_omen	 ... and I am a klutz. :)
2007-06-27T12:45:00.000Z	nuked_omen	nerdygirl_ellie	if you do the right-click > properties > open with tab, it should remember
2007-06-27T12:45:00.000Z	nuked_omen		always does with me
2007-06-27T12:45:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie		will try again.
2007-06-27T12:45:00.000Z	nuked_omen		there is an option button you should check
2007-06-27T12:46:00.000Z	nuked_omen	nerdygirl_ellie	this might sound stupid but what is a klutz?
2007-06-27T12:46:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie		!klutz
2007-06-27T12:46:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie		A klutz is a person that does clumsy things.
2007-06-27T12:46:00.000Z	nuked_omen	nerdygirl_ellie	google says "A klutz is person who is clumsy, foolish, inept, or accident-prone"
