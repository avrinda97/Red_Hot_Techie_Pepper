2010-06-15T21:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	 ubuntu says unknown monitor where exactly?
2010-06-15T21:29:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	exacty
2010-06-15T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	 ubuntu says unknown monitor where exactly?   <--------- WHERE AT does it say this 'unknown monitor' ? terminal window? some config? some log?
2010-06-15T21:31:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	it say only 'unknown monitor' in the monitor configuration gui
2010-06-15T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	 thats just the 'name/brand' its trying to determina. that dosent really mean much of anything.
2010-06-15T21:32:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	 w/o that setting Ubuntu wont chanhe to the right resolution.
2010-06-15T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	  its possible for you to have a 'unknown monitor' and still have proper screen display. the name dosent mean much. its the actual settings that matter.  What is your video card?
2010-06-15T21:33:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	nvidia installed with 3d part drivers
2010-06-15T21:38:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	an example. if i set 800x600 or 1024x768 eveythinh is ok. but when i change to 1152x864 Ubuntu accepts the setting but it cant fit the wole moinitor area, i get a frame black all around
2010-06-15T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	 that sounds like the monitor cant handle it.. so its doing that.. or the refresh rate is wrong.. or the monitor settings need to be tweaked.. You said it was a CRT monitor?
2010-06-15T21:39:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	 Yes Samsung SyncMaster 753 DFX
2010-06-15T21:41:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	so the problem it the CRT? strange because old HW should easier to get "driver"
2010-06-15T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	 thats not logical. :) windows 7 no longer has the druivers for my 15 yr old printer i noticed.. :)
2010-06-15T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	 with monitors its often not a matter of 'drivers'   sounds like it  IS working.. but you may need to twiddle with the knobs at the higher res.
2010-06-15T21:43:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	does exist an utility to interrogate the monitor peripheral?
2010-06-15T22:12:00.000Z	FabParma	Dr_Willis	ubutom_: I discovered that in super user mode the "ATI chatalist control center" list the right monitor, but it cant pass that information to the OS ubuntu lucid
2010-06-15T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FabParma	 i dont use ati.. but  cant that tool 'save' a xorg.conf file? if it can save xorg.conf then it dosent matter what the user does/can do.
