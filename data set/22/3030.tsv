2009-03-05T08:50:00.000Z	aprilhare		is there a ubuntu terminal command equivalent to OS X's Open command?
2009-03-05T08:51:00.000Z	wolter	aprilhare	gnome-open i think
2009-03-05T08:52:00.000Z	aprilhare	wolter	thanks however it doesn't seem to behave as expected
2009-03-05T08:53:00.000Z	wolter	aprilhare	what do you want?
2009-03-05T08:53:00.000Z	aprilhare	wolter	money :) naaah that'll do
2009-03-05T08:53:00.000Z	aprilhare		thanks
2009-03-05T08:53:00.000Z	wolter		ha
2009-03-05T08:54:00.000Z	aprilhare	wolter	for instance, when i try to open an icon on my desktop lbreakout2, i type gnome-open ~/Desktop/lbreakout2 and it doesn't open; gnome-open ~/Desktop/lbreakout2.desktop opens it in gedit
2009-03-05T08:54:00.000Z	wolter		well, .desktop files are text files
2009-03-05T08:54:00.000Z	wolter		but hm..
2009-03-05T08:54:00.000Z	wolter	aprilhare	download gnome-do!
2009-03-05T08:55:00.000Z	wolter		thats like mac's quicksilver
2009-03-05T08:55:00.000Z	aprilhare		ooooo different
2009-03-05T08:55:00.000Z	wolter	aprilhare	or you could do a symlink to the binary, and place a custom icon and name as well on it.
2009-03-05T08:55:00.000Z	wolter		it will open as you want, but it will have the arrow symbol on a corner :s
2009-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	aprilhare	wolter	sounds like effort and produces ugly arrow :)
2009-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	wolter	aprilhare	yeah
2009-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	aprilhare	wolter	besides, that wouldn't exactly work with wine apps.
2009-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	wolter	aprilhare	well yes...
2009-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	wolter		but aprilhare why don't you download gnome-do? its the best tool for launching applications you will ever see/have/use
2009-03-05T08:57:00.000Z	aprilhare	wolter	already have
2009-03-05T08:57:00.000Z	aprilhare	wolter	trying to learn to use it now :)
