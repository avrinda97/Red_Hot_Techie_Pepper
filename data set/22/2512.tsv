2010-01-17T03:15:00.000Z	phong_		there is like 10 zillian softwares for windows and rarely anything for linux, what am i going to do
2010-01-17T03:15:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	there is tons of linux software, check applications -> ubuntu software center to get started :)
2010-01-17T03:17:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	try arista transcoder or winff to do media conversion
2010-01-17T03:18:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	openarena, sauerbrauten, and tremulous are great FPS, try http://playdeb.net to find more
2010-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	many windows games will run in wine, use playonlinux to help install
2010-01-17T03:20:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	it helps install windows games on linux, it's available through the software center
2010-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	yep that's it, wine is what runs underneath
2010-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	installing playonlinux shouldn't effect the current wine version
2010-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	applications -> games -> playonlinux
2010-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	you will also need the install files for whatever you want to run, playonlinux just makes the process easier
2010-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	yep that is called desktop effects or compiz
2010-01-17T03:26:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	pick install if you have some windows program you want to set up
2010-01-17T03:31:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	wine sees the linux filesystem as the C drive
2010-01-17T03:31:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	point the playonlinux install to wherever the cd is mounted
2010-01-17T03:36:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	the cd should be in something like /mount/cdrom
2010-01-17T03:37:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	yah, you can try either way
2010-01-17T03:40:00.000Z	MikeChelen	phong_	point playonlinux to the cd, it might look like C:\\media\cdrom
