2009-01-10T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	datta	explain exactly what you are trying to do
2009-01-10T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	datta	system -> preferences -> keyboard -> layout to change the layout used
2009-01-10T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	datta	if you are sure you need to modify a layout, then read /usr/share/doc/xkb-data/README.Debian
2009-01-11T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	datta	read /usr/share/doc/xkb-data/README.Debian
2009-01-11T18:28:00.000Z	datta	jrib	i did read it but the bengali one is mad a lot differently
2009-07-10T21:38:00.000Z	jrib	datta	use system -> preferences -> appearance
2009-07-10T21:40:00.000Z	datta	jrib	sorry for pushing the enter so much but as i was saying how do i make linsta to work in the system? all the gtk and emrald, i don't actually understand those
2009-07-10T21:40:00.000Z	jrib	datta	I have no idea what linsta is
2009-07-10T21:43:00.000Z	jrib	datta	did you try the Appearance dialog I pointed you to earlier?
2009-07-10T21:43:00.000Z	jrib	datta	I don't know what "doesn't seem to work" means
2009-07-10T21:46:00.000Z	jrib	datta	we can't help you if you don't answer questions.
2009-07-10T21:46:00.000Z	jrib	datta	please use my name if you want me to see what you say.  Pastebin: ls -l ~/.themes/
2009-07-10T21:48:00.000Z	datta	jrib	i want to install this aero clone theme but it gives me a error all the time when i drag and drop the theme in
2009-07-10T21:48:00.000Z	jrib	datta	Pastebin: ls -l ~/.themes/
2009-07-10T21:49:00.000Z	datta	jrib	http://pastebin.com/m1841f910
2009-07-10T21:49:00.000Z	jrib	datta	it's already installed
2009-07-10T21:50:00.000Z	datta	jrib	but it doesn't show that in the apperence menu
2009-07-10T21:50:00.000Z	jrib	datta	click customize?
2009-11-03T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	datta	well we can start taking guesses or you can just tell us what you did and what you mean by "not working properly"
2009-11-03T18:54:00.000Z	jrib	datta	I saw someone with that same complaint earlier.  You may want to check bugs.ubuntu.com for an existing bug report to see if any fixes exist in the comments
2009-12-05T19:41:00.000Z	jrib	datta	make sure correct language is selected
