2005-05-24T11:34:00.000Z	Hoxzer		somebody knows how to use UMTS self phone as a modem with linux?
2005-05-24T11:34:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	it should be just like using a regular modem
2005-05-24T11:35:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	well then it should be just like using a USB modem  :)
2005-05-24T11:35:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	I haven't used a modem in 5 yrs
2005-05-24T11:36:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	but if no-one else can help u here, search about USB modem on the wiki and forum
2005-05-24T11:46:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	not sure if it's the best but ffmpeg is old and reliable
2005-05-24T11:48:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	avi is just a container
2005-05-24T11:48:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	it can be any compression format inside
2005-05-24T11:50:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	but what I was getting at is that u need the right codec to decompress the AVI first
2005-05-24T11:51:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	and depending on what codec the source is, u should consider using a better format like MPEG2 or Divx/xvid for your target, if it's applicable to what u wanna do
2005-05-24T11:52:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	i c. but how about downcodinf divx/xvid to a lower res?
2005-05-24T11:53:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	well, do what u wanna do. FFmpeg and mencoder willl do what u want regardless :)
2005-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	yes u r indeed
2005-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	u got your sound working on your airplane as well?
2005-05-24T12:42:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	mp3 pro is not standard, it's a nonstandard extension to mp3. don't use it
2005-05-24T12:42:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	right, Ogg is better quality, better compression, VBR from the get-go, frame-accurate, and patent-free
2005-05-24T12:45:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	is that good or bad??? :-D
2005-05-24T12:46:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	what did u use on Win32? VirtualDub?
2005-05-24T12:46:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	FFmpeg is avail on win32 as well, plus numerous clones like Xmpeg
2005-05-24T12:48:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	depends on what cell phone u use
2005-05-24T12:48:00.000Z	goofrider	Hoxzer	u can get a ogg player for most smartphones I think
