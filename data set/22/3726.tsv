2008-06-18T23:00:00.000Z	Wispring		I would like some help to complete the process of copying and pasting from a mounted HD (not part of ubuntu) to a folder (var/ftp/BlenderArt) in the ubuntu file system. right now i can't because of file permissions I believe which I don't fully understand
2008-06-18T23:01:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	ok, are there folders and stuff? or just plain files in the one folder?
2008-06-18T23:02:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	ok, there are two things to check.. you have to be able to read the files off the external hd.. that usually isn't a problem
2008-06-18T23:02:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	next, you need permission to write in /var/ftp.. which I think you might not have
2008-06-18T23:02:00.000Z	Wispring	Slart	that's what i think also
2008-06-18T23:03:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	terminal or gui? how do you want to do this
2008-06-18T23:03:00.000Z	Wispring	Slart	terminal
2008-06-18T23:04:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	then it would be something like this.. "sudo cp /media/disk/mystuff/* /var/ftp/"
2008-06-18T23:04:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	the /media/disk/mystuff part is just a guess.. you'll have to change it to the path of the files you want to copy
2008-06-18T23:05:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	this will just copy the files.. so we don't lose them if something bad happens
2008-06-18T23:05:00.000Z	Wispring	Slart	ok i give it a go
2008-06-18T23:05:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	lots and lots of files?
2008-06-18T23:08:00.000Z	Wispring	Slart	will you help me in another tab....scrolling up is a hassle
2008-06-18T23:09:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	sure
2008-06-18T23:45:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	you mean when you're using sudo?
2008-06-18T23:45:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	when using sudo you use your regular user password.. the one you log in with
2008-06-18T23:47:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	ubuntu doesn't use the root account like that.. other distros do that
2008-06-18T23:47:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	if you need a root terminal you can use sudo -i
2008-06-18T23:48:00.000Z	Wispring	Slart	makes perfect sense to me now
2008-06-18T23:48:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	but remember to type "exit" when you're done.. a root terminal is like a sharp sharp knife =)
2008-06-18T23:51:00.000Z	Wispring	Slart	thanks I will remember that... i was trying to log-in to the FTP server and view directory files and it asks for a password  when I type in dir....don't have a clue what the password is since it's not my user to ubuntu password...thought i would try logging in as root user ...that didnt work as well
2008-06-18T23:52:00.000Z	Slart	Wispring	some ftp servers use "virtual users".. ie the userlist for the ftp server isn't the same as the host machine.. other ftp servers use the same users..
