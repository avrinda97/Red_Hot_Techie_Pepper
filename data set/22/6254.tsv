2006-11-24T08:09:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	then run your windows prog like "wine prog.exe"
2006-11-24T08:11:00.000Z	unfun		sod im doing something wrong and i dont know what
2006-11-24T08:12:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	to install wine itself or run a prog whith it ?
2006-11-24T08:12:00.000Z	unfun		run a prog with it
2006-11-24T08:12:00.000Z	unfun		for example  wine /home/amir/Desktop/Continuum-wine/Continuum/Continuum.exe
2006-11-24T08:14:00.000Z	unfun	sod75	Is itpossible I got an old wine? if so where do I find a new one?
2006-11-24T08:14:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	, that should work if wine is configured (wincfg) but not all programs can be run under wine...
2006-11-24T08:14:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	their is a repositoty for the latest wine on their website
2006-11-24T08:15:00.000Z	unfun	sod75	the program should work because alot of people play the game thorugh wine
2006-11-24T08:15:00.000Z	unfun		!wine
2006-11-24T08:15:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	: deb http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt binary/
2006-11-24T08:16:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	: try setting different windows versions, etc
2006-11-24T08:16:00.000Z	unfun	sod75	is the version for dapper ?
2006-11-24T08:16:00.000Z	sod75		generally win 98 seems fine
2006-11-24T08:17:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	: that's directly form wine, but I've used it on dapper yes
2006-11-24T08:18:00.000Z	unfun	sod75	when I try 98 I get ftal error something
2006-11-24T08:19:00.000Z	sod75	unfun	not everything will work under wine
