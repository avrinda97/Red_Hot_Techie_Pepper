2009-03-21T23:08:00.000Z	The_Drizzle		Hello. Could anyone help me install the utilities necessary to build a custom kernel in Intrepid on a computer with no internet connection?
2009-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	ubuntu does not support custom kernels, use a distro that does....
2009-03-21T23:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	there are MANY issues that arrise with ubuntu + custom kernel
2009-03-21T23:10:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	but essentially, all you need is gcc, ncurses and kernel source
2009-03-21T23:10:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	Is that true? I have a book ("Practical Guide to Ubuntu") that has a whole chapter on it...
2009-03-21T23:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile
2009-03-21T23:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	that is true, I have seen many people attempt it, it is possible but not supported or recommended
2009-03-21T23:12:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	In a few words, why all the trouble?
2009-03-21T23:12:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	I'm reading that link, by the way
2009-03-21T23:12:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	ubuntu has implemented systems that install say, alsa modules via the package management system. On a modified ubuntu kernel you will not be able to install these modules the ubuntu way
2009-03-21T23:13:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	I see. I guess that's the trade-off between ease of use and power/customizability
2009-03-21T23:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	exactly
2009-03-21T23:14:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	In that case, is it possible to easily build a module/driver for a new hardware item in ubuntu?
2009-03-21T23:17:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	Any resources you could point me to for compiling a new kernel module/driver in ubuntu?
2009-03-21T23:18:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	All I'm really after is gettin gmy ralink wireless card working :P

2009-03-21T23:18:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	Right on. Thanks for your help
2009-03-21T23:18:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	that might require ndiswrapper, I don't know if it has native linux drivers
2009-03-21T23:19:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	but ndiswrapper should always be a last resort
2009-03-21T23:19:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	I think it does have native drivers since 2.6.26 or so
2009-03-21T23:19:00.000Z	Titan8990	The_Drizzle	also, check the restricted driver manager
2009-03-21T23:19:00.000Z	The_Drizzle	Titan8990	I just need to build it against the right kernel headers, right?
