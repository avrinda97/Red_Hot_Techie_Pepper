2010-02-18T03:36:00.000Z	Samuel_		Hi.  Is there a command line program to install ubuntu packages that does all the fun stuff like automatically installing dependancies and asking configuration questions?
2010-02-18T03:37:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	of course
2010-02-18T03:37:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	apt-get and aptitude
2010-02-18T03:38:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	then you want dpkg
2010-02-18T03:38:00.000Z	Samuel_	PingFloyd	when I try dpkg, it fails saying that I don't have the dependancies installed already.  I want a program that does all the dependancy installing
2010-02-18T03:51:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	makes things maintainable too
2010-02-18T03:44:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	I don't know then, I just install the dependencies that dpkg complains about
2010-02-18T03:44:00.000Z	Samuel_	PingFloyd	that can't work for me because I need to make a script to do it
2010-02-18T03:44:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	you can make a script, but I'm not sure of an existing util
2010-02-18T03:47:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	probably what you really want to do is have your own local repo with your custom packages
2010-02-18T03:47:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	that will allow you to make use of the more advanced tools in a sane fashion
2010-02-18T03:48:00.000Z	Samuel_	PingFloyd	it seems kind of silly to have a customer download a repository, setup their APT to include the repository, just for one .deb package
2010-02-18T03:49:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	http://hausheer.osola.com/docs/14
2010-02-18T03:49:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	not really
2010-02-18T03:50:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	that's the whole idea of the package management and repo system
2010-02-18T03:50:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	it's extensible
2010-02-18T03:50:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	makes it so you can update the package in one place too
2010-02-18T03:51:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	that's where mirroring comes in
2010-02-18T03:52:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	as well as scalable
2010-02-18T03:52:00.000Z	Samuel_	PingFloyd	that's too much to expect out of a customer.  On the desktop version, all they need to do is download the file and double click it.... I assumed there should be a command line equivalent in the server version
2010-02-18T03:53:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	having them use synaptic, or run apt-get install is too much to expect of them?
2010-02-18T03:54:00.000Z	PingFloyd	Samuel_	after that, they just do an update and they'll get any newer version that goes up on the repo after that
