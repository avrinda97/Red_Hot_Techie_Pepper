2004-11-25T10:08:00.000Z	Buzzz		is there a new "official" ubuntu kernel?
2004-11-25T10:09:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	not sure. i always compile the latest from kernel.org
2004-11-25T10:09:00.000Z	Buzzz	lemsx1	ok we have to wait and see then.
2004-11-25T10:10:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	waiting is not good if you have a multi-user system... you have to get the patch and patch your own ubuntu kernel sources... it should be simple
2004-11-25T10:11:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Nov/1012165.html
2005-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	install autofs
2005-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	write a /etc/auto.filename file for you
2005-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	add a line in /etc/auto.master to get things from that new file
2005-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	and restarter autofs
2005-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	the line should read (use cifs and not smbfs):
2005-01-11T08:39:00.000Z	Buzzz	lemsx1	oki..thanks should lookup autofs then
2005-01-11T08:40:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	sharename -fstype=cifs,credentials=/home/username/.credentials.txt,rw server:/sharename
2005-01-11T08:41:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	ah, not server:/share but ://server/share
2005-01-11T08:41:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	sorry
2005-01-11T08:42:00.000Z	Buzzz	lemsx1	hmm.. autofs doesn't show up in synaptic..
2005-01-11T08:43:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	weird...
2005-01-11T08:44:00.000Z	Buzzz	lemsx1	could it be missing from hoary?
2005-01-11T08:45:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	try browsing the rep with a regular browser (or use apt-cache from the command line: apt-cache search autofs)
2005-01-11T08:45:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	hoary is the new one right? get autofs from the old package (or directly from debian)
2005-01-11T08:45:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	it should be the same stuff
2005-01-11T08:46:00.000Z	Buzzz	lemsx1	have to try that..
2005-01-11T08:47:00.000Z	lemsx1	Buzzz	ubuntu is a nice way to get Debian installed... once Debian is in place, go to Sarge rep and never install gnome-* packages :-)
