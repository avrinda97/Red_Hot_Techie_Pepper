2011-10-15T07:07:00.000Z	crooks306	imperfect-	try turning that off and see if it works.  doesn't get along with compiz
2011-10-15T07:07:00.000Z	imperfect-	crooks306	It was working before reboot....
2011-10-15T07:07:00.000Z	imperfect-		I upgraded, reboot and used the system long enough to reboot again and all hell broke loose
2011-10-15T07:07:00.000Z	crooks306	imperfect-	might have had compositing turned off
2011-10-15T07:07:00.000Z	crooks306	imperfect-	try recovery mode and go back to single head
2011-10-15T07:07:00.000Z	imperfect-	crooks306	negative, i was running top watching my zfs perforamnce and compiz was at the top of the list
2011-10-15T07:08:00.000Z	imperfect-		the upgrade went smooth
2011-10-15T07:08:00.000Z	imperfect-		I'd love to know what happened
2011-10-15T07:08:00.000Z	crooks306	imperfect-	I had the same problem and it solved it for me.  worth trying anyway
2011-10-15T07:08:00.000Z	imperfect-		programs can't talk to the dbus socket at the least
2011-10-15T07:09:00.000Z	imperfect-	crooks306	right right, the bigger problem is no network interfaces etc
2011-10-15T07:10:00.000Z	imperfect-	crooks306	I removed the twinview option from my X config -- still black screen
2011-10-15T07:11:00.000Z	crooks306	imperfect-	just reading above where you came in and I see some others were having DBUS issues.
