2007-04-26T05:18:00.000Z	icedwater		yep, rebooted :(
2007-04-26T05:19:00.000Z	icedwater		OK...
2007-04-26T05:20:00.000Z	icedwater		ahh...
2007-04-26T05:20:00.000Z	icedwater		i think my problem might have been upgrading without making sure all my programs were up-to-date..
2007-04-26T05:21:00.000Z	icedwater		well ... i upgraded from edgy
2007-04-26T05:21:00.000Z	icedwater		and metacity didn't run..
2007-04-26T05:21:00.000Z	icedwater		so i thought rebooting might help
2007-04-26T05:22:00.000Z	icedwater		and now it doesn't go past fsck-1.40 WIP
2007-04-26T05:22:00.000Z	icedwater		the new filesystem checker..
2007-04-26T05:22:00.000Z	icedwater		so I'm stuck on a Knoppix Live DVD. :(
2007-04-26T05:23:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	run e2fsck from the Knoppix CD then
2007-04-26T05:24:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	you know what I mean?
2007-04-26T05:24:00.000Z	icedwater	soundray	no, I missed it while trying to respond to a bot :(
2007-04-26T05:25:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	you can run e2fsck on your ubuntu partitions from Knoppix
2007-04-26T05:25:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	do you know how?
2007-04-26T05:26:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	unmount it, then run 'sudo e2fsck -y /dev/sda1 '
2007-04-26T05:27:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	tells it to fix the errors that it finds
2007-04-26T05:28:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	do you have any other partitions?
2007-04-26T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	okay, I guess ubuntu wasn't really hanging at the fsck then, but at whatever it does afterwards.
2007-04-26T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	icedwater	did it switch to text mode before it froze?
2007-04-26T05:32:00.000Z	icedwater	soundray	It was only in text mode..
2007-04-26T05:33:00.000Z	icedwater	soundray	The GUI interface didn't freeze, but my panels were gone and tried Ctrl-Alt-Backspace several times to restart the X server..
