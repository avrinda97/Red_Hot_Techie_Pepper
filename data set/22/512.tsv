2011-11-14T21:50:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	the makefiles will override it afaik
2011-11-14T21:52:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	for all packages?
2011-11-14T21:53:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	only for the kernel, but the makefile structure is very complicated
2011-11-14T21:53:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	what do you mean?
2011-11-14T21:54:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	the kernel has options for similar things. i wouldnt use custom cflags on it
2011-11-14T21:54:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	no, I am experimentig with kernel specifically compiled for my processor, with the -O3 --march=native flag on, to see how much we gain in term of performance
2011-11-14T21:54:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	I thought --march=native was disabling potimize for size
2011-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	well, actually generic amd64 is not very optimized
2011-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	exactly, this is what I did, but at compilation time I want to use --march=native, because I have noticed a difference on other compiled packages
2011-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	why would you not use -O3?
2011-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	probably placebo
2011-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	what do you mean?
2011-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	O3 will slow down 99.9% of packages
2011-11-14T21:56:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	why?
2011-11-14T22:00:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	I do not understand, gcc documentation suggests that -O3 is more efficient that -O2 in terms of performances
2011-11-14T22:00:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	for very processor intensive stuff it probably is
2011-11-14T22:00:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	but like i said i wouldnt use that globally
2011-11-14T22:01:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	it is a production machine used to run economic models
2011-11-14T22:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	i dont know what that involves
2011-11-14T22:02:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ct529	O3 uses more cpu cache
2011-11-14T22:02:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	very intensive numericcal calculations
2011-11-14T22:02:00.000Z	ct529	Gentoo64	sipior: so what size of cache for -O3?
