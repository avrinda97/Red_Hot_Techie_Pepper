2007-08-05T05:43:00.000Z	Jan-pp		hi, i have the following problem: when doing certain things on my ubuntu server (like apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade or ./configure in the Asterisk-sourcedir) the box freezes completely up (nothing works then, not even NUMLOCK) or randomly reboots. memtest comes up fine
2007-08-05T05:44:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	Have you had a look to see if there is anything in the logs - although with total locks sometimes there isn't
2007-08-05T05:45:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	That sounds like temperature to me
2007-08-05T05:46:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	Check your fans - if it is sometimes failing in boot it's probably not a well machine
2007-08-05T05:47:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	Have you tried running it off the live CD for a while and see if it is stable like that?
2007-08-05T05:48:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	going to do that next
2007-08-05T05:48:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	As I say, it's also worth checking the logs - /var/log/messages etc from around the time of the hang - does it do it outside of X?
2007-08-05T05:50:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	sometimes it freezes before the kernel even gets loaded, i am scanning the logs just in case,
2007-08-05T05:51:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	If it's before the kernel is loaded then it really has to be a hardware problem of some type; it could be a dying disk I guess but you normally see some errors rather than a total hang
2007-08-05T05:53:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	what could it be? ram is memtested. CPU ist doing fine. I did a find / | xargs md5sum and it worked fine (/proc etc. were excluded from the find)
2007-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	additionally, both 5 V and 12 V seem to be stable (measured using a multimeter, so no sensors etc.)
2007-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	Not sure really; I'd try taking all non-essential peripherals out and see if it stabilises; PSU is a possibility - but it's really difficult to find anything when machines just stop
2007-08-05T05:57:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	I think I'd try running off a live CD to see if it's also unstable and if it is still unstable (which I'd assume it is) then I'd see if I could try swapping the PSU
2007-08-05T05:57:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	./configure is a direct way to a freezeup - every time
2007-08-05T05:58:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	That's pretty odd, I mean ./configure is a bit CPU and disc heavy - but CPU wise shouldn't compare with your md5sum
2007-08-05T05:58:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	Is there any way to test a psu?
2007-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	I believe there are some testers; but it's about the easiest thing to swap if you think RAM is OK
2007-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	if i had a replacement handy, it would be easy...
2007-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	Nod
2007-08-05T06:04:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	find / | cat while md5'ing /dev/urandom works without crash!
2007-08-05T06:08:00.000Z	Jan-pp	penguin42	./configure now worked a single time, did it again while watching tail -f /var/log/messages - freezeup without logs...
2007-08-05T06:10:00.000Z	penguin42	Jan-pp	Ah, a heisenbug :-)
