2009-11-20T22:57:00.000Z	coachz		are ubuntu people friendly ?  :-)
2009-11-20T22:57:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	ubuntu people are people. So, mostly yes.
2009-11-20T22:58:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	Fedora has some newer software packages (newer version of Xorg for example) but its design philosophy is more geared towards geeky types who know what they are doing.
2009-11-20T22:59:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	Ubuntu (or Ubuntu-based like Mint and SuperOS) are better choices then.
2009-11-20T23:02:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	yes
2009-11-20T23:02:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	they call it amd64
2009-11-20T23:03:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	amd came up witthe x86_64 architecture so they call it amd64.
2009-11-20T23:03:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	the i386 architecture in Ubuntu is regular x86.
2009-11-20T23:08:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	just to clarify: Fedora is the development playground for Red Hat. It's not *really* meant to be used.
2009-11-20T23:09:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	depends. How much RAM do you have?
2009-11-20T23:10:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	you'll get little benefit using the 64bit version. Get the i386 Desktop image.
2009-11-20T23:10:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	only real benefit is the ability to address >4GB of RAM.
2009-11-20T23:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	unless you're going to be encoding lots of video, no real reason to use 64bit.
2009-11-20T23:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	ubuntu-9.10-desktop-i386.iso
2009-11-20T23:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	yes but... it's just extra language packs.
2009-11-20T23:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	there's also SuperOS which is a DVD-size distro with lots of extra goodies.
2009-11-20T23:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	yes
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	coachz	cellofellow	 can you help me out for a min
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	sure
2009-11-21T00:46:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	nice :)
2009-11-21T00:48:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	twinview works fine on my system but compiz does flicker when I use that large a screen. Normally doesn't bother me.
2009-11-21T00:48:00.000Z	cellofellow	coachz	oh, just sometimes things disappear which shouldn't for a millisecond or two.
