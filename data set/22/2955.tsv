2009-01-13T02:47:00.000Z	xanxor		hi, I wonder if someone could help me with an iso problem?
2009-01-13T02:47:00.000Z	xanxor		I'm trying to make an iso image of a cd I have and I can't get it to work.
2009-01-13T02:48:00.000Z	xanxor		I did that. it gets to a certain part (685 MB or something) then says Input/Output Error.
2009-01-13T02:49:00.000Z	xanxor		okay, thank you.
2009-01-13T02:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xanxor	How are you trying to do it
2009-01-13T02:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xanxor	Copy protected disk?
2009-01-13T02:50:00.000Z	xanxor	Jack_Sparrow	using the dd if/dev/cdrom thing
2009-01-13T02:50:00.000Z	xanxor		don't tihnk so
2009-01-13T02:50:00.000Z	xanxor		it's a CD-R though, does that make a difference?
2009-01-13T02:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xanxor	Should not be an issue
2009-01-13T02:51:00.000Z	xanxor		okay, I'll try the rescue thing.
2009-01-13T02:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xanxor	I am burning a disk as we speak..  so one sec
2009-01-13T02:51:00.000Z	xanxor		this should all be done with the disc unmounted, right?
2009-01-13T02:51:00.000Z	xanxor		that's what the tutorial I found said.
2009-01-13T02:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xanxor	Hold for just a couple minutes.. if it is mounted can you right clicjk the drive icon and create image
2009-01-13T02:52:00.000Z	xanxor		No.
2009-01-13T02:52:00.000Z	xanxor		that option doesn't appear.
2009-01-13T02:53:00.000Z	xanxor		I'm installing ddrescue to see if that helps.
2009-01-13T02:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xanxor	right click the disc icon on your screen click copy create image and not burn an copy
2009-01-13T02:56:00.000Z	xanxor	Jack_Sparrow	like I said, that option does not come up when I right click,.
2009-01-13T02:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	xanxor	Do you have cd icon on your desktop
2009-01-13T02:57:00.000Z	xanxor	Jack_Sparrow	hang on, just trying it with dd_rescue. I'll try yours if that doesn't work. thanks.
