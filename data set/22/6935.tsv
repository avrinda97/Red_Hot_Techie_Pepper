2006-06-19T05:25:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	try plugging a cable between your capture card and your sound card
2006-06-19T05:25:00.000Z	BCK	nosklo	i have one :P
2006-06-19T05:25:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	turn up your sound cards volume using gnome volume manager
2006-06-19T05:26:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	double click volume in panel, near the clock, and turn up ALL sliders
2006-06-19T05:26:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	including the one that says "Line In" or something
2006-06-19T05:28:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	true
2006-06-19T05:28:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	specially since your sound card that is doing the work, not the capture card
2006-06-19T05:28:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	other sound plays ok?
2006-06-19T05:29:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	do you have another external source of sound to plug into the same plug on your sound card that your capture card is plugged in, just to test it?
2006-06-19T05:29:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	like, an MP3 player or something
2006-06-19T05:30:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	well if you plug another stuff instead of your capture card on the cable, you hear sound
2006-06-19T05:31:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	ok, then you must turn on the volume on the capture card somehow
2006-06-19T05:31:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	try switching channel :P
2006-06-19T05:33:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	on the volume manager (double click volume), under file -> change device, does your capture card shows up there?
2006-06-19T05:33:00.000Z	BCK	nosklo	the slider was at the bottom still no change :(
2006-06-19T06:20:00.000Z	BCK	nosklo	got it working :)
2006-06-19T06:21:00.000Z	nosklo	BCK	what was it?
