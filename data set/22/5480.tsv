2007-04-25T12:21:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	I would just tell dbxwanderer "download. double-click. type host. click ok"
2007-04-25T12:21:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	then dbxwanderer would say, "it keeps asking for a username and password"
2007-04-25T12:23:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	I actually have a tutorial with screenshots for dbxwanderer --I sent it to my family in email.  I don't know if I still have it.  If I can package it and zip it over to dbxwanderer or post it somewhere (my web site is dusty and unmaintained), it might help.
2007-04-25T12:26:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	that web 2.0 stuff?
2007-04-25T12:27:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	Not sure what you mean -- I was making a joke about symantic.  (I don't believe in Web 2.0, not sure what it is or that it even exists. :P )
2007-04-25T12:27:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	you know... the new symantic web
2007-04-25T12:28:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	Heaven help us if Symantec is taking over the web!  :P
2007-04-25T12:29:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	could be the synaptic web
2007-04-25T12:30:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	does apt start sshd?
2007-04-25T12:31:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	I don't know if it starts it.  I was going to tell dbxwanderer to type "ps -ef | grep sshd" , but thought it would be simpler to just run it --what the heck if there are two copies running.
2007-04-25T12:31:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	where are you in this process?
2007-04-25T12:31:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	oops. I meant dbxwanderer
2007-04-25T12:31:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	I'm assuming that dbxwanderer has just installed sshd but hasn't yet started it running...
2007-04-25T12:32:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	right. it would be nice to hear from dbxwanderer
2007-04-25T12:34:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	Wow, you guys are more advanced than me.  I defer to your expertise.
2007-04-25T12:34:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	dbxwanderer: grrr. no chkconfig
2007-04-25T12:34:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	I tried that command -- "sudo: chkconfig: command not found"
2007-04-25T12:40:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	By "ubuntu" I guess you mean the console?  Is that what it's called in GNOME?  Hmm.  (Don't bother answering, I'm just thinking out loud.)
2007-04-25T13:02:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	no
2007-04-25T13:02:00.000Z	kwtm	s34n_	Hey, where can I post a PNG file for people to see?  Is Imageshack any good?
2007-04-25T13:03:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	no idean on web hosting
2007-04-25T13:04:00.000Z	s34n_	kwtm	layers is a good place to start when people think yahoo is their browser
