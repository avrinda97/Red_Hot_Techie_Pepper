2007-06-07T10:55:00.000Z	pike_	Pirate_Hunter	youll want to gksu gedit /etc/fstab  and see if they are in there. sorry dont know gnome gui
2007-06-07T10:56:00.000Z	pike_	Pirate_Hunter	it will look horribly confusing since we are using uuid now but dont fear
2007-07-04T05:52:00.000Z	pike_	Pirate_Hunter	sudo cfdisk /dev/hdb  or c or d or a   that is the tool for creating partitions. sudo -i then type mkfs and hittab a few times for all the mkfs.format commands then for example mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1  be CAREFUL with that make sure you are formatting the correct partition
2007-07-04T05:52:00.000Z	pike_	Pirate_Hunter	that is the termial option i dunno gui tools very well
2007-07-06T13:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	pike_	if you use automatix like i do remeber to uninstall everything form automatix and not synaptic as automatix still keeps reference to those apps and etc its a hassle but if you follow instruction yeha it cna be used properly
2007-07-13T16:59:00.000Z	pike_	Pirate_Hunter	lspci -v | grep -i vga or sudo lshw  are two ways
2007-07-13T05:00:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	pike_	will try
2007-08-30T15:40:00.000Z	pike_	Pirate_Hunter	yeah youll just select kde or gnome at login screen by clicking 'sessions' button
2007-10-19T21:21:00.000Z	pike_	Pirate_Hunter	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
