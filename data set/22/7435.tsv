2006-04-13T16:44:00.000Z	munzir		Hi, I am connecting to the internet through a router via an ethernet cable (eth1: 192.168.1.253) as well as a wireless connection (eth0: 192.168.1.64). How should I specify which connection is used when I browse a site?
2006-04-13T16:46:00.000Z	munzir		default         speedtouch.lan  0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
2006-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	2 connections to the internet :P
2006-04-13T16:44:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	u need to specify the default gateway
2006-04-13T16:45:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	system -> admin -> networking
2006-04-13T16:45:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	change the default gateway device to eth0 or eth1
2006-04-13T16:46:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	netstat -r shows default         speedtouch.lan  0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth1
2006-04-13T16:50:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	 in Networking it's set to eth1 but why then netstat -r shows both, please?
2006-04-13T16:51:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	my netstat -r shows my gateway computer then the default connection (eth0)
2006-04-13T16:52:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	so you don't have two default connections like me?
2006-04-13T16:53:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	ill but it in chan #flood
2006-04-13T16:55:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	I pasted to you how mine looks
2006-04-13T16:56:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	thats crazy
2006-04-13T16:57:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	there is something wrong, eh?
2006-04-13T16:57:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	yes definately it seems to me that its trying to connect twice
2006-04-13T16:58:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	now if I disconnect the ethernet should I still be connected via wireless?
2006-04-13T16:58:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	may be I have a nice load balanced system ;)
2006-04-13T16:59:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	i was just about to suggest turning one of them off
2006-04-13T16:59:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	speed*2!!!
2006-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	what do you mean by speed*2?
2006-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	munzir	Killgore	yes it's funny! ok I will disconnect the ethernet now and see whether the wireless would work
2006-04-13T05:10:00.000Z	Killgore	munzir	wont the enet be faster?
