2007-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	dylock		ug, apparently in reinstalling my nvidia driver i lost my sound
2007-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	dylock		it took me almost 2 weeks to get my sound working last time
2007-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	dylock		yea
2007-03-23T11:12:00.000Z	dylock		but i dunno, all i know is my sound no longer works
2007-03-23T11:12:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	sometimes you can use alsaconf to correct sound card issues
2007-03-23T11:13:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	you can always download alsacaonf
2007-03-23T11:15:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	do a search for alsa
2007-03-23T11:16:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	you run alsaconf as root from a separate login window before you log in to X (that's how I do it, and it gives me less problems)
2007-03-23T11:19:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	let me check the net for a sec
2007-03-23T11:24:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	I use alsaconf on debian 3.1 on my p4 box, but it may be deprecated.
2007-03-23T11:25:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	have you tried setting volume controls?
2007-03-23T11:27:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	 hmmm...have you tried rebooting the x server?
2007-03-23T11:27:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	 sometimes x will do weird things.
2007-03-23T11:27:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	x can affect many things on occasion
2007-03-23T11:28:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	ya...weird
2007-03-23T11:29:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	linux modules can be touchy at times
2007-03-23T11:29:00.000Z	dylock	Firefishe	how would i check to see if any modules were effected?
2007-03-23T11:29:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	a quick and dirty fix would be to download and install everything with alsa in the title ;)
2007-03-23T11:29:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	I still think alsaconf should be there
2007-03-23T11:32:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	you need to do "su alsaconf" for it to work
2007-03-23T11:33:00.000Z	dylock	Firefishe	still doesn't exist
2007-03-23T11:33:00.000Z	Firefishe	dylock	 if alsa-utils package is installed, try /usr/bin/alsaconf directly
