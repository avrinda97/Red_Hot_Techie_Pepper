2007-08-08T07:04:00.000Z	tacos		I am new to ubuntu and linux
2007-08-08T07:05:00.000Z	tacos		I installed ubuntu and the updates, which gave me firefox. firefox said i needed the java plugin
2007-08-08T07:05:00.000Z	tacos		i installed the firefox plugin as instructed but it messed up
2007-08-08T07:06:00.000Z	tacos		whenever I go to a page that has flash firefox just instantly closes itself
2007-08-08T07:06:00.000Z	tacos		java6
2007-08-08T07:06:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	Try sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts in a terminal ;)
2007-08-08T07:07:00.000Z	tacos	ShackJack	ok that will work? should I erase the folders that the bin made?
2007-08-08T07:07:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	Are you trying to install java or flash?
2007-08-08T07:08:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts    --- you can nuke any bins if they are on your desktop or home dir or something, otherwise I wouldn't bother with themm.
2007-08-08T07:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	If you didn't have flash installed a visit to this page should take care of it... http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_15507
2007-08-08T07:09:00.000Z	tacos	ShackJack	but what I'm asking is -- I already installed something somehow using the steps outlined on the flash install page but it didn't work... I don't know how to remove it
2007-08-08T07:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	Why do you keep mentioning flash?
2007-08-08T07:10:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	If the stuff on your desktop or home dir just delete, otherwise don't worry about it...
2007-08-08T07:15:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	Yeah, they needn't be the ones I gave are much simpler, actually you can just sudo aptitude install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2007-08-08T07:16:00.000Z	tacos	ShackJack	how can I uninstall that bin's install? thanks too.
2007-08-08T07:17:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	I would think you can look it up in synaptic and remove... See status... and locally instaleld...
2007-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	Yes... aptitude is more or less the same... like apt-get +
2007-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	yes...
2007-08-08T07:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	.conf files are often found in hidden folders in your /home directory...
2007-08-08T07:25:00.000Z	tacos	ShackJack	this is a conf file meant to be edited, does that make a difference
2007-08-08T07:25:00.000Z	tacos	ShackJack	also, what's the command to see the hidden folders? ls -a ?
2007-08-08T07:26:00.000Z	ShackJack	tacos	Not necessarily, no...  you can always use find...  yes -a  and ctrl H in nautilus
