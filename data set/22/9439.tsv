2005-06-06T13:47:00.000Z	Arrogant		Yes, I know how to get back
2005-06-06T13:47:00.000Z	Arrogant		it said something about a tty thing
2005-06-06T13:48:00.000Z	Arrogant		I don't know very much about Unix at all :(
2005-06-06T13:48:00.000Z	Arrogant		Yeah I figured
2005-06-06T13:48:00.000Z	Arrogant		So uh, what's a tty?

2005-06-06T13:49:00.000Z	Arrogant		Thoreau is not theraputic btw.
2005-06-06T13:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	whatever you say :)
2005-06-06T13:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	that's more a comment on you than Thoreau, old boy
2005-06-06T13:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	try reading "Civil Disobedience"
2005-06-06T13:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	Gandhi was inspired by it
2005-06-06T14:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	yeah, weird concept ;-)
2005-06-06T14:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	that's Ubuntu's version of "lockin" ;-)
2005-06-06T14:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	i have an iBook g4 running Ubuntu ( I hardly ever boot into OS-X )
2005-06-06T14:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	only down side is the Broadcom wireless isn't supported in Linux
2005-06-06T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	I played with OS-X, but I prefer Linux
2005-06-06T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	anyway I can use mac-on-linux for OS-X if I want to
2005-06-06T14:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	not problems really - I like to use nfs and it's a pain to set up on OS-X
2005-06-06T14:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	evidently
2005-06-06T14:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Arrogant	tell her to RTFM ;)
