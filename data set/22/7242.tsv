2011-06-23T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	it's in use so you can't remove it
2011-06-23T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	when you unmount it, it will get removed automatically
2011-06-23T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	sudo blkid
2011-06-24T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	I've seen that before with a bug in some ati drivers and an nvidia one
2011-06-24T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	the obvious stuff, if it is the same problem is look at your video card and the xorg drivers it's using
2011-06-24T16:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	as I suggested earlier, that was a known issue with an ati driver set and card earlier, and I believe nvidia had a similar issue at one point
2011-06-24T16:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	possibly, possibly not, if depends if it's the same problem
2011-07-18T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	you need to use gnokii
2011-07-18T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	it's the tool used to communicate with supported nokia phones
2011-07-18T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	did you configure it ?
2011-07-18T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	did you read or research ANYTHING about it
2011-07-18T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	no - not a second
2011-07-18T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	you don't learn/research something in "a sec"
2011-07-28T17:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	nothing to do wtih ubuntu
2011-07-28T17:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	it's different for each phone
2011-07-28T17:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	nothing to do with ubuntu, so we don't discuss it here
2011-07-28T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	use gnokki
2011-07-28T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	then it's not supported
2011-07-28T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	look what devices gnokii supports (I used to do it with an E71 and E72 without issue)
2011-07-28T17:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Clerisy	you've tried....yet you've just asked me how to use it, that suggests you've not tried
