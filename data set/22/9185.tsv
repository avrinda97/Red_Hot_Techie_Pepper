2005-02-10T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis		looking at the vnc logs now
2005-02-10T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis		on reading of the vncserver script (yes its just a fancy script) its looking in 2 places forits config files.. i'd say copy the /etc/vnc.conf to ~/.vncrc
2005-02-10T09:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis		and then start twiddling :P
2005-02-10T09:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis		I can rember 2 pane file managers befor 'nortons comander' even existed.
2005-02-10T09:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis		mc is so handy. "midnight commander"
2005-02-10T09:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis		:P
2005-02-10T09:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	try 'krusader' if you can
2005-02-10T09:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Xenguy	 yes i think i used tha talso.
2005-02-10T09:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	meant for ecio I think
2005-02-10T10:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Xenguy	 sounds exactly like vnc. :P
2005-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	It's been a long time since I vnc'd into a linux box -- I use 'screen' every day tho ;-)
2005-02-10T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Xenguy	 heh - i tend to vnc to the pc's downstairs allthe time
2005-02-10T10:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	hahah
2005-02-10T10:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	I've recently heard of this 'FreeNX' tool (a faster VNC I hear), but received errors trying to connect as a client from work unfortunately
2005-02-10T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Xenguy	 where theers 'vnc' 'tightvnc' and 'ultravnc' out now also - Ultra is a server for windows however.
2005-02-10T10:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	UV has an encryption plug-in I believe, which sounds useful
2005-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	never heard of it
2005-02-10T10:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	re: x11vnc: too bad; it sounded promising
2005-02-10T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Xenguy	 it was slow as heck also...
2005-02-10T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Xenguy	 better to plan ahead and use the real vncserver - i dont see how x11vnc would let you log off box 1 and kep X going either.
2005-02-10T10:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	tx for the tips; I think I'll keep experimenting with FreeNX in the short run, see if I can get it to work for me
2007-02-23T11:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dr_willis	to the parefect operating system!
