2006-12-27T16:21:00.000Z	holycow		and get their opinion too
2006-12-27T16:21:00.000Z	holycow		people here beg to differ of course but most don't actually run production servers :)
2006-12-27T16:22:00.000Z	cafuego__	holycow	There's no problem with running it as a server at all. See, you can get PAID support from the manufacturer.
2006-12-27T16:24:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	we will agree to disagree for the most part, i will agree with you on the core set of apps that are officially supported.  if ones services are dependent ONLY on those absolutely.
2006-12-27T16:25:00.000Z	cafuego__	holycow	thing is, a lot of companies aren't interested in "you get get support via mailing lists or on irc". Debian is good, and if you have a sysadmin with half a brain it's not an issue, but sometimes corporate policy just doesn't allow the use of Debian, thus Redhat & Ubuntu.
2006-12-27T16:25:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	i run support for a few of those
2006-12-27T16:25:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	its not so cut and dry
2006-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	cafuego__	holycow	Kinda is down here.
2006-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	cafuego__	holycow	banks for instance don't run Debian in their production environment.
2006-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	absolutely, i will agree with you there
2006-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	of course
2006-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	and thats really only beacuse ibm doesn' offer official suppot
2006-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	cafuego__	holycow	But they'll happily run Redhat or Ubuntu
2006-12-27T16:27:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	but then my clients arent banks
2006-12-27T16:27:00.000Z	holycow		heh
2006-12-27T16:27:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	they will run ubunut? wow.  bit of a revelation :) i wanna deal with a bank that runs ubuntu
2006-12-27T16:27:00.000Z	holycow		heh
2006-12-27T16:27:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	i find the corporate environment a lot more porous
2006-12-27T16:27:00.000Z	cafuego__	holycow	same goes for some ISPs, they won't run it in production if they can't get support from the vendor.
2006-12-27T16:28:00.000Z	holycow	cafuego	its just that you can't walk in and magically swap servers over
2006-12-27T16:28:00.000Z	holycow		its about building long term relatioships and support and backing it up
2006-12-27T16:28:00.000Z	cafuego__	holycow	now small busienss are a whole different kettle-o-fish
