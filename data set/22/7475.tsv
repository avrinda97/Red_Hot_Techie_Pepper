2006-03-30T13:41:00.000Z	Arafangion		Where can I find javac on my system?
2006-03-30T13:41:00.000Z	Arafangion		(I already have java installed, and Eclipse works flawlessly, I just can't find javac)
2006-03-30T13:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	you probably only have the JRE installed, you need the SDK for javac
2006-03-30T13:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	for fun, try which javac at a prompt
2006-03-30T13:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	So how does Eclipse still compile it properly?
2006-03-30T13:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	well then check in Eclipse configuration which one its using
2006-03-30T13:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	Well, "javac" doesn't appear in my path at all.
2006-03-30T13:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	could be that Eclipse has its own, not sure. Haven't installed Eclipse on ubuntu yet.
2006-03-30T13:43:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	That is a posibility I did not consider.
2006-03-30T13:45:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	Interesting, "find / -iname javac" results in NO results, not even in eclipse's directory!
2006-03-30T13:46:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	see what it is in Eclipse's build settings. Are you compiling java programs in Eclipse?
2006-03-30T13:46:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	Yes.
2006-10-01T05:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	Indeed, though, the statement of discussion is "used to use".
2006-10-01T05:36:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	My guess is he's got one of those usb modems.
2006-10-01T05:37:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	Use single quotes, bash can sometimes expand the double-quotes.
2006-10-01T05:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	yeah, good point. Thanks.
2006-10-01T05:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	WoW is pretty much _the_ canonical game they test with, afaik.
2006-10-01T05:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	"they" = who?
2006-10-01T05:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	Well, it was "tested" at the latest wine conference, afaik.
2006-10-01T05:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Arafangion	ati and nvida. Missing mini map, etc.
2007-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	Ubuntu's fancy replacement for the debian-style bootscripts.
2007-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	Arafangion	fyrestrtr	A good idea, for laptops, though.
