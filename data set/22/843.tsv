2011-02-24T16:34:00.000Z	Raj007		A little off-topic, what should be my next distro after i've "re-learned" Linux? I installed this so it would be easier for me to learn.
2011-02-24T16:34:00.000Z	Raj007		well re-learned as in, gained a little proficiency
2011-02-24T16:34:00.000Z	Raj007		or Ubuntu is "the one"
2011-02-24T16:35:00.000Z	Raj007		Mostly dev work only. c/c++/html/Java
2011-02-24T16:36:00.000Z	Raj007		Noone recommended Debian :) heh
2011-02-24T16:36:00.000Z	Raj007		But yeah i did hear about Arch, i got to take a look into it :)
2011-02-24T16:37:00.000Z	Raj007		that's what i want :)
2011-02-24T16:37:00.000Z	Raj007		No harm in VM'ing it and trying Fedora/Arch.
2011-02-24T16:38:00.000Z	Raj007		ofcourse in a month or so :)
2011-02-24T16:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	Raj007	if your a c++ programer you might like gento http://www.gentoo.org/
2011-02-24T16:41:00.000Z	Raj007	sacarlson	will look into that too.
2011-02-24T16:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	Raj007	it's probly not what you want but to monitor my network I use cacti ,  cacti will also monitor mem usage and a few other things on my local system but I also use it to monitor remote system usage
2011-02-24T16:45:00.000Z	Raj007	sacarlson	any recommendation is good, let me look into it.
2011-02-24T16:47:00.000Z	Raj007	sacarlson	you were right, that's not what i need but a very useful tool indeed for remote system monitoring.
2011-02-24T16:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	Raj007	ya it's graphics are cool you can zoom in and out from 5 minits to 2 years ago
2011-02-24T16:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	Raj007	I use it to monitor network bandwidth at different points on my net so I can tell what is using what bandwidth and how long something didn't work
2011-03-06T16:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	Raj007	I do a search in synaptic for undel and I see three packages that might work but I've never tried them recover, maicrescue, e2undel
2011-03-06T16:49:00.000Z	Raj007	sacarlson	it wasn't me looking for it, to be honest. I wanted to know if it's possible. It was s7r who wanted to know.
2011-03-06T16:49:00.000Z	Raj007	sacarlson	and he quit.
2011-03-06T16:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	Raj007	sorry I don't look back far enuf
2011-03-06T16:50:00.000Z	Raj007	sacarlson	no apologies. I don't like them. By you mentioning all those undelete utilities in the channel, you probably helped someone who might use it.
2011-03-06T16:50:00.000Z	Raj007	sacarlson	heck yeah tons of them on NTFS
