2007-05-26T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	apt-cache search
2007-05-27T07:45:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	set it to ""
2007-05-27T07:45:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	does "" make it have no password?
2007-05-27T07:46:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	what does that do?
2007-05-27T07:50:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	just set an empty password
2007-05-27T07:50:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	it won't let me - it says I need at least 6 characters
2007-05-27T07:51:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	use "sudo password $user_name" after its created
2007-05-27T07:51:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	ooh! maybe that'll work
2007-05-27T07:51:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	its just the gnome-tool thats stopping you
2007-05-27T07:52:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	wat's the gnome-tool? and password isn't a command
2007-05-27T07:52:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	its "passwd" sorry
2007-05-27T07:52:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	: ok. h/o
2007-05-27T07:53:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	it still needs a password
2007-05-27T07:54:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	I see, well you can either edit the password policy in /etc/login.defs or edit /etc/shadow directly to remove the password
2007-05-27T07:54:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	how do I do that?
2007-05-27T07:54:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	edit the file /etc/login.defs to change the policy
2007-05-27T07:55:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	or empty the password field in /etc/shadow
2007-05-27T07:55:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	ikonia	how do I do that?
2007-05-27T07:55:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	I've just told ou
2007-05-27T07:57:00.000Z	ikonia	tux_wears_a_tux	perhaps read before typing random commands you have no idea
