2007-04-21T08:10:00.000Z	atlantia		so modprobe -l says ipw3945, but no wireless devices exist, according to iwconfig
2007-04-21T08:10:00.000Z	atlantia		what do i do?
2007-04-21T08:12:00.000Z	seamus7	atlantia	have you enabled it in Networking or through the Network Manager
2007-04-21T08:13:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	let me check one se
2007-04-21T08:14:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	doesn't show up, even though the module is loaded, and a new set of processes have shown up in ps -A
2007-04-21T08:14:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	ipw3945 based processes*
2007-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	seamus7	atlantia	hmmm i'm on ipw3945 and it worked by default on feisty
2007-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	seamus7	atlantia	sorry i wish i could help you further but i'm not that advanced
2007-04-21T08:30:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	ok so updat: got it working, but it is STRANGE: when i hit f2 it actuvates radio (no light) dmesg complains, saying it should be turned off to work, but than i used iwconfig to set essid, and than turned it off and it worked
2007-04-21T08:30:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	i guess my question is, how do i make this p[aractical, i used connectoin-manager in edgy
2007-04-21T08:30:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	practical*
2007-04-21T08:33:00.000Z	seamus7	atlantia	hmmm.. with mine.. on boot up ... Network Manager appears in the notification area and looks for wireless netowrks ... I had set one up previously and included the ESSID and password, etc... network manager does this automatically ... Do you have nm-applet under Sessions/StartUp Programs?
2007-04-21T08:33:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	heh Network Manager still says I dont have a wireless device
2007-04-21T08:33:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	but networking dialog in admin does
2007-04-21T08:34:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	nm it is there now
2007-04-21T08:34:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	let me reboot and see what happens
2007-04-21T08:34:00.000Z	seamus7	atlantia	in Manual Configuration (which is Networking under the System menu) set all of your interfaces to roaming
2007-04-21T08:35:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	( i have not even figured out how i am going to get nvidia latest working yet with envy gone... may have to start over onthat experience, d/l from nvidia etc)
2007-04-21T08:35:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	ok will do let me do that and reboot, see what works and what doesn't
2007-04-21T08:48:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	ha i had installed network-manager package. Removed, all is acting as intended now
2007-04-21T08:48:00.000Z	seamus7	atlantia	great
2007-04-21T08:49:00.000Z	atlantia	seamus7	ty for help, on to nvidia latest
