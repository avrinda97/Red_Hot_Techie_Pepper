2010-06-08T12:38:00.000Z	Kamilion		Then the fans need replacement; prefereably with a better quality unit with decent bearings.
2010-06-08T12:38:00.000Z	Kamilion		I get a lot of dells and HPs with stuck fans.
2010-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	Kamilion		If the fan is spinning slowly, User01, you should try to find a replacement cooler. And make sure you use good thermal compound like Artic Silver 5 or something
2010-06-08T12:41:00.000Z	Kamilion		HAHAHAH yes! It IS! I HATE the DV series for that.
2010-06-08T12:42:00.000Z	Kamilion		those cases are such PITAs.
2010-06-08T12:43:00.000Z	Kamilion		the problem is, you have to get just the right MXM cooler for the right card
2010-06-08T12:43:00.000Z	Kamilion		you're usually better off replacing the MXM card entirely sometimes, they're that model-specific.
2010-06-08T12:45:00.000Z	Kamilion		It's not a matter of can, it's a matter of will/won't. I watched my ten year old niece build a beautiful amd desktop rig and install ubuntu on it, in less than an hour, with no help from me other than pointing out the little paper motherboard washers.
2010-06-08T12:46:00.000Z	Kamilion		She could barely understand windows; and yet with nothing more than a phillips screwdriver and the instructions "everything only goes together one way, it's all logical, just take your time".
2010-06-08T12:46:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	nice if that is true, what are the specs?
2010-06-08T12:48:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	nice very nice I guess its possible if I can make the lil ones like ubuntu by removing any other OS choices I guess this is possible and they are dam happy about it :)
2010-06-08T12:49:00.000Z	Kamilion	Pirate_Hunter	Eh, I just kill the top panel and set the bottom panel to resemble windows 7 and most of my users can barely tell the difference with crossover office and wine.
2010-06-08T12:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	that could work if your users arent using apps like dreamweaver, expression web, CS* etc and your bothered to move the libraries over
2010-06-08T12:51:00.000Z	Kamilion	Pirate_Hunter	They are. CS3.
2010-06-08T12:52:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	that works well with wine? I am very surprised...
2010-06-08T12:53:00.000Z	Kamilion	Pirate_Hunter	Nope -- crossover office for CS3.
2010-06-08T12:53:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	Ahhh should've guess haven't used those in a long time why not just vm the window apps for all your users?
2010-06-08T12:54:00.000Z	Kamilion	Pirate_Hunter	They complain about network performance of remote desktop solutions.
2010-06-08T12:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	ah guess you can't make everyone happy I just tend to remove the option to make choices (that is when I can get away with it) either use it or don't simple as that
2010-06-08T12:56:00.000Z	Kamilion	Pirate_Hunter	The other part is, I'm free to give them the finger and laugh in their face as well.
2010-06-08T12:57:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	that could work I actually laughed how many times i've thought about doing the same, oh you just made my morning thanks
2010-06-08T13:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Kamilion	thanks didn't know and yes would be nice if someone added that to topic but I wonder how many actually read the topic
