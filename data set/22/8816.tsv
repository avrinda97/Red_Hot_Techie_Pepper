2005-06-17T09:29:00.000Z	Eddie		Hi hi people
2005-06-17T09:30:00.000Z	Eddie		network install?
2005-06-17T09:30:00.000Z	zanaga	Eddie	booting from what?
2005-06-17T09:30:00.000Z	Eddie	zanaga	the network, as far as I know theres an option to boot from another pc to which youre networked
2005-06-17T09:30:00.000Z	zanaga	Eddie	network server.. stupid me, you solved my problems
2005-06-17T09:30:00.000Z	zanaga	Eddie	thanks, you saved my day..
2005-06-17T09:30:00.000Z	Eddie	zanaga	why the lack of CD drive?
2005-06-17T09:31:00.000Z	Eddie	zanaga	lol, when last I checked the channel name wasnt #sarcasm
2005-06-17T09:31:00.000Z	zanaga	Eddie	the computer has a CD drive, but i can't make a boot cd
2005-06-17T09:31:00.000Z	Eddie	zanaga	well it might be possible to still install
2005-06-17T09:32:00.000Z	Eddie	zanaga	you could perhaps mount the image from another partition during isntall
2005-06-17T09:32:00.000Z	Eddie		*install
2005-06-17T09:32:00.000Z	Eddie		not sure if ubuntu can
2005-06-17T09:32:00.000Z	zanaga	Eddie	yeah, but the problem is that i want to install ubuntu today and i'm too lazy to head off to a friends place to burn a cd
2005-06-17T09:32:00.000Z	Eddie		debian once could
2005-06-17T09:32:00.000Z	zanaga		but the network boot will be enough.. (assuming that the nic can do PXE)
2005-06-17T09:32:00.000Z	Eddie		theres also the usb media option
2005-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	Eddie		if you unpacked the ISO onto a usb media of sufficient size
2005-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	Eddie		chances are it can boot from it
2005-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	zanaga	Eddie	last i tried to boot from an usb stick i failed miserably, i'm assuming that my stick is incapable of booting =(
2005-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	Eddie		my computer used to hang trying to boot from my camera lol
2005-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	Eddie	zanaga	=( damn, that was the cleanest option
