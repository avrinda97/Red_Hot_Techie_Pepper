2011-10-24T12:59:00.000Z	Newbeeans	Starminn	speaking of software center...Where is it?
2011-10-24T12:59:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2011-10-24T12:59:00.000Z	Newbeeans	Starminn	 How do I find out?
2011-10-24T13:00:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	When did you install it? How long ago?
2011-10-24T13:02:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	Which does it resemble of these: http://tinyurl.com/3rltrfl http://tinyurl.com/3qxmru3 or http://tinyurl.com/3flgtfc
2011-10-24T13:02:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	I assume everything's still pretty default when you're choosing from those
2011-10-24T13:04:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	If you are using the classic GNOME interface, it is in Applcations -> Ubuntu Software Center; if you are in Unity it should be a little shopping bag icon on the sidebar if you are in GNOME shell it is in Application->Ubuntu Software Center
2011-10-24T13:04:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	(Those possibilities are why I was trying to pinpoint your version. ;)
2011-10-24T13:07:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	One the left-hand side, right? So it should be about halfway down as a little shopping bag. IF you can't see it, just click on the top icon in the sidebar and type in "software center"
2011-10-24T13:07:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	Looks like this by default: http://cdn.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/softwarecenter.png
2011-10-24T13:08:00.000Z	Newbeeans	Starminn	I will try after a brief restart. Nothing is opening even thought my web isn't frozen.
2011-10-24T13:08:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	Okay. Logging out may suffice though.
2011-10-24T13:11:00.000Z	Newbeeans	Starminn	I am running the update tool. I may have to wait for that to complete.
2011-10-24T13:14:00.000Z	Newbeeans	Starminn	Am I suppose to be on a laptop with Ubuntu?
2011-10-24T13:15:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	To do what? Access the Software Center?
2011-10-24T13:15:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	Umm.... Yes....
2011-10-24T13:16:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	Oh, you mean laptop vs. desktop -- no it doesn't matter
2011-10-24T13:17:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	IF you have the sidebar on the left then if you just push the Ubuntu symbol (first icon in the sidebar) it should bring up a search bar and some large icons. Just type "software center" in it and it should find it.
2011-10-24T13:18:00.000Z	Newbeeans	Starminn	Yes. I took your advice previously...worked great....I think the update is preventing opening application. I am waiting :-))
2011-10-24T13:19:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	Ah, okay. :) Yeah, and the Software Center is probably the slowest program to load on the entire system, so it may take awhile especially with updates running too.
2011-10-24T13:22:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	I'm just a casual user. I stay away from the command-line when possible. Too much memorizing commands for me -- I've got other things to worry about as it is. :)
2011-11-04T10:27:00.000Z	Starminn	Newbeeans	imagebin.org is usually a common one
