2011-07-04T10:30:00.000Z	wildbat		If i am in terminal inside a sshfs mounted directory. If the connection broken, the terminal will be hanged. is there a nice way out , instead of killing the terminal ?
2011-07-04T10:32:00.000Z	din	wildbat	~.
2011-07-04T10:33:00.000Z	wildbat	din	that's for ssh ~  i am in sshfs
2011-07-04T10:33:00.000Z	din	wildbat	ah, sorry. hmmm
2011-07-04T10:34:00.000Z	din	wildbat	 cd .. ?? :)
2011-07-04T10:34:00.000Z	wildbat		the terminal hanged :<  ~ can't type ;p
2011-07-04T10:35:00.000Z	din		how about ctrl \
2011-07-04T10:35:00.000Z	wildbat	din	let me try
2011-07-04T10:37:00.000Z	wildbat	din	nope~
2011-07-04T10:37:00.000Z	din	wildbat	if sshfs disconnects, it is like pulling the filesystem out from under a running process. it may respond at all unless you just kill the shell.
2011-07-04T10:37:00.000Z	din		may not*
2011-07-04T10:38:00.000Z	wildbat	din	kk ~ just thought there may be a nicer way out ^^ ~ nvm then
2011-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	din	wildbat	when i use sshfs i always use -o reconnect
2011-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	wildbat	din	not always work ~
2011-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	din		in case it does disconnect
2011-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	din		yeah i understand, if your endpoint is unreachable.
2011-07-04T10:40:00.000Z	wildbat	din	and if the connections dropped for too long ~
2011-07-04T10:40:00.000Z	din	wildbat	lately i have been using autofs + sshfs. you should check it out.
2011-07-04T10:41:00.000Z	din	wildbat	yes, such is the way of network filesystems. :)
2011-07-04T10:42:00.000Z	wildbat		din ~ autofs ~ hmm ~ used to use it when i am using with Windows shares~ have never use it with sshfs~ hmmm
2011-07-04T10:45:00.000Z	din	wildbat	it is quite handy. i have a netbook with limited storage, so i use it to mount my /home directory on my home "server".
2011-07-04T10:50:00.000Z	wildbat	din	don't your system hang if the connection broken?
