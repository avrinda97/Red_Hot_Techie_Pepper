2008-03-23T03:41:00.000Z	underdawg		how do I diagnose why my network just stopped working on my ubuntu all of the sudden (using active windows computer on network now)
2008-03-23T03:41:00.000Z	underdawg		please pm me if you can help
2008-03-23T03:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	best to keep questions in channel as you'll get more help. is it wired or wireless?
2008-03-23T03:45:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	my network connection is wired
2008-03-23T03:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	open a terminal and type 'ifconfig'
2008-03-23T03:49:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	do you want me to pastebin?
2008-03-23T03:50:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	nothing yet. is there anything under inet address?
2008-03-23T03:51:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	did you get that last one?
2008-03-23T03:51:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	k. well let's see if the router is talking to you. let's ask for an ip address 'sudo dhclient eth1' (if it's on eth1 it may be eth0)
2008-03-23T03:53:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	what do you want to know?
2008-03-23T03:54:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	did you run the 'sudo dhclient eth0' ?
2008-03-23T03:54:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	yes
2008-03-23T03:54:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	it said that there's no dhcpoffers received
2008-03-23T03:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	Ah. but when you then run ifconfig does it still have an ip address?
2008-03-23T03:56:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	I've manually config'd my computer for that ip because my Buffalo isn't running DHCP - only my Netgear is (remember It's a wirelss bridge)
2008-03-23T03:56:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	well you may have set that statically. did you?
2008-03-23T03:57:00.000Z	underdawg	gyaresu	yes  - i should tell you I have an eth0:avah showing up?  it seems to be getting a 169.x.x.x ip
2008-03-23T03:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	Ah.
2008-03-23T03:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	yessum.
2008-03-23T03:58:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	You have a route problem.
2008-03-23T03:59:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	I'm not sure what you've got. I don't remember reading about a "(remember It's a wirelss bridge)"
2008-03-23T04:01:00.000Z	gyaresu	underdawg	not left to yourself. you will need to outline the problem a bit more.
