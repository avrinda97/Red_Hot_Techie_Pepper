2008-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	NetEcho		uhm howcome the intrepid upgrade from hardy removes everything? including wifi support before it can download the new stuff?
2008-11-01T08:52:00.000Z	NetEcho		so apparently using Updates Manager to update from hardy to intrepid is a very very bad thing to do, it removed everything rebooted my system and cripled it
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	Had you used third-party repositories before?
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	What in particular did it remove?
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	NetEcho	wgrant	it was a fresh install of hardy
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	wgrant		!ccsm | progre55
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	NetEcho	wgrant	EVERYTHING
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	EVERYTHING is wrong and useless.
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	NetEcho		it downloaded 200kb of stuff for the upgrade then removed over 500 packaged
2008-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	NetEcho	wgrant	I'm sorry it removed everything including the kernel
2008-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	And... you let it?
2008-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	NetEcho	wgrant	I was following the upgrade procedures
2008-11-01T08:55:00.000Z	NetEcho		someone should seriously remove the upgrade section right now considering it only does half the job, it removes hardy and doesn't add anything from intrepid it just deletes your install
2008-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	It works fine for most people.
2008-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	I've never seen it do anything like that before. Logs would be nice.
2008-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	NetEcho	wgrant	the last 4 upgrades have worked fine for me as well
2008-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	NetEcho	wgrant	how am I going to get logs when I can't even boot the system?
2008-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	Live CD./
2008-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	NetEcho		where am I looking?
2008-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	wgrant	NetEcho	/var/log/dist-upgrade
2008-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	NetEcho		k wgrant gimme a few moments
2008-11-01T09:00:00.000Z	NetEcho	wgrant	how do I use the livecd to boot the hdd so I can get at that?
