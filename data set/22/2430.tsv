2009-06-14T03:02:00.000Z	marcvangend		people, I've read dozens of posts about grub / dual boot / winXP but I still can't get it working. Grub does point at the right windows disk/partition but I get "NTLDR is missing" when win tries to boot... what can i do?
2009-06-14T03:03:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	Are you able to boot ubuntu?
2009-06-14T03:04:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	i can boot in ubuntu (im in ubuntu right now :-)) and i can also get into WinXP, because my bios allows me to override the first boot disk on startup. So, both work, but once I start on the ubuntu disk, I can't get to the windows disk
2009-06-14T03:05:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	What does your menu.lst look like?  Do you know what file I'm talking about??
2009-06-14T03:06:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	pasebin it for me?

2009-06-14T03:08:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	What are those map lines?  You map it one way and then another?
2009-06-14T03:09:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	I have been told that it's needed to fool windows into thinking that it's being booted from hd0

2009-06-14T03:12:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	The only thing I see wrong is that that tutorial specifically says to make the map lines "the last two lines"  Try that.  Other than that I don't know.  It all looks right to me.
2009-06-14T03:13:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	Is your windows XP on the first partition of your second harddrive?
2009-06-14T03:14:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	yes, it's there. You know, the funny thing is that the error "NTLDR is missing" is generated by... NTLDR!
2009-06-14T03:14:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	Not gonna lie I don't even know what the stupid NTLDR is?  NT-Loader?  Windows boot loader?
2009-06-14T03:15:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	you guessed right
2009-06-14T03:16:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	I do see some confusion.  When you install ubuntu and windows xp on 1 harddrive. you replace the NTLDR with GRUB.  AFAIK you don't point a bootloader at another bootloader.
2009-06-14T03:17:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	the only thing I can think of now, is that it might be a problem that ubuntu is on an IDE disk, while Windows is on SATA
2009-06-14T03:17:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	no, they're on separate disks
2009-06-14T03:18:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	That really shouldn't matter.  Yeah I know they're on separate disks.  But you only need 1 boot loader in your entire system.  I know that with an all linux system with 2 harddrives you would install GRUB into the MBR of 1 drive and then it is capable of booting system on the other disk
2009-06-14T03:18:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	GRUB can't load Windows directly, so with the chainloader+1 command, you tell it to chain another bootloader
2009-06-14T03:19:00.000Z	edbian	marcvangend	Ok.  I don't know enough to help anymore.  :(  Sorry
2009-06-14T03:19:00.000Z	marcvangend	edbian	that's okay, thanks for your time and effords
