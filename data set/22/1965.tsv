2010-05-02T05:34:00.000Z	bahadunn		my computer is pretty much unusable without a keyboard and mouse
2010-05-02T05:35:00.000Z	bahadunn		I guess I might as well go watch tv or something
2010-05-02T05:36:00.000Z	bahadunn		and the mouse dont work either
2010-05-02T05:36:00.000Z	bahadunn		it worked fine in 9.10 before I upgraded
2010-05-02T05:37:00.000Z	bahadunn		I am bummed out
2010-05-02T05:37:00.000Z	bahadunn		I might just go back to debian
2010-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	bahadunn		there is something not right in 10.04
2010-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	bahadunn		and I am not the only person having a problem
2010-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	bahadunn		but seems no one knows of a fix
2010-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	bahadunn		so I am stuck
2010-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bahadunn	What you probably need is a comparison of the output of dmesg both on 9.10 and 10.04
2010-05-02T05:39:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bahadunn	that way you can see what part did not connect right.
2010-05-02T05:39:00.000Z	bahadunn	Stereocaulon	not possible at this point
2010-05-02T05:40:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bahadunn	It's possible if you boot your box from a Live CD of 9.10
2010-05-02T05:41:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bahadunn	*if* your WL desktop was supported out of the box without any extras that is.
2010-05-02T06:11:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bahadunn	Please file a bug with as much meaningful info on your hardware setup as possible
2010-05-02T06:12:00.000Z	bahadunn	Stereocaulon	right now I am just doing what I can do have a usuable computer
2010-05-02T06:12:00.000Z	bahadunn	Stereocaulon	I am not really in the frame of mind to file bug reports
2010-05-02T06:57:00.000Z	bahadunn	Stereocaulon	I don thave a 9.10 live cd
2010-05-02T06:55:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bahadunn	does the USB dongle show up in lsusb?
2010-05-02T06:55:00.000Z	bahadunn	Stereocaulon	yeah
2010-05-02T06:56:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bahadunn	did you try to compare the dmesg output from the 9.10 LiveCD with your current dmesg? that might give some clues
