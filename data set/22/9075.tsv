2005-09-17T08:23:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	check you dma settings
2005-09-17T08:23:00.000Z	packman_e	nomasteryoda	what is dma settings?
2005-09-17T08:24:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	hope that helps
2005-09-17T08:25:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	you can set it with sudo hpdarm -d1 /dev/hda (if hda is your first hd)
2005-09-17T08:25:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	and use xine
2005-09-17T08:26:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	you can right click a video file and choose open with
2005-09-17T08:27:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	and Ubuntu/gnome will put an entry there... much like winders
2005-09-17T08:27:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	you can also change the default application used for videos
2005-09-17T08:29:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	ubuntu is very fast...
2005-09-17T08:31:00.000Z	packman_e	nomasteryoda	when i tried xine to play music video i get no sound?
2005-09-17T08:32:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	lol
2005-09-17T08:32:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	did you up the volume? i think sometimes xine is muted on load
2005-09-17T08:33:00.000Z	packman_e	nomasteryoda	the volume is up but still no sound
2005-09-17T08:33:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	is some other video app running?
2005-09-17T08:35:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	it might be an intel
2005-09-17T08:45:00.000Z	packman_e	nomasteryoda	i just realised, in xine there is no problems with the audio/video sync , where as in totem there is... i wonder why that is?
2005-09-17T08:46:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	it might be dropping some frames just to make it better
2005-09-17T08:46:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	mplayer sometimes is better for me.
2005-09-17T08:46:00.000Z	packman_e	nomasteryoda	is that mplayer better than xine?
2005-09-17T08:47:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	packman_e	it has plugins for firefox/mozilla too
