2010-03-06T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Claws_: if you run: ls ,do you see setup.sh?
2010-03-06T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Iceroot: does crossover not do it too?
2010-03-06T13:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Digital_1: there's crossoveroffice (also costs money) which is similar
2010-03-06T13:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Claws_: try: sudo sh ./setup.sh
2010-03-06T13:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Abhi_: looked like karmic in my alpha3 install. Quickly installed lxde and it all vanished :)
2010-03-06T13:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Claws_: what is the output of: ls -la ./setup.sh
2010-03-06T13:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Iceroot: you can run games in crossover just like cedega
2010-03-06T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Claws_: ok so everybody has execute and read access and its owned by root
2010-03-06T13:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Distratica: without a gui you don't really need drivers
2010-03-06T13:12:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	without a gui I don't really need wireless drivers?
2010-03-06T13:14:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	wireless
2010-03-06T13:15:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	I've already figured out what card I have, and got a guide, but the guide figures I have ubuntu installed which has a restricted drivers gui tool
2010-03-06T13:16:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	yes
2010-03-06T13:16:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	4312
2010-03-19T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	distatica	look into xpud then ;)
2010-03-19T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	distatica	its a very tiny distro which boots in about 3 seconds and gives a small few aps nicluding browser, it has few drivers so you will be doing a lot of config manually and maybe compiling drivers
2010-03-19T10:58:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	I will look into it, but compiling drivers and doing all that extra work wasn't my intention :) I like the console, I don't like work!
2010-03-19T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	distatica	you can use the minimal install and just install your browser, you will then install only what it needs
2010-03-19T11:01:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	is this browser "firefox" ?
2010-03-19T11:02:00.000Z	distatica	ActionParsnip	I have started using firefox less these days, most of the stuff I read displays half decently on elinks
2010-03-19T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	distatica	nice, i ue chromium-daily, makes firefox seem like a snail
