2007-03-03T16:47:00.000Z	zYe		i have a linksys router with some firmware in the form of a .bin file what do i do
2007-03-03T16:47:00.000Z	zYe		just recently got it
2007-03-03T16:47:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	I would goto linksys's website for that
2007-03-03T16:47:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	what should i go there for? i got the firmware from their site but  found no instructions
2007-03-03T16:47:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	im quite new to ubuntu
2007-03-03T16:48:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	but ubuntu has NOTHIGN to do with upgrading your router's firmware
2007-03-03T16:48:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	well ive yet to even get it working yet
2007-03-03T16:49:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	i was running a hub, and now i bought a router, but i can no longer get online
2007-03-03T16:49:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	this is my first experience with a router also
2007-03-03T16:49:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	That's not a question for this channel, that is a question for linksys or router people, that's what I was saying
2007-03-03T16:50:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	yes but there is a interaction with ubuntu and the router in order for it to work
2007-03-03T16:51:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	but the router came with a bunch of .exe installation files, so i went to their site and got the files in .bin form
2007-03-03T16:51:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	now i should extract/install something from the .bin on ubuntu right
2007-03-03T16:53:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	no, if you are connecting to your router with ubuntu via an ethernet cable it has nothing to do with ubuntu, same as if you were using windows. Installing firmware is normally done via the web control panel on your router, you should get out your router instruction manual or download it from linksys and look up how to update firmware
2007-03-03T16:54:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	well what i am really wondering is how i can configure my router via ubuntu
2007-03-03T16:54:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	via your browser JUST like in windows, totally OS  agnostic
2007-03-03T16:59:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	how do you suggest i get a connection from my modem to my router
2007-03-03T17:01:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	by following your ISP's, modem's and routers manuals
2007-03-04T17:01:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	did i insult you or something?
2007-03-04T17:02:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	no I'm trying to tell you that this is an ubuntu os channel, and you are asking router and modem configuration questions, Ubuntu can connect to your router (if it's setup correctly) via ethernet, just like any other OS
2007-03-04T17:06:00.000Z	zYe	kelsin	so do you know of any router/modem irc rooms around that could help me due to my superb ignorance on this subject?
2007-03-04T17:07:00.000Z	kelsin	zYe	your best bet is honestly the manuals for your equipement and help from your ISP, it will get done faster if you call them
