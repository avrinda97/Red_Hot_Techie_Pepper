2009-12-17T18:54:00.000Z	cyber_666_uk		my external hdd is no longer recognised - any ideas
2009-12-17T18:54:00.000Z	cyber_666_uk		ive tried testdisk and that doesnt recognise it either
2009-12-17T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 tell the channel what filesystem its useing In such cases. because it will be needed info :)
2009-12-17T18:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 you used a windows machine to scan/repair the disk yet?
2009-12-17T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 if a ntfs is not cleanly 'removed' when using windows. linux wont mount/access it for 'safty' reasons
2009-12-17T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 use windows to scan/fix the windows disk. not the ubuntu one.
2009-12-17T18:58:00.000Z	cyber_666_uk	Dr_Willis	windows no longer recognises the drive either which is why the tools wouldnt work
2009-12-17T19:06:00.000Z	cyber_666_uk	Dr_Willis	i just tried plugig the drive into another windows machine and t works fine (phew) but ubutu still wont recognise it - any suggestions what this could mean?
2009-12-17T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 use winows to check/fix the drive.. ALWAYS use windows 'safely remove' feature.. dont hibernate/suspend windows with the thing plugged in
2009-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 you just said windows saw it.
2009-12-17T19:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 you could use the command line tools if you wanted to. but IF the drive is not cleanly removed by windows.. Ubuntu will NOT want to auto mount it.
2009-12-17T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 also install/run the ntfs-config tools perhaps to enable full user access
2009-12-17T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 you could set a mountpoint called whatever you want.
2009-12-17T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 /media/windowsstuff
2009-12-17T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 Hmm?
2009-12-17T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 i got box's of keyboards. :) Rummage sales for $1 each.
2009-12-17T19:26:00.000Z	cyber_666_uk	Dr_Willis	thx for your help anyway - much appriciated
2009-12-17T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 thers 'not seeing it' then theres 'not auto mounting it'
2009-12-17T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 the system is seeing the hd if 'sudo fdisk -l' shows it.. it may not be auto mounting it for various reasons
2009-12-17T19:31:00.000Z	cyber_666_uk	Dr_Willis	could it be that another two drives have teh same letters assigned?
2009-12-17T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cyber_666_uk	 linux dostne use drive letter asignments like in widnows. each device has its own /dev/sdXX entry
