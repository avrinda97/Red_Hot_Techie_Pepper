2004-09-29T07:16:00.000Z	robertj		okay, back from my first Ubuntu install
2004-09-29T07:17:00.000Z	robertj		first comment: MY EYES!
2004-09-29T07:17:00.000Z	robertj		No, mainly the default resolution
2004-09-29T07:17:00.000Z	robertj		< 80hz and my eyes scream
2004-09-29T07:18:00.000Z	robertj		This monitor really needs 1280x1024, not 1600
2004-09-29T07:19:00.000Z	robertj		I believe not ;)
2004-09-29T07:20:00.000Z	robertj		Windows doesn't pick that resolution, neither does Fedora if I recall correctly
2004-09-29T07:20:00.000Z	robertj		IMO, unless its the difference between 640x480 & 800x600 or 800x600 & 1024x768, refresh rate should trump all
2004-09-29T07:20:00.000Z	robertj		san: I bet they are doing some checks to weigh in refresh rate over manufacturer recommendation
2004-09-29T07:21:00.000Z	robertj		which certainly seems sane in this case
2004-09-29T07:22:00.000Z	Kamion	robertj	at one point the algorithm was basically "on CRTs, take the second-highest resolution offered"
2004-09-29T07:22:00.000Z	Kamion	robertj	I think it might be more complicated than that now
2004-09-29T07:55:00.000Z	Kamion	robertj	the current artwork isn't final, you'll be glad to hear
2004-09-29T07:55:00.000Z	robertj	Kamion	yeah, I know. I don't mind it except for the color
2004-09-29T08:19:00.000Z	robertj	Kamion	but not your average user
2004-09-29T08:20:00.000Z	robertj	Kamion	Your average user has applications that crash because their Library/dot file/registry keys are wrong
2004-09-29T08:20:00.000Z	Kamion	robertj	they should report them as bugs :-)
2004-09-29T08:20:00.000Z	robertj	Kamion	which is all well and good, except for the fact they do
2004-09-29T08:21:00.000Z	Kamion	robertj	dotfile problems are a relatively rare cause for that in UNix
2004-09-29T08:21:00.000Z	robertj	Kamion	The right answer is to do both
2004-09-29T08:22:00.000Z	Kamion	robertj	disagree
2004-09-29T08:36:00.000Z	Kamion	robertj	in real life it is, though
