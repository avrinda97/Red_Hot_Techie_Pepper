2008-05-26T21:10:00.000Z	DSoTS		back again
2008-05-26T21:10:00.000Z	DSoTS		right, i can run Google Earth fine under xubuntu until i get compiz running
2008-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	DSoTS		then it tells me my graphics card is unsupported
2008-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	crdlb	DSoTS	did you install xserver-xgl ?
2008-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	DSoTS		yep
2008-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	DSoTS		still not helping
2008-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	crdlb	DSoTS	you shouldn't have
2008-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	DSoTS		ohhhhh
2008-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	DSoTS		ok
2008-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	DSoTS		so uninstall it?
2008-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	crdlb	DSoTS	yes. google earth still won't work perfectly with compiz on intel (a limitation of the Direct Rendering Infrastructure) though
2008-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	crdlb		but it will at least run
2008-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	DSoTS		thanks
2008-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	DSoTS		i'll give it a shot
2008-05-26T21:14:00.000Z	DSoTS	crdlb	just uninstalled xserver-xgl, run compiz and i'm still being told by google earth that I'm running opengl emulation
2008-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	crdlb	DSoTS	you need to restart your session. Xgl is still running
2008-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	DSoTS		ahhhh
2008-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	DSoTS		of course
2008-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	DSoTS		i'll be back to let you know, and hopefully to thank you
2008-05-26T21:20:00.000Z	DSoTS		crblb: thanks
2008-05-26T21:20:00.000Z	DSoTS		that worked a treat!
