2010-10-30T17:43:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	you should be able to tell the server what passive port to use and then open those ports on your router
2010-10-30T17:44:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	port range I mean not port
2010-10-30T17:49:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	I did that in vsftpd config file, and I forwarded them, but I still get the a connection refused error
2010-10-30T17:50:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	did you forward the port range in your router to your ftp server?
2010-10-30T17:50:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	my config file is in this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10047834#post10047834
2010-10-30T17:50:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	yes
2010-10-30T17:51:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	Is the server itself firewalled?
2010-10-30T17:51:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	normally, but I disabled it.  and the ftp works over LAN.
2010-10-30T17:54:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	you probably need to set the pasv_address
2010-10-30T17:55:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	I tried that, I get the same "connection refused" error.  :-/
2010-10-30T17:56:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	it isnt in the config file you gave before, did you add it afterwards?
2010-10-30T17:57:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	yeah, I added it after.  It is commented out in the config file cause I had been experimenting with it.
2010-10-30T17:58:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	I can login into the server, it is just the data port(s) that are screwed up.
2010-10-30T17:58:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	If it is working inside the lan it really points to a problem either with the pasv_address setting or the router forwarding - beyond that Idunno
2010-10-30T17:59:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	I think it is the router forwarding, but I have forwarded the pasv port range I specified in the config file.  I cant think of what might be wrong.
2010-10-30T18:00:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	What have you got set as pasv_address now?
2010-10-30T18:01:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	my external IP -- 71.174.117.120
2010-10-30T18:03:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	Sorry, I've run out of ideas! If the router settings are correct and your IP is correct and you can connect inside the lan then it ought to work :|
2010-10-30T18:04:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	well LAN does work as long as I dont set the pasv address cause then it uses my lan ip.  ick, I suppose I will figure it out eventually.  thanks for your help :)
2010-10-30T18:05:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	you want me to try and connect to it?
2010-10-30T18:06:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	MrsB	sure.  Can I PM you the temporarly password to my blog user?
2010-10-30T18:06:00.000Z	MrsB	nerdy_kid	sure
