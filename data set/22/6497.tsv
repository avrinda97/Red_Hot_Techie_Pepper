2006-11-21T14:41:00.000Z	CarCase928		too bad ArrenLex isn't here, i wanted to tell him that it works, but timidity doesn't have 100% support for MIDI, but it does have partial support for MIDI
2006-11-21T14:43:00.000Z	CarCase928		can anyone tell me how to open a .bin file?
2006-11-21T14:44:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	you usually don't open a .bin file, you execute it.
2006-11-21T14:45:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	that's what i'm wanting to do, execute it
2006-11-21T14:46:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	in linux you need to include the path, as linux doesn't handle execution quite like M$. Assuming you are in the same directory as the .bin, just type ./<filename>
2006-11-21T14:47:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	from anywhere else, include the entire path (/home/me/filename)
2006-11-21T14:47:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	thanks
2006-11-21T14:53:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	i can't get the command to work
2006-11-21T14:54:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	do a ls -l and see if the file is marked as executable. Know how to do that?
2006-11-21T14:54:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	i'll try
2006-11-21T14:55:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	the output of 'ls -l', on the left end, will have something like '-rwxrwxrwx', you need the x's
2006-11-21T14:56:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	i run the command, here is the result: ken@Linux0001:~/Desktop$ ls -l /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin
2006-11-21T14:57:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	right....then you need the x's. 'chmod 755 /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin'
2006-11-21T15:00:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	and dr-nix: i ran the command(s), nothing happened
2006-11-21T15:00:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	do the ls -l again and make sure the file is Now executable
2006-11-21T15:01:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	ok
2006-11-21T15:02:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	here is the result: ken@Linux0001:~/Desktop$ ls -l /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin
2006-11-21T15:03:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	"/home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin" is in green
2006-11-21T15:03:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	then /home/ken/Desktop/GoogleEarthLinux.bin should run the file
2006-11-21T15:03:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	do you get any output (error indication) when you run that command in a terminal?
2006-11-21T15:04:00.000Z	CarCase928	thor	it's working, thanks a lot
2006-11-21T15:04:00.000Z	thor	CarCase928	good. good luck
