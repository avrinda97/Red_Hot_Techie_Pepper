2010-08-24T15:59:00.000Z	itsux2bu		in gedit..   the file i want to edit is on the screen.. i see a cursor.. but when i hit enter to add a line it just beeps..
2010-08-24T16:00:00.000Z	itsux2bu		is this a permissions thing?
2010-08-24T16:01:00.000Z	itsux2bu		do i have grant myself edit rights.. or something?
2010-08-24T16:01:00.000Z	itsux2bu		how do i do a   "sudo"  in the desktop?
2010-08-24T16:02:00.000Z	itsux2bu		fstab
2010-08-24T16:02:00.000Z	itsux2bu		/etc/fstab
2010-08-24T16:03:00.000Z	itsux2bu		mount a folder at boot time
2010-08-24T16:03:00.000Z	BlueChip	itsux2bu	personally I would ctrl-alt-f3 ...aptget install mc ...sudo mcedit /etc/fstab
2010-08-24T16:04:00.000Z	itsux2bu		when i'm not in desktop i use nano
2010-08-24T16:05:00.000Z	BlueChip	itsux2bu	fair call - always advise people to take a peek at `mcedit` - but as you highlight `nano` is commonly pre-installed and therefore a far more reliable hit
2010-08-24T16:05:00.000Z	itsux2bu	jrib	you said  "run"  ?
2010-08-24T16:06:00.000Z	itsux2bu		ok
2010-08-24T16:07:00.000Z	itsux2bu		seems as if to do anything useful.. *nix still needs the command line..
2010-08-24T16:07:00.000Z	itsux2bu		any admin or system work.. the command line still is needed
2010-08-24T16:09:00.000Z	itsux2bu		now thats what i'm used to in windows..  keeping the user totally ignorant..  lol
2010-08-24T16:20:00.000Z	itsux2bu		success..  using just the desktop gui i did a sudo and added "downloads /mnt/downloads vboxsf defaults 0 0" to fstab.. saved it rebooted.. and now see my windows folder in ubuntu.. YEA!
2010-08-24T16:45:00.000Z	BlueChip		If you have a C compiling question ##c is good if you can ignore the flame-trolls
2010-08-24T16:45:00.000Z	BlueChip		post the code to pastebin (or such) I'll take a look :)
2010-08-24T16:46:00.000Z	BlueChip		go to pastebin.org and guess ;)
2010-08-24T16:57:00.000Z	BlueChip		I've had the banned thing pop up ...always goes away after I sign in with my registered account
2010-08-24T17:18:00.000Z	itsux2bu		does ubuntu use a file called  /etc/inittab  ?
