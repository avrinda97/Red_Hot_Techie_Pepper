2011-09-23T16:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	you may have the kwork bug
2011-09-23T16:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	i had it too, same symptoms, had to reinstall my system
2011-09-23T16:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	kworker bug is in ubuntu
2011-09-23T16:45:00.000Z	D_Russ	MonkeyDust	what were your symptoms
2011-09-23T16:46:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	no wallpaper, no libre office, no thunderbird, no chromium
2011-09-23T16:49:00.000Z	D_Russ	MonkeyDust	i dont have the same symptoms you have. i just expierieced a one time wierdness, where the start menu and all menus next to it disappeared and my apps would not open, a restart fixed it, and that was the first time so far.
2011-10-04T01:48:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	gnome-control-center, preferred applications
2011-10-04T01:49:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	forget what i say, 11.04 is unity
2012-01-02T19:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	 rsync is fster than cp
2012-01-02T19:24:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	 cp is copy, rsync basically does the same, but it is faster and has more/other options
2012-01-02T19:24:00.000Z	D_Russ	MonkeyDust	is rsync in the software center?
2012-01-02T19:25:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	D_Russ	 it's a terminal command
2012-01-02T19:38:00.000Z	D_Russ	MonkeyDust	well it is more like multiple small files
