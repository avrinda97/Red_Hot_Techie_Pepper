2011-10-19T23:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	install gtk2-engines-pixbuf
2011-10-20T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	the package solves the warning
2011-10-20T00:01:00.000Z	span89	ActionParsnip	it says: "install: missing destination file operand after  'gtk2-engines-pixbuf'"
2011-10-20T00:02:00.000Z	span89	ActionParsnip	it says: "install: missing destination file operand after  'gtk2-engines-pixbuf'"
2011-10-20T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	sudo apt-get install t to log that bug then.  If its a duplicate then it will get
2011-10-20T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	sorry
2011-10-20T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf
2011-10-20T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	stupid putty pastespazz earlier :(
2011-10-20T00:04:00.000Z	span89	ActionParsnip	and then what? I just inserted "gksudo synaptic" and nothing happened.
2011-10-20T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	try:  sudo apt-get --reinstall install syaptic
2011-10-20T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	why not just use software centre?
2011-10-20T00:10:00.000Z	span89	ActionParsnip	I'm following steps on a forum post to install drivers needed to run my WiFi
2011-10-20T00:11:00.000Z	span89	ActionParsnip	and it's telling me to open synaptic to uninstall/install things
2011-10-20T01:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	just do it then, you don't need to tell us
2011-10-20T01:29:00.000Z	span89	ActionParsnip	avn-matt: I've asked for help in this channel many times with no help given. I've also searched the Ubuntu forums and that didn't offer much help either. So what do I do now? And I've done this for more than one machine that I'm trying to get Ubuntu on.
2011-10-20T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	if nobody can answer then thats how it goes. People can't magic up knowledge they don't have do they!?
2011-10-20T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	think about it
2011-10-20T01:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	span89	so you want people to just spawn knowledge from nothing to answer your question? If we could do that then pub quizes ould be a snap
2011-10-20T01:54:00.000Z	span89	ActionParsnip	`Yahoo, eSoul, avn-matt: Thanks.
