2008-09-15T23:44:00.000Z	opt1k	unop	but it has to do with linux, and even if it doesn't, they could at least answer politely, not start trashing ppl asap
2008-09-15T23:45:00.000Z	unop	opt1k	well, complaining about it elsewhere doesn't help you or anyone else - just focus on getting your questions answered and you're likely to source a solution.
2008-09-15T23:46:00.000Z	opt1k	unop	true.
2008-09-16T02:33:00.000Z	unop	opt1k	it probably means /var/mail/opt1k is a symlink to another symlink (and so on) - you have a couple of options.  1) this file shouldn't normally be a symlink - so you can delete it and recreate a new blank file (with touch)  2) find out where the symlinks eventually take you, then symlink directly to that target.
2008-09-16T02:34:00.000Z	opt1k	unop	i'll go with the first option, too tired for anything else =) thx!
2008-09-16T02:37:00.000Z	opt1k	unop	 cannot remove `/var/mail/opt1k': Too many levels of symbolic links
2008-09-16T02:37:00.000Z	unop	opt1k	tried  rm -f ... ?
2008-09-16T02:38:00.000Z	unop	opt1k	what does ls -l /var/mail/opt1k give you?
