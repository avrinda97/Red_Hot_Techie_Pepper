2007-11-18T12:59:00.000Z	greencookie	Jordan_U	agreed with mogra
2007-11-18T13:00:00.000Z	greencookie	Jordan_U	I cant get my wireless card or ati card to work properly:) and IMO that sucks bigtime, but i can sacrifice those temporarily:D
2007-11-18T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	greencookie	When for whatever reason X does not start with the current xorg.conf settings three times in a row, it sets the values to vesa and low rez which is likely to always work
2007-11-18T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	greencookie	Oh, sorry, thought you said failsafe GDM
2007-11-18T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	greencookie	... Or did you?
2007-11-18T13:05:00.000Z	greencookie	Jordan_U	I've never played with session manager at login to check the failsafe option. I was wondering what that was for
2007-11-18T13:05:00.000Z	greencookie	Jordan_U	I'm actually gonna go ahead and try that right now.
2007-11-18T13:06:00.000Z	greencookie	Jordan_U	nvm. I thought it was another displaymanager. silly me. heh.
