2009-08-20T11:48:00.000Z	tazmania		I am trying to install ubuntu desktop version on my laptop to have dual boot with my XP
2009-08-20T11:49:00.000Z	tazmania		my ram is 1GB

2009-08-20T11:50:00.000Z	tazmania	ActionParsnip	what do you mean?  I just downloaded the desktop version from ubuntu website
2009-08-20T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	thats fine, but you have no way of knowing the data is ok do you
2009-08-20T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	install CDs are massively intollerant of bit errors, so you can check it with MD5 to make sure what you have is correct
2009-08-20T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	ubottu gave you some links, use them
2009-08-20T11:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	if the hashes do not match you will need to redownload
2009-08-20T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	some
2009-08-20T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	its very advisable to chack as if you have a bad ISO the install will be bad or may not complete or may damage your system
2009-08-20T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	it takes like 20 seconds

2009-08-20T12:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	make 3, swap / and /home
2009-08-20T12:11:00.000Z	tazmania	ActionParsnip	Why /home?
2009-08-20T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	it helps if you need to reinstall, you can simply wipe out the other 2 and reinstall, then re-add the home partition to fstab (although the ubuntu installer allows you to set its mount point at install time)
2009-08-20T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	if you have 1Gb ram then 1Gb swap will do you, 15Gb isnt a huge amount to play with
2009-08-20T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	you could give about 5 or 6Gb to / and leave the rest to /home
2009-08-20T12:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	go find out
2009-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tazmania	you can have 4 primary partitions so if you are using less than 4 partitions you can make them all primary
