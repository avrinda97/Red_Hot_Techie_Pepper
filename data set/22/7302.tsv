2011-05-19T09:48:00.000Z	Name141		Can someone tell me the version of the latest LTS ?
2011-05-19T09:49:00.000Z	Name141		!lts
2011-05-19T09:49:00.000Z	Name141		Is there anything special in 11.04 vs 10.04 ?
2011-05-19T09:49:00.000Z	Name141		As in, what would I miss?
2011-05-19T09:50:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	 well,,, 11.04 at this point can be set for classic gnome  so you wont miss much there  however, Unity default desktop will take some time to get used to
2011-05-19T09:50:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	  one good way of at least seeing the interface is on youtube
2011-05-19T09:51:00.000Z	Name141	coz_	Aren't regular installs only good for 6 months ?
2011-05-19T09:51:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	 there are changes,, example,, in Unity there are NO gnome panels...there is a panel at the top but it is not a gnome panel
2011-05-19T09:51:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	  I believe it is supported certainly until the next release and slightly beyond
2011-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	 of course that is different from LTS  releases
2011-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	Name141	coz_	I was just looking to install an OS and be done with it for a while.
2011-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	Name141		like years
2011-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	 that would be at this point ubuntu 10.04  LTS
2011-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	coz_		Long term service
2011-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	coz_		or support
2011-05-19T09:53:00.000Z	Name141		Yeah, but I was weighing down the "what would I be missing till the next LTS comes out"
2011-05-19T09:53:00.000Z	Name141		vs "not having to mess with a working install"
2011-05-19T09:53:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	 i would , if you want a longer period of release ,,approx 3 years , is to install ubuntu 10.04  then upgrade when 12.04 is released
2011-05-19T09:53:00.000Z	Name141		OK.
2011-05-19T09:54:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	 I would still view a few ubuntu 11.04 videos  because that is going to be the on going interface as far as I am aware
2011-05-19T09:55:00.000Z	Name141	coz_	I was just looking for something to replace XP with on this machine when  Iget the new one built with Win7 for games.
2011-05-19T09:56:00.000Z	coz_	Name141	 start with 10.04  check it out,, and then watch the 11.04 videos  and decide if you would like that interface instead,, one thing to remember,, 11.04 is a work in progress,, it is a new interface  and  there are still debates around it
