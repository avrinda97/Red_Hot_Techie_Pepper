2008-05-15T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	did you upgrade ssh?
2008-05-15T07:25:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	yes
2008-05-15T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	pastebin what you are seeing
2008-05-15T07:27:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	running ssh-vulnkey is showing that my client key is compromised (~/.ssh/id_rsa)... there is nothing to paste
2008-05-15T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	verify you actually have a new key when you run ssh-keygen
2008-05-15T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	brb
2008-05-15T07:29:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	i regenerated it, but it has the same fingerprint
2008-05-15T07:38:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	that's not really possible.  How exactly are you generating the key?
2008-05-15T07:39:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	maybe i'm not understanding... what exactly does ssh-vulnkey show?
2008-05-15T07:40:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	it shows you compromised keys.  You are using that correctly.  But I'm not sure you are generating a new key correctly since it has the same finger print.  What command are you running?
2008-05-15T07:40:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	ssh-vulnkey
2008-05-15T07:40:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	yes, but to regenerate the key?
2008-05-15T07:41:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	ssh-genkey
2008-05-15T07:42:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	ssh-keygen you mean?  Make sure you rename the old ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub before you use ssh-keygen
2008-09-21T01:42:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	example is just find a package and 'apt-get source' it
2008-09-21T01:43:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	i would also like to know the best ways to use the packaging helper scripts
2008-09-21T01:44:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	that's in the documentation I linked you to.  Poke me if you can't find it
2008-09-21T01:44:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	ok, thanks. i'll look it over. you ok with some questions if i can't figure it out?
2008-09-21T01:45:00.000Z	jrib	jerbear	you should ask #ubuntu-motu about packaging questions, they know more than me about it :)
2008-09-21T01:45:00.000Z	jerbear	jrib	will do
