2005-12-21T11:46:00.000Z	lasindi		How come when you boot into runtime level 1, it doesn't ask for a password (and just gives a root prompt)?
2005-12-21T11:46:00.000Z	lasindi		Isn't that a security flaw?
2005-12-21T11:47:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	not really, you could as well boot init=/bin/bash and get a root prompt with no password
2005-12-21T11:47:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	which works in pretty much all linux dists
2005-12-21T11:47:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	why does linux allow that?
2005-12-21T11:48:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	because it is a very useful way of doing recovery, without having to bring a boot cd etc
2005-12-21T11:48:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	isn't it a security hazard?
2005-12-21T11:49:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	well, kind of, but not really. if you want to protect against someone with physical access to the machine, you need to do lots of work, including locking down the bios
2005-12-21T11:49:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	well, locking down the BIOS isn't hard
2005-12-21T11:49:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	neither is locking down the bootloader to refuse booting anything but the default
2005-12-21T11:50:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	how do you do that?
2005-12-21T11:50:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	by default neither of this is done, since it is very easy to get into a non-recoverable state
2005-12-21T11:50:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	how do you lock down the boot loader?
2005-12-21T11:51:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	hm. I don't remember now, I've never done it. but setting a password for grub or so, should be the way to go
2005-12-21T11:51:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	ok thanks
2005-12-21T12:02:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	is it possible to pass the 'init=/bin/bash' parameter in LILO also without root access?
2005-12-21T12:03:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	sure, same thing there. if you want to lock it down, you have to set a password.
2005-12-21T12:03:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	and set a bios password, and proper intrusion detection on the hardware.
2005-12-21T12:04:00.000Z	lasindi	maswan	ok thanks
2005-12-21T12:04:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	since it was in here, I just mentioned grub
2005-12-21T12:04:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	but in general it is for any bootloader
2005-12-21T12:05:00.000Z	maswan	lasindi	well, not just set bios password, set bios password and disable anything but internal harddrive boot (no floppy/cd/network/usb/firewire/whatever booting).
