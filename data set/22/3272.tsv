2008-12-18T23:18:00.000Z	Formode		Hello, Anyone know why if I make a partition with gparted on my drive, that mac OS for some reason can't reformat it properly?
2008-12-18T23:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	what do you mean properly ?
2008-12-18T23:19:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	it does to reformat it, and stops, (I'm trying to make it HFS+) but when I reselect it on mac OS, it still says FAT32. >> Gparted says it's HFS
2008-12-18T23:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	I've never heard of that
2008-12-18T23:19:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	it's so weird.
2008-12-18T23:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	dont ask every minute, give it a chance for new people to come to the channel
2008-12-18T23:25:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	I just figured out something new, but sorry.
2008-12-18T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	I don't think gparted can mark a hfs file system
2008-12-18T23:35:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	Gah.
2008-12-18T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	you just want a blank partition for macos to put a file syssm on
2008-12-18T23:35:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	yes. But the mac OS disk utils won't format things right for some reason
2008-12-18T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	yup, I undersstand that
2008-12-18T23:35:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	so how would I go about that? Do you know? :O
2008-12-18T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	I don't know why mac OS isn't writing to the partition
2008-12-18T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	you may want to ask ##apple or ##macos how to debug mac os
2008-12-18T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	what model mac is this ?
2008-12-18T23:36:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	me neither, it's not coming up. Thanks
2008-12-18T23:36:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	it isn't a mac. :-P
2008-12-18T23:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	then don't ask it's illegal to run mac os on non-apple hardware
2008-12-18T23:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	I'm telling you not to
2008-12-18T23:38:00.000Z	Formode	ikonia	Alright then, that's nice of you.
2008-12-18T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Formode	thank you
