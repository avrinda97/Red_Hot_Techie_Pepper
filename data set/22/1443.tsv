2010-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		[yes, this was installed with the ubuntustudio feisty CD]
2010-07-05T09:55:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		also, if i'm installing then distupgrading, i'm making it work before i distupgrade otherwise i'm looking at more dephell
2010-07-05T09:55:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		>> ok, i just got out of dep-hell.  Do I distupgrade and then reinstall X aand gdm and gnome and all thatt or do i reinstall them then distupgrade?
2010-07-05T09:56:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		it is running -rt right now, it also has -generic and one other variant installed
2010-07-05T09:58:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		and test ubuntu's broken shipped package of VLC....

2010-07-05T09:59:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		dependency hell
2010-07-05T09:59:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		when you have things trying to install or remove and they won't due to dependency issues but they lock your system because they're trying to install/uninstall
2010-07-05T09:59:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		(you can't do anything else until they're fixed)
2010-07-05T10:00:00.000Z	tertl3	tonsofpcs	ubuntu doesnt really have that problem
2010-07-05T10:00:00.000Z	tertl3		fedora is another story :)
2010-07-05T10:00:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	tertl3	tell that to my machine here :)
2010-07-05T10:01:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		apt crashed on isntalling a python package about a year and a half ago, i haven't used the system since then due to the issues
2010-07-05T10:01:00.000Z	tertl3	tonsofpcs	it could be the studio ppa
2010-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	tertl3	no, it was a standard package that crashed during install due to a server update coincidental with the install
2010-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	tertl3	tonsofpcs	idk
2010-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		(or a cron job interfering, it's really not clear)
2010-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	tonsofpcs		anyway, that's fixed now
2010-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	tertl3	tonsofpcs	give it a few days and then google it
2010-07-05T10:02:00.000Z	tonsofpcs	tertl3	it happened a year and a half ago.
2010-07-05T10:03:00.000Z	tertl3	tonsofpcs	do what I did, install Fedora 13
