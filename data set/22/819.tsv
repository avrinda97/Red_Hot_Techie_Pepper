2011-03-02T08:47:00.000Z	bin_bash		Does anyone know how to kill a program if it's not listed in top?
2011-03-02T08:47:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	ps aux | grep <programname>
2011-03-02T08:49:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	It says no such process
2011-03-02T08:51:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	can you just run ps?
2011-03-02T08:52:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	this is the output: 20022  0.0  0.0   3324   800 pts/3    S+   22:51   0:00 grep Skype
2011-03-02T08:53:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	oh, ok. i thought it wasn't working. in which case i would say that skype is not running
2011-03-02T08:55:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	how can I kill this unkillable skype process?
2011-03-02T08:55:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	you have to be more specific about what the problem is. skype isn't running
2011-03-02T08:56:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	when I try to load skype and login, it says "Another skype instance may exist"
2011-03-02T09:00:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	sudo chown -R user.group .Skype
2011-03-02T09:00:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	from your home directory: cd ~
2011-03-02T09:02:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	your user your group
2011-03-02T09:02:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	just user should work then
2011-03-02T09:03:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	that didn't work either
2011-03-02T09:03:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	I still can't login to skype
2011-03-02T09:04:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	cp .Skype .Skype-backup && rm -r .Skype
2011-03-02T09:04:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	what does that do?
2011-03-02T09:05:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	it makes a backup of your skype directory and then deletes the original
2011-03-02T09:06:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	the output I got was cp: omitting directory `.Skype'
2011-03-02T09:06:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	you might need a -R in the cp, so cp -R .Skype .Skype-backup && rm -R .Skype
2011-03-02T09:07:00.000Z	bin_bash	milamber	now what
2011-03-02T09:07:00.000Z	milamber	bin_bash	try logging in again
