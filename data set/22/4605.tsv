2007-11-29T22:18:00.000Z	SP534		I can't install new Applications, what's wrong with my computer?
2007-11-29T22:18:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	give us more information. WHY can't you install new applications?
2007-11-29T22:19:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	i just get [program name here] cannot be installed on your computer type (i386). Either the application requires special hardware features or the vendor decided to not support your computer type.
2007-11-29T22:19:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	and that's for EVERY application
2007-11-29T22:19:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	how are you trying to install applications? thru synaptic? command line apt-get? what?
2007-11-29T22:20:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	The Applications > Add/Remove app
2007-11-29T22:20:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	have you tried using synaptic instead? just to see if it works
2007-11-29T22:21:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	Where's that?
2007-11-29T22:21:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	system > administration > synaptic package manager
2007-11-29T22:21:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	there you just have to search for the name of the application you want, check it and then 'apply'
2007-11-29T22:24:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	Nope, no results
2007-11-29T22:24:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	is it a fresh install? was it working before?
2007-11-29T22:24:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	installed yesterday, only started trying today
2007-11-29T22:25:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	is that an ordinary pc or does it have any weird setup/configuration?
2007-11-29T22:25:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	Well it's a dual boot system, if that makes and difference.
2007-11-29T22:26:00.000Z	LiMaO	SP534	and what version of ubuntu are you running?
2007-11-30T00:56:00.000Z	SP534	LiMaO	Fixed!!
