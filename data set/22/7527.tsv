2006-03-11T11:45:00.000Z	_wd3_		i have a tough one for the experts tonight. i have usb hpna not connecting online. netwk shw ip, netmask, loopback but not allowing me online. why
2006-03-11T11:46:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	What happens when you 'ping' external hosts? Do you get an 'operation not permitted'?
2006-03-11T11:47:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	what's steps again to ping
2006-03-11T11:47:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	ping <ip address>
2006-03-11T11:47:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	It's a shell command
2006-03-11T11:47:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	thats in network  settings i'll do it again
2006-03-11T11:53:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	i put in my friends ip and press ping in the "network tools" and nothing comes in the box below. odd though under devices it shws ip address, netmask, hardware loopback and the packets are counting
2006-03-11T11:54:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	Can you perform the ping from the command line?
2006-03-11T11:54:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	sorry what's command
2006-03-11T11:54:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	Open a terminal window, then type in 'ping <ip address>'
2006-03-11T11:56:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	brb by the way my other linux box is nic my daughter is hpna, have u heard of other problms?
2006-03-11T11:56:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	You need to provide more information to diagnose a hardware problem, if you suspect that to be the case
2006-03-11T11:57:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	"network unreachable"
2006-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	Ok. What's your IP address and netmask again? Are you behind a router on a home network?
2006-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	ip 127.0.0.1, netmask 255.0.0.0, behind a home ntwk / router. sbc/pacbell  (hpna) home portal. my wife is conn usb to modem router, I am conn etho, daught well in xp usb adapter to phone line but linux won't register usb adapter
2006-03-11T12:01:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	127.0.0.1 is the loopback interface; it wouldn't be an Ethernet interface at all
2006-03-11T12:03:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	thanks i was just thinking if my wife and i ip starts with 172 shouldn't daughters. so teh 127 is the address for the network right so i have to put in her ip huh? how?
2006-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	No--127.0.0.1 is "myself", or "the local computer". This address is always present for testing (even when you're not connected to anything). Your actual Ethernet interface is something else
2006-03-11T12:05:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	thanx so linux see the adapter then right?
2006-03-11T12:05:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	No, you're looking at the wrong interface
2006-03-11T12:06:00.000Z	nailbiter	_wd3_	Try GNOME menu -> System -> Administration -> Network settings  instead
2006-03-11T12:06:00.000Z	_wd3_	nailbiter	brb
