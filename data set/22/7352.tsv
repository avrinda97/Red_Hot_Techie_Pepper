2006-04-17T15:05:00.000Z	blindx		GAIM likes to disconnect my MSN account sometimes. Is this a common issue? Is it GAIM, or is it MSN?

2006-04-17T15:06:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	its a bit of both, MSN drops it, but GAIM sometimes get stuck on reconnect
2006-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	/etc/X11/xorg.conf -> pastebin
2006-04-22T09:22:00.000Z	blindx	DBO	http://pastebin.com/664329 -- but keep in mind, that's after re-running dpkg-reconfigure outside of the gdm because gdm wouldn't load..

2006-04-22T09:26:00.000Z	blindx	DBO	I'm in 1280x1024 now, great..
2006-04-22T09:27:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	are you sure your monitor supports a higher refresh rate?
2006-04-22T09:28:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	okies, lemme look
2006-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	are you able to change the refresh rate in System -> Preferences -> resolution
2006-04-22T09:31:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	I know where the problem is, erm, I just suck at the math
2006-04-22T09:31:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	what refresh rate does it normally run?
2006-04-22T09:31:00.000Z	blindx	DBO	60
2006-04-22T09:32:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	on your monitor there should be printed (probably somewhere on the back) the horizontal and vertical sync (they will be ranges givin in hertz)
2006-04-22T09:34:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	for vert or horizontal?
2006-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	blindx	DBO	I don't see a refresh rate on the back of my monitor...
2006-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	ok, please hold... and try not to have a seizure
2006-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	DBO	blindx	what monitor?
