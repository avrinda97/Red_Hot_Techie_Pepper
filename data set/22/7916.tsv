2005-11-28T13:57:00.000Z	Stormx2		remind me how to remove a dir with rm?
2005-11-28T13:57:00.000Z	Stormx2		there are a couple of options I need
2005-11-28T13:57:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	rm -fr, although you should use rmdir
2005-12-07T15:31:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	cp -av
2005-12-07T15:31:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	for example,   cp -av /x/y/z/. /a/b/.
2005-12-07T15:31:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	or, to the current directory, cp -av /x/y/z/. .
2005-12-07T15:32:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	sorry stock, I meant storm2, the dots are part of the command
2005-12-07T15:32:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	the v part just means verbose, but I like to use it and see what's happening
2006-01-01T09:19:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	primary
2006-01-01T09:19:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	don't use logical unless you are out of primaries
2006-01-01T09:19:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	if you won't need to create additional partitions, then definitely primary
2006-01-01T09:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	sethk	He needs to add ubuntu partitions
2006-01-01T09:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	sethk	he's leaving 10gb unallocated for that
2006-01-01T09:20:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	how many?
2006-01-01T09:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	sethk	1 ext3 one swap.
2006-01-01T09:20:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	if you are going to need more than four, total, then you will have to use logical.
2006-01-01T09:20:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	but if you only need 4 or fewer, make them all primary
2006-03-07T15:09:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	that doesn't make sense, you can't run gnome-terminal before X is up.  but probably you are confused and your requirement has nothing to do with gnome-terminal
2006-03-07T15:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	sethk	GNOME startup.
2006-03-07T15:10:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	what about gnome startup?
2006-03-07T15:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	sethk	When my desktop loads, X is running.
2006-03-07T15:11:00.000Z	sethk	Stormx2	and?
