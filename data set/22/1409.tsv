2010-10-06T20:04:00.000Z	Benkinooby		hi, this is a bit off-topic, but i think this is the best place to ask: i was told that using irc without proxy is quite risky, because it exposes the own ip. so it is advisable to use a irc-proxy. so i want to know: is is necessary to get an irc-proxy, and if yes, do you know a trustworthy one?
2010-10-06T20:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 i dont consider it risky.
2010-10-06T20:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 if you want a 'cloak' to hide your ip - thats aviliable.
2010-10-06T20:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 ive not used a proxy to irc in like... 20 years.. :)
2010-10-16T15:23:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	this is what i read too. i was wondering if some1 allready tried it him/herself
2010-11-13T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 one is for an encrypted home PARTITION i imagine.. the other is for the users to have their own encrypted HOME. (to protect from other users perhaps?)
2010-11-13T15:15:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	ah, i forgot that also other users share the /home partition :P what you say is quite plausible. so now, my home floder is double encrypted Oo
2011-01-09T15:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 use the package manager and remove the old kernels..
2011-01-09T15:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 your suggestionis like the worse way :)
2011-01-09T15:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 ubuntu-tweak has a little gui tool to do some cleanup also. I suggest leaving at least 2 kernels.
2011-01-09T15:17:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	i don't understand why, for example, ubuntu opts to generate the grub.cfg instead of working on it directly... sometimes it makes things more complicated than they are.... anyways thank you for your hint about NOT removing these files from hand
2011-01-09T15:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 idiot proofing and flexiablity..
2011-01-09T15:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 the way the old grub  config/menu  was a combonation of both the grub config AND settings files for update-grub was much more confuiseing and problematic
2011-01-09T15:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	so i have to remove the old kernel headeer packages?
2011-01-09T15:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 never noticed. if you are remioving the old kernels.. that would make sence
2011-01-09T15:22:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	can't follow you... are you speaking about removing the headers?
2011-01-09T15:30:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	so can i safly remove the old kernel headers too?
2011-01-09T15:34:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	sandhu let me hel you sandhu, i allready installed it
2011-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 ive never seen the issue.. or heard of anyone else with the issue.
2011-01-24T20:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 when you plug it in  check 'dmesg' output, near the bottom it should mentoon what /dev/sd# or /dev/sr# it is.
2011-01-24T20:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Benkinooby	 or try some other burning app like k3b, or gtoaster, or others
2011-01-24T20:06:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dr_Willis	my dmesg output sees something http://pastebin.com/TXRTjdvy
