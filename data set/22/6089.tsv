2007-08-31T14:36:00.000Z	multiverse		When I use nvidia-glx-config and nvidia-xconfig for my nVIDIA Quadro NVS 140M, PC Card/ PCIe and I restart my computer, I get a black screen.
2007-08-31T14:37:00.000Z	multiverse		That is what I have installed at the moment.
2007-08-31T14:38:00.000Z	multiverse		I'm trying to get an xorg.conf that works.
2007-08-31T14:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	what did you do that caused it?
2007-08-31T14:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	ok.. had to be more than that, or did it never work?
2007-08-31T14:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	can youu boot to a cli?
2007-08-31T14:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-08-31T14:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	just take all defaults, don't worry about proper configuring, just try to get a bootable GUI.
2007-08-31T14:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	is it working?
2007-08-31T14:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	if its done, yes
2007-08-31T14:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	did you just take the defaults on everything?
2007-08-31T14:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	yes, see what it says the prob is.
2007-08-31T14:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	usually defaults will get you to a GUI.
2007-08-31T14:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	ok, so its a screen issue.
2007-08-31T14:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	are you sure you saved when you used all the defaults?
2007-08-31T14:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	wel, you can try that.
2007-08-31T14:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	right... i don't tihnk its gonna work at this point.
2007-08-31T14:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	and you've not gotten this system to work, correct?...
2007-08-31T14:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	ok.
2007-08-31T14:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	join me in /join #indygunfreak
2007-09-01T06:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	did you have any luck?
2007-11-21T10:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	multiverse	its basically a CLI based IRC client
