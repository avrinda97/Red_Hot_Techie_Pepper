2009-03-06T08:58:00.000Z	coreyman		i stuck /dev/sda3 in fstab to mount at startup, but its not mounting.... what am i doing wrong
2009-03-06T08:59:00.000Z	coreyman		bastid_razor can you give me some syntax to use to mount /dev/sda3 in /home on startup with a variable UUID
2009-03-06T09:00:00.000Z	coreyman		oh i realize that, i need the other syntax bastid_razor
2009-03-06T09:01:00.000Z	coreyman		bastid_razor like UUID= 12421048721491274 /home stuff here
2009-03-06T09:01:00.000Z	coreyman		thanks bastid_razor
2009-03-06T09:02:00.000Z	coreyman		see you later bastid_razor
2009-03-06T09:02:00.000Z	coreyman		mean_admin try to format it?
2009-03-06T09:02:00.000Z	coreyman		mean_admin or do you have files on it.
2009-03-06T09:03:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	coreyman	no files but I've formatted it once wiht gpartioner from inside the system
2009-03-06T09:03:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	coreyman	I don't understand, why didn't gparted work from inside the OS ?
2009-03-06T09:05:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	coreyman	good enough for me :)
2009-03-06T09:35:00.000Z	coreyman	Mean_Admin	ubuntu doesn't auto mount partitions that aren't the one you installed with, you have to edit fstab
2009-03-06T09:36:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	coreyman	yeah you're right, however, it can't even mount it ad-hoc (well actually, it's so much more weird than that, I just can't grasp what's happening)
2009-03-06T09:37:00.000Z	coreyman	Mean_Admin	have you tried doing a cmd line approach
2009-03-06T09:37:00.000Z	coreyman	Mean_Admin	what is the actual name of the drive
2009-03-06T09:38:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	coreyman	I don't know! :(
2009-03-06T09:38:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	coreyman	don't know how to list mountable partitions
2009-03-06T09:38:00.000Z	coreyman	Mean_Admin	: sudo mount -t /dev/sda3 /mnt
2009-03-06T09:39:00.000Z	coreyman	Mean_Admin	sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt
2009-03-06T09:43:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	coreyman	sorry, heh, so, "/dev/sda3" shoud be replaced by the real name ?
2009-03-06T09:44:00.000Z	coreyman	Mean_Admin	yes, but that's likely the name
2009-03-06T09:45:00.000Z	coreyman	Mean_Admin	brb
