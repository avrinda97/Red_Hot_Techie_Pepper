2010-06-04T00:30:00.000Z	Exavion	dragoneye	Eclipse IDE - it does most languages fairly well, and its plugin support expands the possibilities, I would look into that
2010-06-04T00:31:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	 Tank you , I will take a look at it :-D
2010-06-04T00:40:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	 Eclipse makes me download 335MB   X)
2010-06-04T00:41:00.000Z	Exavion	dragoneye	Its a very inclusive IDE, but it has a massive support base and has built in support for most languages, and if not, plugins expand the functionality
2010-06-04T00:41:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	Cant wait to try it out :-D
2010-06-04T00:42:00.000Z	Exavion	dragoneye	I develop Android application on it, the SDK provides an Android emulator and support for APIs with barely any additional setup
2010-06-04T00:42:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	 Cool, then I also need an Android phone, where can i download that?
2010-06-04T00:43:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	:-p
2010-06-04T00:45:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	I have been reading a little on Android.  Im going for SE X10.  I even downloaded Android SDK.   But i dont need that now that im downloading Eclipse, right?
2010-06-04T00:46:00.000Z	Exavion	dragoneye	Android SDK integrates into Eclipse if you get the plugin, which makes life easier if you are interested in Android dev
2010-06-04T00:46:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	Nice.
2010-06-04T01:30:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	Do you know how you can zoom text in the "Help - Eclipse" window?  Its so tiny now, i have to sit with my nose into my screen to read :-)
2010-06-04T01:42:00.000Z	Exavion	dragoneye	Try using CTRL and Plus or Minus - it might work, I havent had that problem, it might be a setting on your system
2010-06-04T01:42:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	tested it, dont work.

2010-06-04T01:46:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	Im reading it now , thank you :-)
2010-06-04T01:56:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	This is the gold tip: Window -> Preferences -> Help and here I can choose to use an exernal browser, then i'm saved :-)
2010-06-04T01:58:00.000Z	Exavion	dragoneye	Glad it helped, I didnt really read it through yet - Im actually fairly new to eclipse.  Hope the IDE helps you out!
2010-06-04T01:59:00.000Z	Exavion	dragoneye	If you want more direct advice, joining #eclipse might be of some use to you
2010-06-04T01:59:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	Im on the roll ;-)  Now the help is comming up in firefox where i can scroll with ctrl-mouse wheel :-)
2010-06-04T01:59:00.000Z	dragoneye	Exavion	ill do that, tank you :-D
