2008-10-05T15:31:00.000Z	karelm		Hi, I'm running in vmware on my mac and I'm trying to mount my mac home folder in a subfolder of my homefolder on linux. Added the needed stuff to fstab file and it works... except that I cannot enter some of the subfolders and there is a "lock" icon on all subfolders including these I can enter. In principle I can chmod the folders I cannot access which would maybe solve that problem... but I'm not sure that's a good idea (I suppose os x l
2008-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	doesn't your VM on mac offer an option to "mount" a folder as a drive in the VM?
2008-10-05T15:34:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	i dont think chmod on your home folder in osx is a good idea... that could mess things up for you
2008-10-05T15:34:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	I don't really know, but I want to use it later on on a real machine so I'd like to know from the linux side directly ;)
2008-10-05T15:34:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	exactly what I was thinking
2008-10-05T15:34:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	but weird thing is that I have all rights when mounting using nautilus :S
2008-10-05T15:34:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	usually you shouldn't share your home folder because you would need to chmod it anyways for read and write access and that is not a good idea, it messes things up... share a folder inside your home folder instead
2008-10-05T15:35:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	I use it for synchronizing across systems etc... so I kinda need to (it's password protected etct though)
2008-10-05T15:35:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	hmm well im not too experienced with that aspect...
2008-10-05T15:36:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	oh well, thanks anyway ;)
2008-10-05T15:36:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	can you create a public home folder to share?
2008-10-05T15:38:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	It shouldn't be on the os x side I think. I mean, on windows I have it setup as a network drive and I can just easily copy files etc
2008-10-05T15:38:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	yeah i know what you mean but windows is much less secure than linux
2008-10-05T15:38:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	seems more like that although the smb login is correct, it sees "me" as a different user
2008-10-05T15:39:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	did you try the IP address instead of the host name of the machine? sometimes the host name cant be found unless its in your fstab, even if you have a router that acts as a DNS
2008-10-05T15:40:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	pretty sure I'm using the ip as I have it statically mapped on my router, but let me check
2008-10-05T15:40:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	yep
2008-10-05T15:41:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	try this link out, it should help you with your problem. https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/31919
2008-10-05T15:42:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	basically use ssh server instead to share the home folder. sorry for not being more helpful, im uber tired lol
2008-10-05T15:43:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	yeah no problem, i'm happy someone is trying ;), doesn't seem like the solution I want though :(
2008-10-05T15:43:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	karelm	try later in the day, when the experts are awake
2008-10-05T16:37:00.000Z	karelm	Daft_Punk	just to let you know I was able to fix it by simply adding uid=.... to the mount command (also had a problem with credentials but ok)
