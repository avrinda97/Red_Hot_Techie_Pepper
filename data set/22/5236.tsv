2008-02-28T03:15:00.000Z	arrrghhh		ok i'd like to clarify some things.  7.10 of ubuntu uses emerald as the default window manager and NOT metacity, correct?
2008-02-28T03:15:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	wrong
2008-02-28T03:16:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	it uses compiz if your comp supports it
2008-02-28T03:16:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	emerald is not a window manager.  it is a window decorator for compiz.
2008-02-28T03:16:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	there's also gtk-window-decorator that lets compiz use metacity themes
2008-02-28T03:17:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	ok, i have a computer that doesn't support compiz.  and it's turned off completely.  the title bars from all windows disappear.  i found a fix (from this room) "metacity --replace" fixes it.  but it doesn't stick after reboot.
2008-02-28T03:18:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	check system -> pref -> sessions and make sure its not trying to run compiz
2008-02-28T03:18:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	ok hold on...
2008-02-28T03:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	it doesn't look like it's trying to run compiz... i see metacity in the "current session" section... but where would i find it?
2008-02-28T03:26:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	not current session. the startup
2008-02-28T03:26:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	also go to system -> pref -> appearances and make sure desktop effects is disabled
2008-02-28T03:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	i checked the second place already, desktop effects are disabled.  under startup there's just a thing that says "Visual: Autostart the preferred AT".  but nothing that's close to compiz
2008-02-28T03:28:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	unless you need an on-screen keyboard due to a physical disability, you can disable that
2008-02-28T03:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	ok... but compiz isn't listed.  so i just want the "metacity --replace" setting to stick after a reboot, because after i rebooted the titlebars disappeared again.
2008-02-28T03:31:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	could add "metacity --replace" to the startup i suppose
2008-02-28T03:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	i guess... i'd really rather know what the underlying problem is, and why that fixes it.
2008-02-28T03:31:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	compiz is finding a way to run.  you could just uninstall it
2008-02-28T03:32:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	i thought it was integrated into 7.10... can i just uninstall with synaptic?
2008-02-28T03:32:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	yeah
2008-02-28T03:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	so just as i would assume there is no way to uninstall compiz it seems... unless you have a way, it's certainly not listed in add/remove programs.  aptitude couldn't seem to find it either.
2008-02-28T03:43:00.000Z	macogw	arrrghhh	apt-cache search compiz
2008-02-28T03:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	macogw	uh... ok?  is that just installed programs or all avaliable?
