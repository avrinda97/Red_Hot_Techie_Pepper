2011-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	jrt4		I'm trying to get Flash to work with 11.04
2011-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	jrt4		flashplugin-installer isn't working
2011-06-30T14:15:00.000Z	jrt4		I installed it, but Firefox keeps telling me I need the plugin
2011-06-30T14:17:00.000Z	jrt4		What can I do if flashplugin-installer doesn't work?
2011-06-30T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	how doesn't it work, what error ?
2011-06-30T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	what version of firefox are you using ?
2011-06-30T14:18:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	5.0
2011-06-30T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	was it 5 installed from the main repos or from a ppa ?
2011-06-30T14:19:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	main repos
2011-06-30T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	that really shouldn't be a problem then on paper
2011-06-30T14:19:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	I didn't do anything unusual. This is just straight from the default install.
2011-06-30T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	should work then
2011-06-30T14:21:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	What can I do to figure out what is wrong?
2011-06-30T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	find the flash lib on the file system
2011-06-30T14:22:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	Do I delete it when I find it?
2011-06-30T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	no - just see where it is
2011-06-30T14:25:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	Ahh -- I figured it out, sort of. I just tried to install using apt-get from command line (after purging) and what is happening is that the download is failing, but the package is still thinking its installed.
2011-06-30T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	excellent find, well done
2011-06-30T14:25:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	should that be filed as a bug? shouldn't it fail to install the package if the download fails
2011-06-30T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	why is it failing, does it give an error ?
2011-06-30T14:26:00.000Z	jrt4	ikonia	404 not found. I'll probably just download the package from adobe
2011-06-30T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	jrt4	then yes, there probably is already a bug if they have moved/changed the package
