2012-02-07T06:59:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	are you sure you booting from the CD
2012-02-07T07:03:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	have you tried booting to a cmdline , would probably bypass graphics issues
2012-02-07T07:04:00.000Z	tiago	recon69_lap	how can i do so?
2012-02-07T07:04:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	try hitting f1-f6 while its booting
2012-02-07T07:07:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	or you can hit any key when you get the little icon , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
2012-02-07T07:08:00.000Z	tiago	recon69_lap	f2 will show me the bios but that's it
2012-02-07T07:09:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	skip f2, and let it get passed the bios screen before hitting keys
2012-02-07T07:09:00.000Z	tiago	recon69_lap	that logo shows up, and the menu also, that's the menu that doesn't do anything
2012-02-07T07:09:00.000Z	tiago	recon69_lap	ok
2012-02-07T07:09:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	you look at that link i posted
2012-02-07T07:11:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	and how do you mean it does nothing? is it lockedup
2012-02-07T07:11:00.000Z	tiago	recon69_lap	yep the logo and menu that show up are the ones in that site. When i mean nothing i mean it just boots back into this same menu
2012-02-07T07:12:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	have you done the check cd for defects
2012-02-07T07:13:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	a few years ago spent ages tring to workout why my rig was crashing, eventuly worked out the cpu was overheating
2012-02-07T07:15:00.000Z	tiago	recon69_lap	how can I get to the bottom of the problem?
2012-02-07T07:15:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tiago	think we might be getting a answer soon
