2009-10-31T11:19:00.000Z	node357		Waited a year for Ubuntu to support my sound card, now I have to wait another 6 months.
2009-10-31T11:20:00.000Z	node357	DaveyAM	I checked Synaptic. Go to settings -> Preferences, then Network, then select Direct Connection
2009-10-31T11:21:00.000Z	DaveyAM		i did that..
2009-10-31T11:21:00.000Z	DaveyAM		and nothings happend
2009-10-31T11:21:00.000Z	DaveyAM		its try to connect to proxy
2009-10-31T11:22:00.000Z	DaveyAM		i dont know why because iam using direct dhcp for all my settings.. :(
2009-10-31T11:23:00.000Z	DaveyAM		and now i cant download anything..
2009-10-31T11:23:00.000Z	node357		okay enzyme, I will try it.. I just wish I could rely on apt to keep things updated instead of having to compile every time the kernel is updated
2009-10-31T11:23:00.000Z	node357		Maybe it's a bug DaveyAM, and if it is I'm really sorry.
2009-10-31T11:23:00.000Z	DaveyAM		what i can do?
2009-10-31T11:24:00.000Z	DaveyAM		synaptic haven't one conf file?
2009-10-31T11:24:00.000Z	node357	DaveyAM	I'll look.
