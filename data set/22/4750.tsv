2008-10-31T23:24:00.000Z	bryant		has anyone had trouble running flash applications/animations on firefox or epiphany? any time i attempt to go to a site with such things it overloads my cpu and cant effectively render anything. I've tried gnash swfdec and adobe plugins but issue still persists. My proprietary drivers for my graphics card are activated so they shouldn't be the issue. I'm running the 8.10 release
2008-10-31T23:24:00.000Z	bryant		be->there's codecs you can get for those in the package manager you can install
2008-10-31T23:24:00.000Z	bryant		ben*
2008-10-31T23:26:00.000Z	bryant		so nobody can help me with the flash issue? :/
2008-10-31T23:26:00.000Z	bryant		okay
2008-10-31T23:27:00.000Z	bryant		simple animations it renders, but complex ones that i know what are supposed to look like, it nearly crashes my computer.
2008-10-31T23:29:00.000Z	bryant		it would be nice if ubuntu had torrent support for downloading installation updates and packages inside the synaptic manager... the current bandwidth to the official site to download such things is worse than my emergency dialup ISP :<
2008-10-31T23:31:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	have you tried using another server? I think you can switch it in the app where you select the sources/repositories (forgot its english name). System->Administrations->Sources/Repositories?
2008-10-31T23:32:00.000Z	bryant	TwoD	ah yes, i see! thank you. learning new stuff everyday.
2008-10-31T23:33:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	yw =)
2008-10-31T23:36:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	what kind of issues?
2008-10-31T23:39:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	well that's a kernel panic. I get LOTS of those if I try to read (not when writing!) files on one of my NTFS disks, which I know has damaged clusters.
2008-10-31T23:41:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	ok, then it's probably something else. Most likely hardware related as it gets to a kernel panic, I'm no expert on kernel panics, but I think it's possible to get a crash dump when it occurss, then someone could perhaps trace it back to the driver/program crashing.
2008-10-31T23:42:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	don't think so. But I have added an icon to force-crashing a program to one of my panels. It's there if you right click and "add to panel".
2008-10-31T23:43:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	you could also use ctrl+alt+f1 to get to the terminal, if the window manager froze and you can't start xterm, and then try "killall appname"
2008-10-31T23:54:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	what exactly did you do=
2008-10-31T23:55:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	ok, all this to the same hdd? Or do you have more?
2008-10-31T23:58:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	ok. Have you run a disk check on them?
2008-11-01T00:01:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	random guess here, but could it be a RAM issue? Or perhaps related to the graphics card. Those graphichs bugs might be a clue..
2008-11-01T00:05:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	maybe a good idea if you don't feel like reinstalling again. Not easy to find the source of problems like that when no hardware has changed recently...
2008-11-01T00:07:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	no, not that I'm aware of.
2008-11-01T00:07:00.000Z	TwoD	bryant	what I meant was really "if you don't feel like reinstalling the same version..."
