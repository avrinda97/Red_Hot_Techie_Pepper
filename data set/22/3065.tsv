2008-12-17T19:04:00.000Z	Eaglebird		windows doesn't like linux partitions
2008-12-17T19:05:00.000Z	Eaglebird		so how do I change it back?
2008-12-17T19:05:00.000Z	Eaglebird		no no
2008-12-17T19:05:00.000Z	Eaglebird		I want windows to default once.
2008-12-17T19:05:00.000Z	Eaglebird		So basically, boot into ubuntu, set windows default, restart, get windows
2008-12-17T19:06:00.000Z	Eaglebird		restart again, get ubuntu. restart again, get ubuntu. restart, ubuntu. set default windows, restart, windows.
2008-12-17T19:06:00.000Z	Eaglebird		Basically when I'm in ubuntu, I set windows as default. The windows entry has "savedefault 0" to revert back to ubuntu
2008-12-17T19:07:00.000Z	Eaglebird		so when it loads windows, it also reverts the default back to ubuntu
2008-12-17T19:07:00.000Z	Eaglebird		It would be simple, really, if the /boot/grub/default file worked
2008-12-17T19:07:00.000Z	Eaglebird		so why doesn't it work
2008-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	no
2008-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	grub is not dynamic like you want
2008-12-17T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	just menually update your /boot/grub/menu.lst to have Default point to the windows partition rather than ubuntu
2008-12-17T19:04:00.000Z	Eaglebird	ikonia	No, because then I have to have a keyboard attached if I want to get back into ubuntu :P
2008-12-17T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	how are you running a command without a keyboard
2008-12-17T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	errrr then yhou can edit the file over ssh
2008-12-17T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	oh I see you want to change the grub default whie in windows
2008-12-17T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	grub is not dynamic like that
2008-12-17T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	I don't know/think that will work
2008-12-17T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	it doesn't so that can't be helped
2008-12-17T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Eaglebird	speak to the grub developers, grub has not been developed for ages
2008-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	Eaglebird	ikonia	Would it be possible to point the "default number" line of menu.lst to /boot/grub/default, somehow?
