2011-08-09T20:28:00.000Z	damagednoob		i'm trying to get my networking working. i can resolve dns correctly and ping addresses but i can't download a webpage. can anyone help me?
2011-08-09T20:29:00.000Z	damagednoob		i've set a static ip via /etc/network/interfaces
2011-08-09T20:30:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	did you set a gateway/route?
2011-08-09T20:31:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	so you can resolve dns hosts? and you can ping them?
2011-08-09T20:31:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	yes
2011-08-09T20:32:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	so your problem is downloading something using wget?
2011-08-09T20:33:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	yes, that's how i'm testing my access to the internet
2011-08-09T20:33:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	what error does it give?
2011-08-09T20:33:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	Connecting to 72.14.207.99:80... failed: Connection timed out.
2011-08-09T20:37:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	this is a vm?
2011-08-09T20:37:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	maybe your networking is broken or configured wrong
2011-08-09T20:38:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	maybe, but i don't understand why i can ping external sites and resolve dns
2011-08-09T20:39:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	what type of networking did you configure?
2011-08-09T20:41:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	I originally set it up as dhcp and am now trying to configure a static ip because this vm is going into production, my networking is here: http://pastebin.com/mGh1QBqM
2011-08-09T20:43:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	is that bridged network?
2011-08-09T20:45:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	i'm using hyper-v so the terminology is a bit different. they call it 'external' which translates to this: 'Creates a connection to a physical network adapter so that virtual machines can access a physical network.'. I'm pretty sure the answer to your question is yes though
2011-08-09T20:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	maybe some firewall blocks your traffic
2011-08-09T20:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	never worked with hyper-v
2011-08-09T20:47:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	i just used wget to download from an internal web server using it's FQDN
2011-08-09T20:48:00.000Z	mgolisch	damagednoob	still that server has a different ip so it could still be some rule in your outbound firewall
2011-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	yeah i agree with you
2011-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	damagednoob	mgolisch	i'll speak to our ops guys about it. thanks for you help
