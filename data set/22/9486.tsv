2004-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	aan234		Hi. I installed the latest Ubuntu, and can someone help me configure the wireless?
2004-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	aan234		thanks.
2004-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	aan234		How do I setup wlan0 interface? 
2004-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	aan234		eth0 is properly linked to my network card and it's working..
2004-10-25T14:51:00.000Z	aan234		but wireless lan is not working..
2004-10-25T14:51:00.000Z	aan234		I have already loaded the module for it.
2004-10-25T14:53:00.000Z	aan234		Anyone?
2004-10-25T14:53:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	I actually just made a script that send the information needed to iwconfig :)
2004-10-25T14:54:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	Also the novell wireless control applet is worth looking at.
2004-10-25T14:56:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	open an editor, but #!/bin/bash on the first line, then "sudo iwconfig eth0 your-commands-here" on the second line, then "ifup eth0" or "dhclient eth0" on the third line.
2004-10-25T15:00:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	that could be a problem.
2004-10-25T15:01:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	Have you tried the network application under "Computer"
2004-10-25T15:03:00.000Z	aan234	wm_eddie	the part where I have to put interface wlan0 or eth0 is blank, cna't change it.
2004-10-25T15:08:00.000Z	aan234	wm_eddie	thanks btw.. let me know if you can think of something. 
2004-10-25T15:16:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	what if prism2_usb is called something else already?
2004-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	aan234	wm_eddie	how do I check that? thanks
2004-10-25T15:22:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	try greping for wlan and eth too
2004-10-25T15:24:00.000Z	aan234	wm_eddie	done. nothing interesting..
2004-10-25T15:26:00.000Z	aan234	wm_eddie	what should I look for?
2004-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	I couldn't find anything on google about that error.
2004-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	does it boot though?
2004-10-25T15:41:00.000Z	wm_eddie	aan234	ftp://ftp.linux-wlan.org/pub/linux-wlan-ng/ the FAQ and README have some interesting info... but since I can't test it I don't know how interesting.
