2008-04-29T05:48:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk		lynet: is there a better way of dual booting?
2008-04-29T05:48:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	you used the gnome partition editor? you probably have to right click on the partitions in the editor, and click unmount first
2008-04-29T05:48:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	it's not a way to dual-boot, you *have* to repartition to dual boot
2008-04-29T05:50:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk	astro76	how do i do this?
2008-04-29T05:50:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk		stroganoff: does it work well?
2008-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	I'm not sure how else to rephrase right click on the partitions and click unmount ;)
2008-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	you used System > Admin > partition editor on the livecd right?
2008-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk	astro76	then what after that?
2008-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	then try to resize
2008-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk	astro76	 no
2008-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	I would recommend doing so rather than doing the install personally
2008-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk		ok
2008-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	*during the install
2008-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk		well tks
2008-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	or use the guided option
2008-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk		ya that doesent ever work for me
2008-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk		It has a tendency to erase my hard drive whenev er i do that astro76
2008-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk	astro76	 what what the heck, theres nothing to loose, just crappy windows
2008-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	I usually use gparted livecd or system rescue cd, because the ubuntu livecd has a tendency to automount the partitions and getting in the way
2008-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	astro76		!gparted | Psyco_Chipmunk
2008-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	Psyco_Chipmunk	astro76	 does unmounting erase it
2008-04-29T05:54:00.000Z	astro76	Psyco_Chipmunk	no
