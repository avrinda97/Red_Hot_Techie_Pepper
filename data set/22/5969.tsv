2011-08-16T19:12:00.000Z	doritey		Hi. What does LTS mean.
2011-08-16T19:12:00.000Z	doritey		I don't understand from reading the description on the Ubuntu site.
2011-08-16T19:12:00.000Z	doritey		Yes but what does it actually mean
2011-08-16T19:12:00.000Z	doritey		What does "will be supported for 3 years" men
2011-08-16T19:12:00.000Z	doritey		mean*
2011-08-16T19:12:00.000Z	doritey		Get updates?
2011-08-16T19:12:00.000Z	doritey		I don't understand.
2011-08-16T19:13:00.000Z	doritey		I know what an update is, but I still don't see how the versions differ.
2011-08-16T19:13:00.000Z	doritey		How does 10.04 regular differ from 10.04 LTS
2011-08-16T19:13:00.000Z	doritey		LTS means "long-term-support" but I don't understand what this means in that context
2011-08-16T19:14:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	10.04 is supported for 3-5 years depending on if you're talking about desktop or server packages.
2011-08-16T19:15:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	11.04 is a year older than 10.04 (version numbers indicate the YEAR.MONTH of release)
2011-08-16T19:15:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	er, newer*
2011-08-16T19:16:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	LTSes are every two years.
2011-08-16T19:16:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	Whats wrong?
2011-08-16T19:18:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	It means that security packages are available for 3-5 years depending on which packages you are talking about and supported in community support places like here.
2011-08-16T19:19:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	Perhaps something that discusses how software is installed and updated in Ubuntu would be helpful?
2011-08-16T19:20:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	Let me find a good link.
2011-08-16T19:20:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware is rather informative.
2011-08-16T19:21:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	Think about this: A non LTS release gets updates for just 18 months. In an LTS you could have that install running for 5 years and continue to recieve updates.
2011-08-16T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	They are every two years. And the decision is made before work on the release begins.
2011-08-16T19:24:00.000Z	Pici	doritey	The link that r_a_f posted has a great image of how the LTSes are supported.
