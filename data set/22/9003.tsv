2005-04-24T13:57:00.000Z	elcu		Hello, how can I install new gnome themes? i've extracted the archive file to /usr/share/themes, but it doesn't show up in the theme selection dialog.
2005-04-24T13:57:00.000Z	carthik	elcu	- choose "install theme" and then the .tar.gz file
2005-04-24T13:58:00.000Z	elcu	carthik	does it matter if it's bzipped?
2005-04-24T14:00:00.000Z	carthik	elcu	please try it. I am not sure...
2005-04-24T14:00:00.000Z	carthik	elcu	there is a whole bunch of themes in the ubuntu hoary universe repository, have you tried them?
2005-04-24T14:01:00.000Z	elcu	carthik	i tried the install method.  it won't show up still.
