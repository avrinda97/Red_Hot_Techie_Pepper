2007-05-05T09:57:00.000Z	Trax		hello
2007-05-05T09:57:00.000Z	Trax		think the better question is what isn't happening :(
2007-05-05T09:59:00.000Z	Trax		anyone know how to fix X, after installing nvidia drivers that won't uninstall becuase it can't find the old kernal source? shows compiled kernal 9631 and drivers 9755
2007-05-05T10:00:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	what did you do beforehand?
2007-05-05T10:01:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	not entirley sure, i messed around with synaptic a bit trying to get drivers to display proper resolution through kvm and ended up running nvidia drivers after that didn't help
2007-05-05T10:02:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	how did you install the nvidia-drivers? apt-get or nvidia-installer?
2007-05-05T10:03:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	hmmm.... s NVIDIA-blabal.sh -uninstall doesn't work?
2007-05-05T10:04:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	i will try that and see i had to live boot it to get here
2007-05-05T10:05:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	edit your xorg.conf on the installed system and replace nvidia with nv, so you have at least a working X
2007-05-05T10:13:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	you still around?
2007-05-05T10:13:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	yes
2007-05-05T10:14:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	where would NVIDIA-blabal.sh be located?
2007-05-05T10:18:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	so you do the same thing that you did  to install the driver, but add the uninstall parameter... sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8776-pkg1.run --uninstall
2007-05-05T10:19:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	says: invalid option --u
2007-05-05T10:19:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	maybe ist's just a single -
2007-05-05T10:20:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	how do i scroll back up if --help goes past screen length?
2007-05-05T10:21:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	generally in Unix the long commands have a -- (--uninstall), the short ones have a single - (-u)
2007-05-05T10:21:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	i seem to have gotten it :)
2007-05-05T10:26:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	i uninstalled  drivers and rebooted, i am still getting an X error on boot but this one is different. says: (EE) Failed to load module "nvidia" (module does not exist, 0) (EE) No drivers available.
2007-05-05T10:28:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf .... find the line which says: Driver "nvidia" and change that to "nv" ... then you are back on he opensource driver, have a working X and you can start over the proper way
2007-05-05T10:32:00.000Z	Trax	stefg	& IdleOne: Thank you both for your help :) that has me up :)
2007-05-05T10:33:00.000Z	stefg	Trax	right... see !nvidia
