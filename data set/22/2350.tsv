2010-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	shuaib		Hi guys, trying to setup ip masquerading on my unbuntu 9.10, but running into all sorts of iptables problems, probably the service isn't even running and chkconfig and service aren't even able to identify the service.
2010-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	shuaib		Any clue?
2010-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	shuaib		Or if someone could tell me an easeir way to convert my ubuntu machine into a wifi hotspot :)
2010-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	there is no iptables service
2010-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	then how am I supposed to setup ip masquerading on ubuntu? Or do you mean I have to setup the iptables service first?
2010-01-17T14:38:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	usually you create a script that sets up the rules
2010-01-17T14:38:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	rules for what? If iptables doesn't even exist on the system?
2010-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	it is built in to the kernel, so it is just there, waiting for you to do stuff
2010-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	any idea how to start the service?
2010-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	by default ubuntu has no listening services, so there are no rules defined
2010-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	it is not a service
2010-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	aah, then...?
2010-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	there is nothing to start
2010-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	the tutorials I am reading on net describe it so
2010-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	"sudo iptables -L" will tell you what rules are defined, there should not be any
2010-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	yea, there aren't
2010-01-17T14:41:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	just start defining things from the command line
2010-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	Aha,  There is no need for starting/restarting the service? How do I save those rules?
2010-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	coz I did define some rules, and seems like system restart has flushed them out
2010-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	aah, wish you could be here for a while
2010-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	meganerd	shuaib	yes, you need to put them in a script which is where they will be remmeberd
2010-01-17T14:43:00.000Z	shuaib	meganerd	okie
