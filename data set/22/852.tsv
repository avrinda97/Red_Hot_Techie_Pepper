2011-02-12T10:03:00.000Z	isaiah		What's a good way to troubleshoot slow network issues on ubuntu 10.10? I have a Realtek 8112L network card and my internet (and networks) speeds are terrible in ubuntu
2011-02-12T10:03:00.000Z	isaiah		I've tried disabling ipv6, using the driver directly from realtek, etc. But none of it makes any difference
2011-02-12T10:04:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	I seem to remember that the realtek had a known issue.
2011-02-12T10:04:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	Any solutions that you remember? I've tried everything I can think of
2011-02-12T10:04:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	8112L?
2011-02-12T10:05:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	Yeah
2011-02-12T10:05:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	wait one sec.
2011-02-12T10:05:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	Thanks :)
2011-02-12T10:05:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	I'm using 64 bit if that makes any difference
2011-02-12T10:08:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	what kernel version?
2011-02-12T10:08:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	2.6.35-22-generic
2011-02-12T10:10:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	you have any old kernels still installed?
2011-02-12T10:10:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	No, this was actually a fresh install of 10.10. I went back and tested and even the live cd gives me issues
2011-02-12T10:11:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	I was on 9.10 before and didn't have issues, but I forget what kernel version I was using
2011-02-12T10:11:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	what I had found, and found again was that there were posts from users stating that after 2.6.32-24 kernel upgrade, the 8112L was slow
2011-02-12T10:11:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	That was 32bit though... I'm wondering if the 64bit driver is just no good.
2011-02-12T10:12:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1540347
2011-02-12T10:13:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	Hmm.. that sucks. I'd rather not be stuck on an old version. I will take a look at that thread though
2011-02-12T10:13:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	try this one... http://www.jamesonwilliams.com/realtek-8112l-on-linux  it sounds like this jameson williams guy wrote a driver.
2011-02-12T10:14:00.000Z	isaiah	gsp2009	Thanks for the link. I will give that a try!
2011-02-12T10:14:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	sorry man. that is the best I can do for you.
2011-02-12T10:14:00.000Z	gsp2009	isaiah	yw.
