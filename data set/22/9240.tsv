2005-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	froust		"
2005-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	froust		okay... the error message is expected then?
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	froust		oh... it's a legend
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	froust		got it
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	froust		The new ati drivers are rpm's... Can ubuntu install rpms?
2005-01-29T07:41:00.000Z	daniels	froust	no, but it doesn't have to.  you'll be able to install xorg-driver-fglrx and xfree86-driver-fglrx very soon.
2005-01-29T07:42:00.000Z	daniels	froust	er?  it's the same
2005-01-29T07:42:00.000Z	daniels	froust	if you're running amd64, then xserver-xorg will be 64-bit
2005-01-29T07:43:00.000Z	daniels	froust	yeah, except that's only in hoary (the development branch).
2005-01-29T07:43:00.000Z	daniels	froust	you'll almost certainly already have it if you're running hoary
2005-01-29T07:44:00.000Z	daniels	froust	xorg has been in hoary for months
2005-01-29T07:44:00.000Z	froust	daniels	i'm talking the new ati drivers that were released today, not xorg
2005-01-29T07:44:00.000Z	daniels	froust	they'll be in by 0200 UTC, I'd imagine
2005-01-29T07:44:00.000Z	daniels	froust	they've already been uploaded
2005-01-29T07:47:00.000Z	daniels	froust	i ran them for a few minutes, went fine
2005-01-29T07:47:00.000Z	daniels	froust	(alarmingly, i test the stuff i upload ...)
2005-01-29T07:47:00.000Z	daniels	froust	um, didn't need to, it's been present in every revision of ubuntu ever
2005-01-29T07:54:00.000Z	daniels	froust	just wait like an hour
2005-02-21T12:35:00.000Z	froust	daniels	thanks
2005-02-21T12:33:00.000Z	daniels	froust	yes, it's because glibc failed to build on i3865
