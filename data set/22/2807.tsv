2009-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	nigtv		Hi, im having trouble with burning the ubuntu ISO, I have before without trouble but this time, it gets all the way done, but burn returns the error that it cannot fixate the disc, after which I can't eject the disc without resetting the computer, trying to gives me "cannot eject disc, input/output error", I've also tried burning it in k3b and gnomebaker, all times at 2x.
2009-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	nigtv		even though they all seemingly finish, I guess they dont fixate or whatever, they are all coasters, of course, failures, I'm on 9.10 by the way
2009-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	nigtv		yes, thats where i get the error
2009-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	nigtv		otherwise the drive is just unresponsive, flashing light on and off
2009-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	nigtv		the cd's? just bought them
2009-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	nigtv		I can burn audio cds just fine, actually just burned one
2009-12-18T13:31:00.000Z	nigtv		logs? where might i look?
2009-12-18T13:31:00.000Z	nigtv		rather, which logs I guess is what i should ask
2009-12-18T13:32:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	have you tried to burn at console? "cdrecord -dao speed=8 -v foo.iso"
2009-12-18T13:33:00.000Z	nigtv	llutz	well I tried to burn it with "burn" thats synonymous with cdrecord right?
2009-12-18T13:33:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	i don't know "burn", just cdrecord or of course its fork wodim
2009-12-18T13:34:00.000Z	nigtv	llutz	I usually just "sudo burn -I -n ubuntu.iso"
2009-12-18T13:34:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	only logs i could imagine, /var/log/syslog(messages)
2009-12-18T13:37:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	"burn" seems to be just another frontend to cdrdao/cdrecord, so it should work. maybe try to make it more verbos
2009-12-18T13:37:00.000Z	nigtv	llutz	to get a more descriptive error?
2009-12-18T13:37:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	yes
2009-12-18T13:40:00.000Z	nigtv	llutz	call me crazy but this looks almost exactly the same http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-546504.html
2009-12-18T13:41:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	use -rw
2009-12-18T13:41:00.000Z	nigtv	llutz	its not a rw disc?
2009-12-18T13:42:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	? i always recommend cd-rw media for live-cd/install-cds, because you only need it once. don't waste cd-r media for that
2009-12-18T13:43:00.000Z	nigtv	llutz	i dont have any r'w media, im not sure i have a burner anyways
2009-12-18T13:43:00.000Z	llutz	nigtv	i doubt that it would fix your problem, but makes testing cheaper
