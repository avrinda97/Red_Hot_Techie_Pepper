2008-10-11T04:39:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		i couldnt find one "not even nexus" fast enough to compete with rdp
2008-10-11T04:40:00.000Z	Predator106	MidnightDevil	Really?
2008-10-11T04:40:00.000Z	Predator106	MidnightDevil	God, that sucks, I can't go back to windows on that server
2008-10-11T04:40:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		yeap, i tried several vnc versions but the closest one was nexus
2008-10-11T04:40:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		and stg
2008-10-11T04:40:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		still, rdp is a LOT faster ansd
2008-10-11T04:40:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		yeap, all vnc versions were left behind
2008-10-11T04:41:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		like i said, nexus went close, but not even that close
2008-10-11T04:41:00.000Z	Predator106	MidnightDevil	aw. Were they even faster than LogMeIn?
2008-10-11T04:41:00.000Z	Predator106	MidnightDevil	\Have you used logmein
2008-10-11T04:41:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		i did, but not for that circunstances :) i dont find it that fast

2008-10-11T04:43:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		u dont Guest22484, not the same as windows
2008-10-11T04:43:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	Predator106	yeah, vnc would be great cause its already "there" as comercial and domestic product
2008-10-11T04:43:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		but nexus was the fastest one i tried
