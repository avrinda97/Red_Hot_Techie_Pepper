2009-09-22T09:37:00.000Z	innomen		xhtml*
2009-09-22T09:37:00.000Z	innomen		oh
2009-09-22T09:38:00.000Z	innomen		this is killing me i wish oo would just export to xhtml like it said it would
2009-09-22T09:39:00.000Z	innomen		i tried this tidy thing and the result is garbled beyond repair, the cli way works but i just feel veyr strongly there is a better way
2009-09-22T09:39:00.000Z	innomen		are there any tidy spesific front ends?
2009-09-22T09:40:00.000Z	innomen		i have both kmpozer and bluefish installed, kompozer dosent want to save as just xhtml, it treats html htm xhtml as all the same
2009-09-22T09:42:00.000Z	innomen		bluefish apears ot have no export function and save as has only html and xml, is xml the same as xhtml?
2009-09-22T09:43:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	you would just save the file ext to xml or html. they are just text files with markup
2009-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	innomen	mouseclone	but the app (dslibirs) is looking for an xhtml file, i'm trying to duplicate what tidy does
2009-09-22T10:19:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	have you tried scream?
2009-09-22T10:19:00.000Z	innomen	mouseclone	no
2009-09-22T10:19:00.000Z	innomen	mouseclone	is this an app or what
2009-09-22T10:20:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	it is used for html editing and web dev stuff.
2009-09-22T10:20:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	don't know if that is what you are looking for
2009-09-22T10:20:00.000Z	innomen	mouseclone	i'm just trying to convert an htm file to xhtml with something that will show me what its doing
2009-09-22T10:21:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	not sure if scream will do that..
2009-09-22T10:21:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	never hurts to do a quick install of it though
2009-09-22T10:22:00.000Z	innomen	mouseclone	its not in add remove
2009-09-22T10:23:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	screem is the name not scream
2009-09-22T10:23:00.000Z	innomen	mouseclone	oh, duhr sorry
2009-09-22T10:24:00.000Z	mouseclone	innomen	no worries I spelled it wrong
2009-09-22T10:31:00.000Z	innomen	mouseclone	 screem is neat and had a tidy option but it wouldent save as xhtml
