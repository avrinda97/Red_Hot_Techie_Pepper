2010-03-25T15:42:00.000Z	scibotic		I've run into the most bizarre problem, I get permission denied when ever I try to modify any files in my home directory.
2010-03-25T15:42:00.000Z	scibotic		But ls -l shows that the owner is set to my user, and that I should have write access.
2010-03-25T15:43:00.000Z	gottto	scibotic	try   ls -la   in a terminal to see who owns the files
2010-03-25T15:44:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	It has my user all over it, and I've done a chown -R just to be sure. Still permission denied.
2010-03-25T15:45:00.000Z	gottto	scibotic	tried logging out/in?
2010-03-25T15:45:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	Restarted etc.
2010-03-25T15:46:00.000Z	gottto	scibotic	what about    chmod +r   ?
2010-03-25T15:48:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	I can read, not modify.
2010-03-25T15:48:00.000Z	gottto		k
2010-03-25T15:48:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	chmod a+wrx still returns "permission denied" when I try to modify the file.
2010-03-25T15:49:00.000Z	gottto	scibotic	the only other thing I can think of is if it a separate partition it might be mounted readonly
2010-03-25T15:50:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	Nope, same partition.
2010-03-25T15:50:00.000Z	gottto		k
2010-03-25T15:50:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	Like I said, bizarre.
2010-03-25T15:50:00.000Z	gottto	scibotic	sure is...
2010-03-25T15:55:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	One sec, I have a weird mount attached to the home directory, looks like ecryptfs might be messing with it.
2010-03-25T15:58:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	Okay that fixed it.
2010-03-25T15:58:00.000Z	gottto	scibotic	well done :)
2010-03-25T15:59:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	After seven years of Debian SID, you kinda get use to this stuff happening.
2010-03-25T15:59:00.000Z	gottto		hehe
2010-03-25T16:00:00.000Z	scibotic	gottto	Thank you for the help, wouldn't have caught that mount if you didn't mention it.
2010-03-25T16:01:00.000Z	gottto	scibotic	np
