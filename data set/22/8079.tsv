2006-11-08T16:22:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	point your web browser at file:///usr/share/doc/awstats/html/awstats_setup.html
2006-11-08T16:23:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	will that explain how to setup the package?
2006-11-08T16:23:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	or file:///usr/share/doc/awstats/html/index.html for the index of the awstats docs
2006-11-08T16:23:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	I don't know, but that's where you can find the awstats documentation, apparently.  I've never installed it
2006-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	see also /etc/awstats/awstats.conf and /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local
2006-11-08T16:24:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	i didn't find any help in there
2006-11-08T16:30:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	do you see stuff at file:///usr/share/doc/awstats/html/awstats_setup.html ?  I see lots of help there
2006-11-08T16:31:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	I'm not finding anything about installing from apt-get install
2006-11-08T16:31:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	I found the awstats_configure.pl
2006-11-08T16:31:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	you install it like: "sudo apt-get install awstats"
2006-11-08T16:31:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	it gets run automatically periodically by cron
2006-11-08T16:31:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	I've done that
2006-11-08T16:32:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	I can't set it up because when I run awstats_configure.pl it errors out.
2006-11-08T16:33:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	I see.  let me try...
2006-11-08T16:37:00.000Z	dooglus	greenman	looks like /usr/share/doc/awstats/README.Debian tells you how to set it up for ubuntu
2006-11-08T16:38:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	hmm... i didn't see what to do in there
2006-11-08T16:39:00.000Z	greenman	dooglus	that looks like just what to do if you encounter those problems
