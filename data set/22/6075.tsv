2006-12-27T13:49:00.000Z	LameBMX		anyone here done a fakeraid install ... if so please pm me i got a few questions regarding how they got it too work
2006-12-27T13:49:00.000Z	LameBMX		also for people .. here .. mount time ... to mount local file systems .. i get a divide by 0 error
2006-12-27T13:49:00.000Z	LameBMX		fakeraid
2006-12-27T13:50:00.000Z	stefg	LameBMX	what'cha mean with 'fakeraid' ?
2006-12-27T13:50:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	driver based hardware raid ...
2006-12-27T13:51:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	ie intel 875p chipset ... ich5r southbride .. sata raid0 install
2006-12-27T13:52:00.000Z	stefg	LameBMX	ah... people tend to use the native soft-raid facilities in linux (as i do) and avoid those controllerless 'raid-adapters'
2006-12-27T13:52:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	but how do you boot it ... i got dmraid setup n junk but im having some issues when i try the harddrive boot
2006-12-27T13:52:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	dmraid needs to be updated but new package is broke etc etc
2006-12-27T13:53:00.000Z	stefg	LameBMX	i have a 100 MB non-raid /boot... where the kernel and initrd live...
2006-12-27T13:53:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	im dual booting with windows ...
2006-12-27T13:53:00.000Z	stefg	LameBMX	so am I ...
2006-12-27T13:54:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	that goes against my policy ... my other 2 harddrives are for backup only
2006-12-27T13:55:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	right now its set for /dev/mapper/isgw**** 120 for windows .. 2 for swap and the 118 for nix
2006-12-27T13:55:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	it makes it too mounting local file system the dies
2006-12-27T13:57:00.000Z	stefg	LameBMX	as i said... i can't help you much. i use softraid for my main linux /, but don't use it in win (doesn't improve performance anyway, and make things more complicated)
2006-12-27T13:58:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	id agree with softraid in windows .. dynamic cut my throughput in half ... but i do know the fakeraid in windows worked really good and hoping for the same under nix
2006-12-29T17:07:00.000Z	LameBMX	stefg	managed to get it installed .. fake raid dorcks
2006-12-29T17:07:00.000Z	stefg	LameBMX	good to hear
