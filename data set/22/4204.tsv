2008-02-22T12:30:00.000Z	TrustNoOne		Need help with wireless. I have a D-Link DWA-652. It has the ID of 168c:0023. I installed ndiswrapper and the driver and my card is recognized, but when I try to connect to a network it does not connection, my router is configured for WPA Personal and WPA2 Personal for AES and TKIP, and only my intel card is working (doesnt use ndis)
2008-02-22T12:32:00.000Z	TrustNoOne		ya my card wont even connect to nothing, i could try using WEP instead but... i have both versions of WPA with both types of encryption on my router and those arent working soooo
2008-02-22T12:34:00.000Z	TrustNoOne		I dont like wep, it only supplies encryption for wireless network, not hard wired
2008-02-22T12:35:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	i think wep and wpa are both wireless encryption protocols.  for wired youd need a vpn
2008-02-22T12:36:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	right so if you want an encrypted connection regardless of whether you're using wired or wireless, you need to use an encrpted vpn tunnel
2008-02-22T12:36:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	no, wep is wireless encryption, and so is WPA, but WPA provides wired encryption as well, its more secure than wep
2008-02-22T12:37:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	im talking about encrypted on my home network, not over the internet
2008-02-22T12:37:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	why does it need to be encrypted between your box and the router on a wired network? do you usually have crackers, script kiddies, and wardrivers using wired connections within your LAN?
2008-02-22T12:39:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	thats not it, im trying to connect my wireless adapter to my router using ndiswrapper, but i am having no luck, my router is set to use WPA personal or WPA2 personal with either TKIP or AES encryption, i didnt try WEP but i dont want to use WEP anyways, but everytime i try to connect it just times out and doesnt establish a connection even tho the driver was installed correctly and is recognized
2008-02-22T12:40:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	oo i see... im just not sure ndiswrapper does wpa then...
2008-02-22T12:40:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	according to my device ID and the list on ndiswrapper site, that it should be working, although my specific card is not listed, other cards that are similar and have the same device ID and chipset are supposedly working with WPA
2008-02-22T12:42:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	also read on a forum that this guy has the same card as me, installed this distro of linux with ndis already installed and he just installed the inf file for the driver and he said it worked perfectly, he didnt say what encryption method he was using though, but im stumped because I tried all combos of WPA and WPA2 encryption
2008-02-29T03:00:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	is it a server or a desktop?
2008-02-29T03:00:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	desktop, connected to shared drives for media playback
2008-02-29T03:00:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	sorry, its a laptop
2008-02-29T03:01:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	ubuntu's probably easier to get going for that. debian is great on servers because its so stable, but it doesnt do so well with very new laptop hardware
2008-02-29T03:01:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	this laptop is 2 years old
2008-02-29T03:01:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	mine's from july 2006
2008-02-29T03:01:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	it doesnt work with debian stable
2008-02-29T03:04:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	i burned the first debian iso image, and on the back of the disc there is this small orange splotch, at first i thought it was dirt on the disc but its brand new, and its not dirt, its part of the data layer on the disc that was just burned... is that corrupt? i never seen it before
2008-02-29T03:08:00.000Z	macogw	TrustNoOne	you got a bad cd
2008-02-29T03:09:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	macogw	well im burning the second, then third disc, if they turn out fine, then ill reburn the first one
