2011-12-16T17:29:00.000Z	can		chown looked like it may have worked
2011-12-16T17:29:00.000Z	can		i restarted
2011-12-16T17:29:00.000Z	can		and it ended me up on a text-full screen ending in mountall: disconnected from plymouth
2011-12-16T17:29:00.000Z	can		or something comparable
2011-12-16T17:29:00.000Z	can		i restarted again, bootup worked, but the login procedure still fails
2011-12-16T17:30:00.000Z	can		negative
2011-12-16T17:30:00.000Z	can		pertinent info: i tried deleting my hashed password from the shadow file
2011-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	can		i was certain only to delete between the :'s
2011-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	can		but that was because i had lost my password before that
2011-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	can	you should probably expand on what "tried" means
2011-12-16T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	can	in the future, just use the "recovery mode" option from the grub menu.  Do you have a sane shadow file currently?
2011-12-16T17:34:00.000Z	can	jrib	i used that method
2011-12-16T17:34:00.000Z	can	jrib	but i got authentication token modification errors
2011-12-16T17:35:00.000Z	can	jrib	i'm not sure what sane means in this context.
2011-12-16T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	can	what was your original question/issue you asked in this channel?
2011-12-16T17:36:00.000Z	can	jrib	my new password for my login works, as verified by ctrl alt f1 logging in; however, when i enter my password at the desktop login screen, it all goes black for a few seconds, then returns to the login screen
2011-12-16T17:36:00.000Z	jrib	can	check ~/.xsession-errors
2011-12-16T17:36:00.000Z	jrib	can	yes
2011-12-16T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	can	~ means /home/your_username
2011-12-16T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	can	I thought you didn't have a graphical interface
2011-12-16T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	can	type: gedit ~your_username/.xsession-errors
