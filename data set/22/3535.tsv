2010-06-09T01:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	The hard part is knowing which line to remove :)
2010-07-13T00:27:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	not wanting to get into a client debate - but xchat provides /lastlog too
2010-07-13T00:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	Good to know, thanks.
2010-09-26T01:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	Kernel parameters are always on a single line :)
2010-09-26T01:37:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	only teasing :-)
2010-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	There is nothing offtopic about that.
2010-10-30T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	I beg your pardon? (PM if you want to discuss it :-)
2010-11-03T00:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	On *NIX systems there is no difference between opening a file in "text" or "binary" mode. This applies to md5sum.
2010-11-03T00:56:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	thx for the reminder
2010-11-03T00:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	You're welcome.
2010-11-03T01:00:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	not to argue, but do you have an idea why the man page of md5sum makes that difference (binary/text) - I supposed that the handling of white space would be different
2010-11-03T01:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	It's because it matters on windows, and so someone might see "md5sum -b" and wonder what the "-b" did. If you look at "info md5sum" it explains that on GNU/Linux there is no difference.
2010-11-03T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	thx, I read that now - I was never too comfortable with info....
2010-11-03T01:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	You're welcome.
2011-05-07T01:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	:)
2011-05-21T02:45:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	sometimes using aptitude instead of apt-get (and vice versa) helps, try (with aptitude) update, safe-upgrade  first before uninstallling anything
2011-05-21T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	Already tried that: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/610828/
2011-05-21T02:49:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	from that it looks like that package is *really* needed - why do you want to remove it?
2011-05-21T02:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	Because I only installed it a few days ago and it causes kernel panics.
2011-05-21T02:52:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	those three packages: did you install them intentionally or were they pulled in by something else? try to remove them ?
2011-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	guntbert	They are all part of a default install as far as I can tell. Trying to remove them just leads to other dependency problems while not resolving the inability to remove libdrm-nouveau1a.
2011-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	guntbert	Jordan_U	ok, was a bad idea anyway - and I have no better ones - sorry
