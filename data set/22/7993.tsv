2005-11-19T12:08:00.000Z	kdude		any samba guru here?
2005-11-19T12:09:00.000Z	kdude		I have an enabled unix account that is disabled in samba. I tried enabling it with -e but it still shows up as disabled. Any ideas?
2005-11-19T12:10:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	you might have to add it with -a first
2005-11-19T12:10:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	I tried that already..
2005-11-19T12:11:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	where are you seeing it as disabled?
2005-11-19T12:11:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	I did delete with -x  and then -a..
2005-11-19T12:11:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	you realized that /etc/passwd and samba accounts are managed seperately right?
2005-11-19T12:11:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	when I use the smbpasswd -Uuser to change the password..
2005-11-19T12:11:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	I know.
2005-11-19T12:12:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	are you running smbpaswd as root when you enable the user?
2005-11-19T12:12:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	shouldn't the samba synch take care of the linux->samba user mapping?
2005-11-19T12:12:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	no, that just syncs passwords
2005-11-19T12:12:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	yes, as su..
2005-11-19T12:12:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	try #samba
2005-11-19T12:13:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	ok I will go there.. thanks.
2005-11-19T12:14:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	how do you check the status of a user:?
2005-11-19T12:16:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	I forget how to do it via comamds, you can read /etc/passwd
2005-11-19T12:18:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	I ran the commands again -x and -a as 'su' and it works.. thanks man.
2005-11-19T12:21:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	is there any synchronisation that creates the /profiles/username automatically? Or do I have to manually create that directory myself for each user I need roaming profile for?
2005-11-19T12:21:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	I'm not samba expert, sorry
2005-11-19T12:22:00.000Z	kdude	NoUse	:) sorry ..thanks anyways.. bye.
2005-11-21T12:06:00.000Z	NoUse	kdude	this is from debian but it should work http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4613
