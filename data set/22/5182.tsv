2007-06-29T09:08:00.000Z	Obfuscator		where do i go with hibernate problems
2007-06-29T09:09:00.000Z	Obfuscator		that is, hibernate problems after resizing the swap partition
2007-06-29T09:09:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	did you run mkswap?
2007-06-29T09:10:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	nice nick :D i've run mkswap, got a new vol_id (double checked with vol_id), done swappon -va, got the UUID, pasted it in fstab and the resume-file. Also tried with /dev/sda5 directly, bypassing UUIDS. No luck
2007-06-29T09:12:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	so like...you rebooted?
2007-06-29T09:12:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	yes the swap is double the ram size (4 GB, got 2 GB ram)
2007-06-29T09:13:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	does dmesg give you any hints?
2007-06-29T09:14:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	sory, got desynched :D And yes, rebooted, restarted motd etc etc.. I tried to look in dmesg, but dunno what do grep for
2007-06-29T09:14:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	so does it crash when you resume?
2007-06-29T09:15:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	no just boots as if nothing happened. For a while i kept getting corrupt swap, but thats not happening anymore. Don't know if thats good or bad :(
2007-06-29T09:15:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	do swapoff, try to redo mkswap (with bad block checking), then reboot.... :p
2007-06-29T09:16:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	ok brb thanks
2007-06-29T09:17:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	before I start i wanted to say that the swap is working already, retry anyway?
2007-06-29T09:17:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	well, it isnt working properly
2007-06-29T09:18:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	the swap partition has to be the problem...do fdisk -l and make sure all the cylinder boundaries look good and what not
2007-06-29T09:19:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	maybe reduce swap again then? I did 2xRAM since i seemed to remember that... maybe it was RAM/2??
2007-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	well, you have those options
2007-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	something went wrong, you should be able to narrow it down
2007-06-29T09:21:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	\x6e, slimeypete ill try to look up if there is a upper limit. I increased swap since it was filling up upon hibernate, but not having hibernate at all is worse :D
2007-06-29T09:33:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	there probably isnt anything to look for....
2007-06-29T09:35:00.000Z	Obfuscator	jacktheripper	ok then :( maybe if i try with kernel parameter resume=/dev/sda5?
2007-06-29T09:35:00.000Z	jacktheripper	Obfuscator	if it was working before....i dont see why you need a parameter now
