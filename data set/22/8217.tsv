2006-02-23T12:23:00.000Z	crouton		Argh!
2006-02-23T12:24:00.000Z	crouton		libstdcc++6-4.0-dev requires g++-4.0, but g++-4.0 requires libstdcc++6-4.0-dev
2006-02-23T12:24:00.000Z	crouton		what a nice circular argument.
2006-02-23T12:25:00.000Z	crouton		anybody knowledgeable on forcing a dpkg install even if it can't be configured properly?
2006-02-23T12:27:00.000Z	crouton		that looks like a no
2006-02-23T12:27:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	what is libstdcc++6-4.0-dev
2006-02-23T12:28:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	 'standard c++ library v3 (development files)'
2006-02-23T12:28:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	is that the same as libstdc++6?
2006-02-23T12:28:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	development version thereof.  already have libstdc++6 installed.
2006-02-23T12:29:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	what I am getting at, is you have 2 c's in there, why?
2006-02-23T12:29:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	my bad, just one c.
2006-02-23T12:31:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	doesn't ubuntu have g++-4.0?
2006-02-23T12:31:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	Some background is in order.  Installed UbuntuLite from ISO.  Trying to install build-essential, but since I have no network I have to manually copy .debs over on my USB stick.
2006-02-23T12:32:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	are you using packages.ubuntu.com?  it lists all deps... or is that how you ended up with that error?
2006-02-23T12:33:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	actually, build-essential is on the ubuntu-cd iirc
2006-02-23T12:33:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	UbuntuLite is a stripped version.
2006-02-23T12:33:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	right, but wouldn't it be easier to burn an ubuntu cd and use apt to fetch build-eseential from the cdrom?
2006-02-23T12:33:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	interesting idea.
2006-02-23T12:34:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	Only went with UbuntuLite because the laptop can't install the 5.10 install - only 32M of RAM.
2006-02-23T12:35:00.000Z	_jason	crouton	oh I see, you should be able to use the ubuntu cd through apt then
2006-02-23T12:35:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	I'll give it a try then, thank you.
2006-02-24T11:23:00.000Z	crouton	_jason	There were a couple threads on the forum back when the switchover occurred
