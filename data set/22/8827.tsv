He doesn't see why preventing hoary users from installing KDE unless they install KDE 3.4.1 (a massive upgrade) is a bad idea when he admits he could easily have used kde 3.4.0 dependencies but chose not to because he thinks users should use 3.4.1. He also apparently doesn't feel the need to tell users before hand that they need kde 3.4.1 to use his package!
