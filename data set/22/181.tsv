2012-04-19T02:40:00.000Z	Zkye	fl1bbl3	I'm just desperatly looking for help on ubuntu
2012-04-19T02:42:00.000Z	Zkye		First of all I'm new to ubuntu and it's kind of complicated for me because I don't know anything about linux.
2012-04-19T02:42:00.000Z	WneASTa9		you still have to ask a question before anyone can provide help
2012-04-19T02:42:00.000Z	Zkye		So far I managed to install ubuntu 11.10 on an old PC I have
2012-04-19T02:43:00.000Z	Zkye		The first problem is that I don't know if all the hardware that is inside my desktop is actually working
2012-04-19T02:43:00.000Z	Zkye		Like my graphics card...
2012-04-19T02:43:00.000Z	WneASTa9	Zkye	if you have graphics, your graphics card is probably working ;)
2012-04-19T02:44:00.000Z	Zkye		I've looked up serveral ways to check my hardware on ubuntu but they all seem so complicaed, I have to put in commands and commands and i don't even know where
2012-04-19T02:45:00.000Z	Zkye		I have graphics, but I know like in Windows, my graphics card works when I first install Windows, but it's mostly laggy and then I need to install the actual driver and it works fine, but I don't know if ubuntu is using a backup system or if the card is fully working...
2012-04-19T02:46:00.000Z	Zkye		that's my first problem
2012-04-19T02:46:00.000Z	Zkye		second is my internet is not working... But I'll wait untill y first problem is answered
2012-04-19T02:47:00.000Z	WneASTa9	Zkye	commands and the terminal are a big part of Linux. Ubuntu does away with a lot of the need for deep digging but not all of it.
