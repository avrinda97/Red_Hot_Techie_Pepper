2008-08-06T09:30:00.000Z	kaiwen		hi, I'm trying to do an internet share connection, I'm using a crossover cable to do this, problem is, I cannot get the two machines to ping each other.
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	kaiwen		both systems are running ubuntu
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	kaiwen		yes.
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	kaiwen		it's new
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	kaiwen		wow look at all this spam
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	kaiwen		yes, 255.255.255.0
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	are you sure it is a crossover cable and not just a regular one?
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	did you set the ips to be on the same subnet?
2008-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	are you sure the crossover cable is good? :)
2008-08-06T09:32:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	that's the subnet /mask/. what are the IPs that you set for the two?
2008-08-06T09:34:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	that seems ok... can you see if the little lights on the NICs light up when you plug in the cable (just to make sure the connection is actually made?)
2008-08-06T09:36:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	hm so... and ping just times out? and both nics are "up"?
2008-08-06T09:39:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	what does route -n show?
2008-08-06T09:48:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	firewall check?
2008-08-06T09:48:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	well, did you install a firewall? try "sudo iptables --list" to list all firewall rules
2008-08-06T09:50:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	well... here's a quick test: can you plug one of the comps into a router (rather than the other comp), with the same cable, and see if you get the regular ip configuration going. if so, then you've got a straight cable rather than a crossover.
2008-08-06T09:50:00.000Z	kaiwen	therealnanotube	this is a crossover, bought from radioshack, it works windows to windows
2008-08-06T09:52:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	ah i see. ok... do both computers connect to the net when you just use a straight cable to connect to a router (this will test to make sure that both NICS are operational)?
2008-08-06T09:53:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	yes, i know you already said that - now the question is, maybe its a NIC issue (not hardware, since it works on windows - but drivers?)
2008-08-06T09:57:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	well, as i said, try connecting the two comps each to a router with a straight cable, and run the dhcp config, and see if you get net connectivity. if that works, then you'll know that it's not a driver or config issue, but just something with the way you are doing the straight comp-to-comp config. if the "normal" internet doesn't work either, then you know it's drivers - and then you can look at that stuff like joejoecirc
2008-08-06T09:58:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	btw, to private message, you can use command "/msg username". or you can use the pastebin (paste.ubuntu.com) to post extended output, then post a link to it here.
2008-08-06T10:02:00.000Z	therealnanotube	kaiwen	got what? what's the news? :)
