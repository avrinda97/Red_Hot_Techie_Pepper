2009-03-06T03:16:00.000Z	Koenigsegg		I've managed to start 8.10 for the first time without nvidia gfx driver errors(needed linux headers and restricted modules). But Screen resolution says my max resolution is still 1024x768. Nvidia X server settings is a bit nicer, 1360x768. Hardware driver routines(not 100% sure about the english menu name here) says I can only use v173 och 177, while Synaptic says I've got nvidia-glx-180 installed(I did apt-get). I'm missing something here, but I'm to
2009-03-06T03:16:00.000Z	Koenigsegg		o new on all this to see it. Help?
2009-03-06T03:18:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	try starting the nvidia config app with sudo:  sudo /usr/bin/nvidia-settings
2009-03-06T03:21:00.000Z	davygrvy		are there boot options to set a hint port address of the cd-rom drive?  xubuntu installer can't find the cd-rom at step #3 even though it just loaded from it
2009-03-06T03:22:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Thanks, it seems to be starting and all, but it says my max res is 1360x768, and I used to have 1600 width on windows, I get the feeling that something's still wrong..
2009-03-06T03:23:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 does the nvidia config app have 1600 even listed?
2009-03-06T03:24:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 it might be a pnp monitor thing
2009-03-06T03:24:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Nope, 1360x768 is at the top of the list. It's better than before though, before I got linux headers, restricted modules and nvidia glx 180 the max was 1024x768 I think.
2009-03-06T03:24:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Possible. But I hope not, I've no idea how to fix that =|
2009-03-06T03:26:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 as the saying goes, it should all just work ;)  max for me is 1920x1200 on my old 7800GTX, for which my monitor can NOT do
2009-03-06T03:27:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 does CRT-1 have the correct name of your monitor?
2009-03-06T03:28:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	That would be nice, right ;-j.. I've got a 8800GT, so I'm pretty much convinced..
2009-03-06T03:28:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Is that in nvidia x sverver settings? Checking
2009-03-06T03:29:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 under GPU1, should list the monitor.  Yeah, something is wrong
2009-03-06T03:30:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	*sigh* =[.. I don't even have GPU1, only X screen 0 and GPU 0..
2009-03-06T03:40:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 my fault, I meant GPU0
2009-03-06T03:40:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Wahey, you're alive :). Checking
2009-03-06T03:41:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Display devices: CRT-0 (CRT-0)
2009-03-06T03:41:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Was that what you wanted?
2009-03-06T03:44:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 yeah, was off screen for a bit..  I don't understand why the nvidia driver doesn't offer you any high resolutions
2009-03-06T03:44:00.000Z	davygrvy	Koenigsegg	 g2g
2009-03-06T03:44:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	davygrvy	Makes two of us then. Thanks anyway
