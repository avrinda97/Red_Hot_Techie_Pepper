2008-10-31T19:42:00.000Z	RediXe		What's a good monitor system for looking for attacks? While having a text file open I saw %systemroot%/cmd.exe and some command be written to it on it's own and kind of curious on how I can figure out how that happened.
2008-10-31T19:43:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	you need to install ubuntu
2008-10-31T19:43:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	I am running xubuntu - that's why I'm not too worried
2008-10-31T19:43:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	I just want to know where it came from
2008-10-31T19:43:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	how did you see it?
2008-10-31T19:44:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	did you see it while on windoze?
2008-10-31T19:44:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	I was coding in Code::Blocks and it just started typing to my screen. No I don't run windows on any of my machines not even in a vm.
2008-10-31T19:45:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	are you on a badlan?
2008-10-31T19:45:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	what would be a badlan?
2008-10-31T19:45:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	a lan in which your "mates" play tricks on you
2008-10-31T19:46:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	ahhh not that I'm aware of - it's an office and the only other tech savy person is my boss and he isn't in the office - I do have ssh and vnc ports forwarded to my machine - ssh is a non standard port
2008-10-31T19:46:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	add a vnc password
2008-10-31T19:47:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	or make it so that people have to ask you to let them on
2008-10-31T19:47:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	Pretty sure it requires a password
2008-10-31T19:47:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	it is almost certainly a vnc hack (sounds like)
2008-10-31T19:47:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	That's what I was thinking - I disabled port forwarding for now. I just use it to work from home sometimes
2008-10-31T19:48:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	ok
2008-10-31T19:48:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	Is there anyway to monitor attacks like that or any attacks in general?
2008-10-31T19:49:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	yes... if you make vnc request your permission; then drop down to permit after 10 seconds
2008-10-31T19:50:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	so if no-one is using it you can still vnc in
2008-10-31T19:50:00.000Z	graingert	RediXe	but if you are using it you can stop l33t l$x0rs
2008-10-31T19:51:00.000Z	RediXe	graingert	lol,
