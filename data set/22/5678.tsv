2007-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	dd		i have a problem with a motorola softmodem (sm56)
2007-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	dd		when i try to connect throw kppp i get a NO CARRIER error
2007-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	punsad	dd	is your modem set up correctly?
2007-08-26T07:43:00.000Z	dd	punsad	i tried to configure it with slmodem tool
2007-08-26T07:44:00.000Z	punsad	dd	do you know if the modem is correctly being recognized?
2007-08-26T07:44:00.000Z	dd	punsad	i tried to configure it with .scanModem too
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	punsad	dd	from your problem description, it sounds to me more like a module problem.  what module does your modem use?
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	punsad	dd	was that the moddule name?
2007-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	punsad	dd	if so... does lsmod show that it is loaded?
2007-08-26T07:47:00.000Z	dd	punsad	and it created /dev/ttySLO device
2007-08-26T07:48:00.000Z	punsad	dd	 all that sounds good.  I'll tell you right now, the last time I used a modem with linux was 6 years ago
2007-08-26T07:48:00.000Z	punsad	dd	I remember having to use the mknod command to set it up.  I  hope modem setup has come along since then
2007-08-26T07:49:00.000Z	punsad	dd	do you hear the modem trying to connect? is there a dial tone?
2007-08-26T07:50:00.000Z	dd	punsad	doing the same using wvdial i get the same error
2007-08-26T07:50:00.000Z	punsad	dd	how do you know that the module for your modem is loaded correctly?
2007-08-26T07:51:00.000Z	dd	punsad	i dont know how to know if the modem modules are loaded correctl
2007-08-26T07:51:00.000Z	punsad	dd	has this modem ever worked on the current linux installation?
2007-08-26T07:52:00.000Z	punsad	dd	or did it just stop working
2007-08-26T07:52:00.000Z	dd	punsad	this is the first time that i tried to configure it
2007-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	punsad	dd	before I would do any troubleshooting with your configuration and using different clients (wvdial, kppp, etc... ) I'd make sure that you have the right modules installed.  FOr a long time, linux didn't support modems very well.  I'm not sure if that's still not the case
2007-08-26T07:55:00.000Z	punsad	dd	that doesn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling that it's installed correctly
