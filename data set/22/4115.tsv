2008-03-15T06:57:00.000Z	Karsyth		whats the command to search for files / folders?
2008-03-15T06:57:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	GUI or command line searching? Places should have a search files option
2008-03-15T07:00:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	EX: find /etc -name *.conf --OR-- find /etc|grep conf$
2008-03-15T07:00:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	alright thanks
2008-03-15T07:04:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	looksie was giving an example of advanced find usage, but that one is somewhat dangerous, at least to wine files :)
2008-03-15T07:04:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	i havent run the command yet. i basically want to remove all folders / files associated with tine because synaptic and add / remove didnt get rid of them all
2008-03-15T07:04:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	i can still run wine commands but it wasnt properly installed, and i think until i completely remove it i will never get it properly installed
2008-03-15T07:05:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	did you try 'sudo apt-get purge wine' already?
2008-03-15T07:06:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	ill try real quick
2008-03-15T07:06:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	Package wine is not installed, so not removed
2008-03-15T07:07:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	Where are you finding wine files? in your home directory or binary executables?
2008-03-15T07:07:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	i think maybe both
2008-03-15T07:08:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	odd, I personally wouldn't delete anything, just move it all to /tmp (that directory will get wiped out when you shut down)
2008-03-15T07:09:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	does anything here look important to you? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/59644/
2008-03-15T07:15:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	do you think i need any of these? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/59644/
2008-03-15T07:15:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	sec...
2008-03-15T07:17:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	holy bejeebers thats a lot of leftovers, /usr/local/*/wine should have all been cleaned out with an uninstall..... do you get much if you run this command: 'dpkg -l|grep wine'
2008-03-15T07:18:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	it just went to a new line
2008-03-15T07:19:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	I would say anything wine related in /home or /root is fine to blow away, especially if none of it works.... I'm always hesitant to just go hacking /usr/local
2008-03-15T07:19:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	so just manually delete the folders? or should i run some command?
2008-03-15T07:23:00.000Z	andguent	Karsyth	yea, 'mv /home/karsynth/.wine /tmp' 'mv /home/karsyth/.fr-cpVA4N/.wine /tmp' 'mv /home/karsyth/.fr-tsxG8h/.wine /tmp' -- start with that
2008-03-15T07:25:00.000Z	Karsyth	andguent	that moves it to temp which is cleared on reboot correct?
