2010-05-02T03:35:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	did you try to do a hard reset for about 30 seconds. Not recomended but will most likely work
2010-05-02T03:35:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	what are you referring to?
2010-05-02T03:36:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	your pw issue I mean 30 minutes
2010-05-02T03:36:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	I'm not having a password issue
2010-05-02T03:37:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	didn't you say Is there a way to get Ubuntu to Hibernate or Shut down your computer if the screen lock password is entered too many times?
2010-05-02T03:37:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	yes, I want that set up for security: I want ubuntu to automatically do that
2010-05-02T03:38:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	sorry my mistake
2010-05-02T03:38:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	np
2010-05-02T03:39:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	haven't done this but you may want to try user groups settings their may be option in their
2010-05-02T03:45:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	I'm assuming this is on a local pc? or via internet? if it is via internet I have solution
2010-05-02T03:45:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	local pc
2010-05-02T03:51:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	have you tried using gnome-system-tools to achieve what your attempting
2010-05-02T03:53:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	how do you access gnome-system-tools?
2010-05-02T03:54:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	if not installed sudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools should already be installed
2010-05-02T03:54:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	it's installed, but how do I use it?
2010-05-02T04:00:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	pumpy	if security is really an issue I believe your going about it the wrong way. someone can still use live cd to break into pc. Try locking the bios
2010-05-02T04:02:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	I have full system encryption
2010-05-02T04:05:00.000Z	pumpy	LinuxPhreak	I have full system encryption
