2011-06-09T21:05:00.000Z	isleshocky77		Is there a way of viewing previous copy/pastes in the clipboard in ubuntu 10.10 if you haven't installed anything previously to do exactly that?
2011-06-09T21:06:00.000Z	coz_	isleshocky77	 I think zeitgeist does that but not sure
2011-06-09T21:08:00.000Z	isleshocky77	coz_	ActionParsnip: Are these something that would've need to be installed already? Or do they come stock? I just copies over something very important I need so I need one back. I know that there is software that will keep a history. But I'm wondering if gnome keeps it somewhere alrewady.
2011-06-09T21:08:00.000Z	coz_	isleshocky77	 is this 11.04..yes?
2011-06-09T21:09:00.000Z	isleshocky77	coz_	Ubuntu 10.10
2011-06-09T21:11:00.000Z	coz_	isleshocky77	 there is also something named  "diodon"  clipboard manager,, not in the repositories however
2011-06-09T21:12:00.000Z	coz_	isleshocky77	   https://launchpad.net/~diodon-team/+archive/stable
2011-06-09T21:12:00.000Z	isleshocky77	coz_	Once again though, this would've had to be already on the machine. Correct?
2011-06-09T21:13:00.000Z	coz_	isleshocky77	 well that PPA  is for installing that particular application... off hand I cant think of something already onboard for this but let me check
2011-06-09T21:14:00.000Z	isleshocky77	coz_	Yeah. I need something that I just copied over. So it would be one copy into the history of the clipboard. I'm thinking it should still be in gnomes memory or something somewhere.
2011-06-09T21:16:00.000Z	coz_	isleshocky77	 yeah I think something might have to be installed glipper  or diodon,, so far i cant find a way to display that history
2011-06-09T21:16:00.000Z	isleshocky77	coz_	shnikes. That's what I'm afraidof.
