2012-03-11T21:46:00.000Z	slothscripts		Yup. That brings the message "Loading Grub" but then it just boots as if I hadn't held it.
2012-03-11T21:47:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	you have dual or single boot?
2012-03-11T21:48:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	is it a wubi install, which means ubuntu installed from windows.
2012-03-11T21:49:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	you should be getting the windows boot menu with a choice for ubuntu.
2012-03-11T21:51:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	do you have a recovery or install disc for windows?
2012-03-11T21:52:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	strange the script is our best look at the hd for sure.
2012-03-11T21:55:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	you do not have a wubi, have you run sudu update-grub in ubuntu when you get there?
2012-03-11T21:56:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	sorry sudo update-grub
2012-03-11T21:56:00.000Z	slothscripts	Fyodorovna	I figured you meant :P But I did run it, it was suggested earlier; still the same results.
2012-03-11T21:58:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	you have 3 swaps as well.
2012-03-11T22:00:00.000Z	slothscripts	Fyodorovna	How can I go about fixing that? I'm quite new to the whole partitioning game. I have yet to change anything myself, all the installation has been done based on recommended settings on the disc or whatever.
2012-03-11T22:02:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	tghe bootscipt basically looks like you should be getting a grub menu with W7 in it not sure why. To remove the swaps you need to boot a like ubuntu cd and turn all swaps off and just have one equal to your ram. If it was me I would purge grub and reinstall it from the cli in the desktop.
2012-03-11T22:04:00.000Z	slothscripts	Fyodorovna	For removing swaps, is that reinstalling it, with custom partition this time instead?
2012-03-11T22:05:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	your question is two fold here removal is not installing. I would use the something other option which is a custom install in the ubuntu gui, that asks where you want the install.
2012-03-11T22:07:00.000Z	slothscripts	Fyodorovna	Okay! Thanks very much, I'll start to work with this and see where it gets me! Thanks for your help!
2012-03-11T22:07:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	you could reinstall, but your setup may be easily fixed especially since you can get to the ubuntu desktop.
2012-03-11T22:08:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	good luck, knowing some basic grub stuff is helpful if you dual booting, so you don't have to reinstall.
2012-03-11T22:08:00.000Z	slothscripts	Fyodorovna	The liveCD you are talking about, it is the same as the installation one correct? and you mean to say boot from it and fix it through the custom option there?
2012-03-11T22:10:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	there is alternative=no desktop text install. There is the live cd=desktop. You are mixing things up I'm not sure by what you mean by fixing it I gave you a remove the swaps option, and fixing grub, and instructions on a custom install to what are you referring
2012-03-11T22:12:00.000Z	slothscripts	Fyodorovna	Sorry for my ambiguity. Fixing grub, I will take the suggestion of purging it and reinstalling; in reference to the swaps, and fixing that, I am slightly lost as for that fix. That is what I was referring to.
2012-03-11T22:18:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	the purge and reinstall of grub can be done from the ubuntu desktop of the install if you can get in or a live cd, just make sure you know what your doing.
2012-03-11T22:19:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	slothscripts	the script did not look like you needed a purge I suspect more user error here really.]
