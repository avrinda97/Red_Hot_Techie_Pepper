2005-08-04T13:16:00.000Z	jasoncohen		i have smartmontools installed. how do i check to see if the drive is ok? i did smartctl -a /dev/hda
2005-08-04T13:17:00.000Z	jasoncohen		the information given by smartctl -a /dev/hda doesn't seem that helpful. what should i be looking for?

2005-08-04T13:19:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	it's blank
2005-08-04T13:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	Uh, really?  It's there for me...
2005-08-04T13:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	I just hit reload, and it's still there.
2005-08-04T13:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	Google smartctl and you'll find some nice other articles.
2005-08-04T13:19:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	nevermind- xchat didn't take the complete URL
2005-08-04T13:20:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	Ah, right.
2005-08-04T13:22:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	thanks, that was helpful
2005-08-04T13:22:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	but i do see a lot of errors
2005-08-04T13:22:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	Heh.
2005-08-04T13:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	no- i want to know why i've had my root fs fail on me twice in a few weeks. i reinstalled the first time (i didn't want / on an LVM anyways) and this time i did a manual fsck and fixed the partition after fixing many errors
2005-08-04T13:25:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	i booted into ubuntu about an hour ago and X wouldn't start. I couldn't cd to /etc/X11 because of an Input/Output Error. i was able to fix it by running fsck from the live-cd but i shouldn't have to do this every few weeks!
2005-08-04T13:26:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	Your memory may be bad.
2005-08-04T13:26:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	hmm, i'll run a memtest check tomorrow morning. thanks for the suggestion
2005-08-04T13:26:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	Your disk may also be bad, don't worry. ;)
2005-08-04T13:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	i still don't understand why it's only affecting ubuntu though. it didn't affect mandrake when I had it installed, and XP boots fine. Maybe i'm just lucky with XP
2005-08-04T13:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	did you get samba up & running?
2005-08-04T13:27:00.000Z	paulproteus	jasoncohen	Yes.
2005-08-04T10:16:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	it's in multiverse
2005-08-04T10:16:00.000Z	jasoncohen	paulproteus	and it requries transcode from hoary-extras to work
