2005-04-19T15:17:00.000Z	epicenter		Is there a good reason why a GLX app would refuse to run saying the GLX extension isn't enabled on the display when it's being loaded in xorg.conf? ... And when Tuxracer and  GL Screensavers run perfectly with acceleration? ...
2005-04-19T15:19:00.000Z	epicenter		jr: Know what would cause it? There's a line to load GLX in my config file and everything else is OK, I cna't explain it
2005-04-19T15:19:00.000Z	epicenter		I'm trying an SDL port of the app
2005-04-19T15:19:00.000Z	epicenter		but not holding out much hope for it
2005-04-19T15:21:00.000Z	epicenter		XLIB: Extension GLX missing on display 0:0
2005-04-19T15:21:00.000Z	epicenter		Keeps saying that
2005-04-19T15:22:00.000Z	epicenter		yet this doesn't :(
2005-04-19T15:23:00.000Z	epicenter		I compiled it with the proper xlibs and GLX libaries
2005-04-19T15:23:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	what is giving you that error?
2005-04-19T15:25:00.000Z	epicenter	chavo	Darkplaces, a GL based Quake engine replacement
2005-04-19T15:25:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	what video card?
2005-04-19T15:26:00.000Z	epicenter	chavo	ATI Radeon 9200 mobility.
2005-04-19T15:26:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	did you install the ati drivers after you compiled it?
2005-04-19T15:27:00.000Z	epicenter	chavo	No.
2005-04-19T15:30:00.000Z	epicenter	chavo	Do I need to compile the ATi drivers?
2005-04-19T15:30:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	no
2005-04-19T15:31:00.000Z	epicenter	chavo	what do you think I did wrong?
2005-04-19T15:31:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	I have no idea.
2005-04-23T11:29:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	ksysguard or hit ctrl-esc
2005-04-23T11:53:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	you need to edit your xorg.conf
2005-04-23T12:45:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	that doesn't always work either. Especially if your XP is ntfs
2005-04-23T12:46:00.000Z	chavo	epicenter	doesn't quake 3 have linux binaries?
