2011-10-30T11:53:00.000Z	Hemebond		Hmm, cheers dr_willis
2011-10-30T11:54:00.000Z	Hemebond		Like .xsession?
2011-10-30T11:55:00.000Z	Hemebond		What about .xinitrc?
2011-10-30T11:56:00.000Z	Hemebond		I'm not using Gnome.
2011-10-30T11:56:00.000Z	Hemebond		That's lame. I thought Linux had standardised this already.
2011-10-30T11:57:00.000Z	Hemebond		When I say "Linux" I meant the Linux community.
2011-10-30T11:58:00.000Z	Hemebond		I'll try using ~/.config/autostart/
2011-10-30T11:58:00.000Z	Hemebond		with bash scripts.
2011-10-30T11:58:00.000Z	Hemebond		Xubuntu.
2011-10-30T11:58:00.000Z	Hemebond		Xfce
2011-10-30T11:59:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	linux does have standards however, if you are using gnome/kde they have differen't ways of controlling startup.
2011-10-30T11:59:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	if you are using just plain X then I would use your .xinitrc to control which apps are run on X starting.
2011-10-30T12:00:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	What window manager or environment are you using?
2011-10-30T12:00:00.000Z	Hemebond	histo	Nah, I'm using LightDM, I'm just trying to make my profile as WM independent as possible.
2011-10-30T12:00:00.000Z	Hemebond	histo	For example, I've switched to xbindkeys for all my keyboard shortcuts.
2011-10-30T12:01:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	then I would go with .xinitrc since it gets called regardless of the environment. Stuff is starting to lean towards the .desktop files though now but it's not adopted accross the board.
2011-10-30T12:01:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	like openbox will use .desktop files etc...
2011-10-30T12:01:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	if you have xdg installed
2011-10-30T12:03:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	.xinitrc would be used to start the window manager of your choosing
2011-10-30T12:04:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	How are you invoking X with startx or are you using a login manager?
2011-10-30T12:04:00.000Z	Hemebond	histo	I'm using a login manager. It's Ubuntu 11.10 with xubuntu-desktop installed.
2011-10-30T12:05:00.000Z	histo	Hemebond	you'd have to read what xdm calls for it's session managment.
