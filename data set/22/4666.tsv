2008-01-18T22:31:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	what do you mean, are you installing?
2008-01-18T22:31:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	did you burn the iso as an image or data?
2008-01-18T22:32:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	what burning app did you use?
2008-01-18T22:33:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	ok, app means program, like nero or k3b
2008-01-18T22:34:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	so you used windows
2008-01-18T22:35:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	download this http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/ and use it to write the ISO
2008-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	go to tools at the top i think and go to write- iso / image
2008-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	can't quite remember the gui well. then go to "open" and grab your ubuntu iso, click burn and you're away
2008-01-18T22:47:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	wherever you downloaded it too originally
2008-01-18T22:48:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	wherever you downloaded it to originally
2008-01-18T22:48:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	well if you can't find it you check the recycle bin if not just download it again
2008-01-18T22:49:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	originally, where did you download it off?
2008-01-18T22:51:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	well the iso comes just as an iso with no folder, thats usually the name of the iso
2008-01-18T22:52:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	so it's an actual folder named that with nothing in it?
2008-01-18T22:54:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	hmm ok just download this http://releases.ubuntu.com/gutsy/ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso and burn it like i said
2008-01-18T22:55:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	that isnt a folder its an iso file, you just use that whole thing
2008-01-18T22:56:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	looks like you already have it, so burn that "folder" as you call it the way i said
2008-01-18T23:01:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	yes winrar is the default app at the moment, open up the app you just downloaded, and choose to write an iso, then choose "open" and find the file
2008-01-18T23:08:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	dont use winrar! use the program i told you to download, install it, then click "mode" at the top and go to "iso > write". then click on "source" and navigate to the iso file. select it and then click on the big burn button.
2008-01-18T23:15:00.000Z	rinaldi_	ironeye	no not usually, its good to load the cd and if the livecd works and sound works, you're on your way, if you encounter any problems this channel is always here
