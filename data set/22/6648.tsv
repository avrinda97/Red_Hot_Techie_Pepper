2006-09-01T05:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	i think anything with more than 255 characters has to go 16
2006-09-01T05:56:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	 sorry for the previous one
2006-09-01T05:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	np
2006-09-01T05:56:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	i was aiming for lgc_ ...
2006-09-01T05:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	i *think* the distinction is 2^8-1 vs 2^16-1
2006-09-01T05:58:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	maybe, anyway i believe 16 is not deployed as widely yet ...
2006-09-01T05:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	no, basically the online world start with english, and has been slow to support those folks, good bad or otherwise, it's just reality ... ubuntu intends to not-ignore them though, at least :)
2006-09-01T06:01:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	i'm not sure i can follow, anyway he should use utf if he can display the chars of his chosen langs with it (and not some iso-enconding)
2006-09-01T06:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	true
2006-09-01T06:24:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	.gnome2/session ?
2006-09-01T06:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	i would have guessed that dir, made a change, then grepped that dir to find the string i added to identify the file, heh
2006-09-01T06:53:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	lol
2006-09-01T06:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	at least someone recognized the reference
2006-09-05T15:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	isn't that backwards?
2006-09-05T15:46:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	not sure i follow ...
2006-09-05T15:47:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	umm sorry, i thought 6.06.1 was edgy ...
2006-09-05T15:47:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	but of *course* it isn't
2006-09-05T15:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	no, that's the bug fixed dapper with about 300 fixes on it
2006-09-05T15:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	nozorro	you're thinking "6.10" :)
2006-09-05T15:48:00.000Z	nozorro	eyequeue	yeah
