2011-12-20T03:51:00.000Z	anavarro		Hi guys.. I don't know why I have no tar application installed
2011-12-20T03:51:00.000Z	anavarro		Is there any way to reinstall tar?
2011-12-20T03:52:00.000Z	anavarro		All my updates are failing because of that
2011-12-20T03:54:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	I think the repositories for this version is simply no longer supported, it is not LTS>
2011-12-20T03:55:00.000Z	anavarro	paulsomebody	What am I going to do now?
2011-12-20T03:56:00.000Z	anavarro	paulsomebody	I don't want to reinstall ubuntu just because of that.
2011-12-20T03:57:00.000Z	anavarro	paulsomebody	There is no deb package or a bin to install tar?
2011-12-20T03:57:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	You can do as genii-around suggests, but using an unsupported release is a bad idea from my point of view. Why not to upgrade to 10.04? It is LTS, which means that you will get security updates and support until 2013.
2011-12-20T03:58:00.000Z	anavarro	paulsomebody	I have 11.04 already.
2011-12-20T03:58:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	Oh, sorry.
2011-12-20T03:59:00.000Z	anavarro	paulsomebody	I guess I did something terrible and I deleted the file or something like that.
2011-12-20T03:59:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	Can you simply install it back via synaptic?
2011-12-20T04:02:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	Well, what are you trying to do?
2011-12-20T04:02:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	Run in terminal 'sudo apt-get install tar', without quotes.
2011-12-20T04:04:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	Okay. Open the Software Center and the search for 'tar'.
2011-12-20T04:05:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	Be sure to click on 'Show technical items'.
2011-12-20T04:05:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	Since 'tar' is technical.
2011-12-20T04:05:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	And what you were trying to do when you received that error?
2011-12-20T04:06:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	WHAT exactly were you trying to do when you have got that error?
2011-12-20T04:07:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	I would more readily believe in 'path not executable', rather than in 'tar absent'.
2011-12-20T04:08:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	This situation is paradoxical. Since tar will be packed in the .deb, you will need it to install it.
2011-12-20T04:08:00.000Z	paulsomebody	anavarro	I suggest you get an Ubuntu Live CD, boot from it and repair it from there.
