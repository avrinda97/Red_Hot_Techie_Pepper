2011-05-18T20:31:00.000Z	Pici	KXTwo	On Ubuntu the default user who can use sudo is in the admin group.
2011-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	KXTwo		ok so what does it mean if getent group admin returns nothing?
2011-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	KXTwo		there has to be a super user/admin doesnt there?
2011-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	Pici	KXTwo	Is this on Ubuntu?
2011-05-18T21:05:00.000Z	KXTwo		its a unix based system
