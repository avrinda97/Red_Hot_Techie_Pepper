2007-08-30T09:32:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	thanks for the link, but my wi-fi card is not native, and mad wifi does not support my card.... I have to rebuild my kernel in order to include it
2007-08-30T09:32:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	ndiswrapper?
2007-08-30T09:33:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	not so much, I want to take advantage of the features of my card

2007-08-30T09:35:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	ok, i see... seems you're forced into the brilliant opportunity to build a mean and lean customized 2.6.22.5 Kernel for your box :-)
2007-08-30T09:35:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	exactly
2007-08-30T09:36:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	I'm running feisty with the 2.6.20 kernel
2007-08-30T09:36:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	which should work according to intel
2007-08-30T09:37:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	so now, in order to get everything my card offers, I have to do it that way
2007-08-30T09:37:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	any ideas?
2007-08-30T09:38:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild .... get a vanilla (2.6.22) kernel and patch it. i found the stock ubuntu kernels hard to use anyway, so i'm used to build my own kernels anyway
2007-08-30T09:38:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	I have NO clue what I'm doing in the sense of building custom kernel, will that be enough info for me?
2007-08-30T09:41:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	the steps are  easy to follow. The art lies in configuring your kernel right. Leaving out or choosing the wrong stuff will get you an unbootable kernel, or some hardware not working. But see it as a chance to learn. There's alway a 'first time' some time :-)
2007-08-30T09:42:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	that's helpful *rolling eyes"
2007-08-30T09:42:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	can we try it on your computer first? ;_)
2007-08-30T09:43:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	i already run my homemade 2.6.21... so the test is already passed :-)
2007-08-30T09:44:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	ok you write the how-to and post it ok?
2007-08-30T09:44:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	the howto is already at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild ... so no further excuses: Get started, man !
2007-08-30T09:46:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	^
2007-08-30T09:50:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	wait a second, sudo apt-get install build-essential fakeroot kpkg while you wait
2007-08-30T09:52:00.000Z	stefg	RandomUsr	better link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311158&highlight=master+kernel
2007-08-30T09:54:00.000Z	RandomUsr	stefg	thanks for all your help, looks like i have my work cut out for me
