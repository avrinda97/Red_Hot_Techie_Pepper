2005-12-07T16:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	ifconfig eth0 up fails
2005-12-07T16:27:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	I'd run the admin/network dialog and see if the thing is recognized, as a first step, I think.
2005-12-07T16:28:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	although of course dmesg will tell you that if you know how to read it, but I'm not sure lig does.
2005-12-07T16:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	insmod tulip fails too...
2005-12-07T16:28:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	that's odd.  Using a stock kernel?
2005-12-07T16:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	and there no mention of tulip in dmesg neither - bad
2005-12-07T16:28:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	if it never sees the card, then yes, that's bad news.
2005-12-07T16:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	good question - reign - this breezy stock kernel?
2005-12-07T16:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	on big disks, the 5% overhead is a bit much
2005-12-07T16:29:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	dangerous to reduce it.
2005-12-07T16:30:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	if metadata operations run out of space seriously nasty things will happen.
2005-12-07T16:30:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	I think so, yes.  For one thing the space needed by a full fsck is proportional to the size of the partition.
2005-12-07T16:30:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	but how big are these ops, not 10GB at a time, surely?
2005-12-07T16:31:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	that's hard to answer as it depends on the actual state of the file system.  But if you have 190 gigs of data, 10 gigs of scratch for an fsck is certainly not obviously too large
2005-12-07T16:32:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	Certainly, I would never reduce it unless for some odd reason I absolutely positively have to have that space and can't clean anything old out.
2005-12-07T16:33:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	iirc the manpage for tunefs mentions that 5% might be overkill for large file systems
2005-12-07T16:33:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	might.  Might means might not.
2005-12-07T16:33:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	and unless you are at 100% full, why reduce it?
2005-12-07T16:40:00.000Z	frogzoo	sethk	bob_4_a_day I think the point is that most of the time, you want need that 4%, so why free it up anyway?
2005-12-07T16:42:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	once it is 95% full, not once it reports 95% full.  :)
2005-12-18T09:05:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	it's free if you have a gun and a ski mask
2005-12-27T09:24:00.000Z	sethk	frogzoo	don't tell me, I'm not installing java
