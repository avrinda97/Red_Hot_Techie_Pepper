2007-07-10T06:23:00.000Z	honke		Hi everyone good morning
2007-07-10T06:24:00.000Z	honke		I have a question and I want to know if this is possible.
2007-07-10T06:25:00.000Z	honke		I have an IBM M-pro with dual 1.7 xeons, 4 double gigabit ethernet cards and an 800GB disk array on SCSI.  I just put feisty server with LAMP and DNS on it
2007-07-10T06:25:00.000Z	honke		I want this machine to do all this: DNS, firewall, fileserver, Counterstrike server, SMB... is it possible?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	honke		balieue: I just followed the instructions word for word and it worked lol
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	honke		thank you kslater
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	honke		I should ask a more direct question.... Where can I go to learn about implementing a firewall in this box? Is the firewall something I should learn before I try to learn about turning the box into a router?
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	honke		It has 5 ethernet ports
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	honke		I want it to be the hub to my home network, and also server files.
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	honke		(64 bit 1Gbit dual cards, so good and fast!)
2007-07-10T06:29:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	honke	maybe this will help about CS server http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=76483
2007-07-10T06:29:00.000Z	honke	caseofthemondays	I want to do it through linux because I will get higher throughput and I will learn a great deal about networking
2007-07-10T06:30:00.000Z	honke		besides I have fiber equipment I can try too
2007-07-10T06:30:00.000Z	honke		but but but all the computers in this room have PCI-X or 64bit PCI gig cards, it should be damn fast
2007-07-10T06:31:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D		Print Screen
2007-07-10T06:31:00.000Z	honke		thank you very much for the step in the right direction
2007-07-10T06:33:00.000Z	honke		For a third question... Should I try to make my box be the router before learning about firewalls?
2007-07-10T06:33:00.000Z	honke		ah, thats what the guys at OSDL told me too
2007-07-10T06:34:00.000Z	honke		Allright then I will read up on IPtables and packet filtering...
2007-07-10T06:35:00.000Z	honke		You guys would kill me if you knew how little I paid for all these servers
2007-07-10T06:35:00.000Z	honke		dual hyperthreading xeons with 2GB for $50 each
2007-07-10T06:36:00.000Z	Judg3_Dr34D	honke	that's a killer deal
