2008-05-15T18:27:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 Sounds like all you need to do is restore the MBR so that it runs Grub.  This is a common problem when installing Windows after you have linux installed.
2008-05-15T18:27:00.000Z	Radit	bridean	can you please tell me how to do that?
2008-05-15T18:28:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 Run Ubuntu as a live CD, go into repair mode then run grub-install as root is how I normally do it.

2008-05-15T18:29:00.000Z	Radit	bridean	bazhang, adam, thanks..
2008-05-15T18:30:00.000Z	bridean		Adam7:  Monocrome doesn't do anything other than change the font used if I run a terminal
2008-05-15T18:32:00.000Z	Radit		Hi, i've read: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows to recover from installing windows, but is there an easier way?
2008-05-15T18:33:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 Did you try reinstalling grub in the MBR?
2008-05-15T18:33:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 I'm serious, that might really be your only problem.  It only takes a few minutes to do.
2008-05-15T18:33:00.000Z	Radit	bridean	how do you do that?
2008-05-15T18:35:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 Easier than that web site is to just simply run the command "grub-install" instead of "grub".  Without the quotes of course.
2008-05-15T18:37:00.000Z	Radit	bridean	grub-install?
2008-05-15T18:37:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 Just get to a command line and type in sudo grub-install
2008-05-15T18:37:00.000Z	Radit		so i boot the ubuntu cd then?
2008-05-15T18:37:00.000Z	bridean		Adam7:  Sorry, was distracted there.  Is this where I want to be?   [URL=http://img394.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot1zw4.png][IMG]http://img394.imageshack.us/img394/8741/screenshot1zw4.th.png[/IMG][/URL]
2008-05-15T18:38:00.000Z	Radit	bridean	so, i boot the ubuntu cd, then?
2008-05-15T18:38:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 Yes, you will have to boot Ubuntu from the CD
2008-05-15T18:39:00.000Z	bridean	Radit	 Don't install, just get it to run a terminal
2008-05-15T18:39:00.000Z	bridean		Adam7:  Over to the right side of the screen
2008-05-15T18:40:00.000Z	Radit	bridean	use ubuntu live, goto terminal, then type sudo grub-install; is that correct?
2008-05-15T18:41:00.000Z	bridean		Radix:  Pretty much.  You might have to try something like sudo grub-install /dev/hda or something like that.  But that's the basic idea
2008-05-15T18:42:00.000Z	Radit	bridean	ok, thanks :-)
