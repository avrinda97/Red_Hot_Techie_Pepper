2010-03-22T22:59:00.000Z	progre55		hi people! a friend of mine has installed open-suse after ubuntu as a dual-boot, but it has fcked up his grub-menu now. is it possible to repair the ubuntu grub from a live-cd?
2010-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	it can be done, I don't think you need the live cd, unless you can't boot either OS, anyway, I will give you a hint, edit the grub.menu file or something like that, and then run grub-update or somthing like that
2010-03-22T23:01:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	thanks, will try that now
2010-03-22T23:01:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	there is no grub-update. mb grub-setup?
2010-03-22T23:01:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	I never did it lately, otherwise I would give you the precise file names, but you ls /boot and see the new names
2010-03-22T23:04:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	well, neither of the OS is booting, so if I use the live-CD, would I have to mount the disc first?
2010-03-22T23:05:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	when you boot the live cd, it will mount it, Do not umount it
2010-03-22T23:05:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	I mean, the hd partition where my ubuntu is installed
2010-03-22T23:05:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	oh okay, thanks
2010-03-22T23:06:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	yeah, you will probably have to mount boot, to edit that boot.menu file, find someone else or google for the exact file names.  let me check one sec
2010-03-22T23:07:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	if you type grub and hit tab, you will see lots of apps
2010-03-22T23:07:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	yeah I can see them, and I think grub-setup is the one, right?
2010-03-22T23:08:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	yeah, but better google instructions first
2010-03-22T23:08:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	oki, thanks
2010-03-22T23:08:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	I can't find the file, menu.lst, that is the one you wanna edit, and include both the suse and ubuntu kernels
2010-03-22T23:09:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	yeah, karmic doesnot have that..
2010-03-22T23:10:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	well let me know how you did it when you are done if you feel like it.  I am trying to run two webcams at once
2010-03-22T23:11:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	sure I will, thanks for all the support man, appreciate
2010-03-22T23:24:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	I got it working, just followed this guide here :) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2010-03-22T23:25:00.000Z	tp43__	progre55	that was fast, well done
2010-03-22T23:33:00.000Z	progre55	tp43__	thanks a lot for the help and attention =)
