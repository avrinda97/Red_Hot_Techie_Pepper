2010-12-22T13:51:00.000Z	rs0832	shazbotmcnasty	it is not the same problem, but it tells you how to add the option
2010-12-22T14:24:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	rs0832	the screen that asks you if you want to try it or install it, is no longer the same
2010-12-22T14:25:00.000Z	rs0832	shazbotmcnasty	oh?
2010-12-22T14:26:00.000Z	rs0832	shazbotmcnasty	ok, and?

2010-12-22T14:27:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	rs0832	the website that told me how to add the 'nomodeset' thingy won't wurk
2010-12-22T14:28:00.000Z	rs0832	shazbotmcnasty	what exactly is the problem?
2010-12-22T14:29:00.000Z	rs0832	shazbotmcnasty	ok, did you get my first message about it?
