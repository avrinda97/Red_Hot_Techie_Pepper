2012-03-19T22:55:00.000Z	foxtrot9		I need some help on getting the 3rd monitor eyefinity using fglrx drivers, I can't seem to get the 3rd monitor to work, the amd catalyst says disabled. I tried editing the xorg.conf, with no avail. Anyone have an idea how to get the 3rd monitor to work?
2012-03-19T22:56:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	do you have viewport?
2012-03-19T22:56:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	what do you mean by viewport?
2012-03-19T22:57:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	how many graphic cards you have?
2012-03-19T22:57:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	just 1 with 3 monitors attached, hd5850
2012-03-19T22:58:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	if you have only one then you need viewport
2012-03-19T22:59:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	how do i get viewport?
2012-03-19T22:59:00.000Z	arunce		you can't have three monitors through dvi/hdmi/vga
2012-03-19T22:59:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	this is 2x DVI and 1x DisplayPort
2012-03-19T22:59:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	works in windows
2012-03-19T23:00:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	sorry, its displayport. not viewport
2012-03-19T23:00:00.000Z	arunce		my mistake
2012-03-19T23:02:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	i just can't get catalyst to see it, even though eyefinity works on windows
2012-03-19T23:03:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	do you have that options on ati control panel?
2012-03-19T23:03:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	yes
2012-03-19T23:04:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	it says 3rd monitor disabled
2012-03-19T23:04:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	I had that problem some months ago
2012-03-19T23:05:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	let me check
2012-03-19T23:15:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	try this - 1. backup your xorg.conf file; 2. sudo aticonfig --initial; 3. restart x
2012-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	already did that
2012-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	arunce	foxtrot9	I did that sometime ago, but now i'm back on two identical screens due to tear.
2012-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	foxtrot9	arunce	my 3rd screen still isn't detected
