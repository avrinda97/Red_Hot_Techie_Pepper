2012-11-13T04:03:00.000Z	guliy3v		how can I extract lzm compressed archives?
2012-11-13T04:04:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	Do you mean "lzma"?
2012-11-13T04:04:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	nah. lzm
2012-11-13T04:05:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	Could you pastebin the output if "file yourfile.lzm"?
2012-11-13T04:06:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	actually i compressed as lzma in linux, but my bsd converted it to lzm, i googled though, still confusing
2012-11-13T04:06:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	Then it is lzma compressed, still.
2012-11-13T04:07:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	And currently you are trying to uncompress it on BSD?
2012-11-13T04:08:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	no, im on Ubuntu 12.04.1
2012-11-13T04:09:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	Then use one of the lzma utilities to uncompress it.
2012-11-13T04:11:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	since it should be recognized by ubuntu as a lzma compression, it could be available to extract from right-click directly, but it seems not to support, unrecognized?
2012-11-13T04:11:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	That "recognition" is based on the file name extension.
2012-11-13T04:11:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	So just uncompress it using one of the lzma utilities.
2012-11-13T04:15:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	You dont need the squash tools to uncompress a lzma archive.
2012-11-13T04:15:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	man, you have never tried it, did you?
2012-11-13T04:16:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	I am using lzma for years now. http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=lzma&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
2012-11-13T04:16:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	what about lzm itself?
2012-11-13T04:16:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	Whats the output of "file yourfile.lzm" then?
2012-11-13T04:18:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	Whats the output of "file yourfile.lzm" then?
2012-11-13T04:18:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	sorry, which output?
2012-11-13T04:18:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	For the fourth time: "file yourfile.lzm"
2012-11-13T04:19:00.000Z	guliy3v	bekks	im afraid i have no idea what you're talking about
2012-11-13T04:19:00.000Z	bekks	guliy3v	"file" is a command, avail in BSD too, which shows basic information of a file's content.
