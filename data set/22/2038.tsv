2009-10-21T22:33:00.000Z	mMezquitale		anyone knows if ubuntu plays well with nvidia video cards that are rated for PCI Express 2.0 slot but are used in PCI Express x16 slot?
2009-10-21T22:34:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	that is related to the motherboard, not to ubuntu
2009-10-21T22:35:00.000Z	mMezquitale	iceroot	i know the hardware works but will ubuntu have any issues though, that is what I am asking, I can stick a PCI Express 2.0 video card in a PCI Express x16 slot, no issue there but will the OS have any issues???
2009-10-21T22:36:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	why should the os have an issue with that? if the hardware and connection is ok, ubunu does not care about it
2009-10-21T22:36:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	its more important that the drivers support the card
2009-10-21T22:36:00.000Z	mMezquitale	iceroot	you must be new at this then, people have had issues with something as basic as memory
2009-10-21T22:36:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	memory-problems are hardware/motherboard problems, not ubuntu problems
2009-10-21T22:36:00.000Z	mMezquitale	iceroot	drivers are not implemented in hardware
2009-10-21T22:37:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	.......
2009-10-21T22:37:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	i mean the nvidia-linux-driver must support the card
2009-10-21T22:37:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	if the card is to new maybe there is no linux-driver for it
2009-10-21T22:38:00.000Z	mMezquitale	iceroot	ok before I decide which one to buy I will look up the list for supported hardward,t hanks
2009-10-21T22:39:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	yes, that is a good idea, the rest (pci x16, pci 2.0) is not part of ubuntu but of your board/the card
2009-11-04T23:24:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	jaunty is working fine
2009-11-04T23:26:00.000Z	mMezquitale	iceroot	not on my desktop and on my laptop karmic is a whole lot better than jaunty, karmic doesnt crash, jaunty crashed my desktop all the time and it crashed my laptop every now and then
2009-11-04T23:26:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	but you are not all jaunty-users
2009-11-04T23:27:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	so please dont tell anyone jaunty is not working
2009-12-29T05:38:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	rm removes it permanetly (if there are no hardlinks anymore)
2009-12-29T05:39:00.000Z	mMezquitale	iceroot	true but using forensic utilities you may still be able to look at the data, i thought rm mainly sets the disk space as writable again, not securely erase, as in wipe or shred
2009-12-29T05:40:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	rm is not deleting
2009-12-29T05:40:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	m is only removing the hard-link node
2009-12-29T05:40:00.000Z	iceroot	mMezquitale	unlink is removing the file if i am correct which is called after hardlinks =0
