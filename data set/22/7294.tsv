2006-11-26T12:03:00.000Z	we2by		some how gnome is not saving its settings
2006-11-26T12:03:00.000Z	we2by		any idea?>
2006-11-26T12:05:00.000Z	we2by		omg, I just accidently ran sudo chown -R jinxi:jinxi /.*
2006-11-26T12:05:00.000Z	we2by		what do I do to undo the permission change?
2006-11-26T12:06:00.000Z	we2by		sudo: must be setuid root
2006-11-26T12:07:00.000Z	we2by		shit
2006-11-26T12:07:00.000Z	Lynoure	we2by	recovery boot in
2006-11-26T12:07:00.000Z	we2by		I can fix it with single mode boot
2006-11-26T12:07:00.000Z	we2by		but I want to fix it without rebooting
2006-11-26T12:07:00.000Z	we2by		hehe
2006-11-26T12:08:00.000Z	Lynoure	we2by	why? A bit hard if you messed it so that you cannot sudo.
2006-11-26T12:08:00.000Z	we2by		the permissions are all screwed up
2006-11-26T12:09:00.000Z	we2by		what the heck, I'm gonna reinstall it tomorow then
2006-11-26T12:09:00.000Z	Lynoure	we2by	yes, but why do you need to fix it without booting?
2006-11-26T12:09:00.000Z	Lynoure	we2by	you do not probably need to reinstall
2006-11-26T12:09:00.000Z	we2by		there is more than sudo
2006-11-26T12:10:00.000Z	we2by		my biggest mistake ever
2006-11-26T12:10:00.000Z	we2by		lol
2006-11-26T12:11:00.000Z	Lynoure	we2by	I'd fix it with a livecd and some shell scripting, it might even turn out to be fun to fix.
2006-11-26T12:12:00.000Z	we2by	Lynoure	but I dunno what files are set to suid
2006-11-26T12:14:00.000Z	Lynoure	we2by	you do not even need to, as long as you know which got changed and that you can find out in many different ways. But anyway, I guess reinstall will not hurt you too much
2006-11-26T12:14:00.000Z	we2by	Lynoure	i think reinstall is the fastest solution
