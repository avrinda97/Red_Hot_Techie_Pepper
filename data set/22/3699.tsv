2008-06-23T23:59:00.000Z	som12w4		someone got 5 minutes of their time to help me configure my ubuntu so i can compile some drivers?
2008-06-23T23:59:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	install build-essential and the kernel headers for your running kernel. then you are good to go
2008-06-24T00:00:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	what is the error?
2008-06-24T00:01:00.000Z	som12w4	wols_	source build tree is missing something
2008-06-24T00:01:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	how old are these drivers?
2008-06-24T00:03:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	exact error
2008-06-24T00:03:00.000Z	som12w4	wols_	kernel tree is missing autoconfig.h
2008-06-24T00:03:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	dpkg -l |grep kernel-header
2008-06-24T00:05:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	pastebin the full output of your make run please
2008-06-24T00:07:00.000Z	som12w4	wols_	cc1: error: /usr/src/kernel-headers-2.6.24-16-server/include/linux/config.h: no such file or directory
2008-06-24T00:07:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	lemme guess: it's for asterisk?
2008-06-24T00:07:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	that is NOT autoconfig.h! be precise!  and you are missing kernel headers
2008-06-24T00:08:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	I asked you for the dpkg output before and you didn't show. show it NOW
2008-06-24T00:08:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	come back if you can do what is asked of you. goodbye
2008-06-24T00:10:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	a brain
2008-06-24T00:10:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	your error message clearly shows you are wrong btw
2008-06-24T00:10:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	run configure and pastebin its FULL output
2008-06-24T00:12:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	you start by doing what joaopinto asked of you. otherwise you cannot get any help
2008-06-24T00:21:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	then pastebin the FULL "make install" output
2008-06-24T00:21:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	also the output of: dpkg -l kernel |grep kernel
2008-06-24T00:23:00.000Z	som12w4	wols_	kernel-package, linux-headers, linux-source
2008-06-24T00:23:00.000Z	wols_	som12w4	I want the FULL exact output. what you just said is useless. use a pastebin
