2012-03-18T19:16:00.000Z	guy_		hi all, i'm having an issue with grub2: it's not modifying my boot list. i think it may have to do with starting out on lmde and then adding ubuntu afterwards?
2012-03-18T19:17:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	make sure the os-prober is installed
2012-03-18T19:17:00.000Z	guy_		thanks Fyodorovna i'll check that now
2012-03-18T19:18:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	in the terminal sudo apt-get install os-prober
2012-03-18T19:18:00.000Z	guy_		thanks Fyodorovna it's already installed
2012-03-18T19:19:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	so do you have more then one OS on the computer?
2012-03-18T19:19:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	yes, originally it was dual-boot with linux mint debian edition and doze. then i added ubuntu as well
2012-03-18T19:20:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	ubuuntu was installed last?
2012-03-18T19:20:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	yes
2012-03-18T19:21:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	somehow all of the right kernel entries show up in the grub.cfg file but not in the list at boot
2012-03-18T19:21:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	what is missing in the boot menu?
2012-03-18T19:22:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	the new ubuntu kernels
2012-03-18T19:22:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	everything shows up properly in grub customizer as well
2012-03-18T19:22:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	did yoiu install those or did it come in a update upgrade
2012-03-18T19:23:00.000Z	Fyodorovna		you*
2012-03-18T19:23:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	came in the update upgrade
2012-03-18T19:23:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	so is ubuntu or debian controlling the boot?
2012-03-18T19:24:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	3.0-15 and 16 are installed but 12 is the last showing. i thought ubuntu was but i'm assuming it must be debian. how to check?
2012-03-18T19:25:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	sorry it's been so long since i put debian on, i'm foggy on the details of that install. probably that bootloader is on the mbr and ubuntu is on the partition?
2012-03-18T19:25:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	guy_	the last install is generally the controlling boot unless it did not load the mbr. Have you run a uopdate-grub in debian, if it is running grub3 you need to run it there.
2012-03-18T19:26:00.000Z	Fyodorovna		grub 2*
2012-03-18T19:26:00.000Z	guy_	Fyodorovna	ah ok, i'll just boot into debian again for that. i ran it on ubuntu, but should've thought of that. will try it now. many thanks!
