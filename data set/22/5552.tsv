2007-04-15T15:54:00.000Z	Nubbie		pierre1: you need 3 partitions.
2007-04-15T15:55:00.000Z	Nubbie		pierre1: you can use the livecd to parition your drives to make room for linux.
2007-04-15T15:56:00.000Z	Nubbie		pierre1: once you have room, in the ubuntu installer, create 3 partitions in the empty space, one for base system (~4-5GB) one for swap (=to your ram) and one for your personal data (everything else)

2007-04-15T15:57:00.000Z	Nubbie		pierre1: why don't you read an installation walkthrough before starting?
