2007-05-13T14:36:00.000Z	gif89apro		uh, am I missing something?  what is the default root password?  i just did fresh install... never asked me to set a root password..
2007-05-13T14:37:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	you have to set a root password, you can do that with 'sudo passwd' or something like that.. maybe sudo passwd root
2007-05-13T14:39:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	sudo passwd root worked perfectly, thanks
2007-05-13T14:51:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	have you tried system -> administration -> restricted drivers manager?
2007-05-13T14:51:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	not yet... will try now
2007-05-13T14:52:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	wow, you were right, that was painless
2007-05-13T15:06:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	 in terminal, write "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and add the resolution you need near the bottom
2007-05-13T15:08:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	im' pretty sure that the dirver in the restricted manager are the same ones as from the nvidia page
2007-05-13T15:10:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	that's exactly what i want
2007-05-13T15:11:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	did you look in the xorg.conf?
2007-05-13T15:11:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	yes... where exactly should i have added it?  in the "display" section?
2007-05-13T15:11:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	yes, ad it among all the other resolutions
2007-05-13T15:15:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	ok, once i edit the xorg.conf... where should i see the new res show up?
2007-05-13T15:16:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	when X reads the config file again ^_^ (restart X)
2007-05-13T15:16:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	how to do that?
2007-05-13T15:17:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	ctrl+alt+backspace i think (which also logs you out)
2007-05-13T15:19:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	definitely logged me off... but no new res in options :(
2007-05-13T15:20:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	maybe it takes more than that.. care to try a reboot?
2007-05-13T15:26:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	how about now?
2007-05-13T15:27:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	you could try the system -> preferences -> desktop effects
2007-05-13T15:28:00.000Z	nichlas	gif89apro	beryl is just more of the same, with greater control
2007-05-13T15:28:00.000Z	gif89apro	nichlas	cool, thx.. i'll check it out
