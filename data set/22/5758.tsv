2007-04-28T09:19:00.000Z	LordLimecat		hey, can anyone really quickly give me the mount command for mounting ntfs?  i dont have access to a web browser ATM, and need the opts
2007-04-28T09:19:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	mount -t ntfs /dev/your_drive /folder/location
2007-04-28T09:19:00.000Z	LordLimecat	rukuartic	arent there opts needed for non sudo access?
2007-04-28T09:20:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	Hmm... You got me there :( I just know that does it :P
2007-04-28T09:20:00.000Z	LordLimecat	rukuartic	i knew that part, but whenever i did it with the -opts utf8,XXXXXX (dont know the last part) it doesnt allow read/write, or non-sudo
2007-04-28T09:20:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	Oh hold on, let me get it from my /etc/fstab
2007-04-28T09:21:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46
2007-04-28T09:21:00.000Z	LordLimecat	rukuartic	thats it--its umask=777 :D
2007-04-28T09:21:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	I think umask is for creating files...
2007-04-28T09:22:00.000Z	LordLimecat	rukuartic	is it -opts defaul,nls=utf8..... or no -opts
2007-04-28T09:22:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	Hold on a sec... "man mount"
2007-04-28T09:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	mount -t ntfs -o defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 /dev/blah /place
2007-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	You want it exactly like that
2007-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	gid=46 means its part of plugdev
2007-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	You should be part of plugdev, which gives you read/write access
2007-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	umask pertains to files being created, and is not intuitive at all, not quite the same as chmod.
2007-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	LordLimecat	rukuartic	er....whats command for group changes
2007-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	if you want to be part of plugdev
2007-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	sudo adduser username plugdev
2007-04-28T09:27:00.000Z	LordLimecat	rukuartic	is by default :)  feisty is so....intuitive :D
2007-04-28T09:35:00.000Z	LordLimecat	rukuartic	ntfs rw support is SUPPOSED to be built into feisty, right?
2007-04-28T09:35:00.000Z	rukuartic	LordLimecat	I have no idea... NTFS support is terrible from what I understand...
