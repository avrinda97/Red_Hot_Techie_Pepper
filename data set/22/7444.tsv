2006-06-05T13:32:00.000Z	msid		my system gets stuck on boot when it saying mounting the root filesystem and it does not do anything for 10'. any ideas how to solve this thing ?
2006-06-05T13:33:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	make the root partition about 3g  rather than 200g  in size ?
2006-06-05T13:34:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	what kind of answer is this? i cannot even boot on my system and i have data on it. and it is auto partitioned the way the installer did it.
2006-06-05T13:34:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	you can not boot ?
2006-06-05T13:35:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	no
2006-06-05T13:35:00.000Z	intelikey		what did you upgrade that cause the inabilty to boot msid ?
2006-06-05T13:36:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	i just did a fresh installation. and it doesn't work
2006-06-05T13:38:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	the you don't have data on the root system in the sense of valuable files that need to be saved.    you did a fresh install and it wont boot.   reinstall it.  and use expert mode.
2006-06-05T13:38:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	i have data, it worked until i rebooted it for the first time
2006-06-05T13:39:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	then again i ask what you changed (between the time it booted correctly and the time it failed to boot)  ?
2006-06-05T13:40:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	if a system boots one time and the next time it doesn't,  something changed.
2006-06-05T13:40:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	yes, data got on the hard drive. isn't that unusual now ?
2006-06-05T13:41:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	what data ?
2006-06-05T13:41:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	MY data
2006-06-05T13:41:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	a file called vmlinux perhaps ?
2006-06-05T13:42:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	word documents, mp3, videos
2006-06-05T13:42:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	none of the will affect the system.    what else did you change ?
2006-06-05T13:43:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	i am not in the mood to play with words man. i say it for the last time, NOTHING
2006-06-05T13:43:00.000Z	intelikey		then it will still boot.
2006-06-05T13:43:00.000Z	msid	intelikey	it doesn't
2006-06-05T13:45:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	i'm in no mood to play either.  you havent described any problem you just said "it will not boot... after i rebooted"   thus it did boot.  but now doesn't  unless you can give us some error message to work with, or remember what you changed that might have caused it.  i can not help.
2006-06-05T13:47:00.000Z	intelikey	msid	there are only two things that cause a system to "stop" booting.  software change  or hardware failure.
