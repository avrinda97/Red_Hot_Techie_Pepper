2010-02-01T14:34:00.000Z	brand0n		i installed this script from gnome-look.org avconvert its pretty neat
2010-02-01T14:34:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	yes for the task it completes i use it
2010-02-01T14:35:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	they have lots of cool ones online even some for flash --> mp3 (quality not awesome)
2010-02-01T14:38:00.000Z	brand0n	SolarisBoy	i just converted a file into a DVD MPEG or whatever with ffmpeg, how would i burn that into a dvd that can be read in a dvd player?
2010-02-01T14:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	one sec ill let you know the steps i have them notated,, think i actually have a link,, theres a few approaches,,,
2010-02-01T15:10:00.000Z	brand0n	SolarisBoy	how do you use any2dvd? like what would be an example of the command id use
2010-02-01T15:11:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	depends on what the defaults are,,
2010-02-01T15:11:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	for some reason i think it assumes your starting with avi...
2010-02-01T15:16:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	you can alternatively use tovidgui
2010-02-01T15:28:00.000Z	brand0n	SolarisBoy	is there a way to make isos with tovid
2010-02-01T15:29:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	i think tovid has that option.. its simply a collection of other tools used to accomplish the task of file to vid
2010-02-01T15:34:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	=) anytime
2010-02-01T15:34:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	brand0n	i think actually its something simlar to that like --no-menu maybe?
