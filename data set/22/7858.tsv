2007-09-24T10:48:00.000Z	guru		the solution was to install php5-mcrypt. this package needs to be included in the dependancy information for the phpmyadmin package
2007-09-24T10:48:00.000Z	macd	guru	its an upstream package so,  Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>
2007-09-24T10:49:00.000Z	macd	guru	php5-mcrypt is a dependancy
2007-09-24T10:49:00.000Z	macd	guru	http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/web/phpmyadmin I take that back its recommended
