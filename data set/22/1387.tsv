2010-06-04T18:48:00.000Z	ociredeF		I am getting nuts with  trying to burn an iso
2010-06-04T18:48:00.000Z	ociredeF		I've already ruined 3 dvds
2010-06-04T18:50:00.000Z	ociredeF		this is the troubleshoot "cdrecord has no permission to open the device"

2010-06-04T18:49:00.000Z	ociredeF	erUSUL	I am trying with K3b
2010-06-04T18:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	ociredeF	are you in the cdrom group ?
2010-06-04T18:51:00.000Z	ociredeF	erUSUL	how do I check?

2010-06-04T18:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	ociredeF	so why does cdrecord complains ? can you post the exact cdrecord command you used ?
2010-06-04T18:55:00.000Z	ociredeF	erUSUL	I am doing it with K3b
2010-06-04T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	ociredeF	i see... kubuntu user?
2010-06-04T18:56:00.000Z	ociredeF	erUSUL	I did Show Debugging Output and at the end I had this lines
2010-06-04T18:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	ociredeF	right click on the iso and choosing burn to disk does not work ? maybe is a k3b problem
2010-06-04T18:57:00.000Z	ociredeF	erUSUL	I don' have that option
2010-06-04T18:58:00.000Z	ociredeF	erUSUL	I have write to disk or Open with Brasero

2010-06-04T19:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	ociredeF	try with --> « wodim -v -dummy dev=/dev/sr0 speed=8 -sao driveropts=burnfree iso_image.iso » with the dummy option it only simulates the writte ... hopefully no bricked cd this time... paste the output you get
