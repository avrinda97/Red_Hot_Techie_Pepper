2005-09-27T09:06:00.000Z	Ankka		I need some help: I can't get ubuntu connected to the internet
2005-09-27T09:06:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	what kind of connection do you want to use?
2005-09-27T09:07:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	ethernet
2005-09-27T09:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	click on system administration networking and you should be able to do it from there
2005-09-27T09:09:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	the problem is that ubuntu claims it has the ethernet card configured and connected, yet when I try to even ping the router I have it doesn't get ponged back
2005-09-27T09:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	there is no machine between you and the firewall?
2005-09-27T09:11:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	nope, only an ethernet cable
2005-09-27T09:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	is there another machine on the network?
2005-09-27T09:11:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	yes, this iBook I'm using now
2005-09-27T09:12:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	and when I try to connect somewhere with ubuntu, even this machine's net connection freezes
2005-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	I suggest that the router is not configured to give more than one IP seems like that
2005-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	turn off the ibook - and reboot ubuntu see if gets network
2005-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	hmm, thanks for the tip
2005-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	unless you are comfortable with terminals
2005-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	well, not comfortable - yet
2005-09-27T09:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	if the router is only putting up one internal ip for use then you would typically see what you are seeing, if that is thae case it is a matter of logging into the router and allowing it to give out more ips
2005-09-27T09:22:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	nope, that was not the case
2005-09-27T09:22:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	and I remembered just that win98 works fine with the router
2005-09-27T09:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	at the same time as the mac?
2005-09-27T09:23:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	yes
2005-09-27T09:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Ankka	let us first check the cable plug it into the mac - it should just work
2005-09-27T09:27:00.000Z	Ankka	ompaul	yes the cable is working
