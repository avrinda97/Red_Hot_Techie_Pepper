2007-05-05T10:59:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	did you alter anything in your "Removable Drives and Media Preferences"?
2007-05-05T10:59:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	nope...  :-/
2007-05-05T11:01:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	 that device is detected.  it shows up on lsusb.  if i unplug it, it goes away
2007-05-05T11:03:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	curiouser and curiouser.  check your "removable drives..." preferences, just to make sure.
2007-05-05T11:04:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	 mount removable drives is checked
2007-05-05T11:06:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	df to see if it has a device name.
2007-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	i just ripped the dvd drive out of the external case... lol.   it looks like it has normal ata / power connectors.  maybe will work as internal?  :-)
2007-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	whoah.  well.  no harm in trying.  ;)
2007-05-05T11:41:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	 guess what works perfectly as an internal dvd drive... lol
2007-05-05T11:42:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	sweet!  hope you didn't pay too much extra for it.  :D
2007-05-05T11:42:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	freebee.... hand me  down
2007-05-05T11:42:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	awesome.
2007-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	now that i have a working dvd drive - anything special i have to do in order to have dvd playback?  i already did the install libdvdread3
2007-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	install mplayer?  :)
2007-05-05T11:56:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	 i thought vlc would handle it
2007-05-05T11:56:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	either/or.  vlc is good too.
2007-05-05T11:56:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	 vlc just bombs when i try  :(
2007-05-05T11:57:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	launch vlc from a terminal so you'll see what errors come up.
2007-05-05T12:00:00.000Z	vanberge	thebillywayne	 i removed /home/user/.vlc dir ,and works now
2007-05-05T12:01:00.000Z	thebillywayne	vanberge	oh.  cool.  maybe I should try that (I've been having problems with dvd playback).
