2010-05-23T12:28:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	do you know that PA is ALSA improved, right?
2010-05-23T12:28:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	so you'll likely have more issues with ALSA than with PA
2010-05-23T12:31:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	hmmm... why don't you search on the internet for the error message PA gives you?
2010-05-23T12:31:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	i'm sure it's more or less common
2010-05-23T12:33:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	no because i don't really know why does that happen
2010-05-23T12:34:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	please use Google, i'm sure you'll find your answer
2010-05-23T12:35:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	ill try to help you then but im totally clueless, what brand and model is your card?
2010-05-23T12:37:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	have you tried to contact Creative about Linux and drivers?
2010-05-23T12:37:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	and your specific issue
2010-05-23T12:38:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	as far as i know, Creative offers high quality, open source drivers for Linux, except the X-fi series
2010-05-23T12:39:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	Google "creative audio drivers linux"
2010-05-23T12:41:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	yeah, maybe some particular wrote drivers for it, which didn't work perfectly
2010-05-23T12:45:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	.... you're using 8.04?
2010-05-23T12:45:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	that's end of life, you know, right?
2010-05-23T12:46:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	the thing is that 8.04 is not supported anymoree..... so having issues is 100% normal
2010-05-23T12:47:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	vbl	what are the issues in Lucid? (10.04)
