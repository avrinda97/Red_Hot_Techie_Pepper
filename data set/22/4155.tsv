2008-03-02T03:43:00.000Z	robdig	The_Linkster	are you using amd 64? according to this, http://packages.ubuntu.com/libsasl2-modules-gssapi-heimdal it should be there.

2008-03-02T03:51:00.000Z	robdig	The_Linkster	you're just trying to install, not build, right?
2008-03-02T03:51:00.000Z	The_Linkster	robdig	What do you mean?
2008-03-02T03:52:00.000Z	robdig	The_Linkster	you are not trying to compile it, right? just download and install...
2008-03-02T03:53:00.000Z	The_Linkster	robdig	Well I need to use it so I guess I need to compile it.
2008-03-02T03:57:00.000Z	robdig	The_Linkster	hmm, i think you will need to open a bug on this at https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+filebug my thought is that they set a wrong dependency in the package
2008-03-02T03:57:00.000Z	The_Linkster	robdig	What does that mean?
2008-03-02T03:58:00.000Z	robdig	The_Linkster	that i can't help you get it installed...i believe the package has a bug in it...i'm sorry
2008-03-02T03:59:00.000Z	The_Linkster	robdig	Ok. v_v Thank you anyway.
2008-03-02T03:59:00.000Z	robdig	The_Linkster	np, wish i could have helped
2008-03-02T04:03:00.000Z	The_Linkster	robdig	Could I try manually try installing the package or get the package from the debian apt-get list?
2008-03-02T04:04:00.000Z	robdig	The_Linkster	it is possible to get it from debian, but i have never done so
2008-03-02T04:04:00.000Z	The_Linkster	robdig	Oh ok.
