2007-11-01T06:04:00.000Z	Milkinator		I am in the Unreal installer and trying to set a target path. The default is 'user/local/games/UT2004' The error is no write permissions. What can I do to get around this?
2007-11-01T06:04:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	sudo sh ./"installer"
2007-11-01T06:05:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	that is how I should start the installer? So I should not use the UT2004 installer?
2007-11-01T06:05:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	how did you start the installer from the beginning?
2007-11-01T06:06:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	cd yourself into the correct directory then sudo sh ./<insert whatever the installer is called here>
2007-11-01T06:06:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	I double click on the linux install from the CD - asks me some questions - Tells me it is a x86 machine - then I am to select a place for install
2007-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	First of all copy the installer file to your home directory ;)
2007-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	Milkinator		oh, I copied it to a ut folder
2007-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	Else you'll have troubles when switching CDs
2007-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	Milkinator		brb doing what Azzco my new heros says
2007-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	cd /path/to/installer | sudo sh "installer name" I think that should do it as long as the installer is run as root
2007-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	Milkinator		I can't move it to home
2007-11-01T06:09:00.000Z	Milkinator		ok
2007-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	Can't copy it!?
2007-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	I was typing as that came up
2007-11-01T06:10:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	doing it now
2007-11-01T06:14:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	I am typing in this... but I don't know what is wrong with it. cd linus-installer.sh | sudo sh linux-installer.sh
2007-11-01T06:15:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	i have more than one cdrom drive
2007-11-01T06:15:00.000Z	Azzco	Milkinator	Where did you copy the installer?
2007-11-01T06:15:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	it didn't copy the installer, it had an error
2007-11-01T06:16:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	no such file or directory
2007-11-01T06:16:00.000Z	Milkinator	Azzco	what is wrong with this line: cd linus-installer.sh | sudo sh linux-installer.sh
