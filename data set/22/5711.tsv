2008-05-19T07:05:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	run 'compiz --replace' in a terminal and pastebin the output
2008-05-19T07:10:00.000Z	klepto		www.pastebin.com/m20292f35
2008-05-19T07:10:00.000Z	klepto		it says xgl not present
2008-05-19T07:10:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	that's not the real error (it always says that), and that paste url is wrong
2008-05-19T07:11:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	ah, had to remove the www :)
2008-05-19T07:11:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	what video card do you have?
2008-05-19T07:13:00.000Z	klepto		I have a Nvidia GeForce8600M GT
2008-05-19T07:13:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	use System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
2008-05-19T07:14:00.000Z	klepto	crdlb	it blank and says no propiertary drivers are on this system
2008-05-19T07:14:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	ensure that linux-generic is installed, then try again
2008-05-19T07:16:00.000Z	klepto	crdlb	linux-generic is installed. I see it through synaptic
2008-05-19T07:16:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	I don't know why it's not showing up then, but you do need to install the nvidia driver somehow
2008-05-19T07:17:00.000Z	klepto	crdlb	I have to install nvidia-glx ?
2008-05-19T07:18:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	nvidia-glx-new
2008-05-19T07:18:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	then run: sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24
2008-05-19T07:18:00.000Z	crdlb		and reboot
2008-05-19T07:23:00.000Z	klepto	crdlb	-d 24 is an uncrecognize option it says
2008-05-19T07:24:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	you installed nvidia-glx-new ?
2008-05-19T07:24:00.000Z	klepto		yes
2008-05-19T07:24:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	I don't know why it would say that then
2008-05-19T07:24:00.000Z	crdlb	klepto	the default is 24 though, so it might be ok
