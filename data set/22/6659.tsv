2006-10-06T11:57:00.000Z	jazzrocker		anyone know why my motherboard would only be using half of it's available RAM?
2006-10-06T11:57:00.000Z	jazzrocker		has anyone ever experienced this?
2006-10-06T11:57:00.000Z	kmaynard	jazzrocker	bad ram?
2006-10-06T11:57:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	i'm sort of doubting it
2006-10-06T11:58:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	it's brand new from circuit city, and my other (original RAM) is having the same behavior
2006-10-06T11:58:00.000Z	kmaynard	jazzrocker	is it a linux-only problem? does windows recognize it?
2006-10-06T11:58:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	no it's a bios level problem
2006-10-06T11:58:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	i've got two identical 1G chips, brand new from circuit city, BIOS reports 1G of total ram
2006-10-06T11:59:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	so does top
2006-10-06T11:59:00.000Z	kmaynard	jazzrocker	1) update bios, 2) double check bios settings, 3) return
2006-10-06T11:59:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	i originally bought a single 1G chip from them
2006-10-06T11:59:00.000Z	kmaynard	jazzrocker	there's some sort of reset option on most bios's...try it?
2006-10-06T11:59:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	of the other brand of RAM they have. it also registered as half size
2006-10-06T11:59:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	that's why i took it back
2006-10-06T12:00:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	ok i'll try resetting/flashing my BIOS
2006-10-06T12:01:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	it's a lower tier mobo, BioStar K8NHA Grand
2006-10-06T12:02:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	was a good deal from newegg.com iirc
2006-10-06T12:16:00.000Z	kmaynard	jazzrocker	any solution yet?
2006-10-06T14:39:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	i flashed my bios and everything is all good :)
2006-10-06T14:39:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	yay for 2G of RAM!
2006-10-06T14:39:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	i did have to buy a new floppy drive to do so :(
2006-10-06T14:40:00.000Z	jazzrocker	kmaynard	but my old one was white, my case is black, and this floppy is black too... so now my case matches finally! :)
