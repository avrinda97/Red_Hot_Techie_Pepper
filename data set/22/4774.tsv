2008-06-03T23:00:00.000Z	benny269		anyone know how to configure tbird so that it leaves all mail on the google servers but when you read and delete messages it does these actions for you on the server?
2008-06-03T23:01:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	use IMAP
2008-06-03T23:02:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	essentially thunderbird will act like a frontend to your gmail account
2008-06-03T23:04:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	you should be able to set them all up in thunderbird, under seperate accounts
2008-06-03T23:07:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	if you just want to use one mail program thunderbird is the ideal solution
2008-06-03T23:07:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	as long as all the mail you want to check supports pop or IMAP
2008-06-03T23:08:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	i dont think hotmail and Y!mail do that's why i was advised to use those
2008-06-03T23:09:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	i can't advise what to use for hotmail or yahoo since i use neither, but IMAP is the way to go w/ thunderbird
2008-06-03T23:10:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	you could forward your yahoo and hotmail to gmail and then set up gmail on thunderbird using IMAP
2008-06-03T23:12:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	hmm but even if i setup that as imap they'll still be in the original accounts also right? plus do the sender details get changed?
2008-06-03T23:13:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	you'll know who sent them and they will stay in their original accounts, but as Ienorand said apparently hotmail doesn't forward mail out
2008-06-03T23:14:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	so is there no way around it for hotmail?
2008-06-03T23:14:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	why would you want to forward it back to the account of origin?  it'll still be there anyway
2008-06-03T23:15:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	oh, i thought you forwarded the message itself, not a copy
2008-06-03T23:15:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	it's a copy.  if there is no way to forward hotmail and it doesn't have POP or IMAP access, frankly, i'd just stop using hotmail
2008-06-03T23:17:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	unfortunately i can't do that easily, its my oldest and most used account
2008-06-03T23:17:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	does hotmail allow you to set an away message?
2008-06-03T23:17:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	not sure, why?
2008-06-03T23:18:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	because if it does and you're worried about people not being able to reach you you can just set an away msg with a different email address
2008-06-03T23:19:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	its more to do with newsletters, and contact details i've left, i wouldn't want to leave it anyway, i'd rather just use it online
2008-06-03T23:20:00.000Z	pha|con	benny269	it sounds like you're going to be using more than one program or accessing via http
2008-06-03T23:22:00.000Z	benny269	pha|con	well if webmail works as Ienorand says it should be fine with tbird
