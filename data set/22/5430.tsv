2007-04-30T14:37:00.000Z	hexicode	stillunknown	Im in a live cd of debian and trying to use qt parted to resize sda1
2007-04-30T14:37:00.000Z	hexicode	stillunknown	/dev/sda1 is ext3
2007-04-30T14:37:00.000Z	hexicode	stillunknown	says its read only
2007-04-30T14:38:00.000Z	hexicode	stillunknown	its the main ubuntu partition
2007-04-30T14:38:00.000Z	stillunknown	hexicode	You only have one partition for ubuntu?
2007-04-30T14:38:00.000Z	hexicode	stillunknown	no 3
2007-04-30T14:39:00.000Z	stillunknown	hexicode	So your problem is that sda1 is mounted?
2007-04-30T14:39:00.000Z	hexicode	stillunknown	no it gets unmounted but cant resize
2007-04-30T14:40:00.000Z	stillunknown	hexicode	I have no experience with resizing, you'll have to poke someone else
