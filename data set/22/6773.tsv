2006-08-03T07:10:00.000Z	wthww_	wildman	lemme know how it goes
2006-08-03T07:10:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	it doesn't :-|
2006-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	wthww_	wildman	re-install Reader?
2006-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	still get the pango errors... (and yes, pango was one of the many updates installed today)
2006-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	that's what I thought to do next
2006-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	I'll wipe it all (config and all) and reinstall
2006-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	will keep you posted
2006-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	wthww_	wildman	good idea. if that doest clear it, it may be a valid bug
2006-08-03T07:12:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	I'm sure it's a newly introduced bug cuz acroread isn't the only app having that pb as the posts show... there are others too.
2006-08-03T07:12:00.000Z	wthww_	wildman	yeah. lol
2006-08-03T07:12:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	but on a 'desperate' attempt to fix, I'll reinstall acrobat
2006-08-03T07:13:00.000Z	wthww_	wildman	if all else fails, you can use Oo.o to import/export them :P
2006-08-03T07:13:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	remember, the pb is in acrobat's menus (And all fonts it uses) not in the PDFs ;)
2006-08-03T07:14:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	PDFs are fine, the app's menus not.
2006-08-03T07:14:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	hopefully ;)
2006-08-03T07:14:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	OOo menus are readable I can confirm that now ;)
2006-08-03T07:24:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	reinstalled, same problem. Updated pango/cairo/fonts pkgs have a bug
2006-08-03T07:24:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	:-|
2006-08-03T07:25:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	well... I'll live with it for now cuz I cannot stop working, but I doubt Ubuntu will end on the shinny new Dell laptop waiting for me at the office... I might go back to my old love
2006-08-03T07:26:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	no, it's not XP, don't worry ;)
2006-08-03T07:26:00.000Z	wthww_	wildman	lol. ittl get fixed soo how much ua wanna bet
2006-08-03T07:27:00.000Z	wildman	wthww_	gotcha, I hope so, and I'm not a bets man ;)
