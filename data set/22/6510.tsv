2006-10-10T10:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	wilssgrant	np  just put the link that worked that way more people will see it.
2006-10-10T10:55:00.000Z	wilssgrant	chuckyp	Dang, well it compiled, I copied over the right files into opera's plugin folder, but alas it still does not work (loading a page with embeded video results in a blank grey box where the video should be
2006-10-10T10:55:00.000Z	chuckyp	wilssgrant	maybe a codec problem
2006-10-10T10:56:00.000Z	wilssgrant	chuckyp	Even though mplayer works fine in firefox?
2006-10-10T10:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	wilssgrant	I'm not really sure how all that is working. But if it works outside it should work embedded.
2006-10-10T11:00:00.000Z	wilssgrant	chuckyp	would it be a codec problem even though mplayer works fine in firefox?
2006-10-10T11:01:00.000Z	chuckyp	wilssgrant	no  if it works in mplayer or with firefox it should work.  Thats odd I would maybe look for a support forum for the mplayerplug-in .
