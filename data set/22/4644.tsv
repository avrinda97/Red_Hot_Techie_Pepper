2008-09-17T13:20:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	make sure it's executable
2008-09-17T13:20:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	well, the directory the application needs to be executable anyhow
2008-09-17T13:20:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	the file should only be readable as the application user
2008-09-17T13:21:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	what do you mean by "the application user"?
2008-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	All applications are run as a user
2008-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	if it's a daemon then most has his own user, otherwise it's often you
2008-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	this is what is confusing, how come my applications can read my files, then ?
2008-09-17T13:23:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	For example, i assume you are in x-chat right now? x-chat is run as you, therefore, all files _you_ can read, x-chat can read. All files _you_ can edit, x-chat can edit.
2008-09-17T13:24:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	It's as simple as that, always.
2008-09-17T13:24:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	With one exception, applications can't use a non-executable directory.
2008-09-17T13:24:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	i am in weechat-curses. I understand you point (now). For some reason, the files I am creating are not being read by my applications (probably after each restart, although I am not 100% positive). There is a problem. Can you help me find it and solve it?
2008-09-17T13:25:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	Hopefully. What files are the applications making?
2008-09-17T13:25:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	Some kind of configuration files?
2008-09-17T13:26:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	Oh. What files are _you_ making. :-)
2008-09-17T13:26:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	one of the problems i am facing, for example, is related to checking out from svn. I'll make a pastie.
2008-09-17T13:27:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	Sure... although i do now know nearly nothing about svn.
2008-09-17T13:28:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	http://pastie.org/273959
2008-09-17T13:30:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	Ah... that file, what's the permissions on it?
2008-09-17T13:31:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	the file doesn't exist prior to running the command. I am checking out for the first time.
2008-09-17T13:32:00.000Z	zhaozhou	sinan	the folder exists, right?
2008-09-17T13:33:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	the folder "jawaker" doesn't. The folder "work", from which i am writing the command does. The folder "jawaker" is created by SVN.
2008-09-17T13:41:00.000Z	sinan	zhaozhou	danbh_intrepid: fixed the problem, added a uid attribute to fstab. Thanks for your efforts ! ;)
