2010-01-03T07:27:00.000Z	shushek	Alan502	I guess mine is not a good Q?.. how to speed up the usb data tranfer in ubuntu 9.10.. its damn SLOW
2010-01-03T07:28:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	hmmm ... i'm not sure, it can be a driver problem, perhaps. Google is my friend :) let me check...
2010-01-03T07:29:00.000Z	shushek	Alan502	i did GOOGLE a lot and found it is a bug.. but as i'm just an amature ubuntu user, dont know  how to get this done...
2010-01-03T07:31:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	me neither :( i'm an amateur linux user as well
2010-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	shushek	Alan502	perhaps two amateur can become a pro one day:)
2010-01-03T07:34:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	of course!
2010-01-03T07:35:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	maybe asking with the specifc model of your motherboard/usb card might help
2010-01-03T07:35:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	pastebin what lspci lists
2010-01-03T07:56:00.000Z	shushek	Alan502	gigabyte GA-M51GM-S2G motherborad and AMD X2 3600+ processor am using and this issue was not there when i was using 8.04LTS

2010-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	here, sorry :D
2010-01-03T08:08:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	well, it might be a bug, 9.10 is still young
2010-01-03T08:08:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	do you have your bugfixes up to date?
2010-01-03T08:14:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	hmm ubuntu should prompt you automatically to update
2010-01-03T08:14:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	bugfixes are in the ubuntu software center iirc
2010-01-03T08:14:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	open up the ubuntu software center, and look for 'updates'
2010-01-03T08:23:00.000Z	shushek	Alan502	i do get updates, but those are only about the kernela nd the apps i use... nothing much.. is am missing something..
2010-01-03T08:24:00.000Z	Alan502	shushek	update, it might be a kernel problem
2010-01-03T08:26:00.000Z	shushek	Alan502	that is wht the forums says.. and does that mean tht i've live with is for the time being.. I"M NOT GOIN TO WINDOWS AT ANY COST
