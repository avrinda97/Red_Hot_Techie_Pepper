2010-06-19T02:41:00.000Z	_pg_		does anyone know of a good guide to dualboot (l)ubuntu and windows xp mini on a single flash drive?
2010-06-19T02:42:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	You can put a virtual machine on the Ubuntu OS on the USB drive and install windows XP to that.  It will take a ton of space (for a flash drive) the performance will probably not be great.
2010-06-19T02:42:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	not a bad idea. might be awful slow though, depending on computer...
2010-06-19T02:43:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	Probably :)
2010-08-22T06:08:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	Whey not just play pandora on the laptop?
2010-08-22T06:08:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	How does the blackberry connect to the laptop?  bluetooth or something?
2010-08-22T06:09:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	its over the cell connection and im too cheap to pay for tethering
2010-08-22T06:09:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	double male headphone jack from bb into mic in port atm
2010-08-22T06:09:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	not really doing anything though....
2010-08-22T06:09:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	any ideas?
2010-08-22T06:09:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	You can just turn up the volume on that I think.  I don't think you need any special software at all.
2010-08-22T06:10:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	i cant get any sound from the bb coming out of the lappy at all. How can I proceed?
2010-08-22T06:10:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	I have a sound applet-dont really know how to make the magic happen though....
2010-08-22T06:11:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	Not really.  Other then to mess with all the sound setting guis you can find.  System -> Pref -> Sound
2010-08-22T06:11:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	Right click the applet icon.
2010-08-22T06:11:00.000Z	_pg_	edbian	in "sound prefs" i have no input devices detected it seems
2010-08-22T06:11:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	I don't know a bunch about sound in linux.
2010-08-22T06:12:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	Well that's a problem! :D

2011-04-18T03:14:00.000Z	edbian	_pg_	You didn't really need help with that! :P
