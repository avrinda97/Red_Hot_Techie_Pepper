2010-09-09T04:05:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	Buggy bios i guess. /out for a few..
2010-09-09T04:06:00.000Z	burlington	Hopsa	 buggy bios?  before I reinstalled everything, all seemed to work..   I used to be able to access grub.
2010-09-09T04:13:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	Something is making your bios not like your HD for some reason. Cable is seated properly maybe..
2010-09-09T04:15:00.000Z	burlington	Hopsa	yeah.  I have plugged and unplugged them   -   i mean everythinginstalls with no problems..  windows runs.. etc..
2010-09-09T04:15:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	But you said that it freezes at verifying DMI pool data. So it doesnt get past the bios.
2010-09-09T04:16:00.000Z	burlington	Hopsa	 It only froze when I moved the other hard disk to top boot priority..  There is nothing on that one..  So that makes sense...       The disk that I am trying to make work is a Western Digital - It is now set to top boot priority and windows comes up fine..  but no grub..
2010-09-09T04:18:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	A problem with one of the cables for the HD that contains the Linux boot.
2010-09-09T04:19:00.000Z	burlington	Hopsa	I can try replacing the cable...  but.  like i said, windows is on the same drive and it is working fine
2010-09-09T04:19:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	If its ide the cable can be attached upside down in some cases. This will cause that error youre having.
2010-09-09T04:22:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	"It only froze when I moved the other hard disk to top boot priority". As you also said "before I reinstalled everything, all seemed to work". Did you install windows after linux ? This will remove grub from the MBR, but then why did the bios freeze at "Initializing DMI pool data" ? / Doesnt make sence to me.
2010-09-09T04:24:00.000Z	burlington	Hopsa	  I did install linux after installing windows...   The other hard disk has nothing on it..  nothing..  I can unplug it if you hink its best..  Linux and windows are both on the WD.     the AD is top boot priority.. Windows boots fine..  but no Grub..
2010-09-09T04:25:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	Replace the windows disk with the Ubuntu disk and see what happens, use the windows disks cables.
2010-09-09T04:26:00.000Z	burlington	Hopsa	 Both operating systems are on the same disk.
2010-09-09T04:27:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	Aha, so "The other hard disk has nothing on it" has no meaning in this case. Unplug it for now.
2010-09-09T04:31:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	What script ? i cant see him mentioning a script anywhere ? / Jordan_U ?
2010-09-09T04:31:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	good.
2010-09-09T04:31:00.000Z	burlington	Hopsa	 Wow!  thanks a bunch..  I dont know what this means.. though
2010-09-09T04:32:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	So your bios has issues with that unplugged drive that is empty.
2010-09-09T04:32:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	Get IBM DFT and check that unplugged drive. Np
2010-09-09T04:32:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	Nope, itll not
2010-09-09T04:42:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	HW issue. See if switching to secondary master or primary slave will work better. Change cable if that doesnt work (Adjust boot order accordingly in the bios.)
2010-09-09T04:47:00.000Z	Hopsa	burlington	Np! I hope itll last so that its not some glitchy connection somewhere. Have fun!
