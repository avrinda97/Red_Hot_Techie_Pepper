2010-01-15T03:30:00.000Z	nixjr		why can i not change file permissions? im using nautilus and im the owner of the file(s)
2010-01-15T03:31:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	are the files on an fat32 or ntfs drive?
2010-01-15T03:31:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	yes its an ntfs
2010-01-15T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	I don't think ubuntu cares about file permissions on ntfs drives
2010-01-15T03:34:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	the reason im trying to chnage the file permissions is because there are many files (txt, jpg, cue ... etc) all marked as being executables, how might i fix that?
2010-01-15T03:34:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	I think you can change that in your fstab file.. although I'm not sure exactly what to do..
2010-01-15T03:36:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	only my second day using linux, its hard to know where to start looking, thank you for the help, ill start reading
2010-01-15T03:36:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	check that link ubottu sent you..  you can also google for "ntfs permissions ubuntu".. that ought to get you some good hits
2010-01-15T03:37:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	slightly off topic, am i right in assuming file extensions mean nothing in linux?
2010-01-15T03:37:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	correct.. although I think gnome might use them for some superficial stuff
2010-01-15T15:18:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	do you have an url to that guide?
2010-01-15T15:19:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Jaunty#Associate_default_applications
2010-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	I don't have a jaunty machine available at the moment.. I don't really remember an advanced menu in the system administration menu.. but I might be wrong
2010-01-15T15:23:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	ive only had ubuntu two days so please excuse my ignorance, but is it worth changing to something other then jaunty?
2010-01-15T15:24:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	it depends... 9.10 is newer.. 9.04 had some issues with intel graphics cards amongst other things.. 9.10 has issues with some things as well...
2010-01-15T15:25:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	but both are less than a year old.. so it's not really a problem
2010-01-15T15:27:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	i only picked 0.04 because i had it on cd and it saved me having to download anything, your saying even with 9.10 it dosnt mean i wont have issues?
2010-01-15T15:28:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	9.10 is far from perfect.. but the next version 10.04 will be a LTS version.. that means it will have longer support and is supposed to be more stable
2010-01-15T15:28:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	you can just wait until april and upgrade then
2010-01-15T15:29:00.000Z	nixjr	Slart	can i do that without reformatting my system?
2010-01-15T15:29:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	you can usually just upgrade "in place".. without loosing any files
2011-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	Slart	nixjr	I've never seen any settings or switches for doing that.. not saying it's impossible though.. there might be some tricky way
