2007-11-04T01:18:00.000Z	racarter		using gparted, there looks to be an extra 4MB of space before and after the ntfs parition.. would it do any harm to try to resize the parition so it uses up the free space?
2007-11-04T01:19:00.000Z	racarter		well the thing is that my vista parition doesn't boot, so im trying to think of things to do without erasing the drive
2007-11-04T01:19:00.000Z	racarter		i am downloading ultimatebootcd as was the suggestion before.. but i still want to avoid reformating the whole drive
2007-11-04T01:20:00.000Z	racarter		um.. i get the loading screen from vista and it just stays there
2007-11-04T01:20:00.000Z	racarter		when i try to boot to safe mode i see it just stops when trying to load crcdisk.sys
2007-11-04T01:22:00.000Z	racarter		apparently toshiba and microsoft dont know anything about vista either :)

2007-11-04T01:25:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	racarter	can u re-partition?
2007-11-04T01:26:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	racarter	imagine breaking up a candy bar... execpt it's a hard-drive... lol... 1gb swap, x-gb etx3, and x-gb ntfs (windows)

2007-11-04T01:29:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	racarter	h/o
2007-11-04T01:29:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	racarter	what's wrong with that?
2007-11-04T01:30:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	racarter	looks like it's fine to me...
2007-11-04T01:31:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	racarter	what is this? that partition setup is fine... if windows doesn't boot, grub isn't pointing to the right place, if linux doesn't boot grub is still messed up...
2007-11-04T01:33:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	racarter	you can't change the paritions of the hard-drive your running right now... you have to cut it off first...
