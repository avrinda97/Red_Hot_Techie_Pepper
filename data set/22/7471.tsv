2006-03-25T13:49:00.000Z	sfar-ubu		wow that was f*cked up,, my monitor just went crazy.. it was like zoom-in/zoom-out/zoom-in/zoom-out etc for about 2-3 seconds .. and it kinda made a click-sound
2006-03-25T13:50:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	power off and reseat your video card
2006-03-25T13:51:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	and your leads
2006-03-25T13:51:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	 well.. ill wait until its totally broken :)
2006-03-28T16:37:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	how do you differ bins from bins then? :)
2006-03-28T16:39:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	I take it you got the "file Filename" thing there a moment ago
2006-03-28T16:39:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	yep :)
2006-03-28T16:41:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	how do you know if its "sh", "run" or "./Filename" to use? :)
2006-03-28T16:41:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	given the question I take it you already know the answer
2006-03-28T16:42:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	 hehe, actually not :)
2006-03-28T16:43:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	man file will explain it better than I could in irc - it reads the file and looks for clues
2006-03-28T16:43:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	thanks for the tip
2006-03-28T16:45:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	type >>strings /bin/ls | less << then press CTRL+C
2006-03-28T16:46:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	heh, what was that?
2006-03-28T16:47:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	the fact when you type >>file /bin/ls<< a clue that was in that text allows file to tell you the result for the start of this line
2006-03-28T16:48:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	ah, i see
2006-03-28T16:49:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	inside most scripts you find >>#!/path/program to interpert the script<< so it can work out if it is a shell script perl or whatever
2006-03-28T16:49:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	if a file has a +x value in the mode (ls -la)
2006-03-28T16:54:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	so if the file has the executable bit set it will work with ./ otherwise perl foo.pl or sh file.sh - note the extentions are conventions and the shell does not have a convention to deal with them (but gnome / kde kind of do)
2006-03-28T16:57:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	okay. thanks for explaining :)
2006-03-28T16:58:00.000Z	sfar-ubu	ompaul	there is so much to learn
2006-03-28T16:59:00.000Z	ompaul	sfar-ubu	little steps make for an easy journey, running fast you miss stuff
