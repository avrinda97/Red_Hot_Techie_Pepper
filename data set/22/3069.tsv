2009-09-18T09:56:00.000Z	RukusX		I have two new filesystem mounts that only have root access. my user must have access to these mounts. How do i set that?
2009-09-18T09:56:00.000Z	RukusX		Access must be full
2009-09-18T09:57:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	you may need to look at the chown and chmod commands.
2009-09-18T09:58:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	k
2009-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	excellent news.
2009-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	i lied
2009-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	i got more work to do
2009-09-18T10:06:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	chown changes the ownership of the files.  Chmod changes the permissions.
2009-09-18T10:06:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	i am not understanding what i need to do. i just need  read/write permissions for two mounted partitions.
2009-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	file / folder?
2009-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	I'm not really an expert with chmod, though.  If nobody steps up, you may need to google it.
2009-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	k thanks man
2009-09-18T10:12:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	I think it can be either.  A -R applies chmod recursively.
2009-09-18T10:12:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	i found a couple good help files in google now that i know what to look for
2009-09-18T10:13:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	sometimes we're better off with a hint than the actual answer.
2009-09-21T08:28:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	rather
2009-09-21T08:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	I suspect that it might be a "misprint".  The USB is probably working at full speed despite the message.
2009-09-21T08:31:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	timing was 1000kb/sec roughly
2009-09-21T08:33:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	rather
2009-09-21T08:33:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	but when i connect my usb 2.0 thumb drive i get usb 2.0 speeds!
2009-09-21T08:37:00.000Z	dsnyders	RukusX	I'm not sure then.
2009-09-21T08:37:00.000Z	RukusX	dsnyders	 ur not the only one
