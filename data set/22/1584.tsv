2010-06-24T09:43:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	read regexp.info, has all the good parts :)
2010-06-24T09:43:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	err, http://regexp.info
2010-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	That website looks useful. Thank you.
2010-06-24T10:01:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	hmm, easiest way?  add some users to your system
2010-06-24T10:02:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	The packages would be installed for all users. That work? One user get KDE, the other user get XFCE? It's not the approach I'm looking for. I wanted a virtual -- but a native virtual -- Without having to install it on the HDD? Meh.
2010-06-24T10:03:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	well, if your just 'trying it out' for an hour or two adding a user, then deleting the user when done is the cleanest way without leaving a bunch of random files in your home dir
2010-06-24T10:04:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	I understand. What about packages? ;)
2010-06-24T10:04:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	the packages should be fine to all be installed in your system
2010-06-24T10:06:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	the packages (if installed through apt-get or aptitude or similar) will be available for all users.  Not quite sure what a native virtual means
2010-06-24T10:06:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	Snapshots.
2010-06-24T10:06:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	That's what I'm thinking. I'm reading stuffs at the moment. No sweat. :2
2010-06-24T10:07:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	well, you can have gnome and kde installed, log out of kde and then log into gnome, although you cant have the gnome desktop and the kde desktop running for the same user in the same X display at once
2010-06-24T10:08:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	If you have another X display, you can have it running KDE. Not the approach I'm looking for. What I want to do is snapshots. Basically, I like it, I saved it. Then I start messing around with it. No sweat. I go back to my pristine condition.
2010-06-24T10:09:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	with a couple exceptions kde stores all its info in ~/.kde/
2010-06-24T10:09:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	so if you make a tarball out of that directory you can call that a snapshot
2010-06-24T10:09:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	not as familiar with gnome but its likely similar
2010-06-24T10:12:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	It does. I'm just not looking to install any metapackages. I want to experience a standalone kde minimal + xfce minimal. Not to mention I heard good things about LXDE (maybe for my netbook).
2010-06-24T10:49:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	Okay. Do you happen to know if I were to install KDE on a new user, would GNOME apps and KDE apps overlays each others on new user? What about XFCE? I don't want to resort to figuring out which icon/package/settings belongs to.
2010-06-24T10:51:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	well, i'm actually using a very simple fluxbox install, no kde/gnome, but iirc they play pretty well together
2010-06-24T10:52:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	no, you would have to install opera as root
2010-06-24T10:52:00.000Z	ddilinger	red2kic	should be a .deb package you can just 'sudo dpkg -i opera.deb' on
2010-06-24T14:59:00.000Z	red2kic	ddilinger	Please check your PM. I have uploaded cool screensavers for you to use! ;)
