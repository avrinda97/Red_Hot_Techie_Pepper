2011-09-17T17:06:00.000Z	nightquaker		what mean PA?
2011-09-17T17:07:00.000Z	nightquaker		And also, i have a problem, well, some question about Ubuntu 11.04, can i ask?
2011-09-17T17:09:00.000Z	nightquaker		ok, so, when i turning off or restarting my PC, i see a error "dbus main process (466) killed by TERM signal", it's happening after about 1 day after installing and upgrading Ubuntu
2011-09-17T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	I wouldn't worry about that
2011-09-17T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	correct
2011-09-17T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	please do
2011-09-17T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	I really wouldn't worry about it, a termination on shut down is fine
2011-09-17T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	that's fine
2011-09-17T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	install conky, configure it, run it
2011-09-17T17:12:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	there is a good guide on the wiki.ubuntu.com site
2011-09-17T17:14:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	that's fine
2011-09-17T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	it's not something you launch like that, if you read the wiki as I suggested it will explain how to use it
2011-09-17T17:32:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	control the language
2011-09-17T17:32:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	if you know it's a bad word, don't use it
2011-09-17T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	did you follow the guide I gave you and bazhang gave you ?
2011-09-17T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	you already had X installed
2011-09-17T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	if you're using a desktop that's already there
2011-09-17T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	right, so you didn't install X
2011-09-17T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	how ?
2011-09-17T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	nightquaker	you where already running it
