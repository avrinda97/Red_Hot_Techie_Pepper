2006-02-25T15:52:00.000Z	possie		where can i download the latest dapper ?
2006-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	possie		my 'ctrl' key and 'shift' stopped working, anyone that might have a clue what this could have caused/
2006-02-25T07:35:00.000Z	soundray	possie	is that in X or on the console, or both?
2006-02-25T07:36:00.000Z	possie	soundray	how i can't go to my console, since i can't pret ctrl alt f1
2006-02-25T07:36:00.000Z	soundray	possie	do you have two of each (Ctrl and Shift), or is it a laptop?
2006-02-25T07:36:00.000Z	soundray	possie	chvt 1
2006-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	possie	soundray	no it's a desktop system, but both ctrl's won't work
2006-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	possie	soundray	some hold for both 'shift' keys
2006-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	soundray	possie	perhaps Capslock is set to work as control?
2006-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	possie	soundray	no, just tried it
2006-02-25T07:38:00.000Z	possie	soundray	ah, 'alt' still works i pressing  alt s in xchat unfolds a menu item
2006-02-25T07:38:00.000Z	soundray	possie	run chvt 1 and check on the console, if it works on the console, restart X, if not, restart the box.
2006-02-25T07:41:00.000Z	possie	soundray	i can only get to the terminal, i don't know how to get into the real terminal, since 'ctrl' isn't working
2006-02-25T07:41:00.000Z	soundray	possie	READ! 'chvt 1'
2006-02-25T07:42:00.000Z	soundray	possie	if that doesn't work, 'sudo chvt 1'.
2006-02-25T07:43:00.000Z	possie	soundray	i can't type my password since it has uppercase characters in them, and 'shift' isn't working either
2006-02-25T07:44:00.000Z	soundray	possie	open another terminal, 'man ascii', and copy and paste the required characters.
2006-02-25T07:44:00.000Z	soundray	possie	or start with the other suggestion, rebooting the box.
2006-02-25T07:54:00.000Z	possie	soundray	nice command 'chvt' in console it just worked
2006-02-25T07:54:00.000Z	possie	soundray	ctrl, shift, etc
2006-02-25T07:54:00.000Z	soundray	possie	is it fixed then?
2006-02-25T07:55:00.000Z	possie	soundray	no i my x session it still doesn't work, i'll just go for a x restart, but i have to wait for something to complete first
