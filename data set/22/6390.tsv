2006-10-31T07:33:00.000Z	Supremacygnu		hi! I have a crashed system because I tried to upgrade from dapper to edgy. Now, is there any way I can save my files? Recovery mode does not work
2006-10-31T07:34:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	"i have crashed my system" doesn't tell us much info about what's actually wrong
2006-10-31T07:36:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	the thing is. After my upgrade I had several errors and the system didn't want to accept my password. And at reboot the system didn't restart and stops and gives me a black screen. No grub. I can't even reach it from my live boot cd because I don't have permission
2006-10-31T07:37:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	why did it require your password after the upgrade?
2006-10-31T07:38:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	I have no idea... I upgrade it when I was asleep and it said that it wanted my password so I just entered it and it tells me it's the wrong pass
2006-10-31T07:38:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	what asked you for a password and what was the message?
2006-10-31T07:39:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	the update manager asked me for password
2006-10-31T07:39:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	try to bit a bit less ambiguous.  its not fun to try to guess what is going on with your system.  you have to tell us the specifics
2006-10-31T07:40:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	and at that point you rebooted?
2006-10-31T07:42:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	alright, Well. I do rememeber that it said something about an error but I ignored it and continued. When I was back I typed my password in and it failed. I checked my update manager and it said I had something wrong which I could fix with dpkg --status -a or something, but it didn't work since it didn't want to accept my password. So I went in to this irc channel and they said I'd probably reboot and start recovery mode. Noth
2006-10-31T07:42:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	was this a major upgrade?
2006-10-31T07:43:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	yes
2006-10-31T07:43:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	and can you mount the filesystem from the install cd?
2006-10-31T07:43:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	so I have kinda given up hope for upgrading. And now I want to save my files
2006-10-31T07:43:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	no. 1 sec
2006-10-31T11:25:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	use sudo in front of your command
2006-10-31T11:25:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	I've already tried that
2006-10-31T11:26:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	sudo cp .....
2006-10-31T11:26:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	sudo cp /target/home/tobbe/* /media/Volume/
2006-10-31T11:27:00.000Z	teledyn	Supremacygnu	yes.  a better command woudl be sudo rsync -av /target/home/tobbe /media//Volume/
2006-10-31T11:34:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	seems to work, can't really determine that yet, i'm copying 15 gig...
2006-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	teledyn	I don't know if you have time. But since you helped me before. Please check this link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1694796#post1694796
