2005-11-01T11:29:00.000Z	fluvvell		I have issues with sound, once had it all working now dont.  any clues as to troubleshooting alsa?  I can get an output from speakers with the esd command.
2005-11-01T11:30:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	you -can- or you -can't- get any sound output?
2005-11-01T11:32:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	you -can- or you -can't- get any sound output?
2005-11-01T11:32:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	just test sound from esd.  Looking for troubleshooting pointers really, have got stuff to work on my other mandrake system fine and this worked when I first installed it.
2005-11-01T11:33:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	cat /proc/asound/cards . Paste output in #flood
2005-11-01T11:34:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	so sound -does- work, just not through esd?
2005-11-01T11:35:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	 I dont have the names of the tools to play with setup.  cant even find a /etc/init.d/   command to properly start the esd daemon
2005-11-01T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	is System> Preferences> Sound> Enable sound server startup checked?
2005-11-01T11:38:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	yep
2005-11-01T11:39:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	are you using mplayer -ao esd
2005-11-01T11:40:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	dpkg -l mplayer\*|grep ^ii
2005-11-01T11:42:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	and your cpu is...?
2005-11-01T11:43:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	amd sempron
2005-11-01T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	64-bit?
2005-11-01T11:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	do you think I should uninstall and reinstall the 386 one?  No just 32bit
2005-11-01T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	if you're using the 32-bit version, you should be able to use mplayer-k6
2005-11-01T11:49:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	thanks for that, I hadnt even heard of it!
2006-01-19T16:47:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	what do you mean race?
2006-01-19T16:47:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	imagine the situation where you can't verify su hasn't been compromised
2006-01-19T16:48:00.000Z	crimsun	fluvvell	granted, a rather corner case, but that's one of the reasons sudo exists
2006-01-19T16:48:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	ok
2006-01-19T16:49:00.000Z	fluvvell	crimsun	of course root login would need to be enabled to allow su  eg. ubuntu
