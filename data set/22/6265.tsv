2009-04-21T18:56:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	there's a guy of the french ubuntu community who wiresharked with only skype opened, and noticed it was sending TCP packets containing its firefox bookmarks to an unknown server
2009-04-21T18:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	uhuh, sure

2009-04-21T19:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	proving what, exactly?
2009-04-21T19:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	do you know what stat64() does?
2009-04-21T19:06:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	it writes a file to a buffer afaik
2009-04-21T19:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	no
2009-04-21T19:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	it gets some information about the file (typically size and permissions)
2009-04-21T19:07:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	and why would they need information about this ? what's the point of it ?
2009-04-21T19:08:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	thats not true. Ubuntu supports any audio except some apps that dont use pulseaudio, ie. Adobe Flash (proprietary), Skype (proprietary), Wine (tho its meant to be coming)
2009-04-21T19:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	you can't entirely get rid of pulseaudio, though
2009-04-21T19:09:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	you can, its been overposted on the web. and what's the point of getting rid of it ? just use alsa if you don't like it :)
2009-04-21T19:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	because pulseaudio will grab the alsa hardware any chance it gets, and not give it up
2009-04-21T19:10:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	shut pulseaudio down then :) or remove it from your PC. i'm running alsa here.
2009-04-21T19:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	and, since I don't want to use pulseaudio under any circumstances, there should be a clean way to remove it
2009-04-21T19:11:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	you mean "sudo aptitude purge pulseaudio" ? :D
2009-04-21T19:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	which then wants to clobber ubuntu-desktop ;-)
2009-04-21T19:11:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	this is just a virtual package :) i removed it to get rid of pidgin
2009-04-21T19:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	yeah, but then apt goes mental when you update...
2009-04-21T19:13:00.000Z	SiDi	gordonjcp	well, thats true :) you have to remember about putting the package back and then removing pulse again, which is painful
2009-04-21T19:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SiDi	yeah
