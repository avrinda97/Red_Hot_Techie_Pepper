2007-02-11T14:09:00.000Z	tuskernini		Question, is wlan connection different (pc to pc) than normal wlan?
2007-02-11T14:10:00.000Z	calach	tuskernini	what do you mean by normal wlan?
2007-02-11T14:10:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	wlan from a more common router... ex. dlink...
2007-02-11T14:11:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	we have a project in the city where you can log onto the city wlan but when I open network manager... it sees it as a little computer  and i can not connect..
2007-02-11T14:11:00.000Z	calach		hmmm
2007-02-11T14:12:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	not as my home wlan... and as the other wlans here in the complex
2007-02-11T14:12:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	if i create a wlan connection from my computer.. it also sees it as pc to pc..
2007-02-11T14:12:00.000Z	calach		yeah
2007-02-11T14:13:00.000Z	calach		well I mean, it is a computer to computer connection
2007-02-11T14:13:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	and i can not connect to such a connection made by a friend from a mac eather... but he can connect to one I make?
2007-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	calach		that is most likely just a firewall setting on his end
2007-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	any ideas? maby it needs something... verification? or being able to open a webpage?
2007-02-11T14:15:00.000Z	calach	tuskernini	you only have problems with ad hoc networks, not infrastructure right?
2007-02-11T14:15:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	yes with no key... have not tried to disable my home wlan key yet
2007-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	calach	tuskernini	wait your home wlan is operating as ad hoc?
2007-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	no it has a key or am i not understanding you
2007-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	calach		well ad hoc and infrastructure can all use keys
2007-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	calach		but most home networks use infrastructure
2007-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	tuskernini	calach	so i must have infrastructure... how can i find out? iwconfig?
2007-02-11T14:18:00.000Z	calach	tuskernini	connect to your router
2007-02-11T14:18:00.000Z	calach	tuskernini	sorry i cant help you much I dunno
