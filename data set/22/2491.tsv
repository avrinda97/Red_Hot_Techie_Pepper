2009-08-16T09:30:00.000Z	dsdeiz_		anyone able to get the acer multimediakeys functioning?
2009-08-16T09:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 acer makes a lot of lpaotps/desktops/machines...
2009-08-16T09:32:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	the laptop touchpads i think
2009-08-16T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 there are the gnome settings to redefind what keys do what special functions. perhaps remap them
2009-08-16T09:37:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	oh sorry. i'm not using gnome
2009-08-16T09:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 Oh- the-Huge-manatee! :P
2009-08-16T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 theres also ways to remap specific keys to  the proper XF86_WHATEVER events
2009-08-16T09:38:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	like xmodmap?
2009-08-16T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 yep - i had to play with that for an IBM keyboard i had.
2009-08-16T09:39:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	btw, xev also recognizes it but displays really weird outputs not like keyboard events
2009-08-16T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 i had to add some proper commands to  rc.local to get the xev keys seen/used right.. so i could remap them
2009-08-16T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 my script for my old IBM keyboard.
2009-08-16T09:43:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	er, too deep for me.. hehehe i'll just let these dang multimedia keys pass for now :D
2009-08-16T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 took me some time. Most of that file is comments. i had to figure out what keys were what.. and remap them to the right XF86xxxxxxxx
2009-08-16T09:48:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	can you take a quick peak on a xev output? :S
2009-08-16T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 most of mine just showed unknown keycode use.. whatever.. to set it...
2009-08-16T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 but i can try :P
2009-08-16T09:49:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	thanks!

2009-08-16T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 means very little to me.. I had keys thet the kernel dident even recognize. so my issue wa a bit different.
2009-08-16T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dsdeiz_	 i followed the rather old guide at --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaKeys
2009-08-16T09:52:00.000Z	dsdeiz_	Dr_Willis	oh ok.. got it. will read it now
