2008-09-07T00:52:00.000Z	banisterfiend_		hey guys how come when i turn 'swap on' in my partition editor the next time i boot my computer it's not automatically turned on? i have to turn it on each time...how do i make it so it stays on automatically each time i boot?
2008-09-07T00:53:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	add a line for it to /etc/fstab
2008-09-07T00:53:00.000Z	banisterfiend_	soundray	can't i do it through the partition editor thougH?
2008-09-07T00:53:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	no
2008-09-07T00:54:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	there is nothing wrong with "manually" editing config files
2008-09-07T00:55:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	you can reinstall ubuntu. That will generate a new /etc/fstab
2008-09-07T00:56:00.000Z	banisterfiend_	soundray	well i see the swap in the file, it's /dev/sda3  so why doesn't it automatically turn on when i boot my system?
2008-09-07T00:56:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	I agree with bavardage.
2008-09-07T00:57:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	because there is no way for any "automatic" procedure in ubuntu to know whether you want to use that swap partition for ubuntu.
2008-09-07T00:58:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	it could be dedicated swap space for another OS on your disk, or it could be a pure hibernate rather than a swap partition.
2008-09-07T00:58:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	just add the swap line to /etc/fstab, it's not even worth discussion automatiing that.
2008-09-07T01:00:00.000Z	banisterfiend_	soundray	can you tell me if this file is in order, my swap space is /dev/sda3, not i haven't touched this file, this is how it is...yet still it appears to be 'off' after a boot: http://www.pastie.org/267335
2008-09-07T01:01:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	please run 'sudo blkid' and pastebin that, too

2008-09-07T01:04:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	your swap space UUID has changed. 'gksudo gedit /etc/fstab', edit line 10 and replace the UUID with the new one: UUID="c73eb5f8-0739-4e30-a348-036f9e43d834"
2008-09-07T01:05:00.000Z	banisterfiend_	soundray	wow thanks
2008-09-07T01:05:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	does that make sense?
2008-09-07T01:05:00.000Z	banisterfiend_	soundray	yes i moved partitions around recently
2008-09-07T01:06:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	if you want to, you can remove the entire UUID reference and refer to the swap partition by its device name instead, /dev/sda3
2008-09-07T01:07:00.000Z	banisterfiend_	soundray	ok cool ill try that
2008-09-07T01:09:00.000Z	banisterfiend_	soundray	out of interest why does it use the UUID if the /dev/device_name thing is so much easier?
2008-09-07T01:10:00.000Z	soundray	banisterfiend_	if you change your partitions, the device name can change. The UUID stays the same, until you reformat the partition. In general, the UUID change has made things more robust -- your situation is the exception
