2012-01-17T02:12:00.000Z	acidfrost		never heard it refer to globbing though ;p
2012-01-17T02:12:00.000Z	acidfrost		yeah
2012-01-17T02:14:00.000Z	acidfrost		tons
2012-01-17T02:15:00.000Z	acidfrost		cat /var/log/*/* | grep nouveau
2012-01-17T02:16:00.000Z	acidfrost		only goes down a layer at time though
2012-01-17T02:17:00.000Z	acidfrost		!ask | deseee
2012-01-17T02:17:00.000Z	acidfrost		err
2012-01-17T02:17:00.000Z	deseee	acidfrost	I have an application that requires Ubuntu 10.04LTS, however, the dependencies it wants are of higher version than is available in the 10.04 Repo. Is it OK to use "too new" of a version of the dependencies on the Ubuntu 10.04LTS?
2012-01-17T02:18:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	yeah its fine
2012-01-17T02:18:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	its usually a nightmare if you plan on updating later though what with the dependency spectrum
2012-01-17T02:19:00.000Z	deseee	acidfrost	Yes that's what I was afraid of, and, the "third software" is supposed to be working on the LTS because of what it works *with*.
2012-01-17T02:30:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	could you not upgrade to 10.10 and fix the issue ?
2012-01-17T02:31:00.000Z	deseee	acidfrost	Exactly- I cannot. The primary software specifically recommends 10.04LTS. I got no issue with LTS, per say, it's my "third software" that I need working that says it wants newer versions of a couple packages.
2012-01-17T02:32:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	i suppose the only way then is to install all of the dependencies manually
2012-01-17T02:37:00.000Z	deseee	acidfrost	Is there any way to install the higher package numbers needed without compiling each of the packages from source?
2012-01-17T02:37:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	you could add the 10.10 ppa though this might cause conflicts later
2012-01-17T02:40:00.000Z	deseee	acidfrost	AAAaaah, OK yeah. Yeah that's an option. ... ... Well, thanks for the help! I wish it was easier answer for us :)
2012-01-17T02:41:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	no problem
2012-01-17T02:50:00.000Z	deseee	acidfrost	Hey if I add the 10.10 Repo into 10.04LTS, wont it see updates for many many packs and want to update them? That would make it very non-LTS (if I'm not mistaken)?
2012-01-17T02:50:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	don't update via the update manager
2012-01-17T02:51:00.000Z	acidfrost	deseee	you need to remove the ppa for 10.10 after you get the packages you need
2012-01-17T02:52:00.000Z	deseee	acidfrost	AAAAAaaaaaa! OK I broke it one time by using UpdateManager after adding a "future" repo like that. :) hahhahahahah  OK you two are making sense to me, now!
