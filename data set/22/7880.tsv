2005-12-04T06:46:00.000Z	_888_		derek[]  BIOS has only hdd or flop options for boot; i am able to boot from floppy to DOS and load proprietary drivers for cdrom and i can see ubuntu disc and its content, but i dont know what to do now
2005-12-04T06:48:00.000Z	_888_		derek[]  hdd is wiped out, unfortunately i was too quick and fdisk'd it
2005-12-04T06:50:00.000Z	_888_		derek[]  h have ubuntu cd in my cdrom and i see it in DOS; i dont see any "install" or "setup" file there :/
2005-12-04T06:51:00.000Z	_888_		derek[]  i know ;) then how do i install it it *without* windows?
2005-12-04T06:53:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	have you updated your bios?
2005-12-04T06:54:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	yes my bios is the last from 2000, no newer versions since then (old notebook)
2005-12-04T06:56:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	derek[]  - its a tiny acer notebook 310 series, it never had cd boot option in bios

2005-12-04T07:00:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	there is a solution for that
2005-12-04T07:00:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	thx for link, checkin
2005-12-04T07:01:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	dont use that link
2005-12-04T07:01:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	there is a floppy booter that will boot from cd
2005-12-04T07:01:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	hold on
2005-12-04T07:01:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	yes i see, its not exactly about my situation that link. Waiting patiently :))
2005-12-04T07:03:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	floppy booter which i can add to the disc is probably what i need exactly :) then i'll just run it from the cd and it'll take care of loading the rest?
2005-12-04T07:05:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	hmm I dont think thats it
2005-12-04T07:11:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	sorry dude I cant find the thing
2005-12-04T07:12:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	no prob :( i guess i gotta go back to win2k on this notebook :(
2005-12-04T07:14:00.000Z	poningru	_888_	found it
2005-12-04T07:14:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	how about this one more shot at an idea: i install win95 (because hdd is very small), and is there a way to run ubuntu installation by dumping cd content on a hdd and starting installing it within windows?
2005-12-04T07:15:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	ok, checkin
2005-12-04T07:18:00.000Z	_888_	poningru	i have tried smart boot manager before; when i created its floppy and booted with it - it can't see my cd-rom since its a pcmcia attached cdrom
