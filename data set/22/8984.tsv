2005-04-13T11:25:00.000Z	kkathman		ok back :)
2005-04-13T09:02:00.000Z	kkathman		I know this is rudimentary, but can someone explain what an RPM is and how I would use it?
2005-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	there must be a tar.gz release too... surely?
2005-04-13T09:04:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	I'll see if I can find one, but I keep running into this RPM :(
2005-04-13T09:04:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	there is a source tarball (tarball is X.tar.gz or X.tar.bz2) available for gimpshop
2005-04-13T09:05:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	do you have a link for that?
2005-04-13T09:05:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	http://videos.thebroken.org/vids/GIMPshop-source-2.2.4.tbz
2005-04-13T09:06:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	im not sure if thats correct, i found it by googling -- so can u :)
2005-04-13T09:06:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	I guess I missed that one
2005-04-13T09:06:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	:)
2005-04-13T09:07:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	I dont want to mess things up too much, so I may just try GIMP first, I do all my graphics today in PS7 in Windows
2005-04-13T09:07:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	Gimp's interface is a little rusty, but its improving with each release the functionality is amazing anyway.
2005-04-13T09:07:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	using PS7 kills kittens!
2005-04-13T09:08:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	My requrements arent exactly huge, but PS is just what I cut my teeth on so to speak...so learning a new GUI is ok as long as I can do mostly the same things
2005-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	I killed kittens??? Hmm I'm a mass murderer of the feline kind
2005-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	yes, you are!
2005-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	if ur reqs arent huge, im willing to bet Gimp can do what u need it to ;)
2005-04-13T09:11:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	As long as is has layers, transparencies, image manipulation (sizing and transforms) and basic drawing Im kewl
2005-04-13T09:11:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	its had those features for, errm, 4 years? :D
2005-04-13T09:11:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	excellent :)
2005-04-14T14:32:00.000Z	kkathman	roo_	talking is ok, answering is ok, its when you say "Are you sure to yourself" thats when the insanity starts
2005-04-14T14:34:00.000Z	roo_	kkathman	agreed :)
