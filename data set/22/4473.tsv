2008-01-02T06:30:00.000Z	Nicholas-2		What is the root password for the Ubuntu LiveCD?
2008-01-02T06:30:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	there is none. sudo should just works without a password
2008-01-02T06:30:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	It asked me for a password.
2008-01-02T06:31:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	It says: "root@ubuntu:/home/ubuntu#
2008-01-02T06:32:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	so? that means you're root. sudo -i gives you a root shell
2008-01-02T06:39:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	what?
2008-01-02T06:41:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	whatever you wanted to do that you thought required root?
2008-01-02T06:48:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	yes, windows first then ubuntu. Grub can do both Windows and Linux and BSD and most OSes you might come across
2008-01-02T06:48:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	read the private message sent by ubotu
2008-01-02T06:49:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	So I can't save this installation then?
2008-01-02T06:49:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	sure you can. you want to re-install grub to your MBR?
2008-01-02T06:50:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	Yes, how?
2008-01-02T06:50:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	did you see what ubotu said above? Lost grub after installing windows?
2008-01-02T06:50:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	why not? what did you get hung up on?
2008-01-02T06:53:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	It said error while parsing number.
2008-01-02T06:54:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	at which point?
2008-01-02T06:54:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	root (hd0,1)
2008-01-02T06:56:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	don't worry about it, that's why we're here, to ask the right questions ;)
2008-01-02T06:56:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	I typed setup (dh0) and it said "Cannot mount selected partition".
2008-01-02T06:57:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	i would try the "Using the Desktop/LiveCD and Overwriting the Windows bootloader" section. it's a better solution imho. if you get hung up, feel free to ask the channel
2008-01-02T06:58:00.000Z	Nicholas-2	preaction	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50456/plain/
2008-01-02T07:00:00.000Z	preaction	Nicholas-2	you use root (hd0,1), but it says that /boot/grub/stage1 is at (hd0,0) (which is what you're supposed to use for root from what i understand of this tutorial)
