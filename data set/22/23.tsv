2012-11-12T06:33:00.000Z	iatrogene		so, ever since upgrading to 12.10, my audio doesnt work right... if i am listening to music and open a 2nd app that uses audio, even if the audio isnt active (like a paused flash player),
2012-11-12T06:33:00.000Z	iatrogene		the audio on the primary app degrades noticably
2012-11-12T06:33:00.000Z	iatrogene		especially noticable with flash and VLC
2012-11-12T06:33:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	degrades meaning?
2012-11-12T06:35:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	are you using pulseaudio?
2012-11-12T06:35:00.000Z	iatrogene	escott	yep
2012-11-12T06:37:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	the staticy bit is weird. maybe its using a hardware mixer that is rather poor. as for the stops and starts thats just starvation of the stream. you could try playing around with schedulers. the problem is EVERYONE has multi-core systems these days and the schedulers are designed with that in mind.
2012-11-12T06:37:00.000Z	iatrogene	escott	understood, but its strange it all worked fine under 12.04
2012-11-12T06:38:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	well you do get a new kernel, and that kernel will have various differences. you might try selecting and booting your old kernel and see how that works
2012-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	iatrogene	escott	thank you for the advice
2012-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	is that working?
2012-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	the firefox thing is scheduler related.
2012-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	im not sure what scheduler changes went into the kernel in 3.5 but you can examine things in /sys.
2012-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	its entirely possible that there is some change in syntax for cifs entries
2012-11-12T07:11:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	they are not exactly, but they must share some stuff
2012-11-12T07:46:00.000Z	iatrogene	escott	it appears you might be right, 3.2.0-pae works great. all the 3.5.x versions, pulseaudio gets cut.
2012-11-12T07:47:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	then you have a audio driver regression and a scheduler regresion
2012-11-12T07:49:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	changelogs and git bisect
2012-11-12T07:49:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	no i mean /sys
2012-11-12T07:51:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	/proc is for running processes, /sys is for kernel tunables. some stuff that is now in /sys used to be in /proc
2012-11-12T07:57:00.000Z	escott	iatrogene	given that the hardware is probably at the end of its desktop usable lifespan i would just pin yourself to the older kernel
2012-11-12T07:58:00.000Z	iatrogene	escott	still, its DDR2, i get better results out of a dual single core xeon DDR era machine i have upstairs
