2007-10-06T10:15:00.000Z	eyemean		im very new to linux
2007-10-06T10:15:00.000Z	eyemean		sorry rockets and ubotu, i didnt mean to come across like that
2007-10-06T10:17:00.000Z	eyemean		yes dr_willis, im lost as to where to even start
2007-10-06T10:17:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	why do you need to compile it?
2007-10-06T10:18:00.000Z	eyemean		no its not in ubuntu list
2007-10-06T10:18:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	why not just download the binary .jar ?
2007-10-06T10:18:00.000Z	eyemean	rhelmer	i tried the jar file and it just dont work properly, and i have hava installed
2007-10-06T10:19:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	well you'll need to get help from them i guess.. looks here's a similar program "esniper" in ubuntu already, you might want to try that instead
2007-10-06T10:19:00.000Z	eyemean		thats correct dr_willis
2007-10-06T10:20:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	did you see http://www.jbidwatcher.com/help/faq.shtml#ans20
2007-10-06T10:20:00.000Z	eyemean	rhelmer	didnt realise that, will give that a go now thank you
2007-10-06T10:20:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	sure
2007-10-06T10:20:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	if you want to try jbidwatcher again, make sure you have the right version of java as they suggest ^
2007-10-06T10:20:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	since it's java, recompiling is not going to help, java binaries are cross-platform
2007-10-06T10:25:00.000Z	eyemean	rhelmer	are you sure esniper is already  in ubuntu, cant find it in software list
2007-10-06T10:26:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	oops, sorry it's only in gutsy :(
2007-10-06T10:26:00.000Z	rhelmer	eyemean	i should've checked that
2007-10-06T10:26:00.000Z	eyemean	rhelmer	that ok
