2005-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	marsh		no one can help at all with totem/mplayer not getting even to looking at the dvd drive?
2005-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	marsh		all I wanna do is play a dvd :(
2005-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	marsh		i got it
2005-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	I have the same kind of problem, but I don't use my computer for DVDs anyway -- I don't have a /dev/dvd device file; Is that your problem too?
2005-06-10T09:07:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	fuser /dev/dsp for instance. :)
2005-06-10T09:07:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	thanks man..
2005-06-10T09:07:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	add the -k switch, as root, to kill all processes using that device.
2005-06-10T09:09:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	keeps coming up with errors - no matter what i do I cant umount it..?!?!
2005-06-10T09:10:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	which errors, and which device are you doing it to?
2005-06-10T09:11:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	says /dev/hdc dissagrees with fstab... just checking fstab now
2005-06-10T09:12:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	says /dev/hdc dissagrees with fstab... just checking fstab now..
2005-06-10T09:13:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	this is what happens when you issue the command: umount /dev/hdc ?
2005-06-10T09:14:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	fstab says /dev/hdc is mounted on /media/cdrom0 - but thats not mounted( at least that's what it says when i try...
2005-06-10T09:14:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	 AH!?!
2005-06-10T09:16:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	- this is going to sound a bit cheeky - but thats how i got here in the first place - eject says 'unmount od /dev/hdc/ failed.
2005-06-10T09:16:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	bah. It's a pain sometimes. When 'eject' fails to work I either keep issuing the command until it decides to come around to my way of thinking ... or... and this is drastic... reboot and get the CD out at BIOS time. :(
2005-06-10T09:17:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	 - i trying to get a god uptime! trying to reduce my 'well a reboot will sort it out' attitude... :(
2005-06-10T09:18:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	there's probably a way around it...
2005-06-10T09:24:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	got it - kept trying, then it came up with a '(and you are not root) in a messge - went in again killing and fusering everything with sudo, and i'm in. (and it's out!)
2005-06-10T09:24:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	w00t!
2005-06-10T09:25:00.000Z	marsh	tchmnky	;)
2005-06-10T09:26:00.000Z	tchmnky	marsh	I've been thinking of getting one -- just to do vlc|mplayer -zoom tv:// -- sounds like fun. :)
