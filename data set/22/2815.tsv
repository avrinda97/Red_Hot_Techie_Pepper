2010-02-08T13:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Hold down shift
2010-02-08T13:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Which files, since when, and in what way?
2010-02-08T14:02:00.000Z	Lint01	Jordan_U	files that was installed by package manager
2010-02-08T14:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	There are different ways you can check what files have been modified and how, which to use depends on why you want to know. What is your end goal?
2010-02-08T14:07:00.000Z	Lint01	Jordan_U	I need a list of all files created by package manager which were modified after creation
2010-02-08T14:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Why? I can't give a good answer without knowing.
2010-02-08T14:11:00.000Z	Lint01	Jordan_U	how am I supposed to answer this question? also 'modified'='content changed', not just modification date
2010-02-08T14:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Possible options are etckeeper, dpkg log and bzr log of source packages, doing a diff from a fresh install and others. I refuse to explain all of them, and they all have different advantages and limitations.
2010-02-08T14:15:00.000Z	Lint01	Jordan_U	are you kidding me? I'm not gonna install a second system for this
2010-02-08T14:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	That's only one of the multiple options
2010-02-08T14:18:00.000Z	Lint01	Jordan_U	how dpkg log can help here? if it is impossible, just say so
2010-02-08T14:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	It may not be possible to easily do what you want, or it may be almost trivial, or somewhere in between depending on what you really want to accomplish. Please read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#goal . If you do not want to give more information then I am sorry to say I can't help you further, your question as stated is hard but not impossible to accomplish. It is not worth my time or yours for me to explain the steps required to
2010-02-08T14:34:00.000Z	Lint01	Jordan_U	which part of my question did you not understood or which additional information do you require? It's rather clear in my opinion
2010-02-08T14:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	I'm sorry, I can't help you.
2012-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Rather than complaining, please describe the problem you're having.
2012-04-25T06:55:00.000Z	Lint01	Jordan_U	I cannot uninstall upgrade using the package manager
2012-04-25T06:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Are you trying to uninstall a package or install an older version of a package?
2012-04-25T06:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	What package and why do you need an older version?
2012-04-25T06:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Please stop with the unproductive complaining. This is your last warning.
2012-04-25T06:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	You can simply "sudo apt-get remove linux-image-version" where "version" is the specific version you want removed. But you still haven't explain what the root problem is, maybe if you did we could give you a better solution.
2012-04-25T07:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lint01	Ubuntu does not remove old kernel packages, so the next most recent kernel package will be used.
