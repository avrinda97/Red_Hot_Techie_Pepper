2006-12-22T15:14:00.000Z	peirce141		i need help setting up my ubuntu box to allow ssh connections, i followed this guide: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy, but I can't seem to connect to my machine
2006-12-22T15:15:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	to accept from where? intranet or internet?
2006-12-22T15:16:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	i have two other machines on my local network, just trying to transfer files
2006-12-22T15:16:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	it's as simple as installing openssh-server, that's all, no need to follow any guides..
2006-12-22T15:17:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	i did that, it still won't connect
2006-12-22T15:17:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	what command do you issue?
2006-12-22T15:17:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	no error, just no response at all
2006-12-22T15:19:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	what firewall gui have you used?
2006-12-22T15:20:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	I just use the built-in firewall of my D-Link router
2006-12-22T15:23:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	ps ax | grep ssh
2006-12-22T15:24:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	this is the output of that: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38411/
2006-12-22T15:24:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	it's running then
2006-12-22T15:25:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	hostname -i
2006-12-22T15:26:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	that outputs 127.0.1.1, should i be using that?
2006-12-22T15:27:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	you must set your /etc/hosts
2006-12-22T15:27:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	add a line in /etc/hosts as follows
2006-12-22T15:27:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	192.168.0.100 name-of-your-machine
2006-12-22T15:28:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	okay, ill try that
2006-12-22T15:29:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	should i restart a service after changing /etc/hosts or just go with it?
2006-12-22T15:30:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	well restart network yes.. the best thing is to use the /system/admin/network gui
2006-12-22T15:32:00.000Z	peirce141	blue-frog	still doesnt work with changes to /etc/hosts
2006-12-22T15:32:00.000Z	blue-frog	peirce141	see pm
