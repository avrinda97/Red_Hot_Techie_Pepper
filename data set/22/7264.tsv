2006-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	Ayabara		I have a permissions issue. created an ext3 partition and mounted it with default options in fstab. now I can't write to it. permissions are set to '755'
2006-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	Ayabara		permissions on /dev/sda3 and on mountpoint /media/sda3 are set to '755'
2006-06-12T10:10:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	change the ownership of the drive.
2006-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	how do I do that?
2006-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	sudo chown -R user:user /foo
2006-06-12T10:12:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	thanks
2006-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	changed ownership and remounted, but it didn't work
2006-06-12T10:18:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	well it should have
2006-06-12T10:19:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	should the permissions be '777'?
2006-06-12T12:04:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	yes they are, but which version of vlc are you using in each
2006-06-12T12:05:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	which card,
2006-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	I always forget. it's an inspiron 6000, and I think it's a radeon 9700
2006-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	that should be covered by fglrx.
2006-06-12T12:07:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	ok, and fglrx should be ok on a fresh dapper install?
2006-06-12T12:07:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	indeed
2006-06-12T12:11:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	how can I check that it is indeed working?
2006-06-12T12:11:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	fglrxinfo
2006-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	don't have fgl_glxgears, and glxgears says: Unknown device ID 5460, please report. Assuming plain R300.
2006-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	:s not sure that has installed correctly
2006-06-12T12:14:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	me neither.. should I just follow the ati wiki then?
2006-06-12T12:15:00.000Z	Ayabara	frying_fish	thanks for helping.
2006-06-12T12:15:00.000Z	frying_fish	Ayabara	you're welcome.
