2011-02-03T18:12:00.000Z	bc81	link	can you test your ability access those sites through a free proxy?  eg. anonymouse
2011-02-03T18:13:00.000Z	link	bc81	i forgot to mention in the post that both routers have the same ISP
2011-02-03T18:13:00.000Z	bc81	link	go to anonymouse and enter the address of the site you have trouble accessing http://anonymouse.org/
2011-02-03T18:15:00.000Z	link	bc81	the thing is the page itself loads, but for example the youtube clip won't even start or load, and on the yahoo mail page, when i click on a mail message, it just loads forever and doesn't show it
2011-02-03T18:15:00.000Z	bc81	link	you use firefox?
2011-02-03T18:16:00.000Z	link	bc81	this issue appears in every browser i use: Firefox, Seamonkey, Chromium, and only from my home router
2011-02-03T18:17:00.000Z	link	bc81	the thing is i can't access my workplace router to find it's settings so i can copy them to my own router
2011-02-03T18:20:00.000Z	link	bc81	so, any ideas?
2011-02-03T18:22:00.000Z	bc81	link	no clue at all...maybe try different dns servers?  edit your connections' IPv4 Settings, set it to Automatic (DHCP) Adresses Only, and add this to DNS servers: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 (those are google's)
2011-02-03T18:24:00.000Z	link	bc81	the router is on dhcp
2011-02-03T18:24:00.000Z	link	bc81	i will try the google dns thing
2011-02-03T18:27:00.000Z	link	bc81	tried the google dns think, no change
2011-02-03T18:27:00.000Z	bc81	link	bah i'm out of suggestions, sorry
2011-02-03T18:27:00.000Z	bc81	link	you hard-resetted the router, or soft?
2011-02-03T18:28:00.000Z	link	bc81	i hard reseted it about 3 times, and soft reseted it 2 times
2011-02-03T18:29:00.000Z	bc81	link	got any ip filtering software running (suck as moblock)
2011-02-03T18:30:00.000Z	bc81	link	you tested from an ubuntu live cd environment? (sorry for all the obvious questions)
2011-02-03T18:31:00.000Z	link	bc81	that i didn't do, don't have one handy, but i will
2011-02-03T18:32:00.000Z	link	bc81	thing is they both worked fine, until some ubuntu updates a few weeks back
2011-02-03T18:33:00.000Z	link	bc81	both wireless
2011-02-03T18:34:00.000Z	bc81	link	anyhow, maybe update your post with more details like all these things you tested, it might help get a faster reply :-)..i gotta go, so good luck i hope you figure it out!
2011-02-03T18:35:00.000Z	link	bc81	thanks
