2006-02-19T15:12:00.000Z	Creeture	fletch33	looks like permissions. You doing it as root?
2006-02-19T15:12:00.000Z	fletch33	Creeture	sorrry no
2006-02-19T15:12:00.000Z	Creeture	fletch33	do it as root. You have no choice in the matter.
2006-02-19T15:14:00.000Z	fletch33	Creeture	ok i did it as sudo and check this out http://pastebin.com/554892
2006-02-19T15:16:00.000Z	Creeture	fletch33	the first line means that the download failed. everything after that is caused by the first.
2006-02-19T15:16:00.000Z	fletch33	Creeture	 yeah it made it thru 99% of it and then i got that
2006-02-19T15:17:00.000Z	Creeture	fletch33	Maybe see if you can wget it. Try the apt-get update again.
2006-02-19T15:17:00.000Z	fletch33	Creeture	i am trying to install a tar for the first time not from synaptic and i was told to update my apt-get but it is not working
