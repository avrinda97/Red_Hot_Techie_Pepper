2010-02-05T01:36:00.000Z	`mOOse`		just chat about what? the weather? vodka? your new car?
2010-02-05T01:36:00.000Z	`mOOse`		I recommend efnet
2010-02-05T01:38:00.000Z	mezquitale	`mOOse`	have you ever encrypted a hard drive?  I want to encrypt a secondary hard drive
2010-02-05T01:38:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	no I haven't - sorry
2010-02-10T00:54:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	what do you mean?
2010-02-10T00:55:00.000Z	mezquitale	`mOOse`	 basically I took my hard drives out and connected my USB drive to my laptop, I'm booting up to the CD and I'm going to perform the install on the USB drive, is this possible?
2010-02-10T00:56:00.000Z	mezquitale	`mOOse`	I wonder if ubuntu will have a problem if I boot up the USB on a different machine?
2010-02-10T00:56:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	no...they should work fine as long as the machine can bott from a usb port
2010-02-10T00:57:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	having them on a flashdrive is pretty cool
2010-02-10T00:59:00.000Z	mezquitale	`mOOse`	how much space do I need to install ubuntu though?  It looks like 1 gig wont cut it?
2010-02-10T01:00:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	I used 4 gig Lexar drives
2010-02-10T01:00:00.000Z	mezquitale	`mOOse`	i guess this project will have to wait until I get a bigger thumb drive then
2010-02-10T01:01:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	the base install is about 1.2 gigs
2010-02-10T01:02:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	the minimum flashdrive I'd use would be 4 gigs - 8 much better
2010-02-10T01:04:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	but he'd have to do that from a live cd or other installation
2010-02-10T01:05:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	he can't load ubuntu now
2010-02-10T01:06:00.000Z	mezquitale	`mOOse`	he sent you a PM?
2010-02-10T01:07:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	no
2010-02-10T01:07:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	he said win7 overwrote his mbr
2010-02-10T01:08:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	and the easiest way to do that is with the live cd
2010-02-10T01:11:00.000Z	`mOOse`	mezquitale	I thought he said he couldn't boot into ubuntu....if he can't boot into win7 right after installing it then something's wrong
2010-02-10T01:12:00.000Z	mezquitale	`mOOse`	the guy kind of left more than 5 minutes ago
