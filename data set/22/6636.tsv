2006-11-14T11:49:00.000Z	Skyrail		I've managed to get Apache working and an example webpage setup on this PC, problem is when I try to connect to it using it's networking IP address the other computer can't connect, what am I doing wrong? It used to be able to connect
2006-11-14T11:50:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	where can you connect from? local only?
2006-11-14T11:50:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	yeah using 127.0.0.1 other then that it keeps on timing out, is it because of a firewall? I'm trying to access through a router...
2006-11-14T11:51:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	yep it will be the firewall
2006-11-14T11:52:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	unless I installed it whilst trying to set up the server I only have a firewall on my router
2006-11-14T11:52:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	where is the pc accessing the page on the lan or coming in through the firewall/router
2006-11-14T11:53:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	hmm? I don't get you, all I do is type in 192.168.0.2 which is this PC's IP on the network...if you mean the port, I'm not entirely sure
2006-11-14T11:54:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	are you trying to access the webpage from a pc other than the one which apache is running on?
2006-11-14T11:55:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	yeah I have two PCs one which is running apache another which is not, I want to access the PC's webpage with Apache with the one without apache
2006-11-14T11:55:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	is that pc on a local network or connecting into your network from the internet?
2006-11-14T11:55:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	local network, I have yet to work out how to access via the itnernet
2006-11-14T11:56:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	oh give me a mo
2006-11-14T11:56:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	what error do you get when trying to access the page
2006-11-14T11:57:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	The Server 192.168.0.2 is taking too long to respond, I'll just mess around with some firewall settings, what ports would be used for the other PC to access this one?
2006-11-14T11:59:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	ok :)
2006-11-14T11:59:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	try /etc/init.d/iptables shutdown
2006-11-14T12:00:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	how do I restart it, and what does it do?
2006-11-14T12:01:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	what will that do?
2006-11-14T12:02:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	turn off the iptables firewall on the machine
2006-11-14T12:02:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	ok
2006-11-14T12:02:00.000Z	Skyrail	pybe	command not found
2006-11-14T12:12:00.000Z	pybe	Skyrail	good luck im off home
