2007-06-19T10:29:00.000Z	SyckSyn		After a recent reboot, grub fails with error 15.  The error persists through repeated attempts to reinstall grub with a live cd, as well as completely reinstalling Ubuntu (7.04).  Can anyone suggest a cause to the problem or a method of fixing it?
2007-06-19T10:29:00.000Z	BlueD	SyckSyn	maybe your partition table is bad!
2007-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	SyckSyn		the drive has been reformated though...
2007-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	BlueD	SyckSyn	try to check the table with some program, and then resintall Ubuntu

2007-06-19T10:32:00.000Z	SyckSyn		A full format would remove all the partitions, would it not? or does the ubuntu installer do something naughty when you tell it to format the entire drive?
