2009-12-03T00:47:00.000Z	soopos		What is the default root password in Ubuntu? My admin password does not work for "su -c xterm".
2009-12-03T00:47:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	nothing
2010-01-18T02:47:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	mta? (postfix) or client? (evolution)
2010-01-18T02:48:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	the one which sends emails, server one likely
2010-01-18T02:48:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	postfix
2010-01-18T02:49:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	Do you need it if you just send an email from your computer? Cannot you use gmail's server for that?
2010-01-18T02:49:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	you want a client then, like thunderbird or evolution
2010-01-18T02:49:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	I use mutt.
2010-01-18T02:50:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	yes and the default in ubuntu is evolution
2010-01-18T02:50:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	so you want a client, not a server
2010-01-18T02:51:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	Evolution is a graphical application?
2010-01-18T02:52:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	client?
2010-01-18T02:52:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	yes, its a graphical client
2010-01-18T02:57:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	 I get the error "Error sending message, child exited 1 ()." as I have this in .muttrc: set sendmail="postfix"
2010-01-18T02:57:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	what are you trying to do?
2010-01-18T02:58:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	you want to send an mail with your own smtp-server?
2010-01-18T02:58:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	To send a mail by Mutt
2010-01-18T02:58:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	apparently it is a must, since I cannot find another way
2010-01-18T02:58:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	and you want to send the mail to?
2010-01-18T02:59:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	local or internet
2010-01-18T03:00:00.000Z	soopos	iceroot	internet
2010-01-18T03:01:00.000Z	iceroot	soopos	maybe its better to use a smtp from gmx, google, hotmail or something else then setting aup a local mail-server
