2010-05-23T08:12:00.000Z	klenwell		Hello all, need some help with a partition resize that's frozen...
2010-05-23T08:12:00.000Z	klenwell		I was following the guide here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToRemoveWindows
2010-05-23T08:13:00.000Z	klenwell		Got about 3/4 through the resize and everything froze.  Mouse cursor responds but that's it...
2010-05-23T08:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	how long has it been frozen?
2010-05-23T08:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	I would wait a little longer before killing it
2010-05-23T08:16:00.000Z	klenwell	IdleOne	Yeah, I'm hoping it comes back to life.  If it doesn't... ? I did back up my home dir.  How long to wait?
2010-05-23T08:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	another 15-20 minutes and if it still isn't done then I guess you can kill it and hope for the best but like you said you did the smart thing and backed up :)
2010-05-23T08:18:00.000Z	klenwell	IdleOne	Yeah, just hope the backup works.  (I did do a test partial restore beforehand.)  Does killing it mean hard power-off?
2010-05-23T08:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	are you able to get a TTY ( ctrl-alt-F1) ctrl-alt-F7 to get back to GUI
2010-05-23T08:20:00.000Z	klenwell	IdleOne	No, can't get TTL.  Ctrl-Alt-F1 does nothing.
2010-05-23T08:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	umm yeah hard shut down I guess.
2010-05-23T08:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	tvaughn has a better idea. sorry I didn't think of it first
2010-05-23T08:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	that is the exact reason why we ask people to stay in the channel when asking for help :) so that others can peer review and make sure no bad advice is given
2010-05-23T08:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	you can type lsb_release -a in a terminal to see your version
2010-05-23T08:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	I don't see that you have any other choice
2010-05-23T08:53:00.000Z	klenwell	IdleOne	what should I expect?  Will I need to reinstall from scratch?
2010-05-23T08:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	you were formatting a windows partition correct?
2010-05-23T08:53:00.000Z	klenwell	IdleOne	yes
2010-05-23T08:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	ok and you already have ubuntu installed and booting properly?
2010-05-23T08:54:00.000Z	klenwell	IdleOne	yes
2010-05-23T08:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	klenwell	you should be fine but you probably will need to format that partition again
2010-05-23T08:54:00.000Z	klenwell	IdleOne	whew.  I hope that's the case.  Thanks!
