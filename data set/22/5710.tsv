2007-08-17T14:24:00.000Z	psst		how do I format a drive I have just connected via USB?
2007-08-17T14:25:00.000Z	genii	psst	good to know: what filesystem and what device it was seen at
2007-08-17T14:26:00.000Z	psst	genii	any idea how I can tell?  it has no fs atm
2007-08-17T14:27:00.000Z	genii	psst	report result of command: sudo fdisk -l
2007-08-17T14:28:00.000Z	genii		!pastebin |psst
2007-08-17T14:34:00.000Z	genii	psst	Did you see the results of the command:  sudo fdisk -l     yet?
2007-08-17T14:36:00.000Z	psst		genil: that only lists /dev/sda1, sda2 and sda5
2007-08-17T14:37:00.000Z	genii	psst	When you powered on the external, did you get a popup window?
2007-08-17T14:38:00.000Z	psst		genil: no
2007-08-17T14:38:00.000Z	psst		genil: it's not formatted yet, so there's no fs to mount
2007-08-17T14:39:00.000Z	psst		genil: any way to track what device it is?
2007-08-17T14:39:00.000Z	genii	psst	Please spell my nick genii so that when i can tell immediately you are speaing to me :) thx

2007-08-17T14:40:00.000Z	genii	psst	thx :) OK, do you know which disks already existed in your computer before this? sda sdb or so on
2007-08-17T14:41:00.000Z	psst	genii	same three
2007-08-17T14:42:00.000Z	genii	psst	unplug external, then replug. then in console do:  dmesg and see if it reports a new drive number
2007-08-17T14:43:00.000Z	genii	psst	   tail dmesg    will do too
2007-08-17T14:43:00.000Z	psst	genii	ooh!  Lots of errors
2007-08-17T14:45:00.000Z	genii	psst	At very bottom of the dmesg stuff does it say about the usb drive being found etc
2007-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	psst	genii	may I pm you with the output?
2007-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	genii	psst	does command:  ls /dev/sdb* produce anything?
