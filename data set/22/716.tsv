2012-11-11T04:30:00.000Z	scottyg_		have any of you ever mapped a win7 drive from ubuntu?
2012-11-11T04:32:00.000Z	scottyg_		that is so helpful thank you!!! i guess when one is ignorant, one blames other software...what a retard you are thelinux
2012-11-11T04:32:00.000Z	scottyg_		win 7 is WAY better than any linux distro...you fag
2012-11-11T04:32:00.000Z	scottyg_		smbfind: command not found
2012-11-11T04:32:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	whats the question... i didnt understand
2012-11-11T04:35:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	you should be able to access it with smb://ipaddress in nautilus. if you want a regular mount you need to create a CIFS entry in fstab
2012-11-11T04:38:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	it would help us if you told us what you have tried
2012-11-11T04:39:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	yes. stop asking that question, and start telling us exactly what you have tried
2012-11-11T04:40:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	and what were your results. did anything work, did anything give you error messages, what?
2012-11-11T04:41:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	and we have answered that question. it is possible to moutn CIFS on linux, its also possible to use things like SAMBA
2012-11-11T04:41:00.000Z	scottyg_	escott	i get a myriad of error messages each one different from the last.  tell me what to do and i will paste the errors that follow!
2012-11-11T04:42:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	anything you tell us is more than the nothing you have told us so far
2012-11-11T04:43:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	and this happens when you flush the toilet? or when you turn on the car? or when you run a command of some form?
2012-11-11T04:44:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	thank you
2012-11-11T04:48:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	psusi, lost two 's need one after the $ and before /media
2012-11-11T04:49:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	sudo mount -t cifs -o username=scottyg,password=pex571 '//192.168.6.3/e$' /media/shares
2012-11-11T04:50:00.000Z	scottyg_	escott	sudo mount -t cifs -o username=scottyg,password=pex571 '//192.168.6.3/e$' /media/shares
2012-11-11T04:53:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	you have to have some patience. you are asking linux to connect to windows file sharing. its not surprising that windows connecting to windows file sharing works well (it would be surprising if it didnt)
2012-11-11T05:01:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	thats probably introducing another escaping issue. you need to escape the \ with either \\ or quoting the username/password string
2012-11-11T05:02:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	i you type "echo \s" in the shell it prints "s" not "\s" you need to have \\s or you need to have quotes 'username=blablah\blah,password=blah'
2012-11-11T05:03:00.000Z	scottyg_	escott	 that is difficult for me to get
2012-11-11T05:06:00.000Z	escott	scottyg_	please read the link ikonia sent you above
