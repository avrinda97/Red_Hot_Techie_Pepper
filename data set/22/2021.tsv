2009-10-30T13:20:00.000Z	SunlessHalo		well... my issue is that my HDA Audio hasn't started since few last boots... how could I re-enable it?
2009-10-30T13:21:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	what version of ubuntu are you using ?
2009-10-30T13:22:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Armageddon	I'm using Kubuntu Karmic
2009-10-30T13:23:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	and you have a problem with what exactly ?
2009-10-30T13:24:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	and now it doesn't work ?
2009-10-30T13:24:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Armageddon	but, today morning the sound just didn't load... pulseaudio plays the system bell, but the main sound Inte HDA Realtek ALC660-VD doesn't work at all
2009-10-30T13:25:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Armageddon	I hardly suppose the problem could be treated differently
2009-10-30T13:25:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	HDA is out from HDMI
2009-10-30T13:25:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	I don't think it will work on your speakers if they are not plugged HDMI
2009-10-30T13:26:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Armageddon	I am using centrino1duo asus laptop, the HDA was responsible for all sound
2009-10-30T13:26:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	I'd try another option then the HDA
2009-10-30T13:27:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	try internal audio
2009-10-30T13:27:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Armageddon	explain me, please
2009-10-30T13:28:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	well I use gnome so it is fairly different that's why you need people using KDE to help, BUT on gnome, I go to sound preferences, I choose Hardware and I choose which one to use
2009-10-30T13:28:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	I have an internal Audio and an HDMI one
2009-10-30T13:28:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	with inputs and outputs
2009-10-30T13:32:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Armageddon	what shall I also do now?
2009-10-30T13:32:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	right click on the sound button, go to preferences
2009-10-30T13:33:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	yes ?
2009-10-30T13:33:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	see !
2009-10-30T13:37:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Armageddon	you were right, it's a kde issue, but I can't fix it yet :(
2009-10-30T13:38:00.000Z	Armageddon	SunlessHalo	it might be the same problem with KDE, change the driver you are using on KDE into another one
