2009-04-05T19:37:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		krine11: close em?
2009-04-05T19:38:00.000Z	new2ubuntu		u guys keep complaining about helping krine11, can i get some help instead? ive been at this for many hours
2009-04-05T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	elaborate on your question, i have no idea what sort of network connection you have, why you'd need any drivers, and my ability (or not) to help you will depend a huge lot on that.
2009-04-05T19:41:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	can't help you much with wireless here, i've mostly only had wired networks. but what does "sudo iwconfig" show?
2009-04-05T19:43:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	i see. well i don't think i know how to help
2009-04-05T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	no. "basic" is configuring wireless on a card that's *supported* in the first place. making a card that's *not* supported by ubuntu work is hardly basic
2009-04-05T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	which card is that anyway?
2009-04-05T19:45:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	is it a PCI card?
2009-04-05T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	err... is yours a laptop?
2009-04-05T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	is the card internal or external?
2009-04-05T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	then "lspci" should tell you what it's called
2009-04-05T19:47:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	should be easy to figure out which line corresponds to the wifi card
2009-04-05T19:47:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	ok, just pastebin the whole thing
2009-04-05T19:49:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	ah, right... well the bridges aren't the important ones, look for Broadcom, Atheros, or something
2009-04-05T19:54:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	i'm googling it
2009-04-05T19:55:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	on the one hand, i see a bug report about that card not working after a suspend - which would hint to it being supported... but on the other hand, it's never mentioned in the wiki
2009-04-05T19:56:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	doleyb: there's also this forum thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1112464 but i clearly cannot guarantee anything about it
2009-04-05T20:03:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	i don't know what you're saying there - i haven't run the script, and i have no intention to (i prefer not to break my own system, sorry...)
2009-04-05T20:05:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	it's quite possible. that's why i said i couldn't give any guarantees. that's an .sh script, an entirely non-standard way to install stuff
2009-04-05T20:05:00.000Z	LjL	new2ubuntu	using an .sh script to install stuff.
