2009-05-19T00:21:00.000Z	mgmuscari		any recommendations for a good media player with media library/collection support? i'm trying amarok2, but frankly the lack of configuration options is frustrating, as well as the lack of gapless playback
2009-05-19T00:22:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i'd like to try xmms2 but i can't figure out which of the many gui clients to try
2009-05-19T00:23:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	I use xmms1 but I quite liked exaile when I used it.
2009-05-19T00:23:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	been a while since i tried xmms1... does it have good support for media library searching?
2009-05-19T00:23:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	 no media library, just a standard play which is what I want.  try exaile.
2009-05-19T00:23:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	i've been using winamp on this computer for the longest time, but i finally became too fed up with windows and just wiped it
2009-05-19T00:24:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	 xmms is more like winamp than exaile is.
2009-05-19T00:24:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	  but no library
2009-05-19T00:24:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	yeah, i'm looking for something that's similar to winamp 5 rather than winamp 2
2009-05-19T00:25:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	I dont know if winamp would work under wine
2009-05-19T00:25:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	i already tried it... the ui doesn't work too well
2009-05-19T00:25:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	I love winamp, the only thing i miss from windows.
2009-05-19T00:25:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	agreed
2009-05-19T00:30:00.000Z	mgmuscari		hm
2009-05-19T00:31:00.000Z	mgmuscari		well
2009-05-19T00:31:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	winamp lite actually does work fine under wine. winamp full has problems drawing the gui
2009-05-19T00:32:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	ill stick to xmms, super lite and winamp presets are perfect, which is my main need...they dont seem to import very well in other programs.  Audacious gives out high pitched scratchy noise with them, otherwise i`d use that.
2009-05-19T00:33:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	yeah, there doesn't seem to be much of a reason to use winamp lite over xmms :)
2009-05-19T00:33:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	one thing that i definitely miss so far is gapless playback on mp3's
2009-05-19T00:33:00.000Z	deany	mgmuscari	I dont like players that have big windows like amarok/exaile.. Just used to having a winamp like player in corner of screen all the time.
2009-05-19T00:34:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	yeah, i don't like to give up screen real estate either. i pretty much just use this PC as a media center though, and my library has about 27,000 songs in it, so i need something with good media library support
2009-05-19T00:39:00.000Z	mgmuscari	deany	thanks for the help, i'm going to give exaile a try and see if it meets my requirements.
