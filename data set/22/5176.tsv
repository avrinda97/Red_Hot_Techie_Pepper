2012-02-06T22:25:00.000Z	damo22		which text editor lets me select text by columns and not sequentially by rows?
2012-02-06T22:25:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	vim can do that
2012-02-06T22:25:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	how
2012-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	for example i want to highlight a fixed width of text and delete just that text
2012-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	instead of "v" to go into copy mode, do "shift-v"
2012-02-06T22:26:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	if you're doing the whole file you can also use "cut" at the command line to do it
2012-02-06T22:27:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	no thats not quite what im after
2012-02-06T22:27:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	i want to select partial columns of say 10 lines
2012-02-06T22:28:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	did you try with vim? you can highlight a square area by moving up and right to highlight the box you want to delete, then hit "d" to make it disappear
2012-02-06T22:28:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	sort of like highlighting a block of text on the screen and deleting it from the screen
2012-02-06T22:29:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	yeah.. vim does exactly that.. you draw a box, then hit d to delete it
2012-02-06T22:30:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	i cant make it work using shift-v
2012-02-06T22:30:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	bah.. sorry, it's control-v
2012-02-06T22:31:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	THANKS!
2012-02-06T22:31:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	np
2012-02-08T21:28:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	don't feed the troll
2012-02-09T03:03:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	if you learned lvm i think you'd change your tune
2012-02-09T03:04:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	lvm opens a whole world of possibilities that weren't possible back in the 286 days with partition tables on disk
2012-02-09T03:05:00.000Z	damo22	imbezol	i like to know where my data is stored physically so i can recover it when i need to
2012-02-09T03:05:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	i like to have my data in more than one spot
2012-02-09T03:05:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	i don't want to need to recover it
2012-02-09T03:06:00.000Z	imbezol	damo22	anyways.. once you learn it you know exactly where the data is
