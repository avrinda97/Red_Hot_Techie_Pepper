2007-02-17T12:10:00.000Z	slippyr4		is there a gtk-version of sudo ?
2007-02-17T12:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	gksudo
2007-02-17T12:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	Or you could use gksuexec
2007-02-17T12:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	Open a term and run  gksuexec, I thik you'll like it.
2007-02-17T12:13:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	i don't have it installed
2007-02-17T12:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	You don't?
2007-02-17T12:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	Do you have Applications -> System Tools -> Run as different user  ?
2007-02-17T12:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	Yes it is, it's just that the menu item is hidden. You haven't checked it in the alacarte menu editor.
2007-02-17T12:15:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	nope, that menu doesn't exist
2007-02-17T12:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	Are you running Dapper or Edgy with gnome desktop
2007-02-17T12:15:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	edgy
2007-02-17T12:16:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	gnome
2007-02-17T12:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	does this return anything?  which gksuexec
2007-02-17T12:16:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	no, it doesn't (which is how i concluded it wasn't installed)
2007-02-17T12:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	I guess Edgy doesn't install it.. that's too bad, it's a nice little app.
2007-03-03T13:32:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	644
2007-03-03T13:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	Thank you :)
2007-03-04T16:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	I have been using Ubuntu since Warty and have never needed to enable the root account. Any admin tasks you need to do can be done with sudo.
2007-03-13T11:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	gksudo gdmsetup
2007-03-13T11:31:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	tried that, same error, although not (in the console) it says jon is not in the sudoers file
2007-03-13T11:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	slippyr4	Ah, you aren't in the sudoers file.. which means you can't sudo, that is the underlying reason it didn't work.
2007-03-13T11:31:00.000Z	slippyr4	ardchoille	not sure why I am not though. "jon" is the use i created during install, and in fact the only non-root user
