2010-05-03T08:05:00.000Z	steve_	acicula	I can't get the copies to play
2010-05-03T08:06:00.000Z	acicula	steve_	so you cant play dvd's on your computer?

2010-05-03T08:07:00.000Z	steve_	acicula	I can play a dvd, but If I copy the files to the desktop, it won't let me play them, and I can not get them to play at all in handbrake
2010-05-03T08:08:00.000Z	acicula	steve_	ah right, you need to rip the files from dvd
2010-05-03T08:09:00.000Z	steve_	acicula	and i have the libdvdcss file
2010-05-03T08:09:00.000Z	acicula	steve_	which may or may not be legal in your country, but anyway dvdrip, google gave me this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DVD%3A%3ARip which seems a bit dated
2010-05-03T08:10:00.000Z	steve_	acicula	I'm not trying to do anything illegal, I just want to watch my movies I own on my iphone
2010-05-03T08:11:00.000Z	acicula	steve_	im not saying you were, but i dont know much about ripping the video from dvd really, dvdrip ubuntu is just what i punched in on google
2010-05-03T08:12:00.000Z	steve_	acicula	no worries I appreciate all the help :) thanks!!
