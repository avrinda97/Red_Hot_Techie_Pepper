2009-12-01T08:43:00.000Z	tauren		if i want to use software raid1 with lvm on top of it, is it still true that I need a small non-lvm partition for /boot?
2009-12-01T08:43:00.000Z	tauren		that was the case a number of years ago.
2009-12-01T08:45:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	You know much about raid?
2009-12-01T08:46:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	what do you need?  not sure i can help
2009-12-01T08:47:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	short explanation, I have a raid1 setup. I unplugged a hard disk to test redundancy, plugged it back in after booting and testing (shut down when plugged in) and it said degraded array, fine. Re-synced, worked. Rebooted. degraded again. I checked sfdisk, and its not partitioned!. What the heck.
2009-12-01T08:47:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	So I'm assuming I have to re-partition it... how would I go about doing this for a raid1 array?
2009-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	I have some old posts about rebuilding an array
2009-12-01T08:48:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	ahh, sorry i can't help you there...  i'm just trying to figure out how to install raid1
2009-12-01T08:48:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	onto 2 new drives in a new system
2009-12-01T08:49:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	Software?. Centos?. Centos is easy, you can do it in the GUI :) heres a link: http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/linux/linux_software_raid.htm
2009-12-01T08:49:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	yeah, I've done it many times in centos before
2009-12-01T08:49:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	but trying to get raid1/lvm setup on a new system.
2009-12-01T08:49:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	Yeah, thats what im using. I don't know why this isn't re-syncing properly
2009-12-01T08:50:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	its pissing me off since im going to be colocating with 4x500GB RAID10, and yeah.
2009-12-01T08:50:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	if you're on centos, why don't you ask in another channel?
2009-12-01T08:50:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	No support.
2009-12-01T08:50:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	I like ubuntu, but I can only use two distros for WHM/Cpanel.
2009-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	there's a #linux-raid channel, but only 8 people in it.
2009-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	Sunrex	tauren	Oh!. Thank you very much :)
2009-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	tauren	Sunrex	you can check on my blog
