2010-05-19T22:53:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	you will probably need to boot into an Ubuntu (or GParted) LiveCD to make a partition large enough to hold the files from your Wubi installation, by resizing your C: to be that much smaller. E.g. if your partition is NTFS 300 GB and your Wubi files 5 GB, you'd need to resize C: to 295

2010-05-19T22:56:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	you can resize them in GParted... right now? You mean from Wubi or from the GParted LiveCD? (gparted.sourceforge.net)
2010-05-19T22:57:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	a bit of explanation is in order. Your "partition" for Wubi is in fact just a file on Windows, that file having a filesystem of its own. You'll need to extract that "file" into an actual partition and make it bootable.
2010-05-19T22:57:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	From my ubuntu install. Which im logged into right now. ( I have two boot selections at startup win 7 and ubuntu)
2010-05-19T22:57:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	Ok, I got you.
2010-05-19T22:58:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	The Ubuntu install you're using can't edit partitions. It'll only see from within that file. You'll need to boot into a real LiveCD
2010-05-19T22:58:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	ok, so boot into the live CD and make a Partition big enough to hold my wubi files
2010-05-19T22:59:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	hold up, there might be an automatic way to do it. read the instructions carefully, because I don't know if it'll delete data or try to preserve it : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1410208
2010-05-19T22:59:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	ok. Because if it's  just a matter of making a big enough partition i could just boot into windows and use partition magic or something.
2010-05-19T23:00:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	you could do that, yes. here's another thread about this : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=784918
2010-05-19T23:00:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	 haha Glad that u'm not the only one who's made this mistake :)
2010-05-19T23:16:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	are you still here? I was wondering if you knew if it were possible to make my wubi install bigger? It seems like alot of hassle just to remove windows
2010-05-19T23:17:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	Do you have an external hard drive, or at least more storage than the hard drive you're working off of?
2010-05-19T23:18:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	It's much easier to move files around if you can just copy what you want elsewhere, then wipe everything to reinstall just that.
2010-05-19T23:19:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	I don't mind booting from Wubi, problem is my / partition is too small, if I could just make it bigger i'm cool
2010-05-19T23:19:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	I don't know how to do that. Maybe someone else will. (abuayyoub wants to enlarge a Wubi install file)
2010-05-19T23:25:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	Ok, I got it this is much easier that we had hoped. Seems that Wubi has it's own script to migrate to a new partition. Coolness.
2010-05-19T23:26:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	thank you for your help :)
2010-05-19T23:26:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	Ah, didn't know about that. You're welcome
2010-05-20T21:52:00.000Z	abuayyoub	Cynthia	 hello. You helped me yesterday with a problem I was hoping you might be able to help me today. I backed up all my files from a previous install of lucid ( the entire / folder ) what I want to know now is how can I replace my new / folder with the backup ?
2010-05-20T21:53:00.000Z	Cynthia	abuayyoub	Use 'cp -ar /backuppath /rootpath' after mounting your partition containing the backup as /backuppath and the new hard drive which is to contain the backup as /rootpath
