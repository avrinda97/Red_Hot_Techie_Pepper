2007-01-03T13:52:00.000Z	FredDC		I'm a C/C++ developer, can anyone point me to a list of development environments for linux? so i can see which one I'd like to have a look at?
2007-01-03T13:53:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	what's the problem?
2007-01-03T13:53:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	ah, a list of IDEs?
2007-01-03T13:53:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	I can help you, I've been through that road
2007-01-03T13:53:00.000Z	FredDC	blanky	great!
2007-01-03T13:53:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	Let me find you a nice list of them, and then I'll give you my take on them
2007-01-03T13:54:00.000Z	FredDC	blanky	much appreciated!
2007-01-03T13:54:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	Here ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=6762) is a list of what ubuntu users like
2007-01-03T13:55:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	you say you're using C/C++ right? Well, there's Eclipse ( www.eclipse.org ) with the CDT plugin ( http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php )
2007-01-03T13:55:00.000Z	FredDC	blanky	: c/c++ yes. i'll have a look at eclipse
2007-01-03T13:55:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	there's also Anjuta ( http://anjuta.sourceforge.net/ ), as well as KDevelop ( http://www.kdevelop.org/ )
2007-01-03T13:56:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	that will give you the necessary build tools such as gcc (the compiler suite), make, and other stuff
2007-01-03T13:57:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	I personally never have tried Eclipse with CDT in a real world environment, it seemed alright, but the IDE was difficult for me to master, not to mention it wasn't really built for C/C++ programming
2007-01-03T13:57:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	I only tried Anjuta for a while, and I don't really remember. My friend uses it and he seems to like it a lot
2007-01-03T13:58:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	I have tried KDevelop a lot, and I really like it. But it's all personal preference
2007-01-03T13:58:00.000Z	FredDC	blanky	it's a matter of personal taste mostly but at least now i have some names of apps to check out
2007-01-03T13:58:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	not to mention there's a lot more, but those are the most popular as far as I know
2007-01-03T13:59:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	I usually see myself just using something simple as Gedit ( GNOME Text Editor ) or Kate ( KDE Advanced Text Editor ) with terminal gcc/make
2007-01-03T13:59:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	so I suggest you at least get somewhat acquainted with the gcc tools, as well as any other you might be using (make)
2007-01-03T14:00:00.000Z	FredDC	blanky	i was planning on getting to know gcc as well, but i was wondering about an editor
2007-01-03T14:00:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	most IDE's are just that, IDE's, they all typically use gcc
2007-01-03T14:01:00.000Z	blanky	FredDC	gcc is pretty extensive and complicated, I'm not saying learn it all, just enough to survive if you want to do your own little things/edits
