2010-04-30T09:28:00.000Z	Fishscene1		There seems to be a small bug in the Ubuntu AMD64 iso... mainly it won't boot. It is unable to mount /dev/sda(b)(c)(d)(etc..) and just sits there... or goes to a blank screen.
2010-04-30T09:28:00.000Z	Fishscene1		Any ideas?
2010-04-30T09:29:00.000Z	Fishscene1		I was *so* hoping to install Ubuntu on my rig tonight. Has anyone else encountered this problem? I can boot the same ISO in a virtual machine.
2010-04-30T09:30:00.000Z	Fishscene1		oh, one other thing. The VERY first message on the output says something about an error in line 7.
2010-04-30T09:31:00.000Z	Fishscene1		Has anyone had issues booting with the 64-bit edition of 10.04?
2010-04-30T09:32:00.000Z	Fishscene1		FeasabilityStudy: How do I do that?
2010-04-30T09:34:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	if you're on a linux box now, just open the terminal, go to the location where the .iso is.  And then run "sha256sum ubuntu-x86-iso" or whatever the name is..  then compare that hash with the one on the ubuntu site
2010-04-30T09:42:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.04/
2010-04-30T09:42:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	click on the version you have and it will show all MD5's for it.
2010-04-30T09:47:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	check the sha256sum as well, just to make sure
2010-04-30T09:48:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	sha256sum ubuntu-10.04-.iso, etc.
2010-04-30T09:53:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	sha256sum ubuntu-10.04
2010-04-30T09:53:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	post the output here and I will check it for you
2010-04-30T09:58:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	There should be.  You can also try sha1sum
2010-04-30T10:00:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	That is not a good sha256sum.  in other words it dont match..
2010-04-30T10:01:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	SORRY
2010-04-30T10:01:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	Yes, it DOES match..
2010-04-30T10:01:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	I was looking at sha1sum instead of sha256sum.  Sorry.  Yes, that checksum you gave me does match
2010-04-30T10:02:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	Did you install via a CD?  If so, did you verify the CD burned properly?
2010-04-30T10:03:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	Ok, I must have come in after you were asking what your problem was.  What was it again?
2010-04-30T10:12:00.000Z	Fishscene1	FeasibilityStudy	My apologies for what may look like impatience. Did you get my last message?
2010-04-30T10:14:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	Fishscene1	No what was the problem again?
