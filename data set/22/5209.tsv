2007-06-21T15:28:00.000Z	acu		can anyone help me with editing /etc/fstab ? I addedd two hard disks but I still cannot see them automounted when I reboot -
2007-06-21T15:29:00.000Z	persica	acu	if you added two harddisks then you can only mount partitionson those disks.  Do they have file systems on them and are you pointing to the right partition?
2007-06-21T15:31:00.000Z	acu	persica	vox754 can I paste my fstab? can you (want) to look at it ?
2007-06-21T15:36:00.000Z	persica	acu	you don't need the umask on the 40.  You could try it with just defaults.  Do a manual mount: mount /dev/hdc1 /media/HD40
2007-06-21T15:39:00.000Z	persica	acu	alright, you have your partitions wrong it looks like.
2007-06-21T15:39:00.000Z	persica	acu	you'll see /dev/hdc1 is your windows partion (NTFS)
2007-06-21T15:40:00.000Z	persica	acu	and you'll see your largest partition on hdd is of type linux.
2007-06-21T15:40:00.000Z	persica	acu	and you probably don't care about hdd1.
2007-06-21T15:41:00.000Z	acu	persica	I mounted manually the HD40GB it worked
2007-06-21T15:42:00.000Z	persica	acu	you can run just 'mount' to see all the partitions that are mounted and what file systems they are.
2007-06-21T15:44:00.000Z	acu	persica	it shows the HD40GB is ext3  - and now since I mounted manually it worked - I wonder what do I need to change in fstab to automatically mount it when reboot
2007-06-21T15:45:00.000Z	persica	acu	that's hdc1 that's mounted as the 40G?
2007-06-21T15:48:00.000Z	acu	persica	yes, is the HD40GB which I want to mount
2007-06-21T15:49:00.000Z	persica	acu	seems strange that it's mounting as ext3 when your fdisk says it's NTFS.  I'd go with vox on this one.
2007-06-21T15:51:00.000Z	acu	persica	and vox: both the 40GB and 160GB were formated with NTFS before - however I reformated them as ext3
2007-06-21T15:58:00.000Z	persica	acu	so if you unmount it, will the following command mount it? mount -t ext3 /dev/hdc1 /media/HD40GB
2007-06-21T15:59:00.000Z	acu	persica	I mounted before without -t ext3 - should I unmount first ?
2007-06-21T16:00:00.000Z	persica	acu	I just want to test that it works with an ext3 as an explicit mount.  If it does then it should work with a line of '/dev/hdc1   /media/HD40GB   ext3  defaults  0  0'
2007-06-22T16:05:00.000Z	persica	acu	it probably has a gid partition table on there.  I'm not sure how easy it is to convert that to an fdisk layout or how well it works with the kernel.
2007-06-22T16:06:00.000Z	persica	acu	Apple loves to do everything their own way.  At leas they're including ZFS.
2007-06-22T16:09:00.000Z	persica	acu	I don't know of any graphical utilities.  I'm a console jockey.
2007-06-22T16:10:00.000Z	acu	persica	thanks for all your help
