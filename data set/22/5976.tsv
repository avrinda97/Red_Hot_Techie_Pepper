2009-10-03T09:28:00.000Z	pete_		my internet, firefox particularly seems to slow down, not work, go back to full speed and repeat process, my internet works fine on other machines, what could the problem be?/
2009-10-03T09:29:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	are you using wireless?
2009-10-03T09:30:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	yea, but im right next to it
2009-10-03T09:30:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	it could be the wireless driver that you're using causing the problem.
2009-10-03T09:30:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	its the propriatery one from broadcom?
2009-10-03T09:32:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	any idea?
2009-10-03T09:32:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	last time I used that driver, it sucked
2009-10-03T09:33:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	I am unaware of a replacement ?
2009-10-03T09:34:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	I'm not sure if there's a different driver that you can use - maybe the Windows driver using ndiswrapper
2009-10-03T09:34:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	would that not give me worse performance?
2009-10-03T09:35:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	I've never had a problem
2009-10-03T09:36:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	can you tell me how to do that?
2009-10-03T09:45:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	ok, done going to reboot
2009-10-03T09:45:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	do i need to reboot or is there a command
2009-10-03T09:46:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	did you follow the setup steps to load ndiswrapper at boot?  if so, you're done, and should reboot to ensure that the module loads at boot
2009-10-03T09:47:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	what step was that
2009-10-03T09:48:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	adding "ndiswrapper" to the bottom of the file /etc/modules
2009-10-03T09:49:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	ok, brb
2009-10-03T11:19:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	you still there, LOL
2009-10-03T11:19:00.000Z	firecrotch	pete_	yes I am
2009-10-03T11:20:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	haha, NDIS wrapper was a nightmare. could not get on irc. only browse the web
2009-10-03T11:20:00.000Z	pete_	firecrotch	so back to the propriatery I guess.
