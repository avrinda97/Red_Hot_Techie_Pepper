2010-05-29T07:50:00.000Z	Ken1		Drake2k: Thanks for the update too. I'm going to try and install it now too.
2010-05-29T07:50:00.000Z	Ken1		I also like to repeat the word "too"
2010-05-29T07:52:00.000Z	Ken1		!virtualbox | rallias
2010-05-29T07:52:00.000Z	Ken1		Rallias: Yes, you can try dual booting.
2010-05-29T07:52:00.000Z	Ken1		!dual boot | rallias
2010-05-29T07:53:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	u there?
2010-05-29T07:55:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	how do i tell my computer to permanently run the cpu at 2GHZ USERSPACE from boot even when running battery?
2010-05-29T07:56:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	Good question and i'm just not sure. I know you can add an applet on the taskbar for setting CPU throttling/usage.
2010-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	I thought the applet on the taskbar would lock the frequency.
2010-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	not for amd chips.
2010-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-904748.html Might be soe use.
2010-05-29T08:00:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	at least not the RM-70
2010-05-29T08:19:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	RM stands for "remove" - used improperly you can delete all sorts of files and folders.
2010-05-29T08:19:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	so like s*do rm <directory>
2010-05-29T08:20:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	It's pretty useful too, though. (please do NOT issue the following command) rm -rf / will remove forceably your entire root directory, effectively meaning you'll need to do a full reinstall.
2010-05-29T08:21:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	i dont feel like deleting my root directory, but what's the "-rf" switch for?
2010-05-29T08:22:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	so if a process or kernel is using anything it tells it to f**k off and it deletes it anyway?
2010-05-29T08:25:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	when ubuntu's appearance control app loads the little thumbnails of each theme, does it get them from /usr/share/themes?
2010-05-29T08:26:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	I'm actually not too sure. I think it does take it from one of the configuration files in the folder.
2010-05-29T08:29:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	I'm not sure why that is. Maybe you need to add them to a .themes folder in your home directory?
2010-05-29T08:30:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	Ken1	what if i want them availible to all users? im the only one on this computer, but this is somethign ill remember. i have anotehr computer with multiple users.
2010-05-29T08:33:00.000Z	Ken1	linux_is_my_hero	Normally themes are packaged and you install them through the "Appearance" window, where they're then copied into the right directory. I think it might just be the home directory, though.  Sometimes themes don't appear if they're not properly made, e.g. some of the description files are missing. I think that  file might be the "gtkrc" file
