2005-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	trigger_ph		anyone? i tried to make a launcher for a bash script but it doesn't run as expected..i get no visible output
2005-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	you probably need the launcher to specify "run in terminal"
2005-10-06T09:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	or make the command for instance " gnome-terminal -e <yourdcript> "
2005-10-06T09:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	s/dcript/script
2005-10-06T10:00:00.000Z	trigger_ph	thoreauputic	what does the last one do? s/dcript/script ?
2005-10-06T10:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	oh sorry I was correcting my typo :)
2005-10-06T10:01:00.000Z	trigger_ph	thoreauputic	ah..ok
2005-10-06T10:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	gnome-terminal -e <name of scipt >
2005-10-06T10:02:00.000Z	trigger_ph	thoreauputic	i'm assuming if gnome-terminal is used as an argument for the command, the "run in terminal" check box must be unchecked..
2005-10-06T10:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	you can make any command run in a terminal by saying " xterm -e command" or whatever
2005-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	probably - haven't tried it
2005-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	I ususally jsut say " aterm -e <mycommand> "
2005-10-06T10:04:00.000Z	trigger_ph	thoreauputic	the script actually calls /usr/local/java/bin/java foo.jar
2005-10-06T10:04:00.000Z	trigger_ph	thoreauputic	and it works fine if i run that from the terminal. i just need a launcher on the desktop to do the same..
2005-10-06T10:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	should work then, as discussed - try it and see
2005-10-06T10:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	would it not be ... java -jar foo.jar ? (I'm not a java person)
2005-10-06T10:07:00.000Z	trigger_ph	thoreauputic	the docs tell me to just do a java foo.jar. i'm not a java person too. hehe. anyway, it still doesn't launch the app. it does open a terminal though and closes it immediately thereafter
2005-10-06T10:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	would it not be easier to just make a symlink to that path or add it to your path ?
2005-10-06T10:09:00.000Z	trigger_ph	thoreauputic	oh..so an absolute path to the script in the command text box won't work? anyway, i'll try the symlink and see if it does..
2005-10-06T10:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	an absolute path should work, yes
2005-10-06T10:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	you didn't leave out the -e before your command. I hope?
2005-10-06T10:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	trigger_ph	oh - did you give the right pathe to your foo.jar?
