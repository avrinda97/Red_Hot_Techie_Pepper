2007-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	Undead_Zeus		How do I compile a c/c++ project in KDevelop?
2007-12-03T08:17:00.000Z	Undead_Zeus		Apparently I need to make a makefile, but i don't know how to do that. Surely there is an option that lets me do that
2007-12-03T08:19:00.000Z	Undead_Zeus		I use KDevelop, how do I use KDevelop to create a makefile for a c/c++ project?
2007-12-03T08:21:00.000Z	Undead_Zeus		Does anyone here use KDevelop??
2007-12-03T08:22:00.000Z	Undead_Zeus		1124 people and no one has ever used KDevelop for c++/c?
2007-12-03T08:23:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	if someone did, and could answer your question then would Undead_Zeus
2007-12-03T09:24:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	you need to install the libsdl.h packages then I think you need to include "SDL/SDL.h" not just "SDL.h" or vice versa, I forget
2007-12-03T09:26:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	the libsdl-dev package?
2007-12-03T09:27:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	did you try my suggestiong of changing the includes from "SDL.h" to "SDL/SDL.h"?
2007-12-03T09:28:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	or the sdl forums / mailing lists
2007-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	or you solved your first problem
2007-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	I have no experience with KDevelop so good luck
2007-12-03T09:31:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	you're problem now probably has to do with configuring your KDevelop project to include the libsdl library, libsdl1.2-dev depends on the main library
2007-12-03T09:32:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	it's all part of learning how to program in c/c++
2007-12-03T09:40:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	by autotools did you mean Kdevelop and IDE's in general?
2007-12-03T09:40:00.000Z	Undead_Zeus	kelsin	i just meant the package thing i got...automake or something of the sort
2007-12-03T09:41:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	you might be better off using gcc on the command line
2007-12-03T09:42:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	since KDevelop and all others on linux normally use them anyway
2007-12-03T09:42:00.000Z	Undead_Zeus	kelsin	i like kdevelop, it has some nifty features
2007-12-03T09:42:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	just pointing it out, since the problems you've come here with are common things to learn about when using the toolchain yourself
2007-12-03T09:43:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	the tools used, gcc, ld, etc
2007-12-03T09:44:00.000Z	kelsin	Undead_Zeus	KDevelop and most other gnubased IDEs all use those on the back end
