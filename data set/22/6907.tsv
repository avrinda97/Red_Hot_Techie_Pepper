2009-08-14T21:16:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	it happened to apple
2011-04-12T23:59:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	dpkg -P packagename    <-- might work
2011-04-12T23:59:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	but which one
2011-04-12T23:59:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	oh, you dont know which one is missing a dep?
2011-04-12T23:59:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	I dunno, when I try to apt-get install it says run apt-get -f
2011-04-13T00:00:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	what does the -f one tell you?
2011-04-13T00:00:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	it says to install a bunch of stuff
2011-04-13T00:01:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	it says to install a bunch of stuff
2011-04-13T00:01:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	can you pastebin it?
2011-04-13T00:02:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	http://paste.ubuntu.com/593258/
2011-04-13T00:03:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	whats wrong with letting it finish? did you decide you eont want whetever you were trying to install? if so, the package to purge would be the one you were trying to install thats trying to pull all this in
2011-04-13T00:03:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	it doesn't have internet, so I want to remove whatever is giving this error
2011-04-13T00:03:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	ooooh
2011-04-13T00:03:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	ok, so what did you try to install ?
2011-04-13T00:04:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	it's not my system or I would know obviously....  I copied over a .deb package I want to install but I can't now because it's f'd up.  so how do I find out what package is telling me to run -f install
2011-04-13T00:04:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	are you sure its not the deb package?
2011-04-13T00:04:00.000Z	hwilde	maco	yes....  how do I find out what package is causing it to suggest running apt-get install -f
2011-04-13T00:04:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	like maybe it depends on that stuff thats listed and so cant get installed because no internet
2011-04-13T00:05:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	aptitude why <name of one of the packages in the list>      could tell you what's depending on it, if aptitude is installed
2011-04-13T00:06:00.000Z	maco	hwilde	sudo less /var/log/apt/term.log could show you output from previous uses of apt to see what was interrupted
