2009-12-01T20:10:00.000Z	donita_		First I install Ubuntu then Mint, the Menu goes to control by Mint at first, then somehow I update Ubuntu with about 100MB stuff, then I reboot, then I found Ubuntu took over the boot Menu again, which was FINE to me (I don't know who takes the control of boot Menu, if they can work, I can choose between them, who control it doesn't matter much to me) but when Windows 7 came alone, then everything is gone, There will be ONLY windows 7 o
2009-12-01T20:10:00.000Z	donita_		n system when booting up, NO MENU, no nothing.
2009-12-01T20:12:00.000Z	donita_		so, I follow the instructions from Ubuntu  Documentation
2009-12-01T20:12:00.000Z	donita_		followed
2009-12-01T20:12:00.000Z	donita_		and I made it!!
2009-12-01T20:12:00.000Z	donita_		so.... the problem now, is how do I add windows 7 onto my boot up Menu?
2009-12-01T20:13:00.000Z	donita_		Is there anything I should know before I read the link?
2009-12-01T20:15:00.000Z	donita_		Yup! jongbergs, after installing win7, the grub menu had gone, nothing appears, booting up turned out goes into Windows 7 directly, no menu, so Windows 7 is MENU KILLER
2009-12-01T20:16:00.000Z	donita_		but I saved it by many commands which is Ubuntu Documentation told me to. It was really big help
2009-12-01T20:18:00.000Z	donita_		reinstall grub, but I think grub is doing all right.... because windows 7 was the last OS I installed, maybe that's why grub didn't notice it?
