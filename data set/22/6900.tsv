2012-03-09T16:50:00.000Z	api984		does anyone know how to use postfix RELOCATED maps maybe. i got some users internal and some on ISP on same domain. so internal can't send to external users
2012-03-09T16:51:00.000Z	api984		550 users does not exist in virtual mailbox maps....
2012-03-09T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	sounds like your user does not map to the user in the map file
2012-03-09T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	not sure if thats the 550 error user, or a user with a uid of 550
2012-03-09T16:51:00.000Z	api984		error 550
2012-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	user does not exist in maps
2012-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	ok, so look in the map file
2012-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	thats corrent
2012-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	map is over ldap
2012-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	ok, so is the user in the map
2012-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	user that is not in the map uses ISP mailbox
2012-03-09T16:52:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	no
2012-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	so surly that is the problem....user is not in map, error, user is not in map
2012-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	user MUST not be in virtual mailbox map
2012-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia		or am I missunderstanding
2012-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	can transport map do transport for pecific user
2012-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	if the user is not in the virtual mailbox map, it must have a physical account with a FQDN pointing at it
2012-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	I don't think you can set a map for a specific user, I'm not %100 though
2012-03-09T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	the guys in #postfix may be %100 certain
2012-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	guys at #postfix are idleing
2012-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	api984	give them time, they are good, they do get back to you
2012-03-09T16:54:00.000Z	api984	ikonia	will wait
