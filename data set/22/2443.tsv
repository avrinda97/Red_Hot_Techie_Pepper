2010-06-25T16:01:00.000Z	e-DIO-t		hi there: got a problem on mounting an nfs partition on boot. the fstab file works [proof giving mount -a], but on boot it doesn't want to work. Any idea?!
2010-06-25T16:02:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	can you check your syslog and look for errors?
2010-06-25T16:02:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	I think I have similar issues with other services
2010-06-25T16:38:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	by default you are not allowed to connect to nfs mounts as root (as that would give the client "full" access on the export)
2010-06-25T16:38:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	did you run mount -a as a regular user or as root?
2010-06-25T16:38:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	nosquashroot should fix that
2010-06-25T16:40:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	check your syslogs (on both servers) .... it will probably give some indication
2010-06-25T16:42:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	can you paste your /etc/exports somewhere ?
2010-06-25T16:42:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	together with the ips of both boxes and the /etc/fstab
2010-06-25T16:43:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	it's been several years since I worked with nfs and there were some snags, but overall it was quite straight forward
2010-06-25T16:45:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	it is on the nfs server
2010-06-25T16:50:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	candyban	btw http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/454944/
2010-06-25T16:51:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	candyban	and, yes, the twos are allowed to access the nfs share :)
2010-06-25T16:52:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	nosquashroot is for nfs server ... can you paste your /etc/exports file as well?
2010-06-25T16:53:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	?
2010-06-25T16:53:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	it's not a linux/unix box?
2010-06-25T16:56:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	were you running "mount -a" as a regular user or as root?
2010-06-25T16:58:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	have you checked syslog for errors?
2010-06-25T16:59:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	can you the following question: as which user did you run "mount -a" ?
2010-06-25T17:01:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	wow ... you're going to mount everything every time you open a shell ?
2010-06-25T17:01:00.000Z	candyban	e-DIO-t	you can try adding it in /etc/rc.local (with perhaps a sleep 5 in front of it)
2010-06-25T17:02:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	candyban	gonna try :P
