2007-07-23T16:09:00.000Z	_`XeOn_		how to burn an .iso image in ubuntu???
2007-07-23T16:09:00.000Z	_`XeOn_		cd
2007-07-23T16:10:00.000Z	_`XeOn_		i put the cd in and it gets mounted but i try to burn image on it and it gave me errors and doesnt burn
2007-07-23T16:11:00.000Z	_`XeOn_		is anyways to install the drivers for my cd-wr?
2007-07-23T16:12:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	if it is mounted then some programs dont let you burn, so unmount it... the drivers are autoimatically installed...
2007-07-23T16:17:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	if it is mounted somewhere then  sudo umount /MOUNT/POINT
2007-07-23T16:40:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	that ill be hard couse AFAIK it is compiled in to the kernel
2007-07-23T16:44:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	i dont think that will hepl... but alternatively you can reinstall the kernel
2007-07-23T16:46:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	what errormessage do you get?
2007-07-23T16:46:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	hat program do you use?
2007-07-23T16:47:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	do you have a file /dev/cdrw ?
2007-07-23T16:47:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	no cdrw ?
2007-07-23T16:48:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	what kind of cdrw?
2007-07-23T16:52:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	thats ok... but what is the type of it? plextor? Lg? sony?
2007-07-23T16:52:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	and the id?
2007-07-23T16:54:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	maybe take a look on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus-cd-burner/+bug/11886
2007-07-23T16:56:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	it is also worth a look in the disk admin ... that it does it show as a cdrw or just a cdrom
2007-07-23T16:58:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	so it the circle on the info page of CDRW is red?
2007-07-23T16:59:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	thats a problem.. it is a normal IDE drive?
2007-07-23T05:00:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	what then?
2007-07-23T05:01:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	hmm i have a backup idea...
2007-07-23T05:01:00.000Z	nikin	_`XeOn_	is your nick registered?
