2009-11-04T16:20:00.000Z	reni__		hey guys! Can anyone tell me how to get my networking icon back on my taskbar?
2009-11-04T16:22:00.000Z	reni__		How can I start the network manager?
2009-11-04T16:22:00.000Z	reni__		guys how can I start the network manager from terminal?
2009-11-04T16:23:00.000Z	reni__		nice
2009-11-04T16:23:00.000Z	reni__		very very nice split there...
2009-11-04T16:23:00.000Z	reni__		Nope, server split + autojoin ;-)
2009-11-04T16:24:00.000Z	reni__		maybe - I haven't used irc for a while - back in my days this used to happen when servers splitted ;-)

2009-11-04T16:24:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	thanks
2009-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	I get an error when I type nm-applet
2009-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	rblst	reni__	it's already running then
2009-11-04T16:26:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	I need to get my icon in the taskbar somehow... my girlfriend did something and it disappeared without a trace ;-) Besides the laptop doesn't seem to have any wifi scanning done at all since the icon disappeared - I think she did more than hiding the icon \
2009-11-04T16:27:00.000Z	rblst	reni__	add notification area to the panel, she may have removed it
2009-11-04T16:28:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	how do I do that? I'm not that familiar with Ubuntu yet...
2009-11-04T16:28:00.000Z	rblst	reni__	right click the panel, add to panel
2009-11-04T16:29:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	when I right-click on the task bar and click "Add to panel" I get a list of programs, but nothing about networking...
2009-11-04T16:29:00.000Z	rblst	reni__	search for notification area, see if it is already on panel
2009-11-04T16:30:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	ah thanks! Could you tell me how to enable wifi searching?
2009-11-04T16:30:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	it seems that I won't be needing the last one - it's already working. Thanks a lot for the help provided
2009-11-04T16:30:00.000Z	rblst	reni__	welcome
2009-11-04T16:32:00.000Z	rblst	reni__	if you right click on something placed on a panel, you can lock it to the panel, that way it is harder to remove it
2009-11-04T16:33:00.000Z	reni__	rblst	already did that to prevent further investigations ;-) thanks though
