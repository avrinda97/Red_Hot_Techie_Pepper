2009-06-05T22:53:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna		anyone?
2009-06-05T22:54:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	what does "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/STORAGE" say?
2009-06-05T22:58:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	what does "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/STORAGE" say?
2009-06-05T22:59:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	fuse: failed to access mountpoint /media/STORAGE: No such file or directory
2009-06-05T22:59:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	"mkdir /media/STORAGE" and then "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/STORAGE"
2009-06-05T23:01:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	ok that mounted it
2009-06-05T23:01:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	"umount /media/STORAGE" and your fstab should work now
2009-06-05T23:02:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	I think maybe i didnt make the directory STORAGE that's why right?
2009-06-05T23:02:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	100% correct ;)
2009-06-05T23:02:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	lol yeah i thought it would make it itself :P thanks for the help
2009-06-05T23:03:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	easy to miss if you're used to hotplug ;)
2009-06-05T23:03:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	yeah thanks :D
2009-06-05T23:05:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	would u happen to also know the difference between xclient script and gnome?
2009-06-05T23:06:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	gnome is a desktop environment and xclient script sounds like a script
2009-06-05T23:07:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	lol yeah i know gnome the thing is my login is set to startup as xclient script yet it starts up as gnome that's why i was wondering why xclient script starts gnome
2009-06-05T23:08:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	at the login screen you can choose which session to use (default, gnome, last used, etc) maybe that can help ?
2009-06-05T23:09:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	yeah im just wondering like the default is set to xclient script yet it starts with gnome ;)
2009-06-05T23:16:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	/usr/share/icons or something like that
2009-06-06T00:22:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	i already got him covered on that :P
2009-06-06T00:23:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	mib_l0x28fna	was afk for a while, didn't follow ;)
2009-06-06T00:23:00.000Z	mib_l0x28fna	Sh3r1ff	yeah np
