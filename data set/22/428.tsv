2011-10-12T15:33:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	this normally happens if you resize the terminal while a curses prog is running; pressing ctl+l would force redraw
2011-10-12T15:34:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	i need to redraw all the time, xterms used to run for months without any glitches, and it has never been resized
2011-10-12T15:35:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	happens with ls as well
2011-10-12T15:35:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	but thanks, was just trying to find out if anyone knows this problem :)
2011-10-12T15:35:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	did you set non-standard geometry of xterm somewhere?
2011-10-12T15:36:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	don't think so... i forgot the location/name of the X11 resource file though
2011-10-12T15:38:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	app-defaults/XTerm seems to be unmaimed :)
2011-10-12T15:39:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	you could poke inside Edit->Profile Preferences in the Xterm menu
2011-10-12T15:40:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	hm? i am talking about /usr/bin/xterm, i don't know of a Edit function in the xterm menus reached via Ctrl+leftclick/ rightclick :)
2011-10-12T15:40:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	oh ok; i was imagining the GNome Terminal :)
2011-10-12T15:41:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	no i can't stand that one :)
2011-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	i will probably start by turning compiz visual effects off, right?
2011-10-12T15:44:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	sure; or try starting xterm with different -geometry values
2011-10-12T15:44:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	i think it's not the geometry
2011-10-12T15:44:00.000Z	flummy	phlak_user	happened to other xterms with other geometrys as well
2011-10-12T15:45:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	sure
2011-10-12T16:18:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	you the "man" :)
2011-10-12T16:31:00.000Z	phlak_user	flummy	i havent had an issue (but i could not be a typical user)
