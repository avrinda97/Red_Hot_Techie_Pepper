2011-09-03T00:05:00.000Z	rbookhouse		Anyone here got RTCW or ET working on 11.04 _with_ perfect sound?
2011-09-03T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	what is RTCW and what is ET ?
2011-09-03T00:05:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	if you had them you'd know :P but they're games.
2011-09-03T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	please don't initialise non-standard things, it makes support near  impossible
2011-09-03T00:06:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	I'll initialise what I like
2011-09-03T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	if they are windows games, did you check the appdb?
2011-09-03T00:06:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	please stop trying to help now and give someone else a chance
2011-09-03T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	fine, but nobody will have any idea what you are talking about, needing then for further clarification. You choice.  You can give full details and GET support, or initialize "what you like" and get nowhere. Your choice
2011-09-03T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	essentially, check the appdb for wine
2011-09-03T00:07:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	it is, well done, good bye
2011-09-03T00:08:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	and that just proves you have no idea, these are not windows games
2011-09-03T00:08:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	done yet?
2011-09-03T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	if you give what they ACTUALLY are, we can help
2011-09-03T00:09:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	if you had either game you'd be able to help - otherwise you can not... It is just that simple.  And if you had those games you'd know what RTCW and ET is.
2011-09-03T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	fine, struggle away. If you want help then please give details. I doubt anyone will give any help as you aren't being co-operative. I have asked nicely.
2011-09-03T00:10:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	And I have asked equally as nicely for you to simply dtop it
2011-09-03T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	you got it
2011-09-03T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	if you get no answer and want to enlighten me, I'm ready to help
2011-10-01T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	you can set the default in /etc/default/grub  but you will need to chroot to change it back again so you can boot the OS (messy) do you not have a USB keyboard handy?
2011-10-01T19:34:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	no i don't have any other keybs at the moment
2011-10-01T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rbookhouse	its doable, just messy
2011-10-01T19:35:00.000Z	rbookhouse	ActionParsnip	well I know I can chroot from any old livecd/usb - (not the first time I've done that) - but was after something simpler
