2011-08-24T14:30:00.000Z	bundai		is there anyone who can help me!
2011-08-24T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	you haven't given any detail, so presently no
2011-08-24T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	afaik, if they have write access they will be abe to delete. Don't bother with the caps next time, we can read lower case just as easily
2011-08-24T14:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	I'd ask in #samba
2011-08-24T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	as well as I need, yes
2011-08-24T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	I can give you my smb.conf file, it shows how I control access
2011-08-24T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	http://paste.ubuntu.com/673714/   shares are at the bottom
2011-08-24T14:59:00.000Z	bundai	ActionParsnip	!!I think yesterday you gave it me !is it yours http://pastebin.com/aLMgFYac
2011-08-24T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	yeah, I have access to both shares but Leanne can't touch my stuff :)
2011-08-24T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	you will need to run:  sudo smbpasswd -a somename    to make samba authentication
2011-08-24T15:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	may help http://beginlinux.com/blog/2010/01/create-a-public-share-on-samba/
2011-08-24T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	make a user and force the owner to be the user, you could even set the smbpasswd for the new user so you can control who accesses it
2011-08-24T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	my bad, long week
2011-08-24T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	i'd just keep hammering #samba
2011-08-24T15:10:00.000Z	bundai	ActionParsnip	!!then guide me I am new to that
2011-08-24T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	/join #samba    will get you to the channel
2011-08-24T15:12:00.000Z	bundai	ActionParsnip	!!thank you for your suggestion May I know do you have any idea about dlna server in ubuntu
2011-08-24T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	ushare seems to be an option
2011-08-26T12:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	you can use dropbox...
2011-08-26T12:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bundai	https://www.dropbox.com/help/137
