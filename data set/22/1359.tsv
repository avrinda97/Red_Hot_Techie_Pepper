2011-01-12T00:02:00.000Z	Failican		How do I reinstall the network cards drives?
2011-01-12T00:03:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	what is the problem you are trying to solve
2011-01-12T00:04:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	my network card BCM4312 stopped working when I was trying to update it but I already had the latest drives
2011-01-12T00:05:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	what did you do precisely when you say updating?
2011-01-12T00:06:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	first I did sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source then I saw it was the newest already so I tried someone here told me that I should try b43 drives sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter
2011-01-12T00:07:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	and when did it stop working?
2011-01-12T00:09:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	dont think you should install b43-fwcutter anymore, it appears to be longer used
2011-01-12T00:09:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	after I also tried to inactivate the current drive and then activate it in system>administration>hardware drives. then I rebooted
2011-01-12T00:11:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	okey so how do i do to remove the b43-fwcutter?
2011-01-12T00:11:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	nvm seems it is still used, just the original page is no longer  maintained
2011-01-12T00:11:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	okey.. hmm i shouldnt have started fixing with my drives in the first place it work so fine befor :P
2011-01-12T00:12:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	what did you "fix", the procedure appears to be to isntall fwcutter, let it fetch firmware and reboot and it should be working
2011-01-12T00:12:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	err reboot and then activate the new drivers in hardware drivers
2011-01-12T00:12:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	I dont understand why the local network works, i can use ssh from my current computer and i can ping the ubuntu computer its just internet thats crashed
2011-01-12T00:14:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	hmm sry but I dont know what you mean with "err reboot" :S
2011-01-12T00:14:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	you are not making any sense, if you can access your system via the ntework then your wireless is not broken
2011-01-12T00:14:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	but I cant access internet just local i cant for example use irc or anything thats outside the local network
2011-01-12T00:18:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	if you cant access the internet but you can access the local network your network configuration settings are incorrect or your gateway is blocking you
2011-01-12T00:19:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	yeh, could be so but I didnt change anything on the gateway
2011-01-12T00:23:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	I'll try to reboot my gateway, might do it. Thanks anyways!
2011-01-12T00:24:00.000Z	acicula_	Failican	check your network settings on your laptop that you set the gateway properly and dns servers
2011-01-12T00:26:00.000Z	Failican	acicula_	yeh i have checked that and the pass is correct and all other things are on auto as they where befor
