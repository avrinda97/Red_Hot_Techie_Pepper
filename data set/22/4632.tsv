2008-05-09T10:30:00.000Z	koshari		mimi change the input in your mixer
2008-05-09T10:30:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 ... how do I do that? Not too sure what you mean
2008-05-09T10:32:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	I see "Input Source" And I have 2 options. Mic and  Front Mic ....
2008-05-09T10:34:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	... i dont know what they mean thoguh... theres Capture and Digital under the RECORDING  tab, and those
2008-05-09T10:35:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 do you know what Capture and Digital  ... "channels?" are?
2008-05-09T10:36:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 i read the help files but they look very very outdated....
2008-05-09T10:37:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 this is in volume control like you told me
2008-05-09T10:38:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 yes I know, the only application that looks simple enoguh for me to use is  Sound Recorder, but as I was saying I need to understand what Capture and Digital   means, so I know which "channel" I need to use to record, no?
2008-05-09T10:40:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 I have no idea what that means..... *faints* xD!! Okay
2008-05-09T10:42:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 well there's Capture Mux (Yes, MUX) ... but when i go to volume control it Capture Mux is in  Playback, not Recording tab
2008-05-09T10:46:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 if I use Capture (not mux)   it doesnt crash, and it records, but i hear static as if was my mic detecting random sounds)
2008-05-09T10:47:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 those are the only 3
2008-05-09T10:49:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 there's no mic slider. Theres : TAB:Playback:Sliders: Master, PCM, Capture Mux.  TAB:Recording:Sliders:Capture, Digital.  TAB: Options: Input Source: Mic or Front Mic (no sliders for either)
2008-05-09T10:50:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 PCM mmmm okay, so I ... there's only a mute button for it,  and if I mute it, I can no longer hear  anything on my computer. its like that, right?
2008-05-09T10:52:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 yes, its alsa  (i went to Preferences/Sound
2008-05-09T10:53:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 Mmmm... Ok. I X out everything except Master and PCM.  so when I go to sound recorder, what will I pick under Record From Input? :P
2008-05-09T10:54:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 it was Capture. But I muted it, remember?  Now it makes no noise at all
2008-05-09T10:55:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 they ARE unmuted, but in sound recorded I MUST select a source, and the one that doesntt crash is Capture, which you have told me to mute :p
2008-05-09T10:55:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 so if I go and select capture as input, it automatically unmutes it.
2008-05-09T10:57:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 yes i have, but when i fnish and tell it to play, nothing was recorded,,,
2008-05-09T10:59:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 PCM should be my source? WEll I thought so at first but sound recorder doesnt give it to me as a source
2008-05-09T11:00:00.000Z	Mimi	koshari	 could you explain "then in the mixer you select the source" ?
