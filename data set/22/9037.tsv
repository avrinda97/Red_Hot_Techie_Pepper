2005-03-30T10:15:00.000Z	madstop		is kubuntu always going to be called kubuntu?  Seems like kind of a lazy thing to call it, and somehow unfair to the word "ubuntu".  Just my opinion...
2005-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	madstop		Here are some nice examples of svg wallpaper-- cool how it scales -- http://www.volvoguy.net/ubuntu/
2005-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	madstop		and with transparency!
2005-03-30T10:18:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	yeah someone on kde-apps has added a true transparency patch for kde to work with x.org
2005-03-30T10:29:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	the live CD uses the FOSS nv driver
2005-03-30T10:29:00.000Z	madstop	linux_galore	wow, xfce can do that?  Do you know if xfce 4+ would also work on so little memory?
2005-03-30T10:30:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	XFCE runs on 32mb machine fine.....I used to run xfce on a 16mb machine
2005-03-30T10:30:00.000Z	madstop	linux_galore	sorry, but I'm too inexperienced to appreciate the driver distinctions to which you're referring
2005-03-30T10:31:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	the nv driver isnt the official nvidia driver but I found it works fine from tnt2 -> fx5900 cards that Ive used
2005-03-30T10:31:00.000Z	madstop	linux_galore	I really liked what I saw of xfce  -- have to try it again.  And I'm throwing together some computer odds and ends from years ago, so I'll try it on those
2005-03-30T10:51:00.000Z	madstop	linux_galore	I really really doubt that 53% figure.  More like 25%
2005-03-30T10:53:00.000Z	madstop	linux_galore	hunting down firefox extensions, which tend to stop working with new releases, is not my favorite use of time.  Opera has a lot of great features.
2005-03-30T10:53:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	nope 53%....that figure was thrown out by one of the worlds leading dialect specialists he has even written a language just to be able to correctly speak any given dialect
2005-03-30T10:54:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	I have mouse zooming.......and Opera doesnt have "nuke everything"
2005-03-30T10:55:00.000Z	madstop	linux_galore	I'm sorry, but this makes no sense to me.  The Chinese are one-fifth of the world's population, with overseas Chinese, you can maybe bump that up to one-fourth, but not more than half speaking these "dialects" -- which often are more accurately called languages.
2005-03-30T10:55:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	nuke everything - extension in Firefox is great when you get pages not formated for printing you just click on everything you want removed
2005-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	you forget many other countries are tied to the Chinese dialect
2005-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	Japan for one
2005-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	your just counting the "100%" chinese dialects you not also counting those dialtect thats derive from one of the chinese dialects
2005-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	madstop	linux_galore	good lord, the Japanese speak Japanese.
2005-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	yes study Japanese you will often see a historical reference for words back to a chinese dialect
2005-03-30T11:02:00.000Z	linux_galore	madstop	yes english has become a bit like the mongrel dialect from hell
