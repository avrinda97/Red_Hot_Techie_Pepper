2009-12-25T01:12:00.000Z	Sofia		I am trying to install 9.10. I have a dual boot XP/8.10 and I formatted the ubuntu partition. I am now running 9.10 live cd. At the "prepare disk space" screen it says "This computer has no operating system on it." Why?
2009-12-25T01:14:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	is your hard disk recognized?
2009-12-25T01:14:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	yes
2009-12-25T01:15:00.000Z	epinky		Sofia:can you see your partitions?
2009-12-25T01:15:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	if I select "Specify partitions manually", I can see all of them
2009-12-25T01:17:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	MBR was not cleaned ? I mean, can you boot as usually, right?
2009-12-25T01:18:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	I think so. I just formatted the ubuntu partition using gparted live cd
2009-12-25T01:19:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	can you reboot and try?, just to make sure MBR was not touched
2009-12-25T01:19:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	ok, trying now...
2009-12-25T01:23:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	Strange! I can still boot in ubuntu and in XP!
2009-12-25T01:24:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	can you explain to me what you want to do?
2009-12-25T01:25:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	I want to install Karmic from scratch AND still be able to dual-boot in XP
2009-12-25T01:26:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	Btw, ubuntu doesn't really boot, it just shows the loading screen. WHich means that boot sector is ok, right?
2009-12-25T01:27:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	yep, but GRUB v1 is on it, Karmic uses Grub2
2009-12-25T01:29:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	I was told that I should be able to do what I want without messing with grub. Grub2 will be automatically installed. Or not?
2009-12-25T01:30:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	maybe that's the problem, I suggest you to "fixmbr" (clean GRUB from MBR, and restore XP NT-loader) and retry runnin LiveCD
2009-12-25T01:32:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	can you explain a bit more, please? Do I just run fixmbr from command line or what?
2009-12-25T01:34:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	that's Windows stuff, I think there's Rescue Mode in XP where you can restore mbr issuing fixmbr command, maybe you can find more help on ho to restore MBR in ##windows channel
2009-12-25T01:36:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	Does it matter that I have a separate boot partition?
2009-12-25T01:37:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	you want a fresh install and you are using XP then I guess it does not matter
2009-12-25T01:37:00.000Z	Sofia	epinky	ok, ty!
2009-12-25T01:38:00.000Z	epinky	Sofia	np
