2006-07-24T16:54:00.000Z	SlyFly		I am trying to install an application via Wine, and it's asking me which location to install it to...do I install it in my Windows partition or Ubuntu?  It doesn't make sense
2006-07-24T16:54:00.000Z	SlyFly		GrueLova, download it from Synaptic
2006-07-24T16:55:00.000Z	SlyFly		GueLOVA, it's what I do...I am a nice person...:)
2006-07-24T16:56:00.000Z	SlyFly		Who/what is Ubotu?
2006-07-24T16:56:00.000Z	SlyFly		What is Ubotu?
2006-07-24T16:56:00.000Z	SlyFly		santa, okay..thanks
2006-07-24T16:57:00.000Z	SlyFly		I am trying to install an application via Wine, and it's asking me which location to install it to...do I install it in my Windows partition or Ubuntu?  It doesn't make sense
2006-07-24T16:58:00.000Z	SlyFly		GTR, I can either use the BIN or SBIn directory, but if I do that, the application won't move...it won't do what it is supposed to do
2006-07-24T16:59:00.000Z	SlyFly		Omni, but I can't install the application into the .wine folder because it is not available for selection from the browse window
2006-07-24T16:59:00.000Z	Sanne	SlyFly	wine should have set up a fake windows directory under ~/.wine/something... You should install your app somewhere under that path.
2006-07-24T16:59:00.000Z	Sanne	SlyFly	I see
2006-07-24T16:59:00.000Z	SlyFly	Sanne	I can do that...but I can't access the .wine directory from the browse path
2006-07-24T05:01:00.000Z	Sanne	SlyFly	what I usually do, is, let wine create the fake windows drive, but after that, I move it to a custom location. It involves some trickery though I would have to dig out again how to do that.
2006-07-24T05:02:00.000Z	SlyFly	Sanne	it is alright...I'll try to find a way to point the application to the .wine folder
2006-07-24T05:04:00.000Z	Sanne	SlyFly	oh, I found how I did it, under ~/.wine/dosdevices there's a link to the location of "c:". I just changed the link and pointed it to the folder where I moved ~/.wine/drive_c to. Might be too much hassle, though.
2006-07-24T05:04:00.000Z	SlyFly	Sanne	that looks like a complicated procedure with no benefits...it's probably not worth doing
2006-07-24T05:05:00.000Z	Sanne	SlyFly	I just read OmniColos's advice to use winecfg for that... don't listen to me, I didn't think of the advanced configurability wine now has.
2006-07-24T05:06:00.000Z	SlyFly	Sanne	yeah, I already did that...the configuration
2006-07-24T05:06:00.000Z	Sanne	SlyFly	the problem might be that windows programs maybe hide folders that start with a dot, like .wine
2006-07-24T05:07:00.000Z	SlyFly	Sanne	I will keep trying to play with different directories to see what happens...but first, how do i remove the borders around the application?  It shows up as a square because of borders that shouldn't be there
2006-07-24T05:09:00.000Z	Sanne	SlyFly	I don't know exactly what you mean, but in winecfg, under Graphics, you can play with the setting of "Emulate a virtual desktop".
2006-07-24T05:14:00.000Z	SlyFly	Sanne	thanks again...I appreciate it..the application has been installed...for whatever reason, my Ubuntu partition is Z...not C
