2011-05-29T21:53:00.000Z	Enissay		Is there any way to make 1080p videos work correctly on a Pentium M 1400 MHZ 1GB ram?
2011-05-29T21:54:00.000Z	hypatia	Enissay	your only hope would be if it has a good vudeo card
2011-05-29T21:55:00.000Z	Enissay		hydh, I dont think so, It Is an integrated intel stuff
2011-05-29T21:55:00.000Z	Enissay	hypatia	I dont think so, It Is an integrated intel stuff
2011-05-29T21:55:00.000Z	hypatia	Enissay	probably no luck then :(
2011-05-29T21:55:00.000Z	Enissay		xD
2011-05-29T21:55:00.000Z	hypatia		laptop or desktop?
2011-05-29T21:55:00.000Z	Enissay		laptop
2011-05-29T21:56:00.000Z	hypatia		yeah, not gonna happen Enissay - to do 1080p on that kinda proc, you need video card acceleration
2011-05-29T21:57:00.000Z	Enissay	hypatia	what about 720p vids?
2011-05-29T21:58:00.000Z	hypatia	Enissay	maybe, but i also douby it
2011-05-29T21:59:00.000Z	hypatia		*doubt
2011-05-29T21:59:00.000Z	Enissay	hypatia	yeah... thanks mate :)
2011-05-29T22:00:00.000Z	hypatia		glad to help, Enissay
2011-05-29T22:00:00.000Z	hypatia	Enissay	fwiw, you want mplayer's vdpau option when you're dealing with low power but accelerated video
2011-05-29T22:03:00.000Z	Enissay	hypatia	didnt get it?
2011-05-29T22:06:00.000Z	hypatia	Enissay	if you're doing video on a machne with a crappy processor but a good video card, you can use mplayer's vdpau option to run the video decodinf on the video card :)
2011-05-29T22:07:00.000Z	Enissay	hypatia	ow, I see... but it's not my case... coz the whole laptop is crap lol
2011-05-29T22:07:00.000Z	hypatia	Enissay	yeah, sorry it doesn't help with that :(
2011-05-29T22:08:00.000Z	Enissay	hypatia	ow, u certainly did with these informations :)
2011-05-29T22:08:00.000Z	hypatia	Enissay	for reference, i use a very low-powered Atom machine for my TV PC, and it decodes 1080P perfectly with mplayer :)
2011-05-29T22:10:00.000Z	Enissay	hypatia	cool :)
