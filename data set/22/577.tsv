2011-07-10T22:01:00.000Z	ron34563654		i've a wireless card but i don't know where to get drivers from. any help?
2011-07-10T22:03:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	you don't. They're called modules and are already part of the kernel
2011-07-10T22:04:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	so why i can't connect to the internet?
2011-07-10T22:05:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	maybe it's not supported? There isn't modules for all the cards since manufacturers don't supply them
2011-07-10T22:07:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	isn't there anything else to do?
2011-07-10T22:07:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	what do you mean else? Other than what?
2011-07-10T22:08:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	how can i know if my card supported?
2011-07-10T22:10:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	read the page I sent you. Most of the cards work out of the box. If they don't, that page tells you the best chances to make it work. But even better, I'd call the company that built it asking for modules. If they say that they don't support Linux, I'd just return it and get my money back. I should be free to run any OS I want
2011-07-10T22:23:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	i've typed lspci -v | less but i dno't see my card there
2011-07-10T22:27:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	are you sure? run 'lspci -v > output' this will create a a file named output on your home directory. pastebin it (paste the output here http://goo.gl/ixcN9 ) and then give us the link
2011-07-10T22:46:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	is that really all of the output?
2011-07-10T22:46:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	also, is your wifi card a pci card? Or is it USB?
2011-07-10T22:48:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	also, I don't think you pasted everything. The last line you pasted was a : which I think means there's more stuff on the file
2011-07-10T22:56:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	pci. i think that i posted it all. but let me beging over again
2011-07-10T22:57:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	you did not. Open the file with gedit. If you run the command as I told you 'lspci -v > output' the file will show up on your home directory and then you can open it with gedit
2011-07-10T23:03:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	if you open the link that you sent me, you'll see that's not everything
2011-07-10T23:08:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	for some reason i can't paste or scroll it all. and can't save it to file
2011-07-10T23:08:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	you can if you do 'lspci -v > filename'
2011-07-10T23:12:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	http://paste.ubuntu.com/641463/  anyway. i found the cd driver. it's edimax
2011-07-10T23:14:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	cd drive? What are you talking about?
2011-07-10T23:25:00.000Z	ron34563654	carandraug	i've win driver on a cd
2011-07-10T23:27:00.000Z	carandraug	ron34563654	I've better things to do. To me it looks like you're trolling
