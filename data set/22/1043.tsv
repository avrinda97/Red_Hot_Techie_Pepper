2010-11-04T17:39:00.000Z	evon		Hello, I have a network drive mounted on my main computer but for some reason it keeps disconnecting by itself.  The same thing happens for the VNC server.  I want them to run continuously.  Any ideas on how to fix this?
2010-11-04T17:40:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Do you have a D-Link DSG-1224T?
2010-11-04T17:40:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	no
2010-11-04T17:41:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	I suggest you purchase one.
2010-11-04T17:41:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	you think it's a router problem?
2010-11-04T17:41:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	how you figure?
2010-11-04T17:41:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Probably... Is it wireless?
2010-11-04T17:42:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	yes. but the computers are contected via ethernet cables
2010-11-04T17:42:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Does this happen to just VNC and the network drive, or for anything?
2010-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Tried pinging google for a while, or ping one computer from the other
2010-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	I wil try those. It just happens with vnc and the network drive that was mounted vie sshfs
2010-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Do you have any other connections that are persisten?
2010-11-04T17:45:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	nope. not to those computers. ping says that the computer is unreachable
2010-11-04T17:45:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Pastbin the output of ifconfig from both computers
2010-11-04T17:46:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	ok give me a couple minutes
2010-11-04T17:51:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/525670/
2010-11-04T17:55:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	you get the link?
2010-11-04T17:56:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Yes, sorry for the slow reply. I am backing up my system. Everything seams fine, I can't see why you can't ping eachother.

2010-11-04T17:59:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	when i restart the vnc server it pings just fine. i'm using x11vnc.
2010-11-04T18:02:00.000Z	nettworker	evon	Strange
2010-11-04T18:03:00.000Z	evon	nettworker	you're telling me. the client computer has ubuntu and the host has mythbuntu on it. maybe i should install ubuntu on the host too?
