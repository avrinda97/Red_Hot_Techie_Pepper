2010-05-02T07:58:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3		how might I go about finding a mentor?
2010-05-02T07:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	a mentor?
2010-05-02T07:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	for what?
2010-05-02T08:00:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	yea... I guess. I mean, it's not always fun having to learn all everything by myself. sometimes I want someone that I can always count on that will teach me and guide me on some issues
2010-05-02T08:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	 I have helped loads of people properly with Ubuntu before, spent a lot of time with some.  Anyway I think something your after is the Ubuntu Manual
2010-05-02T08:02:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	well, anything that should cross my mind. I'm a very astute student and I study a lot.
2010-05-02T08:02:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	no, I'm much more experienced than that
2010-05-02T08:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	well this manual is great,  it has a lot of info in it,  but yeah contents page.  good reading, and good screen shots, aimed at beginners
2010-05-02T08:04:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	well, I've taught myself how to program in C++ and I've been using Ubuntu for 3 years. I also know bash, and I frequently find myself having to explore some of the things that could have been given to me by someone with more experience for hours. And yes, i know just about everything is out ther eon the net... but I would like someone to be a little more personal and less boring than a manual.
2010-05-02T08:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	well there are some pretty great people on this network, some of which will probably do what you want, but good luck trying to find them
2010-05-02T08:05:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	yea I get you
2010-05-02T08:05:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	what I frequently find about the people on the net, is that they are impatient with complete beginners. they want to deal with fundamental questions, not syntax problems
2010-05-02T08:06:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	I'm looking to converse with someone with experience.
2010-05-02T08:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	fundamental questions?   if I knew how to actsaully program, then yes I would probably  help people with that.  Just like I know how to use Ubuntu and pretty well for basics, so I help people with that here and such.
2010-05-02T08:07:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	ok, that's cool man
2010-05-02T08:07:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	do you want to get acquainted
2010-05-02T08:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	I know some people who program and such on the net,  but the two I am thinking of right now,  are quite busy in their actsual lives at the moment.
2010-05-02T08:09:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	I get you
2010-05-02T08:10:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	right now I am facing some career changing decisions. like, which branch of computer science do I want to go in
2010-05-02T08:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	anyway this could be a start for you at finding the kind of people you want to talk to.  ##programming
2010-05-02T08:10:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	sebsebseb	I'm eyeballing GUI creation, game programming and cyber security
2010-05-02T08:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	millertimek1a2m3	we gone off topic,  if you must continue this convo, pm
