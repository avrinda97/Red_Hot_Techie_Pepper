2008-06-09T21:43:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	have you messed with alsamixer
2008-06-09T21:44:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	just run alsamixer in terminal and see if all your levels are up
2008-06-09T21:44:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	, whats the command i put into the terminal (linux noob here)
2008-06-09T21:44:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	alsamixer
2008-06-09T21:45:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	--> Master, PCM and Front seem to be fine... FrontMi, Surround, Center are @ 0
2008-06-09T21:48:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	did you turn them up and give it a whirl?
2008-06-09T21:50:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	--> still nothing
2008-06-09T21:51:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	what kind of soundcard is it
2008-06-09T21:52:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	--> its included in the motherboard ... which is an ASUS P5K motherboard
2008-06-09T21:55:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	try going to system>preferences>sound, what does it say you're using for playback?
2008-06-09T21:56:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	--> Sound Playback: Autodetect
2008-06-09T21:57:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	try changing them to ALSA....
2008-06-09T21:58:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	--> OH!!! I GOT SOUND but its very weak!!
2008-06-09T21:59:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	try adjusting the volume or going into alsamixer
2008-06-09T22:00:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	--> the volume is adjusted (100%) and alsamixer is @ 100 too
2008-06-09T22:01:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	is it crackly or just weak
2008-06-09T22:01:00.000Z	[ne0]	dreadful_great	--> just weak
2008-06-09T22:04:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	Sorry but I have to go. My boss actually has some work for me today. I hope you can figure out your problem...
2008-06-09T22:05:00.000Z	dreadful_great	[ne0]	no problem. :)
