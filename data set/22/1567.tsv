2010-05-01T03:43:00.000Z	crogeek		with upgrade from 9.04 to 10.04 everything "went fine", except of wine
2010-05-01T03:43:00.000Z	crogeek		I cannot install wine
2010-05-01T03:43:00.000Z	crogeek		on lucid

2010-05-01T03:49:00.000Z	crogeek	aj00200	http://paste.ubuntu.com/425526/
2010-05-01T03:50:00.000Z	aj00200	crogeek	did this happen after/during updating?
2010-05-01T03:50:00.000Z	crogeek	aj00200	this happened when at the end of upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04
2010-05-01T03:50:00.000Z	aj00200	crogeek	I mean, have you updated recently, but had it fail?
2010-05-01T03:50:00.000Z	crogeek	aj00200	indeed
2010-05-01T03:51:00.000Z	aj00200	crogeek	same thing happened to me. I just made a backup and reinstalled. Nothing seems to help
2010-05-01T03:51:00.000Z	crogeek	aj00200	so nothing I can do?
2010-05-01T03:51:00.000Z	aj00200	crogeek	well, maybe, but I don't know how to fix it. I just made a backup and reinstalled
2010-05-01T03:51:00.000Z	crogeek	aj00200	and did reinstall fixed that?
2010-05-01T03:52:00.000Z	aj00200	crogeek	yes. Then I updated (I only had a 8.04 install disk)
2010-05-01T03:59:00.000Z	aj00200	crogeek	the install probably failed. And yes. It really does suck
