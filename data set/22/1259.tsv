2010-07-26T07:09:00.000Z	zerhash	ilovefairuz	strange, i got an error
2010-07-26T07:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	zerhash	pastebin everything, command and its output
2010-07-26T07:10:00.000Z	zerhash	ilovefairuz	http://pastebin.com/iHMuFFr4
2010-07-26T07:14:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	zerhash	something abnormal about parition spacing on sdb, you could install on sda and make it the first boot disk in bios
2010-07-26T07:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	zerhash	it's only the MBR that will be installed, all files will still remain on sdb
2010-07-26T07:17:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	zerhash	the MBR is very small and won't touch your files on sda
2010-07-26T07:17:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	zerhash	change only the second command line and make it sda
