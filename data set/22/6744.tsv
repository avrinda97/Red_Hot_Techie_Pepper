2006-08-09T09:53:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		kind of weird...
2006-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		had to kill X...
2006-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		ctrl + alt + backspace
2006-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	jmghost	Kr0ntab	using Dapper?
2006-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		yup
2006-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		It's mostly happened on my latptop...
2006-08-09T09:55:00.000Z	jmghost		Dammit, kind of makes WinXP looks like a stable OS after all...
2006-08-09T09:56:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		eh... I'm thinkin it's related to ACPI, as I think each time it's occurred after a lid open event... screen blanking after idle.. or some other variable.
2006-08-09T09:56:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		haven't narrowed it down...
2006-08-09T09:56:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		although it is just X... so maybe it's an xorg thing
2006-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	jmghost	Kr0ntab	different for me, I didn't have any ACPI event. But it seems to happen a lot with rdesktop
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	jmghost	Kr0ntab	bothered to send a bug report or you've given up like I did?
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		omg...
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		wait.
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		same thing here
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		thats exactly what it is
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	jmghost		euh?
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		I was idle in rdesktop for a while... and thats when it happened
2006-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	jmghost	rdesktop is the common factor.  after the remote host's screen blanks after some idle time... trying to move the mouse over it, killed X...
2006-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	jmghost	Kr0ntab	is it always happening with rdesktop?
2006-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		now that you mention it... on at least 2 of the occasions... I had an idled rdesktop session
2006-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	jmghost	Kr0ntab	it killed X or just the mouse?
