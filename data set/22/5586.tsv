2007-04-09T06:07:00.000Z	pyrak		can someone quickly point me at how to start messing around with the appearance on my machine?
2007-04-09T06:07:00.000Z	pyrak		its too mac-like
2007-04-09T06:08:00.000Z	pyrak		thanks profox
2007-04-09T06:10:00.000Z	pyrak		profox' thanks for all your advice, on my windows setup i had a lot more screen real-estate cus i was auto-hiding meny bars, but with gnome the auto hide lags when i hover to show it again
2007-04-09T06:10:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	that's fixable
2007-04-09T06:10:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	it's just the gnome default delay settings
2007-04-09T06:10:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	I can help you change the delay if you mant
2007-04-09T06:11:00.000Z	pyrak	cables	please
2007-04-09T06:11:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	hit alt-f2 and type gconf-editor
2007-04-09T06:11:00.000Z	pyrak	cables	roger
2007-04-09T06:11:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	hold on a sec
2007-04-09T06:12:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	apps/panel/toplevels
2007-04-09T06:12:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	whatever's under there are your panels, you can change options for them in there.
2007-04-09T06:13:00.000Z	pyrak	cables	thanks, odd this isnt there when you right click and hit properties...
2007-04-09T06:14:00.000Z	pyrak	cables	could you also give me a tip on how i can get disk to show under system > administration
2007-04-09T06:14:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	Gnome likes to oversimplify things. Along with its horrible default panel settings, it can be pretty bad. I still like it more than KDE (and definitely windows)
2007-04-09T06:14:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	right click on the menubar and hit edit menus to change what shows up in the menus.
2007-04-09T06:16:00.000Z	pyrak	cables	hm, disk isnt there, its just weird cus the directions for mounting my windows partition refer to it (though i was able to mount the partition anyway), perhaps its an adjustment made in edgy?
2007-04-09T06:16:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	i think disks manager or whatever it was was removed from edgy
2007-04-09T06:17:00.000Z	pyrak	cables	lol, then how do i manage my disks?
2007-04-09T06:17:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	Applications>Accessories>Terminal :)
2007-04-09T06:18:00.000Z	cables	pyrak	you can probably install it manually
