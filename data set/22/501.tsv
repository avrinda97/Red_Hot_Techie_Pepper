2011-08-26T07:51:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	Sounds like one of the following: boot failure of some kind; you put a terminal in full screen and didn't realize it; or you switched to a virtual terminal that has no prompt for some reason
2011-08-26T07:54:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	i'm able too ssh
2011-08-26T07:55:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	Into the system from another computer?
2011-08-26T07:55:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	ya
2011-08-26T07:57:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	But on the computer in question you boot straight to a screen with just a blinking cursor?  Is there a login, gdm?
2011-08-26T07:57:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	just a blinking cursor no login
2011-08-26T07:58:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	GRUB?
2011-08-26T07:58:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	yes
2011-08-26T07:59:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	i ran the alternate installer in expert mode
2011-08-26T07:59:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	Can you switch to a virtual terminal from the blinkie?
2011-08-26T07:59:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	how?
2011-08-26T08:00:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	Press: Ctrl+Alt+F2 (with out the "+")
2011-08-26T08:01:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	that works
2011-08-26T08:01:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	have you done a successful install using the alternate installer before? And this was supposed to install a command line system, right?
2011-08-26T08:01:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	got you a prompt?
2011-08-26T08:02:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	ya i got one after Ctrl+Alt+F2
2011-08-26T08:03:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	i was attempting to do a command line install system and this is my first attempt
2011-08-26T08:05:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	i think i'm just going to install ubuntu server :)
2011-08-26T08:06:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	betanick	Go for it.  I've done a couple command line installs just to learn how, it can get really tricky tho.  My advise (having messed up quite a few times now) is to do it in a VM first
2011-08-26T08:07:00.000Z	betanick	JokesOnYou77	thanks
