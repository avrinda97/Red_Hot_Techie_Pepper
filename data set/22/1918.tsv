2009-11-25T23:08:00.000Z	t0rc		is there a way to make gnome-shell your default ?
2009-11-25T23:08:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	yes.
2009-11-25T23:09:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	by selecting it at login. if it asks you if you want to use it as the default you know the answer. If it doesn't then it should be already set.
2009-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	t0rc	SpaceGhostC2C	is it a good idea however? the repo version seems pretty stable...although I still question their use of JavaScript.
2009-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	what exactly are you talking about? The Gnome Display manager?
2009-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	Gnome is stable.
2009-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	I have no idea. Sorry about that
2009-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	t0rc	SpaceGhostC2C	Gnome-shell :P
2009-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	t0rc	SpaceGhostC2C	i.e., GNOME 3
2009-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	t0rc	SpaceGhostC2C	no worries; thanks though
2009-11-25T23:12:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	I'll look into it
2010-01-27T20:14:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	maybe you could ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-01-27T20:17:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	to me the real difference is the package manager, nothing else.
2010-01-27T20:24:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	this isn't the place to talk about it.
2010-01-27T20:24:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	you've been asked to move on.
2010-01-27T20:26:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	maybe you can take your opinions and shove them into a LFS distro of your own?
2010-01-27T20:27:00.000Z	t0rc	SpaceGhostC2C	I'm talking about Ubuntu. You commented on the subject. Twice now. Calm your keyboard.
2010-01-27T20:27:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	I can comment as much as I like buddy. maybe you should listen to the operater you're talking to.
2010-01-27T20:28:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	I mean ikonia
2010-01-27T20:30:00.000Z	t0rc	SpaceGhostC2C	perhaps your scrollback feature is disabled? You're the only one who suggested I go elsewhere.
2010-01-27T20:31:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	t0rc	I was referring to the part where ikonia asked you not to ask opinons on distros...
2010-01-27T20:35:00.000Z	t0rc	SpaceGhostC2C	I didn't deny that it was a personal matter really. I just think there's some things that most people would agree on. Such as if the kernel crashed all the time. Or the package repo was 3MB. And I've already installed it. Our banter has become dull though, I concur.
