2008-04-26T23:41:00.000Z	Daremonai	gnomefreak	it's still ignoring, it says: "Get:1 file: hardy release.gpg then says: Ign file: hardly/main translation-en us and another hardy/restricted translation-en_us, then it gets file hardy Release, and ignores hardy/main packages and hardy/restricted packages
