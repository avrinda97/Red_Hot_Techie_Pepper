2012-04-19T21:41:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	what kind of video card do you have, did you see drivers listed before in additional drivers?
2012-04-19T21:43:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	did you install updates during installation or has the laptop not yet been connected to the internet
2012-04-19T21:44:00.000Z	eightiesk	acicula	sry i dc
2012-04-19T21:45:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	did you use update-manager to check for updates yet

2012-04-19T21:48:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	yeah, just checkking google
2012-04-19T21:52:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	you were using 10.10 before?
2012-04-19T21:52:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	did you install that yourself, or was it preconfigured
2012-04-19T21:54:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	i can find some issues relating to the NVS 4200m quaddro card, but just about it requiring a newer nvidia driver that i would expct to be present already. did you try installing the nvidia-current package from the package manager?
2012-04-19T21:55:00.000Z	eightiesk	acicula	its installed.
2012-04-19T21:55:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	im reading this http://askubuntu.com/questions/36930/how-well-do-laptops-with-nvidia-optimus-work
2012-04-19T21:57:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	can you try disabling optimus in the bios?
2012-04-19T22:00:00.000Z	eightiesk	acicula	I love you.
2012-04-19T22:02:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	tl;dr optimus is terrible. unfortunatly you will suffer poor battery life because disabling the igp puts the discrete gpu on permanently
2012-04-19T22:03:00.000Z	acicula	eightiesk	logout and back in
