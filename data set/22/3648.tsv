2008-07-15T21:51:00.000Z	mbrigdan		how would I create a file so that it is "binary" and coudn't be read with gedit?
2008-07-15T21:53:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	put some rubbish there
2008-07-15T21:56:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	tried that, it just opens up the rubbish
2008-07-15T21:58:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	ah, do you want geany to produce an error while trying to open the file, or what?
2008-07-15T21:59:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	I want it to give me that "Encoding not found" error.
2008-07-15T21:59:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	no idea. just put some /dev/urandom there!
2008-07-15T22:04:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	that worked! and it still hides the message I added with bless! It also happens to be 89MB, but I can fix that later
2008-07-15T22:07:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	But generally, you want something strange, imo.
2008-07-15T23:03:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	Also, it depends on the kind of key you are generating
2008-07-15T23:03:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	its an RSA key
2008-07-15T23:04:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	RSA keys should be a bit longer, but 4096 still should be enough
2008-07-15T23:05:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	my key is 16384 bits, i'm guessing thats enough
2008-07-15T23:07:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	You're going to gain a lot of time to drink tea, I believe, without much enchancing your security. "enough" means, that nowadays people'd need 100 or so years to decrypt it.
2008-07-15T23:08:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	it only took about 10 mins to make the key, will it have an effect on how long it takes to ssh to the machine?
2008-07-15T23:09:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	It shouldn't.
2008-07-15T23:11:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	if I wanted to make a key that was twice as big, would it take twice as long, the square as long, or somewhere in between?
2008-07-15T23:12:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	Well, it should work like this, but you're looking in a wrong place to enchance your security.
2008-07-15T23:13:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	well, I probably won't really use this key much, I just wanted to know how much I could do. Hopefully someone doesn't make a working quantum computer soon.
2008-07-15T23:14:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	If he makes, then even 100K bit key won't help. Thus, let's take it easy! :)
2008-07-15T23:16:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	well, this is just a theory of mine, but I bet that if you can break current keys easily with a quantum computer, i'm betting that you can easily create massive keys too.
2008-07-15T23:17:00.000Z	macrobad	mbrigdan	No, unfortunately, it doesn't work like this. However, there *are* completely new ways to protect information, just google for quantum criptography, and prepare for a complete brain corruption! :-]
2008-07-15T23:19:00.000Z	mbrigdan	macrobad	ASULutzy: yeah, I probably know way to much about quantum stuff for my age (13). Time to end this conversation before we get !ot ed.
