2005-03-06T17:01:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	i think it tries to be intelligent :/
2005-03-06T17:01:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	probably alsa if its there
2005-03-06T17:01:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 =/
2005-03-06T17:01:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 I'm not getting any sound.
2005-03-06T17:01:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	have you got esd or polypaudio running?
2005-03-06T17:02:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 I've tried with/without ESD, with/without JACK (hah, yeah right), and I've got OSS and ALSA working, as well as PortAudio.
2005-03-06T17:02:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 I've tried both with and without.
2005-03-06T17:02:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	warty right?
2005-03-06T17:02:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 Right.
2005-03-06T17:04:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 Oh, it seems to only work with ESD, and I just realized that my "testing" last night was when I was way too tired to think clearly.  You have to kill all instances of firefox for it to see that ESD is running.
2005-03-06T17:04:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	ahha
2005-03-06T17:05:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 There's nothing better, at the moment.
2005-03-06T17:05:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	libswf sucks, i'm afraid
2005-03-06T17:06:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 JACK is pretty badass.  As soon as ESD is implemented as a client, as well as OSS and ALSA, it should be good for everyday use.
2005-03-06T17:06:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	well i had my system set up with dmix and that was working much better than i expected..
2005-03-06T17:06:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 Oh.  Other than the flashplayer-nonfree, are there any good players?
2005-03-06T17:06:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 True, but then you can't use OSS apps.
2005-03-06T17:06:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	yep. i have a whole plan for pushing for jack everywhere after hoary =)
2005-03-06T17:06:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 And there's no way to do a wrapper.
2005-03-06T17:06:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 Why not stary not? =D
2005-03-06T17:07:00.000Z	geppy	robtaylor	 I'm working on esd-jack. =D
2005-03-06T17:07:00.000Z	robtaylor	geppy	see above =)
