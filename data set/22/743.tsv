2011-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	ericxe		they are unmuted
2011-04-09T19:45:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	What hardware are you using?
2011-04-09T19:46:00.000Z	ericxe	VV0lf	SIS onboard
2011-04-09T19:46:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	Give me sometime to do some digging. I'm on a slow line...
2011-04-09T19:47:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	are you using sis 7012?
2011-04-09T19:49:00.000Z	ericxe	VV0lf	yes!
2011-04-09T19:51:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	 I notice someone is saying that they have that problem. You can check out this page ---> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=484876
2011-04-09T19:51:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	it is tried on older versions of Ubuntu. I think it should work the same with Xubuntu. If I'm not wrong, the difference between Ubuntu and Xubuntu is the interface engine used.
2011-04-09T19:53:00.000Z	ericxe	VV0lf	but in ubuntu it works perfectly
2011-04-09T19:53:00.000Z	ericxe	VV0lf	the problem is here in Xubuntu, and i don't know why
2011-04-09T19:54:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	Hmmm... I'm quite noob also... Let me see check it out...
2011-04-09T20:03:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	Still there?
2011-04-09T20:03:00.000Z	ericxe	VV0lf	yeah!
2011-04-09T20:09:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	If you are using Xubuntu 10.10
2011-04-09T20:09:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	It shouldn't be a problem...
2011-04-09T20:09:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	as Alsa is automatically loaded during bootime...
2011-04-09T20:10:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	Could you open synaptic and search for alsa-utils and alsa base and check if they are installed?
2011-04-09T20:11:00.000Z	ericxe	VV0lf	yes, they are installed
2011-04-09T20:13:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	Arrrgh... Sorry... I guess I'm still very noob... not sure how to help you. One experience I did have was in my sound preference, I changed my sound hardware from Internal Audio to HDMI.
2011-04-09T20:14:00.000Z	VV0lf	ericxe	you could check yours and see if you had anything similar to what I did...
