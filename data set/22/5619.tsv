2007-04-02T08:49:00.000Z	dwright		ATI...NVIDIA?
2007-04-02T08:50:00.000Z	dwright		jimmy20013:ATI? NVIDIA?
2007-04-02T08:50:00.000Z	dwright		dejand...try typing xhost + at a terminal prompt
2007-04-02T08:52:00.000Z	dwright		jimmy20013:I'm not sure I follow..you have a single head card?
2007-04-02T08:54:00.000Z	dwright		jimmy20013....typically, once you install a card in AGP slot, the onboard video is disabled
2007-04-02T08:55:00.000Z	dwright		anyone else know of a system where onboard will work with AGP card installed?
2007-04-02T08:55:00.000Z	dooglus	dwright	has this 'xhost +' ever worked for you in ubuntu?
2007-04-02T08:56:00.000Z	dwright	dooglus	Yes I use it all the time
2007-04-02T08:56:00.000Z	dooglus	dwright	ok
2007-04-02T09:01:00.000Z	dwright	dooglus	I use incoming connections all the time
2007-04-02T09:03:00.000Z	dooglus	dwright	did you have to enable listening in the X server config?  or do you use ssh -Y?
2007-04-02T09:03:00.000Z	dwright	dooglus	I just use xhost +
2007-04-02T09:03:00.000Z	dooglus	dwright	what's DISPLAY set to on the remote machine?
2007-04-02T09:03:00.000Z	dwright	dooglus	export DISPLAY=x.x.x.:0.0
2007-04-02T09:04:00.000Z	dooglus	dwright	it seems to have done, yes
2007-04-02T09:04:00.000Z	dooglus	dwright	exporting DISPLAY to be x.x.x.x shouldn't work
2007-04-02T09:05:00.000Z	dwright	dooglus	I use it all the time but I connect to Solaris
2007-04-02T09:05:00.000Z	dooglus	dwright	that's different.  he was wanting to connect to ubuntu.
2007-04-02T09:05:00.000Z	dwright	dooglus	right I wasn't thinking
