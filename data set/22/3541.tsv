2008-09-10T15:42:00.000Z	moncojhr		hey, how do i set the defualt application for specific file types? (outside of nautilus i need the search application to use it)
2008-09-10T15:42:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	editing ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list  should help
2008-09-10T15:43:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	do you know the syntax of the lines im ment to put in? mines empty
2008-09-10T15:44:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	i beleive you can follow the format of the global equivalent - which should be at /usr/share/gnome/applications/defaults.list
2008-09-10T15:46:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	THANKS! i needed to know where the global one was :-D
2008-09-10T15:55:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	i edited the defualts.list and still the same thing
2008-09-10T15:56:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	still the same thing meaning the default app was not changed?
2008-09-10T15:56:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	yeah
2008-09-10T15:56:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	ok, what did you put in defaults.list?
2008-09-10T15:57:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	audio/mpeg=foobar2000.desktop
2008-09-10T15:57:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	just that line?
2008-09-10T15:57:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	yeah
2008-09-10T15:58:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	i think you need the very first line to say  [Default Applications]
2008-09-10T15:58:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	yeah i was about to say thats at the top too
2008-09-10T16:00:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	errm, i dunno what foobar2000.desktop does - but i suspect it's one you have created, verify that the file exists
2008-09-10T16:01:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	ooh your right, for some reason the file has some crap at the end of the name, but i cant see it in nautilus
2008-09-10T16:02:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	is there a way so i can see the full filenames in nautilus, including the .desktop part
2008-09-10T16:02:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	errm, i don't know, i don't use nautilus very much.
2008-09-10T16:03:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	what do you use? nautilus is pretty bad...
2008-09-10T16:04:00.000Z	unop	moncojhr	I use the terminal and midnight commander
2008-09-10T16:05:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	my foobar.desktop is actually called userapp-foobar2000-XA2TGU.desktop ... cool
2008-09-10T16:08:00.000Z	moncojhr	unop	thanks for your help :-)
