2008-08-14T03:01:00.000Z	belkinhelp2		funny...i was looking under preferences.network....no wonder i didnt find it
2008-08-14T03:01:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	if you go to system>administration>services, is samba checked?
2008-08-14T03:02:00.000Z	belkinhelp2	_oOMOo_	 yes, the service is running
2008-08-14T03:10:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	have you ever had it working?
2008-08-14T03:11:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	do you have 2 windows machines on your network?
2008-08-14T03:12:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	I don't think they have to be the same
2008-08-14T03:17:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	- no, that does mean the network is working fine at least
2008-08-14T03:19:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	it's nice when things work :)
2008-08-14T03:19:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	has the reboot made any difference?
2008-08-14T03:23:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	I know that's not particularly scientific
2008-08-14T03:24:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	you could try sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart see if it goes
2008-08-14T03:26:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	you owe p4 I think :)
2008-08-14T03:28:00.000Z	_oOMOo_	belkinhelp2	glad it's fixed(ish!)
