2010-11-25T16:33:00.000Z	Kingsy		in ubuntu how do you go about setting a static IP address?
2010-11-25T16:34:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	with networkmanager
2010-11-25T16:35:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- yea I am looking at it.. but I don't really get it, see I am using wireless,.. so you click on wireless then its asking me to choose the network name.. ?
2010-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	well if you're on wireless you don't want a static ip
2010-11-25T16:37:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- I wanted to use port forwarding tho, so I could have an FTP on my latop
2010-11-25T16:38:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	you can still do that
2010-11-25T16:39:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- well in the port forwarding rules I need to set the local ip address of my machine.. if this changes then that rule will be redundent
2010-11-25T16:39:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- all I wanna do is make sure that my laptop is always 192.168.0.50 or something
2010-11-25T16:39:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	I don't understand, are you trying to forward a port on the laptop or on another system to the laptop?
2010-11-25T16:40:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- from the router to the laptop
2010-11-25T16:40:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	k, is the router a linux system or do you mean cable/dsl modem?
2010-11-25T16:40:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- its just a cable modem
2010-11-25T16:40:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	k, is the wireless built into the cable modem?
2010-11-25T16:41:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- no the wireless is on a seperate device
2010-11-25T16:41:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	so perhaps it wont be that easy :S
2010-11-25T16:42:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	is the wireless ap plugged into the modem too?
2010-11-25T16:42:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- yup
2010-11-25T16:43:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	so this means you have admin rights on the wifi router?
2010-11-25T16:43:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- yea
2010-11-25T16:44:00.000Z	Gnea	Kingsy	your problem is solved then. just don't reset it and you'll likely get the same IP everytime. I've gone for months and had the same IP from a wifi ap, it never changed because I never flushed the settings.
2010-11-25T16:50:00.000Z	Kingsy	Gnea	- works like a charm.. cheers man
