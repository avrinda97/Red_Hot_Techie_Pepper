2012-05-17T07:08:00.000Z	bluesnow		Hi, I'm having internet connection problems
2012-05-17T07:08:00.000Z	bluesnow		I can ping myself but can't ping any DNS servers, and nslookup is returning connection timed out, no servers could be reached
2012-05-17T07:09:00.000Z	bluesnow		Any idea how to fix this? I've turned off firewall, SELinux, etc, but still can't ping any DNS servers or other websites
