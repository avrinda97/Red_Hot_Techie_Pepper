2009-03-22T21:03:00.000Z	Frijolie		when you "lock your desktop" is the password to get back in NOT the same as the one you log back in with?
2009-03-22T21:03:00.000Z	Frijolie		log back in = gdm password?
2009-03-22T21:05:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	yes
2009-03-22T21:06:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	hmmm..it's not working now
2009-03-22T21:06:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	check that CapsLock is off
2009-03-22T21:06:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	yeah it's off
2009-03-22T21:06:00.000Z	Frijolie		it says "incorrect password", so I switch user and log in with that same password via gdm
2009-03-22T21:07:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	and u're sure u're using the same password u used to login with at boot up?
2009-03-22T21:07:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	of course
2009-03-22T21:07:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	are u sure it's the same user that the screen is locked for?
2009-03-22T21:08:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	there is only one user on this computer, unless that user has multiple personalities that are created without my knowledge within the OS
2009-03-22T21:09:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	well, it all seems quite strange
2009-03-22T21:09:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	hence my appearance on this IRC chatroom
2009-03-22T21:09:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	which screensaver app are u using? which desktop env?
2009-03-22T21:10:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	it's not being locked via a screensaver..i was just testing it out and forcing the screen to lock
2009-03-22T21:10:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	I'm suing GNOME and Metacity, screen saver is "blank screen"
2009-03-22T21:10:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	theme is set to "human" and I'm not using the 24-hour clock and my BIOS is set to UTC
2009-03-22T21:11:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	and my favorite food is squid and peanutbutter
2009-03-22T21:11:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	AHA!! It's the peanutbutter! :-P
2009-03-22T21:12:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	anything else you can think of?
2009-03-22T21:12:00.000Z	dayo	Frijolie	honestly, no. i can't imagine what the problem is.
2009-03-22T21:13:00.000Z	Frijolie	dayo	hmm, d'oh!
