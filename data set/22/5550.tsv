2007-04-21T14:27:00.000Z	ceil420		if i "apt-get install audacious", where would 'audacious.pc' be?
2007-04-21T14:28:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	try /usr/lib/pkgconfig
2007-04-21T14:28:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	it is a dev file though
2007-04-21T14:41:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	it is simple to just compile an application and prefix it to your home directory though
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	ceil420	eck	i'm getting an error when i try ./configure
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	wht package are you trying to build?
2007-04-21T14:42:00.000Z	ceil420	eck	conky, with audacious support
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	sudo apt-get build-dep conky
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	ceil420	eck	but even just ./configure without anything gives me an error
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	and grab the audacious-dev package as well
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	then you will be able to configure it fine
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	ceil420	eck	build-dep? what's that do?
2007-04-21T14:43:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	it grabs the build dependencies :-)
2007-04-21T14:44:00.000Z	ceil420	eck	how will that let me do the equivalent of "./configure --enable=audacious"?
2007-04-21T14:44:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	you still need to compile it yourself, but this way you will have all the dev headers so the configure script won't fail
2007-04-21T14:45:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	you need deb-src lines in your sources.list
2007-04-21T14:53:00.000Z	ceil420	eck	thanks much ^^
2007-04-27T08:05:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	lsb_release -a
2007-07-01T15:37:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	use cdrecord (or whatever they are calling it hese days)
2007-07-01T15:37:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	you can make an iso fs with mkisofs and then burn the image
2007-07-01T15:37:00.000Z	ceil420	eck	how would i use that to burn, say, ~/images and ~/documents onto a CD?
2007-07-01T15:37:00.000Z	eck	ceil420	use mkisofs
