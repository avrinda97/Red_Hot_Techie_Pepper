2010-09-03T19:46:00.000Z	Maro__		Hey, does anyone know a good forum post/page explaining how to get two video cards to work? I haven't been able to find anything useful on ubuntuforums...
2010-09-03T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	what graphic card?
2010-09-03T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	system>admin...>hardware drivers
2010-09-03T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	and the problem is?
2010-09-03T19:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	with nvidia you have to use nvidia-settings. run in a terminal « gksudo nvidia-settings & »
2010-09-03T19:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	there is button to save the config to the xorg file use it when you are done
2010-09-03T22:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	press shift during boot for the grub menu to appear
2010-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	any idea what the command is to reset the graphics drivers to default?
2010-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	I broke stuff by installing a proprietry nvidia driver...
2010-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	the recovery menu should have an option to restore Xwindows
2010-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	okay thanks, will give it a try... :D
2010-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	that didn't work, shift did nothing ;p
2010-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	can you switch to a VT ? crtl + alt + f1
2010-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	no, its crashed on the black screen. Keyboard doesnt do anything- no lights etc
2010-09-03T22:26:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	So..uh any other ways to get into a recovery console?
2010-09-03T22:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	what exactly did you do? edit a file? or what
2010-09-03T22:28:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	No, I just changed the driver from the most up to date nvidia driver to a slightly older one to try and resolve a problem. Rebooted and it blackscreens
2010-09-03T22:28:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	that is from the hardware drivers utility, not manually
2010-09-03T22:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	i see; maybe just moving /etc/X11/xorg.conf out of the way ( from a livecd ) works
2010-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	Maro__	erUSUL	Okay, thanks, I'll try that!
2010-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	mount the ubuntu partition and use « sudo mv /mount/point/etc/X11/xorg.conf /mount/point/etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak  »
2010-09-03T22:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Maro__	no problem
