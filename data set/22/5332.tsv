2007-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	Carb0n		Anyone know a non-destructive partition resizer for ext2/ext3?
2007-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	the gnome-partition editor
2007-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	gparted
2007-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	Is it NON-DESTRUCTIVE?
2007-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	no promises, but it should be
2007-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	I mean does it tamper with my data when I resize it?
2007-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	nope
2007-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	no promises though :D
2007-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	What about internal file fragmentation, then?
2007-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	I dpm, all I know is it didn't kill my partitions
2007-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	I don't know, all I know is it didn't kill my partitions
2007-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	Does it handle that, when I try to expand a partition on the begining of the cylinder?
2007-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	OK.  Thank you very much.
2007-10-25T16:54:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	I don't know, sorry
2007-10-25T16:55:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	I wanted to pick between GParted, QTParted, and extresize
2007-10-25T16:55:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	ah.  I've only ever used gparted, and it works well enough
2007-10-25T16:55:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	Or anything that weren't in my radar ;)
2007-10-25T16:55:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	I've used many. But like only GParted (interface) and QTParted (Stability)
2007-10-25T16:56:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	I know. I just refrain from using the commandline interface
2007-10-25T16:57:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	What I mean by stability is that GParted doesn't allow too much tweaking.  FS block size for example.
2007-10-25T16:57:00.000Z	compwiz18	Carb0n	it's gnome :)
2007-10-25T16:58:00.000Z	Carb0n	compwiz18	ok.  thanks.
