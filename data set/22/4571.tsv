2009-01-14T06:34:00.000Z	Kamilion		My Problem: Samba 3.2.3 on 8.10, trying to connect to a share from XPsp3, Mapping drive works with bare login ( kamilion/password ), network neighborhood does not (replaces with CORE\kamilion). Is there a workaround I can be pointed at for this other than having to map drive letters every time? Perhaps a config setting for samba to accept MACHINE\user ?

2009-01-14T06:42:00.000Z	Kamilion	itachi	Samba's using my unix account password by using pam_smb.so, so I don't have a smbpasswd database to add a user too.
