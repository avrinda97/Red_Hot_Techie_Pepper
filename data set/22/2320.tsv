2009-07-18T08:52:00.000Z	MattPhilie		Oh.. sorry.. Well I just got Ubuntu and I downloaded a .deb and went to open it and got this message.  /tmp/cairo-dock_v2.0.8_i686-1.deb could not be opened, because the associated helper application does not exist. Change the association in your preferences.
2009-07-18T08:52:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	dpkg -i filename.deb
2009-07-18T09:00:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	you can create the folder with 'mkdir .cairo'
2009-07-18T09:01:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	create the folder in your home directory (shorthand for your home directory is just the tilde ~) and put your theme into there
2009-07-18T09:02:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	will try
2009-07-18T09:02:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	also, welcome to Ubuntu.  :)  Feel free to experiment with your operating system.  We'll gladly answer any questions you've got.
2009-07-18T09:03:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	Thanks.. SO far its tricky but I Love the look and feel
2009-07-18T09:04:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	mkdir .cairo like that? With the space?
2009-07-18T09:04:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	mkdir is short for Make Directory.
2009-07-18T09:06:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	I cannot find the theme in the application it self. It only shows the default one.. I made mkdir .cairo in the home folder and added the folder of the theme into it and had no luck..
2009-07-18T09:07:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	I cannot help you with the theme itself.  I just knew how to help you get the directory created that the application was looking for.
2009-07-18T09:11:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	there you go.  Create the directory .cairo-dock and put the theme in THERE.  Not going to tell you how to do it, just use what I told you last time.
2009-07-18T09:14:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	type this:  mkdir .cairo-dock && mkdir .cairo-dock/themes
2009-07-18T09:14:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	that will create both directories.  Put the theme into the themes directory
2009-07-18T10:24:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	where did you get the plugin from?
2009-07-18T10:25:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	I was on YouTube.. It said to download it.. Then do the manual install. I installed from Adobe's website
2009-07-18T10:26:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	OK.. How do I go about removing the current one.. so firefox won't close on me
2009-07-18T10:26:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	erm..  I honestly don't k now.
2009-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	By the way.. I go this from the terminal running the sudo command thing ...  " sudo apt-get install flashplayer-nonfree "
2009-07-18T10:30:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	It says within the message flashplugin-nonfree is already the newest version.
2009-07-18T23:26:00.000Z	ascheel	MattPhilie	I'll give you credit.  You're certainly brute forcing your way through the issues you're having.  :)  Hats off to you.
2009-07-18T23:27:00.000Z	MattPhilie	ascheel	Thanks     zortec: Checking now
