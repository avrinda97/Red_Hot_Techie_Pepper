2008-11-11T11:52:00.000Z	crashatau	_2	Check the permissions on your home folder
2008-11-11T11:52:00.000Z	crashatau	_2	Make sure you home folder belongs to your user.
2008-11-11T11:52:00.000Z	_2	crashatau	perms are fine
2008-11-11T11:53:00.000Z	_2	crashatau	any other thoughts ?
2008-11-11T11:53:00.000Z	crashatau	_2	and your .gnome in home directory?
2008-11-11T11:53:00.000Z	_2	crashatau	yes perms are fine
2008-11-11T11:54:00.000Z	crashatau	_2	Are you just right clicking them and hitting delete?
2008-11-11T11:55:00.000Z	_2	crashatau	there is no "delete"   that's the problem
2008-11-11T11:55:00.000Z	crashatau	_2	ah.
2008-11-11T11:56:00.000Z	_2	crashatau	and i highlight and hit [del]  it says can't move to trash do i want to delete,  i say delete and it does nothing
2008-11-11T11:56:00.000Z	crashatau	_2	I normally just left click the icon and shift+delete
2008-11-11T11:57:00.000Z	_2	crashatau	so i'm thinking that they are not in my home but in /usr/share/something... ?
