2011-05-20T08:26:00.000Z	Roasted		Who has used Zentyal for Samba/CIFS? I'm getting an error on a share I created when I go to access control. It's a huge massive long red error. Has anybody seen this by chance?

2011-05-20T08:29:00.000Z	Roasted		How can I tell how far along my raid array sync is?
2011-05-20T08:29:00.000Z	Roasted		for software raid
2011-05-20T08:31:00.000Z	Roasted		Besides Webmin and Zentyal, what else is out there for web based server management?
2011-05-20T08:33:00.000Z	Guest32825	Roasted	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SysCP
2011-05-20T08:34:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	it doesnt say anything about samba, raid control, etc...
2011-05-20T08:38:00.000Z	Guest32825	Roasted	are you looking for software to do the work for you?
2011-05-20T08:39:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	I'm looking for web based software so I can manage this box from outside the network.
2011-05-20T08:39:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	Im leaving behind a file server when I move out so I want to be able to forward the port and log in whenever I want. IT's for my parents.
2011-05-20T08:39:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	I just want a quick way to see how the raid array is doing and tweak any CIFS shares I need to
2011-05-20T08:40:00.000Z	Guest32825	Roasted	why not set up ssh and a performance monitoring tool for the web piece?
2011-05-20T08:40:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	I suppose that's an option too
2011-05-20T08:40:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	how does my idea not make sense?
2011-05-20T08:41:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	forward port, log in externally, see what I need to see, done.
2011-05-20T08:42:00.000Z	Guest32825	Roasted	the is issue is that there is no once size fits all for what you want to do
2011-05-20T08:42:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	well I think zentyal does the job, but I'm getting some weird errors with it. I'm curious if rebooting it would help since I installed it, but I dont' want to interrupt my array that's cu rrently syncing.
2011-05-20T08:44:00.000Z	Guest32825	Roasted	I would wait until the array is in sync
2011-05-20T08:44:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	I hear ya. I hate to tick it off. :P
2011-05-20T08:44:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	it's hard to tho when I'm on the verge of falling asleep and zentyal says its got 49 minutes to complete :/
2011-05-20T08:45:00.000Z	Guest32825	Roasted	further 90 % of the wierd errors make perfect sense though we might not know what they are
2011-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	Roasted	Guest32825	well my thought process is with installing zentyal that attaches itself to contrlling things like samba, smb.conf, users and groups, etc, I wouldn't be surprised if a reboot is needed to sync things up, because I'm not seeing an option to add users in the zentyal panel and I can't seem to edit anything samba wise. Just a guess, though
