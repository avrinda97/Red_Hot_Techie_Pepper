2007-07-06T16:15:00.000Z	arnath		anyone? -> 500 gig drive is showing up as 469 gig free space (one partition in ext3)
2007-07-06T16:16:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	drive when they sell them too you usually sell them by 1000 kb = a megabyte instead of 1024 then the format takes space too
2007-07-06T16:17:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	ye i know, but the thing is fdisk -l said it was 500.1 before i started formatting
2007-07-06T16:18:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	on another note -> is it wise to have 1 500 gig partition, or better to split it up? (i read something bout potentially running out of inodes or something?)
2007-07-06T16:18:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	I never had a problem without making multiple partitions with my 4 500 gigs
2007-07-06T16:19:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	ah great :)
2007-07-06T16:20:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	one last thing hehe, the drive isnt showing up in my "places" in ubuntu, do i need to add it somewhere?
2007-07-06T16:21:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	once you format it it should auto detect. Some drives don't auto detect so you have to manual make a folder and mount them.
2007-07-06T16:21:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	i seem to have a bigger problem, i'm in "computer" at the moment and when i try to open the drive, i get "Unable to mount the selected volume"
2007-07-06T16:22:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	did you do sudo before the mount command?
2007-07-06T16:22:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	no, im not trying to mount, i added it to fstab, shouldnt it auto mount then? :S
2007-07-06T16:23:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	fstab is for internal drives not usb drives
2007-07-06T16:23:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	i did _not_ know that :|
2007-07-06T16:23:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	so how do i go about mounting it automatically? :S
2007-07-06T16:24:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	it shows up as /dev/sdc
2007-07-06T16:26:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	you will click on System->Administrator->ShareFolder ubuntu will install samba for you to share the device
2007-07-06T16:28:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	yes but it would still require me to auto-mount on every reboot
2007-07-06T16:29:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	ok will do that, best to mount in /media or my home folder?
2007-07-06T16:30:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	if i do a sudo mount ...., will it require me to give the admin password on startup then?
2007-07-06T16:33:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	anybody that has physical access to your computers is a security breach
2007-07-06T16:36:00.000Z	c_lisp	arnath	/usr/sbin
2007-07-06T16:42:00.000Z	arnath	c_lisp	could you give me an example of the mount command again btw? i've been scrolling up but can't seem to find it :)
