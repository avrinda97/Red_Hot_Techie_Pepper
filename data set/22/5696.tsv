2007-03-16T14:50:00.000Z	cosmodad		I've just installed sun-java6-plugin. Can anyone tell me why Firefox won't load any java applets?
2007-03-16T14:51:00.000Z	beast_	cosmodad	did you install java 6 using a guide or something?
2007-03-16T14:51:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	just aptitude'd it
2007-03-16T14:52:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	is there a guide I should have followed?
2007-03-16T14:52:00.000Z	beast_	cosmodad	could you please help install it?
2007-03-16T14:52:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	I'm asking for help myself!
2007-03-16T14:52:00.000Z	beast_	cosmodad	lol but you're furthur than i am
2007-03-16T14:53:00.000Z	beast_	cosmodad	it's ok nvm
2007-03-16T14:53:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	just one "sudo aptitude install sun-java6-plugin"
2007-03-16T14:53:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	but maybe you wanna try, it worked on my girlfriend's machine flawlessly
2007-03-16T14:53:00.000Z	beast_	cosmodad	not the plugin, java 6 JDK
2007-03-16T14:54:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	that'd be one among sun-java6-*
2007-03-16T14:54:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	btw I got it from edgy-backports
2007-03-16T14:54:00.000Z	beast_	cosmodad	ahh i use dapper
2007-03-16T14:54:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	oh ok... different thing then
2007-03-16T15:06:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	you can do "dpkg -i *.dpkg"
2007-03-16T15:07:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	it'll resolve installation order by itself
2007-03-16T15:07:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	hold on... did you see those dapper backports of java6?
2007-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	I didn't catch the entire thread but why would you not install through the package manager?
2007-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	beast_	cosmodad	yeah i'm looking right now but some of the dependencies aren't there
2007-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	if it's a backport they should all be in place
2007-03-16T15:09:00.000Z	cosmodad	beast_	you need to add the dapper-backports repository -- you did that, didn't you?
