2009-08-17T21:19:00.000Z	linuxson25		just downgraded my alsa-base, and still no sound
2009-08-17T21:19:00.000Z	linuxson25		And help will be appreciated
2009-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	linuxson25		ALSA config problem....anyone?
2009-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	linuxson25		edited the alsa-base.conf file...added my hardware and stuff
2009-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	linuxson25		Still no sound
2009-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	bazhang	linuxson25	you need to give many more details then that. simply repeating alsa config problem wont yield much assistance
2009-08-17T21:23:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	ok....how do you private message here? all these messages are just getting me confused
2009-08-17T21:23:00.000Z	bazhang	linuxson25	keep it here in channel, no PM please
2009-08-17T21:25:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	Ok, let me start from the beginning....when I installed Ubuntu 9.04, sound worked fine through the jacks, but no onboard sound
2009-08-17T21:26:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	I fiddled around with compiling alsa from source, but it looks like it only deleted my driver
2009-08-17T21:27:00.000Z	bazhang	linuxson25	what card do you have
2009-08-17T21:27:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	Its onboard -  Intel Corporation 82801FB
2009-08-17T21:29:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	I must also add, that I downgraded my alsa-base to intrepid version
2009-08-17T21:30:00.000Z	bazhang	linuxson25	that perhaps is the source of more difficulties. have you gone throught the sound factoid steps (or had you prior to mixing version releases of a package)
2009-08-17T21:31:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	sound factoid steps?? Elaborate
2009-08-17T21:32:00.000Z	bazhang	linuxson25	though it may be too late at this point as you have seriously complicated things with downgrading/mixing version release packages
2009-08-17T21:33:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	no, havent tried that yet
2009-08-17T21:33:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	will do
2009-08-17T21:52:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	I tried what the bot gave me, but I am even getting an error just trying to figure out what card my machine is using?!!!!
2009-08-17T21:52:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	So I am both clueless, and fed up at the moment
2009-08-21T14:19:00.000Z	linuxson25	bazhang	did you get my pastebin message?
