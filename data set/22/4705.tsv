2009-04-18T08:14:00.000Z	ArrPirate		that's not specific enough
2009-04-18T08:14:00.000Z	ArrPirate		I have no monitor, DasEi
2009-04-18T08:14:00.000Z	ArrPirate		there's no way for me to see what I need to edit
2009-04-18T08:14:00.000Z	ArrPirate		how would I do that without a monitor?
2009-04-18T08:15:00.000Z	ArrPirate		how can I edit smb.conf the way I need to without being able to see what it contains?
2009-04-18T08:16:00.000Z	ArrPirate		I know what to type to login then I press the hotkey I set up to open a terminal
2009-04-18T08:18:00.000Z	ArrPirate		There is no monitor to see the file I'm going to be editing!
2009-04-18T08:19:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	I'm not sure its possible to do what you are trying. You does the machine with the broken monitor have net access?
2009-04-18T08:20:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	then you could apt-get install openssh-server, and ssh in
2009-04-18T08:40:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	AFAIK the only way would be to edit smb.conf. Did the ssh idea not work?
2009-04-18T08:41:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	from the working machine just type ssh <ip-address>
2009-04-18T08:41:00.000Z	ArrPirate	noodlesgc	I did that.. failed to connect
2009-04-18T08:45:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	you could also turn on remote desktop, and use vnc from the working computer
2009-04-18T08:45:00.000Z	ArrPirate	noodlesgc	how would I do that?
2009-04-18T08:46:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true
2009-04-18T08:48:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	you also have to run: gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/prompt_enabled false
2009-04-18T08:50:00.000Z	ArrPirate	noodlesgc	ok, I typed those two commands, what can I do now?
2009-04-18T08:50:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	is the working machine Windows or Linux?
2009-04-18T08:51:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	ok, you need to download VNCViewer, then you should be able to connect to it
2009-04-18T08:55:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	no problem
2009-04-18T08:58:00.000Z	ArrPirate	noodlesgc	I didn't know setting up vnc was so easy
2009-04-18T08:59:00.000Z	noodlesgc	ArrPirate	Ubuntu makes it pretty easy
