2006-02-26T11:43:00.000Z	syllogism		ok - if I copy a bunch of *.deb packages from one computer to another - how can I get them to be recognized by apt?
2006-02-26T11:44:00.000Z	syllogism		I can't download them all again - this is a dial-up connection
2006-02-26T11:44:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	you don't, not easily anyway
2006-02-26T11:44:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	well...
2006-02-26T11:44:00.000Z	syllogism	LjL	there has got to be a way to do this. .
2006-02-26T11:44:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	i can only think of setting up a local mirror
2006-02-26T11:44:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	well you can certainly install them one by one
2006-02-26T11:45:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	perhaps i would just write a script to do that, i guess it would be easier than setting up a mirror
2006-02-26T11:45:00.000Z	syllogism	LjL	would dpkg manage the dependencies?
2006-02-26T11:45:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	try writing a script like this, "for Package in /directory/containing/packages/*; do dpkg -i "$Package"; done"
2006-02-26T11:46:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	no, it wouldn't. indeed, i was just going to tell you that this script should be run *many times*, until all the dependencies have been solved ;)
2006-02-26T11:46:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	not the cleanest method i could come up with, i guess, but i think it will work
2006-02-26T11:46:00.000Z	syllogism	LjL	sounds horrible. . .   how hard would it be to set up a local mirror?
2006-02-26T11:46:00.000Z	syllogism	LjL	I'll google it - nevermind
2006-02-26T11:47:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	yeah, you should google it, i don't really know. have a look at the "apt-move" package though
2006-02-26T11:48:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	"apt-proxy" too, though that's intended as - you guess - a proxy. but perhaps you could fool it into accepting the packages you already have =)
2006-02-26T11:49:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	but really, i guess apt-move will do most of the work - that is create the directory hierarchy for a mirror. at that point, you can just install an HTTP or FTP server and use it in your sources.list
2006-02-26T11:49:00.000Z	syllogism	LjL	I can probably just set up a local mirror from my laptop. . I've got an ftp server setup already. . shouldn't be too bad
2006-06-14T11:57:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	postgres: actual SQL support :-) MySQL: more widespread
2006-06-14T11:58:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	the faster one i meant mysql.
2006-06-14T11:59:00.000Z	LjL	syllogism	myself, i'd use postgres all day. but it's best to make up your own mind
2006-06-14T12:00:00.000Z	syllogism	LjL	the reason I ask is because I've been trying to cross-compile MySQL for the past 2 days from linux to windows. . it's damn near impossible
