2008-11-18T10:04:00.000Z	codesmith		Hello
2008-11-18T10:05:00.000Z	codesmith		I'm lost
2008-11-18T10:05:00.000Z	codesmith		Where am I?
2008-11-18T10:06:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	only you know the answer to that
2008-11-18T10:14:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	perhaps you've not configured apt to use that repo.  Read those URLs I sent you again.
2008-11-18T10:27:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	again, did you configure it properly in /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2008-11-18T10:29:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	System -> Adminisration -> Software Sources
2008-11-18T10:29:00.000Z	codesmith	tritium	i follow your steps
2008-11-18T10:33:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	did it work?
2008-11-18T10:33:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	then you're likely not doing it right.
2008-11-18T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	see that last URL above
2008-11-18T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	I doubt it is wrong as well.  (in other words, it is correct)
2008-11-18T10:36:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	I don't know what you've done unless you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-11-18T10:38:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	I don't know what you've done unless you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-11-18T10:39:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	did you read the URLs I had ubottu send you?
2008-11-18T10:54:00.000Z	codesmith	tritium	I still can't get index of package
2008-11-18T10:54:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	did you update the package list?
2008-11-18T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	there's your problem.  Follow instructions!
2008-11-18T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	no
2008-11-18T10:56:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	you need to either "sudo apt-get update", or reload in synaptic
2008-11-18T10:59:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	realplayer is in the medibuntu repository.  Please use that instead of Marillat
2008-11-18T11:00:00.000Z	tritium	codesmith	see my comment above
