2011-09-17T23:08:00.000Z	eric357		how is it that apt-cache search php5-mcrypt returns package information but apt-get install php5-mcrypt says: E: Package php5-mcrypt has no installation candidate?
2011-09-17T23:08:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	run sudo apt-get update; if your issue remains, pastebin full input and output when you attempt to install
2011-09-17T23:09:00.000Z	jrib		!flash | r3m
2011-09-17T23:10:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	update was good idea but install still returns the same error
2011-09-17T23:10:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	 pastebin full input and output when you attempt to install
2011-09-17T23:13:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	output is: http://pastebin.com/LwKJL0ee
2011-09-17T23:14:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list*
2011-09-17T23:16:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	pasted at: http://pastebin.com/kcxqk2UC
2011-09-17T23:17:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	what is the result of « uname -m »?
2011-09-17T23:19:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	 it's i686
2011-09-17T23:20:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	Linode running Ubuntu Lucid 10.04.3 LTS
2011-09-17T23:27:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	one second, that seems strange.  Can you pastebin the output of « sudo apt-get update && apt-cache policy php5-mcrypt »?
2011-09-17T23:28:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	I'll do that, hold on.  (yes, seems strange to me too!)
2011-09-17T23:31:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	output is:  http://pastebin.com/BbzNPAyf
2011-09-17T23:32:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	you have some repositories other than the ones in /etc/apt/sources.list enabled.  They're probably in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2011-09-17T23:33:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	also, do you have anything in /etc/apt/preferences*?
2011-09-17T23:34:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	jrib: yes, the file is mercury.list  The pastebin follows momentarily
2011-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	 files are here: http://pastebin.com/xCiBzym8
2011-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	why do you have the karmic repos enabled?
2011-09-17T23:41:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	this is a Linode stack script called pantheon mercury.  I don't know why Karmic repos are enabled
2011-09-17T23:42:00.000Z	jrib	eric357	well there's some sort of attempt to pin the php packages to karmic versions; that's not really supported and is the cause of your problem
2011-09-17T23:43:00.000Z	eric357	jrib	okay, I'll inquire of the stack script maintainer.  Thanks.
