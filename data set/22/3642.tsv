2008-10-15T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	baldur	it's supposed to be fixed in intrepid.  So if you can endure for 2 more weeks, you can upgrade then

2009-01-23T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	baldur	there are known issues with flash and pulseaudio in 8.04.  Any reason for not upgrading to 8.10?
2009-01-23T05:01:00.000Z	baldur	jrib	 there was a url you guys gave me that showed me some command lines to put in to fix it

2009-01-23T05:04:00.000Z	jrib	baldur	if you don't have any reason for wanting to stay on 8.04, I would just upgrade.  Check the release notes and try a live cd before you decide
2009-01-23T05:05:00.000Z	baldur	jrib	 i dont have the live cd
2009-01-23T05:06:00.000Z	jrib	baldur	the live cd is the desktop cd, you can burn a copy
