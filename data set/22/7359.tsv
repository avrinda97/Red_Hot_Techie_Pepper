2006-10-01T15:20:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	"w" tells you all users logged in and their current command
2006-10-01T15:20:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	thx
2006-10-01T15:26:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	it seems to don't work correctly ... under WHAT column i can't see the last command ...
2006-10-01T15:27:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	i told you its the current command. the last command can't be seen.
2006-10-01T15:28:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	that would mean having to read other user's .bash_history files (which is a violation of privacy)
2006-10-01T15:29:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	ok ... i ask this for see what is doing an user connected with ssh on MY pc ... so i think that's no violation of his privacy ...
2006-10-01T15:30:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	if you don't trust a user, why do you give him ssh access to your machine?
2006-10-01T15:31:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	so ... if we are in a big organization with ssh acces is free to all .. we can't control suspected user?
2006-10-01T15:32:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	you could disable his account. are you the admin?
2006-10-01T15:33:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	even the admin has no general right to look into the user's data, depending on the laws in your country.
2006-10-01T15:34:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	where can i find documentation to this law ... i'm italian
2006-10-01T15:35:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	i don't know, i am not from italy.
2006-10-01T15:35:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	mh but maybe you know the name of the law
2006-10-01T15:36:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	i only know the german term "datenschutz", which is for protecting private data from being seen by others
2006-10-01T15:38:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	if you want to restrict a certain users ssh account, you could set up a chroot environment for him, so he only sees part of the filesystem, but its lot of work.
2006-10-01T15:39:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	i think it's not necessary... i asked just to know
2006-10-01T15:40:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	what exactly do you suspect the user is trying?
2006-10-01T15:42:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	nothing ... i asked how to see his last command ... i can't suspect nothing if i have no way to minimally control him... i have no problem with any user .. i asked only if i can monitor their activities
2006-10-01T15:44:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	then use w, who, ps aux, netstat, ... but all those will give you information about current activities, not recent
2006-10-01T15:45:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	oh, i forgot top  (if someone is doing something cpu or memory intensive)
2006-10-01T15:47:00.000Z	TyRiOn-MX	POVaddct	and there is a command to see all the process/application running on my pc and who has launched it?
2006-10-01T15:47:00.000Z	POVaddct	TyRiOn-MX	ps auxww
