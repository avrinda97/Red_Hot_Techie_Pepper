2007-01-04T15:46:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	why are you going to paste? What happens when you click on system-admin-synaptic?
2007-01-04T15:47:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	so, where is the problem?
2007-01-04T15:49:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	yuck, I don't know what to tell you?

2007-01-04T15:53:00.000Z	jonah1980	n2diy	so is there anything i can try to fix it?
2007-01-04T15:53:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	yuck, I don't know what to tell you?
2007-01-04T15:54:00.000Z	jonah1980	n2diy	how would i reisntall it from terminal cos it won't let me in synaptic
2007-01-04T15:55:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	apt-get?
2007-01-04T15:55:00.000Z	jonah1980	n2diy	yeah - what' s the reinstall command and what do i need to reinstall do you think?
2007-01-04T15:56:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	I'd go for synanaptic.
2007-01-04T15:56:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	I'd go for synaptic.
2007-01-04T15:56:00.000Z	jonah1980	n2diy	it won't let me reinstall anything in there
2007-01-04T15:57:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	try apt-get install synaptic?
2007-01-04T15:57:00.000Z	jonah1980	n2diy	no i mean it won't let me reinstall python-dictclient , synaptic itself is working ok, but something wrong with that package
2007-01-04T15:58:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	ah, ok, I don't know what to tell you then?
2007-01-04T15:59:00.000Z	jonah1980	n2diy	ok well thanks anyway
2007-01-04T15:59:00.000Z	n2diy	jonah1980	nada, good luck.
