2010-03-15T09:22:00.000Z	Guest24245		I have a 1.3g file. Whats the absolute fastest way to share it? Dropbox takes forever.
2010-03-15T09:23:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	Dropbox is slow :/ Try uploading to somewhere, best idea would be some filehost with ftp (QShare is one of those, for instance)
2010-03-15T09:23:00.000Z	Guest24245	theadmin	and qshare is fast and easy?
2010-03-15T09:23:00.000Z	Guest24245		I will be sharing with someone who isnt too bright computer speaking
2010-03-15T09:24:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	Fast... quite fast. Easy? Just register, connect to ftp.qshare.com with your name and password trough the menu, and copy the file to "uploads"
2010-03-15T09:24:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	And as for downloading, it's just a link, there one has to click "Free" and "Download the file"
2010-03-15T09:25:00.000Z	Guest24245		thank you theadmin
2010-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	Guest24245	theadmin	the qshare website isnt loading
2010-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	Guest24245		this isnt a good representation of their speed, sir
2010-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	Where exactly are you going? it's qshare.com
2010-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	Guest24245	theadmin	yeah thats where Im going
2010-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	Guest24245		been loading for 5 minutes now and I have a really fast connection
2010-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	Hm, loads in a few seconds over here usually.
2010-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	Guest24245		try it now, if you would
2010-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	Maybe a maintenace, damn them
2010-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	Guest24245		np
2010-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	Guest24245		im uploading to my own ftp
2010-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	Guest24245		not too fast though
2010-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	Ah indeed, according to DFEOJM it's down
2010-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	Guest24245	theadmin	have any other alternative?
2010-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	Guest24245		my ftp is slow as balls too. :<
2010-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest24245	There are a few i know, but they have too much ads on them and limit the speed
