2011-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	what graphics driver did you disable. nvidia or ati
2011-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	make sure there isn't a /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-10-30T23:49:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	ctrl-alt-f1
2011-10-31T00:25:00.000Z	LargePrime	escott	Ctl - Alt -F1 gets no response
2011-10-31T00:34:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	if you can't ctrl-alt-f1 then your system is probably locked up. does the capslock light work
2011-10-31T00:37:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	if you have a recovery console you should work from there
2011-10-31T00:39:00.000Z	LargePrime	escott	I m in the recover CLI, but i an a bit CLI disabled
2011-10-31T00:40:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	so first ls /etc/X11/*.conf and does it list any files there
2011-10-31T00:41:00.000Z	LargePrime	escott	 after logging in the CLI does not respond
2011-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	so ls[ENTER] doesn't respond
2011-10-31T00:46:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	but you had the login/password dialogs and they seemed to work
2011-10-31T00:47:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	and this was the recovery console without the gui that locked up
2011-10-31T00:49:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	im skeptical because this seems unlikely if you got past the login there isn't much that should be able to cause the system to lockup like that. but its going to be a pain to fix if it really isn't working from a recovery console
2011-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	LargePrime	escott	have you a moment?
2011-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	sure
2011-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	LVM is useful if you plan to expand/shrink/move partitions, otherwise its not that useful
2011-10-31T01:17:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	makes booting a bit harder + some performance cost, but probably minimal performance issues
2011-10-31T01:53:00.000Z	LargePrime	escott	can you recommend a ssh windows client for use with ubuntu
2011-10-31T01:53:00.000Z	escott	LargePrime	putty
2011-10-31T02:17:00.000Z	LargePrime	escott	do you have a VNC recommendation too?  Please and thank you.
2011-10-31T02:25:00.000Z	LargePrime	escott	do you have a VNC client recommendation too?  Please and thank you.
