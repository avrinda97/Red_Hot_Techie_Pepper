2012-09-12T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	s/and/add
2012-09-12T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	how did you edit the crontab and whose crontab is it?
2012-09-12T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	"mine" is too vague
2012-09-12T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	pastebin the script
2012-09-12T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	also, try Steve^'s date suggestion.  What version of ubuntu is this?
2012-09-12T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	you're determining that it's not working fine because there is no output to the .log file?
2012-09-12T01:40:00.000Z	Kamilion_	jrib	no output in *THREE* logfiles.
2012-09-12T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	which 3?
2012-09-12T01:41:00.000Z	Kamilion_	jrib	the three I'm trying to write to -- one in the powerquery.sh, one in power_mgr.sh, and one from the crontab itself :<
2012-09-12T01:41:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	do you happen to be using encrypted home directories?
2012-09-12T01:41:00.000Z	Kamilion_	jrib	nope
2012-09-12T01:45:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	if you pastebin the script, it would be helpful
2012-09-12T01:53:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	you could have just typed it out by now :)
2012-09-12T01:53:00.000Z	Kamilion_	jrib	but I assume he was more interested in what the hell I'm actually doing.
2012-09-12T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	haha what on earth am I looking at
2012-09-12T02:03:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	skynet... great.  (But the text is not readable in your picture)
2012-09-12T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	are you sure it's not an issue with your PATH?  The PATH in crontab is not the same as the PATH you get when you log in
2012-09-12T02:05:00.000Z	jrib	Kamilion_	make the font size huge :)
2012-09-12T02:05:00.000Z	Kamilion_	jrib	... hmmm... okay, well, then lemme try something. *sticks echo $PATH in place of 'date'*
