2010-08-13T01:16:00.000Z	janicko		need help to extract exe file, but wine didn't help me
2010-08-13T01:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	What do you mean by "extract"? Is it a self extracting archive?
2010-08-13T01:17:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	actually it is instaling program for wireless router and need to open it for installing it on ubuntu
2010-08-13T01:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	I doubt it's needed, have you tried just connecting via ethernet and going to "192.168.1.1" in a web browser to configure the router?
2010-08-13T01:21:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	my problem is i do not know how to install it. It seems it not recognize it and i had advice i should try to windows wireless drivers. and from there i am stuck
2010-08-13T01:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	Are you trying to get your wireless card working, your wireless router working, or both?
2010-08-13T01:23:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	both, for now i have no succes
2010-08-13T01:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	If you can work on them separately that will simplify things greatly. Do you have an already configured wireless router available to use while working on getting your wireless card working?
2010-08-13T01:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	What have you done so far in Ubuntu for configuring things? If you can't remember everything you've done then I think it's work initially debugging from a LiveCD as it's a known environment.
2010-08-13T01:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	*worth
2010-08-13T01:30:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	I just installed windows wirelles driver and than i don't know how to move on. Need help very badly
2010-08-13T01:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	You probably didn't need to install windows wireless drivers. Can you run "lspci" in a terminal and pastebin the output?
2010-08-13T01:34:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	where or what is output (sorry for my stupidity)
2010-08-13T01:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	"output" is what a command prints to the screen when you run it from a terminal.
2010-08-13T01:37:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	ok got it. where you want to paste it again?
2010-08-13T01:41:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	done it
2010-08-13T01:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	You need to post the URL for the paste here.
2010-08-13T01:42:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	   silly me     http://paste.ubuntu.com/477125/
2010-08-13T01:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	Is it a USB wireless dongle?
2010-08-13T01:45:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	I don't think so. I have usb dongle in but it is Belkin, not Nvidia
2010-08-13T01:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	janicko	A USB dongle would not show up in "lspci"
2010-08-13T01:47:00.000Z	janicko	Jordan_U	so what now?
