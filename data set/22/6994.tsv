2011-09-08T23:39:00.000Z	nathanel		hello guys! need help on making a symlink for two different targets in two different directories
2011-09-08T23:41:00.000Z	nathanel		help?
2011-09-08T23:42:00.000Z	nathanel		hello guys! need help on making a symlink for two different targets in two different directories...
2011-09-08T23:43:00.000Z	nathanel		making a single link for ibus-anthy.png that directs to both faenza and faenza-dark
2011-09-08T23:44:00.000Z	nathanel		i need simultaneous targets.. is that even possible?
2011-09-08T23:45:00.000Z	nathanel		have the proper embedded link to each theme on theme change for the ibus-anthy indicator
2011-09-08T23:46:00.000Z	nathanel		ok
2011-09-08T23:48:00.000Z	nathanel		ibus-anthy has its indicator icon located in /usr/share/ibus/anthy/icons/ibus/anthy.png, since there can only be one ibus-anthy.png, i am trying to link multiple status icons to that same file ( fanza/status/ and faenza-dark/status)
2011-09-08T23:49:00.000Z	jrib	nathanel	yes, but WHY
2011-09-08T23:50:00.000Z	nathanel		i would like anthy to use the faenza status icons for ibus-kbd status when activated or deactivated and keep theme consistency (its a fix)
2011-09-08T23:50:00.000Z	jrib	nathanel	this is an ibus-anthy configuration question
2011-09-08T23:50:00.000Z	nathanel		no.. a faenza icon theme symlink question
2011-09-08T23:51:00.000Z	nathanel		and an ubuntu one also since i do not know how to symlink multiple file to a same target or single target to multiple files... would that be a 3-way link?
2011-09-08T23:52:00.000Z	nathanel		ok
2011-09-08T23:52:00.000Z	jrib	nathanel	this is not possible.  Give up on this idea. You need to just ask the actual question regarding ibus-anthy and icons
2011-09-08T23:53:00.000Z	nathanel		1 symlink to two files
2011-09-08T23:53:00.000Z	nathanel		i want anthy to use faenxza.. not the ugly icon provided
2011-09-08T23:54:00.000Z	nathanel		ok.. understood
2011-09-08T23:55:00.000Z	nathanel		any way to trick the ibus-anthy.png in doing so by some sort of 3-way link?
2011-09-08T23:56:00.000Z	jrib	nathanel	ok  I'm trying to understand better what you are asking: is your issue that you sometimes use the faenza theme and sometimes you use the faenza-dark theme?  Furthermore, you want the ibus-anthy icon to be a faenza icon when you have the faenza icon enabled.  But if you change your theme to faenza dark, then you want ibus-anthy to have a faenza dark icon?
2011-09-08T23:57:00.000Z	nathanel		the application, by default uses the icon located at /usr/share/ibus-anthy/icons/ibus-anthy.png
2011-09-08T23:57:00.000Z	nathanel	jrib	exactly
