2006-05-27T11:46:00.000Z	Desh		Can anyone help me? I am logged in as root@(none) and need to change my passwd
2006-05-27T11:46:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	If you are as root you can use "su username" to access your accound then "passwd newpassword"
2006-07-13T10:39:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	Probably that is just the name of the X extension. Many drivers don't support DRI (it's maily Free ones that do support it)
2006-07-13T10:40:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	That would kind of defeat the point :)
2006-07-13T10:40:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	I am confudes :(
2006-07-13T10:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	You on Nvidia?
2006-07-13T10:42:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	Free ATI drivers support DRI (on Radeon 9200 and below). I think FGLRX supports it too, but I'm not sure
2006-07-13T10:42:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	:( I have a mobility 9700
2006-07-13T10:54:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	It is loading the driver
2006-07-13T10:54:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	in this case: radeon?
2006-07-13T10:54:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	it is supposed to load "ati" not "radeon"
2006-07-13T10:54:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	The radeon driver doesn't have 3D on your card (I think)
2006-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	ATI is a Free 2D driver, radeon is a 3D (usually) Free driver and fglrx is a 3D non-Free driver
2006-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	but in xorg.conf I set it to use ati not radeon, why would it load radeon?
2006-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	How do I check the driver being useed?
2006-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	No idea sorry (I've only been using an ATI for a few weeks)
2006-07-13T11:02:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	386 is an ancient model of PC processor
2006-07-13T11:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	ATI and Radeon drivers WILL NOT give DRI on your card. Fglrx may
2006-07-16T11:01:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	Close any synaptic/update manager/aptitude/whatever else uses apt and try again
2006-07-16T11:01:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	same thing
2006-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	Desh	Warbo	What is this DbDriver? This came up after removing libperl-qt which gave me another error. >_<!
2006-07-16T11:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Desh	I don't know (DB=database maybe?)
