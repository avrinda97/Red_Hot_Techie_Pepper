2007-11-27T07:55:00.000Z	Silmeria		you can test it before you install o.O
2007-11-27T07:57:00.000Z	Silmeria		you can test it before you install o.O?
2007-11-27T07:57:00.000Z	Silmeria		whoops
2007-11-27T07:58:00.000Z	Silmeria		all i need is a '/' partition and a '/home' partition for ubuntu manual install, right?
2007-11-27T07:59:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	when isntalling I put my system on / to a 8gb-10gb partition the n I put my /home to a partition of the rest of the drive space
2007-11-27T08:00:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	ideally
2007-11-27T08:00:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	then you can fresh install over / partition with nerw veriosn and keep all your home files
2007-11-27T08:00:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	which prevent you from having to setup everything again
2007-11-27T08:01:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	yes there is a limit for diminshing returns
2007-11-27T08:01:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	my assumption is that anything mor than double your real ram is too much
2007-11-27T08:03:00.000Z	Silmeria	airtonix	your swap or '/'?
2007-11-27T08:04:00.000Z	Silmeria	airtonix	how big is your '/' and '/home', or is asking that redundant?
2007-11-27T08:12:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	you have better luck getting bigdesktop going at least
2007-11-27T08:12:00.000Z	Silmeria	airtonix	 have no clue what that means
2007-11-27T08:20:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	home is the same as windows document & settings folder
2007-11-27T08:20:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	so if you put the /home folder on a antoher physical drive or partition....all the user accounts you make will go under that folder...protected of course
2007-11-27T08:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	I wouldn't
2007-11-27T08:21:00.000Z	Silmeria	airtonix	=o
2007-11-27T08:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	like I said before
2007-11-27T08:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	10g for '/' , 1g for swap, rest of space for /home
2007-11-27T08:22:00.000Z	Silmeria	airtonix	thanks. i think ill do that.
2007-11-27T08:28:00.000Z	airtonix	Silmeria	np
