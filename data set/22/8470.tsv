2005-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	jcsteele		is the breezy PR of ubuntu just ONE iso image...or is a new ISO built when bugs are fixed?
2005-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	what is PR?
2005-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	ompaul		ahh RC release candidate
2005-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	ompaul		or am I missing something
2005-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	jcsteele		i.e. i am having serious issues with a 3COM 3C509B NIC and cannot get any network connectivity with the latest release....the hardware works fine, because if i install hoary, it works fine...it also works fine with other OS's
2005-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	jcsteele		ok...so its a waste of bandwidth to download a new image then...
2005-10-14T15:19:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	you could report that as a bug
2005-10-14T15:19:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	s/could/should/
2005-10-14T15:19:00.000Z	jcsteele	ompaul	i cannot obtain enough information todo so...and i am not sure as to WHY its happening.
2005-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	jcsteele		i think it has something todo with irq's....but nothing is confirmed.
2005-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	get it out there - it works with X not with Y no one can fix it otherwise
2005-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	jcsteele		i did recompile and build a new image with some printf's stuck in the irq handling code for debugging purposes...but it didn't help any.
2005-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	jcsteele	ompaul	well, my report isn't going to help anyone...it would be too vague.
2005-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	did you do a grep for the hardware name in the source of breezy and hoary
2005-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	jcsteele		which is why i was seeing if there was an "updated" image
2005-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	jcsteele	ompaul	not hoary
2005-10-14T15:21:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	there is a daily build
2005-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	jcsteele	ompaul	i just reinstalled hoary to confirm the nic did indeed work.
2005-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	jcsteele	ompaul	does breezy support serial console output?
2005-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	aint tried it
2005-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	jcsteele	ompaul	i might check this route next....i have been beating my head against this for about 2 days now though, and i am very tempted to just wait for the final release to see if its been fixed.
2005-10-14T15:24:00.000Z	ompaul	jcsteele	do this, compare the source of haory AND breezy for drivers for your friend and see if it got dropped
