2010-08-14T18:16:00.000Z	lsottani		strange is that i installed 10.04 once, and it worked, apart the wireless
2010-08-14T18:18:00.000Z	coz_	lsottani	 how was jolicloud by the way??
2010-08-14T18:18:00.000Z	lsottani		i am trying to install joli atm, alongside ubuntu
2010-08-14T18:18:00.000Z	lsottani	coz_	great until 0.99
2010-08-14T18:18:00.000Z	lsottani		1.0 sucks
2010-08-14T18:18:00.000Z	lsottani		looks retarded
2010-08-14T18:18:00.000Z	coz_	lsottani	  ooo ok   It sounded interesting last time I looked
2010-08-14T18:19:00.000Z	lsottani		project is interesting. but is not very good for mid-experience users
2010-08-14T18:19:00.000Z	coz_	lsottani	  have you tried the netbook for gnome or kde's  netbook version which is  very nice??
2010-08-14T18:19:00.000Z	lsottani		newbies: great, you do not have to do nothing. experts: isuppose that they can tweak something... mid users are stuck
2010-08-14T18:19:00.000Z	lsottani		no coz_
2010-08-14T18:20:00.000Z	coz_	lsottani	  kde"s  netbook version is visually nice and works much better in my opinion than gnome's
2010-08-14T18:20:00.000Z	coz_	lsottani	  google screenshots and maybe youtube video
