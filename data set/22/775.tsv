2011-03-20T03:58:00.000Z	bAdSystems		I was called to Freenode chatroom #ubuntu by the one known as nictrasavios. My brother informed me of an issue, how may i be of service.
2011-03-20T03:59:00.000Z	bAdSystems		Are the ones who require my assistance here? or shall i take my leave.
2011-03-20T04:00:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	bAdSystems	Are you a multi-system expert?
2011-03-20T04:00:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	bAdSystems	yes, that's me.
2011-03-20T04:01:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	Yes i am. I am knowlageable in Unix, Linux and DOS systems, aswell as all their roots.
2011-03-20T04:01:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	what seems to be your issue.
2011-03-20T04:02:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	bAdSystems	  I have a big Vista partition, and I need to get my big files (like mysql databases) onto my big Vista NTFS partition
2011-03-20T04:02:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	why not resize the partitions? or e
2011-03-20T04:02:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	bAdSystems	I mounted my Vista partion in fstab as # NTFS Windows VistapPartition (?)
2011-03-20T04:03:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	bAdSystems	Because UltraDefrag couldn't move some stuff near the end
2011-03-20T04:04:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	i would do a full system defrag on windows, then use gParted to shrink. But that is besides the point. What is the issue you are having, it its most simple form of explanation.
2011-03-20T04:05:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	bAdSystems	I'm trying to follow these instructions to move my databases, but the chmod doesn't take ... http://www.ubuntu-howto.info/howto/how-to-move-mysql-databases-to-another-location-partition-or-hard-drive
2011-03-20T04:07:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	this stinks of a problem i had on my very first ubuntu installation. I was unable to change any permissions for a few arbitrary files.
2011-03-20T04:07:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	hmm. So your trying to move your database from one Linux to the next.
2011-03-20T04:09:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	 it never came back, but anyway. So your moving the database from one linux to the next? I belive NS said you were trying to move it to windows?
2011-03-20T04:11:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	 i could not make out his words, he seems in a hurry. But if he was correct, then i must inform you that you cannot simply "copy and paste" your database from one system to the next. Only if the systems are of the same operating system.
2011-03-20T04:11:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	you would have to export your database, rebuild your configuration, then import your database back in.
2011-03-20T04:11:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	bAdSystems	I see.
2011-03-20T04:12:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	with but few exceptions, you cannot simply take somthing working in linux, and copy it into windows. For more reasons then it is worth listing.
2011-03-20T04:14:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	if at all possible, i would find a equal or better to all your windows needs, then delete vista and become a "pure" ubuntu user. As someone who uses all three systems everyday... i can say with great confidence that windows is, and always will be, a horrible system to its very core. From the kernel to the userland, it wreaks of horrible code.
2011-03-20T04:15:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	windows was never ment to be used in todays world, it was build to be a stand alone system, with no internet. You set it up, and use it. Everything put into it was ment to be put in via CD or other input. Thus, it cannot survive in a modern world.
2011-03-20T04:16:00.000Z	bAdSystems	HelloWorld321	if you must use it, i suggest virtual box.  Anyway , i must take my leave. I am needed elsewhere.
