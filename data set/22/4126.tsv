2008-04-11T17:03:00.000Z	zeno_	unop_	tried, it says no canidate version
2008-04-11T17:03:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	doesn't look like you have the latest package lists and/or don't have the multiverse repository enabled
2008-04-11T17:04:00.000Z	zeno_	unop_	synaptic says its enabled
2008-04-11T17:04:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	try this. sudo sh -c "aptitude update; aptitude install sun-java5-jre"
2008-04-11T17:05:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	let's have a look at your /etc/apt/sources.list -- use the !pastebin for that
2008-04-11T17:10:00.000Z	zeno_	unop_	http://pastebin.com/m32cae68a
2008-04-11T17:13:00.000Z	zeno_	unop_	does it look okay?
2008-04-11T17:13:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	what does this return?  apt-cache policy sun-java5-bin
2008-04-11T17:13:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	i can't find anything that might be the cause of the problem
2008-04-11T17:15:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	hmm, run this command and inlcude it's output in a !paste.  sudo aptitude update
2008-04-11T17:16:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	you should be able to get the powerpc port from sun's website
2008-04-11T17:17:00.000Z	zeno_	unop_	http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php
2008-04-11T17:18:00.000Z	unop_	zeno_	that appears blank but anyway, no need for that now, you need to manually install java
