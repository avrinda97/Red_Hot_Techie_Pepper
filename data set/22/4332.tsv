2009-11-20T03:41:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		When I go to facebook.com Firefox tells me it needs to download a plugin but doesnt tell me which one. It fails to find the right plugin, so how do I work out which plugin to manually install? I already have Java, Helix, Shockwave Flash and Silverlight so I'm wondering what else it could be
2009-11-20T03:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	Have you installed flash?
2009-11-20T03:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	you're on Hardy?
2009-11-20T03:52:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ardchoille	Yep
2009-11-20T03:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	I have been installing flashplugin-nonfree for several ubuntu versions and it's worked well in firefox. Mabe try that package and restart firefox
2009-11-20T03:54:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ardchoille	Hardy is the latest release that my computer can run. I have tried Intrepid, Jaunty and Karmic and none of them work: on all of them the graphics are borked.
2009-11-20T03:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	Ah, ok
2009-11-20T03:54:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ardchoille	I have both flashplugin-nonfree and adobe-flashplugin. Do you think it could be a conflict between the two of them?
2009-11-20T03:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	Maybe, try uninstalling the Adobe package and see. you can always reinstall it if that isn't the problem
2009-11-20T03:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	Also, make sure you're running the latest firefox from the repos
2009-11-20T03:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	And I feel that it would be worth it to you to try and get the graphics running correctly on maybe Jaunty, this channel is the best place to ask questions
2009-11-20T03:59:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ardchoille	That was going to be my next question. I installed swiftfox from  the http://getswiftfox.com/builds/debian unstable non-free repo and for some reason it doesnt want to update. By the way, I spent more than 40 hours trying to get graphics to work correctly on both Jaunty and Karmic before going back to good old Hardy.
2009-11-20T03:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	It's a good idea to stick with Ubuntu packages, you have installed a debian package and these two distros are different. Never mix distro packages
2009-11-20T04:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	The only updates you will get are the ones coming from the official ubuntu repos and any PPA's that you have in your sources
2009-11-20T04:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	maybe there haven't been any updates? Regardless, you are using a debian repo in your sources and that's a bad thing to do on Ubuntu
2009-11-20T04:05:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ardchoille	There have been updates but none have ever been downloaded. I will remove the repo I guess. Trouble is firefox is just so damn slow! I was keen to get it faster any way I could.
2009-11-20T04:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	May I pm you? I have some things you can do to make ff faster
2009-11-20T04:07:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ardchoille	Oh. I have just tried to download the deb file for the latest version directly from the swiftfox website and the package installer reports a dependency is not satisfiable: libgtk2.0-0. Yes of course you can pm me. Thanks.
2009-11-20T04:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	that is one of the reasons we don't add debian reops to ubuntu sources :)
2009-11-20T04:08:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	ardchoille	OK
2009-11-20T04:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	that dependency maybe in the ubuntu repos for you but I think the name is different
2009-11-20T04:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	JonathanEllis	chromium is supposed to be a very ice and fast web browser, I've never tried it but you might want to. I have ways of speeding up firefox if you're interested
