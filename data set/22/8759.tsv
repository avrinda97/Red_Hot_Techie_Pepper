2005-06-09T15:34:00.000Z	Raskall		Ahh.. got a job today. It feels good to be on my way to the working life again after 18 months of doing nothing but change diapers.
2005-06-09T15:35:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	I've got my first due in a month.
2005-06-09T15:35:00.000Z	_seth		What do you use?
2005-06-09T15:35:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	:) I am a bit over qualified for this job, but its a job. its a first line support job. I have 4 years of college and 12 years of working experience.
2005-06-09T15:36:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	I'm a student right now, paying my way through as a waiter, with no expirence what so ever...
2005-06-09T15:37:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	I did get a job offer in the IT department at MVP, a large insurance agency in my area.
2005-06-09T15:37:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	:) you should have my job, then. It's, as mentioned, a helpdesk job for a dsl provider.
2005-06-09T15:37:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	sounds exciting.
2005-06-09T15:37:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	wouldn't happen to be Verizon, would it?
2005-06-09T15:38:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	if so, I have to say, you will most likely be getting a call from me a lot bitching about my line being down.
2005-06-09T15:39:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	nope.. this is in norway. Tele2.
2005-06-09T15:39:00.000Z	_seth		Ah, gotcha.
2005-06-09T15:39:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	I need to be in my third semester to actually take the job at MVP, but I know the guy that runs the IT department. I might see if he can pull some strings.
2005-06-09T15:41:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	nice to know you have a job waiting when you are through school, isnt it?
2005-06-09T15:41:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	it's very nice, especially since the kid is almost here. Sure, I still have a while left in school, but by the time he is 2, I'll be setup with a NICE paying job/
2005-06-09T15:41:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	I worked in the army's it department a year right after school. was quite cool (and 11 years ago. Dammit, I'm old)
2005-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	:) nice.
2005-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	Norwegian army?
2005-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	yes. at the department for the national guard.
2005-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	_seth	Raskall	cool. I was in the military also.
2005-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	in norway all males must go to the army for at least 1 year.
2005-06-09T15:44:00.000Z	Raskall	_seth	the only way to get out of it is to be a pacifist or have very bad health. but if you're a pacifist you have to do community work for 18 months.
