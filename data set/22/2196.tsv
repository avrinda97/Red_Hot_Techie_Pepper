2009-08-25T21:41:00.000Z	seezer	simran	should be in your menu too. don't know about gnome. i'm here for testing purpuses only ;)
2009-08-25T21:42:00.000Z	simran	seezer	when i type nvclock-gtk into terminal it says command not found
2009-08-25T21:42:00.000Z	seezer	simran	that's why i'm asking you to type: nvclock_gtk
2009-08-25T21:42:00.000Z	seezer		not -gtk
2009-08-25T21:43:00.000Z	simran		coool seezer it works
2009-08-25T21:43:00.000Z	simran	seezer	do you have an nvidia chipset
2009-08-25T21:43:00.000Z	seezer	simran	only on my graphics card
2009-08-25T21:44:00.000Z	simran	seezer	do you use a laptopo
2009-08-25T21:44:00.000Z	seezer	simran	yes i do, but nvclock is only on my desktop
2009-08-25T21:45:00.000Z	simran	seezer	can nvclock adjust my monitor brightness (not desktop brightness)...because the gnome power brightness applet doenst work on nvidia chipset
2009-08-25T21:45:00.000Z	seezer	simran	i guess not
2009-08-25T21:46:00.000Z	seezer	simran	but i only use the fan adjustment
2009-08-25T21:47:00.000Z	simran	seezer	where is the option to do that, i dont see it
2009-08-25T21:47:00.000Z	seezer	simran	in overclocking or something
