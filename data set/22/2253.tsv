2009-08-29T08:52:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Okay, what are you planning to do?
2009-08-29T08:52:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	There is nothing such as a "blank iso".
2009-08-29T08:53:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Often, the better answer is to show a better approach than to answer that direct question.
2009-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	gartral	bankix	it would be nice if i could have a iso mounted with the archive mounter, that "burns itself" when i dismount it...
2009-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	That's why I'm askin what you're planning to do.
2009-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Ah, like under macos?
2009-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	gartral	bankix	wouldn't know, i never use mac
2009-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Just say "new CD", drag everything there, and burn it when ejecting?
2009-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	gartral	bankix	ya
2009-08-29T08:55:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Hmm, I fear that's actually not implemented that way.
2009-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	You yould open brasero, create a new CD project, drag everything to that window and press burn when you're finished.
2009-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Hmmm, wait a moment...
2009-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	gartral	bankix	kinda defeats the point, seeing as i was hoping to use this to backup a headless server (eventually_
2009-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Nope, then that's no solution for you.
2009-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	The way is to create an empty directory, copy (or link) everything there you want to backup, and then start burning
2009-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Why do you need this "burn on eject" feature?
2009-08-29T08:59:00.000Z	gartral	bankix	primarily causer i backup twice a day due to frequency of power failure in my building lately
2009-08-29T09:00:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	_maybe_ there is a way. But you'll have to script this all yourself.
2009-08-29T09:00:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	AFAIK there is a signal, maybe from hal, dbus or even udev, when pressing the open button of the drive. Which normally unmounts the disk and ejects it.
2009-08-29T09:01:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	Instead of unmounting, you could start burning and eject the disk afterwards.
2009-08-29T09:01:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	But you'll have to find that signal first, catch it, and write the scripts for burning.
2009-08-29T09:02:00.000Z	bankix	gartral	What about running the backup and burning the CD on certain times? Let's say, on 10am and 16pm?
