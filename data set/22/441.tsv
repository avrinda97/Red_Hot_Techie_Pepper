2011-09-30T12:13:00.000Z	Sulejman		hi, I have a question. I've been using irssi IRC client lately, set on my friend's computer. Have been connecting to the session using PuTTy. However, I've quit from irssi and cannot get back. when I type /screen -r [screenadress] I shows I've got 2 screens attached. Don't know what to do. Could you help me?
2011-09-30T12:15:00.000Z	Sulejman		could anyone help?
2011-09-30T12:17:00.000Z	Sulejman		could anyone help?
2011-09-30T12:18:00.000Z	enchilado	Sulejman	I don't really know a lot about screen, but isn't there a way you can specify which session to reattach?
2011-09-30T12:19:00.000Z	Sulejman	enchilado	there is, it shows I've got 2 attached sessions, but I don't know if it is possible/how to get to them
2011-09-30T12:19:00.000Z	Sulejman		also I don't know how to start a new session
2011-09-30T12:19:00.000Z	Sulejman		yeah, a know, I'm really a beginner
2011-09-30T12:20:00.000Z	enchilado		the -r option is for reattaching, isn't it? So to start a new session you just leave it out... I think.
2011-09-30T12:21:00.000Z	Sulejman	enchilado	 and what can I do with the 'attached' screen?
2011-09-30T12:22:00.000Z	enchilado		Is the session attached on your friend's computer still?
2011-09-30T12:22:00.000Z	enchilado		AFAIK you need to detach it from there first
2011-09-30T12:22:00.000Z	Sulejman	enchilado	it seems so
2011-09-30T12:22:00.000Z	enchilado		with -d
2011-09-30T12:22:00.000Z	Sulejman		won't it delete the session?
2011-09-30T12:24:00.000Z	enchilado	Sulejman	uhm, I'm not sure. I didn't think so but I haven't used screen in that way.
2011-09-30T12:24:00.000Z	enchilado		I only have one computer :S
2011-09-30T12:24:00.000Z	enchilado		Was there a split earlier?
2011-09-30T12:27:00.000Z	Sulejman		oh
2011-09-30T12:27:00.000Z	Sulejman		somehow I've made it xD
2011-09-30T12:28:00.000Z	Sulejman		probably will start a new session
2011-09-30T12:28:00.000Z	Sulejman	enchilado	I've found a command to start irssi once again, so I'll start a new session.
2011-09-30T12:29:00.000Z	Sulejman	enchilado	thanks for your attention
