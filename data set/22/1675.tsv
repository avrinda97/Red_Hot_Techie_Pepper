2010-02-20T14:34:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	Hello again :P
2010-02-20T14:36:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	ext3
2010-02-20T14:36:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	How would I go about doing that?
2010-02-20T14:38:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 Make sure it's unmounted(!!! important). Then 'e2fsck -fv [drive location]' << will scan for errors. Add the -y switch to that command to fix the errors
2010-02-20T14:39:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	How do I know where the drive is located if I don't have it mounted?
2010-02-20T14:39:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 'sudo fdisk -l'
2010-02-20T15:30:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 I wish there was but couldn't find a way. I just put something heavy on the enter key lol
2010-02-20T15:30:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	:P
2010-02-20T15:30:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 If after a while 'Enter' doesn't work anymore, press 'y' and vice versa.
2010-02-20T15:31:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	Hey, if I'm getting ALLOT of inode error being fixed... does that mean I'm going to find all my files in the lost+found folder?
2010-02-20T15:32:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 Hmmm not so sure, I was recovering all my files from a crash just yesterday. Lost patience with holding Enter (too many inodes) and found _some_ files to be in Lost+Found.
2010-02-20T15:33:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	So most were fine?
2010-02-20T15:34:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 It was so effed up I couldn't even mount it. Had to use 'R-Linux' from a Windows environment to recover what was left, so I'm not really sure of what happened heh :/
2010-02-20T15:34:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	BUT WERE THE FILES OK? Sorry, I'm kinda freaking out right now :(
2010-02-20T15:37:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 Some were. I lost a hella of a lot actually. Most valuable of which are FFx config, Krusader config and my Pics folder. But not such a big deal :/
2010-02-20T15:37:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 You should try R-Linux before you 'change' anything to be safe.
2010-02-20T15:38:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	I have allot to lose and I'v already started the fsck :/
2010-02-20T15:39:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 Abort safely while you can and try R-Linux. Recover what you want to be safe. Then fix with fsck and the like.
2010-02-20T15:40:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 Brother it's best to keep backups.... I learnt the hard way :(
2010-02-20T15:40:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	How do I abort safely?
2010-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	RPG-Master	NewWorld	...This is my external hard drive I use for backing up... and I was just about to reinstall ubuntu and restore the back up :'(
2010-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	NewWorld	RPG-Master	 Ctrl+C will abort it... as long as it's just fixing inodes and that little stuff that ain't dangerous. I hope you get your files back
