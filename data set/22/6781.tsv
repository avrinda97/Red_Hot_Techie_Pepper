2007-05-02T05:10:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 on all 3 drivers i get "display: :0  screen: 0
2007-05-02T16:54:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	sudo sh -c 'echo fglrx >>/etc/modules'
2007-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	this is the permanent solution. For now, you can also just run 'sudo modprobe fglrx'. See if that throws an error.
2007-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	agresor@agresor:~$ sudo modprobe fglrx
2007-05-02T16:56:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	okay, something's wrong then. Do you have an ATI card?
2007-05-02T16:57:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 Yes i use ATI radeon 9200
2007-05-02T16:59:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	those devices aren't supported by fglrx any more. Use the xorg driver (try both Driver "ati" and Driver "radeon", one of them should work with some level of acceleration).

2007-05-02T05:01:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 tell me can i use OpenGL with my 9200 or need to change Graphic Card ?
2007-05-02T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	I don't know. You have to try it out with the ati or radeon driver.
2007-05-02T05:04:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 done with "radeon"  how to test my graphic OpenGL now ?
2007-05-02T05:07:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	is this with ati or radeon?
2007-05-02T05:08:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 it is "radeon"  here is log : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18701/
2007-05-02T05:09:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	okay, you haven't got dri with radeon. Try ati instead.
2007-05-02T05:09:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 ati was my old driver... no success with it... :(
2007-05-02T05:10:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	sorry, no acceleration with your card then. You won't be able to play advanced 3D games
2007-05-02T05:11:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 what Graphic card do you suggest me  at least 9500 ?
2007-05-02T05:12:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	all current consumer graphics cards are more or less crabby with Linux. Your best bet is NVidia.
2007-05-02T05:15:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 if i change my graphic card to Nvidia should i have problem to install drivers for it  ? Or have to reinstall OS ?
2007-05-02T05:16:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	no problem. Switch to the vesa driver before you make the change. After that, follow ubuntu help for installing the nvidia driver
2007-05-02T05:17:00.000Z	agresor	soundray	 Device  "vesa" ?
2007-05-02T05:17:00.000Z	soundray	agresor	Driver "vesa"
