2007-02-09T11:31:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	thanks, i'll try installing that plugin
2007-02-09T11:36:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	it complained that I need GLIB installed but i tried installing libglib2.0-0 and it says I already have the latest version
2007-02-09T11:36:00.000Z	kitche	tabber	you need the -dev package
2007-02-09T11:36:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	yeah i tried that too and it's also installed
2007-02-09T11:37:00.000Z	kitche	tabber	what version of glib does it need also
2007-02-09T11:38:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	it gives this error when i do ./configure: "checking for GLIB - version >= 1.2.2... no"
2007-02-09T11:39:00.000Z	kitche	tabber	ok hmm glib2 should eb enough try the libglib1.2 and it's -dev package
2007-02-09T11:40:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	it also said this: " The glib-config script installed by GLIB could not be found" and "If GLIB was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in you path"
2007-02-09T11:41:00.000Z	kitche	tabber	try the libglib1.2 package and see if that works
2007-02-09T11:41:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	ok ill try that
2007-02-09T11:41:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	both the libglib and -dev, right?
2007-02-09T11:42:00.000Z	kitche	tabber	yes
2007-02-09T11:49:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	ok glib solved, now it says this "checking for XMMS - version >= 1.2.4... no" i have version 1.2.10
2007-02-09T11:49:00.000Z	kitche	tabber	hmm odd maybe it's looking for the -dev package
2007-02-09T11:51:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	now this "configure: error: *** MAC lib headers not installed"
2007-02-09T11:52:00.000Z	kitche	tabber	hmm not sure about that
2007-02-09T11:53:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	hmmm ;(
2007-02-09T12:00:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	fixed it, I installed mac-port hopefully i can compile it now
2007-02-09T12:02:00.000Z	tabber	kitche	xmms quits when i try opening the file :(
