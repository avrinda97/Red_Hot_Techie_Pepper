2011-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	Deltatash		Hi can anyone give me a hand with Virtualbox on Ubuntu 10.4 I cant seem to get a command working, I am trying to use this in terminal "VBoxManage setextradata “VM name” “CustomVideoMode1″ “1280×800×32”
2011-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	Deltatash		but I get VBoxManage: error: Could not find a registered machine named '“VM name”
2011-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	Deltatash		any ideas what is wrong ?
2011-11-24T01:54:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	  Did you type in the correct machine name?
2011-11-24T01:56:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 Are you running this on a Server or Desktop?
2011-11-24T01:57:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 Can you launch VirtualBox and look at Manager?
2011-11-24T01:57:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	What is the name of the VM you are trying to manage on the left?
2011-11-24T01:58:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 No spaces or special characters?
2011-11-24T01:59:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 What command are you attempting to run?
2011-11-24T02:01:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 What output do you get from "VBoxManage list"?
2011-11-24T02:04:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 Try your command without the quotes around the machine name...
2011-11-24T02:11:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 Can you change the resolution in the actual VM?
2011-11-24T02:13:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 Strange...  I can change resolution in a Windows VM.  Haven't done a Mac one.
2011-11-24T02:15:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 that's annoying.
2011-11-24T02:16:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 That may do it.
2011-11-24T02:26:00.000Z	Deltatash	JetJaguar	how about this I open the MacOSX.vbox in gedit and check the settings it seems the first lot of settings worked in terminal i see the screen resolution i wanted is in the config file...
2011-11-24T02:27:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	  Hmmm...  are there Vbox extentions that you have to install in MacOSX like there is in Windows?
2011-11-24T02:30:00.000Z	Deltatash	JetJaguar	the extensions I can install for Virtualbox are to allow USB support if i remember right only other thing I can think of is the guest additions which is for windows
2011-11-24T02:30:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	you may need to install the guest additions.  I know a video driver gets installed with the Windows version.
2011-11-24T02:40:00.000Z	JetJaguar	Deltatash	 ew.
