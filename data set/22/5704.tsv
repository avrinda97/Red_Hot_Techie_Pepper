2007-03-15T09:26:00.000Z	drewzf		I modified my sources.list and replaced dapper with edgy and upgraded and it didn't install networking
2007-03-15T09:26:00.000Z	drewzf		Now I have a remote server sitting without any ability of getting online
2007-03-15T09:26:00.000Z	drewzf		And it's 1800 miles away
2007-03-15T09:26:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	That sure does suck, a little bit
2007-03-15T09:26:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	well if you can't connect to it, then no
2007-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	what sort of suggestion did you expect about fixing a remote server if its networking is not enabled?
2007-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	is that server connected wirelessly?
2007-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	drewzf	UAnon	I was hoping that I could revert to my old dapper install
2007-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	lets assume that you can, how can you revert if you are not able to reconnect?
2007-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	is it networked wirelessly?
2007-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	drewzf	UAnon	No, it's an ethernet connection
2007-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	it wasn't very smart to do a system-wide update without having direct access to the system
2007-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	thats like attempting to "reinstall" Windows 1500 miles away
2007-03-15T09:31:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	have that person manually go into Ubuntu and enable the network
2007-03-15T09:34:00.000Z	drewzf	UAnon	The package networking isn't installed.
2007-03-15T09:34:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	Do you have anyone around the server? Have them install the package manually
2007-03-15T09:34:00.000Z	drewzf	UAnon	How? Without networking and a CD?
2007-03-15T09:34:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	manually, using a USB drive / floppy / whatever
2007-03-15T09:39:00.000Z	drewzf	UAnon	What package do I want to download?
2007-03-15T09:39:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	no clue ask ikonia, I only act like I know what Im doing
2007-03-15T09:42:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	I believe you should check whether your Ethernet card is detected altogether
2007-03-15T09:44:00.000Z	UAnon	drewzf	then google and resolve the issue with detecting your ethernet card
