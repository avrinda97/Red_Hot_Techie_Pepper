2005-05-06T16:34:00.000Z	aaron		i am having trouble with ndiswrapper on my hp laptop. can someone help me?
2005-05-06T16:36:00.000Z	aaron		thanks dcraven. i'll check it out
2005-05-06T05:27:00.000Z	aaron		i received a fatal error when i executed the modprobe ndiswrapper command
2005-05-06T05:29:00.000Z	aaron		I have found the drivers for my cards chipset and installed them
2005-05-06T05:29:00.000Z	aaron		here is the exact error:
2005-05-06T05:30:00.000Z	aaron		FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Operation not permitted
2005-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	aaron		it was ran as root
2005-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	have you been asking about that all week?
2005-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	and please just use the ndiswrapper stuff in ubuntu
2005-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	does that work?
2005-05-06T05:33:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	are you using the ndiswrapper stuff from ubuntu?
2005-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	you're using sudo, right?
2005-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	aaron	bob2	actually, i activated root and logged in as root
2005-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	why? and don't do that.
2005-05-06T05:35:00.000Z	aaron	bob2	i get tired of typing sudo every 10 seconds
2005-05-06T05:35:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	then use sudo -s
2005-05-06T05:36:00.000Z	aaron	bob2	then i'll fiddle around with it using sudo, and see how it goes
2005-05-06T05:38:00.000Z	aaron	bob2	after running 'ndiswrapper -l', it says invalid driver, yet it came directly from the source. any ideas?
2005-05-06T05:39:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	no, sorry, I've never used ndiswrapper
2005-05-06T05:39:00.000Z	bob2	aaron	what chipset do you have, btw?
2005-05-06T05:40:00.000Z	aaron	bob2	its an agere chipset. it is the orinoco proxim 8420-wd
2005-05-06T05:41:00.000Z	aaron	bob2	the driver is wlagsall.inf. it came driectly from the install CD and the website
