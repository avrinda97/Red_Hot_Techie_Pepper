2007-05-14T06:00:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	I'll look for it :D
2007-05-14T06:01:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	With?
2007-05-14T06:02:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	Where was it suppose to be?
2007-05-14T06:03:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	I only find a directory filled with plugins
2007-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	:I found a file named Totem nothing else, no _config file in that folder.
2007-05-14T06:07:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	: no
2007-05-14T06:07:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	Should I try and add one?
2007-05-14T06:12:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	hehe I'll try :D
2007-05-14T06:13:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	Well it didn't get worse, nor better
2007-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	Sound is still there, but no image, well if I move it around, maximize it is there shortly
2007-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	mdkaneda55	Tylzen	try getting VLC, should definatly work in there, if not i know how to easily change output module to opengl using vlc =) hehe
2007-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	Didn't VLC was out for Linux :P My first day with Linux after a 7 yr break
2007-05-14T06:21:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	Well VLC didn't help much
2007-05-14T06:21:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	I could see the first three seconds, then it disappears
2007-05-14T06:23:00.000Z	mdkaneda55	Tylzen	Settings - Preferences - Video (on left, click +) , Output modules - Click checkbox by Advanced Options (lower right), change the module to OpenGL
2007-05-14T06:24:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	: Nothing
2007-05-14T06:27:00.000Z	Tylzen	mdkaneda55	Perhaps I should try and update the video drivers ? :D
