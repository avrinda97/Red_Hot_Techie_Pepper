2010-12-31T05:15:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		some of you may remember i am making a usb emergency boot stick
2010-12-31T05:15:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		i installed grub2 and tiny core a an fat16 partition and it went without a hitch
2010-12-31T05:16:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		however i started over and reformatted to ext4 and now grub tells me to load the kernel first
2010-12-31T05:16:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	to boot what I just logged on.
2010-12-31T05:16:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	ur on TC?
2010-12-31T05:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	TC?
2010-12-31T05:17:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	tiny core
2010-12-31T05:17:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	you meant usb?
2010-12-31T05:19:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	I saw that after  posted, so grub2 is not booting TC
2010-12-31T05:19:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	it did a lil bit ago but i was on fat16 part
2010-12-31T05:21:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	does TC come with gru2 or grub-legacy, is it a full install or the thumb loaded
2010-12-31T05:22:00.000Z	nit-wit		ISO loaded
2010-12-31T05:23:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	i extracted the zip file and made my own grub.cfg
2010-12-31T05:24:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	i sudo installed grub then extracted the iso and made a menu entry for it
2010-12-31T05:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	you might try the bootscript to look at it
2010-12-31T05:24:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	bootscript?
2010-12-31T05:25:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	it is for install mainly but it will tell you where the mbr is looking etc.http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2010-12-31T05:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	 would do a full install of puppy linux it would be much easier and is grub2
2010-12-31T05:27:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	its a 512MB stick space is needed
2010-12-31T05:27:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	nit-wit	i know puppy is only 100mb but tc is 10x smaller
2010-12-31T05:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	XiaolinDraconis	I understand puppy only 128MIB
