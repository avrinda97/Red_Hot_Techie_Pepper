2009-01-30T20:54:00.000Z	goran__		does anyone know what could be the problem?
2009-01-30T20:55:00.000Z	goran__		yes.. i have 3d acceleration
2009-01-30T20:55:00.000Z	goran__		it's like 16bit colors

2009-01-30T20:57:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	  look here under driver version section if your card is soupported by binary drivers ! !  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia

2009-01-30T21:03:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 what do you want exactly?
2009-01-30T21:03:00.000Z	goran__	chi_	i installed new drivers (180.11) and i'm experiencing some colors loss.. i can see stripes on my background and cube reflection ground....
2009-01-30T21:04:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 okay but so why didnt you use the regular drivers?
2009-01-30T21:04:00.000Z	goran__	chi_	what regular drivers?

2009-01-30T21:05:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 posted this line 3rd time now
2009-01-30T21:05:00.000Z	goran__	chi_	i've seen that link but there is no information for 180.11 driver... although i think my card is supported because i have 3d acceleration
2009-01-30T21:06:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 well but the driver is not soupported by ubuntu directly isn't it? also envy should not soupport it
2009-01-30T21:07:00.000Z	goran__	chi_	well that is the problem i dont know if it is supported directly by ubuntu :D
2009-01-30T21:07:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 and if you read up nvidia forum you will see, installing anything else could be a very hard problem... so you have to do the work for your own and post in that forum an into other forums... because the problem gets bigger than can be discussed here, i souppose
2009-01-30T21:08:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 you should use the driver mentioned on the link i gave you... and the problems are easier
2009-01-30T21:09:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 you said you are useing ubuntu 8.10 => so there you can activate hardware driver ... if you updated from 8.04 you may expact many problems... that may lead you to envy ( to clean up old installations)
2009-01-30T21:10:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 yes newer driver => no full use under linux... think about this! and use the oldone
2009-01-30T21:12:00.000Z	chi_	goran__	 read up nvidia forums on linux soupport ....
