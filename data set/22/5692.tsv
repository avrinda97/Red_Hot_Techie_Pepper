2007-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	mirra		where does iptables keep its logs????????
2007-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	it logs to /var/log/messages by default
2007-03-17T13:26:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	do you have any logging rules?
2007-03-17T13:27:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	did you use firestarter?
2007-03-17T13:27:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	does the rule show up when you do "iptables -L"?
2007-03-17T13:28:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	and is it high enough up to actually get the traffic (ie not last so it only logs the dropped)
2007-03-17T13:31:00.000Z	mirra	dilch	not working................
2007-03-17T13:32:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	ok, did you get the iptables script you're using from somwhere? Like maybe it's has it's logging set up to go somewhere else
2007-03-17T13:32:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	ah .. i kinda avoid webmin ... i wouldn't be surprised if it logged to somewhere else
2007-03-17T13:34:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	um, there could be if you pasted the iptables script to pastebin ... i don't know where webmin keeps it though
2007-03-17T13:34:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	maybe /etc/rc.d/init.d/webmin-iptables
2007-03-17T13:35:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	doesn't list what?
2007-03-17T13:36:00.000Z	mirra	dilch	i dont have a rc.d directory...rc.local, rc0.d, rc1.d, etc... i was saying that iptables -L doesnt show any log paths
2007-03-17T13:37:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	ah ok ... well there is a couple things to do ... are you registered? Can we go pm?
2007-03-17T13:37:00.000Z	mirra	dilch	i am not registered
2007-03-17T13:38:00.000Z	mirra	dilch	i dont remeber how far our conversation goes..by my end result is to figure out why i cannot get nameservers to work with my iptables
2007-03-17T13:38:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	well, do /msg nickserv mirra <password>
2007-03-17T13:40:00.000Z	mirra	dilch	i hate to sound like a moron but that isnt working
2007-03-17T13:40:00.000Z	mirra	dilch	ooh its owned by someone else
2007-03-17T13:41:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	lol, well register a nick, only because it probably isn't wise to be advertising what your doing to the firewall while testing
2007-03-17T13:44:00.000Z	dilch	mirra	you still here?
2007-03-17T13:45:00.000Z	mirra	dilch	sorry my computer just froze for a minute
