2009-04-07T17:03:00.000Z	Lartza_		What is kernel build files package called?
2009-04-07T17:04:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	do you mean headers?
2009-04-07T17:09:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	try this; sudo apt-get install linux-headers
2009-04-07T17:10:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	try this then; sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
2009-04-07T17:13:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	you should install xubuntu-desktop maybe, it's a lightweight desktop
2009-04-07T17:14:00.000Z	Lartza_	sarmisak	I am installing enligtenment
2009-04-07T17:17:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	with virtualbox?
2009-04-07T17:17:00.000Z	Lartza_	sarmisak	No
2009-04-07T17:26:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	ok then, you should set it up like this; modem (or ethernet connection) > ubuntu > switch > other pcs
2009-04-07T17:27:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	you should have two ethernets on the ubuntu machine, and one should be connected to your internet connection, other to the switch that you are going to distribute
2009-04-07T17:28:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	ok, how many machines do you have?
2009-04-07T17:28:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	that you are going to serve
2009-04-07T17:30:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	so are you getting your internet through a wall socket adaptor from a router that's far away from you, right?
2009-04-07T17:33:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	ok, the thing is ubuntu won't solve your problems with the router, you will have to direct some traffic to it from the router anyway, have you considered buying a simple 8 port switch?
2009-04-07T17:34:00.000Z	Lartza_	sarmisak	No
2009-04-07T17:37:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	yes it is possible, and it's rather simple
2009-04-07T17:38:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	I distribute internet to almost 20 pcs here with a 15$ adsl modem
2009-04-07T17:38:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	you got the point I believe :D
2009-04-07T17:39:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	you might want to keep the personal firewall for your windows pc, it usually prevents not just network attacks but internal virus actions also
2009-04-07T17:40:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	just keep it on the windows machine, no need -at least for now- on your ubuntu pc
2009-04-07T17:42:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	temporarytao is right, windows is something else with networking ;)
2009-04-07T17:48:00.000Z	sarmisak	Lartza_	have you tried the bios settings?
