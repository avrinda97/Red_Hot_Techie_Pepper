2012-03-22T08:21:00.000Z	MestreLion		can python 2.6 and 3.1 co-exist if installed from repos? do they automatically set update-alternatives? how should i deal with them?
2012-03-22T08:22:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	I have python 2.6 and 3.1
2012-03-22T08:23:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	without any problems, I think
2012-03-22T08:23:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	so, how do you set the "default" python?
2012-03-22T08:23:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	I think it asked me when installing
2012-03-22T08:24:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	humm, nice :D do you know if it uses the update-alternatives system?
2012-03-22T08:25:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	I don't even know what that is :X But you could really just link /usr/bin/python to the binary you want
2012-03-22T08:25:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	if that isn't bad administrative practivse
2012-03-22T08:26:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	it is :P... actually, that's precisely what whe alternatives system is for... could you please check if your /usr/bin/python is already a symlink, and where it points to?
2012-03-22T08:27:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	Mine points to 2.7
2012-03-22T08:27:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	directly?
2012-03-22T08:28:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	it points to python2.7 in the same folder
2012-03-22T08:28:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	so I didn't set up that symlink XD, that's for sure
2012-03-22T08:31:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	python 2.7 did... are you sure you have python 3.1 installed too? how do you use it?
2012-03-22T08:31:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	*quick off-topic* It's clear that we don't have enough education in tech. Otherwise we wouldn't have these makeshift solutions all over the web and IRC
2012-03-22T08:32:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	I would use python3
2012-03-22T08:33:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	so python3 did not set alternatives... well, but it at least didn't mess with default settings for 2.7, that's a relief... thanks a lot mangdood__
2012-03-22T08:34:00.000Z	mangdood__	MestreLion	could you link me to something on this alternatives thing? I'm starting to be curious about it
2012-03-22T08:34:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	man update-alternatives
2012-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	it's a very ancient, but still very useful, system for setting alternatives to commands.... so you can configure which command would run if you just simply type python
2012-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	it sets a "net" of symlinks and manage them for you...
2012-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	MestreLion	mangdood__	you can choose your default java, web-browser, python, editor, whatever, in this way
