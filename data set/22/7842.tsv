2005-12-14T10:31:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	if you have a specific question, ask
2005-12-14T10:32:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	you're being way way too vague
2005-12-14T10:32:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	you mean "I configured the BIOS to boot the CD, but it appears to just boot into windows as usual"?
2005-12-14T10:33:00.000Z	Trilom	bob2_	Yeah
2005-12-14T10:33:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	does it boot other cds ok?
2005-12-14T10:34:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	you've booted game cds?
2005-12-14T10:34:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	or do you mean you can acces them under windows ok?
2005-12-14T10:34:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	that's entirely unrelated
2005-12-14T10:34:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	can you boot your windows cd?
2005-12-14T10:35:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	try it again, now
2005-12-14T10:39:00.000Z	bob2_	Trilom	the windows cd didn't work? then your bios settings are broken or the drive is damaged.
