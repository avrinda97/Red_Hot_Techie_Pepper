2006-11-08T15:30:00.000Z	aldwin		is there any sort of ubuntu pdf that is with an official release?
2006-11-08T15:31:00.000Z	aldwin		ah, okay.
2006-11-08T15:31:00.000Z	aldwin		madpilot, i dont even know how to run the mirc there. im so sorry
2006-11-08T15:32:00.000Z	loutrine	aldwin	In ubuntu, open a Terminal and type sudo apt-get install xchat. xchat is an irc program similar to mirc which you can use
2006-11-08T15:32:00.000Z	aldwin		yup i know. but i dont know how to run it
2006-11-08T15:33:00.000Z	aldwin		madpilot, here's how it goes. i tried installing it at my second hard disk and after 2 or three days i manage to make the ubuntu 6.06 run at my computer
2006-11-08T15:33:00.000Z	loutrine	aldwin	xchat will appear under in Applications -> Internet
2006-11-08T15:33:00.000Z	aldwin		madpilot, since my computer has this processor of 38. amd2 x2 64 bit. its quite hard to find a running linux at this computer
2006-11-08T15:34:00.000Z	aldwin		madpilot, so there i was able to install the ubuntu 6.06 like i did said. it was this morning that i had accomplish that.
2006-11-08T15:34:00.000Z	aldwin		and now its quite late. its noveber 8, 5pm. i just woke up.
2006-11-08T15:35:00.000Z	aldwin		madpilot, i did try the those believe me. but only the ubuntu 6.06 did work on my computer.
2006-11-08T15:36:00.000Z	aldwin		madpilot, 6.06 alternative 64bit. thats the one that did run on my computer.
2006-11-08T15:36:00.000Z	loutrine	aldwin	So you have Ubuntu installed and running now...?
2006-11-08T15:37:00.000Z	aldwin	loutrine	yah i have. but since i dont know how to use much of linux software as well as ubuntu as a distribution. i dont even know how to install a yahoo messenger
2006-11-08T15:37:00.000Z	loutrine	aldwin	gaim is a good all round IM program, give that a try.
