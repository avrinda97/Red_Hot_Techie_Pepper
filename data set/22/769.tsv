2011-12-01T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	that bug is a known issue
2011-12-01T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	it has been reported a few times,
2011-12-01T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	it seems more common with apptitude
2011-12-01T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	it is actually not a problem though and will not stop any functionality, just a visual thing
2011-12-01T13:52:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	I did my best to search for known issues, but didn't find anything relevant. Is there a solution?
2011-12-01T13:52:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	I see.
2011-12-01T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	(or at least shouldn't cause you a problem)
2011-12-01T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	I'm not aware of a solution as of yet, but it has been reported quite a few times
2011-12-01T13:55:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	In that case, I might be looking at another problem as well. For example, there are two versions of libasound2 that appear to be the same version, but some packages depend on one and some the other, but they conflict.
2011-12-01T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	sorry, could you explain a bit clearer
2011-12-01T14:00:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	could you please do "sudo apt-get update" and pastebin the output

2011-12-01T14:04:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	do you have backports enabled
2011-12-01T14:05:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	Yes.
2011-12-01T14:05:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	you may actually have conflicting packages then
2011-12-01T14:06:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	Aha, now we're getting somewhere. Let me remove backports and update...
2011-12-01T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	it may be (hopefully not) too late if any of the backport packages have been installed and a conflict created
2011-12-01T14:11:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	No, there are still problems, by the looks of things.
2011-12-01T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	I'm not massivly shocked by that
2011-12-01T14:14:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	In that case, I'll have to decide which is the lesser of two evils in terms of either reinstalling the system or learning about the package management system in enough detail to fix the problems.
2011-12-01T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	[dlp]	well it depends on the conflict
2011-12-01T14:17:00.000Z	[dlp]	ikonia	The main problem is that I've got a fair bit of technically unsupported software "installed" outside package management. I had to make a lot of tweaks to get these working, hence the reason I'm reluctant to reinstall. I'd have to go through the whole process again.
