2012-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	vak		when my 4 cores are 100% loaded I get my CPU at 80Â°C and PC screams badly. How could one *automatically* lower the CPU frequency if temperature reaches some threshold?
2012-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	aBound	vak	I'd figured by applying thermal paste right onto the CPU.
2012-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	vak	aBound	the huge sluwigbr on CPU gets also very hot, so it is not a hot-transmission problem.
2012-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	aBound	vak	sluwigbr?
2012-01-17T03:26:00.000Z	aBound	vak	Is the CPU overheating and automatically shuting down by any chance. If so the heat sink could be clogged with dust.
2012-01-17T03:28:00.000Z	vak	aBound	what is sluwigbr?
2012-01-17T03:28:00.000Z	aBound	vak	you typed it in and I wondered what it was.
2012-01-17T03:30:00.000Z	vak	aBound	lol it was 'heatsink' in a wrong keyboard layout :)
2012-01-17T03:31:00.000Z	aBound	vak	lol
2012-01-17T03:32:00.000Z	aBound	vak	Usually a laptop/desktop carries a heat sink and when you buy a new PC/Laptop they apply thermal paste to the CPU chip to prevent it from overheating.
2012-01-17T03:32:00.000Z	aBound	vak	Overtime the CPU chip needs new thermal paste applied to it and the heat sink needs to be cleaned from time to time. To prevent overheating.
2012-01-17T03:33:00.000Z	vak	aBound	ok
2012-01-17T03:33:00.000Z	aBound	vak	I can run a bunch of programs with my computer and at the same time my temps should stay at 40 degrees to 50 degrees and go nowhere near 80 to 90 degrees.
2012-01-17T03:34:00.000Z	aBound	vak	I'm just saying as I have an old laptop that was going near 80 to 90 degrees and you should check if it's the hardware that needs cleaning.
2012-01-17T03:34:00.000Z	vak	aBound	it is only when my 4 core 100% loaded.
2012-01-17T03:34:00.000Z	aBound	vak	I have a quad-core too.
2012-01-17T03:34:00.000Z	aBound	vak	Possibly could be a program that has a memory leak.
2012-01-17T03:35:00.000Z	vak	aBound	no :)
2012-01-17T03:36:00.000Z	aBound	vak	haha
2012-01-17T03:37:00.000Z	aBound	vak	Those are my two best guesses either heat sink is clogged with dust and the cpu chip needs new thermal paste preferably (arctic silver brand) or it's some memory leak/cpu issue with a program. Causing it to skyrocket.
2012-01-17T03:40:00.000Z	aBound	vak	Indeed they don't but they can constantly consume memory and it won't be released back. Though it it's consuming a ton of memory it might increase CPU usage.
