2006-06-03T08:13:00.000Z	Schalken		why is ubuntu so sloooooow on this bleeding-edge computer?
2006-06-03T08:14:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	something must be wrong.  i'm only on a p4 2.4 and its pretty fast.  gig of ram.
2006-06-05T14:49:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	did you get working drivers for it?
2006-06-05T14:49:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	yes somehow i was able to apt-get install the nvidia drivers for it.
2006-06-05T14:50:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	and it worked with FULL support?
2006-06-05T14:50:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	(forall the cards features etc)
2006-06-05T14:50:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	i dont use dual monitors i'm satisfied with my 21"
2006-06-05T14:51:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	i've only used vga, not dvi .. so -- ??
2006-06-05T14:51:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	lol. ive concluded there is no getting DRI to work on my onboard video
2006-06-05T14:52:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	so because i LOVE ubuntu so much I am going to get a graphics card that will work with it. just so ubuntu will work. could the 5200FX be that video card?
2006-06-05T14:53:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	thats the perfect video card, i have 2 already.  and they run about $30
2006-06-05T14:55:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	i just dont want to install it. boot up ubuntu and find no drviers for it work and it is using dreaded Mesa software rendering again. that would be HELL. or boot up a video game and find OpenGL doesnt work. or some OpenGL feature doesnt work or something like that. so... does anything with the 5200FX not work with the nVidia drivers?
2006-06-05T14:56:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	i got XGL working very nicely with it..  i think that proves that its the minimum nvidia supperted card you'd want to get  best value definitely.
2006-06-05T14:57:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	thanks! i love ubuntu (if only it werent so sluggish on this stupid linux unsupporting motherboard)!
2006-06-05T15:10:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	i just realised its not the 5200FX, but the FX5200.
2006-06-05T15:10:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	were still talking about the same card arent we?
2006-06-05T15:12:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	i just realised its not the 5200FX, but the FX5200, were still talking about the same card arent we?
2006-06-05T15:13:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	dyslexic?
2006-06-05T15:31:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	yes its a gaim plugin
2006-06-05T15:32:00.000Z	Schalken	avis	thanks, know what its called?
2006-06-05T15:35:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	its called buddy state notification
2006-06-05T15:39:00.000Z	avis	Schalken	please look into buddy pounches it will notify you if a user comes out of any state and can include a message for yourself and it cna even transmit a message to the other person once they come online, away from idle, or not busy, etc.
