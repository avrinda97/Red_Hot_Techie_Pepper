2012-05-14T17:25:00.000Z	APoulos	auronandace	see, this the problem with your IRC bot commands, half the time you're just guessing what I'm looking for, not even bothering to listen properly to what Im asking
2012-05-14T17:27:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	if you just wanted xfce then install xubuntu, why install ubuntu if you are just going to remove gnome and unity later?
2012-05-14T17:28:00.000Z	APoulos	auronandace	BlueEagle im not sure I want to install xfce - I want to know of other options other lightweight desktop environments that don't require a change in distros
2012-05-14T17:30:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	like BlueEagle said, it is more advisable to refrain from removing desktops after the fact
2012-05-14T17:31:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	if you wanted to try them out then install them and chose them from lightdm
2012-05-14T17:31:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	there is: unity, gnome3, xfce, lxde, enlightenment
2012-05-14T17:31:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	kde4 too
2012-05-14T17:34:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	the thing is removing desktops tends to remove many dependencies, which is what breaks your system (hence BlueEagle advised you not to remove them)
2012-05-14T17:34:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	lxde is the lightest full desktop environment
2012-05-14T17:36:00.000Z	APoulos	auronandace	well I mean what about all the random apps that get installed - I just don't want like 5-6 different environments and not sure how to the unnecessary ones
2012-05-14T17:37:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	the best thing i can advise is trying them all, find one you like then install that version on a fresh install (removing them afterward will give you headaches and wastes a lot of time)
2012-05-14T17:38:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	a vm is a great testing ground
2012-05-14T17:39:00.000Z	APoulos	auronandace	BlueEagle , Joupi - ah alright I get it a little more now.  Okay, so Xubuntu still uses the same market and what not as standard Ubuntu?
2012-05-14T17:40:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	they all use the same repos, the desktop environment is just what it looks like (the front end)
2012-05-14T17:40:00.000Z	APoulos	auronandace	BlueEagle Joupi so say I wanted to install Gnome but not EVERY program that comes with it, what would I install?
2012-05-14T17:42:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	unity isn't that bad actually, but my favourite is still xfce
2012-05-14T17:43:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	gnome2 isn't available on 11.10 upwards
2012-05-14T17:46:00.000Z	APoulos	auronandace	auronandace BlueEagle - here's how I want to go about this, I want to install Gnome without all the extra programs it installs with it, and then until I feel safe enough to use other DEs from testing from VMs I want stick with Gnome - do you understand what I mean now?
2012-05-14T17:46:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	gnome2 or 3?
2012-05-14T17:58:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	if you know exactly what packages you want try the mini iso
2012-05-14T17:58:00.000Z	auronandace	APoulos	but that does mean you'd need to know what you want
