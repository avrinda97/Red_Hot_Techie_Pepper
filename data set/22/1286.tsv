2010-07-18T06:02:00.000Z	blitzo		i have a troubleshoot ques: a new ubuntu install crashes while doing an apt-get upgrade - what log files should i look in for cause?  kern.log, syslog, dpkg.log, what else?
2010-07-18T06:03:00.000Z	blitzo		r3cur51v3 that means you can't get there from here
2010-07-18T06:04:00.000Z	Sylphid	blitzo	im assuming you did an apt-get update first?
2010-07-18T06:04:00.000Z	blitzo		sylphid yes
2010-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	blitzo	Sylphid	we tried first to load wubi and ran into this same prob and the advice i got here was just blow windows away and go straight to ubuntu so we did - and same prob
2010-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	blitzo	Sylphid	it won't update
2010-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	Sylphid	blitzo	when you say crash how exactly, hangs, reboots, restarts X

2010-07-18T06:06:00.000Z	blitzo	Sylphid	dunno didn't try - i am troubleshooting from remote and i didn't think to do that

2010-07-18T06:09:00.000Z	blitzo	Sylphid	i want to see the logs as they are at the time of crash so we will get it up on the cd before rebooting from the harddisk
