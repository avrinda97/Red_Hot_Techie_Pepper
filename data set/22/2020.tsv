2009-12-17T01:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	ScoobyDoo	hardware specs ?
2009-12-17T01:42:00.000Z	ScoobyDoo	erUSUL	New to cocking about with computer hardware, All I can remember is the RAM is 256MB
2009-12-17T01:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	ScoobyDoo	i think that the livecd needs more ram than that. you maybe have to try with xubuntu via an alternatecd install
2009-12-17T01:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	ScoobyDoo	alternate is a text mode intall (like the first half of WinXP install)
2009-12-17T01:43:00.000Z	ScoobyDoo	erUSUL	Ah ok, Just just burn the xubuntu iso to a disc? nothing special?
2009-12-17T01:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	ScoobyDoo	yes the alternate one
2009-12-17T01:44:00.000Z	ScoobyDoo	erUSUL	alternate one?
2009-12-17T01:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	ScoobyDoo	there are two types of CD's the desktop and the alternate
2009-12-17T01:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	ScoobyDoo	for low memory systems use the alternate cd

2010-04-21T19:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	ScoobyDoo	when you plug the disk in do « dmesg | tail »
2010-04-21T19:23:00.000Z	ScoobyDoo	erUSUL	appears to be sda2
2010-04-21T19:24:00.000Z	ScoobyDoo	erUSUL	Says I need to spefy a filesystem type to mount it
