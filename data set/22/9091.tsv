2005-03-11T13:22:00.000Z	waseem		Hi I am having a problem with my speakers. Sound is not being emitted, but I know it's not a hardware problem. Does anyone here know what i can do to fix this problem?
2005-03-11T13:23:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	make sure the necessary mixer sliders are unmuted.
2005-03-11T13:25:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	does cat /proc/asound/cards list your sound card?
2005-03-11T13:26:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	post amixer output onto http://pastebin.ca
2005-03-11T13:28:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	no, I mean the output from ,,amixer'' (without the commas and quotes)
2005-03-11T13:28:00.000Z	waseem	crimsun	i just post that in the website and then someone helps me out
2005-03-11T13:31:00.000Z	waseem	crimsun	i posted it, do you have any idea how long it usually takes for someone to help me out?
2005-03-11T13:31:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	I'm trying to load the page.
2005-03-11T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	so you're trying to record from it?
2005-03-11T13:34:00.000Z	waseem	crimsun	any idea of what i can do now/
2005-03-11T13:35:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	I have no idea what you're trying to do, since I asked if you're trying to record from it, and you answered "no"
2005-03-11T13:35:00.000Z	waseem	crimsun	im not trying to record anything using my microphone, my speaker isnt working. thats the problem
2005-03-11T13:37:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	you don't have any outputs according to amixer.
2005-03-11T13:37:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	only input.
2005-03-13T11:23:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	absolutely? no. probably? yes.
2005-03-19T13:06:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	you need to do that manually?
2005-03-19T13:06:00.000Z	waseem	crimsun	i guess, its not doing it automatically
2005-04-28T05:11:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	aptitude install tcl8.4-dev
2005-04-28T05:14:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	did you install tcl8.4-dev?
2005-04-28T05:15:00.000Z	waseem	crimsun	yes
2005-04-28T05:15:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	does it only need tcl, or does it need tk, too?
2005-04-28T05:19:00.000Z	crimsun	waseem	apt-get build-dep tuxracer
