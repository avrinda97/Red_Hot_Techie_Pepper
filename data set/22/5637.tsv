2007-03-29T09:01:00.000Z	Spliffster		tks tks
2007-03-29T09:01:00.000Z	Spliffster		!qt
2007-03-29T09:02:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	hhmm, I have libqt3-mt installed and it's not compiling properly
2007-03-29T09:03:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	i don't use qt apps if i can avoid them
2007-03-29T09:03:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	why's that? I mean, I'm just starting to learn them so I'm interested in what people may think about stuff I'll be programming in it
2007-03-29T09:03:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	what error do you get during compile time ? might be something trivial like other libs missing etc.
2007-03-29T09:04:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	simple: i don't like qt's mikeymousish look and it used to have a bad license ... but this has changed. it's just a matter of taste in my case
2007-03-29T09:04:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	the error is that when I make a .ui file... myForm.ui ... it makes the .h all properly, but then when I create a main.cpp file it doesn't recognize myForm :-(
2007-03-29T09:05:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	oh... but if someone changes the qtSettings then it won't look mikey mouse-ish, right?
2007-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	sorry m8 .. can't help you there
2007-03-29T09:07:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	when you compiled that code were there any libraries that you needed to get that didn't appear after apt-cache search qt3???
2007-03-29T09:08:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	IIRC i have installed libqt3-mt-dev ... and then i had problems and i can't remeber what i did to resolve it
2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	/list is the command you are looking for. try "/help list" because usage depends upon your client
2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	it tells me that there is no help available for that command :(
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	what irc client are you using ?
2007-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	XChat
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	try "Window > Channe list" you have filter optiosn there
2007-03-29T09:18:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	aolso search fro troll or trolltech if you are looking for qt stuff
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	and kde of course ... the kde devs know qt pretty well
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	hendrixski1	Spliffster	Thanks :-)  again
2007-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	Spliffster	hendrixski1	yw
