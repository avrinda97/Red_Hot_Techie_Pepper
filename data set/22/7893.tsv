2009-10-29T09:02:00.000Z	spikebike		centrino used to be chipset+graphics + cpu+ wireless
2009-10-29T09:02:00.000Z	spikebike		then they caved and allowed external graphics (but still mandated the chipset)
2009-10-29T09:03:00.000Z	spikebike		basically an effective trick to lock out other vendors in the laptop chip space
2009-10-29T09:03:00.000Z	gogeta	spikebike	i wanna i7 laptop
2009-10-29T09:03:00.000Z	gogeta	spikebike	i7 laptops are still in the 2 grand range
2009-10-29T09:04:00.000Z	spikebike	gogeta	yeah doesn't seem worth it for a laptop.. yet
2009-10-29T09:04:00.000Z	spikebike		works great, fast, low power, I actually got a xeon it was cheaper and had ECC
2009-10-29T09:04:00.000Z	gogeta	spikebike	yea quads are in the 800$ range now

2009-10-29T09:07:00.000Z	spikebike		I think ubuntu should ditch ftp/http downloads and mirrors.. just post torrents and let anyone who wants to mirror do so
2009-10-29T09:07:00.000Z	gogeta	spikebike	they do
2009-10-29T09:07:00.000Z	spikebike		seems like a huge amount of work and bother to setup the mirrors, preload directories, trust relationships, etc.
2009-10-29T09:08:00.000Z	gogeta	spikebike	they post torrents as well
2009-10-29T09:08:00.000Z	spikebike	gogeta	yeah I know
