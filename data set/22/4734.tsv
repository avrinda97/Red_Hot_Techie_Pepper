2009-09-06T12:19:00.000Z	gribouille		hi
2009-09-06T12:19:00.000Z	gribouille		du -hs /var gives 470M    /var, while df -h /var tells me that 853M are used. what does that mean ?
2009-09-06T12:20:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	/var is variable data, not all of it's directly on the mount
2009-09-06T12:20:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	I don't understand
2009-09-06T12:21:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	what did you mean ?
2009-09-06T12:22:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	do a df -Th
2009-09-06T12:23:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	/var is ext3
2009-09-06T12:23:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	and there's nothing on /var/run or /var/lock?
2009-09-06T12:23:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	of course there is
2009-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	well then.
2009-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	what ?
2009-09-06T12:25:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	df and du get their reports from different places on the system - du is more realtime while df is relative
2009-09-06T12:27:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	what do I have to do in order to have equal values ?
2009-09-06T12:35:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	what do you mean with "df is relative" ?
2009-09-06T12:37:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	you'll have to check out the source code to see why, exactly
2009-09-06T12:40:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	don't you have a clue ?
2009-09-06T12:40:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	I just gave it to you.
2009-09-06T12:40:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	don't you?
2009-09-06T12:41:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	where ?
2009-09-06T12:41:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	you... don't know how to install the source code of a package?
2009-09-06T12:42:00.000Z	gribouille	Gnea	of course I do. but you tell me df is relative, but you don't tell me what you mean
2009-09-06T12:43:00.000Z	Gnea	gribouille	I don't know how to explain it exactly, but the source code can. I'm sorry if that's not good enough for you, this is the Ubuntu support channel, not the commandline interface support everything-there-is channel, like ##linux would be.
