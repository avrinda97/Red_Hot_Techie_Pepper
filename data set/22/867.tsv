2011-02-21T02:47:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	thx for the tip
2011-02-21T02:39:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	open a terminal..
2011-02-21T02:40:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	plug drive(s)
2011-02-21T02:40:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	mount
2011-02-21T02:41:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	ActionParsnip: I CAN umount (and obviously mount) with terminal.. Just can't with standard GUI
2011-02-21T02:41:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	^shows you where and which devices are mounted, which dev is to be closed ?
2011-02-21T02:41:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	just a second, let me try
2011-02-21T02:42:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	in gui you have to close all windows and also no cd'ed in in terminal, and the user must be allowed to do mounts
2011-02-21T02:43:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	it seems that smth stays open.. I guess a gnome deamon
2011-02-21T02:43:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	when I plug them in, both the KDE notification AND the gnome one pop up
2011-02-21T02:44:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	I thinks this is the matter.. Because then when I try to umount through Dolphin, HAL complain about another program using the device.. But actually there is no Gui nor terminal opened
2011-02-21T02:45:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	lsof /dev/sdXX  hsows what uses it
2011-02-21T02:47:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	unclean unmount of ntfs can also cause this, see Action
2011-02-21T02:48:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	ActionParsnip: it actually happens just 5 min ago, when I plugged my android device for the first time...
2011-02-21T02:49:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	ActionParsnip: I think the SD is ntfs, isn't it? anyway it is virgin.. Out of the box
2011-02-21T02:49:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	sudo fdisk -l tells you
2011-02-21T02:53:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	that has nothing to do with your drive-issue
2011-02-21T02:54:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	oh ok now I'm trying with a new pendrive
2011-02-21T03:02:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	hal ? udev.. just right-click > unmount
2011-02-21T03:03:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	no.. KDE seems to rely on HAL.. The error message says "Device is not in HAL-mtab"
2011-02-21T03:04:00.000Z	DasEi	rafaa	the mtab is there, but Hal doesn't handle automount
2011-02-21T03:04:00.000Z	rafaa	DasEi	I think HAL has a separated mtab
