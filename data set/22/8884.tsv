2005-04-26T12:43:00.000Z	sp3tt		Is there a handy all in one page install guide for Ubuntu?
2005-04-26T12:43:00.000Z	AngelGabriel	sp3tt	I can give you a hand one line guide....... put the CD in, follow the prompts. It's that simple
2005-04-26T12:43:00.000Z	sp3tt		For a complete idiot?
2005-04-26T12:44:00.000Z	AngelGabriel	sp3tt	Even for a complete idiot! But if your online on a diffrent computer, then you can ask for help at any stage
2005-04-26T12:44:00.000Z	sp3tt		Well, what I worry about is messing up my windows boot.
2005-04-26T12:44:00.000Z	sp3tt		I heard GRUB does that.
2005-04-26T12:46:00.000Z	AngelGabriel	sp3tt	have u ever used Linux before, or have you ever intstalled linux into a dual boot situation?
2005-04-26T12:47:00.000Z	sp3tt	AngelGabriel	My first linux experience was about 20 minutes ago.
2005-04-26T12:47:00.000Z	sp3tt		When I booted the live cd.
2005-04-26T12:48:00.000Z	sp3tt		Well, FOSS is better than Proprietary.
2005-04-26T12:48:00.000Z	sp3tt		I agree with most of what RMS says, that makes me an ideal linux zealot, doesn't it?
2005-04-26T12:49:00.000Z	sp3tt		I've looked at the screenshots for Ubuntu on OSDir.
2005-04-26T12:50:00.000Z	sp3tt		But there's no shots showing anything about a bootloader...
2005-04-26T12:50:00.000Z	sp3tt		Does that require expert install?
2005-04-26T12:52:00.000Z	sp3tt		Does choosing where the bootloader is installed require expert install?
2005-04-26T12:55:00.000Z	sp3tt		Eh, wtf, I'll install ubuntu on my second disk.
2005-04-26T12:55:00.000Z	sp3tt		And then if it windows is not bootable, that can be fixed, right?
2005-04-26T12:55:00.000Z	sp3tt		Everything runs under Ubuntu anyways
2005-04-26T12:56:00.000Z	AngelGabriel	sp3tt	have you tried the Live CD?
2005-04-26T12:56:00.000Z	sp3tt		Yes
2005-04-26T12:56:00.000Z	sp3tt		For about ten minutes.
2005-04-26T12:56:00.000Z	AngelGabriel	sp3tt	Do you have a spare machine to play around with?
