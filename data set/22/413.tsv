2012-02-02T17:25:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	why need ssl there?
2012-02-02T17:26:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	you only need ssl if you have logins like the ubuntu forums, launchpad and so on
2012-02-03T19:12:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	not needed
2012-02-03T19:13:00.000Z	Chotaz_	iceroot	I have an external HDD that is literally dieing, WAY TOO slow transfer rates for this disk, ive changed the sata2usb interface inside the casing, didnt affect a thing
2012-02-03T19:14:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	usb is the problem, not fragmentation
2012-02-03T19:14:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	usb will use the cpu full
2012-02-03T19:14:00.000Z	Chotaz_	iceroot	still there's a transfer rate that is too slow for what this disk used to do
2012-02-03T19:14:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	usb is the problem, not the disk
2012-02-03T19:15:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	look at "top" and specially the %wa value
2012-02-03T19:15:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	if that is high your cpu/usb is the problem
2012-02-03T19:17:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	can you perform "sudo hdparm -t /dev/sdX on that drive?
2012-02-03T19:19:00.000Z	Chotaz_	iceroot	let me just ssh in and figure what the X is before executing that command
2012-02-03T19:22:00.000Z	Chotaz_	iceroot	  Timing buffered disk reads:   4 MB in  5.99 seconds = 684.31 kB/sec
2012-02-03T19:22:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	usb1.1 instead of usb2.0?
2012-02-03T19:22:00.000Z	Chotaz_	iceroot	thanks, I feel sh!tdumb now...
2012-02-03T19:22:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	:)
2012-02-03T19:23:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	as i said, it has nothing to do with fragmentation
2012-02-03T19:23:00.000Z	Chotaz_	iceroot	when i first started looking into the subject
2012-02-03T19:24:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	fragmentation is only a problem in the windows-world not on ext-drives
2012-02-03T19:24:00.000Z	Chotaz_	iceroot	ew winblows, thanks for the time and sharing the knowledge :)
2012-02-03T19:24:00.000Z	iceroot	Chotaz_	you are welcome
