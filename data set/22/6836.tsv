2006-08-20T13:53:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		talk?
2006-08-20T13:55:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		But then they'd have to connect, etc.
2006-08-20T13:57:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	there is this thing called IRC you may want to look at.
2006-08-20T13:57:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	You do realize that we're connected through another server right?
2006-08-20T13:58:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	of course.  there is a good reason for that
2006-08-20T14:09:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	every domain has a default email address for such complaints, and that's what you are supposed to use.  If you do anything else, then technically _you_ become guilty of hacking
2006-08-20T14:10:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	which may be dumb, but is true
2006-08-20T14:10:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	it was another example.
2006-08-20T14:11:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	I do understand what you are saying.  If there were enough call for it, though, I suspect it would exist, since it is a trivial enough thing to code.
2006-08-20T14:12:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	Well, I'm not looking for only something that would allow direct IP input, even being able to check the IP for other chat applications (AIM, Yahoo, ICQ) and then messge those clients should they have it.
2006-08-20T14:13:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	it would, as I say, be trivial to code.
2006-08-20T14:13:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	But currently you have to know the sn and connect to the main AIM/ICQ/Yahoo server
2006-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	I'm only good at java and don't know how those chat apps work.
2006-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	it's fairly simple network programming.  You would have to define a well known socket number for a machine to listen on for such requests
2006-08-21T07:55:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	you can change the auto mounting stuff to not create the icon
2006-08-21T07:55:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	it would still show up in a file manager, however
2006-08-21T07:56:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	That's fine. Just that I don't often access my Windows OS partition so I don't need it on the desktop
2006-08-21T07:56:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	How do I change it not to show an icon?
2006-08-21T07:56:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	ok.  let me look up error 18, and then I'll try to remember where that gets changed.
2006-08-21T07:57:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	ok, thanks.
2006-08-21T08:07:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	sethk	He could post a pastebin
2006-08-21T08:07:00.000Z	sethk	Corporal_Dirge	yes
