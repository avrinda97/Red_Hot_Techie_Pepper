2008-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	mikebot	binarymutant	My audio works--I'm listening to something in VLC right now... It's just that it doesn't work from firefox. Even if there is no other application open playing audio.
2008-11-20T11:06:00.000Z	binarymutant	mikebot	ok I'm trying to find where you can change the sound in firefox, if your using flash it sometimes screws up, but not everytime

2008-11-20T11:08:00.000Z	binarymutant	mikebot	have you tried restarting firefox?

2008-11-20T11:10:00.000Z	mikebot	binarymutant	Ah you know what, I think I'm able to just download the file from the site, so I guess I'm alright.
2008-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	mikebot	binarymutant	No worries, thanks for trying, I really do appreciate it.
2008-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	mikebot	binarymutant	Have a good night. Cheers
