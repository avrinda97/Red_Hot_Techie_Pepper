2005-01-10T08:37:00.000Z	mon	unperson	ok i get it. you tried the mount command with -t smbfs?
2005-01-10T08:27:00.000Z	mon	unperson	personally i wouldn't use (Linux - Samba - Linux) i just run both NFS and Samba for the correct OS
2005-01-10T08:29:00.000Z	unperson	mon	Ok, well, I'll have to take a look into the advantages of NFS to see if that's worth doing, but for the moment I just want to get samba working right.  Any idea the best way to mount it?
2005-01-10T08:32:00.000Z	mon	unperson	doesn't the "Network thingie" (not sure what it's called) automagicly discover them?
2005-01-10T08:32:00.000Z	mon	unperson	it required zero configuration here
2005-01-10T08:32:00.000Z	unperson	mon	You mean browsing the network with nautilus
2005-01-10T08:33:00.000Z	unperson	mon	I'm able to browse the shares with nautilus, but I can't figure out how to actually mount them.
2005-01-10T08:35:00.000Z	mon	unperson	i don't get it, you can browse them, but not mount them?
2005-01-10T08:36:00.000Z	unperson	mon	Eh, I mean that I can look at the contents through nautilus, but it's not clear that they're mounted in such a way that other applications can access it through the file system.
2005-01-10T08:41:00.000Z	unperson	mon	eh, let's get back to that in the a minute.  It looks like maybe there is a way to mount them with nautilus, but I can't figure out WHERE they're mounted.
2005-01-10T08:41:00.000Z	mon	unperson	tried "mount" in a console?
2005-01-10T08:42:00.000Z	mon	unperson	seems logical to me too that it does get mounted, can't check now because i'm not in ubuntu
2005-01-10T08:43:00.000Z	unperson	mon	Well, there's a "connect to server" option that puts a link on the desktop.  I assume that means it's mounting it, but I'm not sure.  Should it show up with df?
2005-01-10T08:44:00.000Z	mon	unperson	i think you're right. and yes it should show up with df or mount
2005-01-10T08:44:00.000Z	unperson	mon	With the terminal mount command here's the issue.  If the share is not already in /etc/fstab, then only root can mount them.  The difficulty is that the share is for my normal username, so when I try to mount it with sudo, samba sees root trying to mount it and refuses.
2005-01-10T08:47:00.000Z	mon	unperson	and using the "connect to server" option?
2005-01-10T08:48:00.000Z	unperson	mon	hmm...ok well, having used the connet to server option to make a link on my desktop, nothing shows up with df or mount -l.
2005-01-10T08:48:00.000Z	mon	unperson	click it first
2005-01-10T08:50:00.000Z	unperson	mon	Yeah, still nothing.  Hmm...I don't know.  Well, let me go to #debian and just see if I can figure out how to get smbmnt set suid root or something.
2005-01-10T08:51:00.000Z	mon	unperson	k, i'm not really into that smb stuff anyway :)
2005-01-10T08:54:00.000Z	unperson	mon	I should note that in the past samba has been a breeze.  This is just some oddity of the way ubuntu is setup or just my lack of familiarity with the distro.
2005-01-10T08:54:00.000Z	mon	unperson	could be, i don't know much about samba...
