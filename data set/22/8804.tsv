2005-05-18T11:02:00.000Z	okmit		Need help: Anyone knows where I could find HowTo for the official nVidia drivers? My problem is that the installere asks me for missing kernel modules
2005-05-18T11:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	You can install the nvidia drivers with ubuntu packages
2005-05-18T11:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	Is there a reason you are installing from source
2005-05-18T11:04:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	install the nvidia-glx and linux-restricted-modules-386 (assuming your 386, maybe 686,k7 if you installed a non stdnard kernel0
2005-05-18T11:05:00.000Z	okmit	Lathiat	: ubuntu packages doesn't work fine, maybe because I have the Geforce Fx go5600 (Laptop chip)
2005-05-18T11:06:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	ok, well the installer probably needs build-essential and linux-headers-2.6.10-386 installed
2005-05-18T11:06:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	also make sure to unintsall
2005-05-18T11:06:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	nvidia-glx
2005-05-18T11:07:00.000Z	okmit	Lathiat	: I completely removed nvidia-glx
2005-05-18T11:07:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	good
2005-05-18T11:09:00.000Z	okmit		lathiat : I'll try reinstalling after having linux-headers-2.6.10-386
2005-05-18T11:09:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	yes you will definatley need that package
2005-05-18T11:10:00.000Z	okmit	Lathiat	: Is the linux-headers-2.6.10-5-386 package also required?
2005-05-18T11:11:00.000Z	Lathiat	okmit	yes
