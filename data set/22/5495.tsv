2007-09-17T14:37:00.000Z	vraa		if you had to pick a replacement to Outlook Contacts, what would it be (or mac os x Address Book)
2007-09-17T14:39:00.000Z	vraa		i'm doing cost analysis on implementing linux versus windows in a 10 computer workplace
2007-09-17T14:39:00.000Z	vraa		what is the difference between Add/Remove and Synaptics ?
2007-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	add/remove is meant to be a simplistic interface. synaptic is a bit more advanced
2007-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	add/remove basically passes things on to synaptic
2007-09-17T14:49:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	as in windows genuine advantage?
2007-09-17T14:49:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	most definitely not
2007-09-17T14:52:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	ALT+F2
2007-09-17T14:52:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	i think it'd be in office stuff..
2007-09-17T14:52:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	no
2007-09-17T14:52:00.000Z	vraa	tanath	I pressed ALT+F2, typed in KOrganizer and it said it was not found
2007-09-17T14:53:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	case sensitive
2007-09-17T14:53:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	small letters. what? no office menu?
2007-09-17T14:53:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	'Apps > Office' isn't there?
2007-09-17T14:53:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	in ALT+F2, just start typing it
2007-09-17T14:54:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	that may have done it
2007-09-17T14:54:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	shouldn't be. my kde apps show up...
2007-09-17T14:54:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	some apps don't have categories for the gnome menu though.. perhaps that's one
2007-09-17T14:55:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	right. it should be executable from there.
2007-09-17T14:55:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	in ALT+F2, if you type exactly as quoted: 'korganizer' does it work?
2007-09-17T14:57:00.000Z	tanath	vraa	if it shows in the list in ALT+F2, you should be able to drag it there
