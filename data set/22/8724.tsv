2007-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	velko	mbd	i would guess that this is a problem with master/slave connection. maybe you set the jumpers to "cable select" and after connecting your hdd the positions are swapped. look at the jumpers on the drives
2007-04-28T16:44:00.000Z	mbd	velko	no. whatever the cd is master/slave or cable-select dosnt matter, since it is on its own ide channel
2007-04-28T16:45:00.000Z	velko	mbd	under which name appears your drive when you are able to boot?
2007-04-28T16:45:00.000Z	mbd	velko	no, it dosnt work at all
2007-04-28T16:46:00.000Z	mbd	velko	both hdds work, its the cd burner thats the problem
2007-04-28T16:47:00.000Z	velko	mbd	so your old hdd and the burner on one ide cable. and if you connect the new hdd on the other cable the burner stopped to work?
2007-04-28T16:47:00.000Z	mbd	velko	no both hdds are on ide channel 1. both work. the cdburner is on ide 2, alone, and just stopped working
2007-04-28T16:48:00.000Z	mbd	velko	dosnt get dev nodes or anything
2007-04-28T16:49:00.000Z	velko	mbd	you checked dmes and syslog to see if the kernel sees it at all?

2007-04-28T16:50:00.000Z	mbd	velko	syslog i dont know of. how do i check?
2007-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	velko	mbd	maybe some settings in the bios? or confict on irq 14? look at /var/log/syslog  and in /var/log/messages
2007-04-28T16:52:00.000Z	mbd	velko	nothing in syslog
2007-04-28T16:53:00.000Z	mbd	velko	nor mesages
2007-04-28T05:01:00.000Z	velko	mbd	if this is a bios or irc problem this guide might help. if nothing else you may get some idea or useful pointer from it: http://searchsystemschannel.techtarget.com/generic/0,295582,sid99_gci1241811,00.html
2007-04-28T05:02:00.000Z	mbd	velko	thanks! it dosnt seem to be an irq error since i cant find anything else using irq14
2007-04-28T05:03:00.000Z	velko	mbd	irq sharing is normal and allowed (you can see it in /proc/interrupts) but who knows. sorry to bother you without being helpful :-)
2007-04-28T05:04:00.000Z	mbd	velko	not at all! anything might give me a direction to search for the solution =)
2007-04-28T05:05:00.000Z	mbd	velko	/proc/interrupts says  14:      41943          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
2007-04-28T05:06:00.000Z	velko	mbd	you may try to look up the differences in this file with and without the drive connected
2007-04-28T05:09:00.000Z	mbd	velko	know if there is anyh way to rerun the installer hardware-detect configurator?
2007-04-28T05:10:00.000Z	velko	mbd	debian uses discover for that. i don't know about ubuntu
