2009-05-05T10:19:00.000Z	eggsby		anyone got a second to help a noob out?
2009-05-05T10:19:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Ask your question; if someone's available to help, they will
2009-05-05T10:21:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Can you not just remove the radeon drivers?
2009-05-05T10:21:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Or are you trying to find a solution that keeps them but also makes the rest work?
2009-05-05T10:22:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	So you're using a blank xorg.conf right now?
2009-05-05T10:23:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Have you tried it without having an xorg.conf at all?
2009-05-05T10:23:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	: I don't know what you mean by "debx or whatever thing"
2009-05-05T10:24:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	If you type "Xorg -configure" at a commandline, the X server will attempt to configure itself based on what it detects
2009-05-05T10:24:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	k.  It should give you an xorg.conf.new file as output
2009-05-05T10:24:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	It will just check things for a second, and then return you to the command line
2009-05-05T10:25:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	k
2009-05-05T10:25:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	No prob, and good luck
2009-05-05T10:26:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	"Xorg -configure" with a capital 'X', but try with none first
2009-05-05T10:30:00.000Z	eggsby	RedSocrates	the problem fixed itself when I removed my xorg.conf file
2009-05-05T10:30:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Great :)
2009-05-05T10:30:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	What exact card is it?  Radeon what?
2009-05-05T10:31:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	No problem at all, my pleasure :)
2009-05-05T10:31:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	one sec
2009-05-05T10:32:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Were you having these issues on the proprietary ATI driver?
2009-05-05T10:32:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Oh, I see
2009-05-05T10:33:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Well, hard to say what it was, in that case.  I've seen issues reported with the Radeon 9200 though
2009-05-05T10:33:00.000Z	RedSocrates	eggsby	Right, it at least seems pretty iffy.  That's why I asked
