2004-10-01T08:04:00.000Z	rcaskey		can't you just add a tag to existing packages (enduser)?
2004-10-01T08:05:00.000Z	rcaskey		but a security update applet needs to get done
2004-10-01T08:06:00.000Z	rcaskey		hopefully 2.10 will get the noticiation spec banged out
2004-10-01T08:06:00.000Z	rcaskey		I guess there is really no reason for it to be an applet though
2004-10-01T08:07:00.000Z	rcaskey		I've been thinking there needs to be a simple way to add sources so that security updates can be done for all apps
2004-10-01T08:07:00.000Z	rcaskey		and optional upgraes displayed
2004-10-01T08:08:00.000Z	rcaskey		a single click to add the repo, apt-get install the software, etc
2004-10-01T08:09:00.000Z	rcaskey		Also, it would help if it was possible to install a .deb with simple click click clicking
2004-10-01T08:09:00.000Z	rcaskey		That way every app author wouldn't need to put up a respotiroy
2004-10-01T08:11:00.000Z	rcaskey		If you click a deb which has external deps apt knows about that don't conflict, you should be able to click and install real easy like
2004-10-01T08:12:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	you'd have to fake up a repository on the fly or something ...
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	rcaskey	Kamion	well you could just query the reqs on the package(s), apt-get install those, then dpkg -i the debs
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	you really want to take the repository approach
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	rcaskey	Kamion	I think both should be done
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	there are too many corner cases otherwise
2004-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	and you end up duplicating too much code
2004-10-01T08:15:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	there's a limit to how much we want to make proprietary software authors happy, though
2004-10-01T08:15:00.000Z	rcaskey	Kamion	I think this benefits everyone
2004-10-01T08:40:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	that's a retcon :)
2004-10-02T06:18:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	not yet, will be
2004-11-06T10:29:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	that's right; the 'php4' package is in universe, but is more geared towards apache 1
2004-11-08T14:21:00.000Z	Kamion	rcaskey	apparently we forgot to get the xserve kernel patches into warty :-( there's a bug filed in bugzilla about that if you want to fish out the patch
