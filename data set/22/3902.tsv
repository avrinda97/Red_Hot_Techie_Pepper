2008-04-30T17:43:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	this is gutsy or hardy
2008-04-30T17:44:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	you still looking for help?
2008-04-30T17:45:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	with gfx driver, yessir
2008-04-30T17:45:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	hardy or earlier
2008-04-30T17:45:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	hardy atm, just upgraded
2008-04-30T17:45:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	what is the issue? crashes, cant load driver please clarify
2008-04-30T17:46:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	restricted driver config's i've tried only give limited resolution (640x480) and haven't found a driver config that can atleast display video etc
2008-04-30T17:47:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	then you may wish to give envyng-gtk a try
2008-04-30T17:48:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	yeah i tried envy in 7.10 hadn't tried it in 8.04, assumed it woouldn't work here either, I will test thank yoiu
2008-04-30T17:48:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	the latest drivers support that card
2008-04-30T17:49:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	you the win, I shall return and preach your glory ifwhen this works
2008-04-30T18:06:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	i updated to envyNG, installed the newest ATI driver, saw the message "this card IS supported" (you are correct) but after reboot i go into low res mode :(
2008-04-30T18:07:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	you need to enable the driver now
2008-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	what does hardware drivers show is in use?
2008-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	ati accellerated gfx driver in use.  although i've unchecked that, reinstalled, rechecked it, and still fails
2008-04-30T18:44:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	any last ditch efforts you might consider on this ATI driver issue before i boot back into windows? (i hate to see this hardy install go untouched like my gutsy install did)
2008-04-30T18:44:00.000Z	bazhang	knmstrflx	some have to run it a couple of times; you did uninstall the others before doing this right? you read the instructions? or just installed over it
2008-04-30T18:45:00.000Z	knmstrflx	bazhang	i bruteforced like a true noob, the same way i code, i shall read a bit
