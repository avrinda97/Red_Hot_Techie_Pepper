2010-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	ElemDragon		FAT32 has a file size limit.... i forget exactly what, but i know it's far less than 7GB
2010-05-22T07:33:00.000Z	ElemDragon		well.... if the source can hold a 7GB file.... then there wouldn't be any sort of issue
2010-05-22T07:34:00.000Z	ElemDragon		the problem comes into play when you try to transfer a file from a file system that can hold a large file to one that can't.  FAT32 isn't one of those that can handle large files
2010-05-22T07:34:00.000Z	ElemDragon		yep
2010-05-22T07:35:00.000Z	ElemDragon		i mean... you could always split the file somehow.... but then you'd still run into the issue if you were to transfer another large file later on
2010-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	ElemDragon		I'm having a bit of an installation issue with 10.04 x64 myself
2010-05-22T07:39:00.000Z	ElemDragon		Mine seems to install everything just fine, running dual boot, and after i select to boot into Ubuntu, i get the blinking cursor at the top left for a bit, then nothing
2010-05-22T07:39:00.000Z	ElemDragon		or if it goes past that, furthest i seem to get is a Ubuntu wallpaper
2010-05-22T07:39:00.000Z	ElemDragon		My monitor actually goes to sleep for a bit
2010-05-22T07:40:00.000Z	ElemDragon		Clean install.  Tried all three possibilities, too.  Windows installer, Desktop disc, and Alternative disc
2010-05-22T07:41:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	do you have a sli or gforce motherboard in your machine?
2010-05-22T07:41:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	if you have onboard video capability.. remove the gtx board and try the built in one.. see if that works
2010-05-22T07:42:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	is it a gforce MB?
2010-05-22T07:44:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	well... could be an acpi issue.. and could be a signaling thing with the pci buss.. to test either/both you need to edit the kernel boot line in grub.. not sure how to do the acpi=off thing but the other you add "pci=nomsi" before "quiet splash" in the kernel boot line.
2010-05-22T07:45:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	it's not a storage issue.... ntfs isn't a good option for data storage on linux
2010-05-22T07:46:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	probably not but you could from a live cd.. you have to mount the root partition after boot and navagate to /etc/grub (forgot the new location)
2010-05-22T07:47:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	then you could test it with that.. on boot you'll typically get an initial screen.. hit F6 and it should allow you to edit the kernel line right there.. then hit enter to continue the boot process.
2010-05-22T07:48:00.000Z	ElemDragon	scunizi	 ... now that i think about it.... pretty sure it'd be editable from the boot loader, wouldn't it?
2010-05-22T07:49:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	perhaps
2010-05-22T07:50:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	good luck.. different configurations can be quirky depending on the hardware.. remember with windows nothing really works right until you install the Motherboard driver, usb, network, video etc etc.. each OS has it's hurdles to jump..
2010-05-22T08:05:00.000Z	ElemDragon	scunizi	 well, i tried the whole "pci=nomsi" bit and i was able to see the boot logo, it allowed me to log in, and seemed to stop doing anything after that, just leaving me sitting there staring at the wallpaper and cursor
2010-05-22T08:07:00.000Z	scunizi	ElemDragon	you got further then before.. I suppose that work up to a point but there's more happening. maybe the acpi part.. google for that or maybe someone here will know what to include on the kernel line
