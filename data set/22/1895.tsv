2009-12-12T00:17:00.000Z	minche		i don't know
2009-12-12T00:17:00.000Z	minche		but it seems like it is
2009-12-12T00:17:00.000Z	minche		no other computer can connect to it
2009-12-12T00:17:00.000Z	minche		which is really weird
2009-12-12T00:17:00.000Z	minche		no, she can't connect
2009-12-12T00:18:00.000Z	minche		yeha, but it's not only her pc =/
2009-12-12T00:18:00.000Z	minche		wired
2009-12-12T00:19:00.000Z	minche		tried it
2009-12-12T00:19:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	dod you say your roommate can get online when your computer is off?
2009-12-12T00:21:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	yeah, switch cables
2009-12-12T00:24:00.000Z	minche	lzrdking	huh?
2009-12-12T00:24:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	give your roommate your cable and take hers, see if that makes any difference
2009-12-12T00:25:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	well with only one cable, you can't both be online at the same time
2009-12-12T00:26:00.000Z	minche	lzrdking	but she can't connect
2009-12-12T00:26:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	it sounds like a vista and/or router issue, not an ubuntu issue
2009-12-12T00:28:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	try plugging in the cable to her computer and to a different port on the router
2009-12-12T00:28:00.000Z	minche	lzrdking	tried that
2009-12-12T00:28:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	sounds like a vista issue then
2009-12-12T00:29:00.000Z	minche	lzrdking	mine too
2009-12-12T00:29:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	try #vista
2009-12-12T00:37:00.000Z	lzrdking	minche	any luck?
