2010-06-07T20:32:00.000Z	Galerien		errr... guys, I have a file with a number on the beginning of each line, from 2 to 960... anyone knows a way to delete them?
2010-06-07T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	and after that number? a space allways ?
2010-06-07T20:33:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	an "enter" letter I guess
2010-06-07T20:33:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	and then a space
2010-06-07T20:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	enter ? so each number is in its own line?
2010-06-07T20:34:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	see my private message
2010-06-07T20:36:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	http://paste.ubuntu.com/446173/
2010-06-07T20:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	grep -v '^[0-9]' file > file.new
2010-06-07T20:42:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	great, I didn't know how to do it but I think I understand the command !
2010-06-07T20:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	if some other usefull line begins with a number thwen it will be deleted too
2010-06-07T20:42:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	Yes i got that thanks, but I don't think that any php line can begin with a number...
2010-06-07T20:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	grep -E '^[0-9]+$' file > file.new
2010-06-07T20:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	that will work better
2010-06-07T20:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	sorry --> grep -vE '^[0-9]+$' file > file.new
2010-06-07T20:44:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	ok, thanks :D
2010-06-07T20:45:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	it's has exactly the same result, thanks :D
2010-06-08T14:40:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	Yes it doesn't

2010-06-10T16:40:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	did you know that MSI wants to abandon bios?
2010-06-10T16:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Galerien	read about it, efi is still a bios ( modern one but still bios/firmware )
2010-06-10T16:42:00.000Z	Galerien	erUSUL	it's a firmware, not a bios, and uses C, not assembly
