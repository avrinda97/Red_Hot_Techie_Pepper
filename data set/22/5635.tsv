2008-12-17T07:27:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	again, take off the 5
2008-12-17T07:27:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	and set --root-directory to your ubuntu's /boot
2008-12-17T07:29:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	removing the 5 has teh same error, and for the --root-directory option: do you mean to mount the ubuntu partition someplace and point to the boot folder? ex. --root-directory=/mnt/buntu/boot
2008-12-17T07:29:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	yes.
2008-12-17T07:32:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	http://pastebin.com/m5e42f1c7 <- :/
2008-12-17T07:33:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	oops, take off the /boot

2008-12-17T07:36:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	um...this sounds like grub wasn't configured properly
2008-12-17T07:36:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	*installed on your hard drive. what's in /mnt/buntu/boot?
2008-12-17T07:38:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	 http://pastebin.com/d67e4e8f0
2008-12-17T07:39:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	boot is a symlink right? i think you can remove it
2008-12-17T07:40:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	yup
2008-12-17T07:40:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	and ...why is stage1 missing...
2008-12-17T07:41:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	indeed a good qurestion, i think the grub error is some sort of hint though.
2008-12-17T07:41:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	as far as i can tell, it means grub wasn't really installed...
2008-12-17T07:42:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	installed being the boot loader itself in the MBR or installed as in the files in /boot?
2008-12-17T07:42:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	you can try "mount -t proc /mnt/buntu/proc", "chroot /mnt/buntu /bin/bash" "dpkg-reconfigure grub"
2008-12-17T07:42:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	files in /boot
2008-12-17T08:09:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	well, I still have me error 12 which I come to read that it means that something happend but it doesnt know what, any ideas where to progress?
2008-12-17T08:12:00.000Z	raylu	Awsoonn	error 12...where?
2008-12-17T08:13:00.000Z	Awsoonn	raylu	"This error is returned if the device strings syntax is correct but other than that, an error occurred that isn't defined by any other error. "
