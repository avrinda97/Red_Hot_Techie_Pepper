2007-02-22T14:59:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: what do you mean "it woks that way in windows"? do you mean you *have* local net access when connected in windows?
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: have you tracert'ed in windows to see **how** you're connecting to the internet in windows?
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: it may be that you internet connection is via the tunnel, when connected
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	PhyerFly	slippyr4	yes, its through the VPN connection - its all routed through there. I get a different IP affress in everything
2007-02-22T15:02:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: so in linux, when connected, what does your routing table look like compared to the windows one? there must be some difference
2007-02-22T15:02:00.000Z	PhyerFly	slippyr4	I've never compared the routing tables - i dont even know how to do that in dinwos
2007-02-22T15:03:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: route print iirc
2007-02-22T15:04:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: yeah, route print - the layout it a bit different but it's fundamentially the same as route on *nix
2007-02-22T15:04:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	you need tabs between those different bits in fstab
2007-02-22T15:04:00.000Z	PhyerFly		Okay cool, ill have to compare them tonight and see what the difference is
2007-02-22T15:05:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: only think to note is that the output of windows route print has lines with your current IP and mask 255.255.255.255 - you can ignore these
2007-02-22T15:06:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	are you sure that the filesystem type is correct
2007-02-22T15:06:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	also please quote peoples nick in your replies - it gets confusing otherwise
2007-02-22T15:06:00.000Z	PhyerFly		in my post i mentioned that If i use split tunneling i can get access to some ranges of my company's network - but if i specify the range that my local network is using (192.168.x.x)  OR turn off split tunnling completely - I'm connected to my work's network but cant reach anything
2007-02-22T15:08:00.000Z	PhyerFly		hmm, would vista have a different command for printing the routing table?
2007-02-22T15:09:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	- but when you manually mount you don't specify FS type
2007-02-22T15:09:00.000Z	slippyr4	distant_voice	: you have to reboot. you can think of fstab as a list of filesystems to automount
2007-02-22T15:10:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: in vista you probably need to be admin - so you need to run a shell as administrator to do the route print
2007-02-22T15:10:00.000Z	PhyerFly		k
2007-02-22T15:10:00.000Z	PhyerFly		only if you have user account control on
2007-02-22T15:11:00.000Z	slippyr4		phyerfly: is this linux box and windows box on the same subnet?
2007-02-22T15:11:00.000Z	PhyerFly	slippyr4	they are the same computer, just dual booted
