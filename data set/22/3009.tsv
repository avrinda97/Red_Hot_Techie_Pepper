2009-02-17T16:26:00.000Z	nagatzul		Good afternoon everyone :) I got a problem that is recurring on other Ubuntu puters too, when I record sound I get a loud noise that sounds like a slow fan... Any idea why?
2009-02-17T16:27:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	could be external noise, powerline hum, etc...
2009-02-17T16:28:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	it ain't there in Vista
2009-02-17T16:28:00.000Z	nagatzul		And it's way to loud to be external noise, it overpowers my voice
2009-02-17T16:29:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	Wrong module?
2009-02-17T16:29:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	Care to elaborate on that? :P
2009-02-17T16:30:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	A module is what Windows folks call a driver.
2009-02-17T16:30:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	This ugly little earpiece didn't come with drivers
2009-02-17T16:32:00.000Z	n2diy		nagatzul:ok, then you'll have to be more specific. A slow fan could be a lot of things?
2009-02-17T16:33:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	Further it seems like it's mainly in aMSn... Let me get you a short clip
2009-02-17T16:33:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	 D'oh... Now I got bigger issues :P
2009-02-17T16:34:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	What's the other issue? Don't bother sending me an audio, my speakerls aren't powered up.
2009-02-17T16:35:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	 It went from a distinct pulsing noise to giving me "[12:33:16] An error occured when trying to record the sound : Could not gain access to /dev/dsp for writing."
2009-02-17T16:36:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	???? DSP sounds like digital signal processing, but what generates the errer?
2009-02-17T16:36:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	The act of clicking the voiceclip button in amsn
2009-02-17T16:37:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	*sigh* This is getting worse, now aMsn closed down instead when I clicked it...
2009-02-17T16:38:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	Lemme just try the recorder in ubuntu first :P
2009-02-17T16:38:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	Do you have Audacity installed?
2009-02-17T16:39:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	Don't think so, however I noticed that it's fine in the regular recorder so it's an aMsn issue instead..
2009-02-17T16:40:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	ok, so we are sure it is external, and not coming from your box?
2009-02-17T16:40:00.000Z	nagatzul	n2diy	It only happens in aMsn so yes, positive.
2009-02-17T16:42:00.000Z	n2diy	nagatzul	ok, I'm not familiar witht aMsn, but if that seems to be the problem, sniff on that. Could it be a connection issue?
