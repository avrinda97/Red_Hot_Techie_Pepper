2005-10-30T15:16:00.000Z	MojOrow_		i can feel my linux newbishism just leaking away slowly but steadily
2005-10-30T15:16:00.000Z	MojOrow_		what kind of speeds am i supposed to get on a 10/100 network
2005-10-30T15:18:00.000Z	MojOrow_		do you think a router would be why it;s slower
2005-10-30T15:18:00.000Z	MojOrow_		and does the encryptioin have a large effect on the process
2005-10-30T15:19:00.000Z	MojOrow_		igotcha
2005-10-30T15:20:00.000Z	MojOrow_		what is an easier way to network the 2 computers to eachother in a secure way
2005-10-30T15:20:00.000Z	MojOrow_		well as secure as somthing can be that is on the internet
2005-10-30T15:21:00.000Z	MojOrow_		and i just did a check i did actually create a new directory
2005-10-30T15:21:00.000Z	MojOrow_		gret now i have 2 desktops
2005-10-30T15:22:00.000Z	MojOrow_		i have a similar setup
2005-10-30T15:22:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	place a network cable between them
2005-10-30T15:23:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	run cabling
2005-10-30T15:25:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	use ipsec?
2005-10-30T15:26:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	security is something of a double edged sword
2005-10-30T15:26:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	sure.
2005-10-30T15:27:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	use ipsec or a vpn tunnel between the machines but performance is going to suck and it's gonna be less reliable
2005-10-30T15:27:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	because you're adding more complexity
2005-10-30T15:27:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	and massive overheads
2005-10-30T15:28:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	what are you doing on this network?
2005-10-30T15:29:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	define securely?
2005-10-30T15:29:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	ahhhh....
2005-10-30T15:31:00.000Z	nevyn	MojOrow_	you're over complicating this. but learning a vpn solution of some description is valueable
