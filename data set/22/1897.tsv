2011-10-17T04:33:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	sudo service smbd restart
2011-10-17T04:33:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	unreconised service still
2011-10-17T04:34:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	is the sevice running at all ? > sudo service --status-all
2011-10-17T04:36:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	I am following a guide to get samba going but its fubar - they talk about installing samba, but it should be samba-common as far as I can work out
2011-10-17T04:37:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	yes, you need to start the deamon, smbd
2011-10-17T04:38:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	how?
2011-10-17T04:38:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	is samba in the same workgroup ?
2011-10-17T04:38:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	what you mean is it in same workgroup? same workgroup as whtaT?
2011-10-17T04:39:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	" sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf "and look for the line workgroup, different workgroup won't connect
2011-10-17T04:40:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	I dont want it to be in the same workgroup - I do want the service to start tho
2011-10-17T04:40:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	That the service is not running is the problem, no?
2011-10-17T04:42:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	i followed this guide to setup samba-shares, it can't be more simple > http://www.7tutorials.com/how-change-workgroup-ubuntu-linux-work-windows
2011-10-17T04:44:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	well bottom line is smbd is not running and sudo service smbd restart or start doesnt help - 'unrecognised service'
2011-10-17T04:45:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	are both samba and smbfs installed ?
2011-10-17T04:46:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	samba-common is
2011-10-17T04:46:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	hwo to check sambafs?
2011-10-17T04:47:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	you can check if it appears in the output of > apt-cache search samba
2011-10-17T04:48:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	No its not there
2011-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	oke, that is the part you are missing, sudo apt-get install smbfs
2011-10-17T04:50:00.000Z	al_nz1	OerHeks	ok smbfs is now installed
2011-10-17T04:53:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	now you can check the service is running, or start over and share the folder
2011-10-17T04:58:00.000Z	OerHeks	al_nz1	i think i got it now, all you need is to install samba & smbfs, not samba-common
