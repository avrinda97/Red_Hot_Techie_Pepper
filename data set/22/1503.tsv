2010-05-14T02:00:00.000Z	JodaZ		hmm, transmission is slow, whats a faster torrent client ?
2010-05-14T02:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	speed depends on seeds with torrents
2010-05-14T02:02:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	yeah, its just the general statistical overlook, average speeds are higher for the same average number of seeds/leechs on utorrent, a windows client
2010-05-14T02:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	depends on config really
2010-05-14T02:02:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	no, not really
2010-05-14T02:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	try a few ^ see which you like
2010-05-14T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	i find transmission quick, i have some configs which make it ok
2010-05-14T02:04:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	configs ? all you can config is the max number of connections
2010-05-14T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	;)
2010-05-14T02:05:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	its not funny
2010-05-14T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	is here
2010-05-14T02:05:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	its true, and its sad
2010-05-14T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	as I said, there are many many clients to choose from, see which you prefer
2010-05-14T02:06:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	if you look at it closely, thats why i came here, to ask for a recommendation
2010-05-14T02:08:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	i am not polling, i want some single personal recommendations, ususally when one person can really vouch for a app its good enough
2010-05-14T02:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	also cap your upload speed a bit to get higher downloads
2010-05-19T03:21:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	how to fix ?
2010-05-19T03:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	stupid automount does that
2010-05-19T03:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	disable automount
2010-05-19T03:22:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	where ?
2010-05-19T03:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JodaZ	kill the gnome-volume-manager process
2010-05-19T03:23:00.000Z	JodaZ	ActionParsnip	lol
