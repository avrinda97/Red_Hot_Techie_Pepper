2004-12-20T14:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones		Does anybody have any experience with hosting a BitTorrent stream ?
2004-12-20T14:10:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	no, but i don't assume its that hard, whats the problem
2004-12-20T14:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	I am looking for some statistical comparison between traditional file transfer methods like ftp and Bittorrent. I need to know how much potential bandwidth savings you gain by using BT over say FTP or Http.
2004-12-20T14:13:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	hmm
2004-12-20T14:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	I know it is going to vary depending on client's behind routers etc.. jsut a head to head comparison
2004-12-20T14:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	eh ?
2004-12-20T14:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	yeah but the clients help with the distribution as well
2004-12-20T14:14:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	you aren't saving bandwith... transferring a 70mb file is 70mb on ftp, http, and bt
2004-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	but the clients help with distributing the data to each other as opposed to getting it all from 1 server
2004-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	right
2004-12-20T14:16:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	no it isn't
2004-12-20T14:16:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	there are errors all the time
2004-12-20T14:17:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	this stuff to the overhead is soo small, the point is that a 70mb file IS a 70mb file
2004-12-20T14:18:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	what do you need the data for
2004-12-20T14:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	a project I am working on for later this fall
2004-12-20T14:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	distribution of lots and lots of data :D
2004-12-20T14:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	ftp or http is far too expensive for my limited budget
2004-12-20T14:21:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	don't forget, people have to sitll have the tracker and fully downloaded fil on there come to seed
2004-12-20T14:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	yeah but I am hoping people will be generous :)
2004-12-20T14:23:00.000Z	|QuaD-__	LinuxJones	how much bandwith do you need?
2004-12-20T14:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	Off the top of my head about 150 gig/month
2004-12-20T14:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	|QuaD-__	wtf, that's incredible. Wherre are the servers located in the US ?
