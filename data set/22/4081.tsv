2009-08-19T01:27:00.000Z	DrDuck		Could someone explain to me how to compile programs in ubuntu? Particularly C, as I'm having issues. I'm really not used to the linux/ubuntu platform. I'm a formal windows user, but have moved on to linux because supposedly it's a more natural environment for programming! Thanks
2009-08-19T01:28:00.000Z	ednos	DrDuck	type cc mysource.c -o myexecutable -Wall?
2009-08-19T01:29:00.000Z	ednos	DrDuck	are you trying to compile someone else's package, or are you trying to compile your own C program?
2009-08-19T01:29:00.000Z	DrDuck	MsMaco	all I've done thus far is write a simple program using gedit, called samp.c, I've also tried to compile it with the terminal but no luck
2009-08-19T01:30:00.000Z	DrDuck	MsMaco	gcc: samp.c: No such file or directory
2009-08-19T01:30:00.000Z	DrDuck		gcc: no input files
2009-08-19T01:30:00.000Z	DrDuck		samp.c is on my desktop btw if that means anything
2009-08-19T01:31:00.000Z	ednos	DrDuck	you need to be in the same directory as the file, so type "cd Desktop"
2009-08-19T01:31:00.000Z	DrDuck		miles@ubuntu:~$ cd desktop
2009-08-19T01:31:00.000Z	DrDuck		bash: cd: desktop: No such file or directory
2009-08-19T01:31:00.000Z	DrDuck		ehh
2009-08-19T01:31:00.000Z	ednos	DrDuck	use captial D
2009-08-19T01:31:00.000Z	ednos	DrDuck	it's case-sensitive
2009-08-19T01:32:00.000Z	DrDuck		ahh ok i've changed directories to desktop now
2009-08-19T01:32:00.000Z	ednos	DrDuck	now try that gcc command; when you're done, type ls, which should show a new file, "samp", which you can run with ./samp
2009-08-19T01:33:00.000Z	DrDuck	MsMaco	 Okay nice!
2009-08-19T01:33:00.000Z	DrDuck	MsMaco	 I hope I can remember how to do all of that in the future! :D
2009-08-19T01:34:00.000Z	DrDuck		oops
2009-08-19T01:34:00.000Z	DrDuck		didnt mean to do that lol
2009-08-19T01:36:00.000Z	DrDuck	MsMaco	 what does ls stand for??
2009-08-19T01:37:00.000Z	DrDuck	MsMaco	 How do I delete programs I no longer need? also I dont like having my programs on my desktop :< Is there a way I can change where they're saved?/
2009-08-19T01:37:00.000Z	ednos	DrDuck	click on Places > Home and make a folder in your home directory
