2006-09-25T11:44:00.000Z	kutan		Can someone tell me how to use chmod?
2006-09-25T11:44:00.000Z	kutan		I looked at it but it confused me even mroe
2006-09-25T11:44:00.000Z	kutan		more*
2006-09-25T11:45:00.000Z	kutan		soooo What does that mean to me?
2006-09-25T11:47:00.000Z	kutan		When I asked for help with chmod, what I really meant was, "Can someone give me the basic structure or an example of a chmod command?"
2006-09-25T11:48:00.000Z	kutan		localhost% chmod 777 pwn
2006-09-25T11:48:00.000Z	kutan		chmod: wrong mode
2006-09-25T11:50:00.000Z	kutan		still says wrong mode
2006-09-25T11:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	what is pwn?
2006-09-25T11:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	perhaps you don't have permissions to change it sudo chmod 777 pwn
2006-09-25T11:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	are you trying to make it executable?
2006-09-25T11:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	there is also chmod +x pwn
2006-09-25T11:52:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	hrm... wrong mode thats interesting
2006-09-25T11:53:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	where did you get the file from?
2006-09-25T11:55:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	is it in there exploits or ?
2006-09-25T11:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	that is a problem witht here server because that should work
2006-09-25T11:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	I just connected and tried to chmod it and couldn't either .
2006-09-25T11:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	I believe they want you to compile it first
2006-09-25T12:00:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	hrm..
2006-09-25T12:00:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	just trying to figure out what they mean by setuid
2006-09-25T12:01:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	alright i'm trying to figure it out.
2006-09-25T12:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	kutan	yeah I dunno seems to be a problem with their nix box
