2011-04-26T18:19:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	what was your problem
2011-04-26T18:20:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	is nothing working for you?
2011-04-26T18:20:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	my mic isn't working
2011-04-26T18:21:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	i'm trying to install backports modules atm .. ?
2011-04-26T18:21:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	thats not uncommon with newer laptops, each laptop has its own configuration
2011-04-26T18:22:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	it often gets fixed with time, so you could try to install the newest version of alsa, or you could fiddle with hda_analyzer.py
2011-04-26T18:22:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	will backports fix it?  i found a thread that says it worked for a bunch of people.  and if it does, should i get rid of this: options snd-hda-intel model=laptop
2011-04-26T18:23:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	rebooting, brb
2011-04-26T18:28:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	the snd-intel-hda option=model controls what kind see if yours is on here http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt
2011-04-26T18:28:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	i looked in there and the closest one i could find was toshiba Toshiba laptop support - tried and didn't work
2011-04-26T18:29:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	i just tried installing the backports modules and that didnt work either
2011-04-26T18:29:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	ok i would try hda_analyzer.py/wait for it to get fixed upstream in alsa
2011-04-26T18:30:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	however, when i used the "laptop" option in alsa-base.conf I get the same sound options as are now available since I installed the backports modules and removed those lines from the conf file
2011-04-26T18:30:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	maybe the "laptop" option and the backports are both just doing nothing
2011-04-26T18:30:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	what is hda_analyzer.py?
2011-04-26T18:31:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	its a program from alsa that you can download, which will allow you to manually control some soundcard options
2011-04-26T18:32:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	should i just use python run.py?
2011-04-26T18:32:00.000Z	escott	m0ksha	yes but as root. it pops up a somewhat confusing gui, so pm me and I'll take you through it off-channel
2011-04-26T18:33:00.000Z	m0ksha	escott	just got that
