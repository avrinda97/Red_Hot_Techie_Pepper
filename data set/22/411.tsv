2012-02-17T08:10:00.000Z	leo-unglaub		hi, i just tryed to install ubuntu from an usb drive but the installations al ways fails because ubuntu doesn't found the cd rom drive  sr0 ? why is ubuntu trying to load the cd rom drive if the complete iso is on the stick?
2012-02-17T08:10:00.000Z	leo-unglaub		i flashed with dd and the hybrid image and also tryed the usb creator
2012-02-17T08:11:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	use unetbootin, and check the iso first with md5sum
2012-02-17T08:11:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	i checked the iso and also tryed another oone from the xubuntu series
2012-02-17T08:14:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	oke, odd solution! >> disabled the floppy controller from BIOS
2012-02-17T08:14:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	disable or unplug?
2012-02-17T08:15:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	just disable it.
2012-02-17T08:15:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	okay, i will try that. yccording to google i am not the only one with this problem, do you think i should file a bug report? http://www.7loop.com/content/install-ubuntu-server-usb-without-cd
2012-02-17T08:16:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	can't find a recent one, only ones from 2008/2009
2012-02-17T08:17:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	what hardware are you trying to install ?
2012-02-17T08:18:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	intel i7, 16gb ddr3 ram, ssd-raid0
2012-02-17T08:18:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	should not have a floppy disc installed, awesome
2012-02-17T08:20:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	moment, why floppy? is sr0 not the cd rom drive?
2012-02-17T08:20:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	the solution is only valid if there is a floppy drive installed, ofcourse
2012-02-17T08:22:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	i am not well known with xubuntu, but to start with raid0, i need ubuntu alternate cd to do so...
2012-02-17T08:23:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	i an only using the alternate disc. and i just tryed the xubuntu to make sure it's not my normal ubuntu image
2012-02-17T08:25:00.000Z	OerHeks	leo-unglaub	i hope that would solve it. or boot it..
2012-02-17T08:25:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	i have to find a nother pc here..that could take some time :) big thanks for your help!
2012-02-17T22:12:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	hi, i was here yesterday with the problem installing from an usb drive.
2012-02-17T22:12:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	i just wannted to tell you that if found the cause of this error
2012-02-17T22:13:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	in case someone else has the same problem
2012-02-17T22:14:00.000Z	leo-unglaub	OerHeks	the solution is: dont install from an usb3 port. it simply don't work. if you use the usb2 port, everything is fine
