2007-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	FernLujan		can anyone help me please?
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	what is your problem
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	well, I followed one of MJR's "guides" that he posted a link to a bit earlier. if you scroll up and try to find one of MJR;s messages, he left a link on how to get the desktop effects working by modifying /etc/x11/xorg.conf
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	Well, I did everything he told me to do, and now my computer won't load graphically. it says that server x failed to initialize, so all I Have is my console.
2007-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	sorry making eye candy work properly is not something I'm good at it always crashes too much on my computer... oh wait I have an idea
2007-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	now I'm using my ubuntu CD to be on gaim
2007-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	what's the idea?
2007-04-21T07:54:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	ok... look I imagine that part of what you did was to edit xorg.conf right?
2007-04-21T07:54:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	yep
2007-04-21T07:54:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	and I would assume that before you edited it you make a back up by doing something like cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.desktope.bak
2007-04-21T07:55:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	all you need to do is to restore from the backup
2007-04-21T07:55:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	no, he didn't tell me anything like that
2007-04-21T07:55:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	so I guess I don't have a backup...
2007-04-21T07:56:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	I don't know pretty much anything. so I was just doing what this guy told me to do
2007-04-21T07:56:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	did you erase things in the xorg config file or just comment (###) them out?
2007-04-21T07:56:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	I remember something about editing some xorg.0. something file in /var/ or something like that... if it sounds familiar
2007-04-21T07:57:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	just added new things, and changed the Driver variable from vesa to radeon
2007-04-21T07:58:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	ok well if you can remember exactly what file that was you should be able to edit it and remove the new things (just put a # or mutiple ### in front of any line you added to comment it out (I think # is the comment character, not exactly sure maybe someone else can help)) OR there should be a command to reconfigure X but I can't remember it
2007-04-21T08:02:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	I think I found the comman you need. It should be sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg do that from the command line and hopefully all will be well.
2007-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	can I do that from the terminal here while using the ubuntu CD?
2007-04-21T08:04:00.000Z	nibsa1242	FernLujan	no I think you'll need to boot into the system... or chroot
2007-04-21T08:06:00.000Z	FernLujan	nibsa1242	Alright man, thanks a bunch. I'll ttyl
