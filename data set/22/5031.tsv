2007-10-01T06:17:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	i think its somewhere in menu.lst, though I forgot what the specific tweak is
2007-11-28T08:48:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	why does he need to look for his bash? hes probably using it right, I think?
2007-11-28T08:48:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	*right now
2007-11-28T08:48:00.000Z	usser	scguy318	well ./configure says his SHELL is not set to bash and refuses to run
2007-11-28T08:48:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	that's not what the message says
2007-11-28T08:49:00.000Z	usser	scguy318	http://pastebin.ca/800122
2007-11-28T08:50:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	perhaps, but the pastebin seems to complain about an environmental variable
2007-11-28T08:50:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	a message I generated from my term: bash: abcbbc: command not found
2007-11-28T08:51:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	ohhh, ohhh
2007-11-28T08:51:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	I misread you, I'm sorry

2007-11-28T10:17:00.000Z	usser	scguy318	just get ffmpeg from medibuntu repo
2007-11-28T10:17:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	well, I don't need at the moment, but thanks :)
2007-11-28T10:18:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	I believe he/she already has ffmpeg, so I'm guessing upgrade?
2007-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	usser	scguy318	hm but that ffmpeg is from ubuntu's repo no?
2007-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	usser	scguy318	oh u mean sudo apt-get upgrade?
2007-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	usser	scguy318	yea u can do that to
2007-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	scguy318	usser	yea
2007-11-28T10:20:00.000Z	usser	scguy318	but sudo apt-get install ffmpeg would work aslo even if he has it installed already
