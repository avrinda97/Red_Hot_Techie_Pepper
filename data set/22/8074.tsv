2011-11-06T02:56:00.000Z	m477		how to evaluate which window manager im using right now?
2011-11-06T02:56:00.000Z	reisio	m477	why do you ask
2011-11-06T02:58:00.000Z	m477	reisio	i want to check if i turned off compiz
2011-11-06T02:59:00.000Z	reisio	m477	pgrep -l compiz
2011-11-06T02:59:00.000Z	m477	reisio	1661 compiz thats mean not
2011-11-06T02:59:00.000Z	reisio	m477	that means compiz is running
2011-11-06T03:00:00.000Z	reisio	m477	probably in the X session you are currently using
2011-11-06T03:00:00.000Z	m477	reisio	in tweak ubuntu i turned it off ...
2011-11-06T03:00:00.000Z	reisio	m477	did you log out and back in?
2011-11-06T03:00:00.000Z	m477	reisio	i dont remember
2011-11-06T03:01:00.000Z	reisio	m477	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2011-11-06T03:01:00.000Z	m477	reisio	10.04
2011-11-06T03:01:00.000Z	reisio	m477	you can probably run killall compiz and metacity --replace
2011-11-06T03:02:00.000Z	m477	reisio	it wouldnt crash system?
2011-11-06T03:03:00.000Z	reisio	m477	it shouldn't, no
2011-11-06T03:03:00.000Z	reisio	m477	window managers manage windows
2011-11-06T03:03:00.000Z	reisio	m477	even if you turn them all off, everything will be there, you just won't be able to manage a window until you turn one back on :p
2011-11-06T03:04:00.000Z	m477	reisio	ok i did it but, i dont have prompt after metacity --replace
2011-11-06T03:04:00.000Z	m477	reisio	i mean it is working...
2011-11-06T03:04:00.000Z	reisio	m477	should probably run it from an ALT+F2
2011-11-06T03:05:00.000Z	m477	reisio	great thanks
2011-11-06T03:05:00.000Z	reisio	m477	and hopefully next time you log out or reboot it will respect your pref of not using compiz
