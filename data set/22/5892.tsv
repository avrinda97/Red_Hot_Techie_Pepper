2007-05-03T05:14:00.000Z	noname		I need some help with these weird 'moving' icons
2007-05-03T05:15:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	Stop drinking
2007-05-03T05:15:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	Yeah, you have to right click and unlock them before moving
2007-05-03T05:18:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	No but, my sound/date/log out button shifted over and won't move back
2007-05-03T05:18:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	So did mine when changing to widescreen. Right click each icon, uncheck "Lock to panel" then drag them
2007-05-03T05:19:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	If unlocking doesn't work, right click and choos emove
2007-05-03T05:20:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	Reboot?
2007-05-03T05:20:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	If roaming is enabled in the networking manager it should start up
2007-05-03T05:20:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	But what is the name of the default network manager?
2007-05-03T05:20:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	Networkmanager
2007-05-03T05:20:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	networkmanager-gnome is the icon (I think)
2007-05-03T05:22:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	You will be better off rebooting
2007-05-03T05:23:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	Right click > add to panel?
2007-05-03T05:44:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	haha alright sorry... back to you then. I found the .desktop file that loads the applet but it's not showing up in my menu bar. Is there some way I can make that happen again?
2007-05-03T06:22:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	Is it set to roaming?
2007-05-03T06:23:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	When I go into add to panel and add the network manager (which is different than the one I want) it IS set to roaming
2007-05-03T06:23:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	System > administration > networking. make sure roaming is checked on your wireless card
2007-05-03T06:24:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	It is enabled
2007-05-03T06:26:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	Would roaming being off cause the icon to not show up in the top panel?
2007-05-03T06:26:00.000Z	rbs-tito	noname	Mayb
2007-05-03T06:27:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	Well it's enabled and the internet is working fine.
2007-05-03T06:27:00.000Z	noname	rbs-tito	My wireless status light no longer lights up on my laptop, though. which is odd...
