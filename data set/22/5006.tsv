2007-09-03T05:14:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	yeah
2007-09-03T05:14:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	and it's "thumbdrive"
2007-09-03T05:14:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	Just ask your question
2007-09-03T05:15:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	Your motherboard has to support booting from a USB drive
2007-09-03T05:15:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	and you just copy the contents of the ISO to your thumbdrive
2007-09-03T05:18:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	What menu is this exactly?
2007-09-03T05:18:00.000Z	soskel	Ahadiel	bios
2007-09-03T05:18:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	usb_hdd I'd assume
2007-09-03T05:23:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	Sure
2007-09-03T05:43:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	What's your question?
2007-09-03T05:43:00.000Z	soskel	Ahadiel	Which boot option do I choose? I tried USB-HDD and it didn;t work
2007-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	Well it should've been USB-HDD, but just try others
2007-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	No... an ISO is a CD/DVD Image
2007-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	soskel	Ahadiel	can you link me again to the documentation about booting froma thumbdrive please?
2007-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	Google for it
2007-09-03T05:45:00.000Z	Ahadiel	soskel	I never linked them in the first place
