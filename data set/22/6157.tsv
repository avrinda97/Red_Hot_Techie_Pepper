2006-12-10T07:06:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	it's rude to ask a question and then change nicks
2006-12-10T07:07:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	I suspect you made a mistake during the partitioning stage.
2006-12-10T07:08:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	when you've decided how you are going to partition, you have to hit 'Apply' to make it actually do it
2006-12-10T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	what installation medium are you using? The edgy desktop CD?
2006-12-10T07:10:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	i cannot tell you.. i know that there is two cd`s.. and the one is LIVE cd and the other is installation
2006-12-10T07:11:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	where did you get them?
2006-12-10T07:12:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	are you sure they are Ubuntu CDs?
2006-12-10T07:12:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	something like promotion..
2006-12-10T07:12:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	what version?
2006-12-10T07:13:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	i dont know..
2006-12-10T07:13:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	my friend give it to me.
2006-12-10T07:13:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	the right problem is it dont recognize the partitions..
2006-12-10T07:14:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	I still think you haven't created any partitions.
2006-12-10T07:16:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	but on the desktop i can see the hard disk..
2006-12-10T07:18:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	well help me how can i make partitions
2006-12-10T07:19:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	have you booted the live CD now?
2006-12-10T07:21:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	I am pretty sure you've got an old version, 5.10, codename Breezy Badger. Don't bother installing it. Get the latest release, 6.10
2006-12-10T07:22:00.000Z	shlajfka	soundray	i have a new comp. dont have any OS.. and i need to work:)
2006-12-10T07:23:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	well, you already have a problem with those CDs which is difficult to solve because it is an old version.
2006-12-10T07:23:00.000Z	soundray	shlajfka	so yes, there is a difference
