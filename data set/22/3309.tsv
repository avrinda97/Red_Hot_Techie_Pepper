2008-10-25T20:42:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK		after changing to bash
2008-10-25T20:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	GaMbi_DK	 it does need to be executable for that to work.. and spelled right.
2008-10-25T20:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	GaMbi_DK	 also ive seen some scripts that have extra cr/line feeds at the end of the first line.. goof things up.
2008-10-25T20:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	GaMbi_DK	 could be the script is working.. and its designed to check itslf.. and spit out that error if it thinks its currupted...

2008-10-25T21:01:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	dr_willis	I run "gedit /home/gambi/Desktop/linux_installer.sh" and it open gedit and the right tab for the file.. a message is there "Could not open the file /home/gambi/Desktop/linux_installer.sh."  "gedit has not been able to detect the character coding.Please check that you are not trying to open a binary file.Select a character coding from the menu and try again."
