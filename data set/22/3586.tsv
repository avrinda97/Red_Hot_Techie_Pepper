2008-07-28T05:05:00.000Z	sn4k3	kitche	and which part of this is about my problem?
2008-07-28T05:06:00.000Z	kitche	sn4k3	it tells you how to fix your issue
2008-07-28T05:06:00.000Z	sn4k3	kitche	i thought i was on ubuntu channel and it's all about windows
2008-07-28T05:07:00.000Z	kitche	sn4k3	opps wrong url
2008-07-28T05:09:00.000Z	kitche	sn4k3	put this in your xorg.conf Option "AGPMode" "4" under your video card driver section
2008-07-28T05:10:00.000Z	kitche	sn4k3	you might have to use UseInternalAGPGART as well
2008-07-28T05:11:00.000Z	kitche	sn4k3	nope 4 will make it use 8x mode for some odd reason
2008-07-28T05:12:00.000Z	kitche	sn4k3	the kernel sets it to 4x but xorg will change it to 8x it will disable the kernel agpart so xorg can override the 4x
2008-07-28T05:15:00.000Z	kitche	sn4k3	if you do set UseInternalAGPGART to no in xorg.conf but you need to look that up to get the exact way to use it sicne I've never had to mess around with agp sicne all my computers use pci or pci-x
2008-07-28T05:16:00.000Z	sn4k3	kitche	ok, thx for the infos
