2008-11-06T09:44:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	there is none.  you can edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf or you can use the tools in the admin menu in Gnome
2008-11-06T09:45:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	ah, I didn't know that's what you were looking for.  that command doesn't tend to offer much use
2008-11-06T09:47:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	as I said, there is none.  you either set it in the admin menu, or you edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf  =)
2008-11-06T09:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	Xorg automatically detects your resolution and sets it to the highest available
2008-11-06T09:52:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	it has been years since I've seen a resolution selector from the install script.  Xorg likes everything to be automatic now.  xorg.conf is empty on most modern Xorg versions
2008-11-06T09:53:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	what is the problem you're having ?
2008-11-06T09:58:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	okay, your issue appears to be that the PCI identifier has changed, or else the nvidia kernel module (driver) is not loaded
2008-11-06T09:58:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	please paste the result of this command: lspci | grep -i vga
2008-11-06T09:59:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	yes, the PCI id has changed.  open  up your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the PCI id in the device section to 40:0:0
2008-11-06T10:00:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	do you know how to edit the xorg.cong file as root ?
2008-11-06T10:01:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	can you paste into a query what is in your device section(s)
2008-11-06T10:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	try adding this to the "device" section:   BusID  "PCI:40:0:0"
2008-11-06T10:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	also add this:   Driver  "nvidia"
2008-11-06T10:03:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	after you have added those two, save and quit, then confirm if your nVIDIA driver is loaded right now: grep nvidia /proc/modules
2008-11-06T10:05:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	so have you added the two lines I mentioned ?
2008-11-06T10:06:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	try running "X" now to see if it will load, then if it does load, kill it with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
2008-11-06T10:07:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	the only time you need to reboot is to upgrade or downgrade the Linux kernel
2008-11-06T10:10:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	so did X load ?  if not, paste the error messages into a query
2008-11-06T10:13:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	what happened ?
2008-11-06T10:13:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	zerodamage	no ?
