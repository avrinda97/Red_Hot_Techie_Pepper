2008-04-11T06:18:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	is that xchat only?
2008-04-11T06:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	pong
2008-04-11T06:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	eduardo works in lots of things.
2008-04-11T08:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	yep and it might not like the spaces in the name.. when you start a folder with . it's hidden
2008-04-11T08:07:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	spaces are fine, i've got plenty of spaces in my other folder names
2008-04-11T08:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	wasn't quite sure..
2008-04-11T08:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	is there a way to make it not hidden, aside from removing the . at the beginning?
2008-04-11T08:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	nope
2008-04-12T11:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	 the names come in alphabetical order..
2008-04-12T11:01:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	so do hurricanes, but they're still stupid names
2008-04-12T11:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	something we can all ponder/wonder/chuckle at.
2008-12-09T05:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	I must be the exception.. I've had nothing but issues with emerald
2008-12-09T05:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	Odd, I really haven't heard of anybody having problems with it :P
2009-02-13T05:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	did you install nvidia drivers that came directly from the nvidia site?
2009-02-13T05:01:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	Aye
2009-02-13T05:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	when I installed mine I first opened synaptic and uninstalled all references to nvidia that were installed.. then installed from a tty with the gdm stopped.. worked like a champ.. put 180.29 in today and automatically uninstalled the 180.22 drivers I had in there.
2009-02-13T05:03:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	I've learned long ago to not even install the nvidia repos versions
2009-02-13T05:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	With the exception of intrepid on my laptop they've never even worked
2009-02-13T05:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	suprizingly the 177 drivers worked for me on my laptop with an 8400 card in hardy but wouldn't on my desktop with an 8200 card.. the 180.29 drivers actaully make the screen writes almost tolerable.
2009-02-13T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	dmsuperman	desktop was intrepid
2009-02-13T05:06:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Scunizi	I can't even get X to start with intrepid on my desktop
