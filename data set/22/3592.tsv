2012-01-29T07:34:00.000Z	myk_robinson		had a few weird happenings with the laptop lately. I shut down the laptop, but if I open the lid, it comes back on automatically. Seems to be somehow linked with making some changes in powertop. Anyone else seen this?
2012-01-29T07:36:00.000Z	Mitchell	myk_robinson	I have not run into that problem. Sounds more so like a hardware issue rather than OS.
2012-01-29T07:36:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	its a possiblity, just hasnt happened until recently, and I have had the same laptop since August.
2012-01-29T07:37:00.000Z	myk_robinson		Either an update or me messing with powertop. Guess I can try shutting down without powertop tweaks to confirm
2012-01-29T07:37:00.000Z	Mitchell	myk_robinson	What kind of laptop is it?
2012-01-29T07:38:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	a Lenovo Ideapad Z570
2012-01-29T07:38:00.000Z	Mitchell	myk_robinson	I have the same one. Are you running Ubuntu 11.10?
2012-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	myk_robinson		yes
2012-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	myk_robinson		have been since day one, this just started happening last week
2012-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	Mitchell		myk_robinson:
2012-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	Mitchell	myk_robinson	What tweaks have you made since last week?
2012-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	I followed the directions for getting better battery life by googling ubuntu power tweaks
2012-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	added some parameters tot GRUB
2012-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	and when I am on battery, run powertop to switch all options to "Good"
2012-01-29T07:42:00.000Z	Mitchell	myk_robinson	Ok. I would reverse the tweaks you made. The tweaks seem to be interfering with proper shutdown. Try reversing it and see if it helps
2012-01-29T07:42:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	easy enough. How's your battery life on yours? Is it the i3 model?
2012-01-29T07:43:00.000Z	Mitchell		Yes. It is running Intel i3 Processor. And I get about 4 hours out of it
2012-01-29T07:44:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	dang.. ANy special tweaks to get that?
2012-01-29T07:44:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Mitchell	Mine is somewhere around 2-2.5hrs
2012-01-29T07:47:00.000Z	Mitchell	myk_robinson	No I just charge my battery when it is completely dry. Which is about every other day. I only use mine for about 2 hours a day. Tip: Don't keep your laptop plugged in all of the time. If you are going to, take the battery out while doing so. In order to fully saturate a lithium-ion battery, it has to be run down completely, and then charged for about 6 hours (depending on if 6 or 9 cell battery). I recommend doing
2012-01-29T07:48:00.000Z	Mitchell		this over night. I have had mine for about 6  months. Also keep brightness low. Little things add up.
2012-01-29T07:49:00.000Z	Mitchell	myk_robinson	Hope this helped. Got to go.
