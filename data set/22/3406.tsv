2010-08-17T05:07:00.000Z	opij		if you have an encrypted /home/, do you only need your sudo password to transfer that same /home/ to a new install and flavor or do you need some other password? Also, how would you go about transferring /home/ to a new install?
2010-08-17T05:08:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	the copying of /home is same, and of course you also need the key for the crypted part
2010-08-17T05:08:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	how do you obtain your key?
2010-08-17T05:09:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	when you set the crypt up, you have to set it
2010-08-17T05:09:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	i didn't set it
2010-08-17T05:09:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	i just did the auto setup
2010-08-17T05:09:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	how do i obtain it
2010-08-17T05:13:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	I think you speak about EncFS, done at setup, that's handled by a kernelmodule and will be found again in a fresh installation
2010-08-17T05:14:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	i need to copy my old home folder to a new installation. i want to change to a new flavor
2010-08-17T05:15:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	yes, just do in a seperate partition, get the blkid of it and set fstab to it, pastebin of you current fstab ?
2010-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	im sorry but i dont know what you're talking about at all
2010-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	can also do so at setup of fresh install
2010-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2010-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	pastebinit /etc/fstab                   <<give url here
2010-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	why do you want me to pastebin something?
2010-08-17T05:17:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	to get an idea of your current setup
2010-08-17T05:17:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	will what hiexpo said work?
2010-08-17T05:17:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	yes
2010-08-17T05:18:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	can also save from the opened home to an external and just copy back
2010-08-17T05:18:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	use rsync -r -P instead of copy
2010-08-17T05:19:00.000Z	opij	DasEi	cool. what does rsync -r -P do and in what setting would I preform it?
2010-08-17T05:20:00.000Z	DasEi	opij	it's an advanced algorithm, faster, more reliable, -r for subfolders , -P for progress
