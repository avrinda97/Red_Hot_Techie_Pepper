2007-06-29T09:18:00.000Z	geekkit		and more on codecs: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2731402
2007-06-29T09:18:00.000Z	geekkit		specifically type in: sudo apt-get install totem-xine libxine1 libxine1-ffmpeg libxine-extracodecs libdvdnav4 libdvdplay0 libdvdread3
2007-06-29T09:18:00.000Z	geekkit		for me that worked for DVD too
2007-06-29T09:19:00.000Z	ermac0	geekkit	you got it
2007-06-29T09:19:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	i've had no problems since i did that :-)
2007-06-29T09:19:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	i have *all* media needs met after a few searches and sudo calls ;-)
2007-06-29T09:19:00.000Z	ermac0	geekkit	yea plus totem is all i need to don't need extra whistles
2007-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	exactly.
2007-06-29T09:21:00.000Z	ermac0	geekkit	plus yea it works with the other players it comes with , since it uses the same codecs
2007-06-29T09:21:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	oh yeah....im truly amazed at 7.04 it really does everytthing i want it to :-)
2007-06-29T09:22:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	6.10 missed a few things but 7.04 caught up fast ... including USB support that doesnt crash the kernel
2007-06-29T09:30:00.000Z	ermac0	geekkit	more than 10
2007-06-29T09:31:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	yeah, true, we're talking days of jumpers...like when you had to install soundblaster soundcards
2007-06-29T09:31:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	like when VBE 2.0 was just made a standard....and then win 95 came out and made it obsolete
2007-06-29T09:32:00.000Z	ermac0	geekkit	the good ol days of SB cards and AC 97
2007-06-29T09:32:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	hah! i remember those days.
2007-06-29T09:40:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	i tried converting my wife but she couldn't because she needs simply accounting and WINE doesn't play that
2007-06-29T09:40:00.000Z	ermac0	geekkit	the wife doesn't understand all the weird characters in ubuntu, thats what she calls them
2007-06-29T09:41:00.000Z	geekkit	ermac0	same with my wife...but i almost got her hooked when i showed her all the script-FU filters in GIMP that made her think that photoshop was crap ;-)
2007-06-29T09:42:00.000Z	ermac0	geekkit	yup
