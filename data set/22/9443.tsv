2005-03-07T16:40:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Is there any project that has tried to do... "X forwarding takeover"? Like "screen" in a terminal, so you can start an X app on one PC, then continue it on another? Anybody know something? :)
2005-03-07T16:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	I think freenx can do something like that
2005-03-07T16:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	maybe look at the No MAchine site (they have client downloads) The server software is proprietary but freenx does the same thing
2005-03-22T14:21:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	lol :D
2005-04-12T08:54:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	I just checked on my laptop... doesn't matter if the mount point directory is readable by others than root.
2005-04-12T08:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	ah OK - thanks I'll remember that :)
2005-04-12T08:55:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	Wasn't really sure either. :)
2005-04-12T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	mine is 755 for some reason...
2005-04-12T08:56:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	Yeah mine as well... that's default for new directories, right?
2005-04-12T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	yes, I think umask handles that
2005-08-07T09:32:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	I'm sometimes quite puzzled about how many developers send out their source without info on the libs... it's like "Find out yourself" ;)
2005-08-09T16:40:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	Only on startup... if a program is running it doesn't need as much CPU.
2005-08-09T16:40:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	I got a huge IRC bot running on a K6 200... it uses quite some memory, but only about 10% CPU... on that machine. :)
2005-08-09T16:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	this was just sitting there doing nothing at 50%
2005-08-09T16:41:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	Maybe badly written... I use many Java programs and none are that way. :)
2005-08-09T16:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	I see - this was a java game in galeon browser
2005-08-09T16:42:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	Applets are often badly coded... and they need much resources anyway.
2005-08-09T16:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	OK - I'll take your word for it - I have little use for these online java thingies anyway so it doesn't really bother me
2005-11-02T06:30:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	Usually it's not that important... a few bugs fixed, maybe a security hole... that's about it.
2005-11-02T06:31:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	If you don't use Java software or applets from untrusted people/web sites it's alright to stay at an old one.
2005-11-02T06:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tomcat_	that was more or less my assumption :)
2006-12-23T09:12:00.000Z	Tomcat_	thoreauputic	samern: Yeah, both work.
