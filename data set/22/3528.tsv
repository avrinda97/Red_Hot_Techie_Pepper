2008-08-13T23:54:00.000Z	deeperror	mrpiracy	extract the file in a folder your user has permissions in
2008-08-13T23:54:00.000Z	deeperror	mrpiracy	or do   sudo tar zxvf filename.tar.gz
2008-08-13T23:54:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	i am trying to save it into my home folder
2008-08-13T23:54:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	using "archive manager"
2008-08-13T23:56:00.000Z	deeperror	mrpiracy	that i'm not sure
2008-08-13T23:57:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	so do i have to go command line everytime i need to uninstall a package?
2008-08-13T23:57:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	ops, unpack*
2008-08-13T23:57:00.000Z	deeperror	mrpiracy	it doesn't sound like you are installing packages as you are working with gz files?  Wouldn't that be source?
2008-08-13T23:58:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	it's skype ... i just got it from their website ... it comes in a gz package
2008-08-13T23:58:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	i think i'll have to extract and run ./configure
2008-08-13T23:59:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	anyway, i wanted to stop ubuntu from asking my password ALL THE TIME, it's annoying
2008-08-13T23:59:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	looks like UAC in Vista
2008-08-14T00:00:00.000Z	deeperror	mrpiracy	you should download the .dev file for ubuntu set permissions on that to +x and execute it
2008-08-14T00:00:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	there's no deb file
2008-08-14T00:03:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	ohhh, yes, sorry ... i am trying skype AND songbird RC2
2008-08-14T00:04:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	songbird is the one in gz file
2008-08-14T00:04:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	but skype now is telling me it's wrong architecture i386 (i'm on x64)
2008-08-14T00:04:00.000Z	deeperror	mrpiracy	i go command line when working on most things so not sure how to further assist on that
2008-08-14T00:06:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	can i bypass this check on architecture? i had skype working in my previous x64 ubuntu install
2008-08-14T00:06:00.000Z	deeperror	mrpiracy	probably need to go from source then on skype and configure from there
2008-08-14T00:07:00.000Z	mrpiracy	deeperror	ok, thx, gonna give it a try
