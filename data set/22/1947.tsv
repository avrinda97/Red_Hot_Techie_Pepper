2009-11-12T10:17:00.000Z	Billiard	denis_k	maybe try to install it i have never used it
2009-11-25T11:43:00.000Z	Billiard	denis_k	you can see the list of users in the gui ?

2009-11-25T11:51:00.000Z	Billiard	denis_k	your users seem to be a mess, you shouldnt have a user a member of the root group
2009-11-25T11:57:00.000Z	denis_k	Billiard	when I turn on my wifi now, I get a black screen with a xterm cursor, and caps lock blinks and freezes up
2009-11-25T11:58:00.000Z	denis_k	Billiard	groups: root adm dialout fax cdrom tape audio dip video plugdev fuse lpadmin netdev admin sambashare
2009-11-25T12:01:00.000Z	Billiard	denis_k	i have no idea with the wifi prob, you shouldnt be in the root group
2009-11-25T12:03:00.000Z	Billiard	denis_k	if wireless works correctly on the live cd, you could reinstall, you can delete the users without deleting their home dirs, but you can just change their groups
2009-11-25T12:05:00.000Z	denis_k	Billiard	I feel like i've already tried that by making the new user, but it didn't help with anything, I'll just reinstall - oh well atleast my windows partition will save me :)  thanks for the help!
2009-11-25T12:05:00.000Z	Billiard	denis_k	ok np
