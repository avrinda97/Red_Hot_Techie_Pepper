2005-12-11T09:23:00.000Z	cyphase		Is Ubuntu going to support per user application installation? Meaning, a user can intstall an application in their home directory without admin rights, using a package manager
2005-12-11T09:25:00.000Z	sonare	cyphase	you can bar users from executing certain programs
2005-12-11T09:25:00.000Z	cyphase	sonare	what's that got to do with it?
2005-12-11T09:25:00.000Z	sonare	cyphase	i think it would be a bad idea because of dependencies on the whole system
2005-12-11T09:25:00.000Z	cyphase	sonare	i mean users should be able to install applications in their home directory without admin rights
2005-12-11T09:28:00.000Z	sonare	cyphase	i think you have a good idea there but i think the security problem will overshadow things
2005-12-11T09:31:00.000Z	cyphase	sonare	what security problems were you talking about?
2005-12-11T09:32:00.000Z	cyphase	sonare	the programs will be from the repositories..
2005-12-11T09:33:00.000Z	cyphase	sonare	i think you're misunderstanding me
2005-12-11T09:33:00.000Z	sonare	cyphase	you have a good idea there
2005-12-11T09:53:00.000Z	sonare	cyphase	he is saying that to be silly i think.
2005-12-11T10:05:00.000Z	cyphase	sonare	what support?
2005-12-11T10:05:00.000Z	cyphase	sonare	i'm just kidding. i have no idea
