2005-03-11T09:42:00.000Z	veristead		i bet it can be compiled

2005-03-11T09:42:00.000Z	veristead		i went to the ship it page
2005-03-11T09:42:00.000Z	veristead		without really reading

2005-03-11T09:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	you don't need to compile kde - it's available in the universe repository
2005-03-20T15:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	you have a misconception of the term "hacker"
2005-03-20T15:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	no, the dyslexic spelling was right and we got it the first time :)
2005-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	apt-cche search is our friend :)
2005-03-21T09:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	which was frozen in October, I believe
2005-03-21T10:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	if it's erroring out of "make", it isn't compiled
2005-03-21T10:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	you need apt-get build-dep and dpkg-buildpackage
2005-03-21T10:15:00.000Z	veristead	thoreauputic	why do i need that?
2005-03-21T10:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	so why would you expect repeating the procedure to fix it?
2005-03-21T10:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	because it installs your deps automatially and makes a deb package for you?
2005-03-21T10:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	were there docs? Did you read them?
2005-03-21T10:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	veristead	few packages would use /usr/local  - that would be used for things you build yourself
