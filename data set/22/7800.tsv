2006-11-19T08:12:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		I probably should mention I've successfully installed it before, but was having problems getting the integrated video (gma900) to display at my lcd monitor's native res (16x10).. so I bought a cheap nvidia graphics card
2006-11-19T08:13:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		and I'm doing a fresh reinstall since I hadn't configured anything
2006-11-19T08:14:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		hehe :)
2006-11-19T08:14:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		I was wondering if there's a way to configure software raid during install actually.. or would I have to use the server install CD and do it manually
2006-11-19T08:14:00.000Z	we2by	rbrtoclto	I think I have the same video card as you do
2006-11-19T08:15:00.000Z	rbrtoclto	we2by	I searched the forums and used 915resolution and modelines, but no joy.. so just went and got a real video card
2006-11-19T08:17:00.000Z	we2by	rbrtoclto	I have the white macbook
2006-11-19T08:17:00.000Z	we2by		I think it got the intel gma card
2006-11-19T08:17:00.000Z	rbrtoclto	we2by	are you running in native 12x9 or whatever it is?
2006-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	we2by		native12x9? what do u mean?
2006-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	we2by		Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller

2006-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		the video bios in the macbooks is probably correct though.. my problem is it wasn't with my diy PC
2006-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	rbrtoclto	we2by	native resolution for the laptop's display.. 1200x900 pixels.. whatever the exact number is :)
2006-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	we2by		oh, yea. it is
2006-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	we2by	rbrtoclto	I'm using 915resolution
2006-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	rbrtoclto	we2by	it didn't work for me :(  I just get the display saying "out of range"
2006-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	we2by	rbrtoclto	can you  tell me th eexact resolution from xorg.conf?
2006-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	rbrtoclto	we2by	mine is 1680x1050
2006-11-19T08:21:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		when is a LTS version of edgy due?  or not at all
