2005-05-06T05:41:00.000Z	neighborlee		just wondering will there ever be a hook into say firefox to allow installing of .deb 's ?
2005-05-06T05:42:00.000Z	neighborlee		nice
2005-05-06T05:44:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	eruin install .deb files off the internet is a very very bad thing
2005-05-06T05:44:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	as a whole I trust the linux community..
2005-05-06T05:44:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	but I get your point
2005-05-06T05:45:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	you have to look beyond the issue of just the linux community
2005-05-06T05:45:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	yes i realize
2005-05-06T05:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	but come on..;-)...if its okay for RHEE and fedora and mdk..( mabye suse I dont know).then I can't imagine its considered a security hole ;-)
2005-05-06T05:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	umm, mdk/fh/rh don't have the power of apt
2005-05-06T05:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	?
2005-05-06T05:52:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	and I am saying that install of the web is a terrible idea, and will not hurt linux in the long run
2005-05-06T06:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	there are some serious technical issues to be solved to make d-i havea gui
2005-05-06T06:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	I knew they had solved several and working on like what...10 more or something ?
2005-05-06T06:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	or i'm thinking of ananconda thread ;-)
2005-05-06T06:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	anaconda, from what I understand, is borked inside
2005-05-06T06:18:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	correct
2005-05-06T06:18:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	thats how I read it as well...can't use it anyway as d-i has to work on a myriad of hardware which ananconda I understand can't or not easily
2005-05-06T06:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	LOL
2005-05-06T06:24:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	and btw, I have a bridge to sell you
2005-05-06T06:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	heheh
2005-05-11T05:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	neighborlee	nothing currently
2005-05-11T05:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	Burgundavia	ok thank you for verification
