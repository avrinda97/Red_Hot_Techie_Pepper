2008-10-08T22:34:00.000Z	Kassah-lappy		is there any way to disable the touchpad on my laptop?
2008-10-08T22:34:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Kassah-lappy	i know how it can be done on an eeepc
2008-10-08T22:35:00.000Z	Kassah-lappy	outbackwifi	is it a hardware turn off? or a software?
2008-10-08T22:35:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Kassah-lappy	it unloads the synaptics module on press of a hotkey
2008-10-08T22:36:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Kassah-lappy	exactly, i used a spare one and wrote a script
2008-10-08T22:37:00.000Z	Kassah-lappy	outbackwifi	what's the module name? I'm not seeing
2008-10-08T22:37:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Kassah-lappy	its called psmouse on my laptop
2008-10-08T22:39:00.000Z	Kassah-lappy	outbackwifi	hmm... unloading that module got the nipple mouse too =(
2008-10-08T22:40:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Kassah-lappy	sorry, like i said my eeepc doesnt have that other mouse. I use this with an external usb mouse so that i can type uninterrupted
2008-10-08T22:41:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Kassah-lappy	if you'd like, ill pastebin my script that also includes a nifty python based notifier
2008-10-08T22:41:00.000Z	Kassah-lappy	outbackwifi	that would be nice... since I can proboly adapt it to disable just the touchpad when I figure out how
2008-10-08T22:42:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Kassah-lappy	ok
