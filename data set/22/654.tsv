2011-05-28T10:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Drunkytones	is the ram ok? Does it boot liveCD ok?
2011-05-28T10:28:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	it happens booting from the live cd if I don't specify apci=off, and in the "recovery mode" kernel, even if I do specify it
2011-05-28T10:28:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	bazhang checked ram with memtest, no errors
2011-05-28T10:28:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	I was able to boot into the livecd and install lubuntu with apci=off, I just can't boot into it from grub it seems
2011-05-28T10:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Drunkytones	did you add the boot option in grub2?
2011-05-28T10:29:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	manually, yes. I haven't done it permanently since I can't get into the OS to change it
2011-05-28T10:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Drunkytones	boot to liveCD and use a chrrot to do it
2011-05-28T10:30:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	alright, here goes
2011-05-28T10:32:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	alright, starting from this guide (chroot) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20from%20LiveCD
2011-05-28T10:39:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	so do you think I should have apci=off and nomodeselect as the only boot options?
2011-05-28T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Drunkytones	leave the usual: quiet splash   to
2011-05-28T10:41:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	I thought taking them off might give more information, and I can always put them back later
2011-05-28T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Drunkytones	true, you can always readd later
2011-05-28T10:46:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	alright rebooting
2011-05-28T10:47:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	I still get the scary text
2011-05-28T10:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Drunkytones	boot messages
2011-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	these are not normal boot messages though
2011-05-28T11:24:00.000Z	Drunkytones	ActionParsnip	was helping me earlier, but it looks like he went to bed
