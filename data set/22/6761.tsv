2007-06-25T13:11:00.000Z	Tixer		yeah
2007-06-25T13:11:00.000Z	Tixer		I have a script that drops my dynamic IP nightly, and gets a new one
2007-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	Tixer		It then emails a few hotmail / gmail / yahoo accounts, posts on Wikipedia, and a bunch of other shit.
2007-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	Tixer		To get TO said IP, you need to log in.
2007-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	Tixer		Since it's email accounts :)
2007-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	Tixer		Noone can ban it if they don't know the IP
2007-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	Tixer		and they're not going to knock out every webmail provider
2007-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	Tixer		Think a massive torrent farm :)
2007-06-25T13:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Tixer	everyone can design a security system they can't see any way to break
2007-06-25T13:16:00.000Z	Tixer	gordonjcp	Find a way to break my security then :)
2007-06-25T13:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Tixer	I have

2007-06-25T13:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Tixer	hint - how do other people find out what the new IP or hostname is?
2007-06-25T13:18:00.000Z	Tixer		By checking an email?
2007-06-25T13:19:00.000Z	Tixer		IP isn't IDable or tracable
2007-06-25T13:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp		08:18 < Tixer> IP isn't IDable or tracable
2007-06-25T13:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp		er, what?
2007-06-25T13:19:00.000Z	Tixer		move discussion to #randomness plzkthx.
2007-06-25T13:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Tixer	-> #ubuntu-offtopic ;-)
