2011-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	Eitan		so gents, i have the task of setting up 10 new desktops
2011-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	Eitan		put the hardware together, and install software, i would like do go with ubuntu and its great gui
2011-05-27T05:55:00.000Z	Eitan		question is i need to have complete control of these computers, Pretty much lock them down, they are being used only for a call center, they pretty much need to be locked down, very little ability... any thing u guys recommend for this
2011-05-27T05:56:00.000Z	qin	Eitan	locked down? You mean no solitere, etc?
2011-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	Eitan		hehe, qin: correct
2011-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	Eitan		no solitair, no internet access bedies 4 speciifed sites. no saving files
2011-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	Eitan		crunchybits: have no decided
2011-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	qin	Eitan	But most of work is done with browser?
2011-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	Eitan		i havent built the systems yet
2011-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	Eitan	qin	yes just 4 customer services websites, need to block all other sites
2011-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	Eitan		and would like to have rmeote view access to the systems as well
2011-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	Eitan		cruncybits: yes thats right... i like ubuntu, more confortable with it than debian or centos...
2011-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	Eitan		thats why i am asking if you guys think its a good solution...
2011-05-27T05:59:00.000Z	Eitan		right, these are just desktops
2011-05-27T05:59:00.000Z	Eitan		not supposed to be a server
2011-05-27T05:59:00.000Z	Eitan		cause if i make this all off a server then i am going to need disaster recovery... so 2 servers and fail over and stuff like that
2011-05-27T05:59:00.000Z	Eitan		hehe
2011-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	qin	Eitan	internet is simple - iptables, desktop, well, either remove all software or chmod it down, also you can build usesr policies in shadow file, there are 2 projects (for linux internet caffee) in sourceforge too.
2011-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	Eitan		nice
2011-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	Eitan		ok, thats my plan, to make one system perfect
2011-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	Eitan		then just image it over, all systems will have identical hardware
2011-05-27T06:01:00.000Z	qin	Eitan	You can even make own "distro" in Ubunru/Debian as long it is GPL.Â£
