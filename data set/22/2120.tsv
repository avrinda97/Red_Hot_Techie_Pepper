2011-03-01T19:01:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	tar/rsync/cp + several backup-solutions using these tools
2011-03-01T18:59:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	why not using tar/rsync/cp?   dd if=/dev/sdX of=/media/place on other drive/with lots of/space bs=4k
2011-03-01T18:59:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	ok.
2011-03-01T19:00:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	there are better ways to do that than dd
2011-03-01T19:00:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	how?
2011-03-01T19:01:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	i have accidentlly erased whole hdd. and now there is nothing in it. only some files of new linx i was trying to insatall
2011-03-01T19:02:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	dd will create an image of the whole disk, including empty space.
2011-03-01T19:03:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	that takes long time and isn't usefull in most cases. to backup linux systems look for tar
2011-03-01T19:04:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	okay
2011-03-01T19:05:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	backing up a whole system also isn't usefull, backup /etc, your /homes and maybe parts of /var + a list of actually installed packages. so if you delete the whole drive again, just install a new linux, get installed packages back from the list, get your configs back and you're done
2011-03-01T19:18:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	bad idea to create a new partition on a drive you want to recover
2011-03-01T19:18:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	i ddnt create it. it got automatically created while i was trying that another linux
2011-03-01T19:19:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	who-/whatever created it. it was a bad idea to let "something" write to the drive to recover
2011-03-01T19:19:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	:'( i lost all imp data! :'(
2011-03-01T19:19:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	data without a backup wasn't important :)
2011-03-01T19:19:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	:'( true! now first thing i will do is setting up backing system!!!
2011-03-01T19:20:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	external drive/net-drive + rsnapshot
2011-03-01T19:20:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	yes i have external usb hdd.
2011-03-01T19:20:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	what is net drive and rsnapshot? i dont knwo about them? what are they?
2011-03-01T19:21:00.000Z	llutz_	abhijit	network-drive on a different computer i meant. rsnapshot is a imho good way for backing up data
2011-03-01T19:21:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	okk ok ok and is this rsnapshow a 'way' or name of software?
2011-03-01T19:22:00.000Z	abhijit	llutz_	thanks will try that.
