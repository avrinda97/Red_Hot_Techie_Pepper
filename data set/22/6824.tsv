2006-07-19T15:28:00.000Z	ShaunES		Question: I have ubuntu-6.06-alternate-powerpc. How do I set up ANY sort of server to get data off the hard drive without destroying it. I also have ubuntu-6.06-desktop-powerpc...
2006-07-19T15:28:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	that's not very clear? what OS is installed *now*?
2006-07-19T15:28:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	a broken ass OS X.
2006-07-19T15:29:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	and you want to read HFS+ from a LiveCD? good luck.
2006-07-19T15:29:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	I can read it with both these.
2006-07-19T15:29:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	have you run Disk Utility from the OSX install CD/DVD?
2006-07-19T15:30:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	it keeps saying it has lost connection with the daemon.
2006-07-19T15:31:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	what do you have to copy the files onto? a CD? a remote machine? USB stick?
2006-07-19T15:31:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	uhm, a remote machine is best.
2006-07-19T15:32:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	so install an OpenSSH server on that remote machine and scp the files over
2006-07-19T15:33:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	there's an ssh server on the machine?
2006-07-19T16:18:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	you want the desktop cd, not the alternate
2006-07-19T16:18:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	I've got that here too, and was told I needed alternate yesterday.
2006-07-19T16:22:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	so using desktop, how do I stop it from trying to access esd?
2006-07-19T16:24:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	why is a sound subsystem a problem?
2006-07-19T16:24:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	no idea, but that's apprently the problem.
2006-07-19T16:27:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	what kind of Mac?
2006-07-19T16:27:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	iMac G5 first gen (no iSight)
2006-07-19T16:28:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	weird, i know people using 6.06 with the iMac G5r1
2006-07-19T16:30:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	well... I dunno. I can boot into rescue mode, and it bitches when I select any of the options, but I can execute commands in that built in mini-shell thing
2006-07-19T16:32:00.000Z	mneptok	ShaunES	so then use that to scp files to a remote machine running an ssh server
2006-07-19T16:33:00.000Z	ShaunES	mneptok	I don't know how, it's the shell off the install thing. It doesn't even have ping.
