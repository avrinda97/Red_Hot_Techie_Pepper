2009-11-10T18:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	ok tell Lint , he seems to think he needs to defrag ..maybe you can tell him how to defrag or not
2010-09-20T18:34:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	frustration sometimes makes ppl say nasty stuff
2010-09-20T18:34:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	that doesn't make him any less of a twit.
2011-02-21T22:04:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	no it can't.
2011-02-21T22:05:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	unless the router is configured for dns, which is not a sure bet.
2011-02-21T22:16:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	I just reconfigured my router to autodns rebooted and resolv.conf has the router IP still listed as the same IP as before
2011-02-21T22:16:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	bully for you. go away.
2011-12-12T19:13:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	he does seem to be a slow learner...
2012-07-18T17:27:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	is the machine having a problem shutting down cleanly? if the disks are marked as "dirty" when unmounted, they'll be fscked again at boot.
2012-07-18T17:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	they appear to be shutting down cleanly , altho i haven't shut the pc off since trying the tune2fs commands. I have rebooted several times .
2012-07-18T17:30:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	what happens if you bring down one of the affected volumes and run fsck manually?
2012-07-18T17:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	I did fsck manually on all the affected disks , no errors reported
2012-07-18T17:32:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	anything interesting in dmesg when the volumes are mounted.
2012-07-18T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	that really shouldn't make a difference
2012-07-18T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	sometimes voodoo works, of course :-)
2012-07-18T17:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	not using a voodoo card , I'll stick with my old gt7600
2012-07-18T17:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	when i run the " tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 /dev/sda3" (this drive partition) i get this and it's the first time I've seen this , "tune2fs: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sda3 Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock.
2012-07-18T17:53:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	ick. can you mount it using the "sb=â€¦" flag?
2012-07-18T19:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	Pici , ok , fixed the constant fsck when booting up , the "pass" entry value in fstab was set to to 2 , instead of 1 or 0 . How that happened is beyond me.
2012-07-18T19:34:00.000Z	sipior	BluesKaj	odd. that should just affect the order in which the device is fscked. hmm..man page is not terribly clear on the point. glad you got it sorted, anyhow.
2012-07-18T19:36:00.000Z	BluesKaj	sipior	did some searchingaround , found this http://everyjoe.com/technology/explanation-the-fstab-file/
