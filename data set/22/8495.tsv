2005-12-03T12:23:00.000Z	ompaul	arpan	if it did not show in that previous box then it is not available, and you would not be here
2005-12-03T12:26:00.000Z	arpan	ompaul	if i ignore the options there and go to the next stage (by hitting forward),  and i choose hp then deskjet 656C, it pops up a driver
2005-12-03T12:27:00.000Z	ompaul	arpan	so choose that
