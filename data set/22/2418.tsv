2009-06-18T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 which config?  there  ~/.irssi/config for most user settings
2009-06-18T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 default irssi.conf is in /etc/irssi.conf - or so 'locate irssi' says :)
2009-06-18T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 if you are such a irc beginner that you have never used '/join #channelname' befor - you may want to track down some irc beginner guides.
2009-06-18T19:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 the irssi homepage has some very well done 'beginner' guides.  theres also command line options to set your nick to irssi.  'irssi --nick=Billgates'
2011-01-08T13:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 dvdrip.  handbreak, k9copy, proberly others...
2011-01-08T13:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 handbreak is popular.. it depends on your needs.
2011-01-16T02:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 make a launcher that runs (for example ->   xterm -e 'irssi'
2011-01-16T02:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 gnome-terminal has a similer option
2011-01-16T02:03:00.000Z	glaceman	Dr_Willis	worked (Y)
2011-01-16T02:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glaceman	 proberly not the best way to quit irssi either.. use the /quit or /exit command
2011-01-16T02:05:00.000Z	glaceman	Dr_Willis	i launched a terminal -e irssi , now dosen' wanna close
2011-01-16T02:05:00.000Z	glaceman	Dr_Willis	ah ok :d
