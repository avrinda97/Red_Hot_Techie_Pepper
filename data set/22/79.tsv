2012-08-22T22:45:00.000Z	Leo___		erg, maybe I shouldn't be using Ubuntu if I can't even figure out how to configure my wireless adapter.  I'll try again later.
2012-08-22T22:47:00.000Z	Leo___		Maximilian  would you mind helping me when you are done?
2012-08-22T22:49:00.000Z	Leo___		Chibipanda the netgear wg311v3,  I get "FATAL: module ndiswrapper not found" after "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper"
2012-08-22T22:49:00.000Z	Leo___		ndiswrapper -l displays that my drivers are installed
2012-08-22T22:50:00.000Z	Leo___		Yes I installed ndiswrapper, and apt-get isn't going to work because I'm not online
2012-08-22T22:50:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	is this 12.04? ndiswrapper isn't included with the kernel in 12.04 so you need to install ndiswrapper-dkms
2012-08-22T22:51:00.000Z	Leo___	trism	yes! How do I install ndiswrapper-dkms?
2012-08-22T22:51:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-dkms; although if you only have wireless, you'll need to download the package from packages.ubuntu.com and install it manually
2012-08-22T22:53:00.000Z	Leo___	trism	when I tried installing ndiswrapper-dkms it says package dkms not installed
2012-08-22T22:53:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	yes you'll need dkms too (you also need the two linux-headers packages, I wasn't sure if either of those were installed by default)
2012-08-22T22:54:00.000Z	Leo___	trism	where do I download those? Are they deb files?
2012-08-22T22:55:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	can you pastebin: dpkg -l 'linux-headers*'; and you can download all the packages from packages.ubuntu.com
2012-08-22T22:56:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/dkms for instance
2012-08-22T22:58:00.000Z	Leo___	trism	I cannot pastebin as I'm not online but I should install all those?  Also how do I install dkms it isnt a deb file
2012-08-22T22:59:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	at the bottom of that page, the all link, goes to: http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/all/dkms/download where you can download it
2012-08-22T23:00:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	don't really need the pastebin I was just curious if the headers were already installed, what is: uname -a; I'll grab the correct links to the headers
2012-08-22T23:02:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	-pae?
2012-08-22T23:02:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	got it
2012-08-22T23:03:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/linux-headers-3.2.0-23-generic-pae and http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/linux-headers-3.2.0-23
2012-08-22T23:03:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	I believe those 4 packages should be enough for dkms to build the module
2012-08-22T23:08:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	no problem, good luck with the install
2012-08-22T23:57:00.000Z	trism	Leo___	excellent!
