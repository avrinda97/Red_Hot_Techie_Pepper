2005-05-15T15:38:00.000Z	angie		having an issue with cdrecord and cpu usage... any help please?
2005-05-15T15:40:00.000Z	bob2	angie	best to just ask your question...
2005-05-15T15:41:00.000Z	angie	bob2	tnx... while using cdrecord the cpu usage (i see it in the applet system monitor) increases until it reaches 100%
2005-05-15T15:41:00.000Z	bob2	angie	what cpu do you have?
2005-05-15T15:42:00.000Z	angie	bob2	a celeron 500... but I used previously cdrecord without problems in debian... got this problem when i switched to ubuntu
2005-05-15T15:43:00.000Z	bob2	angie	I guess DMA is being disabled on your cd burner.
2005-05-15T15:43:00.000Z	angie	bob2	do u know how to enable it please?
2005-05-15T15:43:00.000Z	bob2	angie	try "hdparm -c3 /dev/cdrom", then burning something
2005-05-15T15:44:00.000Z	angie	bob2	tnx, I'll try immediately
2005-05-15T15:56:00.000Z	angie	bob2	it was a cdrom DMA problem... now it works perfectly... tnx so much i was really upset :-)
2005-05-15T15:56:00.000Z	bob2	angie	no problem
2005-05-15T15:57:00.000Z	angie	bob2	do u help in the #debian channel too?
2005-05-15T15:58:00.000Z	bob2	angie	yes
2005-05-15T15:59:00.000Z	angie	bob2	tonight I was searching for help in the debian channel and when i said i was using ubuntu they treated me like an idiot... it was a very unpleasant experience...  i was sure thi sproblem was a generic one and not just an ubuntu issue
2005-05-15T16:00:00.000Z	bob2	angie	yes, asking for help with non-Debian distributions in #debian is strongly discouraged
2005-05-15T16:00:00.000Z	bob2	angie	if you want help with a particular distribution, ask for help in that distribution's channel
2005-05-15T16:02:00.000Z	angie	bob2	you gave me the answer without asking me anything... I think you knew the solution to my problem.. they did not... and they found easier to offend me
2005-05-15T16:03:00.000Z	bob2	angie	well, it gets very very tiresome when people keep asking questions about things other than Debian
2005-05-15T16:05:00.000Z	angie	bob2	i think they did not know the asnwer... it would have been more correct to tell me: sorry we do not know
2005-05-15T16:05:00.000Z	bob2	angie	but you would have been more correct to ask in here instead of there
2005-05-15T16:07:00.000Z	angie	bob2	:-) i tried but i could not get an answer here at that time... anyway now it's ok and thank you so much again
2005-05-15T16:07:00.000Z	bob2	angie	np
