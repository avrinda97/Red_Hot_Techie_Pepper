2011-07-23T09:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LoRd_UnDeRwOrLd	do you get no fonts in firefox?
2011-07-23T09:02:00.000Z	LoRd_UnDeRwOrLd	ActionParsnip	hi, exactly. I mean there's "file, edit, view" etc but for example if i go to google, there's no search botton or "web, images" etc
2011-07-23T09:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LoRd_UnDeRwOrLd	I've heard of this on launchpad but i have no idea exactly what the fix was. I was something to do with font rendering settings either in ubuntu or in firefox. I don't use firefox so can't comment there but there is in ubuntu. You could have a play and/or try find the post as a different user or pc
2011-07-23T09:07:00.000Z	LoRd_UnDeRwOrLd	ActionParsnip	yeah, i would do that but the thing is I can't read it :D
