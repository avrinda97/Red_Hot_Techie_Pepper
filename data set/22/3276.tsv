2011-03-04T09:46:00.000Z	zeleftikam		U 10.10: how do i add a repository by command line?
2011-03-04T09:47:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	for a starter you would have to add a line to /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-03-04T09:47:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	then probably add the gpg keys and do an apt-get update
2011-03-04T09:47:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	i'm following a tutorial that says i need to run: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-on-rails
2011-03-04T09:47:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	ok that is another way I heard of, sorry not too familiar with tough
2011-03-04T09:48:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found
2011-03-04T09:50:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	weird I have the command available.. wich version are you using ?
2011-03-04T09:51:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	Description:    Ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-04T09:53:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	ok .. try : sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
2011-03-04T09:54:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	okay, installed.
2011-03-04T09:54:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	ok if you just type add-apt then do tab it does not auto-complete ?
2011-03-04T09:55:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	ok means command is available....try just typing sudo add-apt-repository without param to see what it says
2011-03-04T09:55:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	actually, i ran the whole command, and it worked fine
2011-03-04T09:56:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	ok I thought it was not running properly
2011-03-04T09:56:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	it appears to have added gpgkey, good right?
2011-03-04T09:56:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	yeah good
2011-03-04T09:56:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	yeah, the command didn't run at all until i installed the python thing. weird. thanks very much for your help!! ++
2011-03-04T09:56:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	then a simple apt-get update should get the package list from that source
2011-03-04T09:57:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	no prob, just to let you know, that particular command is provided by that pythin package
2011-03-04T09:57:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	I juste searched the command name on packages.ubuntu.com to see wich package provided it
2011-03-04T09:57:00.000Z	zeleftikam	chaosr	ahh. gotcha. nice. no idea why this install doesn't have it
2011-03-04T09:58:00.000Z	chaosr	zeleftikam	don't know as I said I am not too familiar with that command but I think it is relatively recent
