2005-09-13T07:40:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	glxinfo|grep -i ^direct
2005-09-13T07:41:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	k i got the following 'direct rendering: No'
2005-09-13T07:46:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	any idea how i enable open gl?
2005-09-13T07:47:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	make sure the proper drm kernel module is loaded and that xorg.conf is configured correctly
2005-11-03T13:05:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	sup man
2005-11-03T13:05:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	know of a good bittorrent proggy
2005-11-03T13:08:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	azureus, ktorrent, etc.
2005-11-03T13:09:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	 can't seem to get azureus to install right its weird
2005-12-23T14:19:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	very true i had to use the old video driver vesa to get on since the nvidia drivers don't work
2006-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	probably a very poor place to gain insight; groklaw is better for that
2006-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	k thanx
2006-01-04T07:09:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	sudo apt-get --reinstall install build-essential
2006-05-23T09:37:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	remove the files by hand. You probably should have used flashplugin-nonfree from multiverse.
2006-05-23T09:38:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	yea i can't remember what i need to do to remove it by hand
2007-04-11T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	you don't change them /in/ a kernel module; generally you pass a "param=value" pair to insmod/modprobe
2007-04-11T11:05:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	i am trying to adjust the brightness for the vicam.ko module and not sure how
2007-04-11T11:06:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	that module doesn't accept any parameters
2007-04-11T11:07:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	hmmmm the cam works but is very very dark
2007-04-11T11:09:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	any ideas?
2007-04-11T11:20:00.000Z	odat	crimsun	you still there?
2007-04-11T11:26:00.000Z	crimsun	odat	what's up?
