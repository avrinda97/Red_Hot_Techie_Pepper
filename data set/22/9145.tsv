2005-02-21T15:29:00.000Z	An00b15		broke
2005-02-21T15:29:00.000Z	An00b15		it'll be "fixed" whe its ready
2005-02-21T15:29:00.000Z	An00b15		I knew that when I installed
2005-02-21T15:30:00.000Z	An00b15		Firefox has crashed on my all day
2005-02-21T15:30:00.000Z	An00b15		I updated to Hoary before and that did not happen
2005-02-21T15:30:00.000Z	An00b15		what do i look like filing a bug from a system they know is unstable?
2005-02-21T15:31:00.000Z	An00b15		and you don't just file "bugs"
2005-02-21T15:31:00.000Z	An00b15		you at least make sure thatas what it is
2005-02-21T15:31:00.000Z	An00b15		and not just your system
2005-02-21T15:31:00.000Z	scizzo_	An00b15	start firefox from a terminal?
2005-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	An00b15	scizzo_	and?
2005-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	An00b15		firefox
2005-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	An00b15		and the other mozilla based browesrs crashed
2005-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	An00b15		but dillo does not
2005-02-21T15:33:00.000Z	An00b15		even the sefl installer from mozilla for firefox crashed
2005-02-21T15:33:00.000Z	An00b15		its hit and miss
2005-02-21T15:33:00.000Z	An00b15		video seems to kill it
2005-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	An00b15		I think the mplayer plug is screwy
2005-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	An00b15		the mplayer plugin loads the video but then never finishes
2005-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	An00b15		I thought it was video related
2005-02-21T15:34:00.000Z	scizzo_	An00b15	try to see if you get any errors in the terminal
