2008-02-13T07:29:00.000Z	gold44		how to disable gui splash screen? want to see the boot process in text mode , cause my video card/monitor says out of range.
2008-02-13T07:29:00.000Z	gold44		i have no way of telling what the status is, cause screen out of range
2008-02-13T07:30:00.000Z	gold44		help
2008-02-13T07:30:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	does it say refresh rate out of range?
2008-02-13T07:30:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	let me check, bu t i think the resoultion is wrong, my screen support 1024x and default probably bigger
2008-02-13T07:31:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	well what happened, was this the first time. did you edit something.
2008-02-13T07:32:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	just installed it on dual boot. monitor says "out of range", it's not a message from the console. it's a message from  my LCD screen itself.
2008-02-13T07:33:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	oh no. unable to boot into ubuntu. i have in intitial ram disk prompt
2008-02-13T07:34:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	i know. it usually means wrong resolution or bad refresh rates. if you can do ctrl+alt+f2 and get a terminal you can try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg" and it should rebuild it to the correct settings. otherwise you may be able to get a terminal with recovery mode boot
2008-02-13T07:35:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	it happens when booting linux right
2008-02-13T07:37:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	yes during boot time, no splash screen. but bigger right problem now.  some sort of tty device error
2008-02-13T07:38:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	can you boot to recovery mode.
2008-02-13T07:38:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	i have all in one budget motherboard combo. so lots of hardware are very rare
2008-02-13T07:38:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	let me try.
2008-02-13T07:43:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	hm.. recovery mode is stuck or maybe taking a long time. anyway. i will try slackware and see if i get more luck. i think the main thing is the drivers for my budget motherboard
2008-02-13T07:43:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	well if you get recovery to work do the command i gave you earier
2008-02-13T07:44:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	okie dok
2008-02-13T07:52:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	nope. failed. tty error can't access control. i still get initial ram disk prompt. i'll give slackware a try later this week =(
2008-02-13T07:53:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	hmm thats too bad. did ubuntu ever start up. maybe had something to with dualboot
2008-02-13T07:54:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	no, don't think it's dualboot prob. i am running ubuntu on laptop. the one with problem is my bundled-budget-motherboard-desktop.
2008-02-13T07:55:00.000Z	soldats	gold44	hmm. i donr know what to say. its beyond me :(
2008-02-13T07:58:00.000Z	gold44	soldats	it's beyond me too. but i'll keep trying until i find a distro that will work with my desktop. i am only using it as web/file server. so no biggy
