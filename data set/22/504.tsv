2011-10-09T04:26:00.000Z	FireRailz		Becides ircii or epic what is the best console based IRC program?
2011-10-09T04:27:00.000Z	FireRailz		Let me rephrase that I'm not experienced and am trying to find one that is easy to use
2011-10-09T04:27:00.000Z	FireRailz		I dont want to take a poll i just want to know one that would be easy to use
2011-10-09T04:27:00.000Z	SIFTU	FireRailz	weechat
2011-10-09T04:29:00.000Z	FireRailz		someone said above a plugin for pidgin?
2011-10-09T04:34:00.000Z	FireRailz		What search terms would I use to find a faq on why files are placed in certain directories like what /etc is for or usr/bin or why thats used sometimes and usr/local to understand the directory structure
2011-10-09T04:36:00.000Z	FireRailz		thank you for the link because i noticed every distro was different ubuntu/debian i couldnt find
2011-10-09T04:37:00.000Z	FireRailz		and i dont understand why sometimes programs installed from source put the executible in /usr/local/bin instead of where other exec programs are put
2011-10-09T04:39:00.000Z	FireRailz	yagoo	yes i understand i am new to debian and i love it im mainly getting back into linux since i used to work with ATT Unix then BSD
2011-10-09T04:39:00.000Z	FireRailz		then came back into the picture with redhat based but i like debian so much better
2011-10-09T04:41:00.000Z	FireRailz		I saw that program and installed it I will use that for compiled programs that are complex
2011-10-09T04:41:00.000Z	FireRailz		but for bsflite i didnt use checkinstall because its only two files and easy to remove
2011-10-09T04:41:00.000Z	FireRailz		and thank you for the link for the tree
2011-10-09T04:42:00.000Z	FireRailz		thank you for the filesystem tree overview and just starting to get into the .deb making tools. I'm learning how to go from unix to this while a lot is familiar and works the same im just learning the differences
2011-10-09T04:43:00.000Z	FireRailz		but the package manager is a god send
2011-10-09T04:45:00.000Z	FireRailz	yagoo	I wont compile anything with make install without having it made into a .deb file i was just talking about compiling one program that all it did was install two files and was completely safe nothing more complex i wont trust either
2011-10-09T04:47:00.000Z	FireRailz		also i have to use command line txt based only apps since im using a screen reader I'm not transitioned to orca in the GUI
2011-10-09T04:47:00.000Z	FireRailz		unlike windows where i can use window eyes or jaws its touch learning a new screen reader im visually impared so cli programs are easiest for me
2011-10-09T04:48:00.000Z	FireRailz		so I need to find programs that are easy to install so i dont have to compile
2011-10-09T04:50:00.000Z	FireRailz		orca isn't too difficult no but i'm still learning, as you know it doesnt read everything properly but thats expected in any screen reader even in windows or mac i use my lite talk hooked up to a serial port in the CLI so i dont have to use the GUI
2011-10-09T04:50:00.000Z	FireRailz		I'm just trying to find a good program for all the types of chat services that will work well in the cli
2011-10-09T04:53:00.000Z	SIFTU	FireRailz	yeah most visually impared people use irssi as its the best for screenreaders..
