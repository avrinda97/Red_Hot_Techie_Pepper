2006-07-08T10:07:00.000Z	padi		no one in here using PRINTING and UBUNTU?
2006-07-08T10:08:00.000Z	padi		cups tells me: authentification failed
2006-07-08T10:08:00.000Z	padi		this must be a bad joke!!!!!
2006-07-08T10:09:00.000Z	padi		what kind of distribution is this?
2006-07-08T10:09:00.000Z	padi		this was a rhetorical question
2006-07-08T10:10:00.000Z	kaot	padi	you got cupsys started?  point a browser at localhost:631, play around a bit.  been a while since I messed with printing but I remember that being relatively painless
2006-07-08T10:12:00.000Z	padi	kaot	then it has changed, you can't finish adding a printer because no login works! neither the one of the user nor root
2006-07-08T10:13:00.000Z	kaot	padi	hm.  local or network printer?
2006-07-08T10:14:00.000Z	padi	kaot	network printer, but the login is on LOCALHOST
2006-07-08T10:16:00.000Z	kaot	padi	this sounds like one of those problems that once you fix it you're gonna thump yerself in the head for missing it the first time around :\
2006-07-08T10:16:00.000Z	padi	kaot	whyami:
2006-07-08T10:17:00.000Z	padi	kaot	this is bs, sorry, but I did these steps on adding a printer MANY times in other distros using cups it ALWAYS worked
2006-07-08T10:20:00.000Z	padi	kaot	what
2006-07-08T10:21:00.000Z	padi	kaot	yes here too
2006-07-08T10:21:00.000Z	kaot	padi	whelp, I guess you gotta do it that way, ya?
2006-07-08T10:21:00.000Z	kaot	padi	or else re-enable it, however that works
2006-07-08T10:22:00.000Z	kaot	padi	thumping yer head yet?  ;)
2006-07-08T10:22:00.000Z	padi	kaot	I have no System/Administration *g
2006-07-08T10:23:00.000Z	kaot	padi	I'm in fluxbox or i'd check it myself
2006-07-08T10:23:00.000Z	padi	kaot	no this is not my fault, I don't read everything everytime
2006-07-08T10:23:00.000Z	kaot	padi	check taht readme apparently you can re-enable via web interface
2006-07-08T10:37:00.000Z	padi	kaot	ping
