2011-11-21T10:50:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	your webserver is at the very least talking back to me
2011-11-21T10:50:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	are you getting the php page?
2011-11-21T10:50:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	it's not responding via web browser, but the port is open and responding to http requests.
2011-11-21T10:51:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	via webbrowser its just timing out for you as well?
2011-11-21T10:52:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	yep. but it's not a router issue; I'd suspect a misconfiguration of httpd, or an error in your PHP
2011-11-21T10:52:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	and if its working from localhost, its probably httpd?
2011-11-21T10:53:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	Seems likely, yes. Using apache?
2011-11-21T10:53:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	yes
2011-11-21T10:54:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	Okay, now the port is unresponsive. Take a look at the end of your apache logs in /var/log/apache, specifically access.log and error.log, and see if there's anything useful there
2011-11-21T10:55:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	gedit /var/log/apache opened up an empty file
2011-11-21T10:56:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	yes, that's a directory :) the logs are /var/log/apache/error.log and /var/log/apache/access.log I believe
2011-11-21T10:56:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	somsip: oops
2011-11-21T10:59:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	That's odd; I got a 200 OK response after requesting /index.htm, so it should have logged that...
2011-11-21T11:02:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	netstat --tcp -lp | pastebinit
2011-11-21T11:03:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	and that
2011-11-21T11:05:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	http://paste.ubuntu.com/744942/
2011-11-21T11:07:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	sudo service apache2 restart
2011-11-21T11:09:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	working for me now
2011-11-21T11:10:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	thank you
2011-11-21T11:11:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	I'm still confused why I had originally gotten a response, though -- that means the port forward was working momentarily
2011-11-21T11:12:00.000Z	hilarie	brjannc	wondering if its my router is open to remote config? thats gotta have a baby webserver in it just for that
2011-11-21T11:12:00.000Z	brjannc	hilarie	usually those things aren't listening on port 80, it's usually like 8080 or something. But it's possible
