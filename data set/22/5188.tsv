2007-11-15T21:26:00.000Z	bruenig		oh but ubuntu is always behind so you guys didn't know until 1 month ago
2007-11-15T21:26:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	I new when I was running feisty
2007-11-15T21:27:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	lucky you
2007-11-15T21:28:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	just don't sum all of us up in one group as behind the times unbuntu'ers
2007-11-15T21:28:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	ubuntu as a distro is behind always
2007-11-15T21:28:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	it is built into the design
2007-11-15T21:28:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	there are plenty of package distro lists, that you can use to stay current
2007-11-15T21:29:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	you mean you get around ubuntu's failings by negating the whole idea of package management? you do things like getdeb.org because you like the windows software installation model
2007-11-15T21:31:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	but I aggree w/ you that it could do to stay to behind, and for a while I had to keep up w/ the current releases of things like thunderbirds because I had a dual boot w/ common user data.
2007-11-15T21:32:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	it is a bit scary though because ubuntu has such a large uninformed base that these go to some random website and install a deb from it installation techniques might take over. People coming over from windows won't bother learning the beauty of centralized package management and ubuntu staying constantly behind gives them incentive to not learn it.
2007-11-15T21:33:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	the avredge user should not have to learn it
2007-11-15T21:33:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	should not have to learn to use the package management?
2007-11-15T21:34:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	you are in favor of the windows go to some random website and run some random exe it spits out at you method as opposed to apt-get or one of apt-get's front ends?
2007-11-15T21:34:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	no I am not in favor of the random .exe system
2007-11-15T21:34:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	just the random .deb system?
2007-11-15T21:38:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	I am not a fan of any reandon installs, especaly becase the *nix scene done not have as strong of an anti virus support system.  you have argued both for and against the packagme management system btw.  caling unbuntu's system their falings
2007-11-15T21:39:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	no, I have argued against ubuntu's failure at package management. If they had a good package management setup like other distros, there would be no incentive to go the random deb route. Package management done how it should be done has no drawbacks.
2007-11-15T21:41:00.000Z	sanguisdex	bruenig	I don't know what system you think whould be better, but I would wonder why you are in #ubuntu if you feel that stronly
2007-11-15T21:41:00.000Z	bruenig	sanguisdex	help people
