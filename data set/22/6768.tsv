2006-08-01T13:36:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	how can you loose what never was?  log in as someone with admin privlages.
2006-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	Nik0	nrdb	I used root. I need to know how to change the root password
2006-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	there isn't one with ubuntu/kubuntu etc.
2006-08-01T13:38:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	you use sudo with your password.
2006-08-01T13:38:00.000Z	Nik0	nrdb	yes there is. I set one.
2006-08-01T13:38:00.000Z	Nik0	nrdb	I still dont have another account with admin privledges...
2006-08-01T13:39:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	try "sudo su -" and give it your password
2006-08-01T13:39:00.000Z	Nik0	nrdb	I need to login....
2006-08-01T13:40:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	you can't log in at all?
2006-08-01T13:40:00.000Z	Nik0	nrdb	exactly. I need the password.
2006-08-01T13:41:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	try reboot and use the "recovery mode" that should put you into a single user root account.
2006-08-01T13:42:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	create a new user and add to the admin group
2006-08-01T13:42:00.000Z	Nik0	nrdb	cheers. Gonna try it out.
2006-08-01T13:43:00.000Z	Nik0	nrdb	booting in recovery didnt work.
2006-08-01T13:47:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	it didn't ask me for one.
2006-08-01T13:50:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	do you have the ubuntu LiveCD there?
2006-08-01T13:56:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	do you have the ubuntu LiveCD there?
2006-08-01T13:59:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	if you have a LiveCD there it might be possible to remove the root password and get your system going again.
2006-08-01T14:00:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	I didn't see the other responses sorry.
2006-08-01T14:25:00.000Z	nrdb	Nik0	did you sort out your problem?
