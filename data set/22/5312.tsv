2009-01-25T15:55:00.000Z	jonaskoelker		question for y'all: my firefox has a nasty habit of starting in offline mode.  How do I make it not do that?
2009-01-25T15:55:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	manually configured network?
2009-01-25T15:56:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	no
2009-01-25T15:56:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	about:config, and set toolkit.networkmanager.disable to true
2009-01-25T15:56:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	by 'manually configured', I mean anything other than network manager
2009-01-25T15:56:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	oh, then yes
2009-01-25T15:59:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	I set it to true, restarted firefox, and it started up in offline mode
2009-01-25T15:59:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	it was online when you closed it, right?
2009-01-25T15:59:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	I'm 99% sure
2009-01-25T16:00:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	now I'm 100% sure
2009-01-25T16:00:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	I was in online mode, shut firefox down, and it started in offline mode
2009-01-25T16:01:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	toolkit.networkmanager.disable is true, right?  (:p)
2009-01-25T16:02:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	yes
2009-01-25T16:02:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	that's special :/
2009-01-25T16:06:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	I have no idea then, although I suspect it's still something related
2009-01-25T16:10:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	edit | preferences | advanced | network | settings, it's not set to auto-detect is it?
2009-01-25T16:11:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	that takes me to the foxyproxy dialog box
2009-01-25T16:12:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	apparently there's some logic in there that might be doing an actual network test.  Try starting in -safe-mode, or otherwise disabling foxyproxy temporarily to check if that's causing an interaction
2009-01-25T16:13:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	now "work offline" is unchecked [after I disabled foxyproxy]
2009-01-25T16:13:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	i.e., it worked? :/
2009-01-25T16:13:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	cwillu	yeah
2009-01-25T16:14:00.000Z	cwillu	jonaskoelker	well, that's cute
