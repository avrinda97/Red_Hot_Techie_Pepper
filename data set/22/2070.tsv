2009-10-06T21:28:00.000Z	mee_		If I compile and install some libraries from source code in my Ubuntu would be any problems later If I upgrade my Ubuntu to it's next release?
2009-10-06T21:28:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	possibly
2009-10-06T21:29:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	they (binaries or libraries, so files and ...) will be overwritten during upgrade (installing other versions of deb files), is it true?
2009-10-06T21:34:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	as i said, it could be a problem and there could not be.
2009-10-06T21:34:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	as i asked, is there a secure way to deal with this (for example some app that checks for this type of installed libs during upgrade)?
2009-10-06T21:34:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	no there isn't
2009-10-06T21:35:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	and what do you do in these conditions? just remember to "make remove" the source version before upgrading?
2009-10-06T21:36:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	as long as the app isn't used by the base system you don't have to worry more than the app itself stops working
2009-10-06T21:36:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	libraries?!
2009-10-06T21:37:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	libraries can be used in many other apps
2009-10-06T21:40:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	you can always, not upgrade. and dont worry about it
2009-10-06T21:41:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	do you suggest not upgrading at all?
2009-10-06T21:42:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	depends if you want the upgrades or not. and if you want them more than risking breaking a library.
2009-10-06T21:43:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	i do not suggest not upgrading at all, i'm just putting things in perspective
2009-10-06T21:43:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	is this a bug/problem/weakness of linux? heard if some people are working on it?
2009-10-06T21:44:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	this is not a weakness of linux, it's a weakness of the progress of upgrading. it's in _ALL_ operating systems.
2009-10-06T21:45:00.000Z	mee_	rsk	agree that its not linux's fault, maybe packaging systems (deb/rpms)
2009-10-06T21:46:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	no, it's not any package systems fault, it's the fault that you are using something outside of apt-get annd then run a upgrade that changes how things work.
2009-10-06T21:46:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	and the library hasn't changed to fit with the upgrade.
2009-10-06T21:47:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	you can only blaim this on not doing things the right way.
2009-10-06T21:48:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	but if you have the source, usually a recompile fixes any potential problems.
2009-10-06T21:49:00.000Z	rsk	mee_	what is the library you want btw?
