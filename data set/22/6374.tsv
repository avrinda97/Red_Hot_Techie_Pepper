2006-11-04T15:01:00.000Z	avagant		At any rate Cali sucks, I can't wait to get back home but hopefully before the weather gets horrible.
2006-11-04T15:01:00.000Z	avagant		I don't know maybe it's a buffalo thing.
2006-11-04T15:01:00.000Z	avagant		like walmarts, kmarts, etc.
2006-11-04T15:02:00.000Z	avagant		and everything is "down this house, down that house" in Pitt. Haha
2006-11-04T15:02:00.000Z	avagant		Go back to an older update and hope for the best?
2006-11-04T15:02:00.000Z	avagant		Sorry that's not good advice.
2006-11-04T15:02:00.000Z	avagant		I'm surprized how stable my Edgy install is.
2006-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	avagant		It's kind of spooky in a way.
2006-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	avagant		Maybe it was out here, sethk.
2006-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	BAzfH	avagant	i maybe would be surprised if wlan would run :-((
2006-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	avagant	BAzfH	Me and ubuntu have a very long history of beating each other up, so this working flawlessly the first time is kind of disturbing.
2006-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	BAzfH	avagant	hehe.. i have a history like that, too
2006-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	avagant	BAzfH	Albiet the update manager with 7 minutes left disappeared and I had to do a dist-upgrade the rest of the way through but other then that, flawless.
2006-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	BAzfH	avagant	hehe.. at work dapper -> edgy worked almost flawless. except there was a bootup problem
2006-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	avagant	BAzfH	I had to netboot to Dapper, and then upgrade to Edgy.
2006-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	avagant	BAzfH	I'm still crossing my fingers.
2006-11-04T15:09:00.000Z	avagant	BAzfH	Eh it's just flashier, it actually to me doesn't boot up any faster then Dapper did.
2006-11-04T15:10:00.000Z	avagant	BAzfH	Haha. Edgy is trying to be your mom.
2006-11-04T15:23:00.000Z	avagant	BAzfH	If you have any problems go to www.ubuntuforums.org and look for help.
2006-11-04T15:24:00.000Z	BAzfH	avagant	i always do :-)
2006-11-04T15:24:00.000Z	BAzfH	avagant	I only come to irc if everything else fails (like rtfm, rtfm more, rtfm more once again, reading forums, ..)
