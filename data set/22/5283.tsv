2007-06-03T11:20:00.000Z	aleka		trying out vmware server with different ISO images I have on my ubuntu... and when I "power it on", it chugs for about 5 seconds and goes back to the console screen
2007-06-03T11:21:00.000Z	aleka		started vmware from the terminal.. but no debugging info there
2007-06-03T11:21:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	you have the cdrom set to run from the iso?
2007-06-03T11:22:00.000Z	aleka	bastid_raZor	 yeah
2007-06-03T11:22:00.000Z	aleka		tried xubuntu, knopix and debian isos... all failed
2007-06-03T11:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	before this last week vmware wouldn't work at all for me. but it was my hardware. new MB works fine now
2007-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	i know that isn't an answer but it is how i solved many of my issues with ubuntu
2007-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	aleka	bastid_raZor	 and MB here stand for...
2007-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	motherboard
2007-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	aleka		heh...
2007-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	my computer was OLD, i finally broke down and bought new MB, processor and RAM
2007-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	aleka		oh well... just wanted to give it a try... thought it would be a nice thing.. since I can not dual boot anymore... thnx to my PS/2 port being damaged on my tower...
2007-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	aleka		can't even get into the BIOS to configure it for legacy USb support....
2007-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		ouch
2007-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		buy a new case.. only 35$ or so
2007-06-03T11:26:00.000Z	aleka		yeah... I guess.. if I really wanted to boot into windows... I would have to change my defaults in Grub... but it hasn't gotten to that stage yet... tried a "grub -reboot" command once.. to give it a "one-time" argument... which ended up messing up my whole install....
2007-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	use the live cd to redo your grub/master boot record
2007-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	aleka	bastid_raZor	 went to a local pc hw shop.. and the guy there was telling me I needed a new MB since the PS/2 port was on the mother board
2007-06-03T11:28:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	ahh.. that'll do it.. go to portatech.com super cheap and great quality
2007-06-03T11:28:00.000Z	aleka	bastid_raZor	 yeah i know... it just  hasn't gotten to a pt where I really need windows yet... been with ubuntu for a while now and am fine..
2007-06-03T11:28:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	i spent 250$ now i have Pentium D 2x 3.0GHrz 1G DDR2
2007-06-03T11:29:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	aleka	if you don't understand that.. that is a decent set up for a cheap price
