2005-09-24T13:54:00.000Z	alec_		Package wine is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2005-09-24T13:54:00.000Z	alec_		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2005-09-24T13:54:00.000Z	alec_		is only available from another source
2005-09-24T13:54:00.000Z	alec_		E: Package wine has no installation candidate
2005-09-24T13:54:00.000Z	Kejk_PL	alec_	 U haven't add additional repositories
2005-09-24T13:55:00.000Z	Kejk_PL	alec_	U have to add "universe" reposity, and probably "restricted" and multiverse" too
