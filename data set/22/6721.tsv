2007-08-12T14:05:00.000Z	DFM		Anyone know whay the Nvidia driver doesn't work on fiesty 64 bit? It crashed X. Is it because the driver is 32 bit?
2007-08-12T14:06:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	yes
2007-08-12T14:06:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	Is there a 64 bit driver available?
2007-08-12T14:08:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	yes, there is. And probably you have it installed. The problem that is VERY unstable
2007-08-12T14:09:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	neither in Windows you might have reliable 64 bit driver.
2007-08-12T14:10:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	no. It is because it is not opensource.
2007-08-12T14:11:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	if you are new to linux, I recommend you using a 32 bit instalation instead.
2007-08-12T14:13:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	the difference is not noticeable from a common desktop usage.
2007-08-12T14:14:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	I agree with Enselic
2007-08-12T14:14:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	if you press TAB after typing Kurt my full nickname will be written
2007-08-12T14:17:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	I have been using IRC very little and have yet to learn everything I need to for etiquette. My apologies.
2007-08-12T14:19:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	you dont need to apologise :D In fact, that is not a matter of etiquette. It is a pratical issue. When you mention the full nickname of someone, usually, our message will me in a different color or will produce a sound, gathering the attention from the person you're talking to.
2007-08-12T14:23:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	I just got tired of trying to correctly spell the name's and shortened them but now I know how to do it. :)
2007-08-12T14:24:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	:P
2007-08-12T14:25:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	Did you see my question about trying to use qtparted to resize the primary ext3 partition?
2007-08-12T14:25:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	no... let me check
2007-08-12T14:26:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	what is the problem ?
2007-08-12T14:27:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	I want to reduce the size to create a fat32 partition for backup purposes for both OS's
2007-08-12T14:28:00.000Z	KurtKraut	DFM	you should be able to resize any ext3 partition only if it is unmounted
2007-08-12T14:28:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	Just to do it. Not critical. Tried partition magic 8.0 and it sees the drive but won't touch it.
2007-08-12T14:28:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	didn't think of that. It shows it's status as busy.
2007-08-12T14:29:00.000Z	DFM	KurtKraut	I am running knoppix so I will try it.
