2008-05-14T16:30:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	not at all
2008-05-14T16:33:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	"not at all", as in "I have and idea of how to do that" ?
2008-05-14T16:33:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	you have an issue? please explain
2008-05-14T16:35:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	lets say someone have replaced say the update manager with something that starts to install modified evil packages, how can I know?
2008-05-14T16:36:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	they are vetted before they get in there; not an issue at all-->best to do a bit of reading on this process-->OT for this channel
2008-05-14T16:37:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	since all packages here (except supertux) should be something that is either from the installcd or got from canonicals servers, it should be possible to verify that everything is correct, right?
2008-05-14T16:38:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	yes this is not windows-->please relax :)
2008-05-14T16:42:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	this is getting offtopic; best ask in #ubuntu-offtopic or read up on the net-->really nada to worry about thanks
2008-06-28T16:05:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	this is gutsy?
2008-06-28T16:05:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	 uhh... 7.10
2008-06-28T16:06:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	(haven't got time to update to 8.04 yet)
2008-06-28T16:06:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	you installed via restricted drivers manager?
2008-06-28T16:06:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	I guess so... it was turned on when I started using 3D -things
2008-06-28T16:08:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	check that it is enabled in restricted drivers manager
2008-06-28T16:08:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	 oh.. thunderstorm here. I must quit now
2008-06-28T16:10:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	and yes it is enable in restricted drivers manager
2008-06-28T16:24:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	if you upgrade to hardy there is envyng-gtk to install all the latest drivers for ati and nvidia (it is in ubuntu repos)
2008-06-28T16:24:00.000Z	zoobox	bazhang	aha
2008-06-28T16:25:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	aye
2008-06-28T16:26:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	the wallpaper and such? no reason you cant save those and then put them into hardy wallpaper folder
2008-06-28T16:29:00.000Z	bazhang	zoobox	the new hardy is not that different in that respect, best to run a livecd and see what is different (ie you dont like) and save those from gutsy
