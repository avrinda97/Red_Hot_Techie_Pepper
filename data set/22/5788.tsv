2008-08-27T05:37:00.000Z	tominglis		i have installed apache2, mysql, php
2008-08-27T05:37:00.000Z	tominglis		including the prefork, php-gd / mysql modules

2008-08-27T05:38:00.000Z	tominglis		and when i put a php file in there it tries to download a phtml file
2008-08-27T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	don't use enter to break up your thoughts as it makes it harder to follow what you are saying
2008-08-27T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	follow the troubleshooting steps on the wiki page ubottu has just linked you to
2008-08-27T05:39:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	check if it does the same if the extension is just .php as well
2008-08-27T05:39:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	the extension is just php
2008-08-27T05:39:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	k then just follow the wiki then
2008-08-27T05:40:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	i am trying to install drupal
2008-08-27T05:46:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	i've read the lamp faq, and have tried loading a2enmod php5 manually, and then restarted apache and cleared firefox's cache, but i still can't get it to parse the php?
2008-08-27T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	and you checked that those files it mentions exist?
2008-08-27T05:48:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	yeah, libapache2-mod-php5 is installed
2008-08-27T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	not just installed, but you've checked that the files it should create actually exist?
2008-08-27T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	what does this return: ls -l /etc/apache2/mods-*/*php*
2008-08-27T05:54:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	yes the files are there
2008-08-27T05:58:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	http://pastebin.com/d2f6a123c
2008-08-27T06:03:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	is there anything else you think i should check? i did install postfix, apache, mysql, and php at the same time in synaptic
2008-08-27T06:04:00.000Z	tominglis	jrib	whereas most of the guides seem to break it down
2008-08-27T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	honestly, every time someone has this issue I just walk them through the steps on the wiki again and it gets sorted out.  You seem to be a bit knowledgeable though, so up to you if you want to go through that
2008-08-27T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	tominglis	installing everything at the same time shouldn't matter
