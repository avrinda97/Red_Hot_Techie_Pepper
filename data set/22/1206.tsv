2010-08-24T00:53:00.000Z	emacs_noob		does anybody know how to change default window manager in 10.04? nothing seems to work! gconf'ing required_components/windowmanager is not being honored, metacity gets loaded even before user logs in... it's a nightmare
2010-08-24T00:54:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Welcome to ubuntu!
2010-08-24T00:54:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	very quaint
2010-08-24T00:55:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	I'm completely serious.
2010-08-24T00:57:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	guess you're serious about welcoming me... thanks! but i interpreted your response as "ubuntu doesn't allow changing WM"
2010-08-24T00:57:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Feel welcomed, but I was actually referring to the latter
2010-08-24T00:57:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	It's an insane process, I hated it when I were running ubuntu
2010-08-24T00:58:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	yeah... insane it is.
2010-08-24T00:59:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Don
2010-08-24T00:59:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Dont want to recommend it to someone new, but you _could_ purge metacity completely
2010-08-24T00:59:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	And hurl in something good, like awesome
2010-08-24T01:00:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	unfortunately it's not possible to get rid of metacity, since gdm obviously depends on it for decoration, all i'm trying to do is to run my preferred StumpWM...
2010-08-24T01:05:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Hurl gnome+everything into the bin, run your WM without a DE and run SLIM as log-in manager if you want that :)
2010-08-24T01:06:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	But if you choose to do so; why are you running ubuntu? :)
2010-08-24T01:07:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	i do like gnome for dbus stuff
2010-08-24T01:09:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Explain why?
2010-08-24T01:13:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Are you still here? :)
2010-08-24T01:20:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	yeah, still here
2010-08-24T01:20:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	dbus is needed for an app i'm working on
2010-08-24T01:20:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	plus it's the only indirect way to communicate with bluetooth devices
2010-08-24T01:20:00.000Z	m0ar	emacs_noob	Well, then I understand :)
2010-08-24T01:21:00.000Z	emacs_noob	m0ar	i had a choice, to either use blueZ directly from within my app or to use dbus, i chose the latter
