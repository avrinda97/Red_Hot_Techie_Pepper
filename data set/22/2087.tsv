2012-02-29T16:29:00.000Z	parapan		hello everyone I use ubntu 10.04 LTS; after last update, the system starts very low, the HDD light is always flashing and every 10-15 seconds the systems tries to start File Manager which is not opening anyway; also , every 20 seconds the CPU goes 1005 for 2-3 seconds, and this happens all the time .....any clue how can I handle this ???
2012-02-29T16:31:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	can you explain the part where your CPU goes 1005?
2012-02-29T16:32:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	100%
2012-02-29T16:32:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	run top and figure out which process is consuming all your CPU
2012-02-29T16:33:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	problem is that if HDD is accessed all time, every single operation takes forever ...
2012-02-29T16:34:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	reinstall
2012-02-29T16:36:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	when you run the install CD, mount your hard drive and copy /home to a safe place befoer installing
2012-02-29T16:38:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	K, I can do that but ...the .Evolution folder will contain all the messages in order to import them afterward ????
2012-02-29T16:39:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	then when your done, copy /home back to your system
2012-02-29T16:40:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	just that easy ? copy old /home folder on top of the new one ??
2012-02-29T16:41:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	ideally you use a seperate partition for /home
2012-02-29T16:41:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	I managed to see some process - some times /usr/bin/X si taking 40-50% of the CPU, some times /usr/bin/python is going CPU to 99%
2012-02-29T16:45:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	I managed to see some process - some times /usr/bin/X si taking 40-50% of the CPU, some times /usr/bin/python is going CPU to 99% - is this telling something to you ??
2012-02-29T16:45:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	what are you running in python?
2012-02-29T16:46:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	I think it has to do with the update process
2012-02-29T16:47:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	can you find out the name of the process that is taking up all the CPU?
2012-02-29T16:48:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	just now, nautilus was taking 200% of the CPU ....but then is dissapearing and I cannot kill the process ...looks like a ghost process or so ...
2012-02-29T16:49:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	it sounds like you broke your system while updating, reinstall
2012-02-29T16:50:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	I was afraid of that ..I updated via USB modem and probably I had errors when downloading ....:(
2012-02-29T16:50:00.000Z	pfifo	parapan	update more often
2012-02-29T16:51:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	do you have any clue about evolution mail client if they have a support channel on freenode ??
2012-02-29T16:53:00.000Z	parapan	pfifo	Ok, thank you for support
