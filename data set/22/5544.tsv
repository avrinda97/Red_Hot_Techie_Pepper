2007-04-19T16:25:00.000Z	ricardator		pls... i can't check my emails (gmail and hotmail) through ubuntu-feisty... i have enabled cookies and javascript in browser...
2007-04-19T16:25:00.000Z	ricardator		anyone can help me?
2007-04-19T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	other web pages work ok?
2007-04-19T16:26:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	yes
2007-04-19T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	what happens when you visit gmail?
2007-04-19T16:33:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	so? any idea...?
2007-04-19T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	yes, that's kind of strange.  Have you tried a different browser?  Does it happen on windows if you have it?
2007-04-19T16:44:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	i've installed konqueror... and i could check just once gmail
2007-04-19T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	after that it failed just like firefox?
2007-04-19T16:45:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	yup 'connection lost' or 'connection broken'
2007-04-19T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	hmm it's really strange that it worked once though.  What if you clear the cache and try again?
2007-04-19T16:46:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	ive tried that
2007-04-19T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	I don't know then
2007-04-19T16:46:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	even, cause other reasons i've had to reinstall all system and i get the same problem
2007-04-19T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	how do you connect to the internet?
2007-04-19T16:47:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	adsl
2007-04-19T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	you have a router?
2007-04-19T16:48:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	yes
2007-04-19T16:48:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	a chinese one :p
2007-04-19T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	ricardator	well just to troubleshoot, I would see if it happens when you skip the router and connect directly
2007-04-19T16:49:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	i don't think router is the problem, 'cause when i had windows i didn't have this problem
2007-04-19T16:55:00.000Z	ricardator	jrib	thnxs for your time anyway
