2006-05-23T14:04:00.000Z	Ademan		how do you even do telnet-ish stuff in linux?
2006-05-23T14:05:00.000Z	Ademan		wow
2006-05-23T14:05:00.000Z	Ademan		what a crappy gateway IP lol
2006-05-23T14:07:00.000Z	Ademan		did hasan die?
2006-05-23T14:09:00.000Z	Ademan		hrm, i can't telnet to my router :-(
2006-05-23T14:09:00.000Z	Ademan		specific port maybe?
2006-05-23T14:09:00.000Z	Ademan		or is linksys mean?
2006-05-23T14:09:00.000Z	Ademan		zcat[1] : eh?
2006-05-23T14:10:00.000Z	Ademan		damn, so all i have is the web admin (probably best that way)
2006-05-23T14:10:00.000Z	jerware	Ademan	 if  you want to configure your linksys router.  contact the default gatway via web interface.  in your address bar type 192.168.1.1
2006-05-23T14:10:00.000Z	Ademan		yeah i don't have it
2006-05-23T14:11:00.000Z	jerware		why do you wnt to telnet Ademan?
2006-05-23T14:11:00.000Z	Ademan	jerware	haha i know, i just thought doing it through telnet might be kinda neat
2006-05-23T14:11:00.000Z	jerware		no desktop gui?
2006-05-23T14:11:00.000Z	Ademan	jerware	naw, just playing around
2006-05-23T14:11:00.000Z	jerware	Ademan	well if you like command line, use a command line web browser.
2006-05-23T14:11:00.000Z	jerware	Ademan	such as elinks.
2006-05-23T14:12:00.000Z	jerware		i think the latest linksys firmware does have telnet
2006-05-23T14:12:00.000Z	jerware		try upgrading the flash or firmware
2006-05-23T14:12:00.000Z	jerware		or what ever
2006-05-23T14:12:00.000Z	Ademan	jerware	hehe naw i was just foolin around, i had always wondered how people configured routers without web interfaces, and then zcat[1]  mentioned he did his through telnet, and my interest spiked :-)
