2011-10-28T17:56:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	never use 777
2011-10-28T17:56:00.000Z	znow	iceroot	errh okay
2011-10-28T17:57:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	and never ever in your whole live for a upload-directory in the internet
2011-10-28T17:57:00.000Z	znow	iceroot	errh what?
2011-10-28T17:57:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	please read that first
2011-10-28T17:57:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	no
2011-10-28T17:58:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	no
2011-10-28T17:58:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	when you know something about filepermissions you would not use 777
2011-10-28T17:58:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	that is stupid and wrong
2011-10-28T17:58:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	please read the link from ubottu first
2011-10-28T17:59:00.000Z	znow	iceroot	no thank you, have already read it
2011-10-28T18:00:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	so what is your question then?
2011-10-28T18:00:00.000Z	znow	iceroot	what I said earlier
2011-10-28T18:01:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	but the thing you said earlier is massive wrong and we told you why
2011-10-28T18:01:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	so i guess first fix this security issue
2011-10-28T18:02:00.000Z	znow	iceroot	the user is added as chown of the folder...
2011-10-28T18:02:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	first fix the permissions for "others"
2011-10-28T18:02:00.000Z	znow	iceroot	776 that is?
2011-10-28T18:03:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	then show us the command you used, ls -all on that dir and the exact error-code
2011-10-28T18:03:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	do others have to read and execute that?
2011-10-28T18:04:00.000Z	znow	iceroot	read and execute what?
2011-10-28T18:04:00.000Z	iceroot	znow	the content/file
