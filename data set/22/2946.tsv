2011-08-27T14:11:00.000Z	gaelfx		would I be able to play a game like Planeshift in Ubuntu using the default ATI drivers for a Radeon HD card, or would I need to install the fglrx driver?
2011-08-27T14:12:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	is that opengl game?
2011-08-27T14:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	linuxuz3r	I don't think so
2011-08-27T14:13:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	did you try it?
2011-08-27T14:14:00.000Z	gaelfx	linuxuz3r	no, I'm shopping for a new comp and wondering if one with an ATI card is serviceable for me
2011-08-27T14:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	linuxuz3r	or I guess a better question would be whether or not Blender functions well with ATI cards in Ubuntu
2011-08-27T14:15:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	im looking at the games website and its pretty much 1 video card
2011-08-27T14:15:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	i dont know i got nvidia card
2011-08-27T14:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	linuxuz3r	yeah, AMD laptops are much cheaper than Intel
2011-08-27T14:18:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	yeah
2011-08-27T14:18:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	thats why intel has lots of commercial these days

2011-08-27T14:21:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	im looking for an a series laptop
2011-08-27T14:25:00.000Z	gaelfx	linuxuz3r	I just want one with a screen big enough to do some graphics work and a decent enough graphics card to handle rendering scenes
2011-08-27T14:26:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	ok but if you are going to spend on a video card you might aswell spend around 150bucks
2011-08-27T14:26:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	go to newegg they have nice selection of radeon cards
2011-08-27T14:26:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	gaelfx	choose the amd brand
2011-08-27T14:28:00.000Z	gaelfx	linuxuz3r	yeah, that's where I'm at now, but the Chinese version is really weird
