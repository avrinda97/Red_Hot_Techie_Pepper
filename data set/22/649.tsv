2012-04-06T15:50:00.000Z	thunder1212		my laptop doesn;t shutdown
2012-04-06T15:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	please be more specific with your question. is there no shutdown button, does it lock up, does the fan keep spinning, etc?
2012-04-06T15:53:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	hi, actually, when i send the shutdown signal the system accepts it but gets stuck somewhere in between.. and i have to turn it off by pressing and holding the shutdon button
2012-04-06T15:54:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	am using a dell vostro laptop , 4mnths old came preinstalled with ubuntu 10.10 then i upgraded to 11.04,  worked fine for some time but for the last week or so it gets stuck
2012-04-06T15:54:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	i've seen laptop mode tools cause issues like that, are you using it?
2012-04-06T15:57:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	let me check, but if thats the case why won't it shutdown on windows
2012-04-06T16:00:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	no laptop-mode-tools
2012-04-06T16:06:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	r u there>>
2012-04-06T16:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	yes
2012-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	what to do now?? it doesn't shutdown..
2012-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	sorry, I have very little experience with shutdown issues, other than looking in /var/log (specifically the dmesg log), I don't have any suggestions for you
2012-04-06T16:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	I think they are trying to determine how far you computer DOES shut down. what is the *last* thing you see on your screen when attempting to shut down
2012-04-06T16:33:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	if you disconnect power and pull the battery, there is no need to hold the power button
2012-04-06T16:36:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	what do u meant if i take out the battery then of course i dont need to press and hold the power button of laptop..
2012-04-06T16:37:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	holding the power button should do the same thing as disconnecting the power+batteries, no need to do both
2012-04-06T16:44:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	what next
2012-04-06T16:47:00.000Z	thunder1212	DarwinSurvivor	do you want me to power off the system and then do what?
2012-04-06T16:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	have you tried switching to STTY2 (Ctrl+Alt+F2), then runnning "sudo shudown -h now" from there? if so, what was the LAST thing you saw on the screen and did it go black afterwards?
2012-04-06T16:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	even when running it from STTY2?
2012-04-06T16:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	thunder1212	please run the shutdown command from a TTY interface (Ctrl+Alt+F2, then login, then shutdown). that will hide the pretty dots and show actual messages of what  is happening
