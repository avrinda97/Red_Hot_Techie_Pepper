2010-03-02T11:29:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		Okay, Ubuntu has to do some SERIOUS work on Bluetooth... it is dreadful.
2010-03-02T11:30:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	Honestly I felt the 9.10 release was a step back in many ways -- not just bluetooth
2010-03-02T11:30:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	I have been trying for over  amonth now to get bluetooth working... and the Gnome stuff sucks.
2010-03-02T11:31:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	It neither detects my cellphone via the bluetooth dongle, and my phone detects the computer but cannot connect.
2010-03-02T11:34:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	have you looked into a Bluetooth manager like Blueman -- not sure if this would help solve the issue or not
2010-03-02T11:35:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	I installed blueman... same problem.  Except that blueman cannot be found anywhere.
2010-03-02T11:35:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	hm, sorry to heard that... let me see if there is anything I may be able to find and suggest
2010-03-02T11:37:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	I wish you would.
2010-03-02T11:37:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	Uninstalling all 'blue' entries in Synaptic and reinstalling them made no difference either.
2010-03-02T11:39:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	are you using wireless or hardwired internet connection?
2010-03-02T11:39:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	You mean to chat here?  Or when I use bluetooth?
2010-03-02T11:40:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	on the machine that you use bluetooth with [when your using it]
2010-03-02T11:42:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	hm, ok. I read a few places that individuals were needing specific wireless card drivers [when connecting via wi-fi] for the bluetooth to also work
2010-03-02T11:42:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	This is a bluetooth problem.  It worked.  Now it does not.  Bluetooth-applet no longer detects cellphone.
2010-03-02T11:49:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	I am trying that now'
2010-03-02T11:49:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	that's one that you should be able to run after disabling bluetooth
2010-03-02T11:52:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	have you also tried uninstalling bluetooth through the synaptic package manager?
2010-03-02T11:52:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	Yep.
2010-03-02T11:59:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	Configuration information is located in the /etc/bluetooth directory, along with the /etc/pcmcia directory for notebooks. The HCI information is saved in /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf, and RFCOMM configuration information is in /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf. The Bluetooth service script, /etc/rc.d/init.d/bluetooth, is used to start and stop Bluetooth services. This script will start up the Bluetooth daemon for HCI devices, hcid, and run any dete
2010-03-02T12:00:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	no problem, trying to see what I can do http://computingtech.blogspot.com/2009/01/using-bluetooth-in-ubuntu.html
2010-03-02T12:11:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	dividebyzer0	thanks for trying buddy.
2010-03-02T12:14:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	Ascavasaion	sorry couldn't be of more help!
