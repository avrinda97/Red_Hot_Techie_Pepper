2011-05-01T19:42:00.000Z	Omega	dury	How did you make the usb image?
2011-05-01T19:45:00.000Z	dury	Omega	http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download... I've followed the 2 point  Burn your CD or create a USB drive
2011-05-01T19:46:00.000Z	Omega	dury	What did you use to create it? What OS?
2011-05-01T19:46:00.000Z	dury	Omega	mmm Ubuntu
2011-05-01T19:47:00.000Z	dury	Omega	usb stick and ubuntu
2011-05-01T19:48:00.000Z	dury	Omega	start disk creator
2011-05-01T19:48:00.000Z	dury	Omega	in ubuntu
2011-05-01T19:49:00.000Z	Omega	dury	Try installing it with unetbootin (search for unetbootin in software center)
2011-05-01T19:51:00.000Z	dury	Omega	so I need another new usb stick then?
2011-05-01T19:51:00.000Z	Omega	dury	same usb stick, just use unetbootin to make it bootable
2011-05-01T19:52:00.000Z	Omega	dury	delete the one you have and make a new one with unetbootin (using the same iso)
2011-05-01T19:53:00.000Z	dury	Omega	but there are other important files in the same sub stick :(
2011-05-01T19:54:00.000Z	Omega	dury	Oh, can you take them off for a second? (you can put them back later)
2011-05-01T19:55:00.000Z	dury	Omega	minimum space required for 11.04 in the usb stick?
2011-05-01T19:56:00.000Z	Omega	dury	I think it's ~ 700 MB, but how are you booting right now?
2011-05-01T19:57:00.000Z	dury	Omega	I will see
