2010-05-27T18:03:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	so are you saying you're stuck on a black screen with only login ?
2010-05-27T18:03:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	ok so did this happen right after boot ?
2010-05-27T18:04:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	your username
2010-05-27T18:04:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	the username that you chose initially while installing,
2010-05-27T18:04:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	ok I think your xorg isn't working, so you need to go to recovery mode
2010-05-27T18:05:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	don't panic man, listen carefully,
2010-05-27T18:05:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	your username that you chose initially
2010-05-27T18:05:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	ok yeah go ahead
2010-05-27T18:06:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	after rebooting, you'll see a list of options, go to recovery
2010-05-27T18:08:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	did you remove your hardisk after installing it on another system ?
2010-05-27T18:08:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	looks like xorg isn't able to render anything, go to low graphics mode o
2010-05-27T18:08:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	and do you see the screen or again the black screen ?
2010-05-27T18:10:00.000Z	DarkSector	mlkjh	yeah do that
