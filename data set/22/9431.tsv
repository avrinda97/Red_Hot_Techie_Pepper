2005-04-27T15:05:00.000Z	Remenic		*sigh*.... ubuntu and usb sticks are not best friends, eh?
2005-04-27T15:05:00.000Z	Remenic		you should see my dmesg output... it's horrible... and it fails to detect the usb stick
2005-04-27T15:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Remenic	that would be a bug
2005-04-27T15:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Remenic	file it
2005-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Remenic	if it can mount it, it shoud
2005-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Remenic	what does dmesg say?
2005-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	Remenic	Burgundavia	it is mounted, nautilus even showed the contents of the usb disk
2005-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	Remenic	Burgundavia	but it doesn't show it in the 'Computer' screen, nor in the side panel
2005-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Remenic	then that would be a bug, file it
2005-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	Remenic	Burgundavia	I can only fill it if I know what's wrong
2005-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	Remenic	Burgundavia	a 'it doesn't work!' doesn't help anyone
2005-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Remenic	you have a specific bug. with output to prove it
2005-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Remenic	and is the current darling of osnews
