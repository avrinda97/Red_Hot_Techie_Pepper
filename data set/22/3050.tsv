2012-01-28T02:05:00.000Z	sneakster		I got a dumb question, this unity interface is pretty awful
2012-01-28T02:05:00.000Z	sneakster		Is  unity an unavoidable part of ubuntu
2012-01-28T02:06:00.000Z	sneakster		I was lookin at alternatives such as gnome 3 and kde and such, is that the equivalent of a seperate distribution from ubuntu
2012-01-28T02:07:00.000Z	sneakster		repos?
2012-01-28T02:07:00.000Z	sneakster		ah
2012-01-28T02:08:00.000Z	sneakster		It automatically logs on
2012-01-28T02:09:00.000Z	sneakster		I'm coming from windows, and I'm not too uncomfortable with the commandline, what would you reccomend in place of unity?
2012-01-28T02:10:00.000Z	sneakster		gnome looked good, I saw an article saying the direction of gnome between 2 and 3 changed a lot
2012-01-28T02:10:00.000Z	sneakster		does replacing unity with gnome change anything besides appearance? Would I lose any functionality?
2012-01-28T02:11:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	start with gnome,  however you can install as many desktops/wm as you like and choose at the login screen.
2012-01-28T02:17:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	log out, choose desktop, login
2012-01-28T02:24:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	logout from unity
2012-01-28T02:27:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	within unity find the shutdown/logout/restart menu and then logout
2012-01-28T02:38:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	 i dont understand what this unity stuff is about ... never met someone who liked it
2012-01-28T02:39:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	gnome2 + themes + compiz ... and you have a pretty decent desktop
2012-01-28T02:46:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	synaptic is the recommended package manager
2012-01-28T02:47:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	its in the adminstration menu
2012-01-28T02:49:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	if you have just made a fresh install, an update is recommended ... check the update manager in the administration menu
2012-01-28T02:51:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	in tne main menu (ubuntu icon in the toolbar)
2012-01-28T02:55:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	there are tons of comparisons ... just google it
2012-01-28T02:57:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	as it seems you are a total beginner ... why not getting familiar with the basic system first and play around later ... just my 2 cents
2012-01-28T02:59:00.000Z	biopyte	sneakster	 then tell your teacher to teach you how to log out  ..... :-o
