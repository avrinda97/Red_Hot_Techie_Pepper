2006-12-29T08:28:00.000Z	tim167		where can I see how much free space I have left on my harddrive ?
2006-12-29T08:30:00.000Z	tim167		ok my harddisk space is used for  91%, could this be the reason why my computer is so slow ?
2006-12-29T08:31:00.000Z	ken	tim167	You have swap? What's your RAM?
2006-12-29T08:32:00.000Z	ken	tim167	please wait
2006-12-29T08:35:00.000Z	ken	tim167	Right-click on GNOME launch panel>add to panel> In System and Hardware section, add System MOnitor
2006-12-29T08:35:00.000Z	tim167	ken	tnx
2006-12-29T08:36:00.000Z	ken	tim167	NOw you should have 1/2/3 graphs on your panel, right click on any graph go to preferences and check mark the SWAP graph on, disable all the other graphs. Now monitor the swap graph to see if you are overloading your SWAP area
2006-12-29T08:37:00.000Z	tim167	ken	in the Resources tab that is ?
2006-12-29T08:38:00.000Z	ken	tim167	please be a little more specific
2006-12-29T08:40:00.000Z	tim167	ken	i opened system monitor, you advised me to close the two graphs that are not the SWAP, I can't close them...but maybe that's not crucial. I just want to see if I have enough swap, diskspace, Ram, and find out why my system is so slow at times...
2006-12-29T08:41:00.000Z	ken	tim167	yes you got the idea, i asked you to disable those (if that was possible) so that you would get a clear idea whether your swap overflowed or not
2006-12-29T08:43:00.000Z	tim167	ken	swap graph is very static, around 33% usage
2006-12-29T08:43:00.000Z	ken	tim167	And you say your computer behaves sluggishly?
2006-12-29T08:44:00.000Z	tim167	ken	yes, especially when I have large images open in Gimp for example
2006-12-29T08:44:00.000Z	tim167	ken	my swap is 705 MB
2006-12-29T08:45:00.000Z	ken	tim167	CPU/RAM please
2006-12-29T08:46:00.000Z	tim167	ken	am running xload, i see large peaks when using Gimp, or OpenOffice, CPU=3gHz intel PIV, RAM=256MB
2006-12-29T08:46:00.000Z	ken	tim167	Something wrong. Sorry i can;t be of much help to you. Good luck with your linux endeavors.
2006-12-29T08:46:00.000Z	tim167	ken	then I have to wait after every action for a window to become active again (freezes)
2006-12-29T08:47:00.000Z	tim167	ken	np
2006-12-29T08:47:00.000Z	ken	tim167	Maybe LjL can help you.
2006-12-29T09:00:00.000Z	tim167	ken	LjL, stefg: ok guys, thanks for the help, I'll clearly have to go for more RAM, hope things get smoothened out a bit then :)
