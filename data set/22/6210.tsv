2006-12-01T15:29:00.000Z	Donut		My school has one PC running Edubuntu that I use frequently
2006-12-01T15:30:00.000Z	Donut		lol
2006-12-01T15:31:00.000Z	Donut		Hey, could anyone point me out to somewhere I can learn to make a distro EASILY?
2006-12-01T15:31:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	check out slax
2006-12-01T15:33:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	with slax you just add modules to the live-cd to make it a part of the distro
2006-12-01T15:36:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	put their name in the sentence
2006-12-01T15:37:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	like this?
2006-12-01T15:37:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	yep
2006-12-01T15:38:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	if you use xchat what you type will be in gray but the person who the message is for will see it in red
2006-12-01T15:39:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	Linux from scratch, downloading their LIveCD
2006-12-01T15:41:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	LSF is good but complex, you have a lot of options and can tailor it to your needs while Slax is pretty easy if you want quick results but has limitations (see http://www.slax.org/modules.php for an overview of what you can include with the distro)
2006-12-01T15:41:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	just so you know that you have options :)
2006-12-01T15:41:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	thanks
2006-12-01T15:42:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	that looks tasty. Just drag 'n' drop the mods u want into the CD.. Bliss!
2006-12-01T15:42:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	yep. but a bit limiting if you want total control :)
2006-12-01T15:43:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	I my just use it as a custom distro. I wanna do stuff like have my own text, images and stuff on it
2006-12-01T15:45:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	yeah, but don't know how to edit images and stuff... you know how?
2006-12-01T15:46:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	have a look in the modules provided and alter them before putting it on the cd
2006-12-01T15:46:00.000Z	Jowi	Donut	(for example the artwork modules)
2006-12-01T15:46:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	good idea. E-Mail address?
2006-12-01T15:46:00.000Z	Donut	Jowi	or are we not allowed :( ?
