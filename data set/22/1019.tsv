2011-10-12T04:45:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	I was answering meem1029.
2011-10-17T01:12:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	:/
2011-10-17T01:14:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	But there is a chance it will not have any ubuntu integration. Example, you installed php. But it's not like you can apt-get in a php5-mysql          to add mysql plugin to php5 (I going to call this PLUGIN for sake of argument. I know I know)
2011-10-17T01:16:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	eh?
2011-10-17T01:17:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	Yea, apt-get installing packages, and using .deb files is easy management for some people.        Although I do see points in where Source installs are better/easier management.
2011-10-17T01:17:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	oh, teamviewer's tarball isn't of source :)
2011-11-01T04:02:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	nope
2011-11-01T04:02:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	man chroot knows, though
2011-11-01T04:07:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	At the moment, I'm following this tutorial: http://forum.ovh.co.uk/showthread.php?t=3787         I can't chroot from a 32bit set up to a 64bit set up. (the /ubuntu).        I'm trying t to understand what's going on here.
2011-11-01T04:07:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	I done this before, yea on a real 64bit machine, but I'm working on a virtual machine that supports 54.
2011-11-01T04:08:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	you still need a 64-bit environment to chroot into a 64-bit environment
2011-11-01T04:10:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	But it's not offered on the server I'm working on. So I wonder if theres a work around. Like if I can apt-get install some packages to a different directory, as though it's the root directory orsomething (Basically, using apt-get to install for another system that is mounted in a different directory).
2011-11-01T04:10:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	you can yes
2011-11-01T04:11:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	So that's what I'm looking for. If this works out pretty well, I can happy dance and know what to do in the near future and not stand around looking "dumb".
2011-11-01T04:12:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	debootstrap is probably what you want
2011-11-01T04:36:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	I've already used debootstrap command to set up a 64bit ubuntu into a MOUNTED directory (Specifically: /ubuntu),      but I do not know what to do about installing packages for: /ubuntu
2011-11-01T06:58:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	should, if you do it right
2011-11-01T06:59:00.000Z	Ibis	reisio	But I do not know if it's installing FOR my "current system" I'm running commands from.    OR if it's installing FOR a system that's in /anotherDirectory.
2011-11-01T07:00:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	that's what chroot is for
2011-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	you could do it from a VM
2011-11-01T07:02:00.000Z	reisio	Ibis	but other ways would be simpler
