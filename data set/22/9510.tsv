2007-01-09T12:08:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Idiot		is there a program available that scans for wireless networks and then allows me to connect directly through the program?
2007-01-09T12:09:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Idiot		can anyone help me?
2007-01-09T12:11:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Idiot		thank you mneptok, i'll try network manager again. I used it earlier and it didnt seem to display any wireless networks
2007-01-09T12:11:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Idiot		although...when i installed it earlier, it said network manager was version 0.6. something
2007-01-09T12:11:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Idiot		is that normal?

2007-01-09T12:18:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	why is that?
2007-01-09T12:18:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	what did you install?
2007-01-09T12:18:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	did you install the gnome part of it also?
2007-01-09T12:19:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	aptitude install network-manager-gnome
2007-01-09T12:20:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	so do a dpkg -L network-manager-gnome | grep bin and see what you get
2007-01-09T12:21:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	so run nm-applet
2007-01-09T12:21:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	nm-applet
2007-01-09T12:22:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	what do you want to do?
2007-01-09T12:23:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	is your wireless card setup correctly?
2007-01-09T12:23:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	ok so all you should have to do is click on the icon that popped up and you should see the networks for your wireless
2007-01-09T12:24:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	yah well it is probably due to network manager being lame on the startup I bet if you reboot (which isn't the only way to fix this but the easiest way) it will fix your issue
2007-01-09T12:26:00.000Z	cowbud	Ubuntu_Idiot	restart
