2006-07-15T05:22:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	what are the I/O errors ? can you paste it..
2006-07-15T05:25:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	cant recall the error, but it hangs at "setting up keyboard"
2006-07-15T05:26:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	after hanging for 2minutes, it gives me a black screen, where every xxseconds gives me i/o errors
2006-07-15T05:26:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	sorry to me it looks vague..
2006-07-15T05:27:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	same here really...
2006-07-15T05:27:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	search in forums/google.. you may find some solutions if somebody has already hit it
2006-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	is the same errors happening while using a live cd environment ?
2006-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	cant boot the livecd version either
2006-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	same error ?
2006-07-15T05:31:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	i dont know, it stopped loading (loading bar + logo), took to long imo, and i rebooted into windows
2006-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	where did it get stuck.. sometimes you may need to do ctrl-c.. like while syncing clock with ntp server etc
2006-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	which may take sometime if your network is not fast or reliable
2006-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	i tried, but didn't do anthing
2006-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	no problems with the network here
2006-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	is it a dapper cd ?
2006-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	let me check
2006-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	yes, dapper
2006-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	cypher1	RvGaTe	it would be great if the message was captured
2006-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	i could try it again and write it down
2006-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	itl take a few mnutes
2006-07-15T05:59:00.000Z	RvGaTe	cypher1	back, i waited untill i thought it stopped doing anything, took my camera, and took a picture... (uploading it)
