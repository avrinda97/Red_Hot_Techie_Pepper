2010-07-19T23:46:00.000Z	nkei0		is there any way to grow a partition without moving it in gparted?
2010-07-19T23:47:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	gparted should grow your partition, given that it is on the same drive and it has space to do so
2010-07-19T23:48:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	Yeah, i've attempted it once before, however, it failed right at the end...  I'm thinking the grow goes okay, but the move is failing, and when it does it reverts back to how it was.
2010-07-19T23:48:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	and it gives no error messages or warnings about why it reverts?
2010-07-19T23:49:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	let me check the details that i saved, even though i didn't see anything
2010-07-19T23:51:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	I get two error messages on the details: move filesystem to the left  01:19:57    ( ERROR ) and copy 49090560 sectors using a blocksize of 256 sectors  01:19:43    ( ERROR ) 43701760 of 49090560 copied Error while reading block at sector 383112704
2010-07-19T23:51:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	You may have bad sectors on your hard disk.
2010-07-19T23:52:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	Am I going to need to create a new partition table?
2010-07-19T23:53:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	No. please be patient, I am typing.
2010-07-19T23:59:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	you need to run badblocks. sudo badblocks -nvs /dev/yourdevice
2010-07-20T00:00:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	Do i need to be in a live environment to do that?
2010-07-20T00:00:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	yes
2010-07-20T00:01:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	Should I do that on the partition that I'm trying to grow or on the unallocated space?
2010-07-20T00:01:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	nevermind dumb question
2010-07-20T00:01:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	since you've got bad blocks, I'd check everything
2010-07-20T00:01:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	well, MAYBE have bad blocks
2010-07-20T00:02:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	Currently, I'm trying a resize/move operation that's a little less work on the system right now.  Instead of trying to add 75gig I only told it to add 25 and i'm going to see how that works.
2010-07-20T00:03:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	Right, but let me explain to you the problem. It's crashing because when gparted is doing the resize or move operation, the program terminates because it encounters what it believes may be a bad sector on your hard drive. Let me know if you understand that part.
2010-07-20T00:04:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	Yeah, i do, i was just saying that it'll have to wait until that finishes.
2010-07-20T00:09:00.000Z	sprung	nkei0	also try fsck -a
2010-07-20T00:10:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	cool, thanks
2010-07-20T00:26:00.000Z	nkei0	sprung	when i do "fsck -a" it just gives me a version number of fsck i think
