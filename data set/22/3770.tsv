2010-09-04T20:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	handjob	if the second machine does not have any inet access you have to use aptocd becouse it will set up the cd/iso to behave as repositorie
2010-09-04T20:36:00.000Z	handjob	erUSUL	Thanks. Maybe I sould do so.
2010-09-04T21:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	handjob	you have to add the cdrom as software source.
2010-09-04T21:29:00.000Z	handjob	erUSUL	I mounted iso under /media/cdrom. I need to add that path to sources.list?
2010-09-04T21:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	handjob	sudo losetup apt_on_cd_image.iso && sudo apt-cdrom add /dev/loop0
2010-09-04T21:30:00.000Z	handjob	erUSUL	I will try that. Thx.

2010-09-04T21:40:00.000Z	handjob	erUSUL	Sorry to bether You. I am running out of time. I think that maybe fastes way would be to generate install script of aptoncd install it and the perform the iso install. Can You tell me what software is used for making such a script?
2010-09-04T21:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	handjob	i do not know what script you are talking about. the page a linkled has simple instructions
