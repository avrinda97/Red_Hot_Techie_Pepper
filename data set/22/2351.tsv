2009-07-10T19:43:00.000Z	juke_		hi where is that startup file where you disable/enable things?
2009-07-10T19:43:00.000Z	juke_		i think NM is disable here but i forgot where to re enable it
2009-07-10T19:43:00.000Z	juke_		also once i add a mobile broadband info, how do i dial up?
2009-07-10T19:44:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	/etc/init.d/*
2009-07-10T19:44:00.000Z	juke_		i see the option connect autopmaticalluy
2009-07-10T19:44:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	or use sysv-rc-conf
2009-07-10T19:44:00.000Z	juke_	cusco	is there any command?
2009-07-10T19:45:00.000Z	juke_	cusco	like chkconfig NetworkManager start or soemthing
2009-07-10T19:45:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	what are you on about? a network connection starting autoamticallY?
2009-07-10T19:46:00.000Z	juke_	cusco	ok what i mean is, now NM is disabled on startup, i want to use it with my vodafone mobile connect activated phone, so i want to re-enable it at startup but forgot where to do so
2009-07-10T19:46:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	in networkmanager
2009-07-10T19:47:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	right-click on it - edit connections
2009-07-10T19:47:00.000Z	juke_	cusco	NM doesnt run on startup :P
2009-07-10T19:47:00.000Z	juke_		its disabled
2009-07-10T19:47:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	does NM does not start or only NM-applet
2009-07-10T19:47:00.000Z	cusco		?
2009-07-10T19:48:00.000Z	juke_	cusco	possibly NM-applet
2009-07-10T19:49:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	lauch from console: nm-applet
2009-07-10T19:49:00.000Z	juke_	cusco	and if it is NM itself?
2009-07-10T19:49:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	if nm-applet starts and you can use-it just add it to your gnome-sessions
2009-07-10T19:49:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	if it starts but it says NetworkManager is not running
2009-07-10T19:50:00.000Z	cusco	juke_	then use sysv-rc-conf to enable NetworkManager on init 3
