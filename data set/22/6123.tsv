2007-09-20T05:42:00.000Z	amro		How to change root password? when I use "sudo passwd root" it shows me "Unknow id"
2007-09-20T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	amro	there is no need to set a root password on Ubuntu
2007-09-20T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	amro	because you don't need one and the ubuntu developers have based the security model around sudo
2007-09-20T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	amro	yes, "sudo" requests your user's password
2007-09-20T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	amro	what do you mean?  What are you trying to do?
2007-09-20T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	amro	read teh page from ubotu, it explains how to use sudo.  There's no need for a root password
2007-09-20T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	amro	k
2009-02-08T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	amro	define "fetch"
2009-02-08T17:52:00.000Z	amro	jrib	download the .debs and save them in /var/cache/apt/archives
2009-02-08T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	amro	well --download-only together with --reinstall should make them download.  You may have to script the fetching of dependencies.  There may be an easier way, but I don't know it
2009-02-08T17:55:00.000Z	amro	jrib	thanks. I'm trying to mirror this install on an offline computer- is there a better way to do it?
2009-02-08T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	amro	now once you get that list on the offline computer, there are tools like apt-zip (or synaptic will generate script) which I believe you can then just transfer back to the online computer and grab the debs that way.  I've never done this though
2009-02-08T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	amro	if it gets too complicated, then the kludgy solution would be to just install a fresh ubuntu in vbox on the online computer and use that to download the debs
2009-02-08T18:06:00.000Z	amro	jrib	thanks I'll try that
2009-02-08T18:17:00.000Z	amro	jrib	aptitude: unrecognized option '--disable-columns'
2009-02-08T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	amro	http://algebraicthunk.net/~dburrows/projects/aptitude/doc/en/ see if you can figure out how to get long names to show up I guess
2009-02-08T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	amro	I *think* you can just drop that option, check
2009-02-08T18:26:00.000Z	amro	jrib	yeah I did it, just poiting out it the option is invalid
2009-02-08T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	amro	it worked ok?
2009-02-08T18:28:00.000Z	amro	jrib	yep, now need to figure out a way to get all those packages across
2009-02-08T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	amro	thanks
2009-02-08T19:08:00.000Z	amro	jrib	not people, code monkeys :)
