2009-01-01T18:34:00.000Z	clitoral	Enselic	I'll check
2009-01-01T18:35:00.000Z	clitoral		I don't think there is a physical switch
2009-01-01T18:36:00.000Z	clitoral	Enselic	Do you know any reasons why or why not my wireless isn't workinig?
2009-01-01T18:37:00.000Z	clitoral		The wifi light isn't on but the bluetooth light is on
2009-01-01T18:38:00.000Z	clitoral		I wish you cared about a simple man with no wireless
2009-01-01T18:38:00.000Z	clitoral		Do you hate me?
2009-01-01T18:38:00.000Z	Enselic	clitoral	have you installed the driver?
2009-01-01T18:38:00.000Z	clitoral		Dell Inspiron 6400
2009-01-01T18:39:00.000Z	clitoral	Enselic	I have done everything in this faq: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297092&highlight=dell+1390+ndiswrapper
2009-01-01T18:39:00.000Z	clitoral		Standard ndiswrapper crap
2009-01-01T18:39:00.000Z	Enselic	clitoral	why have you bought a computer with a wireless card that is manufactured by someone not caring about Linux support?
2009-01-01T18:40:00.000Z	clitoral	Enselic	It's not mine, I stole it from a black person who isn't very well off.
2009-01-01T18:40:00.000Z	clitoral		Just kidding
2009-01-01T18:40:00.000Z	clitoral		No
2009-01-01T18:40:00.000Z	clitoral		It's my girlfriends
2009-01-01T18:41:00.000Z	clitoral	Enselic	She has no idea about GNU ideology nor does she care. I'm putting linux on here to kind of introduce her to using different (and better) operating systems.
2009-01-01T18:42:00.000Z	Enselic	clitoral	I never have had the need to mess around with ndis wrapper so I'm not able to help, sorry
