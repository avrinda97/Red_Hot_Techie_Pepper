2006-03-17T16:33:00.000Z	bliss1_		hey
2006-03-17T16:34:00.000Z	bliss1_		how do I supply or show a full path to a directory at command line ie to /usr/local/ssl
2006-03-17T16:34:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	What do you mean by full path? Isn't /usr/local/bliss already ful path?
2006-03-17T16:35:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	May you are asking about command 'pwd'
2006-03-17T16:39:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	Because /usr/local/ssl is not in path
2006-03-17T16:40:00.000Z	bliss1_	onkarshinde	thanks so how to make it so it is in path
2006-03-17T16:41:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	typr followng command to do it temporary 'export PATH=/usr/local/ssl/bin:$PATH'
2006-03-17T16:42:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	To do that on permanent basis, add same line to ~/.bashrc and ~/.basg_profile
2006-03-17T16:43:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	Why did you install openssl this way?
2006-03-17T16:45:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	I mean openssl is already installed I guess. If it is not then you should install from Synaptic.
2006-03-17T16:53:00.000Z	bliss1_	onkarshinde	export --command not found
2006-03-17T16:57:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	On my system I can run export command just fine.
2006-03-17T17:05:00.000Z	bliss1_	onkarshinde	which package does export come with
2006-03-17T17:06:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	I don't know.
2006-03-17T17:13:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	You should be.
2006-03-17T17:14:00.000Z	bliss1_	onkarshinde	thanks it works now if I want this to happen always what is the full command at prompt
2006-03-17T17:15:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	Add the same command to .bashrc and .bash_profile in your home directory
2006-03-17T17:17:00.000Z	bliss1_	onkarshinde	you mean this command export PATH=/usr/local/ssl/bin:$PATH
2006-03-17T17:17:00.000Z	onkarshinde	bliss1_	With export
2006-03-17T17:28:00.000Z	bliss1_	onkarshinde	so at the prompt which is bliss1 which is where .bashrc and .bash-profile are I expect I just type export PATH=/usr/local/ssl/bin:$PATH
2006-04-29T14:18:00.000Z	bliss1_	onkarshinde	hi
