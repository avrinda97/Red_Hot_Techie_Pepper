2008-12-04T18:15:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	anything that can be done?
2008-12-04T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	Ashgadgets	pastebin the exact command and output.  And describe any ideas you have (ie what are the last things you did before the problem arose)
2008-12-04T18:19:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/80310/
2008-12-04T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	Ashgadgets	try strace, maybe someone will see something
2008-12-04T18:20:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	strace apt-get -f install ?
2008-12-04T18:23:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/80311/
2008-12-04T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	Ashgadgets	doesn't mean much to me, don't know
2008-12-04T18:25:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	does it have anything to do with the distro not getting updated?
2008-12-04T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	Ashgadgets	I doubt it.  Did you try googling 'apt-get segfault'.  I think I've seen someone asking about this before, so you might get some hits that can give you some ideas
2008-12-04T18:28:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	will see that
2008-12-05T17:45:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	my apt-get problem is noT YET solved! :(
2008-12-05T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	Ashgadgets	come across this: http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/debian-linux-help/80216-apt-get-segmentation-fault.html ?  Might be smarter to mv instead of rm though
2008-12-05T17:50:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	that didnt help
2008-12-05T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	Ashgadgets	you removed *.bin in /var/cache/apt/ ?
2008-12-05T17:51:00.000Z	Ashgadgets	jrib	indeed
2008-12-05T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	Ashgadgets	and then ran 'sudo apt-get update'?
