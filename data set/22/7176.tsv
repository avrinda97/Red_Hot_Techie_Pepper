2006-05-24T16:21:00.000Z	DBO		!paste
2006-05-24T16:22:00.000Z	DBO		hello anonymouse, do you have a question or just here for community?
2006-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	DBO		telnet!?
2006-05-24T16:23:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	I am using the 6.06 beta live cd.  I have set up a software raid5 array with mdmadm.  i have created pg and logical volumes with lvm
2006-05-24T16:24:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	When I reboot the live cd, it finds my vols fine.  I can format them from command line and mount them, etc.
2006-05-24T16:24:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	i thought you said you were a n00b =P
2006-05-24T16:24:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	but GParted, and the ubuntu installer don't understand the volumes.
2006-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	I see... are you running evms?
2006-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	I am new (as of this week) to mdadm, lvm, and ubuntu.  but I'm a loooong time linux admin =)
2006-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	it hijacks your volumes to /dev/evms/foo
2006-05-24T16:26:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	 my volumes appear at /dev/mapper/vg0-....
2006-05-24T16:26:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	ok, fightpc says there is a glitch, try the new snapshot =)
2006-05-25T15:38:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	full install uses ext3
2006-05-25T15:38:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	sorry, I wasnt looking there...  did you try installing breezy and doing the upgrade like suggested?
2006-05-25T15:39:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	unfortunately breezy doesn't detect my sata card so no dice
2006-05-25T15:39:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	argle... I wonder why the heck its doing that...  file a bug report?
2006-05-25T15:40:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	sudo apt-get install unionfs-utils (maybe?)
2006-05-25T15:41:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	your motherboard doesnt have native SATA, you are using a card correct?
2006-05-25T15:42:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	it does have native sata, and all OS's so far detect those two drives.  but not the other 4 on the sata card
2006-05-25T15:42:00.000Z	DBO	anonymouse	uhhhhhhh... brain go implode...
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	anonymouse	DBO	I know what you mean
