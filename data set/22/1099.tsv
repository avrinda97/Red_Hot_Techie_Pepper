2011-04-20T23:05:00.000Z	Aer		Hi, i was wondering if anyone could give me a hand, when i use the "update manager" i get the following error message "Not all updates can be installed" "Run a partial upgrade, to install as many updates as possible"
2011-04-20T23:05:00.000Z	Aer		What would a partial upgrade be ? would that upgrade me from 10.4 LTS to the latest non LTS ?
2011-04-20T23:07:00.000Z	Aer		anyone lol ? :P
2011-04-20T23:08:00.000Z	Aer		ok, thanks stefg, I will try now shcherbak
2011-04-20T23:09:00.000Z	Aer		i get "the following packages have been kept back"
2011-04-20T23:09:00.000Z	Aer		"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" and "The following packages will be upgraded" "linux-libc-dev"
2011-04-20T23:10:00.000Z	Aer		i got a lot of hits and a few "ign"
2011-04-20T23:10:00.000Z	Aer		im guessing it ignored some
2011-04-20T23:10:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	ign is normal
2011-04-20T23:11:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	usually not recommended
2011-04-20T23:12:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	ooops - we contradicted each other - I never tried that, was always warned off
2011-04-20T23:13:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	what I did in such cases was sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
2011-04-20T23:15:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	Good luck :-)
2011-04-20T23:33:00.000Z	Aer	guntbert	are you still there ?
2011-04-20T23:33:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	yes
2011-04-20T23:35:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	that means one upgrade was not possible, but you should be fine for now, did you enable any ppa s?
2011-04-20T23:36:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	then that *could* be the reason, try, disable it and run the update/safe-upgrade sequence again
2011-04-20T23:37:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	no problem, we all learn :)
2011-04-20T23:37:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	yes, that should work
2011-04-20T23:43:00.000Z	Aer	guntbert	i get "0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded." with safeupgrade after i disabled my PPA for the graphics
2011-04-20T23:44:00.000Z	Aer	guntbert	I think this is the problem this is displayed also"The following packages have been kept back: winetricks{a}"
2011-04-20T23:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Aer	did it tell you which package was not upgraded (its a long time back for me)
