2008-07-07T23:49:00.000Z	illogic-al		I've a question for you all.
2008-07-07T23:50:00.000Z	illogic-al		i need to install on a computer without a ide drive, that has a sata drive.
2008-07-07T23:50:00.000Z	illogic-al		does ubuntu allow this. i tried and it didn't pick up my pci sata card.
2008-07-07T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	ide/sata doesn't make a difference
2008-07-07T23:51:00.000Z	illogic-al	ikonia	oh. it does make a difference. a huge difference.
2008-07-07T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	pardon ?
2008-07-07T23:55:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	most ide/sata chipsets are supported and if not the generic drivers normally work
2008-07-07T23:55:00.000Z	illogic-al	ikonia	most, of course != all :-)
2008-07-07T23:55:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	what chipset are you using for your sata controller
2008-07-07T23:56:00.000Z	illogic-al	ikonia	sata_sil i beilieve.,
2008-07-07T23:56:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	thats a driver, not a chipset
2008-07-07T23:58:00.000Z	illogic-al	ikonia	silicon image
2008-07-07T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	yes, but which chipset, thats just a make
2008-07-07T23:58:00.000Z	illogic-al	ikonia	sil 3512 maybe
2008-07-07T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	perfect, thanks

2008-07-08T00:43:00.000Z	illogic-al	ikonia	that's fine, just wanted to let you know i'm experiencing the symptoms described at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/206635 . without all_generic_ide leading to a fix unfortunately.
2008-07-08T00:43:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	I'll have a look
2008-07-08T01:19:00.000Z	illogic-al	ikonia	card wasn't making proper contact w/ the slot. i got it to show up just now.
2008-07-08T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	illogic-al	oh, thats excellent, well done
