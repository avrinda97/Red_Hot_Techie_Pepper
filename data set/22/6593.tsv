2007-08-02T07:08:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	just run 'sudo iptables -L' to look at your currently active firewall rules. If you get an "empty" response, nothing on the ubuntu side will prevent you from syncing with your Pocket PC
2007-08-02T07:09:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	Thanks will try that... I have a hardware router too with firewall so I wanted to see if that was covered, though I wouldn't think that'd interfere between a PC<-->PocketPC connection
2007-08-02T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	it shouldn't, if both your PC and PPC are on the LAN and the router just shields you from the public internet.
2007-08-02T07:10:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	K thanks - I can't seem to sync and I suspect that might be the issue... Pocket Pc recognized/connects but doesn't transfer info...
2007-08-02T07:10:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	are you following the howto on the forums site?
2007-08-02T07:10:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	This one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/WindowsMobile
2007-08-02T07:12:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	I hadn't seen this one. Check out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=30936 -- it has some extra troubleshooting stuff
2007-08-02T07:12:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	Thanks - will do...
2007-08-02T07:13:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	I've given up on Pocket PC syncing myself. Waiting for the consumer OpenMoko phone now...
2007-08-02T07:14:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	There's something called "opensync" which is based off multisync or something, too...  Was able to get my Dad's Sony "Clie" (Palm) to sync at any rate. I can get Pocket Pc to connect, just not sync with Evolution...
2008-08-14T19:57:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	please recommend the package installation for flash, not the firefox-based one
2008-08-14T19:57:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	They are one in the same now (the flash)
2008-08-14T19:58:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	when there is a Ubuntu package, you should recommend using it
2008-08-14T19:59:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	The addons menu of FF uses the Ubuntu Packages (for Flash and other ones available)
2008-08-14T20:01:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	I can't verify that here. Can you point me to some place where that is documented?
2008-08-14T20:01:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	No, though it was general knowledge (?) that they switch to that as a feature of either Hardy or Edgy..
2008-08-14T20:03:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	you're essentially saying that firefox interfaces with apt. I don't think that's the case.
2008-09-06T23:40:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	I'd go vice versa and use sudo on both ( TheMaxzilla
2008-09-06T23:41:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	It's a compound statement, so I don't beleive it's necessary (I may be wrong, though)
2008-09-06T23:41:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	the sudo will not have an effect on the second aptitude call
2008-09-06T23:42:00.000Z	ShackJack	soundray	O.K. I'll take your word for it :)
2008-10-07T00:30:00.000Z	soundray	ShackJack	aptitude clean does something different
