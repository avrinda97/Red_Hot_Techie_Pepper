2012-07-08T11:22:00.000Z	RandNum		I think after 2 days I finally have dual boot ubuntu/windows working on my Lenovo computer...sigh
2012-07-08T11:23:00.000Z	RandNum		it's installing right now
2012-07-08T11:25:00.000Z	RandNum		*quiet splash
2012-07-08T11:27:00.000Z	RandNum		I'm installing from a usb drive and I never know when it's time to remove the usb drive. It said it was time to restart so I selected 'restart' and pulled out the drive and now it's frozen
2012-07-08T11:27:00.000Z	RandNum		I think I fubar'd it up :(
2012-07-08T11:28:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	I wait until it turns off. After you hit restart it does some cleanup/unmounting... sounds like it got a bit fubared still running that stuff.
2012-07-08T11:32:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	shutdown, and remove the thumbdrive
2012-07-08T11:37:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	grub didn't install for whatever reason...
2012-07-08T11:38:00.000Z	RandNum	L3top	hmmm. I should be able to go into repair mode and install grub somewhere ya?
2012-07-08T12:01:00.000Z	RandNum	L3top	I'm in my rescue mode installation now.  I have #1 primary ntfs Boot partiton, #2 primary ntfs, #3 ext4, #4 swap.  I don't have a grub boot location?
2012-07-08T12:02:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	grub lives in the MBR of the boot drive... again... typically /dev/sda
2012-07-08T12:22:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	yes... grub installs there, and gives you the option to boot into windows or ubuntu... not in a partition, but on the drive assignment... ie /dev/sda     not /dev/sda2 etc
2012-07-08T12:42:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	what partition is your ubuntu install on?
2012-07-08T12:48:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	sudo -s
2012-07-08T12:49:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	mount /dev/sda6 mnt; mount -o bind /dev mnt/dev; mount none -t devpts mnt/dev/pts; mount none -t sysfs mnt/sys
2012-07-08T12:49:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	chroot /mnt
2012-07-08T12:50:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	grub-install /dev/sda; update-grub
2012-07-08T12:56:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	give it a reboot
2012-07-08T12:59:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	can you please get me an output of sudo fdisk -l  in pastebin?
2012-07-08T13:02:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	That really should have worked.
2012-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	that will guarantee you are back in the same position.
2012-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	L3top	RandNum	once you install windows that is...
