2005-06-07T07:44:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	heh, no prob :)
2005-06-07T07:41:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	'vmstat 1' on a terminal
2005-06-07T07:43:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	wow, thanks!  vmstat 1 fixed it!  you're some kind of magician :)
2005-06-07T07:45:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	very odd.  it was really slow - a 3 second response time just to move the cursor in oo.org.  now it's fine!
2005-06-07T07:46:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	maybe some high disk i/o? that usually slows my system down
2005-06-07T07:48:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	nope, no disk IO at all.  it's not even swapping yet.
2005-06-07T07:48:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	that's not the first time I've seen it - firefox sometimes misbehaves too
2005-06-07T07:48:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	so it got fixed just by running vmstat?
2005-06-07T07:48:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	almost certainly not.  but it got fixed at the same time as I ran vmstat.
2005-06-07T07:49:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	and it's still fixed now that I've stopped running vmstat
2005-06-07T07:50:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	it's known as "treatment by light" - open the hood, and problem disappears :)
2005-06-07T07:50:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	I've seen the same phenomenum lots of times when debugging software...  run a buggy app inside the debugger and the bug goes away.  run it normally and the bug comes back
2005-06-07T08:02:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	i dont know if someone already pasted this, but http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#codecs
2005-06-07T08:05:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	that ubuntuguide site suggests getting the codecs from backports
2005-06-07T08:05:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	and apparently that's not a good idea
2005-06-07T08:05:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	why not?
2005-06-07T08:05:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	scroll up - thoreauputic says why not
2005-06-09T14:49:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	I don't think so - I've tested the RAM thoroughly
2005-06-09T14:50:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	maybe motherboard then, ide bridges
2005-06-09T14:59:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	debsums can be used to check files' md5 sums against your dpkg database
2005-06-09T15:00:00.000Z	dooglus	pfp	oh, thanks.  I didn't know about that.
2005-06-09T15:00:00.000Z	pfp	dooglus	it's handy if your server gets hax0red... which never happens ofc :/
