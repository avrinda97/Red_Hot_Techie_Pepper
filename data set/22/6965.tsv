2008-03-05T18:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	Thanks..  I try
2008-03-05T18:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	I would expect some issues trying that..
2008-03-05T18:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	I would create the default on /  then try to point home to your old partition, if that does not work well, point it back and copy over
2008-03-05T18:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	Assume you know this but   http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
2008-03-05T18:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	Documentation always helps
2008-03-05T18:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	I would like to think they used all standard locations.. but .. I hate to assume..
2008-03-05T18:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	Perfect example might be .mozilla/plugins
2008-03-05T18:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	best to have the installer create one as default even if you dont use it, than need it and not have it
2008-03-05T18:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	I just see too many things that might cause you issues like permissions etc.  and it would be nice to have a working gui to try and straighten it out
2008-03-05T18:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	I would let ubuntu make /home on root...   try to use the page I gave you to set your old home as the new home and see if it works..
2008-03-05T18:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	you can always create folder on root, wipe old /home and create new home from ubuntu default /homer on root and copyu stuff back

2008-03-05T18:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nickthorley	Install manually, their auto installer has had issues
