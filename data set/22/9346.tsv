2005-01-27T09:08:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	pop in a blank cd
2005-01-27T09:08:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	and drag  your files into the folder that pops up
2005-01-27T09:08:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	then go File -> Burn, I believe
2005-01-27T09:09:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	well, my CD burner doesn't seem to be recognized
2005-01-27T09:09:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	I cannot eject it
2005-01-27T09:09:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	right click on the CD icon on your desktop and choose 'Eject'
2005-01-27T09:10:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	there is no cd icon on the desktop
2005-01-27T09:10:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	but you're saying you have another (non-blank) cd in the drive?
2005-01-27T09:10:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	something is in there, I dont know if it is blank or not
2005-01-27T09:11:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	can you go to Places -> Computer and see if there's an icon there?
2005-01-27T09:11:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	there is an icon there, but when i click on it, it says cannot mount
2005-01-27T09:12:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	and pressing the physical eject button on your drive doesn't work?
2005-01-27T09:12:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	it does now that I re-plugged in the drive
2005-01-27T09:12:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	what kind of plugin? usb/firewire/laptop?
2005-01-27T09:12:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	usb
2005-01-27T09:13:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	so you've got your old cd out?
2005-01-27T09:13:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	yes
2005-01-27T09:14:00.000Z	gabaug	hacim	any luck putting in a new blank?
2005-01-27T09:14:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	I think I put a blank in
2005-01-27T09:14:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	I can't really tell for sure if it is blank or not :)
2005-01-27T09:16:00.000Z	hacim	gabaug	when I put a cd in, it doesn't pop up
