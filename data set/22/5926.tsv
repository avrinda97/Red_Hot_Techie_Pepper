2008-01-22T20:51:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	so just exit in the terminal?
2008-01-22T20:51:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	just start a new shell
2008-01-22T20:51:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	how would I do that inside a terminal window? it doesn't seem to work if I just open a new twerminal in gnome.
2008-01-22T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	what is your username
2008-01-22T20:52:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	andromeda
2008-01-22T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	grep andromeda /etc/group
2008-01-22T20:53:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	alright, the /etc/groups says I am a member of vpnc
2008-01-22T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	ok - so do "id andromada" does that show you ?
2008-01-22T20:53:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	it says vpnc in the list
2008-01-22T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	ok, so log out and back in
2008-01-22T20:54:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	sorry, I don't know how to log out and back in inside a terminal window.
2008-01-22T20:54:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	just exit your desktop and log back in - it will be easier
2008-01-22T20:54:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	oy, that means I lose everything I was working on :/
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	su - andromeda
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	that worked!!!
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	thanks
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	great,
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	just be aware it will only work in that one shell until you log out of gnome and back in
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	nice!!!
2008-01-22T20:56:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	ikonia	that is fine, I now have access to vpnc ^_^
2008-01-22T20:56:00.000Z	ikonia	OmegaCenti	ok, just keep that in mind
