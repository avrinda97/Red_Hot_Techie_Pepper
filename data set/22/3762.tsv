2008-10-02T14:18:00.000Z	ne2k__		I am using network-manager-pptp 0.6.5. I have put in a username and password which are saved, and so I don't get prompted. trouble is, the password has changed, but I can't work out how to get network-manager to prompt me for it again, not can I find a file in which it is stored. how can I enter the new password?
2008-10-02T14:18:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	system -> prefernces -> keyring,  i think
2008-10-02T14:19:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	I don't see anything about my pptp logins in there
2008-10-02T14:19:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	encryption and keyrings, that is.
2008-10-02T14:20:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	the keyring should have all your stored passwords
2008-10-02T14:20:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	of course. but how do I change one or delete one?
2008-10-02T14:23:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	right click and hit delete
2008-10-02T14:23:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	on what, exactly?
2008-10-02T14:24:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	I have run system->preferences->encryption and keyrings. there are five tabs: password keyrings, encryption, pgp passphrases, key servers, key sharing
2008-10-02T14:24:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	hit passwords, find the one you want to delete, right click it, and delete
2008-10-02T14:24:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	there is nothing called passwords
2008-10-02T14:25:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	what program are you running, and which package is it in?
2008-10-02T14:26:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	oh sorry, should be applications -> accessories -> passwords and encryption keys
2008-10-02T14:26:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	thanks very much! got it!
2008-10-02T14:28:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	I feel like a little bit of a dunce now... that was pretty easy! ;-)
2008-10-02T14:31:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	isnt the deceptively simple always fun?
2008-10-02T14:40:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	what's the difference between that and $PS1?
2008-10-02T14:41:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	PS1?
2008-10-02T14:41:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	the "old way"
2008-10-02T14:42:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	for PROMPT_COMMAND? no idea. i just looked through bashrc til i found the line that does the prompt
2008-10-02T14:47:00.000Z	ne2k__	maco	otherwise known as hiragana ;-)
2008-10-02T14:47:00.000Z	maco	ne2k__	not trying to get technical
