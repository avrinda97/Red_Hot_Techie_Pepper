2006-01-18T08:06:00.000Z	gimmulf		Hi, my computer crashes completely when computer tries to use opengl, just by typing glxgears my screen freaks out system freezes and i have to reeboot by the powerbutton. Any ideas on how to solve this?
2006-01-18T08:06:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	what video card?
2006-01-18T08:13:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	what's your video card?
2006-01-18T08:14:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	problem 1 is probably just this:
2006-01-18T08:15:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	restart stops X, and along with it, it stops your restart process. Try restarting gdm from the text console instead.
2006-01-18T08:16:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	yes, unless you mean the gnome-terminal program.
2006-01-18T08:17:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	well, that's the behaviour I would expect.
2006-01-18T08:17:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	do you know you can switch to a text console with Ctrl-Alt-F1 and log in there?
2006-01-18T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	try Ctrl-Alt-F1. You can get back to X with Ctrl-Alt-F7
2006-01-18T08:24:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	I think this is a problem with the ATI driver -- I don't have a text console any more, either.
2006-01-18T08:31:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	to prove this, you could run 'gdm restart' through 'at'
2006-01-18T08:43:00.000Z	gimmulf	soundray	 didnt work :(, also tried restarting network after first reboot. Before i restarted network ping ftp.xxx.com gave me nothing itwas just waiting but after i had restarted the network it sad unknown host when i tried the same ping again
2006-01-18T08:46:00.000Z	gimmulf	soundray	 should i reinstall my system maybe, cant i just reinstall X and try that?
2006-01-18T08:47:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	I doubt that reinstalling will solve your problem/
2006-01-18T08:47:00.000Z	gimmulf	soundray	maybe i shoud reinstall the whole system then :(
2006-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	if you want to reinstall X, that would be done with 'apt-get --reinstall install xserver-xorg'
2006-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	do you know about X log files?
2006-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	gimmulf	soundray	 yes
2006-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	so nothing helpful there?
2006-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	gimmulf	soundray	 not a single error
2006-01-18T08:50:00.000Z	gimmulf	soundray	 can i renstall X while in X
2006-01-18T08:50:00.000Z	soundray	gimmulf	yes, should be no problem.
