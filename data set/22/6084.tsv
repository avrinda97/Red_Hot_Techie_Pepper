2009-01-18T22:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tvgv	i'm sure there are, i'm not familiar w/ them though
2009-01-18T22:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tvgv	i disabled that stupid "control panel" GUI, so i just used normal themes from gnome-look.org

2009-01-18T22:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tvgv	i sold my asus and bought an Aspire One.. but hte asus is a fine PC, i just didn't like the SSD
