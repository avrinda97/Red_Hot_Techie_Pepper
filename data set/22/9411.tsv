2008-06-04T01:29:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	are the drivers installed and working?
2008-06-04T01:30:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	are the drivers installed and working?
2008-06-04T01:30:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	ok I give up you rather argue
2008-06-04T01:31:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	reset the router
2008-06-04T01:31:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	so the drivers are installed and working?
2008-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	what happens when you try and connect?>
2008-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	sounds like you put in the wrong key
2008-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	doublecheck
2008-06-04T01:33:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	completely remove all drivers and wireless support and reinstall
2008-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	then reset router to default settings
2008-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	see if connects and go from there
2008-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	start from scratch and build back up
2008-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	k
2008-06-04T01:35:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	right click on the packages and hit completely remove so it purges configurations
2008-06-04T01:36:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	search for wifi wireless and networking and remove them then do the same and add them
2008-06-04T01:36:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	this way it purges any configuration which might be messing it up
2008-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	disciple	KaKoRoT	you are in a position where its easier to start fresh than hunt down the configuration problem
