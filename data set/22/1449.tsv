2010-05-25T05:31:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	trying...
2010-06-08T03:33:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	you can't just add that to your xorg.conf ?
2010-06-08T03:34:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	no it all breaks
2010-06-08T03:34:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	with what error? pastie it
2010-06-08T03:35:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	I only see one monitor
2010-06-08T03:36:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	... well there was another
2010-06-08T03:36:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	I see a twinview option but -- you never define the other monitor with the twinview?
2010-06-08T03:37:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	http://pastie.org/995707
2010-06-08T03:39:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	it looks like after it loads multitouch, it loads mouse9
2010-06-08T03:39:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	umm, I'm not seeing an error in there
2010-06-08T03:40:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	here's another log
2010-06-08T03:40:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	ok cool, got the xorg.conf to go with that?
2010-06-08T03:41:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	what happened was when i tried to move my mouse back from the external monitor it wouldn't let me
2010-06-08T03:41:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	unless I can see the error log with the error in it and the conf file that generated it I doubt I can help you
2010-06-08T03:42:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	you think i should just append that and it should word. but doesn't twinview only hook into Mouse0
2010-06-08T03:42:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	?
2010-06-08T03:42:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	I need the conf file that generated that error
2010-06-08T03:45:00.000Z	Maletor	blue_anna	i guess what I'm trying to say is what does identifier do in xorg.conf
2010-06-08T03:47:00.000Z	blue_anna	Maletor	InputClass defines a general specification for a variety of devices, each taht normally want to define their own INput section, that all match the spec -- I think it's purpose was to allow people to define a general class for like Wacom tablet for example...
