2011-02-28T21:35:00.000Z	farhad		hi, i use ubuntu. i can't ping my wifi printer from my laptop (my laptop is connected at the same wireless net). but i can ping the printer from my fixed hosts (fixed=with eth cable). is there anyone who has some idea?
2011-02-28T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	can you ping the router?
2011-02-28T21:36:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	yep
2011-02-28T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	is the printer IP in the same subnet as the rest of the network?
2011-02-28T21:37:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-02-28T21:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	can you tracerote to the IP?
2011-02-28T21:38:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	from what host?
2011-02-28T21:44:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	ping
2011-02-28T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	from the wireless system...
2011-02-28T21:57:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	uh?
2011-02-28T21:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	install traceroute from the repos and you can run:  traceroute ip.address.of.printer
2011-02-28T22:02:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	traceroute to 192.168.1.50 (192.168.1.50), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
2011-02-28T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	please use a pastebin in furture
2011-02-28T22:04:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	ok, however pina-laptop can't see the printer
2011-02-28T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	could try setting a route to the IP manually, see if it helps some#
2011-02-28T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	try: sudo route add -host 192.168.1.50 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev wlan0
2011-02-28T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	assuming wlan0 is the wireless device
2011-02-28T22:11:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	i will try
2011-02-28T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	that tells the OS to use your wireless device to reach the printer
2011-02-28T22:12:00.000Z	farhad	ActionParsnip	there is an error on the syntax
2011-02-28T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	farhad	dang
