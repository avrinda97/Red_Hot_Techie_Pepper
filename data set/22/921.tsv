2011-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	fmax30		what am i doing wrong here ?
2011-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	fmax30		http://paste.ubuntu.com/559799/
2011-01-29T12:50:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	there's spaces in ssid but in your line there is not, shouldn't there be?
2011-01-29T12:51:00.000Z	fmax30	gobbe	it doesnt accept spaces from me
2011-01-29T12:51:00.000Z	fmax30		the command doesnt execute , i have space in my essid
2011-01-29T12:51:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	what does it say?
2011-01-29T12:52:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	and did you use it like essid "The Dark Side"
2011-01-29T12:52:00.000Z	fmax30		yes
2011-01-29T12:52:00.000Z	fmax30		if i do that well my essid is set to off/any
2011-01-29T12:53:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	anyway using spaces in ssid is not good idea :-)
2011-01-29T12:53:00.000Z	fmax30		so should i change it from my ap ?
2011-01-29T12:53:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	i would go and do that
2011-01-29T12:53:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	because now your ubuntu is connected to ap but using different ssid
2011-01-29T12:54:00.000Z	fmax30		one more thing
2011-01-29T12:54:00.000Z	fmax30		i am connected to my ap at the moment using the network manager app
2011-01-29T12:55:00.000Z	fmax30		if i do a iwconfig eth1 , it shows my essid as "The Dark Side", when there is no way to set it to that specific ssid using console
2011-01-29T12:56:00.000Z	fmax30		*Terminal
2011-01-29T12:56:00.000Z	gobbe		yep, that's what i told, The Dark Side and TheDarkSIde are not same thing
2011-01-29T12:56:00.000Z	gobbe		but is there specific reason why you want to do it from terminal and not to use network manager?
2011-01-29T12:57:00.000Z	fmax30	gobbe	: well when i boot into tty mode, using the terminal is the only way
2011-01-29T12:57:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	that's true
2011-01-29T12:57:00.000Z	gobbe	fmax30	so if you can, change the ssid from your ap
