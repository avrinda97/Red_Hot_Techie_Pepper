2010-06-03T03:53:00.000Z	MikeH_		Anyone on the grub2 issue? I just get a flashing cursor...
2010-06-03T03:55:00.000Z	MikeH_		Surely I'm not the only person who has had this issue with grub? I've had it on two machines now?
2010-06-03T03:56:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	you're not alone
2010-06-03T03:56:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	Thats good to know, I'm getting quite frustrated trying to google for it.
2010-06-03T03:56:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	not to suggest for a second that I actually have a solution...
2010-06-03T03:56:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	Is there a fix anywhere? Perhaps instructions on how to install original grub?
2010-06-03T03:57:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	"grub legacy"  and yes you can use that instead of grub2
2010-06-03T03:57:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	see the link I sent.
2010-06-03T03:58:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	I have no idea what parts of those documents are relevant to removing grub2 and installing original grub.
2010-06-03T03:59:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	i'm ALMOST certain that installing legacy will kill grub 2.  wait one and i'll track the tutorial
2010-06-03T04:03:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	Any luck in finding that tutorial?
2010-06-03T04:04:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	seeking the right one
2010-06-03T04:05:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	ok heres a tutorial.  But unless you have a very compelling reason, suggest you stick with grub2
2010-06-03T04:05:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	Is not booting inside half hour a compelling enough reason?
2010-06-03T04:06:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	only mean i'd try to fix grub2 before I went backwards to a no longer supported package
2010-06-03T04:06:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	please restate problem/details of your grub issues
2010-06-03T04:06:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	Two things, there seems to be no information on the issues with grub2, and that link you pasted, as grateful as I am, only explains how to restore grub in a release that ships with grub-legacy.
2010-06-03T04:07:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	I turn the machine on, I get a flashing cursor for an indeterminate amount of time
2010-06-03T04:07:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	dual booting?  wubi?  what kind of machine?  what ubuntu version?
2010-06-03T04:08:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	No dual boot, 10.4 server, machine is an Atom box, but the same happened to my ML110 (P4)
2010-06-03T04:09:00.000Z	acerimmer_	MikeH_	troubleshooting mode.  Did you checksum your iso?
2010-06-03T04:10:00.000Z	MikeH_	acerimmer_	No, but the chances of two different iso's being corrupt two weeks apart downloaded on different machines delivered by different media?
