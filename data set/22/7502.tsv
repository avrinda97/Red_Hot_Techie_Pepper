2012-08-26T12:32:00.000Z	trent		Hello, can someone tell me why whenever I drag my Skype icon to my desktop. It shows up as a configuration file instead?
2012-08-26T12:34:00.000Z	trent		I think Ubuntu hates me.

2012-08-26T12:46:00.000Z	trent	gogeta	does LXDE have a wireless desktop icon? If not how do I connect to my wireless? I can't figure it out without being on Xfce
