2006-09-10T06:14:00.000Z	stefg	holycow	you can apt-get (after you enabled universe)
2006-09-10T06:16:00.000Z	holycow	stefg	please dude, i'm not a fucking noob
2006-09-10T06:18:00.000Z	stefg	holycow	so it's the the installer can't get the actual plugin from the macromedia-site? Should be a temporary problem
2006-09-10T06:18:00.000Z	holycow	stefg	oh my god
2006-09-10T06:19:00.000Z	holycow	stefg	i appreciate you are trying to help and that is graciously accepted.  i thank you.
2006-09-10T06:19:00.000Z	stefg	holycow	i'm too modest to accept being called your god :-)
2006-09-10T06:19:00.000Z	holycow	stefg	i humbly submit that you might consider not comming to conclusions ... i assure you this problem has existed at this particular connection with shaw for 1 year or more, and it only applies to the macromedia servers
2006-09-10T06:28:00.000Z	stefg	holycow	so to help you normalize your breathing you'd need the flash7 installer .tgz dcc'ed, or what?

2006-09-23T15:57:00.000Z	holycow	stefg	lol, i'm not getting what the punchline is here
2006-09-23T15:57:00.000Z	stefg	holycow	read your pm-tab
