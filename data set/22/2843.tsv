2009-02-14T17:50:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	his grub is still there, its just failing to load xp partion
2009-02-14T17:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	then look into the menu.lst
2009-02-14T17:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	and check whether the UUID's in there are proper or not
2009-02-14T17:51:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	Ah perhaps the uuid is the problem
2009-02-14T17:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	and ya the root too :)
2009-02-14T17:54:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	hopefully you guys can see something i missed. by default the settings he showed me looked correct.
2009-02-14T18:03:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	how will that allow him access to the xp partition?
2009-02-14T18:03:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	i didnt know that he wants to boot into XP...
2009-02-14T18:03:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	oh sorry, basicly the problem is that its showing an device error when he attempts to boot to xp
2009-02-14T18:04:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	note he said the installed xp after ubuntu, would that effect the boot.ini file for xp?
2009-02-14T18:05:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	no not at all....
2009-02-14T18:07:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	the ideals i tried with him were to change rootnoverify to root, also tried to remove makeactive, and adjusted the chainloader +1 to chainloader (hd0,4)+1 none of them seemed to work
2009-02-14T18:07:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	did you make him re-install grub?
2009-02-14T18:07:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	thats when you stepped in :)
2009-02-14T18:08:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	so no not yet.
2009-02-14T18:08:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	oh ok... :)
2009-02-14T18:18:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	to recap, you had him designate his ubuntu as root, then had him run setup(hd0) to reinstall grub?
2009-02-14T18:18:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	ya... because the MBR resides at the first boot sector of the drive
2009-02-14T18:18:00.000Z	illumin8	arvind_khadri	thanks, ill note that for future refrence :)
2009-02-14T18:19:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	illumin8	its ok :)
