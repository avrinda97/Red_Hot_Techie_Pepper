2006-06-20T11:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	not a good idea to use debian repos in Ubuntu
2006-06-20T11:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	which server is giving the problem?
2006-06-20T11:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	hmm.. not sure. wait a bit and try again, there may be some maintainence going on or something
2006-06-20T11:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	that's a default timestamp
2006-06-20T11:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	does your sources.list have "us." in front of some repos?
2006-06-20T11:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	you changed them?
2006-06-20T11:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	oh, ok
2006-06-20T11:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	that might help
2006-06-20T11:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	that's not good
2006-07-12T10:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	that can be easily changed :)
2009-12-17T08:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	iirc,  you can update to karmic from the alternate cd
2009-12-17T08:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	Some_Person	I don't think so
