2008-05-04T14:24:00.000Z	cashmoney		Hey guys, I just installed ubuntu server 6.06, and I was wondering how I go about finding available packages within the console via putty?
2008-05-04T14:25:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	apt-cache search foo
2008-05-04T14:25:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	don't forget to apt-get update first, though
2008-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	cashmoney	brunner	I wanted to try and install a webmail server
2008-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	a "webmail server"?
2008-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	you mean a webserver and a PHP script that allows people to check their mail via the web?
2008-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	cashmoney	brunner	indeed
2008-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	or is there a mail server that comes with a webserver built in now?
2008-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	so start with the webserver
2008-05-04T14:27:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	have you installed a webserver?
2008-05-04T14:28:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	http://php.resourceindex.com/

2008-05-04T14:29:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	the top result, SquirrelMail, is pretty good, I think
2008-05-04T14:30:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	why do you need a package for a PHP script?
2008-05-04T14:31:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	just download it and put it into your web root
2008-05-04T14:31:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	which by default is somewhere in /var
2008-05-04T14:39:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	what says not found?
2008-05-04T14:39:00.000Z	brunner	cashmoney	paste the exact message
