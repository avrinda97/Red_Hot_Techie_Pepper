2011-11-30T23:50:00.000Z	cristipiticul		I'm now running on Windows
2011-11-30T23:50:00.000Z	cristipiticul		is this the right place to ask?
2011-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	cristipiticul		okay
2011-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	cristipiticul		I don't know if this might help, but...
2011-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	cristipiticul		yesterday it worked all fine
2011-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	cristipiticul		today, when I first started it
2011-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	cristipiticul		it seemed ok too
2011-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	cristipiticul		but it took about 10-20 seconds to save a small text file
2011-11-30T23:53:00.000Z	cristipiticul		okay, sorry. So ... let's get to the end... finally, hotkeys wouldn't work. ALT + TAB or shifting workspaces didn't work at all. When I put the mouse in the top of the screen, the buttons (X, maximize, minimize) didn't show up
2011-11-30T23:54:00.000Z	cristipiticul		I pressed CTRL+ALT+DEL and it gave me an error. I didn't know what to do so I've restarted the pc from the PC button. After that, it got stuck before the login screen
2011-11-30T23:54:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	was the gui jerky?
2011-11-30T23:56:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	so you are describing a number of issues from the initial boot to the point where you were interacting with gui (graphical programs). it would help us to know the first symptom of trouble
2011-11-30T23:56:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	so when you are booting what was the first thing that went wrong? the black rectangle on the plymouth screen (the purple screen)
2011-11-30T23:59:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	what did you update? do you know?
2011-11-30T23:59:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	was it a big update or a little one?
2011-12-01T00:00:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	ok. if you have a livecd or liveusb I would like you to boot that
2011-12-01T00:01:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	you are in windows. can you make one?
2011-12-01T00:03:00.000Z	cristipiticul	escott	is the ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso good enough for usb boot?
2011-12-01T00:03:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	sure thats fine
2011-12-01T00:03:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	ideally one that matches the version you are running, but its not too particular
2011-12-01T00:05:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	i need to sign-off, but someone else can help you once you have the livecd working. let them know you that you are having booting problems after some smaller updates. they can take you through some debugging steps. i would recommend an fsck, and then pull your apt logs from the ubuntu partition to figure out what was updated
2011-12-01T00:06:00.000Z	escott	cristipiticul	goodluck
