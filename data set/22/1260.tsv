2010-07-26T03:01:00.000Z	Number6	erUSUL	now I'm in grub menu, but somehow my arrow keys don't react anymore...:(
2010-07-26T03:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Number6	then try from a livecd
2010-07-26T03:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Number6	the grub2 page has a step by step on how to do it ( the part about recovering grub )
2010-07-26T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Number6	if it is mounted for the normal user it is mounted for all users
2010-07-26T03:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Number6	use « gksudo nautilus » handle with care a rooted file manager is a weapon of mass destruction
2010-07-26T03:16:00.000Z	Number6	erUSUL	thank you my friend
2010-07-26T03:18:00.000Z	Number6	erUSUL	this way doesn't show me the ubuntu-disk. If I open nautilus as a normal user, than I do see the ubuntu-disk!
2010-07-26T03:18:00.000Z	Number6	erUSUL	on cmd-line mode I don't know how to do that
2010-07-26T03:18:00.000Z	Number6	erUSUL	I mean I don't know how to mount to my ubuntu-disk
2010-07-26T03:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	Number6	« gksudo nautilus /mount/point/of/ubuntu/disk »
2010-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	Number6	erUSUL	the problem is I don't know how to mount to ubuntu-disk. As a normal user Nautilus somehow magiacally shows me the ubuntu-disk\
2010-07-26T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Number6	see the output of the mount command
2010-07-26T03:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Number6	no problem; all solved now ?
2010-07-26T03:31:00.000Z	Number6	erUSUL	actionParsnip , another problem arise! Somehow GRUB is now showing the menu, but my keyboard doesn't react in this menu.
