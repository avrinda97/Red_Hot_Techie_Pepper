2008-05-12T08:36:00.000Z	V_invisible		can some one tell me how to set up file sharing on ubuntu hardy
2008-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	right click a folder you want to share... and choose "Sharing <whatever>" ... when that's done, come back.
2008-05-12T08:38:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	yep done that
2008-05-12T08:39:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	It installed Samba for you?
2008-05-12T08:39:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	i have samba installed already but dont know how to work it
2008-05-12T08:39:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	You should have gotten an error at this point so far though... once you've seen the error about no permissions, then tell me again  :)
2008-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	ok... sudo gedit /etc/group ... there is a group 'sambashare' ... add your username after the last : in that line
2008-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	then save and log out and back in... then try the share again... now it should work  :)
2008-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	its already there :/
2008-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	that's all I did, and it's working for me.....
2008-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	You logged out and back in since installing samba?
2008-05-12T08:42:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	yeah i ve done that before...still the same :(
2008-05-12T08:43:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	I have no idea why something would work here, but not for you... using the exact same setup and exact same package versions.
2008-05-12T08:49:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	well it used to work before i upgraded to hardy...and i cant connect to the windows work group computers either...even if i cant share my own files
2008-05-12T08:53:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	er sorry man...but i gotta ask again...how can i access other windows network computers on my network
2008-05-12T08:53:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	Places > Network > Windows Network > Should list computers or your local network
2008-05-12T08:54:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	thats the thing...theres nothing when i enter the windows network
2008-05-12T08:55:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	Mine shows at least my box... because it's turned on...
2008-05-12T08:56:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	i know for sure theres atleast one other windows box turned on right now...but doesnt show...and i setup the network on it myself...it worked before, but its not there anymore. It appears when i enter the network from another windows computer. :((
2008-05-12T08:57:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	you can try going through /etc/samba/smb.conf ... or read man smb.conf ... it should be working via the GUI though  :/
2008-05-12T09:00:00.000Z	fde	V_invisible	ahhh... here, if I change it to a workgroup other than "WORKGROUP" it breaks stuff it seems...
2008-05-12T09:01:00.000Z	V_invisible	fde	i ll try that thanks for trying mate :)
