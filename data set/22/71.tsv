2012-08-27T06:50:00.000Z	ciscbro		Hello, I am in the /dev folder trying to figure out how ubuntu sees the 4 usb ports on my dell laptop. I am trying to mount a usb to serial cable to a usb port so I can connect the console port of a cisco router - any guidance?
2012-08-27T06:50:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	usb to serial?
2012-08-27T06:50:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	just use screen
2012-08-27T06:50:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	you don't mount anything
2012-08-27T06:50:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	I'm assuming it's a PL2303 chipset
2012-08-27T06:50:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	so just do screen /dev/ttyUSB0
2012-08-27T06:51:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	this works because it sees the serial connection and uses it like a PTY
2012-08-27T06:53:00.000Z	ciscbro	trevorj	thank you for the pointers, I received a message "sorry could not find a pty"
2012-08-27T06:53:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	sudo
2012-08-27T06:53:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	or add yourself to the proper group
2012-08-27T06:55:00.000Z	ciscbro	trevorj	awesome! thank you. I am going through the linux command line publication and just got to the permissions portion. This was sort of an emergency thing, you are the best
2012-08-27T06:55:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	np!
2012-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	you can also use minicom or gtkterm
2012-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	but screen is just so nice and easy ;)
2012-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	ciscbro	trevorj	on a sidenote, I'm just learning linux and how the kernal works. I'm running bohdi which is ubuntu based and I have a generic VBox with an XP client.
2012-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	ciscbro	trevorj	but the Vbox doesn't recognize any of my usb ports
2012-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	install the extras package
2012-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	ciscbro	trevorj	yeah, I am astonished at how awesome screen is
2012-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	it's proprietary crap in my opinion
2012-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	trevorj	ciscbro	kvm is nice too ;)
2012-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	ciscbro	trevorj	well I don't even need it now that you've shared screen
2012-08-27T07:16:00.000Z	ciscbro	trevorj	you meant VBox is proprietary junk right?
