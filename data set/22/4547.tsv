2010-02-22T01:34:00.000Z	elliotjhug		Hi, I'm having trouble getting my notify-osd popups displaying correctly - I'm only getting old-style yellow notifications, not the nice new ones. Compiz + Nvidia is all setup correctly - so any ideas?
2010-02-22T01:35:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	What nice new ones? AFAIK, the ones in karmic are still the yellow ones
2010-02-22T01:37:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	No, karmic has notify-osd and should show passive notifications
2010-02-22T01:37:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	I have another machine next to me running karmic with notifications
2010-02-22T01:38:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	Well, that's news to me. Maybe you need to do updates? check sys>admin>software sources>updates
2010-02-22T01:41:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	Thanks for suggestion, but I have the latest updates (new notifications have been in ubuntu since the late jaunty alphas btw)
2010-02-22T01:41:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	Well it's odd it's not working for you then.
2010-02-22T01:42:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	I don't know what the new ones look like, but AFAIK, I still have the old ones
2010-02-22T01:42:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	what version of ubuntu are you running on then?
2010-02-22T01:42:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	I'm referring to my karmic installs
2010-02-22T01:43:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	purely for my own investigations - what graphics card you got in those?
2010-02-22T01:44:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	I have four pcs, one hardy, one jaunty, one karmic, one gentoo/karmic dual boot. One card is so old it can't run compiz, the karmic one is nvidia, jaunty is intel, the gentoo/karmic one is radeon
2010-02-22T01:44:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	But, I have a feeling it's not graphic card or compiz related
2010-02-22T01:44:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	Can you provide screenshots of the new and old notifications?
2010-02-22T01:45:00.000Z	elliotjhug		new notifications are http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/265 old ones are http://bit.ly/cvz9AU
2010-02-22T01:48:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	Did you get those links or did they get flooded out? (sorry for the bitly link but its a long url)
2010-02-22T01:49:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	Ahhh, those notifications...
2010-02-22T01:49:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	yea I get those on my karmic boxes as well as my jaunty one
2010-02-22T01:49:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	ah fair enough
2010-02-22T01:49:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	I wonder if there's some switch you have to flip..
2010-02-22T01:49:00.000Z	soreau	elliotjhug	Perhaps, it is a gconf key setting?
2010-02-22T01:50:00.000Z	elliotjhug	soreau	I'm gonna be dissapearing for a mo - thanks for confirming they work on nvidia though - narrows my search a little (and I'll look into the gconf idea)
