2010-04-30T22:21:00.000Z	no-go		chill: deleting it thru software centre and installing it refuses to install
2010-04-30T22:21:00.000Z	Loshki	no-go	skype doesn't work for me either. Sound issues, as usual. No playback or recording it seems...
2010-04-30T22:22:00.000Z	no-go	Loshki	it quites after pressing the enter button
2010-04-30T22:22:00.000Z	no-go	Loshki	remove via software centre and reinstall seemed best to me
2010-04-30T22:22:00.000Z	Loshki	no-go	mine stays up and I can dial the echo server, but no sound apart from a few press button noises...
2010-04-30T22:23:00.000Z	Loshki	no-go	did it fix the problem?

2010-04-30T22:24:00.000Z	Loshki	no-go	There truly isn't a supported version of skype for i386? Astounding?
2010-04-30T22:25:00.000Z	no-go	Loshki	not according to software centre in Lucid
2010-04-30T22:25:00.000Z	no-go	Loshki	could install all other skype progs in Lucid
2010-04-30T22:25:00.000Z	Loshki	no-go	well, it is 3rd. party software. Is there anything on skype's own site?
