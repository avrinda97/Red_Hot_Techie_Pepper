2007-09-26T12:08:00.000Z	sakitram		I do not have a blank CD.  So I choosed this method.
2007-09-26T12:10:00.000Z	sakitram		Ubunty installation.   Now I am at partition disk dialog box, it is waiting for my input?
2007-09-26T12:11:00.000Z	Element14	sakitram	actually have you configured qemu to use any "virtual" harddisk at all?
2007-09-26T12:12:00.000Z	sakitram		I do not know.  Actually I used the following two commands.
2007-09-26T12:12:00.000Z	sakitram		  qemu-img create -f qcow ubuntu.img 3G
2007-09-26T12:12:00.000Z	sakitram		  qemu -cdrom /mnt/backup/ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso -boot d -m 96 ubuntu.img
2007-09-26T12:12:00.000Z	Element14		seems right.
2007-09-26T12:13:00.000Z	Element14		use the whole harddisk then, if it doesn't give any errors....
2007-09-26T12:13:00.000Z	sakitram		In Partition hardisk dialog box, I choosed "Manual", and now I see the only following hard disk.   "IDE1 master (hda) - 3.1 GB QEMU HARDISK"
2007-09-26T12:13:00.000Z	sakitram		?
2007-09-26T12:14:00.000Z	Element14	sakitram	yea that's it
2007-09-26T12:15:00.000Z	sakitram	Element14	then how it will be installed to the hard disk partition where I wish to be installed and can my Ubuntu be booted from there?
2007-09-26T12:15:00.000Z	Element14	sakitram	actually i'm not a ubuntu guy :)
2007-09-26T12:16:00.000Z	Element14		but if there's no problem with using the entire harddisk... why not?
2007-09-26T12:16:00.000Z	sakitram		yes, but if it suppose delete my hard disk files, it would be wrong.
2007-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	Element14	sakitram	it shouldn't. unless you got data in your newly created 3GB file....
2007-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	sakitram		already I choosed use Entire hard disk.  Now I am at the dialog window telling  "Note all data in the selected hard disk will be erased...."
2007-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	sakitram		So I am little afraid of proceeding from there.
2007-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	sakitram	Element14	anyhow thanks for reply.
2007-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	Element14		np
2007-09-26T12:18:00.000Z	sakitram		Anybody else confirm that what is going on?
2007-09-26T12:18:00.000Z	Element14	sakitram	it will just wipe out the data INSIDE your 3GB file...
