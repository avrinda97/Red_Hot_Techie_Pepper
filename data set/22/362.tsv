2011-11-18T12:32:00.000Z	xruud		Ubuntu does not start my keyboard nor mouse. I do have a serial connection using minicom. Anything I can do to fix the mouse+key problem?
2011-11-18T12:34:00.000Z	xruud		By the looks of it the ports do not have power; the keyboard is wireless and normally the transmitter has a led on
2011-11-18T12:34:00.000Z	xruud		Just some basic wired usb mouse
2011-11-18T12:34:00.000Z	xruud		both usb
2011-11-18T12:35:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	are the ports built in to the mobo, or are they on a daughter card
2011-11-18T12:38:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	sudo mkdir /mnt/asdf;sudo mount -t auto /dev/device /mnt/asdf
2011-11-18T12:44:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	try "cat boot.scr". if it looks fine, then use "nano boot.scr"
2011-11-18T12:45:00.000Z	xruud	fizyplankton	it looks weird. Is that utf-8?'V�8;NN��J$|
2011-11-18T12:46:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	im using a irc client with plain 7bit ascii encoding. if its not on your keyboard, i cant see it.
2011-11-18T12:46:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	it may be a binary
2011-11-18T12:47:00.000Z	xruud	fizyplankton	this is what nano shows: '^E^YV�8;NN��J^@^@^A$^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@|�^@o^E^B^F^@Ubuntu boot script
2011-11-18T12:48:00.000Z	xruud	fizyplankton	can such files be edited with any other editor? Or shold it be fine even in GEdit. Provided I only change parts I can read
2011-11-18T12:48:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	i have no idea. i would try going into root then editing the file. you knever know
2011-11-18T12:49:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	bad idea
2011-11-18T12:50:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	the only times you should ever sudo -i or su is if there is if there is no practical way to sudo-(^i).
2011-11-18T12:51:00.000Z	xruud	fizyplankton	No ideao what you are talking about. I was just editing the file with the root user because I can't edit it otherwise
2011-11-18T12:52:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	anyways. i have 2 projects, a paper, and a book to read before school starts in 3 hours. so why am i on irc? beats me
2011-11-18T12:52:00.000Z	xruud	fizyplankton	your help is appreciated, I just did not understand the last part ;)
2011-11-18T12:53:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	sudo will execute the next command as root. sudo -i and su will both log you in as the root user. those are more permanent than  sudo
2011-11-18T12:54:00.000Z	fizyplankton	xruud	make SURE to make a backup
2011-11-18T12:54:00.000Z	xruud	fizyplankton	Aaah, that's what you meant
2011-11-18T12:54:00.000Z	xruud	fizyplankton	I have like three backups
