2009-04-24T03:21:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Try the vesa video driver? if not anything else, just to start X
2009-04-24T03:21:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	thanks, I'll try to find it now )
2009-07-17T01:27:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Using gnome, you can disable compiz by starting gnome's default window manager with 'metacity --replace'
2009-07-17T01:30:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	What are you trying to accomplish here?
2009-07-17T01:30:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	It was me
2009-07-17T01:30:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	cant start my X, was playing around with compiz, and now I get a black screen with the mouse pointer in the middle
2009-07-17T01:31:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	how can I disable compiz, and maybe some themes, from the recovery-mode terminal? )
2009-07-17T01:32:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Jusr chmod -x it and then run metacity when you get X up (assuming compiz is causing some kind of problem for you)
2009-07-17T01:32:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	but I have already removed compiz by apt-get remove ) is that okay?
2009-07-17T01:34:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Sure, but I still don't know what you're ultimately trying to accomplish here
2009-07-17T03:55:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Do your windows even have borders?
2009-07-17T03:56:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Start 'metacity --replace'
2009-07-17T03:57:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	oh, good idea :) let me try it..
2009-07-17T03:59:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Probably not. If you can open gconf-editor, navigate to desktop>gnome>session>required_components>windowmanager and make sure it is set to metacity
2009-07-17T04:00:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	sec
2009-07-17T04:00:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	and another stupid question.. where do I open gconf-editor? :)
2009-07-17T04:01:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	From Alt+F2
2009-07-17T04:02:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	thanks :)
2009-07-17T04:03:00.000Z	progre55	soreau	thank you so much! appreciate!!
2009-07-17T20:16:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Not sure, did you fix whatever it was you were trying to?
2010-12-17T17:30:00.000Z	soreau	progre55	Ask in #windows
