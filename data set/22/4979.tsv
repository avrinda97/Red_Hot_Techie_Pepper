2007-10-04T07:41:00.000Z	Innomen		Seriously, where is the search files function?
2007-10-04T07:41:00.000Z	Innomen		i open the place menu and click computer
2007-10-04T07:41:00.000Z	Innomen		i click search, how do i tell it i want to find every instance of "crypt" on the system?
2007-10-04T07:42:00.000Z	Innomen		so there is no gui search either?
2007-10-04T07:44:00.000Z	Innomen		yur kidding, so for the record ubuntu does not ship with a gui way to search for a given file? i'm honestly asking because no one will tell me
2007-10-04T07:44:00.000Z	Innomen		and i will go get it
2007-10-04T07:44:00.000Z	Innomen		if someone tells me that i have to by answering what i just asked
2007-10-04T07:45:00.000Z	Innomen		but i know what you mean
2007-10-04T07:47:00.000Z	Innomen		again i ask, true or false, ubuntu does not ship with a gui way to search the machine for a given file.
2007-10-04T07:47:00.000Z	Innomen		i know that i can now go dl beagle
2007-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	Places>Search for Files. That simple. Or, Applications>Add/Remove, find Beagle, and click it. Both are very simple.
2007-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	just go to Places>Search for Files.
2007-10-04T07:49:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	Or, if you want to search inside the text of files, go to Add/Remove and install Beagle (it takes about 5 clicks to do)
2007-10-04T07:49:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	It should do that by default.
2007-10-04T07:50:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	Where is that tar.gz?
2007-10-04T07:51:00.000Z	Innomen	cdm10	desktop
2007-10-04T07:51:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	It can sometimes take a while to find the files, try giving it a minute.
2007-10-04T07:51:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	How are you searching for it? Places>Search for files?
2007-10-04T07:52:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	FIle System means the entire computer and connected drives.
2007-10-04T07:53:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	The thing is, most people intuitively figure it out. It's not a common enough question to add to ubotu, in my opinion.
2007-10-04T07:54:00.000Z	Innomen	cdm10	and that was the point of this whole thing, if ubuntu is going to really be popular, it needs to not make assumptions of skill. I worked in tech support for three years at my college, you learn to never assume a user knows something
2007-10-04T07:55:00.000Z	cdm10	Innomen	one last thing, you should try Beagle! It's pretty awesome.
