2008-11-01T22:45:00.000Z	bingungaja		hello, is it possible to grab files in the PC (same network) with ubuntu notebook ?
2008-11-01T22:46:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	yes, you can share a directory from your Windows machine and access it through Places-Connect to Server
2008-11-01T22:48:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	i'd make the folders in vista shared, then from nautilus, i go to the network and the PC, but can't find any files, why is that ?
2008-11-01T22:48:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	use Places-Connect to Server instead
2008-11-01T22:48:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	oh sorry, i try it first
2008-11-01T22:50:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	i don't have any server, just a router, what should i do ?
2008-11-01T22:51:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	the Windows machine becomes the server when you share a "folder" (directory)
2008-11-01T22:52:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	so if the shared file in f:/ , i just enter f:/ ?
2008-11-01T22:52:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	no. When you shared it, you gave the share a name. Use that.
2008-11-01T22:53:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	ok, let me try , thx for the clue
2008-11-01T22:56:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	in the service type, i choose windows share, then in the server i enter "multimedia" then it stated "cannot display smb://multimedia, No application is registered as handling this file
2008-11-01T22:57:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	is "multimedia" the network name of the Windows machine?
2008-11-01T22:58:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	yes, when i click share file in the windows explorer, i give name multimedia
2008-11-01T22:58:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	read my question carefully: is "multimedia" the network name of the Windows machine?
2008-11-01T22:59:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	wait a sec, i recheck first
2008-11-01T23:02:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	is network name in windows = network path ? if so, the network path is Hendri-pc/F
2008-11-01T23:03:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	no, what you enter under Server in that case is Hendri-PC (without the /F)
2008-11-01T23:04:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	i tried, with Hendri-pc, same error, but with Hendri-pc/F, it works, but asking for password ... what password ? i don't think i set a password for the sharing ......
2008-11-01T23:04:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	then set one
2008-11-01T23:05:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	u mean, i must set password in windows first ?
2008-11-01T23:05:00.000Z	soundray	bingungaja	yes
2008-11-01T23:06:00.000Z	bingungaja	soundray	ahh :) i tried my login password in the PC and it works !! :) thx so  much soundray, hope i can copy files now :)
