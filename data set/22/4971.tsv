2008-01-07T17:01:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	bet me to it :)
2008-06-22T12:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	These are graphical apps?
2008-06-22T12:48:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	yes
2008-06-22T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus/+bug/85118
2008-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	thanks will take a look
2008-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	also, for the record, always use gksu with graphical programs, not sudo.
2008-06-22T12:52:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	sure, but shouldn't it be gksudo?
2008-06-22T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	gksudo and gksu are the same thing
2008-06-22T12:53:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	ah sorry on my debian system they are different
2008-06-22T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	as of dapper (?) one is symlinked to the other
2008-06-22T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	that's caused by sudo vs gksudo, by the way
2008-06-22T12:55:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	hmm okay
2008-06-22T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	but, I'm not sure that's the cause (because I found that bug)
2008-08-28T14:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	azrael_valedhel: Feisty is supported through october
2008-08-28T14:28:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	thanks
2008-09-20T14:13:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	dammit, was about to say that :P
2008-09-20T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	no
2008-09-20T15:03:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	only alternate?
2008-09-20T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	well, I think gparted does, sure, but you can't isntall to them.
2008-09-20T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Ziroday	correct
2008-09-20T15:03:00.000Z	Ziroday	Flannel	thanks, have a great day
