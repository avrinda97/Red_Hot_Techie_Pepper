2009-10-03T22:41:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	ok
2009-10-03T22:42:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	go to the Applications Menu, and click on "Add/Remove Software" or something like that
2009-10-03T22:42:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	in there, you're going to make sure the dropdown on the top part of that program says "all free and open sources packages" or something like that
2009-10-03T22:42:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	then you're going to put "avant-window-navigator" in the search box
2009-10-03T22:43:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	from there on just double click and install.
2009-10-03T22:43:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	that will give you the Mac Like dock
2009-10-03T22:44:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	aptitude is a program you use in the console, with some parameters you search, install, remove packages. avant-window-navigator is a package. Under the console typing "aptitude install avant-window-navigator" you'll install that package.
2009-10-03T22:45:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	I don't really know, I use my desktop pretty simple, with some minor gl effects :P
2009-10-03T22:46:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	ok
2009-10-03T22:46:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	i'll give you something to play with.
2009-10-03T22:46:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	there's a package called simple-ccsm
2009-10-03T22:47:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	install "simple-ccsm"
2009-10-03T22:47:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	that will add a the compiz configuration settings manager under the System -- Preferences  menu
2009-10-03T22:49:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	np, there's some really fun plugins there.
2009-10-03T22:49:00.000Z	Exodus	heavenrider	the trick is binding the right plugins on the right keys.
