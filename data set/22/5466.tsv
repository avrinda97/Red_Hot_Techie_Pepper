2007-04-27T06:45:00.000Z	bloodskin		is it possible to install ubuntu without any removable media devices at all?
2007-04-27T06:45:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	yes
2007-04-27T06:45:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	you can install it from a chroot environment
2007-04-27T06:47:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	if you already have linux installed you can set up the partition and use debootstrap to set up a chroot environment and install it that way. it is also possible to dump the contents of an iso to your hdd and boot the kernel/initrd from grub and launch the installer that way
2007-04-27T06:48:00.000Z	bloodskin	eck	can you dumb it down for me?
2007-04-27T06:48:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	see this https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/linux-upgrade.html
2007-04-27T06:49:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	of course it is a bit more work than using the install cd
2007-04-27T06:50:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	no, you partition some space and then the debootstrap program downloads the .debs and installs them into the space you gave it
2007-04-27T06:51:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	it only installs a minimal system which is maybe 1 GB or so
2007-04-27T06:52:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	if you had to you could install into that space and then reclaim the space from your debian install by mounting it as /usr or /home or something later on
2007-04-27T06:54:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	is there a reason that you wouldn't install from a cd using the usual method?
2007-04-27T06:55:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	it might be easier for you if you install with the netboot method then
2007-04-27T06:56:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	if you want to i'll walk you through it, but you would be installing over the debian install completely
2007-04-27T06:56:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	no, you can do it without any external media
2007-04-27T06:58:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	download hte iso
2007-04-27T06:59:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	then mount it and you should see a kernel and initrd in it
2007-04-27T07:01:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	after you do that you want to copy the kernel and initrd into /boot and then edit your menu.lst to have a grub entry that uses the kernel and initrd from the boot.iso that you copied
2007-04-27T07:01:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	then when you reboot you can select that entry and you will boot into the netinstall
2007-04-27T07:03:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	it is kind of hard to explain, but basically it's an environment where / is actually some other path on the system
2007-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	oh, to do the netboot trick you will need to have the kernel and initrd on a partition that you are not reformatting (so hopefully you have /boot as a separate partition)
2007-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	bloodskin	eck	is this what you just explained to mehttps://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/linux-upgrade.html
2007-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	eck	bloodskin	that is the chroot thing, which is different from netboot (they will both accomplish the same thing in the end though)
