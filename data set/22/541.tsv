2011-07-31T23:30:00.000Z	girlygirl_	tyler_d	Why? what error comes up
2011-07-31T23:30:00.000Z	tyler_d	girlygirl_	there is no error, the added source just does not show up after apt-get update
2011-07-31T23:31:00.000Z	girlygirl_	tyler_d	Does this apply to different ppa's or just one
2011-07-31T23:31:00.000Z	tyler_d	girlygirl_	no ppa's show up
2011-07-31T23:32:00.000Z	tyler_d	girlygirl_	if I find it and add it to sources.list then it works
