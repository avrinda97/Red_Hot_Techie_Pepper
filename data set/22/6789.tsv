2006-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	Zyfo		This fortune program "Wanda the fish" where can I find/open the source to this?
2006-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	it is likely a part of the gnome-panel.
2006-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	how can I "open it up"?
2006-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	I just want to see the source of it
2006-10-28T14:51:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	sudo apt-get source gnome-applets
2006-10-28T14:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	that is a guess, though.
2006-10-28T14:52:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	alright, will try anyway
2006-10-28T14:53:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	that is how you get the source of that package, and it sounds like the wanda would be somewhere in there.
2006-10-28T14:53:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	yeah
2006-10-29T17:21:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	we need to see the script
2006-10-29T17:22:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	http://todotxt.com/library/todo.sh/ It should work though, I didn't code it :P
2006-10-29T17:01:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	does cream produce a .java file in a directory somewhere on your system?
2006-10-30T17:01:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	yes, I've got a .java file, no idea how to compile it though. I typed "java <filename>" and it gave me: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:", I know this file works, since it did on WinXp
2006-10-30T17:01:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	javac <filename>
2006-10-30T17:02:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	no such command
2006-10-30T17:03:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	guess I need to dl smt, didn't find a package called javac, should I dl javacc?
2006-10-30T17:03:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	sun-java5-jdk
2006-10-30T17:03:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	ah, thought I had it, ty
2006-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	sorry to bother you again: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: AK06_12/java <- managed to compile now, though now I got that error, and I'm sure it worked on WinXP
2006-10-30T17:11:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	your program does not have a main method, so it can not be ran by itself.
2006-10-30T17:11:00.000Z	Zyfo	dabaR	right, weird, thanks, I'll go look for it then xD (bash.org worthy tbh)
2006-10-30T12:37:00.000Z	dabaR	Zyfo	close all synaptic add/remove programs, and aptitudes
