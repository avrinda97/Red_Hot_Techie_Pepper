2012-06-06T11:02:00.000Z	spellbreaker		Hello, I have a question, I hope someone can help me. I tried to google a solution, but there are different ones and I don't know which is correct. I simply need to add a device to the drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.c file and recompile the Kernel (12.04 LTS). Can someone give me a hint to the correct documentation?
2012-06-06T11:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	I don't think that can be described as "simply" what device are you having issues with?
2012-06-06T11:07:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	I just need to add an additional device&vendor ID ( USB_DEVICE Line), nothing else.
2012-06-06T11:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	what you probably need is a udev rule, what device are you trying to use?
2012-06-06T11:09:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	It's a USB Cable containing a CP210x USB->Serial "converter" chip from Silicon labs.
2012-06-06T11:12:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	I have never seen a usb->serial adapter that needed anything further than simply "plug it in". are you getting any errors or anything?
2012-06-06T11:13:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	It only shows up in lsusb, and the manufacturer told me that I have to add the vendor id and device id into the driver source, because they only manufactured the chip, but the IDs are from the reseller ( Eaton Industries ). The Driver CP210x.C is needed.
2012-06-06T11:14:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	If you look at the file there are dozens of USB_DEVICES defined already
2012-06-06T11:14:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	can you link us (or copy us) where they said that? I'm 99% sure all you need is a udev rule
2012-06-06T11:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	I'd be very leary of doing that without a proper explanation of *why*
2012-06-06T11:18:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	according to http://www.etheus.net/CP210x_Linux_Driver it's been in the kernel since version 2.6
2012-06-06T11:18:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	I don't know why. Because they are the Manufactureres of the CP210x Chips, and someone made a Linux driver, and simply that specific Vendor ID is missing.
2012-06-06T11:19:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	Only a Vendor/Device ID is missing in the Table inside the cp210x.c file.
2012-06-06T11:20:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	And thats why they said I should recompile the kernel, to update that "table".
2012-06-06T11:21:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	give me a second
2012-06-06T11:24:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	ok, so it looks like it's just the one module that needs to be recompiled, not the entire kernel.
2012-06-06T11:26:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	Can you give me some advice? Do I simply do a make in the drivers/usb/serial and then make install?
2012-06-06T11:27:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile
2012-06-06T11:28:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	you will also need to install the kernel headers and stuff. that site should give you some ideas (don't just follow it blindly as you'll end up recompiling the entire kernel, you only need the module recompiled)
2012-06-06T11:48:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	Thanks, I'll give it a try.
2012-06-06T11:49:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	spellbreaker	I think you need to add "ccp" to the end of the replace command (ex: "compiz --replace ccp") to preserve window decorations
2012-06-06T14:51:00.000Z	spellbreaker	DarwinSurvivor	Thanks again for your hints, works like a charm. /dev/ttyUSBx appears now when plugging in the Silicon Labs cable. Thx :)
