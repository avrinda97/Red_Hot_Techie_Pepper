2012-10-29T02:37:00.000Z	brandtone		the email had may use name which included my last name, which is not in her email address
2012-10-29T02:38:00.000Z	brandtone		 and the password was my paypal and ebay passord and the ending was my house alarm code
2012-10-29T02:38:00.000Z	brandtone		i do use it, but mostly gmail, but this came to her computer
2012-10-29T02:39:00.000Z	brandtone		yes
2012-10-29T02:39:00.000Z	brandtone		and my home alarm password at the end
2012-10-29T02:40:00.000Z	brandtone		 the end of my paypal password and ...
2012-10-29T02:40:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	I always suggest that you never enter that kind of information in a computer at all.. :\
2012-10-29T02:41:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	The company you get your alarm services from, they don't have some silly iPhone app, do they? :\
2012-10-29T02:45:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Let me try and understand the situation better. So, your wife has a public email such as Gmail/Yahoo and you use a program such as Thunderbird to get/send email, or do you use the web-interface (http://mail.google.com, for example) ??
2012-10-29T02:45:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	So, you use a desktop client like Thunderbird or the web-interface?
2012-10-29T02:47:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Okay.. So your wife recieved an email in her public gmail account, which she recieved with Thunderbird?
2012-10-29T02:49:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Now I'm even more confused LOL. So your wife did NOT recieve the email in a public email host like gmail, but instead of provided to you by your internet company?  :\
2012-10-29T02:50:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Also, your wife doesn't use Linux? Interesting! You're sure her Windows isn't infested with spyware that's been stealing her/your personal information? Sounds really fishy, Iunno mate :\
2012-10-29T02:52:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Alright.. So your Wife received an email in her public Yahoo email... That was supposedly sent from your sbcglobal email account provided by AT&T, which had sensitive information in it? :|
2012-10-29T02:53:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	my advice is to be cautious. I would guess her Windows system has been comprimised and a lot of information got stolen... I would start with things like PayPal and start changing yoru passwords (From a secure Linux system while that Windows machien is turned off or disconnected from your network)
2012-10-29T02:54:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	but honestly, change all your passwords. Even the password for your network, set by your router and make sure all Wireless security features are enabled, like encryption.
2012-10-29T02:57:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Well, there's no way to know 100% for sure, esp. with Windows. Your best bet is a fresh install. It's the safest, most sure way. You can try to manually clean it out but it's tedious and very easy to miss things :P
2012-10-29T03:06:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Do you have a Windows disk?
2012-10-29T03:09:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Well, does you or your wife play games on your computers?
2012-10-29T03:16:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	That doesn't make sense. How did you install Ubuntu on that machine?
2012-10-29T03:19:00.000Z	michealPW	brandtone	Nah don't feel bad. We all started somewhere, right? :)
