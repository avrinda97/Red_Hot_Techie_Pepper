2010-05-08T01:03:00.000Z	jamil_1		Hello, I am unable to update ubuntu from 9.10 to 10.04. I have tried few obvious options including mounting alternate CD ISO but of no use. Any help ?
2010-05-08T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	the recommended way is via the network
2010-05-08T01:04:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	but I dont get an option to upgrade when I use the update manager
2010-05-08T01:07:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	look into system/adminstration/software sources -- updates tab: at the bottom there is "show new .. releases": does that show "normal" ?
2010-05-08T01:08:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	yp
2010-05-08T01:09:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	then try (from CLI) sudo do-release-upgrade
2010-05-08T01:10:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	terminal says: checking for new ubuntu release No new release found
2010-05-08T01:11:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	what does lsb_release -a show?
2010-05-08T01:12:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	it says : No LSB modules are available.
2010-05-08T01:13:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	you forgot the -a
2010-05-08T01:14:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	no I have used the switch
2010-05-08T01:16:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	no - my command shows http://paste.ubuntu.com/429694/
2010-05-08T01:19:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	yes my output was the same. I thing I made a mistake that I pasted the output here in chat so it was printed as individual line. My output is exactly same to yours
2010-05-08T01:21:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	next try: in CLI type sudo aptitude update, the try do do-release-upgrade again
2010-05-08T01:24:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	the same output: no new release found. Here is my ubuntuforums thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1470077
2010-05-08T01:26:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	one thing caught my eye: you are using "main server" -- that will be under heavy load still -- try to choose a mirror near your location
2010-05-08T12:59:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	as you suggested earlier I tried to change mirror location but still I am unable to upgrade to 10.04
2010-05-08T13:03:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	strange - I'm afraid I've run out of ideas -- obviously it must be some setting on your machine -- but I don't even know where apt keeps all of it's files...
2010-05-08T13:08:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	can you please post your sources.list file in /etc/apt/
2010-05-08T13:11:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	http://paste.ubuntu.com/429917/   -- a 9.10 system, where I get the option to upgrade
2010-05-08T13:12:00.000Z	jamil_1	guntbert	thanx
2010-05-08T13:12:00.000Z	guntbert	jamil_1	you're welcome :-)
