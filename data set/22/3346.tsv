2008-11-16T18:53:00.000Z	adam7	paul68	according to http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/i386/dhcp3-server/filelist, the dhcp3-server package should give you those files

2008-11-16T19:12:00.000Z	paul68	adam7	how can I ping a destination to see what the ip of that mac is?
2008-11-16T19:13:00.000Z	adam7	paul68	you have to know the IP of the other computer, and then you can do ping 10.0.99.99
2008-11-16T19:13:00.000Z	adam7	paul68	(where 10.0.99.99 is the ip of the other computer)
2008-11-16T19:14:00.000Z	paul68	adam7	well I know the gateway but need to figure out the mac of that gateway
2008-11-16T19:14:00.000Z	adam7	paul68	oh, sorry. If you can (or have) nmap installed, then just do nmap ip_address
