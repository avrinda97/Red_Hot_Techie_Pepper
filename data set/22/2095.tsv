2010-07-16T06:31:00.000Z	lcuk		my god tearing problems are everywhere
2010-07-16T06:33:00.000Z	lcuk		does it tear if you turn off compiz
2010-07-16T06:33:00.000Z	xenogia	lcuk	if i turn compositing off it doesn't tear
2010-07-16T06:33:00.000Z	lcuk	xenogia	what model nvidia and res are you running?
2010-07-16T06:34:00.000Z	lcuk		are you at the limits of it
2010-07-16T06:34:00.000Z	xenogia	lcuk	gtx 275 and two 21" lcds running at 1920x1080
2010-07-16T06:34:00.000Z	xenogia		as stated only happens in videos (tried nv, x11, vdpau and gl)
2010-07-16T06:35:00.000Z	xenogia		xbmc is the only program it doesn't tear with
2010-07-16T06:35:00.000Z	lcuk	xenogia	sure, yuv to rgb conversion is hard
2010-07-16T06:35:00.000Z	lcuk		(for the composited overlay)
2010-07-16T06:35:00.000Z	xenogia	lcuk	even upgraded compiz to 0.8.6 and turned off undirect fullscreen
2010-07-16T06:36:00.000Z	xenogia		a really annoying bug
2010-07-16T06:36:00.000Z	lcuk	xenogia	shame really, on a hunch try lowering the resolution and see what point it stops tearing
2010-07-16T06:36:00.000Z	lcuk		it could simply be that the drivers are doing all they can
2010-07-16T06:38:00.000Z	xenogia	lcuk	i did notice the tearing is only at the top of the screen
2010-07-16T06:38:00.000Z	lcuk	xenogia	just cover that with some duct tape then
2010-07-16T06:39:00.000Z	xenogia	lcuk	haha
2010-07-16T06:39:00.000Z	xenogia	lcuk	damn annoying bug, this never happened on my gts 8800
2010-07-16T06:39:00.000Z	lcuk	xenogia	same res?
2010-07-16T06:39:00.000Z	xenogia		yeah same res
2010-07-16T06:41:00.000Z	xenogia	lcuk	must rip hair out
2010-07-16T06:42:00.000Z	lcuk	xenogia	i dont like video tearing either :) so much so i wrote a little something to whack it on the head ;)
