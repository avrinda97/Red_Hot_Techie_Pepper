2010-03-11T08:31:00.000Z	von_neumann		i've got a strange one, every now and then since I installed Karmic, my left mouse button stops working for a bit, then sometimes the screen saver will come on though I'm moving the mouse around and using the keyboard
2010-03-11T08:31:00.000Z	von_neumann		my friend reported it to me first, then just now it happend to me for the first time
2010-03-11T08:32:00.000Z	von_neumann		once I typed in my password at the screensaver the left mouse button worked again
2010-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	von_neumann		antuo9us: no system load, it is doing it again now
2010-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	von_neumann		very odd
2010-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	von_neumann		i tried killing metacity and sparking up sawfish, but that did not fix it
2010-03-11T08:35:00.000Z	von_neumann		i wonder if the screensaver is grabbing the mouse focus and running in the background
2010-03-11T08:35:00.000Z	von_neumann		i just killed xscreensaver and that didn't fix it either
2010-03-11T08:36:00.000Z	von_neumann		the scroll wheel and right mouse button do not work as expected either
2010-03-11T08:37:00.000Z	von_neumann		 usb
2010-03-11T08:37:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	ubuntu or kubuntu? if ubuntu, right click the top panel, choose "add to panel" and drag the "system monitor" to the panel. Go to Monitor's options, activate all other things (memory, disk, etc) and watch CPU, LOAD and stuff. perhaps this gives you a clue, whats going in
2010-03-11T08:38:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	sounds very uncommon... what are the hardware specs? try the system monitor and see, if something spikes
2010-03-11T08:42:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	perhaps a reboot might do something. did you already try to restart X?
2010-03-11T08:42:00.000Z	von_neumann	hmw	I'm a 10+ year linux user, I'm not rebooting :-)
2010-03-11T08:43:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	sometimes restarting X does really help. especiall with gnome... *g*
2010-03-11T08:44:00.000Z	von_neumann	hmw	CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE FTW
2010-03-11T08:44:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	ALT+PRINT+K is it now
2010-03-11T08:44:00.000Z	von_neumann	hmw	unless you re-enable CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE that is :-)
2010-03-11T08:44:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	:) i see
2010-03-11T08:45:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	usually i dont liek restarting, either, but sometimes... you just have to
2010-03-11T08:46:00.000Z	von_neumann	hmw	 I had to restart earlier today... Tried to use gmplayer and it does not play well with pulseaudio apparently... I had to reboot to get sound back
2010-03-11T08:47:00.000Z	hmw	von_neumann	i rarely get a week uptime with my ubuntu workstation... my LFS has a longer uptime... something about 180 days or so
