2012-10-25T17:20:00.000Z	Cheery		I have a problem.
2012-10-25T17:20:00.000Z	Cheery		ubuntu .iso is 753MB, but my CD is only 7000MB
2012-10-25T17:20:00.000Z	Cheery		700*
2012-10-25T17:21:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	burn it to a dvd.
2012-10-25T17:21:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	unfortunately I only have 700MB CD-Rs
2012-10-25T17:22:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	are you on Ubuntu 12.04 right now?
2012-10-25T17:22:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	yes, although it's updated many times
2012-10-25T17:22:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	anyway this is for another computer, that has debian in it at the moment
2012-10-25T17:23:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	or umm.. I can't really remove something from that .iso any way?
2012-10-25T17:24:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	well there's no point dragging this further. I think I'll go and see if I'll find 800MB CD-R or a dvd
2012-10-25T17:24:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	you'll have to get a DVD.
2012-10-25T17:25:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	there's a long route that you could take.  Install 12.04 and use the upgrade manager.
2012-10-25T17:26:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	naah. I guess I'll go and buy some DVDs.
2012-10-25T17:26:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	good idea. ;-) They come in useful for other things too.
2012-10-25T17:27:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	although there's not much in saying "no can do", I enjoyed chatting with you.
2012-10-25T17:28:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	thank you.
2012-10-25T17:28:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	I enjoyed chatting with you also. And I hope you're able to get updated.
2012-10-25T17:28:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	not a problem.
2012-10-25T17:29:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	only ubuntu seems to be able to handle apt -packages.
2012-10-25T17:30:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	actually Debian and Fedora can handle them too. Sort of. Apt has an RPM version for Fedora.
2012-10-25T17:31:00.000Z	Cheery	PatrickDickey	yeah, but debian stable seems to have so old packages
2012-10-25T17:31:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	Cheery	that's because Ubuntu is using Debian unstable (or debian testing, I don't remember which).
