2009-09-02T12:52:00.000Z	Jakobsen		I have a lot of services running from the directory /var/tmp/Shit/ as the user "rsync".. Has my linux-box been hacked?
2009-09-02T12:54:00.000Z	Jakobsen		Several sshd processes and pscan2 is being run by that user, and in the dir I've got a lot of files e.g. vuln.txt and pass.txt
2009-09-02T12:54:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	Kinda sounds like it. take a look at the output of 'netstat -tunlp'
2009-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	what should I be looking for?
2009-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	Anything odd
2009-09-02T12:56:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	there's nothing odd in there.. my webserver and X ports..
2009-09-02T12:56:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	You can pastebin the output if you want somebody else to take a look
2009-09-02T12:57:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	If you have another computer you might want to disconnect that one from the net until you're sure its ok
2009-09-02T12:58:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	here you go: http://www.pastebin.org/14138
2009-09-02T12:59:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	I just killed all processes running as "rsync". That seemed to deal with most of the disturbance..
2009-09-02T13:01:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	I just opened the vuln.txt.. There is 10 IP addresses of servers, and root logins for every one of them.. That's definately not good
2009-09-02T13:01:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	nope
2009-09-02T13:02:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	You might want to consider backing up personal data and reinstalling.
2009-09-02T13:02:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	I will ;) thank you for the help..
2009-09-02T13:05:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	Judging from the Mar 25 2006 dates, either your date is wrong, or this machine has been compromised for quite some time
2009-09-02T13:06:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	My time is right, and the machine was installed a week ago..
2009-09-02T13:07:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	It looks like the attacker used pscan2 to scan your subnet 20 hosts at a time
2009-09-02T13:08:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	it's the only host on my subnet except for my laptop and my WRT54GL :D
2009-09-02T13:08:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	but he also scanned a lot of outside IP
2009-09-02T13:08:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	Hmm, maybe it was somebody elses
2009-09-02T13:09:00.000Z	Jakobsen	powertool08	and the positive results are written in the vuln.txt file.. I'm getting rid of that..
2009-09-02T13:09:00.000Z	powertool08	Jakobsen	You could try to identify the hosts and let them know if you felt like being nice :)
