2011-06-26T23:36:00.000Z	DriverIssues		so edbian:  I should go to a usb live disk before I even think about fixing drivers
2011-06-26T23:36:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	you can always use a sandybridge CPU with AES-NI
2011-06-26T23:36:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 Oh, right, that's what matters.
2011-06-26T23:38:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	yes
2011-06-26T23:45:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	speedstep or amd cool'n'quiet. it's a good thing
2011-06-26T23:45:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 but even when at 100% load, it's stuck there
2011-06-26T23:45:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 this is also a desktop
2011-06-26T23:46:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	ALL cpus for 5-10 years have powersaving built in
2011-06-26T23:48:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 Yes, but they should turn off properly when i need more power
2011-06-26T23:48:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	yes they do. run a program that uses the CPU and you will see
2011-06-26T23:50:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 I'll try with phoronix.
2011-06-27T00:09:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	what cpu is it?
2011-06-27T00:09:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	and how did you check if it went up?
2011-06-27T00:09:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 AMD Athlon 64 x2 5000+, hardinfo
2011-06-27T00:09:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	use cat /proc/cpuinfo
2011-06-27T00:12:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	it sounds like hardinfo is wrong
2011-06-27T00:12:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 why would it be wrong.  It displayed the same thing
2011-06-27T00:13:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 before stressing cpu, it was 1000 mhz, now it went up to 2600 mhz
2011-06-27T00:14:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	cpuinfo is what the kernel sees. and on a linux system there is no higher authority thn the kernel. and the kernel says your CPU runs at 2600MHz
2011-06-27T00:15:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 yes, and hardinfo says the same thing.  I don't understand why its wrong
2011-06-27T00:15:00.000Z	DriverIssues	wols	 that was before a stress test
2011-06-27T00:40:00.000Z	wols	DriverIssues	switching between my IGP and discrete graphics needs the terminal. can't be done in X at all
