2008-05-26T21:50:00.000Z	jjlee		just installed hardy, playing video on youtube works (no sound yet), but playing video on google video does not
2008-05-26T21:50:00.000Z	jjlee		is that a known issue?
2008-05-26T21:51:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	no
2008-05-26T21:51:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	you are sure you have'nt installed any blocking extensions
2008-05-26T21:52:00.000Z	jjlee	anirudh0	only chatzilla :-)
2008-05-26T21:52:00.000Z	jjlee	anirudh0	what do you mean by "blocking extensions"?
2008-05-26T21:52:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	adblock,flashblock and the like...
2008-05-26T21:53:00.000Z	jjlee	anirudh0	no, only non-ubufox extension installed is chatzilla (and the problem was the same before I installed that)
2008-05-26T21:53:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	can you post a screenshot of the google video page?
2008-05-26T21:54:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	flash should'nt care about the site
2008-05-26T21:54:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	and a google site wont have codeing errors
2008-05-26T21:54:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	*coding
2008-05-26T21:54:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	go on
2008-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	amazing! i have the same problem
2008-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	never knew
2008-05-26T22:06:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	aren'nt the videos at video.google also available on youtube?
2008-05-26T22:06:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	google owns youtube after all
2008-05-26T22:06:00.000Z	jjlee	anirudh0	I think google has been busy recently improving integration with other sites
2008-05-26T22:06:00.000Z	jjlee	anirudh0	so it's possible it worked for you earlier
2008-05-26T22:07:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	hey...all videos have a "watch on youtube" link
2008-05-26T22:08:00.000Z	anirudh0	jjlee	you said youtube worked fine right, so you could use the youtube links
2008-05-26T22:08:00.000Z	jjlee	anirudh0	yes -- though would be nice to discover a workaround
