2010-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	possibly a new bug, try the 10.04 release?
2010-10-19T10:05:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	do you still have it installed and can you get to a terminal?
2010-10-19T10:06:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	if you can get to a terminal on it, try sudo aptitude reinstall udev
2010-10-19T10:07:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	no
2010-10-19T10:09:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	good question, what model was your netbook?
2010-10-19T10:11:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	well other ppla re having the problem too, lemme read the thread see if there's a fix

2010-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	it seems the init is not being updated on a kernel update, as both threads are saying the same thing really
2010-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	hmm, does unetbootin work on mac? *looks*
2010-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	most distros have an image you can dd to a usb stick
2010-10-19T10:23:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	mostly yes, but every distro has different ways, but if you can find an image you can dd it
2010-10-19T10:24:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	I suggest debian if you're fine with a command line
2010-10-19T10:25:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	well debian should be fine then, you can install a desktop out of the box (gnome) but you will have to add your own software after, but it's apt based
2010-10-19T10:27:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	go for unstable, trust me, it's more stable than ubuntu lol

2010-10-19T10:36:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	yup
2010-10-19T10:37:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	there is a debian page on it too

2010-10-19T10:40:00.000Z	Khedron	EeePC_woes	maybe, or install linux on it ;)
