2010-08-17T08:19:00.000Z	rocode	tarikk	did you increase the width of the bar to adjust for the width of the icons and text?
2010-08-17T08:20:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	yes i did.. the background image is tile'd accross the whole bar.. and the the buttons are wrong etc.

2010-08-17T08:36:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	default one.. ambiance

2010-08-17T08:40:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	cool thanks
2010-08-17T08:44:00.000Z	rocode	tarikk	I can't seem to reproduce that error with the tiling. Could you tell me what you did? Did you just change orientation?
2010-08-17T08:54:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	sorry got dropped. im using dual monitors that could be the issue
2010-08-17T08:54:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	the screenshot only shows the right side
2010-08-17T08:57:00.000Z	rocode	tarikk	from what I can gather, the tiling issue is related to the window widget.
2010-08-17T09:00:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	i see. but does the show desktop icon and rubbish bin normally get this big? the open windows.. they keep changing sizes get fat then thin when you open more
2010-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	it looks stupid lol.. not sure if this is just with me
2010-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	rocode	tarikk	try disabling the expand option in the panel preferences.
2010-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	tried it umm.. its a little neater but the tiling is still there.. but its good enough i think
2010-08-17T09:02:00.000Z	tarikk	rocode	thanks!
2010-08-17T09:02:00.000Z	rocode	tarikk	I am trying to find a solution to the tiling. I think it relates to how the windows widget builds its alpha for each individual item.
