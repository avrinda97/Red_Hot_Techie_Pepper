2005-12-20T12:23:00.000Z	Overclocked_486		Hey, I'm using the Korn shell and I'm having trouble with my environment variables such as $MAIL. They keep getting purged when I close Xterm. Is there a way I can make them stick around?
2005-12-20T12:25:00.000Z	Overclocked_486		any takers?
2005-12-20T12:26:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	add them to $HOME/.bashrc
2005-12-20T12:28:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	is there a specific place I should put that?
2005-12-20T12:29:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	anywhere in .bashrc (or .kshrc, whichever is correct),   export MAIL=/var/spool/mail
2005-12-20T12:29:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	I made up the value of MAIL, but you know what I mean
2005-12-20T12:29:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	so if I want fetchmail to send the stuff to ~/Mail, then let procmail sort it, $MAIL should still be ~/Mail?
2005-12-20T12:30:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	I would have to check the fetchmail docs, but most likely.
2005-12-20T12:30:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	you can specify a mailbox explicitly with fetchmail, which is a better option
2005-12-20T12:30:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	in my .fetchmailrc?
2005-12-20T12:31:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	for delivery location?  yes, in the rc file
2005-12-20T12:32:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	I guess I was doing it the lazy way...
2005-12-20T12:33:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	nothing wrong with the lazy way in this case.  I just prefer setting it explicitly.  nothing to remember.
2005-12-20T12:34:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	Where exactly should that go? I have the "poll server" line, setting the protocol, giving the username and passwd, a line for decoding MIME, and a line to tell fetchmail where procmail is.
2005-12-20T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	that's all you need, then.  if $MAIL is used, procmail will be using it.
2005-12-20T12:35:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	But $MAIL is busted.
2005-12-20T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	didn't realize you were using procmail.  You do already have an explicit destination, albeit a logical one
2005-12-20T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	then you have to look at its interaction with procmail, not fetchmail
2005-12-20T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	assuming that procmail does receive the message.
2005-12-20T12:36:00.000Z	sethk	Overclocked_486	might want to set up webadmin
2005-12-20T12:37:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	webadmin?
2005-12-20T12:40:00.000Z	Overclocked_486	sethk	w00t. I just sent an email to myself via webmail, then called fetchmail, and it ended up in the folder I wanted it to.
