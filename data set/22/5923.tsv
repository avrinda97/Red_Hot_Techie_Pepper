2008-01-15T02:02:00.000Z	Tom47		in evolution there are some huge pop mail caches that seem to grow and row ... anyone know how to contain this?
2008-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	dooglus	Tom47	delete them
2008-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	dooglus	Tom47	I reported a bug about it.  after a year or so - it was confirmed, yay!  :)
2008-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	Tom47	dooglus	is this possible within evolution?
2008-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	dooglus	Tom47	no, evolution is broken in that respect
2008-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	Tom47	dooglus	ah ok
2008-01-15T02:04:00.000Z	Tom47	dooglus	well done on getting bug accepted

2008-01-15T02:14:00.000Z	dooglus	Tom47	I believe it's safe to delete the pop cache.  I don't know why it doesn't get fixed.  I can only assume someone powerful is in cahoots with the hard disk drive companies
2008-01-15T02:14:00.000Z	Tom47		hehehehe
2008-01-15T02:15:00.000Z	dooglus	Tom47	there are men in black suits at the door.  If you don't hear from me again, please get the word out.  ;)
2008-01-15T02:16:00.000Z	Tom47	dooglus	so long as they are black not white tho i believe the whites have forsworn against waterboarding now
2008-01-15T02:16:00.000Z	dooglus	Tom47	I think you got too close to the truth.  See how they're trying to silence you?
