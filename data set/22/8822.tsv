2005-06-24T07:16:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	sudo mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy -t auto
2005-06-24T07:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	............
2005-06-24T07:19:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	sudo mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy -t vfat

2005-06-24T07:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	what's it say?

2005-06-24T07:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	but, I want to know if it's a floppy problem first
2005-06-24T07:26:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	did it mount this time/
2005-06-24T07:30:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	yeahp
2005-06-24T07:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	the best formatting method for a floppy is "dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/fd0 & mkfs.vfat /dev/fd0"
2005-06-24T07:35:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	Razor-X	i tried to do a sudo cp <file> /mnt/floppy
2005-06-24T07:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	yeah, must be
2005-06-24T07:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	Bisclaveret	put it in DOS, and find out, they must've gone faulty
2005-06-24T07:37:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	Razor-X	they go faulty once i try to write anything to them in linux. when i reformat them in dos, they're perfectly fine
2005-06-24T07:55:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	Razor-X	people in another channel are telling me i should have a /dev/fd0u1440
