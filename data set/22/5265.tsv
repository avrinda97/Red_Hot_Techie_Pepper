2009-07-08T01:28:00.000Z	cube_		hey
2009-07-08T01:28:00.000Z	cube_		i boot and login, but nothing appears for hours!??!?!
2009-07-08T01:29:00.000Z	cube_		any ideas?
2009-07-08T01:30:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	once you login goto a tty then login and check ~/.xsession-errors for possible problems
2009-07-08T01:31:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	says: checking xgl: not present - is that something bad?
2009-07-08T01:32:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	no, just a simple check.
2009-07-08T01:32:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	says initialiing tracker: could not settle idle IO prioirty
2009-07-08T01:33:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	possibly create a new user then try to log in.
2009-07-08T01:33:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	gotcha. how to do that?
2009-07-08T01:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	in a tty do adduser newusername .. then it'll ask for a password and the such.. use the new info for the next attempt login
2009-07-08T01:34:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	gotcha thanks
2009-07-08T01:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	be sure not to delete the other account though.. you'll need to give the new user admin rights later .. if this works
2009-07-08T01:35:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	root number?
2009-07-08T01:35:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	root number? that means?
2009-07-08T01:35:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	its asking for a root number. what should i type in?
2009-07-08T01:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	i have no clue what that means?
2009-07-08T01:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	leave it blank?
2009-07-08T01:36:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	OMMG haha. it said "Room Number". i misread it lol. its just asking for stupid pim stuff lol
2009-07-08T01:37:00.000Z	bastidrazor	cube_	right you can leave all that blank. username and passwd are the only important things
2009-07-08T01:38:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	ok, just fyi: before the login screen appears, is says: Could not load theme tango gdm
2009-07-08T01:39:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	im giving up. gonna boot to windows i think
2009-07-08T01:41:00.000Z	cube_	bastidrazor	for my other ubuntu computer, i'm looking for a pack (via synaptic) of mono fonts for my console. any suggestions?
