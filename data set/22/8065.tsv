2007-12-31T20:08:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	that's odd. Did you modify your repository listing?
2007-12-31T20:08:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	could you please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2007-12-31T20:09:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	try changing all occurences of "in.ubuntu [..]" with, say, se.ubuntu [...]
2007-12-31T20:10:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	then apt-get update and apt-get install -f
2007-12-31T20:16:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	your architecture.
2007-12-31T20:19:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f
2007-12-31T20:21:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	nope, just sudo apt-get install -f
2007-12-31T20:24:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	try sudo aptitude install build-essential now
2007-12-31T20:27:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	erm, try q for now
2007-12-31T20:27:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	then sudo apt-get autoremove
2007-12-31T20:35:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	Do you wish to search?
2007-12-31T20:36:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	or what are you attempting to dos?
2007-12-31T20:36:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	What are you /attempting/ to do?
2007-12-31T20:37:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	then don't use cache; use install. sudo apt-get install xmms, if it's xmms you want.
2007-12-31T20:38:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	good. :)
2007-12-31T20:46:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	You would be better off explaining your issue to the people in the channel.
2007-12-31T20:47:00.000Z	MenZa	jeezers	can I recommend you try beep media player instead? It's like xmms, but it has a GTK interface.
