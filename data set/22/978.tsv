2011-01-23T10:12:00.000Z	thefinn931	Us3r_Unfriendly	not so well. My netbook won't boot
2011-01-23T10:13:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	how so?
2011-01-23T10:17:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	what happened to your machine to make it not boot??
2011-01-23T10:19:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	what happens exactly when you power on the machine?
2011-01-23T10:20:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	can you get on or not at all?
2011-01-23T10:20:00.000Z	thefinn931	Us3r_Unfriendly	that being http://pastebin.com/sTSdMLkw
2011-01-23T10:20:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	so you have grub and recovery mode?
2011-01-23T10:21:00.000Z	thefinn931	Us3r_Unfriendly	yes, but it does the same thing
2011-01-23T10:22:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	how'd you get that output without her machine working?
2011-01-23T10:23:00.000Z	thefinn931	Us3r_Unfriendly	she manually typed it
2011-01-23T10:25:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	yes...okay so it's not mounting for some reason.  the number one on your pastebin looks like that would be the root cause for all that problems.  can't mount your partition with ubuntu.  now would this be a grub issue???
2011-01-23T10:26:00.000Z	thefinn931	Us3r_Unfriendly	i doubt it...
2011-01-23T10:26:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	i wonder if it is a grub issue that she could reinstall it and update it...it might work
2011-01-23T10:26:00.000Z	thefinn931	Us3r_Unfriendly	she'd like to keep her files
2011-01-23T10:26:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	well then the question is how to mount a drive at boot up
2011-01-23T10:28:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	well that's a easy fix to get it working again but means using the ubuntu cd to copy files from the hard drive to a portable usb device and then to reinstall the os.  But i want to know how to fix it without that.  hmm
2011-01-23T10:28:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	grub decides what to boot up.  your init should decide what you boot into
2011-01-23T10:29:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	well inittab, but ubuntu doesn't use that anymore
2011-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	thefinn931	Us3r_Unfriendly	I'm gotten my friend on IRC. could you give her like step by step n00b instructions? (i can do it if not, it's just that you seem to better understand this stuff)
2011-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	with what?  sorry but i g2g for a sec
2011-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	thefinn931	i'll be back to help though
