2008-12-19T09:02:00.000Z	CntrySheepFahker		I thought it would be fun trying a new OS, but linux man is a pain. Nothing works right.
2008-12-19T09:03:00.000Z	CntrySheepFahker		Guys ya'll dont have to flame me lol. I know it has potential. But you have to configure everything or know 100 commands to get stuff working.

2008-12-19T09:04:00.000Z	jbmigel	CntrySheepFahker	you might want to look at the mouse settings in /etc/X11/xorg.conf... maybe something weird got in there about scroll
