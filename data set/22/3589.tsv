2008-08-20T04:51:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	Hi again. i did all that steps, and restarted my laptop, but i cant access the remote computer via ssh
2008-08-20T04:52:00.000Z	tonohono	sarthor_	Are you able to connect to the internet wirelessly?
2008-08-20T04:52:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	Yes.
2008-08-20T04:53:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	but not to ssh.
2008-08-20T04:54:00.000Z	tonohono	sarthor_	Hrm. What are the results of the command " lsmod | grep bcm " ?
2008-08-20T04:55:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	nothing
2008-08-20T04:56:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	no output for lsmod |grep bcm
2008-08-20T04:58:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	root@salaar-laptop:~# lspci |grep BCM
2008-08-20T05:01:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	you gone?
2008-08-20T05:03:00.000Z	tonohono	sarthor_	Nope, just figuring stuff out yet. It's odd internet works with the ndiswrapper, but not ssh. Same symptom as before, right? Cannot ctrl+c out of ssh login?
2008-08-20T05:03:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	Yes. Same as b4.
2008-08-20T05:04:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	its becoming challanging problem.
2008-08-20T05:05:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	is also trying to figure out the problem.
2008-08-20T05:08:00.000Z	tonohono	sarthor_	When following the guide at step 2, did you download the sp34152.exe file, or another one?
2008-08-20T05:08:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp34001-34500/
2008-08-20T05:09:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	i downloaded ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp34001-34500/sp34152.exe
2008-08-20T05:10:00.000Z	tonohono	sarthor_	Ah, ok. Because your card is revision (rev01) and not (rev02), you need to download wget ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp33001-33500/sp33008.exe instead.
2008-08-20T05:11:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	shoult i start from step 2?? how to remove the older one??
2008-08-20T05:11:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	and what will be steps again. and what change i will need to make.
2008-08-20T05:11:00.000Z	tonohono	sarthor_	Follow the guide once more  (I hope!) but replace the wget download link in the guide with the one I provided. You might encounter errors running the guide a second time, but ignore them, as you're only replacing existing settings with the same one.
2008-08-20T05:11:00.000Z	tonohono	sarthor_	The *only* change should be replacing the sp34125.exe download line with the one I linked :)
2008-08-20T05:12:00.000Z	sarthor_	tonohono	Ok.
