2010-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	For Medibuntu, sudo apt-get --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring
2010-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	I don't use mediaubuntu
2010-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	according to your pastebin, you have it enabled.
2010-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	If I have a repo for it, it's for some other package tied to it I spose.
2010-03-17T12:57:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	I assure you I have never installed it, only added those PPAs for cetain apps I wanted
2010-03-17T12:57:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	For TOR, you should have followed the instructions at http://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en (option 2), which would have installed the key
2010-03-17T12:58:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	Again, man, I just copied my apt-get sources from one computer to another. the other computer? it all works fine. the issue is on here, I haven't added ANY keys, so how can I backup one copies keys to the other? that would be the fastest I feel.
2010-03-17T12:58:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	I did follow those instructions on my laptop
2010-03-17T13:10:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	it contains binary data, yes
2010-03-17T13:11:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	that's how gnupg stores such things by default
2010-03-17T13:14:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	have you considered just copying it over?
2010-03-17T13:18:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	When attempting a sudo mv : "Failed to preserve owenrship for 'destdirwashere': Operation not permitted.
2010-03-17T13:18:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	I did a sudo cp of the file to my desktop then was attempting to move it to external media.
2010-03-17T13:19:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	did the copy actually fail, or was it just warning you about not preserving file permissions?
2010-03-17T13:22:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	(it was only a warning by the way) : I still get GPG errors on apt-get update.
2010-03-17T13:22:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	After replacing the file in /etc/apt/
2010-03-17T13:23:00.000Z	rww	Jon-also	replace the other files ending in .gpg in the same directory then, I guess. Ask wgrant, I'm more of the "you should readd the PPAs" school of thought.
2010-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	I also set the permissions to the same as on the laptop before doing apt-get update (owner: root, read and write, group: root access none, other access none
2010-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	ok
2010-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	 Ahh fml I missed one.
2010-03-17T13:26:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	Hot damn. Boo-yah. Rocked that *censored*. YYEAAAHHH. God I love Linux - the simplest of tasks are mind-numbingly difficult.. I haven't felt this way since I was a 9 year old kid on DOS6 ;)
2010-03-17T13:27:00.000Z	Jon-also	rww	Rebooting this machine I'm on Jon- if you need to chat with me as well\
