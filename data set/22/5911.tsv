2007-12-15T08:34:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	what do you mean by port?
2007-12-15T08:35:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	like the pop mail port is 110, how do i find mine??
2007-12-15T08:36:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	do you mean find which ports are open on your computer?
2007-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	"computers" don't have ports, each type of programs have ports, you can connect to your computer (via your ip) on any port you want, you need to be running a server on a certain port for it to work though
2007-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	yes
2007-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	yeah the nmap program is a program that finds open ports (like Rodietze said)
2007-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	i have rythmweb installed so i need the port to connect to it using a browser
2007-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	you'd have to look in the rythmweb help
2007-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	or google for it, most of us don't have every standard port memorized, just the common ones
2007-12-15T08:39:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	it gives an example
2007-12-15T08:45:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	what are you typing into the browser?
2007-12-15T08:45:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	speeves, http://you-rb-host:5389/
2007-12-15T08:46:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	try "127.0.0.1:5389"
2007-12-15T08:47:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	speeves, both the suggestions show "Unable to connect"
2007-12-15T08:47:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	then you don't have the web panel running on port 5389
2007-12-15T08:47:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	it
2007-12-15T08:48:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	it's not :) either you have the wrong port, or it's not running on your computer, or there was an error or something, but unable to connect means that there isn't anything on that port
2007-12-15T08:49:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	it shows that it is rythmbox running on that port
2007-12-15T08:49:00.000Z	kelsin	Jude	what does?
2007-12-15T08:49:00.000Z	Jude	kelsin	netstat -anp
