2012-10-05T23:03:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 that should take care of you ethernet
2012-10-05T23:11:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 after compat is done you can try this for your wireless  sudo rmmod rtl8187    && sudo ifconfig wlan0 down &&  sudo modprobe iwlagn 11n_disable=1  sudo ifconfig wlan0 up    If wlan0 is the correct thing  check with ifconfig
2012-10-05T23:16:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 reboot
2012-10-05T23:16:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 then come back here for more de-bugging
2012-10-05T23:17:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 pastebinit will auto paste stuff for you on paste.ubuntu.com
2012-10-05T23:22:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 try this   sudo rmmod rtl8187     && sudo modprobe iwlagn    then please run ifconfig    to see if wlan0 or ra0 or whatever wireless is. Is it there now ?
2012-10-05T23:31:00.000Z	Westz	bobweaver	"module rtl8187 does not exist in /proc/modules"

2012-10-05T23:37:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 lets see lsmod again maybe now is a good time to tell you what is going on or in other words what we are doing.  In linux we use model aka "drivers" in other worlds.   so the mod(driver) that you have loaded is the wrong one ! aka rtl8187 you need the iwlagn    when we do the command lsmod this means ls = list  and mod = models or drivers.  so ls+mod = list all mods (drivers) running.  sudo rmmod  removes the mod  sudo modprobe  adds
2012-10-05T23:39:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 what I am unsure of is in you paste of lspci -nn it says that your cards are not authenticated I have never seen this before
2012-10-05T23:53:00.000Z	bobweaver	Westz	 that was my next question that is a older kerenl when was the last time you upgraded ?  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-10-06T00:58:00.000Z	Westz	bobweaver	still here?
