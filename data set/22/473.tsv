2011-09-09T10:55:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	I missed your initial question. Where did you find those ata messages?
2011-09-09T10:55:00.000Z	Spo		I found them in /var/log/syslog -  my computer is crashing and I am trying to figure out why
2011-09-09T10:59:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	How many hard disks do you have?
2011-09-09T10:59:00.000Z	Spo		10
2011-09-09T10:59:00.000Z	Spo		1 solo boot drive, 9 in raid 5
2011-09-09T10:59:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	Intel board with onboard SATA?
2011-09-09T11:00:00.000Z	Spo		definately onboard sata
2011-09-09T11:00:00.000Z	Spo		it is an AMD proc
2011-09-09T11:00:00.000Z	Spo		quad core
2011-09-09T11:01:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	Kernel 2.6.32?
2011-09-09T11:01:00.000Z	Spo		8 sata onboard, 2 sata by IDE controller card - everythihng was working fine, one HDD had errors, and was booted from the cluster, I replaced that HDD and the cluster rebuilt, but now this crashing problem
2011-09-09T11:02:00.000Z	Spo		I was using Ubuntu 10.10, but since it was crashing, I upgraded to 11.4 hoping the crashing would quit... it has not
2011-09-09T11:04:00.000Z	Spo		how do I check kernel ver?
2011-09-09T11:04:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	"uname -a"
2011-09-09T11:04:00.000Z	Spo		kernel is 2.6.38-11
2011-09-09T11:07:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	The message says there's a problem with the drive.  I had problems with the very same errors and crashing for weeks on Intel boards and its SATA chip. I replaced the complete hardware but the error remained. Until I switched to another kernel (3.0). Runs rock stable since then.
2011-09-09T11:08:00.000Z	Spo	vlt	what is the best way to get that kernel?
2011-09-09T11:09:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	I got it from kernel.org and compiled it myself.
2011-09-09T11:10:00.000Z	Spo	vlt	 site is down for maint - what do I need to know to compile the kernel once I get it, (explanation or webpage would be great)
2011-09-09T11:14:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	I can't find a good tutorial now. Maybe there's an easier way if you could find a PPA for a newer kernel.
2011-09-09T11:16:00.000Z	vlt	Spo	Something like https://launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/+archive/ppa
2011-09-09T11:16:00.000Z	Spo	vlt	thanks for all your help
