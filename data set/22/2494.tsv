2009-06-06T04:33:00.000Z	fccf	Apollo2366	you might ask in #gcc or #c++
2009-07-15T01:17:00.000Z	fccf	Apollo2366	what are you trying to do in audacity
2009-07-15T01:17:00.000Z	Apollo2366	fccf	I'm trying to combine two .wav files into one, but when I export my project, the .wav file it saves is broken. Help?
2009-07-15T01:21:00.000Z	Apollo2366	fccf	do you have any idea what might be wrong?
2009-07-15T01:22:00.000Z	fccf	Apollo2366	my first thought is you don't have the appropriate debs loaded to do audiofile manipulation
2009-07-15T01:23:00.000Z	Apollo2366	fccf	What debs do you think I need, and where can I find them? Also, .wav is the only file format that doesn't work.
2009-07-15T01:28:00.000Z	Apollo2366	fccf	did you catch my response?
2009-07-15T01:29:00.000Z	fccf	Apollo2366	in Synaptic .. search for wav and install the actual wave plugins/drivers ... not sure what they all are called ... work with the discriptions
2009-07-15T01:30:00.000Z	Apollo2366	fccf	I can play any other .wav just fine. It's just this one that doesn't work.
2009-07-15T01:35:00.000Z	Apollo2366	fccf	I think I'm just not saving it correctly or something. Any idea?
2009-07-15T01:37:00.000Z	fccf	Apollo2366	er um ... not really ... make sure you have the right encoders and such .. not sure how well audacity works with wav
2009-07-15T01:37:00.000Z	Apollo2366	fccf	thanks anyway...
