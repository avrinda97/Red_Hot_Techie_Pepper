2007-11-17T02:29:00.000Z	jshriver		I just rebooted my machine now X seems to freeze on starting. I get the gdm login then it goes to the screen that normally has the "loading x, y, z" and stopping there
2007-11-17T02:29:00.000Z	jshriver		running Gutsy
2007-11-17T02:29:00.000Z	jshriver		tried /etc/init.d/gdm stop then start
2007-11-17T02:29:00.000Z	jshriver		no help
2007-11-17T02:31:00.000Z	jshriver		ok whatever you like best :)
2007-11-17T02:31:00.000Z	jshriver		since X is broken!
2007-11-17T02:31:00.000Z	jshriver		Can someone help me out?
2007-11-17T02:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	cheers
2007-11-17T02:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	have you tried a clean user? )not yours)
2007-12-19T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	find /dir/ | xargs mv /another√á
2007-12-19T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	find /dir/ | xargs mv /another/dir/ the last slash is pretty important!!!
2007-12-19T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	please try it first in a dummy case or use cp and rm the source thir after the copy just in case
2007-12-19T20:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	find + xargs can be dangerous
2007-12-19T20:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	find /dir/ -exec mv {} /another/dir/   ??
2010-05-04T23:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	there are a few dock apps
2010-05-04T23:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	awn; kiba dock; cairo dock; docky etc
2010-08-09T20:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	it is now in nautilus preferences. last tab
2010-08-09T23:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	better use public key auth ( if you are using expect only for the password )
2010-08-09T23:50:00.000Z	jshriver	erUSUL	tried, but the end point is a jailbroken (?)/jailed account so looks like everything gets wiped after upload and cp'd elsewhere
2010-08-09T23:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	fair enough
2010-10-05T23:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	jshriver	install ia32-libs
