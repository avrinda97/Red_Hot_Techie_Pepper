2006-09-27T06:18:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	install wget through rpm? Not likely.
2006-09-27T06:18:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	um -- I( mean ubuntu
2006-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	installing ubuntu will need to be done with the installer
2006-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	Installing it, if you don't partition, will remove fedora, replacing it with ubuntu
2006-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	faryed so
2006-09-27T06:20:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	yes, you will have to download 600mb of iso
2006-09-27T06:20:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	and ... so...
2006-09-27T06:21:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	um --
2006-09-27T06:21:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	how was that -- I doubt anything that small would work
2006-09-27T06:21:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	ubuntu has no ftp install I know of
2006-09-27T06:23:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	Freespire also requires a very large download, and it will replace fedora, just like ubuntu, but it's a bit easier. You may find it more friendly.\
2006-09-27T06:26:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	they are somewhat similar -- there are not gigantic advantages
2006-09-27T06:26:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	it does not exist
2006-09-27T06:27:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	ubuntu uses gnome by default
2006-09-27T06:28:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	Tell a fedora forum or channel aboiut that
2006-09-27T06:28:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	you are not in the right place for that question
2006-09-27T06:29:00.000Z	gallag	JimyLinux	Tell #debian or #fedora
