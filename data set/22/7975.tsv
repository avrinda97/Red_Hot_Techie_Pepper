2006-11-07T16:56:00.000Z	bobslaede		problems finding libc.so.6 and libpthread.so.0
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobslaede	have you been messing with gcc?
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	no, clean install
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	you're thinking wrong gcc version_
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobslaede	aye.
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobslaede	libc.so rings bells for version of gcc
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	although this is a binary install thing
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	i'll check that out
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	gcc version 4.1.2
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobslaede	get back with error logs if it's still annoying.
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	you want me to paste some stuff?

2006-11-07T17:04:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobslaede	you'll need to feed it options i reckon. like telling it where your shared librarys are
2006-11-07T17:04:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobslaede	are there forums for that software?
2006-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	there might be, i'll check that out
2006-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	bobslaede	gyaresu	didn't need to feed it optins on dapper tho :(
2006-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	gyaresu	bobslaede	I reckon there'll be someone with the answer.
