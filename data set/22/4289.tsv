2008-03-25T17:08:00.000Z	unop__	Svenstaro	the package needs to be installed tho
2008-03-28T17:17:00.000Z	Svenstaro	unop__	yes
2008-03-28T16:31:00.000Z	unop__	Svenstaro	iirc wxwidgets uses gtk
2008-03-28T16:32:00.000Z	Svenstaro	unop__	you positive on that?
2008-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	unop__	Svenstaro	well, from what i understand wx* tries to be platform independant by using the widget libraries of the local platform, so on windows it uses GDI on gnome gtk on kde qt, etc -- i might very well be wrong if the architecure of wx has changed
2008-03-28T16:34:00.000Z	Svenstaro	unop__	I always thought wxwidgets was its own independant library by not using any local libs, ill read up on that
2008-03-28T17:06:00.000Z	unop__	Svenstaro	depends on context and intent
2008-03-28T17:17:00.000Z	unop__	Svenstaro	was it you who i was having the discussion about wxwidgets with?
2008-03-28T17:18:00.000Z	unop__	Svenstaro	yea, it appears wxwidgets is just a layer on top of the native widget library - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets
2008-03-28T17:21:00.000Z	Svenstaro	unop__	interesting, thanks :)
