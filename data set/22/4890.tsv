2007-09-24T06:15:00.000Z	acee1234		if noone here knows where i can get help any ideas were i should go?
2007-09-24T06:16:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	you have another sound application running, probably in OSS mode
2007-09-24T06:17:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	disabling ESD in Sys-Preferences-Sound can also be helpful
2007-09-24T06:19:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	kubuntu doesn't use esd as far as I know... is it artsd? There must be some sound preference panel in KDE, too
2007-09-24T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	see if you have artsd running: 'ps ax | grep artsd' in konsole
2007-09-24T06:22:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	it's not running then. Sorry, I don't know what could be blocking your audio device.
2007-09-24T06:22:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	repeat your question. If you don't get a reply, it's okay to repeat it after 10 or 15 minutes.
2007-10-02T10:34:00.000Z	acee1234	soundray	how is that going to get it to install?
2007-10-02T10:35:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	you asked about fixing xorg.conf
2007-10-02T10:35:00.000Z	acee1234	soundray	ask the bot?
2007-10-02T10:36:00.000Z	acee1234	soundray	i cant install ubuntu from the live cd when i fixed it the first time someone linked me to a tutorial that said something about the xorg.conf file
2007-10-02T10:38:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	how far do you get?
2007-10-02T10:39:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	were you booting from the CD at the time?
2007-10-02T10:40:00.000Z	acee1234	soundray	yes
2007-10-02T10:41:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	have you tried the Safe Graphics option?
2007-10-02T10:41:00.000Z	acee1234	soundray	yes
2007-10-02T10:44:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	when you get to that blue screen, see if you can switch to a console with Ctrl-Alt-F1. If so, you can run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg', which calls a wizard for reconfiguring xorg.conf
2007-10-02T10:44:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	failing that, I suggest you download the Alternate CD, which has a text-based installer
2007-10-02T10:46:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	I'll leave you in the capable hands of leo_rockw. Thanks leo_rockw
2008-02-12T03:54:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	forget it -- if he's got console access, he'll get in and read your data somehow. Locks help, and threats of violence do too, in some cases ;)
2008-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	soundray	acee1234	a plain text editor -- gedit is easy, I prefer emacs
2008-03-09T03:49:00.000Z	acee1234	soundray	 macrobad: thank you
