2012-09-01T10:57:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	telling someone not to get their hands dirty and actually learning about the OS sounds like windows
2012-09-01T10:58:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	there is no need to tell someone "read up on /etc/fstab (where???) when he just wants something which is working automaticly
2012-09-01T10:58:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	are you reading docu of upstart just because you are using it automaticly?
2012-09-01T10:58:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	there are 2 ways 2 do everything. I figured this was a help channel .. not an easy channel.
2012-09-01T10:59:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	its not helpfull to tell someone to read docu about something he will maybe never need
2012-09-01T10:59:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	and its not helpfull to name him just a file
2012-09-01T10:59:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	he needs it NOW .. this is what he's trying to do.
2012-09-01T11:00:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	reread his question
2012-09-01T11:00:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	he wants music on another partition. So mounting this other partition is what he wants.
2012-09-01T11:00:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	and what is ubuntu doing by default with windows-partitions?
2012-09-01T11:01:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	ubuntu is even not installed on his system
2012-09-01T11:02:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	does it really matter? .. to new users ubuntu is linux
2012-09-01T11:02:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	can you stop that please?
2012-09-01T11:02:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	why because it doesn't conform to what you want to tell the user?
2012-09-01T11:02:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	at the moment only windows is installed, he will now install ubuntu and ubuntu will auto-mount the windows partitoons automaticlky
2012-09-01T11:02:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	so there is no single reason to read the manpage for fstab
2012-09-01T11:03:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	you are just confusing him
2012-09-01T11:03:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	if getting the second option on a problem your trying to solve is confusing. Perhaps more learning is in order ... right clicking and adding just feeds the problem.
2012-09-01T11:04:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	ubuntu is not a system where the user must learn so much before he can use the system
2012-09-01T11:04:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	ubuntu is a system, ready to be used
2012-09-01T11:05:00.000Z	iceroot	diligentdino	can we move on?
2012-09-01T11:05:00.000Z	diligentdino	iceroot	yes
