2006-11-03T16:00:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	tell me tell me a bout hibernate
2006-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	fignew	mtymobile	what do you want to know?
2006-11-03T16:02:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	i have my laptop that when i try to hibernate (without suspend2patch) it takes like 10 minutes to write to disk
2006-11-03T16:02:00.000Z	fignew	mtymobile	is it actually writing, or just sitting there?
2006-11-03T16:03:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	hibernate works, it's just that it takes forever to write
2006-11-03T16:04:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	for instance: i leave the laptop to hibernate and take up to 20 min to actually turn off
2006-11-03T16:04:00.000Z	fignew	mtymobile	yes, but while it's taking forever, is it actually doing anything (is the HD light blinking?)
2006-11-03T16:04:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	yes
2006-11-03T16:05:00.000Z	fignew	mtymobile	1 sec
2006-11-03T16:07:00.000Z	fignew	mtymobile	what does sudo hdparm -tT /dev/hda
2006-11-03T16:07:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	some testing aye

2006-11-03T16:09:00.000Z	fignew	mtymobile	what about sudo hdparm -d /dev/hda
2006-11-03T16:10:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	using dma
2006-11-03T16:12:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	1 gb
2006-11-03T16:14:00.000Z	fignew	mtymobile	solution: use suspend instead :P (i'm stumped)
2006-11-03T16:15:00.000Z	mtymobile	fignew	but before installing xubuntu i used gentoo, and hibernate worked great and fast
