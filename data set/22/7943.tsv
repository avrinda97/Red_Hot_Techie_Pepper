2005-11-27T09:03:00.000Z	blanky		guys, you know how when you right click and do create new file > it says no templates instsalled yet? how can I install a template, so it says something like 'create new Xml file' or osmething
2005-11-27T09:05:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	that's pretty much a GNOME question. Could try #gnome
2005-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	I don't know if it's by default, but try `sudo apt-get install samba'
2005-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	blanky	redondos	thanks
2005-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	blanky	redondos	this will allow me to connect to my windows network, correct?
2005-11-27T09:11:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	no this will allow your windows network to connect to your ubuntu machine.
2005-11-27T09:11:00.000Z	blanky	redondos	ah okay, I thought it was the other way around.
2005-11-27T09:12:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	you probably already have a driver for that. try `mount //server/share /mnt/location -t cifs'
2005-11-27T09:12:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	that'd be samba+cups
2005-11-27T10:15:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	dpkg -l
2005-11-27T10:17:00.000Z	blanky	redondos	when I do that command, it lists tons of stuff and I cant scroll back up to see what it said at the very top, how can I make it so it it shows screenfuls at a time
2005-11-27T10:18:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	using a pager. you can use more, less, most... there may be more. so prefix that command with one of those words.
2005-11-27T10:19:00.000Z	blanky	redondos	so... less dpkg -i ?
2005-11-27T10:19:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	ehm, I said prefix, didn't I?
2005-11-27T10:19:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	heh, sorry mate. pipe it. dpkg -i | less
2005-11-27T10:20:00.000Z	blanky	redondos	that is weird, it just says END at the bottom
2005-11-27T10:20:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	that's because I just put dpkg -i instead of `dpkg -l | less'
2005-11-27T10:20:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	i'm a little tired :)
2005-11-27T10:21:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	I mean, today.
2005-11-27T10:22:00.000Z	blanky	redondos	I press space to show more right? thanks bud!
2005-11-27T10:23:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	or up/down pgup/pgdown k/j
2005-11-27T10:23:00.000Z	redondos	blanky	and np :)
