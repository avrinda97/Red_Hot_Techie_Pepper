2007-10-28T19:29:00.000Z	kuso		what does your fstab entry look like
2007-10-28T19:31:00.000Z	kuso		is the hard drive a slave or master
2007-10-28T19:31:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	htis is my master HDD, i'm on a laptop
2007-10-28T19:32:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	the /dev/sda3 is ok, i've just verify with gparted
2007-10-28T19:35:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	this is not working... too strange.... it worked one hour ago... dont know why...
2007-10-28T19:40:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	no problems, but this isnt a separated drive, the driver contains 2 parts
2007-10-28T19:42:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	: done this manually with the gutsy install cd, alternate
2007-10-28T19:43:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	: only resized the firt partition, format it, this was the system partition
2007-10-28T19:43:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	i dont think so... cause i really took care not to format this partition
2007-10-28T19:44:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	: made the important datas partition smaller, swap bigger, system bigger, free space redistributed
2007-10-28T19:45:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	: took care to verify that the partition was not marked as "to format"
2007-10-28T19:45:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	only get another with M$ on it...
2007-10-28T19:47:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	, is it possible to check all permission for a partition?
2007-10-28T19:48:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	this is a clean install, and thiswas sda before the new install, and gparted detects sda3
2007-10-28T19:50:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	u know if there is a way to verify rights for an ext 3 partition?
2007-10-28T19:51:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	goin to take a look
2007-10-28T19:53:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	seems ok... no permission problems...
2007-10-28T19:54:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	argh cant understand what is the f......... problem, and cannot see why it worked during 2 minutes...
2007-10-28T19:57:00.000Z	Kael68	kuso	could we talk together in private im?
