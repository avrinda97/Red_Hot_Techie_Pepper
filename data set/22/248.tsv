2012-02-23T18:55:00.000Z	rafalmi_		did anyone have problems with nvidia issue "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server."
2012-02-23T18:56:00.000Z	rafalmi_		and nvidia-settings shows this info above and contains only one tab with enable tool tips', 'display status bar' and three other similar option
2012-02-23T18:56:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	just follow what it says
2012-02-23T18:57:00.000Z	rafalmi_	NyLes	?
2012-02-23T18:57:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	open a terminal then type sudo nvidia-xconfig
2012-02-23T18:57:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	then reboot..
2012-02-23T18:57:00.000Z	rafalmi_	NyLes	heh I was doing it but I received black screen after that
2012-02-23T18:58:00.000Z	rafalmi_		after reboot
2012-02-23T18:58:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	what driver are you using now? nv? what is your video card?
2012-02-23T18:58:00.000Z	rafalmi_		I have GeForce GT520MX and Ubuntu 11.10
2012-02-23T18:59:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	can you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2012-02-23T19:00:00.000Z	rafalmi_		not now - I m on desktop now on job
2012-02-23T19:00:00.000Z	rafalmi_		have no access to my laptop now
2012-02-23T19:00:00.000Z	rafalmi_		anyway it shares with Intel inegrated card via using optimus technology
2012-02-23T19:01:00.000Z	rafalmi_		I have bumblle
2012-02-23T19:01:00.000Z	rafalmi_		and I have drivers from here
2012-02-23T19:01:00.000Z	rafalmi_		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
2012-02-23T19:03:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	im not familiar with ppas sorry
2012-02-23T19:04:00.000Z	rafalmi_		Nyles: it has nvidia-current with 295 driver version AFAIK
2012-02-23T19:05:00.000Z	rafalmi_	NyLes	maybe it doesn't work with optimus technology when Intel is used mostly
2012-02-23T19:06:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	maybe? but i think it's best to see the xorg.conf and xorg.0.log im having almost the same problem :)
2012-02-23T19:07:00.000Z	NyLes	rafalmi_	and finally solved it but not really because im jsut using nv drivers not nvidia..
