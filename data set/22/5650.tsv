2007-03-25T11:55:00.000Z	Afief		My system just crashed, when rebooting it says that my filesystem is corrupt. how can i save the files?
2007-03-25T11:55:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	Try booting with a rescue cd
2007-03-25T11:56:00.000Z	Afief	EightEleven	where do i get a rescue cd?
2007-03-25T11:56:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	Ubuntu Live CDs can be used as rescue cd.
2007-03-25T11:56:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	Knoppix CDs too
2007-03-25T11:57:00.000Z	Afief	EightEleven	okay it is booting, what should i do now?
2007-03-25T11:57:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	deceide if you can save your files on the network or on a usb-stick
2007-03-25T11:58:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	So you should use the rescue cd to make a backup of your files to a safe location.
2007-03-25T11:59:00.000Z	Afief	EightEleven	I have the important files backed up, I just don't want to format/reinstall ubuntu if that's possible
2007-03-25T12:01:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	You can try to manually repair your Ubuntu install form the rescue CD.
2007-03-25T12:01:00.000Z	Afief	EightEleven	how do i do that?
2007-03-25T12:01:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	First you have to find out what corrupted your filesystem.
2007-03-25T12:02:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	Can you read files from hda1 with the rescue cd?
2007-03-25T12:02:00.000Z	Afief	EightEleven	no
2007-03-25T12:03:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	What happened before your filesystem got corrupted?
2007-03-25T12:04:00.000Z	Afief	EightEleven	I was browsing the internet as usual and downloaded a PDF... dunno if that led to the failure though
2007-03-25T12:06:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	That should not be a problem.
2007-03-25T12:06:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	It might be hardware related.
2007-03-25T12:07:00.000Z	Afief	EightEleven	weird, the pc has been working well for ages. any suggestion how to fix it?
2007-03-25T12:07:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	Reinstalling Ubuntu (on ext3) might be the easiest sollution.
2007-03-25T12:12:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	You could ask your brother to transfer control over the computer to you.
2007-03-25T12:12:00.000Z	EightEleven	Afief	But that is also somewhat difficult to set-up
