2008-05-29T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	#ubuntu-offtopic, not here, thanks.
2008-06-01T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	update-alternatives --config editor
2008-06-01T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	also, set your EDITOR env var
2008-06-01T03:13:00.000Z	afallenhope	Flannel	how about virtual terminals? you know the CTRL + ALT + F1 those don't work for me
2008-06-09T04:38:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	What's the problem?
2008-06-09T04:41:00.000Z	afallenhope	Flannel	I don't know.. I was just wondering if that's normal lol
2008-06-09T04:42:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	You only have one kernel, so the .old links (which pointed to the older one), now are dangling symlinks.  It's usually a good idea to leave one old kernel around, since with the new one, you never know if you're going to find some showstopping regression
2008-06-09T04:43:00.000Z	afallenhope	Flannel	yeah but that's a lot of junk on my comp lol. I leave at least TWO kernels.. one that I know is STABLE and the other that is the "updated/latest"
2008-06-18T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	clean gets rid of deb files in your package cache, remove uninstalls packages
2008-07-16T12:18:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	Ahadiel: cool it
2008-08-17T14:33:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	php6th: please stop
2008-08-17T14:33:00.000Z	afallenhope	Flannel	I wasn't doing anything. so simmer.
2008-08-17T14:33:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	Its offtopic, if you want to continue, take it elsewhere.
2009-01-09T06:58:00.000Z	afallenhope	Flannel	http://pastebin.com/d5118611e I got that can I just rm -rf it?
2009-01-09T06:53:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	something like that, yes.
2009-01-09T06:53:00.000Z	afallenhope	Flannel	 kkz ty
2009-01-09T06:54:00.000Z	afallenhope	Flannel	should I --purge it too?
2009-01-09T06:54:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	purge will remove config files, so yes.  purge will be sure to get everything
2009-01-09T06:59:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	Are you currently using that kernel by any chacne?
2009-03-29T23:23:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	There is Xubuntu 8.04, yes.
2010-07-05T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	afallenhope	"Use largest freespace" or whatever auto-partition things should create a / and a swap partition
