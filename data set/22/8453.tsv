2005-08-09T10:29:00.000Z	whitefang		i guess its too much to ask to have guild wars run. :(
2005-08-09T10:29:00.000Z	whitefang		i even installed directx9 (i downloaded it from the MS site) through wine...
2005-08-09T10:30:00.000Z	whitefang		and its still telling me i don't have directx
2005-08-09T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whitefang	 thats scary.
2005-08-09T10:30:00.000Z	whitefang	Dr_Willis	have you played guild wars on linux?
2005-08-09T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whitefang	 guildwars is sayng that? you useing the free wine? I hear cedega can play guild wars.. it sort of worked for me.
2005-08-09T10:30:00.000Z	whitefang	Dr_Willis	did you get the commercial version?
2005-08-09T10:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whitefang	yes.
2005-08-09T10:31:00.000Z	whitefang	Dr_Willis	what kind of things did you have to do to get it to run, other than installing the package?
2005-08-09T10:31:00.000Z	whitefang		did it just run fine with cedega?
2005-08-09T10:31:00.000Z	whitefang		without any messing about?
2005-08-09T10:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whitefang	 ive never had ANYTHING run 'fine'  with cedega or wine.. almpost always some issues
2005-08-09T10:32:00.000Z	whitefang	Dr_Willis	well, was it playable?
2005-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whitefang	 barely :P but that was 2 mo ago or so..
2005-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	whitefang		but out of the box cedega ran it?
2005-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	whitefang		ie, you just installed cedega, and typed cedega Gw.exe
2005-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whitefang	 also if you got an ati card its nasty, and 64bit disrto made it a pain...
2005-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	whitefang		and it worked?
2005-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	whitefang		i have 32bit distro, and a geforce card.
2005-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whitefang	 it required a few command line options to cedega AND to guildwars i recall.
2005-08-09T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		like the -bigexe option, and i think theres a opengl option for guildwars.exe
2005-08-09T10:35:00.000Z	whitefang	Dr_Willis	any idea where i might find out what the opengl options is called?
