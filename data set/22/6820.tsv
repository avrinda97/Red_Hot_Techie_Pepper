2006-08-08T11:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 i thought it allready did
2006-08-08T11:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 or at least ive seen about every other live cd auto see/use swap partitions
2006-08-08T11:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 thats just the nature of live cd's
2006-08-08T11:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 you proberly want to use some alternative light window manager - like icewm, or fluxbox
2006-08-08T11:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 you may want to use some very-light disrto like 'dsl' or 'dsl-n'
2006-08-08T11:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 it will work.. but will be slow i bet..
2006-08-08T11:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 ive ran it on a low end laptop.. and it was annoying slow. but goahead and try it.
2006-08-08T11:24:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: mainly firefox
2006-08-08T11:25:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: its such a nice computer though, i want to do some sort of linux distro
2006-08-08T11:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 try it and see.  you could run firefox fullscreen with no window manager..
2006-08-08T11:25:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: that possible?
2006-08-08T11:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 ive ran firefox on miniomal systems.. it can work.. and it can be slow. so go try it and see if it works for you.
2006-08-08T11:27:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: right now xfce is doing quite well for a livecd
2006-08-08T11:27:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: the main issue is that i must install to a hard drive, then move the hard drive to these dummy computers without CD drives
2006-08-08T11:28:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: network card is not detected by ubuntu
2006-08-08T11:29:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: and i am not CLI skilled
2006-08-08T11:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 its a skill worth learning.
2006-08-08T11:29:00.000Z	HackMaster	dr_willis	burhan: i agree, but ugg
2006-08-08T11:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 on the xuntu alternatve cd - it is.
2006-08-08T11:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	HackMaster	 the normal alt cd. has Gnome, the xubuntu one has xfce.
