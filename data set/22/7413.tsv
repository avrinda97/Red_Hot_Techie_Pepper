2006-04-02T09:47:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	I should have 2 8-10Gb HD's with Ubuntu and one and nothing much on the other. It should be formatted for Ubuntu to use though....
2006-04-02T09:48:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	its not finding it
2006-04-02T09:48:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	Ok, well, it be physically connected to my 'puter, but I can't get Ubuntu to see it...
2006-04-02T09:48:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	does your BIOS see it?
2006-04-02T09:48:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	Yep...
2006-04-02T09:48:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	IDE channel 2 master?
2006-04-02T09:49:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	I have no idea what you just said. :)
2006-04-02T09:49:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	oh well its not on the same cable as the other 2 hard drives right?
2006-04-02T09:49:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	and you know your BIOS sees it?
2006-04-02T09:50:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	like what makes you say it sees it
2006-04-02T09:50:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	heh same thing I did
2006-04-02T09:51:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	In BIOS it shows a second Maxtor HD.  I have One Maxtor ~10G, One Quantum Bigfoot HD (also~10G), and this new Maxtor (30G?) I just connected.
2006-04-02T09:52:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	Oh, and my Yamaha CD Burner...
2006-04-02T09:52:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	I diconned my cd drive (nonburner) so I could fit the 30G HD in there...
2006-04-02T09:53:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	NickGarvey	Ack, I'd have to shutdown to check...
2006-04-02T09:53:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	eh not that important
2006-04-02T09:54:00.000Z	NickGarvey	unL33Tn00b	I'd try a boot CD and see if it sees it
