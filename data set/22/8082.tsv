2005-12-16T13:55:00.000Z	Josh43		can anyone tell me hot to make a small script that does this:  "mount /media/floppy0;mv part021.rar /media/floppy0;umount /media/floppy0", Wait for any key, " mount /media/floppy0;mv part022.rar /media/floppy0;umount /media/floppy0", wait for any key, do part 23, etc
2005-12-16T13:56:00.000Z	Josh43		sethk; ok, perfect, that helps alot - now I just need to know how to make it loop and count up by 1
2005-12-16T13:57:00.000Z	Josh43		_nano_; ask in #xubuntu :)
2005-12-16T13:59:00.000Z	Josh43		sethk; is it possible to just do a single command line? like regex (never used regex, but from what Ive seen..)
2005-12-16T14:01:00.000Z	Josh43		setsethk; would I do then "mv part[i] .rar" ?
2005-12-16T14:02:00.000Z	Josh43		sethk; would I do then "mv part[i] .rar" ?
2005-12-16T14:04:00.000Z	Josh43		sethk; ok, so I have for (i) incrementing, then how do I pull the 'i' variable into the commandline?
2005-12-16T14:06:00.000Z	Josh43		sethk; for ((i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1 )){ mount /media/floppy0;mv part(this is where I need numbers 1-125).rar /media/floppy0;umount /media/floppy0;read }
2005-12-16T14:08:00.000Z	Josh43		sethk; yeah, I'm used to php ;) the last part of the equation then is how do I fill in the value for 'i' (from the for loop) into 'mv partXX.rar'?
2005-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	Put your script as is on www.pastebin.com with bash formatting
2005-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	Josh43	SEJeff	http://pastebin.com/459892
2005-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	Josh43	SEJeff	Tho, honestly; I've never made a bash script before :)
2005-12-16T14:17:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	http://pastebin.com/459900 Maybe this would work better?
2005-12-16T14:18:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	If you come from a programming background, I *highly* suggest the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/
2005-12-16T14:21:00.000Z	Josh43	SEJeff	that looks like that would work great - would moving to cp instead of move break the script tho? and last q: how can I make it pause after each file
2005-12-16T14:24:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	sleep 10 will make it sleep 10 seconds
2005-12-16T14:24:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	add something like this on a line
2005-12-16T14:24:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	echo "Pausing..." && sleep 10
2005-12-16T14:25:00.000Z	Josh43	SEJeff	hrm.. normally I would say great, but I can't babysit it :( Is there any way to wait for input?
2005-12-16T14:26:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	http://pastebin.com/459922 Try this out
2005-12-16T14:28:00.000Z	Josh43	SEJeff	Ahhh - Perfect :)
2005-12-16T14:28:00.000Z	SEJeff	Josh43	Glad to help :)
