2008-05-13T10:12:00.000Z	ArrowLance		im having a problem keeping ubuntu(8.04) working, i had it set up to dual boot (twice) with XP, but if i let my computer idle on ubuntu over night, i wake up to a black screen, and ubuntu will no longer load
2008-05-13T10:13:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	what state is the system left in?
2008-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	I meant, what things was the system doing when you left it functioning properly?
2008-05-13T10:15:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	are you saying the system won't boot up again when powered-on?  or has the system gone into suspend but won't come out?
2008-05-13T10:16:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	wow... that isn't normal at all.  Are Windows and Ubuntu on the same hard drive?
2008-05-13T10:16:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	how are you getting it to boot into windows?
2008-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	if menu.lst isn't found, then I'm kinda confused...
2008-05-13T10:19:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	it sounds like you might have two copies of grub installed..  probably from both attempts at install
2008-05-13T10:19:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	that's possible.  You could just be seeing the swap or maybe just the home
2008-05-13T10:20:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	Windows isn't very good at seeing filesystems it doesn't know how to read.
2008-05-13T10:20:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	Part of the boot process for Ubuntu involves a UUID for root being sent to the kernel..  That UUID being sent may be the wrong one if you have two grubs
2008-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	devilsadvocate:  It's also possible that an EISA partition and BIOS masking of such would cause problems with loading GRUB
2008-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	significantly
2008-05-13T10:24:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	I have encountered one power-off problem with Ubuntu, but it's never caused a problem like that.
2008-05-13T10:25:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	that's not to say it's impossible, just highly unlikely
2008-05-13T10:27:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	just don't use wubi this time.  try it pure from CD
2008-05-13T10:27:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	alternate if you're really paranoid
2008-05-13T10:31:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	do you have a spare computer on your network?
2008-05-13T10:32:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	you could set up a server to do RPL or PXE and load the setup that way
2008-05-13T10:33:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	listen to devilsadvocate..
2008-05-13T10:33:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	there's also install from a flash drive
2008-05-13T10:34:00.000Z	MikeCulver	ArrowLance	repeated defragging can help and my be necessary.  but free up as much space as you can before defrag
