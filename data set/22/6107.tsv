2006-12-19T07:46:00.000Z	seravitae		hello there
2006-12-19T07:46:00.000Z	seravitae		hi r3tex :)
2006-12-19T07:47:00.000Z	seravitae		absolutely
2006-12-19T07:47:00.000Z	seravitae		only linux distribution i consider 'usable'
2006-12-19T07:47:00.000Z	rapid	seravitae	^^
2006-12-19T07:48:00.000Z	seravitae		heh, nothings wrong with them, but at least for me, an average guy, ubuntu 'just works'
2006-12-19T07:48:00.000Z	seravitae		except the odd hiccup, which is why i hear :)
2006-12-19T07:48:00.000Z	seravitae		why i'm here*
2006-12-19T07:48:00.000Z	seravitae		i am trying to compile a webcam driver that some guys wrote for my particular chipset and i'm having the following difficulty: when running make, i get this error: make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-386/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.make: *** [default]  Error 2
2006-12-19T07:48:00.000Z	seravitae		i'm wondering if i'm missing something.
2006-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	seravitae		like build-tools?
2006-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	rapid	seravitae	you haven't set the buildpath probably
2006-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	seravitae		ok
2006-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	seravitae		i have build-essential
2006-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	seravitae		rapid - i'm not sure what the correct buildpath should be. is there a way to locate it?
2006-12-19T07:50:00.000Z	rapid	seravitae	are there any docs with the driver?
2006-12-19T07:50:00.000Z	seravitae		rapid - unfortunately not, because it was a reverse-engerineered project.
2006-12-19T07:50:00.000Z	seravitae		I can however link you to the website which contains the driver, but i have scoured it for 'installation' documents with no luck
2006-12-19T07:51:00.000Z	rapid	seravitae	check the makefile, and see what dir you have similar to the one i nthe error
2006-12-19T07:51:00.000Z	rapid		then modify and try remake
2006-12-19T07:51:00.000Z	rapid		thats what I would do
2006-12-19T07:52:00.000Z	seravitae	rapid	yeah, there's no build dir in there.. or in any of the /lib/modules/ dirs
