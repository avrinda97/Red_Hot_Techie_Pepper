2009-09-13T03:54:00.000Z	saji		Hi.. I'm using ubuntu 9.04.. How will i upgrade my display driver manually to support my Intel graphics card better? Heard that a better driver is available, as the one in Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha...
2009-09-13T03:55:00.000Z	saji		Please help me.... Anybody....
2009-09-13T03:55:00.000Z	twright	saji	I am on karmic now and it is a lot better. You could either wait or go through the risks of running the alpha.
2009-09-13T03:58:00.000Z	saji	twright	there is some manual way to upgrade the intel driver.
2009-09-13T03:59:00.000Z	twright	saji	there is one on the forums but installing the newer drivers on karmic is probably more risky then trying karmic
2009-09-13T04:00:00.000Z	twright	saji	try looking at this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1130582
2009-09-13T04:06:00.000Z	saji	twright	sorry for interrupting you but what i want to know is about new intel drivers for jaunty and not KArmic
2009-09-13T04:06:00.000Z	twright	saji	yes
2009-09-13T04:07:00.000Z	saji	twright	so?
2009-09-13T04:08:00.000Z	twright	saji	ok, this link should get you them http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1130582
2009-09-13T04:08:00.000Z	saji	twright	thanks.... i'll try...
2009-09-13T04:09:00.000Z	twright	saji	if you go through tutorial going up to C should give you what you want
2009-09-13T04:10:00.000Z	saji	twright	did you mean part-C?
2009-09-13T04:10:00.000Z	twright	saji	yep although you can do as much or as  little as your system requires
2009-09-13T04:13:00.000Z	twright	saji	the more steps you do the faster it should be but the less well tested (newer) so if you need your system to be stable do not do too much
2009-09-13T04:13:00.000Z	twright	saji	that said step D is the only one likely to cause big problems
2009-09-13T04:14:00.000Z	saji	twright	ok i got that.. Well my aim is to run the compiz-fusion with better performance... So, till which step do you suggest?
2009-09-13T04:16:00.000Z	twright	saji	I would go up to b as and go further if it still slow
2009-09-13T04:16:00.000Z	saji	twright	i think now i understood.... Thanks....
2009-09-13T04:17:00.000Z	twright	saji	good luck - the performance is a lot better (for me at least) with the new driver
2009-09-13T04:18:00.000Z	saji	twright	should i take any backup before doing this upgradation?
2009-09-13T04:19:00.000Z	twright	saji	it should not impact your data but in the worst case you will be left in text only mode so it might be a good idea :-)
