2005-04-12T11:05:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	^^
2005-04-12T11:05:00.000Z	fabbione	lunitik	not necessrely
2005-04-12T11:06:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	that was the impression I was under... Ubuntu kernels are 'linux-blah-foo' and Debian's (Universe) was 'kernel-blah-foo'...
2005-04-12T11:07:00.000Z	fabbione	lunitik	as crimsun says
2005-04-12T11:08:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	/me shuts up after looking @ maintainer line
2005-04-12T11:10:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	grr... should have like a 'test' or something in the ubuntu part of the name if they are not in main...
2005-04-12T11:10:00.000Z	fabbione	lunitik	if they are not in main, they are not supported. the separation is clear
2005-04-12T11:11:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	except for those that have universe enabled... and recognize prior naming schemes...
2005-04-12T11:11:00.000Z	fabbione	lunitik	name scheme has nothing to do with main/universe
2005-04-12T11:11:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	I have taken it for granted for 6 months that kernel-*-* was Debian and linux-*-* was Ubuntu... and that the ubuntu one was supported...
2005-04-12T11:12:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	its a few letters to add to the package name  *shrug* .
2005-04-12T11:12:00.000Z	fabbione	lunitik	we are allowed to add unsupported packages.. you know? ;)
2005-04-12T11:13:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	not the point... I didn't see that it was in Universe till just now... I assumed via naming scheme that it was...
2005-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	hey... what did you do to -5  ;)
2005-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	come again  :)
2005-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	heh... here, complains about not loading VFS ... -4 still works though
2005-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	lunitik	fabbione	(kernel version, I should probably say that  :P )
