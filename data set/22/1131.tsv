2010-09-26T20:45:00.000Z	ehcah		which is better for your system, Hybernate or Suspend? I know one uses RAM and the other the HD. Which is best for HTPC usage?
2010-09-26T20:45:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	suspend to ram, it's the best
2010-09-26T20:47:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	the new suspend-to-ram can turn off the cpu and fans
2010-09-26T20:48:00.000Z	ehcah	headstrong	It also seams to turn off USB. I wanted to use my handheld remote to turn it back on.  :(
2010-09-26T20:49:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	no, the usb is powered
2010-09-26T20:49:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	no, this is the s3 of new rigs
2010-09-26T20:49:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	your box is too old
2010-09-26T20:50:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	maybe it's bios's acpi is too old
2010-09-26T20:51:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	the bios matters
2010-09-26T20:51:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	be careful to choose your mobo maker
2010-09-26T20:53:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	you seem use a asus mobo
2010-09-26T20:54:00.000Z	ehcah	headstrong	not sure if it matters, but all of the "enabling" I did in /proc/acpi/wakeup are no longer enabled?
2010-09-26T20:55:00.000Z	ehcah	headstrong	I could be wrong, but I beleive USB2 and PWRB in my case should both be "enabled"?
2010-09-26T20:55:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	did you use 'echo' to enable them?
2010-09-26T20:57:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	but they don't work cause of your asus bios's acpi '2.0'?
2010-09-26T20:58:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	i guess, it's bios. because my bios is ok
2010-09-26T20:58:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	maybe you can cure that by a bios upgrade
2010-09-26T20:59:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	maybe not
2010-09-26T21:07:00.000Z	ehcah	headstrong	Is there a specific way I should be adding this:  /etc/rc.local: echo USB2 > /proc/acpi/wakeup
2010-09-26T21:08:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	that won't work, iirc
2010-09-26T22:00:00.000Z	ehcah	headstrong	If you are still there... my BIOS has ACPI Version Featurs; V1.0, V2.0 and V3.0. By default, it is V1.0?
2010-09-26T22:01:00.000Z	headstrong	ehcah	i don't know
