2010-04-29T21:56:00.000Z	weekly		hey guys, im stuck in a "$" -sh command promp and i want to log out "logout" doesnt work, how do i get out of it?
2010-04-29T21:56:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	exit?
2010-04-29T21:56:00.000Z	weekly	mournkaye	thanks!! it worked
2010-04-29T21:58:00.000Z	weekly		the /bin/sh is just another BASH type deal right?
2010-04-29T21:58:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	it was the original basis for bash from the year 1605, yes - bash without all the features ;-)
2010-04-29T22:03:00.000Z	weekly		ok guys so im having trouble running a .run file to install files needed to run my q3 server, i looked it up and it said to try and emulate it to 32 bit with "linux32" command, but the install still fails, what flags with the "linux32" command could i try?
2010-04-29T22:05:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	you might need to install some 32-bit compatability libs, what's the exact problem you're seeing?
2010-04-29T22:05:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	apt-get install ia32-libs
2010-04-29T22:07:00.000Z	weekly	mournkaye	it spits out "This installation doesn't support glibc-2.1 on Linux / unknown"
2010-04-29T22:08:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	oh :( dunno then, sorry
2010-04-29T22:08:00.000Z	weekly	mournkaye	do you know the names of the packages your talking about?
2010-04-29T22:08:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	ia32-libs, but I'm not sure they'll help now :(
2010-04-29T22:09:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	I'd hassle whoever made your .run file :)
2010-04-29T22:10:00.000Z	weekly	mournkaye	yeah, ill install that 32bit compatibility file and see what happens, thanks for the great help/suggestions
2010-04-29T22:10:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	good luck!
2010-04-29T22:11:00.000Z	weekly	mournkaye	is there a way to only extract the files out of a .run so i could place them manually instaed of letting the .run do it?
2010-04-29T22:12:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	well, you could experiment with editing the file (the first 10 lines are likely to be a shell script to unpack the rest of the data) and removing any lines that look like they're *running* anything
2010-04-29T22:13:00.000Z	weekly	mournkaye	i can edit the .run in something like pico, right?
2010-04-29T22:14:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	yeah probably, those kind of files are usually a few lines of shell script then a big bunch of binary data right beaneath it
2010-04-29T22:14:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	you might be able to get *just* the data and unpack it
2010-04-29T22:14:00.000Z	weekly	mournkaye	awsome, thanks for the help again!
2010-04-29T22:15:00.000Z	mournkaye	weekly	good luck!
