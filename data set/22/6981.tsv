2008-09-22T20:25:00.000Z	ChrizC		hi, I just got my CD for 8.04 LTS desktop in the post today, I opened it, slapped it into my drive, rebooted the computer to go into auto-install, and about 5-10mins into the install, a lot of text comes up, saying "zlib_inflate" or something like that failed. I checked the cd for defects and it said 2 files had errors. Any help so I can install it asap?
2008-09-22T20:25:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	use another disc
2008-09-22T20:25:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; impossible.
2008-09-22T20:25:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	it's impossible to use this one if it has defects.
2008-09-22T20:26:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; it's also impossible to install Ubuntu from a non-exsistant disc.
2008-09-22T20:26:00.000Z	ChrizC		_Zeus_; so you're saying that the company Ubuntu has teamed up with, provides bad discs?
2008-09-22T20:27:00.000Z	ChrizC	_Zeus_	From Ubuntu's "Request a free CD" page.
2008-09-22T20:27:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	I've gotten a couple of bad discs, yeah.  Why can't you install ubuntu another way?
2008-09-22T20:27:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; my cd drive doesn't like to burn ISO's properly, for some reason.
2008-09-22T20:28:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	there are other ways, check ubottu's link.  You can also find a LoCo or LUG in your area that will burn a disc for you
2008-09-22T20:28:00.000Z	jrib		!install > ChrizC
2008-09-22T20:28:00.000Z	ChrizC		for god sakes, stop the highlights ¬¬
2008-09-22T20:28:00.000Z	ChrizC	_Zeus_	my drive won't burn ISO's properly.
2008-09-22T20:28:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	this channel has over 1000 users. You need to highlight people you are having a conversation with
2008-09-22T20:29:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; I can't download it, I can't torrent it, no one in my local area likes Linux, so won't burn it, and the CD's take too long to get here for me to order another one.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	you can purchase one from amazon as well
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		_Zeus_; Southwest.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; I'm not paying for something I can get for free, lols.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	what state?
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; the good ol' united kingdom.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		Obviously not, _Zeus_, seeing as I'm on this IRC channel ¬¬
2008-09-22T20:31:00.000Z	jrib	ChrizC	there's a big ubuntu community in the UK.  Try #ubuntu-uk
