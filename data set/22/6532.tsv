2006-09-30T15:32:00.000Z	takuhii		what is your malfunction man
2006-09-30T15:32:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	sudo route    and see if the default gateway ip addess is there
2006-09-30T15:34:00.000Z	takuhii	green_earz	I'm trying the route now
2006-09-30T15:35:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	on my machine it returns              default         192.168.0.1
2006-09-30T15:38:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	now use the command : sudo ifconfig   to see if the ethernet card as a ip address. by the look of thing it will not
2006-09-30T15:41:00.000Z	takuhii	green_earz	I got 127.0.0.1 as the ip and the mask is 255.0.0.0. I know this to be a return to sender addy, should this information have anything about my network card? cause I don't see any mention of netgear or anything
2006-09-30T15:43:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	 so it look like the driver for the pci ethernet card is not installed.  do a lscpi -v  for the info of what the ether card is
2006-09-30T15:47:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	sorry its  :   lspci -v
2006-09-30T15:48:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	look for " Ethernet controller "
2006-09-30T15:53:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	lspci -v | grep Ethernet        may be better to veiw
2006-09-30T15:53:00.000Z	green_earz	takuhii	its a very handy tool
2006-09-30T15:54:00.000Z	takuhii	green_earz	returned nothing
