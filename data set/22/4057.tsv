2009-04-24T00:59:00.000Z	Dada_		Hi there. I'm trying the new Ubuntu in a virtual machine. Apparently the user is logged out immediately after the boot is  complete. It's now looping between logging in the Live CD user and returning to the login screen. This a known problem? :)
2009-04-24T01:00:00.000Z	alinon	Dada_	why use virtualmachine? that's not a natural environment
2009-04-24T01:00:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	not natural environment, sure, but no other version has done that.
2009-04-24T01:00:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	actually, "not natural environment" is sort of a moot point, don't you think?
2009-04-24T01:01:00.000Z	alinon	Dada_	if the devs don't develope it for that intended virtual hardware, then nuff said
2009-04-24T01:01:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	that's a bit of an easy way to talk yourself out of a very strange error that occurs only with the latest Ubuntu.
2009-04-24T01:02:00.000Z	Dada_		By the way, the new installer looks amazing guys.
2009-04-24T01:02:00.000Z	Dada_		Also, I see that the text anti-aliasing is now under different default settings, BIG +1 frmo me
2009-04-24T01:03:00.000Z	alinon	Dada_	feel however you want about it, but if you try submit a bug on launchpad, i'm sure you'll be ignored o.o
2009-04-24T01:04:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	I'm not sure about that! Users should be able to expect that there are no serious system breaking defects in virtualized hardware, right? It's not like Ubuntu is developed "only for real hardware", especially since virtualization is rather popular in some settings.
2009-04-24T01:04:00.000Z	alinon	Dada_	they created the livecd for a reason, there's no reason to use anything else
2009-04-24T01:05:00.000Z	alinon		if you are just wanting to test your hardware that is
2009-04-24T01:05:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	look, regardless, my argument is that it doesn't work and yours is that you don't care about my use case. I don't think the developers would make that argument!
2009-04-24T01:06:00.000Z	alinon	Dada_	i highly doubt they would aknowledge it at all haha
2009-04-24T01:06:00.000Z	alinon		but opinions are like allot of things, everyone has one
2009-04-24T01:07:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	actually, there are plenty of virtualization tickets in the Launchpad which have importance tags and committed fixes.
2009-04-24T01:07:00.000Z	alinon		here's a cookie hehe
2009-04-24T01:08:00.000Z	alinon		while your there, submit a ticket of your own or find one that's already been submitted for the issue
2009-04-24T01:09:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	by the way, 666 pages matching my virtualization software in Launchpad (coincidence? :)
2009-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	alinon	Dada_	like i said...here's a cookie :) and while your there find a ticket that relates to your problem or submit your own =D
2009-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	alinon		Geez!
2009-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	Dada_	alinon	yes
