2006-11-16T08:27:00.000Z	ndlovu		hi all. after logging into gnome, my session freezes just after entering my password. All I'm left with is a brown desktop and a mouse pointer. I can run a failsafe terminal, it seems, but not much else. any ideas how to fix it?
2006-11-16T08:29:00.000Z	ndlovu		is there some way to reset my gnome profile so that it loads properly?
2006-11-16T08:29:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	when logging in, choose 'gnome default' as your session
2006-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	I've tried that and it still does exactly the same thing
2006-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	what happens when you login with the default session?
2006-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	anything revealing in ~/.xsession-errors ?
2006-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	ooh, that sounds like the sort of place I want to look
2006-11-16T08:37:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	there doesn't seem to be anything there ringing alarm bells
2006-11-16T08:42:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	copying settings files is likely to cause the same problem again. do you get the splash screen come up?
2006-11-16T08:42:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	the gdm comes up, but not the splash screen showing what's loading up
2006-11-16T08:43:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	if copying settings files causes the same problem, could I not just find the right file to delete and "get rid of the problem"
2006-11-16T08:44:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	in theory, yep :)
2006-11-16T08:46:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	does /usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop have exec=/usr/bin/gnome-session ?
2006-11-16T08:47:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	yup
2006-11-16T08:49:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	if you login using the failsafe terminal session and run 'gnome-session' in the terminal, does that throw up any ideas?
2006-11-16T08:51:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	I'll give it a go. I'll have to exit xchat though (cos it's running from failsafe terminal), so will let you know in a few minutes
2006-11-16T08:51:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	thanks for the troubleshooting suggestions, btw, I appreciate it!
2006-11-16T09:01:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	minimec, both gnome-session and logging in as a different user gave the same problem :(. Maybe reinstalling gnome is the way to go?
2006-11-16T09:02:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	it certainly dosen't sound healthy. reinstalling gnome cant hurt :o
2006-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	would 'sudo apt-get install -reinstall gnome' do the trick, or is it something like 'ubuntu-desktop' that I need to reinstall?
2006-11-16T09:05:00.000Z	mooey	ndlovu	i'm not sure what package to recommend reinstalling tbh :\
2006-11-16T09:07:00.000Z	ndlovu	mooey	thanks for your help!
