2009-11-05T15:55:00.000Z	NeoCicak		hello.. am i the only one who feel that 9.10 boot time is a lot slower than 9.04??
2009-11-05T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	mines faster in karmic, mind you I dont reboot much
2009-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	hmm. ok... somehow i feel that it is a lot slower
2009-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	if you run:   dmesg | less    look at the times on the left as you scroll, if there are any big jumps in time, that is your issue
2009-11-05T15:58:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	: 0.003144 <--- does this mean 0.003144 secs?
2009-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	the left of the decimal place is seconds
2009-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	: thx!
2009-11-20T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	runs fine here, is your system fairly fast or is it like mine and a dinosaur
2009-11-20T19:47:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	its fairly fast......... and it was ok with 9.04... btw..... its just the boot up time that is ridiculously slow....... and logging in to gnome is like talking to my grandma
2009-11-20T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	some have said that, its meant to be sped / speeded (never worked that one out and I'm english) up though
2009-11-20T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	have a read through:   dmesg | less     and note the time on the left side, big gaps show you where problems are
2009-11-20T19:48:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	really? is there some sort of doco that explains how to do this 'speed up' ?
2009-11-20T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	not sure, i havent dug around that way much as i just let it do its thing
2009-11-20T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	slow boot can definately be diagnosed with dmes though
2009-11-20T19:51:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	hmmm... authenticating with wlan0
2009-11-20T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	don't flood dude, use pastebin
2009-11-20T19:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	looks like your wifi driver is slowing down the show, you can run:   sudo lshw -C network   to find the chip and find some guides to get you righted
2009-11-20T19:53:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	hmmm.. this doesnt happen in 9.04 though......
2009-11-20T19:53:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	and it is slow only on cold login..
2009-11-20T19:53:00.000Z	NeoCicak	ActionParsnip	i.e. if i log out now, and log back in.. its quite snappy
2009-11-20T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	different kernel dude, may even be a bug with the module it uses
2009-11-20T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NeoCicak	9.04 uses 9.04 kernel and 9.04 kernel modules, karmic uses a different kernel and modules
