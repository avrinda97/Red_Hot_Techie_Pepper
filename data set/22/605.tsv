2011-06-26T17:01:00.000Z	Neohasreturned		Hi all noob here could someone tell me if there is a program that enables you to have a virtual cd drive a bit like daemon tools virtual drive by elby?
2011-06-26T17:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	Neohasreturned	 you can mount iso files to a directory. no special tools needed
2011-06-26T17:02:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	Is there an easy way to do it?
2011-06-26T17:03:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	What I'm trying to do is test different distros in vbox without burning the isos
2011-06-26T17:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	Neohasreturned	 vbox has that feature built in.. no need to do ANY of this ...
2011-06-26T17:05:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	I didn't realise it did that
2011-06-26T17:05:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	Easier to use than vmware tho
2011-06-26T17:06:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	I will try it thanks
2011-06-26T17:07:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	Thanks alot you wouldn't happen to know what is the best program to rip audio cds I have tried some and they rip very low or to WAV
2011-06-26T17:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Neohasreturned	 most are front ends to the command line tools..  so they can be cofngired to do what you want.
2011-06-26T17:10:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	I have come across programs that rip cds but only very low mp3 quality
2011-06-26T17:12:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	lol I like high quality music on my ipod without as much loss quality as flac lol
2011-06-26T17:18:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	When I used to use mint there was a program called preload which would speed up bootup and performance but I can't see it on here is there any other program you can think of?
2011-06-26T17:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Neohasreturned	 ive vaguly recall it mentioned befor. but never tried it or worried about it.
2011-06-26T17:20:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	it was called preload on mint so I would have thought beens mint was based on ubuntu
2011-06-26T17:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Neohasreturned	 package name is 'preload' it seems...
2011-06-26T17:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Neohasreturned	 i dont see much point in not installing them.. :)
2011-06-26T17:24:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	It appears I did when I installed Ubuntu but I am on software centre and come across and it shows use this source?
2011-06-26T17:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Neohasreturned	 no idea. ive never installed it afterwards
2011-06-26T17:26:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	What is gstreamer?
2011-06-26T17:35:00.000Z	Neohasreturned	dr_willis	Then convert to flac lol
