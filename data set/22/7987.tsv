2005-11-09T13:46:00.000Z	sryan		I'm confused..
2005-11-09T13:46:00.000Z	sryan		Someone got a second for a newbie? :(
2005-11-09T13:46:00.000Z	sryan		configure: error: "cannot find libjpeg support"
2005-11-09T13:46:00.000Z	sryan		root@argon:/home/sryan/Desktop/hpijs-2.1.4#
2005-11-09T13:46:00.000Z	sryan		How would I solve that issue?
2005-11-09T13:46:00.000Z	sryan		I tried apt-get install libjpeg but that didn't cut it.
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sryan	what are you compilingand why?
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	sryan		Hopefully, going to compile drivers for my HP laserjet 4 plus.
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	sryan		Everything I tried that came with Ubuntu hasn't worked.
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	sryan		I'm trying to install the HP drivers...
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	sryan		but, they're bombing out due to no libjpeg support.
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sryan	should be included by default - I have a laserjet 6L here
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	sryan		They are, but they're not working for some reason.
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	sryan		I mean, the command gets to the printer but it's garbage that prints.
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	sryan		I tried everything driver available for it. :(
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sryan	try a different driver
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	sryan	thoreauputic	 I tried all of em!
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	sryan		that's why I wanna get this HP driver from HP to maybe work.
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sryan	:(
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	sryan		heh.
2005-11-09T13:49:00.000Z	sryan		Gotta be an apt-get for libjpeg i would assume..
2005-11-09T13:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sryan	it would be a -dev package
