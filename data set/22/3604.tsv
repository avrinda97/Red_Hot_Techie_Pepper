2008-08-05T19:10:00.000Z	db92		okay so im one of the unlucky lads who have an x-fi card, the one with no support in ubuntu. there is the oss driver that works for it and there was a beta x-fi driver release to use with alsa. i managed to install the beta x-fi driver but it only does recording. i know that if i install oss i will manage to get playback, as i managed @ my previous ubuntu installation. the question is, is it possible to have both drivers coexist and use on
2008-08-05T19:10:00.000Z	db92		e for recording and the other for playback? (please highlight if you answer cos i get lost in the text >>)
2008-08-05T19:12:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	db92	i would think so
2008-08-05T19:12:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	db92	have oss for playback and have the x-fi driver for recording
2008-08-05T19:13:00.000Z	db92	debian_akroyd	ye but i am faced with a problem with that
2008-08-05T19:13:00.000Z	db92	debian_akroyd	what if i have a program that cant choose both at the same time and i have the same app for recording and playback? :P
2008-08-05T19:13:00.000Z	db92	debian_akroyd	take skype for example :p
2008-08-05T19:14:00.000Z	db92	debian_akroyd	needs both to record && to playback the messages of others :p
2008-08-05T19:14:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	db92	cant you jsut use the oss driver for recording? or does your card not support that?
2008-08-05T19:14:00.000Z	db92	debian_akroyd	i tried but i think its mainly a matter of config
2008-08-05T19:14:00.000Z	db92	debian_akroyd	no one ever helped me setup oss for recording
2008-08-05T19:15:00.000Z	db92	debian_akroyd	ive been asking for plenty of days straight in this chan :P
