2007-11-07T18:58:00.000Z	Blinny		I have a Gutsy-server box and I'd like to install ubuntu-desktop from my gutsy-desktop CDrom. I'm at the command line. How do I add the CD as a source and pull the appropriate packages from it, rather than from the Internet?
2007-11-07T18:59:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	you can't use the Desktop CD as a package source -- only the Alternate CD
2007-11-07T19:00:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	I think this is the alternate CD - I downloaded it originally to install on a low-ram machine.
2007-11-07T19:00:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	Is there a way to verify whether it's an alternate source?
2007-11-07T19:02:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	at the top of /etc/apt/sources.list, there should be a commented sample of how to include a CD repository.
2007-11-07T19:02:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	Does the label need to be exact? (the part between [ and ] ) ?
2007-11-07T19:03:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	I think so
2007-11-07T19:04:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	I've added " deb cdrom:[Ubuntu-Desktop 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - i386]/ gutsy main restricted "  to my sources.list. Look right?
2007-11-07T19:05:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	I don't think so -- not if it's an Alternate CD
2007-11-07T19:05:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	Poop.
2007-11-07T19:06:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	/cdrom/README.diskdefines has "#define DISKNAME  Ubuntu 7.10 "Gutsy Gibbon" - Release i386" in it .. use that string?
2007-11-07T19:07:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	I'm really out of my depth. neil_d might no, or put the question to the channel.
2007-11-07T19:07:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	Thanks.
2007-11-07T19:20:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	have you seen the section at the bottom of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FeistyUpgrades ?
2007-12-09T01:34:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	see if there is a BIOS setup option to make the PCI card the primary video adapter
2007-12-09T01:35:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	There is. This only occurs when I set it to PCI.
2007-12-09T01:35:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	Right now I'm using the onboard.
2007-12-09T01:35:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	so you've exhausted that?
2007-12-09T01:36:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	You mean.. plugging the monitor into the correct one and changing the BIOS?
2007-12-09T01:37:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	I would also check if there is still video output from the onboard connector, in spite of setting everything to the NVidia card.
2007-12-09T01:37:00.000Z	soundray	Blinny	it could well be that your problem is at a lower level
2007-12-09T01:37:00.000Z	Blinny	soundray	That would have to be an Ubuntu problem then - I believe the BIOS switch turns the device off
