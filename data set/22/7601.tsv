2006-03-01T11:37:00.000Z	asterisk99		Anyone here able to answer a dumb permissions problem??? :)
2006-03-01T11:37:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	just ask
2006-03-01T11:40:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	what directory did you change?
2006-03-01T13:15:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	that reminds me, I have to make one.  What directory did you chmod?
2006-03-01T13:16:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	I created a user (call him 'foobar') ... and created a bunch of folders & files under /home/foobar ... did chown foobar:foobar for all the files in /user/foobar/*
2006-03-01T13:18:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	That was OK, but I wanted to be able to edit files in those directories using my master account (the one I use to login) ... I could only ger Read-Only for those files, soooooo I did a chmod +w ... that didn;t work... I did a chmod 777... then things got screwy
2006-03-01T13:18:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	that shoudln't cause problems, what was it again that happened?
2006-03-01T13:19:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	ah
2006-03-01T13:19:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	expand on ``screwy''
2006-03-01T13:20:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	No the dates/permissions/types are all Unknow in File Browser... even my directories show up with the "footprint" icon and no longer the file-folder icon
2006-03-01T13:20:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	In fact, all files and directories show up that way
2006-03-01T13:21:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	can't you just make a new user and copy over the documents from the other one, probably easier than getting to the source of the problem and I have no idea where to start
2006-03-01T13:22:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	Hmmmmm. Probably. I would love to understand how I screwed it up .... so that I don;t make a repeat performance of my dumb-assedness
2006-03-01T13:22:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	I don't think that should cause problems actually, other than the fact that it is kind of unsafe
2006-03-01T13:23:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	I think I'll create a new user and try it...
2006-03-01T13:23:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	you can *try* to delete the ~/.gnome2 and ~/.gnome directories
2006-03-01T13:57:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	OK. I renamed /home/foobar to /home/foobarOLD ; then created whole new directory /home/foobar plus files and subdirectories ; did a chown -R foobar:foobar /home.foobar ; now I want to edit files in /home/foobar ...  chmod 666 lets me gedit the file ... but when I get File could not be saved
2006-03-01T13:59:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	I think you need the right permissions on the folder
2006-03-01T13:59:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	chmod 666 not do?
2006-03-01T14:00:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	you did chmod 666 filetoedit, right?
2006-03-01T14:00:00.000Z	asterisk99	_jason	yes
2006-03-01T14:04:00.000Z	_jason	asterisk99	not sure, I haven't had a need to really do something like that.  What I would do is create a group and then set permissions like that
