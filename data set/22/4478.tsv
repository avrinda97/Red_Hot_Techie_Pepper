2008-01-22T04:03:00.000Z	debatem1		hey all, my company just allocated a small budget for funding open source projects. *besides ubuntu* where do you think we should point it to do the most good?
2008-01-22T04:05:00.000Z	debatem1		aloha_: lol
2008-01-22T04:07:00.000Z	debatem1		we have a small budget for funding open source projects. *besides ubuntu* where do you guys think we should point it to do the most good?
2008-01-22T04:08:00.000Z	debatem1		seveas, aloha: do you think its smarter to donate to larger or smaller projects? i wasnt sure
2008-01-22T04:09:00.000Z	debatem1		aloha: I just don't really know who needs the cash the most, you know?
2008-01-22T04:11:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	Wikimedia
2008-01-22T04:11:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	yes, Gnash
2008-01-22T04:15:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	oh, also, check out the Uira project. It's for flash creating in Linux
2008-01-22T04:16:00.000Z	debatem1	syntaxerror55	thank you, that looks very interesting
2008-01-22T04:17:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	then Uira. It's the only one of it's kind.
2008-01-22T04:18:00.000Z	debatem1	syntaxerror55	yeah, that one's looking quite promising
2008-01-22T04:20:00.000Z	debatem1	syntaxerror55	urg. uira's shut down.
2008-01-22T04:20:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	really? They've come such a long way since I last checked them in '06 ;;
2008-01-22T04:21:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	oh. It's a shame
2008-01-22T04:21:00.000Z	debatem1	syntaxerror55	well, according to wikipedia- the site says 'under heavy construction'
2008-01-22T04:21:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	nah, they shut down due to a french law.
2008-01-22T04:22:00.000Z	debatem1	syntaxerror55	government: cause none of us is as stupid as all of us
2008-01-22T04:23:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	I checked them only a week ago and saw they had a UI, and was prepared for a real version so I could erase my Windows partition that only is there because of Flash 8. This is really bothering me. :(
2008-01-22T04:24:00.000Z	debatem1	syntaxerror55	yeah, we have a client where we were able to free them from all but one windows install, but they had to have the one for flash dev. i was really hoping uira was going to work out
2008-01-22T04:26:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	anyway, I hope you find someone to donate to. I can't honestly say the Ubuntu project is in big need of donations.
2008-01-22T04:26:00.000Z	debatem1	syntaxerror55	the absence of a 'donate' button on the page kind of clued us in on that one lol
2008-01-22T04:27:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	debatem1	lol
