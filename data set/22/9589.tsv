2005-10-19T10:00:00.000Z	aztek		bah
2005-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	aztek		Didn't 5.10 add a built in WPA tool??
2005-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	you can use wpasupplicant, but i dont think they got a graphical thing going
2005-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	oh
2005-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	well then you'lll be sol either way
2005-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	which card?
2005-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	which brand of wireless chipset is it?
2005-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	which driver?
2005-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	ie: will it eventually support all of the 'new' wireless extensions
2005-10-19T10:04:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	is it a driverloader or ndiswrapper setup?
2005-10-19T10:04:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	thats nice at least
2005-10-19T10:07:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	is it acx100?
2005-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	hrm, im not even seeing people talk about it on the mailing list
2005-10-19T10:11:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	you may want to think about another card if you really have to do WPA, like an atheros or something
2005-10-19T10:11:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	or it sounds like driverloader may work
2005-10-19T10:12:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	but then you're using windows drivers ;)
2005-10-19T10:12:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	yeah, i do wpa here now...
2005-10-19T10:12:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	heh
2005-10-19T10:12:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	some of the netgear cards are atheros
2005-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	hard to find cards that are ok with linux and wpa_supplicant in the store :|
2005-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	and sometimes you have to buy the expensive ones (ie: not $20) to get the right chipset
2005-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	dieman	aztek	luckily most people just have ipw2200 or something in their laptops now
