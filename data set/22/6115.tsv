2006-12-19T09:42:00.000Z	syte		i can't connect using my public ip address but can connect using private
2006-12-19T09:42:00.000Z	syte		no router
2006-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	syte		i would've port forwarded if that were the case but no router
2006-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	syte		whoops....localhost*
2006-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	syte		sorry...i forgot i disconnected my router
2006-12-19T09:43:00.000Z	dilch	syte	what? so you want to change the listening address? Or do you mean you are having connection problems?
2006-12-19T09:46:00.000Z	dilch	syte	well it could just be firewalled ... how did you try to connect to the ssh server?
2006-12-19T09:51:00.000Z	dilch	syte	well you aren't going to be able to connect to your external ip address from your own machine
2006-12-19T09:52:00.000Z	dilch	syte	so you'll have to either get someone else to check for connectivity, or use an external shell etc
2006-12-19T09:53:00.000Z	syte	dilch	u mind checking my connection
2006-12-19T09:54:00.000Z	dilch	syte	yeah ... the ip you are on now?
2006-12-19T09:55:00.000Z	dilch	syte	no dice ... i'll just run a quick nmap for port 22 on you
2006-12-19T09:56:00.000Z	dilch	syte	yeah, you've got port 22 firewalled
2006-12-19T09:56:00.000Z	dilch	syte	are you using a front end for iptables?
2006-12-19T09:57:00.000Z	dilch	syte	well use firestarter to open port 22
2006-12-19T09:59:00.000Z	dilch	syte	ok
2006-12-19T10:00:00.000Z	dilch	syte	you still have port 22 filtered
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	dilch	syte	hey join #syte
2006-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	dilch	syte	so i can tell you things that the kiddies won't latch on to
