2008-07-09T23:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	;)
2008-07-10T06:32:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	enable updates and backports
2008-07-10T06:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	I tried that, 2:2.3.2-2 isn't in backports or updates as far as I can tell :-/
2008-07-10T06:33:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	then wait
2008-07-10T06:37:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	that is for feisty, not hardy
2008-07-10T06:37:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	It works for Hardy just fine
2008-07-10T06:37:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	using that method on hardy is just silly
2008-07-10T06:37:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	Several ops will suggest it as well, including Jack_Sparrow
2008-07-10T06:38:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	no wonder ubottu is so confused about broadcom
2008-07-10T06:38:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	That's not true, several people's broadcom cards still aren't recognized in Hardy, mine for example. I was unable to get any solution to work other than the ndiswrapper one (of course I did buy a cheap wireless USB adapter for when I need monitor mode ;))
2008-07-10T06:39:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	do you have a 4312?
2008-07-10T06:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	That probably has more to do with my ineptitude, but still, the feisty solution works for lots of people including myself ;) No, I have a 4310 rev01
2008-07-10T06:39:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	because 4318 is well-supported
2008-07-10T06:45:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	-O is for naming the downloaded file
2008-07-10T06:45:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	Ah ok, I always just cd to the directory and run wget inside the directory :P
2008-07-10T06:49:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	very badly
2008-07-10T06:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	Yea, agree... I'm bummed, in Intrepid everything works perfectly for me except virtualbox crashes when I boot XP vdi's that work under Hardy, and in Hardy there are a few compiz plugins that don't work, but more importantly S-video doesn't work, so I have to do this constant reboot dance and it stinks :(
2008-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	you should enable backports and disable proposed
2008-07-10T06:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	Er, sorry I don't have proposed enabled either
2008-07-10T07:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	sn9_	But I guess I can enable backports for funsies. ;)
2008-07-10T07:06:00.000Z	sn9_	ASULutzy	yes
