2010-03-17T04:41:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	rall	I needed to do mount /dev/sdb2. this fixed the issue
2010-03-17T04:43:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	rall	Now my problem is that a regular user can't write to the ipod.
2010-03-17T04:44:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	rall	How can I mount it so that all users have read/write access?
2010-03-17T04:44:00.000Z	rall	PlasmaSheep	 ok so you got it mounted?
2010-03-17T04:44:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	rall	yes
2010-03-17T04:46:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	rall	so how can I make regular user have read and write privileges?
2010-03-17T04:47:00.000Z	rall	PlasmaSheep	 you could make a group with mounting permissions and let the users become member of that group I think:)  Good luck going to bed
