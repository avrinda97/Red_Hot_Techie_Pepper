2009-11-21T13:55:00.000Z	Asad2005		The time and weather in tray area disappeared. How do i get it back it seems to have moved to the panel just to the right of the menu
2009-11-21T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 right clck on panel, -> add to panel
2009-11-21T13:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 err.. the clock has  a featreu to show the weather also i recall
2009-11-21T14:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 actually you moved it to the RIGHT of the notification area I imagine. not TO the notification area
2009-11-21T14:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 the 'tray' is just another special panel widgit.  its moveable
2010-05-30T15:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 what filesystem was it on? and what device was it?  /dev/sda or /dev/sda1 ? or similer.
2010-05-30T15:02:00.000Z	Asad2005	Dr_Willis	It was taken for my dreambox receiver it must be ext2 or 3
2010-05-30T15:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 was it a whole DISK image? or a partition image?
2010-05-30T15:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 somthing like 'sudo mount -o loop filename MOUNTPOINT'  is what you need
2010-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	Asad2005	Dr_Willis	It gives you must specify fs type in the loop command
2010-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 so specify it then
2010-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	Asad2005	Dr_Willis	if it was ext2 or 3 there is no need to specify it i tried -t ext2 and 3 still giving error wrong fs type
2010-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 thats whyi asked if it was a DISK image. or a partition Image.. If its a  image of like /dev/sda  - then theres some offset options you may need to give for it to work
2010-05-30T15:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 This guide sems to cover it -> http://www.andremiller.net/content/mounting-hard-disk-image-including-partitions-using-linux
2010-05-30T15:10:00.000Z	Asad2005	Dr_Willis	this is how i created it "cat /dev/mtd/3 > /tmp/backup.img"
2010-05-30T15:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 No idea on mtd stuff. if its a 'whole' disk image. with several partitions thatn you need to use the offset  options like that URL mentions
2010-05-30T15:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 try 'testdisk whatever.img' to see some info on teh file
2010-05-30T15:14:00.000Z	Asad2005	Dr_Willis	thanks anyhow i will ceck that link
2010-12-17T23:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 you could put a swap partition on a seperate hd if you wanted.  Depends on your ram. You might never touch your swap.
2011-04-29T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 the icontray thing i think has basically been removed.. i dont think alltray would work at all
2011-04-29T21:43:00.000Z	Asad2005	Dr_Willis	but it is already working with other apps i tried it with calculator app ok
2011-05-18T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Asad2005	 monitor yoru ssh ports mainly.
