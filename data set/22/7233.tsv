2008-11-24T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	you have an eth0 card, with a valid ip/subet
2008-11-24T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	try this "sudo mii-tool eth0" and put the output in a pastebin
2008-11-24T03:09:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	ok
2008-11-24T03:10:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	ok, thats interesting, so it looks like the card is there and working, but either the cable it's using or the device it's plugged into is not there
2008-11-24T03:10:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	or broke
2008-11-24T03:11:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	what's it plugged into ?

2008-11-24T03:12:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	and if you reboot into windows now it works %100
2008-11-24T03:13:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	I have no idea what a dreambox is
2008-11-24T03:14:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	if you boot into windows now, it works %100 ?
2008-11-24T03:14:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	is it possible (I don't know your hardware) that the router is not allowing a connection on that port aas it's already assigned to the windows "card" even though it's the same hardware
2008-11-24T03:15:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	have you tried a different port on the router
2008-11-24T03:16:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	any other port
2008-11-24T03:17:00.000Z	ikonia	redcom7	just plug into another ethernet socket in the router
