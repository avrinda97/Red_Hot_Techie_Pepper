2008-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I want to open a .docx file. It seems to be MS's new "open" document format. I know it's evil and I rather should delete this from my ubuntu pc and my brain immediately ... but how _could_ I open it? Just in theory, purely academic ;-)
2008-01-11T14:54:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	use docs.google.com and convert it in there
2008-01-11T15:24:00.000Z	vlt	Josiah	hmmm, converting the document at docs.google.com means it has to leave my pc which is not possible. How can I convert it locally on my ubuntu pc?
2008-01-11T15:24:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	no internet access?
2008-01-11T15:25:00.000Z	vlt	Josiah	No, but it's sensitive data.
2008-01-11T15:25:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	ah ok at least you have net access... ok one sec
2008-01-11T15:28:00.000Z	vlt	Josiah	I _have_ Office. OpenOffice.org
2008-01-11T15:29:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	sorry was wondering if you had msoffice 2007: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Windows-Widgets/System-Utilities/Docx-Converter.shtml run that in wine
2008-01-11T15:30:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 or this might help http://www.sigmundvoid.com/?p=81
2008-01-11T15:31:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 makes openoffice docx compatible :)
2008-01-11T15:38:00.000Z	vlt	Josiah	cwillu: Thank you. What license is there for the novell tool? GPL?
2008-01-11T15:39:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 i would guess its gpl
2008-01-11T15:39:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	im guessing they are not going to look exactly the same after conversion btw
2008-01-11T15:39:00.000Z	vlt	Josiah	Shouldn't it be attached to it then?
2008-01-11T15:39:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 yeah.. im looking it up
2008-01-11T15:40:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 its for suse though
2008-01-11T15:40:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	"the odf-converter-1.0.0-5.i586.rpm file works only on SUSE® Linux Enterprise, SUSE Linux, and openSUSE. On both platforms, the OpenXML Translator works only with the latest Novell® edition of OpenOffice.org.

2008-01-11T15:53:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	in this article they are discussing the openxml and if it is gpl or not: http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind/?p=204
2008-01-11T15:53:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 sorry dont feel like reading it
2008-01-11T15:54:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 it looks like its BSD not GPL
2008-01-11T15:55:00.000Z	Josiah	vlt	 so Microsoft can take it proprietary (including any improvements that naive members of the community may make to it) any time it changes it - for example when it releases Word 2008 or Excel 2008
