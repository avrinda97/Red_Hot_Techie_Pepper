2005-07-16T06:52:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	thanx... will try it
2005-07-16T06:52:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	... or is it at the installer prompt?
2005-07-16T06:52:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	yup
2005-07-16T06:52:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	On the cd, just type 'linux-2.6 <your params>'
2005-07-16T06:53:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	my problem is the HD
2005-07-16T06:54:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	for some reason I always need to use hdparm before installing
2005-07-16T06:54:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	Chipset too new
2005-07-16T06:54:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	indeed
2005-07-16T06:54:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	See if you get the latest kernel.
2005-07-16T06:55:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	so do you think I can do this at the install prompt: linux-2.6 hdparm -d 1 -A 1 -m 16 -u 1 -a 64 /dev/hda?
2005-07-16T06:55:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	No
2005-07-16T06:55:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	hdparm isn available in the installer.
2005-07-16T06:56:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	oh boy
2005-07-16T06:57:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	that works under Gentoo... maybe I could run it via the "Execute a shell" menu?
2005-07-16T06:58:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	No, coz you'd *still* need to actually have the hdparm command available on the cd, and it isn't afaik.
2005-07-16T06:59:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	been able to do it after borking during file copying
2005-07-16T06:59:00.000Z	cafuego	GnuKemist	You can check alt-F2 (new console) and see if it's there
2005-07-16T07:00:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	gotcha...
2005-07-16T07:05:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	got the same error again... "Input/Output error during read on /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc"
2005-07-16T07:07:00.000Z	GnuKemist	cafuego	did u get a chance to read my msg?
