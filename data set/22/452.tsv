2011-10-07T11:32:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	you see the bluetooth icon right on top?
2011-10-07T11:32:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	jep, does this work?
2011-10-07T11:32:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
2011-10-07T11:32:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	have a look here
2011-10-07T11:33:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	i thought you rather have problems with "surround sound", just kidding :-)
2011-10-07T11:33:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	annoying in the sense of "hard to configure" or just not working?
2011-10-07T11:34:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	mmh, ah okay, see the use case
2011-10-07T11:34:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup#Using_Devices_as_Modems <- looked over here?
2011-10-07T11:35:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	just install blueman and configure it the right way
2011-10-07T11:35:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	should easily work
2011-10-07T11:35:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	mmh that is odd
2011-10-07T11:36:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	try logout and in again, perhaps the applet does not get refresehd
2011-10-07T11:36:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	have a look in /var/log/syslog
2011-10-07T11:36:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	there it tells some debugging while connecting
2011-10-07T11:38:00.000Z	surround	fritsch	Sometimes it says port already in use, or sometimes just error while connecting
2011-10-07T11:39:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	sorry no idea without logfiles
2011-10-07T11:40:00.000Z	surround	fritsch	Using Gnome Bluetooth I am able to connect to internet sometimes, but it does not disconnect properly, E sign appears on my phone, while  windows terminates the connection very well
2011-10-07T11:40:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	like said before. i can only say: this is bad - but help withouth further infos not possible
2011-10-07T11:40:00.000Z	fritsch	surround	have you looked through the bugtracker?
