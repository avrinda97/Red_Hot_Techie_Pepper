2010-10-08T12:08:00.000Z	andriy		hello everyone
2010-10-08T12:08:00.000Z	andriy		anyone know why i can see the hard drive wwhen its connected via external hdd enclosure, but not when it is connected internally/
2010-10-08T12:09:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 does it show in   fdisk -l   ?
2010-10-08T12:09:00.000Z	andriy	moetunes	yes
2010-10-08T12:10:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 you prob have to mount it then
2010-10-08T12:10:00.000Z	andriy		but it doesn't show in the file system ;(
2010-10-08T12:10:00.000Z	andriy		how do i do that (can't format it)
2010-10-08T12:10:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 if there is no fstab entry for it it won't be in the filesystem unless you mount it
2010-10-08T12:11:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 make a dir in /media or /mnt for it first
2010-10-08T12:11:00.000Z	andriy	moetunes	im new to linux, how do i mount it/
2010-10-08T12:12:00.000Z	andriy	moetunes	oh, i tried that, but it told me that i didn't specify the file system
2010-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 what is the file system on it?
2010-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	andriy		ntfs
2010-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 that should mount fine without being told what fs it is
2010-10-08T12:14:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 have you made a dir to mount it to?
2010-10-08T12:14:00.000Z	andriy	moetunes	yes, i did
2010-10-08T12:15:00.000Z	andriy		here are the steps i did 'mkdir /media/store' then chmod 777 /media/store' then mount /dev/hdb media/store' and thats when i get the error
2010-10-08T12:15:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	what does fdisk call the partitions on the drive ? - sdb1 or similar?
2010-10-08T12:16:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 you need sudo for mount
2010-10-08T12:16:00.000Z	andriy	moetunes	hmm, don't remember if i typed sudo.. brb
2010-10-08T12:16:00.000Z	moetunes	andriy	 and you mount partitions not drives so hdb1
2010-10-08T12:16:00.000Z	andriy	moetunes	oh... thanks
