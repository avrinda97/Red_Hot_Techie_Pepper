2012-08-02T03:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	No, but I use pppd on my gateway server
2012-08-02T03:10:00.000Z	brennan	IntuitiveNipple	i dont know it that would help me does gnomeppp use pppd?
2012-08-02T03:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	At some point underlying it will, but my use on the server is to bring up an ADSL connection across a bridged ATM device
2012-08-02T03:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	no, it means the actual ADSL modem device acts as a bridge passing on the ppp connection to the ISP's servers to establish the link, and effective drops out of the link between ISP and PPP client
2012-08-02T03:13:00.000Z	brennan	IntuitiveNipple	well that sucks that it drops out right?
2012-08-02T03:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	no, it's a great way to do it. It avoids having to do  IP routing between ADSL modem and server
2012-08-02T03:15:00.000Z	brennan	IntuitiveNipple	wats and ADSL modem?
2012-08-02T03:16:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	as far as the server is concerned, via the interface ppp0, it is connected directly to the ISP and doesn't need to worry about routing via the ADSL device (so doesn't get affected by the ADSL device doing NPAT or firewalling)
2012-08-02T03:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	Have you tried using network manager applet to create a new connection for Mobile Broadband?
2012-08-02T03:22:00.000Z	brennan	IntuitiveNipple	that cost money doesnt it?
2012-08-02T03:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	What is the device you're trying to connect with? Is it a mobile broadband modem or something else?
2012-08-02T03:23:00.000Z	brennan	IntuitiveNipple	it's a conexant systems modem
2012-08-02T03:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	for a fixed phone line?
2012-08-02T03:23:00.000Z	brennan	IntuitiveNipple	 yes
2012-08-02T03:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	Have you tried the Linuxant drivers? http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/dgc/index.php
2012-08-02T03:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	I tested Linuxant years ago and it worked well
2012-08-02T03:29:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	brennan	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware
