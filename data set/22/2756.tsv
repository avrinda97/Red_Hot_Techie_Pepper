2009-03-17T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	thats way complicated. install and run xming, install putty, set putty to accept frowarded x and do what you gotta do
2009-03-17T23:27:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	that does not set the display and all, and is mingw that easy to find ?!? i found cygwin more userfriendly
2009-03-17T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	it gives an x server to run forwarded apps, what more do you want?
2009-03-17T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	can you expand on that any? http://www.straightrunning.com/candidate/Xming-7-4-0-2-setup.exe  for xmiing
2009-03-17T23:30:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	i had it be4 cygwin, i found the cygwin one was better integrated
2009-03-17T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	integrated into what?
2009-03-17T23:30:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	it's been 4yrs be4, just didn't give it another chance, so maybe things have changed
2009-03-17T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	yep, xming does that, apps look like they are running on windows
2009-03-17T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	you dont see the full fake x server unless you set it to show
2009-03-17T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	me too only my work lappy is xp based but im over it
2009-03-17T23:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	never had a network timeout...
2009-03-17T23:36:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	i was fed up with windoze's useless waitstates ;) So one day i decided why cope with that
2009-03-17T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	its extremely custom software that i test in ncitrix
2009-03-17T23:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	so i need windows, plus after work i shutdown and jump on my own systems
2009-03-17T23:39:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	i guess there's no citrix client software availlable for linux than ? That sucks ! It's just X for windoze based programs ;)
2009-03-17T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	i think their is but what i have works so im not gonna fix it, ive got too many servers to firefight
2009-03-17T23:41:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	i know what you mean, but you could run windows in a virtual machine 4 that...
2009-03-17T23:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	whats the point, thats more bloat in ram running 2 OSes
2009-03-17T23:41:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	i see, what a jackass isn't he ? Patience...
2009-03-17T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JeroenTB	i have no problem with windows for my work pc
2009-03-17T23:44:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	well me neither, but network timeouts when poping up explorer and stuff like that wore me down
2009-03-17T23:45:00.000Z	JeroenTB	ActionParsnip	Sure ;) Tc and goodnite, i really gotta go now
