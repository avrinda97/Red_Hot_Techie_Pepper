2011-09-09T11:56:00.000Z	varikonniemi		well better than nothing still?
2011-09-09T11:56:00.000Z	varikonniemi		i do not have the skill to start stabbing my linux if it borks up
2011-09-09T11:56:00.000Z	varikonniemi		its infinitely easier to just format and reinstall
2011-09-09T11:57:00.000Z	varikonniemi		ubuntu is fine and dandy as long as it works, if it fails.. you are out of luck
2011-09-09T11:59:00.000Z	varikonniemi		well i have no luck asking my questions here, so what would you suggest as a place to start ?
2011-09-09T12:00:00.000Z	varikonniemi		yesterday i asked two or three times how to get alt-tab working in games and no answer. So i just settled for "its a feature, it does not"
2011-09-09T12:01:00.000Z	rumpel	varikonniemi	which desktop-environment?
2011-09-09T12:02:00.000Z	varikonniemi		ubuntu 11.04
2011-09-09T12:02:00.000Z	varikonniemi		rumba,
2011-09-09T12:02:00.000Z	varikonniemi		rumpel,
2011-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	rumpel	varikonniemi	i meant like unity, gnome, kde...
2011-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	varikonniemi		well kubuntu is kde
2011-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	varikonniemi		ubuntu is unity
2011-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	varikonniemi		so yes, unity
2011-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	rumpel	varikonniemi	not necessarily
2011-09-09T12:03:00.000Z	varikonniemi		no but if i made a mod that big i would mention it
2011-09-09T12:04:00.000Z	varikonniemi		by default it is
2011-09-09T12:04:00.000Z	rumpel	varikonniemi	i guess you can write a script, which toggles certain shortcuts via gconf.
2011-09-09T12:05:00.000Z	varikonniemi	rumpel	now you are teaching hebrew to a infant
2011-09-09T12:05:00.000Z	varikonniemi		same territory as "compile it yourself"
2011-09-09T12:06:00.000Z	rumpel	varikonniemi	or you can look for the shortcut-settings in unity and deactivate the "alt-tab" shortcut (if you otherwise don't need it)
2011-09-09T12:06:00.000Z	rumpel	varikonniemi	that's the userfriendliest solution i can think of
