2009-06-07T01:35:00.000Z	Guthur		is sudo -k and sudo -K the only forms of revoking granted sudo permission, is there a super duper kill that revokes everything
2009-06-07T01:36:00.000Z	Guthur		besides a reboot of course :)
2009-06-07T01:37:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	sudo -k doesn't revoke anything, you only to type your password again, what else do you need?
2009-06-07T01:38:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	ya that is what i mean, sorry i could have been more clear, its just I seemed to have found a way to persist the permission no matter what
2009-06-07T01:39:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	strange, what happens if you open another terminal window?
2009-06-07T01:39:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	sudo -k or sudo -K are not forcing sudo to ask for a password again, though i does still seem to timeout
2009-06-07T01:40:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	i can only persist it using a small python program, terminal seems to act normally
2009-06-07T01:40:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	but the access through the program never asks for the password after it has been entered and i can carry out protected operations
2009-06-07T01:41:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	then there is gksu, I don't know if that keeps the permissions longer
2009-06-07T01:42:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	ah, now I see: once you start a program with sudo it is invoked with root-permissions and so keeps them of course
2009-06-07T01:43:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	even after quiting the programming and running again?
2009-06-07T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	could be it run as service?
2009-06-07T01:44:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	no sure i am running it from with in geany, a python editor
2009-06-07T01:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	and you invoke geany with sudo?
2009-06-07T01:46:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	it is a standard python program and setup, i have made no changes and don't enter my password or anything
2009-06-07T01:46:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	and how do you start the offending program then?
2009-06-07T01:47:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	my program makes a system call using sudo, the thing is if i don't specify a stdin it will prompt for a password. i execute from in geany
2009-06-07T01:48:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	are you familiar with python?
2009-06-07T01:49:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	I'm afraid I'm out of my depth there, never tried this, no I'm not familiar with python at all, sorry
2009-06-07T01:49:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	well i changed the name of the program and still got the same behaviour, which may rule out some persistent access for the program
2009-06-07T01:50:00.000Z	Guthur	guntbert	thanks for the input, i thinking i might have to raise this for investigation its a bit of a security risk, imho
2009-06-07T01:51:00.000Z	guntbert	Guthur	good luck then :-)
