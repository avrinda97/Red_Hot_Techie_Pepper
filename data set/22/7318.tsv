2007-02-07T09:39:00.000Z	freezey	cappiz	and say i wanted to add another user... so they can sign in from outside my machine
2007-02-07T09:40:00.000Z	freezey	cappiz	lol sorry and say i wanna take it off of localhost
2007-02-07T09:40:00.000Z	cappiz	freezey	find you external IP, if you are behind a firewall you need to forwar port 21, and the passive port range.
2007-02-07T09:43:00.000Z	freezey	cappiz	ok i am just going to NAT the box out... because i am behind a firewall.. so basically once i have that port natted out it should be cool?
2007-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	freezey	cappiz	how do i enable it to prompt you to sign in?
2007-02-07T09:47:00.000Z	cappiz	freezey	try ftp://user:pass@localhost first
2007-02-07T09:48:00.000Z	freezey	cappiz	i think i have anon access setup tho so i am guessing if i take that off it will prompt me
2007-02-07T09:51:00.000Z	cappiz	freezey	yeah.
