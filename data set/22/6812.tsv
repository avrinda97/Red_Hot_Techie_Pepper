2006-11-03T13:45:00.000Z	boybach		hello, i have a problem getting my monitor to display higher than 1024 x 768.
2006-11-03T13:45:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	have a look at your xorg.conf file.
2006-11-03T13:46:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	in your xorg.conf file, look for default depth
2006-11-03T13:47:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	hang on one.....
2006-11-03T13:47:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	on my system it is in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-11-03T13:48:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	you may need to change the default depth to say 16 or 24, depending on you monior, BUT !
2006-11-03T13:48:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	try using default depth 16 and see what happenns, BUT !
2006-11-03T13:49:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	be sure to make a backup of the xorg.conf FIRST.
2006-11-03T13:49:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	then.....
2006-11-03T13:49:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	close ALL open windows and press control/alt backspace to restart X
2006-11-03T13:51:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	I also found that another display setting is a bit better on the eyes.
2006-11-03T13:51:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	I use 1152x864 to be flicker free and less straing on the eyes.
2006-11-03T13:52:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	that is at least on my system.
2006-11-03T14:00:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	well can you post some where I can see you xorg.conf file ?
2006-11-03T14:00:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	hang on a sec....
2006-11-03T14:04:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	can you send your xorg.conf to pastebin please ?
2006-11-03T14:16:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	okay, let me go look.
2006-11-03T14:19:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	looks good. Did you try default depth of 16 ?
2006-11-03T14:21:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	when I changed my default to 24, it opened up to1820x1024 and back
2006-11-03T14:22:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	I was stuck in 1024x768 for a bit until I researched it out/
2006-11-03T14:22:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	I am trying to remember where the setting for smooth scrolling is to turn it off......
2006-11-03T14:28:00.000Z	n1gke	boybach	does this happen in all screens or just in certain screens/programs ?
