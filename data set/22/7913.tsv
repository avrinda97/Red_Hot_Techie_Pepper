2005-11-22T14:07:00.000Z	DRMacIver		I've just upgraded to breezy badger and X is failing in a very irritating way - it doesn't give any error messages that I can see. It just doesn't do anything.
2005-11-22T14:08:00.000Z	dducko	DRMacIver	Nvidia?
2005-11-22T14:08:00.000Z	DRMacIver		Yes
2005-11-22T14:08:00.000Z	dducko		You on the machine now?
2005-11-22T14:09:00.000Z	DRMacIver		Well, it's right by me. This is a different machine though.
2005-11-22T14:09:00.000Z	DRMacIver		(and the IRC session is running remotely on yet another machine)
2005-11-22T14:09:00.000Z	dducko		sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-11-22T14:10:00.000Z	dducko		then change the Driver to nv instead of nvidia see if that works
2005-11-22T14:11:00.000Z	DRMacIver	dducko	It already is nv
2005-11-22T14:11:00.000Z	dducko		Oh.. crap... umm.. ok..
2005-11-22T14:11:00.000Z	DRMacIver		By the way, this worked fine under Hoary Hedgehog. It was the upgrade that broke it.
2005-11-22T14:12:00.000Z	dducko		Had you installed anyother rivers?
2005-11-22T14:12:00.000Z	dducko		drivers*
2005-11-22T14:13:00.000Z	dducko		Anyone, what s the dpkg comand to reconfigure x,
2005-11-22T14:13:00.000Z	dducko		I think that might help DRMacIver
2005-11-22T14:15:00.000Z	dducko	DRMacIver	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-11-22T14:15:00.000Z	dducko		try that,
2005-11-22T14:16:00.000Z	DRMacIver	dducko	It says xserver-xorg is broken or not fully installed.
2005-11-22T14:27:00.000Z	DRMacIver		Hmm. So now that I know this is broken or not installed, is it relatively easy to reinstall?
2005-11-22T14:58:00.000Z	DRMacIver		Ooh.
2005-11-22T14:58:00.000Z	DRMacIver		Fixed it. :)
2005-11-22T14:58:00.000Z	DRMacIver	dducko	Thanks for your help. It set me on the right track.
