2007-07-31T05:46:00.000Z	ZeroA4	lindog	in a terminal: "sudo iwlist ethX scanning" lists your networks?
2007-07-31T05:47:00.000Z	lindog	ZeroA4	 ethX      Interface doesn't support scanning.

2007-07-31T05:53:00.000Z	ZeroA4	lindog	i guess linux part is working them... " iwconfig wlan0 essid netgear " should conect you... there is also the graphical network manager
2007-07-31T05:54:00.000Z	ZeroA4	lindog	"sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid netgear"
2007-07-31T05:54:00.000Z	ZeroA4	lindog	"sudo dhclinet wlan0"
2007-07-31T05:55:00.000Z	lindog	ZeroA4	ii can see it should but doesn't
2007-07-31T05:55:00.000Z	ZeroA4	lindog	i think you should not have 2 wifi networks on the same channel
2007-07-31T06:01:00.000Z	lindog	ZeroA4	 i turned off one and left encryption off one alive and still the same it only connect to wired network
2007-07-31T06:01:00.000Z	ZeroA4	lindog	humm remove the wired cable... try without it
2007-07-31T06:02:00.000Z	lindog	ZeroA4	OK i will
