2008-07-15T09:37:00.000Z	Lokz		Seriously, anyone who believe they are pretty good in networking... could you have a look at this ? I'm trying to connect to my router using eth0... I believe I've read everything that's available and tried everything from friends and own experience

2008-07-15T09:38:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	any reason you dont want to use dhcp?
2008-07-15T09:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	you never installed a dhcp client?
2008-07-15T09:40:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	unless it comes with the standard installation of the ubuntu server... but i don't have the dhcpcd
2008-07-15T09:40:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	dhclient
2008-07-15T09:40:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	I did, check the link
2008-07-15T09:40:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	seems like something on the 255.255.255.255 is fucking up
2008-07-15T09:41:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	I believe a misconfiguration of something in my ubuntu box
2008-07-15T09:41:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	i doubt you want your subnet to be 255.255.255.255
2008-07-15T09:41:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	nvm its 255.255.255.0
2008-07-15T09:41:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	it's not ... it's set to .0 yea, and what about the language?
2008-07-15T09:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	about the language, try to keep it family friendly here :)
2008-07-15T09:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	using a wifi card? apple airport?
2008-07-15T09:43:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	using a direct wired ethernet cable, plugged into an apple airport extrem
2008-07-15T09:43:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	using the rj45 ethernet
2008-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	ping to gateway works... just doesnt go out of the network range (aka google.ping doesnt work)
2008-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	do: sudo ifconfig eth0 down     then     sudo ifconfig eth0 up    then    sudo dhclient eth0
2008-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Lokz	other machines can get out though im assuming
2008-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	correct
2008-07-15T09:45:00.000Z	Lokz	MasterShrek	kk thanks for trying, I appreciate :)
