2011-07-30T10:04:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		No I ran the cd, then it asked me to reboot, I did then it took me to the boot screen, then I hit 'ubuntu'
2011-07-30T10:04:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Then it said now installing, and then the purple ubuntu screen came up
2011-07-30T10:06:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Yea? I hope lol, nit-wit
2011-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		I installed it earlier via ssh on the windows installer
2011-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		It failed
2011-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		I installed it in windows not in the boot screen
2011-07-30T10:08:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		In case?
2011-07-30T10:09:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		In c*
2011-07-30T10:09:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		What do you mean by c?
2011-07-30T10:10:00.000Z	TheMoonMan		Well it's still on the purple screen now and I have a very fast computer
2011-07-30T10:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	for a desktop, maybe ;)
2011-07-30T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	are you booting the CD or an installed OS?
2011-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	did you MD5 test the ISO before you burned it?
2011-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	good :)
2011-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	and do you get the purple screen after you have logged in?
2011-07-30T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	try adding the boot option: nomodeset     may help
2011-07-30T10:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	I have systems with 16 and 32 cores with loads of ram. I doubt your home pc has much of that, for a home user I'm sure you would think it was fast but in the great scheme of things its not
2011-07-30T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	you may need to add the boot option: nomodeset   to get the video working, Unity needs 3D accelleration to run and if you don't have it out of the box you'll get issues
2011-07-30T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	if you use an nvidia based video chip you may want to use:  nouvea.blacklist=1
2011-07-30T10:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	not sure how that works with wubi as I don't use it but I'm sure it'll be the same
2011-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	did you try the boot option?
2011-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheMoonMan	yes, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and set the boot optin
