2007-02-19T17:09:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	correct
2007-02-19T17:10:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	so are there any modules loaded ?
2007-02-19T17:11:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	lsmod, pastebin the output
2007-02-19T17:11:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	it's huge you want it all or should I look for something specific?
2007-02-19T17:12:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	paste it
2007-02-19T17:14:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	got it  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6484/
2007-02-19T17:16:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	I see tc1100_wmi loaded.. but not used, that might be something
2007-02-19T17:17:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	and a lot of yenta nonsense - is one of them a PCMCIA card ?
2007-02-19T17:17:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	ok, lead me on, how do I rectify that?  Yes the belkin is a pcmcia
2007-02-19T17:17:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	there is a log, or a potential log, for pcmcia events you can look at
2007-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	but what is the other one, built-in ?
2007-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	yes, the broadcom is builtin
2007-02-19T17:19:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	I hear bad things about broadcom...
2007-02-19T17:21:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	so what do you think my next step is?
2007-02-19T17:21:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	take one of the cards out and start getting the other one to work.. tryingto troubleshoot two wifi nics at once is bound to be troublematic
2007-02-19T17:23:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	I agree. I started with the pcmcia because it is MIMO and thus faster. I gave up on it and started working on the built-in instead because I knew it worked in the past. When I had the same issue, I started asking for help on the forums (which has been ignored) and now I aM HERE
2007-02-19T17:24:00.000Z	SuperTeece	adaptr	do you know how to check which version of ndiswrapper libs I have installed?
2007-02-19T17:24:00.000Z	adaptr	SuperTeece	nope, never used it
