2008-04-25T01:38:00.000Z	jordanjay29		loud? It's absolutely silent
2008-04-25T01:38:00.000Z	jordanjay29		:P
2008-04-25T01:38:00.000Z	jordanjay29		FF2 will be outdated by June, graft
2008-04-25T01:39:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	outdated in what way?
2008-04-25T01:39:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	June is the release of FF3
2008-04-25T01:39:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	the scheduled release... but you're still putting a beta browser in your release, right?
2008-04-25T01:39:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	thus making it more suitable for an LTS edition
2008-04-25T01:40:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	um, so will the release be updated in june, or will the final firefox version just be in backports?
2008-04-25T01:40:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	It's supposed to be supported for, as Starnestommy just said, 3 years on desktops and 5 on servers. Firefox 2 won't be supported that long, most likely. Firefox 3 has a better chance of being supported for 3 years.
2008-04-25T01:40:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	when FF3 is out, you'll be notified through Firefox
2008-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	that's not my question... my question is, will hardy be updated, or will it jus tbe in backports?
2008-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	I don't know. FF3 final will likely be in 8.10 for sure.
2008-04-25T01:41:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	in any case i'm not about to upgrade firefox via it's in-browser upgrade mechanism, and i hardly think that's what ubuntu would recommend
2008-04-25T01:42:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	Mozilla's always makes sure that Firefox updates correctly for all systems it's compatible with.
2008-04-25T01:43:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	so, i should do updates to firefox via the browser and not the package manager?!
2008-04-25T01:43:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	why don't i just run slackware, then?
2008-04-25T01:44:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	#kubuntu
2008-04-25T01:44:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	this channel is for general support as well
2008-04-25T01:44:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	if i had a KDE question i'd go there.
2008-04-25T01:45:00.000Z	jordanjay29	graft	Just so you're aware is all.
2008-04-25T01:45:00.000Z	graft	jordanjay29	i'm well aware, thanks :)
