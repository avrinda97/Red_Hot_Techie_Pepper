2008-05-20T17:37:00.000Z	mateusz		Hi
2008-05-20T17:37:00.000Z	mateusz		is i386 ubuntu 8.04 broken ?
2008-05-20T17:37:00.000Z	mateusz		it does not install and I get shash read write error
2008-05-20T17:38:00.000Z	mateusz		when I do test cd
2008-05-20T17:38:00.000Z	mateusz		I get 1 file broken
2008-05-20T17:40:00.000Z	XLV	mateusz	download this ftp://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/pub/linux/ubuntu-releases/8.04/MD5SUMS then get an md5 sum program to check the iso you have downloaded.. eg hashcalc
2008-05-20T17:41:00.000Z	XLV	mateusz	compare the md5 hash the program generates against the one that is certainly the right one in the MD5SUMS text file
2008-05-20T17:41:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	no such file
2008-05-20T17:41:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	oh too many connections:P
2008-05-20T17:42:00.000Z	XLV	mateusz	remember its linux text, so if you are in windows, use wordpad to open MD5SUMS file, to get LF+CR correctly displayed
2008-05-20T17:42:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	I am on linux
2008-05-20T18:00:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	LoL the previous file I download has the same md5sum
2008-05-20T18:00:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	the one I burned
2008-05-20T18:00:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	and md5sum is fine
2008-05-20T18:00:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	but I burned it twice and tried from qemu and was broken
2008-05-20T18:02:00.000Z	XLV	mateusz	qemu -cdrom [[cdrom''image]] -boot d [[hd''image]] should mount the iso in loopback device, so you dont have to burn it to test it in qemu
2008-05-20T18:03:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	this one works
2008-05-20T18:03:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	in qemu
2008-05-20T18:03:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	I'll try bad one
2008-05-20T18:05:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	hmm the "bad one" also works.. maybe I removed that bad one.. ok..
2008-05-20T18:05:00.000Z	mateusz	XLV	but thanks
2008-05-20T18:06:00.000Z	XLV	mateusz	if the iso mounted on loopback on qemu works, but the same iso burned in a cd/dvd doesnt, then the writer or media is problematic, try writing to some other media or at lower speed
