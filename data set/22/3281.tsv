2008-10-25T04:03:00.000Z	keithclark		When using a BitTorrent client, all seems well for several hours, then all of a sudden my net access slows to a crawl and I can no longer get to any websites without resetting both my cable modem and my router.  Does this sound like a router being overwhelmed problem or something else?
2008-10-25T04:05:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	Do you have this issue on any other internet connected items in your household?
2008-10-25T04:05:00.000Z	keithclark	stevenw9	yes, everything slows to a crawl.
2008-10-25T04:06:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	Then this rules out your network adapter being the problem. Have you had this issue without your router?
2008-10-25T04:06:00.000Z	keithclark	stevenw9	I've never tried hooking the modem up direct before.
2008-10-25T04:07:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	You should. If you still have this issue, I advise talking to your ISP about getting a replacement modem.
2008-10-25T04:07:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	However if you DON'T have the issue, then we know it's a router issue. Thus you can come back here after that.
2008-10-25T04:07:00.000Z	keithclark	stevenw9	or maybe this is an issue with throttling?  Although I've limited the speed of the bittorrent client to something reasonable compared to my connection
2008-10-25T04:08:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	It might be, it might not be. Hence why I suggest trying with your modem directly connected.
2008-10-25T04:08:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	Also
2008-10-25T04:08:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	Encryption settings may work on your torrent program. Comcast for example, cripples speeds if you torrent without encryption.
2008-10-25T04:09:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	But that's another discusison :)
2008-10-25T04:09:00.000Z	stevenw9		scuse my typos
2008-10-25T04:09:00.000Z	stevenw9		question: Enabling the proprietary driver for my GeForce 8200 makes Ubuntu 8.01 LTS unusable due to graphical artifacts. Nothing can be seen at that point. Can someone help me fix this please? ._.
2008-10-25T04:09:00.000Z	keithclark	stevenw9	Ok, that is a couple of things to try.  Now, when I look at the security log of my router I see DOS blockages at a rate of about 2 per second.  Is this unreasonable for a router to handle?
2008-10-25T04:10:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	I'm not too sure about that.
2008-10-25T04:10:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	I'm not a real techy, my experience only goes so far :(
2008-10-25T04:11:00.000Z	keithclark	stevenw9	no problem!  I was just wondering what a normal load for a router would be.  I have no idea.
2008-10-25T04:11:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	last time I had the issue you're having, it was my network adapter though, and indeed was a throttle setting issue.
2008-10-25T04:11:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	but your symptoms are a tad bit different.
2008-10-25T04:12:00.000Z	keithclark	stevenw9	Well, you've given me a couple of things to try out.  Thanks, let me go give them a shot now.
2008-10-25T04:13:00.000Z	stevenw9	keithclark	no problem
