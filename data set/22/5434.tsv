2009-01-11T19:53:00.000Z	Gnea		etronik: not sure that /etc/network/interfaces should have anything for it, that file doesn't handle it directly anymore
2009-01-11T19:53:00.000Z	Gnea		etronik: unless the system added it for you
2009-01-11T19:55:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	ok, so how should I proceed? I have a correct config in network-manager... maybe the interfaces causing the confusion?
2009-01-11T19:55:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	could be - did you add the interfaces on your own?
2009-01-11T19:55:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	no..
2009-01-11T19:56:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	okay, well let's see... could you please pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file?
2009-01-11T19:56:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	ok :), I'll reboot and do that asap
2009-01-11T19:57:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	k
2009-01-11T20:01:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	http://pastebin.ca/1305959
2009-01-11T20:05:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	okay, yeah, that's been manually editted
2009-01-11T20:05:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	it won't work like that, it needs to be a clean interfaces file
2009-01-11T20:05:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	sec..
2009-01-11T20:06:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	I see...
2009-01-11T20:07:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	make it look like that and reboot: http://pastebin.ca/1305962
2009-01-11T20:07:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	you'll need, of course, to input your IP information manually through the NetworkManager interface
2009-01-11T20:08:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	thanks, and how do I configure the Wifi network (instead of the wired one) ? through network manager ?
2009-01-11T20:09:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	you mean to delete the whole thing (almost) from /etc/interfaces ?
2009-01-11T20:10:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	well, back yours up first so that you don't forget the info there - but yeah, the whole file is causing you problems - it isn't the older ubuntu or debian anymore, there's a new method at work now and if you try to trump it, it will trump you, as it is currently doing :)
2009-01-11T20:10:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	I see, rebooting now :-)
2009-01-11T20:11:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	but yeah, in NetworkManager, make sure you set the 'System Setting' checkbox for both the wired and wireless, otherwise you get no networking unless you're logged in
2009-01-11T20:47:00.000Z	etronik	Gnea	your fix seems to be working wonderfully !! :-) THANKS VERY VERY MUCH !! :)
2009-01-11T20:47:00.000Z	Gnea	etronik	cheers :)
