2006-12-05T16:34:00.000Z	lee2		i cant see an intel 64bit
2006-12-05T16:36:00.000Z	lee2		do i get ubuntu-6.10-desktop-amd64.iso for Intel 64bit ?
2006-12-05T16:36:00.000Z	lee2		its Intel Dual Core, DUO 2
2006-12-05T16:37:00.000Z	lee2		surely all 64bit cpu's must follow generic structure if they both run Windows ?
2006-12-05T16:37:00.000Z	lee2		i386 is 32bit ?
2006-12-05T16:37:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	i386 is 32bit
2006-12-05T16:38:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	XP 64bit is just a windows 2003 kernel and that's it
2006-12-05T16:39:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	why would it when they are made by the same company but anyways you want the amd64 iso if you want x86_64
2006-12-05T16:42:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	if you want a full x86_64 system then yes
2006-12-05T16:42:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	amd came out first with x86_64 so people call it that
2006-12-05T16:43:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	EMT64 is a memory chip on Intel's processors that make them x86_64
2006-12-05T16:44:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	Intels are for office work mostly while amd is for gaming
2006-12-05T16:44:00.000Z	lee2	kitche	im a directx programmer :)
2006-12-05T16:47:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	not really
2006-12-05T16:48:00.000Z	lee2	kitche	swapdisk is linux's "pagefile" right ?
2006-12-05T16:48:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	pretty much you can also make a swapfile
2006-12-05T16:49:00.000Z	lee2	kitche	why does the swapdisk do. ?
2006-12-05T16:49:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	it's virtual ram
2006-12-05T16:49:00.000Z	lee2	kitche	oh right.
2006-12-05T16:50:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	if you have 2 gigs of ram no use in swap
2006-12-05T16:50:00.000Z	kitche	lee2	well windows needs an extra thing to use 2 gigs of ram not sure if linux needs it or not
2006-12-05T16:51:00.000Z	lee2	kitche	i was thinking of getting 4gb of ram, but im not sure if that was just stupid
