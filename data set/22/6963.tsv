2008-01-05T09:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	the live cd yes...
2008-01-05T09:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	you can also use synaptic to install gparted
2008-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	Please try keeping on topic
2008-02-08T19:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	/var/cache/apt/archives
2008-02-08T20:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	There is a command to purge them, I normally, burn them to a cd or dvd then delete them.. see also aptoncd
2008-02-08T20:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	It saves the time of dl' again
2008-02-10T00:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	No need to make pidgin, would you like a deb of the latest?
2008-02-10T00:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	Yes, a double click to install soultion for what you are trying to do
2008-02-10T00:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	getdeb.net...  3 files.. remove the old pidgin FIRST..ok
2008-03-24T19:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	YOu can delete or move to a different partition /var/cache/apt/archives  and try to reboot
2008-03-24T19:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	nice to keep if you can stick it on a usb or another partition.
2008-03-24T19:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ballin	aptoncd is nice to keep them handy for a later reinstall
