2011-11-04T15:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 whats the exact line? you are doing this from fstab?
2011-11-04T15:49:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	i am trying to mount an iso image after system start up
2011-11-04T15:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 so whats the exaqct command line you are using?
2011-11-04T15:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 whats the error if you try to do a 'sudo mount /mnt/isomnt'
2011-11-04T15:52:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	 after rebooting it gives me two option either skip S or M for manual maintenance  and says it failed to mount in /mnt/isomnt (my iso mount point)
2011-11-04T15:54:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	i think i do have a clue on what's really going on, the /mnt/isomnt dir exists but when i ls my /home/username it doesn't view any of my files but rather a README.TXT and access-your-private-data.desktop
2011-11-04T15:55:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	i think fstab doesn't even see my /home/username to mount from
2011-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 you couild do it from the command line, or via a command in n /etc/rc.local
2011-11-04T16:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 whats the exact fstab entry you are using?
2011-11-04T16:04:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	after rebooting it gives me two option either skip S or M for manual maintenance and says it failed to mount in /mnt/isomnt (my iso mount point)

2011-11-04T16:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 you home is on its own partition?
2011-11-04T16:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 mount the iso to /media/iso file  and just make a link from /home/whatever/iso to it...
2011-11-04T16:13:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	does changing the mount point from /mnt/myfile to /media matter?
2011-11-04T16:14:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	i think the main problem is that ubuntu isn't even reading my contents in /home/user when i ls from the recovery terminal it doesn't show anything or my folders
2011-11-04T16:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 you are thinking that having the mountpoint be on a subdirectory on a nother mountmoint is the issue.. if you use  /media or /mnt/whatever  it would not be doing that.. so try it and see
2011-11-04T16:14:00.000Z	xero771	dr_willis	alright
2011-11-04T16:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 your users home is not encrypted is it? THAT could be an issue..
2011-11-04T16:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 i did not say to encrypt home...
2011-11-04T16:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 in fact encrypting it could cause issues..
2011-11-04T16:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	xero771	 as a test. boot a live cd.. see whats in the home dir.. if its not encrypted you should see  the normal files.. if it is encrypted.. well im guessing you would see those 2 files.
