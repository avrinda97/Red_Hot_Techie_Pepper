2007-07-30T09:01:00.000Z	noelferreira		i have tomacat running on port 8080 and i have to acces my localhost via web. For that i created a dynamic dns account. xxxxx.dyndns.org . How can i access my tomcat project over http ?
2007-07-30T09:02:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	do you mean http://xxxx.dyndns.org:8080/
2007-07-30T09:03:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	that's because xxxx.dyndns.org is pointing to my router
2007-07-30T09:04:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	yes it is. you would probably have to configure the router to forward that port to the server
2007-07-30T09:04:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	how can i do that?
2007-07-30T09:05:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	depends on your router.
2007-07-30T09:06:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	tell me generally speaking.
2007-07-30T09:08:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	yes, open it and forward it to the server
2007-07-30T09:09:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	forward it to the server? sorry don't understand
2007-07-30T09:09:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	sorry i cannot help you more with your router
2007-07-30T09:11:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	is not a router problem. i just don't understand what you mean with forward the port to my server. i have already localhost:8080 working in my local pc. do you know what i mean?
2007-07-30T09:12:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	yes i know what you mean. you will have to enable a feature called "port forwarding" in your router. how to do it depends on your router
2007-07-30T09:13:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	i know do portforwarding in my router. my question is if i just have only to open port 8080
2007-07-30T09:14:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	if you don't open the port, you cannot connect to the server... so yes
2007-07-30T09:15:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	did you try it from a client outside of the lan?
2007-07-30T09:16:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	ask a friend to connect to it, then come back here
2007-07-30T09:22:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	thanks it works. last question. localhost:8080 is know the same as xxx.dynds.org:8080 true?
2007-07-30T09:22:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	localhost is a self-reference, it means "this computer"
2007-07-30T09:23:00.000Z	noelferreira	magnetron	i see. thanks
2008-06-23T02:19:00.000Z	magnetron	noelferreira	which bug is that?
