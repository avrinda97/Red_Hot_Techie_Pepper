2005-01-06T14:49:00.000Z	bob2	kipod	./ means the current directory, sh is the name of the program that is a shell
2005-01-06T14:50:00.000Z	bob2	kipod	if you mean "the difference between ./foo and 'sh foo'", then it's the difference between running a program (which the kernel decides is a shell script) and running a shell over a script file
