2007-11-07T01:10:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	it might be /ignore #ubuntu JOINS QUITS PARTS
2007-11-07T01:11:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	Nope.
2007-11-07T01:11:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	not sure then, that would work in irssi.
2007-11-19T01:06:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	Please see the message from ubotu
2007-11-19T21:22:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	That's amazing. How'd you know that was actually a language, nevermind which language it was?
2007-11-19T21:23:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	I actually just finished writing a script that does a combination /whois and checks the country code of the ip address against a list of country codes and gives me the country name.
2007-11-19T23:57:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	#ubuntu-offtopic
2007-11-19T23:57:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	Thanks.
2007-11-20T20:50:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	find /path/to/files -name "*\.db" -exec rm -f {} should work.  test it with removing the part past and including -exec to make sure its getting the right files.
2007-11-20T20:50:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	What command did you run?
2007-11-20T20:51:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	You just told it to remove *.db AND /mnt/locker/Music
2007-11-20T20:52:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	I don't even want to tell you the command I tried before that.
2007-11-20T20:53:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	I dont think I want to know either.
2007-11-20T20:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	I'll just say my icons have reverted to their default theme, and my blood pressure is high. What would the command have been to have rm delete every file with extension .db from every folder under /Music
2007-11-20T20:55:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	find /Music -name "*\.db" -exec rm -f {}
2007-11-20T20:56:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	Thanks. I wasn't even close.
2008-01-11T23:32:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	You cant use dd or gparted or whatever else you want to use while the disk is mounted.
2008-01-29T18:25:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	Its not the same as a reboot, but its equivalent to restarting Gnome.
2008-02-18T20:10:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	#users.opennofice.org
2008-03-19T19:55:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	I don't consider it combative to warn a new user that they're arguing with a OP via the highly humerous !admin message from Ubotu: Either they calm down because you're not just some joe telling them what to do, or they're not the kind of person who lasts long anyway.
2008-03-19T19:56:00.000Z	Pici	ArthurArchnix	may I pm?
2008-03-19T19:56:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Pici	Always
