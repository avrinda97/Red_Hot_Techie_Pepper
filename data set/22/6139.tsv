2007-06-19T16:28:00.000Z	TheVault		I wanna be able to change the start menu icon, the default orange one. Iv done what everyone has currently said and go to the /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/ and replace the distributor-logo.png with the image I want and then refresh the panel. I did that. Then I was told to go where the themes are and go into the current theme Im currently use and find it in there. Iv tried everything but it won't let me change the start menu icon
2007-06-19T16:28:00.000Z	TheVault		and I really want to change it to complete my theme
2007-06-19T16:29:00.000Z	tck	TheVault	right click on start menu icon and click edit
2007-06-19T16:29:00.000Z	tck		may work
2007-06-19T16:29:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	I'll be able to change the orange icon from there?
2007-06-19T16:29:00.000Z	tck	TheVault	not sure, at least eliminate that option
2007-06-19T16:30:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	Lol thats funny

2007-06-19T16:30:00.000Z	tck	TheVault	are you sure it can be changed?

2007-06-19T16:31:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	Yes, Iv seen many many many screenshots and people have it changed. Like some people have the Mac OS X look going on, so I see the blue apple. Iv seen some people with the Windows Vista Theme(which I'm almost complete with doing) and they have the Windows Vista orb there
2007-06-19T16:32:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	Yup, iv been to that one as well and nothing works
2007-06-19T16:32:00.000Z	tck	TheVault	install M$ :P
2007-06-19T16:32:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	M$?

2007-06-19T16:33:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	Oh. I already do, have it on Dual boot. I'm just making things the nice vista look with the power of Beryl at my finger tips
2007-06-19T16:36:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	Whoa, hold on, that url gave me, I think I just found out after re-doing it again
2007-06-19T16:36:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	I must have missed something when I was reading that url you gave me before
2007-06-19T16:36:00.000Z	tck		:)
2007-06-19T16:37:00.000Z	tck	TheVault	if it doesn't have an immediate effect try Ctrl+alt+backspace key to restart GDM
2007-06-19T16:38:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	Alrighty
2007-06-19T16:38:00.000Z	TheVault	tck	Thanks, I missed something earlier when I was trying to change it. Thanks 4 the help :D
