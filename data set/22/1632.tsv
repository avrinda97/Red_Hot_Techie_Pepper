2010-03-08T15:08:00.000Z	josh-N		hello, when i want to access an AppleShare IP server (not provide one), do i still have to install netatalk?
2010-03-08T15:10:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	i don't believe so. it looks like ubuntu kernels ship with the appletalk kernel module, so it should Just Work
2010-03-08T15:11:00.000Z	josh-N	brjann	can you point me to some sort of tutorial on how to access such a server?
2010-03-08T15:11:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	i can certainly look :) just a moment
2010-03-08T15:12:00.000Z	josh-N	brjann	thanks alot. all the info i found was on setting up a server.
2010-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	are you wanting to connect to disks or printers? or both?
2010-03-08T15:19:00.000Z	josh-N	brjann	setup is an old (ancient, rather) powerPC with a shared folder (so it's disk)... other macs can find the shared folder in the network browser... i want to access it with my ubuntu pc
2010-03-08T15:20:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	does that version of appleshare support samba? i see that some of them do
2010-03-08T15:21:00.000Z	josh-N	brjann	i don't think so. it's MacOS 9...
2010-03-08T15:23:00.000Z	brjann		i thought mod-ssl came with ubuntu's apache2 by default
2010-03-08T15:23:00.000Z	brjann		a2enmod ssl?
2010-03-08T15:25:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	still looking, but you're right, most everything is mac->linux, not the other way around
2010-03-08T15:27:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	have you tried anything like    mount -t afp afp://username:password@hostname/ShareName /mnt/ShareName    ?
2010-03-08T15:28:00.000Z	josh-N	brjann	no, gonna try that right away
2010-03-08T15:28:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	(make sure to mkdir /mnt/ShareName if you do try that)
2010-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	josh-N	brjann	it says: unbekannter Dateisystemtyp „afp“  (unknown FS type "afp")
2010-03-08T15:34:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	bummer. i guess it's got the appletalk protocol built into the kernel, but not the apple filesharing protocol
2010-03-08T15:35:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	oh, this might work for you: http://sites.google.com/site/alexthepuffin/home
2010-03-08T15:36:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	it's a fuse client for AFP access. there're apparently ubuntu .debs in the download area, and the page i just linked gives a quick overview of using the mount_afp utility
2010-03-08T15:40:00.000Z	josh-N	brjann	too bad there is no more "official" thing in the standard repositories. i'll try the client you linked to. thanks alot for your help.
2010-03-08T15:40:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	getting afpfs-ng integrated into ubuntu has been on the wishlist for a while, apparently
2010-03-08T15:41:00.000Z	brjann	josh-N	but you're welcome, and good luck
