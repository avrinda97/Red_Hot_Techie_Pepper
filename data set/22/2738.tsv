2009-03-23T09:52:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	to setup an SMTP server you usually need a domain name, and your IP needs to resolve back to that domain name, or some mail servers will reject anything you send
2009-03-23T09:53:00.000Z	deepz	mrsteveman1	where will i set domain name?
2009-03-23T09:53:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	do you have a domain name?
2009-03-23T09:54:00.000Z	deepz	mrsteveman1	yes
2009-03-23T09:54:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	is it set in the hosts file?
2009-03-23T09:56:00.000Z	deepz	mrsteveman1	yes it is set in host file
2009-03-23T09:56:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	does your ISP have RDNS pointing your domain back at this IP?
2009-03-23T09:56:00.000Z	mrsteveman1		what is the SMTP error btw
2009-03-23T09:58:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	follow that community documentation i posted here https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/postfix.html
2009-03-23T10:00:00.000Z	deepz	mrsteveman1	Its about postfix.. But i have installed sendmail
2009-03-23T10:00:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	ok, but what is the SMTP error?
2009-03-23T10:02:00.000Z	deepz	mrsteveman1	No socket found
2009-03-23T10:03:00.000Z	deepz	mrsteveman1	And if i try with other server name it shows SMTP protocol ERROR
2009-03-23T10:05:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	not sure, make a thread on the forum
2009-03-23T10:06:00.000Z	deepz	mrsteveman1	Can you tell me how to find smtp server address?In which path we set it?(etc/....)
2009-03-23T10:07:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	it should be in /etc/sendmail
2009-03-23T10:09:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	might also be in /etc/mail
2009-03-23T10:14:00.000Z	mrsteveman1	deepz	sudo sendmailconfig
