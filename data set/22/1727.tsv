2010-09-06T02:10:00.000Z	NitzchONot		Hello guys, how can i mount a NTFS drive with write permitions ? What do i have to use at fstab file ? :\
2010-09-06T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	you don't have to do anything special, just plug it in
2010-09-06T02:12:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	it's not an External Drive actually... it's Internal. Actually, what i try to do, it's to set my VMBox's Virtual Drive, to store the OS's there
2010-09-06T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	host os is ubuntu?
2010-09-06T02:13:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	yes, its Ubu 10.04
2010-09-06T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	you want it automatically mounted using fstab?
2010-09-06T02:14:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	i got that part. all i want to do is my VirtalMachine to store the drives (and the client OS) over there. I had that issue (about the permissions) before too..
2010-09-06T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	that page tells you the proper options to use in fstab so that you can write
2010-09-06T02:22:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	any idea how do i unmount an already mounted device ? It says "Only root can unmount"
2010-09-06T02:22:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	prefix your command with "sudo"
2010-09-06T02:23:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	i didn't use a command, thats what im looking for :D (I used Disk Utility) :p
2010-09-06T02:23:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	but then this isn't ubuntu?  in ubuntu it would be: sudo umount /mount/directory/or/block/device
2010-09-06T02:24:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	i just didnt know the command :D
2010-09-06T02:27:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	the command it's not "unmount" but "eject" :)~
2010-09-06T02:28:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	ok
2010-09-06T02:28:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	it's "umount" not "unmount" in ubuntu by the way
2010-09-06T02:29:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	Looks like :D Both do the same i guess :) (Almost) :)
2010-09-06T02:34:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	that should work, yeah
2010-09-06T02:35:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	thanks again! :D
2010-09-06T02:35:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	no problem
2010-09-06T02:35:00.000Z	jrib	NitzchONot	you don't need to unmount, by the way you can just pass -o remount to mount
2010-09-06T02:37:00.000Z	NitzchONot	jrib	i thought that will be safer. Next time i'll know better, thanks for the tip! :)
