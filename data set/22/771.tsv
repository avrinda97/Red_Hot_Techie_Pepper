2011-03-21T23:16:00.000Z	porin		I'm trying use wubi and it goes through the install asks me to reboot but when I reboot and choose ubuntu it keeps saying it can't find the installation.iso I can see it in the directory with all the other wubi stuff, is it because it isn't on my c:\?  or did i do something else wrong?
2011-03-21T23:18:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	What
2011-03-21T23:18:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	What error message are you getting?
2011-03-21T23:19:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	If the wubi has been done, the ISO shouldn't matter.
2011-03-21T23:19:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	Infact, last time I checked there wasn't an ISO used for wubi
2011-03-21T23:20:00.000Z	porin	jpollard	it says cannot find installation.iso and says i should reboot into windows run chkdsk and try again, I've done that a few times and it just keeps saying that... I ran wubi.exe from the 10.10 cd and it asked where I want it I picked my bigger drive and it did its install and said it has to reboot, when I rebooted there was a ubuntu option and i get that error after clicking it
2011-03-21T23:21:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	Right. Once it asks you to reboot, the WUBI should be done. I assume therefore it is probably the case of a corrupt installation.
2011-03-21T23:21:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	You may want to undo the WUBI, redowload WUBI and try again.
2011-03-21T23:22:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	By 10.10 CD do you mean one manafactured by Cananocle?
2011-03-21T23:22:00.000Z	porin	jpollard	no i just downloaded the iso that it linked to from the main site
2011-03-21T23:24:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	I suggest removing the WUBI, downloading it again, and trying again.
2011-03-21T23:25:00.000Z	porin		ok ill try that
2011-03-21T23:26:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	Wait. Are you trying to wubi to two different drives?
2011-03-21T23:26:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	I'm not sure if you can do that.
2011-03-21T23:26:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	I think Ubuntu and Windows must be on the same hdd.
2011-03-21T23:27:00.000Z	porin	jpollard	I was trying to install it to my D: because my C: is a small SSD meant just for windows
2011-03-21T23:27:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	Ah. I don't think that is a possibility. I recommend just trying a standard install.
2011-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	porin		mm ok, could I possibly install it on a external HD or flash drive?
2011-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	You could try using UnetBootin
2011-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	It lets you install it to a memory stick.
2011-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	porin		thanks
2011-03-21T23:28:00.000Z	jpollard	porin	That you can boot from.
