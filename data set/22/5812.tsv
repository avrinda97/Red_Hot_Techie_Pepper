2008-01-06T23:48:00.000Z	RenatoSilva		I'm perfectly logged in on Launchpad, but on wiki.ubuntu.com/RenatoSilva, it tells me that I'm not allowed to edid that page. What's the solution?

2008-01-06T23:50:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	you may have to log into the wiki
2008-01-07T00:10:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	Wiki doesn't accept my Launchpad data
2009-11-23T23:57:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	you shouldn't need more swap then 1x ram unless you don't have much ram
2009-11-23T23:58:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	that's the reason of the question, if you google out there, you see "it's recommended", "it's better", but no one explains WHY
2009-11-23T23:58:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	that's outdated advice
2009-11-23T23:59:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	the current recommendation is 1x ram so you can hibernate
2009-11-23T23:59:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	I see no reason to have more than 1x ram if you have a reasonable ammoun of ram
2009-11-23T23:59:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	correct
2009-11-24T00:02:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	http://superuser.com/questions/16280/swap-partition-size-for-4gb-ram
2009-11-24T00:03:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	*outdated* advice
2009-11-24T00:03:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	"In fact I recommend 2 * RAM + 1 MB so that there is absolutely room to swap out 2 entire copies of memory. This avoids the "shell game" scenario which can have negative performance repercussions. What this will do for you is guarantee a level of resiliency should you encounter an extraordinary event with your system."
2009-11-24T00:04:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	why are you quoting that to me?
2009-11-24T00:04:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	I had seen that page, there's no eplanation there, just formulas based on ram and hd sizes
2009-11-24T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	ask the person who gave you that advice to justify it.  I am telling you that with the amount of ram on modern systems there isn't need for that much swap.  You should never even hit swap.  You should have 1x ram swap just because you need it to hibernate
2009-11-24T00:10:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	and how does that answer the initial question? NO ONE is asking about what to do, what is the magic formula. I am asking if anyone KNOWS the TECHNICAL reason that would give base to the 2x advice. And I'm NOT reffering to just "if you have small RAM". That doesn't seem to explain anything to me either, because for small ram the 2x  has no special meaning other than increasing the size to a good level. There's no special meaning in the 2x, at least
2009-11-24T00:12:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	I did answer your question.  I told you to ask the person that gives the 2x advice.
2009-11-24T00:12:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	ah selfish
2009-11-24T00:13:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	stop talking to me, I appreciate
2009-11-24T00:14:00.000Z	jrib	RenatoSilva	unfortunately, I am unable to mind read other people.  It's like asking me to explain why someone told you the moon was made out of cheese
2009-11-24T00:16:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	jrib	oh, let me /ignore you, just a moment :)
