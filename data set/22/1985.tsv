2009-11-18T19:29:00.000Z	markizano		[I'm on Karmic] - I just re-installed the package GDM and now I can't login to my main profile via X
2009-11-18T19:30:00.000Z	markizano		anybody know what would keep a user from being able to login?
2009-11-18T19:30:00.000Z	markizano		after I login, the screen flashes and then i'm led back to the GDM login screen
2009-11-18T19:31:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	/why/ did you reinstall gdm?
2009-11-18T19:32:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	I had accidentally uninstalled it when i targeted gvfs
2009-11-18T19:32:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	gvfs for uninstall...
2009-11-18T19:32:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	err.... why do you want to uninstall gvfs?
2009-11-18T19:33:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	do you have gvfs installed at the moment or not?
2009-11-18T19:33:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	idk, I jst had this thing about that ~/.gvfs folder and nothing being able to access it, debian works fine without it, so why not?
2009-11-18T19:33:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	currently, no
2009-11-18T19:35:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	I don't know too much about gvfs but gnome uses it for quite some things, and debian iirc has an older version of gnome, can you try to install ubuntu-desktop and see if that fixes your issue?
2009-11-18T19:35:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	i dn't either and is one of the reasons I removed it :P
2009-11-18T19:37:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	well, hard to debug then, looked at ~/.xsession-errors?
2009-11-18T19:39:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	uhm... .xsession-errors just reports some missing file from a previous bashrc: `shopt not found' I just took those lines out
2009-11-18T19:40:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	well, can you try to install ubuntu-desktop and see if you can login after that? If it does not just remove everything it installed again
2009-11-18T19:41:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	ok, i just installed ubuntu-desktop and it looks like it has the other packages that were removed when I took out gvfs, so I'm going to try that
2009-11-18T19:41:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	thanks much :)
2009-11-18T19:41:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	ubuntu-desktop is a package that doesn't do anything except pull in everything that is needed to run the default ubuntu-desktop
2009-11-18T19:42:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	so installing that should make sure that you have at least the original installation apps installed
2009-11-18T19:42:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	yea, looks everything is back to normal, including gvfs :S but if it works i'm not going to mess with it again ... thanks again =)
2009-11-18T19:43:00.000Z	yofel	markizano	yw
2009-11-18T20:19:00.000Z	markizano	yofel	ok, so I think I found out why I'm not able to login with my main profile...
