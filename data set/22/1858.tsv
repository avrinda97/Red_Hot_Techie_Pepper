2010-07-12T21:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sprung	 move/rename the .mozilla directory and try firefox with a new fresh 'setup'
2010-07-12T21:15:00.000Z	sprung	Dr_Willis	That worked, but it sucks that I lose all my preferences
2010-07-12T21:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sprung	 move them back i guess.. your preferances are causing the issues
2010-09-11T16:07:00.000Z	sprung	Dr_Willis	your raid question was too vague to answer, and i suspect was intentionally so

2010-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	sprung	Dr_Willis	 are you drunk?
