2007-12-06T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	v-dogg	does windows boot okay by the way?
2007-12-06T17:40:00.000Z	v-dogg	jrib	no, gives Error 13
2007-12-06T17:41:00.000Z	v-dogg	jrib	that is "Invalid or unsupported executable format"
2007-12-06T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	v-dogg	and you haven't switched the order around in bios?
2007-12-06T17:42:00.000Z	v-dogg	jrib	order of the disks? no
2007-12-06T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	v-dogg	hmm, since there are really only 3 possibilities, go to grub, press 'e' and try all possibilities: hd0, hd1, (hd2 is what it is trying now)
2007-12-06T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	v-dogg	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=442945 look at what happened here too
2007-12-06T17:46:00.000Z	v-dogg	jrib	changed to hd1 and it booted!
2007-12-06T17:47:00.000Z	v-dogg	jrib	so now I just have to try what makes windows boot and make these changes to grubs config/installation?
2007-12-06T17:56:00.000Z	v-dogg	jrib	thank you very much for all the help
2007-12-06T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	v-dogg	yeah that should work.  You should find what you need for windows too now
