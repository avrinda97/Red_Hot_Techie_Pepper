2008-02-14T07:22:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^		why is that I already set the ip, dns, gateway. . I still cannot ping the dns ip ?
2008-02-14T07:22:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	check your gateway
2008-02-14T07:23:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^		[10:41] <cyberjames> ^cLuBk|d^: check your gateway  <-- the gateway and the dns have the same ip
2008-02-14T07:24:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	how about the subnet mask? are you using class c ip address?
2008-02-14T07:24:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^		yes cyberjames: 192.168.x.x
2008-02-14T07:25:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^		but still cannot find the reason why i can't ping on 192.168.x.1
2008-02-14T07:25:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	what's your sub/netmask?
2008-02-14T07:25:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^	cyberjames	255.255.255.0
2008-02-14T07:26:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	are you using broadband router?
2008-02-14T07:27:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^	cyberjames	yes. .
2008-02-14T07:27:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	are you able to ping the internet?
2008-02-14T07:28:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^	cyberjames	no, even the dns and the gateway. but I set the correct values
2008-02-14T07:29:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	do you use firewall?
2008-02-14T07:29:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^	cyberjames	yes,
2008-02-14T07:29:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	check your firewall rules..
2008-02-14T07:30:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^	cyberjames	is it okay if the firewall is windows?
2008-02-14T07:31:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	yes as long your rules will not reject your ubuntu pc..
2008-02-14T07:32:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	much better to try disable first your firewall and see how it will goes on...
2008-02-14T07:32:00.000Z	^cLuBk|d^		[10:50] <cyberjames> ^cLuBk|d^: yes as long your rules will not reject your ubuntu pc..  <---- how will i set it so that it will not reject my ubuntu?
2008-02-14T07:33:00.000Z	cyberjames	^cLuBk|d^	sorry, I have no idea on how do you manage your firewall as you mentioned earlier  that it is running under window$
