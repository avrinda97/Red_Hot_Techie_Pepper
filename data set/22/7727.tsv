2006-01-12T06:21:00.000Z	sdaserver		Question: What's the best way to make my ubuntu machine a dedicated server for Internet use on my network?
2006-01-12T06:22:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	what you want it to do?
2006-01-12T06:22:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	"dedicated server for Internet use" is rather vagye
2006-01-12T06:23:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	I want it to stand as my Internet router, i guess
2006-01-12T06:23:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	I mean Internet gateway
2006-01-12T06:24:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	And then it should also work as my DHCP server
2006-01-12T06:25:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	dhcp server for "internal" network and NAT-router?
2006-01-12T06:26:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	install base system, configure networking to route and do NAT
2006-01-12T06:27:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	I'm a newbie in Linux (3 days old), and i'm still lost at how to configure networking services
2006-01-12T06:27:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	for nat your /etc/network/interfaces should have "up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o [externalinterface]  -j MASQUERADE" under you internal interface conf
2006-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	you either edit text files under /etc/network or use gui tools provided
2006-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	The last thing I was trying was webmin, but i can't login
2006-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	i prefer editing text-files, its simple
2006-01-12T06:29:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	I could try that, text-file editing
2006-01-12T06:29:00.000Z	TTilus	sdaserver	i think you should start from linux tutorial before running into configuring router, ok?
2006-01-12T06:29:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	yeah, i'm researching online for more info
2006-01-12T06:30:00.000Z	sdaserver	TTilus	I am getting what you mean though coz i ran across the iptables thing sometime yesterday
