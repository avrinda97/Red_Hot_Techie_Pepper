2008-02-26T02:50:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	did you run it with sudo?
2008-02-26T02:46:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	yes, just ask your question
2008-02-26T02:48:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	I do not have an X Server Color Configuration option in my copy of nvidia-settings and I need to adjust the gamma/contrast on one of my monitors.
2008-02-26T02:49:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	it should be under X Screen 0 -> X server Color Correction
2008-02-26T02:50:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	there are no modules to load into nvidia-settings
2008-02-26T02:50:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	I realize that, I am saying I do not have it
2008-02-26T02:50:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	yes..
2008-02-26T02:51:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	odd, should be there. don't know why it wouldn't be
2008-02-26T02:51:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	me neither, that's why I figured I'd ask if the new version was different for some reason
2008-02-26T02:52:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	i don't think it is...i just installed mine a day or so ago...
2008-02-26T02:52:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	did you bother to install the nvidia drivers?
2008-02-26T02:52:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	yeah... obviously...
2008-02-26T02:54:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	using 1.0-9631
2008-02-26T02:56:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	using nvidia driver 1.0-9631 if that helps you
2008-02-26T03:08:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	http://tinyurl.com/335ome
2008-02-26T03:09:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	click on OpenGL Settings and see if it has an option "Allow gamma correction for antialiased lines"
2008-02-26T03:10:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	no I do not have that option
2008-02-26T03:12:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	did you let nvidia settings detect your monitor?
2008-02-26T03:12:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	I edited my xorg conf after installing the nvidia-glx driver
2008-02-26T03:13:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	let nvidia-settings detect your monitor, it might add settings when you do that
2008-02-26T03:14:00.000Z	utkan0s	bluefox83	no chnge
2008-02-26T03:14:00.000Z	bluefox83	utkan0s	your monitor might not support gamma correction then
