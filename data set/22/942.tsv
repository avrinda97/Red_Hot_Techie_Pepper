2012-07-18T08:44:00.000Z	Jonii		I have Ubuntu 12.04, and I'd like to have a separate launcher and separate place where I can access programs that I have opened
2012-07-18T08:45:00.000Z	Jonii		Are there any good solutions to this? I had a quick glance of Apple OS X way of handling launcher, I liked that
2012-07-18T08:45:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	dash stores recent files and apps you have used..
2012-07-18T08:47:00.000Z	Jonii	ActionPa1snip	sure, but I'd like to have a nice, clear launcher that's either overview of all programs installed or overview of select few programs I might want to use
2012-07-18T08:47:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	like so: http://www.linuxnov.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Dash-Home-Unity-5.2-Ubuntu-12.04-LTS-Precise-Pangolin.png
2012-07-18T08:48:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	you are describing dash, the 2nd icon at the bottom shows all the installed apps, the first are the recent apps and files..
2012-07-18T08:48:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	there is gnomedo I guess
2012-07-18T08:48:00.000Z	Jonii	ActionPa1snip	6 partially random programs with 2 clicks is not good enough. I'd want to have a selection of 10+ programs with 1 click
2012-07-18T08:49:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	those are the recent programs, not random at all
2012-07-18T08:49:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	whatever you use it will be 2 clicks or a press and a click, think about it
2012-07-18T08:49:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	or you can press ALT+F2 and type app names
2012-07-18T08:50:00.000Z	Jonii	ActionPa1snip	win button seems a lot easier
2012-07-18T08:50:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	anything you use will need 2 clicks though, one to initiate the selector, and the next to select, so how you get 2 clicks being not good enough is a mystery.
2012-07-18T08:52:00.000Z	Jonii	ActionPa1snip	with launcher as it is, you can have any program on launcher with 1 click. Also, the limitation of there being only 6 programs is a serious one, and the final nail to that coffin is how the list of programs displayed is not customizable
2012-07-18T08:52:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	you can add apps to the launcher as you need
2012-07-18T08:53:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	you can slide it up and down and selct what you need and the launchers will compress etc
2012-07-18T08:53:00.000Z	Jonii	ActionPa1snip	that is true, but i want to separate launcher and open window manager
2012-07-18T08:54:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	I don't think that is possible, you could add a dock
2012-07-18T08:55:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	you could add a dock like AWN or docky, you can't get another Unity launcher
2012-07-18T08:56:00.000Z	Jonii	ActionPa1snip	I'd like to get rid of Unity Launcher, actually
2012-07-18T08:58:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	you could enable the scale compiz plugin and use a hot cornet like Mac does to show all windows
2012-07-18T08:59:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Jonii	you could install Xubuntu instead then run a tonne of docks, one for each desktop side
