2006-12-10T17:42:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	It's just that I tried the NetworkManager out, I removed after and now every single app. takes forever to load. Even the logon.
2006-12-10T17:43:00.000Z	snype	Dev05	never heard of that
2006-12-10T17:44:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	Vitals? I don't really think so... Do you know what's the name of the log viewer?
2006-12-10T17:45:00.000Z	snype	Dev05	did u uninstall network-manager-gnome
2006-12-10T17:45:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	Yes.
2006-12-10T17:46:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	And it seems like it's just me. If I run gksu synaptic, it comes up like light. I'll try your command ;)
2006-12-10T17:47:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	Installing Ubuntu desktop installs lots of stuff that I had removed a long time ago.
2006-12-10T17:49:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	I still don't get the point... Everything was right even though I had removed all those packages. The issue appeard with the NetworkManager install/remove... I'll be right back.
2006-12-10T17:50:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	?
2006-12-10T17:50:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	Alright, I'll install Ubuntu-Desktop. :)
2006-12-10T06:03:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	It's still as bad.
2006-12-10T06:04:00.000Z	snype	Dev05	my sugestion----- download iso and reinstall
2006-12-10T06:04:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	Yeah, that's exactly what I had in mind but... It's also just what I don't want to do :)
2006-12-10T06:05:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	It'll be the 8th time! No, it's too much, a really bad reputation! :)
2006-12-10T06:05:00.000Z	snype	Dev05	reputation?
2006-12-10T06:06:00.000Z	Dev05	snype	That doesn't exist in English?
