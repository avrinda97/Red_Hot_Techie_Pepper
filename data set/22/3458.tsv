2008-10-16T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	blak	so after you generate the download script, download it
2008-10-16T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	blak	make sure you just copy to /var/cache/apt/archives/ and then use APT or synaptic normally.  And make sure you are not mixing ubuntu versions
2008-10-16T05:28:00.000Z	blak	jrib	how do i know if i am mixing ubuntu versions
2008-10-16T05:28:00.000Z	jrib	blak	I mean just make sure both are hardy, or both are gutsy, etc.

2008-10-16T05:37:00.000Z	blak	jrib	how do i make sure after using the generation script it is in  /var/cache/apt/archives/
2008-10-16T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	blak	umm, you download a bunch of debs on one machine right?  Then when you copy them to the other machine, you put them in /var/cache/apt/archives/

2008-10-16T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	blak	I'd check out apt-zip for what you are doing.  It was intended for this sort of thing
2008-10-31T14:58:00.000Z	jrib	blak	hal is hot stuff!  what's wrong with your mouse?
2008-10-31T14:58:00.000Z	blak	jrib	all choppy upon movement  jrib

2008-10-31T14:59:00.000Z	jrib	blak	ps2 or usb?
2008-10-31T14:59:00.000Z	jrib	blak	it's a touchpad?
2008-10-31T15:01:00.000Z	jrib	blak	you're probably better off asking in the eee forums as I'm the problem is already addressed there.  You can check /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see how the touchpad is getting detected though.  And remember that input devices are ignored in xorg.conf now.  You need to use /etc/hal/fdi/policy/ to modify settings if you want
2008-10-31T15:13:00.000Z	jrib	blak	where are you looking?
