2007-07-30T16:43:00.000Z	spl0it		how do I disable a cdrom device?
2007-07-30T16:45:00.000Z	spl0it		well k3b is trying to use hdd (my old cdrw) and the system is hanging because of it, I disable that device in my bios, but it still tries to use it... so I want to disable the device so I can use k3b (proper device is hdc - my dvdrw)
2007-07-30T16:47:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	try 'gksudo k3bsetup' -- there might be an option to tell k3b to ignore the drive.
2007-07-30T16:49:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	- thanks
2007-07-30T16:50:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	nothing started with that command after I authenticated
2007-08-06T07:14:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	short of disabling it in the BIOS setup, I don't think it's possible without major surgery. What's the underlying problem you're trying to solve?
2007-08-06T07:14:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	I have disabled it in bios - its still showing up in dmesg - I can't load k3b, as it hangs on hdd (which is my older cd-rw).... if there isn't an easy way I'll just rip it out....
2007-08-06T07:16:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	I think I've found something...
2007-08-06T07:18:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	you could add a kernel option like hdc=noprobe
2007-08-06T07:19:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	ah hmm
2007-08-06T07:20:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	do you know how to do that?
2007-08-06T07:20:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	no I was just googling it...
2007-08-06T07:21:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	'gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst', add 'hdd=noprobe' at the end of the line that begins with '#kopt=', save, exit, run 'sudo update-grub'
2007-08-06T07:21:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	thanks
2007-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	do I need to remove the # before kopt??
2007-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	no
2007-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	okay - thanks
2007-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	it has a # because it's meant to be processed by update-grub, not by the bootloader itself.
2007-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	ah okay :)
2007-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	well its not in dmesg, lets see if k3b will load - thanks for the help
2007-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	soundray	spl0it	yw
2007-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	spl0it	soundray	victory :) - appreciate it.
