2009-09-23T17:28:00.000Z	tj83_		per session
2009-09-23T17:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 you can set up gdm to auto-login
2009-09-23T17:28:00.000Z	tj83_	Dr_Willis	yea, but not what i am after
2009-09-23T17:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 you can set up vncserver where you dont have to use  the current logged in user.
2009-09-23T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 no need to login via gdm at all.. ssh in, run vncserver, connect via vncviewer
2009-09-23T17:29:00.000Z	tj83_	Dr_Willis	yea i know that too... is what i am seeking that rare of a task?
2009-09-23T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 you dont want to vnc over the internet without running it throguh a tunnle either..
2009-09-23T17:29:00.000Z	tj83_	Dr_Willis	i have some experience :P
2009-09-23T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		 tj83_  so im not sure what you want to do.. but theres ways to get vnc going without gdm.
2009-09-23T17:30:00.000Z	tj83_	Dr_Willis	i dont care about vnc at all....
2009-09-23T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 and you could edit the gdm configs to auto-logion then restart gdm
2009-09-23T17:30:00.000Z	tj83_		this is potentially useful in providing support to noobs
2009-09-23T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 so ive totally lost what you are tryign to do then. :)
2009-09-23T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Oh 'noob support' :)
2009-09-23T17:31:00.000Z	tj83_		ok, say you have a box Dr_Willis and this user has an account obviously, NOT auto-login, and they are away from the machine, you have ssh access. but you still need to log them in, if you have the login info you should be able to do this some kinda way
2009-09-23T17:32:00.000Z	tj83_		Why not Rabbitbunny i mean if you have root access you SHOULD be able to do whatever you need to do
2009-09-23T17:33:00.000Z	tj83_		ITS MY BOX! lol
2009-09-23T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Just because  You want to - dont mean you can.
2009-09-23T17:34:00.000Z	tj83_		here is the deal and it should make more sense, i like to log into my gdm, I like to play video/music for my girlfriend from ssh via mplayer. kinda a romantic kick
2009-09-23T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 theres also specific security features to block that kind of stuff. :)
2009-09-23T17:35:00.000Z	tj83_	Dr_Willis	hmm... well this is Linux, if i wanted to be told what i can and cant do by a machine i'd be using windows now wouldnt I? lol
2009-09-23T17:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tj83_	 whatever.
