2006-05-28T11:51:00.000Z	njan	sambagirl	have you looked at google calendar?
2006-05-28T11:53:00.000Z	njan	sambagirl	take a look at google calendar and see if it meets your needs.
2006-05-28T11:54:00.000Z	njan	sambagirl	as the name implies, it's an online service.
2006-05-28T11:54:00.000Z	njan	sambagirl	it has group calendar functionality, and supports icals, so you can access it using a client like evolution and by extension use it offline.
2006-05-28T11:54:00.000Z	sambagirl	njan	i want it to be on my site not on googles site.
