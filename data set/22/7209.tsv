2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	majd_		could somebody please help me connect my imac to my ubuntu?
2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	majd_		through ssh
2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	majd_		i can't figure it out
2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	majd_		i have openssh-server isntalled
2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	majd_		*installed
2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	How are your two computers set up, as far as network goes?
2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	majd_	Tonren	well, right now for testing purposes, they're on a LAN (although i'm trying to access it using my public ip
2006-08-15T11:23:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	Are they both connected to the same router?
2006-08-15T11:24:00.000Z	majd_	Tonren	yeah
2006-08-15T11:24:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	There is your problem!  When you try to access a computer using the WAN (public) IP, the router doesn't know which computer to forward the request to.
2006-08-15T11:24:00.000Z	majd_	Tonren	but i made port 93 forward to my ubuntu machine
2006-08-15T11:24:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	There are two solutions.  1) Connect using your LAN IP (the one starting with 192.168), or 2) Set up port forwarding on your router.  Since you are just testing, 1 is --  ah.
2006-08-15T11:25:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	So, what error message do you get?
2006-08-15T11:25:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	You may also be experiencing problems because sometimes, when you try to access your public IP address, your DNS server says, "That's yourself, you jerk," and you never actually get to the router.  In other words, sometimes it "Defualts" to localhost.
2006-08-15T11:26:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	Yeah.  Narrow it down
2006-08-15T11:27:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	That, or you can create a new user.
2006-08-15T11:28:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	This is when you're typing "ssh 192.168.2.***"?
2006-08-15T11:28:00.000Z	majd_	Tonren	one second
2006-08-15T11:30:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	It shouldn't... not on a LAN
2006-08-15T11:30:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	You shouldn't need to specify a port at all if everything is set up default.
2006-08-15T11:32:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	Odd that it closed the connection.
2006-08-15T11:32:00.000Z	Tonren	majd_	Would you mind PMing me with your IP so I can see what happens?
