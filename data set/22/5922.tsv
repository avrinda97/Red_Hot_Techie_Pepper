2007-02-01T16:29:00.000Z	adamonline45		I mean, socks server...
2007-02-01T15:05:00.000Z	adamonline45		I use nano, it's simple by the third time
2007-02-01T15:07:00.000Z	adamonline45		Does anyone know about "locate"?  I need to find a new file, but I think locate runs off a catalogue that doesn't have the new file _in_ it yet... any ideas? Update catalog? Different search tool?
2007-02-01T15:07:00.000Z	adamonline45		thank you :)
2007-02-01T15:08:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	sudo find / -iname string works well too
2007-02-06T07:57:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	unrar e whatever.rar
2007-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	Do I need to install something to do that?
2007-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	sudo apt-get install unrar
2007-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	easy enough :) Thanks again
2007-07-08T11:46:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	vim
2007-07-08T11:47:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	What's rm -rf?
2007-07-08T11:47:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	remove recursively, and force, don't prompt
2007-07-08T15:50:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	sudo shutdown -h now is what you are looking for
2007-07-08T15:51:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	TY once again
2007-12-09T04:58:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	what is your window manager
2007-12-09T04:58:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	KDE...
2007-12-09T04:58:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	so then the window manager is "kwin" iirc
2007-12-09T04:59:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	zzt32: No, that's the keyboard shortcut... My keyboard occasionally stops responding, so I'd like to create a shortcut so I can restart my WM using the mouse
2007-12-09T04:59:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	ok so you want to restart x not your window manager?
2007-12-09T05:00:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	I guess so :)  I thought those were the same thing...  Whatever <ctrl><alt><backspace> does :)
2007-12-09T05:00:00.000Z	bruenig	adamonline45	killall X should do it
2007-12-09T05:01:00.000Z	adamonline45	bruenig	ty :)
