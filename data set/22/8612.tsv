2005-08-02T10:02:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	one
2005-08-02T09:53:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	sounds like a feature. Whre are you looking for this option?
2005-08-02T09:54:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	when I put the dvd in the drive an icon comes on the desktop
2005-08-02T09:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	I never saw an option to play the dvd in there. When inserted, the dvds should start a media player program.
2005-08-02T09:55:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	it's not a movie, it's a dvd disk with mp3's on it
2005-08-02T09:57:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	any files?
2005-08-02T09:58:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	what?
2005-08-02T09:59:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	did you do what I told you?
2005-08-02T10:00:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	^ that will tell y ou if there are files on the dvd.
2005-08-02T10:01:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	when I do ls /media/cdrom0 it doesn't show any files and for cdrom1 it says doesn't exist
2005-08-02T10:02:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	how many drives do you have?
2005-08-02T10:02:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	ok, well, is there a dvd icon on your desktop?
2005-08-02T10:03:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	yeah
2005-08-02T10:03:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	is the disc rw?
2005-08-02T10:04:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	if the dvd is rw, then 100%iits empty. If it is r, 99% its empty.
2005-08-02T10:04:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	I just checked it in my other Ubuntu computer and it can read it fine
2005-08-02T10:05:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	show's all the files
2005-08-02T10:05:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	nice. Well, not sure, it would seem it is empty.
2005-08-02T10:06:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	the disk if defenetly not empy, any idea on what could be wrong?
2005-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	dabaR	Hackmo	agreed, it is not empty. No ideas.
2005-08-02T10:07:00.000Z	Hackmo	dabaR	ok thanks for your help
