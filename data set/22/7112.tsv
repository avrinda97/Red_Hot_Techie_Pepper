2006-09-27T07:15:00.000Z	OmniD		Would anyone have any clue as to why vmware refuses to start?
2006-09-27T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 run it from a terminal and see if any error messages show up?
2006-09-27T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 you are not using edgy are you?
2006-09-27T07:16:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	not using Edgy
2006-09-27T10:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 best to NOT use automatix
2006-09-27T10:09:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	why?
2006-09-27T10:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 it has a rather Large and Flame Filled History.. In short.. it can trash the system.
2006-09-27T10:10:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	thenw hy would anyone recommend me to use it??
2006-09-27T10:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 you DONT see people in here normally reccomending you to use it.
2006-10-15T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 to go 'network port to network port' you need a special net cable.
2006-10-15T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 and some configuration on the laptop
2006-10-15T08:20:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	a crossover cable right?
2006-10-15T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 yep. those canbe hard to find..
2006-10-15T08:22:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	okay what kind of configuration do I need
2006-10-15T08:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 'ip-masquerading' -  there may be some gui/interface tools to help set it up. I use routers now so aint messed with it in years.
2006-10-15T08:24:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	Oh, well I think I have a router somewhere around here
2007-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package is why.
2007-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	can you explain? It is very much needed right?
2007-06-17T09:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 ubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage that lists EVERYTHING ythats in 'ubuntu-desktop' default install.   by removing any packages it 'depends' on it gets removed as well. Its not a big deal.
2007-06-17T09:35:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	so when I uninstall it it shouldn't do much right? Also I don't recall it being there until I installed mplayer. It seems to be better off when I close the program entirely as well.
2007-06-17T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	OmniD	 ubuntu-desktop is there by default.  well not on Kubuntut
2007-06-17T09:37:00.000Z	OmniD	Dr_willis	I mean pulseaudio wasn't there by default.
