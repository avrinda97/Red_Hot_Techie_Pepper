2009-04-25T00:27:00.000Z	Aranel		is there any way to change mirrors? Servers too slow.
2009-04-25T00:27:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	what are you using now?  http?
2009-04-25T00:28:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	archive.ubuntu.com
2009-04-25T00:28:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	not the torrent?
2009-04-25T00:29:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	too many people use that server, you want to use a mirror
2009-04-25T00:29:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	yeah i need a mirror.
2009-04-25T00:29:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	or torrent, or sth else. i just want to speed it up :)
2009-04-25T00:32:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	do you know how can I switch to another mirror or use torrent?
2009-04-25T00:33:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	I don't know what you are doing, yet ... are you doing something that lets you pick the server?
2009-04-25T00:33:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	I'm using archive.ubuntu.com now and I want to use another server, its really crowded.
2009-04-25T00:34:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	what _program_ are you using?  or what did you _click_ on?
2009-04-25T00:34:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	update manager of KDE.
2009-04-25T00:35:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	Im using GUI for Updating to Jaunty. I clicked "Upgrade" and now Its upgrading it slowly.
2009-04-25T00:36:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	ok ... now I know what you are doing ... I don't know how to change server on that ... but I'd bet it can be done ... you'd have to stop the update, reconfigure your sources, and resume
2009-04-25T00:37:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	I thought maybe you were downloading an ISO or something
2009-04-25T00:38:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	ok I know what to do for editing sources but I need server links.
2009-04-25T00:38:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	that I don't know ... sorry
2009-04-25T00:38:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	np. thanks for your help :)
2009-04-25T00:39:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	what is the URL it is using, again?
2009-04-25T00:39:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	archive.ubuntu.com
2009-04-25T00:41:00.000Z	Skapare	Aranel	hmmm .. that hostname does have 5 IPs, all to canonical ... they should do the updates on a broader transparent mirror
2009-04-25T00:41:00.000Z	Aranel	Skapare	what about torrent?
