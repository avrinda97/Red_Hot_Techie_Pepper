2009-06-13T18:36:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	whats the problem?
2009-06-13T18:36:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	firefox doesn't start and I can't find it why
2009-06-13T18:37:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	what version of firefox is it?
2009-06-13T18:38:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	what is the output from this, cmdline: cd /usr/bin/; ls | grep firefox
2009-06-13T18:39:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	first it was 3.0.8 or something and it didn't start, so I upgraded it, not it's 3.0.11 and it is from repo
2009-06-13T18:40:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	builds of 2.5 are available via launchpad ppa
2009-06-13T18:40:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	I recommend installing 2.5 as a quick 'solution'
2009-06-13T18:40:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	sorry 3.5
2009-06-13T18:44:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	are you using jaunty?
2009-06-13T18:44:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	yes
2009-06-13T18:44:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	sudo apt-get install firefox-3.5
2009-06-13T18:50:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	when I type firefox-3.5, the output is "*NOTICE* No previous firefox profile found, starting with a fresh one" and "Segmentation fault"
2009-06-13T18:50:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	seg fault? it didnt run?
2009-06-13T18:51:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	unfortunately
2009-06-13T18:52:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	did this behaviour start suddenly?
2009-06-13T18:53:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	I was working in vista for about 3 weeks, then I started ubuntu, firefox doesn't start, I upgraded kernel and firefox, restarted, and firefox still doesn'r start
2009-06-13T18:55:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	do you have a relatively new install? it sounds like a reinstall would be the best way to fix the underlying problem.
2009-06-13T18:56:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	do you mean ubuntu? II have upgraded from hardy
2009-06-13T18:56:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	upgrading from hardy might have been the problem. It is usually recomended to upgrade from one release to the next
2009-06-13T18:57:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	oh I mean intrepid sorry
2009-06-13T18:58:00.000Z	dhalsimm	richj	I will do a fresh install, with ext4, thanks for your help and Halitech too ;)
2009-06-13T18:58:00.000Z	richj	dhalsimm	no worries
