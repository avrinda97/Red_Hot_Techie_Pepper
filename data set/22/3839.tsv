2008-09-11T09:22:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	 Winamp in Wine hummmmmmmmm  Linux has good native players these days
2008-09-11T09:23:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	I looked in the add/remove software dialogue, but didn't find many alternatives. The totem player is about as uncomfortable to use as it gets, and audacious seems to have huge performance issues.
2008-09-11T09:24:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	Audacious had extremely low sound volume for some reason too, despite every knob on the application and system being turned to maximum.
2008-09-11T09:25:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	Banshee is meant to be a lot better,  I haven't added that repo myself yet though
2008-09-11T09:31:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	It's not entirely clear on the page, do I install the package banshee or banshee-1?
2008-09-11T09:31:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	give me the link
2008-09-11T09:31:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	http://banshee-project.org/download/
2008-09-11T09:33:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	 you don't want that, you want this:  https://edge.launchpad.net/~banshee-team/+archive
2008-09-11T09:34:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	Ie, banshee-1?
2008-09-11T09:36:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	 yes just follow the instructions on this page:  https://edge.launchpad.net/~banshee-team/+archive
2008-09-11T09:46:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	It's never a good thing, but it's not a problem I can't cope with.
2008-09-11T09:47:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	I'll be trying them both for a while, thanks for the tip.
2008-09-11T09:47:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	 Amarok is one loads of peopel like
2008-09-11T09:47:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	might have spelt that wrong
2008-09-11T09:48:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	,but all music players I have tried sucked in some form or theo ther
2008-09-11T09:48:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	 I just use Rythombox
2008-09-11T09:49:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	 Winamp is crappy freeware from AOL
2008-09-11T09:49:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	and Windows only
2008-09-11T09:49:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	yes runs in Wine, but you should use native Linux apps when you can
2008-09-11T09:50:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	We'll see if Banshee will be able to replace winamp for me. Finding something that just works without some strange quirk has proven difficult for Linux applications in general.
2008-09-11T09:53:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Debolaz	 42 of the best free Linux audio software:   http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20080622143124178/Audio.html   I also have 3 of those for games
2008-09-11T09:57:00.000Z	Debolaz	SebNaitsabes	No, the problem is that the shares don't show up in the open dialogue despite that they are mounted.
