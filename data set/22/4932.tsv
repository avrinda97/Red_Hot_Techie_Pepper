2007-09-17T13:05:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		which is better - KDE or Gnome?
2007-09-17T13:06:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		what do u like?
2007-09-17T13:06:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	do you want 1234 answer?
2007-09-17T13:06:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	i like KDE, but that's just me. you can very easily try both at the same time
2007-09-17T13:13:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	"depends"
2007-09-17T13:13:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	LjL	details?
2007-09-17T13:13:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	/etc stores system-wide settings for (mostly) console programs and daemons (i.e. system services)
2007-09-17T13:14:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	application settings are generally in a hidden directory in a user's home
2007-09-17T13:14:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	generally speaking, each program puts its settings wherever it wants, in whatever format it wants
2007-09-17T13:14:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	so you can have, for example, /home/silent/.someprogram/someprogramrc ("rc" being a common suffix for "configuration file")
2007-09-17T13:15:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	GNOME programs, on the other hand, use the GConf framework, which is quite similar to the Windows registry, but more lightweight
2007-09-17T13:15:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	try typing "apt-cache show gconf-editor" if you want to peek at it
2007-09-17T13:17:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	it depends. it *does* leave "junk" around, and that's by design (you may want to re-install it later) -- whether it leaves it in plain files, or in GConf, it depends on whether the program is a GNOME program or not
2007-09-17T13:17:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	in either case, chances that it will affect you system's performances are about... zero
2007-09-17T13:18:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	as he said, only for *systemwide* settings.
2007-09-17T13:18:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	GUI applications that are configured by the single users have their settings saved in the user's home directory -- and those won't be "purged"
2007-09-17T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	all programs write to the home directory of the user who's using them. you can be sure that they'll never write anything outside of that directory (unless they run at root, in which case, however, their global settings *can* be purged)
2007-09-17T13:24:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	it does happen
2008-02-12T20:50:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	yes
2008-02-12T20:51:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	vmware or virtualbox
2008-02-12T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	_SiLENT_	i think vmware is fastest usually
2008-02-12T20:53:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	LjL	yeah but, MS VM is definitely worse
