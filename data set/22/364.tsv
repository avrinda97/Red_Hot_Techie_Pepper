2011-11-14T09:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	Natecat	boot a ubuntu cd and install it to that partition it has to be a ext type not a NTFS

2011-11-14T09:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	Natecat	wubu is not a partition install it is a file in windows as is limited to 30 gigs.

2011-11-14T09:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	Natecat	not knowing what you have done I can't answer, and you seem to have some wires crossed in your understanding not sure where, but as I have exsplained is how it is.

2011-11-14T09:51:00.000Z	Natecat		oh the installation size is how much data is on the VM
