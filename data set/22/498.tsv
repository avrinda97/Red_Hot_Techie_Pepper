2011-08-22T22:05:00.000Z	steinem		Hi, So I've installed ubuntu and xubuntu previously, and have had the wireless settings working right out of the box. Now, it doesn't even recognize my network card. I have a thinkpad t410 2516-CTO machine. Can anyone help?
2011-08-22T22:06:00.000Z	sharp66	steinem	was it enabled during install?
2011-08-22T22:06:00.000Z	sharp66		steinman, more importantly, is it enabled now?
2011-08-22T22:07:00.000Z	steinem		it is not enabled now
2011-08-22T22:07:00.000Z	steinem		ive tried lspci
2011-08-22T22:07:00.000Z	sharp66		steinman, does it show up in ifconfig?
2011-08-22T22:08:00.000Z	steinem		no wlan0
2011-08-22T22:09:00.000Z	steinem		eth0 and lo are only enabled
2011-08-22T22:09:00.000Z	sharp66		steinman, is the hardware light on (on the computer)
2011-08-22T22:09:00.000Z	steinem		no it is not
2011-08-22T22:10:00.000Z	sharp66	steinem	can you turn it on with the switch or Fn-F5?
2011-08-22T22:11:00.000Z	steinem	sharp66	no i cannot
2011-08-22T22:11:00.000Z	steinem		it does not work
2011-08-22T22:12:00.000Z	steinem	sharp66	where is the switch?

2011-08-22T22:12:00.000Z	sharp66		my t60 and w520 both have it on the front
2011-08-22T22:13:00.000Z	steinem		sharp it's on
2011-08-22T22:13:00.000Z	steinem		i'm going to try to install the drivers using ndisgtk
