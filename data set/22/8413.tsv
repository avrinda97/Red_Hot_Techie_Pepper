2005-12-19T17:03:00.000Z	fluvvell		someone was talking ftp servers, anybody familiar with proftpd? I have a question...
2005-12-19T17:04:00.000Z	kameron	fluvvell	yep, i've done proftpd server, etc. what's up?
2005-12-19T17:04:00.000Z	fluvvell	kameron	I hardly ever use ftp, but have to now.  I installed proftp, but having trouble making it go.  /etc/init.d/proftp reports that it must be started from inetd or xinetd.  Have made the appropriate file in xinet.d but its not going yet, what now?
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	fluvvell	kameron	also im offsite using ssh, not onboard with a gui desktop
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	fluvvell	kameron	on the private chat...

2005-12-19T17:19:00.000Z	kameron	fluvvell	you can't start the xinetd file?
2005-12-19T17:21:00.000Z	fluvvell	kameron	no, I've kind of forgotten, its been years since I played with xinetd
