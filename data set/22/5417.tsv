2008-10-04T16:14:00.000Z	mindframe		should 1680x1050 work with the default ubuntu usplash theme?
2008-10-04T16:14:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	yes
2008-10-04T16:16:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	so startup manager doesnt have an option for 1680x1050.  if i set it in /etc/usplash.conf how do i get the theme to use it?
2008-10-04T16:17:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	I am not sure, for me I just select the theme and it usually works itself out
2008-11-08T10:37:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	are you using compiz and what graphics card?
2008-11-08T11:46:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	you still here?  sorry for delayed response.  compiz is disabled(it wont even let me enable it), nvidia 8600 GTS
2008-11-08T11:46:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	have you installed the graphics drivers?
2008-11-08T11:47:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	this is 64bit ubuntu and im using two 1680x1050 monitors in xinerama
2008-11-08T11:47:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	ah, can you just try one monitor and see if compiz works?
2008-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	err i have no desire to use compiz honestly
2008-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	I know from my own experience with an 8800GTS that dual monitors at 1680x1050 and 1920x1080 can cause massive graphical slowdowns
2008-11-08T11:49:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	does it happen with only one monitor?
2008-11-08T11:49:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	it didnt seem nearly this slow in hardy though.,.. maybe im imagining
2008-11-08T11:56:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	yeah its significantly faster w/out the 2nd monitor... anything i can do to improve the performance?
2008-11-08T11:56:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	is video memory the issue or what?
2008-11-08T11:57:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	well i take that back, switching windows is still nowhere near snappy as it should be
2008-11-08T11:57:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	noticeable delay when drawing the new window
2008-11-08T11:59:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	you can try add the line Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True" to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-11-08T11:59:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	seems that compiz is making things much faster, due to acceleration i guess.  how can i get compiz to work w/ dual monitors?
2008-11-08T12:00:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	erm in the Section "Device" area
2008-11-08T12:01:00.000Z	mindframe	ziroday	so compiz wont work with nvidia xinerama?
2008-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	ziroday	mindframe	mmm, I know compiz will have issues
