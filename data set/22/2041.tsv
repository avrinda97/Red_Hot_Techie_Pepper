2011-03-09T10:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	ok so we should be able to do that with a liveusb I would think
2011-03-09T10:03:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	.?
2011-03-09T10:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	de-lvm you system?  you will need to create a disk with none lvm and copy the files to that
2011-03-09T10:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	oh I guess I'm not sure what you want you can have ext4 on lvm
2011-03-09T10:06:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	? I want to copy all my diles from my partitions on my lvm to my external hd
2011-03-09T10:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	ok the just sudo cp -a /root/of/sorce/mount/  /root/of/destination/moun/  and that will be done.  do you know how to mount partitions?
2011-03-09T10:09:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	Ummm... I can't mount them because lvm2 isnt installed
2011-03-09T10:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	the disk is already in lvm2 format?
2011-03-09T10:09:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	Yeah
2011-03-09T10:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	also the livecd iso for alternate adition has the lvm stuf built in
2011-03-09T10:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	but I think you can install the needed packages on that live session to do the job, I'll find the packages
2011-03-09T10:11:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	I know the packages. They wont install because vmlinuz is not accessible from usb
2011-03-09T10:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	ok try the alternate adition then
2011-03-09T10:12:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	Im using the desktop one
2011-03-09T10:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	yes I understand but desktop live kernel seems to not have the needed stuf
2011-03-09T10:13:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	Ive already installed it,
2011-03-09T10:14:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	Ive already done this before. I just tried to do it from the usb startup disk, but apparently thats not possible
2011-03-09T10:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	funny this link says it can be done http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-over-lvm-filesystem
2011-03-09T10:16:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	Are you not reading or are you trolling me? I've already told you I have done it before on the CD
2011-03-09T10:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	mikeru	and this line sudo apt-get install lvm2  gives you that error?
2011-03-09T10:18:00.000Z	mikeru	sacarlson	Cant stat /vmlinuz
