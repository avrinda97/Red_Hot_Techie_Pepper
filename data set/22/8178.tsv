2005-12-10T07:18:00.000Z	Trashcan		is there a recovery disk to fix grub?
2005-12-10T07:19:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	your install cd for example..
2005-12-10T07:19:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	well, if you want to reinstall grub, yes.
2005-12-10T07:20:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	well _can_ depends on _what_ you _do_ ;)
2005-12-10T07:20:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	but yes, unless you choose the wrong things ;)
2005-12-10T07:32:00.000Z	Trashcan	djk_	so, if i were to, say, not have an install cd
2005-12-10T07:33:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	check the links ubotu sent you as well ;)
2005-12-10T07:33:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	the second link has a , added at the end, resulting in a not found site.. so delete that.
2005-12-10T07:43:00.000Z	Trashcan	djk_	can i pm you?
2005-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	if you are registered, yes
2005-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	although there are plenty of intelligent people here who'd be able to help as well ;)
2005-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	Trashcan	djk_	: just trying to avoid clutter, but i see your point :)
2005-12-10T07:50:00.000Z	djk_	Trashcan	better ask in here then. i'm not that advanced to properly help you with that.
