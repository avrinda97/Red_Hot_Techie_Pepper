2010-04-14T14:49:00.000Z	bazhang	goofrider	care to pastebin your sources.list?
2010-04-14T14:50:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	just all ubuntu repo's all hardy, hardy-security and hardy-updates, no hardy-backports
2010-04-14T14:52:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	if it helps i can paste it. But i can use apt-cache policy now and then u exactly where the dependancy conflict is
2010-04-14T14:52:00.000Z	bazhang	goofrider	okay
2010-04-14T14:54:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	libffi4 in hardy-updates and hard-secuirty are @ 4/2/4-1ubuntu*  , it requires gcc-4.2-base (4.2.3-2ubuntu7), which is what hardy main repo is shipping
2010-04-14T14:55:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	but gcc-4.2-base in  hardy-updates and hardy-security is at 4.2.4-1ubuntu*  , which is what i have installed now
2010-04-14T14:56:00.000Z	bazhang	goofrider	let me check launchpad for a moment
2010-04-14T14:57:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	if i downgrade to gcc-4.2-base=4.2.3-2ubuntu7 it removes a bunch of core packages
2010-04-14T14:59:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	i thouhgt about pulling libffi4 from intrepid, but that package is replaced by libffi5 in intrepid
2010-04-14T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	goofrider	cant see any bugs atm on launchpad; what important packages does it want to delete?
2010-04-14T15:03:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	i can pastebin that for u
2010-04-14T15:04:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/414215/
2010-04-14T15:05:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	basically it'll uninstall my entire system including base-files and libc6
2010-04-14T15:05:00.000Z	bazhang	goofrider	that looks like a total no-go as far as downgrading
2010-04-14T15:06:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	i know. and I can't pull a newer version of libffi4 that depends on the newer gcc-4.2, since there isn't a newer libffi4 package
2010-04-14T15:07:00.000Z	bazhang	goofrider	very strange it wont let you install ubuntu-desktop, really not seen that before
2010-04-14T15:07:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	i know it's very strange
2010-04-14T15:08:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	i'm gonna try to downgrade the core libs with explicit =verion# arguements
2010-04-14T15:10:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	either that or compile my own libffi4 package to work with the newer gcc libs
2010-04-14T15:11:00.000Z	bazhang	goofrider	sorry cant offer any advice at this point, not seen a bug at launchpad and that is a really weird error
2010-04-14T15:12:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	maybe i'll file that, right now i specify specific version of libc6 and libgcc1 to downgrade to and no more essential packages are removed, so i'm close
2010-04-14T15:42:00.000Z	goofrider	bazhang	geekphreak got ubuntu-desktop to install!!! had to explicitly downgrade gcc, glib6, libgcc, update-manager-core and a few others
