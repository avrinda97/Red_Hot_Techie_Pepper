2007-01-16T09:00:00.000Z	humbolto		I am trying to compile my own dapper kernel, but running into difficulties.
2007-01-16T09:01:00.000Z	humbolto		I have installed the sources package as well as the kernel-package
2007-01-16T09:01:00.000Z	humbolto		but when I do make menuconfig, I get a huge load of errors
2007-01-16T09:02:00.000Z	humbolto		I want the kernel compiled specifically for my transmeta cruseo
2007-01-16T09:03:00.000Z	humbolto		Another question is there a way to highlight responses to my nick in ircii?
2007-01-16T09:05:00.000Z	humbolto		The reason for my desire to have a crusoe kernel is, that I am experiencing system chrashes and I want to eliminate any possible reason.
2007-01-16T09:05:00.000Z	humbolto		But actually I think X is the problem.
2007-01-16T09:06:00.000Z	humbolto		How can I find out, what killed my system?
2007-01-16T09:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	check /var/log/messages.3.gz
2007-01-16T09:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	check /var/log/messages
2007-02-14T06:04:00.000Z	humbolto	frogzoo	I know that this is an acpi function! I mentioned the damn acpi for this damn laptop is broken earlier!
2007-02-14T17:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	certainly not supported
2007-02-14T17:51:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	feisty is alpha, nuf said
2007-02-14T06:01:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	did you enable ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE=true in /etc/default/acpi-support ?
2007-02-14T06:02:00.000Z	humbolto	frogzoo	what should that help?! This is some power saving stuff. Has nothing to do with a laptop shutting down the os but not powering off the damn hardware.
2007-02-14T06:03:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	that's an acpi function
2007-02-14T06:03:00.000Z	humbolto	frogzoo	what is an acpi function?
2007-02-14T06:04:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	turning off the power at shutdown
2007-02-14T06:05:00.000Z	frogzoo	humbolto	lots of people in support channels claim stuff is broken, doesn't mean it is
2007-02-14T06:05:00.000Z	humbolto	frogzoo	my info is accurate
2007-02-14T06:06:00.000Z	humbolto	frogzoo	and as I mentioned before, it is fixed in feisty
2007-02-14T06:06:00.000Z	humbolto	frogzoo	so how do I get the feisty kernel to run in edgy?
