2005-07-24T15:25:00.000Z	desrt		although you might succeed at upgrading it
2005-07-24T15:25:00.000Z	desrt		mumbles; locate
2005-07-24T15:25:00.000Z	desrt		vladuz976; yes.  i suspect that's what i meant when i said "keyboard indicator" :)
2005-07-24T15:26:00.000Z	desrt		vladuz976; btw... if you're just learning dvorak, then switching back and forth to qwerty is a very bad thing to do
2005-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	desrt		stodge; are you installing breezy?
2005-07-24T15:29:00.000Z	desrt		i suppose not :)
2005-07-24T15:29:00.000Z	desrt		breezy is the new version of ubuntu based on gcc4
2005-07-24T15:30:00.000Z	desrt		vladuz976; you have to setup a dvorak layout in the gnome keyboard settings
2005-07-24T15:31:00.000Z	desrt		jmspeex; that's fairly untrue
2005-07-24T15:31:00.000Z	desrt		as far as i know
2005-07-24T15:32:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	google for "gcc miscompiles KDE"
2005-07-24T15:33:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	Not to mention the general tendency for gcc to make sure they break some non-conformant code with every new release, but not too much because they need to save some for the next release.
2005-07-24T15:34:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	e.g. http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1004
2005-07-24T15:35:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	the issue with kde and gcc 4 is a *gcc* bug. They actually fixed it.
2005-07-24T15:37:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	I also have a problem with the fact that breaking code almost seems like a goal for the gcc devs.
2005-07-24T15:38:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	At least if they broke all non-conpliant code once instead of breaking more stuff for every release.
2005-07-24T15:39:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	Not to mention that inline assembly is now completely unreadable thanks to the removal of multi-line strings with no replacement at all.
2005-07-24T15:40:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	It's not legal C, but neither is inline asm, although it's necessary.
2005-07-24T15:42:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	I think some assemblers want the \t
2005-07-24T15:43:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	Right, is that a gcc policy ("everyone switch to OS X")?
2005-07-24T15:44:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	The main point is that multi-line strings were necessary because of the brain-dead inline assembly and then they just went on and removed it for no useful reason other than annoying people.
2005-07-24T15:45:00.000Z	jmspeex	desrt	Assembly is already ugly enough that I see no reason to make it even uglier on purpose.
