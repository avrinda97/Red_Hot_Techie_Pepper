2006-11-14T13:21:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	you go to your properties, and do it that way
2006-11-14T13:21:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	project properties, or whatnot.
2006-12-04T06:06:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	why not just bring svn with you on the USB?
2006-12-04T06:07:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	not allowed to install things, and i assume that every once in a while i'll realize another program i'll want/need
2006-12-04T06:07:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	You can run svn off of the USB disk, it doesn't need to be installed.
2006-12-04T06:08:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	i know but if i realize the need for another program (for example eclipse) and i don't have it on the usb disk, i'm screwed untill i go home and load eclipse onto the usb
2006-12-04T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	I'm not sure how booting into linux helps you there.  Are you not allowed to download stuff from the web?  I imagine if they restrict you from that, you won't be able to edit the BIOS to boot from a USB either
2006-12-04T06:10:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	but with a grub boot disk couldn't i?
2006-12-04T06:11:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	If they've locked down the computer so you can't download whatever programs you don't have and need, then they probably have the boot to HD only.
2006-12-04T06:11:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	i can download them, but if they've got an installer permissions are restricted and whatnot
2006-12-04T06:14:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	there are better distros especially suited for live environments, if you're bent on going that route.  That will fit/etc on a 2GB usb drive (and then some)
2006-12-04T06:15:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	any with a package manager?  I don't mind installing from source i'm very comfortable with it, but removing something you installed from source can be a pain in the ass, are there any that provide solutions for that?
2007-01-10T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	it's not FOSS?
2007-01-10T12:56:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	oh... lol
2007-01-10T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	actually, it is.  So, it's not in the repositories... because no one has put it there
2007-01-10T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	the Desktop CD has a liveCD, which boots, then there's an "install" link on the desktop, to install it
2007-01-10T13:02:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	or anyone else, how do you enable messages WITH usplash?  so that allme can figure out exactly where things are going wrong?
2007-01-10T13:03:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	remove the quiet and splash options from grub
2007-01-10T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	which can be done at the grub menu itself, by hitting "e" on the proper menu item, then removing them
2007-01-10T13:04:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	does that apply to the LiveCD?
2007-01-10T13:05:00.000Z	ademan	Flannel	do you mind working with allme?  I think he might be able to figure out where the problem is with his livecd if he enables bootmessages
2007-01-10T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	ademan	I... don't believe so.  However, you should be able to hit.. um, one of the F keys, to go into an advanced options thing, then you can remove them
