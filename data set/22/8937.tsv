2007-07-06T15:21:00.000Z	Exadus		Is it possible to install that on LiveCD?
2007-07-06T15:22:00.000Z	Exadus		But this is weird.
2007-07-06T15:22:00.000Z	Exadus		Can I use the inbuilt partioner in the installing program?
2007-07-06T15:23:00.000Z	Exadus		Anyone?
2007-07-06T15:24:00.000Z	Exadus		Okay, the installer partioner gives me only two options.
2007-07-06T15:24:00.000Z	Exadus		Use entire disk, and manual.
2007-07-06T15:25:00.000Z	Exadus		Does anyone know a good partioning program on Windows?
2007-07-06T15:26:00.000Z	Exadus		Thanks a lot.
2007-07-06T15:27:00.000Z	Exadus		Thing is, I already have Windows, don't want to kill it.
2007-07-06T15:27:00.000Z	Exadus		Okay.
2007-07-06T15:28:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	You can resize your windows partition without reformating it, and when you install Ubuntu it will automatically add an option to boot windows when you start your computer
2007-07-06T15:31:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	mrclark01 Enable compiz in 7.04 by going to System -> Preferences -> Desktop Effects ( it is installed by default but not enabled )
2007-07-06T15:55:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	You can change it in the properties somewhere ( only used the new partitioner once and didn't like it ) Gparted has a better interface if you want to use it to resize your NTFS partition it's on the LiveCD in System -> Administration -> Gnome Partition Editor
2007-07-06T15:56:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	Did you check the integrity of the CD?
2007-07-06T15:57:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	Did Gparted give you an error?
2007-07-06T15:59:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	If you actually want to learn how to use it ( I recommend it if you do a lot of text editing / coding ) run "vimtutor" in a terminal
2007-07-06T16:00:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	Sorry, that was for _Codeman_
2007-07-06T16:02:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	Well I know that gparted tries to fail early ( IE before anything is actually changed permanently ) if it is going to fail so hopefully nothing has actually happened to your NTFS partition
2007-07-06T16:03:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	But I would not install Ubuntu from that CD at least untill you can figure out what is wrong with the partition and / or why gparted failed
2007-07-06T16:04:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	If it was an error in parted, then the same error will occur with the installer's partitioner
2007-07-06T16:05:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	I have heard people reccomend that
2007-07-06T16:08:00.000Z	jordan_	Exadus	Some and Sometimes :)
