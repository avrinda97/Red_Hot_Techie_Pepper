2009-12-28T12:35:00.000Z	MindVirus		Hello. My baseline memory usage is 600MB. Can someone please suggest how to lower this number?
2009-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	MindVirus		-/+ buffers/cache:        621        377
2009-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	MindVirus		This is not a normal memory usage.
2009-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	alankila	MindVirus	run top, press M to sort by memory, what are near the top?
2009-12-28T12:37:00.000Z	alankila		M is shift+m, that is
2009-12-28T12:37:00.000Z	MindVirus	alankila	A few programs that I will not close.
2009-12-28T12:37:00.000Z	MindVirus		Namely, pidgin, dropbox, compiz.real, Xorg.
2009-12-28T12:38:00.000Z	MindVirus		Chromium takes a rather big chunk of memory but that's not baseline so I don't consider that.
2009-12-28T12:38:00.000Z	MindVirus		In total, the top 4 programs are running ~150MB.
2009-12-28T12:38:00.000Z	MindVirus		Top 10 is ~200MB.
2009-12-28T12:39:00.000Z	alankila		I'm not sure if the xorg and compiz memory usage is real memory of the graphics board memory... some of the X memory at least is that, could be that compiz's memory is too if it shares memory with X server
2009-12-28T12:39:00.000Z	MindVirus		The rest are measured in kilobytes.
2009-12-28T12:39:00.000Z	MindVirus	alankila	I don't understand.
2009-12-28T12:39:00.000Z	alankila	MindVirus	never mind.
2009-12-28T12:40:00.000Z	MindVirus	alankila	Right-o.
2009-12-28T12:40:00.000Z	MindVirus		So, I don't get why so much of my memory is being used baseline.
2009-12-28T12:40:00.000Z	MindVirus		I really don't see how GNOME can be run with 256MB RAM.
2009-12-28T12:40:00.000Z	alankila		I think my booted up Ubuntu uses about 500 MB of memory for the baseline stuff it's running... The real memory usage is 800 MB but 300 MB is going to Eclipse
2009-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	MindVirus		(Though many people say they do.)
2009-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	MindVirus	alankila	Why does Ubuntu use so much damn memory?
2009-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	MindVirus		And is there any way to fix it?
2009-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	alankila	MindVirus	long tail of small programs adds up, I guess.
