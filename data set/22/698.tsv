2011-05-03T09:40:00.000Z	Snakkah	inimeg	like I just said, I wasn't too pleased with Natty. I actually downgraded to 10.04 since it's supported until 2013. Hopefully Unity will mature by then. :D
2011-05-03T09:41:00.000Z	inimeg		i agree unity is not high on my list of W.M.
2011-05-03T09:42:00.000Z	Snakkah	inimeg	they do allow you to have the old interface though.
