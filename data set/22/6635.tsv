2006-11-08T15:39:00.000Z	Skyrail		Anyone know why transferring of files from MSN to Gaim is so slow? its driving me around the bend
2006-11-08T15:40:00.000Z	Skyrail		2.30kb/s is way to slow back on windows it used to be at least 50kb/s and I've downloaded files that fast before on Linux but not through MSN to Gaim...any ideas?
2006-11-08T15:41:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	gaim is not that good
2006-11-08T15:41:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	with file transfers that is
2006-11-08T15:41:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	you run dapper or edgy?
2006-11-08T15:42:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	er...6.06 lol I'm not too sure which one that is heh, what should I use instead?
2006-11-08T15:42:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	well 6.06 has gaim 1.* and 6.10 has gaim 2.* which has better support for file transfers
2006-11-08T15:43:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	to upgrade try running 'sudo update-manager -c'
2006-11-08T15:43:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	oh ok, well I can't get 6.10 so heh :( can I get 2.* on 6.06?
2006-11-08T15:43:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	it takes a while
2006-11-08T15:44:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	well it looks like I've started upgrading to 6.10 heh, will I lose all my stuff? not that I have alot on here...but
2006-11-08T15:45:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	probably not, but there is a teensy weensy possibility
2006-11-08T15:45:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	ok well I'm not too bothered, mainly bookmarks and favorites all of which found via google, er..a few files nothing that essential
2006-11-08T15:46:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	don't know if you come from a land called windows. But upgrading actually works as you would want
2006-11-08T15:46:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	all programs get upgraded too
2006-11-08T15:48:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	yeah I've just seen the file size then, too big for now anyway, maybe on a Saturday but not now :( maybe just the upgrades not the new ubuntu version
2006-11-08T15:50:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	last time I upgraded the desktop wouldn't load, what would I do if this happen again?
2006-11-08T15:53:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	? I can't upgrade until I know waht I'm doing otherwise I'll mess it all up again
2006-11-08T15:59:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	hehe that might be a good idea
2006-11-08T16:00:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	though i don't think there is a big chance you will mess things up
2006-11-08T16:00:00.000Z	Skyrail	StarQuake	last time I upgraded, I don't know if it was that or something else but when I loged on the screen was just the background nothing else started up
2006-11-08T16:02:00.000Z	StarQuake	Skyrail	mmm okay... too bad
