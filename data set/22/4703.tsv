2008-10-21T21:26:00.000Z	Luis__		Ill try re-seating it and if not then I'll just get another card.
2008-10-21T21:26:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	it actually recognizes your card you dont need to reseat it
2008-10-21T21:27:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	no it doesnt mean it its broke, it means it's fine
2008-10-21T21:27:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	dunno, when you did lspci it showed up
2008-10-21T21:29:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	I'm still thinking your not plugged up right, pastebin sudo lsmod and then i can narrow it down
2008-10-21T21:30:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	lol nm i forgot
2008-10-21T21:33:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	give me a sec
2008-10-21T21:34:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	do you still have that lspci pastebin link?
2008-10-21T21:35:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	nm i found it
2008-10-21T21:38:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	look for tulip and or dmfe in lsmod
2008-10-21T21:41:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	okay I'm convinced its not plugged in, I can't think of any other reasons, your card was detected the driver was loaded but it still doesn't work.
2008-10-21T21:42:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	I guess, the cat5 connects to your pc and router, everything else is automatic if your using dhcp
2008-10-21T21:43:00.000Z	binarymutant	Luis__	if your not using dhcp you would have had to manually set up your networking in windows
