2007-08-18T13:36:00.000Z	sayanriju	Yochua	chose custom soundbank radio button
2007-08-18T13:36:00.000Z	Yochua	sayanriju	 where do I pick that?
2007-08-18T13:37:00.000Z	sayanriju	Yochua	'choose' button beside the 'custom soundbank' radio
2007-08-18T13:37:00.000Z	sayanriju	Yochua	In the sound tab
2007-08-18T13:38:00.000Z	Yochua	sayanriju	 Sure...I just went to configure Tuxguitar, clicked sound and it says custom soundbank. Is that good?
2007-08-18T13:38:00.000Z	Yochua	sayanriju	 okay. Yeah. So just open the file? And that's it?
2007-08-18T13:38:00.000Z	sayanriju	Yochua	think so!! :D
2007-08-18T13:38:00.000Z	Yochua	sayanriju	 okay, I'll try it thanks
2007-08-18T13:38:00.000Z	sayanriju	Yochua	here is the refernnce : http://www.tuxguitar.com.ar/tgwiki/doku.php?id=doc:error_soundbank
2007-08-18T13:42:00.000Z	Yochua	sayanriju	 didn't work. I think I need to unzip the soundbank in the jre folder. Is that a hidden file in my home foldeR?

2007-08-18T13:43:00.000Z	Yochua	sayanriju	 haha. No. How can I check?
