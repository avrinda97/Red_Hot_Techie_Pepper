2012-09-25T05:59:00.000Z	Skapare		is there a way to avoid daemons auto-starting when doing an apt-get upgrade inside chroot?
2012-09-25T06:01:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	one source, so you may want to find more evidence that this works - http://lifeonubuntu.com/how-to-prevent-server-daemons-from-starting-during-apt-get-install/
2012-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	is that "cat < /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d" command really correct on that page you gave?  the file does not exist
2012-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	that's why I suggested you second-source it. It's not on an official wiki or site I know, and only has one comment to say it works
2012-09-25T06:12:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	seems to be incorrectly coded for the apparently purpose of creating that file
2012-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	the cat is reading the file that does not exist
2012-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	just sudo vi then file then.
2012-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	I don't understand what needs to be done
2012-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	is it supposed to create this file?
2012-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	create the file with the contents on the webpage using whatever method you know how to use. Or second-source a similar solution
2012-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	between cat and EOF
2012-09-25T06:16:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	it suggests that from the webpage, but I suggest you second-source conformation of this solution
2012-09-25T06:17:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	find another site that confirms that this is a solid solution
2012-09-25T06:18:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	best to be safe if it's not clear what the repercussions may be
2012-09-25T06:21:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	... looks like this is confirmation ... http://serverfault.com/questions/29544/how-do-i-stop-ubuntu-from-starting-daemons-ive-not-explicitly-asked-to-run
2012-09-25T06:26:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	yep - a bit old, and it does explain the pitfalls
2012-09-25T06:40:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	running the script with that "thing" in a fresh instance now ... should see in a few minutes
2012-09-25T06:59:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	it worked !! ... I do suggest if people ask for this in the future, give them the serverfault link instead ... it doesn't have the command typos
2012-09-25T06:59:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	I just googled it for you. I don't know this stuff
2012-09-25T07:08:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	well you had the right thought to google ... I didn't when I did it (came up with unrelated stuff)
2012-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	Skapare	somsip	once I had the info you found, googling that got more
2012-09-25T07:14:00.000Z	somsip	Skapare	yeah - all good
