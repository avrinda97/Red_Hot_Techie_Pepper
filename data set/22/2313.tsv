2009-07-19T22:05:00.000Z	NEBAP		hi, can somebody tell me where I can find the CCSM to change the settings?
2009-07-19T22:06:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	if you install the compizconfig-settings-manager it will end up up the system-menu, preferences
2009-07-19T22:06:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	thank you
2009-07-19T22:27:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	from what I've heard, you're better off installing eclipse from source.. the version in the repos might be out of date
2009-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	ok, is it possible to use a galileo package?
2009-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	I don't know what that is, sorry
2009-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	k thanks :)
2009-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	is xchat the most "common" irc client for ubuntu / linux?
2009-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	http://popcon.ubuntu.com/
2009-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	I think it's installed by default.. but it's been a while since I installed  a fresh ubuntu so I might be wrong
2009-07-19T22:30:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	which one? xchat
2009-07-19T22:30:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	yes
2009-07-19T22:30:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	or wait.. xchat-gnome
2009-07-19T22:30:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	ah ok, thanks :)
2009-07-19T22:31:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	xchat-gnome is a little shinier than xchat.. but doesn't have all the options/menus and stuff
2009-07-19T22:32:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	oh, thats ok I'm not using most of the "special" stuff ;)
2009-07-19T22:34:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	I'm just a total linux beginner, but I really like ubuntu :)
2009-07-19T23:19:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	if you want to edit a file in /etc   you could run "gksudo gedit /etc/yourfile"
2009-07-19T23:20:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	I want to use the File-Browser to edit the folder
2009-07-19T23:21:00.000Z	Slart	NEBAP	then it's gksudo nautilus.. but please be very very careful with that window
2009-07-19T23:21:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	thanks
2009-07-19T23:22:00.000Z	NEBAP	Slart	just want to manually install eclipse
