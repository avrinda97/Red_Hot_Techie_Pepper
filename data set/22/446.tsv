2012-07-16T21:30:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	when he ran that, let me know and we'll start from scratch
2012-07-16T21:15:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	niddersfied said hang on a sec
2012-07-16T21:15:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	thanks, i missed that
2012-07-16T21:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	heh, no worries .. never rush into things when changing grub
2012-07-16T21:27:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	niddersfied said it did not work now his monitor is stuck on the screen telling him "The current input timing is not supported by the monitor display. Please change your input timing to 1366x768@60Hz or any other monitor listed timing as per the monitor specifications." It wont even show him the login screen, he is stuck at that message and has no idea what to do now.
2012-07-16T21:29:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	ok, let him reverse what he did by using http://www.kyleabaker.com/downloads/ubuntu/scripts/plymouth-resolution-fix-revert-back.sh.zip
2012-07-16T21:30:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	how is he going to run it when he cant even get to his desktop?
2012-07-16T21:31:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	you are next to him, put the download on a stick and let him use recovery mode if he can get to that
2012-07-16T21:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	or let me know if he can boot to recovery mode if you will
2012-07-16T21:32:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	he cant even get to the grub menu, when he boots his pc, he sees the bios, after the bios, everything dissapears and then that monitor message appears and never goes away, he cannot do anything but go into his bios
2012-07-16T21:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	ok, do you guys have a live cd to boot from?
2012-07-16T21:33:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	yes
2012-07-16T21:34:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	let him boot that .. we'll try to fix things from there
2012-07-16T21:34:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	okay he is booting into it
2012-07-16T21:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	to make changes to his machine he'll have to chroot, do you know how to do that?
2012-07-16T21:37:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	I have no idea how to do that
2012-07-16T21:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	let me find a link, i'll guide you along but it's easier for you both if you have some clue of what we're attempting, hang on
2012-07-16T21:39:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	haha okay
2012-07-16T21:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	don't rush, perhaps take a read through that link Jordan_U provided and let us know when he's in the chroot
2012-07-16T21:43:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	Well after seeing that page, and all of the trouble he has been through with Linux already, he said he is going to go back to Windows, and he is going to go to our local computer store and buy the Ubuntu Bible I think it is called and study and get to know what he is doing before he jumps into this blind again.
2012-07-16T21:43:00.000Z	dagroves	glitsj16	He said thank you for your help though. He really appreciates it!
2012-07-16T21:44:00.000Z	glitsj16	dagroves	blind is indeed a hard way to get to know your system
