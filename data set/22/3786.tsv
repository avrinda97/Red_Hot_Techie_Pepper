2009-05-04T07:18:00.000Z	somatt		m25 that didn't do it
2009-05-04T07:20:00.000Z	somatt		I'm trying to get screen and rtorrent to run as my user at startup.  I used crontab -e by adding the line "@reboot /usr/bin/screen /usr/bin/rtorrent".  As root I've added my username to the /etc/cron.allow.  It still will not start up at boot.

2009-05-04T07:21:00.000Z	glitsj16	somatt	you might need a ";" between both commands i believe
2009-05-04T07:22:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	will try and let you know in about 1 minute
2009-05-04T07:32:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	that didn't work
2009-05-04T07:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	somatt	quite the experiment to get that @reboot to work it seems
2009-05-04T07:33:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	it is listed in the ubuntu documentation, there's no reason it shouldn't work
2009-05-04T07:33:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	it's quite frustrating at this point
2009-05-04T07:34:00.000Z	glitsj16	somatt	yes when i saw you mention the @reboot option i read the man, briefly, was unaware of an option like that
2009-05-04T07:34:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	it has to be run as me though so i can reattach at will upon login
2009-05-04T07:35:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	but i want it to run at bootup incase of power outage etc
2009-05-04T07:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	somatt	a nice old-skool oneliner script in your autostart folder won't cut it ?
2009-05-04T07:35:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	it needs to be done on boot though
2009-05-04T07:36:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	it needs to be done on boot AND be run as me though
2009-05-04T07:36:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	can that be done with autostart folder i don't know much about that
2009-05-04T07:38:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	are you talking about rc.local?
2009-05-04T07:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	somatt	that or just a .desktop file like those in your ~/config/autostart folder
2009-05-04T07:41:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	i don't understand what that means
2009-05-04T07:41:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	is it a symlink in my autostart folder? and will that make it start at boot not login
2009-05-04T07:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	somatt	it's not a symlink no, look at it as a script that is autostarted each time you login
2009-05-04T07:43:00.000Z	somatt	glitsj16	well i need it to start when i boot up not when i log in, it should be already on and started when i log in
