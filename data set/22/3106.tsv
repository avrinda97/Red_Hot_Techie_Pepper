2009-02-15T21:48:00.000Z	jhonnyboy		hey guys how can i install updates from the terminal? I have downloaded them by saying sudo apt-get updates...but i don't know how to install them manually.
2009-02-15T21:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-02-15T21:49:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	what does get upgrade and get-dist-upgrade do?
2009-02-15T21:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	upgrade makes sure the system is up to date.. dist-upgrade looks for packages that can move from and installed version to a newer version
2009-02-15T21:50:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	i also said sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-02-15T21:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	but dist-upgrade will NOT take you from say 8.04 to 8.10 .. sudo apt-get upgrade looks for packages needing upgrading.
2009-02-15T22:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	stuck at bios? or a terminal prompt?
2009-02-15T22:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	yes.. doesn't make any sense.
2009-02-15T22:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	how new is your motherboard/computer.. and do you know the chipset?  like intel?
2009-02-15T22:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	when you say bios splash screen.. what are you seeing?  typically you're either "in" the bios or not
2009-02-15T22:25:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	It's the splash screen, so what I'm trying to say is that i am not inside of the BIOS
2009-02-15T22:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	splash screen for ubuntu?
2009-02-15T22:25:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	no. The BIOS screen.
2009-02-15T22:25:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	Were it gives you the option to Enter Setup...
2009-02-15T22:26:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	the BIOS lol
2009-02-15T22:26:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	It is very weird.
2009-02-15T22:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	that's why I asked what you were actually looking at.. that's like the post screen.. do you have acpi off in the bios?
2009-02-15T22:27:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	 Would that make a difference? I can't say if i do or not i would need to restart.
2009-02-15T22:28:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	I am going to disable the ACPI option.
2009-02-15T22:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	jhonnyboy	might.. but what's really weird is once the system goes down for a reboot from the post ubuntu has nothing to do with the machine.. no control at all.
2009-02-15T22:29:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	I know :) it is weird.
2009-02-15T22:29:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	Scunizi	Let me try to disable the ACPI
