2008-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	compwiz18		What package is the ndiswrapper module in?
2008-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	Just search for ndiswrapper in Synaptic, and be sure to install ndiswrapper-common also
2008-04-28T07:08:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	I have ndiswrapper-utils-1.9 and ndiswrapper-common, but the module apparently doesn't exist...
2008-04-28T07:09:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	What do you mean the module doesn't exist? type "which ndiswrapper" and does it give the location?
2008-04-28T07:11:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	the ndiswrapper binary exists (/usr/sbin/ndiswrapper), but the module doesn't, so far as I can tell (I can't sudo modprobe ndiswrapper, because the module isn't found, apparently)
2008-04-28T07:12:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	Have you installed a driver with ndiswrapper yet? type "sudo ndiswrapper -l"
2008-04-28T07:13:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	yes - it wasn't working earlier with the Ubuntu packages, so I installed ndiswrapper from source - it still didn't work, so I uninstalled it with make uninstall, and now I can't get the module to be recognized by anything
2008-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	and I would use module-assistant to rebuild the module, but there is no ndiswrapper-source package in Hardy
2008-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	You mean you tried installing ndiswrapper with Synaptic/apt-get and it wouldn't install?
2008-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	it installs fine, it just doesn't install the module...
2008-04-28T07:16:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	I think you need to type: "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper" to add it as a module--have you done that?
2008-04-28T07:17:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	yes, FATAL: module ndiswrapper not found
2008-04-28T07:18:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	I've never had a problem with ndiswrapper like your having, so sorry, I don't think I can help you. Are you sure ndiswrapper installed correctly?
2008-04-28T07:19:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	I think so, but apparently it isn't.
2008-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	I don't think you told me, but what does "ndiswrapper -l" return?
2008-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	bcmwl5 : driver installed; device (14E4:4318) present (alternate driver: bcm43xx)
2008-04-28T07:24:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	Are you sure you need ndiswrapper? Maybe I'm totally remember wrong, but aren't BCM43* drivers supported in linux?
2008-04-28T07:24:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	they are, but they don't work well
2008-04-28T07:25:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	never mind, I got it to modprobe again :) thanks for your help though
2008-04-28T07:26:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	So what happened? The modprobe command works now?
2008-04-28T07:27:00.000Z	compwiz18	CJS3141	yeah - I downloaded the source for ndiswrapper using apt-get source ndiswrapper, rebuild the packages, installed them, cd'ed into the ndiswrapper-1.5.0 directory, and did make, make install, which is probably not the best idea I've ever had, but it works now...
2008-04-28T07:28:00.000Z	CJS3141	compwiz18	Well as long as it works... :)
