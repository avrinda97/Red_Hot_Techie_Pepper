2011-03-23T20:22:00.000Z	brophat		my lexmark printer driver worked on 32 bit ubuntu but is not working on 64 bit ubuntu
2011-03-23T20:24:00.000Z	brophat		does it make sense that a driver can work on 32 bit ubuntu but not work on 64 bit ubuntu?
2011-03-23T20:25:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	sure.
2011-03-23T20:25:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	do the drivers say if they are for 32 or 64 because i have never seen that designation
2011-03-23T20:27:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	a binary module is built against a certain architecture, just as any other executable would be. did you have a specific problem or example in mind?
2011-03-23T20:28:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	where is the list of drivers that run on 64 bit ubuntu?
2011-03-23T20:30:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	generally, drivers are built along with the kernel they augment. there is no 64-bit specific list of open source drivers, to my knowledge. the problem only comes up should you attempt to load a binary kernel module provided by a vendor.
2011-03-23T20:31:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	the lexmark printer driver worked on my 32 bit ubuntu but does not work on my 64 bit Ubuntu
2011-03-23T20:32:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	where did you get the driver from? it's a networked printer, or?
2011-03-23T20:32:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	i got the driver from the lexmark website and it is not a networked printer
2011-03-23T20:33:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	do i have to do this?  http://www.ehow.com/how_6800521_install-driver-ubuntu-64-bit.html
2011-03-23T20:33:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	go back to their website, and be sure to fetch the correct driver. or contact their support desk.
2011-03-23T20:34:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	they only have one ubuntu driver for my printer
2011-03-23T20:34:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	it's possible you only need to install the 32-bit compatibility libraries. have you done so?
2011-03-23T20:35:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	that is the link i showed you above
2011-03-23T20:35:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	have you done so?
2011-03-23T20:35:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	no
2011-03-23T20:35:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	well, now you know how to proceed.
2011-03-23T20:35:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	that link shows what i have to do?
2011-03-23T20:36:00.000Z	sipior	brophat	it looks correct, yes.
2011-03-23T20:36:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	i mean can i trust ehow? hahaha
2011-03-23T20:36:00.000Z	brophat	sipior	ok will dop
