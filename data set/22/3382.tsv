2008-09-19T21:47:00.000Z	pmann		Please help me
2008-09-19T21:48:00.000Z	pmann		we accidentally loaded ubuntu on top of windows and cannot access windows
2008-09-19T21:48:00.000Z	pmann		downloaded off internet
2008-09-19T21:48:00.000Z	pmann		said we could load alongside windows
2008-09-19T21:49:00.000Z	pmann		without creating any partition
2008-09-19T21:49:00.000Z	pmann		now the only thing that will boot is ubuntu
2008-09-19T21:49:00.000Z	pmann		no it didn't ask
2008-09-19T21:49:00.000Z	pmann		made it sound like it would just load alongside windows
2008-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	pmann		but it took over whole machine
2008-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	Pici	pmann	When you boot, do you get a menu or a prompt to press ESC to see the menu?
2008-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	pmann		yes
2008-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	pmann		cant find anyway to uninstall ubuntu
2008-09-19T21:51:00.000Z	pmann		NO chance to see menu
2008-09-19T21:51:00.000Z	pmann		boots straight to ubuntu
2008-09-19T21:52:00.000Z	Pici	pmann	Even if you install Ubuntu over everything, you should still get that prompt.
2008-09-19T21:52:00.000Z	pmann		said command not found
2008-09-19T21:53:00.000Z	pmann	Pici	 I get a countdown
2008-09-19T21:53:00.000Z	Pici	pmann	Can you press escape during that?
2008-09-19T21:53:00.000Z	pmann		but no chance to choose windows
2008-09-19T21:54:00.000Z	Pici	pmann	What is listed?
2008-09-19T21:54:00.000Z	pmann		zeus:: at desktop prompt typed: sudo fdisk-1
2008-09-19T21:54:00.000Z	Pici	pmann	and a space between the -l and fdisk
