2006-08-11T05:31:00.000Z	Blinker		but i know nothing of wine
2006-08-11T05:32:00.000Z	Blinker		the point is to ask your question, and if someone knows, they'll help ya
2006-08-11T05:32:00.000Z	Blinker		=)
2006-08-11T05:33:00.000Z	Blinker		does anyone know how to configure/mount iPods under linux?
2006-08-11T05:34:00.000Z	Blinker		yeah I read that. goes over media players
2006-08-11T05:35:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	you ought to be able to simply mount it if you just want access to the fs.
2006-08-11T05:35:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	but that won't do much good for putting on songs.
2006-08-11T05:35:00.000Z	Blinker	pstickne	thats fine. if i try to sunc now it'll wipe and i'm still gettign around to migrating my collection
2006-08-11T05:35:00.000Z	Blinker		sync*
2006-08-11T05:35:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	once it's plugged in, cat /proc/partitions and see if anything shows up
2006-08-11T05:36:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	syncing is only done via the iTunes program.
2006-08-11T05:36:00.000Z	Blinker	pstickne	banshee and amarok support it as well
2006-08-11T05:36:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	right, but it's an application-feature, not a filesystem one
2006-08-11T05:38:00.000Z	Blinker	pstickne	yeah, theres plenty that shows up. sda's, dm-0-3, and sdb's.
2006-08-11T05:38:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	one of the sd*'s will be the iPod
2006-08-11T05:38:00.000Z	Blinker		k
2006-08-11T05:39:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	then just  mount /dev/sdfoo /mnt (it should auto fine)
2006-08-11T05:39:00.000Z	pstickne	Blinker	then you have access to the fs on the iPod directly....
