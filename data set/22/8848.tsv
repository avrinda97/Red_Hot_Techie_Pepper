2006-11-23T07:34:00.000Z	Lovloss		im having a problem with "chown -R". For some reason when i run it on this folder, not all the folders inside are affected
2006-11-23T07:34:00.000Z	Lovloss		"sudo chown -R lovloss /home/lovloss/Desktop/b" should do it right?
2006-11-23T07:34:00.000Z	Lovloss		thats the command
2006-11-23T07:35:00.000Z	Lovloss		the folder is b, it sits on my desktop
2006-11-23T07:36:00.000Z	Lovloss		still says i dont have permissions
2006-11-23T07:38:00.000Z	Lovloss		isnt that bizarre rioghal ?
2006-11-23T07:39:00.000Z	Lovloss		its worked before
2006-11-23T07:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	you didn't mess around with 'chattr' did you?  try running lsattr on the files that didn't change
2006-11-23T07:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	compare the output with a 'normal' file
2006-11-23T07:40:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	for a plain file, lsattr should output all dashes
2006-11-23T07:40:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	if you see anything else there, it has special attributes
2006-11-23T07:43:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	you want permissions for who for read/write, for any user?
2006-11-23T07:43:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	o.k.   chmod 644 file.txt  makes that file read/write for you
2006-11-23T07:43:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	and readable for anyone else
2006-11-23T07:44:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	are there subdirectories or just files?
2006-11-23T07:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	o.k. you need to do this    find /path/to/b -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
2006-11-23T07:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	that fixes dirs
2006-11-23T07:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	o.k. you need to do this    find /path/to/b -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
2006-11-23T07:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	that fixes the files
2006-11-23T07:46:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	except it isn't the same effect, just note that
2006-11-23T07:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	all that babbling was that basically all the options are 'right' if you want what they produced ;-)
2006-11-23T07:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Lovloss	play with permissions just to get used to them
