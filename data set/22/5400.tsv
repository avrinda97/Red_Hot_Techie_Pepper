2010-06-30T22:12:00.000Z	usacomputertec		hello. I have a friend with a MacBook 4 and it has a mouse pad sensitivity problem just like the one described here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1417655 if she uses just the tip of her finger it won't work, She has to use her entire fingerprint in order to get it to respond. In Mac OS she could use her fingernail.
2010-06-30T22:12:00.000Z	usacomputertec		Can anyone figure out how to fix this.
2010-06-30T22:12:00.000Z	usacomputertec		I tried adjusting mouse sensitivity but that only made it faster.
2010-06-30T22:13:00.000Z	usacomputertec		I'm sure someone has had this problem on a PC touchpad too
2010-06-30T22:13:00.000Z	X3	usacomputertec	I dont
2010-06-30T22:14:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	you don't have this problem on a MacBook 4 ?
2010-06-30T22:15:00.000Z	X3	usacomputertec	I dont have that problem with any pads
2010-06-30T22:17:00.000Z	X3	usacomputertec	what he means is put that option in the grub line that says GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash
2010-06-30T22:17:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip let me make sure I get it right. It's not my PC.
2010-06-30T22:17:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip Ya I got that part just a sec guys
2010-06-30T22:18:00.000Z	X3	usacomputertec	once you add that bit actionparsnip says then save file and issue update-grub
2010-06-30T22:19:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip ok I got my grub.cfg file open
2010-06-30T22:20:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip GRUB_CMDLINE not found when I search
2010-06-30T22:21:00.000Z	X3	usacomputertec	edit this /etc/default/grub
2010-06-30T22:25:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip ya that makes sense
2010-06-30T22:27:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip so what do these options do at boot?
2010-06-30T22:29:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip so you have no idea what will happen? It seems to me the main problem is the driver being used to drive the touchpad
2010-06-30T22:29:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip I think a different driver should be used but I have no idea what one or how to change it.
2010-06-30T22:30:00.000Z	X3	usacomputertec	google is your friend
2010-06-30T22:30:00.000Z	usacomputertec	X3	ActionParsnip Ya I've been googling
