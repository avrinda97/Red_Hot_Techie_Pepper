2007-06-18T15:40:00.000Z	wlfR		how do I get the album art cover to work?
2007-06-18T15:40:00.000Z	wlfR		in rythmbox
2007-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	Edtit/Plugins/Cover art
2007-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	I can't configure it but it's "ticked"
2007-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	and it doesn't work?
2007-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	nope, and I truly don't know why
2007-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	normally it should fecth cover from amazon
2007-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	can you configure your setting with it?
2007-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	no
2007-06-18T15:47:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	so strange that it dosen't fetch then, because everything else seems to work and the CD i have in the cd slot now is Queen should be found
2007-06-18T15:48:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	I think it worked only with tagged mp3/ogg/wma
2007-06-18T15:51:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	check if the library registers correctly your files
2007-06-18T15:52:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	please explain, I'm kind of new to this system as the most of everyone else
2007-06-18T15:54:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	go to Music/Import Folder and choose your music folder, then also check Edit/Preference/Music tab and set the library to your music folder
2007-06-18T15:56:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	that's the same folder!
2007-06-18T15:57:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	so does your music files appear in the library with the correct tags?
2007-06-19T16:17:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	vill I be able to update the album art to kind of scan?
2007-06-19T16:17:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	not in Rhythmbox, amarok can do it though
2007-06-19T16:18:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	what are you using because I didn't work for me with amarok either
2007-06-19T16:19:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	well I just don't care very much about cover, since I usually not looking at it when listening ;)
2007-06-19T16:21:00.000Z	wlfR	LinAsH	that's true but it's nice when I'm gonna use it as a music station!
2007-06-19T16:22:00.000Z	LinAsH	wlfR	I think amarok automatically use the cover.jpg file inside an album folder
