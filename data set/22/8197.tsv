2006-07-06T14:31:00.000Z	markc		anyone tried this -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild ... if so, you might know what I need to use for 6868/SMP ?
2006-07-06T14:33:00.000Z	markc		ompaul> I have tried this method and the process died on me... I want to try again, now I've seen the i386 results, but for a single 686/SMP deb instead of the hour it takes to provide 20 packages that I don't need
2006-07-06T14:34:00.000Z	markc		Ribs> because I need a kernel later than 2.6.16 for a hsfmodem (that won't work with a 2.6.15 kernel)
2006-07-06T14:35:00.000Z	markc		I've got the 2.6.17-4 git repo on board, and tried the suggested method but the process died... like I say, I'd like to try again but with a more focussed invocation that just gets me a single 686/SMP kernel image
2006-07-06T14:36:00.000Z	markc		ompaul> bin thar :)  and this is a new lappie install... I only need a later kernel
2006-07-06T14:37:00.000Z	markc		lightstar> everything works except my modem...
2006-07-06T14:37:00.000Z	markc		ompaul> okay, I'll try pinning dapper and just update the kernel from edgy and see how that goes
2006-07-06T14:38:00.000Z	markc		bit af a waste of a 250mb git repo though
2006-07-06T14:38:00.000Z	markc		ompaul> thanks for your suggestions
