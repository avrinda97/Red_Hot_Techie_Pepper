2006-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	naetrick		anyone?
2006-02-18T14:04:00.000Z	naetrick		heck yes
2006-02-18T14:05:00.000Z	naetrick		Can someone tell me how to fix this problem: http://rafb.net/paste/results/AE1c5i99.html
2006-02-18T14:06:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	have you fsckup up your /etc/fstab ?
2006-02-18T14:07:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	Didn't change it...
2006-02-18T14:08:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	fstab is all good
2006-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	some udev madness?
2006-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	Didn't change anything with it...
2006-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	I'm installing a custom kernel, by the way
2006-02-18T15:19:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	stripping them reduces the size a good bit too
2006-02-18T15:19:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	That's true
2006-02-18T15:20:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	I also found that, when writing my own apps in C, that tuning them for my specific processor makes them even slower
2006-02-18T15:21:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	-ffastmath is good for floating point code speed, I found
2006-02-18T15:21:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	Yup, and -funroll-loops, too. That can give a nice gain, but it'll increase binary size
2006-02-18T15:25:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	that's disappointing ;) what gives you that?
2006-02-18T15:26:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	When I boot
2006-02-18T15:33:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	not on a pc
2006-02-18T15:34:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	heh
2006-02-19T14:43:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	quite possibly
2006-02-19T14:44:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	ide chipset support? dma support?
2006-02-19T14:45:00.000Z	naetrick	amphi	That's it, just found it :)
2006-02-19T14:45:00.000Z	amphi	naetrick	build ide chipset support monolithically ;)
