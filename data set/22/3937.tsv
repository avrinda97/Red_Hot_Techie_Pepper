2008-04-27T22:44:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	Also, what sound card are you running?
2008-04-27T22:44:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	, Mute, is when there are 'MM' instead of a green horizontal '8'  right ?
2008-04-27T22:45:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	and when i tried it with onboard sound, i have system sound, but nothing else -wich is weird- since everything , drivers, ect, are pointing to use the sound card (wich always worked since hoary)
2008-04-27T22:45:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	What sound card?
2008-04-27T22:46:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	Creative Soundblaster 32   emu10k1
2008-04-27T22:48:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	If you open volume control and go to File -> Change device what device is listed in slot 0?

2008-04-27T22:52:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	I'm finding posts saying the VIA chipset has some problems

2008-04-27T22:52:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	... :/
2008-04-27T22:54:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	Wish I could be of more help, but there might be some fundamental driver issue going on
2008-04-27T22:54:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	File a bug report
2008-04-27T22:55:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	, any names of cheap Working in Hardy soundcards ? ;)
2008-04-27T22:55:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	Heh, the older the better in general. I'm not totally certain about specific cards, sorry
2008-04-27T22:56:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	also, when i first upgraded from gutsy to Hardy, i had sound whitout problem... but because of a few bugs i reinstalled completely, then i lost sound.
2008-04-27T22:56:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	I bought my sound card in 2001 ;)
2008-04-27T22:57:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	Hmmm, interesting. It should work then. You could wipe your install and put Gutsy back on. Then install Hardy in another partition. Compare packages to find the differences and you should be able to narrow down the problem
2008-04-27T22:58:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	well, to say... in Gutsy, i lost sound randomly on 1/3 boot.  i was hopping Hardy would fix that... (..)
2008-04-27T22:58:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	There must be something else going on if it worked in Gutsy
2008-04-27T22:59:00.000Z	akincer	B166erx	Ahh, that tells me there are lingering bugs in the driver. Submit a bug report and find a card that works. Got any old PCs you can canibalize?
2008-04-27T22:59:00.000Z	B166erx	akincer	nah, i've stopped piling them up. but i'll check it out, thankx for the help
