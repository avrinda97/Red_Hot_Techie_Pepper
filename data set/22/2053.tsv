2009-10-13T19:53:00.000Z	jph_		Anyone Know about RAIDs here? The difference between hardware and software RAID and the pros and cons of each?
2009-10-13T19:53:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	what do you want to know?
2009-10-13T19:53:00.000Z	jph_		RAID 1 Question - I have a Supermicro motherboard that has 4 SATA connections; Can I have 2 RAID 1 setups on that? i.e. Can I take 2 100g HDs and set them up in a RAID 1 for my Ubuntu Server OS and then later take 2 1Tb HDs and set them up in a RAID 1 for my mass storage drive and then mount them within the system
2009-10-13T19:54:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	if the raid controller allows you to have more than 1 volume (most do), then yes.
2009-10-13T19:54:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	however, you need to make sure that your raid card is supported.
2009-10-13T19:54:00.000Z	jph_		would that be a hardware or software RAID
2009-10-13T19:55:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	most on-motherboard raid controllers are pseudo-software raid.  pure hardware raid is expensive.
2009-10-13T19:55:00.000Z	jph_		those SATA ports are on on-board if that matters... how do i go about seeing if it is supported
2009-10-13T19:56:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	well, do you know the model of your motherboard?
2009-10-13T19:56:00.000Z	jph_		I will be back in 60sec with that in info thanks for the help
2009-10-13T19:58:00.000Z	jph_		Ok I think it is the SuperMicro 'Super X5DAL-TG2'
2009-10-13T20:02:00.000Z	jph_	the_hoser	It is the 'Super X5DAL-TG2'
2009-10-13T20:05:00.000Z	jph_	the_hoser	you there?
2009-10-13T20:07:00.000Z	jph_	the_hoser	you there?
2009-10-13T20:07:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	yeah.  did you find the model?
2009-10-13T20:08:00.000Z	jph_	the_hoser	It is the 'Super X5DAL-TG2'
2009-10-13T20:09:00.000Z	jph_		By SuperMicro
2009-10-13T20:10:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	mmkay.  you have linux supported fakeraid.  I'd honestly go with software raid.  It's less buggy.  Unless you have a *real* raid controller, software raid is almost always better.
2009-10-13T20:12:00.000Z	jph_	the_hoser	 Ok so i should go with a software RAID and there shouldn't be a problem having 2 separate RAIDs
2009-10-13T20:12:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	correct
2009-10-13T20:12:00.000Z	jph_		great, thank you so much for your time
2009-10-13T20:13:00.000Z	the_hoser	jph_	np
