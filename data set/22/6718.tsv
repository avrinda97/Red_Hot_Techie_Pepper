2008-03-21T23:15:00.000Z	RichW	sam_	Try making sure libgl is installed?
2008-03-21T23:15:00.000Z	sam_	RichW	it is installed
2008-03-21T23:15:00.000Z	RichW	sam_	sdl? Are you on 32bit ubuntu?
2008-03-21T23:15:00.000Z	sam_	RichW	i have played other OpenGL games
2008-03-21T23:15:00.000Z	sam_	RichW	I am on 64-bit
2008-03-21T23:16:00.000Z	RichW	sam_	Switch to 32bit
2008-03-21T23:16:00.000Z	sam_	RichW	64-bit recognized all 4GB of my RAM and everything i have tried seems to work well on it
2008-03-21T23:16:00.000Z	RichW	sam_	64bit isnt worth it trust me.
2008-03-21T23:16:00.000Z	sam_	RichW	ya but 32-bit limits my system
2008-03-21T23:17:00.000Z	RichW	sam_	yes alot of stuff works, and I think 32bit reads all the ram from what ive seen.. its not like windows.
2008-03-21T23:17:00.000Z	sam_	RichW	i checked online and it said the limitations are on all 32-bit operating systems
2008-03-21T23:21:00.000Z	RichW	sam_	You can download a 32bit ubuntu live cd and boot from it.. see if it works.. it wont affect your 64bit installation.
