2005-12-21T17:57:00.000Z	k31th		anyone think of any good ways to backup mass amounts of data ?
2005-12-21T06:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	How much?
2005-12-21T06:00:00.000Z	k31th	tonyyarusso	lots :D 500 gigs ?
2005-12-21T06:01:00.000Z	k31th		i need to get 50 gigs backed up as well and its to much data for a 40/80 tape i was thinking rsync ?
2005-12-21T06:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	Oh boy.
2005-12-21T06:01:00.000Z	k31th	tonyyarusso	 ??
2005-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	Dual-layered DVDs?  (If you have a burner.)
2005-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	k31th		thats wat 8 or 9 gigs
2005-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	Each, yeah.  You'd need a lot still.
2005-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	k31th		dvds are not really accepted as a way of backing up
2005-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	How big do external hard drives come?
2005-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	k31th		as big as internal
2005-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	Which is?
2005-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	k31th		but a hard drive is not a very good way of backing up either :D
2005-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	k31th		300 gigs or more
2005-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	k31th		thinking about just rsync'ing a couple of boxes off site and onsitte
2005-12-21T06:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	All right then, print off everything that's a document, and see how much is left.  That out to be a fool-proof backup.
2005-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	k31th	tonyyarusso	 wat ?
2005-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	Honestly, if none of those options are going to work for your purposes, I really don't know.
2005-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	k31th		there all cad drawings
2005-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	Ah.
2005-12-21T06:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	k31th	So if those aren't considered good ways of backing up, you must have gotten that opinion from somewhere, so what does your source suggest?
