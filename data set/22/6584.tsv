2007-05-08T10:36:00.000Z	wizard_	C	might i make a suggestion to you?
2007-05-08T10:38:00.000Z	wizard_	C	in the linux world... no ones opinion but your own matters on whats best. You've entered a gateway to liberal software, freedom of customization, and a world of amazement. You are your own leader in a game of constructing a system around who you are. Don't ask people whats best, as we'll all see differently. Instead, play, experiment, and grow... Make linux work for YOU, not you work for it! Enjoy it, experiment, and learn to love it.
2007-05-08T10:40:00.000Z	wizard_	C	try them all! find what works best for you
2007-05-08T10:41:00.000Z	wizard_	C	ohh no, im not saying don't ask.. just ask whats out there, but don't listen to someone who tells you whats "Best"
2007-05-08T10:42:00.000Z	wizard_	C	xmms was my favorite for a while too
2007-05-08T10:42:00.000Z	wizard_	C	fresh out of windows you'll want familiarity... then you'll grow into your own and change to better and bigger things.
