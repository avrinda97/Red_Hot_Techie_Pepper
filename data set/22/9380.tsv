2004-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	CraHan		has anyone experienced a serious slowdown on nautilus in the hoary version?
2004-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	CraHan		opening a folder takes like 10 seconds and more
2004-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	CraHan		dang
2004-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll	CraHan	mine's good
2004-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	CraHan		I already created a new user to check if it might a setting, but it had no effect
2004-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	CraHan		strange
2004-11-23T14:38:00.000Z	CraHan		found why nautilus is so slow at opening folders
2004-11-23T14:39:00.000Z	CraHan		gamin wasn't installed
2004-11-23T14:39:00.000Z	CraHan		which provides gam_server
2004-11-23T14:39:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll		ah
2004-11-23T14:39:00.000Z	CraHan		my question now is: why isn't nautilus dependent on gamin?
2004-11-23T14:39:00.000Z	CraHan		shouldn't the nautilis package have a dependency to the gamin package?
2004-11-23T14:42:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll	CraHan	there's no good reason
2004-11-23T14:42:00.000Z	CraHan	LifesizeKenDoll	well installing gamin made nautilus react again
2004-11-23T14:42:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll	CraHan	yea, I know, there's no good reason why not to make it a dependency
2004-11-23T14:42:00.000Z	CraHan		aah ic :)
2004-11-23T14:43:00.000Z	CraHan		should I file a bugreport ?
2004-11-23T14:43:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll	CraHan	really, fam should be a dependency, gamin is just a replacement
2004-11-23T14:43:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll	CraHan	I say yes
2004-11-23T14:43:00.000Z	CraHan		ok... doing that now
2004-11-23T14:45:00.000Z	CraHan		done
2004-11-23T14:46:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll	CraHan	yay!
