2006-12-19T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	nuxil	rar is only available in i386 repos
2006-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	nuxil	Flannel	is ther a way to make it install in a jailed env ?
2006-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	Flannel	nuxil	yeah, you'll have to set up a 32bit chroot or whatever.  As to how that's done... I'm clueless.
2006-12-19T06:13:00.000Z	Flannel	nuxil	that might be of some assistance
