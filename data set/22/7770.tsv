2005-12-31T07:45:00.000Z	xstasi		hi all
2005-12-31T07:45:00.000Z	xstasi		i couldn't find info on the doc about the ubuntu branches
2005-12-31T07:45:00.000Z	xstasi		i would like to put on an "unstable" ubuntu
2005-12-31T07:45:00.000Z	xstasi		i need a >2.6.14 for hw matters
2005-12-31T07:46:00.000Z	xstasi		(only >2.6.14 support my modem)
2005-12-31T07:46:00.000Z	xstasi		i had to install ubuntu breezy, then reboot with another OS, download the kernel package, and then install it from ubuntu
2005-12-31T07:47:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	consider compiling the kernel rahter than installing unstable Ubuntu, cause if you do not know how to even upgrade, you are likely to be in a wolrd of pain if you upgrade to unstable.
2005-12-31T07:47:00.000Z	xstasi	dabaR	i use debian since 2001
2005-12-31T07:48:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	so, then what do you want from us, what is your question?
2005-12-31T07:48:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	ok, dapper is instead of breezy. good luck.
2005-12-31T07:49:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	about what?
2005-12-31T07:51:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	visit wiki.ubuntu.com and check out the bottom of the page.
2005-12-31T07:53:00.000Z	xstasi	dabaR	ok, and now why aren't there any upgrades?
2005-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	can you be more specific, I do not understand your question. One good rule of thumb is to notice the person asking the question typing more than the one answering.
2005-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	xstasi	dabaR	sorry... i tought i was explaining myself better
2005-12-31T07:55:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	to upgrade an Ubuntu installation, change /etc/apt/sources.list, change the word "$MYVERSION" to "$NEWERVERSION"
2005-12-31T07:56:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	in Ubuntu, the sources.list file contains like, breezy, dapper, warty, hoary, and so on.
2005-12-31T07:56:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	did you update?
2005-12-31T08:03:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	we suck, actually, we are not good.
2005-12-31T08:03:00.000Z	xstasi	dabaR	at leas you keep a *good* company ;)
2005-12-31T08:13:00.000Z	dabaR	xstasi	you just have main and restricted enabled, ad "universe" "multiverse" at the end of those two lines in sources.list. also, you will need the security updates entry, and updates entry.
2005-12-31T08:13:00.000Z	xstasi	dabaR	i only have main and security
