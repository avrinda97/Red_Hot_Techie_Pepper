2009-01-16T00:38:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Jack_Sparrow: It's just old-releaeses.ubuntu.com, no archive.
2009-01-16T00:41:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Right.  That's correct.
2009-01-16T00:55:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Just upgrade through the repos like a few people have mentiooned.
2009-01-16T01:03:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Change your sources to old-releases (I believe you already have) and then follow the instructions on this page to upgrade to 7.10
2009-01-16T01:04:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Correct.  You have successfully modified your sources.list
2009-01-16T01:07:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Follow the instructions here to upgrade: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades
2009-01-16T01:10:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Do you have any files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/?
2009-01-16T01:11:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Delete all of the files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2009-01-16T01:13:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Alright, so: now that there's *nothing* in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/  please pastebin your sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list) again.
2009-01-16T01:13:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	That topic isn't really appropriate for this channel.
2009-01-16T01:15:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Right.  That's not the same as the previous file you showed us.  Alright, open that file for writing (gksu "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list") and paste in the following:
2009-01-16T01:15:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	http://paste.ubuntu.com/105305/
2009-01-16T01:18:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Please follow instructions.
2009-01-16T01:22:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	Right.  Now follow the rest of those instructions to upgrade.
2009-01-16T01:25:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	No.  You need to follow the instructions on the upgrade page.
2009-01-25T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	kubuntu-desktop not kde
2009-01-25T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	a931bw	You'd be better off with kubuntu-desktop instead of kde
