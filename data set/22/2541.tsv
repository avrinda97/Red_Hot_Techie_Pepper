2009-06-12T12:37:00.000Z	l0nwlf_		my benq external 22'  monitor is not recognised properly by ubuntu, it's giving me 1600X900 while its capability is 1900*1080
2009-06-12T12:38:00.000Z	l0nwlf_		i tried fedora11 yesterday and it recognised the monitor properly, what should i do ?

2009-06-12T12:42:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	does the latest fedora use a new xorg? The pastebin shows xorg is seeing 1600 as you said
2009-06-12T12:44:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	with fedora10 i used to get same 1600:900 just like ubuntu however i have no idea why fedora11 recognised my complete resolution :( , the model of monitor is benq 2220 HD
2009-06-12T12:47:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	seems fedora 11 must have a newer version of x11. Looking into it. You might get a ppa build for Intrepid
2009-06-12T12:49:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	pardon me for my ignorance but i didn't understood the concept , what exactly is ppa ?
2009-06-12T12:51:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	repository for very new software versions
2009-06-12T12:53:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	bazhang: ubottu: thanks
2009-06-12T12:56:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	are you able to download and try the karmic alpha? Using a pre-release version of xorg is possibly not a good idea. I think either use karmic or fedora :/
2009-06-12T12:59:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	there is a comparison http://lxer.com/module/newswire/ext_link.php?rid=121790
2009-06-12T13:01:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	will trying carmic alpha will be good ?
2009-06-12T13:01:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	I havn't tried it.
2009-06-12T13:20:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	4096 x 4096?? that cant be right?
2009-06-12T13:21:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	i was expecting it gives me 1900X1080 but since it was maximum so i thought maybe ,..however it seems odd
2009-06-12T13:21:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	you can use xrandr -s to set the resolution
2009-06-12T13:21:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	check man xrandr
2009-06-12T13:22:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	checking it (however i was used to the OS taking my resolution by default)
2009-06-12T13:33:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	xrand -s 1.5 sets resolution to 1024X768, xrand -s 2 sets it to 832X624 and xrand -s 0.5 hav no effect at all ..the resolution remains as 1280X800
2009-06-12T13:34:00.000Z	richj	l0nwlf_	xrandr -s 1600x1700
2009-06-12T13:35:00.000Z	l0nwlf_	richj	: 'Size 1600x1700 not found in available modes
