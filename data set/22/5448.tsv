2010-06-11T04:32:00.000Z	willwork4foo		OK, this is now screwed. Somehow, installing the Nvidia Driver has killed my install and I can't get it back.
2010-06-11T04:32:00.000Z	willwork4foo		I can't boot into ANYTHING.
2010-06-11T04:32:00.000Z	willwork4foo		it gets as far as "Checking Battery State"
2010-06-11T04:32:00.000Z	willwork4foo		then it freezes.
2010-06-11T04:33:00.000Z	willwork4foo		I can get to the grub menu, and edit my boot parameters.... but I can't work out how to get the thing up to a usable level
2010-06-11T04:34:00.000Z	willwork4foo		can anyone help me out here - this is really starting to drive me mad
2010-06-11T04:34:00.000Z	willwork4foo		:(
2010-06-11T04:35:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	a "usable level" meaning..?
2010-06-11T04:36:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Gnea	at the risk of sounding rude... a level that I can USE THE SYSTEM
2010-06-11T04:37:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	lol, not rude, but a bit 'generic' :) have you tried removing the battery?
2010-06-11T04:37:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Gnea	it's not got a battery.
2010-06-11T04:37:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	is it a netbook?
2010-06-11T04:37:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Gnea	no, a net-top
2010-06-11T04:38:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	okay - did the the problem start after you copied the kernel and initrd over?
2010-06-11T04:39:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Gnea	No. It booted fine, and worked fine, until I agreed to install the NVIDIA proprietary drivers. Since then, it's refused to boot.
2010-06-11T04:39:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	have you tried without the 'quiet splash' options?
2010-06-11T04:40:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Gnea	yes, that's where it tells me it's got as far as "Checking Battery State" (there isn't a battery, this is a desktop) and it freezes.
2010-06-11T04:40:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Gnea	this was working just fine before I installed this ^&&$^%%$ driver.
2010-06-11T04:40:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	all desktops have a battery in them to keep the state of the cmos in check. otherwise, the time/date would never be current.
2010-06-11T04:41:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Gnea	OK fair enough.... regardless, I don't think this is a hardware issue.
2010-06-11T04:41:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	what if you try "init=/bin/bash" instead of "single"?
2010-06-11T04:42:00.000Z	Gnea	willwork4foo	soreau has a good method
