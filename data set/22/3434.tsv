2008-12-18T04:31:00.000Z	Spherous		Okay, I went to dual boot windows and ubuntu, I have ubuntu installed, but the windows install disc can't figure out my drive type, so it can't partition part off.  How do I go about doing that manually as a NTFS drive so I can install windows on it?
2008-12-18T04:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	if you just installed ubuntu you might consider starting over and install windows first then ubuntu.. it will go much smoother. Windows likes to be first on a dual boot system.
2008-12-18T04:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	if you're not going to be playing games on the windows side, consider installing windows in a Virtual Machine like Virtual Box. It will then run "inside" of Ubuntu
2008-12-18T04:33:00.000Z	Spherous		scunizi, I've had ubuntu installed for a good 3 months, starting over is not an option. I do not want to lose my data, any other way? I mean, I know I can run Virtual Box or VMWare, but I would prefer a dual boot
2008-12-18T04:33:00.000Z	Spherous		scunizi, I do plan to be playing games~
2008-12-18T04:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	sure.. use gparted to make space ... unpartitioned space for windows.. it will discover it.. after install you'll have to fix grub because you won't be able to boot into ubuntu.. windows overwrites the MBR
2008-12-18T04:35:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	Okay, using gparted to make space wont be hard. What do you mean I'll have to fix grub?
2008-12-18T04:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	since windows will overwrite the Master Boot Record the grub menu won't show up to boot into ubutnu. You'll have to use the Live CD to fix grub and rewrite the MBR.
2008-12-18T04:36:00.000Z	Scunizi		!grub | Spherous
2008-12-18T04:37:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	Thanks :D
2008-12-18T04:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	np
2008-12-18T04:42:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	Odd, gparted won't let me resize and add unpartitioned space
2008-12-18T04:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	what file system are you using?
2008-12-18T04:42:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	I can turn my Swap off, then mess with that, but I don't feel safe messing with swap lol
2008-12-18T04:43:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	What do you mean what filesystem am I using?
2008-12-18T04:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	swap probably isn't large enough for windows anyway.. another solution is to drop another drive into the machine
2008-12-18T04:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	the type of file system ext3, reiserFS or whatever might not like to be resized.
2008-12-18T04:44:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	I have spare drives, but shitty IDE ones that wont suffice with my SATA pc lol
2008-12-18T04:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	they will work though..
2008-12-18T04:44:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	So, why won't it let me create new unpartitioned space?
2008-12-18T04:44:00.000Z	Spherous	Scunizi	nah, no IDE cables lol
2008-12-18T04:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	Spherous	I have no idea.. maybe someone else will answer that one.. wish you were close, I've got bunches of cables.  check with your local geek. They probably have one for you for nothing.
