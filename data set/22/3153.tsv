2008-11-27T05:47:00.000Z	benguin		i was wondering, is there a suite of benchmark tools to test the performance of my linux system>
2008-11-27T05:47:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	unreal tournament 2003, 2004, etc.
2008-11-27T05:48:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	doom3, quake4...
2008-11-27T05:48:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	are these benchmark tools freely available?
2008-11-27T05:48:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	welll you can get demos -_-'
2008-11-27T05:48:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	okay. never ran them as benchmarks though.
2008-11-27T05:49:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	quake can run recorded demos
2008-11-27T05:49:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	useful for testing =)
2008-11-27T05:50:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	okay. thanks. do these tools give quantitative results in any form? like, cpu and gpu performance, i/o bottlenecks etc etc?
2008-11-27T05:50:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	not at all, i didn't expect you to take me serious -_-''
2008-11-27T05:51:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	there are unreal tournament benchmarks that i have seen published online
2008-11-27T05:51:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	thats kewl
2008-11-27T05:51:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	so you did have a serious answer :)

2008-11-27T05:51:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	thanks for the info, though, these are not what im looking at
2008-11-27T05:52:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	bonnie++ can test filesystem performance
2008-11-27T05:52:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	yafray and povray can test your cpu
2008-11-27T05:52:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	im looking more at CPU and memory performance
2008-11-27T05:52:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	ill look into those then
2008-11-27T05:52:00.000Z	snuitje	benguin	encrypting stuff with gpg can also be a benchmark
2008-11-27T05:54:00.000Z	benguin	snuitje	looking into povray benchmarking now
