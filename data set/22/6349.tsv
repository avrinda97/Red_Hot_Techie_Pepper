2007-12-24T05:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	What do you mean "like default x-window" ?
2007-12-24T05:50:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	yes
2007-12-24T05:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	Do you just want it to be the default window manager?
2007-12-24T05:50:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	yes
2007-12-24T05:51:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	to be possible started with startx command... understand?
2007-12-24T05:52:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	when i type startx here, gnome is loaded, and i has installed the fluxbox, is very small.. and i want if possible, change startx to start fluxbox
2007-12-24T05:53:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	its possible?
2007-12-24T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	Yes
2007-12-24T05:53:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	how can i do this?
2007-12-24T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	I don't remember exactly, you might try reading "man startx" or check wiki.ubuntu.com
2010-08-04T04:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo dd if=/dev/sdX count=1 | od" where sdX is your flash drive.
2010-08-04T04:37:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	I got told to do: dd if=/your/image of=/whole/usb/device
2010-08-04T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	That will destroy all data currently on the flash drive.
2010-08-04T04:37:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	dosn't matter.
2010-08-04T04:37:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	I have a backup :-)
2010-08-04T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	It also won't work with most iso files.
2010-08-04T04:38:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	OH.. ok.
2010-08-04T04:41:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/8Kp2jexa
2010-08-04T04:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sander	Ok, that's clearly wrong for a bootable drive.
2010-08-04T04:42:00.000Z	sander	Jordan_U	thats after I did the abow dd command.
