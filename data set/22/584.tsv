2012-01-24T07:02:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	:)  tyvm.  noob moment
2012-02-01T00:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	but during install, it will download a lot more
2012-02-01T00:46:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	true.  if portable, i'd say it's time to go buy a cup of coffee, siphon some wifi and getrdone
2012-02-01T01:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	that is a very misleading title to that blog/article ;)
2012-02-01T01:31:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	MrKeuner: I would'nt delete ALL the kernels.  Keep @ least one "old" one in reserve.
2012-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	i've certainly never tried it, but there is a pidgin-skype plugin
2012-02-04T08:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	i wouldn't personally consider that sad, what about jabber.org?
2012-02-04T08:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	oh ya, voice, jabber not really an option then
2012-02-04T11:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	Stallworth?  is that a combination of Stallman and Shuttleworth?  I don't think they'd get along.
2012-02-04T11:55:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	- still trying to distinguish between ubuntuTV and myth
2012-02-04T11:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	ubuntutv is a canonical hardware project, while mythtv is a software suite
2012-02-04T11:56:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	- got it.  thanks.
2012-02-04T12:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	the "late" ubuntu
2012-02-04T12:15:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	- that's not late, that's mummified
2012-02-04T12:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	it was late, by two months, thus the .06 versus the scheduled .04
2012-02-04T12:16:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	- I stand corrected.
2012-02-05T11:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	intel P3 i'd guess ;)
2012-02-05T11:28:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	LOL.  Right
2012-02-05T11:29:00.000Z	acerimmer	zykotick9	can ubuntu upgrade to a different DE?  e.g. 8.04 to xubuntu 10.04??
2012-02-05T11:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	acerimmer	i'd GUESS no, but you could just install it after
