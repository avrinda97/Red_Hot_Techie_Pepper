2006-02-22T14:52:00.000Z	adam_		hi can anyone help me getting gcc to work, is it pre installed or do i need to get it myself?
2006-02-22T14:53:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	you need to install the build-essential package
2006-02-22T14:54:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	I don't know if it is there, it is definitely in synaptic though
2006-03-20T06:21:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	Thank you, I'll look into that :)
2006-03-20T06:21:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	pastebin the errors you got and your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-03-20T06:22:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	(I just noticed that those are the doko debs)
2006-03-20T06:22:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	"(add one of the 'deb' lines to sources.list and update+upgrade)"
2006-03-20T06:22:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	what does it mean by this?
2006-03-20T06:23:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	I figure I have to write something to sources.list, but as to what I should be writing.. that I'm not sure :/
2006-03-20T06:23:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	what architecture do you use?
2006-03-20T06:23:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	i386
2006-03-20T06:24:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	then you just add the line ``deb http://people.ubuntu.com/~doko/OOo2 ./'' and then run 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade'
2006-03-20T06:25:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	I already downloaded the OOo2 packages (and I'm on dialup, so I'd rather not download them again); where can I put them so that ubuntu will read them instead of redownloading?
2006-03-20T06:30:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	ah, ubotu knows everything :)
2006-03-20T16:10:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	it's in accessories now
2006-03-20T16:10:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	oh, haha
2006-03-20T16:10:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	thanks
2006-03-20T16:11:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	and the root terminal? (For some strange reason I can't 'su' into root)
2006-03-20T16:11:00.000Z	adam_	_jason	ah, just did sudo su, and it worked
2006-03-20T16:12:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	no don't do that, do 'sudo -i' instead
2006-04-01T08:36:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	hi, just ask
2006-04-01T08:39:00.000Z	_jason	adam_	have you tried reinstalling the libgtk1.2 package?
