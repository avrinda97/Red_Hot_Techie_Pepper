2005-12-28T16:19:00.000Z	Sh4d0x		terrasque, can you tell me exactly what i have to do?
2005-12-28T16:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Sh4d0x	applications->system->config editor, then navigate to desktop/gnome/interface , you can change the themes there
2005-12-28T16:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Sh4d0x	seriously, the simple fix is as I mentioned above. change gtk_theme to Human
2005-12-28T16:23:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	nickrud	but there are a lot of folders in "gnome"
2005-12-28T16:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Sh4d0x	no, you go, from the top menu bar: applications->system->config editor. Then, inside that app, navigate to desktop/interface. Edit in the right pane, gtk_theme to Human.

2005-12-28T16:34:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	nickrud	how do i get rid of the "stupid" installed themes, especially the "broken" ones or the ones that crashes my theme manager?
2005-12-28T16:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Sh4d0x	the themes you installed are in ~/.themes, you can simply delete their folders

2005-12-28T16:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Sh4d0x	any downloaded icon themes will be in ~/.icons
