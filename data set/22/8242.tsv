2011-09-24T18:35:00.000Z	Tnud		I see that
2011-09-24T18:36:00.000Z	Tnud		ipconfig
2011-09-24T18:36:00.000Z	Tnud		sorry, wrong keyboard.. checking now
2011-09-24T18:37:00.000Z	Tnud		No, I have an eth0. I assume that is a working ethernet hardware
2011-09-24T18:38:00.000Z	Tnud		Might be my routher then.. hmmmm
2011-09-24T18:40:00.000Z	Tnud		lol
2011-09-24T18:40:00.000Z	Tnud		that worked
2011-09-24T18:40:00.000Z	Tnud		DO I have to do that everytime I boot it up?
2011-09-24T18:41:00.000Z	Tnud		I don't see a wired connection in the manager tho, just the auto echo
2011-09-24T18:43:00.000Z	Tnud		apt-get update
2011-09-24T18:44:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get  upgrade
2011-09-24T18:35:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	YOu should see a little triangle looking thing at top.  It's just an outline and top is rounded.
2011-09-24T18:35:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	Otherwise, open a terminal and type ifconfig  and hit enter. If you only see section for lo  then yea, your NIC is not in use.
2011-09-24T18:36:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	If you click on that little image, you should see your network settings.
2011-09-24T18:39:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	Did you tell it to connect to a wired network?
2011-09-24T18:39:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	You can try (at terminal):  sudo dhclient eth0
2011-09-24T18:40:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	Yes, you have to tell it to connect, won't just do it on it's on, not the first time anyway.
2011-09-24T18:41:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	If you do it via the network-manager, it will "remember"
2011-09-24T18:42:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	Well, I don't know why the network-manager is not showing the available wired network.  But, you should do updates now.
2011-09-24T18:42:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	run update-manager
2011-09-24T18:43:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	Yes, and then apt-get upgrade
2011-09-24T18:47:00.000Z	usr13	Tnud	Add line:  dhclient eth0   to /etc/rc.local  (above exit 0 )
