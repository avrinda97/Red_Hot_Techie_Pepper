2012-08-31T06:29:00.000Z	histo	lidar	what kind of aircard is it?
2012-08-31T06:29:00.000Z	lidar	histo	usb551L from verizon
2012-08-31T06:30:00.000Z	histo	lidar	have you just tried using network manager and configure the device?
2012-08-31T06:31:00.000Z	lidar	histo	yeah it sees it as a wired network card
2012-08-31T06:32:00.000Z	histo	lidar	okay vzaccessmanager is needed to trigger the link with that modem I guess. If check out vzam.net they have it there in the enterprise section. VZW techsupport should be able to give you credentials to get to the download.
2012-08-31T06:32:00.000Z	lidar	histo	it just disconnects every 5 seconds or so tried all the settings i could find ect. ect. there is a new driver out for win7 however ndiswrapper wont work with it
2012-08-31T06:33:00.000Z	lidar	histo	i never called i guess it may be worthwhile
2012-08-31T06:33:00.000Z	histo	lidar	yeah I would always try but you may have to go through several people to get someone that knows what linux actually is
2012-08-31T06:34:00.000Z	lidar	histo	i would still have to dual boot due to some specialized software i need for work however if the aircard worked i could use linux 90% of the time instead like 20% i am now
2012-08-31T06:34:00.000Z	histo	lidar	also found this http://johnmeister.com/old-cs/LINUX/v620-SUSE/VZAccessManagerLinuxInstallationGuide.pdf
2012-08-31T06:35:00.000Z	histo	lidar	that device on verizons page shows support for linux so i'm not sure why VZW is blocking everyone but corpo users from the info.
2012-08-31T06:35:00.000Z	lidar	histo	yeah its out there somewhere!
2012-08-31T06:36:00.000Z	histo	lidar	the other option is a cell modem router that you plug that device into and share it's connection.
2012-08-31T06:37:00.000Z	lidar	histo	yeah i was gonna stop at vz store and see if there is one that would use my sim card
2012-08-31T06:38:00.000Z	lidar	histo	they are about 250 to buy them out right then i could connect laptop ipod ect. ect. would be nice
2012-08-31T06:53:00.000Z	lidar	histo	im on hold while the guy trys to figure out what linux is
2012-08-31T06:58:00.000Z	histo	lidar	lol
2012-08-31T07:07:00.000Z	lidar	histo	im on 3rd person
2012-08-31T07:10:00.000Z	histo	lidar	Like I said good luck getting someone that understands. Those tech support people just read from books and give canned responses. It takes awhile to get a person that knows what they are doing.
2012-08-31T07:11:00.000Z	lidar	histo	we are to the point now they cant allow mer to download because its paasworded behind enterprise login
2012-08-31T07:20:00.000Z	lidar	histo	made it to a supervisor .. they can only allow access authorized corporate account people ie the ones that can login lol
2012-09-02T03:50:00.000Z	lidar	histo	will you tell me what to type so i can use my computer in a special way :D
