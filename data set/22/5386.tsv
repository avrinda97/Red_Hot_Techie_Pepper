2007-05-17T13:00:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm		can anyone help me find why i get a freeze at the login screen?
2007-05-17T13:01:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm		can someone tell me how to set ubuntu so that it doesn't start x on boot
2007-05-17T13:02:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	system > administration > services, disable the graphical login
2007-05-17T13:02:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	thatks
2007-05-17T13:02:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	damn, that would be great except i am running as root in single user mode right now
2007-05-17T13:03:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	and it won't let me open the program
2007-05-17T13:04:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	well you can use sysv-rc-conf (you probably need to install it)
2007-05-17T13:05:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	ok
2007-05-17T13:09:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	what am i looking for in sysv-rc-conf? i'm quite new to linux and i don't know what much of this means
2007-05-17T13:10:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	are you sure you don't want X if you are new?
2007-05-17T13:10:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	you want to stop gdm from starting
2007-05-17T13:10:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	it's crashing at the login screen so i want to login on the console before starting x
2007-05-17T13:11:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	you can't just press ctrl-alt-f1?
2007-05-17T13:11:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	or possibly gdm, yes
2007-05-17T13:11:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	no, it totally freezes and that doesn't work
2007-05-17T13:11:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	I see
2007-05-17T13:15:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	so in sysv-rc-conf, what do the columns mean? in which one should I turn off gdm?
2007-05-17T13:15:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	all of them, but you normalling boot into 2 so that's the only one you /really/ need to turn off
2007-05-17T13:15:00.000Z	jrib	iMacThere4iAm	each column is a runlevel
2007-05-17T13:15:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	okay
2007-05-17T13:19:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	thanks for the help, i'm going to reboot and see
2007-05-17T13:31:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	jrib	that didn't really help, now i just get the dump from the kernel panic instead of a boring freeze
