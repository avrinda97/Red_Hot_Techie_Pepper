2011-01-12T00:48:00.000Z	sniperjo_		i have a monitor that says: not supported when i get past grub, is there a way i can ssh into it and fix it ?
2011-01-12T00:50:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	That message itself is not a problem. It only means that grub is not able to adjust the bootscreen. The X-server on the other hand may (should) start withlut problem.
2011-01-12T00:53:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	 its the other way around, grub supplies a supported resolution, Xserver doesnt
2011-01-12T00:55:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	what graphics card do use? what output? VGA, DVI, HDMI?
2011-01-12T00:56:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	its Intel interrogated which outputs DVI, that then goes through a DVI VGA converter
2011-01-12T00:56:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	hmmm... That shouldn't be the problem. What resolution does the monitor have?
2011-01-12T00:57:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	 800x600
2011-01-12T00:58:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	Rather old hardware? what's the outpu of 'lspci | grep VGA' in a console?
2011-01-12T00:59:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	as i side note i always have trouble sleeping and waking it
2011-01-12T01:02:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	ok. I read that you don't have problems with other monitors. You could try to create a new xorg.conf and modify it to use the simple VGA driver instead of the intel GPU driver. THat may help...

2011-01-12T01:02:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	i need the intel driver for the video acceleration, otherwise i would be happy to
2011-01-12T01:02:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	I see ;)
2011-01-12T01:17:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	any ideas if i want to keep my intel drivers?
2011-01-12T01:19:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	If you have no problems with other monitor, then the intel driver seems to be working correctly, I guess. So keep the intel driver.
2011-01-12T01:19:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	perhaps its just a problem with xserver config?
2011-01-12T01:21:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	Well you shouldn't need any xorg.conf with any recent ubuntu distribution. So if you have one, delete any /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-01-12T01:22:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	without it my video acceleration wont work
2011-01-12T01:24:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	In that case I would search for a (or file a) bug for your GPU. An Intel GPU should run  with 3d acceleration out of the box.
2011-01-12T01:25:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	also i think it messes up the sleeping and waking if i remove all the xorg config
2011-01-12T01:27:00.000Z	minimec	sniperjo_	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1634427.html
2011-01-12T01:29:00.000Z	sniperjo_	minimec	thanks, but with the xorg config and a different monitor everythign works fine, also, its not the video that freezes, its the whole system
