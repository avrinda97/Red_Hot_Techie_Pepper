2007-01-03T07:28:00.000Z	h3xis		it should say INSERT in bold letters on the bottom if youre doing it right
2007-01-03T07:28:00.000Z	h3xis		nano can suck it. vim > *
2007-01-03T07:28:00.000Z	lupine_85	h3xis	yeah, if you know how to use it
2007-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	lupine_85	h3xis	erm, no. All wep is easily hackable. Some WPA is, also
2007-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	erm, no. i suggest you look up the differing versions
2007-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	no
2007-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	WEP+
2007-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	for example.

2007-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	ph pfft :P
2007-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	well, i attended a seminar some time ago about wireless security and it's been implemented into several devices but is advertised as just WEP
2007-01-09T17:16:00.000Z	lupine_85	h3xis	advertising != reality
2007-01-09T17:16:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	sure it does
2007-01-09T17:16:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	because it's a POS?
2007-01-09T17:18:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	windows or any other OS sees WEP+ as WEP and it connects. it's not like WPA and WPA2.
2007-01-09T17:18:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	depends on the firmware
2007-01-09T17:19:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	im stubborn. i r teh winnar.
2007-01-09T17:37:00.000Z	lupine_85	h3xis	how is dependency hell going with it?
2007-01-09T17:37:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	what?
2007-01-09T17:38:00.000Z	h3xis	lupine_85	i didnt have any dependency problems with ut
2007-01-09T17:38:00.000Z	lupine_85	h3xis	cool
