2008-02-04T03:48:00.000Z	kunzy		i'm trying to install myth tv, and i do the ./configure and it says i need to install LAME mp3 stuff.  So i opened the synaptics? packet manager and installed them but i still get the error.  Any thoughts?
2008-02-04T03:49:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	wnen compiling from source also add the -dev packages of the dependency required
2008-02-04T03:49:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	do you have an example?   (I'm still learning this stuff)
2008-02-04T03:50:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	you are in synatpci right ? search for the lame pacakge for exemple , you see the lame package , next to it you will see  lame-dev  install that one as well
2008-02-04T03:51:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 Could have sworn i did that, i will double check
2008-02-04T03:54:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 Well, i got all but that one, figures.    Ok, so i just did the ./configure and at the end it says ./configure: 3510: qmake: not found
2008-02-04T03:55:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	that's a new one to me
2008-02-04T03:56:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	consider doing a search in the forum www.ubuntuforums.org
2008-02-04T03:57:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	qmake search in the repos returns results about qt3 I would suggest you try installiing qt3-dev-tools
2008-02-04T03:58:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 K, thanks i will take a look into that.  but i found a page that almost talks like you can install it with the package manager.
2008-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	check in menyu > systm < ADMIN > network , check the setting of your wiered connection
2008-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	  Are you sure that was meant for me?
2008-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	compiling ? then yes
2008-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 You told me to check my network connection   :P
2008-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	sorry , no not you
2008-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 Had me lost for a sec.
2008-02-04T04:07:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 Hmm, the whole ./configure and make and make install was just spinning tires.  But i found a page that tells me to
2008-02-04T04:08:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	apt always works,   packages in the repos are precompiled
2008-02-04T04:09:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 Sorry for the noobness, but can you expound on what the heck an apt, repos, and precompiled things are?  I am a windows dude walking into linux.
2008-02-04T04:11:00.000Z	kunzy	Pelo	 Awesome, now it makes more sense.  Thanks
2008-02-04T04:12:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	on linux in general you can always compile from the source which means you can pretty much install any app on any distro,  in ubuntu ( and other high-end distros) , you will have repositories of precomplied packages,  meainng that those packages have already been configured to instal with no issues on that particular distro,  ubuntu has the largest repositories of all distros,  all packages in the ubuntu repos will install on your comp
2008-02-04T04:12:00.000Z	Pelo	kunzy	and apt is the command that handles the install
