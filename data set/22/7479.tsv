2006-08-31T16:14:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	in that case you could do a server install, enable universe and multiverse repos, and then sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2006-08-31T16:15:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	source-o-matic should help you out with generating an appropriate sources.list with universe and multiverse repos enabled
2006-08-31T07:40:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	short simple instructions
2006-08-31T07:40:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	install dapper server cd, then go 'sudo apt-get fluxbox'
2006-08-31T07:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	pretty darn easy
2006-08-31T07:41:00.000Z	mabus	DJAdmiral	um, yeah... thanks for the try
2006-08-31T07:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	oh well. worth a shot
2006-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	oh hey mabus
2006-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	how are things going?
2006-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	mabus	DJAdmiral	Good, good.
2006-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	got through with flubuntu and whatnot?
2006-09-01T11:11:00.000Z	mabus	DJAdmiral	Just did a ubuntu server + LAMP + flux
2006-09-01T11:11:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	Out of curiosity - if you ran Gentoo before, why don't you make your own distro or something?
2006-09-01T11:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	I made my own distro once for learning how linux ticks
2006-09-01T11:12:00.000Z	mabus	DJAdmiral	Hmm, maybe I should.
2006-09-01T11:12:00.000Z	mabus	DJAdmiral	I just have so much stuff to learn... I have a membership to bitme, and more ebooks than I could read in a lifetime.
2006-09-01T11:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	whatever I've done on it so far is not too impressive though. I need to mount virtual kernel filesystems via a livecd and then run it
2006-09-01T11:13:00.000Z	mabus	DJAdmiral	It's hard to decide what to learn at any given point.
2006-09-01T11:13:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	and then again, all my text based distro can really do at the moment is just extract bzip2 and gzip tarballs and compile C and C++ source code
2006-09-01T11:14:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	I work on developing it every now and then. Maybe soon one day it'll have X and GNOME when it's ready.
2006-09-01T11:14:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	or X and Xfce. or X and KDE. or X and Flux. I still don't know what to choose lol
2006-09-01T11:14:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	mabus	Maybe I could help you out with it sometime?
