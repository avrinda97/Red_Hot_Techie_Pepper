2010-10-11T13:56:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	hello
2010-10-11T13:57:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	no 'manual' choice?
2010-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	disabled buttons, excepts "installNow"
2010-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	yes, no manuals choice
2010-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	have you any idea about it?
2010-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	not really, sorry.  maybe reboot?
2010-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	i tried a few times
2010-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	did  you install maverick yet?
2010-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	I did, I got the manual choice.
2010-10-11T14:02:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	you're sure your disc isn't the problem? what about your harddrives? can they be seen in other OSs/the liveCD?  you could boot the liveCD then install
2010-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	disk is ok. Gparted and fdisk expose itt correctly
2010-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	this one's GPT (but I'm not sure if I'm using EFI or not).  I'm sure it would work with MBR.  which is yours?
2010-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	MBR
2010-10-11T14:04:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	it's Acer desktop
2010-10-11T14:06:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	hmm... how about verifying the disc? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM, can't find the hashes for 10.10 though...
2010-10-11T14:06:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	ok, i'll try to chek it. Thank you
2010-10-11T14:07:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	yeah, sorry I'm not more help... I really don't know what could be causing this.  if you do have a faulty disc I'd say get the next one with bittorrent, that's usually pretty foolproof
2010-10-11T14:09:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	by the way, i've got same problem with RC image of Xubuntu yesterday
2010-10-11T14:09:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	odd... maybe it's something to do with your hardware? or a bug in the new installer...
2010-10-11T14:09:00.000Z	newbie_	randomOfAmber	but i decide that problem caused by RC status
2010-10-11T14:11:00.000Z	randomOfAmber	newbie_	np, gl
