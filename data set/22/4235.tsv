2008-02-13T12:13:00.000Z	joequincy		I'm about ready to just reinstall freaking windows. This is the worst installation experience I've ever had
2008-02-13T12:13:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	what happened?
2008-02-13T12:14:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	an hour ago I saw you ask 'ok I'm ready how do I start' next thing I know something is tough for the install?
2008-02-13T12:14:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	nothing. It shows a progress bar for a while, then ejects the disc. Nothing installs.
2008-02-13T12:15:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	what hardware? PC? Dell or Generic?  Laptop? What install CD you using?
2008-02-13T12:16:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	Dell Inspiron 1100 (about 3 years old). I'm using a disc from the DL .iso (UofU server)
2008-02-13T12:17:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	just got the .iso about two hours ago, so I know it's current
2008-02-13T12:19:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	laptop ok awesome I use a latitude d620 and got it to work off install CDs
2008-02-13T12:19:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	what exactly happens? boots into CD, you hit enter, then a progress bar, then reboot? please write as much details as you can
2008-02-13T12:23:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	okay, so here's what happens... I boot from CD, and it loads the options screen. I choose the default first option (Start or Install Ubuntu), and it goes to a progress bar. After about two minutes of that, the screen flicks on and off several times, before ending up off, but with the machine running. If I do nothing, it sits there forever. If I tap the power button, the screen flicks...
2008-02-13T12:29:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	I wonder if you can try dumbing-down to a lesser video-resolution
2008-02-13T12:31:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	there's no option that I can find. Also, the error won't show up now... it just tells me to remove the disc, close the tray, and hit "enter". I do so and it turns off, not installed.
2008-02-13T12:33:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	 there are options like F2, F3, F4, etc - they show you how to dumb-down the resolution
2008-02-13T12:33:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	can you try again - boot into CD menu, hit F1 - F6 to read the help info?
2008-02-13T12:34:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	where's that disk formatting utility that someone mentioned earlier?
2008-02-13T12:34:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	there HAS to be an option to lower resolution - can be done in the CD-installer's "boot command line" too
2008-02-13T12:35:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	gparted? it will overwrite stuff so don't use it if you are afraid to lose all data.
2008-02-13T12:35:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	It was already erased and rewritten several times by the guy who gave it to me. I don't really care.
2008-02-13T12:37:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	hey man this is a last-ditch-fallback idea -- there's probably a local ubuntu community group in your area - I'm sure if you showed up with the inspiron, they'd have you rocking out in no time.
2008-02-13T12:38:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	hmm. Don't know anybody here yet... where would Iook online?
2008-02-13T12:39:00.000Z	joequincy	karlNY	can Ubuntu use the NTFS file system?
2008-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	karlNY	joequincy	later on -- good luck -- you'll get it.
