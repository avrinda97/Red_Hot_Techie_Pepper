2006-12-09T08:39:00.000Z	mitchell		Anyone have an debootstrap experience?
2006-12-09T08:41:00.000Z	mitchell		Anyone had any problems with doing a debootstrap of dapper lately?
2006-12-09T08:42:00.000Z	psusi	mitchell	what kind of problems?
2006-12-09T08:42:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	It fails late in the game with a Failure while configuring base packages. This will be attempted 5 times..
2006-12-09T08:43:00.000Z	psusi	mitchell	strange...
2006-12-09T08:43:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	Right after I: Configuring ubuntu-keyring
2006-12-09T08:44:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	I have tried a couple of different versions of debootstrap and all have had issues at the same point..
2006-12-09T08:44:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	It will finally kick out I: Base system installed successfully. But the results are not bootable..
2006-12-09T08:45:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	Well.. I am running 6.06 1 LTS.. Which debootstrap should I use?
2006-12-09T08:46:00.000Z	psusi	mitchell	the one from 6.06... that apt-get install will install if your sources.list are correct
2006-12-09T08:47:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	Okay..
2006-12-09T08:48:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	All right.. I removed the installed version and did an apt-get install debootstrap.. I will give it another go..
2006-12-09T08:49:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	It would be nice if I did not have to download these packages each time. Is there way to store them for each attempt?
2006-12-09T08:50:00.000Z	psusi	mitchell	yea... just never done it... but there was something on the wiki about setting up your own repository mirror/cache
2006-12-09T08:50:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	Yeah.. I read it, but it did not make much sense...
2006-12-09T08:58:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	It bailed again in the same spot...
2006-12-09T08:58:00.000Z	psusi	mitchell	and you are trying to debootstrap into an empty directory right?
2006-12-09T08:59:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	Yep...
2006-12-09T08:59:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	Like this: debootstrap --arch i386 dapper /mnt/dapper http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
2006-12-09T09:00:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	/mnt/dapper is a filesystem I setup just for chroot or a VM..
2006-12-09T09:00:00.000Z	psusi	mitchell	I'm not sure what the http part is for, I usually just do debootstrap dapper /mnt/dapper
2006-12-09T09:00:00.000Z	mitchell	psusi	Hmm..Okay.. I will try that...
