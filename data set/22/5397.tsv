2007-05-08T11:23:00.000Z	Pelo	AhmedTheGreat	 I see,   you might get better help on this in #beryl then,  they've probably dealt with this before
2007-05-08T11:24:00.000Z	Pelo	AhmedTheGreat	you had to use the restricted thing to enable your nvidia card, then you would have been ok,  but I donT' know how to get you back from where you are,  #beryl or #ubuntu-effects  might be able to help
