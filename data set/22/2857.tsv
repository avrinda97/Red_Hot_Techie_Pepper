2009-02-12T06:41:00.000Z	lacita		need to know what wireless driver i m running? Any ideas?
2009-02-12T06:41:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	dmesg usually has that information
2009-02-12T06:41:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	(that's a command to run, try "dmesg|less")
2009-02-12T06:42:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	thanks
2009-02-12T06:43:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	omg so much information!!!
2009-02-12T07:00:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	I found this:
2009-02-12T07:01:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	I meant I found this: iwl3945: Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection driver for Linux, 1.2.0
2009-02-12T07:03:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	I was hoping for something like "madwifi-ng" or "R8187", etc.
2009-02-12T07:03:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	iwl3945 it is then
2009-02-12T07:03:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	(can probably confirm that by running "lsmod" and checking if the module is used)
2009-02-12T07:05:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	looks right: iwlwifi_mac80211      218980  1 iwl3945
2009-02-12T07:05:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	but I also see this: iwl3945                89844  0
2009-02-12T07:05:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	that's actually iwl3945 using a more basic module, but that still confirms iwl3945 is loaded :)
2009-02-12T07:05:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	I don't know how normal the "0" there is (pretty normal if the interface is currently disabled)
2009-02-12T07:06:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	enabled, but not active at the moment
2009-02-12T07:11:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	Oh, wait, an there's this too: cfg80211               15112  1 iwlwifi_mac80211
2009-02-12T07:12:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	almost certainly yes
2009-02-12T07:12:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	(some components are shared by a couple of network drivers, this is one of them)
2009-02-12T07:13:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	could I replace my wireless driver with madwifi?
2009-02-12T07:13:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	I have no idea, sorry
2009-02-12T07:13:00.000Z	mzz	lacita	(I don't really have a laptop, so I know very little about wireless)
2009-02-12T07:13:00.000Z	lacita	mzz	thanks anyway
