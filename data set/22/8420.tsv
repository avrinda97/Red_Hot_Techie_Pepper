2006-05-10T15:57:00.000Z	mick		where does xorg.conf live?
2006-05-10T15:57:00.000Z	mick		thx
2006-05-10T15:59:00.000Z	mick		so, in order to make myself completely inept, what is the command to edit xorg.conf?
2006-05-10T15:59:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	use your favorite, gedit, vi, emacs
2006-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	why?
2006-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	so i can edit it
2006-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	i want to get dual monitor set up
2006-05-11T16:23:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	it's safer to just use sudo when you want to edit it
2006-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	explain sudo
2006-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	it lets you run as root for a single command
2006-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	ah
2006-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	more secure that way
2006-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	 so like "sudo gedit xorg.conf"?
2006-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	yeah, of course you don't have to use gedit, you could use whatever editor you like
2006-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	but prefacing the command with sudo will give you the temporary permissions you need to actually edit it
2006-05-11T16:26:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	 well, gedit is all i know right now, vi confuses the shit out of me
2006-05-11T16:26:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	yeah it's a fun one to learn  :-)
2006-05-11T16:50:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	can you take a moment of your time and see if you can help me?
2006-05-11T16:50:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	sure but I don't know much about xorg.conf (never touched mine)
2006-05-11T16:50:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	well, i am just folowing someone elses example
2006-05-11T16:51:00.000Z	mick	jeff303	but i am more or less brand new to linux
2006-05-11T16:51:00.000Z	jeff303	mick	I'll give it a shot, what's up
