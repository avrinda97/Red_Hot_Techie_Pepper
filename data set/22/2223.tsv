2009-08-30T12:09:00.000Z	pm_41		hey
2009-08-30T12:11:00.000Z	pm_41		i think you need the ubuntustudio packages for HDMI support
2009-08-30T12:12:00.000Z	pm_41		might be a bad package you've downloaded through Synaptic
2009-08-30T12:14:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	through synaptic i see many different components of ubuntustudio but not one specific program that seems to be the base.
2009-08-30T12:16:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	thanks for the heads up, i am using synaptic to download both of those packages right now.  lets hope this helps.
2009-08-30T12:18:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	that sounds like a pretty wild guess.  but its worth trying when all else fails.
2009-08-30T12:18:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	and if it doesnt work i'll have some new toys
2009-08-30T12:25:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	he got skillz, thats how.
2009-08-30T12:26:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	why would you need NTFS if you're running Linux?
2009-08-30T12:27:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	i wouldn't know, i don't have his skillz. i'm using ext4
2009-08-30T12:28:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	i do not disagree with anything you just said.  i am using xfs for my boot partition and ext4 for my root partition.  though i'm not sure if xfs is good for boot, i just figured i'd try it.
2009-08-30T12:32:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	make sure to use ApTON CD to make a CD backup of your apps!
2009-08-30T12:33:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	that is a great hint but i've yet to install any apps, this is a fresh install that i think i killed trying to fix my audio problem.
2009-08-30T12:36:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	if it's recognized in Windows, it may be a proprietary driver. I've had the same problem with my Broadcom wifi card for years! Sadly, there's not Windows driver conversion tool for HDMI... :(
2009-08-30T12:38:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	like I said, ubuntu and proprietary stuff don't mix
2009-08-30T12:51:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	from HDMI? :O
2009-08-30T12:51:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	it sounded like sh*t, lots of pausing, but the audio file made a sound.  very buggy but it worked.
2009-08-30T12:52:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	it's a start. at least you know you're on the right track! :D
2009-08-30T12:55:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	told you! ubuntu studio helps! :P
2009-08-30T12:56:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	plus, you have all of those cool audio/video customizer apps to fool around with :P
2009-08-30T12:56:00.000Z	eltew	pm_41	now that i got it to work i wanna reinstall linux just to do it again to prove what i did to fix it. so that way i'll always be sure.
2009-08-30T12:57:00.000Z	pm_41	eltew	if you want a real treat, install the ubuntustudio-desktop package to get the cool GTK theme and icon set from the distro
