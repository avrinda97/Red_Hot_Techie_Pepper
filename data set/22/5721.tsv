2007-06-25T15:52:00.000Z	gerro		anyone know how to remaster a xubuntu cd to remove floppy support or a simple boot option to disable fd0 (floppy)
2007-06-25T15:52:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	What ?
2007-06-25T15:53:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	read the last post here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/95857
2007-06-25T15:54:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	I can't use any sort of ubuntu until I kill off my imaginary floppy drive caused by my switchable floppy/cdrom dock that sucks so horribly
2007-06-25T15:55:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	install from usb?
2007-06-25T15:55:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	or null-modem cable
2007-06-25T15:55:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	or floppy
2007-06-25T15:56:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	fine usb method, do you have a link to a guide for that?
2007-06-25T15:57:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	I don't want a system that uses fat32 or some broken down 6.06 ubuntu I want feisty 7.04 and working normally as if installed through cd
2007-06-25T15:57:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	most those guides for usb install on ubuntu site are horrible
2007-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	can't you rip the flopy out ?
2007-06-26T16:07:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	thx for all the help, I'm just kind of frustrated and having a bad day. Got the problem fixed though
2007-06-26T16:07:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	No problem
2007-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	uggh its still not working... but I got rid of some of the buffer I/O error on device fd0, logical block messages now lot of sr0 ones and 2 fd0s
2007-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	I tried disabling floppy in bios
2007-06-26T16:12:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	there is *no* floppy, the thing is the cdrom can be taken out and switched with a floppy anytime I think its hot swappable too perhaps, so the kernel is trying to detect an imaginary floppy drive and getting that confused with the cd its booting off of
2007-06-26T16:12:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	Do you have a floppy disk ?
2007-06-26T16:13:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	apt-get install fluxbox, done
2007-06-26T16:13:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	that isn't fluxbuntu it uses rox and few other things
2007-06-26T16:14:00.000Z	gerro	wietz0r	but i will have same problem as the cd
2007-06-26T16:14:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	apt-get install fluxbox, rox, etcetera"
2007-06-26T16:14:00.000Z	wietz0r	gerro	O :(
