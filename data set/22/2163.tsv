2009-09-13T19:27:00.000Z	server_side		noob question i know, but what makes ubuntu better from any other distro?
2009-09-13T19:28:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	ease of use imo
2009-09-13T19:28:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	some other distros are faster, but have less HW support
2009-09-13T19:29:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	I do too
2009-09-13T19:29:00.000Z	server_side	kahrg	and it runs nice?
2009-09-13T19:30:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	super nice,
2009-09-13T19:30:00.000Z	server_side	kahrg	great to hear, you come from windows too?
2009-09-13T19:30:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	Yeah, On my laptops i boot only ubuntu, but my desktop with the GTX 260 i dual boot. I play Warhammer online when in windows, otherwise im in linux
2009-09-13T19:31:00.000Z	server_side	kahrg	shall i install windows and then linux to dual boot them?
2009-09-13T19:31:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	depends on what you want to do, what are you looking for?
2009-09-13T19:32:00.000Z	server_side	kahrg	linux as my main os , and windows on  like a 30 gig out of my 500 incase i need to use that os
2009-09-13T19:33:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	Best way to do that is to install windows first, then linux. For linux , i suggest setting up your "/" on a 10g partition and your "/home" on another. Incase you ever clobber your install
2009-09-13T19:34:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	ubuntu doesnt come with bloat, just extras, you can just install normally and get rid of what you dont want
2009-09-13T19:36:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	For the most part, yea :)
2009-09-13T19:37:00.000Z	server_side	kahrg	is there any good guide for getting used to linux filse system
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	Its pretty easy to use, if you've used computers for a while, you can jump right into it. www.ubuntuforums.org is a great place to browse around at diff topics, if you get stuck, just search for your answer there. Years of posts
2009-09-13T19:59:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	thats all personal prefference, and I think its funny that you said polished, everything is way too shiny for me :p
2009-09-13T19:59:00.000Z	server_side	kahrg	lol
2009-09-13T20:01:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	games, and the "easy" way
2009-09-13T20:01:00.000Z	kahrg	server_side	90% of HW and SW are still designed for windows
