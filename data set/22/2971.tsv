2009-05-23T10:25:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		okay usr13 I did that
2009-05-23T10:26:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	/media/mountpoint in ubuntu
2009-05-23T10:28:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	ubuntu normally mounts everything under /media and does not use /mnt at all, what you decide to do is up to you.
2009-05-23T10:36:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	in what way?
2009-05-23T10:37:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	so have you set up firefox to read the profile from that location?
2009-05-23T10:38:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	ooh hold on :D
2009-05-23T10:39:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	:)
2009-05-23T10:41:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	one thing that might be an issue when sharing the profile is that some extensions works/doesn't work differently on win/GLin...
2009-05-23T10:41:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	yes, but I know all the ones I have work in both.
2009-06-02T18:26:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	frequent crashes? (Please state your problem...)
2009-06-02T18:26:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	yeah, when I try to view flash.  grays out
2009-06-02T18:29:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	I would recommend the alpha release for 64bit from adobe labs: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html << You need to uninstall all standard flash packages and put that file inside ~/.mozilla/plugins/
2009-06-02T18:29:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	I will try
2009-06-02T18:30:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	I have at least gotten away from most crashes with that one, it still hangs on occasion, but works overall far better in my experience.
2009-06-02T18:32:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	where do I put the plugin?  There is no plugin in .mozzilla
2009-06-02T18:35:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	~/.mozilla/plugins/ If the derectory does not exist create it.
2009-06-02T18:36:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	There are nice instructions in that link
2009-06-02T18:42:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	Does it show up as 10.0 r22 if you go to about:plugins ?
2009-06-02T18:43:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	I don't see it
2009-06-02T18:43:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	there it is, at the bottom
2009-06-02T18:44:00.000Z	arand	TheFunkbomb	Fair enough, so far I've only heard of improvement on switching to the alpha version, odd.
2009-06-02T18:44:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	arand	as soon as I go to youtube, firefox just closes
