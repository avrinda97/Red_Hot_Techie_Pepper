2010-01-25T04:43:00.000Z	deltafunction007		can someone help me with the internet connection question?
2010-01-25T04:44:00.000Z	deltafunction007		yes wireless on Intel PRO 2200BG
2010-01-25T04:44:00.000Z	deltafunction007		it appears connected and even can access internet and ping gateway for about 20 seconds
2010-01-25T04:45:00.000Z	deltafunction007		but then connection no longer works, though it appears as "connected"
2010-01-25T04:45:00.000Z	deltafunction007		WPA2
2010-01-25T04:46:00.000Z	deltafunction007		I deleted all wireless connections and then accepted one auto wireless (from available networks in Ubuntu bbar)
2010-01-25T04:47:00.000Z	deltafunction007		ifconfig shows: eth0, eth1, lo  and only eth1 RUNNING   -  which is the wireless
2010-01-25T04:48:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	what does iwcofig by itself return?
2010-01-25T04:48:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	you are probably going to need pastebin to show us
2010-01-25T04:49:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	in the future use "ip route". route and ifconfig will go away eventually
2010-01-25T05:02:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	does the MAC address of "Access point" list in inwconfig match your actual AP?
2010-01-25T05:03:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	also look in /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages for errors relating to wifi
2010-01-25T05:03:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	yes
2010-01-25T05:04:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	and can you ping the router?
2010-01-25T05:06:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	what are your locale settings?
2010-01-25T05:07:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	you still have not answered if you can ping the router
2010-01-25T05:07:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	can you also pastebin the "ip route" output as well please
2010-01-25T05:08:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	do you see any messages that might be wifi related in "dmesg"?
2010-01-25T05:10:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	also, which wifi device speficially?  "lspci |grep Network\ controller"
2010-01-25T05:14:00.000Z	deltafunction007	meganerd	ip route  ->  http://paste.ubuntu.com/362265/
2010-01-25T05:15:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	and just after you get ping timeouts, what do you see in dmesg (or the log files /var/log/syslog and messages
2010-01-25T05:33:00.000Z	meganerd	deltafunction007	that looks fine, you should see TRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS line repeating as long as you are online
