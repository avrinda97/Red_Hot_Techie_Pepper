2012-01-31T02:06:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	what happens when you adjust the speaker volume in alsamixer?
2012-01-31T02:07:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	that was the first thing i check but i cant remember if i checked it in 11.10 or 10.04lts which is what iam running right now
2012-01-31T02:07:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	let me double check
2012-01-31T02:14:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	no sound and everything is checked and un-muted and turned up max
2012-01-31T02:14:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	did it think you have more than one set of speakers?
2012-01-31T02:16:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	ummm.... i dont think so
2012-01-31T02:17:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	does your tablet have a headphone jack?
2012-01-31T02:17:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	At the top it just has one tab "Sigmatec STAC975,59'
2012-01-31T02:17:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	does it get sound through the headphones?
2012-01-31T02:18:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	no
2012-01-31T02:19:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	clearly the sound driver isn't working then
2012-01-31T02:19:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	clearly.... i cant find linux drivers for it
2012-01-31T02:20:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	alsa must think it has a driver for your sound chip, or else it wouldn't have shown you a mixer screen
2012-01-31T02:21:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	what are my options now?
2012-01-31T02:21:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	I'd suggest you ask at the Alsa forum. Because their driver for your sound chip is broken
2012-01-31T02:22:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	and where is that? do they have an IRC
2012-01-31T02:24:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	it appears there is at least #alsa channel here on freenode
2012-01-31T02:24:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	nvm on the site i found it but do you if they have an IRC? and do you know anything about Wacom styluses?
2012-01-31T02:26:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	sorry I don't know about wacom tablets
2012-01-31T02:27:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	at least maybe the people on #alsa can help with your sound
2012-01-31T02:28:00.000Z	glacia	flavor32	true thank you for your help
2012-01-31T02:48:00.000Z	flavor32	glacia	those tools general come in the base install
