2009-03-15T11:15:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	your issue: you have virus took out windows pc, you want to recover 1 file but don't want to spend weekend on it, right?
2009-03-15T11:15:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	yes sir
2009-03-15T11:17:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	- I had to recover fragged XP install, which is how I got into linux (this month).  I got a ubuntu recovery disk, had ALL kinds of goodies, so I was able to back up files
2009-03-15T11:18:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	- get a linux recovery disk, you should be able to boot and see your windows files, back it up onto a floppy/usb, then: format/reinstall.  Shouldn't take you more than a couple hours
2009-03-15T11:19:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	i have recover programs on windows and trouble shooting, reformatting softwae on both windows and linux so either is fine by me.  if you have any pesonal picks please share with me those goodies applications you used in ubuntu's OS
2009-03-15T11:19:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	sure, one sec
2009-03-15T11:19:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	coffee break but will find link to recovery disk
2009-03-15T11:20:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	Ndshacker:  about half the time, my windows computer freeeze at the logo splash screen of the bios, and the over half it loggs into windows, but then bluue screens.  I have notice this same blue screen issue while trying to scan with my anti-virus apllication either in safe mode or normal user of windows
2009-03-15T11:24:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	thank you sir. i am browsing it now
2009-03-15T11:26:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	lol! haha... yeah.  Just boot up with that CD.. or hell, you don't really even need to use a recovery CD, honestly. but boot up with CD on windows machine, mount windows HD. won't take 30 mins if you're lucky
2009-03-15T11:27:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	this website and recover application is only directed towards GNU/UNIX base OS correct?
2009-03-15T11:29:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	yes, directe for linux.  doesn't matter... if you can boot up, you can recover your file, then reformat/reinstall. Best solution unless you have a hard drive full of important info that you have to save
2009-03-15T11:30:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	You could try to recover system with antivirus, but ... why go through the effort?
2009-03-15T11:31:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	It worked enough to save my windows machine data
2009-03-15T11:32:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	downloading it right now. hahha i didn't know there was a wget for windws base OS.  i Would love that feature in my dos command prompt
2009-03-15T11:34:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	the swap partition??/
2009-03-15T11:35:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	you think it's a waste of hard drive space if your not using a sleep funcation?  is this what oyu are asking?
2009-03-15T11:36:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	dr_willis, ndshacker - I mean, I have 3 partitions already on my HD, so if I didn't have to use a partition for swapfile, it would be useful to me to have a 4th partition free
2009-03-15T11:37:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	lol ... ah, yeah good luck
2009-03-15T11:37:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	: It will work, no worries
2009-03-15T11:40:00.000Z	sugi	fieldse	im glad you got that pun, i thought it was a little corn :p
2009-03-15T11:41:00.000Z	fieldse	sugi	lol.... wasn't sure if it was a japanification or an intention pun, but my hat's off to you
