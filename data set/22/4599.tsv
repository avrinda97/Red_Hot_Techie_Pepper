2007-12-01T05:59:00.000Z	Hanyou		Hello, I have a Gutsy install that is not pulling down an IP address from DHCP, but has all the drivers installed and I am posting this from a Gutsy laptop at the same time the desktop is running. So it's not a Linux issue. Please help!
2007-12-01T06:01:00.000Z	Hanyou		No, I can't even execute a ping command.
2007-12-01T06:01:00.000Z	Hanyou		To my Local net*
2007-12-01T06:01:00.000Z	Hanyou		I.E. 192.168.0.1-254 I get nothing.
2007-12-01T06:03:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	you can try running the dhclient command on the command line (Just "sudo dhclient eth#" where eth# is your network card [ussually eth0]) and see if you get any type of errors
2007-12-01T06:09:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	When I run that command from terminal I get good results and it binds to 192.168.0.42, but still no internet access or ability to ping local IP's.
2007-12-01T06:09:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	run ifconfig and make sure the ip / netmask and other settings look ok
2007-12-01T06:11:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	Stupid question "What is bcast in Linux's ifconfig?"
2007-12-01T06:11:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	broadcast, it should normally be 192.168.0.255 on a 255.255.255.0 netmask
2007-12-01T06:12:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	Then everything looks fine IP of 192.168.0.42 bcast of 192.168.0.255 and standard netmask.
2007-12-01T06:14:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	so pings to other local addresses that are local do not work?
2007-12-01T06:15:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	It now pings to 192.168.0.1-254, but not to my net at the other end of a point to point T1 that has the local IP range of 192.168.1.1-254. It needs to ping to that to get out to the net.
2007-12-01T06:16:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	I have my laptop running the same config and it is not having any problems so I doubt it's just Linux unfriendly hardware.
2007-12-01T06:16:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	your laptop is also on the 192.168.0 network and can ping the 192.168.1?
2007-12-01T06:16:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	check the output of route -n on your laptop and desktop and compare
2007-12-01T06:17:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	Yes, just double checked.
2007-12-01T06:18:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	and this is probably a stupid question, but the netmask and broadcast are the same on desktop and laptop?
2007-12-01T06:18:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	My laptop was having similar problems earlier today, but it resolved itself mysteriously.
2007-12-01T06:18:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	I will check.
2007-12-01T06:19:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	They are the same.
2007-12-01T06:19:00.000Z	kelsin	Hanyou	honestly this goes beyond my understanding then :-( good luck with it
2007-12-01T06:20:00.000Z	Hanyou	kelsin	Don't worry I bashed my head with my laptop for 2 hours today for it to mysteriously start working tonight.
