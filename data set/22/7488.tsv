2006-03-22T06:23:00.000Z	jadaz87	brenner	does totem xine support mpeg?
2006-03-22T06:25:00.000Z	brenner	jadaz87	w/ w32codecs, yes.
2006-03-22T06:27:00.000Z	jadaz87	brenner	aalright
2006-03-27T17:46:00.000Z	brenner	jadaz87	IdleOne sent you a wiki link. my guess is your monitor rates are wrong
2006-03-27T17:53:00.000Z	jadaz87	brenner	the problem is that the 'sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange' command does not work and i have a laptop and i do not know who makes the screen
2006-03-27T17:55:00.000Z	brenner	jadaz87	i see.  run the reconfigure script.  when you get to the monitor config, you need to  at least choose the middle option in the menu (chooses the max res) iirc
2006-03-27T06:01:00.000Z	jadaz87	brenner	so after i do ctrl+alt+backspace and it comes up to the console how do i restart xserver?
2006-03-27T06:01:00.000Z	brenner	jadaz87	it should start gnome again automaticaly, if it doesn't, just login and type 'startx'
2006-03-27T06:07:00.000Z	jadaz87	brenner	i tried your middle option and restart x went to Sys>PRef> Screen Res and i am still at 1024x768 as a maximum
