2008-01-28T22:43:00.000Z	shift1		i mean can it mess up my system, or really ruin how ubutnu runs like the "pop-up" claims?
2008-01-28T22:44:00.000Z	shift1		how can i make it so i dont have to use password to sign-in to ubuntu every time i login, right now im logging in as "home" is that the higest user? it wont let me login as root.. or if you can how do you do that?
2008-01-28T22:44:00.000Z	shift1		uhuh
2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	shift1		okay well, how can i make it so "home" does not keep asking for a password each time i boot, or every time i try to install an app.
2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	shift1		okay thats fine, thank you. i just want to remove the password off "home"
2008-01-28T22:46:00.000Z	shift1		yes in the list of "users" i have "home" and "root"
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		well i see "home" and "root"
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	pajamian	shift1	you can remove it from when you login if you trust anyone that has physical access to the computer, but it's recommended that you don't try to remove it from things such as updates because that is how any kind of virus or attacker that gets into your system can escalate his privs.
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		oh okay
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		thats fine then
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	shift1		okay well would removing LOGIN password be bad?
2008-01-28T22:48:00.000Z	shift1	adelie	can i message u?
2008-01-28T22:49:00.000Z	pajamian	shift1	goto System menu / Administration / Login Window and select the users tab, from there you can select a user to auto-login.
2008-01-28T22:53:00.000Z	shift1		well would removing the password from the "login" screen be bad too? i dont mind putting in the password when installing packages.
2008-01-28T22:53:00.000Z	shift1		how can i turn on autologin?
2008-01-28T22:54:00.000Z	shift1		i dont know the commands im very sorry, i just installed ubuntu yesterday, after a week of playing around on live cds.
2008-01-28T22:54:00.000Z	shift1		hey watch your language please
2008-01-28T22:56:00.000Z	shift1		to turn on AutoLogin what do i do exactly after going into  System -> Administration -> Login Window, i just dont want to mess anything up.
2008-01-28T22:57:00.000Z	pajamian	shift1	select the security tab, then check the box for "Enable Automatic Login" and pick a user name from the list (probably home).
