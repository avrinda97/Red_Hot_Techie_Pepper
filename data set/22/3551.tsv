2008-12-07T19:57:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	nvm I see utf but i still dont know what it means...
2008-12-07T19:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	yours... /dev/scd1       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0...   mine... /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec 0       0
2008-12-07T19:58:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	ok i try to remove it and sudo mount -a
2008-12-07T19:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	It is probably another issue... but wanted to point out the dif from mine and yours.. are those drives sata or ide
2008-12-07T19:59:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	the cdroms are ide
2008-12-07T19:59:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	still no go....
2008-12-07T20:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	it is still oh dark 30 here.. not ready for real questions yet.. sorry
2008-12-09T22:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	no
2008-12-09T22:44:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	can you be a little more specific?
2008-12-09T22:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	mac address is not encrypted and can be caught and spoofed
2008-12-09T22:45:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	The only reason I ask is that there is a bug in the intel 3945 driver that won't allow any type of WEP encryption.
2008-12-09T22:45:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	thank you I thought so I just needed someone to confirm.
2008-12-09T22:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	If security is an issue, get a card with native drivers.
2008-12-09T22:46:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	iwl3945 is a native driver but its currently suffered a regression.
2008-12-09T22:49:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	sidd1 thank you. You've both answered my question.
2008-12-10T03:11:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	you're a smart guy, do you have any suggestions for an online resource that will explain in newb friendly terms how to compile a custom kernel with built-in drivers?
2008-12-10T03:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	nope
2008-12-11T09:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DefunctProcess	at the login you can pick which you want to use
2008-12-11T09:57:00.000Z	DefunctProcess	Jack_Sparrow	thanks but thats not the question i asked, I know how to chose gnome or kde session im talking about the login daemon, tritium was correct
