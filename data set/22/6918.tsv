2008-10-18T02:59:00.000Z	iamelite		Hey Quick question: Can anyone point me in the direction of how to install a basic linux kernel to a harddrive. For purpose of getting the drive to boot solo without a live cd. I have as my only tool a ubuntu live CD PPC build.
2008-10-18T02:59:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Is your computer a PPC?
2008-10-18T03:00:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Just install an OS. Ubuntu 6.06 has a PPC version
2008-10-18T03:00:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	A kernel without anything with it is useless
2008-10-18T03:00:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	I know enough about the command line to navigate and install packages
2008-10-18T03:01:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	A kernel on its own wouldn't even have a command line
2008-10-18T03:01:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	Very well, i am ignorant to the words that im using. Im fairly new. What i want is a command line and no X
2008-10-18T03:02:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Then get Ubuntu Server Edition
2008-10-18T03:02:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	That is ubuntu without X
2008-10-18T03:02:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	can i aquire and install a script for that from a Xubuntu Live PPC Graphical Desktop?
2008-10-18T03:02:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	What?
2008-10-18T03:03:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	I can only boot the computer as it is now with a Live CD. Can i Install or download from the internet onto that machine the Server Edition, without having to burn or copy a new boot medium.
2008-10-18T03:04:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Not as far as I know. Is the Live CD you're using an ubuntu CD?
2008-10-18T03:05:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	Yes it is the Xubuntu Desktop PowerPC build Live
2008-10-18T03:06:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Then install Xubuntu and remove X later
2008-10-18T03:07:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	At 82% installation completion, upon it attempting to configure apt, i get an unrecoverable error of "invalid Mirror"
2008-10-18T03:07:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	one that i cannot bypass in that graphical installer
2008-10-18T03:07:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Because old dapper mirrors have moved
2008-10-18T03:07:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Get the Alternate CD. It has a textmode installer
2008-10-18T03:09:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	If i were to mount a partition for download, on the harddrive, on the machine running the standard Desktop CD. Is it possible to aquire the files from the Alternate CD and execute its installation into the terminal?
2008-10-18T03:10:00.000Z	iamelite	Some_Person	well... fishsticks. Im out of CDs to burn
2008-10-18T03:11:00.000Z	Some_Person	iamelite	Then buy some CDs. They are cheap these days
