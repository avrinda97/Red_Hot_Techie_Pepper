2009-12-29T23:39:00.000Z	luisgmarine		hey quick questions guys I added the ppa for banshee on hardy
2009-12-29T23:39:00.000Z	luisgmarine		but the version is old (1.4) when 1.5 is already out
2009-12-29T23:40:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	What version was available in the PPA?
2009-12-29T23:40:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	1.5
2009-12-29T23:41:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	Do you have a link to the ppa that you can share?
2009-12-29T23:41:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	I don't knwo if it has to do anything because I'm using hardy instead of karmic
2009-12-29T23:42:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	https://edge.launchpad.net/~banshee-team/+archive/ppa
2009-12-29T23:42:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	okay, one moment
2009-12-29T23:42:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	I see 1.5.4 for karmkic, but the one for hardy is still at 1.4.3
2009-12-29T23:43:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	Then theres nothing you can do.
2009-12-29T23:43:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	that's BS, lol
2009-12-29T23:43:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	I rolled back to LTS for a more stable system.  Not so I can suffer new features of few selected programs that I use on a day to day basis
2009-12-29T23:44:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	More stable means that you will not be running the latest and greatest software.
2009-12-29T23:45:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	If you contact the Banshee Team, there is a chance that they could provide a build of the newer version for Hardy.
2009-12-29T23:46:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	i could try to build one myself, sounds like fun
2009-12-30T00:12:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	you still around?
2009-12-30T00:13:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	Yes
2009-12-30T00:13:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	cool, gona e-mail the dude that makes the builds and ask him if there is any way to make an updated one for ubuntu hardy.
2009-12-30T00:14:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	you wouldn't happen to know a fix around why my ipod isn't detectable in banshee do you?  I tried the "killall -9 nautilus" fix that I use in karmic but it just freezes my whole computer on Hardy
2009-12-30T00:15:00.000Z	Pici	luisgmarine	I've never actually used Banshee, sorry.
2009-12-30T00:15:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	damn that sucks
2009-12-30T00:15:00.000Z	luisgmarine	Pici	o well time to keep googling then
