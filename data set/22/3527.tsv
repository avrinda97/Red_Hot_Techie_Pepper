2011-05-01T06:43:00.000Z	leoechevarria		hey guys, i've got a little question: i've just installed 11.04, logged into ubuntu-classic by default, installed nvidia-current (i'm using geforce 6150 on a desktop), rebooted, but it's still running ubuntu-classic by default, even if i select just ubuntu from gdm login screen, any idea? i wanna try out unity!
2011-05-01T06:45:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	try logging out and when at login screen usually at the bottom you can select your desktop environment after clicking your name
2011-05-01T06:45:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dustin_	isn't the 'ubuntu' session the unity one?
2011-05-01T06:45:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	since 9.10 mine autologins to last session
2011-05-01T06:46:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	I would think so but I have a kustom Gnome desktop so I havent used unity at all
2011-05-01T06:48:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dustin_	i keep selecting the session 'ubunt' but still it runs gnome 2.3.x
2011-05-01T06:50:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	I am looking at it on http://scottlinux.com/2011/03/05/ubuntu-11-04-change-from-unity-to-classic-gnome/ link there
2011-05-01T06:56:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	well I am going to start the upgrade now and I will be albe to tell you for sure soon
2011-05-01T06:57:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	or you may hear me cussing at my computer from anyplace in the world..... ;)
2011-05-01T06:58:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dustin_	don't take such a work if it's not necessary
2011-05-01T06:58:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	I want to make the upgrade anyway but dual screens make upgrading a pain at times
2011-05-01T06:59:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	check your proprietary drivers
2011-05-01T07:00:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	did you check your proprietary drivers?
2011-05-01T07:01:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	they are usualy disabled on upgrade
2011-05-01T07:01:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dustin_	what do you mean by checking? i installed 11.04 from stracth, then installed nvidia-current package
2011-05-01T07:01:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	ok sounds like you have the correct drivers then and they are enabled
2011-05-01T07:02:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dustin_	i think they are
2011-05-01T07:03:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	unity may have a small glitch on your system
2011-05-01T07:04:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dustin_	i will not make much of a trouble of it...i just wanted to try it but then install gnome 3 any way :P
2011-05-01T07:04:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	well I am doing my upgrade now so I hope some luck fallows me today
2011-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dustin_	good luck with that :P
2011-05-01T07:06:00.000Z	dustin_	leoechevarria	 ty for the luck wishes
