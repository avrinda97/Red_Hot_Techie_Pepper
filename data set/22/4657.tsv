2008-01-13T13:41:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	doesn't sudo apt-get remove --purge program get rid of the config files as well?
2008-01-13T13:42:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	 I've found that some files are left - use synaptic and click on "status"
2008-01-13T13:44:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	I just checked and found some residual compiz folders, even though I did a complete remove through synaptic. Strange.
2008-01-13T13:45:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	that's why synaptic was invented - good on the developers :)
2008-02-27T00:17:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	gparted is in the menu of the live cd
2008-02-27T00:17:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	But if it's spitting out errors when it starts up he won't see them by starting it through the menu.
2008-02-27T17:03:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	that's a gconf editor setting
2008-02-27T17:05:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	apps - gnome session - options
2008-02-27T17:08:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	Thanks. I'll take a look at that. Though, it would result in drawing the background twice, so I might just sit through a black screen for 1.2 seconds. :)
2008-02-27T17:08:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	I have a pic come up then the b/ground is  drawn
2008-02-29T15:53:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	remove current user from the admin group
2008-02-29T15:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	Yeah... I will, but not before I setup a second account that has admin group privelages. :)
2008-02-29T15:54:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	that's how I run the os
2008-02-29T15:55:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	I found my answer. I want to create a new administrator account. Then change mine to a desktop user.
2008-02-29T15:56:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	I used the first user setup for admin then created a new one with limited rights - similar
2008-02-29T15:58:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	the power is intoxicating - care is needed!
2008-02-29T16:04:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	I feel... different. I just ran, sudo apt-get update and nothing happened. gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf too, did nothing. I feel.. free. :)
2008-02-29T16:05:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	it can be such a lack a resposibility that all stress is removed :)
2008-03-03T14:50:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	Amaranth is an op... easy big fella. :)
2008-03-03T14:50:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	k
2008-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	ere4si	Ahh... sorry, I thought you made a typo for 'op'. My bad.
2008-03-03T14:52:00.000Z	ere4si	ArthurArchnix	k :)
