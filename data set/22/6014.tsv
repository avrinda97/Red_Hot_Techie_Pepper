2008-12-14T04:45:00.000Z	gauteh		hey guys.. im the developer of gnome-schedule, and right now im trying to help somebody set up cron and at
2008-12-14T04:45:00.000Z	gauteh		does anyone have know of a tutorial, howto for these things?
2008-12-14T04:45:00.000Z	gauteh		and how is the daemons started (note, im not using ubuntu myself - so im just gonna pass the info on)
2008-12-14T04:46:00.000Z	gauteh		are*
2008-12-14T04:46:00.000Z	gauteh		just the names of the init scripts for atd and crond would help
2008-12-14T04:48:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	all the init scripts live in /etc/init.d, and are linked to from /etc/rc2.d/ (which is the default runlevel)
2008-12-14T04:48:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	that includes crond and and atd.
2008-12-14T04:49:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	thanks.. does he have to put the setuid bit on /usr/bin/crontab ? (or for at)
2008-12-14T04:50:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	i have crontab with suid on mine, so i'm guessing that means yes. :)
2008-12-14T04:50:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	ok, thanks :)
2008-12-14T04:51:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	hm, actually, it seems to be sgid, and is owned by "root:crontab". to be precise.
2008-12-14T04:52:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	yeah.. he sent me the output of ls -l, and it seems like its already been set
2008-12-14T04:52:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	he probably just have to start the daemon - is it started by default?
2008-12-14T04:52:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	whats the proper, user friendly, way to do that? system -> preferences -> services ?
2008-12-14T04:53:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	depends on how he installed it. if he installed manually from source, then probably not started, has to start manually. if installed from the repos, it would start the daemon after installing.
2008-12-14T04:53:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	why not just do a "ps ax |grep cron" and see if it's running. :)
2008-12-14T04:53:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	he did, and it doesn't :) but just wondering how i can get him to activate it
2008-12-14T04:54:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	hmm, proper user friendly way... probably "sudo invoke-rc.d crond start"
2008-12-14T04:54:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	ok - i'll tell him that
2008-12-14T04:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	ok :)
2008-12-14T04:56:00.000Z	gauteh	therealnanotube	thanks!
2008-12-14T04:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	gauteh	no prob. :)
