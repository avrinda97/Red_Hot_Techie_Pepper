2009-02-18T19:34:00.000Z	macondo		How do I prevent a certain partition from being mounted?
2009-02-18T19:35:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	remove it from fstab
2009-02-18T19:35:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	it's not in /etc/fstab because it's an external hdd,
2009-02-18T19:36:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	oh ok..it will be there when you insert the HDD...
2009-02-18T19:37:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	can I just comment them out?
2009-02-18T19:37:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	they are not in /etc/fstab
2009-02-18T19:37:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	you can do so only when they are inserted...fstab is realtime
2009-02-18T19:37:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	they are mounted, and fstab doesn't show them
2009-02-18T19:38:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	just a sec.
2009-02-18T19:44:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	why dont you unmount it as soon as it mounts :)
2009-02-18T19:45:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	btw you can do it by doing sudo /etc/init.d/autofs stop
2009-02-18T19:46:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	does that prevent each one of the partitions from being mounted?
2009-02-18T19:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	it will prevent all the partitions from being mounted...
2009-02-18T19:46:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	that's not what I want, what about my main partition?
2009-02-18T19:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	as in?
2009-02-18T19:47:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	where the OS is installed
2009-02-18T19:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	is the OS on an external cd?
2009-02-18T19:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	sorry HDD?
2009-02-18T19:47:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	no
2009-02-18T19:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	it will only be stopped for this session
2009-02-18T19:48:00.000Z	macondo	arvind_khadri	I don't what that either :)
2009-02-18T19:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macondo	you can bring it up again... replace stop with start
