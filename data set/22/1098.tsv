2012-04-11T03:08:00.000Z	Head		ubuntu will not shutdown, only log out
2012-04-11T03:08:00.000Z	Head		even after press shutdown
2012-04-11T03:08:00.000Z	Head		why only log out? WHY ?

2012-04-11T03:15:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	Ctrl+Alt+F5 turns you to a terminal. You can use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to the user interface. Linux lets you to go multiple terminals (without interface) by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F(number).
2012-04-11T03:17:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	when you say Console, what do you mean? The 'windows key' thing is not a console.
2012-04-11T03:18:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	I press the windows button indeed
2012-04-11T03:19:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	that's not how you shutdown the computer. That doesn't even work on my end either.
2012-04-11T03:19:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	Through terminal only then ?
2012-04-11T03:19:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	are you using Unity?
2012-04-11T03:20:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	what is unity?
2012-04-11T03:20:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	it is the default user interface for Ubuntu 11.04 and Ubuntu 11.10.
2012-04-11T03:20:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	i believe I am
2012-04-11T03:21:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	try clicking at the little 'gear' icon on the top right corner of your screen. The bottom option (if not, then some option) should say "Shut Down..."
2012-04-11T03:22:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	how do I address a message to you in color red?
2012-04-11T03:23:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	that's something it does automatically when someone says your name. Every time you say my name, it shows it in red for me.
2012-04-11T03:24:00.000Z	Tynach	Head	hit the Windows key, and type in 'terminal'. Open the terminal, it should be a dark purple background window with something like "user@computername:~$ ". I want you to type, without quotes: "sudo shutdown -h now". Copy and paste it if you want.
2012-04-11T03:25:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	I know this command
2012-04-11T03:25:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	it works Iá¸¿ sure of that
2012-04-11T03:26:00.000Z	Head	Tynach	;)
