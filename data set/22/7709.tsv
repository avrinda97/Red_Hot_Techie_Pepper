2006-01-18T06:03:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Hmmm
2006-01-18T06:03:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Oh yeah. I have an Nvidia card, and I'm wondering why GL screensavers run /extremely/ slow. Any ideas?
2006-01-18T06:04:00.000Z	sklav	Psi-Jack	probably cause you dont have 3d-acceleration running
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Well, I'm using the nvidia-glx driver... What else is there?
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	sklav	Psi-Jack	you need to enable it
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	OKay.. How would I do that? I'm not extremely familiar with X.org
2006-01-18T06:05:00.000Z	sklav	Psi-Jack	try sudo config-glx enable
2006-01-18T06:06:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Ahhh..
2006-01-18T06:06:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Okay
2006-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	I have nothing beginning with nvidi on my system..
2006-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	sklav	Psi-Jack	1 sec as im on gentoo now
2006-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Hehe, I see. :)
2006-01-18T06:09:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	I don't have nvidia-glx-config, though..
2006-01-18T06:09:00.000Z	sklav	Psi-Jack	do the following
2006-01-18T06:10:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Heh, wow.. nvidia-glx wasn't even installed..
2006-01-18T06:12:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Okay. BRB. Gotta restart X. :)
2006-01-18T06:17:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Much much better.. :)
2006-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	I noticed that I saw an Nvidia logo this time, after I killed kdm and it reloaded. :)
2006-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	sklav	Psi-Jack	that is a good sign
2006-01-18T06:26:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Next issue. It just crashed my system, just simply looking at OpenGL screensavers...
2006-01-18T06:27:00.000Z	sklav	Psi-Jack	word of advice not all screensavers are created equal
2006-01-18T06:27:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	sklav	Well, I was actually looking at the same screensaver, different "modes" it had, when it crashed.
