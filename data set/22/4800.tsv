2007-10-05T08:29:00.000Z	Dmitry_		greetings. i've tried installing ubuntu (feisty fawn) before, but was unsuccessful for some reason. the install aborted, but the partition was left there. then i installed ubuntu again, and it all worked well. that's what i'm using now. i just got the message informing me that the partition disk space is 100% used. i'm wondering how i can delete the other partition with semi-working ubuntu that i do not (nor intend to) use.
2007-10-05T08:29:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	you could boot up the live cd and use gparted to erase it.
2007-10-05T08:30:00.000Z	Dmitry_	shearn89	could i do it without loading it up? does ubuntu not have a partition manager that i can access at this stage?
2007-10-05T08:30:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	that would let you format it as an extra partition for storing music on or something.
2007-10-05T08:31:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	actually yes- you'd have to unmount the partition first, but if you're not using it, thats fine.
2007-10-05T08:31:00.000Z	Dmitry_		initially, i created a partition for ubuntu from windows. then ubuntu divided it further.
2007-10-05T08:31:00.000Z	Dmitry_	shearn89	i don't think it's mounted currently. could you tell me how to erase it?
2007-10-05T08:31:00.000Z	Dmitry_		i'd rather completely erase it, in comparison to just deleting files from it.
2007-10-05T08:32:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	yeah sure - hit alt-f2, and type "gparted".
2007-10-05T08:32:00.000Z	Dmitry_		Could not open location 'file:///gparted'
2007-10-05T08:32:00.000Z	shearn89		!gparted
2007-10-05T08:32:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	there you go.
2007-10-05T08:33:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	did you see the bot message?
2007-10-05T08:33:00.000Z	Dmitry_		thanks, ubotu
2007-10-05T08:33:00.000Z	Dmitry_	shearn89	yeah, sorry. got dinner. :P doing the stuff now
2007-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	Dmitry_		After unpacking 6316kB of additional disk space will be used.
2007-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	Dmitry_		i'm unsure if i have that much.
2007-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	cool.
2007-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	Dmitry_		*checks*
2007-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	shearn89	Dmitry_	6mbs?
2007-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	Dmitry_		if only i knew how to check :S
2007-10-05T08:34:00.000Z	Dmitry_	shearn89	the message told me that 100% of the disk is used.
