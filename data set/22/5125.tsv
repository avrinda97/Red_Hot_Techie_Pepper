2007-07-16T11:59:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	 that's a huge question, as you've probably found out.  Many people have had success removing the network manager, some with wifi-radar, some with doing everything from the cli.  Try being more specific and maybe someone will have some advice.
2007-07-16T12:20:00.000Z	\Ben	toryl__	sorry to single you out but you answered earlier :P i have removed network manager and put on wifi radar. but when wifi radar scans it says the same thing as if i was doing iwlist scan. it says "rausb0 - interface doesnt support scanning.
2007-07-16T12:51:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	 1. what card are you using, and  2. can you connect to the AP when you specify the values (i.e. not scanning)?
2007-07-16T14:16:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	what is the model / chipset of your nic?
2007-07-16T14:19:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	one problem I had was the encryption method I was using.  If you are using anything but WEP turn it off for diagnostic purposes.
2007-07-16T14:20:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	and even WEP, too, really.  Can you connect from the command line?
2007-07-16T14:21:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	can you connect when you specify all the AP parameters--i.e. without scanning first?
2007-07-16T14:22:00.000Z	\Ben	toryl__	i have tried with the command line and editing the interface file
2007-07-16T14:23:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	so you specify an SSID and then it doesn't show up when you do iwconfig?
2007-07-16T14:25:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	that happened to me too.  Let me see if I can find the info that helped me.
2007-07-16T14:30:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	just to make sure, you have no encryption on that router, correct?  And it is set to broadcast your ssid?
2007-07-16T14:34:00.000Z	\Ben	toryl__	it must be broadcasting its ssid as other laptops can see if when not on the network. as for security its setup with 128 wep
2007-07-16T14:35:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	 1. make sure you're setting the key with iwconfig before you're setting the SSID and 2. try connecting with WEP disabled.
2007-07-16T14:36:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	good luck
2007-07-16T15:10:00.000Z	\Ben	toryl__	took security off altogether now, when doing a sudo ifup rausb0 , it looks for DHCPOFFER but doesnt revice any. dhcp is turned on on the router
2007-07-16T15:16:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	 you can try assigning a static IP address and see how that works.
2007-07-16T15:16:00.000Z	\Ben	toryl__	just tried - stil no :(
2007-07-16T15:17:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	 when you look at the info in iwconfig does it tell you anything about the signal strength and link quality?  Like, do you think it really is connected to the AP?
2007-07-16T15:18:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	you did an ifdown and an ifup on that interface?
2007-07-16T15:19:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	one thing I've read was to remove network-manager-gnome, have you tried that?
2007-07-16T15:22:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	dunno man, I hope someone else chimes in here for you.  Mine worked after all that crap.
2007-07-16T15:22:00.000Z	toryl__	\Ben	very welcome.
