2008-05-28T09:17:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Radzero	you need to install build-essential
2008-05-28T09:20:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Radzero	I think you need libncurses5-dev for that

2008-05-28T09:24:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Radzero	the tarball for bitchx on their site hasn't been updated since 2003 or 2004
2008-05-28T09:24:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Radzero	it is, although it's console based
2008-05-28T09:25:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Radzero	regular xchat is a lot better than xchat-gnome, and you could also run mirc in wine
2008-05-28T09:35:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Radzero	you need libglib2.0-dev
2008-05-28T09:39:00.000Z	Radzero	Starnestommy	./configure worked and now when i type make this is one of the errors that come up
