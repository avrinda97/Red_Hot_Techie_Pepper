2007-04-06T10:50:00.000Z	billy	gop	oh.  um.  I'd have to look through it myself.  I usually just explore around.  maybe "fix mbr" option.
2007-04-06T10:59:00.000Z	gop	billy	 all i was able to do is get it to boot in to my windows partion
2007-04-06T10:59:00.000Z	billy	gop	you didn't see "fix MBR" option?
2007-04-06T11:00:00.000Z	gop	billy	 nope

2007-04-06T12:39:00.000Z	gop	billy	 I crossed my finger and rebooted no luck
2007-04-06T12:40:00.000Z	billy	gop	same as before?
2007-04-06T12:41:00.000Z	billy	gop	i think you need to install grub to your primary (first) hard drive.  that may be the issue.
2007-04-06T12:42:00.000Z	billy	gop	grub is your boot loader.  it needs to be on the first hard drive (yes, hd0) because that's probably what your BIOS is looking at.
