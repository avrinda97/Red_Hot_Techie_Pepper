2005-05-22T10:29:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	which app?
2005-05-22T10:32:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	so you linked python to python-2.3?
2005-05-22T10:32:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	yeah because some zope stuff was looking for /usr/bin/python directly
2005-05-22T10:32:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	why did you link and why did you install from source?
2005-05-22T10:32:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	had to install it from source because my boss told me to :)
2005-05-22T10:33:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	like HappyFool said, it's not really a good idea to break python just to install zope from source.  why not use the ubuntu package?
2005-05-22T10:33:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	yeah i guess. but i was told to use sources, so did that
2005-05-22T10:34:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	why?
2005-05-22T10:34:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	not sure. when i started work they said install zope,postgres,psycopg etc from sources
2005-05-22T10:35:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	HappyFool i've un-broken python now :) i'll play with the zope stuff
2005-05-22T10:36:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	does zope need a particular python version?
2005-05-22T10:36:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	2.3
2005-05-22T10:36:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	2.4 won't work?
2005-05-22T10:37:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	well, not zope directly, but at work we use psycopg as a database adapter between zope and postgres, and psycopg DOES require 2.3
2005-05-22T10:39:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	that's unfortunate; anything that works in 2.3 should work in 2.4 AFAIK unless you're using deprecated functions.
2005-05-22T10:39:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	not sure what psycopg is doing tbh, i'm not a very good developer yet ;)
2005-05-22T10:39:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	me either. :P
2005-05-22T10:40:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	hehe
2005-05-22T10:40:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	i went there for a job in tech support, but because my main interest is software and mockups and stuff they offered me a developer job. i'm still trying to get to grips with it
2005-05-22T10:44:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	it needs 2.3 because of the compiled C modules, just for the record.
2005-05-22T10:48:00.000Z	andrewski	appleseed	http://initd.org/projects/psycopg2 ... uses 2.4
2005-05-22T10:48:00.000Z	appleseed	andrewski	cool thanks. i'll take a look
