2009-09-02T20:46:00.000Z	jez		for some reason I can't get my SMB share to work on Ubuntu
2009-09-02T20:46:00.000Z	jez		i have right-clicked my folder, and done 'sharing options', clicked to share the folder and given it a name
2009-09-02T20:47:00.000Z	jez		from my windows box which is connected to the Ubuntu box though, i can't access the share, i just get no response
2009-09-02T20:47:00.000Z	jez		any idea what could be wrong?
2009-09-02T20:47:00.000Z	jez		i can ping the box
2009-09-02T20:48:00.000Z	jez		i did samba
2009-09-02T20:48:00.000Z	jez		although it's not on the graphical add/remove apps
2009-09-02T20:48:00.000Z	jez		I ran sudo apt-get install samba
2009-09-02T20:48:00.000Z	genii	jez	So the result of: apt-cache policy samba                 shows 100% it is installed?
2009-09-02T20:49:00.000Z	jez		it comes up with some stuff, how do i know whether it's 100% installed? :-)
2009-09-02T20:50:00.000Z	jez		samba: installed: 2:3.3.2-1ubuntu3.1
2009-09-02T20:50:00.000Z	genii	jez	A line like: *** 2:3.4.0-3ubuntu1 0     with the asterisks means it is installed
2009-09-02T20:50:00.000Z	jez		yeah it seems to be
2009-09-02T20:50:00.000Z	jez		2:3.3.2-1
2009-09-02T20:51:00.000Z	genii	jez	Is the server running? eg:  ps aux | grep smb        shows something
2009-09-02T20:52:00.000Z	jez		yes
2009-09-02T20:53:00.000Z	jez		ahh
2009-09-02T20:53:00.000Z	jez		looks like i had to allow the service in Firestarter
2009-09-02T20:53:00.000Z	jez		heh
2009-09-02T20:54:00.000Z	genii	jez	Have you added Samba users? On CLI is usually something like:  sudo smbpasswd -a username && sudo smbpasswd -e username         (add then enable). a restart of samba after this is also required with something like sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2009-09-02T20:54:00.000Z	jez	genii	is there a gui way to add samba users?
2009-09-02T20:54:00.000Z	genii	jez	There is, but offhand I don't know because I'm primary CLI
