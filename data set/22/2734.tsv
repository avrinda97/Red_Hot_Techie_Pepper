2009-06-26T17:33:00.000Z	chevdor		does someone knwo how to get the argument of an 'options' that is retreived with getopts. I am writting a script to duplicate commands so that it does the same command (usually mv commands) on my drive and on the mirrored copy (the goal is to avoid spending hours with rsync whereas the data has been just moved). The script would do this : 'dbl -t1:/mnt/blabla -t2:/media/stuff/ mv fileA fileB'. And I want the mv to apply on both location.
2009-06-26T17:33:00.000Z	chevdor		I am trying to figure out a way to check and retreive the options -t1, -t2 etc, that works, but I don't know how to get the value of an option, ie /mnt/blabla for -t1.
2009-06-26T17:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	as far as i recall rsync has an option so that you dont have to copy everything again, but wich makes hardlinks for  dupplicates, also can really recommend rsnapshot which basically uses rsync and is way easier to configure
2009-06-26T17:36:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	ah ok, thanks for the hint, I'll check it out.
2009-06-26T17:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	my pleasure:)
2009-06-26T17:37:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	the point here is that I move big folders of data and rsync sees it as gone on one side and new on the other. Using the options to remove whatis gone, I can sync the tree but it takes time... i am checking out your sugestion
2009-06-26T17:38:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	i am not sure if i understand what you are actually trying to achieve?
2009-06-26T17:40:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	my explanation may not be very since, let me try again. I rsync a big folder from my disk to a remote location. This is done, I have about 300gb of data.
2009-06-26T17:40:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	now I am 'cleaning' up my disk, ie I am moving folders, renaming folders and so one.
2009-06-26T17:41:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	to avoid a big rsync, i want to apply the SAME commands on my remote copy, thus the script I am writting
2009-06-26T17:41:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	so why wouldnt you rename them BEFORE moving them?
2009-06-26T17:42:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	or do you mean you are keeping that folder in synchronicity on a remote location with the help of rsync?
2009-06-26T17:42:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	rename/move, that's the same ! the point is to do the same on the local folder and the remote one, this is just for now, later on, I can keep using rsync, or better, the rsnapshot your recommended (i used to use backup2l)
2009-06-26T17:42:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	exactly
2009-06-26T17:43:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	right now I am moving data inside the local folder and I want to do the same on the remote one
2009-06-26T17:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	ok i thik i am slowly starting to understand, but i am afraid i cannot really help you with that...
2009-06-26T17:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	BUT i got another one for you: have a try in #bash there is the right place to ask this;)
2009-06-26T17:45:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	you already did, I did not know rsnapshot and that sounds a very compromise between my former backup2l solution (that was a bit painful) and the current where I 'just' use rsync
2009-06-26T17:45:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	hmmmm sounds wise too :) you r the man :))))
2009-06-26T17:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	haha np man:)
2009-06-26T17:47:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	chevdor	well rsnapshot is really smooth and reliable and the documentation on their page is really eazy to understand
2009-06-26T17:53:00.000Z	chevdor	remoteCTRL1	sounds good
