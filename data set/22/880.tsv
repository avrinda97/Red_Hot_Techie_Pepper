2012-08-23T01:21:00.000Z	k1l	usr13	ubuntu aitn using gdm anymore. why suggesting that?
2012-08-23T01:22:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	I dono, lost my head I guess  :)

2012-09-06T11:53:00.000Z	k1l	usr13	ok. so you need a ppa for it. this is not a build in command setting. fuzzylumpkins see the link from usr13  above
2012-09-06T12:05:00.000Z	k1l	usr13	if the x is not loading and putting him into the konsol it wount help
2012-09-06T12:06:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	I don't think that is the problem.  Not sure but...
2012-09-06T12:08:00.000Z	k1l	usr13	just installing another desktop seems not like a real solution to me
2012-09-06T12:22:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	Could it be?:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/963633
2012-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	k1l	usr13	i thought unity --reset didtn work?
2012-09-06T12:25:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	It says:  gconftool-2 -recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1  #and then:  unity --reset  #and if that doesn't work:   cd ~; rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .metacity .compiz-1 .config/compiz-1 .config/dconf
2012-09-06T12:25:00.000Z	k1l	usr13	well, its a chance
2012-09-06T12:29:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	It appears that  unity --reset  doesn't always work and  cd ~; rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .metacity .compiz-1 .config/compiz-1 .config/dconf is just a way to do it manually.
2012-09-06T12:30:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	In other words, just remove all of those directories and files from the /home dir
2012-09-06T12:47:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	I found this:  http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1921908.html  #FYI....
2012-09-06T12:49:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	Interesting comment: "Quite possible you have some local config files that aren't kosher - one way to tell is create a new user & see it it can get a good login to unity-3d"  and "No harm in deleting ~/.config/compiz-1 & ~/.cache/compizconfig"
2012-11-28T20:30:00.000Z	k1l	usr13	right you _can_ . but if you should and should ruin your rights settings in ~ is the other question. most user are fine with sudo
2012-11-28T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	Well, you can switch to a root shell in Ubuntu.
2012-11-28T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	... or su
2012-11-28T20:33:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	You won't ruing your settings.
2012-11-28T20:34:00.000Z	usr13	k1l	You can ruin just as much with sudo  ;0
