2008-12-31T19:56:00.000Z	mrbean		hello
2008-12-31T19:57:00.000Z	mrbean		I've got a pretty serious problem with Evolution
2008-12-31T19:57:00.000Z	mrbean		as of yesterday, it has completely "forgot" my account, and goes to the setup screen when I start it
2008-12-31T19:58:00.000Z	blazzy	mrbean	i'd recommend another email client, unless you need some kind of evolution specific feature
2008-12-31T19:59:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	I'd like to continue using it just out of preference (I've been using it for 4 years)
2008-12-31T19:59:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	if all else fails I'll import my mail saves into Thunderbird, but I do want to figure out why this happened
2008-12-31T20:00:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	also, if I try to restore my emails from a backup file (though they are still in ~/.evolution), it just resets to the setup screen again
2008-12-31T20:01:00.000Z	blazzy	mrbean	did you do an upgrade recently?
2008-12-31T20:02:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	last update was probably like 2 days ago, yeah
2008-12-31T20:02:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	think it's a problem with the latest version?
2008-12-31T20:06:00.000Z	blazzy	mrbean	I'm stabbing in the dark :) I was actually hoping an update would magically fix your problems. nothing stands out when I skim this https://bugs.launchpad.net/evolution/+bugs
2008-12-31T20:06:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	yes, I know...I should have mentioned I checked Launchpad already
2008-12-31T20:07:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	when I start it on the terminal, I get:
2008-12-31T20:07:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	evolution-shell-Message: Killing old version of evolution-data server
2008-12-31T20:08:00.000Z	blazzy	mrbean	do you see a process like that running?
2008-12-31T20:08:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	(evolution:8596): DEBUG: mailto URL command: evolution %s
2008-12-31T20:09:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	I mean I see that output to terminal, but yeah the evolution process runs
2008-12-31T20:10:00.000Z	blazzy	mrbean	try a "pkill -9 evolution" wait a few seconds and then launch evolution
2008-12-31T20:11:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	mrbean: tried that, no dice...I've also restarted several times and reinstalled the relevant packages
2008-12-31T20:15:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	any clues?
2008-12-31T20:16:00.000Z	blazzy	mrbean	nope I'm pretty stumped. it might be time for a new launchpad submission.
2008-12-31T20:17:00.000Z	mrbean	blazzy	OK, I kind of thought so at this point, thanks for the help though
