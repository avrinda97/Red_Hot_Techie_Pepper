2011-09-09T13:40:00.000Z	Bash		Still can't get my seperate ubuntu drive to show up, right after boot it just sits at a blinking cursor.
2011-09-09T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	what video chip do you use?
2011-09-09T13:41:00.000Z	Bash		Pretty certain I've done the grub install right, is it a major problem if a windows partition preceeds the grub drive?
2011-09-09T13:41:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	Oh sorry, meant that grub doesn't initialize.
2011-09-09T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	if you hold shift at boot do you see grub?
2011-09-09T13:42:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	Nope.
2011-09-09T13:42:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	It's as if it finds nothing when it tries to boot from ANY drive.
2011-09-09T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	then boot to liveCD and reinstate grub
2011-09-09T13:43:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	I've done that now, tried different settings in which partition to flag for boot etc,
2011-09-09T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	the boot flag is irrelevant
2011-09-09T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	grub config is loaded and uses the config there, only windows uses boot flags
2011-09-09T13:44:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	I have windows7 on sda, sdc1 is windows (non-boot), sdc2 is ubuntu (with grub) and sdc3 is swap,
2011-09-09T13:45:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	I have installed grub onto sdc2, pointed it to boot from sdc
2011-09-09T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	is the drive which is sdc set as boot drive in BIOS?
2011-09-09T13:45:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	Yup. I even tried booting every different drive, all are the same with the empty blinking cursor.
2011-09-09T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	if you start liveCD booting then select to boot the internal drive, does it boot ok?
2011-09-09T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	ok, what is the video chip you use?
2011-09-09T13:46:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	Nope, it flashes for just a second but just goes away.
2011-09-09T13:47:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	ati
2011-09-09T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bash	tried chrooting and adding boot options to use safe vga etc? May stop the blinking cursor bit
2011-09-09T13:48:00.000Z	Bash		I can get into ubuntu on the flash drive no problem, full resolution and working fine, just wont boot.
2011-09-09T13:48:00.000Z	Bash	ActionParsnip	It's more just a blank stop, it won't think or read the drive or anything
