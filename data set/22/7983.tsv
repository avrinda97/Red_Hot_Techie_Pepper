2005-11-10T08:45:00.000Z	gcj		nick: how would you know what's child sensitive? we haven't invented a working pr0n filter yet
2005-11-10T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	it's his call on what he calls 'child sensitive', not mine :)
2005-11-10T09:06:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	wickedpuppy, it does work
2005-11-10T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	I've added a bit to restricted formats, I know :)
2005-11-10T09:07:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	added a bit?
2005-11-10T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	about gstreamer0.8, and how to get all the plugins
2005-11-10T09:08:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	ok, thanks, i hit that problem when i started with ubuntu and i couldn't find any info about it
2005-11-10T09:08:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	rhythmbox errors are cryptic too
2005-11-10T09:08:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	yeah, and who expects -mad to get mp3 support?
2005-11-10T09:08:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	where did u add that info?
2005-11-10T09:08:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	exactly :-(
2005-11-10T09:09:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	especially as rhythmbox is installed by default (but almost useless without mp3 support)
2005-11-10T09:10:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	shouldn't rhythmbox "recommend" those packages?
2005-11-10T09:10:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	enable universe, multiverse, and apt-get install gstreamer0.8-plugins gstreamer0.8-plugins-multiverse
2005-11-10T09:11:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	could be, I'm not apt enabled enough to know if that's a problem if universe and multverse are not enabled
2005-11-10T09:12:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	i don't think it's a problem because recommends != requires
2005-11-10T09:12:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	it just makes it easier to know what packages u should install
2005-11-10T09:12:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	or perhaps some descriptive text in the package info?
2005-11-10T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	that is the essence of the problem with all the non free stuff. How to recommend without potential liability. wiki vs actual dependencies, and I'm not qualified to speak on that
2005-11-10T09:14:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	ianal but my guess is that only using a patented algorithm is illegal, not making it available or telling people they can/should use it
2005-11-10T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	gcj	debian-legal is an interesting archive to browse ;)
2005-11-10T09:15:00.000Z	gcj	nickrud	if i had a few years :-)
