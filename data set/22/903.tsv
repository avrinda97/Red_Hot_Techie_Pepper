2012-02-10T14:51:00.000Z	Grievre		okay but I already know how to view logs in terminal, you are helping me with a problem that I do not have
2012-02-10T14:51:00.000Z	Grievre		nothing appears in the logs when the mouse freezes
2012-02-10T14:51:00.000Z	Grievre		I purged and reinstalled compiz that might have fixed it
