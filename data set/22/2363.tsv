2009-07-08T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	Please pastebin the output of `sudo apt-get update`
2009-07-08T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	There won't be no output.  If there's no output, something is wrong.
2009-07-08T10:54:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	Please pastebin the output
2009-07-08T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	and it's http://ports.ubuntu.com/ not http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
2009-07-08T10:57:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	You're using LPIA, which has a different mirror. Let me find you the URL
2009-07-08T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	you need to change the places in there that are http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ change it to http://ports.ubuntu.com/
2009-07-08T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	So, line 2,3, 5, 6, 10,11
2009-07-08T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	Sorry, change the security.ubuntu.com to ports.ubuntu.com too.
2009-07-08T11:06:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	Please mind your language
2009-07-08T11:19:00.000Z	rjmoore	Flannel	i got one more for you...
2009-07-08T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	No, read the wikipage and it'll tell you how to activate it
2009-07-08T13:30:00.000Z	Flannel	rjmoore	Odd.  it didn't always.  Luckily, the troubleshooting section describes (effectively) how to create a swap partition (except for the partitioning itself)
