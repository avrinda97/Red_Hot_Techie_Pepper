2005-06-10T14:57:00.000Z	jeroen_	katie	you can install it with synaptic package manager
2005-06-10T14:58:00.000Z	jeroen_	katie	the next version of amsn will have it
2005-06-10T14:59:00.000Z	jeroen_	katie	I have downloaded a test version (but it doesn't really work very well, because it's not finished yet) of amsn, and it has webcam support
2005-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	jeroen_	katie	because it's lame?
2005-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	jeroen_	katie	it wants your password, emailaddress, socail security number, etc I think

2005-06-10T15:13:00.000Z	jeroen_	katie	depends on file size and connection speed
