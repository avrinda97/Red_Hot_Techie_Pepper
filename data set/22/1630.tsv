2010-03-17T20:05:00.000Z	underdev	sinistrad	it says it's sent, but it hung for a while and the email hasn't arrived yet
2010-03-17T20:07:00.000Z	sinistrad	underdev	 it may take a while depending on your email host. mine was instant through gmail
2010-03-17T20:10:00.000Z	underdev	sinistrad	yahoo webmail is usually pretty good in the immediate gratification area...
2010-03-17T20:10:00.000Z	sinistrad	underdev	Yes, yahoo should be nearly instant as well
2010-03-17T20:18:00.000Z	sinistrad	underdev	if you have problems out of ubuntuone, check out #ubuntuone, I wasn't able to get anyone in there to answer at 3AM, but they might be awake now
