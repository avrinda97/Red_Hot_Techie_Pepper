2009-07-03T22:49:00.000Z	JohnnyZero		I am having a hardware issue. My CD Burner won't burn any CDs.
2009-07-03T22:51:00.000Z	JohnnyZero		Well, I have an Optiarc drive
2009-07-03T22:53:00.000Z	JohnnyZero		It is an Optiarc DVD RE AD-7190S I tried to burn on a couple of CDs and it basically says the disc is not empty
2009-07-03T22:53:00.000Z	JohnnyZero		But I know it is
2009-07-03T22:53:00.000Z	JohnnyZero		Says the disc is not writeable
2009-07-03T22:54:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Are you sure the media is good?
2009-07-03T22:55:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	What CD burning software are you using?
2009-07-03T22:55:00.000Z	JohnnyZero	usr13	I tried two discs already
2009-07-03T22:56:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Must be hardware issue.
2009-07-03T22:56:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	I use k3b and dono how it could be easier.
2009-07-03T22:57:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Check the data cable.
2009-07-03T22:58:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Replace data cable.
2009-07-03T22:58:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Any other CDs?  Other than what?
2009-07-03T22:59:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	What does k3b say?
2009-07-03T22:59:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Are they CDs or DVDs?
2009-07-03T23:01:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	cdrecord scambis
2009-07-03T23:02:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Pastebin the output of:  cdrecord scambis
2009-07-03T23:07:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Could be that you have a bad batch of CDs  (I threw away about 20 or 25 one time because I got about half way through a 50 CD batch and found several that wouldnt burn.
2009-07-03T23:08:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	I bought a new batch and the worked so I just threw away the old ones.)
2009-07-03T23:11:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	See lines 93-98  at  http://pastebin.com/d2b55ba6
2009-07-03T23:15:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Try media from different batch.
2009-07-03T23:18:00.000Z	usr13	JohnnyZero	Use miniCD
