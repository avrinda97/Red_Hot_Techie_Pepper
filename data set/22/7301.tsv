2006-11-05T15:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	what is wrong with it
2006-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	when I try to modprobe ndiswrapper, I get an fatal error inserting the module
2006-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	can i have full error?
2006-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Invalid argument
2006-11-05T16:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	do you have the restricte modules package installed?
2006-11-05T16:01:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	I think so, let me check
2006-11-05T16:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	and what version
2006-11-05T16:01:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	Idefinately did when I was in dapper
2006-11-05T16:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	new kernel new l-r-m package
2006-11-05T16:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	are you using unofficial repos by chance?
2006-11-05T16:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	or nvidia-beta drivers?
2006-11-05T16:03:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	I haven't added any repos manually, I used the gui, and then did an apt-get dist-upgrade, also Im trying to use the ATI closed drivers for 3D.
2006-11-05T16:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	ati drivers from ati.com?
2006-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	I have restricted-386.  I just installed restricted-generic, and yes, drivers from ati.com, but the installer doesn't work anymore after the upgrade
2006-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	Ill brb, after doing the restricted-generic the system wants me to reboot
2006-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	did the installer for the ati drivers build its own restricted modules package by chance?
2006-11-05T16:04:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	now that I have no idea
2006-11-05T16:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sess	reinstall restricted modules package ill be back after dinner
2006-11-05T16:05:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	 ok
2006-11-06T17:20:00.000Z	sess	gnomefreak	 I managed to somewhat fix most of the issues I've been having, but I need help getting my 3D accel back.  I finally got ati-installer to build the edgy fglrx module.  I set it to my driver and startx.  but glxinfo returns indirect rendering still.  what is wrong here
