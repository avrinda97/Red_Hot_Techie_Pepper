2007-06-28T05:03:00.000Z	b0ha		im new to ubuntu and i want to install LAMP
2007-06-28T05:03:00.000Z	b0ha		is there any guide or something
2007-06-28T05:04:00.000Z	b0ha		thank you magnetron
2007-06-28T05:04:00.000Z	b0ha		oh and 1 more question
2007-06-28T05:05:00.000Z	b0ha		is it possibile to upgrade from dapper drake 6.06 to 7.04?
2007-06-28T05:05:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	update to 6.10 "edgy" first
2007-06-28T05:06:00.000Z	b0ha	scorp123	 how? is there a terminal command?
2007-07-01T13:58:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	now that was a strange question :-)
2007-07-01T13:59:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	aaaah, I get it. I take back what I said + I apologize, just forget it.
2007-07-01T13:59:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	yes I get it. Sooooorrry :-)
2007-07-08T16:52:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	maybe it would help if you read a MySQL tutorial first? Messing around with databases requires some minimum knowledge that one should have ....
2007-07-08T16:53:00.000Z	b0ha	scorp123	i know basic things
2007-07-08T16:53:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	apparently not or else you wouldn't ask such basic things ... sorry to say so.
2007-07-08T16:55:00.000Z	b0ha	scorp123	like i said i used phpmyadmin to create and edit databases and the php to comunicate with mysql
2007-07-08T16:56:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	so you're still missing very basic knowledge. phpmyadmin doesn't qualify as 'knowledge'.
2007-07-08T16:56:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	you should read a tutorial about some SQL commands
2007-07-08T16:57:00.000Z	b0ha	scorp123	 i will look for some tutorials :) tnx
2007-07-08T16:57:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	MySQL.com has good forums and some tutorials as PDF's if I remember right. Start there.
2007-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	still here?
2007-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	b0ha	scorp123	yes
2007-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	scorp123	b0ha	.... just a sec ....
