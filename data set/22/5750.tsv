2008-04-17T14:41:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	I already asked the question.  I was trying to politely ask it again.
2008-04-17T14:42:00.000Z	Crazytom		Can anyone help me get a brother mfc-685cw connected via wifi
2008-04-17T14:48:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	do you already have a net connection to the brother. f.e. can you ping it?
2008-04-17T14:56:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	yes i can ping it.  Thanks
2008-04-17T14:57:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	ok, now: system -> administration -> printing
2008-04-17T14:58:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	there.
2008-04-17T14:59:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	ok, i am following the information from http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/cups_network.html . however: the ubuntu program you are now in is a different frontend. the core still works the same. this means: now: click on the new printer icon.
2008-04-17T15:01:00.000Z	Crazytom		ok
2008-04-17T15:01:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	done
2008-04-17T15:02:00.000Z	gregory		it didnt find a printer automatically i guess. so you select "LPD/LPR Host or Printer" from "Devices". If you cant find it its my fault, because i am on the beta for next release now.
2008-04-17T15:03:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	it found the printer, but i wants to know what kind it is but it's not listed
2008-04-17T15:03:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	you mean it lists a bunch of brothers but not yours?
2008-04-17T15:06:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	that's correct
2008-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	i tried to print a test page and the printer says receiving data but it's not doing anything.  (couple of minutes)
2008-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	then you need a PPD file of your printer. it seems to a fairly new one on the market, so ubuntu doesnt have it by default yet. can i ask you to search for the ppd file on the brother website and then check back?
2008-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	Crazytom		sure
2008-04-17T15:29:00.000Z	Crazytom	gregory	no dice
2008-04-17T15:29:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	ok
2008-04-17T15:30:00.000Z	Crazytom		I need to find a copy of brmfc685cw.ppd
2008-04-17T15:40:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	the file should be inside this archive, download it, do not install it, but use "mc" (sudo apt-get install mc) on the commandline to have a peek into the archive http://www.brother.com/cgi-bin/agreement/agreement.cgi?dlfile=http://solutions.brother.com/Library/sol/printer/linux/rpmfiles/lpr_debian/mfc685cwlpr-1.0.1-1.i386.deb&lang=English_lpr
2008-04-17T15:44:00.000Z	gregory	Crazytom	hmm, theres no PPD inside. still the package is the software you should use. its worth installing it, though this package was not packaged for ubuntu specifically
