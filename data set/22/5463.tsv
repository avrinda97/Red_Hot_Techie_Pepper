2009-11-16T06:14:00.000Z	rahmen		In openoffice, is there any safety copies made during editing of a file? Somehow the document I was writing on didn't save itself although I clicked save. And now I've closed it and the new text is gone.
2009-11-16T06:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	Are you sure you aren't just looking in the wrong directory? ( you might have saved the newer versions somewhere else )
2009-11-16T06:15:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	I'm very sure.. if it was another document it should be in recent docs and it isn't..
2009-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	You don't know if changes in documents are logged or something? Maybe if there's a program that can scan my memory for the text?
2009-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	Have you closed Open Office since you were working on the most up to date version?
2009-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	No I haven't.. I was wondering if I should force quit it?
2009-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	NO
2009-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	would this work? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery
2009-11-16T06:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	There is something you should try first
2009-11-16T06:31:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	oki.. I'm listening
2009-11-16T06:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	In a terminal run "lsof | grep office"
2009-11-16T06:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	That should show all files currently opened by open office
2009-11-16T06:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	"lsof | grep office | grep odt" should show only otd documents that are open
2009-11-16T06:34:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	Yeah I can see the file.. but the problem is that I opened it again after the close.. so it's prolly just the old version..?
2009-11-16T06:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	If you only see one then yes, it's whatever version you currently have
2009-11-16T06:37:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	So I'm toasted? I really need that file..
2009-11-16T06:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	At this point it will probably take less time to just re-do it
2009-11-16T06:39:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	It's my exam work I've been writing on for the whole day.. are you sure it'll take that long?
2009-11-16T06:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	If you haven't found it by now
2009-11-16T06:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	At least re-writing it you have an idea of when it will be done, you could waste a day and be no closer trying to recover what you lost
2009-11-16T06:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rahmen	Sorry, I have to leave. Good luck
2009-11-16T06:41:00.000Z	rahmen	Jordan_U	=/ well thanks for at least trying...
