2008-05-12T05:58:00.000Z	paito		hi, i need to install an epson cx5600 scanner, can somebody help me?
2008-05-12T05:59:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	use the webrowser and localhost 631
2008-05-12T05:59:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	use the webrowser and localhost:631
2008-05-12T05:59:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	i beg your pardon?
2008-05-12T06:00:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	wow
2008-05-12T06:00:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	use the webrowser http://localhost:631/
2008-05-12T06:01:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	ok, but i dont find any scanner option.
2008-05-12T06:02:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	well you should go to your vendors webssite check support and see if they support linux with scanner also try googleing
2008-05-12T06:02:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	i tried google, but the driver package is in rpm and i need it in .deb
2008-05-12T06:03:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	i tried to converti it with alien, but it looks like it doesn't work in 64bits
2008-05-12T06:03:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	hmm well you might be able to use alien and convert to .deb dunno, if so use the -s option with alien
2008-05-12T06:04:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	that is probably so. 64bit operating systems dont have much support for stuff
2008-05-12T06:04:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	use 32bit
2008-05-12T06:04:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	yeah right, let me return my 64bits laptop xD
2008-05-12T06:05:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	no, you miss understand, use the 32bit version of ubuntu
2008-05-12T06:06:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	using 32bits for a 64bits architecture? =/
2008-05-12T06:06:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	that is what i am doing right now
2008-05-12T06:06:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	not much gain with 64bit at this point in time
2008-05-12T06:06:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	pros & cons?
2008-05-12T06:07:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	basically compatibilty, but if you are doing a server they say its a good thing but i have used 32bit for both, i just had too many bugs with 64bit
2008-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	wirechief_	paito	 and printer drivers is one of the issues
2008-05-12T06:08:00.000Z	paito	wirechief_	ok... iÄºl keep looking
