2010-10-30T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	con-man	sure but if you rename an rpm to .deb and ask file what it is, it will tell you its the same type of file as when it was named .rpm
2010-10-30T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	con-man	same with images
2010-10-30T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	con-man	yes rpm are differenmt but the difference is not just the file extension, they are meaningless. Like those people who think bash scripts need to end in .shwhen they dont
