2010-02-07T00:55:00.000Z	mmann		oxymoron yup
2010-02-07T00:56:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Good, how do you make webcam work with SKype?
2010-02-07T00:56:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	is your webcam working properly in another program?
2010-02-07T00:58:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Some of them. I am able to use /dev/raw1394 in for instance Kino and if I use command "dv4lstart Skype" I am able to get it working, but I do not wanna use temrinal everytime I start Skype ... It seems vloopback for /dev/video0 does not recognize my DV-camera.
2010-02-07T00:59:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Kino works out of the box, aMSN I could get it working. Kopete, Cheese and Camorama does not work at least not last time i tried.
2010-02-07T00:59:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	aMSN doesn't work for me:P eee let me see your problem
2010-02-07T01:00:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	What do you mean "let me see"?
2010-02-07T01:01:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	did you try configurating the webcam straight from skype options?
2010-02-07T01:01:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	ANyhow, dmesg shows that it recognize my DV-cam through firewire and creates a node and initialize /dev/raw1394 but this seems like an application issue and not Linux one :P
2010-02-07T01:02:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	but have you tried configurating straigt from skype?
2010-02-07T01:02:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Yes, it only show vloopback soruce 0 /dev/video0 as only choice if i Start SKype normally. But if I start with dv4lstart I can connect thrue DV4lstart to 1394 or whatever the flow calls :P
2010-02-07T01:02:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Yes, I cannot choose anything inside Skype, there is only one source available
2010-02-07T01:02:00.000Z	mmann		oxymoron mmmm
2010-02-07T01:03:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	I have been trying to use USB but does then I can only get the sound and not video :D
2010-02-07T01:04:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	look, i dont know exactly how can i fix the problem straight, but i can give you a suggestion, why dot you make a bash file, that first runs the webcam and then skype, so you just click once and it does it all for itselfe
2010-02-07T01:04:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Seems like an incompability in Dv4l or in someway unsupported or cannot be initialized thrue the application :P I know they have been struggling around with webcams overall and still they do not work properly in the IM-clients :P
2010-02-07T01:05:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	I do not know how to create the bash-file, or I know how to create one, but do not know what code I should put inside there except the top one to make it executable :P
2010-02-07T01:06:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	but you said you are runing the webcam witn something right?
2010-02-07T01:07:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	then you just put skype and thats it
2010-02-07T01:07:00.000Z	mmann	oxymoron	in a new line
2010-02-07T01:08:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Yeah, I guess I just put dv4lstart skype but seems quite bad because it does not solve the issue in the other apps. When i Fix problem I want to go straight to the core problem and solve it permantly or else I will in the end have a lot of crappy hacks everywhere :D
2010-02-07T01:09:00.000Z	oxymoron	mmann	Its like the sound, sometimes the devlopers "f*ck it up" and it does not work at all in the core or somewhere my knowledge how to fix it is not possible :P
