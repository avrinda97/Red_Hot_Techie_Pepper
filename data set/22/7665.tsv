2006-01-27T06:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Anyone know why I would only be getting 90 FPS with the ati driver (I've tried both the repos one and from their site), with Radeon X300?
2006-01-27T06:20:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	90 fps in what?
2006-01-27T06:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	As reported by xscreensaver.
2006-01-27T06:21:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	try doing glxgears -printfps
2006-01-27T06:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	Interesting.  That says its way higher.
2006-01-27T06:22:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	what does it say?
2006-01-27T06:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	While the gears window is up, 1680.  When minimized and just working with XChat, 6900.
2006-01-27T06:24:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	I dont see anything wrong with that
2006-01-27T06:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	Not at all.  So what might be the issue with the screensavers?
2006-01-27T06:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	(Which run way slow if I try to preview them while glxgears is up.)
2006-01-27T06:26:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	which screensavers are you trying to do?
2006-01-27T06:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	They seem to all be unhappy.
2006-01-27T06:27:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	hmm...
2006-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	I'm not sure...but we know that it's not a problem with your graphics card
2006-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	but it might be a problem with your graphics card and xscreensaver
2006-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	If I close glxgears they get a lot better, but the GL ones are still slower.
2006-01-27T06:29:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	Well your graphics card isn't THE best card...
2006-01-27T06:30:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	that might be the problem
2006-01-27T06:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	True.  I guess I'll have to live with that.
2006-01-27T06:30:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	but there may be a problem with the xscreensaver
2006-01-27T06:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	walla	Is there something I should do about it?
2006-01-27T06:32:00.000Z	walla	tonyyarusso	I'm assuming you have the drivers installed?
