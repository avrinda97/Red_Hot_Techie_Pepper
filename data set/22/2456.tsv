2011-05-30T18:13:00.000Z	gabriel_1980		do I need to load an older version of the driver? I had no problem in ubuntu 10.10
2011-05-30T18:14:00.000Z	gabriel_1980		11.04
2011-05-30T18:15:00.000Z	gabriel_1980		Can I send the dmesg as a pastebin?
2011-05-30T18:16:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	I'll take a look at it.  What is the issue?
2011-05-30T18:20:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	What issue are you having?
2011-05-30T18:23:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	hello?
2011-05-30T18:24:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	Are you talking about that silly 'hardware drivers' GUI.  It is buggy and has confusing output.  Here are some CLI tools that will make things easier for you.  lsmod lists all the modules currently being used.  (driver is a module) you can do lsmod | grep 'nvidia' to see if the nividia driver is being used.
2011-05-30T18:25:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	The nvidia cards give you two options for modules/drivers.  nouveau and nvidia (there are a couple versions of nvidia).  lspci -k will list all devices and the drivers they're currently using
2011-05-30T18:26:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	Which driver are you using right now?
2011-05-30T18:26:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	Using lsmod / lspci -k    don't tell me what 'hardware drivers' is saying.
2011-05-30T18:27:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	BTW, I see no errors in your dmesg.  It indicates the nvidia module was loaded but I'm more interested in what lspci and lsmod say about it
2011-05-30T18:27:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	What card do you have?
2011-05-30T18:29:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	Here is a list of all the different packages that contain nvidia drivers in the 11.04 repos.  I'm not really up to date on which works for which card or the differences between all of them.  Basically I suggest that you try out these different drivers, confirm that each is being used using lspci -k / lsmod and see which works best.
2011-05-30T18:29:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	lspci -k  please :)
2011-05-30T18:30:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	lspci -k
2011-05-30T18:30:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	All I can see there is what hardware you have.  You do indeed have a GeForce FX Go5200
2011-05-30T18:31:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	Thanks
2011-05-30T18:32:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	See under your graphics card?  You are currently using nvidia.  You have currently installed 'nvidia, nvidia-173, nouveau, and nvidiafb'  Do you see that?
2011-05-30T18:32:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	What do you mean 'fix' ?
2011-05-30T18:33:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	Try different drivers.
2011-05-30T18:35:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	The easiest way to force the system to use one driver is to have only 1 installed at a time.  So yes, remove the ones you don't want to test right now.
2011-05-30T18:36:00.000Z	edbian	gabriel_1980	sure
