2008-01-27T04:26:00.000Z	techgeek40		I could really use some help on this - I am TOTALLY lost on this
2008-01-27T04:26:00.000Z	techgeek40		I have an Nvidia 5200 Geforce FX PCI graphics card and simply cannot get it to work under Gutsy - please, any help?
2008-01-27T04:27:00.000Z	techgeek40		I installed the drivers - at least I think I did - put the card in - rebooted and it sits at the screen loading scripts (/etc/rc.local) ]OK] and I have to do ALT+F2 to get to a command prompt to put in my user name and password - but I get no "desktop" it's all command lines
2008-01-27T04:28:00.000Z	techgeek40		I know the card works for on this computer I have triple boot - XP - Vista - Ubunt and the card works with XP and Vista just fine
2008-01-27T04:29:00.000Z	techgeek40		Wolferine: sorry I just saw the msg about using !tab - whatever that means
2008-01-27T04:29:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	what does cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log |grep (EE) show?
2008-01-27T04:31:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	remove the ()
2008-01-27T04:32:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	what method did you use to install the drivers?
2008-01-27T04:34:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	my guess is you didnt install the legacy drivers so it isnt working, I think your card needs the legacy drivers
2008-01-27T04:36:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	use dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and try to follow the instructions after that run /etc/init.d/gdm restart to get on a graphical environment and then use the restricted drivers tool to install the driver
2008-01-27T04:37:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	no go to Administration -> Restricted Drivers Manager from the System menu
2008-01-27T04:38:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	after you get to the graphical environment
2008-01-27T04:43:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	go to System menu then Administration then Restricted Drivers Manager and tick the enable driver
2008-01-27T04:44:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	what does lsmod |grep nvidia show?
2008-01-27T04:52:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	the only solution I can think of, since the Restricted Drivers Manager doesnt detect your card, is to either download the driver from the NVIDIA site, or sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx and then dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. This isnt guaranted to work though.
2008-01-27T04:53:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	I'd use the nvidia driver from the nvidia site if I were you
2008-01-27T04:54:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	be sure to read the README file for instructions though
2008-01-27T05:20:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	follow this if you want to install manually
2008-01-27T05:20:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2008-01-27T05:24:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	yeah you need to install some packages first, did you see the link I gave you?
2008-01-27T05:25:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	it says which packages you need
2008-01-27T05:35:00.000Z	odysseas	techgeek40	did you try sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx first and then edit xorg.conf with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and pick the nvidia driver? Its much easier this way
