2011-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	Goliath		hey
2011-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	Goliath		does ubuntu deliver free installation cds?
2011-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	Goliath	Not anymore
2011-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		But check out your nearest LoCo group - they may help you out
2011-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	Goliath	RevSpecies116	LoCo?
2011-06-26T16:33:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		Local Community
2011-06-26T16:33:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		LoCo
2011-06-26T16:33:00.000Z	Goliath		oh
2011-06-26T16:33:00.000Z	Goliath	RevSpecies116	i can install my systems. i was just curious how could ubuntu give free of charge cds
2011-06-26T16:33:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		For example, I am in New Zealand - so if I needed local support, I'd look out for the loco-nz :)
2011-06-26T16:34:00.000Z	Goliath		it seems canonical has really expanded
2011-06-26T16:34:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	Goliath	Canonical stopped Shipit with I believe 9.10
2011-06-26T16:35:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		Nope - otherwise I'd have a 10.04LTS CD from Shipit
2011-06-26T16:35:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		Your nearest LoCo's may hook you up with free CD's and stickers
2011-06-26T16:35:00.000Z	Goliath		ubuntu may some time frustrate more advanced linux users
2011-06-26T16:36:00.000Z	Goliath		but it has done a good job
2011-06-26T16:36:00.000Z	Goliath		at least versus os x and windows
2011-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	Goliath	Start http://loco.ubuntu.com/ <-- There :)
2011-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		Unity is the future of Ubuntu :)
2011-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		I cannot wait for 12.04LTS
2011-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		And Weyland in 14.04LTS
2011-06-26T16:38:00.000Z	Goliath	RevSpecies116	does canonical make money from giving support to companies?
