2010-09-11T16:33:00.000Z	Stefanos90		<ubottu> my both computers are running now ubuntu
2010-09-11T16:33:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	ubottu is a bot
2010-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	what do you need to do exactly ?
2010-09-11T16:35:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	there are several ways you can do that: you can use the "Share" tab of the properties dialog in Nautilus to share a folder, or use FTP for example
2010-09-11T16:38:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	well, both, maybe more with ftp
2010-09-11T16:38:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	so you'll have to install a FTP server on one of the computers, I suggest installing "gadmin-proftpd"
2010-09-11T16:41:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	now run it from "Applications->System tools"
2010-09-11T16:43:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	on the "Servers" tab, you should have a Default server in the list
2010-09-11T16:44:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	yes, that's normal, select it and scroll down until you find "Upload speed"
2010-09-11T16:44:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	Set both "upload speed" and "download speed" to max values
2010-09-11T16:46:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	just enter "10000000000", and it'll set to max when you leave the box
2010-09-11T16:46:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	click "apply" and switch to "Users" tab
2010-09-11T16:48:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	now you're going to create a new user : fill the username, password and group fields (the user can be an already existing one of the system)
2010-09-11T16:48:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	then click "New user"
2010-09-11T16:50:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	at the bottom, you should have a "Add directory" button
2010-09-11T16:51:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	click on it and select the folder you would like to use as home for your ftp user
2010-09-11T16:52:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	check the checkboxes you want to give appropriate permissions (you may check them all)
2010-09-11T16:52:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	then click "New user" again
2010-09-11T16:53:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	ok, we're done here, click "Activate" in the top toolbar
2010-09-11T16:54:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	now from the other computer, run gFTP (from Applications->Internet)
2010-09-11T16:56:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	and you'll be able to transfer files between the two computers
2010-09-11T16:57:00.000Z	glebihan	Stefanos90	you're welcome
