2008-09-02T12:50:00.000Z	bakarat		hi, i have an odd problem on my ubuntu computer (7.10) -> when i boot, everything is fine, but bout 1 minute in, most of my desktop does not respond to mouse clicks anymore, i can still move the mouse around, and i can still control stuff with my keyboard, but the mouseclicks seem not to register
2008-09-02T12:50:00.000Z	bakarat		any idea?
2008-09-02T12:51:00.000Z	tuxPCtech	bakarat	have you verified that you mouse hardware is functional?
2008-09-02T12:51:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	ye i have a small windows partition on the same computer, works fine there
2008-09-02T12:54:00.000Z	tuxPCtech	bakarat	has the mouse ever worked in ubuntu?
2008-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	bakarat		ye
2008-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	for ages
2008-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	tuxPCtech	bakarat	what have you changed recently?
2008-09-02T12:56:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	nothing that i know off, i was working in linux, rebooted to windows for some playing, rebooted to linux and the problem started
2008-09-02T12:57:00.000Z	tuxPCtech	bakarat	What type of mouse are you using?
2008-09-02T12:57:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	wireless one, i actually have 2 hooked up to the computer at all times
2008-09-02T12:57:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	so i can switch when the battery dies (it's rechargeable)
2008-09-02T12:58:00.000Z	tuxPCtech		Has the battery died recently bakarat?
2008-09-02T12:58:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	no
2008-09-02T12:59:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	i also tried the other mouse, same exact problem
2008-09-02T12:59:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	also note that i can move the mouse around and the pointer follows, just doesn't register clicking
2008-09-02T12:59:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	and it only kicks in after about a minute, all works well in that first minute
2008-09-02T13:00:00.000Z	tuxPCtech	bakarat	does the other mouse work fine?
2008-09-02T13:00:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	same exact problem
2008-09-02T13:02:00.000Z	tuxPCtech	bakarat	sounds like a problem with your X server have you tried reconfigureing it?
2008-09-02T13:04:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	not yet, but i was thinking along those lines
2008-09-02T13:04:00.000Z	bakarat	tuxPCtech	will try that when i get home :)
