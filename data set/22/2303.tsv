2009-07-23T00:48:00.000Z	antigen		with all jokes aside, can someone guide me on how to repair an upgrade to 9.04? my laptop froze in the midpoint of installing (it downloaded everything prior) and now i am stuck at a root prompt, a few lines above it says /dev/sda2 contains a file system with errors, check forced. /dev/sda2:unexpected inconsistency fun fsck manually. fsck died with exit status 4. checking drive/dev/sda2: 4% 5/75. an automatic file system check of the roo
2009-07-23T00:49:00.000Z	znh	antigen	I'd suggest to make a backup, including a list of installed packages and reinstall. if you want the fastest way
2009-07-23T00:50:00.000Z	antigen		no , see i was doing the update-upgrade from update manager in ubuntu 8.10
2009-07-23T00:50:00.000Z	antigen		and it froze during the installation process
2009-07-23T00:51:00.000Z	znh	antigen	yes I understood that. seems something gone wrong
2009-07-23T00:51:00.000Z	antigen		i dont care if settings over ubuntu are written over.. i am more worried about my windows partition being lost somehow
2009-07-23T00:52:00.000Z	antigen	znh	can i repair what i had downloaded from the root prompt i am at?
2009-07-23T00:52:00.000Z	znh	antigen	yes you could. but that would cost you quite some time
2009-07-23T00:53:00.000Z	antigen	znh	L what do u mean by time?
2009-07-23T00:53:00.000Z	znh	antigen	lots of hours
2009-07-23T00:55:00.000Z	antigen		ah znh there's no command to come back from a failed installation crash? :( so what is the easiest way? please keep in mind, i have 2 very important partitions not related to ubuntu, those are the last two, it goes ubuntu, fat32, windows xp.
2009-07-23T00:55:00.000Z	antigen		also znh i dont mind about the data on the ubuntu partition - there's really nothing saved on there.
2009-07-23T00:56:00.000Z	znh	antigen	 I've never heard of such command. The easiest way would be to reinstall ubuntu and keep in mind that other partitions dont get overwritten
2009-07-23T00:58:00.000Z	antigen	znh	so i need to download a live cd then huh? i dont have a blank cdr, i can use a dvdr?
