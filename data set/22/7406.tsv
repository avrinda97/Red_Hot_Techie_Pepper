2006-05-15T06:37:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug		You know I've got to wonder why I'm in two linux channels, am fairly comfortable with UNIX, but am still using windows.
2006-05-15T06:37:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug		Haha
2006-05-15T06:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	just ditch windows and come to the light side 
2006-05-15T06:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	that's normal. Gentoo uses too much time compiling to ever get to do anything else
2006-05-15T06:39:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	well actually I like gentoo, believe it or not. I like ubuntu too, of course, that's what I run on my laptop.
2006-05-15T06:40:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	I always kept a win32 partition around because I have some teachers at my school who go completely whacko if there's any indication you did a project in anything other than windows.
2006-05-15T06:40:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	heh 
2006-05-15T06:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	ewwwww
2006-05-15T06:42:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	yeah, and I have this guy for my last two CS classes.
2006-05-15T06:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	remember, always run unix2dos over your sources 
2006-05-15T06:42:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	well it's going to be interesting when I use mono instead of .net for my projects.
2006-05-15T06:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	sure, and bush could grow a brain...
2006-05-15T06:49:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	that, unfortunately, is a problem that is NP-Complete.
2006-05-15T06:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	ast's ego is too big
2006-05-15T06:50:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	well technically so is stallman's.
2006-05-15T06:51:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	only esr can beat rms with ego-games 
2006-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	is that the german version?
2006-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	haha, it very well could be.
2006-07-13T16:31:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	gdm
2006-07-13T16:32:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	ahh, I was just curious because I was considering entrance on my gentoo machine.
2006-07-13T16:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Sir_Fawnpug	never used that, can't say whethere it is light or nice or neither
2006-07-13T16:33:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Seveas	ahh, well I'll do a little bit more research. I'm not a big fan of either kde or gnome so that's why I'm looking for an alternative.
