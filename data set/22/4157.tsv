2008-04-10T07:39:00.000Z	Alan_M	wobbiebobbie	sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop sudo aptitude remove ubuntustudio-desktop im guessing is how you would do it...
2008-04-10T07:40:00.000Z	Alan_M	wobbiebobbie	did my instructions help you?
2008-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	Alan_M	wobbiebobbie	i HIGHLY suggest you do sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop BEFORE you remove ubuntustudio-desktop...things get VERY bad if you dont i believe.
