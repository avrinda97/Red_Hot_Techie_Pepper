2009-06-14T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	legend2440	 thats just one of the issues with a 6 month relese cycle.  It has good and bad points.  :)
2009-07-01T03:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	legend2440	 if the old driver does all you need.. i would stick with it.

2009-09-27T17:38:00.000Z	legend2440	Dr_Willis	i think your monitor is upside down
2009-12-19T19:20:00.000Z	legend2440	Dr_Willis	is this it?  http://sourceforge.net/projects/sing/
2009-12-19T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	legend2440	 nah.. this was actually a ping variant used in scripts...
2009-12-19T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	legend2440	 it could set return coded and other things.  so you dident have to parse ping output
2009-12-19T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	legend2440	 but i guess it could of grown into that.. reading the sing docs...
2009-12-28T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	legend2440	 yes. thats a rather imporntant requirement
2009-12-28T18:49:00.000Z	legend2440	Dr_Willis	ok thank you
