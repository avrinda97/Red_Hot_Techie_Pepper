2011-01-02T22:31:00.000Z	__name__		hello
2011-01-02T22:31:00.000Z	__name__		can i tell apt i want certain packages from natty?
2011-01-02T22:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	no - mixing repo's between release distributions is a bad idea.  you could "try" to install just the DEBs from the updated program but that may not work out.  Check if there is a PPA with the updated program version available.
2011-01-02T22:33:00.000Z	__name__	ZykoticK9	Yes I already did that, it's a lot of work and does not give me patches to natty
2011-01-02T22:34:00.000Z	__name__	ZykoticK9	I think that compiling it myself is a worse idea than getting it from natty.
2011-01-02T22:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	true.  You decide, which is more important - the updated program on your current system - or running the alpha then.
2011-01-02T22:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	compiling yourself?
2011-01-02T22:34:00.000Z	__name__	ZykoticK9	The new version of the program.
2011-01-02T22:35:00.000Z	__name__	ZykoticK9	I need a newer version of something that is in the repos.
2011-01-02T22:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	search that ppa link!
2011-01-02T22:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	oh - well that won't work then :(
2011-01-02T22:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	what is it?
2011-01-02T22:36:00.000Z	__name__	ZykoticK9	stumpwm
2011-01-02T22:36:00.000Z	__name__	ZykoticK9	The maverick deb keeps dying.
2011-01-02T22:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	sorry never used that.  best of luck man.  i take it stumpwm is a very low resource wm?
2011-01-02T22:37:00.000Z	__name__	ZykoticK9	It's just another tiling WM.
2011-01-02T22:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	the stumpwm web page updates a line directly under the title (in the top right corner) every minute or so - some of them are pretty funny.</OT>

2011-01-02T22:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	__name__	ya apt pinning is not something i know much about - never had to use it myself.  might work though.
