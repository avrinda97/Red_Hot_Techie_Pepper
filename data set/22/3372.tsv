2008-09-22T05:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Are you having trouble with an NTFS autmount?
2008-09-22T05:59:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Did you exit Windows cleanly the last time?
2008-09-22T06:00:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	 and it's not listed in fdisk?
2008-09-22T06:02:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Maybe fstab got corrupted. gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2008-09-22T06:02:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar	bobertdos	did it
2008-09-22T06:03:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Please pastebin the content of the file.
2008-09-22T06:03:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Pastebin. paste.ubuntu.com
2008-09-22T06:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	As I thought, there is no entry in your fstab for your ntfs partition.
2008-09-22T06:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Do you still have it open?
2008-09-22T06:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	You may PM me if you wish.
2008-10-04T02:08:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	If you want to be absolutely sure you're targeting the right drive, run sudo fdisk -l to figure out which drive is which before running the installer.
2008-10-04T02:08:00.000Z	PostersandGuitar	bobertdos	I'm installing Ubuntu Studio. No Live CD. Just text-based
2008-10-04T02:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Well, I would still run fdisk, and use that information to make sure the installer targets the right drive.
2008-10-04T02:13:00.000Z	bobertdos	PostersandGuitar	Oh, that's right, the UbuntuStudio disk probably doesn't have all the same packages installed. Well, if they are two physically separate drives, they will probably be named something like sda1 (for the first drive) and sdb1 (for the second). Usually, it will show their sizes and so forth, so hopefully you'll be able to tell them apart.
