2008-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	tehboriz		hard disc cloning i have sda1 and sdb1
2008-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	the destination partition must be the same size or larger than the source partition ... « dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 » will copy from sda1 to sdb1
2008-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	though copying the files is better
2008-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	if you mount them at /media/disk /media/disk-1, then « cp -a /media/disk/* /media/disk-1 » should make them equal
2008-09-03T11:44:00.000Z	tehboriz	geirha	are you saying copy and paste everything from one to the other
2008-09-03T11:39:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	add sudo in front of the command
2008-09-03T11:40:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	it's gonna copy the whole drive, even the empty part
2008-09-03T11:43:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	it's copying every single byte, even the empty space
2008-09-03T11:43:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	So, copying is better
2008-09-03T11:43:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	because you just told it to
2008-09-03T11:45:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	yes, you partition the destination drive the same way as the source, create the same type of filesystem, mount them both, then use «cp -a»
2008-09-03T11:46:00.000Z	tehboriz	geirha	are you saying just type in cp -a and it'll do everything?
2008-09-03T11:47:00.000Z	geirha	tehboriz	you'll also need to edit the fstab on the destination though ...
