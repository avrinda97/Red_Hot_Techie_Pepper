2005-05-23T11:20:00.000Z	pixel83		has anyone heard of a screen-scrolling-in-lower-resolution-bug?
2005-05-23T11:20:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	sounds like your sync values aren't correct or something
2005-05-23T11:22:00.000Z	pixel83		psyconate: I installed the driver according to ubuntuguide.org. this worked under warty, but now I installed hoary and this bug occured every time I start Enemy territory (which does not get past a black screen)
2005-05-23T11:23:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	Which driver?
2005-05-23T11:23:00.000Z	pixel83	psychonate	the funny thing is that, while et is hanging... nvidia
2005-05-23T11:24:00.000Z	pixel83		psyconate: ...I can scroll out of the black screen an use my desktop...
2005-05-23T11:24:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	yes, I know what you mean
2005-05-23T11:24:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	I think I may have had that problem before on another distro. Let me try ET quick.
2005-05-23T11:25:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	What you want to do is run ET from a terminal and look at the output in the terminal.
2005-05-23T11:25:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	It will probably show you what it's getting hung on.
2005-05-23T11:26:00.000Z	pixel83		psyconate: sounds good, I'll try it. is there any way in removing that display error after its occurence other than rebooting?
2005-05-23T11:26:00.000Z	pixel83		I didn't find et in ps -A
2005-05-23T11:27:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	you mean you want to kill enemy territory without rebooting?
2005-05-23T11:27:00.000Z	pixel83		psyconate: yes, or just get rid of that black rectangle so I can work on...
2005-05-23T11:28:00.000Z	pixel83	psychonate	well, I'll try it now
2005-05-23T11:28:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	hold on a sec
2005-05-23T11:28:00.000Z	pixel83	psychonate	ok
2005-05-23T11:29:00.000Z	pixel83	psychonate	btw, do you mean a real terminal or a terminal under gnome?
2005-05-23T11:30:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	if the game hangs again, you should be able to hit ALT+CTRL+F2. Then, login, type 'ps -e' and look for enemy territory proccess. (I'm not sure what it will be called.) Then, use the kill command to kill it: 'kill <proccess name here>'. Logout. Hit ALT+CTRL+F7 to get back to X.
2005-05-23T11:30:00.000Z	pixel83		psychonate:okay.
2005-05-23T11:30:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	oh
2005-05-23T11:30:00.000Z	psychonate	pixel83	You can run the game in gnome-terminal. That will suffice.
