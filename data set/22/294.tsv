2012-01-18T13:58:00.000Z	etu_		Hi! I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas about making firefox load faster. It currently takes about 3 seconds. I tried cleaning the SQLite database using a script, but it didn't do much for me. I'm on Ubuntu 10.10.
2012-01-18T13:59:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	3 seconds ain't long... It loads for like 1.5 minutes for me, hey
2012-01-18T14:01:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	Ah, ok. I was thinking, like most programs such as Abiword take maybe 1.5 seconds at most, so Firefox might too. How does it take 1.5min? That seems kind of slow. Then again I'm not a particularly patient person :-P
2012-01-18T14:01:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	Anyway, on Extensions Manager -> Plugins disable those you do not use, especially the "VLC Multimedia Player Plugin" (if that's there), that takes ages to load.
2012-01-18T14:03:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	Ok, thanks!
2012-01-18T14:03:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	As for how it takes 1.5 minutes, extensions, tons of them (like twenty). Chrome with almost same number of extensions starts up in just a few seconds though ^_^
2012-01-18T14:05:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	Ah, hmm. I disabled the VLC plugin, but didn't notice much difference. Then again I have about twenty plugins and extensions too. It's funny that you say that because I switched away from Chromium because it was too slow. :-P
2012-01-18T14:05:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	Huh. Weird. Okay lol
2012-01-18T14:06:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	Ah, it's way faster in safe mode. Must be an extension or a plugin that's the culprit…
2012-01-18T14:06:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	I suppose so.
2012-01-18T14:07:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	I haven't used Firefox for a few months now, and the last one I used is Aurora anyway
2012-01-18T14:09:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	lol, yup, 14 plugins
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	Not to mention 13 extensions. No wonder it's slow.
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	lol
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	The ridiculous list: http://pastebin.com/TYGww0UF :-D
2012-01-18T14:12:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	lol
2012-01-18T14:12:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	Now for going through and figuring out which ones are the culprits… :-P
2012-01-18T14:15:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	lol not bad, these are mine: http://i.imm.io/eNLh.png
2012-01-18T14:16:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	hehe. That looks like plenty
2012-01-18T14:16:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	pm? lol
2012-01-18T14:17:00.000Z	theadmin	etu_	We went a bit offtopic
2012-01-18T14:17:00.000Z	etu_	theadmin	hmm, good point :-S
