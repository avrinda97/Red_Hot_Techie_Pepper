2007-09-23T05:30:00.000Z	dv310p3r		I am trying to get my built in SmartCard reader to work, i can see it when i run dmesg on the last line, but nothing I do get's it working. I tried editing the fstab file but still nothing
2007-09-23T05:30:00.000Z	dv310p3r		any help
2007-09-23T05:31:00.000Z	dv310p3r		Not sure, how can i find out?
2007-09-23T05:31:00.000Z	dv310p3r		does tifm_core mean anything
2007-09-23T05:31:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	doesnt it have to have a file system on it? why fs is in the smart card?
2007-09-23T05:38:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	do you have a memory card inserted in?
2007-09-23T05:38:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	does it show when you type mount
2007-09-23T05:40:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	your memory card is formatted and have a file system on it?
2007-09-23T05:42:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	i assume the windows format uses that cifs  thats listed noh?
2007-09-23T05:43:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	yes, i thought those were the memory cards you have
2007-09-23T05:44:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	 remove the memory card and see if its detected by dmesg
2007-09-23T05:45:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	or look at your /var/log/messages at the end
2007-09-23T05:45:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	also you need to prefix your responses with my nick if its for me, i will miss if it doesnt have
2007-09-23T05:46:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bulmer	ok, weird now there is an extra line at the bottom, ill past again
2007-09-23T05:47:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bulmer	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38306/
2007-09-23T05:48:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	there you go, its detected, now plug the memory back in and see if its seen in mount assuming it has a recognizable FS on it
2007-09-23T05:49:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bulmer	the mount output - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38307/
2007-09-23T05:53:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bulmer	You still with me?
2007-09-23T05:55:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	yes..i dont see it detected yet...you may have to wait for a few till your card is detected
2007-09-23T05:56:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bulmer	is there any ways i can force the mount?
2007-09-23T05:57:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	use the mount command
2007-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	bulmer	dv310p3r	i also asked you to look at /var/log/messages  did it show anything when you plugged/unplugged the memory card?
