2008-12-20T20:58:00.000Z	dcider		i have some linux generic updates that wont install, says that it might be a number of reasons, such as a previous install that didnt complete etc. etc. how do i find out why the updates wont install, running intrepid with kernel 2.6.27-10
2008-12-20T21:00:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	i think its due to your kernel
2008-12-20T21:02:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	there are 4 updates linux-generic. linux-image-generic, linux-headers-generic and linux-restricted-modules-generic that wont install
2008-12-20T21:04:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	you are running a newer kernel, not the intrepid  generic kernel, how did you install it?
2008-12-20T21:05:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	everything has been installed or updated thru the update manager
2008-12-20T21:05:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	have you got some repository added manually?
2008-12-20T21:06:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	probably, i'll have a look
2008-12-20T21:06:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	this is intrepids kernel, 2.6.27-9-generic
2008-12-20T21:08:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	cairo-dock and medibuntu
2008-12-20T21:09:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	you have a problem, can you boot an older kernel at the boot menu?
2008-12-20T21:10:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	fraid i dont know how to do that...
2008-12-20T21:11:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	were would this kernel have com from? i only use the update manager?
2008-12-20T21:12:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	i can only guess the repo you used installed it. never seen the problem.
2008-12-20T21:13:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	 im guessing that something must need it to run or it wouldnt be installed, wondering if booting to a different kernel will cause some problems???
2008-12-20T21:14:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	if you're running ok dont downgrade, type uname -r in a terminal, whats the output
2008-12-20T21:15:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	2.6.27-10-generic
2008-12-20T21:18:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	the updates are 2.6.27-14
2008-12-20T21:19:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	sorry s/b 2.6.27-11
2008-12-20T21:19:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	you can't be using the proper repositories, you running intrepid?
2008-12-20T21:19:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	yea
2008-12-20T21:22:00.000Z	LtL	dcider	thats /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-12-20T22:48:00.000Z	dcider	LtL	mucked around, everything works great and i'm using 2.6.27-11
