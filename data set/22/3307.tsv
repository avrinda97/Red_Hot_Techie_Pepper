2008-10-28T21:40:00.000Z	tavish	armageddon	but how would that help
2008-10-28T21:43:00.000Z	armageddon	tavish	you could try to mount the device and backup to some external storage
2008-10-28T21:44:00.000Z	armageddon	tavish	at least the parts without errors
2008-10-28T21:44:00.000Z	armageddon	tavish	or is the hard drive completely dead ?
