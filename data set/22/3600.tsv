2008-07-24T02:02:00.000Z	ekow		k i'm back to square one, anybody want to guide me through getting my wireless internet to work on my laptop?
2008-07-24T02:03:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	what didn't work?
2008-07-24T02:08:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	sorry I got lost in some documentation.. but you could always try dmesg and look for anything that has to do with you wireless
2008-07-24T02:19:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	you could pastebin it and I could look through it for ya, it's kind of hard to tell, but wlan-stuff :)
2008-07-24T02:20:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	also you could try the command "ifconfig" and look for wlan in that
2008-07-24T02:21:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	it's just to check if it has registered the wlan at all, mos tlikely you will need to force som edrivers for it. What computer is it and it you know so, what wlan card?
2008-07-24T02:26:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	I need a bit more than that to help you, I cant find what sort of wlan is integrated, do you happen to have any spec lying around?
2008-07-24T02:30:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	iw WOULD unless their links were all broken to me :(
2008-07-24T02:30:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	but as I said, try pastebin you dmesg and send me a link
2008-07-24T02:38:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	okay heres what I could find, I think you chipset is r8169, so now we can try to find out if there is some sort of problem with the driver for this chipset
2008-07-24T02:41:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	also we could try the command iwconfig, tell me if it finds anything that doesnt say "no wireless extensions"
2008-07-24T02:44:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	do you know the wlan works at all, and what does ifconfig say?
2008-07-24T02:48:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	do that, because I cannot find anything thats says anything about wlan in your dmesg, and thats where I usually find them with my own hardware :)
2008-07-24T02:51:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	great :) now type lspci on your laptop and pastebin that
2008-07-24T02:54:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	okay well, heres the deal, it doesnt seem that your wireless is at all found. Are you sure it works? in for example windows.
2008-07-24T02:55:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	perhaps you could go in to vista and check what the wireless card is called?
2008-07-24T02:57:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	I think the best place would be in the Device manager
2008-07-24T02:58:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	do that, I hope I'll still be up when you return :
2008-07-24T03:06:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	great! lets google for some info on RTL8187B and ubuntu 8.04
2008-07-24T03:09:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	http://mycirilo.com/?p=24 This might work
2008-07-24T03:10:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	or this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=765671
2008-07-24T03:11:00.000Z	ay^_	ekow	I have to go to bed now, the wife is a grumpy such.. ;) But good luck to you and I hope you can get it to work, or I'll probably be here some time tomorrow
