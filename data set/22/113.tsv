2012-07-07T09:59:00.000Z	dmp450		hey, if nobody is logged into my computer I can't seem to ssh into the computer unless someone is logged into the machine? Would anyone know why this would be?
2012-07-07T10:01:00.000Z	dmp450		but if I use the machine and actually log in as a user it will let me ssh into the machine after
2012-07-07T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	dmp450	wired or wirelesses  networking?
2012-07-07T10:02:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	wired
2012-07-07T10:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	dmp450	login via the console on the server. not x as a test. see if it works
2012-07-07T10:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	dmp450	dies ping also fail?
2012-07-07T10:06:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	yeah, and it doesn't seem to be up until I log in through gdm
2012-07-07T10:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	dmp450	whish is why i said try the console login. not  x.
2012-07-07T10:07:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	on the machine itself? or on my ssh client?
2012-07-07T10:07:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	will I have to log out of tty7?
2012-07-07T10:10:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	when I logged into tty1 and I tried to ctrl alt f7 to get back and talk to you it just had a black screen and said sabnzbd was starting
2012-07-07T10:12:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	okay, I'll grab one of those, log into tty1 then come back?
2012-07-07T10:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	dmp450	 a dirty fix could be to restart networking from /etc/rc.local
2012-07-07T10:13:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	so just sudo /etc/rc.local restart?
2012-07-07T10:23:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	you are a genius. tty8 works. you still think restarting networking would do it?
2012-07-07T10:26:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	so would I just sudo /etc/rc.local restart then? is that how that would work?
2012-07-07T10:27:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	so how would I restart networking from there?
2012-07-07T10:30:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	I did do one thing. Ubuntu notified me of a kernel upgrade, so I did that. I don't know if this is when the issue started isnce I haven't had to ssh into here for a while
2012-07-07T10:32:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	where would I edit the startup daemons? Would that be in the rc.local?
2012-07-07T10:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	dmp450	 network manager icon on the top right panel on desktop
2012-07-07T10:37:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	yeah, it says it should connect automatically :/
2012-07-07T10:45:00.000Z	dmp450	dr_willis	restarted and things worked fine :S
