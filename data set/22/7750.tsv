2006-01-14T08:23:00.000Z	hikenboot		in ubunto how do i tell the version of gcc installed I did an echo $CC and dont get anything?
2006-01-14T08:25:00.000Z	hikenboot		I installed the gcc packages but it tells me  gcc: command not found do i have to configure gcc some how or specify an environment variable?
2006-01-14T08:25:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	try gcc-4.0
2006-01-14T08:26:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	I mean try typing "gcc-4.0" instead of "gcc"
2006-01-14T08:28:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	there's supposed to be a symlink from /usr/bin/gcc to gcc-4.0 - but sometimes it doesn't get made.  ubuntu's a bit flaky sometimes
2006-01-14T08:35:00.000Z	hikenboot	dooglus	so i should ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.0 /usr/bin/gcc after creating directory gcc ?
2006-01-14T08:36:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	"sudo ln -s gcc-4.0 /usr/bin/gcc" is how it usually looks
2006-01-15T11:11:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	you're missing the symbolic link from /usr/bin/gcc to gcc-4.0?
2006-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	what happens if you just run "gcc" on its own?
2006-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	"ls -l /usr/bin/gcc".  what about that?
2006-01-15T11:14:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	"ls -l /usr/bin/gcc".  what about that?
2006-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	was that addressed to me?
2006-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	hikenboot	dooglus	yes sorry
2006-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	that can't possibly be the output of the command I asked you to run
2006-01-15T11:16:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	could you try again, but copy/paste this time?
2006-01-15T11:16:00.000Z	hikenboot	dooglus	ls -l /usr/bin/gcc
2006-01-15T11:17:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	so /usr/bin/gcc is a directory?
2006-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	you need to do this:  "sudo bash -c '/bin/rm -r /usr/bin/gcc; ln -s gcc-4.0 /usr/bin/gcc'"
2006-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	to see that it's really a directory, do this: "ls -ld /usr/bin/gcc"
2006-01-15T11:19:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	see the initial 'd'?  that means it's a directory
2006-01-15T11:19:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	I've got my suspicions :)
2006-01-15T11:19:00.000Z	dooglus	hikenboot	I reckon it was a combination of you, sudo and mkdir :)
