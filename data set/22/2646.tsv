2009-12-19T02:22:00.000Z	xover		guys im having SAVAGE flash performance, whats the issue?
2009-12-19T02:23:00.000Z	xover		its dogturd performance, i cant even play 'slime volleyball' without losing frames
2009-12-19T02:25:00.000Z	xover		Neurotic, you cannot, its a safety feature, so as not to fsck your system when installing dependant packages.
2009-12-19T02:25:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	installation can be done later, downloading multiple files shudnt be a problem , i suppose
2009-12-19T02:27:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	i have a multihomed system , so its a real speedup if i use multiple downloads
2009-12-19T02:29:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	i have multiple internet connections, each with a separate ip. thats multihoming
2009-12-19T02:31:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	yes, not 2, 10 links
2009-12-19T02:32:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	no :P just 10 different ips on the same wire... u know what i mean ?
2009-12-19T02:34:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	i suppose u mean (eth0:1,eth0:2) by subinterfaces, YES
2009-12-19T02:36:00.000Z	xover	neur0tic	why do you want to download more than one package? Your bandwidth is limited at WAN level right!
2009-12-19T02:37:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	i do not want to download more than 1 package, i want to simultaneously download the files in 'a' package, so that i get 32 * 10 = 320 KB/s instead of the current 32KB/s
2009-12-19T02:38:00.000Z	xover	neur0tic	what is your WAN link speed?
2009-12-19T02:38:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	100Mbps
2009-12-19T02:38:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	no, sorry its 32KB/s per IP
2009-12-19T02:39:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	my LAN link speed is 100mbps
2009-12-19T02:39:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	i dont get you. please refreame
2009-12-19T02:41:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	my isp is determining the 32KB/s
2009-12-19T02:43:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	ahh well, im in my office, and i need that kind of speed. i have a proxy setup, which round-robins over the 10 links. my isp, does not give connections over 256kbps. so i had to buy 10 links to get 3.2mbps and setup a socks5 proxy (self written) to round robin over the ips
2009-12-19T02:45:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	so the thing is , as soon as i can tell synaptic to get 10 files at once, using a proxy, i get 10 times the speed. 1 file , means, just 1x speed.
2009-12-19T02:46:00.000Z	xover	neur0tic	sounds cool, so your saying that is application specific, i.e. if you did a wget you would get your 3.2meg?
2009-12-19T02:47:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	no, if  i did a wget, with 10 'segements' , i would get 3.2mbps
2009-12-19T02:54:00.000Z	neur0tic	xover	suburbs of mumbai, india :)
