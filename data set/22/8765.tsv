2005-05-26T07:25:00.000Z	teknoprep	Andril	there is an auto update option that works
2005-05-26T07:25:00.000Z	Andril	teknoprep	can you help? update = from the installer?
2005-05-26T07:25:00.000Z	teknoprep	Andril	no from inside firefox itself
2005-05-26T07:26:00.000Z	teknoprep	Andril	check for updates

2005-05-26T07:27:00.000Z	Andril	teknoprep	I hope it's that easy
2005-05-26T07:28:00.000Z	teknoprep	Andril	yeah just goto Check for update button in your Extension window.. i think its under tool's
2005-05-26T07:29:00.000Z	Andril	teknoprep	i get this when I try to get themes: You must upgrade to version 1.0.4 or newer of Firefox before accessing the Mozilla Update web service. In order to keep your computer safe when using the Internet, its important to install new updates of Firefox as soon as they are available. Click on the Upgrade Now link to get the latest version of Firefox.
2005-05-26T07:30:00.000Z	Andril	teknoprep	that only does my Extensions & Plu Ins
2005-05-26T07:43:00.000Z	Andril	teknoprep	did you get it installed?
2005-05-26T07:43:00.000Z	teknoprep	Andril	 no
2005-05-26T07:43:00.000Z	teknoprep	Andril	yes i did.. but can't find the autoupdate
2005-05-26T07:44:00.000Z	Andril	teknoprep	yep - that's why I was wondering if the installer would damage my future updates
2005-05-26T07:56:00.000Z	Andril	teknoprep	thansk anyways - i'll wait for it & beagle too
