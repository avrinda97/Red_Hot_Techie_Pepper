2007-10-23T12:00:00.000Z	monkey__		for some reason, i feel gusty is slower than feisty on my lappy
2007-10-23T12:01:00.000Z	rredd4	monkey__	 maybe you should use xubuntu
2007-10-23T12:01:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	i am
2007-10-23T12:02:00.000Z	rredd4	monkey__	i am using 7.10 ubuntu on a dell c810  1.3ghz 512 ram
2007-10-23T12:02:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	xbuntu running gui feels the same as ubuntu runs the same gui app. i.e. xchat
2007-10-23T12:03:00.000Z	rredd4	monkey__	xfce?
2007-10-23T12:03:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	i had 512 mb ram running feisty and work fine.  few months ago i up it to 2gb, 1.7 ghz and now installed gusty
2007-10-23T12:03:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	xfce feels just the same as gnome on this lappy
2007-10-23T12:03:00.000Z	rredd4		lax don't shut it off...
2007-10-23T12:04:00.000Z	rredd4	monkey__	have always used gdm on my lappy
2007-10-23T12:04:00.000Z	rredd4		lax  lol!!
2007-10-23T12:04:00.000Z	rredd4		lax  that would fix it
2007-10-23T12:04:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	i am getting bored of the interface for gnome, kde, xfce and fluxbox.  wonder what should i try next.
2007-10-23T12:05:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	yes, always had gdm on this lappy
2007-10-23T12:05:00.000Z	rredd4	monkey__	 e  (enlightment)  different interface
2007-10-23T12:05:00.000Z	rredd4		lax  sleep....
2007-10-23T12:05:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	when i upgrade from 512mb to 2gb in feisty, it feels the same, no increase in speed. but just with gusty, it feels slow comparing to feisty
2007-10-23T12:06:00.000Z	rredd4	monkey__	 should be faster with 2gb...  512 is my max
2007-10-23T12:07:00.000Z	rredd4	monkey__	i guess as they get new versions of gnome, it gets slower on older machines  ?
2007-10-23T12:07:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	ram does increase performance imo.  i need to upgraded to run multiple virtual machines
2007-10-23T12:07:00.000Z	monkey__		s /upgraded /upgrade it
2007-10-23T12:08:00.000Z	monkey__	rredd4	mine is 1.5 years old
