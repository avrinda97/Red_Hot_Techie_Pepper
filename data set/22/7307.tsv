2011-07-16T22:31:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	  are you running Unity?>
2011-07-16T22:32:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	 ok,,  in ccsm  under animations,, you can adjust the speed of the animation in case the animation speed is what appears to make the applications open slower
2011-07-16T22:34:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	  another way,, one that I generally dont  suggest is to install preload,,  boot time will probably increase with that however
2011-07-16T22:35:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	  here is a list of things you can take a look at    http://mygeekopinions.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-to-make-ubuntu-unity-desktop-run.html
2011-07-16T22:37:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	  also refrain from using  the Ubuntu software center,, it is generally pretty resource intensive ,, instead use synaptic package manager
2011-07-16T22:39:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	 cool  that will certainly help in using up resources at least for package installation and removals
2011-07-16T22:40:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	 no   but ubuntu software center itself can be a resource intensive especially on lesser systems
2011-07-16T22:41:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	 plus you learn more from using terminal :)
2011-07-16T22:41:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	 I agree with StevenR  with that
2011-07-16T22:41:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	 although i would suggest htop
2011-07-16T22:43:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	 there are also utilities such as rcconf   or  sysv-rc-conf to stop services you dont need but that is more for boot up time saving
2011-07-16T22:44:00.000Z	coz_	Pin	  top should already be installed but you will have to sudo apt-get install htop
