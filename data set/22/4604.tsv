2012-10-10T00:24:00.000Z	michealPW		Oh, no? I just changed the setting and then restarted LOL
2012-10-10T00:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 then the changes are not being used. :-(
2012-10-15T19:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 neither have i.
2012-10-15T20:43:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	LOL like mount the iso and run install from there? How would that work during the install I wonder haha? :\
2012-10-15T20:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	grub2 can boot the iso.
2012-10-15T20:44:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	Ahh, that's interesting! :\
2012-10-15T20:44:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	So like, I could edit my grub menu to add the iso and then boot from the iso??
2012-10-15T20:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	exactly.
2012-10-15T21:21:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	Ah, really? I'm running 32-bit Ubuntu on 64-bit hardware :|
2012-10-15T23:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 or just rename it. thats a little safer
2012-10-15T23:54:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1281837/
2012-10-16T00:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 and a 30 sec fix only took you..... ;P
2012-10-16T00:10:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	LOL a 30 sec fix took me at least 30 minutes fighting with KDE until I gave up :(
2012-10-16T00:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 ive seen very few apps that wouldent work in kde or gnome... cant think of any that have had issues
2012-10-16T00:21:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	Well it's not a compatibility problem like that. Caffeine just simply doesn't do anything on KDE. Caffeine's a small little program that will detect if Flash is running Fullscreen and if so it disabled the gnome-screensaver. Problem with KDE 4 is they've integrated the screensaver directly into the plasma-desktop or kdesktop or whatever they're calling it today.
2012-10-16T00:21:00.000Z	michealPW	dr_willis	So, Caffeine runs but it doesn't do anything. It can't suspend the KDE screensaver. Not having it start at all if KDE launches would be ideal, I think.
2012-10-16T00:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 was it working?
2012-10-17T19:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	using screen or tmux or byobu would make that easy.
2012-11-03T03:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 try it and see. ;) id think so
2012-11-03T03:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 try a locate xpad.ko
2012-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 what was the exact command line you used?
2012-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	michealPW	 over thought it a little bit... ;P
