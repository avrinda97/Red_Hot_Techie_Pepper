2009-10-16T18:27:00.000Z	Arelis	RS-232	I don't care about CAD
2009-10-16T18:25:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	sorry but I have here on front of me a WACOM tablet working corrrectly without installing anything special, the Ubuntu default isntallation detected it
2009-10-16T18:25:00.000Z	Arelis	RS-232	(Last time I tried was Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon)
2009-10-16T18:25:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	I am now in Jaunty and it is working fine
2009-10-16T18:26:00.000Z	Arelis	RS-232	But then there's the other things.. Is Linux usable for professional graphical work such as 2D animation? And how would I get my guitar equipment working?
2009-10-16T18:26:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	you have Gimp for picture edition, as a replacement for PhotoShop
2009-10-16T18:27:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	Cinerrela as replacement for Adobe Premier
2009-10-16T18:27:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	however CAD is a big LACK in Linux if that is you interest
2009-10-16T18:28:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	what is the software you used to use in MAC?
2009-10-16T18:29:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	probably you should talking about what software you wanted to have in Linux and we will respond you
2009-10-16T18:30:00.000Z	Arelis	RS-232	Line 6 POD FARM for amp modeling, Audacity for recording (But I switched to REAPER because Audacity is not good on a Mac), Safari (because Firefox doesn't work), Adium (but I prefer Pidgin), I used to use the GIMP but I switched over to Photoshop - I don't see what's so much better about it, Adobe Flash CS3/CS4 (I DEFINETLY need this), there's some other things but I have to search for them on my Mac.
2009-10-16T18:31:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	Well for Safari you have : Firefox, Opera, Epiphany, etc...
2009-10-16T18:31:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	for your IPOD you have Amarok
2009-10-16T18:32:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	for Adobe Flahs (Macromedia ) I am sorry...but Flash and Linux don't get on very vwell however you can use SVG library and others, there are 1000 threads in internet talking about this
2009-10-16T18:33:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	for modeling you have BLENDER
2009-10-16T18:34:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	and ALWAYS if all the options have run out, you can start up a SUN Virtual Machine with your XP or OS Leopard image and run what you need
2009-10-16T18:34:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	I do that when I need to work with Solidworks (I am a mechanical Engineer)
2009-10-16T18:40:00.000Z	Arelis	RS-232	But, would the Mac be better for working in the professional graphical industry, or is Linux sufficient?
2009-10-16T18:40:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	that is something that you have to find out.
2009-10-16T18:41:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	in my case for CAD->Windows, ANYTHING ELSE -> Linux :).... well, I forgot, for games ->Windows... that the best thing it does
2009-10-16T18:42:00.000Z	RS-232	Arelis	after 4 years, I can't even imagine my life without Linux !
2009-10-16T18:43:00.000Z	Arelis	RS-232	The problem with a dual-boot of Mac and Linux on this PC is, first, it's risky, because I have to replace the EFI - and second, I keep using the Mac side more because all the things apps I need for my daily activities are there.
