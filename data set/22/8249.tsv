2005-09-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antiliis		I have a problem with text-mode console
2005-09-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antiliis		I'm Spanish and I use accented keys, like 
2005-09-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antiliis		but this characters doesn't appears in the text-mode console
2005-09-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antiliis		the problem is in Hoary and Breezy, too
2005-09-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antiliis		anyone can help me?
2005-09-24T15:43:00.000Z	Antiliis		yes, perfectly. My locale is es_ES.UTF-8
2005-09-24T15:43:00.000Z	shawarma	Antiliis	Try dpkg-reconfigure console-data
2005-09-24T15:44:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	mmm ok, I try this now
2005-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	thanks for the tip, but it didn't work
2005-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	I tried all the chances, but without success
2005-09-24T15:47:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	I think the problem is in the keyboard. showcfont shows all the characters correctly (including the accented ones)
2005-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	shawarma	Antiliis	Oh, right. 2 secs.
2005-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	shawarma	Antiliis	dpkg-reconfigure console-common
2005-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	mmmm ok, i'm going of it now
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	sorry, it does nothing :(
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	it says: 'Looking for keymap to install: es'
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	shawarma	Antiliis	Did you run /etc/init.d/keymap.sh after running dpkg-reconfigure console-data
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	I'm going to do now
2005-09-24T15:55:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	I tried this, I run /etc/init.d/keymap.sh after dpkg-reconfigure console-data, but the problem remains
2005-09-24T15:55:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	I think this is a problem with Unicode
2005-09-24T15:56:00.000Z	Antiliis	shawarma	(in Debian that problem doesn't exists)
