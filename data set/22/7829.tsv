2006-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	Subhuman		hey, does anyone know how to get ubuntu to redetect a sound card?
2006-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	Subhuman		without a reinstall.
2006-05-24T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	turn it off or take it out and then turn it on or put it back
2006-05-24T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	 with a boot in the middle of that process
2006-05-24T16:09:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	in the same slot?
2006-05-24T16:09:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	so turn off - take out - boot stuf
2006-05-24T16:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	as I was saying turn it off then put it in again on a different but
2006-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	bus (slot)
2006-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	and btw is that an audigy?
2006-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	Subhuman	ompaul	so you are saying (just to be sure), take the pci card out while my pc is on, shut it down , switch it on and then put it in a different slot?
2006-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	Subhuman	ompaul	yeah it is an audigy.
2006-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	alsamixer and unmute it :-)
2006-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	enjoy :)
2006-05-24T16:12:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	disable anything else that is there as audio
2006-05-24T16:13:00.000Z	Subhuman	ompaul	alsamixer gives me "alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device"
2006-05-24T16:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	okay there should only be one audio device that could be blocking it all
2006-05-24T16:15:00.000Z	Subhuman	ompaul	at the moment, if i open the sound prefs I get a blank drop down list for "default sound card", lspci shows the card, but I can't get ubuntu to see the card, I think the IRQ number mightve changed, I'm not great with pci hardware so i dont really know.
2006-05-24T16:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	okay, my final comment on this, you can only have one sound device working at a time, put it in a different slot, a seek is done on boot up, when you have done that check if there is anything muted in alsamixer
2006-05-24T16:18:00.000Z	Subhuman	ompaul	 thanks for the help :D
2006-06-12T06:53:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	in a lot of cases they are the same machine
2006-06-12T06:54:00.000Z	Subhuman	ompaul	well the uk ones arent, my debian server gets about 180kb/sec on quiet times, my ubuntu desktop can get 270 ( peak bw) almost all the time
2006-06-12T06:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Subhuman	in the uk they are different machines ;-) however in most of the rest of the world they are on "good mirrors"
