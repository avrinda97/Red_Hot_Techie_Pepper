2011-05-10T08:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelpmounting	run:  sudo fdisk -l     You will see the available partitions
2011-05-10T08:39:00.000Z	needhelpmounting	ActionParsnip	heres the one i want: /dev/sda1   *           1        9328    74920960   83  Linux
2011-05-10T08:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelpmounting	ok then run:  sudo mkdir /media/stuff; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/stuff
2011-05-10T08:41:00.000Z	needhelpmounting	ActionParsnip	it seems to have stalled during mounting
2011-05-10T08:42:00.000Z	needhelpmounting		the dir created and i guess the mount command issued but never finishes
2011-05-10T08:42:00.000Z	needhelpmounting		and nothing in /media/stuff ActionParsnip
2011-05-10T08:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelpmounting	what did mount output?

2011-05-10T08:46:00.000Z	needhelpmounting	ActionParsnip	if i try to reset the drive with hdparm will it lose the filesystem?
2011-05-10T08:46:00.000Z	needhelpmounting	ActionParsnip	what is next?
2011-05-10T08:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelpmounting	if it won't mount, you may need to fsck it first
2011-05-10T08:47:00.000Z	needhelpmounting	ActionParsnip	thats what I tried to do and it says it is mounted but it isnt
2011-05-10T08:48:00.000Z	needhelpmounting	ActionParsnip	e2fsck: Device or resource busy while trying to open /dev/sda1
2011-05-10T08:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelpmounting	are you in the installed system or the live cd / usb?
