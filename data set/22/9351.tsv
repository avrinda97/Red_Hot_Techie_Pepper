2005-01-02T06:44:00.000Z	ycco		Had to do it in gconf IIRC
2005-01-02T06:44:00.000Z	ogra	ycco	anywhere in the desktop settings
2005-01-02T06:46:00.000Z	ycco	ogra	I think I had to specifically look for it in gconf
2005-01-16T08:04:00.000Z	ogra	ycco	looks like a typical hoary bug
2005-01-16T08:04:00.000Z	ycco	ogra	Cool, but I'm on warty.
2005-01-16T08:04:00.000Z	ogra	ycco	with all the standard packages ?
2005-01-16T08:04:00.000Z	ogra	ycco	no extra repos ?
2005-01-16T08:05:00.000Z	ycco	ogra	well, if Universe is considered "extra" ok...
2005-01-16T08:05:00.000Z	ogra	ycco	nope...univerfse is ok
2005-01-16T08:05:00.000Z	ogra	ycco	but some ppl mix hoary and warty (which is bad) or warty and debian sid (which is really evil)

2005-01-16T08:15:00.000Z	ycco	ogra	heh, where do I put the vga=791 again?  it didn't take.
