2011-01-22T22:30:00.000Z	themusicgod1		what should I be reading about to get audio from my microphone-in?   It was working until 10.04, I upgraded to 10.10 and it's still not working...would it be useful to go to natty?
2011-01-22T22:31:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	no You should only use stable releases unless you are crazy ubuntu geek
2011-01-22T22:31:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	but we can troubleshoot your audo here
2011-01-22T22:32:00.000Z	themusicgod1	dotblank	i am a pretty crazy geek but lately i just haven't had time to devote to it :(

2011-01-22T22:34:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	and this is with a usb mic?
2011-01-22T22:34:00.000Z	themusicgod1	dotblank	no -- i have 3-4 regular headphone-plug microphones
2011-01-22T22:44:00.000Z	themusicgod1	dotblank	would it be easier to get a usb mic working?  I could try to get one if so.
2011-01-22T22:45:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	nah it should be easy witha  regular one
2011-01-22T22:50:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	try using the command parec
2011-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	themusicgod1	dotblank	i'm guessing that appears to pull data from somewhere(mic?)...in the past I could have catted it to /dev/dsp if it was a raw recording but I'm finding I don't have one of those anymore. How should I play it?
2011-01-22T22:53:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	you could cat it into paplay
2011-01-22T22:55:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	yea i'm checking that too
2011-01-22T22:56:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	you could try loading a loopback module to hear the mic
2011-01-22T22:57:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	pactl load-module module-loopback
2011-01-22T22:59:00.000Z	themusicgod1	dotblank	i owe you a beer
2011-01-22T22:59:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	so I take it the mic does indeed work now?
2011-01-22T23:00:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	well that means it should work with any recording system that uses pulse.. which means nothing is wrong with the mic
2011-01-22T23:05:00.000Z	themusicgod1	dotblank	now pactl doesn't seem to want to let me remove the loopback....
2011-01-22T23:05:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	you have to remove by module index number which varies by platform
2011-01-22T23:06:00.000Z	dotblank	themusicgod1	err I mean by module load order
