2006-08-27T08:46:00.000Z	don_jr		I downloaded a file now I can't figure out how to find/run it.  what command can I use to find where a file is?
2006-08-27T08:46:00.000Z	don_jr		Rookie thanx
2006-08-27T08:48:00.000Z	don_jr		Rookie will the updatedb take a while? I put it in, it asked for the sudo pw, I gave it, now it's just sittin there...
2006-08-27T08:49:00.000Z	don_jr		Rookie okay I'll leave it be for a bit
2006-08-27T08:50:00.000Z	don_jr		Rookie should I run updatedb often? or will it do it it's self ever?
2006-08-27T08:50:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	I like to run it in a nightly cron job
2006-08-27T08:51:00.000Z	don_jr	trappist	excuse my ignorance, this is my first nix system ever, just installed it yesterday, what's a cron job?
2006-08-27T08:51:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	cron is a service that runs commands on a schedule.  nightly, for example.
2006-08-27T08:52:00.000Z	don_jr	trappist	is that something I have to script myself or is it build into gnome or something?
2006-08-27T08:52:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	according to Rookie- it's already set up as a cron job, so not necessary
2006-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	how did you download it
2006-08-27T08:57:00.000Z	don_jr	trappist	through the synoptics
2006-08-27T08:57:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	what package
2006-08-27T08:57:00.000Z	don_jr	trappist	tintin++
2006-08-27T08:58:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	tt++
2006-08-27T08:58:00.000Z	don_jr	trappist	if that works great, but how did you find that out so I can know how to find it if something similar happens again
2006-08-27T08:59:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	it installs to /usr/games/tt++ (which is hopefully in your $PATH)
2006-08-27T08:59:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	dpkg -L tintin++ to see a list of files installed by the package
2006-08-27T08:59:00.000Z	don_jr	trappist	okay, thanx
2006-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	don_jr	trappist	why won't it show up in my games menu under applications then? do I need to killall gnome?
2006-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	possibly the package doesn't come with a menu entry
2006-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	trappist	don_jr	I'm not a gnome user, so I don't know how the menu works, but if it never does show up feel free to file a bug report on the package
