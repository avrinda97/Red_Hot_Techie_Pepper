2009-07-15T00:20:00.000Z	alexnet		How come the users that belong to mygroup can't create files?
2009-07-15T00:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	where
2009-07-15T00:21:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	i createda  group called apacheandfriends, i added www-data and myself to that group.. but neither www-data nor I can create files.  the folder is called /folder/ and has rwxrwxr-x root:apacheandfriends
2009-07-15T00:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	what error you get when you try ?
2009-07-15T00:23:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	PErmission denied
2009-07-15T00:23:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	here is ls -l drwxrwxr-x 7 root apacheandfriends 4096 2009-07-14 12:20 folder
2009-07-15T00:24:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	if i type "groups myname" i see apacheandfriends in the list of groups
2009-07-15T00:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	well i dunno what's happening it should "just work"
2009-07-15T00:28:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	maybe its cause im connecting remotely
2009-07-15T00:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	it should not matter
2009-07-15T00:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	i did a quick test here and it worked...
2009-07-15T00:29:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	well im not sure if ive done other things wrong.. im fairly new to ubuntu... but i was juggling permissions between me:mygroup, root:mygroup, www-data:mygroup... and only the owner ever actually had permissions
2009-07-15T00:30:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	well im not sure if ive done other things wrong.. im fairly new to ubuntu... but i was juggling permissions between me:mygroup, root:mygroup, www-data:mygroup... and only the owner ever actually had permissions
2009-07-15T00:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	weird...
2009-07-15T00:30:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	and i created the group mygroup while SSH'd into the box
2009-07-15T00:31:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	and it wasnt until i disconencted just now and reconnected that the group took effect
2009-07-15T00:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	you are sure folder has w permissions for group ?
2009-07-15T00:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	well that's normal if you created the group in the session
2009-07-15T00:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	you have to log in again afaik
2009-07-15T00:31:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	ah is there anything else like that?
2009-07-15T00:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	alexnet	no; after the new group/memebership takes effect you should be able to create files in a folder your group(s) have w permision for
2009-07-15T00:33:00.000Z	alexnet	erUSUL	okay thank you
