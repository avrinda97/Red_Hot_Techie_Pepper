2005-03-04T16:40:00.000Z	delltony		anyone using hoary mind posting their sources.list to a paste sight so i can take a look at it please?
2005-03-04T12:39:00.000Z	delltony		is there a winrar equiv in linux? or just simply use unrar?
2005-03-04T12:39:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	or rar.
2005-03-11T13:27:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	eh, you just need to uncomment the relevant section in ~/.bash_profile
2005-03-19T13:39:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	vsftpd
2005-03-19T13:41:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	proftpd won't by default. It forces you to read the documntation.
2005-03-19T13:41:00.000Z	delltony	crimsun	thanks for that ;)
2005-03-19T13:41:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	I meant the READMEs in /usr/share/doc/proftpd/

2005-03-23T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	are you running Hoary?
2005-03-23T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	those errors are due to the same ABI breakage that's affecting Nvidia and ATI binary-only users
2005-03-23T11:44:00.000Z	delltony	crimsun	i updated the bug report on bugzilla so maybe some one can get a grasp of whats going on here thanks for your help

2005-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	did you try pmount /dev/sda1 ?
2005-04-28T08:19:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	in that case, what does dmesg tell you regarding the floppy drive?
2005-04-28T08:19:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	if it's usb, it'll use usb storage, so it should appear as /dev/sdXX
2005-04-28T08:20:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	good, so you'd ''pmount /dev/sda1 something,,
2005-04-28T08:21:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	and it should appear under /media/something

2005-04-28T09:07:00.000Z	crimsun	delltony	I'm afraid I don't know offhand, sorry, but resourceful use of search engines would benefit. :)
