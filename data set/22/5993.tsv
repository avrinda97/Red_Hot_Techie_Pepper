2007-01-09T10:59:00.000Z	BlenderKitty		seriously, has ANYone in here had any luck with Bluetooth in ubuntu?
2007-01-09T10:59:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	no, but I havent tried too hard to fix it
2007-01-09T11:03:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	yes
2007-01-09T11:03:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	so I should be downloading a 64 bit image of xubuntu?
2007-01-09T11:03:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	If you want a 64 bit OS, then yeah, but you can run the regular 32 bit version fine
2007-01-09T11:04:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	Some stuff might not work quite right in the 64 bit install though, so beware
2007-01-09T11:04:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	if I install the 64 bit version, do I have less programs to choose from, or are the repos the same?
2007-01-09T11:05:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	You'll probly have the same amount of programs, but certain things may not work, or you may have to jump through hoops to get working
2007-01-09T11:05:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	like flash and stuff
2007-01-09T11:06:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	ok, I'm just going to do 32bit for now then
2007-01-09T11:06:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	That is a wise choice, most apps are not optimized for 64 bit yet anyway, so the performance gains are minimal
2007-01-09T11:07:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	You installing edgy or dapper?
2007-01-09T11:07:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	xubuntu, to be precise
2007-01-09T11:08:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	With dapper, your cdrom may or may not work, also be sure you install the SMP kernel when its set up
2007-01-09T11:08:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	whats SMP?
2007-01-09T11:08:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	SMP enables both cores
2007-01-09T11:08:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	nice!
2007-01-09T11:09:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	What motherboard do you have?  (I have a C2D also)
2007-01-09T11:09:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	good question. I'm not sure. I'm on a thinkpad.
2007-01-09T11:11:00.000Z	jinx099	BlenderKitty	At any rate, be sure you have see SMP when you do a 'uname -a' when you're up and running
2007-01-09T11:11:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	I will check now
2007-01-09T11:12:00.000Z	BlenderKitty	jinx099	ok, its there
