2007-12-25T18:53:00.000Z	Condoulo		any GRUB experts in the house? :P
2007-12-25T18:55:00.000Z	Condoulo		if my current main hard drive is (0,0), would my Windows drive be (0,1)
2007-12-25T18:56:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	depends.. according to what numbering scheme? grub?
2007-12-25T18:58:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	(hd0,4) would be the 4th partition on the first harddrive I think.. you might want to check the grub documentation to be sure though
2007-12-25T18:58:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	(hd1,1) would be the first partition on the second hard drive
2007-12-25T19:00:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	as I said.. check the documentation..  =)
2008-04-10T22:57:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	it's a USB microphone? does it need drivers?
2008-04-10T22:58:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	seems you're not the only one having problems.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=529554
2008-04-10T23:02:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	and here's a guy that claims it works nicely http://jyquentel.wordpress.com/category/ubuntu/   I guess it's  pro 1p, con 1p =)
2008-04-10T23:04:00.000Z	Condoulo	Slart	sad thing is, I've already tried that
2008-04-10T23:12:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	huh? try running something else that uses the microphone.. audacity.. or the plain sound recorder
2008-04-10T23:15:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	very strange.. don't really know what makes it do that.. but I'm not very good with alsa and sound.. perhaps someone else knows
2008-04-10T23:16:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	well.. is it a stero microphone?
2008-05-29T03:31:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	put a gksudo in front of the command
2008-05-29T03:32:00.000Z	Condoulo	Slart	Thanks. :)
2009-05-10T00:54:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	run gnome partition editor and see what the windows partition is called?
2009-05-10T00:54:00.000Z	Condoulo	Slart	tried that. I see the partition mount point, but thats not what I'm looking for =/
2009-05-10T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	in the lower part of the gpart window the partitions are listed.. the first column should be the device name
2009-05-10T00:56:00.000Z	Condoulo	Slart	wait. Would /dev/sda1 be (hd0,1)
2009-05-10T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	nope.. sda1 is hd0,0
2009-05-10T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	grub starts counting from 0
2009-05-10T00:57:00.000Z	Slart	Condoulo	no worries.. you're a bit wiser, a few seconds older.. and soon, blessed with a bootable windows partition ;)
