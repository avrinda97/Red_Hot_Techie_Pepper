2008-02-12T08:53:00.000Z	Jangari		probably not
2008-02-12T08:53:00.000Z	Jangari		in fact i doubt it has its own chan
2008-02-12T08:53:00.000Z	Jangari		use thunderbird instead
2008-02-12T08:53:00.000Z	Jangari		ah
2008-02-12T08:54:00.000Z	Jangari		does anyone know how to get my laptop switching off the speakers when headphones are plugged in?
2008-02-12T08:55:00.000Z	Jangari		i do, hold on, but i doubt it's the headphones, as the same headphones worked well under windows,
2008-02-12T08:56:00.000Z	frank23	Jangari	try playing the the switches in the sound mixer
2008-02-12T08:56:00.000Z	frank23	Jangari	there might be a switch that disables speakers when headphones are plugged in
2008-02-12T08:57:00.000Z	Jangari		i think it's software, since the same laptop under windows used to disable the speakers like i wanted
2008-02-12T08:58:00.000Z	Jangari		but there ain't nothing in prefs > sound
2008-02-12T08:58:00.000Z	Jangari		mm
2008-02-12T08:58:00.000Z	frank23	Jangari	did you look in the sound mixer app? the one with the different channels (Master, PCM...)
2008-02-12T08:58:00.000Z	Jangari		surely some geek could come up with a bugfix
2008-02-12T08:58:00.000Z	frank23	Jangari	in KDE it's KMix not sure about gnome
2008-02-12T08:59:00.000Z	Jangari		hp... um....
2008-02-12T08:59:00.000Z	Jangari		hp "compaq" nc6220
2008-02-12T08:59:00.000Z	Jangari		work machine
2008-02-12T09:00:00.000Z	Jangari	frank23	i can't find that app
2008-02-12T09:00:00.000Z	Jangari		should i have it by default?
2008-02-12T09:01:00.000Z	Jangari		on reflection kaoticsnow, i don't know about ubuntu server, but ubuntu desktop has it in internet > terminal server client
2008-02-12T09:01:00.000Z	frank23	Jangari	I don't know I don't run gnome. But there must be some program you can use to try the sound switches. Or just use alsamixer in the terminal directly
