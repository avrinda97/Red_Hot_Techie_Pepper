Does Ubuntu provide a similar graphical tool?

2010-07-12T21:51:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	schemas are just templates for actual keys, they are generally imported when an app is installed, and a copy is added to /usr/share/gconf/schemas
2010-07-12T21:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	Thank you for your general remarks. But I have put a specific question.
2010-09-22T19:55:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	I believe in lucid, indicator applet session communicates with upower through dbus, calling org.freedesktop.UPower.Hibernate(), then lets upower handle it, what upower does after that, I don't know
2010-09-22T20:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	'man upower': "upower - UPower command line tool." Do you mean this?
2010-09-22T20:05:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	well, upowerd, but yes that is related, but that is not what indicator applet uses. upowerd exposes functions though dbus that other applications can call, and that is what indicator applet session uses (I believe, from a quick glance at the code previously)...if you installed d-feet, you could navigate on the system bus to org.freedesktop.upower and see all the functions it exposes (hibernate, canhibernate, suspend, cans

2010-09-22T20:10:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	that was basically the end of my message, I was just listing several methods exposed by the upower dbus service
2010-09-22T20:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	upowerd is rather new to me. I am going to do some snooping. --  Thank you very much for your help.
2010-09-22T20:11:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	you're welcome, hope you find what you're looking for
2010-09-22T20:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	Thank you again.

2011-01-04T10:30:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	go to Edit/Collection and you can add and remove directories that exaile searches
2011-01-04T10:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	I know that. But your message does not answer my question.  --  My question related to the file hierarchy on my computer.
2011-04-04T06:30:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	sqlite3 introduced a new database format that isn't compatible with the new version, and some apps haven't upgraded
2011-04-04T06:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	Ah! Thank you very much for explaining.
2011-06-07T08:40:00.000Z	trism	bullgard4	noscript can block flash/java applets in addition to javascript, if it blocks one of those, it is counted with the object tags
2011-06-07T08:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	Ah! Thank you very much for explaining.

2011-07-27T22:22:00.000Z	bullgard4	trism	I found your statement very useful and could confirm using another Lucid computer of mine.  --  Thank you very much for your help.
