2008-05-04T03:25:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	no, it doesn't.
2008-05-04T03:22:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	it's compatible with Ubuntu.
2008-05-04T03:23:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	is there a deb or do i need to use specific manual settings in my FTP program?
2008-05-04T03:24:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	http://packages.linuxmint.com/pool/main/m/mintupload/mintupload_1.4_all.deb
2008-05-04T03:24:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	thanks! I take it this adds the right click functionality to a file?
2008-05-04T03:25:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	for this you need to set up nautilus-actions
2008-05-04T03:25:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	fair enough
2008-05-04T03:26:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	btw, when's the new version of mint released?
2008-05-04T03:27:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	sometime in May.
2008-05-04T03:27:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	I look forward to it!
2008-05-04T03:28:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	me too, I look forward to stop working on it :)
2008-05-04T03:28:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	:)
2008-05-04T03:48:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	I installed the package - should a menu item appear or do i need to run through terminal? Also, where to i go about adding a nautilus action?
2008-05-04T03:51:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	sudo apt-get install nautilus-actions
2008-05-04T03:52:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	then you can run the nautilus-actions editor from the menu and configure a launcher to mintUpload for your context menu.
2008-05-04T03:53:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	should this point to the mintupload.py file in /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintupload?
2008-05-04T03:54:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	point it to /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintUpload/mintUpload.py
2008-05-04T03:54:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	with options %d/%f
2008-05-04T03:55:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	thanks. I just tried running from the terminal with errors but i guess i need to include the filename when running. Thanks again for all your help
2008-05-04T03:56:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	yes
2008-05-04T04:03:00.000Z	bachstudies	clem	just tested - working perfectly...many thanks
2008-05-04T04:04:00.000Z	clem	bachstudies	you're welcome.
