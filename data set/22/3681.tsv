2008-06-30T20:05:00.000Z	weezelding		or has someone actually found solution for cracking sound with intel sound card? modprobe and "options snd_hda_intel model=macmini position_fix=2 probe_mask=1" parameters doesn't seem to have any affect

2008-06-30T20:06:00.000Z	weezelding		but let's see
2008-06-30T20:08:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	cracking sound? have you made sure that none of your mixer volumes are at 100%? My sound crackles when my mixers are maxed out.
2008-06-30T20:09:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	only way to recover working sound is boot up (few) times
2008-06-30T20:09:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	do you use kde?
2008-06-30T20:09:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	yep
2008-06-30T20:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	have you turned down the time that arts holds on to the sound card for?
2008-06-30T20:10:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	hmm?
2008-06-30T20:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	sound & multimedia >> soundsystem >> autosuspend if idle after ""
2008-06-30T20:12:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	ah, noup
2008-06-30T20:12:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	let's see
2008-06-30T20:13:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	thanks for in advance
2008-06-30T20:13:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	well if it works, you're welcome.
2008-06-30T20:15:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	sorry, I missed that problem. I just dragged my lazy @$$ out of bed.
2008-06-30T20:15:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	:)
2008-06-30T20:16:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	getting a blanked screen after random time in Xorg. restarting kdm won't do anything, neither loading i915 again. only way to get it up and running again is boot
2008-06-30T20:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	it sounds to me like apm isn't working for you. you should be able to adjust the power settings in kde
2008-06-30T20:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	or apci
2008-06-30T20:19:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	yep, probably. I think sometime I got error about running out of video memory
2008-06-30T20:20:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	weezelding	that's odd. what video card do you have?
2008-06-30T20:21:00.000Z	weezelding	Seven_Six_Two	but i cannot remember which update broke it
