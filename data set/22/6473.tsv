2006-10-31T15:09:00.000Z	blazemonger		i can't find gnome-libs package or gnome-config .....would it be possible to install it from a .deb source?
2006-10-31T15:10:00.000Z	blazemonger		I don't want to  have to leave ubuntu so i can compile sources on freshmeat.net :(
2006-10-31T15:11:00.000Z	blazemonger		i cant find it anywhere in the ubuntu edgy repositories but i was able to find it on debian's site
2006-10-31T15:13:00.000Z	blazemonger		i can't find any way tocompile this
2006-10-31T15:13:00.000Z	blazemonger		trying to compile a mathematics program and it complains of having not found gnome-config and some file in gnome-lib a file named gnomeConf.sh
2006-10-31T15:14:00.000Z	blazemonger		did ubuntu leave anything out of gnome?
2006-10-31T15:14:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	development libraries, headers, and tools are not installed by default... you probably need to install the proper -devel package
2006-10-31T15:16:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	you can search for which package ( if any ) contains a specific file on packages.ubuntu.com
2006-10-31T15:18:00.000Z	blazemonger	PSUSI	I can't find the development files i neeed but they ARE in debian though
2006-10-31T15:18:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	in which package?  they are probably the same in ubuntu
2006-10-31T15:18:00.000Z	blazemonger	PSUSI	gnome-libs and gnome-config
2006-10-31T15:19:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	have you installed gnome-libs?
2006-10-31T15:35:00.000Z	blazemonger	PSUSI	I'm still not having any luck..would switching to a distro that has those packages work? or would it be easier to just install mandriva
2006-10-31T15:36:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	try reading the readme in this package... it should tell you what libraries you need to build it, and are you sure you don't have the files already and it just isn't finding them ( not looking in the right place? )?
2006-10-31T15:42:00.000Z	blazemonger	PSUSI	i can't find anything with the name of gnome-libs or gnome-config
2006-10-31T15:43:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	I see gnome-libs-data
2006-10-31T15:46:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	try libgnome-dev.... and do you have a specific file name it says it can't find?
2006-10-31T15:49:00.000Z	blazemonger	PSUSI	is mandriva easier than ubuntu?
2006-10-31T15:50:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	I have no knowlege of mandriva
2006-10-31T15:50:00.000Z	blazemonger	PSUSI	how can i find the files i need
2006-10-31T15:51:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	did you try the libdev package I sugested?  or searching for the file on packages.ubuntu.com?
2006-10-31T15:52:00.000Z	PSUSI	blazemonger	then go download the sourece tarball yourself
