2012-02-25T12:47:00.000Z	brkolog		 anyone knows how to see what directory vsftpd uses as root?
2012-02-25T12:48:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	by default /etc/vsftpd.conf
2012-02-25T12:49:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	by default (it would be set within) /etc/vsftpd.conf
2012-02-25T12:49:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	thanks, I'll look again, didn't find it in that file before
2012-02-25T12:50:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	it's probably going to be /var/ftp/
2012-02-25T12:53:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	I'll try that too
2012-02-25T12:54:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	actually https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/ftp-server.html says it's /home/ftp/
2012-02-25T12:56:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	It didn't create the directory,
2012-02-25T12:57:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	you can always create it yourself and change it to whatever you want, i suppose
2012-02-25T12:57:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	local access worked but another machine didn't list any files, I'll try again
2012-02-25T12:57:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	yes, I did create i
2012-02-25T12:58:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	maybe it's the client (explorer)
2012-02-25T12:59:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	absent some (mis)configuration you should see the same dir contents ftping in with the same credentials from any posture
2012-02-25T13:06:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	I tried filezilla there and it listed the files but it uses my home folder in ubuntu as root it seems. had the same issue using pureadmin as ftp server.
2012-02-25T13:06:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	what do you want it to use
2012-02-25T13:07:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	/home/ftp for example
2012-02-25T13:08:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	who are you ftping in as
2012-02-25T13:11:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	you can create an ftp user with homedir /home/ftp
2012-02-25T13:12:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	windows seems to screw up though, doesn't ask me for credentials just shows an empty ftp server
2012-02-25T13:12:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	browser's ftp mode generally logs in as anonymous
2012-02-25T13:13:00.000Z	humungulous	brkolog	if you want a cleaner test from windows do it from the command line
2012-02-25T13:18:00.000Z	brkolog	humungulous	it seems to work, it shows my homedir in ubuntu, humungulous . I just need one file, but filezilla downloaded at 50kb/s. That could be a Virtualbox issue, those are both virtual machines. :P
