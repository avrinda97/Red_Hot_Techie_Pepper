2007-07-12T06:21:00.000Z	viden		How do i make metacity my default window manager?  When i do metacity --replace in a terminal it says : Window manager warning: "" found in configuration database is not a valid value for keybinding "toggle_shaded".  And when i close that terminal window metacity goes away.

2007-07-12T06:26:00.000Z	asc__	viden	Uh, can you select metacity from the 'session' list in gdm?
2007-07-12T06:26:00.000Z	viden	asc__	  you mean add it as a startup item ?
2007-07-12T06:27:00.000Z	asc__	viden	When the login screen comes up, there's usually a button that lets you select different WMs.
2007-07-12T06:28:00.000Z	asc__	viden	Although I have to admit I have no idea how one starts metacity, since it's already installed and I don't think it appears in that list for me.
2007-07-12T06:28:00.000Z	viden	asc__	 you mean the options button .. yeah the options are gnome and gnome failsafe ... or run the script ... all do the same thing it appears.  Beryl some how screwed up things when i uninstalled it
2007-07-12T06:28:00.000Z	asc__	viden	Okay. How are you starting metacity?
2007-07-12T06:29:00.000Z	viden	asc__	 well at the moment i have to start it from the terminal to get my window title bars .. but it has a failure of some sort and i cant close that terminal
2007-07-12T06:30:00.000Z	asc__	viden	Is the terminal in X?
2007-07-12T06:30:00.000Z	viden	asc__	 yes
2007-07-12T06:31:00.000Z	viden	asc__	 i have to leave the terminal window open because if i close it metacity dies with it
2007-07-12T06:32:00.000Z	asc__	viden	okay. This probably isn't what you want to do. But one thing you *can* do is disable GDM (install sysv-rc-conf and just uncheck its' little box). The make a file ~/.xsession containing the lines '#/bin/bash' and 'metacity'. At that point, it will boot to a terminal, you can log in, and running 'startx' should start metacity.
2007-07-12T06:32:00.000Z	asc__	viden	Another possibility is that I'm tripping hard.

2007-07-12T06:33:00.000Z	viden	asc__	 can i just go edit the xsession file to fix this ?
2007-07-12T06:34:00.000Z	asc__	viden	Well, the xsession file is useless if GDm is running. But that's basicly what I'm suggesting.
2007-07-12T06:34:00.000Z	asc__	viden	Unless there's more xsession files somewhere that I don't know about. Which there probably are.
2007-07-12T06:34:00.000Z	viden	asc__	 could i just go to term2 and kill gdm and then edit the file ?
2007-07-12T06:35:00.000Z	viden	asc__	 currently i dont have a file on my system called .xsession
