2008-01-11T01:19:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	Do you have a FAT partition?
2008-01-11T01:20:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	I like using grub4dos. Easy to use, no need to change MBR/boot sectors.
2008-01-11T01:20:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	Originaly I had vista, then i installed ubuntu on same drive, then i wiped vista partition to install XP, I just need to put grub back on
2008-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	but i have fat32 formated external drive spare
2008-01-11T01:22:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	Besides the DOS exe, I never used other grub variants, so I'm not sure of the details. If it was an MBR install and the only change is XP writing its own, I guess just let grub rewrite its MBR.
2008-01-11T01:22:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	yeah thats what i want to do :) just unsure how without running a linux installer disk
2008-01-11T01:23:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	atm ive booted the ubuntu disk and opened a tty, Id asumed i could do it in here somehow! :P
2008-01-11T01:23:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	Hopefully. :)
2008-01-11T01:24:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	Is there grub-install?
2008-01-11T01:24:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	just trying to mount the CD atm, only tempfs and basic tools right now
2008-01-11T01:25:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	Why not the GUI CD?
2008-01-11T01:26:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	I didnt download it =s
2008-01-11T01:26:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	Might be quicker, depending on your connection speed. :) Though, I'm not sure how safe it is just to "grub-install /dev/hda".
2008-01-11T01:33:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	only the deb file for grub-installer on the disk, ill go download the live cd :)
2008-01-11T01:34:00.000Z	ZiNC	g0rb3hy	Maybe you should read the grub docs, I'm not sure about the details from that point on. :)
2008-01-11T01:45:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	I didnt download it =s
2008-01-11T01:46:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	oops
2008-01-11T01:46:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	Ran rescue mode from alternate disk, it let me mount the old linux FS and run the grbu installer package
2008-01-11T01:47:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	just had to do grub-install /dev/sda1 its given me back grub and the linux partions but windows aint bootable, i can fix that in linux now tho :)
2008-01-11T01:48:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	which makes me think it was never really 'deleted' by windows
2008-01-11T01:49:00.000Z	g0rb3hy	ZiNC	imo its linux karma :) Ubuntu is doing eveything on my system now except for games, thats why i downgraded vista to xp :)
