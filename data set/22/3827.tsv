2008-10-03T08:07:00.000Z	Trev		When I go to install ubuntu and it comes to the disk partitioning step in the process I can't get past it.  I'm missing one of the partition options. (the one I need)
2008-10-03T08:07:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	which option you need?
2008-10-03T08:08:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	which option are you missing
2008-10-03T08:10:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	you dont have that option because you probably dont have any free space, what you need to do is ,,,, press Alt-F2, and type "gksudo gparted" and shrink your current windows partition to whatever size you want, and leave some "free space", then restart the installer and you will have that option
2008-10-03T08:11:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	:free space" in the partitioiner means, space which is not formated (or outside any existing partitions)
2008-10-03T08:13:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	how large are them?
2008-10-03T08:13:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	do they have anything inside?
2008-10-03T08:13:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	are they formated to any type of filesystem?
2008-10-03T08:15:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	umm, then the option of "use largest continous...." should be enabled, would you mind sending me a screenshot of "gparted" showing your partitions?
2008-10-03T08:17:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	the program gparted, you can launch it by typing Alt+F2, then type "gksudo gparted"
2008-10-03T08:18:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	ohh, nvm then
2008-10-03T08:19:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	problem is that windows vista wont see any "ext3" partition or linux type partition,  have you tryied installing linux before?
2008-10-03T08:19:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	well,  may i see the info on your vista partitioner?
2008-10-03T08:20:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	k, gime a sev
2008-10-03T08:23:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	you should be good by removing all the "green stuff" which is a secondary partition (i duno why they are there, they arent been used anyways), once you delete that, you will end up with "unallocated space" which whill be usable by the ubuntu installer
2008-10-03T08:24:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	did you partitioned  your hdd before?, or those partitions came like that by default?
2008-10-03T08:25:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	you cant?, any error message?
2008-10-03T08:25:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	which error
2008-10-03T08:27:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	id try to delete them with gparted (in the live cd), gparted is ubuntu partitioner, once you are in the live cd, type alt-F2 and type "gksudo gparted" to launch it
2008-10-03T08:28:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	if you still have problems, id be glad to keep helping, you can contact me by sending me a private message through ubuntu forums to "sam_delta"
2008-10-03T08:28:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	id try ubuntu partitioner (to delete those partitions)
2008-10-03T08:28:00.000Z	sam_delta	Trev	no proble, have a nice day
