2006-04-22T09:05:00.000Z	CompuChip_		Hi
2006-04-22T09:05:00.000Z	CompuChip_		I just did my first Ubuntu install. It got to the end of the procedure and I removed the CD and rebooted as requested, but now it asks for a runlevel
2006-04-22T09:06:00.000Z	CompuChip_		Can anyone tell me what to do :)
2006-04-22T09:07:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	2
2006-04-22T09:08:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	at what point is it asking you this? from the grub boot menu?
2006-04-22T09:08:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	why LILO?
2006-04-22T09:09:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	Why LILO???
2006-04-22T09:10:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	unless you have hardware specific reasons to use LILO, you should use GRUB. It's newer and better.
2006-04-22T09:10:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	not easily
2006-04-22T09:11:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	... strange
2006-04-22T09:12:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	how did you setup your partitions? the only thing I can think of is that you have a working /boot partition but something is wrong with your / (root) partition.
2006-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	so much for my missing root idea.
2006-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	reboot and try "S" in the runlevel prompt
2006-04-22T09:15:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	again tho, how did you setup the partitions?
2006-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	automatic or manually?
2006-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	it seems something is wrong with your root partition...
2006-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	willing to try the automatic partition setup?
2006-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	reinstall and use the automatic partitioning option.
2006-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	breezy or dapper?
2006-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	both times?
2006-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	try auto partition and if it seems to work OK after it's done, please file a bug.
2006-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	CompuChip_	up to u... expert takes a lot longer
