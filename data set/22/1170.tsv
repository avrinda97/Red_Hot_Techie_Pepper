2010-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	Evo11		can anyone tell me what will cause a windows machine to stop seeing my ubuntu server?
2010-09-30T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	can the windows system ping the server by ip and/or name?
2010-09-30T11:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	then it can see it
2010-09-30T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	ah, that's different
2010-09-30T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	look into samba and the smb.conf file if the sever is without desktop
2010-09-30T11:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	how are you sharing the folders?
2010-09-30T11:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	did you share via nautilus per chance?
2010-09-30T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	"just sharing" doesn't exist
2010-09-30T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	you can share folders using samba, ssh, ftp etc
2010-09-30T11:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	the built in sharing options you set with the file manager (nautilus) are samba shares
2010-09-30T11:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	it abstracts it for you
2010-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	which is annoying as users arekept in the dark which makes support a little harder
2010-09-30T11:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	if you run: smbtree ,on the server. Do you see its shares?
2010-09-30T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	yes
2010-09-30T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	if you run: sudo apt-get install samba ,does it say its already installed?
2010-09-30T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	why did you install the server OS to then put a gui on it like a desktop OS?
2010-09-30T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	if you wanted a desktop system then you should install a desktop system
2010-09-30T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	then installing the desktop OS would have been smarter
2010-09-30T12:13:00.000Z	Evo11	ActionParsnip	should l not try installing samba via Ubuntu software center?
2010-09-30T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	great place to find it. I have no idea how you were sharing before if its not installed
2010-09-30T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	the gui you refer to uses samba dude
2010-09-30T12:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evo11	should do
