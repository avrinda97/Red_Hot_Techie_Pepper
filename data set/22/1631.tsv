2010-03-10T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	what do you want to install ?
2010-03-10T03:47:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	TeeWorlds 1.5.2
2010-03-10T03:47:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	Software manager and synaptic only have 1.5.1
2010-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	what's in 1.5.2 that's not in 1.5.1 ?
2010-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	Not sure, but I was told to upgrade to help with sound issues
2010-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	I suggest you don't upgrade unless you know what you're doing and have a solid reason to
2010-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	and generally, I would like to know how to install a .tar.gz file
2010-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	I'd advise to log a bug/upgrade request on launchpad.net
2010-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	okay...
2010-03-10T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	if you untar it there are files called README and INSTALL
2010-03-10T03:49:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	generally, is it bad to have to install .tar.bz files manually?
2010-03-10T03:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	only if you are not %101 sure of what you are doing and how it will effect your system and other applications
2010-03-10T03:51:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	so normally stick with packages
2010-03-10T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	unless you have a reason not to
2010-03-10T04:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	install the package flashplugin-nonfree
2010-03-10T04:05:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	from synaptic?
2010-03-10T04:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	yes
2010-03-10T04:05:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	ok so flash is a no-no?
2010-03-10T04:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	errr, I've just told you how to install it, how is that a no-no ?
2010-03-10T04:06:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	oh just wasnt sure if it was adobe flash or not
2010-03-10T04:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Desciero	it certainly is
2010-03-10T04:06:00.000Z	Desciero	ikonia	ah ok
