2012-09-03T04:23:00.000Z	TheMiner		znudnee are you trying to run the installer from within Windows or are you booting from the disc?
2012-09-03T04:24:00.000Z	TheMiner		did you verify the md5 of the disc?
2012-09-03T04:24:00.000Z	lauratika	TheMiner	in this case yes
2012-09-03T04:25:00.000Z	TheMiner		Who is the manufacturer? I would love to go and see that warranty
2012-09-03T04:26:00.000Z	lauratika		lenovo
2012-09-03T04:27:00.000Z	lauratika		they say warranty may be void if OS changes
2012-09-03T04:29:00.000Z	lauratika		officedepot
2012-09-03T04:29:00.000Z	lauratika		i know!
2012-09-03T04:29:00.000Z	lauratika		thats what they said
2012-09-03T04:29:00.000Z	TheMiner		I would not do business with a manufacturer that would void warranties for someone trying to get out of a closed source operating system
2012-09-03T04:29:00.000Z	lauratika		because OS is not the one came with the pc
2012-09-03T04:30:00.000Z	lauratika		i know, but buyimng this pc was not my choice
2012-09-03T04:31:00.000Z	lauratika		well a extended 3 year warranty was bought with this pc with that vendor
2012-09-03T04:31:00.000Z	lauratika		only applies in officedepot
2012-09-03T04:31:00.000Z	TheMiner		am wondering if MicroShaft is subsidizing the cost of the warranty,....sounds super shady
2012-09-03T04:32:00.000Z	lauratika		well was not cheap the warranty, but they say the hardware is under warranty for 3 years no matter what happens to the pc.
2012-09-03T04:33:00.000Z	lauratika		but original OS may stay the same, i think because of many pirate copys of windows around.
2012-09-03T04:33:00.000Z	lauratika		exactly ActionParsnip
2012-09-03T04:33:00.000Z	TheMiner		Yeah I wouldnt put it past a company to do that,...first time I have heard of it,...but wouldnt say it never happens
2012-09-03T04:34:00.000Z	lauratika		also this is funny windows 7 will detect wired lan, but ubuntu wont
2012-09-03T04:34:00.000Z	TheMiner	lauratika	that one is easy,...the manufacturer made well sure that all of the components had MS signed drivers available before shipping
2012-09-03T04:35:00.000Z	lauratika	TheMiner	now i only can use wireless connection in ubntu
