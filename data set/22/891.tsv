2012-04-26T00:30:00.000Z	WinCamXP		Does anyone know why my server had a black screen when booting in CLI?
2012-04-26T00:31:00.000Z	WinCamXP		it runs Ubuntu 11.10 Desktop, but I didn't want my DE using too much power
2012-04-26T00:32:00.000Z	alien64	WinCamXP	I tried removing lightdm from the startup and changing GRUB configs <<< without knowing what you edited and put back it would be hard to help
2012-04-26T00:33:00.000Z	WinCamXP	alien64	I changed "quiet splash" to "text" on that one line in the GRUB config
2012-04-26T00:34:00.000Z	alien64		humm that shouldnt have borked nuthin WinCamXP
2012-04-26T00:34:00.000Z	WinCamXP	alien64	should I try update-rc.d -f gdm remove?
2012-04-26T00:35:00.000Z	WinCamXP	alien64	or would "quiet splash text" instead of "text" work?
2012-04-26T00:36:00.000Z	alien64	WinCamXP	researching
2012-04-26T00:37:00.000Z	WinCamXP	alien64	running out of time, gotta leave in 10 mins - I've only tried doing this: a combination of update-rc.d -f lightdm remove and changing the "quiet splash" thing in GRUB to "text"
2012-04-26T00:37:00.000Z	WinCamXP		I've put everything back to dafault though
2012-04-26T00:38:00.000Z	WinCamXP		do you knwo if it's 32 or 64bit?
2012-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	WinCamXP		which are
2012-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	alien64	WinCamXP	replace "quiet splash" with >>> nomodeset
2012-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	WinCamXP		with or without quotes?
2012-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	alien64		if the quates are there keep them
2012-04-26T00:40:00.000Z	WinCamXP		so make it "nomodeset"?
2012-04-26T00:40:00.000Z	alien64	WinCamXP	with them
2012-04-26T00:41:00.000Z	WinCamXP		once I get home i'll try that - alien64: also, I have a paper on how to get wireless working...using iwconfig and ifconfig
2012-04-26T00:41:00.000Z	WinCamXP		i can't put my server where the router is, so I have to survive running servers on wireless - it's fast enough though
2012-04-26T00:41:00.000Z	alien64	WinCamXP	goodluck
2012-04-26T00:42:00.000Z	WinCamXP		worst case scenario I have to go back in as root through recovery, mount the drive as writeable, and edit the configs back again
2012-04-26T00:43:00.000Z	alien64	WinCamXP	yup hopefully will work for you
