2009-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	theclaw		hi
2009-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	theclaw		I upgraded to karmic, but my bootscreen is just a black&white ubuntu logo, and idea?
2009-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	that's the default splash now
2009-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	what's with that new "better" splash?
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	nod, and you can change the theme now either :(
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	mrwes		Anyone on the Handbrake issue?
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	you mean there is no new splash?
2009-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	you can't apply gdm themes now either
2009-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	do you mean there is only *one* bootscreen, the black/white one?
2009-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	mrwes		!ask | ekianjo
2009-10-29T21:44:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	far as I know, yes.
2009-10-29T21:44:00.000Z	theclaw		I can't believe that's true
2009-10-29T21:44:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	I don't think you're right there. It should look like http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Die-Neuerungen-in-Ubuntu-9-10-845450.html?view=zoom;zoom=1
2009-10-29T21:45:00.000Z	theclaw		do I need grub2 for that?
2009-10-29T21:45:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	that's what mine looks like
2009-10-29T21:46:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	but I said it's a black&white ubuntu logo, that's *not* black&white!
2009-10-29T21:46:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	oh...I must be color blind
2009-10-29T21:47:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	I mean like only black&white, and low-res as the old one
2009-10-29T21:47:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	I was slightly upset in the fact you can't apply gdm themes to the login window
2009-10-29T21:48:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	okay, that's another issue :(
2009-10-29T21:48:00.000Z	theclaw	mrwes	:) i mean
2009-10-29T21:50:00.000Z	mrwes	theclaw	yah I was surprised when I found that out, I normally install a beta in a Virtuabox, but didn't have the time this time around.
