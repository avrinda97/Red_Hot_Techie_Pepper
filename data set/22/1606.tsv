2010-03-21T02:58:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	But I can find out
2010-03-21T02:59:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	ok...
2010-03-21T02:59:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	Run " sudo lshw -html >> info.html " in the terminal
2010-03-21T03:00:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	ok i try that
2010-03-21T03:03:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	hmm if i run the "sudo" command it asks for my password... i dont know what that can be!?!? and if i run "firefox" commans i get a blank side
2010-03-21T03:04:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	It's your system asking for authentication, to make sure you're who you say you are.
2010-03-21T03:04:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	And you have to run the info command first
2010-03-21T03:05:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	well... i dont know what password that should be....
2010-03-21T03:06:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	You put it in when you installed ubuntu
2010-03-21T03:07:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	the same as i using when logg in?
2010-03-21T03:07:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	Yes
2010-03-21T03:08:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	that are numbers and i cant press any numbers in the terminal window!!!???
2010-03-21T03:09:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	You can't... input numbers in the terminal!?
2010-03-21T03:10:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	i tried again now but i only end up at prompt...
2010-03-21T03:11:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	i think this might not be for me... all this about programming and things isnt what im used to ;)
2010-03-21T03:19:00.000Z	t3218980	Sanus	now i got a page with my internal specs....
2010-03-21T03:21:00.000Z	Sanus	t3218980	What sort of sound controller does that have?
