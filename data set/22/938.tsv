2011-01-06T09:17:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	i believe tigerdirect has a "build your own" laptop also.
2011-01-06T09:18:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	i've used tigerdirect for years(at least 10) and have probably placed every bit of 15-20k worth of orders from them, been very happy.
2011-01-06T09:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	but the "build to order" laptops, are systemax laptops... . i dunno if tht changes your opinion or not.
2011-01-06T09:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	yeah, they ar located in Illinois, and w/ me being in Indiana... if i order before noon, pay for 7 day shipping, i usually have it at my door the next day around 4:00
2011-01-06T09:23:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	in my experience, yes.
2011-01-06T09:24:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	do this... look at 4-5 models you'd like to try ubuntu on... then get on google, and google "HP xxxx ubuntu 10.10" and see what kind of hits you get
2011-01-06T09:25:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	if you notice one w/ significant problems, then drop it from consideration
2011-01-06T09:25:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	honestly, thats how i bought my acer laptop 5yrs ago... eneded up working out perfectly, right down to the patch fixes to fix my wireless(don't need them anymore)
2011-01-06T09:39:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	your best bet under those circumstances
2011-01-06T09:40:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	get a laptop, or whatever you want, and dual boot, so if you run into an issue you can't immediately figure out, you have windows to fall back on... even if you only leave windows on a small partition... if you bring the laptop home, and immediately nuke windos for ubuntu, w/ your experience level... you'll have windows reinstalled within a week
2011-01-06T09:41:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	then honestly, you'e probably not set it up properly.. dual booting is quite easy
2011-01-10T07:53:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	there's an awesome samba walkthrough on Ubuntuforums...
2011-01-10T07:55:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	i used this back w/ 9.10, and its more or less the same....  http://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202605
2011-01-10T07:56:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	i think the only thing that has changed since that was written, is the start/stop command for samba
2011-01-10T07:56:00.000Z	Danny78	KM0201	 like, service start
2011-01-10T07:57:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	yup>.. :)
2011-01-10T07:57:00.000Z	Danny78	KM0201	I just ran into that change
2011-01-10T07:57:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	yeah..
2011-01-10T08:09:00.000Z	Danny78	KM0201	 I'm strikin' out at step 1--  samba install dnsproxy fails
2011-01-10T08:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	i don't kno anything about that.
2011-01-10T08:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Danny78	i just use samba for simple file sharing
2011-01-10T08:09:00.000Z	Danny78	KM0201	 figured it was worth asking, thanks
