2006-02-27T15:04:00.000Z	dhalgren		yup, xchat
2006-02-27T15:04:00.000Z	dhalgren		sorry, don't know that either
2006-02-27T15:06:00.000Z	dhalgren		automatix is mentioned in a sticky message from hairypoofyguy, believe itor not. it woeks very effectively. i installed jre with this tool
2006-02-27T15:07:00.000Z	dhalgren		wtr: automatix has version 1.5
2006-02-27T15:07:00.000Z	dhalgren		i haven't had the trouble mentioned by ubotu, but it might be wise to thinnk about it ;-)
2006-02-27T15:08:00.000Z	dhalgren		ok, I will take your advice and uninstall it.
2006-02-27T15:09:00.000Z	dhalgren		ok, where do i get easyubuntu?
2006-02-27T15:10:00.000Z	dhalgren		thanks. i will have a look at easyubuntu, and after what has been said, i will think twice about using it also
2006-02-27T15:11:00.000Z	dhalgren		having been told that automatix can mess with config files, could that be the reason why I don't have /dev/radio? :-(
2006-02-27T15:11:00.000Z	dhalgren		i will be very annoyed with myself if it is...
2006-02-27T15:12:00.000Z	wastrel	dhalgren	 ls -l /dev/radio*
2006-02-27T15:12:00.000Z	dhalgren	wastrel	yes, done that. /dev/radio does not exist
2006-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	wastrel	dhalgren	 did you have the wildcard?
2006-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	dhalgren		seveas: ok, so is there a way to get /dev/radio into place?
2006-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	dhalgren	wastrel	not that good at this. How do i use a wildcard?
2006-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	wastrel	dhalgren	 ls -l /dev/radio*    <= the *
2006-02-27T15:15:00.000Z	dhalgren	wastrel	ok, will do that now
2006-02-27T15:15:00.000Z	dhalgren		brb
2006-02-27T15:17:00.000Z	dhalgren	wastrel	answer is that there is no such file or directory. it (bash) didn't like <= the*
2006-02-27T15:17:00.000Z	dhalgren		does that matter?
2006-02-27T15:18:00.000Z	wastrel	dhalgren	 the '*' is the wildcard  it will pick up anything that starts with /dev/radio ,  sudh as /dev/radio0
2006-02-27T15:19:00.000Z	wastrel	dhalgren	 ls -l /dev/radio*
