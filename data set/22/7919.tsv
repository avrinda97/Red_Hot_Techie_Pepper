2005-11-24T13:21:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	right.  :)
2005-11-24T13:15:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	don't forget that gentoo runs more slowly, also
2005-11-24T13:17:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	gentoo only runs more slowly if you go insane with the flags.  pretty much equal otherwise.  takes forever to upgrade tho
2005-11-24T13:18:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	when i've tested, gentoo has always run significantly more slowly.  You have to go insane with the flags to get it to run at the normal speed.
2005-11-24T13:18:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	that's based on actual tests.
2005-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	not been my experience.  i kind of like the way i can fiddle with USE flags to remove subsystems i don't use
2005-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	that's fine, but not related to the performance.
2005-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	what i don't like is the slipshod QA.  i remember when they screwed up an update script and it wiped out all of /usr
2005-11-24T13:19:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	yes, that's definitely a problem
2005-11-24T13:20:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	portage is also kind of an overkill.  i'm partial to ports.  or these days, pkgsource
2005-11-24T13:20:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	gentoo people think they run faster, because they compile, and that's definitely untrue.  So you have lots of costs and no benefits.
2005-11-24T13:20:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	mostly i'm annoyed by folks who think they know about the guts of their system because they watch compiler output scroll by for hours
2005-11-24T13:21:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	i do like ports from freebsd.  if i had an nvidia card instead of an ati, i'd probably be running freebsd now
2005-11-24T13:21:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	I like netbsd; I find its ports to be a bit more reliable than free's
2005-11-24T13:21:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	so i do have sort of a soft spot for gentoo, even if they put a lot of python cruft on top of ports
2005-11-24T13:22:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	yah i've heard pkgsource is better...  it seems to be taking over.  netbsd is pretty to read the source of, but it makes debian look bleeding edge.  it *just* got the TAP ethernet device for crissakes
2005-11-24T13:24:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	true, you trade off stability for up to dateness.  I use netbsd for firewalls, where stability is much more important to me.  Various systems and distros have their uses, even if they aren't your primary workstation system
2005-11-24T13:25:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	been fun chatting, we're probably kind of offtopic tho :) ... gotta get to bed tho
2005-12-22T09:18:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	yes, the installer should pick that up, I'd submit a bug if it isn't fixed yet.
2005-12-23T15:03:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	i wouldn't recommend it for home.  rack boxes are *noisy*
2006-09-23T09:44:00.000Z	sproingie	sethk	ubotu's redirection syntax is just its annoying way of implementing infobot's "tell soandso about <topic>"
2006-09-23T09:44:00.000Z	sethk	sproingie	ok, I misread ubotu and ubuntu I think.  :)
