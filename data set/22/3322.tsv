2009-09-03T05:39:00.000Z	RandomUsr		does anyone know the best way to search all directories for a string w/o printing every file in the directory?
2009-09-03T05:41:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	you can do something like: find . -type f | xargs egrep -i "string"
2009-09-03T05:42:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	"more" in what sense?
2009-09-03T05:43:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	are you looking for the program *named* tsclient, or for any file which mentions tsclient inside it e.g. a documentation file, or both?
2009-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	anything with that string
2009-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	also, will i have to pipe it to grep to get what I want?
2009-09-03T05:45:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	still dunno which you mean: the first choice or the second?
2009-09-03T05:45:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	any file which contains the string tsclient
2009-09-03T05:47:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	the command you provided appears to be what I'm looking for. thanks
2009-09-03T05:48:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	then you want: find . -type f | xargs egrep "tsclient". And I still don't know what you mean when you say you get 'more' than you wanted...
2009-09-03T05:48:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	"more" than I wanted means every file in / is what I was getting. regardless of whether I wanted it or not
2009-09-03T05:49:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	I was doing find / "tsclient"
2009-09-03T05:50:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	 find / "tsclient" is definitely not correct syntax, so that explains it...
2009-09-03T05:51:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	so then, do I have to pipe to some incarnation of grep?
2009-09-03T05:52:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	the grep part is what selects only the files containing the tsclient string, so you can't really dispose of it...
2009-09-03T05:54:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	eminor's command should work too. The "find" part is disposable, but not the "grep" part
2009-09-03T05:55:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	then find is pretty much useless by itself or alone?
2009-09-03T05:57:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	the find part is useful if you need more options e.g. only files less than 10 days old, or greater than a certain size, or some such...
2009-09-03T06:01:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	does sudo still work for you? It uses the same password as your regular login..
2009-09-03T06:01:00.000Z	RandomUsr	losher	sort of
2009-09-03T06:02:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	you are a master of the enigmatic phrase...
2009-09-03T06:05:00.000Z	losher	RandomUsr	because fedora isn't ubuntu... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword
