2009-12-15T22:16:00.000Z	m0ar		Hi, I'd like help changing my background picture for the logon screen. Using gnome.
2009-12-15T22:17:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	iirc the GDM currently in use by the latest ubuntu doesnt support theming at all
2009-12-15T22:20:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	Then whan may I change it to? :)  I want it to bee good looking ;D
2009-12-15T22:23:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	Or rather, what is aviable for graphical login managers? :)  Changing it i'll manage
2009-12-15T22:23:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	KDM is KDE's Display Manager, i fancy it personally
2009-12-15T22:23:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	Oh, is it themeable? :)
2009-12-15T22:24:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	indeed.  last i checked
2009-12-15T22:24:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	Thanks
2009-12-15T22:24:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	but that was back for using kde 3.5
2009-12-15T22:24:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	i would imagine nothing has changed in terms themeability
2009-12-15T22:24:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	I'll check it out, thanks
2009-12-15T22:25:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	Will changing to KDM make any other diffrence than my logon?
2009-12-15T22:26:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	its gunna install a bunch of packages subsequently, but youll still be able to select "Gnome" for your desktop environment at the login screen
2009-12-15T22:26:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	mind you you'll need to chmod -x /etc/init.d/gdm for kdm to step in
2009-12-15T22:27:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	What'll that do? :)
2009-12-15T22:27:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	takes executeable permission away from GDM, so KDM can step in
2009-12-15T22:27:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	Ah, thanks
2009-12-15T22:27:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	otherwise theyll engage in battle
2009-12-15T22:28:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	That line doesn't work, it demands a "missing operand after /etc/init.d/gdm"
2009-12-15T22:29:00.000Z	portn0k	m0ar	? sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/gdm
2009-12-15T22:59:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	Hey, that didn't go very well D:
2009-12-15T23:00:00.000Z	m0ar	portn0k	I didn't set my session to Gnome, So i logged into KDE without anny packages :D Empty, screen with only a console. yay :D
