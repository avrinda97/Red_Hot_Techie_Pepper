2008-10-30T19:06:00.000Z	n8tuser		Mb81-> remote connectino is not done via socket,
2008-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	n8tuser		Mb81-> you have to correct your jdbc connect string
2008-10-30T19:08:00.000Z	n8tuser		joaopinto-> what does php called their connectivity? im just to java, using jdbc :P
2008-10-30T19:09:00.000Z	n8tuser		same concept, its a data connector, for database
2008-10-30T19:10:00.000Z	n8tuser		Mb81-> you are connecting to remote and not local. so change the connect string to connect to remote
2008-10-30T19:12:00.000Z	n8tuser		Mb81-> it is the client you are configuring here, not the server, but also make sure the server at the remote end allows network connections
2008-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	n8tuser		Mb81-> just like the error you are getting, socket error which means it is attempting a localhost connection instead of remote
2008-10-30T19:15:00.000Z	n8tuser		Mb81-> have you looked at the mysql tutorials?  please do if you have not yet
2008-10-30T19:16:00.000Z	n8tuser		Mb81-> same thing, look at the tutorials on how to use php-cli
2008-10-30T19:18:00.000Z	n8tuser		weirdo-> please your language...btw use a fresh install instead of upgrade
2008-10-30T19:18:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	do not recommended a fresh install over an upgrade !
2008-10-30T19:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	I had the same idea, but the upgrade process is expected to be more reliable nowadays
2008-10-31T01:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	it's /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/
2008-10-31T01:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	that is not the directory used by Ubuntu
2008-10-31T01:59:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	so it must have changed with the recent releases...
2008-10-31T02:00:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	I did, on hardy
2008-10-31T02:00:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	and also now, on intrepid
2008-11-10T20:41:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	it is a regular "ar" archive
2008-11-18T02:27:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	I don't see why someone on #ubuntu should want to learn about networking, there are appropriate channels for that
2008-12-24T20:57:00.000Z	n8tuser	joaopinto	-> its big risk, i would not do it again
2008-12-24T20:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	n8tuser	backing up the data is always recommended, using the installer resizing is just as safer as using gparted, they use the same library to perform such operations...
2008-12-24T20:58:00.000Z	n8tuser	joaopinto	-> i learned to do things a step at a time when resizing and reformatting ntfs stuff, i've lost some beforehand
