2007-10-19T03:47:00.000Z	jcole		how do i install vmware player
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	wither apt-get install vmware-player, or apt-get install vmware-server (which includes a lot more than the player)
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	jcole	pppoe_dude	doesnt work
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	jcole	pppoe_dude	looks like there is a bug with gutsy kernel
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	did you enable multiverse?
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	jcole	pppoe_dude	ya
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	and all other package repos? including commercial?
2007-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	jcole	pppoe_dude	not commercial... can you do it?
2007-10-19T03:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	go to system>administration> software sources
2007-10-19T03:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	then enable the commercial repository, update list files and you should be fine
2007-10-19T03:50:00.000Z	jcole	pppoe_dude	vmplayer is in the gutsy repos, just not the kernel modules
2007-10-19T03:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	ah so it's a broken package?
2007-10-19T03:51:00.000Z	jcole	pppoe_dude	ya
2007-10-19T03:51:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	try to enable all the sources and try again. see if you get anything different
2007-10-19T03:54:00.000Z	jcole	pppoe_dude	ill look in commercial repos

2007-10-19T03:57:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	jcole	it is basically player + a lot more features
