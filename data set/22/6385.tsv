2006-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	glombool		Did anyone take over the Cinelerra package for Ubuntu?
2006-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	glombool		Does Edgy have nvidia-glx available in the repository?  I can't seem to find the version for the newest kernel...Or do I need to compile them?
2006-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	glombool		thanks
2006-11-17T09:53:00.000Z	glombool		!info nvidia-glx edgy

2006-11-17T09:53:00.000Z	glombool		!info nvidia-glx edgy | glombool
2006-11-17T09:54:00.000Z	glombool		Hmm...
2006-11-17T09:54:00.000Z	glombool		I have that wone
2006-11-17T09:54:00.000Z	glombool		one
2006-11-17T09:54:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	that one what?
2006-11-17T09:54:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-11-17T09:57:00.000Z	glombool	LjL	I pasted it
2006-11-17T09:57:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	URL please
2006-11-17T09:58:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	looks scary, do you know that having Debian repositories enabled may break your system?
2006-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32336/ try this
2006-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	run a "sudo apt-get update" after changing it
2006-11-17T10:07:00.000Z	glombool	LjL	no go, it says I already have the newest version installed.
2006-11-17T10:07:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	try an upgrade, "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2006-11-17T10:08:00.000Z	glombool	LjL	nothing to upgrade...
2006-11-17T10:08:00.000Z	glombool	LjL	The newest nvidia-glx ubuntu package is already installed.
2006-11-17T10:09:00.000Z	LjL	glombool	that's strange, since you didn't have -security and -updates enabled before. are you sure you ran "sudo apt-get update" after changing the sources.list?
2006-11-17T10:10:00.000Z	glombool	LjL	and this was after a clean Edgy install.
