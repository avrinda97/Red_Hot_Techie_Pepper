2005-04-19T08:52:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	tough to tell.
2005-04-19T08:52:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	probably about even.
2005-04-19T12:40:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	/usr/sbin/synaptic
2005-04-19T12:40:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	"which synaptic" will tell you where in your path it is if you are interested.
2005-04-19T12:41:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	or what ademar said.
2005-04-19T12:42:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	it's called "Synaptic Package Manager" in that menu.
2005-04-19T12:55:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	is gdm running?
2005-04-19T12:56:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	what's the ID of gdm?
2005-04-19T12:57:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	"ps aux | grep gdm"
2005-04-19T12:57:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	i shall type that?
2005-04-19T13:01:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	no it's not running, gdm that is
2005-04-19T13:07:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	the graphical login thing works yes (if that's gdm)
2005-04-19T13:07:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	actually let me check
2005-05-22T09:17:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	It is. But nobody reads it anyways.
2005-05-22T09:18:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	really? is there a link to ubuntuguide.org from the Ubuntu website?
2005-05-22T09:18:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	Would that link make it required? ;)
2005-05-22T09:19:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	it would make it official at least
2005-05-24T08:06:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	And your help is also appreciated :)
2005-05-24T08:08:00.000Z	Funraiser	dcraven	is a leader, i'm impressed
2005-05-24T08:37:00.000Z	dcraven	Funraiser	Isn't that as in, positioned prone?
