2010-01-13T02:13:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	This is what we used as a guide to make Zenix. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
2010-01-13T02:13:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	and I am following: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomizationFromScratch
2010-01-13T02:14:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	and as you can see isolinux.txt will only give me a terminal-espe boot prompt
2010-01-13T02:17:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	you know how the official CD presents you with the boot prompt with options I want to do that on my CD which is made from the ground up
2010-01-13T02:17:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	don't you mean isolinux.cfg ?
2010-01-13T02:18:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	yes
2010-01-13T02:18:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	sorry was thinking .cfg but typed .txt and didn't notice
2010-01-13T02:18:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	I wouldn't be too sure off the top of my head.
2010-01-13T02:18:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	but in that link I gave you, you download + extract the Ubuntu iso
2010-01-13T02:20:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	I have seen it seems they link a lot of files to each other which makes it really confusing
2010-01-13T02:21:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	what catagory should I ask?
2010-01-13T02:23:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	General Help is the generic "catch all" forums.
2010-01-13T02:23:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	thanks. I'll try there. Thanks for trying.
2010-01-13T02:23:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	"Development and Programming" is a bit quieter though, but may have less eyes watching.
2010-01-13T02:24:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	just don't cross-post - else I'll give you a warning ;-)
2010-01-13T02:24:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	cross post?
2010-01-13T02:24:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	create multiple threads in multiple subforums.
2010-01-13T02:26:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	oh. would dev &  programing be more appropriate?
2010-01-13T02:28:00.000Z	ibuclaw	alienkid10	both are equally as good places in my opinion considering your question. General Help tends to be a bit more "faster moving" then the Development subforums though.
2010-01-13T02:28:00.000Z	alienkid10	ibuclaw	gen help it is then.
