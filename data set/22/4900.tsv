2007-09-18T07:37:00.000Z	usser	manpreet	yep well article from january 2006 says "There are no POP3 and SMTP servers provided by HotMail. None. There is no configuration for Outlook Express, or Outlook, or any other mail program that will let you download your email directly from HotMail for free."
2007-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	usser	manpreet	that'd be one solution yes and have your msn forward messages to gmail
2007-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	usser	manpreet	pretty sure msn can do THAT
2007-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	manpreet	usser	any solution were i can keep my msn
2007-09-18T07:40:00.000Z	usser	manpreet	well use the browser to get your mail )

2007-09-18T07:41:00.000Z	usser	manpreet	bleh hotmail doesnt support forwarding either ))
2007-09-18T07:42:00.000Z	usser	manpreet	switching would be in your best interest
