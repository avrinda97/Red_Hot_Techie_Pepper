2005-10-26T05:17:00.000Z	flozilum		anyone remember how to find out which kernel source is installed?
2005-10-26T05:18:00.000Z	flozilum		thanks
2005-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	flozilum		sejEFF: 2.6.10-5-386 is returned by uname -r
2005-10-26T05:22:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	What distro are you running?
2005-10-26T05:18:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	Thats the command to list the currently running kernel, not the kernel source necessarily
2005-10-26T05:19:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	i'm trying to determine if the running kernel will support the latest nvidia drivers -
2005-10-26T05:19:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	If its a stock ubuntu kernel, you should have no problem
2005-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	And dpkg -l linux-kernel-headers will tell you the version of the kernel source code you have installed
2005-10-26T05:22:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	: hoiw does one update the source ? i believe 2.5.9 is too old
2005-10-26T05:22:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	: ubuntu 5.04
2005-10-26T05:23:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-headers
2005-10-26T05:25:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	 returned "latest version"
2005-10-26T05:26:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	your kernel is what? And your headers are 2.5.xx?
2005-10-26T05:27:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	kernel is 2.6.10-5
2005-10-26T05:27:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	headers 2.5.99
2005-10-26T05:27:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	Thats very weird, but you could try it out. You should install breezy, it is soooo much better :-)
2005-10-26T05:28:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	painless way to install breezy?
2005-10-26T05:28:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	Did you put /home on it's own partition during the install?
2005-10-26T05:29:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	If you did, you could wipe everything except for /home and keep all of your settings with a fresh breezy install
2005-10-26T05:29:00.000Z	flozilum	SEJeff	how could i check? fdisk?
2005-10-26T05:29:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	If you don't know, that means it is not
2005-10-26T05:30:00.000Z	SEJeff	flozilum	do: grep home /etc/fstab, sorry wrong name autocompleted
