2007-07-06T06:14:00.000Z	Michael147		Hey! Ive got quite a tricky problem reguarding a driver for what i belive to be an Intel NIC. Now ive installed the driver for what i think is the correct NIC make/model on a windowss sytem and im getting a connection status of litmited or no connectivity. Now could have i got the model of the NIC wrong, or is the driver at fault?I need some advice here guys ive been at this sytem for 3 days.
2007-07-06T06:15:00.000Z	jxi	Michael147	what kind of nic
2007-07-06T06:15:00.000Z	Michael147	jxi	the NIC is built into an Asus mobo.
2007-07-06T06:16:00.000Z	jxi	Michael147	asus mobo?
2007-07-06T06:16:00.000Z	Michael147	jxi	ive downloaded a Gigabit Ethernet driver from Intel and installed on the windows OS.
2007-07-06T06:17:00.000Z	Michael147	jxi	an Asus motherboard.
2007-07-06T06:19:00.000Z	jxi	Michael147	it is tricky as long as you do not know which chipset you have
2007-07-06T06:19:00.000Z	Michael147	jxi	how would i find out?
2007-07-06T06:19:00.000Z	jxi	Michael147	i guess you do not have any documentation. have you tried searching lspci strings?
2007-07-06T06:20:00.000Z	Michael147	jxi	i have no documentation whatsoever. The PC was bought 2nd hand.
2007-07-06T06:20:00.000Z	jxi	Michael147	what does lspci give you?
2007-07-06T06:21:00.000Z	Michael147		Well i installed an Intel driver for the card and i got a limited or no connectivity staus.
2007-07-06T06:21:00.000Z	Michael147		lspci??
2007-07-06T06:21:00.000Z	jxi		!lspci
2007-07-06T06:22:00.000Z	jxi	Michael147	of course, it is not on your pci bus.. hmm..
2007-07-06T06:22:00.000Z	Michael147		Ive tried checking the board itself, but nothing.
2007-07-06T06:23:00.000Z	jxi	Michael147	if it's a laptop you can always check out linux on laptops, but im sorry i can't help you more. it seems to be like a tricky combination of not knowing the chipset and proprietary card..
2007-07-06T06:24:00.000Z	Michael147	jxi	well heres what i downloaded : http://downloadcenter.intel.com/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=983&OSFullName=Windows%2A+XP+Professional&lang=eng&strOSs=44&submit=Go%21
