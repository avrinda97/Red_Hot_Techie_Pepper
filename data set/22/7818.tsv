2006-09-04T13:27:00.000Z	fredl		Dapper *has* as default install PHP *5* right??
2006-09-04T13:28:00.000Z	fredl		or am I hallucinating?
2006-09-04T13:29:00.000Z	fredl		I wonder how backports work....
2006-09-04T13:30:00.000Z	fredl		since I found a 'Mediawiki 1.7 backport for Dapper'
2006-09-04T13:30:00.000Z	fredl		is it generally a wise thing to enable backports?
2006-09-04T13:31:00.000Z	fredl		Hmm I *have* backports commented out in my sources.list
2006-09-04T13:33:00.000Z	fredl		well I never really used postgres for a long time. I'm hearing it's much more complete than mysql though.

2006-09-04T13:34:00.000Z	fredl	Arafangion	that's in mysql 5 too though, right?
2006-09-04T13:34:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	I personally dislike the way that mysql handles default values and the way it handles case sensitivity and the NULL value.
2006-09-04T13:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	They don't really differ much at all - it's hte *dependencies* that differ.
2006-09-04T07:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	gimp, you are going to edit it anyway, right?
2006-09-04T07:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	Or, just hit printscreen.
2006-09-04T07:41:00.000Z	fredl	Arafangion	nope, not going to edit any, I knew of gimp to do it and I want only part of the screen. Oh well, gimp will do.
2006-09-04T07:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	Aha, so you *do* want to edit it.
2006-09-04T07:41:00.000Z	fredl	Arafangion	no I don't want to edit it, hence 'not going to edit any' :)
2006-09-04T07:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	Did you say you only wanted a part of the screen?
2006-09-04T07:42:00.000Z	fredl	Arafangion	yup.
2006-09-04T07:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	QED
2006-09-04T07:42:00.000Z	fredl	Arafangion	grrr :)
2006-09-04T07:45:00.000Z	Arafangion	fredl	I see your running kubuntu?
2006-09-04T07:45:00.000Z	fredl	Arafangion	no I have used kubuntu-desktop in the past.
