2010-08-31T22:11:00.000Z	volume		Question... Is NTFS or EXT4 better for running windows 7 in Virtual Box? Or does it make a difference? Actually I'm thinking about created 2 partitions one in ext4 and the other in ntfs for windows 7 install. What do yall think? (PS I used to run Ubuntu, but I've been running win7, but it's crap so I'm going back to Ubunut. I'm no pro)
2010-08-31T22:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	I'm not sure windows 7 will run from ext4 will it?
2010-08-31T22:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	just leave the partition alone unused. let windows 7 take care of it when it installs.
2010-08-31T22:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	virtualbox has options at start the defaults to the needed settings for the planed operating system install.  ntfs would be what it would probly pick for you.
2010-08-31T22:15:00.000Z	volume	sacarlson	- I'm sorry. My bad. Never mind Virtual Box. I'm in gParted right now trying to figure out how I should format my drive to install ubuntu. I know that I will want to create another partition to run windows in Virtual Box. You can do that right? Create a real, physical, partition and use it in virtual box?
2010-08-31T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	yes I guess.  I never tried setup virtualbox dual bot but I supose you could.  ntfs or unused would be what you want.
2010-08-31T22:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	I never used physical partitions
2010-08-31T22:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	is that a problem or a feature, no iphone?
2010-08-31T22:27:00.000Z	volume	sacarlson	- haha. I really like my iphone, and ipod.
2010-08-31T22:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	I did have a working 9.X with an Ipod but i also managed to crash it to the point it needed to be reset to factory defaults.
2010-08-31T22:39:00.000Z	volume	sacarlson	- in order to install windows first I would have to have ntfs
2010-08-31T22:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	if you plan to setup a dualboot windows/ubuntu normaly you install windows first and make sure when installing windows you create a spare partition.  then install ubuntu.
2010-08-31T22:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	I'm not sure why you would setup dual boot on virtualbox but maybe it's a good learning experience.
2010-08-31T22:37:00.000Z	volume	sacarlson	- yeah I know. That's what I've always done in the past too.
2010-08-31T22:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	so I know you can do it this way but it's just more trouble.
2010-08-31T22:37:00.000Z	volume	sacarlson	-   That's not what I'm trying to do. I didn't explain myself well enough.
2010-08-31T22:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	yes but just let windows create it?  when you install ubuntu you can delete it
2010-08-31T22:41:00.000Z	volume	sacarlson	- SO how is file sharing working in virtual box now a days? I could never get it to work in 9.04
2010-08-31T22:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	with samba?
2010-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	volume	sacarlson	-- well, any kind of fiile sharing at all. I could never figure out how to share files between my win7 and ubuntu in Virtual Box. Made it somewhat worthless for me.
2010-08-31T22:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	samba works very well for me.  I just turn off all the security
2010-08-31T22:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	volume	I"ve had problems having windows share with ubuntu since I had accounts with no passwords.  I had to create password accounts in windows to make it share that way.
