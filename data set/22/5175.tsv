2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	TaintedTux		Anyone using mpd+Sonata?
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	TaintedTux		Sonata keeps crashing on me
2007-07-01T13:32:00.000Z	TaintedTux		I just switched from Arch to Ubuntu and I cant get Sonata to work for anything...I never really had any problems on Arch with it so Im just wondering if maybe there is a bug or something
2007-07-01T13:32:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	sonata works fine here, did you install and configure mpd ok?  does mpc work?
2007-07-01T13:33:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	mpd should be fine I changed all the configuration to what i need it to be...sonata just keeps crashing and the output in terminal says something about dbus...but i dont know much about dbus really
2007-07-01T13:33:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	pastebin the output
2007-07-01T13:34:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	 import dbus.dbus_bindings as m
2007-07-01T13:36:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	ok didnt know about that...hers the URL http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28136/
2007-07-01T13:38:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	ok an what actually happens, sonata doesn't open?
2007-07-01T13:39:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	it opens but it just completely freezes up and I have to kill it
2007-07-01T13:40:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	the output you pasted shows up here too but it works ok.  Do you get anything else after that before it freezes?  Do you do anything for it to freeze?
2007-07-01T13:41:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	not thats the only output i get...it works for a second but then freezes...doesnt even stay going long enought to play anything
2007-07-01T13:41:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	and with mpc you can start playing music ok?
2007-07-01T13:41:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	Im not actually familiar with mpc
2007-07-01T13:41:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	try 'mpc play' in a terminal
2007-07-01T13:43:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	i ge tthat same error grabbing key...output and nothing plays
2007-07-01T13:46:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	what version of ubuntu?
2007-07-01T13:46:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	7.04
2007-07-01T13:47:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	k, I found https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sonata/+bug/103433 btw.  See if the suggestion in the last post resolves your issue
2007-07-01T13:49:00.000Z	TaintedTux	jrib	seems to thave fixed it...thanks
2007-07-01T13:50:00.000Z	jrib	TaintedTux	weird that mpc also didn't work, but alright as long as you can listen to your music now :)
