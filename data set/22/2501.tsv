2009-05-29T04:47:00.000Z	neurobuntu_		does anybody know if umask set on a user or directory level?
2009-05-29T04:48:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	you can specify default umask settings in your profile IIRC
2009-05-29T04:48:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	should be user level
2009-05-29T04:49:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	example explanation here http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/understanding-linux-unix-umask-value-usage.html
2009-05-29T04:52:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	somewhat, though relying on it too much can make a system less secure in some ways
2009-05-29T04:52:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	usually sudo is the preferred method of getting stuff done as the big guy
2009-05-29T04:53:00.000Z	neurobuntu_	dgh1973	what I'm trying to do is make it so any file created under a folder inherits the ownership of the parent folder
2009-05-29T04:54:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	interesting... you can set a specific umask at the user level, but that doesn't really look at parent dirs, you have a process in place for the file creation? I.e. you can do this with a program to read parent perms and write file accordingly
2009-05-29T04:54:00.000Z	neurobuntu_	dgh1973	umask only handles the file permissions not the file ownership
2009-05-29T04:55:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	other than that, there MIGHT be some low level file manipulation commands that can do this, not sure
2009-05-29T04:56:00.000Z	neurobuntu_	dgh1973	i've been told by people that setuid/gid can do it....   I have a media folder (pictures, music, etc..) that I want to share between two users, so I created a group added them both to the group. Then when either users adds files to the folder they are both the owner and the group I'd like to automate it so that when files/folders are added the joint group is used by default not the users group... but I want this to hap
2009-05-29T04:59:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	ahh right, that may be true, not sure how setuid/setguid works on a dir... that might be the case
2009-05-29T04:59:00.000Z	neurobuntu_	dgh1973	all I can find about setuid on the tubes is that it is used to let users run executables as root but nothing like what I am doing
2009-05-29T05:00:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	ahh I got you... that's what it does for dirs... check this link http://www.zzee.com/solutions/linux-permissions.shtml#setuid
2009-05-29T05:01:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	so in order to do what you want you just "chmod g+s dir"
2009-05-29T05:04:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	usser here has good tips for you!
2009-05-29T05:08:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	I think so, you can "sudo su - testuser" and write some files and see
2009-05-29T05:08:00.000Z	neurobuntu_	dgh1973	thanks a lot!
2009-05-29T05:10:00.000Z	neurobuntu_	dgh1973	I tested it and it worked
2009-05-29T05:10:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	rock on! thanks to usser for the assist
2009-05-29T05:11:00.000Z	dgh1973	neurobuntu_	sounds like you had that one worked out on your own though
2009-05-29T05:11:00.000Z	neurobuntu_	dgh1973	no way I wouldnt have gotten it without your chmod help
