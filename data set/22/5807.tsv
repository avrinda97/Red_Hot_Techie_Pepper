2009-11-23T08:25:00.000Z	jenny-devbie		is there a way you can search and replace in the command line
2009-11-23T08:26:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	search and replace what?  (you mean the contents of a file?)
2009-11-23T08:27:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	certainly :) there are many ways which you could do that.
2009-11-23T08:31:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	i/o redirection
2009-11-23T08:31:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	i understand you're very much interested and excited but it'll take you soem time before you get the hang of it
2009-11-23T08:32:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	what's that ?
2009-11-23T08:32:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	gnome-system-monitor
2009-11-23T08:33:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	is that a common term/acronym
2009-11-23T08:35:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	if the word "dev" in your name, are you a windows devie?  (just curious)
2009-11-23T08:37:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	 i did :)
2009-11-23T08:41:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	is it too much to swallow at once?  If you're planning on coding in GNU/Linux, I strongly suggest that learn *one text editor. e.g. vim
2009-11-23T08:43:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	well, vim has a lot of commands which allows you to do everything you would ever think of (plus more) when it comes to editing
2009-11-23T08:44:00.000Z	doseryder	jenny-devbie	I understand knopies and I got different opions on vim, and that everyone has different needs but an editor like vim (or emacs) certainly has its merits.
