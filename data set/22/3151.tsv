2008-11-25T10:30:00.000Z	candykiller	wookienz	I've never really tested it properly to say yes or no, anytime I've ever looked at it on paper though it shows a good amount of gain, especially when running harddrive operations like indexing and booting
2008-11-25T10:30:00.000Z	wookienz	candykiller	they are not cheap! it in a normal beige box or server?
2008-11-25T10:34:00.000Z	candykiller	wookienz	I built it about a year ago, i got like a 30lb Thermaltake Armor Fullcase that it's sitting in...I could literally shelter a baby in this thing, lol
2008-11-25T10:36:00.000Z	wookienz	candykiller	i had a thermaltake case a while back, just too huge! now have a shuttle box.

2008-11-25T10:36:00.000Z	candykiller	wookienz	just upgrading this machine every year or so
2008-11-25T10:37:00.000Z	wookienz	candykiller	thats the prob withs huttle boxes, you have to buy a whole new one with mobo installed.almost timefor a enw machine so i think ill go backto normal boxes.
