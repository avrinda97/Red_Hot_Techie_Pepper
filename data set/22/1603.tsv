2010-10-22T03:37:00.000Z	FriGiN		ok how does one go about killing grub off a drive that isnt in an ubuntu system anymroe
2010-10-22T03:38:00.000Z	FriGiN		anymore
2010-10-22T03:38:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	install a new boot loader over it
2010-10-22T03:38:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	then you have nothing to worry about, your bios won't try to boot from it
2010-10-22T03:39:00.000Z	FriGiN	ikonia	the system will see 2 boot drives tho.. the new hdd that is getting 7 installed on it that was recently ubuntu, and the old 500gb hdd that was windows 7 that has grub on it from installing ubuntu
2010-10-22T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	if your disk is not set to be the master boot drive, it won't matter, as it will boot off the primary before looking at the secondary
2010-10-22T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	when windows 7 is installed on a disk, it will replace the boot loader, so grub will go any way
2010-10-22T03:41:00.000Z	FriGiN	ikonia	nah its not connected ATM.. i have all but the drive im working with disconnected.
2010-10-22T03:41:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	that's what will happen when you do connect it
2010-10-22T03:42:00.000Z	FriGiN	ikonia	kk thx just making sure im already mad enough i cant get my wireless working proper in ubuntu i would hate to reformat for nothing.
2010-10-22T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	please don't recommend that
2010-10-22T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	ubuntu has the repos setup - use the repos so it's supported
2010-10-22T03:52:00.000Z	FriGiN	ikonia	alright then, either way it worked just fine for me. i'll keep it to myself.
2010-10-22T03:55:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	you shouldn't open that page - use the repo
2010-10-22T03:57:00.000Z	FriGiN	ikonia	i dont have the repo, dont rightly know the best way to get the repo, and its already installed and working.
2010-10-22T03:57:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	sorry, I meant that message to go to rp2
2010-10-22T03:58:00.000Z	FriGiN	ikonia	yah i just saw that sorry between the laptop and installing 7 on the desktop cuz ubuntu hates my usb wireless card.
2010-10-22T04:02:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	regognise within ubuntu ?
2010-10-22T04:03:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	not an ubuntu issue, you know it's not so why are you asking ?
2010-10-22T04:04:00.000Z	FriGiN	ikonia	i thought someone might be willing or kind enough to PM me to talk about it.. its not like ive asked it 10 times.. just the once and wasnt going to ask it again.
2010-10-22T04:04:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	but you knew it was offtopic, there are hardware channels
2010-10-31T01:52:00.000Z	ikonia	FriGiN	check the supported hardware list
