2007-06-22T08:05:00.000Z	pyrak		is there a keyboard shortcut to launch terminal?
2007-06-22T08:05:00.000Z	pyrak		(by default)
2007-06-22T08:05:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	no, set one in systme -> preferences -> keyboard shortcuts
2007-06-22T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	though there is alt-f2 for a run dialog...
2007-06-29T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	use gparted
2007-06-29T07:02:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	i cant find it
2007-06-29T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	did you install the "gparted" package in synaptic, or do you mean you can't find it there?
2007-06-29T07:02:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	naw, i figered i should have already had it, now im getting it off synaptic, thanks
2007-06-29T07:06:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	now why wont it let me delete/resize any partitions
2007-06-29T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	they can't be mounted, you should use a live cd
2007-06-29T07:07:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	but i'm talking about partitions on an external drive
2007-06-29T07:07:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	theres a little lock next o the partition
2007-06-29T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	because it is mounted I think.  You need to use a live cd
2007-06-29T07:08:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	one more thing, when i try to unmount the disks, they unmount then mount right back again, how do i fix this/
2007-06-29T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	what disk?
2007-06-29T07:09:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	external hard drives connected by usb
2007-06-29T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	hmm, I don't know of a nice way to do it... I guess you could try killing gnome-volume-manager?
2007-06-29T07:10:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	actually it says "cannot eject volume"
2007-06-29T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	try in a terminal: sudo umount /dev/whatever
2007-06-29T07:16:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	awesome, unmounting from terminal works fine, now i need some advice: how ought i to format this drive that'll just be used as backup storage?  It'd be nice if the drive could be read by windows
2007-06-29T07:16:00.000Z	pyrak	jrib	should i just format it as ntfs?
2007-06-29T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	pyrak	format it as ext3.  That way you will retain your permissions.  windows can read ext3 if you install a driver (see ubotu)
