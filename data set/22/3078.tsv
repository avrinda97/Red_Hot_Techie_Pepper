2009-03-28T15:02:00.000Z	ChotaZ		Can anyone here help me with ALSA?
2009-03-28T15:03:00.000Z	ChotaZ		I'm having problem having 2 applications outputting sound at the same time, If I open teamspeak and mplayr next, mplayer crashes and i have to pkill it.
2009-03-28T15:04:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	it might help to use dmix instead of the default alsa output
2009-03-28T15:04:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	How do I use dmix? (sorry i'm new to linux, fresh installed yesterday for first time)
2009-03-28T15:05:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	gimme a minute, need to look for myself ^ ^
2009-03-28T15:06:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	Thanks.
2009-03-28T15:09:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	seems like it's application dependent. look if you can choose the audio output in the preferences of those apps. there should be at least alsa, oss and dmix to choose from
2009-03-28T15:09:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	Does dmix come installed by default?
2009-03-28T15:10:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	what i did on my system additionally is, set all defaults in "System => Preferences => Sound" to PulseAudio. seems to work pretty nicely
2009-03-28T15:10:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	afaik yes
2009-03-28T15:11:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	Yeah I had to do that do, otherwise my headset wouldnt work.
2009-03-28T15:12:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	I set everything to PulseAudio.
2009-03-28T15:12:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	sound still seems a bit tricky on ubuntu. the defaults are crap ;o)
2009-03-28T15:12:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	Let me try having youtube outputting at same time as teamspeak.
2009-03-28T15:14:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	Wow, another problem, flash isnt working for some reason, is there  anything specific I need to to do install it on 64 bits?
2009-03-28T15:15:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	sometimes "F5" in the browser window helps. have problems with flash on my 64 bit box too
2009-03-28T15:16:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	Refreshing isnt working =\
2009-03-28T15:19:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	it's just a gray box, right? i don't know...before the last update it seemed to work occasionally
2009-03-28T15:21:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	Right, and I got around it, if you still with problems try this: workes just now for me http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Install-Adobe-Flash-Player-64-bit-on-Ubuntu-8-10-98076.shtml
2009-03-28T15:22:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	getting back to the first subject, I tried having youtube + teamspeak, and teamspeak automutes me. =\ For some reason I can't have 2 apps outputting for same device
2009-03-28T15:23:00.000Z	QaDeS	ChotaZ	did you find dmix in the team speak preferences? (sorry, don't use teamspeak myself)
2009-03-28T15:24:00.000Z	ChotaZ	QaDeS	In teamspeak I had to set the output device to dev/dsp1 so it would out in the headset.
