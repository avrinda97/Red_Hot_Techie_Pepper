2010-06-28T20:19:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	what exactly are you trying to do?
2010-06-28T20:20:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	my system crashed in a upgrade and I'm trying to recover my /home
2010-06-28T20:22:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	I have done the same thing. Let me see if I can find the blog post that helped me. brb
2010-06-28T20:24:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	take a look at this. I believe it's the same steps I've used: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Recovering Your Data Manually
2010-06-28T20:38:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	filename encryption should be set to no if I haven't done anything special right?
2010-06-28T20:39:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	I would say yes, because mine were in fact encrypted by default
2010-06-28T20:39:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	ok yes it is.
2010-06-28T20:41:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	let me know how it goes
2010-06-28T20:47:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	"Error mounting eCryptfs: [-2] No such file or directory" which makes no sense since I used tab to select both the target and the destination
2010-06-28T20:50:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	of that I'm not sure. Mine seemed to work. maybe do a google search on that error
2010-06-28T21:22:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	I know what's the problem now, to long path names however I've yet to figgured out a easy way to rename my mountpoint
2010-06-28T21:33:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	sorry i had a phone call. have you figured out what's going on?
2010-06-28T22:15:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	I've manage to recover some files from /home/.ecryptfs/user/.Private
2010-06-28T22:20:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	that's good to hear. Still can't get them all?
2010-06-28T22:20:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	only .cashe which feels kinda useless
2010-06-28T22:21:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	that's weird. so it's because the dir names are too long?
2010-06-28T22:21:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	nvm I changed my target and now everything is here
2010-06-28T22:22:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	So I've succeded, thank you very much.
2010-06-28T22:22:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	good to hear. sorry it was so hard and I wasn't too helpful.
2010-06-28T22:22:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	glad to see it worked out though.
2010-06-28T22:26:00.000Z	raze	rubbs	If I now move them outside the encrypted folder they will be decrypted right?
2010-06-28T22:26:00.000Z	rubbs	raze	yes
