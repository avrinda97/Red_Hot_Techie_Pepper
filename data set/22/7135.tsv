2006-05-28T09:55:00.000Z	uscg_corey		ah libc6-dev
2006-05-28T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	install build-essential
2006-05-28T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	what are you compiling?
2006-05-28T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	why not just use apt-get to install it?
2006-05-28T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	sudo apt-get build-dep mail-notification will pull most/all deps you need to build
2006-05-28T10:00:00.000Z	uscg_corey	nickrud	E: Unable to find a source package for mail-notification
2006-05-28T10:01:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	some packages require you to enable extra repos by hand, see !components for why and !repos for how
2006-05-28T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	if you already have the iso on the hard drive, right click it & select write to disk
2006-05-28T10:25:00.000Z	uscg_corey	nickrud	i just have the bin/cue
2006-05-28T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	you probably need to install bchunk
2006-05-28T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	did you do sudo apt-get build-dep mail-notification ?
2006-05-28T11:10:00.000Z	uscg_corey	nickrud	it says it cant find source when i do that
2006-05-28T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	then you need to enable the repos. read !components for why you have to do it, and !repos for how
2006-05-28T11:35:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	libeel2-dev
2006-05-28T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	if you'd enable the repos, you can get them in one fell swoop with apt-get build-dep ;)
2006-05-28T13:26:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	click both buttons at once, probably takes two hands :)
2006-05-28T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	it should. another bug.
2006-05-28T13:28:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	all panel applets should have a remove, move & lock option under the right menu
2006-05-28T13:29:00.000Z	nickrud	uscg_corey	ah, tht's not an applet, that's a notification area icon (forget what they call items in there)
