2005-11-18T14:47:00.000Z	glick		?
2005-11-18T14:47:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	what does that mean ?
2005-11-18T14:49:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	a preemtive kernel is that after a certian time slice the kernel interrupts the current program and runs the schedular that decides what program to run next
2005-11-18T14:49:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	umm, linux has always been preemptive
2005-11-18T14:50:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	i dont think so
2005-11-18T14:50:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	i'll bet anything on it
2005-11-18T14:50:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	i bet you're confused about something
2005-11-18T14:50:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	there are version of linux in which the kernel may be, to varying degrees preempted
2005-11-18T14:50:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	linux wasnt always preemtive
2005-11-18T14:51:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	please stop trolling
2005-11-18T14:51:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	im not trolling
2005-11-18T14:51:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	linux has been a preemptive system since the very earliest release
2005-11-18T14:51:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	no i thnk preemtion wasnt a feature till the 2.2 release
2005-11-18T14:52:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	ok, you're retarded
2005-11-18T14:52:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	 as i said, there is a difference between preempting the kernel and preempting an application
2005-11-18T14:52:00.000Z	MrFarts	glick	this is probably what you are confused about since you are talking about embedded systems
2005-11-18T14:52:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	i got jesus on my side so you better be carefull or he will strike you with lighening!
2005-11-18T14:53:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	maybe
2005-11-18T14:53:00.000Z	glick	MrFarts	i am slightly drunk
