2012-06-14T02:18:00.000Z	nerdistmonk		i updated my kernel and now my firewall has stopped working (Error with ufw-init) can anyone help
2012-06-14T02:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	When do you receive that error?
2012-06-14T02:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Does the kernel log say anything useful when you run that command?
2012-06-14T02:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	/var/log/kern.log
2012-06-14T02:26:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Did you try googling: "Error with ufw-init" or the exact error message you are receiving?
2012-06-14T02:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Did it actually read "Problem running ufw-init"?
2012-06-14T02:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Oh.. Nice of you to mention that piece of info. I assumed that it did nothing...
2012-06-14T02:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	What does `ufw status` give you?
2012-06-14T02:30:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	No, you said the error message was something different that it actually was and that the firewall was "not working". A firewall that is blocking everything is working perfectly.
2012-06-14T02:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	My point exactly. That's not what is happening at all.
2012-06-14T02:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Are you accessing the box via SSH?
2012-06-14T02:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Ok. Is your IRC client accessing the server on port 6667?
2012-06-14T02:34:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	or even better try `ufw allow 80` followed by `ufw enable` and see if you can access web pages. If you can then the issue is reading the configuration file.
2012-06-14T02:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Answering questions is easy. Figuring out what the problem is, that is the hard part. Why don't we try figure out what the hard part is first?
2012-06-14T02:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	I know that allowing port 80 won't resolve the root cause, but it will help identify it.
2012-06-14T02:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Were you able to access web pages?
2012-06-14T02:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Yes, but were you able to access web pages?
2012-06-14T02:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	Did it give you an error when you tried `ufw allow 80`?
2012-06-14T02:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	I see. Can you pastebin your rules?
2012-06-14T02:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	I see. You said you had reinstalled ufw. When you did, which command did you use? reinstall and uninstall do not necessarily remove configuration files.
2012-06-14T02:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	For real?
2012-06-14T02:44:00.000Z	BlueEagle	nerdistmonk	By complete remove you ofcourse mean apt-get purge ufw
