2007-05-13T06:00:00.000Z	premier_		I'm trynig to read a wmv3 file (video codec) and I can't get it to work.  Does anyone know what I need to install?
2007-05-13T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	are you on feisty?
2007-05-13T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	hmm, double clicking on it in nautilus doesn't prompt you to install some packages?
2007-05-13T06:01:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	I'm on kde
2007-05-13T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	hmm, what does kde use as the default player?
2007-05-13T06:03:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	well, theres several, kaffine is the default, theres also vlc, mplayer, kmplayer, etc
2007-05-13T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	ok, try w32codecs I guess but I thought vlc and mplayer played those now without codecs
2007-05-13T06:08:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	how do I install w32codecs?  I can't find a package with apt-cache
2007-05-13T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	you need a repository like medibuntu
2007-05-13T06:08:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	nevermind
2007-05-13T06:09:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	once I get w32, which players should be able to play?
2007-05-13T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	*mplayer at least
2007-05-13T06:10:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	but it is strange you can't play them already.  I'm on amd64 which doesn't have w32codecs and can play WMV3 on vlc, mplayer, and totem-gstreamer
2007-05-13T06:11:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	my computer has been feeling a little sluggish, and a freind told me it was pretty slow for linux, but my cpu is not not being used (5-10%) and I have a very powerful computer... is there anyway I can look to see whats up?
2007-05-13T06:12:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	you use 64 bit?  whats it like?  I heard you have to jump through some hoops... I want to get a 64bit computer this summer, so I want all the details
2007-05-13T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	it takes a few extra steps to do some things.  It's not really worth it though if you just use your computer as a desktop machine.  wine has a repository now so that's easy.  flash, you need to setup nspluginwrapper which is not packaged.  And the only thing that is a pain is the java plugin.  But I ended up just using blackdown's java plugin and that's been working fine.  Anything that's open source shouldn't be a big deal on 64bit, it's usually c
2007-05-13T06:16:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	is it worth it to buy an amd64 and run a 32 bit OS on it, maybe dual boot a 64 bit?
2007-05-13T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	well all the processors are 64-bit now aren't they?
2007-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	well, I want to get an AMD processor... intel processors aren't 64 bit (mostly) yet
2007-05-13T06:22:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	but I really want my 64 bit OS to go with my 64 bit PC
2007-05-13T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	premier_	well your idea of having two partitions, one with 32bit and one with 64bit would be a nice way for you to evaluate it
2007-05-13T06:25:00.000Z	premier_	jrib	I'm thinking I'll have vista/XP, kubuntu and debian... not sure which will be 64 and which 32...
