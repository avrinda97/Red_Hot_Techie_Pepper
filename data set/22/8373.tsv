2005-09-13T15:21:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	what is the K7 kernel ?>
2005-09-13T15:23:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	you might try that, also. either one will work
2005-09-20T16:38:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	this is not the place for XP troubles
2005-09-26T11:01:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	you should have the option to resize in the installer
2005-09-26T11:02:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	resize ?
2005-09-26T11:03:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	what do you mean by "resize" ?
2005-09-26T11:03:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	is your hard drive full of windows right now?
2005-09-26T11:04:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	i don't need windwos :-) someone else asked the ntfs question...
2005-09-26T11:05:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	sorry
2005-10-16T13:22:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	ext3
2005-10-16T13:23:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	Why Ext3 and not ReiserFS, Reiser4, XFS or JFS ?
2005-10-16T13:23:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	ext3 is more stable and has better tools to work with it
2005-10-16T13:25:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	But distro"s like Suse use ReiserFS as default... So I get confused :-(
2005-10-16T13:25:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	suse has issues
2005-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	I ask because I had to Install Hoary 3 times on my laptop because EXT3 keep's crashing, and ResierFS has no problems. and now I want to install Breezy on my desktop, and I'm searching all over the net about FileSystems...to decide..
2005-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	go with what you are comforable with, i've never had a problem with ext3
2005-10-16T13:28:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	Thanks :-)
2005-10-16T13:31:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	linux cant write to NTFS
2005-10-16T13:31:00.000Z	LaserLine	nalioth	I know, that's why I made a 5GB FAT32 partition...
2005-10-19T11:09:00.000Z	nalioth	LaserLine	sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
