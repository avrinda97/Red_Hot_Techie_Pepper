2008-11-18T03:12:00.000Z	chamunks		is there a way to make ubuntu allow me to close processes during a lockup?
2008-11-18T03:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	Try going to a tty with ctrl+alt+F1
2008-11-18T03:14:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	i tried and it just gives me a bunch of strange coloured (what appears to be) ascii art.
2008-11-18T03:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	Try booting without usplash and it may show correctly, for some reason with some hardware usplash corrupts video for ttys
2008-11-18T03:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	You can also try sshing in from another machine
2008-11-18T03:16:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	ahh sshing might work ... see i was in the middle of upgrading my dist and a program locked up the whole computer but its still installing just verry slowly
2008-11-18T03:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	If it's slow because you are running out of memory then linux will eventually kill the process using the most RAM, but that won't happen until you run out of swap space
2008-11-18T03:19:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	thats probably not happening i have like a 3 gig swap lol :'(
2008-11-18T03:23:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	Ohhh man i cant believe that ssh'ing into the box worked!
2008-11-18T03:24:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	i have no idea how to kill a process tho.
2008-11-18T03:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	The desktop side of Linux is much less stable than the *NIX heart, ssh will almost never fail you ( unless you loose your network connection of course )
2008-11-18T03:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	Do you know what process needs to be killed?
2008-11-18T03:26:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	i suspect that its amsn i accidentally loaded it and it pooped.
2008-11-18T03:31:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	:S
2008-11-18T03:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	"pgrep amsn" to see if it's running ( it will output the process id ) then "pkill amsn" or "kill pid" to kill it
2008-11-18T03:29:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	hmm amsn doesent show on the pgrep
2008-11-18T03:30:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	can you force a user to log out via cli?
2008-11-18T03:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	You can kill their gnome-session, be careful though because if you "log out" the user that is running update manager the upgrade will stop
2008-11-18T03:33:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	this is so strange i cant imagine whats locking this up..
2008-11-18T03:36:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	maybe ill just let it run through for the night even though it says its going to take 13 hours
2008-11-18T03:46:00.000Z	chamunks	Jordan_U	thanks lots for the help.
2008-11-18T03:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chamunks	np
