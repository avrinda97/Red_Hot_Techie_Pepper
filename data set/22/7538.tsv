2006-03-08T13:44:00.000Z	Krillancello		I'm thinking of trying to learn programming, most likely with C/++ and Java. Does anyone have any suggestions for what to install? (Keep in mind the main purpose of this is to LEARN to program.)
2006-03-08T13:44:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	if you want to learn how to program, then you should learn python
2006-03-08T13:44:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	Why's that?
2006-03-08T13:44:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	it's very useful on linux, and easier to learn
2006-03-08T13:45:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	wait a few more seconds and i'll give you an online tutorial my teacher wrote
2006-03-08T13:45:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	The ease of learning a language has no impact on me. If I want to, I can learn it regardless.
2006-03-08T13:46:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	Also, I'm looking for what to install. IDE, compiler, documentation...
2006-03-08T13:46:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	for python, install idle and python2.4, it's an interpreted language so it doesn't need to be compiled
2006-03-08T13:47:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	Is the Python documentation installable, or is it online?
2006-03-08T13:48:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/
2006-03-08T13:48:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	it's most certaintly online, and there probably is documentation that's installable
2006-03-08T13:49:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	if you learn python first, you'll be able to learn other languages with even more ease, :)
2006-03-08T13:50:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	The problem with that is that once I were to learn Python, if I went on to learn other languages, I'd still need to know what compilers/editors/documentation to install.
2006-03-08T13:51:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	that's not too hard to find out, the harder part is learning how to program
2006-03-08T13:51:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	there's how to think like a computer scientist books for c++ and java, though
2006-03-08T13:52:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	I'm not your ordinary computer geek. I find learning to program easier than figuring out what I need to program.
2006-03-08T13:53:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	There are like four versions of both gcc and g++ in my package list. Not having programmed before, I don't know which one I would want.
2006-03-08T13:53:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	any of them would compile your program, most likely :p
2006-03-08T13:53:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	whichever one's name makes you feel the happiest :p
2006-03-08T13:54:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	But there would usually be a suggested one over the others.
2006-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	Spec	Krillancello	^^
2006-03-08T14:40:00.000Z	Krillancello	Spec	I've used wallpapoz before, but I wanted to see if it (or an alternative) was readily available before getting it.
