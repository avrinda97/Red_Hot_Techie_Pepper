2004-09-19T12:40:00.000Z	kiko		heh. 
2004-09-19T12:42:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	the name of the software contained in the package is 'linux'; that should be reflected in the name of the package :-P
2004-09-19T12:43:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	this isn't a plan to allow something like hurd-image to pop up, right?
2004-09-19T12:50:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	Kamion: this kernel recognizes my pcmcia network card *before* my inbuilt one.
2004-09-19T12:51:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	Kamion: can I trust the change will be stable, or is this a bug we should be fixing?
2004-09-19T12:52:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	when you install from scratch, the installer writes an /etc/iftab with names for each interface
2004-09-19T12:52:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	which is then used to assign them the same names in the future
2004-09-19T12:53:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	please do test it
2004-09-19T12:53:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	if you yank the card corresponding to eth0, the other one should remain eth1
2004-09-19T12:53:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	no /etc/iftab exists here, I'm upgrading from a very early sounder (5 or so).
2004-09-19T12:53:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	that'd do it
2004-09-19T12:54:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	can I kick something to get it created?
2004-09-19T12:54:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	you can reinstall, which would be an excellent test for us :-)
2004-09-19T12:57:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	you're probably in the same position as lamont
2004-09-19T12:57:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	older CDs wouldn't have installed ifrename by default
2004-09-19T13:02:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	so about the mknod spew and bluetooth error -- should I be concerned enough to file bugs or are you on this?
2004-09-19T13:03:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	I don't have any bluetooth hardware, so I've no idea about that one
2004-09-19T13:03:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	I don't recall seeing any mknod errors, either.  if you could file a bug specifying which init script is producing the error, we should be able to track it down
2004-09-19T13:05:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	what is the error that you see?
2004-09-19T13:06:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	let me reboot without gdm so I can actually tell you.
2004-09-19T14:57:00.000Z	kiko	mdz	btw, the new bootup is significantly faster on this notebook.
2004-09-19T14:57:00.000Z	mdz	kiko	we optimized a few things
