2010-09-06T19:25:00.000Z	histo	rockhopper	also 10.10 will show the biggest changes to UNR with the new unity interface.
2010-09-06T19:25:00.000Z	rockhopper	histo	I was wondering coz, in 10.04, my brightness keys won't work...
2010-09-06T19:26:00.000Z	rockhopper	histo	but i can change it from the terminal!
2010-09-06T19:27:00.000Z	histo	rockhopper	you can boot to 10.04 and see if it helps with your brightness issues.  The install disk is fully bootable. Youc an even make a usb key to boot from.
2010-09-06T19:27:00.000Z	rockhopper	histo	I'm currently using the 10.04
2010-09-06T19:27:00.000Z	rockhopper		is that the one available?
2010-09-06T19:28:00.000Z	histo	rockhopper	okay then whats the question I thought you were asking about changes from 9.10
2010-09-06T19:28:00.000Z	rockhopper		I haven't tried the 9.10
2010-09-06T19:28:00.000Z	rockhopper		Yeah, i wan't to give 9.10 a try if the brightness keys work in it!
2010-09-06T19:28:00.000Z	rockhopper		if so, i can run it until 10.10's released
2010-09-06T19:28:00.000Z	histo	rockhopper	you can try the beta of 10.10
2010-09-06T19:28:00.000Z	rockhopper		ok

2010-09-06T19:29:00.000Z	rockhopper	histo	thanks!
2010-09-06T19:32:00.000Z	rockhopper	histo	is upgrading from 10.04 better or installing the fresh 10.10 beta better?
2010-09-06T19:32:00.000Z	histo	rockhopper	it's allt he same however I will caution that its Beta and not recomended for production machines. Discussion on 10.10 takes place in #ubuntu+1 channel.
