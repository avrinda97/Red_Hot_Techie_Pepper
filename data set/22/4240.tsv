2008-03-27T02:52:00.000Z	coubra		ok artenius
2008-03-27T02:52:00.000Z	polter	coubra	I guess one way to solve those problems would be to install from Nvidias script.. but that requires a bit of command line
2008-03-27T02:53:00.000Z	coubra	polter	what tha nvidia script
2008-03-27T02:53:00.000Z	polter	coubra	their official installer that is
2008-03-27T02:56:00.000Z	polter	coubra	have you rebooted your computer before using the driver?
2008-03-27T02:57:00.000Z	coubra	polter	 yes i doit
2008-03-27T02:57:00.000Z	polter	coubra	ok, then an unloaded kernel module probably isn't the problem
2008-03-27T02:58:00.000Z	polter	coubra	did you install your driver through the restricted manager?
2008-03-27T02:58:00.000Z	coubra	polter	 how unloaded kernel
2008-03-27T02:58:00.000Z	coubra	polter	 yes
2008-03-27T02:58:00.000Z	polter	coubra	hmm.. will do some googling
2008-03-27T02:58:00.000Z	coubra	polter	 yes and no work just froze
2008-03-27T03:00:00.000Z	polter	coubra	I had a similar problem when my 8400GS was brand new.. but installing from the official nvidia-script did the trick there
2008-03-27T03:01:00.000Z	coubra	polter	 how is official nvidia-scrip
2008-03-27T03:01:00.000Z	polter	coubra	haven't you tried all the different drivers from the repos?
2008-03-27T03:02:00.000Z	coubra	polter	 yes all driver
2008-03-27T03:02:00.000Z	polter	coubra	don't use envy before trying the different nvidia-drivers in the repos
