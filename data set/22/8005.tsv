2010-07-03T00:42:00.000Z	maco	raven	if you "man festival" somewhere in there it tells you how to get interactive mode. do that. then hit enter, and itll give a blank area. when you hit ctrl+D itll say whatever you typed in the blank area
2010-07-03T00:45:00.000Z	maco	raven	oh i know how to fix that
2010-07-03T00:46:00.000Z	raven	maco	yes?

2010-07-03T00:46:00.000Z	raven	maco	ok tnx
2010-07-03T00:48:00.000Z	raven	maco	ok but now it hangs on it seems - cpu 100% but nothing to hear
2010-07-03T00:50:00.000Z	maco	raven	i dont know. are you doing the interactive way i mentioned? if so, it wont speak til you ctrl+D
2010-07-03T00:51:00.000Z	raven	maco	no im in tts mode and ctrl d does not do anything
2010-07-03T00:51:00.000Z	maco	raven	i dont know. ive never used --tts
2010-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	raven	maco	perhaps any fault with the sound cfg?
2010-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	maco	raven	i dont know. those directions worked for one of my friends when she had the dsp problem
2010-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	raven	maco	ok...
2010-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	raven	maco	dont know what was the error but now it works - tnx
2010-08-16T04:00:00.000Z	maco	raven	^
2010-08-16T04:00:00.000Z	maco	raven	you're talking about your /internal/ ip, right?
2010-08-16T04:00:00.000Z	raven	maco	right
2010-08-16T04:00:00.000Z	maco	raven	/etc/network/interfaces is where you can setup a static ip
2010-08-16T04:01:00.000Z	maco	raven	there's a man page with the syntax;  man 5 interfaces
2010-08-16T04:01:00.000Z	maco	raven	would tell more, but ive never actually done static, so.... have to refer you to the manpage
2010-10-09T03:44:00.000Z	maco	raven	yum
