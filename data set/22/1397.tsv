2010-07-02T09:16:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	That looks like it's the best you're gonna get... :p I would try saving the document in .doc
2010-07-02T09:03:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	Can you explain again what the issue is?
2010-07-02T09:04:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	I am creating some bid sheets for an auction.  As long as the files were small (3 or 4 pages) there were no problem.  They are now 8 to 12 pages and worked fine until I close them.
2010-07-02T09:05:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	now when I open one the memory takes of and tops at about 2GB and the program is non responsive.  Sometimes it may try to act normal until I save the file and the same thing happens.
2010-07-02T09:05:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	Can you try opening those documents in AbiWord or Google Docs to see if you can save them in a different format?
2010-07-02T09:06:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	I will try.  I don't have AbiWord installed but I can.
2010-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	It might just be a problem with ooffice, but it might also be a problem with the documents themselves.
2010-07-02T09:10:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	google docs uploads them and shows them fine minus so layout and formating.
2010-07-02T09:11:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	it is also throwing away the header and footer
2010-07-02T09:12:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	Have you tried opening it in AbiWord?
2010-07-02T09:14:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	just installed AbiWord and trying now.
2010-07-02T09:15:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	AbiWord opens it about as well as GD.  It did keep the footer though.
2010-07-02T09:18:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	I did.  Well, I downloaded from GD in .doc.  I would save it that way from OO if I could open it.
2010-07-02T09:18:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	this is the first time that OO (linux / open source) has really let me down.  I have wasted hours on this and am so tempted to just do it at work with word.  Never thought I would think that.
2010-07-02T09:20:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	I'm sorry you're having problems... I don't like to use the .odf format. I usually don't mess around with it.
2010-07-02T09:44:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	found the problem if you are interested.
2010-07-02T09:45:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	I was using the draw toolbar to put in some horizontal dividing lines.  They were causing the crash.  I edited the content.xml and deleted all the <Draw:Line>...</Draw:Line> code sections and things seem to be happy.
2010-07-02T09:46:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	Nice! How did you figure that out?
2010-07-02T09:48:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	I had tried to delete them within OO.  I noticed they were not staying put to their anchor point.  Sense the crash got worse even on file that were good the more I opened them I did some snooping.  I searched the file I had deleted them from for Draw and noticed that there were still some in there even though I had deleted all the visible ones.  Just seemed odd to I removed the remaining ones.
2010-07-02T09:48:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	Hmm. I would stick to .doc from now on...
2010-07-02T09:49:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	tim	I will at least be avoiding the draw toolbar!
2010-07-02T09:49:00.000Z	tim	IdeAleSs	Haha. Good idea!
