2011-05-16T00:56:00.000Z	switchfoot		hi everyone im having some problems with ubuntu 11.04, whenever i login on "ubuntu" session desktop/unity wont appear, ill just have desktop icons (shortcuts) while if i use ubuntu classic ill lose the applications menu (file edit and so on) is there any way to fix it? i can provide further details just ask-- just thought i have a nvidia 8200m G card, probably it helps
2011-05-16T00:57:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	have you tries to go to additional drivers ?
2011-05-16T00:57:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	yup, without drivers i have a warning (unity cant start) with drivers there is that problem, anyways with or without driver classic session wont give me applications menu

2011-05-16T01:00:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	try to clear out the mods through synptic then reinstall
2011-05-16T01:00:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	did it i use PAE kernel, thought that it may be the issue so i tried with non PAE, still ending up there tho
2011-05-16T01:02:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	is jockey-gtk installed ?
2011-05-16T01:02:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	yes, i used it to get my drivers
2011-05-16T01:02:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	the first time, second i tried from site but it was a bloodbath lol
2011-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	i should try myself? lol
2011-05-16T01:05:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	i made sure jockey ran with root privileges, in fact in apt log i have the drivers install entry, if thats what you want to achieve
2011-05-16T01:06:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	what dmesg say
2011-05-16T01:06:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	oddly enough on 10.10 unity would install and work, but mutter would kill my cpu lol (lil bug i suppose but it worked)
2011-05-16T01:06:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	say about what?
2011-05-16T01:06:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	what a modinfo
2011-05-16T01:07:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	http://paste.ubuntu.com/607998/
2011-05-16T01:09:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	looks good what about the modinf
2011-05-16T01:09:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	i beg your pardon?
2011-05-16T01:11:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	googling brb
2011-05-16T01:13:00.000Z	bobweaver	switchfoot	is there a difference when running jockey in root at all?
2011-05-16T01:14:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	not sure but you know "always try"
2011-05-16T01:15:00.000Z	switchfoot	bobweaver	i did run with both privs and both installed stuff so id say there is no diff or probably jockey is set with suid lol
