2008-04-20T02:25:00.000Z	dabbill		I am trying to get grub to boot my xp drive, but it just says starting up ...... and never boots
2008-04-20T02:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman	dabbill	do you get the XP loading screen?
2008-04-20T02:25:00.000Z	dabbill	dmsuperman	nope
2008-04-20T02:26:00.000Z	dabbill	dmsuperman	just goes to a black screen saying starting up......
2008-04-20T02:27:00.000Z	dmsuperman	dabbill	I was just going to suggest a screenshot, luckily i stopped myself ;) Type all the text that it says, verbatim
2008-04-20T02:27:00.000Z	dabbill	dmsuperman	do what?
2008-04-20T02:28:00.000Z	dmsuperman	dabbill	Anything that it says beside "Staring up...." will help us determine what's actually going on
2008-04-20T02:28:00.000Z	dabbill	dmsuperman	thats all it says on the screen nothing else comes up after i hit enter to load Windows XP from grub menu
2008-04-20T02:29:00.000Z	dmsuperman	dabbill	Is it possible that your grub is pointing to the wrong partition for windows?
2008-04-20T02:30:00.000Z	dabbill	dmsuperman	pretty sure its pointing to the right partition.
2008-04-20T02:30:00.000Z	dmsuperman	dabbill	What's your menu.lst say for windows XP? The whole portion, pastebin it

2008-04-20T02:33:00.000Z	dmsuperman	dabbill	I knkow a lot of people that boot into windows need to remap the drives so that Windows is on hd0
2008-04-20T02:34:00.000Z	dmsuperman	dabbill	Try adding this to your Windows section, just below the title:map (hd0)(hd1)
2008-04-20T02:36:00.000Z	dabbill	dmsuperman	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63779/   like this?
