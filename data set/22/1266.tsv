2010-07-29T11:31:00.000Z	hstefan		hello. I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 in my laptop, but I'm stuck with my ethernet controller (SIS191 gigabit), that doesn't work (it even notice that there's an network avaiable). Please help me!
2010-07-29T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	is that what is output in: sudo lshw -C network
2010-07-29T11:33:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	for checking this, I should be connect to any network?
2010-07-29T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	not necessary. The command merely scans the hardware

2010-07-29T11:38:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	oh, looks complicated. But thanks, I'll do my best.
2010-07-29T11:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	you'll need to do it everytime you get a new kernel too so keep the source handy
2010-07-29T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	+1 their video cards are fun to setup too and need xorg.conf files
2010-07-29T11:41:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	yeah, I have a SIS671 too. It was a pain to work in better resolution.
2010-07-29T11:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	if you check the hcl before purchasing it makes life easier
2010-07-29T11:44:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	yeah, but as I said before, it was a present (from my mother) and she knows shit about hardware.
2010-07-29T11:46:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	ooh, waait. I dunno if that howto you sent me will work. I don't get any error when execute 'modprobe sis190'
2010-07-29T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	oooh exciting. Try: ifconfig
2010-07-29T11:48:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	dunno if you saw the last message but: what should I search on ifconfig's output?
2010-07-29T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	if you have a new interface name
2010-07-29T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	indeed
2010-07-29T11:49:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	well, it always been there, so nothing changed...
2010-07-29T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	ok then try: sudo dhclient eth0
2010-07-29T11:51:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	now I need internet connection, right?
2010-07-29T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	i'd also run: dmesg | tail ,to check the kernel messages
2010-07-29T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hstefan	did the lights on the interface flash?
2010-07-29T11:58:00.000Z	hstefan	ActionParsnip	what do you mean?
