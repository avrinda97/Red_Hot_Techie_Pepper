2006-10-09T10:02:00.000Z	keleus		arg why does nobody want to tell me what do do with this thing?
2006-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	keleus		i have a has hand i have NO WAY to tell how to use it
2006-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	keleus		a .DIGESTS file
2006-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	keleus		it has some kind of ssh1 and md5 sum
2006-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	keleus		but i cant get openssl OR md5sum to work with it
2006-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	if nobody is helping ya then try goggle ...
2006-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	keleus	wickedpuppy	i tried, but google keeps stripping out the period
2006-10-09T10:04:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	btw what do you want to do with that file ? actually what is the problem ?
2006-10-09T10:05:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	and how did you search on the google ? the search phrase was ??
2006-10-09T10:06:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	have you try putting .digest behind ? like verify .digest file ?
2006-10-09T10:08:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	that i do not know but i suppose you can go mad over it or go around that by putting .digest behind ... your choice really ..
2006-10-09T10:09:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	try this "md5 .digest verify"
2006-10-09T10:10:00.000Z	keleus	wickedpuppy	that wont work, it will look for the whole phrase.
2006-10-09T10:11:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	i suppose i am not part of everyone ...
2006-10-09T10:13:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	i can find out md5 checksum but not digest
2006-10-09T10:14:00.000Z	keleus	wickedpuppy	im pastebinning the DIGESTS file, maybe you would recognize it?
2006-10-09T10:16:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	keleus	do this md5sum filename
2006-10-09T10:16:00.000Z	keleus	wickedpuppy	did that. didn't work
