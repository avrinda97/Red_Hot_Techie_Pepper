2008-04-03T05:16:00.000Z	RandoCal		goog evening everyone
2008-04-03T05:17:00.000Z	RandoCal		When I want to SSH from my Ubuntu box to other machines in the house I've been just opening a terminal window and then typing in "ssh -l user xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" of the other box, is there a way to make myself a "shortcut" to terminal that automatically puts this info?
2008-04-03T05:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 you could always make some alias's in your bashrc.
2008-04-03T05:19:00.000Z	RandoCal		Ideally, i'd like an icon on my top panel, that just opens an SSH session automatically to my other linux box
2008-04-03T05:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 theres a tool that does that for gnome ive seen. It may be under hardy.
2008-04-03T05:20:00.000Z	RandoCal	Dr_willis	kk, i'll give that a try once i upgrade
2008-04-03T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 i cant find the name right now. :) it was some taskbar applet for gnome. ya enter the various ssh ip/options and it was just a simple menu.
2008-04-03T05:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 you could do about the same thing with a few scripts. easially enough
2008-04-03T05:21:00.000Z	RandoCal		Can I launch terminal with a switch command to have it autoconnect to a specific IP with a specific username?
2008-04-03T05:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 sshmenu - A standalone and a Gnome panel applet for connecting to hosts using SSH
2008-04-03T05:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 most of the terminalapps have a -e EXEXUTE SOMTHING  option
2008-04-03T05:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis		xterm -e 'ssh whatever '
2008-04-03T05:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!info sshmenu
2008-04-03T05:24:00.000Z	RandoCal		yup, doesn't exist in gutsy
2008-04-03T05:26:00.000Z	RandoCal		I'm pretty new to running a linux machine as my desktop OS..... i've had a couple linux servers for a while, and would normally just use putty to admin them. Now i'm looking to admin them from my Ubuntu box, do people generally just use the included terminal app? or is there better terminal programs that most tend to use?
2008-04-03T05:27:00.000Z	RandoCal		so just run terminal from my accesories, and then ssh over like i've been doing
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	RandoCal		cool
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 make an alias for each machines with the proper ssh command. Is rahter easy.
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	RandoCal		i'm able to SSH across no problems, i know how to get connected, i'm just looking for an easier way, rather than having to type in "ssh -l username ipaddress" each time
2008-04-03T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 i tend to just use xterms, or gnome-terminal. thers others you can try. for X based terminals. Be sure to learn to use screen.
2008-04-03T05:29:00.000Z	RandoCal		yeah, i've heard screen is the good stuff
2008-04-03T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RandoCal	 'alas goremote=ssh long command line '
