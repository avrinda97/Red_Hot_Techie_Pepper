2011-04-27T01:56:00.000Z	J697		Using Ubuntu 10.10 on an older computer and wireless is a big problem with it. I have tried everything, I updated the system with Update Manager, then went to the install blah blah drivers and tried the B43 Wireless drive (which worked the first time, a long time ago) but now I always get a "SystemError: installArchives() failed" error right after I click activate on the B43 Wireless drive. Can anyone please help me?

2011-04-27T02:01:00.000Z	usr13	J697	Ok, well, those BCM4312-LP-PHY wifi devices are a problem.  This is a laptop?
2011-04-27T02:02:00.000Z	J697	usr13	yes ut is
2011-04-27T02:02:00.000Z	usr13	J697	If it were me, I'd take the thing out and get another one.
2011-04-27T02:03:00.000Z	J697	usr13	I do but my sisters use the internet all the time, so there is absolutely no way to fix it?
2011-04-27T02:03:00.000Z	usr13	J697	What is the make and model of the laptop?
2011-04-27T02:04:00.000Z	J697	usr13	Dell and honestly I don't really know how old etc it is
2011-04-27T02:05:00.000Z	J697	usr13	Inspiron 1525 also

2011-04-27T02:08:00.000Z	J697	usr13	let me try that right quick
2011-04-27T02:18:00.000Z	J697	usr13	I did what the guy in the thread did, rebooted, went to install addition drives (STA Wireless was installed) changed it to B43 Wireless, then rebooted and now under wireless connections is says "Wireless is disabled", I don't ever remember disabling it :\ How can I re-enable it now?
2011-04-27T02:19:00.000Z	usr13	J697	It's a switch or keystoke combination on the laptop.  You just have to look for it.
2011-04-27T02:19:00.000Z	usr13	J697	you should see it on there someplace...
2011-04-27T02:20:00.000Z	J697	usr13	so this means it will work, correct? Or is there still a chance it's screwed up?
2011-04-27T02:20:00.000Z	J697	usr13	in the setup Wireless is enabled, whats the deal with that?
2011-04-27T02:26:00.000Z	usr13	J697	iwconfig | pastebinit
