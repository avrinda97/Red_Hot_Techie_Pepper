2004-12-06T10:29:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		does ubuntu use the older version of the debian installer than debian testing
2004-12-06T10:30:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		i get a red screen that says no network card found
2004-12-06T10:31:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		does ubuntu use an older version of the debian installer than debian sarge installer rc2
2004-12-06T10:32:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	in warty, yes
2004-12-06T10:32:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	seeing as warty was released considerably earlier than rc2
2004-12-06T10:32:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	are you using the hoary installer?
2004-12-06T10:33:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	what network card?
2004-12-06T10:34:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	can you send that information plus the output of 'cut -f1,2 /proc/bus/pci/devices' in a bug report, please?
2004-12-06T10:34:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	oh, hmm
2004-12-06T10:35:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	that's probably not so much a matter of newness as the fact that we run at a higher debconf priority to reduce the number of questions.
2004-12-06T10:35:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	try booting in expert mode, see what you get
2004-12-06T10:38:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	I've already put that option back in Hoary
2004-12-06T10:38:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	there was some ... debate between me and my boss about what the partitioner options should look like in warty :)
2004-12-06T12:27:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	switch to tty2, modprobe the thing you need?
2004-12-06T12:27:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	did you try expert mode, like I suggested?
2004-12-06T12:28:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	in response to your earlier question about what version of the sarge installer ours is based on, it's not possible to give an answer to that; debian-installer is made up of lots of packages, and we merge them gradually and semi-independently
2004-12-06T12:28:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	warty is roughly somewhere around rc1 with some later bits
2004-12-06T12:29:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	modprobe <whatever-module-you-need>
2004-12-06T12:30:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	are you reading what I'm saying?
2004-12-06T12:40:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	there's support for isa devices, but it's not well-tested, largely because not many of the developers have any any more
2004-12-06T12:40:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	it's probably a relatively small change to fix your case though
2004-12-06T12:40:00.000Z	Kamion	KeithWeisshar	which is why I asked if you could please file a bug so it ends up on my to-do list
