2008-12-01T21:18:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	it only tells your local IP, which, if you are just on the public internet, will also be your external ip
2008-12-01T21:19:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	that means you have more than one interfaces
2008-12-01T21:19:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	are you using some sort of PPPoE connection?
2008-12-01T21:20:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	in which case there'd be 2 ips, one is of your network interface, another is the ip you get from the PPPoE connection, i.e. your external ip
2008-12-01T21:21:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	basically it's this way: if you *already* have an external ip(you are directly connected to the Internet), you could just look it up
2008-12-01T21:21:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	if you don't have one then you have to query your Gateway to get it, whatever the gateway is
2008-12-01T21:21:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	and I don't quite get the "remote ip" you are mentioning
2008-12-01T21:22:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	it might be better if you just tell us what you are trying to accomplish.
2008-12-01T21:24:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	if you are not directly connected to the internet, your IP address won't be seen by others
2008-12-01T21:25:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	and you appears to be using a different ip address to them, i.e. the "externel" ip address
2008-12-01T21:25:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	*sometimes* websites like whatsmyip could be not accurate
2008-12-01T21:29:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Guest37277	what do you mean by ip scanner? if you want a port scanner use nmap
