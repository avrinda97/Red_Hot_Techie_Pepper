2008-08-16T22:35:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	use ntfsfix on the volume
2008-08-16T22:35:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	with sudo?
2008-08-16T22:35:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	yes.. sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb2  or whatever device it is
2008-08-16T22:36:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	it says command not found
2008-08-16T22:36:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	ok.. install ntfsprogs first
2008-08-16T22:36:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs
2008-08-16T22:38:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	It says volume is corrupt, run chkdsk :|
2008-08-16T22:38:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	hmm.. ok.. never had ntfsfix fail me before.. I don't know if fsck can do ntfs.. give it a try.. if not I guess you'll have to boot windows and run chkdsk from there
2008-08-16T22:39:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	ahh :(((
2008-08-16T22:39:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	damn windows. :@
2008-08-16T22:39:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	nah.. you can't really blame windows for this..
2008-08-16T22:40:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	What could be the reason?
2008-08-16T22:40:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	I think you can just add a -f to the command line
2008-08-16T22:41:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	Can you tell me the complete command. I had never mount any device through terminal.
2008-08-16T22:42:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	it's "sudo mount <device> <mountpoint>".. mountpoint is usually a folder in /media but it doesn't have to be
2008-08-16T22:42:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	then there are a gazillion switches and stuff you can use..
2008-08-16T22:44:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	lose the /
2008-08-16T22:44:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	just /dev/sda6
2008-08-16T22:45:00.000Z	Slart	isharis	you have to create the mountpoint first
2008-08-16T22:45:00.000Z	isharis	Slart	I have the mountpoint in /media
