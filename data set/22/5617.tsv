2007-04-27T13:24:00.000Z	kahrytan		Menza: They should disable that for ubuntu.
2007-04-27T13:25:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	that's a "feature", not a bug.
2007-04-27T13:26:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	good point, but it's also a linux standard
2007-04-27T13:30:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	I agree, good idea, except when X doesn't boot on fresh install.
2007-04-27T13:30:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	which happens more often than you might think
2007-04-27T13:31:00.000Z	kahrytan	auTONYmous	I understand. Just add message to the screen to help newbies exit it if done accidently.
2007-04-27T13:32:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	 then I guess its just a matter of putting that in the default MOTD
2007-04-27T13:33:00.000Z	kahrytan	auTONYmous	can I suggest it somewhere?
2007-04-27T13:33:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	I'd suggest contacting either the Ubuntu-Desktop or Ubuntu-Distribution teams. Stick it in the forums and see what response you get.
2007-04-27T13:34:00.000Z	kahrytan	auTONYmous	Do you think a newbie would know to exit that mode?
2007-04-27T13:35:00.000Z	kahrytan	auTONYmous	Better yet, reboot correctly.
2007-04-27T13:35:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	I think someone brand new to computers or a convert from Windows wouldn't know what the deal was.
2007-04-27T13:35:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	So, you have a very valid point.
2007-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	incidentally, there's 6 of those (control-alt-f1 through f6)
2007-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	kahrytan	auTONYmous	What is it?
2007-04-27T13:37:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	it's the console, or the core text-mode layer that runs on every *nix system. The X windows system simply runs atop that for GUI goodness, but most things happen on the console.
2007-04-27T13:38:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	it's like DOS when windows 95/98 were around. Same concept
2007-04-27T13:38:00.000Z	kahrytan	auTONYmous	Except Win98 doesn't take you out of Windows when you use ctrl-alt-f1-6
2007-04-27T13:39:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	yeah, and DOS has nowhere near the functionality in that mode that *nix does.
2007-04-27T13:40:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	so Microsoft hid it from Windows users, whereas *nix embraces it, and experienced users are more familiar with it (or dare I say, more productive!)
2007-04-27T13:43:00.000Z	auTONYmous	kahrytan	has a very good point that can help make ubuntu a little more "noob-friendly", which has apparently grown into a large focus for many of the distro teams
