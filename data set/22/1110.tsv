2011-05-28T07:27:00.000Z	russjr08		Hey, guys, I want to resize my home and root partition and create a new partition (going to make a triple boot with GRUB), do I just resize them and then run sudo update-grub from the live cd? I don't know if it will run the utility directly from the usb or...?
2011-05-28T07:29:00.000Z	russjr08		anyone?
2011-05-28T07:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	no need to run update-grub if you are only resizing partitions
2011-05-28T07:32:00.000Z	russjr08	ActionParsnip	I'm going to create a new partition too, I think that would change the UUID of all of the partitions, right?
2011-05-28T07:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	possibly, can't hurt I guess ;)
2011-05-28T07:33:00.000Z	russjr08	ActionParsnip	would running update-grub already know that I want to update my installation's grub and not the live usb's grub?
2011-05-28T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	you will need to chroot
2011-05-28T07:41:00.000Z	russjr08	ActionParsnip	what's that?
2011-05-28T07:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	have a websearch and you'l see, you need to change the root where the command is ran so it affects the installed disk
2011-05-28T07:57:00.000Z	russjr08	ActionParsnip	Ok, I have a Ubuntu 10.04 CD, but I have installed Ubuntu 11.04, will update-grub still work and stuff, and can I resize the partition from there?
2011-05-29T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	immediately after inserting it, run:  dmesg | tail   it may give clues
2011-05-29T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	is the drive partitioned?
2011-05-29T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	sure
2011-05-29T02:29:00.000Z	russjr08	ActionParsnip	it came formatted as FAT32, I just formatted it as NTFS
2011-05-29T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	yeah fat32 isn't very robust. Did you safetly remove the device when you last unplugged the device?
2011-05-29T02:30:00.000Z	russjr08	ActionParsnip	yup
2011-05-29T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	good, that cures a billion issues.

2011-05-29T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	you missed the pipe to tail, its ok this time but misrunning commands can break your OS
2011-05-29T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	can you manually mount /dev/sdb1 ?
2011-05-29T02:39:00.000Z	russjr08	ActionParsnip	yup, then it comes up. But I was wondering if it will auto mount like my other drives
2011-05-29T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	russjr08	not sure there dude
