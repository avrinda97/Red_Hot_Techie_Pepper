2008-05-30T19:40:00.000Z	plasticmac		hi, I have a network drive mounted via sftp:
2008-05-30T19:40:00.000Z	plasticmac		but I can't figure out how to get at it from the terminal
2008-05-30T19:40:00.000Z	plasticmac		I don't see the volume when I type "mount"
2008-05-30T19:41:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	how do you know its mounted? mount usually wont lie
2008-05-30T19:41:00.000Z	plasticmac	thefish	well I see it in the file explorer and the context menu gives me the option to "unmount"
2008-05-30T19:42:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	i think that may be a "favourite" or something, there is a cool way to do it from the terminal though: sshfs
2008-05-30T19:43:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	install sshfs, then add yourself to the "fuse" group - log out and in again and then you can just (as yourself, no sudo needed) sshfs user@host:/path /local/mount/point
2008-05-30T19:43:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	then it is actually mounted as well, so you can get to it with terminal and nautilus etc
2008-05-30T19:50:00.000Z	plasticmac	thefish	okay so I installed sshfs but it's not immediately obvious how to add myself to the fuse group
2008-05-30T19:50:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	you can use the gui, or just `adduser plasticmac fuse` - assuming your username is plasticmac :)
2008-05-30T19:51:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	the console is a lot quicker, and makes you look like a 1337 haX0r
2008-05-30T19:51:00.000Z	plasticmac	thefish	it tends to make me look like a dunce but I suppose with time... :-)
2008-05-30T19:52:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	you will find that with extended console use you become a lot more attractive to the opposite sex as well
2008-05-30T19:52:00.000Z	plasticmac	thefish	yes my sex life improved immeasurably when I switched from Visual Studio to vim
2008-05-30T19:52:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	exactly, now use the console - think of the ch1X0rs
2008-05-30T19:56:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	hmm maybe you did it earlier
2008-05-30T19:57:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	now all you need to do is, on console: sshfs server:/path /local/path
2008-05-30T19:58:00.000Z	plasticmac	thefish	wicked, that worked
2008-05-30T19:59:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	told you so :) and at the same time you became more attractive to women - *INSTANTLY* !!!1!1!!!ONE!
2008-05-30T19:59:00.000Z	plasticmac	thefish	will they just show up at my flat or do I have to hang out in cafes with my laptop?
2008-05-30T20:00:00.000Z	thefish	plasticmac	i think the cafes thing is best. ymmv
2008-05-30T20:00:00.000Z	plasticmac	thefish	I'll let you know how that works out for me
