2006-04-29T09:45:00.000Z	vapor		New to Ubuntu Linux, want to know how to get an app to launch at startup. (sudo & gksudo does not work)
2006-04-29T09:46:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	select System | Preferences | Sessions | Startup Programs
2006-04-29T09:46:00.000Z	vapor		Doesn't work in the sessions
2006-04-29T09:46:00.000Z	vapor		Launch form the teminal works
2006-04-29T09:46:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	what is it you're running?
2006-04-29T09:46:00.000Z	vapor		firestarter
2006-04-29T09:47:00.000Z	vapor		anarrgh
2006-04-29T09:47:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	firestarter is a frontend to iptables, iptables runs automatically
2006-04-29T09:47:00.000Z	vapor		so how do I get the thing to start at system login
2006-04-29T09:48:00.000Z	vapor	anto9us	 ps -A doesn't list it unless I start it
2006-04-29T09:49:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	the frirewall will function without firestarter being open
2006-04-29T09:49:00.000Z	vapor		OK does that mean it is running though it isn't listed in ps?
2006-04-29T09:50:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	iptables is part of the kernel, I do believe
2006-04-29T09:50:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IptablesHowTo
2006-04-29T09:50:00.000Z	vapor		Well thats good news thought discomforting that I can't verify its existance.
2006-04-29T09:51:00.000Z	vapor		Thanks for the help. Will check the link. :)
2006-04-29T09:51:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	that web page tells you how to verify
2006-04-29T09:52:00.000Z	vapor		Thanks again. Will be back again in the futer I'm sure. Unix made easy doesn't quite cut it. LOL
2006-04-29T09:52:00.000Z	anto9us	vapor	sometimes it's a matter of unlearning :)
