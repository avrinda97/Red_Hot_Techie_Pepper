2005-01-13T06:04:00.000Z	jerkface	crimsun	i don't want to use esd
2005-01-13T06:05:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	is your sound chipset capable of software mixing in hardware, like a sblive or turtle beach santa cruz?
2005-01-13T06:07:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	what sound card is listed in /proc/asound/cards?
2005-01-13T06:08:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	so you're using snd-intel8x0?
2005-01-13T06:09:00.000Z	jerkface	crimsun	nope, i guess not
2005-01-13T06:09:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	...you should be. Verify with: lsmod|grep snd_intel8x0

2005-01-13T06:11:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	no need, that explains what I needed it to.
2005-01-13T06:11:00.000Z	jerkface	crimsun	yes, theres a good few entries for it
2005-01-13T06:15:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	yes, and the driver it uses is the snd-intel8x0 ALSA driver
2005-01-13T06:15:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	which means you'll have to configure dmix if you wish to hear multiple sounds simultaneously
2005-01-13T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	dmix is on the alsa wiki.
2005-01-13T06:19:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	look under AlsaSharing on http://alsa.opensrc.org

2005-01-13T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	no
2005-01-13T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	it will conflict, and you'll get an error(s)
2005-01-13T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	if you want to use ALSA, then use ALSA completely
2005-01-13T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	jerkface	tell everything to use ALSA by default
