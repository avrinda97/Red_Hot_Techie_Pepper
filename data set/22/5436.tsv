2008-10-02T07:07:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	irc?
2008-10-02T06:53:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	check your internet cord?
2008-10-02T06:53:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	WAN
2008-10-02T06:54:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	yeah, you know, the physical medium that connects you TO the WAN? is it loose or anything like that?
2008-10-02T06:55:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	what about packetloss to the remote host that you're using ssh with?
2008-10-02T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	you may find better help in #networking
2008-10-02T06:57:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	its not a networking problem, cause putty connects and wireing the laptops also makes the problem disappear, my guess is  configs
2008-10-02T06:58:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	if your ssh connection is lagging, then obviously it's a networking problem. if it's configs, then why are you asking about it instead of reading the manpage for sshd_config and experimenting?
2008-10-02T07:00:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	it doesnt lag it just stops after "ok ack" of my key or pass it never shows the remote command line
2008-10-02T07:00:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	and how long does it stop before you kill it?
2008-10-02T07:02:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	have you tried increasing the priority of ssh traffic over others?
2008-10-02T07:02:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	using what method?
2008-10-02T07:03:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	no, previous answer was not for your q.
2008-10-02T07:03:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	oh ok.
2008-10-02T07:03:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	what do you suggest?
2008-10-02T07:04:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	you should increase the priority of ssh traffic over others. #networking and #iptables would be able to help you out there
2008-10-02T07:04:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	either with traffic shaping or tc
2008-10-02T07:05:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	Could it be some sort of routing problem, i think the router is receiving server response but it is not forwarding it to me correctly, wireshark observation
2008-10-02T07:05:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	?
2008-10-02T07:05:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	this goes beyond routing
2008-10-02T07:06:00.000Z	jorge__	Gnea	any other sources i might find helpfull?
2008-10-02T07:07:00.000Z	Gnea	jorge__	as I already stated: #networking and #iptables (use /join #networking)
