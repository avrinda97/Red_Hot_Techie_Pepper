2007-01-24T12:38:00.000Z	Marupa		hey everyone, I've got a little bug that's bugging me.  I'm trying to run amarok (it was working last night, but crashed) and ps aux | grepping it found the process, but I'm not seeing it at all on my X session.  Any clues?
2007-01-24T12:40:00.000Z	Marupa		also, what's that terminal mp3 player?
2007-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	Marupa		does it play any/all MP3s from a directory at random?
2007-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	Marupa		thank you, lojikal .
2007-01-24T12:43:00.000Z	Marupa		go to ~/.Trash and rm the files, tuskernini./
2007-01-24T12:44:00.000Z	Marupa		Welcome, tuskernini.
2007-01-24T12:45:00.000Z	Marupa		bah.  this is ticking me off.  x.x  I go crazy without MP3s  :D  I either need some sort of terminal MP3 player or get amarok back working again.
2007-01-24T12:46:00.000Z	Marupa		was about to say that, |Jason8|.  You beat me to it.
2007-01-24T12:46:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	mpd?
2007-01-24T12:47:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	mpd is command line, also beep media player is xmms but newer basically
2007-01-24T12:56:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	but sound is fine from mpg123-alsa or mpg123?
2007-01-24T12:57:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	I would check alsamixer and make sure all the levels are set correctly
2007-01-24T12:59:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	check alsamixer and make sure you have the levels turned up
2007-01-24T13:00:00.000Z	Marupa	cpk1	The levels are fine.
2007-01-24T13:02:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	not sure this applies for you but when i was getting my digital out to work i was having problems with low volume because my ac97 levels werent all the way to 0
2007-01-24T13:07:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	whats wrong with amarok
2007-01-24T13:07:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	you could also try exhaile its supposed to be amarok with gtk more or less
2007-01-24T13:07:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	not showing up? tries to load and then doesnt?
2007-01-24T13:30:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	does amarok still play? is it only the gui that is messed up?
2007-01-24T13:31:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	open a console and do amarok --play
2007-01-24T13:33:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	amarok depends on kde is why
2007-01-24T13:34:00.000Z	cpk1	Marupa	first I would try to run amarok as a different user
