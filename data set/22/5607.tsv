2007-12-18T10:49:00.000Z	Nubbie		ryan8403: expect data loss.
2007-12-18T10:49:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	ok thanks for the input, I think I will stick with a regular drive.
2007-12-18T10:51:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	$$?
2007-12-18T10:58:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	i kinda want to get a solid state drive... max my battery out like 10+ hours, and just use an external hard drive / thumb drives for data.
2007-12-18T10:59:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	yeah thats the idea i want to do for my home server, its a koolu box, but I may wait for the ssd prices to come down first
2007-12-18T10:59:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	also notice the seagate 1.8" 32GB model for $400
2007-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	that why i thought of the CF idea, cuz i only need like 4gigs for OS space, to bad the don't do a cheap 4gig ssd ;)
2007-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	an expresscard one is cheaper.
2007-12-18T11:02:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	$55 for 4GB
2007-12-18T11:02:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	where??
2007-12-18T11:03:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820191056
2007-12-18T11:04:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	interesting never seen one of those before, how does it connect?
2007-12-18T11:04:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	shit i keep tab pwning that dude.
2007-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	lol, expressport? hmm where have i been, anything like a pcmcia slot?
2007-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	yes, only it's PCIe
2007-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	ah gotcha
2007-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	expresscard slots are both USB and PCI enabled.
2007-12-18T11:06:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	and are much smaller ;)
2007-12-18T11:06:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	but would there be any way to make this work internally? so sort of expressport -> ide adapter ?
2007-12-18T11:07:00.000Z	Nubbie	ryancr	i dunno, look into that. i'm doubtful, but look into it yourself.
2007-12-18T11:26:00.000Z	ryancr	Nubbie	well the best I can find is a usb - > expresscard adaptor
