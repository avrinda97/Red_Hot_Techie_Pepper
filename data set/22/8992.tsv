2005-04-12T16:37:00.000Z	tomcat		Hi All, I've got a quick question... perhaps a general one...
2005-04-12T16:37:00.000Z	tomcat		I've got a .deb file for something I want to install, but I don't know how to install it.
2005-04-12T16:37:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	sudo dpkg -i package
2005-04-12T16:38:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	thx!
2005-04-12T16:46:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	why not just use apt-get for the gimp?
2005-04-12T16:48:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	I think whomever built the .deb named it wrong... where did I find this thing... ./?
2005-04-12T16:49:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	do : sudo apt-get install gimp
2005-04-12T16:49:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	though check it isn't already isntalled... Ubuntu comes with the Gimp installed as default :)
2005-04-12T16:50:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	this is just a frontend for the gimp, and I think the .deb I was trying to get might be named incorrectly
2005-04-12T16:50:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	where did you download it from?
2005-04-12T16:51:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	it's mentioned on slashdot
2005-04-12T16:52:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	got that gimp deb package from http://cmb.phys.cwru.edu/kisner/gimpshop/
2005-04-12T16:54:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	did you try redownloading it? sometimes files become corrupt when you download
2005-04-12T16:56:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	yeah, that must be it..  ... I do want to try this out before adobe sues the developers into pulling this package
2005-04-12T16:57:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	if you want to use amsn and mplayer, I suggest you get them sooner rather than later
2005-04-12T16:59:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	thx for the tip. http://codemills.com/blog/?p=4 is the site with the linux version of gimpshop. He says he's gonna compile an official .deb for it...  He's updated the site in the past few hours, so I think he'll have somethi8ng more ubuntu friendly in the next few hours
2005-04-12T05:01:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	It skins GIMP to look like photoshop... which, for me would be very, very helpful.. and ensure I use my linux box more.
2005-04-12T05:03:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	Yeah, honestly, I've made the adjustment to gnome... my 1st linux install was frickin gentoo (like ubuntu/synaptic much better) so i'm used to jumping in headfirst... but I really go back a long way with photoshop...
2005-04-12T05:05:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	yeah gentoo isn't exacrtly newbie friendly :)
2005-04-12T05:06:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	A fact they'll gladly point out on their user forums instaed of answering specific questions.
2005-04-12T05:06:00.000Z	Dalkus	tomcat	how do you mean?
2005-04-12T05:07:00.000Z	tomcat	Dalkus	Gentoo forums != helpful
