2012-05-24T12:11:00.000Z	stueng		hello. under ubuntu server with xorg installed and XBMC the performnace of XBMC is sluggish unless I startx as root
2012-05-24T12:12:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	i had the same issue, the problem was das pulseaudio was not running and xbmc tried to contact it all the time
2012-05-24T12:12:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	then i used lightdm with xbmc-standalone
2012-05-24T12:13:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	lightdm is starting pulse, dbus and so on correctly, you are missing pulse and dbus
2012-05-24T12:13:00.000Z	stueng	iceroot	I dont have a DE, just plain xorg. what is xbmc-standlone ?
2012-05-24T12:13:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	xbmc-standalone is an entry in lightdm just like unity, lxde, kde and so on
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	and your problem is you have plain-x and you are not starting pulse and dbus
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	stueng	iceroot	I dont want or have lightdm
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	then start pulse, dbus and so on
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	stueng	iceroot	ok, so I should install pulse and dbus
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	you also have to start them
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	stueng	iceroot	ok, start then using the service command?
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	i dont see a problem having lightdm + session "xbmc-standalone" with autologin
2012-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	you will not see lightdm then
2012-05-24T12:15:00.000Z	stueng	iceroot	sounds good, ill try it
2012-05-24T12:15:00.000Z	stueng	iceroot	so I will install lightdm, pulse, dbus and then edit lightdm.cfg to make my default session xbmc-standalone ?
2012-05-24T12:16:00.000Z	iceroot	stueng	correct
