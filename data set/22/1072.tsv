2011-03-10T03:03:00.000Z	cryptodira		i did an 'alternate' install/upgrade of 10.10 amd/64 from the iso (no cd burning) on a fully updated 10.04 amd64 laptop...grub (which i never had before) now presents me with 4 options and generic and recovery of 2.6.35.22 and 2.6.32.29 kernels....the 35 simply hangs... the 32 will hang on the first boot.... and will only complete if i try the recovery choice for that one and then finally boot the .32 version again .... i do NOT th
2011-03-10T03:03:00.000Z	cryptodira		ink this is normal.... how can i fix it?
2011-03-10T03:04:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	burn a disk, clean install?
2011-03-10T03:05:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	yep, burned a disk.... will NOT install
2011-03-10T03:05:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	did you md5 the iso?
2011-03-10T03:06:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	yepper..... always md5 stuff before installing
2011-03-10T03:06:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	so what happens when you try and install?
2011-03-10T03:08:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	have you selected try ubuntu?
2011-03-10T03:08:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	amd/64 on a toshiba laptop
2011-03-10T03:08:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	i assume your laptop is 64bit?
2011-03-10T03:09:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	 trying ubuntu delivers the same response.... blank screen... blinking cursor... yes, this machine is an amd/64 machine with NO other os... only ubuntu
2011-03-10T03:10:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	well then alls i can sugest is the iso is somehow damaged, mayb the disk didn't burn properly, did you use the verification?
2011-03-10T03:11:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	yepper... the disk verified... this was/is an upgrade from a fully updated 10.04 amd64 with the exception of OPERA not being upgraded... no public key ... to verify with.
2011-03-10T03:12:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	 the other problem... once i have booted.... the sound and network apps for the top panel were/are missing.... the cli commands only restore mail and display.
2011-03-10T03:14:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	i thought you were doing a clean install? you can upgrade from 10.04 without a disk?
2011-03-10T03:15:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	 sure... use the alternate iso and run from the cli.... goes much faster than from the disk...
2011-03-10T03:16:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	ok, so did you try upgrading to 10.10 using the update manager at all?
2011-03-10T03:16:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	 i was unable to get the 10.10 live cd to run.... so i went with the alternate that can be used without a net connection or cd
2011-03-10T03:16:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	you already have ubuntu installed no?
2011-03-10T03:18:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	 i did NOT use the update manager.... i am on a satellite connection (off grid) and did not want to lose the signal partway through.....  i had 10.04.2 running at the time of the upgrade to 10.10
2011-03-10T03:23:00.000Z	cryptodira	mickster04	i will keep futzing with it.... Thank YOU for your help and time.
2011-03-10T03:24:00.000Z	mickster04	cryptodira	good luck
