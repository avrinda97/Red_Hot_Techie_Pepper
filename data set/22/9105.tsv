2005-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	regeya	drgalaxy	so sue me.
2005-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	drgalaxy	regeya	I can't, my power bill is too high  :)
2005-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	regeya		heh
2005-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	regeya		it's not like newer machines draw any less
2005-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	regeya		;-)
2005-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	drgalaxy	regeya	yes, but with one powerful computer you can do what 10 486's can do
2005-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	drgalaxy		teehee
2005-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	drgalaxy		my next puter is going to be in a briefcase with an LCD hacked inside
2005-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	regeya	drgalaxy	my wife uses the k6-2 to run windows and ms office.  if there were 10 of her, they could all type at 20wpm and still not tax the k6-2.
2005-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	drgalaxy	regeya	yes, but you said 286 :)  k6-2 is what I use for windows development (soon to be gone thanks to QEMU)
2005-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	regeya		I never said 286, drgalaxy.
2005-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	drgalaxy	regeya	oh sorry, I haven't been smoking enough pot
2005-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	regeya		no way
2005-03-06T11:58:00.000Z	regeya	drgalaxy	if you're trying to be insulting, scroll back first, then be insulting. ;-)
2005-03-06T11:58:00.000Z	regeya		I think you're referring to Atrophy, who already said it's going to be a parts machine :-)
2005-03-06T11:58:00.000Z	drgalaxy		they have always charged SO much for Vmware...  now that QEMU and epochs are coming of age I guess they are feeling the pressure
2005-03-06T11:59:00.000Z	regeya		I don't see what the big deal is about the licensing fee for vmware...it's their code, they chose to keep it closed, and there's not a huge market for it.  I mean, other than wonks who want to run multiple OSes at the same time on the same machine for giggles, where's the market?
2005-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	regeya		people developing OSes
2005-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	regeya		and
2005-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	regeya		...
2005-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	drgalaxy	regeya	people like me... I hate windows but sometimes have to test software I write on it
