2008-06-19T21:47:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	  sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg
2008-06-19T21:51:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	did you run the command I gave you earlier?
2008-06-19T21:52:00.000Z	mudit	nickrud	is there some other way ?
2008-06-19T21:52:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	you can run that in a terminal in the gui, or boot into recovery mode and type it there, then type exit
2008-06-19T21:54:00.000Z	mudit	nickrud	how to run hardy in recovery mode ?
2008-06-19T21:55:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	when you boot, you should see something about grub 1.5 starting/loading, hit escape and you will see a menu
2008-06-19T22:00:00.000Z	mudit	nickrud	i am getting error Failed To initialize HAL
2008-06-19T22:00:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	ouch. I've heard of that, but never had to troubleshoot it myself
2008-06-19T22:01:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	try rebooting one more time, possibly they didn't get initialized properly with the xfix boot

2008-06-19T22:10:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	still, on a fresh boot?
2008-06-19T22:11:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	not sure then. I've never had to run down that error before.
2008-06-19T22:18:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	save all the files/directories starting with a period in your home directory, and  see clone below
2008-06-19T22:29:00.000Z	mudit	nickrud	how to save them  >>>> mudit save all the files/directories starting with a period in your home directory, and see clone below
2008-06-19T22:29:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	what I did was hit ctl-h in the file manager (shows them all)
2008-06-19T22:31:00.000Z	mudit	nickrud	i see them all, now what ?
2008-06-19T22:32:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	drag & drop to your backup medium. Then when you do your reinstall, make a separate /home partition so you never have to do this again
2008-06-19T22:35:00.000Z	mudit	nickrud	what i want is to backup my system setting so if i mess up my settings again I could restore them easily
2008-06-19T22:36:00.000Z	nickrud	mudit	that's it. Those dot files are where your personal settings are kept. And I was assuming a new install. Just stick them in a folder somewhere if you're just saving them
