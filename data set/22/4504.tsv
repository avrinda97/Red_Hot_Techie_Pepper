2007-12-21T23:14:00.000Z	shanubuntu		does anyone here know how to downgrade a package or reverse a distupdate?
2007-12-21T23:14:00.000Z	shanubuntu		if that's the right word
2007-12-21T23:15:00.000Z	shanubuntu		hmm, that's unpleasant
2007-12-21T23:15:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	you can *try* downgrading single packages using « sudo apt-get install packagename=version », but it's not guaranteed to succeed
2007-12-21T23:17:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	hmm.  The real issue is that the current kernel version (2.6.22) seems to have broken my sister's laptop's suspend/hibernate function, which is pretty important for a student laptop.  Upgrading to a less stable 2.6.23 would also be conceivable, how workable is that (including a working ndiswrapper + fglrx with it)?
2007-12-21T23:17:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	if it's just the kernel, you don't need to downgrade at all. the old kernel should have remained installed. just go to the GRUB menu and select it, instead of selecting the latest kernel. to make the change persistent, edit the "default" line in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-12-21T23:18:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	I'll test that again, but the last time I tried the older kernel it simply didn't work.  Perhaps I should attempt a reinstallation of it?
2007-12-21T23:18:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	however, Gutsy *always* had 2.6.22 as far as i'm aware
2007-12-21T23:19:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	I upgraded her computer to Gutsy from Feisty to show her how cool linux + free updates are.  Bad idea ;)
2007-12-21T23:20:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	so 2.6.20-16 is still there
2007-12-21T23:20:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	uhm, isn't that the Feisty kernel though? did you upgrade from Feisty?
2007-12-21T23:21:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	but Gutsy (not Feisty) worked *before* the very latest upgrade?
2007-12-21T23:22:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	no... 2.6.22 was the current kernel version present when I updated her computer, so she has 2.6.20-16 from when she had Feisty and 2.6.22-14, the current Gutsy kernel.  Her computer worked fine when I was able to select the older kernel, but for some reason it won't boot off of it now.
2007-12-21T23:24:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	you could try reinstalling version 2.6.22-14.46, which should be the original Gutsy version i think (now it's .47, updated a couple of days ago). i really don't guarantee anything though - and if it then doesn't boot, you *may* be left with no booting kernel.
2007-12-21T23:25:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	no worries, I have a liveCD and am quite used to chrooting ;)
2007-12-21T23:26:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	sudo apt-get install linux-generic=2.6.22-16 didn't work, and I'm guessing it's because there's another level of versioning.  Where do I check for the packages in a repo to get the exact versions available?
2007-12-21T23:26:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	sorry for the newb questions, I guarantee I do google searches before them
2007-12-21T23:28:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic=2.6.22-14.46 (and same with modules etc, do "dpkg -l | grep linux")
2007-12-21T23:28:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	ok, so dpkg -l will list all available versions of packages?
2007-12-21T23:28:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	so that in the future I'll know that 2.6.22-16.46 is the right one, I mean
2007-12-21T23:29:00.000Z	LjL	shanubuntu	no, it will list what you have installed. but note that in linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic, the "2.6.22-14" is NOT a version (well it is, but technically it's just part of the package name), the version is 2.6.22-14.47, and before that it was 2.6.22-14.46, and this latter version should still be installable
2007-12-21T23:33:00.000Z	shanubuntu	LjL	ok, thanks.  All of the 2.6.22 versions have this problem, though, it's an upstream bug.  I've tried to reinstall 2.6.20-16.32 but it's not available :(
