2009-06-29T01:25:00.000Z	newbie002		I need help with the ln command,  after linking the directory doesn't apper correct
2009-06-29T01:26:00.000Z	newbie002		help:  I did a ln -s /var/www/lighttpd/ ~/Documents/local_html/ ;  then ls ~/var/www/lightppd  but found 0 documents
2009-06-29T01:27:00.000Z	newbie002		sorry:  I did a ln -s /var/www/lighttpd/ ~/Documents/local_html/ ;  then ls /var/www/lightppd/  but found 0 documents (local_html is populated)
2009-06-29T01:27:00.000Z	Pici	newbie002	ln -s TARGET LINKNAME, you reversed the arguments.
2009-06-29T01:29:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	but if I ls ~/Documents/local_public  I get a list of my documents
2009-06-29T01:29:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	do I need to remove the link somehow? I didn't see a -r
2009-06-29T01:30:00.000Z	Pici	newbie002	unlink
2009-06-29T01:30:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	ok,, I'll try it
2009-06-29T01:31:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	I get an error cannot unlink ...local_html/ is a directory
2009-06-29T01:31:00.000Z	Pici	newbie002	Then you didn't create the link when you did your command.
2009-06-29T01:33:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	ok, so I redid it as you said, and it sorta worked, when I ls /var/www/lighttpd/  I get 1 directory called local_html/
2009-06-29T01:34:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	I'll play aroudn with it, I must have left off a /
2009-06-29T01:34:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	thanks
2009-06-29T01:38:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	I keep getting a subdirectory of local_html/ that contains myfiles
2009-06-29T01:40:00.000Z	Pici	newbie002	The linkname needs to not exist before you do your command
2009-06-29T01:43:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	should I delete the directory /var/www/lighttpd/ ?
2009-06-29T01:43:00.000Z	Pici	newbie002	Is that where you want the link to be? If so, yes.
2009-06-29T01:46:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	that did it thanks!
2009-06-29T01:46:00.000Z	Pici	newbie002	you're welcome
2009-06-29T01:48:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	my php
2009-06-29T01:48:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	my php's variable SERVER_ROOT needed to not be in a subdirectory, so I figured I could do a link and then switch out multiple php apps that all want to be root
2009-06-29T01:49:00.000Z	newbie002	Pici	I mean my php app need to think it was in the root because of hardcoded stupidity
