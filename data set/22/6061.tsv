2006-12-28T17:41:00.000Z	Genius314		Where do I copy a firefox theme to? Do I copy the .jar file, or unzip it?
2006-12-28T09:14:00.000Z	Genius314		what are the downsides to having an ATI card?
2006-12-28T09:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	The downside is that you will have either no 3D, or else very buggy drivers that freeze your machine.
2006-12-28T09:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	The upside is that your card's manufacturer name will be three letters shorter so it doesn't take you so long to type it out when you're here asking for help on it.
2006-12-28T09:21:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	Then your monitor will not work.
2006-12-28T09:21:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	If it's a modern monitor, it will say "signal out of range".
2006-12-28T09:22:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	If it's not, it will explode.
2006-12-28T09:22:00.000Z	Genius314	arrenlex	Ok, well the monitor still runs, but I can't get my resolution to work
2006-12-28T09:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	a) Have you restarted X? b) Do you get any error messages? c) what does your xorg.conf look like?
2006-12-28T09:23:00.000Z	Genius314	arrenlex	My monitor works (I'm using it right now), but I can't make my resolution as high as it was on windows
2006-12-28T09:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	None of which answers any of the three questions I asked you.
2006-12-28T09:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	Pastebin is a site where you upload text, and then give us the link to the uploaded text so we can read it.
2006-12-28T09:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	It's a way to "paste" stuff to us without flooding the channel.
2006-12-28T09:25:00.000Z	Genius314	arrenlex	Ok.
2006-12-28T09:29:00.000Z	Genius314	arrenlex	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39107/
2006-12-28T09:30:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	a) Have you restarted X since changing this? b) How are you trying to change it?
2006-12-28T09:31:00.000Z	Genius314	arrenlex	I haven't changed it since I last restarted my computer. I followed a tutorial to add "Modeline", but that was all I edited.
2006-12-28T09:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	I'm serious. Look, about the sync values: This is one of the more important parts. If you choose incorrectly you could damage your monitor.
2006-12-28T09:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	From another site:   Be careful not to exceed the specifications of your monitor.  Doing so could damage your hardware.
2006-12-28T09:42:00.000Z	Genius314	arrenlex	ok, well I haven't edited those values - But is it possible that they're wrong?
2006-12-28T09:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	Genius314	Where did you get them?
2006-12-28T09:45:00.000Z	Genius314	arrenlex	The values were already there when I first opened the file.
