2007-03-27T06:53:00.000Z	HP_Administrator		Can anyone assist me?
2007-03-27T06:54:00.000Z	HP_Administrator		I cannot install Ubuntu on my machine, it freezes during startup
2007-03-27T06:54:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	have you checked the disk, to make sure it's a good burn?
2007-03-27T06:55:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	and a good download?
2007-03-27T06:56:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	what ubuntu disk?
2007-03-27T06:57:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	alternate, server or desktop install?
2007-03-27T06:57:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	where does it freeze?
2007-03-27T06:58:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	sorry for all the questions, just trying to get an idea of your environment.
2007-03-27T06:58:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	what type of computer? specs, please.
2007-03-27T06:59:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	just a sec
2007-03-27T06:59:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	 pm me, and i'll get to it in a sec
2007-03-27T07:02:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	back
2007-03-27T07:02:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	sorry, had to talk with the wife. :)
2007-03-27T07:03:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	so, anyway
2007-03-27T07:03:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	is it a specific model computer (dell, hp) or custom built?
2007-03-27T07:04:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	what model? reason i ask, is you might have to pass a kernel option at boot
2007-03-27T07:05:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	doing a google search for that model comp and ubuntu on it...
2007-03-27T07:06:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	not getting any solid results. i have one guess, though:
2007-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	when booting, pass 'linux nolapic' and see what you get
2007-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	see if it still freezes
2007-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	possible. maybe download the server install, then if it installs 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop'
2007-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	atoponce	HP_Administrator	that will get you the ubuntu gui
