2005-03-13T17:46:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	desktop. an old athlon 900 based machine
2005-03-13T17:47:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	do you have new features? which one?
2005-03-13T17:48:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	I am fairly new to linux. About 2 weeks now. If you tell me how to get info i will look
2005-03-13T17:48:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	all hardware has been detected at install?
2005-03-13T17:49:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	yep including old tv card which i am trying to install drivers for. Only i dont know the file structure weell enough!
2005-03-13T17:50:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	the only thing i needed to do was install Nvidia drivers
2005-04-01T16:36:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	how did you install skype?
2005-04-01T16:37:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	using apt-get?
2005-04-01T16:38:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	downloaded the deb from skype, and intalled dkpg from that... i think? it was some time ago and I am quite new to all this Linux stuff. Tooo much info pushing the old stuff out!
2005-04-01T16:40:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	dunno if dpkq -i newpack will overwright oldone. well, try and see what you get.
2005-04-01T16:41:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	do i need to download the new deb? Is there a way i can get synaptic to take care of it?
2005-04-01T16:42:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	synaptic will take kare only for staff from repos (sources.list)
2005-04-01T16:42:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	you are running warty or hoary?
2005-04-01T16:43:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	hoary
2005-04-01T16:44:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	maybe skype is in hoary universe. try apt-cache search skype ( be sure universe is enabled )
2005-04-01T16:46:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	it comes up with the skype slogan. In Synaptic, the version appears to be older than the one on Skype.com
2005-04-01T16:47:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	well, version on skype.com will always be the last one :-)
2005-04-01T16:48:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	Skype is free as voip. if you choose to pay for the other stuff thats up to you!
2005-04-01T16:49:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	skype client is free, but not the protocal
2005-04-01T16:51:00.000Z	selinium_	fgx	mrj: I see... anyway, the best way forward to get the new one on my machine is to dowload the deb and 'dpkq -i newpack' ?
2005-04-01T16:51:00.000Z	fgx	selinium_	yes
