2011-04-27T02:20:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	Did you flip the wireless switch or press the enable/disable button on your computer?
2011-04-27T02:21:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	It gets the firmware during setup, but not during regular boot.
2011-04-27T02:24:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	What does it say in the menu?
2011-04-27T02:24:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	menu? You mean setup screen?
2011-04-27T02:25:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	I was referring to the wireless icon menu.
2011-04-27T02:25:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	"Wireless is disabled"
2011-04-27T02:26:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	And "Enable Wireless" is checked?
2011-04-27T02:26:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	where exactly is this a checkable option?
2011-04-27T02:27:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	Click on the icon, it should be near "Enable Networking" if your wireless driver is running.
2011-04-27T02:28:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	yes that is already checked
2011-04-27T02:32:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	That will load the "wl" driver. That's actually what I am using at this moment.
2011-04-27T02:33:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	That means you lack the driver... Do you have a folder in /usr/src that starts with "bcmwl"?
2011-04-27T02:34:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	nope only linux-headers-2.6.35-2X folders
2011-04-27T02:35:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	by any chance do you know the name of this package?
2011-04-27T02:35:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	I had to look it up. It's "bcmwl-kernel-source"
2011-04-27T02:37:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	now what after it finishes the command?
2011-04-27T02:37:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	After the package is installed, go into the folder it creates, which starts with "bcmwl".
2011-04-27T02:38:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	ok, there now
2011-04-27T02:38:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	After that, "sudo make".
2011-04-27T02:39:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	I got a fatal error :o about missing a file "linux/autoconf.h"
2011-04-27T02:41:00.000Z	J697	aroni125	hello?
2011-04-27T02:41:00.000Z	aroni125	J697	I'm not sure how to get past the autoconf.h problem. It's something I didn't encounter.
