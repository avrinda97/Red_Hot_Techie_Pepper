2006-04-10T06:32:00.000Z	hanasaki		sometimes i wish i could aptget from etch to ubuntu
2006-04-10T06:33:00.000Z	hanasaki		not trying to starta  war.. just looking for facts... someone told me that ubuntu has far less packages than debian and debian is far more stable... waht are the facts? where can i read/research?
2006-04-10T06:34:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	neither is really true...
2006-04-10T06:34:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	most people aren't even using debian "stable" cause it's very out of date
2006-04-10T06:37:00.000Z	hanasaki	polpak	 Seveas so what are the good reasons to use ubun over deb and visa versa?
2006-04-10T06:38:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	I prefer ubuntu because it's designed specifically for desktop use, meaning most things I want to have work out of the box, and it's got very up to date packages which allow me all the features I need
2006-04-10T06:39:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	the next version of ubuntu was delayed because they're planning to provide commercial support for 3 years and want to give it all the finishing touches they can
2006-04-10T06:40:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	I'm not even sure what that means...
2006-04-10T06:42:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	?? nvidia is pretty well supported
2006-04-10T06:42:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	what issues?
2006-04-10T06:42:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	yes
2006-04-10T06:47:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	nope
2006-04-10T06:47:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	just apt-get the packages
2006-04-10T06:48:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	the package installs it
2006-04-10T06:49:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	why make your own? (just curious)
2006-04-10T06:49:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	I think the additional modules are also available packaged..
2006-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	polpak	hanasaki	pretty much
