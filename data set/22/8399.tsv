2005-08-28T07:44:00.000Z	snorks		what's the difference between debian w/ gnome, and ubuntu?
2005-08-28T07:44:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	ubuntu has a selection of programs it chooses to support more than others,   and it's generally very reasonably up to date,  and it has regular release cycles, ...
2005-08-28T07:45:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	but with a normal debian install i would be forced to set up kernel somewhat more thorough than ubuntu install?
2005-08-28T07:46:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	  i've not done the ubuntu install, so i dunno
2005-08-28T07:46:00.000Z	snorks		;[
2005-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	you use debian?
2005-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	no i use ubuntu :)
2005-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	on this machine anyways
2005-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	but you never installed it?
2005-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	no :),  i did a very questionable debian-to-ubuntu transition :)
2005-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	ok :)
2005-08-28T07:49:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	was it hard?
2005-08-28T07:50:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	another thing, does debian use different repositories?
2005-08-28T07:50:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	no it wasn't
2005-08-28T07:50:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	and more?
2005-08-28T07:50:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	and yes it does
2005-08-28T07:50:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	the no it wasn't was to "was it hard"
2005-08-28T07:50:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	ubuntu has their own repositories yes
2005-08-28T07:51:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	I figured :) ubuntu has less packages in their repos than debian aswell?
2005-08-28T07:51:00.000Z	snorks	nerdy2	gotta run - dinner. ncie talking to you
2005-08-28T07:51:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	although they are debian based,   they differ     (e.g. ubuntu had an x.org X server a lot earlier than debian sid did)
2005-08-28T07:51:00.000Z	nerdy2	snorks	not less if you enable all of them
