2006-06-25T16:11:00.000Z	Poromenos		hello
2006-06-25T16:12:00.000Z	Poromenos		i have a USB DSL modem and I want to set up ubuntu LAMP server, how can I have it dial up?
2006-06-25T16:12:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	i.e. how to get your modem to work ?
2006-06-25T16:12:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	yes :)
2006-06-25T16:13:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	Judging from the OTEnet IP, you probably have an accessrunner, right ? 'lsusb' will tell you ...
2006-06-25T16:13:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	no, i got a ZyXEL, erm, something :/
2006-06-25T16:13:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	speedtouch actually, alcatel speedtouch
2006-06-25T16:14:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	Try 'lsusb'. You will see your modem there. I haven't heard of any ZyXEL chipsets...
2006-06-25T16:14:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	and how do i get it to dial up on startup?
2006-06-25T16:15:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	Please use www.pastebin.com. Paste the output of 'lsusb', and then I might be able to help you :)
2006-06-25T16:15:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	ah, the pc is 1000 km away and linux isn't even installed :P
2006-06-25T16:15:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	Hm... Can you remember what model it was ?
2006-06-25T16:17:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	ZYXEL PRESTIGE 660R-61C
2006-06-25T16:19:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	or rather, 630-C
2006-06-25T16:19:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	http://www.zyxel.com/web/product_family_detail.php?PC1indexflag=20040812093058&CategoryGroupNo=1B20CD84-C882-4A4B-BA73-93C80224626B
2006-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	Thanks. The 630-C clarification was neccessary. It's an Accessrunner probably - you can only be sure with 'lsusb'. This might be of some use https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/AccessRunner
2006-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	I haven't found the time to complete the wiki page, but I'll do so ASAP. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to e-mail me , ok :) ?
2006-06-25T16:22:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	will do, i'll go read the page now, efxaristo :)
2006-08-11T06:31:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	 nv is the open source driver AFAIK, nvidia is nvidia's binary blob
2006-08-11T06:32:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	Follow that guide. It worked for me ...
2006-08-11T06:33:00.000Z	Poromenos	neutrinomass	i've done that :/
2006-08-11T06:39:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Poromenos	Currently XGL is not recommended and many devs advise against it as it has broken systems ...
