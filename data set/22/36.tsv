2012-10-18T20:59:00.000Z	NoBlueTooth		is it worth reinstall bluez?
2012-10-18T21:00:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	have you tried installing some of the bluetooth firmware?
2012-10-18T21:00:00.000Z	NoBlueTooth		I'll be honest I did apt-get install blue* when things wasn't working i have all the blues packages
2012-10-18T21:02:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	but I think you might need some of the firmware-* packages.
2012-10-18T21:02:00.000Z	NoBlueTooth	huggy-bear	do you know which ones i'll need?
2012-10-18T21:02:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	what is the device in question?

2012-10-18T21:05:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	about your belkin thingie: I just googled a forum post where someone said it didn't work in 2009
2012-10-18T21:06:00.000Z	NoBlueTooth		did they say it didn't work with a fix? or ..
2012-10-18T21:09:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	apparently there are no drivers for it :(
2012-10-18T21:09:00.000Z	NoBlueTooth		its weird how the device pairs though
2012-10-18T21:09:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	but it's old news. as for your headset, can't find any info on it. but you can read this, maybe it will help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothHeadset

2012-10-18T21:13:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	how does it fail to start the modules? can you give me the error?
2012-10-18T21:13:00.000Z	NoBlueTooth		Failure: Module initalisation failed
2012-10-18T21:14:00.000Z	NoBlueTooth		it happened when trying to run "pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=btheadset
2012-10-18T21:15:00.000Z	huggy-bear	NoBlueTooth	could be that you are missing that module. not sure
