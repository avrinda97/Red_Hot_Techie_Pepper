2011-01-21T06:11:00.000Z	qbb		hi. what's the preferred way of manually stopping and starting squid on ubuntu? the init script mentioned in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Squid doesn't exist
2011-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	try « sudo service squid START|STOP|RESTART »
2011-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	unrecognized service
2011-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	how did you install squid?
2011-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	synaptic, took the default squid package and accepted to install the dependencies
2011-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	what ubuntu version?
2011-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	10.10
2011-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	do you have /etc/init/squid.conf?
2011-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	yes, and squid itself works fine too
2011-01-21T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	try "squid3" instead of "squid" in my previous command
2011-01-21T06:14:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	same error
2011-01-21T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	can you pastebin /etc/init/squid.conf ?
2011-01-21T06:19:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	http://pastebin.com/9SWDHWGQ without the comments. it's the default squid.conf, haven't modified it at all yet
2011-01-21T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	nah, I meant /etc/init/squid, but one sec while I check something
2011-01-21T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	nah, I meant /etc/init/squid.conf (oops), but one sec while I check something
2011-01-21T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	do you know of the "squid3" package's relationship to the "squid" package?
2011-01-21T06:24:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	not really, but I reckon it's some sort of unstable version, if squid 2 is still the default squid package?
2011-01-21T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	I see. I'm inclined to say that the missing file in /etc/init.d is a bug (if you see things like gdm, they have the upstart script and then a compatibility script in /etc/init.d)
2011-01-21T06:26:00.000Z	qbb	jrib	yea, the others do. what are the files in /etc/init for? they're all .conf files but look more like init scripts to me
2011-01-21T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	they're used by upstart (replaced sysv init)
2011-01-21T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	does « start squid » work?
2011-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	qbb	and « stop squid » of course too :)  I think these should work for pure upstart jobs
