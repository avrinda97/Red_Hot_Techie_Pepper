2008-11-13T15:47:00.000Z	vinny	ActionParsnip	ln -s aMSN v4l?
2008-11-13T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	its gonna be something like sudo ln -s /dev/vl /del/<whatever amsn uses>
2008-11-13T15:59:00.000Z	vinny	ActionParsnip	I still don't get what you mean
2008-11-13T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	about what?
2008-11-13T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	ok i'll do this slow
2008-11-13T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	everything in your system is represented as a folder in /dev
2008-11-13T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	some programs expect certain device names for hardware but this is not always the case
2008-11-13T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	so if you know the one it is, you can create a symbolic link to essentially make a copy of the dev
2008-11-13T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	the system sees it as identical, you can create symlinks to files or folders, its transparent to the system
2008-11-13T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	so (example) if a webcam is represented by /dev/webcam but gyache expects it on /dev/goats you can run sudo ln -s /dev/webcam /dev/goats and it will then work
2008-11-13T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	dont symlink /dev thats gonna cause hell
2008-11-13T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	you make the symlink inside /dev/
2008-11-13T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	no idea, its jus a file, the kernel will handle any resource squabbles
2008-11-13T16:04:00.000Z	vinny	ActionParsnip	so then I'll have to rename video0 to video and make ln -s video0 video + 4vl or something
2008-11-13T16:05:00.000Z	vinny	ActionParsnip	don't leave me now!
2008-11-13T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	no,
2008-11-13T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	if a program expects a name that is different from what it expects yuoo make a symlink
2008-11-13T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	thats all there is to it
2008-11-13T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	?
2008-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	if its a symlink, its exactly the same thing just with 2 names
2008-11-13T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	i cant see how i can be any clearer
2008-11-13T16:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vinny	check pm
