2006-06-04T07:56:00.000Z	firecraft		hello people.
2006-06-04T07:58:00.000Z	firecraft		i just got the ubuntu cds delivered but having a major issue w/ all of the 5 PC cds.. those are compatible w/ x86 PC Intel however when i reboot to live cds none of those work, also when i go to my rom drive properties i see 0 bytes used & 0 bytes free which is quite a conflicting message.
2006-06-04T07:59:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	How many computers have you tested it on ?
2006-06-04T08:00:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	just one so far but the rom works fine w/ all the other cds/dvds
2006-06-04T08:00:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	What do you mean all the other ones ? You mean the ubuntu dvd ?
2006-06-04T08:00:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	cd's from breezy do they work ?
2006-06-04T08:01:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	i meant all the other cds like xp pro and rest of the software in collection.
2006-06-04T08:01:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	breezy ?
2006-06-04T08:02:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	The previous ubuntu release
2006-06-04T08:03:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	this is my first try at ubuntu v5.10 for PCs.. i was quite enthusiastic to try them out but slightly disappointed since they are not working as i expected.
2006-06-04T08:03:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	The latest version is 6.06
2006-06-04T08:04:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	Is it the live cd or the install cd you can't get to work (presuming you are using 5.10)
2006-06-04T08:04:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	correct.. but the 5.10 should work too, right? i mean i can upgrade later but i don't want these delivered cds go to waste.
2006-06-04T08:05:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	i got 5 PC cds.. each pack has 1 install cd and 1 live cd.. i tried all 5 packs, none of them is working.
2006-06-04T08:05:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	Depends on what hardware the newer the hardware the less likely 5.10 will work well with it (is it a laptop you are using)
2006-06-04T08:06:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	it's a desktop PC i'm on trying to test ubuntu .. right now i got xp pro w/ sp2 installed on it w/ NFTS mount.
2006-06-04T08:06:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	Can the install cd boot ?
2006-06-04T08:06:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	(just to get to the text installer screen)
2006-06-04T08:08:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	i tried rebooting all 5 live cds that i got delivered, i notice the rom starts spinning, and trying to read the disk and with a prompt Boot from CD .. i did hit enter several times but it logged me in to xp instead w/o initiating ubuntu interface/process, also when i go to the rom drive property the cd seems empty.
2006-06-04T08:08:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	Try the 6.06 desktop cd (I recommend you just order some each time there is a release)
2006-06-04T08:10:00.000Z	firecraft	h3sp4wn	i can do that, but it's confusing me why is it that says 0 bytes used & 0 bytes free.. that doesn't make sense to me. besides getting the newer release 5.10 should have worked if not like v6x
2006-06-04T08:16:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	firecraft	I don't use windows so I can't really tell you why that might be
