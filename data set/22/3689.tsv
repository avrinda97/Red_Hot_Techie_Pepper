2009-03-04T02:11:00.000Z	Caesi		hi all, anyone have any idea why scrolling down in Firefox is lagging? thanks
2009-03-04T02:11:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	firefox does that alot
2009-03-04T02:12:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	did you install any new plugins for it?
2009-03-04T02:12:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	i use opera
2009-03-04T02:14:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	not explicitely :) I used Opera too, but I think it doesn't show the fonts well enough; sebsebseb: true :) but Firefox is okay - apart from this (!) glitsj16 hmm Stylish?
2009-03-04T02:14:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	the fonts in opera can be changed
2009-03-04T02:15:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	I know I've done that.. but the menu fonts and all.. I find them too blurry etc.
2009-03-04T02:15:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	what i do is change the system font in Appereance Menu
2009-03-04T02:16:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	i use comic sans as my fonts
2009-03-04T02:17:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	I've done so too, but they're still not as good as in FF, at least on mine(?); sebsebseb: ta, I might check them out now; glitsj16: ahh thanks, I'm not really familiar with CSS, but I might also try and get into that.. thanks all!
2009-03-04T02:18:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	ah, that might explain it :)
2009-03-04T02:18:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	changing your system font will change that in opera
2009-03-04T02:19:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	like I said, I've done that.. but they're still not as clear as in Mozilla
2009-03-04T02:20:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	and I have all this subpixel smoothing enabled and all
2009-03-04T02:20:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	if you try opera, smooth scrolling can be changed, in opera
2009-03-04T02:21:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	i just got rid of XP for good,lol
2009-03-04T02:21:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	jap, I have it activated.. you're right Opera is better, I also use it on Windows.. but I find the font really annoying somehow :)
2009-03-04T02:22:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	i agree
2009-03-04T02:22:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	I can't unfortunately :/
2009-03-04T02:22:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	i understand that
2009-03-04T02:22:00.000Z	Caesi	thiebaude	but thanks for your help though :)
2009-03-04T02:23:00.000Z	thiebaude	Caesi	yw
