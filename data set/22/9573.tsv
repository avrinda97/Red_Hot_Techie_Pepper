2009-08-29T10:16:00.000Z	Dan48p		oh
2009-08-29T10:16:00.000Z	Dan48p		i just clicked on stuff until i ended up here
2009-08-29T10:16:00.000Z	Dan48p		i see
2009-08-29T10:18:00.000Z	Dan48p		so are the different versions of linux pretty much the same functionally?  i tried kubuntu mainly because we have the kde on the machines at school... i like the look a little better than ubuntu but i can't find stuff as quick now
2009-08-29T10:18:00.000Z	Dan48p		i guess what i'm asking is if i use ubuntu or kubuntu will everything transfer between them correctly
2009-08-29T10:19:00.000Z	Dan48p		i'm mainly using kate to program in c, then your standard internet and open office stuff
2009-08-29T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	   kubuntu is ubuntu + KDE.. ubuntu = GNOME
2009-08-29T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 you can install whateer apps you like on both.,,
2009-08-29T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 the 2 are just different desktops. the underlaying stuff is still the same.
2009-08-29T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 gnome is themable --- check your users settings
2009-08-29T10:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 you want a Hot Pink theme or somthing? :)
2009-08-29T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 explore your system/settings menus :)
2009-08-29T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 you can set up ubuntu on a bootable flash drive for netbooks :) it works quite well
2009-08-29T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 then use the usb-flash to install ifyou want.
2009-08-29T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 of course.
2009-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 or test out Uubntu along side windows with virtualbox.
2009-08-29T10:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 i normally have (windows)(linux)(home)(swap)
2009-08-29T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dan48p	 yes.
