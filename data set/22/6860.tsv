2006-07-12T16:32:00.000Z	Some_Person		I just got my ShipIt cds for Ubuntu 6.06
2006-07-12T16:32:00.000Z	Some_Person		Can I use them to upgrade my current install of 5.10?
2006-07-12T16:33:00.000Z	Some_Person		How?
2006-07-12T16:34:00.000Z	Some_Person		crap

2006-07-12T16:34:00.000Z	Some_Person		and 6.06 actually supports my soundcard
2006-07-12T16:35:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	You're out of luck. Your only option with the Desktop CD is to install from scratch.
2006-07-12T16:36:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	692 MB
2006-07-12T16:37:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
2006-07-12T16:37:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	Maybe you can find someone in your area with a CD. Do you have a Linux Users Group?
2006-07-12T16:39:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	It is very likely that your city has a LUG. Where do you live, if you don't mind me asking?
2006-07-12T16:41:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	Someone at the Houston LUG might be kind enough to mail a CD. Look at www.hlug.org
2006-07-12T16:43:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	I don't think any of us have a say in that :-) We're just users, like you.
2006-07-12T16:46:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	Even if you had an alternate CD, you'd still need to redownload any extra packages you might have installed. That would still take a lot of time
2006-07-12T07:44:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	Boot from the Windows CD, go to recovery console and run fixmbr
2006-07-12T08:22:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	You can backup the MBR and restore it later
2006-07-12T08:24:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	Do you have a writable Windows partition (i.e. FAT32 instead of NTFS)?
2006-07-12T08:25:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	You can use dd to backup the first 446 bytes of the MBR and restore them after you install Ubuntu.
2006-07-12T08:27:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	That's alright. As long as you can get to the Recovery Console
2006-07-12T08:28:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	are you sure that's a Windows XP CD? Earlier version used a different bootloader.
2006-07-12T08:31:00.000Z	roshan_s	Some_Person	Your best solution is to educate your Dad about Linux :-)
