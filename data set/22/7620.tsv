2007-01-15T13:24:00.000Z	gaspipe1		>idleone o'm on step 6 (6. Type "setup (hd0,3)". This is key. Other instructions say to use "(hd0)", and that's fine if you want to write GRUB to the MBR. If you want to write it to your linux root partition, then you want the number after the comma, such as "(hd0,3)".)

2007-01-15T13:27:00.000Z	mnoir	gaspipe1	your issue is that you cannot choose grub choices?
2007-01-15T13:28:00.000Z	mnoir	gaspipe1	and you want what?
2007-01-15T13:31:00.000Z	mnoir	gaspipe1	as far as I know hd1,1 would be 2nd hd, 2nd partition
2007-01-15T13:31:00.000Z	mnoir	gaspipe1	sorry - i have not been watching and i fear i missed some messages
2007-01-15T13:32:00.000Z	mnoir	gaspipe1	issue is that if you do not write to mbr, how are ya gonna choose the grub loader - ms doesnt give you the option
