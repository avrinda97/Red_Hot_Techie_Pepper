2008-02-25T12:01:00.000Z	Knarff		Hi. I have this issue. Some months ago I had a working installation of Windows XP installed in a partition and other NTFS partition for my files (as you need to reinstall Windows constantly). I wanted to have a dual boot system with Ubuntu, so I installed Ubuntu and said yes when it told me to write the GRUB to disk as it had detected Microsoft Windows.
2008-02-25T12:02:00.000Z	Knarff		Ubuntu worked well, but when I tried to boot into Windows, it gave me a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death). Somehow, Windows didn't like GRUB. Ever since I've been stuck with Ubuntu (that's a good thing because I love it), but I still want to have a dual boot system. Now, I have tried reinstalling windows, but the Windows Installer does not detect any partitions and if I proceed it would delete all my partitions.
2008-02-25T12:02:00.000Z	Knarff		Note: I can see both my two Windows partitions from Ubuntu. It's only the Windows installer that does not detect the partition. What can I do to achieve a dual boot system? How can I make the Windows installer see my partitions?
2008-02-25T12:04:00.000Z	Knarff		bazahang, Yes, I'm running Ubuntu Gutsy
2008-02-25T12:04:00.000Z	Knarff		The thing is that from the first time, Windows gave a blue screen of death
2008-02-25T12:06:00.000Z	Knarff		My question is how can I make the Windows Installer see my partitions (both NTFS and ext3)
2008-02-25T12:07:00.000Z	Knarff		Yes, but that works when you are IN windows already
2008-02-25T12:07:00.000Z	Knarff		not if you want to install Windows
2008-02-25T12:08:00.000Z	Knarff		How do I repair the GRUB?
2008-02-25T12:08:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	you need to allocate spare space for windows before you begin the installation. free up space with gparted.
2008-02-25T12:14:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	then your problem is not related to ubuntu at all. ask for help in #windows
2008-02-25T12:15:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	then windows doesn't play well with linux. complain in #windows
2008-02-25T12:16:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	windows refuses to recognize ext partitions.
2008-02-25T12:17:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	you're asking for windows help in a linux help channel. don't you understand you're never going to get the answer to your problem? you're looking in the wrong place.
2008-02-25T12:19:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	because linux developers are smart and wrote NTFS drivers for linux. windows refuses to write ext drivers for windows. MOVE ON.
2008-02-25T12:19:00.000Z	Knarff	Nubbie	I will MOVE ON, once I can get a dual boot
2008-02-25T12:20:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	you have ubuntu and grub functioning correctly. your problem is that windows is messed up. get out of this channel unless you have a problem with linux.
2008-02-25T12:21:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	please understand, if grub will get you into windows (even if it's a BSOD), that means it's functioning correctly. if you have BSOD problems, ask for help in #windows.
2008-02-25T12:22:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	sorry if i was short with you.
2008-02-25T12:22:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	but the solution to your problem is not in this channel.
2008-02-25T12:22:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	that would be illegal most likely.
2008-02-25T12:23:00.000Z	Nubbie	Knarff	everywhere.
