2007-11-19T09:13:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	hang on I actually can tell you how to modify azureus
2007-11-19T09:13:00.000Z	drizzt69	jpastore	ok
2007-11-19T09:14:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	click the tools menu, select option
2007-11-19T09:14:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	the first tab connections is what you need
2007-11-19T09:15:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	set one computer to operate on port 8000 and another on port 8001 you can use the same port number for both udp and tcp traffic...
2007-11-19T09:15:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	what router do you have?
2007-11-19T09:15:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	a linksys?
2007-11-19T09:17:00.000Z	drizzt69	jpastore	its a 2wire for dsl
2007-11-19T09:18:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	not familar with that brand....if ti was linksys, dlink or netgear I could have walked you through it =) try this: open a terminal and type "route -n" you should have 1 entry that has a an ip otehr than 0.0.0.0 ... probably 192.168.1.1 ...put that address into a browser...
2007-11-19T09:18:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	likely you'll need a username and password...if it was never set try admin / admin
2007-11-19T09:19:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	once in your looking for a port forward section could also be labeled as NAT or REverse NAT or on linksys "applications and gaming"
2007-11-19T09:20:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	from there you'll say forward port 8000 to port 8000 on your internal ip assigned to your computer
2007-11-19T09:20:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	I'm jsut going ot warn you...if you have more than 1 computer running bit torrent...you're not going to be doing much else with your bandwidth =)
2007-11-19T09:21:00.000Z	drizzt69	jpastore	well last time when i had windows we had 3 comps running torrents at about 200mb each with 4 downloading on each comp
2007-11-19T09:22:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	what type of connection you have a 6mbs cable?
2007-11-19T09:23:00.000Z	drizzt69	jpastore	well i think its 8  or 10 actually but i always get a little more
2007-11-19T09:23:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	depending on what I'm downloading I've hit over 500k ... you can control it with limits in the options so no one goes over 150 or so you have some bandwidth free
2007-11-19T09:23:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	nice =) then let it rip =)
2007-11-19T09:24:00.000Z	drizzt69	jpastore	try port 6991 its usually dedicated to vidio chat lol so it has more allowed
2007-11-19T09:26:00.000Z	jpastore	drizzt69	I have only a 6mbs pipe here and the price to up is retarded...waiting on FIOS =) might be a long wait though =)
2007-11-19T09:47:00.000Z	drizzt69	jpastore	i still get nat errors i can't figure out what you mean by port forwarding
2007-11-19T09:49:00.000Z	drizzt69	jpastore	still can't figure it out i got in my router settings but don't know what to do
