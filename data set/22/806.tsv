2011-03-09T09:01:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	in .bashrc in your home directory you can add an alias;  "alias rm='rm -i'
2011-03-09T09:03:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	if you put it in the .bashrc file you have to run the source .bashrc command.
2011-03-09T09:09:00.000Z	pdf_dude	Kalmic	what do you use?
2011-03-09T09:10:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	vim.
2011-03-09T09:11:00.000Z	pdf_dude	Kalmic	I meant which variable you use
2011-03-09T09:11:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	Ah, in .bashrc : export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
2011-03-09T09:12:00.000Z	pdf_dude	Kalmic	what if the shell in is french or something and I want to set it to english?
2011-03-09T09:13:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	That one, I have no clue :(
2011-03-09T09:15:00.000Z	pdf_dude	Kalmic	tks :) learned some stuff with u
2011-03-09T09:15:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	No problem; I'm actually surprised I could answer those.
2011-03-09T09:16:00.000Z	pdf_dude	Kalmic	if i want that to every user I edit /etc/bash.bashrc right?
2011-03-09T09:16:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	I'm actualy not sure what takes precidence in that case. However that seems like it should work.
2011-03-09T09:17:00.000Z	pdf_dude	Kalmic	shell language is in french how can I change it
2011-03-09T09:18:00.000Z	pdf_dude	Kalmic	nano is in french!
2011-03-09T09:18:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	Quick google found:http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/red-hat-31/change-language-450869/#post2274163 I don't know what string you should use to change to anything but english.
2011-03-09T09:19:00.000Z	Kalmic	pdf_dude	You should be able to put that export into .bashrc (or maybe .bash_profile I always forget).
