2007-04-20T12:27:00.000Z	ExpositionOFEvil		why does the image always have errors!
2007-04-20T12:28:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Was the md5sum of the image correct?
2007-04-20T12:28:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	What about the md5sum of the cd after burning. Did you try that?
2007-04-20T12:29:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	I think its: md5sum /dev/cdrom
2007-04-20T12:29:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Lemme make sure
2007-04-20T12:34:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Yeah, I just tested it on my CD. Make sure the disc is in the drive and do: md5sum /dev/cdrom and check it against the md5sum file.
2007-04-20T12:35:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	CD in the drive?
2007-04-20T12:35:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Have more than one cdrom drive?
2007-04-20T12:37:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	You may need to use a different dev name then. Possiblly /dev/cdrom0 or /dev/cdrom1. Do either of those work?
2007-04-20T12:41:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Has to check the whole disc...might take a few mins.
2007-04-20T12:44:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	It's a good burn, then. Must be some other problem.
2007-04-20T12:45:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	If it read the md5sum correctly it shouldn't have trouble just loading the files to install.
2007-04-20T12:46:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Odd, since the md5sum says its fine. You could try installing with a different cdrom.
2007-04-20T12:48:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Lemme check mine and see if it says the same thing.
2007-04-20T12:49:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	So you say the corrupt file warning and didn't try installing it, is that what happened?
2007-04-20T12:50:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	While I'm doing this, try the check again on another cdrom if you can.
2007-04-20T12:50:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Another cdrom drive I mean.
2007-04-20T12:52:00.000Z	ExpositionOFEvil	ajax4	il be right back
2007-04-20T12:55:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Yes?
2007-04-20T12:56:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Yes, no errors found on mine.
2007-04-20T12:57:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	I guess its some kind of obscure read error. See if you get it again with a different cdrom drive.
2007-04-20T13:00:00.000Z	ajax4	ExpositionOFEvil	Usually DELETE key.
