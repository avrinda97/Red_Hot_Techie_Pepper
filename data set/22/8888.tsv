2006-08-13T16:17:00.000Z	foo		Is there anyway I could show the filesystem types on different partitions?
2006-08-13T05:00:00.000Z	foo		Having some problems. fsck reports 150k files on my drive, but when I try to mount it... mount can't find the fs on the drive. Any ideas?
2006-08-13T05:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	What command are you using to mount it and what is the error message?
2006-08-13T05:02:00.000Z	foo	Amaranth	mount /dev/hdd1 /public .. error: VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev hdd1
2006-08-13T05:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	ouch
2006-08-13T05:03:00.000Z	foo	Amaranth	I just installed ubuntu... it said it never reformatted this drive. I have no idea why it would do this. fsck shows 150k files ... so how does it read those ?
2006-08-13T05:04:00.000Z	foo	Amaranth	Any ideas?
2006-08-13T05:06:00.000Z	foo	Amaranth	hm, I'll take that as a no :) Thanks anyways.
2006-08-13T05:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	Nope, sounds like a broken partition
2006-08-13T05:06:00.000Z	foo	Amaranth	how could fsck read the files? is there anyway to have fsck relabel it ext3?
2006-08-13T05:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	I don't know, sorry.
2006-10-26T10:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	servers are overloaded
2006-10-26T10:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	Google has tens of thousands of server spread across the world with a massive amount of bandwidth
2006-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	we have a couple servers running the main archive and a bunch of volunteer mirrors
2006-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	try switching to another mirror
2006-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	foo	Amaranth	ok, where is a mirror list?
2006-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	what country are you in?

2006-10-26T10:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	wait, it's failing on the security ones?
2006-10-26T10:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	there are no mirrors for those
2006-10-26T10:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	foo	otherwise, check out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
