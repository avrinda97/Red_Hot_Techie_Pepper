2010-02-16T17:10:00.000Z	rwwilco		so any ideas, anyone know what program is used to setup the xorg configuration if i had just installed the ubuntu-desktop task or whatnot?
2010-02-16T17:11:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	why do you assume such a thing exists?  It doesn't afaik
2010-02-16T17:12:00.000Z	rwwilco	jrib	so when ubuntu is installed it just drops the user on the command line?  i expected that when not installing X, but i assume when X is installed it will be configured
2010-02-16T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	no, it doesn't just drop you in the command line.  gdm starts by default.  Is that your question?
2010-02-16T17:14:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	no, what window manager will you be using?
2010-02-16T17:14:00.000Z	rwwilco	jrib	basically blackbox and a web browser, thats about all i'm looking for
2010-02-16T17:14:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	install blackbox and xorg then
2010-02-16T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	and gdm/kdm/xdm/whatever if you want to get X starting by default
2010-02-16T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	xorg needs no configuration
2010-02-16T17:16:00.000Z	rwwilco	jrib	hmm, because with no configuration it just pulls up a black scren, and i alt-f1 to get back to console
2010-02-16T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	how are you running it?
2010-02-16T17:16:00.000Z	rwwilco	jrib	thank you btw, getting somewhere usefull now i think :)
2010-02-16T17:16:00.000Z	rwwilco	jrib	startx
2010-02-16T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-02-16T17:17:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	wait.  You setup a window manager right?
2010-02-16T17:18:00.000Z	rwwilco	jrib	in ~/.xsession i have the blackbox command
2010-02-16T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	right, so when you say "black screen" you are sure X is not running?
2010-02-16T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	check /var/log/Xorg.0.log though you should copy your .xsession to .xinitrc just to be sure
2010-02-16T17:21:00.000Z	rwwilco	jrib	switching to .xinitrc solved it,  i wonder is xsession an outdated filename from XF86 then?  xorg uses new convention . . . either way doesn't really matter glad it works now :)
2010-02-16T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	.xsession gets used by session managers like gdm,kdm,xdm :)
2010-02-16T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	personally, I just link them so they are the same file...
2010-02-16T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	rwwilco	Anyway, if you install gdm/kdm/xdm you don't even need one since the blackblox package provides a system-wide one
