2006-01-10T16:12:00.000Z	techone		ok so my firefox just disappeared off the screen
2006-01-10T16:13:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	it probably fell on the ground
2006-01-10T11:49:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	neither
2006-01-10T11:50:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	just make sure your locale is correct (play around with system -> admin -> language selector)
2006-01-10T11:51:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	if it does not work: put the output of locale -a and locale on the pastebin
2006-01-10T11:58:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	did you get to see my pastebin ?  http://pastebin.ca/35876
2006-01-10T12:14:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	did you get to see my pastebin ?  http://pastebin.ca/35876
2006-01-10T12:15:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
2006-01-10T12:15:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	and make sure en_CA.UTF-8 is selected
2006-01-10T12:16:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	im concerned that this is an indication of larger issues like data corruption perhaps during a crash or hang or power reset or bad drive
2006-01-10T12:16:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	doesn't look like it
2006-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	yes
2006-01-10T12:20:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	ok so that seemed to work properly but nautilus still wont start from the link in Places but it ran from the terminal
2006-01-10T14:10:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	perhaps this next-current problem ties into the other missing files issues I had with firefox and nautilus and locales and lost video config
2006-01-10T14:54:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	if mmolina has no way to make amends and behave then banning only creates barriers for people to learn about ubuntu or even bother trying
2006-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	please unban mmolina so that they have a chance to learn some etiquet and so that they dont go back to microsoft.   those end users get easily frustrated and humans just want to know they were heard in the forest of noise.
2006-01-10T15:01:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	"Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others". Ubuntu also means "I am what I am because of who we all are". The Ubuntu Linux distribution brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.
2006-01-10T15:04:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	please stop it
2006-01-10T15:04:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	please unban mmolina he doesnt deserve to be shutdown as he was already being told
2006-01-10T15:05:00.000Z	techone	Seveas	please let me know how one can ask to be unbanned if they cannot get into the channel
2006-01-10T15:05:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	he can enter the channel, just muted
2006-01-10T15:06:00.000Z	Seveas	techone	and for this kind of off-topic discussions we have #ubuntu-offtopic
