2008-02-08T17:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	explain "I messed up user privileges"
2008-02-08T17:31:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	well, I created in new group, 'shared', using groupadd shared. Then I add myself to the group, using usermod - G shared fred (fred being my username). If I groups fred, I can see that I am part of two groups : fred and shared. But I can no longer sudo, nor add/remove/update my system.
2008-02-08T17:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	boot into recovery mode and add yourself to the admin group use "sudo adduser fred admin"
2008-02-08T17:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	usermod - G shared fred  is a bad bad idea becouse usermod remove you from all the groups you were to place you on the shared group only
2008-02-08T17:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	from now on use adduser
2008-02-08T17:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	once you get again admin rights you will have to add yourself to many other groups or some things will fail (as audio plugdev lpadmin etc...)
2008-02-08T17:34:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	ok, will do. Thanks a lot ; I wasn't aware usermod -G would do that, as help states "new list fo supplementary groups" (as opposed to -g).
2008-02-08T17:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	;)
2009-10-31T20:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	which cpu ? a p4 ?
2009-10-31T20:54:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	yes, a p4
2009-10-31T20:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	well the n they are right your cpu does not support scaling... it was a hack and now they (the kernel dev) no longer support it
2009-10-31T20:56:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	is that why I can't even modprobe cpufreq_powersave ? That module isn't even found on my system.
2009-10-31T20:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	probably or just they made it builtin in this version
2009-10-31T20:57:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	right. Well I'm going to dd back to Jaunty then, because I'm getting some serious overheating over here
2009-10-31T20:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	then that's a bug. the module/driver should work only to prevent heat damage (not for powersaving)
2009-10-31T20:59:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	besides, I have SpeedStep on/off in my Bios - so I just took it for granted I had cpu scaling
2009-10-31T21:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	wee i dunno the details but seems like p4 only went iddle when asked to lower its freq so you did not get much powersavings just overheat protection
2009-10-31T21:02:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	ok, thanks. Any idea how to get the different governors modprobed ?
2009-10-31T21:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	nope
2009-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	MrEgg964	erUSUL	thanks anyway. Bye.
2009-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	MrEgg964	no problem
