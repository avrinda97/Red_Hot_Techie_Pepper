2007-10-31T21:22:00.000Z	Jimdb		anyone know how to reset the xine audio subsystem without rebooting?
2007-10-31T21:23:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	I don't think xine is an audio subsystem, most systems use alsa, the command to restart is "sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils resart" (I think)
2007-10-31T21:23:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	restart even, if it isn't alsa utils, you can tab complete after alsa
2007-10-31T21:25:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 how do i determine the card.  it wants the card to complete the command
2007-10-31T21:25:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	it shouldn't do that, it sounds like your alsa setup may be broken or possibly you're using a different sound architecture
2007-10-31T21:27:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 what happened was that I had amarok playing tunes.  I then went into a website that had a youtube video.  It had no sound so I stopped amarok and reloaded the page.  it reloaded and began playing.  then it stopped responding.  i left it alone to give the page time to respond in firefox.  firefox, after about 10 minutes began playing the video again with sound.  now I can't get amarok to play even though that page is no longer
2007-10-31T21:29:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 the command states it wants the card.  jimbo@Gutsy32-X2:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils resart nvidia
2007-10-31T21:31:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	I don't know much about the sound architecture, I just know how to restart it
2007-10-31T21:31:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	wait did you put "nvidia" in you command?
2007-10-31T21:33:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	that shouldn't be necessary, (the [] mean an optional argument) all I can guess is that your sound hasn't been setup properly somewhere...
2007-10-31T21:33:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	I'm assuming you did try it without any argument after "restart"
2007-10-31T21:33:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 i have an x-fi card in there as well that linux doesn't know what to do with.
2007-10-31T21:35:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	if you open your System>Prefs>Sound you can see which sound cards are recognised
2007-10-31T21:36:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 the x-fi card is not recognized under linux.  there are no 32 bit drivers for it from creative.  i just haven't taken the time to remove the card from the computer once I found out that linux does not support that card at all.
2007-10-31T21:37:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	if your normal card is recognised all you should have to do is "...alsa-utils restart", if there are further problems than that, I'm not sure I can help you sorry :/
2007-10-31T21:38:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 both cards are seen by linux.  lspci says the xfi card is there but it can't be used because there are no drivers.  the command that you gave matches the required syntax per their help message.  I pasted yours in instead of typing.  it doesn't reset and it gives that help text in response to issuing the command.
2007-10-31T21:38:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	ah, did you copy my "resart" typo? :P
2007-10-31T21:39:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 lol, yep
2007-10-31T21:39:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	does it work spelt right? :P
2007-10-31T21:40:00.000Z	Jimdb	aninhumer	 amarok generates the same message.  it did reset asla but amarok still says the same thing.  i'll have to wait till later to restart the computer i guess.
2007-10-31T21:41:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	ah well, the problem might not be alsa after all, the only other thing I could suggest is restarting amaroK, but you may already have done that
2007-10-31T21:41:00.000Z	aninhumer	Jimdb	ah well, I have pizza waiting anyway
