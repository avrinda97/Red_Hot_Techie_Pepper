2006-10-29T06:41:00.000Z	River		My Edgy upgrade from 6.06 was interrupted and now fails to boot with "/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf" no such file ore directory, can someone help ?
2006-10-29T06:42:00.000Z	variant	River	boot to the live cd and chroot your ubuntu install, from there continue the apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-10-29T06:43:00.000Z	variant	River	as long as you can get a command line it doesnt matter
2006-10-29T06:44:00.000Z	variant	River	even a gentoo live cd will do :) you just need a chroot environment
2006-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	River	variant	I tried previously via "recover broken system" although the upgrade continued, many things failed because /usr and /proc amongst others were not mounted
2006-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	variant	River	then the answer is simple.
2006-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	variant	River	Boot the live cd and we can go from there
2006-10-29T06:46:00.000Z	variant	River	you should register with nickserv so we can continue in /query as this is a littl ebusy
2006-10-29T06:47:00.000Z	River	variant	sorry what do you mean re nickserv
2006-10-29T06:47:00.000Z	variant	River	you are in irc, there is a "nickserve" on this irc network that you can register your nick (river) with and then you will be able to talk to be in a private chat
2006-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	River	variant	nickserv is a channel or a server , sorry bit of a noob
2006-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	variant	River	nickserv is a bot on this network
2006-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	variant	River	dont worry about it, just get back to doing what you were doing :P
