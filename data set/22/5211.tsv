2007-10-07T05:02:00.000Z	Wood1		guys, do you think that a Windows user can fully migrate to Linux/Ubuntu? or should use Ubuntu for some software and Windows for other software, since not all Windows software work on Ubuntu.. please make me understand how can you work on Ubuntu and most of the software that is out work only for Windows. Thanks a lot
