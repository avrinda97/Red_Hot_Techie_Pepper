2006-09-30T10:44:00.000Z	omar		Hi guys, I gotta a Cellphone Sony ericsson and I would like to mount it in my linux, do you know how to do it??? all the software in Internet is for Windows
2006-09-30T10:45:00.000Z	LjL	omar	well, "apt-cache search ericsson" does show up a few packages. perhaps some of them might be what you need?
2006-09-30T10:47:00.000Z	LjL	omar	also, "apt-cache show gnokii". from the description, i'm not really sure i understand what it is - but it does involve communicating with Symbian phone (your Sony Ericsson has Symbian, doesn't it?)
2007-12-29T23:16:00.000Z	LjL	omar	what problem?

2007-12-29T23:31:00.000Z	LjL	omar	i didn't want you to paste it, i wanted you to generate a new sources.list using the site i gave you and then make it your new /etc/apt/sources.list. (use « gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list » to be allowed to edit and save the file)
2007-12-29T23:32:00.000Z	omar	LjL	To paste it*
2007-12-29T23:34:00.000Z	omar	LjL	Do I paste the source list in my source.list file now??
2007-12-29T23:34:00.000Z	LjL	omar	yes, paste the one that you created from the site into your file, and delete the old one.
2007-12-29T23:35:00.000Z	omar	LjL	Done, what now?
2007-12-29T23:35:00.000Z	LjL	omar	type « sudo apt-get update » and then try again installing
