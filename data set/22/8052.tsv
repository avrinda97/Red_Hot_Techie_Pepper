2005-10-26T12:54:00.000Z	canindya		I am getting a very unusual problem,have apache2 running and php4 also installed,but when i am trying to run a php file with phpinfo() it fails to run, any pointers?
2005-10-26T12:54:00.000Z	budluva	canindya	is php configured properly?
2005-10-26T12:55:00.000Z	canindya	budluva	I didnt get you? what all the things/files I need check?
2005-10-26T12:55:00.000Z	budluva	canindya	well apache/php4 have to be configured correctly, it just doesnt work out of the box
2005-10-26T12:56:00.000Z	canindya	budluva	any site/link?
2005-10-26T12:56:00.000Z	budluva	canindya	been awhile since i ran apache/php but i think /etc/php4/ should have a config file, read through it, and do the same with /etc/apache/ there should be a config file in there aswell
