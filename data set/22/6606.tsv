2007-01-08T16:35:00.000Z	mooey		!blackbox
2007-01-08T16:36:00.000Z	mooey		i need a really minimal window manager. something only with virtual desktops and a right click menu that i can place only the items i need in. does anyone have any recommendations?
2007-01-08T16:37:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	fluxbox?
2007-01-08T16:37:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	or xfce4
2007-01-08T16:38:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	i've got xfce installed but the problem is i can't see how to customise the menu on right click, i need to remove a bunch of apps. i want a desktop basically with nothing but a web browser and a text editor, no other distractions like solitair :D
2007-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	i think there should be a menu.xml somewhere in ~/.xfce4/
2007-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	thank you :-)
2007-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	and theres a tool called xfce4-menueditor too
2007-01-08T16:40:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	http://www.xfce.org/documentation/docs-4.2/xfdesktop.html
2007-01-08T16:40:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	i looked at that but it didn't seem to let me remove a bunch of items
2007-01-08T16:42:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	maybe what you want is to use a very simple wm, disable the right click menu completly, and then use something like that mac-osx-bar look-a-like thing which name i forgot to just display a big firefox icon..
2007-01-08T16:43:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	i would quite like to avoid wasting screen space on panels and icons. if i cant bend xfce to do what i would like i will use fluxbox i think :-)
2007-01-08T16:44:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	thats the point, what i am image would be just a black screen with one icon
2007-01-08T16:44:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	what i'm thinking of
2007-01-08T16:44:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	basically, yep. gnome has toooo much to distract me from actually doing any work, heh.
2007-01-08T16:46:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	thats why i thought you might just wann use that macosx thing, cause it will run with every wm, won't display any panels, and have an optional hoover over effect that looks fancy
2007-01-08T16:50:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	it seems enlightenment already has an osx like dock, http://www.enlightenment.org/Applications/Engage/ - perhaps i should try enlightenment before other window managers :-)
2007-01-08T16:52:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	that looks like what i thought about, but i think there exists a standalone dock app too... somewhere
2007-01-08T16:53:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	there are a few i think. there was one called kiga or something, but i can't find it now.
2007-01-08T16:53:00.000Z	laz0r	mooey	but i guess enlightenment is a very good choice as wm if you want customizability and a nice look
2007-01-08T16:54:00.000Z	mooey	laz0r	enlightenment looks good. im going to go and poke xfce for abit. thank you for your advice :-)
