2005-12-18T08:10:00.000Z	bulio		when upgrading to ubuntu 5.10 from 4.10?
2005-12-18T08:10:00.000Z	linkd	bulio	update first
2005-12-18T08:10:00.000Z	linkd	bulio	and its dist-upgrade not dist-update
2005-12-18T08:10:00.000Z	bulio		so apt-get update?
2005-12-18T08:10:00.000Z	linkd	bulio	so apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-12-18T08:11:00.000Z	bulio		just type it like that?
2005-12-18T08:11:00.000Z	linkd	bulio	u can do it u want to do both, one after the other yes, but u might need to prefix "sudo" to the front of both commands first :)
2005-12-18T08:11:00.000Z	bulio		linkdd: dist-upgrade first I guess

2005-12-18T08:12:00.000Z	linkd	bulio	no no, apt-get update first, to update ur repo list, THEN apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade ur distribution
