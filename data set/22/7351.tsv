2006-04-20T10:14:00.000Z	blindx		Any recommendations on a VCD burning program? (that can handle avi's?)
2006-04-20T10:15:00.000Z	blindx		if you don't know the command "gedit" then you probably should learn it, or stop using linux.
2006-04-20T10:15:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	Well technically it's a program ;)
2006-04-20T10:16:00.000Z	blindx	_jon	?
2006-04-20T10:16:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	gedit is a program\command
2006-04-20T10:19:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	K.I.S.S. as much as possible :)
2006-04-20T10:19:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	Keep it simple, stupid. (not meant to be offensive)
2006-04-20T10:26:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	You can edit it manually, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf  find where you see a list of resolutions...and add what you want there..
2006-04-20T10:26:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	then restart X, if it fails, just sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-04-20T10:30:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	Did you edit it correctly?  Why don't you pastebin your xorg?
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	And .. also, did you restart Xorg?
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	blindx	_jon	I edited it once, and it worked, but it was at 43hz
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	Ah.
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	Do you have the right drivers? yeah what resin said.
2006-04-20T10:32:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	Not your monitor silly ;)  Monitors are for kids.  What kind of onboard?
2006-04-20T10:33:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	What kind of Dell? You can google it :)
2006-04-20T10:38:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	What file is it?
2006-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	What is your graphics card again?
2006-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	What model?
2006-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	_jon	blindx	What's your Dell model again?
