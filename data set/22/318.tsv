2011-12-27T23:27:00.000Z	nvz		sounds like denial to me..
2011-12-27T23:28:00.000Z	nvz		denial is usually what causes people to to get primary hard disk failures and then go through the motions of blaming the MBR, partition table, filesystem..etc rather than buying a new HDD
2011-12-27T23:28:00.000Z	nvz		:-P
2011-12-27T23:29:00.000Z	epall	nvz	I can mount the drive just fine -- would e2fsck turn up anything?
2011-12-27T23:30:00.000Z	epall	nvz	how would I check SMART status of the drive from a LiveCD?
2011-12-27T23:31:00.000Z	nvz	epall	exactly the same way you do from a normal system
2011-12-27T23:31:00.000Z	epall	nvz	thanks! will try
2011-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	nvz	epall	this is all irrelevant the bios is generating the error and doesn't know or care about smart, filesystem, or any of that crap
2011-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	epall	nvz	why would the BIOS call the drive shot if SMART says it's all good?
2011-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	epall	nvz	if you're suggesting an actual hardware failure, wouldn't SMART notice?
2011-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	nvz	epall	its not saying the drive is shot it doesnt care about that either
2011-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	epall	nvz	what is it saying?
2011-12-27T23:33:00.000Z	nvz	epall	depending on if its manuallly configured or auto its saying whatever it thinks is there it cannot find a bootsector on
2011-12-27T23:33:00.000Z	epall	nvz	wouldn't grub-install re-write the bootsector?
2011-12-27T23:33:00.000Z	epall	nvz	it's manually configured to boot from HDD0
2011-12-27T23:34:00.000Z	epall	nvz	could my BIOS be too old to handle grub2 or something?
2011-12-27T23:34:00.000Z	nvz	epall	doubt it unless you enabled some uefi feature
2011-12-27T23:35:00.000Z	epall	nvz	so if it's  not a hardware failure and the issue is the MBR, why did it  happen immediately after I installed 10.10?
2011-12-27T23:36:00.000Z	nvz	epall	idk.. does your bios checksum the bootsector?
2011-12-27T23:36:00.000Z	epall	nvz	don't think so
2011-12-27T23:36:00.000Z	epall	nvz	so you assert something is wrong with the drive and I should go buy a new one?
2011-12-27T23:36:00.000Z	epall	nvz	how would I validate that hypothesis?
