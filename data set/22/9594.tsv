2005-01-05T08:59:00.000Z	LinuxSanta		kamion:  Im glad finally the bug was recognized
2005-01-05T08:59:00.000Z	LinuxSanta		that bug was annoying the heck out of me
2005-01-05T08:59:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	we always recognised it as a bug
2005-01-05T09:00:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	bug number?
2005-01-05T09:00:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	what e-mail address?
2005-01-05T09:00:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	I want to, though
2005-01-05T09:00:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	are you sure it wasn't just closed as a duplicate?
2005-01-05T09:02:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	more that upstream took care of it rather than the evidently broken hack we imported from Debian
2005-01-05T09:04:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	it's been pretty much a FAQ
2005-01-05T09:04:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	yeah
2005-01-05T09:06:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	fixmbr doesn't always do it
2005-01-05T09:24:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	recovery mode in the installer, you mean?
2005-01-05T09:25:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	we should be getting that eventually, I have a preliminary implementation for d-i
2005-01-05T09:35:00.000Z	Kamion	LinuxSanta	indeed so
