2007-06-29T14:29:00.000Z	Chads		Would anyone be willing to PM me and walk me through Ubuntu?
2007-06-29T14:31:00.000Z	Chads		How do you get Ndiswrapper off the Ubuntu CD. I've looked in packages. Synaptics. Add/remove and none of them show Ndiswrapper-utils.
2007-06-29T14:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	this is 7.04 or 6.06 or what?
2007-06-29T14:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	Unfortunately (for reasons unbeknownst to me), ndiswrapper was taken off the CD for feisty.  You'll have to get a USB drive or something and sneakernet it (you can get it from packages.ubuntu.com)
2007-06-29T14:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	try https://help.ubuntu.com/7.04/internet/C/connect-to-internet.html
2007-06-29T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	hmm, well, that seems to indicate that it is infct on the CD.  It gives you instructions on how to install (if you read and follow the windows wireless driver link).  Let me know if it is actually on the CD, once you figure it out.  Mind you, you might not need ndiswrapper at all.
2007-06-29T14:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	Put it on a USB drive, and then walk it to the linux PC, and plug it in (walking, on sneakers, hence the "sneakernet")
2007-06-29T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	you've got the ndiswrapper deb file for your version of ubuntu, right?  If so, copy it onto your desktop (so you'll have it for later if you need it) and then double click it.
2007-06-29T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	if you don't have it in a deb for your vrsion, http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=ndiswrapper&searchon=names&subword=1&version=feisty&release=all  click the package you want, then at the bottom of that page, there's a table with arches (386, x64, etc), click the one you want, and you'll get mirrors.
2007-06-29T14:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	deb is debian format, yeah.  But debian debs aren't necessarily compatable with ubuntu ones (because of naming/versioning differences with dependencies, mostl)
2007-06-29T14:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	I don't know.
2007-06-29T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	I looked in the mailing lists, didn't see any mention of it.  Which is odd by itself.  More odd is that they still seem to think it's in there.
2007-06-29T16:05:00.000Z	Chads	Flannel	your some bloke!
2007-06-29T15:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	you want the -utils package (but grab them all, just in case)
2007-06-29T15:42:00.000Z	Chads	Flannel	Cheers mate. I'll put them all on me USB stick and then if I place them on the Ubuntu desktop I should just be able to doubleclick them?
2007-06-29T15:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	you double click the utils one, since that's the one you use. Or, from what I understand.  I've never done it.
2007-06-29T15:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-06-29T15:48:00.000Z	Chads	Flannel	I just find that help.ubuntu assumes you have some knowledge of Linux. For someone like me, although a quick learner its like reading ancient greek.
2007-06-29T15:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	That wiki page should lay it out pretty well.  It even covered how to use sneakernet too.
2007-06-29T16:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper#head-ccd66d4fcaaab3a6e7a5c47162c1b7c6f52d41e5
2007-06-29T16:10:00.000Z	Chads	Flannel	I just did lspci from the terminal and it recognised my card does this mean I should be able to use it?
2007-06-29T16:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Chads	no idea.  Whatever that page says is the extent of my knowledge.
