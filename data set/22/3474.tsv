2008-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	moda1		okay, so it says that this command will uninstall Grub # dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1
2008-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	moda1		the usb thing is sdg
2008-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	That command will WIPE OUT the disk's partition table
2008-10-07T13:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	You've got Vista, right?
2008-10-07T13:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Only need to replace ~360 bytes in sector 0 - If you can find someone who has a Windows Vista installation with intact windows MBR it is easy to replace.
2008-10-07T13:56:00.000Z	moda1	IntuitiveNipple	I can get into the BIOS when I start up the PC, I there some way to bypass GRUB from there?
2008-10-07T13:57:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	No, GRUB has replaced the Windows boot-strap code in sector 0 of the hard-disk
2008-10-07T13:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Here is what it *should* look like :)
2008-10-07T13:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	http://www.multibooters.co.uk/mbr.html
2008-10-07T13:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	I was trying to locate a Vista MBR image someplace for you
2008-10-07T14:01:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Yes, but you'll end up needing a dual-boot setup, since with GRUB it needs somewhere to install the boot menu etc
2008-10-07T14:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Yes
2008-10-07T14:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	That is a bit drastic! You only need to replace 446 bytes :)
2008-10-07T14:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Let's see if we can find someone that has it, then it's just a case of using dd to write it to the disk
2008-10-07T14:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	You're on that PC running Ubuntu right now?
2008-10-07T14:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	OK, but you can boot that PC with a Live CD or USb stick?
2008-10-07T14:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	good - then it has the tool you need to write the data back
2008-10-07T14:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Still trying to find a copy of the MBR for you :)
2008-10-07T14:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Yeah... I'm digging through the Vista install on this laptop to extract the MBR for you
2008-10-07T14:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	none! plently of people talking about, but not one I can find to download!
2008-10-07T15:00:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	That's good, do it
2008-10-07T15:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	moda1	Nice one, glad you got it fixed so painlesslyu
