2010-08-01T19:00:00.000Z	bareego		dive kinda... but it was sarge
2010-08-01T19:01:00.000Z	bareego		would be good if apt-get had some rollback feature
2010-08-01T19:02:00.000Z	bareego		just for the last action
2010-08-01T19:02:00.000Z	bareego		you su to a new user ?
2010-08-01T19:02:00.000Z	dive-o	bareego	or at least was smart enough to realize that libpam-heimdal is not something that means "nuke all of gnome, and everything else while you're there"
2010-08-01T19:03:00.000Z	bareego		on my sarge based debian on my xbox server all I did was apt-get install mplayer
2010-08-01T19:03:00.000Z	dive-o		i'd finally gotten gnome exactly how I liked it, then it decides to screw itself. wonderful.
2010-08-01T19:03:00.000Z	bareego		and it tried to plug friggin libc6 and new kernel and crap in
2010-08-01T19:03:00.000Z	dive-o		yeah, this is why I don't like trusting dpkg
2010-08-01T19:04:00.000Z	bareego		so now I plugged the disk in a normal pc so I just run a new distro on it
2010-08-01T19:04:00.000Z	dive-o		at least freebsd backs up my packages before arbitrarily deleting them during dependency hell :P
2010-08-01T19:04:00.000Z	dive-o	bareego	if it ends up being more of a pain to recover than to reinstall, I'm ditching ubuntu on that machine
2010-08-01T19:04:00.000Z	bareego		I put lubuntu on it and it works wonderfully
2010-08-01T19:04:00.000Z	dive-o		love it on my netbook, but i have to reconsider trusting it with anything important if it's gonna pull crap like this
2010-08-01T19:05:00.000Z	bareego		setup was really quick.. .just copying the data back takes some time
2010-08-01T19:06:00.000Z	bareego		this time round I bothered to keep the data partition seperate to the linux partition, doh
2010-08-01T19:08:00.000Z	dive-o	bareego	the data i most care about is on other machines, but still, this is ridiculous. I've seen package management screwups on just about everything i've ever used, but never a case of "removing a package nothing uses? ok, i'll take out your whole system"
2010-08-01T19:09:00.000Z	dive-o		system -> administration -> hardware drivers
2010-08-01T19:09:00.000Z	bareego	dive-o	know what you mean
2010-08-01T19:09:00.000Z	bareego		when I did the mplayer install first thing it did was remove swat
2010-08-01T19:09:00.000Z	bareego		I was like WTF ???
2010-08-01T19:10:00.000Z	dive-o	bareego	I guess at least when I've shot myself in the foot on BSD I can think of a distinct stupid thing I did :P
