2008-03-24T23:39:00.000Z	a28		Question: does anyone have an idea as to why certain web pages will NOT begin to load in linux, but will in windows? (same machine, same firefox, etc)
2008-03-24T23:39:00.000Z	a28		i can't even wget a png file from this webserver in linux, but i can in windows
2008-03-24T23:40:00.000Z	anthony	a28	Only certain pages though?
2008-03-24T23:40:00.000Z	a28	anthony	yes and all part of Ohio State University servers
2008-03-24T23:40:00.000Z	a28	anthony	Mark_G http://www.ureg.ohio-state.edu/ourweb/more/Content/Important_dates/SP08_Important_dates.htm there is one that wont work right now
2008-03-24T23:41:00.000Z	anthony	a28	are you quite sure the problem is on _your_ end?
2008-03-24T23:41:00.000Z	a28	anthony	Mark_G http://fod.osu.edu/2008/library_path_alternate.png there is the PNG just to make it simpler
2008-03-24T23:42:00.000Z	a28	anthony	no but i dont know how to continue diagnosing
2008-03-24T23:42:00.000Z	anthony	a28	It doesn't load for me either, not on Ubuntu right now.  Not your problem.
2008-03-24T23:42:00.000Z	anthony	a28	call up the admin and tell them it's down...
2008-03-24T23:42:00.000Z	a28	anthony	what OS? it will load for me on this exact same machine if i boot in windows
2008-03-24T23:42:00.000Z	anthony	a28	Mac 10.5
2008-03-24T23:42:00.000Z	a28	anthony	the admin will say "what OS are you using? sorry we dont support that"
2008-03-24T23:43:00.000Z	anthony	a28	You never answer that question.
2008-03-24T23:43:00.000Z	a28	anthony	hehehe
2008-03-24T23:43:00.000Z	a28	anthony	im just stumped as to what could possibly be making the difference, when i cant even wget the stupid png
2008-03-24T23:43:00.000Z	anthony	a28	Most likely you have the DNS information cached in Windows b/c you've visited the site before, and don't have it cached in Ubuntu, and the DNS servers are down/incorrect right now.  If you flush the DNS info in XP, it will probably fail there too.
2008-03-24T23:44:00.000Z	a28	anthony	it has never worked in linux though, and i rebooted into windows and it worked the very first time i encountered this. also it has never hung in windows
2008-03-24T23:45:00.000Z	a28	anthony	i tried using the useragent thing in firefox but to no avail figured that might be it
2008-03-24T23:46:00.000Z	anthony	a28	eh, just call 'em up and say it's broken in everything.  If it doesn't load for your Ubuntu or anyone else here, it's clearly a problem on their end regardless of what the problem is.  Someone is being paid for this - make them do it.
2008-03-24T23:46:00.000Z	a28	anthony	hehe well if it doesnt work in macOS then i can always lie and say im using that, if they press me
2008-03-24T23:47:00.000Z	anthony	a28	sure thing
