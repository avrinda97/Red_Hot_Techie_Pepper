2006-08-13T11:03:00.000Z	edju		Let's try another way - what's the easiest way to add/remove programs in ubuntu?
2006-08-13T11:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	one more vote fot apt-get
2006-08-13T11:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	dpkg --purge foo to remove
2006-08-13T11:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	system > admin > synaptic if you like guis
2006-08-13T11:06:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	It's a new install, and I don't have menu items that the help references.
2006-08-13T11:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	system > admin > synaptic should even be present in a new install
2006-08-13T11:07:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	Nope.
2006-08-13T11:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	weird
2006-08-13T11:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	sudo adduser foo admin
2006-08-13T12:00:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	That doesn't seem to work.  e.g., sudo visudo returns nothing.
2006-08-13T12:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	"sudo adduser foo admin"  no visudo
2006-08-13T12:04:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	sudo adduser --- admin doesn't work
2006-08-13T12:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	are you running this from your primary user account?
2006-08-13T12:05:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	It's the only user account.
2006-08-13T12:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	can that user sudo for other things?
2006-08-13T12:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	sudo gedit /root/deleteme
2006-08-13T12:06:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	Nothing.
2006-08-13T12:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	then type gibberish, then try to save
2006-08-13T12:07:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	That command returns nothing - nothing happens
2006-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	edju	eyequeue	Doesn't call gedit.
2006-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	it's possible your sudo is broken
2006-08-13T12:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	edju	boot to recovery mode
