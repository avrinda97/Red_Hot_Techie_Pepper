2006-03-05T08:07:00.000Z	matthew_w		So I've done some looking
2006-03-05T08:07:00.000Z	matthew_w		and I can't find anything in the way of Visual Compiling.  Like, drawing a window, having it output the code, etc.  Or even templates.
2006-03-05T08:08:00.000Z	jimcooncat	matthew_w	depends on your language flavor
2006-03-05T08:08:00.000Z	matthew_w		jimcooncat; explain.
2006-03-05T08:09:00.000Z	jimcooncat	matthew_w	like wxGlade if you're into python
2006-03-05T08:09:00.000Z	jimcooncat		there's regular Glade, and Tk for TCL
2006-03-05T08:10:00.000Z	jimcooncat		you can do some fun things with Openoffice too
2006-03-05T08:10:00.000Z	matthew_w		jimcooncat; oh?  I will have to check that out.  What's python similar to?
2006-03-05T08:10:00.000Z	matthew_w		pomalley; did you change to a DVI output?  Like for a flat screen monitor?
2006-03-05T08:10:00.000Z	jimcooncat	matthew_w	like javascript -- not
2006-03-05T08:11:00.000Z	jimcooncat		but it's a scripting language
2006-03-05T08:11:00.000Z	matthew_w		jimooncat o_O  SO, you can make programs with it that stand alone, yes>
2006-03-05T08:11:00.000Z	jimcooncat		easy as any other to learn
2006-03-05T08:11:00.000Z	matthew_w		pomalley; ok.
2006-03-05T08:11:00.000Z	jimcooncat	matthew_w	yes, but it depends on your audience
2006-03-05T08:12:00.000Z	matthew_w		jimcooncat; Also, it can compile in C++ now, apparently.
2006-03-05T08:12:00.000Z	matthew_w		jimcooncat; or so it says in the installer.
2006-03-05T08:12:00.000Z	jimcooncat	matthew_w	I just apt-get what I need
2006-03-05T08:13:00.000Z	matthew_w	jimcooncat	When you say depends on my audience, what do you mean?  Like only linux users will be able to use it?
2006-03-05T08:13:00.000Z	matthew_w		robr; what are you installing?
2006-03-05T08:13:00.000Z	matthew_w		robr; Ok, what stage are you at?
2006-03-05T08:13:00.000Z	jimcooncat	matthew_w	like you have to learn how to package for ubuntu, or for red hat, or for windows -- different techniques for each
