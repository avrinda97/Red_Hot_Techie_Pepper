2012-02-14T06:53:00.000Z	cryptodira		amd/64 10.10 reinstall after failed upgrade to 11.04..... i have to hit escape during boot, otherwise the system hangs... grub appears and shows a 38.13 kernel as first choice (this hangs) second and booting is 35-32.65...... dpkg -l | grep linux-image-2 does NOT show the hanging kernel , further the system says that grub is NOT installed.... i am unable to do ati upgrades and suspect the kernel issue is the cause.... how do i remove the newest kerne
