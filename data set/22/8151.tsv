2005-10-23T10:19:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		dabar : its jsut one line : ** (gnome-volume-manager:29352): WARNING **: manager.c/2199: already running?
2005-10-23T10:20:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		dabar, running may be a 'big' word for now
2005-10-23T10:21:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		dabar : the GUI error is just 'error: impossible to run 'pmount'
2005-10-23T10:22:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		dabar, like...22:00 hours not even a day
2005-10-23T10:22:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		damn :|
2005-10-23T10:23:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		thx anyway
2005-10-23T10:23:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		well. does anybody else knows about mount cd/dvd problems ?
2005-10-23T10:24:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	yes i know about them
2005-10-23T10:25:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	r0xoR	 could you help me here :  my ubuntu wont auto-mount cd/dvd's , i always have to do it in terminal (even if i click 'mount' on them it wont work, makes an error)
2005-10-23T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	hmmm, i don't remember the trick for automounting CD's
2005-10-23T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	what's the need for automount? there is an applet you can put in your gnome-panel
2005-10-23T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	and you can mount them with one click
2005-10-23T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	otherwise the only time i mount them is when i actually PLAY a DVD with kaffeine or mplayer
2005-10-23T10:27:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	r0xoR	 i mean..when i put a cd in my drive...i like to have em popping up right along..
2005-10-23T10:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	and they both take care of it automatically
2005-10-23T10:28:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	yes i know... i don't quite remember... i think you might need to put the "auto" option into /etc/fstab
2005-10-23T10:28:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	probably "auto,user"
2006-05-06T08:10:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	are you trying to recompile your kernel?
2006-05-06T08:11:00.000Z	r0xoR	B_166-ER-X	whutz that?
