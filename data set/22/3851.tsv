2010-07-19T14:22:00.000Z	ader10		It's running the TCP/IP NetBIOS service and I've disabled windows share security, even.
2010-07-19T14:23:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	what's up?
2010-07-19T14:24:00.000Z	ader10	daftykins	I can't connect to an Ubuntu samba server from a Windows 7 client, and so far none of the Ubuntu documentation I've found has helped
2010-07-19T14:24:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	i see, what's your config?
2010-07-19T14:25:00.000Z	ader10	daftykins	1 min, I'll pastebin it
2010-07-19T14:27:00.000Z	ader10	daftykins	http://pastebin.com/dmz7y6Mb
2010-07-19T14:28:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	are you trying to browse to them from the windows 7 client as \\IP\x$ or \\IP\x where x = w,x,y,z ?
2010-07-19T14:29:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	workgroup is definitely "WORKGROUP" yeah?
2010-07-19T14:30:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	try installing samba-common and samba-tools
2010-07-19T14:31:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	so were you saying before that you can't run "/etc/init.d/samba restart" ?
2010-07-19T14:32:00.000Z	ader10	daftykins	Correct, the right command is "smbd restart" (the guide is out of date)
2010-07-19T14:32:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	hrmm pretty sure it works for me
2010-07-19T14:33:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	i take it the /media/x folders exist and your user has permissions on them?
2010-07-19T14:36:00.000Z	ader10	daftykins	Viking667 scriptwarlock violinappren: Thank you all for your attention, but I doubt that this can be solved without loads of trouble
2010-07-19T14:36:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	hrmm, i take it you can ping each machine? what does win7 error with?
2010-07-19T14:37:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	instantaneous or after a delay?
2010-07-19T14:38:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	sounds like either samba's not running or it's not able to connect to the ports properly
2010-07-19T14:39:00.000Z	ader10	daftykins	Do you know how I can check if it's connecting to the ports properly?
2010-07-19T14:39:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	i would look up the default ports then nmap scan the sharing ubuntu box from the windows box
2010-07-19T14:49:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	you weren't trying to browse to the shares with a hostname were you?
2010-07-19T14:54:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	use the syntax "nmap -sS <IP>"
2010-07-19T14:56:00.000Z	daftykins	ader10	did you have a server running a different OS on that IP address before?
