2005-07-22T15:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	1) debian distros use .xsession 2) you write it yourself
2005-09-29T15:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	youdid a dist-upgrade, right ? Not just upgrade ?
2005-09-29T15:45:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	no just upgrade
2005-09-29T15:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	you need to dist-upgrade :)
2005-09-29T15:45:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	doh!
2005-09-29T15:46:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	bah! im just going to do a fresh install of breezy since i already have the iso. it is saying that it will download 300+ meg
2005-09-29T15:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	that sounds about right
2005-09-30T07:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	 ls -l /dev/cdrom
2005-09-30T07:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	at the end  of the line -> hdc for example
2005-09-30T07:11:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	thanks im burning breezy colony 5 from cdrecord
2005-11-29T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	/etc/hdparm.conf IIRC
2005-11-29T10:36:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	yeah i did that as wiki says but its not working
2005-11-29T10:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	you can use commands in /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh (but it's deprecated)
2005-11-29T10:38:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	i ran that and it didn't do anything
2005-11-29T10:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	then I'm running out of ideas - Works For Me (tm)
2005-11-29T10:39:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	what is that script supposed to do?
2005-11-29T10:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	it's a start up script for "miscellaneous" things you want to start on boot
2005-11-29T10:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	you can add stuff to it at the end, before the exit
2005-11-29T10:40:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	i figured it out
2005-11-29T10:40:00.000Z	zenlunatic	thoreauputic	had /dev/hdc instead of /dev/cdrom
2005-11-29T10:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zenlunatic	ah well it has to point at the right device of course :)
