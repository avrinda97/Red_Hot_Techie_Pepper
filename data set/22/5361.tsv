2008-12-22T19:03:00.000Z	enigma_		I have strange problem. I use Ubuntu 8.10 and settings 1024*768@60
2008-12-22T19:03:00.000Z	enigma_		when I starrt system on my LCD I see INPUT IS OUT OF RANGE
2008-12-22T19:03:00.000Z	enigma_		so I swicth to CRT monitor, log into system and swict back to LCD
2008-12-22T19:03:00.000Z	enigma_		and now on LCD everything looks ok
2008-12-22T19:03:00.000Z	enigma_		so what may be a problem??
2008-12-22T19:04:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	what make/model is the monitor?
2008-12-22T19:05:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	and what video card?
2008-12-22T19:05:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	not yet... was the LG plugged in when you turned the computer on?
2008-12-22T19:06:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	and at what point, exactly, does the LG step out of frequency?
2008-12-22T19:07:00.000Z	enigma_	Gnea	probably yes
2008-12-22T19:07:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	If I understand you correctly, the system boots up with the ubuntu logo, then when the login screen proceeds to appear, it steps out of frequency then?
2008-12-22T19:08:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	go ahead and pastebin xorg.conf *and* /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-12-22T19:09:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	thanks, looking
2008-12-22T19:12:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	I'm going to guess that your CRT monitor is made by CTX?
2008-12-22T19:12:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	okay, because as I see it, you booted it up, this time anyway, with the CRT plugged in... are you able to ctrl-alt-F1?
2008-12-22T19:13:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	okay - if you press ctrl-alt-F1, it should take you to a console - then use ctrl-alt-f7 to get back to the GUI
2008-12-22T19:14:00.000Z	enigma_	Gnea	ok, I back for a moment, I will try
2008-12-22T19:15:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	please
2008-12-22T19:21:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	okay, your xorg.conf is trying to force a specific display down your monitor's throat. your monitor is saying: "uh, no."
2008-12-22T19:22:00.000Z	enigma_	Gnea	why?
2008-12-22T19:22:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	because different monitors have different frequency ranges, and this is especially true between CRT and LCD displays
2008-12-22T19:25:00.000Z	Gnea	enigma_	try this one: http://pastebin.com/m5175cf4f
