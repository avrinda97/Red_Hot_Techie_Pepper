2008-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	truebosko		Hi there .. I am trying to configur my monitors (dual display) and I've followed numeruos guides with no luck. I just recently updated Ubuntu after a ~5 month hiatus. Has anything changed in the dual screen front?
2008-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	Mecha25	truebosko	depends, what graphics card do you have?
2008-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	truebosko		an amd
2008-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	truebosko		I've noticed more people have trouble with ATI cards
2008-07-27T05:46:00.000Z	truebosko		Sorry, meant to say ATI :)
2008-07-27T05:46:00.000Z	Mecha25	truebosko	good luck.  I'm on ATI, I have dual monitors working, but it took me 3 solid weeks and quite literally breaking my xorg.conf to do it
2008-07-27T05:46:00.000Z	truebosko		haha
2008-07-27T05:46:00.000Z	truebosko		:/
2008-07-27T05:46:00.000Z	truebosko		...Share your xorg? :p
2008-07-27T05:47:00.000Z	truebosko		I have two LCD's, one is bigger then the other (wide screen) .. if atleast for now I could get the resolutions correct (right now the widescreen is kind of wonky) then that'll work until I get dual working
2008-07-27T05:48:00.000Z	Mecha25	truebosko	I can give you my xorg, but part of the config is in the Catalyst Control center, and you have to reset the thing every boot.  Plus, it only works with one orientation, and with 1280x800 + 1280x1024 resolutions
2008-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	Mecha25	truebosko	to be perfectly honest, I'm STILL not sure how I got it working
2008-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	truebosko	Mecha25	ah well then it's probably best you not share and confuse me
2008-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	truebosko		haha
2008-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	truebosko		So you're using which drivers?
2008-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	Mecha25		the restricted ones, the ones that do 3d well
2008-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	truebosko		Cause I tried using the other ones...err can't remember name atm, but they made my card constantly run the fan even with nothing happening so that kind of sucked
2008-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	Mecha25		amlnxusr: you can use either gDesklets (it's in Add/Remove programs), or screenlets
2008-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	Mecha25	truebosko	envy?
2008-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	truebosko		Nah..started with an 'f'
2008-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	truebosko		(that's helpful eh?)
2008-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	Mecha25	truebosko	fglrx?
