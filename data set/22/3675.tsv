2008-08-07T11:53:00.000Z	jigp		hello how to edit the packages after copying the packages in computers?why Ubuntu will erase the packages in /var/cache/apt/archives/ ?
2008-08-07T11:54:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	what are you trying to do?
2008-08-07T11:57:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: okay here (pc im using right) ive downloaded 300+ packages and installed some applications..how to copy the 300+ packages and the applications that ive installed in pc2? and is it true that if you dont edit it it will erase?
2008-08-07T11:58:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	you want to create a local apt-mirror
2008-08-07T11:59:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: yes :) for no time hushle or time consuming..i will just copy the packages from pc1 and paste it to pc2...
2008-08-07T12:04:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	you can do just that, but it would be a bit tedious to do continuously
2008-08-07T12:07:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	copy them from one computer's archive to the other's, then when you sudo apt-get install them, it will use the version you copied
2008-08-07T12:09:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: how to copy?which directory?
2008-08-07T12:09:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives
2008-08-07T12:10:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: the packages right...what about the applications that ive installed in pc1?can i copy them and paste to pc2?
2008-08-07T12:10:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	no, you copy the packages only, then install them
2008-08-07T12:11:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	you can use the !clone feature to get all the packages installed on one computer installed on another, but that doesn't copy the packages themselves, just the names
2008-08-07T12:11:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: i got it now. :)
2008-08-07T12:12:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	I'm curious, do you have a low bandwidth cap or really slow net connection?
2008-08-07T12:13:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: slow net connection....thats why i dont want to download from the scratch again
2009-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	does that do anything pidgin can't?
2009-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: im just exploring if its possible to use ym. :)
2009-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	yahoo messenger for linux is horribly old, unless it can do some feature that pidgin can't (voice chat or file transfer), and I highly doubt that's the case, it's not going to accomplish anything
2009-02-24T09:06:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	both cairo-dock and avant-window-navigator use some gnome libraries, but both will work on kde
2009-02-24T09:07:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	: ok. nickrud ok
2009-02-24T09:07:00.000Z	jigp	crdlb	nickrud : is it possible to switch to gnome without disconnecting my net here?
2009-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	crdlb	jigp	you don't need to switch to gnome, but you can install the ubuntu-desktop package to give you a full gnome desktop (assuming you have enough HDD space)
