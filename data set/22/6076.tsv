2007-07-02T06:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	did it work?
2007-07-02T06:27:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	nope, I have a sound problem some where. Lost power this morning, and the system did a hard shut down, so I'm off to trouble shoot.
2007-07-02T06:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	is your other sound working?
2007-07-02T06:29:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	nope, I right click on my volume control, and prefrences, and I'm told no device found, looks the hard shutdown munged something?
2007-07-02T06:31:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	I just tried running Audacity, and it reported an error with the "audio i/o layer?
2007-07-02T06:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	hmm, no clue... sounds like a sound issue though, not just xchat
2007-07-02T06:31:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	Yep, got some work to do.
2007-07-02T06:33:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	Duh, I have a script file I need to run, to load the sound modules after a reboot! When you only reboot four times a year, you forget these things!
2007-07-02T06:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	lol, i take it that fixed it?
2007-07-02T06:40:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	Sorry, I was out of the room, try again and I'll tell you for sure?
2007-07-02T06:41:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	I don't know, you didn't include my nick in your last post.
2007-07-02T06:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	yes i did, you said you had to run a script when you reboot to reload sound modules
2007-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	Nope, the script ran ok, but still no sound. And I have to split for a couple hours, so I'll troubleshoot it later, thanks.
2007-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	ok.. good luck w/ it
2007-07-02T06:44:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	My CW practice program is working, so this is weird.
2007-07-02T10:20:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	You still here?
2008-01-27T10:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	why can't you?
2008-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	LTS is not available at shipit.com
2008-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	so download it.
2008-01-27T10:20:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	I have it, and I'm running it, but that isn''t the point. If I want to sell one of my email lists on LTS, shipit.com would be very easy to do, if it was available
2008-01-27T10:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	n2diy_	ok.. why can't they download it?
2008-01-27T10:22:00.000Z	n2diy_	IndyGunFreak	They are on dial up? They are lazy? Who knows what eles? Put a CD in there mailbox, and maybe they would try it?
