2006-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	Some_Person		never worked
2006-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	Some_Person		i use LILO
2006-05-30T12:13:00.000Z	Some_Person		really?
2006-05-30T12:14:00.000Z	Some_Person		ok
2006-05-30T12:14:00.000Z	Some_Person		I'm comfortable
2006-05-30T12:14:00.000Z	Some_Person		How do i do that?
2006-05-30T12:15:00.000Z	Some_Person		what lines?
2006-05-30T12:15:00.000Z	Some_Person		and where in the file?
2006-05-30T12:15:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	 why use LILO? GRUB is much easier
2006-05-30T12:20:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	 try the package manager
2006-05-30T12:21:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	<KenSentMe> try sudo dpkg -i package.deb
2006-05-30T12:23:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	 You need to run LILO after each update before you reboot or else the add-on/update won't work
2006-05-30T12:23:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	Hence why LILO is inferior to GRUB
2006-05-30T12:24:00.000Z	Some_Person	NthDegree	So I just go to Terminal and type in "sudo lilo"?
2006-05-30T12:24:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	I'm not sure, different instructions for each thing
2006-05-30T12:25:00.000Z	Some_Person	NthDegree	What do I type in Terminal?
2006-05-30T12:25:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	 I don't use LILO so I don't know
2006-05-30T12:26:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	 Why do you, you don't need the Windows MBR
2006-05-30T12:27:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	LMFAO, well does he have NSAphobia?
2006-05-30T12:28:00.000Z	NthDegree	Some_Person	Windows has backdoors made by the NSA and GRUB can do everything you need to sort out windows and Linux systems on one HDD
