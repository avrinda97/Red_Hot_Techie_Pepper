2007-05-25T10:59:00.000Z	Ralphman		Can anyone help me with an update that has gone wrong?
2007-05-25T11:01:00.000Z	Ralphman		I get  "unable to open files list file for package `php5-common': Permission denied" from apt-get when trying to upgrade anything.
2007-05-25T11:01:00.000Z	Ralphman		Any ideas?
2007-05-25T11:01:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	and you're running as root?
2007-05-25T11:02:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	hmmm...maybe try rebuilding your package list with an update, then try the upgrade again
2007-05-25T11:02:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	Thanks, tried that - update works fine.
2007-05-25T11:03:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	Still get same error with upgrade though :(
2007-05-25T11:03:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	well, obviously not too fine :-)
2007-05-25T11:03:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	have you considered cleaning out /var/cache/apt and re-updating?
2007-05-25T11:03:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	I'll give it a go....
2007-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	So, vapourize everything in /var/cache/apt?
2007-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	well, /var/cache/apt/archives to be safe
2007-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	ok.... will do
2007-05-25T11:06:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	actually, you can blow away those other two files in /var/cache/apt as well
2007-05-25T11:06:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	OK, will try....
2007-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	then just apt-get update, and upgrade
2007-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	Argh,still says the same on upgrade :(
2007-05-25T11:08:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	this may be a repository problem
2007-05-25T11:08:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	try choosing another mirror
2007-05-25T11:09:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	Many thanks for the help - will try another mirroew
2007-05-25T11:09:00.000Z	sipior	Ralphman	good luck
2007-05-25T11:38:00.000Z	Ralphman	sipior	Hi again, looks like I have a filesystem corruption around php5-common.list. Will fsck when the machine is finished doing its stuff. Many thanks again
