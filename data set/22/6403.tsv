2006-10-30T17:26:00.000Z	wsjunior	qrwam4c	i have an ati xpress 200m that just works with fglrx 8.24.8
2006-10-30T17:26:00.000Z	wsjunior	qrwam4c	it seems u need to recompile ur kernel and enable agpg
2006-10-30T17:27:00.000Z	qrwam4c	wsjunior	hmm i set it as a module
2006-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	wsjunior	qrwam4c	check it as built-in
2006-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	wsjunior	qrwam4c	and also ur chipset
2006-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	qrwam4c	wsjunior	also as build in ?

2006-10-30T17:31:00.000Z	qrwam4c	wsjunior	in that agpg should which chipset should i select ? that one from graphic card ?
2006-10-30T17:33:00.000Z	wsjunior	qrwam4c	mobo
2006-10-30T17:34:00.000Z	qrwam4c	wsjunior	hmm really so i should check the ati chipset / doh that might be a solution case i thought it had to do w/ graphic card and i only selected the ati ...
