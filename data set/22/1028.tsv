2010-11-11T13:45:00.000Z	ttocskcaj		Hey
2010-11-11T13:45:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	need help?
2010-11-11T13:46:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	that is archive
2010-11-11T13:47:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	you must open it with archive manager
2010-11-11T13:47:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	did you follow readme in it?
2010-11-11T13:47:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	open it in terminal it would tell you what is wrong
2010-11-11T13:50:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	set it +x but only executable
2010-11-11T13:51:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	type sudo chmod a+rw ~/Desktop/JD
2010-11-11T13:52:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	sudo chmod -r a+rw ~/Desktop
2010-11-11T13:53:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	or rather u+rw
2010-11-11T13:53:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	keep in mind that a+rw will allow other users to access part of your profile
2010-11-11T13:54:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	what it say
2010-11-11T13:54:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	do it in terminal
2010-11-11T13:55:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	type ./<file>
2010-11-11T13:56:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	did you open readme file? maybe it need intallation
2010-11-11T13:56:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	but you are missing that libgtk-x11-2.0.so
2010-11-11T13:57:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	now it requires libraries you do not have
2010-11-11T13:57:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	I am pretty sure it has installation manual, read it
2010-11-11T13:59:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	but linux software usually have dependencies / library which you must have to be able to use it
2010-11-11T14:04:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	why?
2010-11-11T14:05:00.000Z	ttocskcaj	petan	it's the only thing I can think of
2010-11-11T14:07:00.000Z	petan	ttocskcaj	maybe it does not know where libraries are in your system, did you recently updated something
