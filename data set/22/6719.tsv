2006-09-15T07:23:00.000Z	tyler_d		anyone know if I would be able to install all of the macromedia plugins?
2006-09-15T07:24:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	adobe/macromedia has not developed shockwave for linux, but flash 7 is available
2006-09-15T07:24:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	thanks mang
2006-09-15T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	you /can/ get shockwave and flash9 if you run firefox in wine...
2007-03-26T05:41:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	what do you mean?
2007-12-16T11:01:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	themes for what?
2007-12-16T11:03:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	window themes in gnome
2007-12-16T11:03:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	system -> preferences -> appearance
2007-12-16T11:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	downloaded a few from gnome-look but cannot install them through there... package returns errors
2007-12-16T11:04:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	do not extract the tar.gz, just drag it as a tar.gz
2007-12-16T11:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	yup
2007-12-16T11:05:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	then the tar.gz probably was not created correctly.  Open it up and look inside
2007-12-16T11:06:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	tried dl'ing a few times
2007-12-16T11:06:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	extracted as a test
2007-12-16T11:06:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	still nothing
2007-12-16T11:06:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	it's not a download issue, it's a packaging issue
2007-12-16T11:06:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	what is inside?
2007-12-16T11:07:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	ok, meaning?
2007-12-16T11:12:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	nm man, thanks for your help. appreciate the effort :)
2007-12-16T11:13:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	I meant double click on it, extract it, and tell me the list of files
2009-03-06T01:24:00.000Z	jrib	tyler_d	redirect the output to a file and copy it?
2009-03-06T01:24:00.000Z	tyler_d	jrib	initially how do I do even a simple ls -ltr on the remote host
