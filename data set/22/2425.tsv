2009-12-06T23:25:00.000Z	dooglus		my usb mouse works with the live CD that I installed from, but not when I boot from hdd.  any ideas please?
2009-12-06T23:26:00.000Z	om26er	dooglus	reboot without inserting the mouse. when desktop comes insert it. if not work poweroff and insert it in and turn on
2009-12-06T23:26:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	I booted without mouse in, then inserted it.  it didn't work.  then I booted with the live CD in and the mouse not in, then plugged the mouse in when it was up and it worked.
2009-12-06T23:26:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	so the live CD works, and the HDD install doesn't
2009-12-06T23:26:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	any ideas how to fix it?
2009-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	any ideas how to fix it?
2009-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	om26er	dooglus	no bug let me google
2009-12-06T23:29:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	what do you mean, it's not a bug?  I think it must be...
2009-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	my phone and some of my memory sticks don't work from HDD boot but do from LiveCD boot, too
2009-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	om26er	dooglus	strange
2009-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	om26er	dooglus	if you can i suggest you to install ubuntu again
2009-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	om26er	dooglus	a clean install
2009-12-06T23:32:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	"a clean install" - what do you mean?  that sentence no verb
2009-12-06T23:32:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	sorry, I didn't see the previous line
2009-12-06T23:36:00.000Z	om26er	dooglus	type lsusb in terminal
2009-12-06T23:36:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	ok
2009-12-06T23:36:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	the mouse is still working
2009-12-06T23:36:00.000Z	om26er	dooglus	in the live cd or installation?
2009-12-06T23:37:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	it works in the live cd and doesn't in the installation
2009-12-06T23:37:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	so I'm using the live cd
2009-12-06T23:37:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	(actually a live USB stick, but I doubt that's significant)
2009-12-06T23:42:00.000Z	dooglus	om26er	I'm going to try upgrading the live CD and see if that breaks it like my install is broken
