2010-12-30T11:54:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	do you have a booting problem?
2010-12-30T11:55:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	Yes, i'm trying to get ubuntu to load from an external hard drive's second partition
2010-12-30T11:56:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	can your run this script and pastebin the generated text file.http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2010-12-30T12:15:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	so whats the symptoms of your boot problem, I missed the actual description, i have looked at the script.
2010-12-30T12:18:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	you have the sdb first to read in the bios correct?
2010-12-30T12:20:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	I cant seem to get the right setting for USB in the bios, however I've just been going to boot options and choosing it each time
2010-12-30T12:21:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	what is the dell utility in sdb1
2010-12-30T12:22:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	To be honest I have no idea, I assume a second recovery partition.
2010-12-30T12:22:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	Dell has a dell data safe program that messes with the mbr does this sound familiar
2010-12-30T12:23:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	Nah, i've never heard of it.
2010-12-30T12:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	can you boot sda and get to W7 or the wubi,
2010-12-30T12:25:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	did the external ever boot correctly with this install
2010-12-30T12:25:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	Nope, its been doing that since the install a few hours ago
2010-12-30T12:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	boot into windows admin and go to the control panel add-remove and look for dell data safe. It is strange that a external HD would have a fat 16 dell utility partion=sdb1
2010-12-30T12:30:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	I miss read the script the dell utility is sda1. I think that having Ubuntu half way onto a teraabyte usb drive is probably not fgong to work
2010-12-30T12:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	you could move the wubi to a partion on the sda if you wanted and dual boot easily.
2010-12-30T12:33:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	I'm not looking to dual boot. The wubi install is seeming kind of buggy anyway. Instead I'll just brute force change the partitions around I guess.
2010-12-30T12:34:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	 would just do a full install of Ubuntu on a 8 gig or larger thumb, it would run faster
2010-12-30T12:36:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	 Hmm, that would make it alot easier. As I could  just keep that second partition in the same format and use it as extra space I guess.
2010-12-30T12:37:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	yeah just a suggestion.:)
2010-12-30T12:38:00.000Z	nit-wit	Benwacki	use the cutom install though so you have grub pointed correctly=mbr of thumb. Sounds like you may know this though.
2010-12-30T12:40:00.000Z	Benwacki	nit-wit	Thanks, I'm a bit new to actually messing with grub outside of one experience dual booting a few years back
