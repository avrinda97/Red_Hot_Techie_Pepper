2008-09-06T07:59:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	ping -c 2 192.168.1.1
2008-09-06T08:01:00.000Z	kbd	jgedeon	coming up
2008-09-06T08:03:00.000Z	kbd	jgedeon	joejoecircusboy ; previously, eth1 was static instead of dhcp, and everything there was uncommented
2008-09-06T08:05:00.000Z	kbd	jgedeon	correct
2008-09-06T08:06:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	does your router show logs or current connections?
2008-09-06T08:08:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	try to ping -I eth1 -c 2 192.168.1.1

2008-09-06T08:19:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	does /etc/init.d/ufw restart work?
2008-09-06T08:20:00.000Z	kbd	jgedeon	nein :(
2008-09-06T08:29:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	that is personal preference.
2008-09-06T08:30:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	I personally use IPtables and FWBuilder to edit them with an Untangle Gateway to my home network.
2008-09-06T08:33:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	you corrected that.  It is fine.
2008-09-06T08:34:00.000Z	kbd	jgedeon	did you see the error msg for that?
2008-09-06T08:34:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	what error?
2008-09-06T08:36:00.000Z	kbd	jgedeon	when I restarted ufw, http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/43805/
2008-09-06T08:36:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	yes.  you can apt-get remove --purge ufw and then apt-get install ufw if you want.
2008-09-06T08:37:00.000Z	jgedeon	kbd	I thought we were talking about your /etc/networkj/interfaces file
