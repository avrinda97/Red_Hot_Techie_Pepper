2006-11-20T17:19:00.000Z	Zambezi		Which is the best tool to erase DVDRW in Ubuntu? K3B, Gnomebaker doesn't erase the DVD at all.
2006-11-20T09:34:00.000Z	Zambezi		How do I configure the networkssettings in the terminal? I totally forgot and don't have a clue where to begin to look.
2006-11-20T09:35:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	ifconfig
2006-11-20T09:40:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	if you have DHCP you can connect with dhclient <interface-name>
2006-11-20T09:42:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	It's fine now, but not on the temporary connection which is another place then at home.
2006-11-20T09:43:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	I see.  the quick and dirty way to put an ip address on a network interface is just ifconfig <interface-name> <ip-address> netmask <netmask>
2006-11-20T09:44:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	then type route add default gw <default gateway ip adddress>
2006-11-20T09:45:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	That's the way I prefer, but how to write it is something I'm unsure off.
2006-11-20T09:45:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	Can you take it again in PM?
2006-11-20T09:46:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	Thanks.
2006-11-20T09:46:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	I'm pm'ing you now.
2006-11-20T09:50:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	it's all there in the PM are you still here?
2006-11-20T09:51:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	or are you not getting the messages because I'm forgetting something?
2006-11-20T09:51:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	I get them.
2006-11-20T09:52:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	Sorry. Hold a minute.
2006-11-20T09:52:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	so those commands will change your ip address temporarily, but they'll be wiped out when you reboot
2006-11-20T09:53:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	I need to register the name with the password. Just hold until I can find the note.
2006-11-20T09:53:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	/msg nickserv register <user-name>
2006-11-20T09:54:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	/msg nickserv identify <password>
2006-11-20T09:58:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	/join #fkf9f0f0fkffjfkjf
2006-11-20T09:59:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Zambezi	I'm getting an error message when I do that, why don't we just pm I just saw your last message
2006-11-20T10:00:00.000Z	Zambezi	rickyfingers	I can't for some reason. Did you get my "testmessages?"
