2005-08-27T07:16:00.000Z	dicrapi1		hello, i installed ubuntu today and while everything went fine, i just noticed that everytime i log out i cant log in, it just hangs ,wondering if anyone else seen the same
2005-08-27T07:17:00.000Z	mae	dicrapi1	have you tried doing in a console as root -> "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade"
2005-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	dicrapi1	mae	all is up to date
2005-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	mae	dicrapi1	i see. well try (ctrl-alt-backspace) to restart the x server. and try loggin in again
2005-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	dicrapi1		tried that and nothing either
2005-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	mae		hmm
2005-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	dicrapi1		is really weird
2005-08-27T07:19:00.000Z	dicrapi1		never seen that before
2005-08-27T07:19:00.000Z	mae	dicrapi1	does it freeze at the gnome splash screen?
2005-08-27T07:19:00.000Z	dicrapi1		well it hangs before the splash
2005-08-27T07:19:00.000Z	dicrapi1		so i dont get to c the splash
2005-08-27T07:19:00.000Z	mae	dicrapi1	whole machine locks up, or just x
2005-08-27T07:20:00.000Z	dicrapi1		X
2005-08-27T07:20:00.000Z	mae	dicrapi1	maybe your X video card driver is buggy.. try editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf and changing the "driver" under the device section to "vesa"
2005-08-27T07:20:00.000Z	mae		thats the most generic failsafe way to start x
2005-08-27T07:21:00.000Z	dicrapi1		nah is good, heres the thing, if i turn the copmputer on everything goes well, i get gdm, login and everything seems fine
2005-08-27T07:21:00.000Z	mae		then your gonna have to do a /etc/init.d/gdm restart as root
2005-08-27T07:21:00.000Z	dicrapi1		is when i logout after that and try to log back in
2005-08-27T07:21:00.000Z	dicrapi1		so is not the card at all
2005-08-27T07:22:00.000Z	mae	dicrapi1	you can't say that for sure.. perhaps you should peruse the xorg logs
2005-08-27T07:22:00.000Z	dicrapi1		i guess
2005-08-27T07:22:00.000Z	mae	dicrapi1	i have an engagement look in the logs, if that  doesn't tell you anything try ubuntu forums and/or wiki/mailing lists
