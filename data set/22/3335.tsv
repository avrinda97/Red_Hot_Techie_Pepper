2009-06-14T21:07:00.000Z	pronoy		hi i am unable to find the .deb package for songbird... is there a repo for intrepid which includes this amazing software ?
2009-06-14T21:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 i just use the binaried from the songbird homepage. (i only install it for a single user, not the whole system)
2009-06-19T00:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 you ould remove it.. but i doubt if that will 'fix' anything..  try running it from a terminal. look for error messages.. you could some how reset all the gedit settings perhaps. It may be some messed up config/setting
2009-06-19T00:46:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	it runs eventually using the gui but it takes lots of time and also hangs in between the loading
2009-06-19T00:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 try terminal.. look for error.info messages.. Personally i use geany not gedit.
2009-07-12T11:14:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	try a cheating fiance :)
2009-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 nope.. never used it.. :)
2009-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	its the best network vulnerability scanner out there !!!!!!!!
2009-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 so? :) my network is a whole 3 pc's
2009-07-14T05:43:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	understanding a network requires knowledge of how it works...enter nessus
2009-07-14T05:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 nah - networks are all about the fat pipes! :P
2009-07-14T05:44:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	ok but question still stands
2009-10-24T18:37:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	that's strange...
2009-10-24T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 not really. from what i recall reading the Person in charge of 'tor packages' for ubuntu  had other things to do and  theres no longer a maintainer. thus its gone.
2009-10-24T18:38:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	lulz
2009-11-07T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 it you mean the 'current working directory' its depends on how you are launching the terminal.
2009-11-07T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 the prompt just shows the current directory
2009-11-07T17:48:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	yeah, but in intrepid it used to originate at /home/username
2009-11-07T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 it still does here.. so its how  you are launching it...
2009-11-07T17:52:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	when i launch it using the applications menu the prompt is at ~ but when i use it by a custom keyboard shortcut it doesn't
2009-11-07T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronoy	 the launcher  process is starting in / then. so  make the thing launch gnome-terminal 'some option here to be in whatever dir you want'
2009-11-07T17:59:00.000Z	pronoy	Dr_Willis	hey it worked i used the --working-directory=~ and it worked thanks for the advice
