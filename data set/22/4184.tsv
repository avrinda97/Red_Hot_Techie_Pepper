2011-07-13T02:30:00.000Z	untermensch		Can anyone explain to me why chromium will not pin in my Unity toolbar?
2011-07-13T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	run it, then right click and select 'keep in launcher', does that not work?
2011-07-13T02:33:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	even when I'm running Chrome (now for instance) it doesn't show up in Unity.
2011-07-13T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	which version are you running?
2011-07-13T02:34:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	I have no clue. How might I find out?
2011-07-13T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	apt-cache policy chromium-browser
2011-07-13T02:35:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	Installed: 12.0.742.112~r90304-0ubuntu0.11.04.1
2011-07-13T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	is it running now? does it show in:  ps -ef | grep chromi
2011-07-13T02:37:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	It is running yes.
2011-07-13T02:37:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	Several times over. which is odd since I only have one window open
2011-07-13T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	kill them all, then restart a new one afresh
2011-07-13T02:42:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	I killed them all, and started a new session. Still not showing up on the toolbar
2011-07-13T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	does it happen as all users?
2011-07-13T02:46:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	this is my only user, so i would assume yes.
2011-07-13T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	make a new one to test
2011-07-13T02:50:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	got it working. thank you :)
2011-07-13T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	sweet
2011-07-13T02:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	is it working as the original user, or the new user?
2011-07-13T02:52:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	I felt lucky, so I just logged back in as my original user, and it works fine now
2011-07-13T02:53:00.000Z	untermensch	ActionParsnip	started up, i could pin it to the toolbar, and it has an icon (the last time it would stay on the toolbar it was just black where the icon should've been)
2011-07-13T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	sweet, always nice
2011-07-13T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	untermensch	If you add the daily build ppa you wil get nice beta features ;)
