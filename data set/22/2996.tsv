2009-02-05T04:38:00.000Z	kaveh		i have nvidia graphic card what is the best driver to insall
2009-02-05T04:39:00.000Z	kaveh		what i am suppose to do
2009-02-05T04:39:00.000Z	CetiEel	kaveh	just install the proprietary driver?
2009-02-05T04:39:00.000Z	CetiEel		should appear an icon asking if you want it installed
2009-02-05T04:40:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	i installed ubuntu right now but it seems to lack in driver
2009-02-05T04:41:00.000Z	CetiEel	kaveh	weird. For me there is always an "install proprietary driver" icon appearing in the menu right after an install. I also hava an nvidia card
2009-02-05T04:41:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	in menu?
2009-02-05T04:42:00.000Z	CetiEel	kaveh	if you use gnome it should be up there in the upper menu far right
2009-02-05T04:43:00.000Z	CetiEel	kaveh	I guess you can also search for "nvidia" in synaptic and manually install it
2009-02-05T04:43:00.000Z	kaveh		i dont see it
2009-02-05T04:43:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	i am upgrading
2009-02-05T04:44:00.000Z	CetiEel	kaveh	is it a brand new card or some older model?
2009-02-05T04:45:00.000Z	kaveh		i see shutdown icon , then time ,then volume , then network
2009-02-05T04:45:00.000Z	CetiEel		usually nvidia cards seem to work woithout problems as far as i know
2009-02-05T04:45:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	new card
2009-02-05T04:46:00.000Z	CetiEel		well, I suggest you do a search in synaptic for "nvidia" and there will probably be some driver packages there you can try installing if the proprietary driver icon does not show up
2009-02-05T04:47:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	it is nvidia 8200
2009-02-05T04:48:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	i might need to upgrade
2009-02-05T04:49:00.000Z	CetiEel		upgrade what, kaveh?
2009-02-05T04:49:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	the system
2009-02-05T04:49:00.000Z	kaveh	CetiEel	i restart now see what happens
