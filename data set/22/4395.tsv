2008-08-13T16:32:00.000Z	sledgeas		is there an existing method of how to install linux (ubuntu) on a completely remote computer, currently running windows home+vnc server ?
2008-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sledgeas	you can in a VM box
2008-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sledgeas	but if you want it native, vnc wont be running when you reboot
2008-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	sledgeas	ActionParsnip	and how do i put it on a dedicated partition afterwards?
2008-08-13T16:34:00.000Z	sledgeas	ActionParsnip	that's why i ask. i need some modified ubuntu installation
2008-08-13T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sledgeas	get the alternative cd and you can do it all from ssh

2008-08-13T16:41:00.000Z	sledgeas	ActionParsnip	i want native install and i cannot physically approach the machine
2008-08-13T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sledgeas	then you're screwed as you need to put a cd in the system to boot to the command environment dont you
2008-08-13T16:42:00.000Z	sledgeas	ActionParsnip	i'm not about CD:http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-28948.html
2008-08-13T16:42:00.000Z	sledgeas	ActionParsnip	 wols_ knows how to ssh already, so im waiting for his solution
2008-08-13T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sledgeas	ive not used grub for NT, sorry
2009-11-26T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sledgeas	when it hangs, can you restart the x server?
2009-11-26T14:49:00.000Z	sledgeas	ActionParsnip	no, keyboard and mouse disact
2009-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sledgeas	can you ssh in?
2009-11-26T14:51:00.000Z	sledgeas	ActionParsnip	this i do not know (the problem is that it is a remote box of my Joe Linux User-friends :} i will try to ask them to try to ssh into it :)
