2005-02-18T06:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	almost certainly... not I , though...

2005-02-18T06:55:00.000Z	leggolaas	thoreauputic	I dont blame you , but it's for a client of mine
2005-02-18T07:08:00.000Z	leggolaas	thoreauputic	dude I take it ndiswrapper isnt very popular , since the #ndiswrapper room is dormant
2005-02-18T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	I don't know, frankly - I don't know anything much about ndiswrapper except that it gets discussed in #debian a fair bit - but I wouldn't go there if you are thin-skinned ;)
2005-02-18T07:12:00.000Z	leggolaas	thoreauputic	:) thank you dude
2005-02-18T07:13:00.000Z	leggolaas	thoreauputic	do they shoot it down over there ? :)
2005-02-18T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	#debian is an interesting spectatorblood sport, if you enjoy that kind of thing ;)
2005-02-18T07:14:00.000Z	leggolaas	thoreauputic	ahhh I learnt how to swear , would that help :)
2005-02-18T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	lots of clued people though - I learnt much there :)
2005-02-18T07:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	no, you needto speak fluent bash and awk ;)
2005-02-18T07:15:00.000Z	leggolaas	thoreauputic	lol
2005-02-18T07:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	that would get you brownie points for sure ;)

2005-02-18T07:17:00.000Z	leggolaas	thoreauputic	how do they take to ubuntu /? it's GNU !
2005-02-18T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	varies. Some are pro, but some just repeat "Ubuntu is not Debian!" ad nauseam...
2005-02-18T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	bad case of "not invented here" , seems to me, although Ubuntu *is*off-topic, so they have a point
2005-02-18T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	not atm
2005-02-18T07:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	leggolaas	BTW, if you say "room" in #debian, you get flamed :)
