2008-02-17T15:25:00.000Z	Somenick-		Sure, Trel, i was just trying to know the people preference
2008-02-17T15:25:00.000Z	Somenick-		I see
2008-02-17T15:26:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	most people here use gnome is my guess ... try both.  i use kde
2008-02-17T15:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	you can have both installed
2008-02-17T15:29:00.000Z	Somenick-	prince_jammys	how?
2008-02-17T15:30:00.000Z	Somenick-		I'm actually using KDE
2008-02-17T15:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop ... when you first do it your menus will have a ton of stuff . you can then edit the K menu and the gnome menu so you can have whatever you want in each
2008-02-17T15:33:00.000Z	Somenick-	prince_jammys	oh! thanks buddy, I will enjoy this, be sure hehehe
2008-02-17T15:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	i did it the other way around, started with gnome, ended up with kde
2008-02-17T15:34:00.000Z	Somenick-	prince_jammys	KDE have a more, friendly interface (I think it)
2008-02-17T15:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	kde just has more extra stuff -- configure this, configure that ... open a terminal in the text editor, open  a terminal in the browser ... some people don't like all the features
2008-02-17T15:37:00.000Z	Somenick-		I got, prince_jammys, if I would create a server, I certainly would use gnome. But for my desktop, I still prefer all of those stuff
2008-02-17T15:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	yeah i like it
2008-02-17T15:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	do you do terminal stuff or mostly gui?
2008-02-17T15:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	try    "yakuake" if you don't already have it
2008-02-17T15:39:00.000Z	Somenick-		Almost every time that I spend here is on terminal
2008-02-17T15:39:00.000Z	Somenick-		Yakuake? hm, i'll try
2008-02-17T15:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	sudo apt-get install yakuake <------ love it
2008-02-17T15:40:00.000Z	Somenick-		At this time, i'm using another distro, but no my ubuntu, i'll test hehehe
2008-02-17T15:41:00.000Z	Somenick-	prince_jammys	I'm having alot of problems with configure scripts "cannot comput sizeof...", you know what lib could be missing?
2008-02-17T15:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Somenick-	no, sorry
2008-02-17T15:41:00.000Z	Somenick-	prince_jammys	thanks anyway
