2009-09-18T15:19:00.000Z	z-tau		can someone tell me why my /proc/kcore is 256 terabytes?  I sure don't have that much memory
2009-09-18T15:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	its probaly measured in bits so giving you 256Mb
2009-09-18T15:21:00.000Z	z-tau		the size of the file according to ls -l is 281474974621696 bytes

2009-09-18T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	i have 2gb ram there
2009-09-18T15:23:00.000Z	z-tau		!tab
2009-09-18T15:24:00.000Z	z-tau	ActionParsnip	i thought /proc/kcore is supposed to reflect the amount of memory installed?
2009-09-18T15:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	not sure. try sudo lshw | less
2009-09-18T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	sudo lshw -C memory

2009-09-18T15:27:00.000Z	z-tau	ActionParsnip	I'm on another machine atm so i can't paste results back here but I have 6GiB installed there if that's what you want to know
2009-09-18T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	or: sudo lshw -C memory | grep size | pastebinit
2009-09-18T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	no, just telling you how you can get the system to tell you
2009-09-18T15:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	i sugest you install patebinit, its small and very useful
2009-09-18T15:29:00.000Z	z-tau	ActionParsnip	All i'm actually trying to do is dump all my system memory to a file.. I tried dd if=/dev/core of=/media/blah/core.img (/dev/core is a symlink to /proc/kcore) but it just kept on saving past when i expected it to stop
2009-09-18T15:29:00.000Z	z-tau	ActionParsnip	the 256 TB size of kcore explains that lol, i just want to be sure i saved all memory to the image file
2009-09-18T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	i think its /dev/mem  not sure
2009-09-18T15:30:00.000Z	z-tau	ActionParsnip	i can't access /dev/mem, doesn't work
2009-09-18T15:31:00.000Z	z-tau		i see your typing zoeymarie :p
2009-09-18T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	z-tau	may help: http://linux.die.net/man/4/mem
