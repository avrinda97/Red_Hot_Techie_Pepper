2008-11-26T20:53:00.000Z	berhane_zion		Hi everyone, im gonna ask some utterly noobish question, if you feel its to stupid, don't bother answering :)
2008-11-26T20:53:00.000Z	berhane_zion		how to i get to show the filepath as a visible column when searching for files
2008-11-26T20:54:00.000Z	berhane_zion		in the option visible columns, there are only like name, size, type and other stuff i dont understand
2008-11-26T20:54:00.000Z	berhane_zion		but no filepath
2008-11-26T20:55:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	folder?
2008-11-26T20:56:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	the folder column is the path
2008-11-26T20:59:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	just had a spammer come through
2008-11-26T20:59:00.000Z	berhane_zion	cwillu	folder is not on the list, only name, size, type, date modified, date accessed, group, MIME type, octal permissions, owner, permissions and SELinux context
2008-11-26T20:59:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	where/how are you searching?
2008-11-26T21:00:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	the location is shown above, everything there is in the current folder
2008-11-26T21:00:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	click the pencil/paper icon to change it to a text field instead of path buttons
2008-11-26T21:01:00.000Z	berhane_zion	cwillu	i searched the whole filesystem, so all results are in root ? i expected it to search subfolders too, doesn't it do that ?
2008-11-26T21:01:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	how did you get to that search?
2008-11-26T21:02:00.000Z	berhane_zion	cwillu	i opened the filebrowser, and in the toolbar on the top there is a button 'search'
2008-11-26T21:03:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	my bad.  Places | search has a folders field, I'll poke at nautilus a bit and see if I can find something else
2008-11-26T21:04:00.000Z	berhane_zion	cwillu	oh, i see, i could just use the places | search for files-function
2008-11-26T21:04:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	yep.  The nautilus missing the folder name is probably a bug of some description;
2008-11-26T21:05:00.000Z	berhane_zion	cwillu	ok, thx, don't sweat it about nautilus, i will just use that search function for now
2008-11-26T21:05:00.000Z	berhane_zion	cwillu	i only started using ubuntu yesterday, so this will do for now
2008-11-26T21:08:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	that was the spammer I mentioned before
2008-11-26T21:10:00.000Z	cwillu	berhane_zion	seems reasonable :p
2008-11-26T21:10:00.000Z	berhane_zion	cwillu	what seams reasonable ?
