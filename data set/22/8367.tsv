2005-11-01T14:20:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	exactly.
2005-11-01T14:20:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	who cares? I've got quake4 installed on this beast
2005-11-01T14:20:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	yeah, CS:S runs just fine
2005-11-01T14:21:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	I've no complaints about it. its slower than windows native, sure. but who needs anti-aliasing when you're a CAL player?
2005-11-01T14:22:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	ignore the reviews. its a great game, I'd give it a solid 9/10
2005-11-01T14:23:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	I don't know if you'd notice the difference or not, but having the polygon hit system in Q4 instead of hitboxes is a joy
2005-11-01T14:23:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	its like my favorite feature of the Doom3 engine, bar none
2005-11-01T14:24:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	wrong. it doesn't use them. Carmack implemented a per polygon hit system, not hitboxes. you shoot it, you hit it. none of this lagbox nonsense like HL2
2005-11-01T14:25:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	I was rather pleased with Jedi Academy, played that like a whore
2005-11-01T14:25:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	<--- dual sabers for life!
2005-11-01T14:26:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	darn skippy!
2005-11-01T14:26:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	yeah, its too short, but the multiplayer duel mode made up for that
2005-11-01T14:27:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	LOL
2005-11-01T14:43:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	its not a bloody emulator, its an implementation
2005-11-01T14:43:00.000Z	socketbind	adriyel__	sry adriyel, it's dynamic recompilation or what, I know it's far from emulation
2005-11-01T14:44:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	no, its an implementation of Windows API's on Linux
2005-11-01T14:44:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	it is inherently inefficient, because of the nature of it. But its not an emulation or an interpreter in the truest sense
2005-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	socketbind	adriyel__	well I'm not english and I couldn't find the best word for it, sry, I know what you mean
2005-11-01T14:45:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	its cool, your english is fine. better than most American's (where I am) english anyways
2005-11-01T14:46:00.000Z	socketbind	adriyel__	:) thx I hope I get it improved soon because my grammar totally sux:D
2005-11-01T14:46:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	bah. utter crap, your grammar is fine
2005-11-01T14:46:00.000Z	adriyel__	socketbind	you don't understand, the current state of education in the department of English in American schools really sucks right now
