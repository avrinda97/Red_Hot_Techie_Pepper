2009-09-11T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	have you set the server to be view only or fully interactive?
2009-09-11T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	i'm sure theres a more graceful way to do what you want to do
2009-09-11T16:25:00.000Z	Munna	ActionParsnip	i dont know how to do fuly interactive
2009-09-11T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	vnc has 2 modes, check yours is running right. i dont use vnc due to it being massively excessive
2009-09-11T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	if you are only controlling torrents of updating the system then ssh or a torrent web interface will do the task more gracefully
2009-09-11T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	so why do you need the entire desktop?
2009-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	Munna	ActionParsnip	? 0_o
2009-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	if you tab complete my name it will highlight as I am highlighting yours
2009-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	what tasks are you performing once in vnc ? what is the purpose of the connection
2009-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	Munna	ActionParsnip	it is to test security defects
2009-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	in vnc do you mean?
2009-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	Munna	ActionParsnip	but the mouse thingie wont work
2009-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	Munna	ActionParsnip	yes
2009-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	you need to set the server you are using to be interactive
2009-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	Munna	ActionParsnip	in the ubuntu chanel
2009-09-11T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	check the settings of the server app, it wil have an option to allow it
2009-09-11T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	try a different vnc server app
2009-09-11T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Munna	see if it only affects that app, or if its a broader issue
