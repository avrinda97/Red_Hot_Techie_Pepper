2012-11-17T03:52:00.000Z	designbybeck		hmmm
2012-11-17T03:53:00.000Z	designbybeck		I was hoping to see the desktop so I could just keep things open ActionParsnip, does it not work like that
2012-11-17T03:53:00.000Z	designbybeck		To remote into?
2012-11-17T03:53:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	NX is a great snappy way to remote desktop
2012-11-17T03:54:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	If you install freeNX (you can get it at nomachine.org) it'll be accessible over the SSH port
2012-11-17T03:54:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	I'd recommend you use their older 3.x branch rather than the new 4.x
2012-11-17T03:54:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	The link is buried but it's worth it - faster.
2012-11-17T03:55:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	 so just the 3.5v NX Free Edition for Linux ?
2012-11-17T03:57:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	one important trick - if you want to be able to login using your unix user/pass edit /usr/NX/etc/server.cfg and make sure "EnableUserDB" and "EnablePassDB" are both 0
2012-11-17T03:58:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	congrats, you can now access your machine via shell, remote desktop, and file sharing  over a secure, encrypted connection all on the same port :)
2012-11-17T04:04:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	http://www.pasteall.org/37290
2012-11-17T04:05:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	 i installed 'sudo apt-get install ssh'
2012-11-17T04:10:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	 do I have to start the process?
2012-11-17T04:10:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	sudo /usr/NX/bin/nxserver --start
2012-11-17T04:11:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	 i got that same error
2012-11-17T04:11:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	 my SSH not configured correctly?
2012-11-17T04:43:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	 I don't think I got NX setup correctly though
2012-11-17T04:43:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	awesome!
2012-11-17T04:43:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	I found this while you were gone http://readlist.com/lists/kde.org/freenx-knx/0/2581.html
2012-11-17T04:54:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	IT WORKED!!!! I logged into my desktop at work from home!!! Awesome! Thanks guys!
2012-11-17T04:55:00.000Z	ShinyObjects1	designbybeck	- I first used NX because VMWare Server's remote desktop was so slow... I'd NX in to the machine and run VMWare Server's  remote display and connect it to itsself...
2012-11-17T04:56:00.000Z	designbybeck	ShinyObjects1	 I did have to use NM4 because 3.5 didn't met dependencies
