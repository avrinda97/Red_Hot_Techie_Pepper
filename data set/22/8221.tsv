2006-01-25T11:30:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		anyway.
2006-01-25T11:30:00.000Z	_jason	bluefoxicy	do you realize ubotu is a bot?
2006-01-25T11:31:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 yes, a useless one right now.
2006-02-23T11:00:00.000Z	_jason	bluefoxicy	I haven't seen that particular one but there are similar ones with the same people, so probably
2006-02-23T11:00:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 they're naked!
2006-02-23T11:00:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 I mean I found pictures of their bare asses too
2006-02-23T11:01:00.000Z	_jason	bluefoxicy	install the ubuntu-calendar packages and you'll get a bunch
2006-02-23T11:05:00.000Z	_jason	bluefoxicy	that picture is 'october', now you know why ubuntu was nicknamed the porn distro after its first release
2006-02-23T11:06:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 speaking of porn, those pictures are highly suggestive.
2006-02-23T11:07:00.000Z	_jason	bluefoxicy	of?
2006-02-23T11:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 in the one I showed the guy is clearly thinking something.  Not sure what but I'm thinking it might start with "butt" and end with "Sex"
2006-02-23T11:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 and involve a naked black chick he's got his hands all over.
2006-02-23T11:07:00.000Z	_jason	bluefoxicy	heh I guess that's why they discontinued them
2006-02-23T11:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 aww, not going to take the series out to completion?  :P
2006-02-23T11:08:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 it could be worse, we could see each release accompanied with furry porn.
2006-02-23T11:08:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 "Ubuntu Frisky Foxgirl!"
2006-02-23T11:08:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 I move "Frisky Foxgirl" be the title for 6.10 :)
2006-02-23T11:09:00.000Z	_jason	bluefoxicy	heh
2006-02-23T11:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 I always thought Ubuntu should stop using flat colors and crap for their CD labels when you order pressed CDs, and actually put animals on them.  :O
2006-02-23T11:13:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	_jason	 http://ubuntulinux.jp/wiki/ArtWorksFolder/Ubuntu-tan_01-1280x1024.jpg  Apparently you guys do lolicon too.
