2008-07-13T10:20:00.000Z	pteeb		i have a gtk theme folder, with the images and gtkrc file, how do i load it?
2008-07-13T10:22:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	is it a tarball?
2008-07-13T10:22:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	if so, you can just drag n drop it into the system -> preferences -> appearance thing
2008-07-13T10:23:00.000Z	pteeb	maco	it isnt a tarball :( thats the problem
2008-07-13T10:23:00.000Z	pteeb	maco	i have a folder with images, gtkrc and .rc files, how do i compile?
2008-07-13T10:24:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	then drop the whole directory into ~/.themes, i think
2008-07-13T10:24:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	no compiling involved
2008-07-13T10:24:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	they're just config files.  they're read plaintext, like any other config file
2008-07-13T10:24:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	~ means your home drive
2008-07-13T10:24:00.000Z	pteeb	maco	i dont have that folder  think
2008-07-13T10:25:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	anything starting with a dot is hidden
2008-07-13T10:26:00.000Z	pteeb	maco	i put it in there but its not getting recognized by the Appearence dialog
2008-07-13T10:27:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	how did you put it in?
2008-07-13T10:27:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	mine has directories with the names of the themes
2008-07-13T10:28:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	 and inside each of those directories is the index.theme and a directory
2008-07-13T10:28:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	pteeb ok thats in the right place
2008-07-13T10:29:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	ah the index.theme is just a thing telling it what to show in the appearance dialog, i think
2008-07-13T10:30:00.000Z	pteeb	maco	still its not there :(
2008-07-13T10:33:00.000Z	pteeb	maco	the index.theme is in the folder, but its still not getting recognized by the dialog
2008-07-13T10:33:00.000Z	maco	pteeb	.themes/ThemeName/index.theme ?
