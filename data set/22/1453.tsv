2011-08-21T23:44:00.000Z	abhi_69		i made a custom ubuntu 11.04 distro to share with my frnds
2011-08-21T23:44:00.000Z	abhi_69		i want to test it before distribute among my frnds
2011-08-21T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	please don't discuss that in here
2011-08-21T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	this channel is only for ubuntu support
2012-04-27T11:07:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	can you not see the error in that paste ?
2012-04-27T11:08:00.000Z	abhi_69	ikonia	yes, i can see, but can't understand what to do?
2012-04-27T11:08:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	what have you done ?
2012-04-27T11:08:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	ok, so the error is "no such file or directory" what's the first thing that's worth checking ?
2012-04-27T11:11:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	think about it, the error is no such file......what do you need to check
2012-04-27T11:12:00.000Z	abhi_69	ikonia	okey, here it is, i can access file/folders from nautilus when i open them via 'open with files' menu option
2012-04-27T11:12:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	not what I asked
2012-04-27T11:12:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	think about the first thing you need to check, the error is "directory not found"
2012-04-27T11:13:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	please listen to what I'm saying
2012-04-27T11:13:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	the error is "cannot open directory" - what do you think the first thin you need to check is ?
2012-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	I told you what to do
2012-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	the error is "directory is missing" check if it's actually there
2012-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	abhi_69	ikonia	i already do that
2012-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	did what ?
2012-04-27T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	I have no idea why you are doing this, the error is clear, "directory is missing"
2012-04-27T13:38:00.000Z	abhi_69	ikonia	now i'm getting new error, only a single line error while trying to access them, that is: seg fault (core dumped)
2012-04-27T13:38:00.000Z	ikonia	abhi_69	no idea, you'd need to analyise the core which is a very complex process
