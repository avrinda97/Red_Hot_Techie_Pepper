2008-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	dev1n		but it hang for 20+ mins loading the kernel
2008-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	dev1n		think it's bad ram or what?
2008-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	dev1n		there's about 8 gigs free on it
2008-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	dev1n		ok, what does f6 do?
2008-02-23T09:06:00.000Z	dev1n		dsmith, are you suddgesting hitting F6 instead of F12
2008-02-23T09:08:00.000Z	dev1n		yep, the progress bar get's to 100% loading the kernel...and then it hangs there.
2008-02-23T09:08:00.000Z	dev1n		so i should hit F6 then?
2008-02-23T09:08:00.000Z	dev1n		what does it do?
2008-02-23T09:10:00.000Z	dev1n		i'm going to try getting out of a GUI hang with F6, but i'm still wondering what it does...or is supposed to do.
2008-02-23T09:12:00.000Z	dev1n		ok, cool dsmith...what is booting verbosely?
2008-02-23T09:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dev1n	verbosely is when you set you it so that all the messages show up as you boot
2008-02-23T09:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dev1n	rather than a logo splash screen
2008-02-23T09:13:00.000Z	dev1n		ok, so i should hit f6 when?
2008-02-23T09:13:00.000Z	dev1n		after it hangs?
2008-02-23T09:14:00.000Z	dev1n		or earlier...when i select the CD to boot from
