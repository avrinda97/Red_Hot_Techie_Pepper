2006-06-03T08:55:00.000Z	monomaniacpat		Two questions about upgrading to dapper from breezy...
2006-06-03T08:55:00.000Z	monomaniacpat		Does the update manager method work now?
2006-06-03T08:56:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	maybe ... ;)
2006-06-03T08:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	have a live cd about in case it breaks
2006-06-03T08:57:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	so that's a no?
2006-06-03T08:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	it broke for me - reinstall
2006-07-02T14:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	cd protection schemes
2006-07-02T14:35:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	anything I can do about it?
2006-07-02T14:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	check wine's appdb - there's 2 options afaik - either get a crack, or mount a virtual cd copy with cdemu
2006-07-02T14:37:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	what should I do exactly? where's the app database?
2006-07-02T14:41:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	any ideas what I'm looking for exactly? what should I search for?
2006-07-02T14:47:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	what should I be searching for on the wine appdb?
2006-07-02T14:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	plug in the name of your app - it will show if the app is supported, & how to get it to run
2006-07-02T16:19:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	told me about the appdb but I don't know what to look for
2006-07-05T08:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	best to search & find a best match, & add your comments
2006-07-06T08:56:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	which themes?
2006-07-06T08:56:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	most of them
2006-07-06T08:57:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	for example: is clearlooks not supposed to have a blue title bar?
2006-07-06T08:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	u running in 64k colors? mebbe colormap's exhausted, try running 16M if vid supports it
2006-07-06T08:58:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	I don't think so. It started to go wrong after I changes some gtk settings in kde
2006-07-06T09:01:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	Frogzoo	the clearlooks preview is blue, but when in use, the title bar is brown
2006-07-06T09:01:00.000Z	Frogzoo	monomaniacpat	well reverse whatever you changed in gtk...
