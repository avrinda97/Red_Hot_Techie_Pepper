2012-09-25T04:37:00.000Z	drobati		Anyone mind helping me with my bootloader problem. I don't know why grub is missing.
2012-09-25T04:37:00.000Z	drobati		Vim is great.
2012-09-25T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	Do you have more than one hard drive?
2012-09-25T04:38:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	I do indeed.
2012-09-25T04:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	Grub's boot sector was probably installed to a different drive than the one your BIOS is booting from.
2012-09-25T04:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	Boot info script can tell you, or you can just try telling the BIOS to boot from each drive explicitly.
2012-09-25T04:41:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	I have no internet access though. I'll rtfm on bootloader but is there any cavet like needing internet?
2012-09-25T04:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	Well if you want to run boot info script you'll need to get the script to the machine somehow. It seems like it's probably worth explicitly booting from one drive, then the other (don't assume that you know for sure the current default, try both).
2012-09-25T04:44:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	^
2012-09-25T04:48:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	I've just used a flash drive to transfer it over so hopefully this works.
2012-09-25T04:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	That is going to depend on your particular BIOS. Do understand though that BIOSs don't have any concept of partitions, it's only the two drives which they see.
2012-09-25T04:54:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	booting off HDD did not work either.
2012-09-25T04:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	OK, so you've now tried explicity telling the BIOS to boot from the HD. Have you tried explicitly telling the BIOS to boot from SSD?
2012-09-25T04:55:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	It does that by default.
2012-09-25T04:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	Please try it explicitly, if for nothing else than to make me happy :)
2012-09-25T04:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	That means that your boot firmware can boot via either UEFI or BIOS.
2012-09-25T04:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	I need to leave, but I will be back in 30-45 minutes.
2012-09-25T04:59:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	Additionally, I explicitly tried the SSD and it went into windows still.
2012-09-25T05:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	Ubuntu's installer probably installed grub for BIOS rather than grub for UEFI, and your boot firmware is currently configured to boot via UEFI (though it could all be the other way around).
2012-09-25T05:01:00.000Z	drobati	Jordan_U	I'll look into it further. I know that windows is using BIOS.
2012-09-25T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	drobati	How do you know that?
