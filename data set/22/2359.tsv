2009-10-21T02:54:00.000Z	safe		Ok, I need serious help. Under the gnome menu, all my applications have disappeared, my whole configuration of gnome is wiped out.
2009-10-21T02:54:00.000Z	safe		Is there anyway to roll back to a previous state?
2009-10-21T02:55:00.000Z	jrib	safe	create a fresh new user and see if the problem persists
2009-10-21T02:56:00.000Z	safe	jrib	Will try. I can't even reach the logout, etc in System.
2009-10-21T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	safe	use tty1
2009-10-21T03:03:00.000Z	safe	jrib	you. ;)
2009-10-21T03:04:00.000Z	jrib	safe	right, so now we know it's just a configuration issue.  Try renaming ~/.local/share/applications/ and ~/.config/menus/ as a start
2009-10-21T03:06:00.000Z	safe	jrib	Will do. I noticed I don't have ~/.gnome2 , gconf or gconfd left in my original users folder.
2009-10-21T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	safe	weird
2009-10-21T03:09:00.000Z	safe	jrib	I know. Then it hardly seems worth the time. :(
2009-10-21T03:10:00.000Z	safe	jrib	Thanks for the help anyway, will see what I can do.
2009-10-21T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	safe	any idea what caused the files to disappear?
2009-10-21T03:11:00.000Z	safe	jrib	Uh. Now I do, it seems I ran out of hdd space.
2009-10-21T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	safe	ah
2009-10-21T03:12:00.000Z	safe	jrib	Is that a common factor? And also, is there any way to get them back?
2009-10-21T03:13:00.000Z	jrib	safe	I haven't seen a full hard drive cause the deletion of files before, no.  I don't know how you would get them back
2009-10-21T03:19:00.000Z	safe	jrib	I pinged out, did you say something?
2009-10-21T03:19:00.000Z	jrib	safe	I haven't seen a full hard drive cause the deletion of files before, no.  I don't know how you would get them back
2009-10-21T03:20:00.000Z	safe	jrib	Then I will just reformat, it was long overdue. Thanks for your help!
2009-10-21T03:20:00.000Z	jrib	safe	seems like overkill!
2009-10-21T03:21:00.000Z	safe	jrib	I know I can fix it, but I have all sorts of problem with my setup, it was my first ubuntu install so there's a lot of screw-ups.
2009-10-21T03:21:00.000Z	jrib	safe	ah
