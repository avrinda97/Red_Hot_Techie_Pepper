2009-03-24T02:18:00.000Z	GillaGal		Does Ubuntu utilize a Quad core processor?
2009-03-24T02:18:00.000Z	GillaGal		Does Ubuntu do I need to install 64bit version though?
2009-03-24T02:19:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	no, but you might as well
2009-03-24T02:20:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	Why's that?
2009-03-24T02:20:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	It has performance benefits in certain applications, and pretty much no drawbacks nowadays
2009-03-24T02:21:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	will all the same software as the 32bit version be available?
2009-03-24T02:21:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	or will I be limited to only using 64bit software?
2009-03-24T02:22:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	most software is available as 64bit now, exceptions include zsnes and a few others
2009-03-24T02:24:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	 What determines if a PC should be 32 or 64 bit, just the processor, or is it processor and motherboard?
2009-03-24T02:24:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	processir
2009-03-24T02:25:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	and 64bit = more than one core?
2009-03-24T02:25:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	no, there are single core 64bit processors. 64vs32 has to do with the available address space
2009-03-24T02:26:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	 ok... so really it has nothing to do with the hardware, more so a choice you make in technology/software?
2009-03-24T02:27:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	No, 64vs32 is a physical difference in the CPU, but today's 64bit CPU's are able to run in 32bit mode, so can run either
2009-03-24T02:28:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	 I still don't get how I'd identify whather or not a CPU is 32 or 64.  :)
2009-03-24T02:30:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	 How's Ubuntu for supporting videocards that use HDMI output?
2009-03-24T02:30:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	works great, at least for nvidia. never tried ATI
2009-03-24T02:31:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	yes, it will
2009-03-24T02:32:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	although it may not default to it, but it can
2009-03-24T04:55:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	which logitech remote/board do you use?
2009-03-24T05:15:00.000Z	GillaGal	eqisow1	which logitech remote/board do you use?
2009-03-24T05:15:00.000Z	eqisow1	GillaGal	shrug, the cheapest one with decent range and a laser mouse
