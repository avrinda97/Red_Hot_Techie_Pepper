2006-12-31T12:36:00.000Z	seanzer		it's crazy
2006-12-31T12:36:00.000Z	seanzer		and i have the planets orbiting
2006-12-31T12:36:00.000Z	seanzer		i'm in a solar system
2006-12-31T12:36:00.000Z	seanzer		crazy
2006-12-31T12:37:00.000Z	seanzer		depends what you mean by based on debian
2006-12-31T12:38:00.000Z	seanzer		it's all the same thing
2006-12-31T12:38:00.000Z	seanzer		you have a 266 laptop?
2006-12-31T12:38:00.000Z	seanzer		no one is better than anyone for using a diff distro, we're basically fighting about our package management and repo lists
2006-12-31T12:39:00.000Z	seanzer		well, i put gentoo on a 386 with 32mb of ram
2006-12-31T12:39:00.000Z	seanzer		haha
2006-12-31T12:39:00.000Z	n2diy	seanzer	 and what did you do with it? :)
2006-12-31T12:40:00.000Z	seanzer	n2diy	I used it to calculate PI and quantum level graphics
2006-12-31T12:41:00.000Z	n2diy	seanzer	 OOOKKKAAYY!!! :)
2006-12-31T12:42:00.000Z	n2diy	seanzer	 how long has it been cooking?
2006-12-31T12:44:00.000Z	seanzer	n2diy	idk, i have fun with it seeing how slow math took and how much optimizations i have to do with code for things to run, it's amazing that you can run out of variable space...
2006-12-31T12:44:00.000Z	seanzer	n2diy	but i've had it running and constantly up to date for about 10 years i guess
2006-12-31T12:45:00.000Z	n2diy	seanzer	 roger that, when you solve pie, let me know, ok/
2006-12-31T12:45:00.000Z	seanzer	n2diy	what do you mean solve pi?
2006-12-31T12:46:00.000Z	n2diy	seanzer	the formula for the radius of a circle
2006-12-31T12:47:00.000Z	seanzer	n2diy	um, i got to like 500,000 digits and stopped and went on to quantum graphics..
2006-12-31T12:47:00.000Z	n2diy	seanzer	roger that.
2006-12-31T12:54:00.000Z	n2diy	seanzer	your are easy to entertain, no?
