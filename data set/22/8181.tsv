2006-03-03T13:18:00.000Z	Mrono		I think I screwed up my system
2006-03-03T13:19:00.000Z	Mrono		when I try to boot It fails on mounting my local file system and doesn't like my network card
2006-03-03T13:19:00.000Z	Mrono		it's in the network manager
2006-03-03T13:19:00.000Z	Mrono		but when I click enable it disables a second later
2006-03-03T13:19:00.000Z	Mrono		wow!!!!!

2006-03-03T11:44:00.000Z	mustard	Mrono	readable is easy
2006-03-03T11:44:00.000Z	mustard	Mrono	writeable not so easy :)

2006-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	mustard	Mrono	if you had a live CD that ran in RAM it might work
2006-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	Mrono	mustard	I'm not on a live CD i'm on a live usb stick
2006-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	mustard	Mrono	ahh!
