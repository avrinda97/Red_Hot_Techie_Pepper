2011-07-25T17:10:00.000Z	ionite		Can anyone help me?
2011-07-25T17:10:00.000Z	ionite		Why does the boot up screen freeze whenever I choose Install Ubuntu?  (I am booting from USB stick.  I tried Ubootnet, LiLi and md5sum.  All works fine)
2011-07-25T17:12:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	What sort of system are you running on?
2011-07-25T17:12:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	32bit or 64bit?
2011-07-25T17:12:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	Hardware wise. And what Ubuntu image are you trying to boot?
2011-07-29T15:02:00.000Z	ionite	DistroJockey	pls elaborate
2011-07-29T15:07:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	girl_: The page where you download the driver has an "Additional Information" section that has installation instructions. (Though they could be elaborated on)
2011-07-29T15:27:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	girl_ : Or you can open a terminal window and type:  sudo sh ~/Downloads/FX5500.RUN
2011-07-29T15:30:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	Remember filenames are CaSe sensitive
2011-07-29T16:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	WaltherFI: Does the Nvidia installer add an option to the System - Preferences menu?
2011-07-29T16:04:00.000Z	ionite	DistroJockey	it doesn't add anything to my preferences. and i can't change resolution. what should i do?
2011-07-29T16:05:00.000Z	ionite	DistroJockey	Any advise? because the visual i have on my screen is quite laggy and my sound card, banshee is making weird noises whenever my screen goes laggy
2011-07-29T16:06:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	is the resolution right though?
2011-07-29T16:07:00.000Z	ionite	DistroJockey	no! my original was at 1300X somehting something.
2011-07-29T16:10:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	Did you reboot after you successfully installed the drivers manually earlier?
2011-07-29T16:31:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	upload it to something like tinypic.com
2011-07-29T16:35:00.000Z	ionite	DistroJockey	inypic.com/r/aeb80h/7
2011-07-29T16:36:00.000Z	ionite	DistroJockey	http://tinypic.com/r/aeb80h/7
2011-07-29T16:37:00.000Z	ionite	DistroJockey	u got the link?
2011-07-29T16:37:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	Activated but not currently in use Nvidia driver is a little outside my area atm. Sorry
2011-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	The only thing I can suggest is to hit that Remove button and reboot and then go back there and try again. But there may be better ways.
2011-07-29T16:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	ionite	Incarus6, aetas: My suggestion would be to log out and then log in using Ubuntu Classic (No effects) and see what it is like.
