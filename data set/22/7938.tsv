2005-11-21T09:55:00.000Z	Sedge		ah, i was into developing using dreamweaver when i used windows for a while, but found i was only really using codeview anyways... :P
2005-11-21T09:56:00.000Z	Sedge		i made the transition to css/xhtml about a year ago, haven't looked back since
2005-11-21T09:56:00.000Z	Sedge		don't need wysiwyg for that :P
2005-11-21T09:56:00.000Z	Sedge		what's the best utility for partitioning and formatting disks in ubuntu?
2005-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	Sedge		cool, i was initially going to install with raid 0 (i have 2x160gb SATA drives) but couldn't figure it out
2005-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	Sedge		so i installed on just 1 of the drives
2005-11-21T09:57:00.000Z	Sedge		now i want to format the 2nd drive :P
2005-11-21T09:58:00.000Z	Sedge		i just want to format my second drive for storage of stuff
2005-11-21T09:58:00.000Z	Sedge		movies, music etc...
2005-11-21T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 just for linux? or windows and linux?
2005-11-21T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 so whats stopping you? :P fdisk, mkfs, and mount the puppy!
2005-11-21T09:59:00.000Z	Sedge	dr_willis	i'm not familira with the utils for doing it in linux ;)
2005-11-21T09:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 theres a few Linux-hard drive setup howtos out. its rather trivial. :P
2005-11-21T09:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 fdisk, and make the partitions,, then mkfs.ext3 on the partitions, then edit the fstab to mount them where you want.
2005-11-21T10:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 ubuntu/gnome may have some drive setup tools..  - never noticed  :P
2005-11-21T10:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 sepends on what port its connected to.
2005-11-21T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 'fdisk -l ' will show it
2005-11-21T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 a SATA drive will be a sd##
2005-11-21T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 'mount' shows mounted devices. :P fdisk shows all seen partitions.
2005-11-21T10:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 yes.
2005-11-21T10:14:00.000Z	Sedge	dr_willis	i'm getting a 404 error trying to add those multiverse repo's in synaptic
2005-11-21T10:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sedge	 edit the file manually. and put in a mirror perhaps.
