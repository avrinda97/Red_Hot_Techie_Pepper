2008-07-26T14:47:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	what r u talking about, linux ipod support is great
2008-07-26T14:48:00.000Z	havocstorm	[Hardy]TuTUXG	there's no program that intergrates music library managerment and ipod management properly
2008-07-26T14:48:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	um.. try songbird
2008-07-26T14:49:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	if u just wanna export songs from ipod, rhythmbox can already do the job
2008-07-26T14:50:00.000Z	havocstorm	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gah, do I have to compile songbird for ubuntu
2008-07-26T14:51:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	and if u deal with a hfs ipod, disable journaling and linux can handle it just like a mac
2008-07-26T14:51:00.000Z	havocstorm	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gah, hfs ipod?
2008-07-26T14:51:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	no, it's not need to compile, just download and run
2008-07-26T14:51:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	the mac format?
2008-07-26T14:51:00.000Z	havocstorm	[Hardy]TuTUXG	from the songbird website?
2008-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	ya, check it out
2008-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	havocstorm		[Hardy]TuTUXG,ah, I have mine formatted in windows
2008-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	ya, but fat32 couldn't take files larger than 4G
2008-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	havocstorm		[Hardy]TuTUXG,ah, hmm
2008-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG		that's y i formated mine to hfs
2008-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	havocstorm	[Hardy]TuTUXG	but it's .tar.gz
2008-07-26T14:53:00.000Z	havocstorm	[Hardy]TuTUXG	doesn't it have to be .deb?
2008-07-26T14:53:00.000Z	havocstorm		omfg, why isn't songbird in the repositories
2008-07-26T14:53:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	no, tar.gz just like a .zip file
2008-07-26T14:54:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	it's compressed, u decompress it and use it
2008-07-26T14:54:00.000Z	havocstorm	[Hardy]TuTUXG	ah, I see thanks
2008-07-26T14:54:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	havocstorm	.deb files are package files that u need to use apt to install
