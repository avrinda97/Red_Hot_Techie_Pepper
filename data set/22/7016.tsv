2006-06-12T10:14:00.000Z	troy_s		ramikassab:  it will be whatever the repository has as latest
2006-06-12T10:15:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	why is it saying 0.11 is the latest though? 2.6.4 is the latest at xchat.org
2006-06-12T10:15:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	 Is that version a fork?
2006-06-12T10:15:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	Exactly, my brother.
2006-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	:) not sure, very well could be since the package name is xchat-gnome
2006-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	do you use gnome?
2006-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	I mean do you use xchat
2006-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	Most everything in good old Ubuntu is geared towards Gnome if you use Ubuntu and KDE if you use KDE
2006-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	removing xchat using apt and just downloading it myself from xchat.org would be fine though wouldn't it?
2006-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	I mean, I don't necessarily have to use the xchat-gnome package for it to work
2006-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	No you don't... that just steers it towards the GNOME look and feel via GTK etc.
2006-06-12T10:18:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	Try /msg nickserv help
2006-06-12T10:19:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	thanks
2006-06-12T10:19:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	Just use the repos... xchat-gnome just helps the frontend look like GNOME and fit in with the desktop via the various GNOMEisms.
2006-06-12T10:23:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	VLC is very powerful.  mplayer is great too... different tools really.
2006-06-12T10:23:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	If you need to set up a media jukebox, VLC is the way to go.  If you want a simple plays everything but menus thing -- mplayer is great.  mplayer is also useful for converting media.
2006-06-12T10:24:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	if I install both will it cause conflict within firefox? of course, those are just the plugins so to get the standalones I need to download those separately
2006-06-12T10:24:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	No.  Mplayer has a moz plugin etc.
2006-06-12T10:24:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	could I install both vlc-plugin and mplayer-plugin to see which I like?
2006-06-12T10:25:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	or just try one at a time
2006-06-12T10:28:00.000Z	RamiKassab	troy_s	thanks!
2006-06-12T10:28:00.000Z	troy_s	RamiKassab	Glad I could help.
