2007-03-08T08:07:00.000Z	bruenig		oh yeah I forgot gnome does that

2007-03-08T08:10:00.000Z	sparr	bruenig	putting anything not managed by dpkg outside of /opt is asking for trouble
2007-03-08T08:11:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	no it isn't
2007-03-08T08:11:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	/opt is out of the PATH, /usr/local is for personally compiled stuff by design
2007-03-08T08:12:00.000Z	sparr	bruenig	then you apt-get something that overwrites it, and everything goes to shit.  enjoy  :)
2007-03-08T08:12:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	apt-get doesn't overwrite /usr/local
2007-03-08T08:12:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	apt-get uses /usr
2007-03-08T08:13:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	the worst you could get is maybe you get a /usr/bin/whatever and a /usr/local/bin/whatever and having to change the name of the /usr/local/bin/whatever
2007-04-06T09:17:00.000Z	sparr	bruenig	for the record, what i was looking for (and found) was apt-get install package/oldrelease
2007-04-06T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	ok and next time updates come, I am sure you will be happy to upgrade it, since you apparently don't want to pin that version
2007-04-06T09:19:00.000Z	sparr	bruenig	that is correct, i absolutely dont want to pin that version
2007-04-06T09:19:00.000Z	sparr	bruenig	i want any version other than the current one, the newer the better.
2007-04-06T09:20:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	well once you install the old one, and cron runs updates, it will bug you to install the current one
2007-04-06T09:20:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	yes, you know that annoying orange thing that pops up when you have updates
2007-04-06T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	well don't sudo apt-get upgrade then,
2007-08-09T07:47:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	disk space problem?
2007-08-09T07:47:00.000Z	sparr	bruenig	yes
2007-08-11T11:38:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	well it has to download them there
2007-08-11T11:39:00.000Z	sparr	bruenig	yeah, id like postconfig (or some other late step) to get rid of them
2007-08-11T11:39:00.000Z	bruenig	sparr	you can have it clean out occasionally, perhaps set a cron job to do it
