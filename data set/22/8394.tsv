2005-08-26T10:42:00.000Z	LaMaH		ok one last question - if i download the 64Bit (AMD64) Version of Ubuntu - is it then more dificult installing programs ?
2005-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	LaMaH		like OpenOffice and that
2005-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	raven3x7	LaMaH	your modem should be supported by the smartlink drivers
2005-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	LaMaH		thx raven3x7 :)
2005-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	raven3x7		!tell LaMaH about binary
2005-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	raven3x7		!binarydrivers
2005-08-26T10:44:00.000Z	raven3x7		!drivers
2005-08-26T10:44:00.000Z	raven3x7		!tell LaMaH about drivers
2005-08-26T10:44:00.000Z	LaMaH	raven3x7	- i ment if the 64Bit version of Linux is harder to install programs to
2005-08-26T10:44:00.000Z	LaMaH		than the 32Bit version
2005-08-26T10:45:00.000Z	raven3x7	LaMaH	generraly yes. im not sure if the smartlink drivers will work out of the box or even at all in 64bit
2005-08-26T10:46:00.000Z	LaMaH		o.O Windows ?
2005-08-26T10:46:00.000Z	LaMaH		can Ubuntu run Windows programs ?
2005-08-26T10:46:00.000Z	LaMaH		oh
2005-08-26T10:46:00.000Z	LaMaH		well im gonna DL the 32Bit version of Ubuntu then ;)
2005-08-26T10:47:00.000Z	raven3x7	LaMaH	ubuntu as any gnu/linux distro can run wine which is allows to run quite a few but not all windows programs
