2006-10-16T09:04:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	thanks
2006-10-16T09:05:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	I guess it has this modem        Conexant AC97 Data Fax Modem with SmartCP Driver
2006-10-16T09:06:00.000Z	mnepton	richee	the problem is that you fdo not have a modem, you have a sound card. that's a Winmodem. and Winmodems are nothing but sound cards that do all their modulation in software.
2006-10-16T09:06:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	oh!
2006-10-16T09:06:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	so what can be done about it ?
2006-10-16T09:07:00.000Z	mnepton	richee	there are some Winmodem solutions (some sl-modem-daemon or something) but they are tricky.
2006-10-16T09:07:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	that's package I installed and gnome-ppp and also wvdial are querying the modem.....
2006-10-16T09:08:00.000Z	mnepton	richee	OK, i'm not familiar at all with that package. i haven't used a modem in a long, long time.
2006-10-16T09:08:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	I was just curious to configure it, coz I tried and never succeed
2006-10-16T09:08:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	before
2006-10-16T09:08:00.000Z	mnepton	richee	do you *need* the modem, or are you just curious?
2006-10-16T09:09:00.000Z	richee	mnepton	I need the modem, I want to configure this device with ubuntu/linux
