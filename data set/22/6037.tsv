2007-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	you can use the fuser command to discover who is using
2007-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	phr34ck	mnoir	how do I use that ?
2007-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	type man fuser - complete instructions will appear as if magic :)
2007-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	sounds like something is running away - use top to see
2007-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	:)
2007-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	naa - use kill or killall if you cannot find it in a terminal
2007-01-07T14:42:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	^^^
2007-01-07T14:43:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	all different compressions
2007-01-08T16:00:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	this is not a complete answer but prolly worth you looking at: http://www.pathname.com/fhs/
2007-01-10T13:11:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	it is nothing to use many filemanagers at the same time.  try gnome-commander for instance
2007-01-10T13:11:00.000Z	phr34ck	mnoir	but what's the difference? on what basis a file manager is concidered good ?
2007-01-10T13:12:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	seriously, the only criteria is do you like it.
2007-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	phr34ck	mnoir	ummm. It's okay then/.
2007-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	some folks prefer naut, some konqueror, some mc
2007-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	phr34ck	mnoir	so it's the same argument as what's better? Gnome or KDE..
2007-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	yes but even more pointless
2007-01-10T13:14:00.000Z	phr34ck	mnoir	hehe. Thanks for the help.
2007-01-10T13:15:00.000Z	phr34ck	mnoir	I hail you for that.
2007-01-10T13:16:00.000Z	phr34ck	mnoir	but as you said .. what's the point ?
