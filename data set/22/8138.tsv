2005-10-31T07:04:00.000Z	ben__		Hey...Im obviously connecting to the net but anything I try to install in synaptic is returning an error that it cant connect to the server...any ideas why?
2005-10-31T07:05:00.000Z	ben__		oh ok so it isnt just me having trouble w/ th server?
2005-10-31T07:06:00.000Z	ben__		nope what is that?
2005-10-31T07:07:00.000Z	ben__		oh yeh.. ihave sorry I wasnt thinking
2005-10-31T07:07:00.000Z	ben__		for programming...i wasnt even thinking in those terms though heh
2005-10-31T07:07:00.000Z	ben__		its also saying everything is unauthenticated
2005-10-31T07:08:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	yep...sounds like you having a source.list or repository error
2005-10-31T07:09:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	it does look like your proxy is wacked out :D
2005-10-31T07:11:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	so you've uninstalled anon proxy?
2005-10-31T07:12:00.000Z	ben__	mustard5	any clue? would my "ignore host list" settings in network proxy advanced settings matter?
2005-10-31T07:13:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	paste them in the same pastebin and resubmit, I'll check it out
2005-10-31T07:13:00.000Z	ben__	mustard5	 rather
2005-10-31T07:15:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	I have to say I am at a loss..
2005-10-31T07:15:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	keep asking and see who else might know
2005-10-31T07:17:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	where did you get the anon-proxy program from?
2005-10-31T07:18:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	ah ok
2005-10-31T07:18:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	did you try an 'sudo apt-get remove --purge <packagename> ?
2005-10-31T07:18:00.000Z	ben__	mustard5	 no i did "complete removal" in synaptic
2005-10-31T07:19:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	try that apt-get command I showed you and just substitute the package name
2005-10-31T07:21:00.000Z	ben__	mustard5	 I did and it said the package didnt exist :/
2005-10-31T07:21:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	paste the command you used in #flood plz
2005-10-31T07:23:00.000Z	mustard5	ben__	ok mate..I've hit a wall again.....time for you to seek better advice :D
