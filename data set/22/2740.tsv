2009-03-22T06:03:00.000Z	_Enchained		hi all
2009-03-22T06:03:00.000Z	_Enchained		I'm using GNOME and would like to try KDE(4), but if possible, only install the KDE desktop and not entire Kubuntu...
2009-03-22T06:04:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	- you can install Kubuntu-desktop from the repositories which will let you just use KDE
2009-03-22T06:05:00.000Z	_Enchained	calmor15014	it wiil remove ubuntnu-desktop I think...
2009-03-22T06:05:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	It won't.
2009-03-22T06:05:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	After you install it, log out and when logging back in, choose the KDE session
2009-03-22T06:06:00.000Z	_Enchained	calmor15014	kubuntu-desktop will install Kmail, etc (a lot of KDE apps). I would like juste the KDE desktop, but with my GNOME apps ...
2009-03-22T06:06:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	the only issue I've encountered on my machine is that the menus tend to get cluttered with software from both sides... I spent some time cleaning up my gnome menu...
2009-03-22T06:07:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	lol that's what I was just mentioning about the install.  To be honest, I just installed them.  I'm not sure if there's an easy way to just install the DE and not the rest of the apps.
2009-03-22T06:08:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	 I'm kind of a Gnome fan, but KDE apps look and interact best with KDE, so trying KDE with Gnome apps might not be a fair assessment of it anyway.
2009-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	 That might work, though oddly I don't have that meta-package installed (it must not be a dependency of kubuntu-desktop
2009-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	are you installing kdebase or kdebase-kde4?  (just out of sheer curiosity)
2009-03-22T06:25:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	Yeah, I think there's a fix for that to make them look a bit better.
2009-03-22T06:15:00.000Z	_Enchained	calmor15014	I installed kdebase (jaunty so it's KDE4.2)
2009-03-22T06:17:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	I've heard good things about KDE but also some bad things about ubuntu's implementation of KDE... and my experience with KDE4 (Hardy x64) wasn't so good - graphics were terribly slow compared to Compiz in gnome
2009-03-22T06:20:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	So let me know how KDE4.2 in Jaunty works out.  Are you using x64 or x86?  (or another)?
2009-03-22T06:26:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	I was reading somewhere that FF looks like Win95 on KDE without it..
2009-03-22T06:27:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	I was reading it on google somewhere... I'm sure the answer's out there.  Glad to hear you can do a minimal install like that!
2009-03-22T06:30:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	Awesome.  What does it make FF look like?  Part of the Oxygen theme?
2009-03-22T06:37:00.000Z	_Enchained	calmor15014	I think I must restart something before the change apply...
2009-03-22T06:48:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	Anything after the reboot?
2009-03-22T06:50:00.000Z	calmor15014	_Enchained	is it just FF or all GTK apps?
