2008-12-17T10:22:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	yes I have, the machine functions just fine with other operating systems (including a different distro of linux, freebsd, windows xp, sun xvm server, and windows vista)
2008-12-17T10:22:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	just a thought, hrm...
2008-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	how did you install? full-guided, manual, etc.   ?
2008-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	i'm trying to install from the standard gui desktop
2008-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	from live cd then?
2008-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	right
2008-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	have you tried the alternate cd?
2008-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	no i'm trying to identify the driver issue that exists on the livecd with my configuration.
2008-12-17T10:31:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	is this a desktop or laptop, what version- 8.04 or 8.10? ,
2008-12-17T10:31:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	desktop, basic specs listed in the message, 8.10
2008-12-17T10:34:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	i dont know if this will help you, but did me,,, on the grub menu i edited the kernel line (and later the menu.lst) ... add:  noapic apic=none  to the kernel line
2008-12-17T10:36:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	yes, i'm looking for a way to determine the specific problem I am having
2008-12-17T10:38:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	well, wouldnt hurt to try that and see, hope it helps, sorry i dont know more
2008-12-17T10:39:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	it is going to help.  i'm trying to figure out what caused it to stop working in 8.10 as opposed to 8.04
2008-12-17T10:40:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	i'm with ya there bro, thats why i'm still on 8.04 ;-)
2008-12-17T10:41:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	works fine after it's installed, i'm trying to find out how to gather enough information to file a good bug report
2008-12-17T10:43:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	ahhh, ok, well i cant help there, i'm sticking with 8.04 for a bit longer
2008-12-18T06:55:00.000Z	fryguy	Anacranom	it means you have a hardware problem or incompatibility with the livecd.  use the alternate install disc
2008-12-18T06:57:00.000Z	Anacranom	fryguy	ok,, i may do that, just told 8.04 to upgrade, we'll see how that goes first, but already have had error (minor)
