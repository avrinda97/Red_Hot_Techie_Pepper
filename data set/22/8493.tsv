2006-04-27T05:16:00.000Z	fid		hrmm...anyone know why my xmms skins will not work.  I extracted the files to /home/fid/Desktop/xmms/skins/
2006-04-27T05:16:00.000Z	fid		but i'll load the skin and then the song will switch and it goes back to xmms default skin
2006-04-27T05:16:00.000Z	fid		and for some reason the folder in the
2006-04-27T05:17:00.000Z	fid		skins containing the skin files doesn't show up in the skin browser
2006-04-27T05:18:00.000Z	fid		ya i have been trying that
2006-04-27T05:18:00.000Z	fid		its not working
2006-04-27T05:20:00.000Z	fid		when i do sudo apt-get remove xmms is that completely removing the program ?
2006-04-27T05:20:00.000Z	fid		like I want not trace of the program found
2006-04-27T05:20:00.000Z	fid		then I want to install it from scratch

2006-04-27T05:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	try sudo apt-get remove xmms --purge
2006-04-27T05:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	Other than that...  It pretty much removes everything.
2006-04-27T05:23:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	Try moving ~/.xmms or something to a temporary folder.
2006-04-27T05:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	mv ~/.xmms ~/.xmms-old
2006-04-27T05:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	On linux, "hidden files" merely have a dot in the front.
2006-04-27T05:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	I thought you've already reinstalled it?
2006-04-27T05:26:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	No, keep it installed.
2006-04-27T05:26:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	~/.xmms or similar file should be what keeps your configuration for xmms.
2006-04-27T05:26:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	I don't actually use xmms, so I'm guessing that it's ~/.xmms
2006-04-27T05:27:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	Try starting xmms again.
2006-04-27T05:36:00.000Z	Arafangion	fid	Don't do that!
