2004-12-28T14:56:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	Thanks I'll go check
2004-12-28T14:56:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	The project i mentioned above is hosted somewhere on sourceforge
2004-12-28T14:57:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	Kewl thanks ... I think Riddell is right and I did this in KDE a loooong time ago (switched to gnome ~ 4 years ago!!) but now I can do this anyhow :)
2004-12-28T14:58:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	no prob...ill try to remember the exact name...but it was a couple of weeks ago
2004-12-28T15:01:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	Found it on gnomefiles http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=270
2004-12-28T15:02:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	Actually I just upgraded to hoary a short while ago and it works great!! :)
2004-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	alright, thx, i might try it out in a bit. someone on osnews was complaining about hoary breaking their system but no one else was complaining so i held off
2004-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	The friend who got me hooked on Ubuntu (last sunday) told me to upgrade while it was fresh as the first time he upgraded he had a couple issues ... second time was the charm for him ... first try for me worked great :)
2004-12-28T15:10:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	maybe you need the dev packages?? try checking synaptic
2004-12-28T15:11:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	I guess I need to learn what to apt-get as I just tried to sudo apt-get install gtk ... forgot I'd need the dev for this :)
2004-12-28T15:12:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	i once needed libsndfile a ./configure script told me, so i checked yum (was on fedora at this point) and it was installed, took me hours to figure out i needed libsndfile-dev ;)
2004-12-28T15:13:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	Not a big fedora fan ... tried it for 2 weeks and couldn't play smac (I'm in a pbem group on linuxgamers.com) so I tried Ubuntu ... after less than a week I don't think I'm ever switching to anything else!!
2004-12-28T15:13:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	yeah, i found it was buggy and unstable...ubuntu is much much better
2004-12-28T15:20:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	not sure....whats the name of the program again?? ill see if i can google something up for you
2004-12-28T15:23:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	try searching synaptic, maybe the name is a tad different or something....i have found entering a couple letters from a name i am looking for sometimes helps me find it
2004-12-28T15:23:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	lol, never mind
2004-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	lol, i know....is the program still maintained? maybe it isnt maintained anymore so it isnt included in the normal repos?
2004-12-28T15:28:00.000Z	kleedrac	ryanmcgregor	You mean this little app?  I doubt it ever made any release beyond source
2004-12-28T15:29:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	hopefully it works....i honestly have never tried it
2004-12-28T15:36:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	lol, post me a link
2004-12-28T15:39:00.000Z	ryanmcgregor	kleedrac	im surprised the gnome people dont take over the project....it is a feature a lot of people ask for....if i knew how to code.....:P
