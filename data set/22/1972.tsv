2009-11-08T22:11:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	why are you compiling gimp?
2009-11-08T22:11:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	because my friend wanted the latest stable version, of which I couldnt find any binarys
2009-11-08T22:12:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	ok, but *why*?  Do you actually need any features it has that the repository's version does not have?
2009-11-08T22:12:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	the repo vs is 2.4. 2.6 is pretty far ahead.
2009-11-08T22:13:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	I really doubt it to be honest.  Anyway, how did you handle the dependencies you mentioned?
2009-11-08T22:13:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	 but thats besides the point, how do I decalre an enviroment variable for gcc, to declare gegl-0.0.6?
2009-11-08T22:13:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	you don't want to do that...
2009-11-08T22:13:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	then how do I tell ./configure that i have vs 0.0.6, and not the older 0.0.18??
2009-11-08T22:13:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	can you answer my question?
2009-11-08T22:14:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	what is your point???
2009-11-08T22:14:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	for me to help you, I need you to answer my question...
2009-11-08T22:14:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	what exactly is your question??
2009-11-08T22:15:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	I really doubt it to be honest.  Anyway, how did you handle the dependencies you mentioned?
2009-11-08T22:16:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	could you be more clear? Mainly, I went through the readme, followed errors, until I had installed all the dependancies untill there were no more errors in ./configure, except for the whole gegl version error
2009-11-08T22:16:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	how did you install the dependencies?
2009-11-08T22:16:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	well, most I found in apt, a few like babl and gegl i instaleld from source
2009-11-08T22:17:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	isn't gegl in the repositories?
2009-11-08T22:17:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	not the version that gimp 2.6 caleld for
2009-11-08T22:26:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	why did you install 0.0.6 if it wants 0.0.18?
2009-11-08T22:19:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	anyways, the question is, how do I decalre the enviroment variables?? I tried "./configure GLIB_CFLAGS="0.0.6" GLIB_LIBS="0.0.6"" but that failed
2009-11-08T22:21:00.000Z	jrib	N30N	what version of ubuntu is this?
2009-11-08T22:21:00.000Z	N30N	jrib	8.04 lts
