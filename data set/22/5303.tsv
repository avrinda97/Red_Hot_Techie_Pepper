2007-05-29T09:22:00.000Z	ramatieg		Does anyone know how to uninstall a package with a broken pre-uninst script?
2007-05-29T09:22:00.000Z	ramatieg		pre-removal rather
2007-05-29T09:23:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	can you paste the entire error on pastebin?

2007-05-29T09:24:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	It didn't install completely because of broken pre-inst scripts. I just want to get rid of it now
2007-05-29T09:25:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	try this: dpkg -r reportbug    do you get the same error?
2007-05-29T09:26:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	Same error
2007-05-29T09:26:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	ok, now try: dpkg -r --force-all reportbug
2007-05-29T09:27:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	How risky is that? This is my gateway and it's late...
2007-05-29T09:28:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	Screw it, I'll do it anyway
2007-05-29T09:28:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	it's only reportbug, it's not vital to the running system
2007-05-29T09:28:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	I was more worried about 'forcing' and breaking something
2007-05-29T09:28:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	no need, since apt is just a front-end to dpkg
2007-05-29T09:29:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	Same error
2007-05-29T09:32:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	still looking...
2007-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	Don't worry about it too much. I'll look through the install scripts tomorrow to try and pin down the error
2007-05-29T09:33:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	cd /var/lib/dpkg/info && ls -l reportbug*
2007-05-29T09:34:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	ok
2007-05-29T09:35:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	Yeah I will debug it tomorrow (were you just pointing me to the prerm scripts?)
2007-05-29T09:36:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	yeah, that's all of the scripts and files for it, actually
2007-05-29T09:36:00.000Z	ramatieg	Gnea	Okay, thanks for the help
2007-05-29T09:36:00.000Z	Gnea	ramatieg	you're welcome, good luck
