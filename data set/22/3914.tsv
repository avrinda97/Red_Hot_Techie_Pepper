2008-05-05T22:07:00.000Z	Abd67		Like dreamwaever
2008-05-05T22:08:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	yes
2008-05-05T22:09:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	ejer thank you
2008-05-05T22:15:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	no
2008-05-05T22:15:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	so komposer does not work under hardy 64 bits
2008-05-05T22:16:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	i686 corresponds to the instruction set changes in pentium 2 systems.
2008-05-05T22:16:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	ok thanks
2008-05-05T22:16:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	it will... amd64 systems emulate 32bit fine.
2008-05-05T22:17:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	you will need the 32bit compat packages though to get a 32bit package to install and work.
2008-05-05T22:17:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	anu idea where can i get them?
2008-05-05T22:24:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	lib32<whatever> seems to be how Ubuntu does 32bit things... I can't seem to find a metapackage to get a decent collection of these though to get started
2008-05-05T22:25:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	I've stumbled upon this link -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=551060 I hope it mighty be a good help
2008-05-05T22:25:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	apt-cache show nvu does nothing? No reason there wouldn't be a package for it, it's OSS afaik
2008-05-05T22:26:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	Never use external software unless you absolutely require it... just asking for trouble... this isn't Windows  ;)
2008-05-05T22:27:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	I found nvu in synactic, hope it works. Thanks for the warning :)
2008-05-05T22:30:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	ejer thanks for your time. I have kompozer now and working just fine. :D
2008-05-05T22:31:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	ahhh the nvu bugfix project  :)
2008-05-05T22:31:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	Nvu came from Linspire, they are apparently bad about fixing things, so they forked for Kompozer :)
2008-05-05T22:32:00.000Z	Abd67	fde	linspire = windows :p
2008-05-05T22:33:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	nah... they are a debian-based and even ubuntu-based now project... they employee a few debian developers to assist in packaging etc...
2008-05-05T22:34:00.000Z	fde	Abd67	In fact, they had to change their name from Lindows to make it clearer it WASN'T Windows... on account of Microsoft thought their brilliant userbase would get confused
