2011-01-05T05:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	You have been asked many times to stop using caps lock. This is your last warning.
2011-01-05T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	Can you post a screenshot of where the install is hanging?
2011-01-05T06:10:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	Here it is, but for some reason the image didnt pick up the loading curser =/ w/e:       http://imagebin.org/131025

2011-01-05T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	I saw it the first (and second) time.
2011-01-05T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	How much RAM do you have?
2011-01-05T06:15:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	I have 2GB of Ram
2011-01-05T06:17:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	I have 2GB of Ram
2011-01-05T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	Again, I saw the first time.
2011-01-05T06:18:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	why dont you answer back...
2011-01-05T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	Because I don't know why it's hanging there.
2011-01-05T06:21:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	YOU ASKED ME HOW MUCH RAM I HAD I THought?
2011-01-05T06:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	Is there a problem with your caps lock key?
2011-01-05T06:22:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	Keep on pressing my accident =/
2011-01-05T06:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	You might want to disable the caps lock key completely. At the very least please look at your responses before hitting enter so that you can catch that you had caps lock on and fix it.
2011-01-05T06:23:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	can you keep helping me?
2011-01-05T06:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	I don't have any ideas currently.
2011-01-05T06:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	Like others have suggested, the alternate install CD will probably work for you.
2011-01-05T06:26:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	when i use the other CD, does it come with all the stuff?
2011-01-05T06:27:00.000Z	Ubunter	Jordan_U	that it would come with with the normal CD?
2011-01-05T06:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ubunter	Yes. The resulting install is identical.
