2009-01-14T06:28:00.000Z	xinxan		Hi, I know there's a #vbox channel but nobody's answering. Could someone here maybe help? Host OS: Ubuntu 8.10. Guest OS: Windows XP. My problem: I've tried three times installing now. Every time, it asks for a password in setup, then refuses to accept the password when I try to login after setup is complete. The third time I didn't set a password in setup, I skipped that step, but it still demands a password which doesn't 
2009-01-14T06:29:00.000Z	xinxan		Sorry to bug you guys when there's a vbox channel but nobody's replying there. Could anybody help me with my vbox?
2009-01-14T06:29:00.000Z	Kamilion	xinxan	I've never been asked to set passwords in XP setup, only usernames. Try different install media.
2009-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	Kamilion	xinxan	try a different windows installation ISO, such as a MSDN image from microsoft
2009-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	What do you mean by install media? It asked me for a username (which didn't show up as the username in the login screen - it was just Local Admin) and the password, which it clearly ignored.
2009-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Oh sorry, you explained. How would I get that?
2009-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	THanks.
2009-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	I'll have a look now.
2009-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	Kamilion	xinxan	Sure. Make sure you get one that matches the key you're trying to use.
2009-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Oddly, it never asked me for a key.
2009-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	Kamilion	xinxan	you have a custom-edited windows ISO
2009-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Do I? I believe you.
2009-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Could that be the problem then?
2009-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	You think I have to get a different CD or ISO?
2009-01-14T06:33:00.000Z	Kamilion	xinxan	yes, there should be a unattended setup inf file on your CD that contains all the passwords and CDkey
2009-01-14T06:33:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Okay, thanks.
2009-01-14T06:33:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	THanks for the help  I'll have a look for that.
2009-01-14T06:34:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Could it also be a problem that I am installing onto an external hard drive?
2009-01-14T06:35:00.000Z	Kamilion	xinxan	No, that's no problem, I've done that plenty.
2009-01-14T06:35:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Okay. And I don't have to have any special settings for that, right? Just change the defaults in settings. So this should work after I figure out the unattended thing, okay. I'll give that a try. Thanks again.
2009-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	Kamilion	xinxan	Can't change the settings, they're on the ISO file. But you can discover what settings were used.
2009-01-14T06:37:00.000Z	xinxan	Kamilion	Thanks again. Better go to bed, I'm flagging, but I'll try it tomorrow. Cheers.
