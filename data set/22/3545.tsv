2008-08-14T20:41:00.000Z	esh_		using xubuntu...cpu speed in BIOS reads correct, 1.6ghz, but in linux via cat /proc/cpuinfo and conky it reads 1.2ghz. windows reds correctly
2008-08-14T20:41:00.000Z	esh_		lol im at 61C
2008-08-14T20:41:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	do you have cpufreqd or something similar installed?
2008-08-14T20:42:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	i will in a moment
2008-08-14T20:45:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	ok now what?
2008-08-14T20:45:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	=) I thought that if you had cpufreqd installed, you might have had a profile running that limited the speed of your cpu
2008-08-14T20:46:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	oh no i dont. can i use it to set the clock correctly?
2008-08-14T20:46:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	I use cpufreqd to throttle my cpu to 60% speed so it doesn't get too hot
2008-08-14T20:47:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	maybe another daemon was throttling your cpu speed (forget the name, it's installed by default w/ ubuntu)
2008-08-14T20:48:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	brb, sec please
2008-08-14T20:51:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	with a default /etc/cpufreqd.conf your cpu should be set to 100% speed while on AC
2008-08-14T20:52:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	I would try rebooting, then check for a running cpufreqd (ps ax | grep cpufreqd) and check /proc/cpuinfo again
2008-08-14T20:52:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	ahhh AC is plugged in and conky states 1.6
2008-08-14T20:53:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	what was the expected value again?
2008-08-14T20:53:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	it's a 1.6p4 m that was running at 1.2
2008-08-14T20:53:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	so conky states 1.6 ... what about /proc/cpuinfo?
2008-08-14T20:54:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	1.6ghz
2008-08-14T20:54:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	:)
2008-08-14T20:54:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	guess that means theres another reason wqhy this thing kind of chugs
2008-08-14T20:55:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	if you want to monitor your cpu speed over a period of time you can do: watch grep \"cpu MHz\" /proc/cpuinfo
2008-08-14T20:56:00.000Z	esh_	ds[de]	thanks i will
2008-08-14T20:56:00.000Z	ds[de]	esh_	good luck
