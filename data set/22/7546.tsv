2006-03-19T11:54:00.000Z	axisys	chuckyp	yeap
2006-03-19T11:54:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	lirc is what youa re looking for
2006-03-19T11:55:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	let me see
2006-03-19T11:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	that should work
2006-03-19T11:57:00.000Z	axisys	chuckyp	but i have a nc6220 .. not thinkpad
2006-03-19T11:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	err lirc is for remote controls.  I don't know exactly what you ware trying to do.  But that wiki should work.
2006-03-19T11:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	the packages arent' specifically for a thinkpad.  The only difference maybe the /dev/<devicename>
2006-03-19T11:58:00.000Z	axisys	chuckyp	i am trying to download file to my phone
2006-03-19T11:58:00.000Z	axisys	chuckyp	how do i find what would be my device
2006-03-19T11:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	I would just figure out which /dev/<name>  your irda port is on.
2006-03-19T11:58:00.000Z	axisys	chuckyp	ifconfig shows irda0 up
2006-03-19T12:00:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	hrm... I've never used ir like you are using it perhaps someone else here is.
2006-03-19T12:01:00.000Z	axisys	chuckyp	thnx
2006-11-01T13:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	axisys	perhaps search the forums.
