2009-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	aksci		my pen drive always mounts as read-only file system! this is my dmesg output! http://tinypaste.com/ea91c
2009-08-06T07:56:00.000Z	aksci		even if i put umask=000 while mounting!
2009-08-06T07:57:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	all the FAT errors indicate that the filesystem is going readonly to prevent any damage from being done to an apparently corrupt filesystem
2009-08-06T07:57:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	you might think about, with the stuick unmounted, doing: sudo fsck /dev/sdd1
2009-08-06T07:58:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	use first FAT? what about the options? truncate first or second?
2009-08-06T07:59:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	I've never had to fsck a FAT filesystem (from Linux) before, so I'm not entirely certain
2009-08-06T08:01:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	no good! :( the filesystem still shouts read only!
2009-08-06T08:02:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	hmm. This the only thumb drive you're having trouble with?
2009-08-06T08:03:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	this is the second one! i even formatted the first one i tried!
2009-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	did you try perhaps a different USB port or hub?
2009-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	can the problem be in my system's config? i dont think anything went wrong in these pendrives!
2009-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	yeah, tried all of them!
2009-08-06T08:08:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	anything??
2009-08-06T08:09:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	The only thing that keeps coming to mind is to make sure the stick(s) isn't/aren't the problem by trying them on another system, but it's unlikely you'll have two sticks go bad at the same time
2009-08-06T08:12:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	yeah! that's what! well, it can me my fault though! the copy speed was damn slow(200kps) so i cancelled it n tried to unmount! didn't work! so i just pulled it off! - same case with both of them!
2009-08-06T08:12:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	hmm, that could indeed corrupt the FAT tables quite nicely
2009-08-06T08:17:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	lol! yeah! but then i formatted them!
2009-08-06T08:18:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	now just check what happened, i mounted the first screwed up thumbdrive, the file icon in computer:/// shows unknown type! n when i tried copying thru cli with root, it worked!
2009-08-06T08:19:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	in a word, interesting.
2009-08-06T08:19:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	so what can you say? what should i do with my second thumbdrive? try formatting it?
2009-08-06T08:20:00.000Z	Ghoti	aksci	well, if there's nothing you want to keep on the drive, formatting it can't really do any harm
2009-08-06T08:44:00.000Z	aksci	Ghoti	well, after some formatting job, its working! but the transfer speed is pathetic!
