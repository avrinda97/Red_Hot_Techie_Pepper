2010-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		Eh, iPods are good, but overrated
2010-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		there are plenty of excellent mp3 players that aren't ipods, but few get looked at
2010-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		Like the need to use itunes to transfer audio
2010-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		I'd rather use my money to support a manufacturer that gives me what I want by default
2010-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		hey, I have a quick question in general
2010-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		recently on slashdot there was an article about using Vim as an IDE
2010-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		I'm currently moving to vim as an IDE, and I was wondering whether it would be better to stick to something like Codeblocks
2010-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sylvester_Ink	it's just an editor. hard to call vim an ide :)
2010-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	but it can be extended to provide all the ide abilities
2010-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sylvester_Ink	like what? syntax highlighting?  lol
2010-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	projects, debugging, function and variable lists, etc
2010-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sylvester_Ink	can you point me to some of these extensions? i don't even know what that means... you have only one screen and commmand / input mode. it's not like you can step through your code watching the registers and memory locations, getting popup keyword completion, etc
2010-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sylvester_Ink	there are so many ides out there now i can't fathom why you'd want to even try transforming vi into one. that's not the right use case for it
2010-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	the ones I've installed so far are taglist, Nerdtree, Omnicppcomplete
2010-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	I've really taken a liking to how efficient Vim is.  I'm giving it a try to see if it can compete with Codeblocks and Kdevelop
2010-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sylvester_Ink	well, good luck :)   i like the fact that it's everywhere and comes up instantly when i need to edit files. and i have it burned into my fingers. but once you start plugging in tons of extensions to make it into an ide, you have to wonder if you're wasting time
2010-01-01T06:35:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	I'll definitely keep your advice in mind.  If it turns out to be lacking, I can easily jump back to Codeblocks
2010-01-01T06:36:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sylvester_Ink	i'm not actually giving you any advice. i'm just expressing my amusement that people are trying to turn vi into something like an ide. why not just go to emacs or stay with codeblocks? (i don't know codeblocks)
2010-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	I'm not too crazy about emacs myself.  It's a good editor, but i'm acustomed to Vim
2010-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	besides, Vim has a lot of built in IDE features, so why not use them?
2010-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sylvester_Ink	sure, i'm not saying you should stay away from them. i just like the portability and do things with many different kinds of unix, most of which aren't running vim or associated plugins/extensions
2010-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink	mister_roboto	Cyber_Akuma  I'm referring to Vim rather than Vi, fyi
