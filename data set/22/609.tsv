2011-06-27T07:16:00.000Z	midoski		when I edit the sudoers file via visudo
2011-06-27T07:16:00.000Z	midoski		when do the changse take effect?
2011-06-27T07:17:00.000Z	Flannel	midoski	once you save it (and it actually saves)
2011-06-27T07:17:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	alright
2011-06-27T07:17:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	well I wrote a sudoers rule, and it didn't stick
2011-06-27T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	midoski	Did it successfully save?  visudo checks the syntax and won't save (although I always thought it gave you an error)
2011-06-27T07:18:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	yes
2011-06-27T07:18:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	"/etc/sudoers.tmp" 28L, 643C written
2011-06-27T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	midoski	right, that's your editor saving it to a temp file, then you close the editor, visudo realizes you're done, and does its magic (copies it back, etc)
2011-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	it's still not working apparently
2011-06-27T07:19:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	http://linuxlol.pastebay.com/127272 I have this little config
2011-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	Flannel	midoski	if you visudo again, do you see your changes?
2011-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	yes
2011-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	Flannel	midoski	Alright, so it's a config issue, not a sudoers editing issue.
2011-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	all signs point to yes
2011-06-27T07:20:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	I linked you my current additions to the sudoers file
2011-06-27T07:22:00.000Z	Flannel	midoski	first off, you want to use sudo, not su.
2011-06-27T07:22:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	baaah!
2011-06-27T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	midoski	did that fix it? ;)
2011-06-27T07:23:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	1 sec, trying
2011-06-27T07:24:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	:O might have worked
2011-06-27T07:24:00.000Z	midoski	Flannel	it certainly ran, that's for sure
