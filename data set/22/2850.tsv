2009-02-13T01:24:00.000Z	mustangg		sorry I need to ask again... but: where does the installer grab the hostname for the network configuration stage of install.
2009-02-13T01:24:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	/etc/hostname  ?
2009-02-13T01:25:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	or /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf
2009-02-13T01:25:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	 during a fresh install?
2009-02-13T01:25:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	install from CD?
2009-02-13T01:26:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	yeah, the alt iso.
2009-02-13T01:26:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	wouldn't there be a moment during the install, where it prompts you for the hostname?
2009-02-13T01:26:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	right. where does that name come from, when it self populates?
2009-02-13T01:27:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	i'm guessing from the CD. never checked, but it probably has a default hostname file on CD, where the hostname defaults to "ubuntu:
2009-02-13T01:29:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	that was my expectation but I asked because I've tried a few fresh installs and each time the installer finds my previous hostname. Even after I dd'd my hard drives from sec 0 to sec max.
2009-02-13T01:30:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	are u connected to a dhcp server?
2009-02-13T01:31:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	 yeah, and that nic does have a reserved ip. Could it be grabbing the info because that's the name associated with the mac on the dhcp server?
2009-02-13T01:32:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	yes. check /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf and find your hostname in there, along with the mac addr and reserved IP
2009-02-13T01:33:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	well I don't have such an animal during the fresh install, but at least you've helped my peace-of-mind. I'd spent a good amount of time fighting problems with fakeraid+ LVM and that seemed like yet another problem to fix...
2009-02-13T01:34:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	something like: host mustanggsbox { hardware ethernet 00:d3:24:f7:82 ; fixed-address 192.168.20.3 ; }
2009-02-13T01:35:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	you could try deleting that entry from your dhcpd.conf, then restart dhcp3-server before installing again
2009-02-13T01:35:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	 my dhcp box is a linux router.
2009-02-13T01:36:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	so I guess I'd mistaken assumed (!) that I would be able to find info on this in faq/docs or whereever. :)
2009-02-13T01:37:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	i see
2009-02-13T01:38:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	u could also check #ubuntu-server for more info on this subject
2009-02-13T01:42:00.000Z	mustangg	dayo2	thank you for the info. I  think I will do just that when I have a chance.
2009-02-13T01:42:00.000Z	dayo2	mustangg	u're welcome :-)
