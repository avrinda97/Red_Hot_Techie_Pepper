2012-06-30T10:05:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	you might read a few tutorials on how to move and resize partitions
2012-06-30T10:10:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	you can't resize your active partitions
2012-06-30T10:14:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	i have the solution for you, wait a sec
2012-06-30T10:17:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	ok, here it is: you want to reisize your ubuntu partition to claim those 96GB space, correct? nice. Yes, grub will top working, but... heres how you recover iit: http://askubuntu.com/questions/27155
2012-06-30T10:19:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	you can either create a separate /home partition OR you can resize your ubuntu partition to claim that unused hdd space. My recomendation is the latter: it's easier and safer... creating a separate /home is not hard, but it would take extra steps...
2012-06-30T10:20:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	if you can use xchat from a live session, you can use firefox too :D
2012-06-30T10:24:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	reboot to live session again... open gparted, open xchat, paste a screenshot here
2012-06-30T10:28:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	so check this url: http://askubuntu.com/a/27179/11015
2012-06-30T10:28:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	(if it helps you, I'd appreciate if you upvote it)
2012-06-30T10:29:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	swap back on is normal and expected... live sessions always mount swap on reboot
2012-06-30T10:29:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	 right-click the swap on gparted, select "SwapOff"
2012-06-30T10:30:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	it is talking about how to recober grub in case you lose it...
2012-06-30T10:30:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	resize will work. grub WILL stop working for sure
2012-06-30T10:31:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	but that is normal and expected
2012-06-30T10:31:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	all you have to do is follow the instructions in that url to have grub back again
2012-06-30T10:32:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	after resize, give your ubunt partition a label too, ok?
2012-06-30T10:32:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	and no need to reboot ;)
2012-06-30T10:33:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	right click the partition ;)
2012-06-30T10:33:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	ext4
2012-06-30T10:34:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	the label takes seconds... the resize won't take that long
2012-06-30T10:35:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	it could take even less if you first rized it down to 10GB and then moved+expanded
2012-06-30T10:37:00.000Z	MestreLion	croz	rized = sized
