2008-05-26T23:58:00.000Z	In-Sane``		I installed wine, I tried wine program.exe but it shows an error. I also tried wine --help and all I get is wine program argument.. whats the right command for wine please?
2008-05-26T23:59:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	'program.exe' is just a placeholder. You should replace it with the name of a real program
2008-05-26T23:59:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	Yes. that was jsut an example. the real program is NetworkAdmin.exe :)
2008-05-27T00:01:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	you could put that error on a pastebin and ask the people in #wine about it. Or you could try the latest wine version, which is available through an inofficial repository... see the factoid:
2008-05-27T00:03:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	sure thanks. will do, but do you have any idea how to run .exe file with wine via the terminal?
2008-05-27T00:03:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	the way you tried it was correct.
2008-05-27T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	you might pastebin the error and give me the URL, in case it's something obviouse
2008-05-27T00:04:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	ah ok.. thanks for ur help anyway :)
2008-05-27T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	use http://paste.ubuntu.com
2008-05-27T00:05:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	I would do but am in windows now. will paste it if i got the chance..
2008-05-27T00:05:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	what does this networkadmin thing do? Perhaps there is a Linux alternative.
2008-05-27T00:08:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	well, it lets you restrict access to every computer, apply executable patches remotely, and schedule reboots, shutdowns, and Windows Explorer restarts from a single administrator's computer connected to a TCP/IP-based network or Internet..
2008-05-27T00:09:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	sounds like a tool for Windows networks that should be run from a Windows machine
2008-05-27T00:10:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	do you think it won't work for ubuntu?
2008-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	I think it will be a kludge to administer a network of Windows machines from Ubuntu.
2008-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	ok ok.. I understand your point. :)
2008-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	:)
2008-05-27T00:31:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	one more question please, how do i log the terminal? I want the terminal to log all the commands i've used? any idea?
2008-05-27T00:31:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	it does so automatically, in the file ~/.bash_history
2008-05-27T00:31:00.000Z	soundray	In-Sane``	you can just enter 'history' to see the list in chronological order
2008-05-27T00:32:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	aha.. ok thanks again :)
2008-06-05T15:18:00.000Z	In-Sane``	soundray	I need your help.. I can't enable desktop effects and I can't enable my video card, I also checked my laptop for 3D acceleration and the result was: direct rendring: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)
