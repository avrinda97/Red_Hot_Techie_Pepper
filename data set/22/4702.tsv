2007-11-01T00:28:00.000Z	agroker		what is a current best solution for bug #59695?
2007-11-01T00:29:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	does hdparm -B and hdparm -S work for you?
2007-11-01T00:29:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	I did not try those yet (yes, saw them in Paul's blog)
2007-11-01T00:30:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	but was wondering if there is any "official" recommndation in existance...
2007-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	the bug seems to be officially ignored. so no, no recommendations
2007-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	you will laugh, I read about this bug today morning on the blog of certain linux hater ;-)
2007-11-01T00:32:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	yeah, it's very good troll food :-(
2007-11-01T00:32:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	currently I got 80K Load_cycles on my dell note after ~1 year usage
2007-11-01T00:32:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	unfortunately :-(
2007-11-01T00:33:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	ironically, I`m forced to used a rhel derivative at work, so asking for help at #rhel I used to als
2007-11-01T00:35:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	well, at work I forced to Suse, which is a pain. But as this bug is not taken care of and I cannot upgrade to gutsy because of another I am seriousely considering switching to Etch.
2007-11-01T00:35:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	isnt'
2007-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	interesting..
2007-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	I wonder what's your current Load_Cycles count?
2007-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	393590
2007-11-01T00:39:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	it's something
2007-11-01T00:39:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	I hate to think about but do you guess people may blame the hardware failures on ubuntu inc?
2007-11-01T00:40:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	I'm pretty sure people will. Whether it's justified or not is a completely different story and of course you can never proove it.
2007-11-01T00:42:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	if what Paul writes is true then one has documentable smartctl outputs
2007-11-01T00:43:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	sure but how do you know your harddrive died because the heads were mechanically damaged due to parking/unparking?
2007-11-01T00:45:00.000Z	agroker	flixh	unless the manufacturer opens is for me
2007-11-01T00:46:00.000Z	flixh	agroker	well that's probably a lot more expensive and/or a lot more hazzle than getting a new disc and use your backup
