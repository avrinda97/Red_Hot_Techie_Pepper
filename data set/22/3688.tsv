2008-06-27T19:36:00.000Z	mndo		hi there!
2008-06-27T19:36:00.000Z	mndo		anybody using virtualbox?
2008-06-27T19:36:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	yes its good isn't it
2008-06-27T19:37:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	very nice, but i am having problems burning dvds from the guests..
2008-06-27T19:37:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	have you enabled the option to do that?
2008-06-27T19:37:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	yes passthrough is on..
2008-06-27T19:38:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	what guest are you using?
2008-06-27T19:38:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	and host for that matter?
2008-06-27T19:38:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	also hardy..
2008-06-27T19:38:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	both hardy..
2008-06-27T19:39:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	from the logs, it appears to be a host problem..
2008-06-27T19:39:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	ok ;) well could you just package it up as an iso, move it to your host and then burn it
2008-06-27T19:39:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	did vbox give you any pointers?
2008-06-27T19:40:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	http://pastebin.com/m45eb5172
2008-06-27T19:41:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	running someting as root don't appeals to me..
2008-06-27T19:44:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	i have spoken to klaus before and he does know what he is talking about, can i ask do you NEED to burn it from the host or could you package it up, i agree with you both that i would not run vbox in root if i could help it
2008-06-27T19:44:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	sorry from the guest i meant
2008-06-27T19:46:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	yes i can always package from the guest.. but i use this machine to allow others to play with it (even running windows clients) and don't mess with my host.. so burning from inside the guest would be great..
2008-06-27T19:47:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	isn't there anyway to make ubuntu allow anyone to full access the dvd drive?
2008-06-27T19:47:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	but when you burn you still have to stick a physical disc in write, unless you have invented something else ;)
2008-06-27T19:48:00.000Z	gabbler	mndo	dunno, let me think...
2008-06-27T21:10:00.000Z	mndo	gabbler	so, any ideas howto give full access to the dvd drive?
