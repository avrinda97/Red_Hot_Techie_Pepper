2009-05-21T04:52:00.000Z	zamba		i'm trying to set up a firefox profile that is to be copied to a set of machines.. this worked just beautiful on the firefox version running on ubuntu intrepid, but after upgrading to jaunty (and firefox 3.0.9) this has stopped working.. firefox starts, but freezes after a couple of seconds.. in the process list it's listed as defunc..
2009-05-21T04:53:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	is nfs involved?
2009-05-21T04:53:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	correct
2009-05-21T04:54:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	firefox (or really sqlite) can get really unhappy if the profile directory is on nfs (related to (stale or malfunctioning) filesystem locks)
2009-05-21T04:54:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	well.. it works if i just wipe the existing .mozilla folder
2009-05-21T04:54:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	symptoms usually include bogus "profile in use" messages and the address bar and bookmarks/history malfunctioning completely.
2009-05-21T04:55:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	firefox just don't work here..
2009-05-21T04:55:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	it launches and loads the home page, but then freezes entirely
2009-05-21T04:55:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	if i remove the .mozilla folder and start firefox, it works just fine
2009-05-21T04:55:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	hmm. Wild guess: is this a terminal server-ish setup with tons of firefox instances running on one system?
2009-05-21T04:55:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	nope
2009-05-21T04:55:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	one firefox for each computer
2009-05-21T04:56:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	err, wait, that wouldn't explain it working without .mozilla. Can you narrow it down to a particular file you're copying?
2009-05-21T05:00:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	any idea about my problem?
2009-05-21T05:01:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	i know using just a single user account for all the lab machine is a "bad idea" by design, but i don't think it's technically relevant..
2009-05-21T05:02:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	I'm assuming the unionfs setup lets you kill files in the profile directory one by one? Deleting which file makes it work again? Alternatively try strace-ing firefox to see what it gets stuck on.
2009-05-21T05:02:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	i've tried that deleting file-by-file approach, but then i just ended up with it not starting at all :)
2009-05-21T05:02:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	but i'll try strace and see what happens
2009-05-21T05:03:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	that's really odd (if deleting the entire profile works so should deleting it file by file...)
2009-05-21T05:03:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	yeah.. one would assume
2009-05-21T05:04:00.000Z	mzz	zamba	there's a .parentlock in there you might've missed, but I wouldn't expect that to cause this. Or it might be the directory or profiles.ini, but I don't see how that could be either.
2009-05-21T05:04:00.000Z	zamba	mzz	i tried that file as well
