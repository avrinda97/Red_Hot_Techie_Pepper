2012-01-05T09:13:00.000Z	smeding		hi everyone, question. running oneiric, updated today and my sound just broke. i'm having trouble diagnosing the issue, seems everything is fine at the kernel module end but goes wrong somewhere between there and pulseaudio
2012-01-05T09:15:00.000Z	smeding		it's an Intel HDA chip, used to work fine before, i can see stuff in /proc/asound/ that makes sense... aplay -l sees no soundcards
2012-01-05T09:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*
2012-01-05T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	wait 5 seconds or so after the command completes, then run:  alsamixer  and ensure all levels are cranked and unmuted, the command doesn't output anything if that's what you mean
2012-01-05T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	sound is nothing to do with the WM
2012-01-05T09:17:00.000Z	smeding	ActionParsnip	alsamixer still cannot open my mixer device
2012-01-05T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	fair enough :)
2012-01-05T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	ok can you give the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh; chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh; ./alsa-info.sh

2012-01-05T09:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	does the system have a make and model or is it a home build?
2012-01-05T09:22:00.000Z	smeding	ActionParsnip	home build, yeah
2012-01-05T09:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure  try the oneiric command there
2012-01-05T09:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	don't add the ubuntu-desktop package, you don't really need it
2012-01-05T09:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	you can stop it if it's at the download stage
2012-01-05T09:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	oh, is it installing now>?
2012-01-05T09:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	and connection apparently too, what you on 100Mb ;)
2012-01-05T09:27:00.000Z	smeding	ActionParsnip	40 :)
2012-01-05T09:28:00.000Z	smeding	ActionParsnip	i get this: E: Internal Error, No file name for libasound2
2012-01-05T09:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	looks like the disk helps, I'm on 50 and its not that fast
2012-01-05T09:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	install apt-fast from ppa, makes updates flyyyyy
2012-01-05T09:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smeding	remove it from the command :)
2012-01-05T09:40:00.000Z	smeding	ActionParsnip	interesting, it worked... but it introduced some weird graphics corruption
