2007-08-31T08:53:00.000Z	Ashfire908		what text-based web broswers are there?
2007-08-31T08:53:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	 elinks, w3m, lynx
2007-09-19T09:15:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	wan != uplink. uplink emulates a crossover cable to my knlodge
2007-09-19T10:06:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	 you can edit those in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
2007-09-19T10:06:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	nothing happens
2007-09-19T10:07:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	you need shift as well
2007-09-19T10:07:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	 not in my gnome :] 
2007-09-19T10:07:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	sorry it's "0xea" and "0xe9"
2007-09-25T08:22:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	that gets overwritten if you use dhcp
2007-10-07T14:18:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	script, alias or function.   alias command="some other command"
2007-10-07T14:18:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	what is the difference between them
2007-10-07T14:19:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	alias would normally be for something simple, function a little more complex, script more complex still.
2007-10-07T14:21:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	i don't have the man for alias or function
2007-10-07T14:21:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	man builtins  for alias - it's a bash builtin command
2007-10-07T14:22:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	for functions probably read the bash scripting howto
2007-10-07T14:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	is alias global?
2007-10-07T14:23:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	you can put it in /etc/bash.bashrc  to make it global
2007-10-07T14:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	is function global do would i have to do the same
2007-10-07T14:24:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	were you talking to me?
2007-10-07T14:24:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	yes.  a function would also have to be put in /etc/bash.bashrc
2007-10-07T14:31:00.000Z	wastrel	Ashfire908	apt-get source packagename
2007-10-07T14:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908	wastrel	where will it put it
