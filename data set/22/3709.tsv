2008-06-19T09:42:00.000Z	rglo		make sure all your sound levels are turned up, mortis
2008-06-19T09:43:00.000Z	genii	rglo	Why not just state the problem you are experiencing and then see if anyone has suggestions
2008-06-19T09:46:00.000Z	genii	rglo	In the physical arrangement of your equipment is it something like internet->modem->computer            or internet->modem->router computer     or some other thing. Because some modems are in bridged mode and do not assign numbers, rather the computer logs on directly to the internet provider.
2008-06-19T09:49:00.000Z	genii	rglo	Are there other machines on the switch which work correctly?
2008-06-19T09:49:00.000Z	rglo	genii	yes...this computer just stopped after three weeks of not being booted
2008-06-19T09:50:00.000Z	genii	rglo	Cabling good?
2008-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	genii	rglo	eg: lights on switch indicates cable is connected
2008-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	rglo	genii	yes hardware is all fine.
2008-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	genii	rglo	Which adapter name is it and does it have some entry in /etc/network/interfaces             or not
2008-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	genii	rglo	Add under auto eth0                            iface eth0 inet dhcp
2008-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	genii	rglo	If you bypass the switch does it work?
2008-06-19T10:02:00.000Z	rglo	genii	no it doesn't work directly either
2008-06-19T10:04:00.000Z	genii	rglo	OK. My first suspect was long cabling. I had this issue when I setup a box and tested it directly on router...worked. Then put a switch and ran a 150metre line to it, where it also worked on the cached dhcp info til I had it powerd off a week. Where after it refused to get an IP
2008-06-19T10:05:00.000Z	rglo	genii	that would make sense.  it is a long cable.  How did you fix the prob?
2008-06-19T10:08:00.000Z	genii	rglo	I cut the ends and replaced the plugs in standard EIA568B order of the wires. Seems the cable had been wired with wires in same order on each end which is OK for short runs but you need precise order for the signal not to degrade over twisted pair for realy long runs.
2008-06-19T10:08:00.000Z	genii	rglo	The order was arbitrary on the original plugs
2008-06-19T10:10:00.000Z	genii	rglo	OK I'll be here a bit longer
2008-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	genii	rglo	I need to sleep soon. Any joy/enlightenment yet?
2008-06-19T10:29:00.000Z	genii	rglo	In case you need it for wiring reference: http://www.surrey.ac.uk/eng/Intranet/ict/support/UTP.HTM      I have to go, 6 hours til alarm goes off here
2008-06-19T10:44:00.000Z	rglo	genii	You're one smart cookie.  Saved me a bunch of hair that I would have pulled out.  THANK YOU!!!
2008-06-19T10:44:00.000Z	genii	rglo	np :) Glad to help
2008-06-19T10:45:00.000Z	genii	rglo	Gotta go sleep now :) Enjoy
