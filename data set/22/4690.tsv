2007-11-03T22:13:00.000Z	brandon		I'm on dapper
2007-11-03T22:14:00.000Z	brandon		anyway, back to the problem, why is it saying my C compiler cannot make executables?
2007-11-03T22:16:00.000Z	brandon		I installed gcc
2007-11-03T22:16:00.000Z	brandon		E: Couldn't find package build-essentials
2007-11-03T22:17:00.000Z	brandon		by how much I mean the size, btw
2007-11-03T22:18:00.000Z	brandon		>_<
2007-11-03T22:18:00.000Z	brandon		that would take a while
2007-11-03T22:19:00.000Z	brandon		E: Couldn't find package build-essentials
2007-11-03T22:20:00.000Z	brandon		gosh
2007-11-03T22:20:00.000Z	brandon		6.06 is extremely limited, isn't it?
2007-11-03T22:20:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	just out of date by now
2007-11-03T22:09:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	Do you need to compile?
2007-11-03T22:15:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	You could follow this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=127090 -- but i'd suggest updating to a newer version of ubuntu
2007-11-03T22:15:00.000Z	brandon	balanceofcowards	I plan to, but I lost my CD
2007-11-03T22:15:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	you cannot compile, because no compiler is installed by default
2007-11-03T22:16:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	you need the build-essentials package
2007-11-03T22:16:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	you do not need a cd to upgrade - you can upgrade over internet
2007-11-03T22:16:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	may be called build-essential - not sure
2007-11-03T22:17:00.000Z	brandon	balanceofcowards	how, and how much is the download
2007-11-03T22:18:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	can't tell you exactly - you'd have to go 6.06->6.10->7.04->7.10 - depends on your config, but i'd say at least a Gigabyte
2007-11-03T22:18:00.000Z	brandon	balanceofcowards	yeah, on dialup
2007-11-03T22:18:00.000Z	balanceofcowards	brandon	granted, that sucks - better get a new cd then
