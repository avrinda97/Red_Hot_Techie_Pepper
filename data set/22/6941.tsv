2006-06-19T11:27:00.000Z	gomek		there'll be a line for each terminal
2006-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	gomek		make sure it says 2345 in the runlevel column for each tty
2006-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	gomek		why are you wanting to boot into runlevel 3, anyway?
2006-06-19T11:29:00.000Z	gomek		i950?  is that intel?
2006-06-19T11:30:00.000Z	gomek		ah, automatix afaik has nvidia and ati
2006-06-19T11:30:00.000Z	gomek		intel should work fine on its own...
2006-06-19T11:31:00.000Z	gomek		don't think so...i haven't gotten an update notification
2006-06-19T11:31:00.000Z	gomek		go to their website
2006-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	gomek		it's "dyndns"
2006-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	gomek		i don't think that is one of the options
2006-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	right dyndns... what website?
2006-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	dyndns.org?
2006-06-19T11:33:00.000Z	gomek	bioticpro	that sounds right
2006-06-19T11:33:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	I already signed up with them... Im confused here what is needed to make this work
2006-06-19T11:38:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	so you signed up with both dyndns.com and no-ip.com to accomplish easy remote access to a non-static ip computer?
2006-06-19T11:39:00.000Z	gomek	bioticpro	nah, just dyndns
2006-06-19T11:39:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	ok, Im signed up with them, services...
2006-06-19T11:42:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	what ip address do I put in?
2006-06-19T11:43:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	that wouldn't work though, that would be the ip address of the computer I am on right now
2006-06-19T11:43:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	I am trying to connect to a remote computer, from this computer, by ssh, and I need some way to point to the ip address of the remote computer each time it changes
2006-06-19T11:47:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	the address of the other computer changes every time it logs on... how will that help?
2006-06-19T11:58:00.000Z	bioticpro	gomek	yes, I installed a clinet program on the other computer, that has the domain name I got from dyndns in it
