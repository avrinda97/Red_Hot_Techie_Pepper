2006-06-08T09:22:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		Haven't found any good ones on Linux.
2006-06-08T09:22:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		I normally use Wine+mIRC.
2006-06-08T09:23:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		su root.
2006-06-08T09:23:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		but sudo works best.
2006-06-08T09:25:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		It will show you how to set up a user and have them as bncadmin and etc etc.
2006-06-08T09:25:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		It's quite good.
2006-06-08T09:25:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		holy crap.
2006-06-08T09:25:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		ok, I'm running a gdm update.
2006-06-08T09:25:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		It tells me that I need to kill all X sessions.
2006-06-08T09:26:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		But how do I kill all X sessions without stopping Synaptic from closing?
2006-06-08T09:26:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	you can't. are you sure it says you "need" to, or is it just telling you that gdm changes won't be applied until you do close all x sessions? (I suspect the latter, in which case you are fine)
2006-06-08T09:27:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	then when you're finished with synaptic and other stuff, just log out and hit ctrl-alt-backspace at the gdm screen and it will restart :)
2006-07-28T08:24:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	it's lost nothing, open a terminal and do whatever you want
2006-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	Ng	I know you can do that, but I'm saying that the GUI is now being preferred over command line.
2006-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	for some people, sure. I still do as much as I can in a terminal because I think it's quicker
2006-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	being able to do things both ways seems like a win-win :)
2006-07-28T10:17:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	patience is a virtue
2006-07-28T10:17:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	Ng	I have no patience for ignorance.
2006-07-28T10:17:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	perhaps you shouldn't be supporting inexperienced users then
2006-07-28T10:18:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	Ng	I have nothing against inexperienced users. I have something against inexperienced users that fail to listen to anything I tell them.
2006-07-28T10:18:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	then don't help them, but being rude to them is very much against the ubuntu spirit and code of conduct
2006-07-28T10:18:00.000Z	Ng	Concord_Dawn	evidently you do
