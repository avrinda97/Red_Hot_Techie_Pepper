2010-08-29T20:53:00.000Z	RickiiBETA		can someone help me with changing my default folders?
2010-08-29T20:54:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	What are your default folders?  I can help you change them if I know what they are.
2010-08-29T20:56:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Just rename them?
2010-08-29T20:56:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	What is the issue here?
2010-08-29T20:56:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Move them?  click and drag
2010-08-29T20:57:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	They're not special for any reason.  They're just folders with those names.
2010-08-29T20:58:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	What?  They reference themselves?
2010-08-29T20:58:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Like I said before.  There is nothing special about those folders.  I deleted all of them on my system and I organize using my own system.
2010-08-29T20:58:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Yes is that it?  What Jeandre said?
2010-08-29T20:59:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	mmmm I see.  If you want a folder to show up in placed and on the left side of folder windows just drag it there.
2010-08-29T20:59:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Ubuntu Tweak is intentionally confusing for some reason.
2010-08-29T21:00:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Those folders are not special.  Delete them.  No other app cares about their existence.
2010-08-29T21:00:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Then go to the downloads folder on the other drive and click and drag that folder onto the left side of the window with the other places folders.
2010-08-29T21:01:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Excellent
2010-08-29T21:01:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Sorry about the confusion.  I don't like ubuntu tweak for that very reason.
2010-08-29T21:01:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	I recommend people just learn how to tweak there systems without that silly thing.
2010-08-29T21:01:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	:)  It took me a while to figure it out too.
2010-08-29T21:02:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	That is unnecessary as well IMHO
2010-08-29T21:02:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Just let people use the damn folders!
2010-08-29T21:02:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	:)
2010-08-29T21:03:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	it is ;)
2010-08-29T21:05:00.000Z	edbian	RickiiBETA	Yep.  Linux is great! :)
