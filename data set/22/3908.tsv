2008-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	have you tried the "Repair" options?
2008-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	if you have a hardy cd then it has a repair option, intrepid should have it to but not so sure about that
2008-11-02T08:25:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	I guess you could also copy your /home/<username> folder (including all the hidden files) and then copy it in the new intrepid install
2008-11-02T08:26:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	you need your /home/<username> folder and that should backup most of your settings. However this may cause issues in intrepid
2009-01-11T09:21:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	have you tried any of those in the list?

2009-02-26T14:12:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	why do you need safari?
2009-02-26T14:12:00.000Z	Uplink	ziroday	cause safari 4 owns chrome and firefox together
2009-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	well then nope, you won't get safari with native speeds for linux. Sorry.
2009-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	ziroday	Uplink	feel free to ask apple to support linux.
