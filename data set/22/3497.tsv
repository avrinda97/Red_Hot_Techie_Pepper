2009-08-26T07:27:00.000Z	mralexandro		when i type in emerald --replace it changes to desired window theme, but i can not keep it after restart. any sugestion?
2009-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	Make emerald boot on startup in System -> Preferences -> Settings
2009-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	well there is no settings under preferenses, do you mean settings inside emerald program?
2009-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	no, no, System -> Preferences - > Session
2009-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	add "emerald --replace" to that
2009-08-26T07:31:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	can not find session under preferences either
2009-08-26T07:32:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	hmm, they may have removed that in recent builds. And I can't even check now, because I'm on Windows. :(
2009-08-26T07:32:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	heh ok:)
2009-08-26T07:36:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	after installing os x theme, i think it became a emerald theme by default. because when i restart it has the maximize minimize and close at the left side. any idea how i did that ? cause i can not remember how i did it:)
2009-08-26T07:37:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	that's how the theme works, I guess.
2009-08-26T07:37:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	yeah but i have complete changed it out, there was a different theme, different icons and a diferente emerald theme. so is it ubuntu default to have it on the left side. i dont think it is?
2009-08-26T07:38:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	hmm ok. thanks for the help anyway:)
2009-08-26T07:38:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	np, sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
2009-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	if i write metacity --replace, remove the emerald --replace from the startup. will i be booted with a default ?
2009-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	should do.
2009-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	alright, but what excactly do metacity --replace do?
2009-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	it launched metacity (the standard window manager), replacing whatever is already running.
2009-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	nice, thanks for calrification
2009-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	no problem :)
2009-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	 did not work. the close minimize maximise is still on left side. hmmm. could it be anything else i need to do?
2009-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	MenZa	mralexandro	I'm afraid I have no idea.
2009-08-26T07:53:00.000Z	mralexandro	MenZa	ok:)
