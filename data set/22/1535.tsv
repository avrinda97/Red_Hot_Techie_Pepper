2010-04-28T21:50:00.000Z	bushbaby		I'm running Apache on my Ubuntu server and accessing localhost or the IP from the server is fine, however, when accessing it from another remote box I get variable connections with time-outs, and now it has failed to open at all. Can anyone give me a pointer as to where I may correct this? [Ubuntu 9.10] Anyone?
2010-04-28T21:51:00.000Z	geekphreak	bushbaby	i would check if ip is correct and perm. is ok
2010-04-28T21:51:00.000Z	geekphreak	bushbaby	will check port number too , make sure its using default 80 :)
2010-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	yes. ip is correct and permenant. Port is also correct.
2010-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	geekphreak	bushbaby	 permisson set ok , readable?
2010-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	It was working well a few hours ago..

2010-04-28T21:55:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	yes
2010-04-28T21:55:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	the exact message in firefox? (using firefox to connect)
2010-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	"The Connection has timed out The server at #my ip(correct i checked with ifconfig)# is taking too long to respond. The site could be temporarily unavailable. Try again in a few moments. etc etc (Other suggestions like network settings and firewalls (both ok))
2010-04-28T21:58:00.000Z	geekphreak	bushbaby	hope you are not using internal ip , you have to use external ip
2010-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	yes i'm using external ip.
2010-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	geekphreak	bushbaby	port 80 open in router?
2010-04-28T22:00:00.000Z	geekphreak	bushbaby	 port forwarding and all that good stuff
2010-04-28T22:00:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	yes. It was working before so i wouldn't have thought it would have changed?
2010-04-28T22:01:00.000Z	geekphreak	bushbaby	hmm true , did you do anything update , uninstall anything ?
2010-04-28T22:01:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	i tried setting up an ftp server on the same system using proftpd. and them removed it I can't think of anything else?

2010-04-28T22:03:00.000Z	bushbaby	geekphreak	yes, though i'm quite new to irc so not sure how it works.. heh..
