2006-10-27T05:24:00.000Z	simtower		hello, vmware is broken by ubuntu 6.10... anyone know a fix?
2006-10-27T05:25:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	define "broken" please
2006-10-27T05:25:00.000Z	simtower	reiki	infinite loop consuming all cpu on startup
2006-10-27T05:25:00.000Z	simtower		/usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware: /usr/lib/vmware/lib/libpng12.so.0/libpng12.so.0: no version information available (required by /usr/lib/libcairo.so.2)
2006-10-27T05:25:00.000Z	simtower		output on the console
2006-10-27T05:25:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	did you reinstall VMware from scratch? Or was this a 6.06 to 6.10 upgrade?
2006-10-27T05:26:00.000Z	simtower		i installed vmware server on 6.06 and then upgraded to 6.10
2006-10-27T05:26:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	you almost definitely need to reinstall vmware. We talking VMware workstation?
2006-10-27T05:26:00.000Z	reiki		oh.. server
2006-10-27T05:26:00.000Z	simtower		no, vmware server
2006-10-27T05:26:00.000Z	reiki		same same
2006-10-27T05:27:00.000Z	simtower		i did the update script to add the kernel modules but i will try a full reinstall
2006-10-27T05:27:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	I am preparing to upgrade 6.06 to 6.10 and one of the things on my list post-upgrade is reinstall VMWare as I know it will need to be done
2006-10-27T05:27:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	remember you'll need the kernel sources to reinstall
2006-10-27T05:28:00.000Z	simtower		it used the kernel sources already to update the modules
2006-10-27T05:28:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	please let me know how a reinstall works as if VMWare won't work I may have to postpone upgrading to Edgy
2006-10-27T05:30:00.000Z	simtower	reiki	I will let you know in five minutes... i am in trouble if it doesn't because my homework for today is on a VM ;)
2006-10-27T05:31:00.000Z	reiki		!ubuntuguide
2006-10-27T05:36:00.000Z	simtower	reiki	certainly it doesn't work without some screwing around... after uninstalling the old vmware and then trying to install new, it says "a previous installation has been detected. failure. execution aborted."
2006-10-27T05:37:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	ack.... I have always just reinstalled over the old one
2006-10-27T05:37:00.000Z	simtower	reiki	i tried that first, it also choked
2006-10-27T05:38:00.000Z	reiki	simtower	ok...well this is not good news so far
