2009-08-14T01:08:00.000Z	Some_Person		I have 2 ubuntu machines and an ethernet cable. How can I get files from one to the other?
2009-08-14T01:09:00.000Z	Some_Person		I have a cheap laptop form last year and an old desktop from 2002
2009-08-14T01:11:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	just plug the cable into both computers, and do tail /var/log/dmesg
2009-08-14T02:11:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	whats the problem that you're having? if I recall correct, you're trying to transfer files between two computers directly connected with an ethernet cable?
2009-08-14T02:11:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	That's what I want to do
2009-08-14T02:13:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	Both machines have IP addresses on the same subnet?
2009-08-14T02:13:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	I don't know
2009-08-14T02:15:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	back to basics, I suppose.  Make sure that one of your cards can do auto-crossover
2009-08-14T02:15:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	I have no idea
2009-08-14T02:18:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	from the laptop: traceroute ip_of_desktop
2009-08-14T02:18:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	 you may not have traceroute installed, if you don't, sudo apt-get install traceroute
2009-08-14T02:19:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	E: Couldn't find package traceroot

2009-08-14T02:22:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	can you pastebin the output of ifconfig /all from both machines?
2009-08-14T02:22:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	The desktop has no internet
2009-08-14T02:24:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	/all: error fetching interface information: Device not found
2009-08-14T02:26:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	is that from the desktop?
2009-08-14T02:26:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	both
2009-08-14T02:27:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	ifconfig will suffice :)
2009-08-14T02:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	from the laptop: http://paste.ubuntu.com/252774/
2009-08-14T02:28:00.000Z	firecrotch	Some_Person	is it the same except for the IP address on the desktop?
2009-08-14T02:30:00.000Z	Some_Person	firecrotch	The desktop has no IP
