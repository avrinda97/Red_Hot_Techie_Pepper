2011-06-08T01:44:00.000Z	rootarindam		Hi, I'm a new ubuntu user and have few questions
2011-06-08T01:45:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	shoot
2011-06-08T01:50:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	You want to remove winXP and keep ubuntu? But you installed ubuntu inside winXP?
2011-06-08T01:55:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	Well, if you installed inside winXP, that is what is supposed to happen. You are now dual booting winXP and ubuntu.
2011-06-08T01:56:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	So is it possible to delete xp and have ubuntu alone?
2011-06-08T02:00:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	take a look at this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How%20do%20I%20migrate%20to%20a%20real%20partition,%20and/or%20get%20rid%20of%20Windows%20entirely?
2011-06-08T02:01:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	looking now .......thanx
2011-06-08T02:06:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	Do you remember if you used the WUBI installer? I'm pretty sure you did, but just to make sure.
2011-06-08T02:08:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	Honestly, I don't remember...............I went to ubuntu download page, clicked the download button and followed the instrucion
2011-06-08T02:09:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	But you were in windows when you installed ubuntu?
2011-06-08T02:09:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	yes
2011-06-08T02:09:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	I guess you can check in your add/remove programs if you see WUBI anywhere, just to be sure
2011-06-08T02:10:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	add/remove in xp?
2011-06-08T02:10:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	yep
2011-06-08T02:11:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	yes I'll check.....but is it possible without Wubi?
2011-06-08T02:13:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	Well, you can only install from inside windows using wubi AFAIK, but I was just asking just to make sure. I'm positive that you used wubi to install but you can never be too sure. If you check your add/remove programs in XP you should se "Ubuntu" listed. That's how you know you used wubi.
2011-06-08T02:13:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	also few days ago when I opened xp after 1.5 months I observed it has become extremely slow........ubuntu runs fast though
2011-06-08T02:14:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	yes I saw ubuntu in add/remove
2011-06-08T02:15:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	Okay, you're good to go. Just the read through that site I sent you.
2011-06-08T02:17:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	also few days ago when I opened xp after 1.5 months I observed it has become extremely slow........ubuntu runs fast though
2011-06-08T02:18:00.000Z	OctoByte	rootarindam	VIRUSES!!! lol, I'm not sure why your XP is slow but it shouldn't be caused by ubuntu, I think...
2011-06-08T02:19:00.000Z	rootarindam	OctoByte	thanx a lot for your help!
