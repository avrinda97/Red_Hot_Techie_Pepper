2007-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	Mine worked out of the box
2007-04-29T07:54:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	BS, how can you have aac support work when its been disabled
2007-04-29T07:54:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	I use mp3, it does not have to be mp3
2007-04-29T07:54:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	er, doesn't have to be aac*
2007-04-29T07:55:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	trust, Ive just spent 3 hours getting ubuntu working with an ipod, ooh now I want to edit the tags, sorry disabled in all the libs compile from scratch
2007-04-29T07:57:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	there are other programs for tag editing, but seriously, whine more. if ubuntu isn't good enough for you, dont go whine to people on the support channel, go back to gentoo.
2007-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	Look, you are complaining about ubuntu not working for you in your way.  I use easytag for tag editing.  It works just fine.  If you want it to work your way, go back to gentoo
2007-04-29T08:00:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	hah, very funny, one problem, easytag has also been cripples and need recompiling, yes Im doing it now
2007-04-29T08:01:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	how is it "crippled"
2007-04-29T08:02:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	MP4/AAC file support disabled
2007-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	then convert to mp3, it works just fine.  most people use mp3 instead
2007-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	I can download the codecs but none of the tools will work with them
2007-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	its video
2007-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	ahh, that I will agree is something that is still being worked on.  The support for video is not all that great.
2007-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	yeah, tell me about it, I can play anything but i cant do anything with it
2007-04-29T08:05:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	also video transcoding is a nighmare, yep all disabled
2007-04-29T08:05:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	No... it's not.  I haven't had a problem converting video of any type in linux
2007-04-29T08:06:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	well I have a generic script for transcoding, guess what distro is the only one that cant do it because hmm its been disabled in the libs
2007-04-29T08:06:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	ffmpeg, transcode, or mencoder can convert any type of video I've come across
2007-04-29T08:06:00.000Z	squee	Linux_Galore	whine more, learn how to use the apps to convert them yourself
2007-04-29T08:06:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	nope, ffmpeg has xvid and aac disabled so does mencoders back ends libs
2007-04-29T08:07:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	squee	I know how to use the apps, I even wrote an script to do it all, just Ubuntu has all the stuff crippled
