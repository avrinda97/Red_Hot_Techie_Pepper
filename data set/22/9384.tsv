2004-11-19T14:10:00.000Z	nimc		where to i change the forced fsck every 30 mounts on boot to a higher number?
2004-11-19T14:11:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	man tunefs
2004-11-19T14:11:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	if i were you i would leave it like that
2004-11-19T14:11:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	just don't reboot your system :-)
2004-11-19T14:11:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	or switch to XFS (lovely)
2004-11-19T14:13:00.000Z	nimc	lemsx1	there's no tunefs command on man........ ?
2004-11-19T14:14:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	tune2fs ?
2004-11-19T14:14:00.000Z	nimc	lemsx1	thanks, that exists
2004-12-01T09:49:00.000Z	nimc	lemsx1	totem-xine i meant
2004-12-01T09:49:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	check under Advanced preferences for multimedia sinks
2004-12-01T09:49:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	gstreamer lets you choose your output sinks and so on
2004-12-01T09:50:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	uh, that's a different beast ... i don't know that
2004-12-01T09:51:00.000Z	nimc	lemsx1	i dont think i have these advanced prefs.... anyone else knows maybe?
2004-12-01T09:51:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	that's part of gstreamer-*
2004-12-01T09:52:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	Applications->Preferences->Advanced->Multimedia System Selector
2004-12-01T09:52:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	definitely not Xine
2004-12-01T09:52:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	you might want to see what can you do from a .xinerc or something (all UNIX apps are like that)
2004-12-01T09:53:00.000Z	nimc	lemsx1	which movie formats does gstreamer support ? i think none ?
2004-12-01T09:53:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	gstreamer is a framework... as many as you want to install (and have been written) ... it's not as stable as xine, so, don't worry about it for a year or so
2004-12-01T09:54:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	install all the gstreamer libs anyway, they are nice to have
2004-12-01T09:54:00.000Z	nimc	lemsx1	any movie codecs have been written for gstreamer yet ?
2004-12-01T09:56:00.000Z	lemsx1	nimc	i'm not sure, but you might want to read gstreamer-devel mailing list (i'm a member and i see all kinds of tricks being done for encoding movies from C/comand line etc...)
