2005-03-27T17:51:00.000Z	racingcamel		i might not have been clear, i manually installed apache 1.3(no apt) the aptitude purge command did not uninstall it
2005-03-27T17:51:00.000Z	racingcamel		what else could i try?
2005-03-27T17:53:00.000Z	racingcamel		well actually
2005-03-27T17:54:00.000Z	racingcamel		here is the problem
2005-03-27T17:54:00.000Z	racingcamel		i installed apache on accident with the zend IDE and now whenever i goto localhost apache 1.3 is used instead of apache 2 which i already had installed.
2005-03-27T17:55:00.000Z	racingcamel		I just want to delete it.
2005-03-27T17:55:00.000Z	racingcamel		should i delete all of the directories that are called apache?
2005-03-27T17:57:00.000Z	racingcamel		how can i log in as root so i dont have to do the deleting via the console?
2005-03-27T17:57:00.000Z	racingcamel		giving root a pass is 'sudo -s -sH' correct?
2005-03-27T06:47:00.000Z	racingcamel		i have been attempting to manually remove the apache 1.3 server from my machine and have successfullt removed nearly every file except for the icons and am wonder why when i goto localhost in my browser it still comes up as apache but without the fancy page, just an error. How can i get this demon of an apache web server off my machine?
2005-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	apache is probably still loaded in memory, /etc/init.d/(service) stop
2005-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	/etc/init.d/apache(tab) stop
2005-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	must have gotten removed
2005-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	sudo killall apache
2005-03-27T06:53:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	best to use "apt-get --purge remove app" to get rid of stuff you no longer want installed
2005-03-27T06:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	what command are you passing to firefox ?
2005-03-27T06:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	what port I guess I am asking
2005-03-27T06:55:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	do top and see if you can see any apache related processes running
2005-03-27T06:56:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	try clearing your browser cache
2005-03-27T06:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	^^
2005-03-27T06:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	re-install apache then apt-get --purge remove apache
2005-03-27T06:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	racingcamel	other than that I don't know what to tell you :P
