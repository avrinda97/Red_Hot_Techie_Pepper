2010-01-18T16:34:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	gksu nvidia-settings
2010-01-18T16:35:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	ya, that's what I'm using to configure it... as i said it works fine when I do it manually, but for some reason once the settings are saved and X is restarted the monitors are treated as separate screens
2010-01-18T16:36:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	in a terminal type gksu nvidia-settings
2010-01-18T16:37:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	it only seems to bring up the nvidia-settings utility? or does it do anything different?
2010-01-18T16:37:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	reset ya settings...now they stick
2010-01-18T16:40:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	doesn't work, still being treated as separate monitors :-/
2010-01-18T16:42:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	after starting in terminal.... enable second monitor select primary click on that the configure/twinview
2010-01-18T16:43:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	youve done it before.... just do that after starting in terminal with gksu
2010-01-18T16:43:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	twinview is working, but it's acting differently to when I set it up manually... its treating both monitors as separate screens instead of one long screen
2010-01-18T16:44:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	cloned of seperate
2010-01-18T16:44:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	cloned or seperate
2010-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	not seperate then if ya draging windows from one to other...
2010-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	ya, as i said its working in twinview but not the same as when I do it manually
2010-01-18T16:47:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	sounds to me like a twinview type of rig.... not seperate
2010-01-18T16:48:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	so why isn't my desktop background image appearing on both screens? and why aren't apps perfectly in sync for the resolution
2010-01-18T16:49:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	im thinking A. you are unable to configure the software or B. youve been messing with other methods of twinview/mods or C. typo
2010-01-18T16:50:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	or D; twinview manual configuration works differently to X auto-started twinview configuration
2010-01-18T16:52:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	its pretty solid i thought.... up in twinview now. just the one issue.... no seperate desktop background images :(
2010-01-18T16:53:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	apart from pasting two images together.... pez
2010-01-18T16:55:00.000Z	perlmonkey	iflema	i've just compared my desktop settings to when I use twinview in auto-started config and manual config... and there's a clear difference: on auto-started it has two monitor settings tabs (monitor 1 and monitor 2) allowing independent desktop background images, however on manual config if I click on desktop there's only 1 monitor settings area, i.e. its treating both screens as one desktop
2010-01-18T16:57:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	manually??? xorg.conf editing is manually. i just wanna know.... what happens when you in a terminal type gksu nviddia-settings.. ok do you see two little screens?
2010-01-18T17:16:00.000Z	iflema	perlmonkey	pastebin ya xorg.conf
