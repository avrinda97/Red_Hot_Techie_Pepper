2010-08-08T01:25:00.000Z	ubunt1		Hello? I have a problem with the resolution selection dialogue.
2010-08-08T01:26:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	Have you checked for any hardware drivers? (System->Administration->Hardware Drivers)
2010-08-08T01:27:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	It says I don't need any (if I clicked in the right place).
2010-08-08T01:28:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	What is the problem with the Resolution Dialog?
2010-08-08T01:28:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	I don't have any options besides 640x480. I am using a very old version of ubuntu and I want to also get actualizations, but I have another problem with that.
2010-08-08T01:29:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	What resolution is your monitor?
2010-08-08T01:29:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	1024x768, but it used to run fine with 1280x760 in Windows.
2010-08-08T01:30:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	Hmm.. I used to have that problem but usually it was a Driver that wasn't installed.
2010-08-08T01:30:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	Do you think getting a driver from my motherboard for Linux coudl solve the problem?
2010-08-08T01:31:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	I don't really think so, I am not an expert on this by any means but I think it would be a problem with the graphics card, not the motherboard
2010-08-08T01:32:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	My graphic card is onboard.
2010-08-08T01:32:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	Oh, then yes you could try.
2010-08-08T01:32:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	Or try running update manager and see if that works
2010-08-08T01:33:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	I tried, and wish I could get some updates, but I get errors there too.
2010-08-08T01:33:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	What kind of errors>
2010-08-08T01:34:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	It says I the repository might no longer be available. It starts downloading a list of files, but every and each of them fails.
2010-08-08T01:35:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	Try running 'sudo apt-get update' in terminal (without the quotes of course)
2010-08-08T01:36:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	Loads of errors and nothing downloaded. I think it's happening because I tries to download from the br.archive.ubuntu.com server, hence my system language.
2010-08-08T01:37:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	That might be it, though I am sorry but I do not know much more about your situation.
2010-08-08T01:37:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	Is there anyway to switch my update server?
2010-08-08T01:39:00.000Z	mrman208	ubunt1	Yes! I just found something, go to system > administration > software sources, and click Download From, and choose other and go to United States and find one there
2010-08-08T01:57:00.000Z	ubunt1	mrman208	duffydack, guntbert: Thank you all, actually. A lot.
