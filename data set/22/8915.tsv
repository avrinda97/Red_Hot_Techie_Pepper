2005-04-23T14:50:00.000Z	mishof		problem- I have no sound in games ... but I hear sound fine on xmms,xine and other desktop programs ..
2005-04-23T14:52:00.000Z	mishof		=(
2005-04-23T14:53:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	i bet it's esd blocking the sound device
2005-04-23T14:55:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	edit /etc/esound/esd.conf
2005-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	auto_spawn=1, and spawn_options=-terminate -nobeeps -as 2
2005-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	mishof	topyli	ill try - what will it do?
2005-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	esd will die when nothing requests for it, freeing the sound device. when something wants esd, it will respawn
2005-04-23T14:59:00.000Z	mishof	topyli	- thanks!
2005-04-23T14:59:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	IIRC you need to at least logout, maybe more. i don't think mine worked before a reboot (i don't know what needs resetting)
2005-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	nobody knows what sort of file that is. filenames don't necessarily tell much on linux
2005-05-07T05:47:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	that's gtksourceview's business
2005-05-07T05:47:00.000Z	mishof	topyli	what ? i want to add prolog syntax highlight, thats all :'(
2005-05-07T05:47:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	yes, so you make gtksourceview aware of that
2005-05-07T05:48:00.000Z	mishof	topyli	how do i do that ?
2005-05-07T05:48:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	studdy the xml files in /usr/share/gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs
2005-05-07T05:49:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	come on, the files are well structured
2005-05-07T05:50:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	that's what they told me on #gnome-hackers when i was lamenting about missing sh support :)
2005-05-07T05:50:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	then i started hacking, but somebody beat me to it
2005-05-07T05:50:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	there isn't one. you'll write it
2005-05-07T05:50:00.000Z	mishof	topyli	im pretty sure there is, since it worked under kde :|
2005-05-07T05:53:00.000Z	mishof	topyli	maybe there is a way to make an xml file out of the emacs specification or the one used for kde?
2005-05-07T05:57:00.000Z	topyli	mishof	when i started looking at it, i found the vim syntax files easier to understand
