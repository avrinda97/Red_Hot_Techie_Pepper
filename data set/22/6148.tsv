2007-01-10T15:51:00.000Z	n2diy		I surf with this box, but I have a box in the basement, can a use a router and cable to share the connection with the box in the basement?
2007-01-10T15:51:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	With a switch or a hub rather than a router, but yes.
2007-01-10T15:52:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	I can't use my router?
2007-01-10T15:53:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	Well, your router is probably a switch as well as a router.  They generally are, but technically there is a difference.
2007-01-10T15:53:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	How many ethernet sockets does it have?
2007-01-10T15:53:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	ok, let me give it a try, after getting ping and ssh working, whatt software should I be looking at?
2007-01-10T15:54:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	four, plus one for a modem, which I'm not using.
2007-01-10T15:55:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	You are not using the one for the modem?  So is the internet access through a different router?
2007-01-10T15:55:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	I'm accessing the internet through my dialup modem on this box.
2007-01-10T15:58:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	I cannot remember exactly the details, but what you want is "ip forwarding".  I'm trying to look it up now ...
2007-01-10T15:59:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	roger that.
2007-01-10T16:00:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	I was hoping I could do it with VNC?
2007-01-10T16:00:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	What is running on the two machines?
2007-01-10T16:00:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	OSs.
2007-01-10T16:00:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	Ubuntu 6.06 on both of them.
2007-01-10T16:01:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	Well, you could use ssh instead of vnc.  ;-)  But anyway, you shouldn't need to do that.
2007-01-10T16:02:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	When you have connected the machines, try pinging each other.
2007-01-10T16:04:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	Well, the next step is "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward", but I don't know if that is all you need to do.
2007-01-10T16:05:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	roger that, let me set up the network and give it a try, thanks.
2007-01-10T16:06:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	That command will set ip forwarding up once only, but if it works there is a way to do it each time at bootup.
2007-01-10T16:12:00.000Z	jhaig	n2diy	You still there?  I found this, which you may find useful: http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/01/how-to-enable-ip-forwarding-in-linux/
2007-01-10T16:12:00.000Z	n2diy	jhaig	roger, thanks.
