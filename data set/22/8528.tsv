2007-03-10T14:39:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	you can not change kernel on the live cd. but you can after you've installed the system (or create your own live cd somehow)
2007-03-10T14:39:00.000Z	maggi	Jowi	this is what i did...
2007-03-10T14:41:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	try with and without initrd
2007-03-10T14:42:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	no it is a temp filesystem
2007-03-10T14:44:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	you said you got panic.
2007-03-10T14:45:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	so it works fine on your installed system but not when burned to cd?
2007-03-10T14:45:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	that is a tad stranger.
2007-03-10T14:49:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	you might want to try it on a different pc. or do you have only modules included that fits the machine you're on now? might be specific to your hardware somehow..
2007-03-10T14:50:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	you get any more info other than "panic.."?
2007-03-10T14:51:00.000Z	maggi	Jowi	message: "/init: .: 124: Can't open /scripts/caspar"
2007-03-10T14:52:00.000Z	maggi	Jowi	the only error showing up..
2007-03-10T14:57:00.000Z	Jowi	maggi	I've never used caspar. No idea what that is about.
