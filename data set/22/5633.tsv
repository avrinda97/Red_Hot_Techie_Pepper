2008-12-16T01:48:00.000Z	cactux		Good evening
2008-12-16T01:49:00.000Z	cactux		Is it possible to watch movie with gthumb?
2008-12-16T01:50:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	...why?
2008-12-16T01:50:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	because gthumb displays the icon of a movie
2008-12-16T01:51:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	heh. no, it's not able to play movies
2008-12-16T01:51:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	that's not true
2008-12-16T01:52:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	extracting a frame and decoding in real-time are completely different tasks
2008-12-16T01:52:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	if there are several files in a directory,, such as .jpg, .avi .gif and .txt : gthumb displays icons or thumbnails for images and movie, not for the text file
2008-12-16T01:53:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	make your icons bigger
2008-12-16T01:53:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	I do think that this is not correct
2008-12-16T01:53:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	???
2008-12-16T01:53:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	the icon size has nothing to do here
2008-12-16T01:54:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	iirc, konqueror and dolphin (kde file browsers) only showed text previews if the icons were large enough
2008-12-16T01:55:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	this part is ok with gthumb
2008-12-16T01:57:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	let me summarize. when there are several file types in a folder, gthumb displays icons for the file types it "manages" (.jpg, .gif), and do not display the other (.txt). That's ok
2008-12-16T01:58:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	for .jpg, .gif and other images, it displays a thumbnail. Fine. A double-clic will open them big. Great.
2008-12-16T01:58:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	the problem is for .avi : it does not hide them, so it should handle them, right? but a double-clic does nothing
2008-12-16T01:59:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	um, playing the files has nothing to do with gthumb, though
2008-12-16T02:00:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	ok, then why does gthumb displays an icon for .avi files, if it is not able to handle them?
2008-12-16T02:00:00.000Z	cactux	raylu	anyway, thx for your help
2008-12-16T02:00:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	...
2008-12-16T02:01:00.000Z	raylu	cactux	again, displaying an icon and playing the video are totally unrelated
