2007-03-17T14:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	i'm pretty sure last time i installed it, it was just kde
2007-03-17T14:30:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	I can assure you it is, and always has been, kubuntu-desktop.
2007-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	so whatis the kde package in synaptic?  kde...... The K Desktop environment official modules
2007-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	That's a small component of it.
2007-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	but when i choose to install it, it installs all dependencies, programs, etc.
2007-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	... that's the point.
2007-03-17T14:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	i guess i'm missing the point, what do you mean?
2007-03-17T14:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	it installs all the applications
2007-03-17T14:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	Your point? That's the ideal situation.
2007-03-17T14:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	i guess i'm trying to figure out why mine says kde.... and yet you recommended kde-desktop.
2007-03-17T14:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	I recommended kubuntu-desktop.
2007-03-17T14:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	everyti8me i've installed kde using apt-get kde.., i got a zillion programs with it, it was definitely kubuntu in its entirety
2007-12-23T16:54:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	Other way around.
2007-12-23T16:55:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	Are you sure you're not reading it the wrong way around?
2007-12-23T16:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	either way, it should b equal amounts....
2007-12-23T16:55:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	Why?
2007-12-24T06:08:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	... what a useless answer. Please don't give that answer.
2007-12-24T06:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	its not useless at all.
2007-12-24T06:09:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	It is about as counterproductive as one can get.
2007-12-24T06:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Fujitsu	well, what can i say, i always compile pidgin, and mine is working fine on 3 pc's
2007-12-24T06:59:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	I don't get what you're saying.
2007-12-24T07:03:00.000Z	Fujitsu	IndyGunFreak	I know..
