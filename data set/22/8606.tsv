2007-10-19T21:27:00.000Z	Doitle		I just got a .tar.gz file of Drivers for my wireless card and I am wondering how to install them?
2007-10-19T21:29:00.000Z	Doitle		RTL8187
2007-10-19T21:29:00.000Z	Doitle		Realtek
2007-10-19T21:30:00.000Z	Doitle		Realtek RTL8187
2007-10-19T21:30:00.000Z	jer_	Doitle	- is that an answer to my question?
2007-10-19T21:31:00.000Z	Doitle		No Jer, it's directed to Tovella
2007-10-19T21:31:00.000Z	jer_		k
2007-10-19T21:32:00.000Z	jer_	Doitle	- Do you know how to fix a sound card? My realktek ALC861 isn't working. Just barely any sound, and it sounds like it's coming from inside the computer. I tried toggling with volume control, and strangely on Konsole, the master volume doesn't even have a bar, just mute/unmute.
2007-10-19T21:32:00.000Z	Doitle		It sounds like its coming from inside o_O? Like it is outputting to your system speaker
2007-10-19T21:33:00.000Z	Doitle	tovella	Ok, will do
2007-10-19T21:33:00.000Z	Doitle	tovella	The card is the Realtek Wireless Lan RTL8187
2007-10-19T21:33:00.000Z	jer_	Doitle	- Yeah. Very bizarre. It's like it's using that system speaker instead. When I had Ubuntu 7.04 it did the same thing, until I installed all the updates/patches. But when I installed Ubuntu 7.10 it started doing this again.
2007-10-19T21:33:00.000Z	Doitle		Jer are you sure you have drivers for your soundcard?
2007-10-19T21:34:00.000Z	Doitle		Tovella: I just upgraded to the newest gibbon one, but it didn't work in fawn either
2007-10-19T21:34:00.000Z	jer_	Doitle	- I'm really not sure. I imagine that the updates/patches included the drivers. Where would I go to find a driver for realtek, if that's what I need?
2007-10-19T21:35:00.000Z	Doitle		Tovella: Part of the Kernal?
2007-10-19T21:35:00.000Z	Doitle		Jer: What card do you have specifically?
2007-10-19T21:35:00.000Z	Doitle		Tovella: So It should already work?
2007-10-19T21:35:00.000Z	jer_	Doitle	- Realtek ALC861 (OSS Mixer), so it says.
2007-10-19T21:36:00.000Z	Doitle		Tovella: Odd...
2007-10-19T21:37:00.000Z	Doitle		Jer: http://www.opendrivers.com/company/2358/realtek-free-driver-download.html <--- That appears to have a linux driver for your card
2007-10-19T21:37:00.000Z	jer_	Doitle	Jotil, thankyou . . . Let me check out the links.
