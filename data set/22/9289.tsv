2005-03-16T10:21:00.000Z	dr_willis		the inital users password is also the root/sudo password.
2005-03-16T10:23:00.000Z	dr_willis		it asks for the main users password.. and sets that as the default sudo password also.. simple. :P
2005-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	dr_willis		Hmm
2005-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	dr_willis		ubuntu uses rpms ? i dident think so
2005-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	dr_willis		or am i confused here..
2005-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	drspin	dr_willis	it uses DEB as opposed to RPM
2005-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	drspin	 yea - heh heh - i thogh so.. :P  but i test out sooo many different disrtos..
2005-05-06T10:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	drspin	 heh -   "As with most other [CLI] ? applications in linux,   "     why not use the term "As with most other commands"  :P and not toss in another 3 letter anacron.
2005-05-06T10:12:00.000Z	drspin	dr_willis	because CLI is a REALLY commonly use acronym -- why shelter from the common... that's why there's a link to create a new page from that...
2005-05-06T10:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	drspin	 actually its just phrased oddly. :P   lets see reading along.. :P      $ cat /proc/ide/hda/settings     --> ya need to be root to do this  it seems.
2005-05-06T10:13:00.000Z	drspin	dr_willis	correct you do - thanks :)

2005-05-06T10:50:00.000Z	drspin	dr_willis	I will try it on Wednesday when I have some time to tinker with it
2005-05-06T10:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	drspin	 just got the rpm,s and tried alien.. has a glibc issue.. and the 'fix' mentioned in the blogs - mention a non-existing file.. trying the source now.
2005-05-06T10:51:00.000Z	drspin	dr_willis	oooh lemme know if it's that sumple :)
2005-06-02T12:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	drspin	 i think theres a keybinding you can do to get it out.

2005-06-02T12:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	drspin	 in the keybinding menu config :P
