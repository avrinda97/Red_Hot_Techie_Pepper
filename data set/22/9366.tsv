2004-12-22T16:40:00.000Z	wood1		Hmm, good to see a warty_girl in a Ubuntu chat forum
2004-12-22T16:40:00.000Z	wood1		That's surprising. Women using Linux too
2004-12-22T16:41:00.000Z	wood1		Well most Women do care about which Operating System they use
2004-12-22T16:42:00.000Z	wood1		Well in my company which has more than 1000 staffs which has more than 400 women, only the guys uses Linux.
2004-12-22T16:43:00.000Z	wood1		Anyway, that' very good sign
2004-12-22T16:45:00.000Z	wood1		Hum, that's a good thing
2004-12-22T16:45:00.000Z	wood1		Well people in your CyberCafe must have inquired why MSN Messenger looks a bit funny
2004-12-22T16:46:00.000Z	smo	wood1	I have a small front-end for gaim written in mono, so that they're presented simply with user/pass/service  (it writes out an accounts.xml then launches gaim).  it looks different, but it's easier than trying to maintain aim/yahoo/msn on a windows machine
2004-12-22T16:47:00.000Z	wood1	smo	 How long have you been running your Cyber Cafe ?
2004-12-22T16:48:00.000Z	smo	wood1	it's been there 2 years .. I've only been onboard this summer  (and warty's been there for the last 6 weeks)
2004-12-22T16:49:00.000Z	smo	wood1	Yes, that's what was there when I got there
2004-12-22T16:50:00.000Z	smo	wood1	they were previously outsourced (maintanance) thru a local IT firm.  the machines were frankly a mess.  about a third could actually sign-on to msn, most but not all could print, one was infected with something that was attempting to send emails twice every second.
2004-12-22T16:51:00.000Z	smo	wood1	So I presented a slightly modified LiveCD that just behaved, and didn't require expensive bolt-on software to keep windows sane
2004-12-22T16:52:00.000Z	wood1	smo	why didn't you use a Strong Anti-Virus and a Firewall Software for your cafe ?
2004-12-22T16:53:00.000Z	smo	wood1	Because the problems are deeper than that on public terminals.  You want no persistant settings at all, etc.
2004-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	wood1	smo	how is your Cafe setup now ?
2004-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	smo	wood1	Simply put, a LiveCD in each machine.  Atleast until their contract with the 3rd-party firm runs dry
2004-12-22T16:57:00.000Z	smo	wood1	modified slightly to include java/flash/mplayer-plugin, but it makes a great public terminal.  the worst damage they can do is steal a 5-cent cdr
2004-12-22T17:02:00.000Z	wood1	smo	I got your point
2004-12-22T17:02:00.000Z	smo	wood1	It came with the machines
2004-12-22T17:15:00.000Z	smo	wood1	For perspective, you said you had around 1000 staff?  This is a small indy coffee shop with 4 fulltime staff & 1 schoolkid for random evenings
2004-12-22T17:16:00.000Z	smo	wood1	The kind of place where paying 40-60 USD per hour for someone to de-gunk windows does make an impact
