2005-12-15T17:44:00.000Z	czr		but you should look deeper
2005-12-15T17:44:00.000Z	czr		but two displays
2005-12-15T17:44:00.000Z	czr		although I had some trouble with x.org recognizing the crt/dvi combo in a different order yesterday
2005-12-15T17:45:00.000Z	czr		I installed ubuntu on my main computer finally (debian/unstable+hybrid shit broke very badly)
2005-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	czr		I agree, it's a problem
2005-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	czr		but that's why distros should do the hard work
2005-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	czr		could be nice to have an unified driver system, but I have a bad feeling that ain't going to happen while I'm alive
2005-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	czr		and I'm planning on being alive for quite some time still
2005-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	czr		doesn't doom3 support linux directly?
2005-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	czr		why would you need wine?
2005-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	docta_v	czr	yes it does. using wine would be...foolish
2005-12-15T17:50:00.000Z	czr	docta_v	you only need /boot for old bioses and for booting LVM-rooted systems
2005-12-15T17:50:00.000Z	docta_v	czr	there's always cedega
2005-12-15T17:50:00.000Z	czr	docta_v	can't be bothered with that
2005-12-15T17:51:00.000Z	czr	docta_v	you use it
2005-12-15T17:51:00.000Z	docta_v	czr	no :)  but it's good
2005-12-15T17:52:00.000Z	czr	docta_v	what do you base your second-hand opinion on then?
2005-12-15T17:52:00.000Z	docta_v	czr	i don't even use a linux desktop i just like to troll on here
2005-12-15T17:52:00.000Z	czr	docta_v	you're evil :-)
2005-12-15T17:52:00.000Z	docta_v	czr	i've heard good things about it and it's list of supported games is impressive
2005-12-15T17:53:00.000Z	czr	docta_v	good to know before I spend many hours trying to figure out what went wrong with it :-)
2005-12-15T17:54:00.000Z	czr	docta_v	you know whether cedega 'supports' ubuntu?
