2007-10-01T12:41:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	XChat is the best client so far...xchat gnome is xchat with no options
2007-10-01T12:41:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	what you mean by options?
2007-10-01T12:42:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	like...any options beyond the most simple
2007-10-01T12:43:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	for example now i see the typings but when u msg me all the rest will fade and urz will be highlighted and so i feel only 2 people is in chat
2007-10-01T12:45:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	well i donno about that option but...i know that xchat gnome was irritating, no userlist even
2007-10-01T12:45:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	theyr is a user list its just you didnt know how to use it
2007-10-01T12:46:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	i guess, i just prefer regular xchat without any of the config stripped out
2007-10-01T12:46:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	my configs are indicated
2007-11-16T10:01:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	try apt-get install wacom-tools
2007-11-16T10:01:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	you have a touchscreen/
2007-11-16T10:01:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	no i just have a regular wacom tablet
2007-11-16T10:02:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	btw wacom is hp? or compaq?
2007-11-16T10:02:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	i dno, i thot wacom was wacom
2007-11-16T10:02:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	yea...but wacom made the touchscreen
2007-11-16T10:02:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	:D
2007-11-16T10:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	cuz thats what they make ;)
2007-11-16T10:03:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	then i need wacom-tools
2007-11-16T10:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	it might help, i never heard of touch-screen + ubuntu tho, it might be unsupported
2007-11-16T10:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	esp if its really new, and a little exotic
2007-11-16T10:04:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	many people like touchscreen for private purposes
2007-11-16T10:04:00.000Z	Crozar	Evanlec	example , presentation
2007-11-16T10:22:00.000Z	Evanlec	Crozar	amen
