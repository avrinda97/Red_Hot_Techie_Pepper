2005-09-02T12:52:00.000Z	cemc		it's running gdm,
2005-09-02T12:53:00.000Z	cemc		and i want to connect to the X server from another computer
2005-09-02T12:53:00.000Z	cemc		X -query host
2005-09-02T12:53:00.000Z	cemc		not really,
2005-09-02T12:53:00.000Z	cemc		that works
2005-09-02T12:53:00.000Z	cemc		with vnc
2005-09-02T12:53:00.000Z	cemc		i want to connect directly to the X server
2005-09-02T12:54:00.000Z	cemc		there is some protocol for this,
2005-09-02T12:54:00.000Z	cemc		XDMCP,
2005-09-02T12:54:00.000Z	cemc		you can connect to it, and log in through X
2005-09-02T12:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	cemc	i'd recommend hoary instead of breezy, unless you're just messing about
2005-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	cemc	HappyFool	in fact, i'm just messing around, but i don't see why it's not working ;)
2005-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	cemc	(this is hoary, may be same for breezy): look in system -> admin -> login screen setup
2005-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	cemc	there's and xdmcp tab there
2005-09-02T12:55:00.000Z	cemc	HappyFool	lemme check
2005-09-02T12:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	cemc	if i recall correctly, this stuff is in gdm.conf, somewhere under /etc/X11/
2005-09-02T12:56:00.000Z	cemc	HappyFool	yepp
2005-09-02T12:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	cemc	i'm afraid i can't help much more; it's been a year since i played with xdcmp, and to be honest breezy could be broken in weird ways
2005-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	cemc	i think pfp is right; look at 'man apt.conf'
2005-09-02T13:28:00.000Z	cemc	HappyFool	i will, no prob... the package manager in gnome uses apt ?
2005-09-02T13:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	cemc	yip; synaptic is an apt front-end, and i'm pretty sure the 'add software' doodad is also an apt frontend
2005-09-02T13:29:00.000Z	cemc	HappyFool	pfp: ok, i'll try
