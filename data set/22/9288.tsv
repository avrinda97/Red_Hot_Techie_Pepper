2009-11-06T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 thes a xml file in the same dir as they are...  it controlls the details from my exploreations :)

2009-11-08T17:04:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	will look into
2009-12-19T01:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 its not real imporntant
2010-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	that is a neat trick!
2010-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 :)
2010-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	time to alias that one
2010-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 yep thats my 'ShowDisks' alias
2010-03-10T17:46:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	gnome-screensaver doesn't handle power stuff
2010-03-10T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 no.. thats the job of the power saver stuff
2010-03-10T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 did you unset it and then log out/back in?
2010-03-10T17:56:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	no, I didn't imagine I needed to, since you can set/change the setting without logging out
2010-03-10T17:57:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	oh, yes, I have actually
2010-03-10T17:57:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	not specifically for that reason, but I have restarted a few times since I tried disabling it via gnome-network-properties
2010-03-10T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 i would like to see how one app can change a allready running terminals Enviromental variables with out beung ran by that terminsl
2010-03-10T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 other then that - ive no idea. I dont use proxys much. Ive never even noticed the http_proxy variable getting set
2010-03-10T17:59:00.000Z	aperson	Dr_Willis	dang, I knew I managed to unset it once before
2011-04-19T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 compare the set command output in and outside of a screen session perhaps. :)
2011-04-19T17:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 i thought screen emulated a VT100 or Xterm
2011-04-19T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 i get 'screen' here. :)
2011-04-29T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	aperson	 bash is expanding the variables once vs twice i think
