2010-03-17T14:15:00.000Z	ddrj		how do i install from here? http://github.com/daymun/rtorrent-webui-installer do i do svn checkout http://urlhere ?
2010-03-17T14:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	you use git i'm sure github has some tutorial in its web
2010-03-17T14:22:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	so would i use the git merge command after installin git ?
2010-03-17T14:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	"git pull <url>" to get the sources
2010-06-23T00:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	see the routing table ?
2010-06-23T00:40:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	how do you do that?
2010-06-23T00:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	« ip route » ?
2010-06-23T00:41:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	they're showing me two wlan's, one is wlan1 and another is wlan0, it says default is via wlan0
2010-06-23T00:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	there you go internet is via wlan0
2010-06-23T00:42:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	right but wlan0 is connected via the built in wifi card or the usb wifi card? how do i know?
2010-06-23T00:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	lshw -C Network | less
2010-06-23T00:44:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	ah crap, it's using my builtin wifi card (wlan0.. which is faulty), is there a way to assign wlan1 preference over wlan0 ?
2010-06-23T00:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	why not use the laptop facilities to just disable the card ( added bonus it want draw power). many laptops have a key combo or switch to disable wifi
2010-06-23T00:46:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	well, i want to disable the built in wireless card in the laptop and only use the usb wifi card, is that possible to do with ubuntu?
2010-06-23T00:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	as i said doing that depends on hardware on most laptops
2010-06-23T00:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	they usually have a button to turn off/on the wifi
2010-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	hm... yes, weird part is... when i turn off the wifi button on the laptop, the usb card doesn't work x(
2010-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	maybe it acts on both...
2010-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	try with the rfkill command
2010-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	ddrj	erUSUL	hmm... yeah... i got an idea tho.. what about disabling it via bios? if that doesn't work, i'll try rfkill
2010-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	or blacklist the internal wifi driver
2010-06-23T00:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	ddrj	kesroesweyth suggestion is sound too
