2008-01-24T07:10:00.000Z	tdnnash26		I screwed mine up and haven't been able to find anyone that is using 6.06
2008-01-24T07:10:00.000Z	tdnnash26		I just need a default adduser.conf to past into mine ... with the hopes of fixing what I messed up.
2008-01-24T07:12:00.000Z	unop	tdnnash26	you could download the source for !adduser and extract the default adduser.conf
2008-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	tdnnash26	unop	 except that I'm a newbie and don't know how ... sorry
2008-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	unop	tdnnash26	at a terminal --  apt-get source adduser
2008-01-24T07:14:00.000Z	unop	tdnnash26	that would download the source and extract it into the current folder
2008-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	tdnnash26	unop	 root@lampsrv:/home# apt-get source adduser
2008-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	tdnnash26		Reading package lists... Done
2008-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	tdnnash26		Building dependency tree... Done
2008-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	tdnnash26		Need to get 190kB of source archives.
2008-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	tdnnash26		Get:1 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com dapper/main adduser 3.80ubuntu2 (dsc) [651B]
2008-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	tdnnash26		Get:2 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com dapper/main adduser 3.80ubuntu2 (tar) [189kB]
2008-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	unop	tdnnash26	never paste in here
2008-01-24T07:16:00.000Z	unop	tdnnash26	you still here?
2008-01-24T07:16:00.000Z	tdnnash26		yeah
2008-01-24T07:16:00.000Z	tdnnash26		I just did this:  aptitude install source adduser  ... and it appears to have done something
2008-01-24T07:17:00.000Z	tdnnash26		sec
2008-01-24T07:18:00.000Z	tdnnash26		nice ... "aptitude install source adduser" from the /etc directory fixed my problem!
2008-01-24T07:18:00.000Z	tdnnash26		Thanks guys, I gotta go get my kids to bed
2008-01-24T07:18:00.000Z	tdnnash26		l8r
2008-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	unop	tdnnash26	yes, it seems to have downloaded the source -- add user is at - adduser-3.103ubuntu1/examples/adduser.local.conf.examples/adduser.conf
2008-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	unop	tdnnash26	what you did there was reinstall adduser -- and you could have done that from anywhere -- not just in /etc
