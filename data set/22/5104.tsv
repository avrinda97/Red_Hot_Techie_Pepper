2007-07-22T07:32:00.000Z	threethreethree		Please, anyone? I have no access to official Ubuntu repositories or the official websites. Is anyone else experiencing these issues? I can access all other websites without any problems
2007-07-22T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	threethreethree	which repos?
2007-07-22T07:33:00.000Z	threethreethree		all of the default ones
2007-07-22T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	threethreethree	Well, 'default' varies depending on your location
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		i can access google's and other third party repos but none of the ones provided with the distro, these include:
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-security main restricted
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-security main restricted
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-security universe
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-security universe
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-security multiverse
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-security multiverse
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		deb http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/ stable non-free
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	Flannel	threethreethree	You don't need to paste.  Simply 'archive.ubuntu.com' wouldve sufficed
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		oops, minus that last google one
2007-07-22T07:34:00.000Z	threethreethree		sorry, i am inexperienced
2007-07-22T07:36:00.000Z	threethreethree	Flannel	any advice?
2007-07-22T07:37:00.000Z	Flannel	threethreethree	you might try switching to a different mirror, us.archive.ubuntu.com, see if that helps
2007-07-22T07:38:00.000Z	threethreethree		ok, i will try that, thank you
2007-07-22T07:41:00.000Z	threethreethree	Flannel	no luck with those mirrors. Still says I cannot resolve. It appears it is a DNS issue from the error messages but I can resolve most any other site.
2007-07-22T07:46:00.000Z	threethreethree		so i take it no one else is experiencing my same issues then
2007-07-22T07:52:00.000Z	Flannel	threethreethree	How about the IP itself?  Uh, ubuntu.com is... 82.211.81.158
2007-07-22T07:56:00.000Z	threethreethree	Flannel	I can successfully ping the IP you provided
