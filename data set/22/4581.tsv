2008-02-12T23:04:00.000Z	AlexQ		Hey...! Can anybody help me? I've got an laptop, Acer TravelMate 5710. Sound works correctly on the build-in speakers, but the standard "green" speaker-out doesn't work. I don't know how to fix it - in the ALSA MIXER I've got only: Master, PCM and Digital in "Capture". Build-in microphone doesn't work too... But camera works good.
2008-02-12T23:05:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	Are you sure the speakers work and that the output works on windows and such?
2008-02-12T23:05:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	Speaker works, but I do not know anything about output.
2008-02-12T23:06:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	did you try searching google? I've never heard of anything like this happening.
2008-02-12T23:06:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	Let's look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55765/ - log from alsamixer.
2008-02-12T23:08:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	bad news, it seems that there is a bug with that chipset that disables internal and external mic. However, no info on the speakers yet.
2008-02-12T23:09:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	So, what I have to do?
2008-02-12T23:09:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	as of right now, nothing... I'm still looking for your speakers right now
2008-02-12T23:09:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	Are there any adv. settings?
2008-02-12T23:10:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	sorry, no. It's a bug with the driver, and unless you want to write it yourself, you just have to wait for a fix.
2008-02-12T23:10:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	however, if you know C, I've been told it's not too hard to write drivers.
2008-02-12T23:11:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	I know C++ a really little...
2008-02-12T23:11:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	But, are you sure? How do you know it?
2008-02-12T23:11:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	sorry, but your probably just going to have to wait for a fix then. It's documented here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Gutsy_Intel_HD_Audio_Controller
2008-02-12T23:14:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	Ok, thx for all. but what with the OSS? Does it use the same driver?
2008-02-12T23:15:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	as far as I know, yes.
2008-02-12T23:15:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	I'll try on Vista...
2008-02-12T23:15:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	Thx for all.
2008-02-12T23:18:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	But try to do that: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/AcerTravelmate6292?

2008-02-12T23:19:00.000Z	{Nathan}	AlexQ	that seems to be able to solve your speaker problem, I'd try that.
2008-02-12T23:20:00.000Z	AlexQ	{Nathan}	OK, that sounds cool, THX ;).
