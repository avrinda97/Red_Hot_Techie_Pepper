2009-06-30T23:26:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	The open source driver is called "ati" and can be found in the "xserver-xorg-video-ati" pacakge
2009-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	peteforsyth_	edbian_	Thanks!! That's very helpful. Do I need to uninstall the restricted driver somehow first?
2009-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	You can use the modprobe command to insert / remove modules (drivers) in the kernel.
2009-06-30T23:28:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	for example: "sudo modprobe -r fglrx"
2009-06-30T23:28:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	Removing the package will ensure that your system will choose the other driver at boot time though.
2009-06-30T23:28:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	No errors?
2009-06-30T23:29:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	Good :).  Now simply install the package I mentioned earlier and "sudo modprobe ati"
2009-06-30T23:30:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	It might be "sudo modprobe radeon" I can't remember.  Which ever one doesn't error out.
2009-06-30T23:31:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	you can use "modprobe -l" to check what modules are loaded.  Combine it with the grep command to make things quicker.  I don't usually mess with xorg.conf
2009-06-30T23:32:00.000Z	peteforsyth_	edbian_	What should I grep for? ati?
2009-06-30T23:33:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	try "radeon"
2009-06-30T23:33:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	You are using the open source radeon driver right now :)
2009-06-30T23:34:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	Isn't that what you wanteD?
2009-06-30T23:34:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	How is your GUI not working?
2009-06-30T23:34:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	What type of card are you using?
2009-06-30T23:37:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	Trying googling?
2009-06-30T23:37:00.000Z	peteforsyth_	edbian_	any thoughts on that? I'mpretty stumped, have spent hours googling and experimenting...but I'm not much of a linux guru, just follow instrux as best i can
2009-06-30T23:38:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	Maybe it's a bad card?
2009-06-30T23:38:00.000Z	peteforsyth_	edbian_	Well I appreciate the help...
2009-06-30T23:38:00.000Z	edbian_	peteforsyth_	Sorry I couldn't hlep more :(
