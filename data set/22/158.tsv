2012-05-10T23:49:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	have you tried killing the process before attempting to oepn up eclipse again?
2012-05-10T23:49:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	I did, then it worked again until I switched programs a couple of times, then it happened again.
2012-05-10T23:50:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	when switching applications, are you choosing 'Show Desktop' as well?
2012-05-10T23:50:00.000Z	LifeLike		there is a known bug there
2012-05-10T23:51:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	I did once, but not when it happened for the first couple of times
2012-05-10T23:51:00.000Z	marc82ch		use the very rarely.
2012-05-10T23:51:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	are you using ubuntu 12.04?
2012-05-10T23:52:00.000Z	marc82ch		yep, 12 anyways, installed a couple of days ago
2012-05-10T23:53:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	hmm I'm not sure if this is the same bug i faced in 11.10 which wouldn't show the application at all when I tried to open it AFTER using 'show desktop'
2012-05-10T23:53:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	try removing your installation of eclipse and installing it manually from eclipse.org
2012-05-10T23:54:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	have you noticed this with other applications?
2012-05-10T23:54:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	really? shouldn't the ubuntu software center installation work better?
2012-05-10T23:54:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	no, not yet
2012-05-10T23:56:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	now I unpinned it from the launcher, killed it again and started again. It started, but doesn't show in the launcher... somethings wrong here
2012-05-10T23:57:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	is this an ungrade from 11.10?
2012-05-10T23:57:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	no, fresh installation.
2012-05-11T00:01:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	Yeah remove eclipse and download a newer version of it from eclipse.org
2012-05-11T00:01:00.000Z	LifeLike		since it only seems to be eclipse that's acting this way you probably should try a different version. I've had quite a few issues with eclipse lately as well so this might be just another one of them.
2012-05-11T00:02:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	ok, I'll try, however, I thought the ubuntu software center stuff should be working smoother with ubuntu than the stuff downloaded elsewhere? Isn't that the case generally?
2012-05-11T00:06:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	the USC don't _always_ have the latest repos of the software. What I've noticed with eclipse is that when ever there is a new version of Ubuntu, eclipse gets the latest update then. After that you have to update it through their repos (i.e. Help > Check for updates) Sometimes that doesn't work either. So a fresh install is needed.
2012-05-11T00:07:00.000Z	marc82ch	LifeLike	thanks, I'll try, maybe tomorrow, it's already late and I just need to check some code, should work for now... thanks.
2012-05-11T00:08:00.000Z	LifeLike	marc82ch	np
