2007-03-09T09:55:00.000Z	wolferine		Ubuntu is a strong desktop distro, but it falls short for some users in a few areas. Where are the multimedia codecs and DVD support <-- this true?
2007-03-09T09:56:00.000Z	wolferine		oh?
2007-03-09T09:56:00.000Z	wolferine		im not making the claim
2007-03-09T09:56:00.000Z	wolferine		maybe you need to be a bit more positive in your conversation skills erUSUL
2007-03-09T09:57:00.000Z	wolferine		was surfing and found an article about it
2007-03-09T09:57:00.000Z	wolferine		they are suggesting Linux Mint
2007-03-09T09:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 i am using Linux Mint right now.. It dosent have much for it that ubuntu dosent.
2007-03-09T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 'perhaps' and not legally in some places.
2007-03-09T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 not for most people.
2007-03-09T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 ive seen a dozen people in here this week that think the 64bit version is REQUIRED for amd64 cpus...    which is false. of course...
2007-08-23T10:18:00.000Z	wolferine	Dr_willis	getting the boots?
2007-08-23T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 gotta love it. :) guess they dont want links to my  'themes' either.:) or my icon sets..
2007-08-23T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 been working on some... interesting icons lately.
2007-08-23T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 just wait for my XXXubuntu release!
2007-08-23T10:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 I have lots of friends.. You just cant see them.
2007-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	  i think you need to manuallty start swat up. I havent used it in ages.
2007-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 thers other tools that replace swat now a days.. swat has some... issues. :)
2007-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	wolferine	Dr_willis	as I said, I have restarted
2007-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 im not sure that swat even  adds itself to the boot process. you may need to 'sudo swat'
2007-09-16T06:57:00.000Z	wolferine	Dr_willis	its running, checked the port, but nothing comes up :)
2007-09-16T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 what url are you using? http://localhost or the ip?
2007-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wolferine	 check the swat logs/samba logs i guess. i find other tools better for my needs then swat.
