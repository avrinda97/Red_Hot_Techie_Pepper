2006-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	blackeyes		i didn't know external displays on laptops would be this difficult--it flickers when I boot but doesn't load anything after that
2006-04-17T08:33:00.000Z	blackeyes		what's the difference between "Monitor" and "Screen" in xorg.conf?
2006-04-17T08:34:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	In some drivers, for example, you can have a single screen spread across multiple monitors.
2006-04-17T08:34:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	A screen is a device that graphics render to, a monitor is a physical device.
2006-04-17T08:35:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	I see--is there a way to easily add or change the monitor in the xorg.conf to use an external LCD instead of a laptops internal LCD?
2006-04-17T08:35:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	That depends on the graphics driver - there is no easy, sure fire way. You'd have to read the specific driver's documentation.
2006-04-17T08:35:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	Does your laptop not a device switch?
2006-04-17T08:35:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	Or are you trying to setup dual monitor support?
2006-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	I would just like to bypass the laptop's LCD completely and use the external
2006-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	I'm using the ati driver
2006-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	The easy solution is to use the laptop switch, then.
2006-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	what is that?
2006-04-17T08:36:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	The ATI proprietary or the supplied xorg one?
2006-04-17T08:37:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	Most laptops have a button combination that will redirect the graphics to the external monitor port. It's usually like a Fn-<soething> command.
2006-04-17T08:37:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	I believe the supplied one, it loaded automatically with the installer
2006-04-17T08:37:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	I'm using a powerbook--does that matter?
2006-04-17T08:40:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	Yeah, use Fn-F2.
2006-04-17T08:40:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	Try that first.
2006-04-17T08:41:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	during boot?
2006-04-17T08:41:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	Just right now.
2006-04-17T08:44:00.000Z	blackeyes	Slant_Mobile	fn-F2 controls brightness
2006-04-17T08:44:00.000Z	Slant_Mobile	blackeyes	One of those Fns should work. Sorry that I gave the wrong one.
