2010-03-11T04:33:00.000Z	gringochapin		Hi all. questions for those with experience running a jam. How long do they usually last?  How long should they last at a minimum?
2010-03-11T04:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	what state/country are you in?
2010-03-11T04:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	I ask because the LoCo team in your area is probably going to run one.

2010-03-11T04:36:00.000Z	gringochapin		Yes, they are going to run one. I'm in Iowa. I'm helping to organize it, and no one here has much experience with them.
2010-03-11T04:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	the ubuntu-qc team is doing one let me link you.
2010-03-11T04:38:00.000Z	gringochapin		awe cool. Didn't know the QC folks were doing one.
2010-03-11T04:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	http://ur1.ca/ohmm there are no times but the last one was from 11-5 and 11-7
2010-03-11T04:39:00.000Z	gringochapin	IdleOne	That was the quebec.  Wrong country. :)
2010-03-11T04:40:00.000Z	gringochapin	IdleOne	err that was the quebec team.  I'm in Iowa.
2010-03-11T04:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	I link as an example :) but take a look here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam
2010-03-11T04:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	if you scroll down some there will be more info on how to run a jam
2010-03-11T04:41:00.000Z	gringochapin	IdleOne	Yeah, I've seen that page. But I don't see anything on there that talks about how long they usually last.
2010-03-11T04:42:00.000Z	gringochapin	IdleOne	Just wanted some idea of that from folks who have been to them.
2010-03-11T04:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	really I would say it is up to you and the people who attend, you don't want to go to many hours or you will burn out. I would say 5-6 hours per day would be good
2010-03-11T04:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	SEMI-PROTIP keep it fun :)
2010-03-11T04:43:00.000Z	gringochapin		IdoleOne: Thanks.  That's kinda' what I was thinking, but wasn't sure. We're going to only have one day, as were having a hard enough time trying a place to hold it just for one day, let alone more than that.
2010-03-11T04:44:00.000Z	gringochapin		err trying to find a place.
2010-03-11T04:44:00.000Z	gringochapin		IdoleOne: For sure. Thanks.
2010-03-11T04:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	make sure you add your jam info to the appropriate wikis :)
2010-03-11T04:44:00.000Z	gringochapin		Yeah, will do.
2010-03-11T04:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	gringochapin	you could also ask for more advice/info in #ubuntu-locoteams
