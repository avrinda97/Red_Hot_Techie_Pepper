2007-01-18T15:04:00.000Z	Wrongway		especially the screensaver, I've come home to a frozen comp too many times :P
2007-01-18T15:05:00.000Z	Wrongway		alrighty... and what is this 'free' you speak of
2007-01-18T15:05:00.000Z	ipw2200user	Wrongway	you run Windows on the same box? Any problems with other operating systems?

2007-01-18T15:06:00.000Z	Wrongway		I've only got 256megs of ram, but never had a problem with windows cuz of the large pagefile
2007-01-18T15:08:00.000Z	ipw2200user	Wrongway	a TOTAL freeze including frozen mouse? CTRL ALT BACKSPACE won't exit to a prompt?
2007-01-18T15:09:00.000Z	Wrongway		I have disabled the screensaver for a couple days now, and only learned about the ctrl-alt-backspace today in #ubuntu-ca
2007-01-18T15:10:00.000Z	Wrongway		haven't tested if the backspace thing will help yet

2007-01-18T15:14:00.000Z	Wrongway		well, currently I am over my limit of ram... so now it's using the swap partition a little bit then, eh
2007-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	Wrongway		ok, the swap partition sounds good
2007-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	Wrongway		how about the video driver updating thing that was said
2007-01-18T15:17:00.000Z	ipw2200user	Wrongway	I've booted Puppy linux and I'm surfing wirelessly without a Hard Disk! Booted off a USB, swap is RAM!
