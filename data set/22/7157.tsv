2006-06-28T11:50:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		okay...silly question then.
2006-06-28T11:51:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		I've setup (CLI ) a domain server with Samba.
2006-06-28T11:51:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		....can I install xubuntu or kubuntu on the system as a GUI for said server?
2006-06-28T11:53:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		achandra....might be easier to setup shares and the like in GUI??
2006-06-28T11:54:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		LOL
2006-06-28T11:55:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		yep
2006-06-28T11:55:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		I think it does...
2006-06-28T11:56:00.000Z	Evilscietnist		achandra....tru dat...and I think I've got it set up right...I just can't login to the bugger with windows.
2006-06-28T11:56:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	did you set up the smbuser allowed to log in to it?
2006-06-28T11:57:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	I think you might have added the so-called unix users...but did you do the smbpasswd -a  thing..?
2006-06-28T12:02:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	specifically running a tail -f /var/log/messages ... assuming that is the sysout for samba.. did you try that...you are looking for deny or whatever.. is in the log...
2006-06-28T12:02:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	that may help you debug the problem..
2006-06-28T12:04:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	did you get that?
2006-06-28T12:05:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	do you have another linux box?? or are you on windows right now
2006-06-28T12:06:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	can you ssh to the box with smb on it via putty ?
2006-06-28T12:07:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	 download putty on your windows box...a google search for it will get it for you quickly..
2006-06-28T12:08:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	cool..
2006-06-28T12:09:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	what changed things??
2006-06-28T12:12:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	whats up ??
2006-06-28T12:14:00.000Z	achandra	Evilscietnist	Samba can be setup for workgroup environments or act as primary domain controller ( its a bit more complex)....which did you set it up as??
