2007-07-08T15:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	bchunk
2007-07-08T15:03:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	bchuck can convert .bin to .iso?
2007-07-08T15:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	I believe so, I just did "apt-cache search .cue iso"
2007-07-08T15:04:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	meaning... (kinda new)
2007-07-08T15:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	I just did a quick keyword search for packages
2007-07-08T15:05:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	ahh ok.
2007-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	is super grub loader easy way to correct windows overriding grub? Cuz i still want Ubuntu as my main OS, not windows.
2007-07-11T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	I have never used super grub before, the instructions on the wiki for restoring grub aren't very hard though
2007-07-11T10:29:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	..yes, but it still gets me confused when i deal with hard drive paritioning things.. i don't really know how linux sets up HDD and whatnot
2007-07-11T10:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	You don't need to just follow the instructions, they go step by step through it
2007-07-11T14:17:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	why gksudo gparted?
2007-08-23T09:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	Do a "chmod + x whatever.bin" then ./whatever.bin
2007-08-23T09:48:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	what?? what does that do?..
2007-08-23T09:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	Or right click it, go to properties and make it executable, then double click it
2007-08-23T09:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	Makes it executable then runs it
2007-08-23T09:51:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	ok, wine trys to open it and then nothing happends. it's supposted to be for linux..
2007-08-23T09:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	Wine should not be trying to open it, did you set it to executable?
2007-08-23T09:53:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	Jordan_U	it already says type executable
2007-08-23T09:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vip3rousmango	When you right click it and go to properties, then the permissions tab, is "Allow executing file as a program" checked?
