2011-11-14T03:22:00.000Z	psychx-		How do I disable compiz in Ubuntu 11.10? And how would I re-enable it if I wanted to?
2011-11-14T03:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	Assuming you want to continue using unity, you would log out, select "Unity 2D" at the login screen, and log back in. Select just "Unity" again to go back to compiz.
2011-11-14T03:28:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	Is that the only way?
2011-11-14T03:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	No. Why?
2011-11-14T03:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	Why do you want to disable compiz in the first place?
2011-11-14T03:52:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	I want to diable compiz because everything seems to be running slow, and TeamSpeak is crashing - someone said to try disabling compiz.
2011-11-14T03:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	OK. What is wrong with the method I suggested?
2011-11-14T03:53:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	nothing
2011-11-14T03:54:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	I was just wondering if there was a better way because I have a lot of things open right now.
2011-11-17T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	Teamspeak is available in the repositories.
2011-11-17T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	sudo apt-get install teamspeak-client
2011-11-17T06:06:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	I'm not sure that is the correct version.
2011-11-17T06:06:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	I downloaded Teamspeak 3 from their website, but when I look in repositories, it says 2.0.32
2011-11-17T06:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	What is the full path to the file, including the full file name?
2011-11-17T06:12:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	/home/mike/Downloads/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_x86-3.0.1.run
2011-11-17T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	Then run "chmod +x /home/mike/Downloads/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_x86-3.0.1.run && /home/mike/Downloads/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_x86-3.0.1.run"
2011-11-17T06:13:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	Ok, do I need sudo?
2011-11-17T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	No.
2011-11-17T06:15:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	Ok, seems like it worked - thank you for the help. I might need more help in a little while, who knows. :)
2011-11-17T06:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	psychx-	You're welcome.
2011-11-17T06:17:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	Quick question. It says this in Terminal: Creating directory TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_x86   - How do I find this directory?
2011-11-17T06:18:00.000Z	psychx-	Jordan_U	nvm I actually just found it
