2009-02-18T10:28:00.000Z	pHreaksYcle		@tritium i thought it was 13+
2009-02-18T10:28:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	no
2009-02-18T10:58:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	no, but I do love animals
2009-02-18T11:03:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	yes
2009-02-18T11:08:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	you keep causing my morse code script to decode your ". . ." as "EE"
2009-02-18T11:08:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	er, ". .", rather
2009-02-18T11:08:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	no, ellipses don't have spaces in-between
2009-02-18T11:11:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	ok, but please keep it short, or on topic
2009-02-18T11:12:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	encode and decode morse code (it's an irssi script)
2009-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	nope
2009-02-18T11:14:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	just one of the scripts that comes with irssi-scripts
2009-02-18T11:14:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	ssh + screen + irssi is a very convenient combination
2009-02-18T11:17:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	Ctrl-Alt-F#, to switch to virtual console #.  Is that what you're referring to?
2009-02-18T11:18:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	nothing wrong with V.C. #1, you know
2009-02-18T11:26:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	I don't log off (part of the advantage of screen + irssi).  I can connect from anywhere via ssh.
2009-02-18T11:27:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	I'm not the only op, but I've been one since 2005
2009-02-18T11:28:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	I'm not active all the time, I just /away when I need.
2009-02-18T11:33:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	what client are you using, that puts the @ in front of each nick?
2009-02-18T11:50:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	don't repeat it!
2009-02-18T11:52:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	please be cautious recommending non-ubuntu packages
2009-02-18T11:53:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	we don't recommend them here
2009-02-18T11:54:00.000Z	tritium	pHreaksYcle	you can, but be prepared to help if they have trouble ;)
