2005-06-04T10:05:00.000Z	ligows		just wondering if you guys have a firewall. I'm thinking of getting firestarter (www.fs-security.com). Is this kind of security necessary for Ubuntu users?
2005-06-04T10:06:00.000Z	ligows		linuxjones, what features do you like?
2005-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	ligows		what features are good to have? I hear Linux is safe. So what would be the point of a firewall?
2005-06-04T10:09:00.000Z	ligows		is there a list of differences b/w the new version of ubuntuguide and the previous?
2005-06-04T10:11:00.000Z	ligows		question: get firestarter from the website or from repositories?
2005-06-04T10:11:00.000Z	darkaudit	ligows	repositories is usually better
2005-06-04T10:11:00.000Z	ligows		repositories will always have the same version as the websites?
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	darkaudit	ligows	not at all...
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	darkaudit		but that's not necessarily a bad thing, either
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	ligows		what are the advantages of getting stuff from repositories as opposed to the websites?
2005-06-04T10:13:00.000Z	ligows		thank you. thank you for your responses. Wow, the love!
2005-06-04T10:13:00.000Z	ligows		And the encouragement to stay with the repositories...
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	ligows		why then can we not have the repositories always have the most current stuff in them, as like in the websites?
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	ligows		what's iirc?
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	ligows		frozes?
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	ligows		frozen?
2005-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	darkaudit	ligows	need to keep a satble system...
2005-06-04T10:15:00.000Z	darkaudit		s/satble/stable
2005-06-04T10:15:00.000Z	ligows	LinuxJones	by "those other repositories" you mean the universe and multiverse?
2005-06-04T10:16:00.000Z	darkaudit	ligows	the release version gets frozen, then work begins on the next release... and stuff breaks early and often there...
2005-06-04T10:16:00.000Z	ligows		or are multivers and universe jus t as safe?
2005-06-04T10:16:00.000Z	darkaudit	ligows	universe and multiverse are official repositories... quite safe
