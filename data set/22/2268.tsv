2009-08-02T18:43:00.000Z	hmw		wow... i clicked on that "localhost" and now windows pop up "composing message" - this remote desktop is insane
2009-08-02T18:45:00.000Z	hmw		my remote desktop won't work, looks like firewall blocking it, but there is no active fw. any help here?
2009-08-02T18:46:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	is that through a router on or the same lan?
2009-08-02T18:47:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	same lan. the other ubuntu machine lets me in.
2009-08-02T18:47:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	standard setup. The remote desktop tells me, i can now connect via "localhost" gah
2009-08-02T18:47:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	umm, you have checked the port is open on the target machine?
2009-08-02T18:48:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	no firewall active, then I installed firestarter to be sure, doesnt help.
2009-08-02T18:50:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	so you can connect to it from another machine on the same lan?
2009-08-02T18:51:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	no, i can not connect, thats the problem, and i dont understand it, its a standard setup
2009-08-02T18:51:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	If no machine can connect i assume it is only listening on localhost
2009-08-02T18:51:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	thats what this strange remote desktop keeps telling me. why?? i want to make it correct. how?
2009-08-02T18:52:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	you would have to make it listen on your main interface, or use an ssh tunnel to forward the connection
2009-08-02T18:52:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	not really, the other ubuntu pc lets me in with the same standard setup. I must have done something very bad.
2009-08-02T18:53:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	is there a howto? a config file in /etc? something, where I can configure this thing?
2009-08-02T18:54:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	not sure, I never use remote desktop, only ssh :/
2009-08-02T18:54:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	darn, me too... i need my thunderbird
2009-08-02T18:54:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	can you use X forwarding with ssh? xD
2009-08-02T18:55:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	no, i need to connect from windows
2009-08-02T18:56:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	ahh :/
2009-08-02T18:59:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	if you run putty on windows you could set up a tunnel between the two, and leave it only listening on localhost
2009-08-02T19:00:00.000Z	hmw	zer0x	this might be one solution, but no explanation, why it crashes on one pc and not on the other, i want to be certain, it is fixed.
2009-08-02T19:00:00.000Z	zer0x	hmw	true, not sure whats happening there sry! :/
