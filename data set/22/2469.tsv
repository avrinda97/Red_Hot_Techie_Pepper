2011-08-06T18:10:00.000Z	sniya		Can I ask for help here?
2011-08-06T18:11:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	yes
2011-08-06T18:16:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	patch?
2011-08-06T18:17:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	not sure what you mean. What card do you have?  I can probably get it working
2011-08-06T18:18:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	a-ha no internet access huh :(
2011-08-06T18:19:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	This is a good guide.  I'm very familiar
2011-08-06T18:21:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	You're following the correct guide
2011-08-06T18:21:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	you have a /pool/main/b/b43-fwcutter   ?
2011-08-06T18:22:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	then run the command
2011-08-06T18:22:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	BTW, this is MUCH easier if you can get the machine online via a wire for about 10 minutes
2011-08-06T18:28:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	If you plug the wire in do the lights come on?
2011-08-06T18:28:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	ok
2011-08-06T18:29:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	Something is wrong physically
2011-08-06T18:30:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	what shows up in the output of sudo lspci | grep Network
2011-08-06T18:33:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	Yeah I know that.  Did you double click the package b43-fwcutter in /main/b/b43-fwcutter/   ?
2011-08-06T18:33:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	Don't worry about the patch.  If there isn't one I believe we won't need it.
2011-08-06T18:33:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	did it install?
2011-08-06T18:34:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	alright, do step two.  Download those things
2011-08-06T18:36:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	step 3
2011-08-06T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	what questions do you have?
2011-08-06T18:38:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	what does it say?
2011-08-06T18:40:00.000Z	edbian	sniya	ummm, I'm not sure exactly what each command does but they depend on each other.  Run them all again in order and watch more carefully for errors.  They are in /home/you/  right?
