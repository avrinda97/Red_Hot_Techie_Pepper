2010-03-09T00:26:00.000Z	funkiwan		how can i make a change to my x config if my machine doesn't use xorg.conf?
2010-03-09T00:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	just create one if you need to
2010-03-12T02:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	the later. then assing the same prio for both swap areas in fstab. the kernel will automatically "raid-0" them
2010-03-12T02:16:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	thanks for your reply. any chance you can explain the advice given on this page: http://unthought.net/Software-RAID.HOWTO/Software-RAID.HOWTO-2.html
2010-03-12T02:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	that page says exactly what i just said in the 2.3 section
2010-03-12T02:17:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	it seems to be saying to both not raid swap (first section) and then says, "Another reason to use RAID for swap..."
2010-03-12T02:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	it clearly says « There's no reason to use RAID for swap performance reasons. The kernel itself can stripe swapping on several devices, if you just give them the same priority in the /etc/fstab file. »
2010-03-12T02:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	which is what i just said too :)
2010-03-12T02:18:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	right, i agree. it's the 2nd part that confuses me.
2010-03-12T02:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	the discusion about swapping on rai1 for "high availability" ....
2010-03-12T02:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	ok; you ahve to choose performance or "high availability" then
2010-03-12T02:20:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	ah, i see. that was the bit that was confusing me. i wonder what the differenece is w/r/t performance
2010-03-12T02:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	the same difference between raid1 vs raid0 in normal data... you will writte/read faster from raid 0 (for being able to use double the bandwith) raid 1 writtes are slower (two writtes) and reads are the same speed as raid0  (simplifying things). raid0 has double the chance of failure of a single disk and raid 1 has much less chance
2010-03-12T02:25:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	firstly, thanks for answering. i'm clear on the difference between raid1 and raid0. what i'm not so clear on is how much swap performance really matters. i like the idea of high availability (my main raid1 partition is rebuilding as i type) so i'm inclined to just run swap as raid1 as well, but a) i'm wondering how much i'll slow down my machine in doing that.
2010-03-12T02:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	depends on your workloads and in the ram your machine has. with today's memory sizes system rarely swap so you wont notice one way or the other
2010-03-12T02:28:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	it's an older machine, maxed out at 2GB of ram. i do java dev work, lots of builds hitting the disk, and apps requiring lots of ram, often hitting swap, so it is a concern.
2010-03-12T02:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	then it is up to you to decide i'm afraid. you know the pross an cons... but dunno disk (raid or not raid) is so slow compared to ram that maybe the extra speed is not really that noticiable
2010-03-12T02:31:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	thanks for your input!
2010-03-12T02:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	no problem
2010-03-12T02:58:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	any chance you can help me debug my current raid setup?
2010-03-12T02:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	funkiwan	weak chances; i do not run a raid myself... maybe #ubuntu-server has more people
2010-03-12T02:59:00.000Z	funkiwan	erUSUL	thanks for the rec. will try.
