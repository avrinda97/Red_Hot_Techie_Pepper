2012-02-12T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	did you update them from nvidia.com /
2012-02-12T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	don't need that
2012-02-12T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	did you get the nvidia drivers from nvdia.com ?
2012-02-12T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	where did you get them /
2012-02-12T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	ok - a 3rd party PPA, that's not something that is supported
2012-02-12T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	PPA's are made by people/groups that take ownership for the stability and support of their software
2012-02-12T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	no idea, it depends what they change doing the install, this is part of the risk of using a PPA
2012-02-12T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	following random webpages isn't the best approach
2012-02-12T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	using official ubuntu resources is always the best method
2012-02-12T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	your system may not be in a usable state now after using external software
2012-02-12T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	standard config changes may not work depending on what the 3rd party software has change
2012-02-12T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	sure
2012-02-12T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	nug700	there is also info on https://help.ubuntu.com
