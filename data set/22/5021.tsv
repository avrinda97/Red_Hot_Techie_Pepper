2008-01-10T00:41:00.000Z	PurpZeY		I can try that
2008-01-10T00:43:00.000Z	PurpZeY		How do I use fuse?
2008-01-10T00:44:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	lemme see if i can find a decent tutorial
2008-01-10T00:44:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	Have you been following our thread, I can try to explain really simply what I am doing
2008-01-10T00:44:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/10/28/how-to-mount-a-remote-ssh-filesystem-using-sshfs/ that should get you started
2008-01-10T00:45:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	no i haven't
2008-01-10T00:46:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	I have all of my mp3s mounted at /media/hard disk/ on desktop. I want to play them on laptop.
2008-01-10T00:46:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	yeah, exactly
2008-01-10T00:46:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	you'll want sshfs, or set up samba with a share
2008-01-10T00:47:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	Well, I'll try it this way. . .if it fails, Samba it is
2008-01-10T00:47:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	ssh is not very fast cuz of the encryption
2008-01-10T00:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	Not fast enough for my purposes?
2008-01-10T00:49:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	i'm sure it would be, yes.. i think you can get ~1-2mb/s on your standard network
2008-01-10T00:51:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	InvisiblePinkUni: sshfs is nice cuz it uses the pam auth (or ldap if you ahve that set up) and doesn't require another user-set.. also, you have access to the system like you're on it.. with samba you have to have many mount points or share the entire disk
2008-01-10T00:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	If there is a space in the dir name should I enter it exactly or use %20 ?
2008-01-10T00:59:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	fuse: failed to exec fusermount: Permission denied
2008-01-10T00:59:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	you need to be part of the fuse group, and you have to log out/in again
2008-01-10T01:00:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	I think I am...I will do it again to make sure...me being, myself on the host machine?
2008-01-10T01:01:00.000Z	KlrSpz	PurpZeY	on the local machine trying to mount... after you add yourself to a group, you still have to log out and back in, or run "newgrp" (which is only valid fo rthat terminal session, and not supported afaik)
2008-01-10T01:02:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	Ok, I see now, I think I might have failed to do that properly, I will make sure and get back.... InvisiblePinkUni: I was just looking at that now, helping to clear up the user issue
2008-01-10T01:05:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KlrSpz	I added the user and I know it's proper b/c I check w/ CLI using adduser $USER now I am getting: remote host has disconnected
