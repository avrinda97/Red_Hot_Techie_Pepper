2010-02-18T05:05:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	how did you lose usage of grub?
2010-02-18T05:05:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	Ah,.
2010-02-18T05:06:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	using the desktop CD?
2010-02-18T05:06:00.000Z	Sweat	dabaR	i googled into this link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297261 post 9
2010-02-18T05:09:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	I see...
2010-02-18T05:09:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	So it does not boot into ubuntu after a normal install with the desktop CD?
2010-02-18T05:10:00.000Z	Sweat	dabaR	No, using ubuntu server
2010-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	an ubuntu server CD? And it won't boot, right?
2010-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	OK, so try hd(0,1), and hd(0,2)
2010-02-18T05:11:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	you have only one HD in the computer, right?
2010-02-18T05:13:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	just cause it has 2 hard disks, that does not mean it is hd(0,)
2010-02-18T05:14:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	and you don't get a grub boot menu at start?
2010-02-18T05:17:00.000Z	Sweat	dabaR	so where do i need to edit it in grub?
2010-02-18T05:19:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	when you boot, you should be able to get to an grub boot menu editor.
2010-02-18T05:19:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	so, edit it.
2010-02-18T05:19:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	I mean, it is somewhat almost unlikely that you will be able to fix what the installer could not configure, IMHO
2010-02-18T05:20:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	what are the lines? Can you post it to pastebin?
2010-02-18T05:20:00.000Z	dabaR	Sweat	if you can read it, you could type it...
