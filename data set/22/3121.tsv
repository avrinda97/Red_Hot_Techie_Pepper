2008-11-30T07:43:00.000Z	mesh1		I want to make a copy of all of my . directories, so that I can wipe out the current ones and start fresh (except for a couple), how do I do that? If I do cp .* it copies all files (. being the current directory).
2008-11-30T07:45:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	maybe cp .??* DESTINATION
2008-11-30T07:45:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	that'll copy all dotfiles with 2 or more characters after the dot... so not ..
2008-11-30T07:54:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	Assuming you don't want anything that's in your Trash, yes
2008-11-30T08:01:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	I don't think you need .dbus. dbus will make a new one if it needs one
2008-11-30T10:50:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	and others, thanks for your help, it is working now. I must have been mistaken before. The first account I log into will have the nm-applet running, no other accounts can run it if the first account runs it (which I guess makes sense because two users can't user two different wireless connections).
2008-11-30T10:55:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	you might have missed my message when you left, but thanks for your help, it is working!
2008-11-30T10:55:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	Awesome! What ended up fixing it?
2008-11-30T10:57:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	well, I think I must have been mistaken before, but I'm not sure, I guess nm-applet can only run in one account at a time, so I think that means if the first user logs in and locks their account and the second user needs to change to a different wireless network, they won't be able to.
2008-11-30T10:58:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	ah, I see. That's dumb of it...
2008-11-30T10:59:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	lol. Yeah, that makes searching for info on the skill command difficult >.>
2008-11-30T10:59:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	hehe, yeah
2008-11-30T11:00:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	will wicd work under two accounts at the same time?
2008-11-30T11:00:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	No idea, I haven't tried it
2008-11-30T11:01:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	okay, maybe I'll give it a try and see what I think :) I'm sure it will be better than network manager either way
2008-11-30T11:02:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	Installation instructions are in http://wicd.sourceforge.net/download.php . It's not in the repositories, unfortunately :(
2008-11-30T11:02:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	okay, thanks, looks easy enough anyhow ;)
2008-11-30T11:14:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	my ISP is... irritating.
2008-11-30T11:15:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	lol, it's like you are here and chencaifa disappears, and then you disappear and chencaifa comes back
2008-11-30T11:15:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	lol. Well, I should be around for a while, so maybe we'll never see chencaifa again =/
2008-11-30T11:20:00.000Z	rww	mesh1	odd, I usually run bash scripts in my terminal, not my IRC client =P
2008-11-30T11:20:00.000Z	mesh1	rww	woah, you can do that???
