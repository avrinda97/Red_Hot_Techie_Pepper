2008-06-25T10:30:00.000Z	StephenZ		Vozniak: In GParted, will I need to unmount the NTFS disk that I need to format, before being able to format it? I may be missng something.
2008-06-25T10:30:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	yes, you need to unmount before you can format
2008-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	ext3
2008-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	Thanks.
2008-06-25T10:35:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	if you wanna use access that drive from windows then fat is better but if you are accessing the drive from a unix installation only then ext3
2008-06-25T10:35:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	Yeah, I'm going full-Ubuntu.
2008-06-25T10:41:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	Now that I try creating a new folder in the drive I just formatted and mounted, it's saying access is denied.
2008-06-25T10:42:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	you need to mount the drive
2008-06-25T10:42:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	I did.
2008-06-25T10:43:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	what did you format the drive as and where did you mount it afterwards?
2008-06-25T10:43:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	Formatted it as ext3, mounted it on the only mount point I was given: /media/TH4NG
2008-06-25T10:44:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	did it mount correctly? no errors? nice drive name btw, made my chuckle
2008-06-25T10:45:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	No error message popped up, no.
2008-06-25T10:48:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	unmount and try mounting again "sudo mount /dev/hdxy /media/TH4NG"
2008-06-25T10:49:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	replace hdxy with correct disk
2008-06-25T10:49:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	In this case, TH4NG?
2008-06-25T10:52:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	 "sudo fdisk -l"  and find the drvie you wanna mount, use its device name
2008-06-25T10:54:00.000Z	StephenZ	Killeroid	Tried it, didn't work.
2008-06-25T10:54:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	what didnt work?
2008-06-25T10:55:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	oh, did you first create the folder that you are mounting to (sudo mkdir /media/TH4NG) before mounting?
2008-06-25T10:58:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	wait,  i thoguht you said you coudn't mount the disk
2008-06-25T11:00:00.000Z	Killeroid	StephenZ	what command did you use to mount the disk?
