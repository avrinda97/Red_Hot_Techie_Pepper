2005-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	bob233	Amaranth	linus got ahead of himself again?
2005-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	bob233	The 2.6.11 in hoary is a prerelease version that pretty much just locks up your system as soon as GNOME starts.
2005-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	Amaranth		no, the real 2.6.11 is good
2005-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	Amaranth		the one in hoary is a prerelease version
