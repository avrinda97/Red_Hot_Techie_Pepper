2005-03-31T11:57:00.000Z	MMMond		Got it
2005-03-31T11:57:00.000Z	MMMond		It's working
2005-03-31T11:57:00.000Z	MMMond		Now - should I try a php file..
2005-03-31T11:57:00.000Z	MMMond		Just for heck of it
2005-03-31T11:58:00.000Z	MMMond		Now . . . who's gonna help me?! Come on . . . someone with php/apache/linux/LAMP knowledge.. step right up
2005-03-31T11:59:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	Depends. :-)
2005-03-31T12:04:00.000Z	MMMond	DarthFrog	You're on. Alright . . . so uhh, I wanted to get LAMP working.. did so, at one point.. had installed Apache 1.3, php4, mysql . . . and everything seemed to work great together . . . then I saw apache2 was available . . . did a complete removal of everything, and installed everything again.. apache2, php4, mysql . . . now apache2 works, but not php . . . where to begin?
2005-03-31T12:04:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	You're beyond me there.  I've not touched Apache 2 yet.  Seen no reason to.
2005-03-31T12:05:00.000Z	MMMond	DarthFrog	Thank you anyways for the mere attempt (really) :D
2005-03-31T12:06:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	I've not gone to Apache 2 yet for exactly the problems you're having. Apache 1.3 works plenty good enough.
2005-03-31T12:07:00.000Z	MMMond	DarthFrog	Suppose I install apache1.3.. and do leave apache2 as is - will this linger problems? Or shall I just do it?
2005-03-31T12:08:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	Once again, I have no experience.
2005-03-31T12:08:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	But if it were me, I'd stick to Apache 1.3. :-)
2005-03-31T12:09:00.000Z	MMMond	DarthFrog	For what inducement? Quiet honestly . . . the mere reason I had gone to apache2 was . . . well, because the number '2' was higher than the number '1.3,' and higher numbers are usually more dependable in today's world
2005-03-31T12:09:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	I know that attitude all too well. :-)
2005-03-31T12:21:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	No, there should be no conflicts.  And you can run them both at the same time, on different ports.
2005-03-31T12:23:00.000Z	MMMond	DarthFrog	Different ports... will I have to put that manually? Or will synaptic do that for me? :x
2005-03-31T12:23:00.000Z	DarthFrog	MMMond	For what you're talking about, it's all done by hand.
2005-03-31T12:24:00.000Z	MMMond	DarthFrog	:( . . . I'll do it, I've come this far (although by clicking "yes" and "next") . . . but I wanna get to know php.. I'll do it!
