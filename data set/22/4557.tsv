2008-07-29T22:11:00.000Z	squarebracket		why isn't my driver compiling?? :(
2008-07-29T22:12:00.000Z	squarebracket		if #include<linux/config.h> is saying it can't find config.h, what might the problem be?
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	DRebellion	squarebracket	perhaps you need to install linux-headers?
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	DRebellion		!info linux-headers | squarebracket
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	DRebellion		=/
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	squarebracket		OH
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	squarebracket		what?
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	squarebracket		oh wait
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	squarebracket		i'm using gutsy anyways
2008-07-29T22:13:00.000Z	squarebracket		i haven't upgraded this specific box to 8.04 yet
2008-07-29T22:14:00.000Z	squarebracket		:)
2008-07-29T22:14:00.000Z	DRebellion	squarebracket	that's odd, because it *does* exist
2008-07-29T22:15:00.000Z	squarebracket		oh wait, i -don't- have build-essential installed... weird... :S
2008-07-29T22:16:00.000Z	squarebracket		arg, still not finding linux/config.h
2008-07-29T22:17:00.000Z	squarebracket	arvind_khadri	ya, i did (i thought i had it installed but i didn't). it didn't fix it.
2008-07-29T22:19:00.000Z	squarebracket	arvind_khadri	will do
2008-07-29T22:19:00.000Z	squarebracket		!medibuntu
2008-07-29T22:20:00.000Z	squarebracket	arvind_khadri	i have the linux headers
2008-07-29T22:21:00.000Z	squarebracket	arvind_khadri	my point exactly :(
2008-07-29T22:22:00.000Z	squarebracket	arvind_khadri	it has no problem finding the other linux/x.h files, just config
2008-07-29T22:23:00.000Z	squarebracket	arvind_khadri	channel is empty?
2008-07-29T22:23:00.000Z	DRebellion	squarebracket	no #ubuntu-motu is alive and well
