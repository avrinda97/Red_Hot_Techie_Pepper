2004-11-10T07:29:00.000Z	kensai		Ok I lost sound in ubuntu's applications should I reinstall ubuntu? This happened after upgrading from warty to hoary
2004-11-10T07:30:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	youre sure you know what youre doing ?
2004-11-10T07:31:00.000Z	kensai	ogra_	I don't know
2004-11-10T07:32:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	hoary is not for enduser usage yet... and it will probably break heavy the next time
2004-11-10T07:37:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	why did you upgrade ?
2004-11-10T07:44:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	if you get output its running
2004-11-10T07:45:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	open a terminal, type: ps ax| grep esd
2004-11-10T07:46:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	to see if esd is running and blocking the device
2004-11-10T07:46:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	set the output of xmms to esd in the settings
2004-11-10T07:47:00.000Z	kensai	ogra_	in english please
2004-11-10T07:47:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	open the settings of xmms
2004-11-10T07:47:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	select the esd output plugin
2004-11-10T07:48:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	i'm flying blind here, havent used xmms since years
2004-11-10T07:48:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	you'll have to find the options yourself
2004-11-10T07:51:00.000Z	kensai	ogra_	Thanks a lot for your helping I will just reinstall, Thanks again
2004-11-10T07:52:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	probably the best to do :)
2004-11-10T07:54:00.000Z	ogra_	kensai	so you should be happy, everything is stable
2004-11-10T07:55:00.000Z	kensai	ogra_	your right very right
2004-11-10T07:55:00.000Z	kensai	ogra_	I just learned it the hard way
