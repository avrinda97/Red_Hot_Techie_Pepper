2008-08-21T21:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	Please type in about:plugins and tell us your flash version.
2008-08-21T21:16:00.000Z	Habernet	bobertdos	Shockwave Flash 10.0.0 d569
2008-08-21T21:16:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	aha!!
2008-08-21T21:18:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	Get into the terminal and listen carefully.
2008-08-21T21:19:00.000Z	Habernet	bobertdos	okay for soem reason i have 18 second lag but ill follow step by step
2008-08-21T21:19:00.000Z	Habernet	bobertdos	nvm im good now
2008-08-21T21:20:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	sudo mkdir /etc/adobe
2008-08-21T21:20:00.000Z	Habernet	bobertdos	gotcha

2008-08-21T21:23:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	In the editor, type: WindowlessDisable=true then save the file and restart firefox.
2008-08-21T21:25:00.000Z	Habernet	bobertdos	okay ill see if anything has changed
2008-08-21T21:26:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	You'll notice now that some dropdown menus will drop behind other flash objects, (a slight inconvenience), but much better than all the crashing.
2008-08-21T21:26:00.000Z	Habernet	bobertdos	yes i do notice, like ad's and drop downs etc. but thanks for the help its much appreciated
2008-08-21T21:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	This is going to get fixed in the next release of flash. There are already alphas that fix this.
2008-08-21T21:28:00.000Z	Habernet	bobertdos	i have another off topic question, i have installed utorrent and would like it to be the default torrent file opener but everytime utorrent asks me and i say yes it still doesnt work, how do i manually do this?
2008-08-21T21:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	THAT, I'm not sure about. I don't know how to specifically make file type associations if there's no GUI menu to do it.
2008-08-21T21:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	Habernet	I think right-clicking and setting the file properties usually gives you the option.
