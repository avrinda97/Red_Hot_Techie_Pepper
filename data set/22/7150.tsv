2007-04-15T13:25:00.000Z	peepsalot		i want some software to help me set goals and deadlines and track progress, does anyone know of something like that?
2007-04-15T13:25:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	Do you want a full project planner with gant charts or something simpler?
2007-04-15T13:26:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	this is just for me to get my life in order, so I don't need very full features
2007-04-15T13:27:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	I'm not sure but I think the 'evolution' mail client that comes installed by default has a todo list
2007-04-15T13:28:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	well i would like something a little more than a todo list.  I want to set goals with deadlines otherwise I will procrastinate too much
2007-04-15T13:29:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	Hmm not sure, it's still worth looking at evolution to see if it has stuff for prioritising and putting dates on the todo stuff - I suspect it does
2007-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	Try cleaning all your dot files out while you are in the failsafe gnome - it sounds like there is something in one of the .gnome start up files it doesn't like
2007-10-21T02:11:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	hey, i restarted, i was having trouble getting into my desktop (without failsafe gnome).  which dot files should I get rid of?  should i rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gnome_private ?
2007-10-21T02:12:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	Yeh I'd go for all of those - but instead of rm'ing them move them into another directory in case you want bits of them
2007-10-21T02:14:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	any other things I should move?
2007-10-21T02:15:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	See if those work, if they don't then try .gconf and .gconfd
2007-10-21T02:21:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	ok i still can't get it to load.  by the way, I have a lot of different DE / WMs and I can't load any of them.  Xfce, fluxbox, etc.   except this "Failsafe gnome"
2007-10-21T02:21:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	so I doubt the problem is any gnome-specific files
2007-10-21T02:22:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	OK then look in your .xsession-errors to see if there is anything that gives any suggestion of the problem
2007-10-21T02:23:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	fatal server error, no screens found
2007-10-21T02:23:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	Odd; also look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see if there is anything then
2007-10-21T02:24:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	http://pastebin.ca/743889
2007-10-21T02:27:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	any ideas?  I looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log but don't see anything obvious.  there is a lot of crap in there though
2007-10-21T02:27:00.000Z	penguin42	peepsalot	So you are getting the normal login screen but it only fails after login?  Have you got anything like a .xserverrc or the like in your home directory?
2007-10-21T02:29:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	that is correct, I try to login through gdm, and it changes the background color to human, with only the mouse cursor on screen. then it waits a bit, then goes back to gdm
2007-10-21T02:29:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	i don't have any ~/.xserverrc
2007-10-21T03:04:00.000Z	peepsalot	penguin42	i still can't get this to load :-(
