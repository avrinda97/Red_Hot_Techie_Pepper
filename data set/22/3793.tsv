2008-07-09T08:46:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		ok, what's that secret command to make a network connection work that you just plugged in? dhcp or something?
2008-07-09T08:47:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	try ifup / ifdown
2008-07-09T08:48:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	ethernet ow wireless?
2008-07-09T08:49:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	ethernet. I got it plugged into a second network connection on my computer.
2008-07-09T08:50:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	what does ifconfig return?
2008-07-09T08:53:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	again what does ifconfig return?
2008-07-09T08:53:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	which part? there's many lines it spits out.
2008-07-09T08:58:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	but can you even ping your router?
2008-07-09T09:00:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	I don't know... uh... it... I think not.
2008-07-09T09:01:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	ping -I [interface name] [router ip]
2008-07-09T09:01:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	I pinged 192.168.1.1 and it's just sitting there...
2008-07-09T09:02:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	sure it is 192.168.1.1 ? some routers are different
2008-07-09T09:02:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	yes. positive. I connected to it earlier.
2008-07-09T09:03:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	that rules out my next question then, is the cable OK?
2008-07-09T09:03:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	well, the light's on.
2008-07-09T09:05:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	relax. this is the fun part
2008-07-09T09:56:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	you never got to give the ifconfig output to me ?!
2008-07-09T09:57:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	I don't know how to do one of those website pastey things.
2008-07-09T09:58:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	paste the output in http://paste.ubuntu.com. it will give you a link, that you paste here
2008-07-09T10:00:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	what is your main goal?
2008-07-09T10:00:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	rockenrola	to get pppoe working on my router. which requires me to connect to my router through Ubuntu to set it up, which I was able to do once, and I have no idea how the hell I managed to do it.
2008-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	rockenrola	Chaotic_Descent	it should be simple to connect you router to your pc
