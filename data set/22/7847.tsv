2005-12-12T15:58:00.000Z	graybandit		hello all
2005-12-12T16:00:00.000Z	graybandit		question:  I'm trying to install ubuntu 5.10 on a toshiba laptop.  I burned the ISO cd properly, and have a BLANK drive in the laptop, formatted NTFS, and boot priority set to CD-ROM first...but it boots into Caldera DR-DOS 7.03...
2005-12-12T16:02:00.000Z	graybandit		ok
2005-12-12T16:03:00.000Z	graybandit		hm
2005-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	navarone	graybandit	that's why I thought you had similar situation
2005-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	graybandit	navarone	yeah, it seems to skip booting from the CD-ROM even with that priority set, and DR-DOS is a major pain
2005-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	graybandit	navarone	how would I go about updating the bios?
2005-12-12T16:06:00.000Z	navarone		graybandit> find out what bios you are using...when you boot up it will be on screen...usually Ami or Award and a number which is the version. Check if your bios has an updated version and read about updating or flashing bios.
2005-12-12T16:07:00.000Z	graybandit		will do thanks
2005-12-12T16:08:00.000Z	navarone	graybandit	when I last upgraded my bios I went to Asus and found updates...my bios was 1004...so I updated to 1006 which I read enables recognizing high drive capacity. Download update adn make boot disk...copy update to floppy and aflash.exe Boot w/floppy...run aflash and follow instructions
2005-12-12T16:09:00.000Z	navarone	graybandit	your update will go similarly
2005-12-12T16:11:00.000Z	navarone		Milk>Places in the top menu
