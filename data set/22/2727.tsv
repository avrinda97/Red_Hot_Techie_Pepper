2009-06-26T16:07:00.000Z	iceroot	IsUp	i am always using cron for something like that.... @reboot /usr/sbin/faxgetty ttyIAX0

2009-06-26T16:09:00.000Z	IsUp	iceroot	haha thanks. it works
2009-06-26T16:10:00.000Z	IsUp	iceroot	let me ask another thing. it's not working as a service. but how can i restart it?
2009-06-26T16:10:00.000Z	IsUp		i am accesing to server over SSH.
2009-06-26T16:10:00.000Z	iceroot	IsUp	you can also write your on init-script but i like the cron-@reboot more :)
2009-06-26T16:10:00.000Z	IsUp		so its not going to work when i close SSH session
2009-06-26T16:10:00.000Z	iceroot	IsUp	hm, only know killall and then restart....
2009-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	IsUp		i want to run it as a service. like 'service faxgetty start|stop|restart'
2009-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	iceroot	IsUp	it is working if you close ssh
2009-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	IsUp		how?
2009-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	iceroot	IsUp	you have not startet it with ssh, the system (cron) has startet it at boot
2009-06-26T16:11:00.000Z	iceroot	IsUp	it should still run if you close ssh
