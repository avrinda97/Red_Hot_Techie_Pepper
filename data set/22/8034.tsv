2006-03-10T08:31:00.000Z	QMario		What is the DCC exploit?
2006-03-10T08:31:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	something you should worry about if you're using a NetGear router.
2006-03-12T09:44:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	you don't, mostly
2006-03-12T09:44:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	how would I?
2006-03-12T09:45:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	try "apt-cache search undel", but i'm afraid all that stuff will only work for ext2, if at all
2006-03-12T09:45:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	what do you mean?
2006-03-12T09:45:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	your computer is using the ext3 filesystem. ext2 is an older version of it. those undeletion tools won't work on ext3 for all i know
2006-03-12T09:46:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	how do you know that my computer is an ext2 filesystem?
2006-03-12T09:46:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	ext3, not ext2. i know because every ubuntu uses ext3 by default
2006-03-12T09:47:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	the answer is, as far as i know, *no tool*. no way to recover the files. others might have better advice, but i never heard anything different about this
2006-03-12T09:49:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	really?
2006-03-12T09:49:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	if you removed them from the shell, it logs that in your .bash_history, inside your home dir
2006-03-12T09:50:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	so the system doesn't log deleted files?
2006-03-12T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	no, it doesn't
2006-03-12T09:50:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	why not?
2006-03-12T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	if you actually remove them by typing "rm", that is logged so
2006-03-12T09:52:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	best you can do, i think, is    cat /dev/hda | grep -A 100 -B 100 "some-text-string-that-was-in-your-files" >recovered
2006-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	you might get some bits and pieces of your files into the "recover" file. you can't really do anything better
2006-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	the files were video files.
2006-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	QMario	LjL	no hope?
2006-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	LjL	QMario	no, i think not
