2006-10-27T09:25:00.000Z	Meshezabeel		where can iI find release notes that are new to this version that weren't in 6.06?
2006-10-27T09:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
2006-10-27T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	the desktop CD is the liveCD, the alternate is just an installer.  Both the desktop and the alternate will install the full desktop, there's also the server CD, which installs a GUIless server
2006-10-27T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	which download page?
2006-10-27T10:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	ah.  Apparently... edubuntu calls it the installer, instead of alternate.
2006-10-27T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	yes, you will be able to upgrade from the installer disks, In all the documentation you read it'll be referenced as "alternate" though
2006-10-27T10:23:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Flannel	thanks for the help!
2006-10-27T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	the upgrade wiki page mentions upgrading from the alternate CD, that'll be what you use, with apt-cdrom
2007-04-22T13:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	no.  That 256 is memory required to install via liveCD (which is up from 192 in edgy), Alt CD still installs on stuff with tiny memories.
2007-04-22T13:04:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Flannel	it says here that it is 256MB ... http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704
2007-04-22T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	right.  That's for the liveCD installer.
2007-04-22T13:05:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Flannel	where can I find requirements for standard install then?
2007-04-22T13:05:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Flannel	everywhere still seems to say 256MB, but maybe I'm missing something
2007-04-22T13:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	The alternate CD can install on stuff with lower memory.  How much memory do you have?
2007-04-22T13:08:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Flannel	well I want to buy some used computers to give away with Ubuntu on them, I just need to know what the minimum I should be looking at is. I can get a 128MB 450Mhz PIII for $15.
2007-04-22T13:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	you might look into installing Xubuntu instead of Ubuntu.
2007-04-22T13:09:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Flannel	CarlFK, this will be to give to people that aren't used to linux too, so would like something eye catchy, so would prefer ubuntu to xubuntu.
2007-04-22T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	Well, even thought the minimum isn't 256, with lower than 256, you probably won't be too happy with the performance.  And you won't be able to run the eyecandy
2007-04-22T13:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	with all linux, there really aren't 'minimums' per sey.  You just get a sliding scale of responsiveness and stuff.
2007-04-22T13:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	well, there are minimums, but the minimum is so astronomically low (and gives you crappy quality) that most people wouldnt have that issue
2007-04-22T13:29:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Flannel	yeah I know this is the same with any OS, but still good to see suggested requirements nonetheless
2008-12-15T01:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Meshezabeel	yes
