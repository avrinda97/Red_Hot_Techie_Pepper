2007-02-26T12:01:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	"some error" isnt useful
2007-02-26T12:05:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	are you rnning 2.6.17 ?
2007-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	any suggestions?
2007-02-26T12:08:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	what version of ndiswarapper are you running?
2007-02-26T12:08:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	1.8
2007-02-26T12:09:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	ive not encountered that problem myself, tried purging annd reinstalling it?
2007-02-26T12:09:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	nope, I'll give it a shot
2007-02-26T12:09:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	 I'm not sure how to clear all the entries I put in previously though
2007-02-26T12:10:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	entries?
2007-02-26T12:10:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	yeah when I did ndiswrapper -m
2007-02-26T12:12:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	just reinstall, dont worry about that
2007-02-26T12:13:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	ok
2007-02-26T12:13:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	that just adds an entry to load the ndiswrappper on boot, your newly installed module will have the same name so its all good
2007-02-26T12:14:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	actually it seems I was using ndiswrapper 1.1
2007-02-26T12:15:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	I'm having some crazy errors over here
2007-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	ray_	petemc	I'm still getting the same error when trying to add ndiswrapper

2007-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	petemc	ray_	reinstalling or updating?
