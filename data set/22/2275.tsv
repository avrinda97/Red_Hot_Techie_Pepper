2010-07-01T02:38:00.000Z	Purpley		NOOOOOOO Gparted gave me an error im scared to check my partitions :P
2010-07-01T02:39:00.000Z	Purpley		Oh it just couldnt resize a partition phew
2010-07-01T02:40:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	better run chkdsk /f from within vista, and reboot so that it checks it while booting
2010-07-01T02:41:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	Ahh ok thanks for helping I checked gparted and it has the ! with a triangle next to the partition so its a error
2010-07-01T02:42:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	if you want to resize an ntfs partition, gparted suggests exactly that (chkdsk from windows before resizing/moving)
2010-07-01T02:42:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	btw, ubiquity doesn't use gparted, it's a different program
2010-07-11T01:17:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	usb or pci? ftp://3dsp_lpkt_usb:m4rt9s@3dsp.com.cn/
2010-07-11T01:17:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	Still waiting for that one... I don't know what's taking them so long, the usb version has been ready for a long tim.
2010-07-11T01:18:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	Argh!
2010-07-11T01:18:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	http://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9323230&postcount=38 this might help us
2010-07-11T01:18:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	here's the link, to wait for: ftp://3dsp_lpkt_pci:fw1qa8@3dsp.com.cn/
2010-07-11T01:19:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	Think they gave up?
2010-07-11T01:19:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	I'm not sure... they opened source the driver, I hope that doesn't mean that they gave up... I think we should email them for support...
2010-07-11T01:20:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	And no one has adapted it to work with 10.04?
2010-07-11T01:20:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	no, I don't think so. Sure we can try installing an older kernel but personally I don't mind waiting, it's for my daughter's netbook so I haven't bothered to try.
2010-07-11T01:21:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	Would anything bad happen if I tried installing the old kernel without a fresh install?
2010-07-11T01:22:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	no installing multiple kernels shouldn't be a problem. You'll need the linux headers too for dkms to compile the driver headers I think...
2010-07-11T01:23:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	Where might those be located online?
2010-07-11T01:23:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	which one do you want?
2010-07-11T01:24:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	I already downloaded the actual .deb kernel from http://mirror.globo.com/ubuntu/archive/pool/main/l/linux/linux-image-2.6.31-14-generic_2.6.31-14.48_i386.deb but where might the headers be?
2010-07-11T01:26:00.000Z	alkisg	Purpley	http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/i386/linux-headers-2.6.31-14-generic/download ?
2010-07-11T01:26:00.000Z	Purpley	alkisg	Oh durr sorry :)
