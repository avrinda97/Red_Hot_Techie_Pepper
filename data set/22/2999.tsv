2011-01-14T07:38:00.000Z	TornadoChas3r		anyone have any ideas why it would be saying the disk is full when it has about 20gb left?, i ran some checks and it has not found any problems
2011-01-14T07:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	your the second one I seen that had this problem the last guy has 1.2 gig left and still could touch a file in that mount
2011-01-14T07:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	can you pastebin your mount and fdisk -l ?
2011-01-14T07:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	don't need chroot for fdisk -l
2011-01-14T07:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	that should be enuf as long as you know what partition you used that said it was full
2011-01-14T07:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	ok looking
2011-01-14T07:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	what is cciss device?  some kind of a raid?
2011-01-14T07:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	I guess you need to look at it with the cciss_utils  you might have them already installed I'm not sure http://cciss.sourceforge.net/#cciss_utils
2011-01-14T08:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	so the live cd boot also see's that disk a full and can't touch a file in it?
2011-01-14T08:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	sta7ic: I'm with sta7ic: you should do an fsck on that disk ,  make sure you umount if first
2011-01-14T08:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	I've never seen this before usrjquota=quota.user
2011-01-14T08:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	that's my best guess it must be the quota thing,  did you do a fsck on the disk?
2011-01-14T08:34:00.000Z	TornadoChas3r	sacarlson	heres the ouput http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/5avqsMhA
2011-01-14T08:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	well that looks good,  I looking for a way to disable that quota to see if it will work without it
2011-01-14T08:40:00.000Z	TornadoChas3r	sacarlson	what would  quotaoff do?
2011-01-14T08:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	I don't know that's why I'm researching it, I've never used quota before
2011-01-14T08:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	what does quotacheck -vug /dev/...  give you?
2011-01-14T08:53:00.000Z	TornadoChas3r	sacarlson	do you want me to be chrooted when i run that, im running off the LiveCd at the moment
2011-01-14T08:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	i'm not sure that's required,  I would try without chroot first
2011-01-14T08:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	I'm reading this http://pig.made-it.com/quota.html
2011-01-14T09:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	I can't find anything about disable quota so I don't know what you have to loose on that disk,  but maybe try change fstab to a normal no quota setting  like /dev/cciss/c0d0p1 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
2011-01-14T09:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	TornadoChas3r	if that works at least you have isolated the problem to quota,  maybe quota has nothing to do with it?
