2009-03-11T13:27:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	use a live disc to mount the drive and delete the rar.
2009-03-11T14:30:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	just boot a live disc, mount the drive, delete the archive and your back, i cant beleive this problem is still being discussed.
2009-03-11T14:31:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	well move the archive to the other drive, or a memory stick or whatever,
2009-03-11T14:32:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	delete the apt cache, of the files you extracted from the archive are not anough.
2009-03-11T14:34:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	use a live disc.
2009-03-11T14:35:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	what live disc are you using>?
2009-03-11T14:38:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	why is prolly a better question
2009-03-11T14:39:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	home/six is just the dir on an unknown (at present) dev. first you want to know what dev(ice)its on
2009-03-11T14:40:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	dont worry about dolphin, gparted will give you a batter pic of how full the drives are.
2009-03-11T14:43:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	have you got a gnome live disc?
2009-03-11T14:44:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	iam suprised kubuntu dont have a aptitiion utility on it,
2009-03-11T14:45:00.000Z	koshari	sixofour	that will overwrite your archive
