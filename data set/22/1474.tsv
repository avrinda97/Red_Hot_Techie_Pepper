2010-05-03T00:24:00.000Z	chiz		Hi, I'm not familiar with Ubuntu's version of grub, how do you use the saved feature for setting the default selection? (Ubuntu 10.04)
2010-05-03T00:26:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	start startupmanager 4th tab called Default and then tick automatically update default boot option
2010-05-03T00:26:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	4th tab called Advanced even
2010-05-03T00:27:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	silverdrake11: thanks guys
2010-05-03T00:30:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	I don't see a check-box for the auto update default option.
2010-05-03T00:30:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	under advanced what options do you have, (uploading a screenshot also works)

2010-05-03T00:36:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	hmm that looks different from what i have
2010-05-03T00:36:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	whats under boot options?
2010-05-03T00:37:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	there is just  a drop down to choose the default, which is just a list of entries from grub.cfg, as well there are a few options for screen resolution.
2010-05-03T00:38:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	seems updatemanager is not so grub2 savvy yet
2010-05-03T00:39:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	ok
2010-05-03T00:39:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	sec im looking up how to set the option by hand
2010-05-03T00:44:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275 its detailed here how to add the savedefault option again
2010-05-03T00:45:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	I was looking at that page too, I'll try a few things and get back to you on what works
2010-05-03T00:46:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	well its a bit confusion it first says you need to just set a value to true in /etc/defaults/grub, and a bit further down it talks about adding some custom rules, not really clear if you need the latter
2010-05-03T00:46:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	just make sure update-grub2 finishes properly every time you run it ;)
2010-05-03T00:47:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	thanks, i was just wondering what updated grub on the stuff in /etc
2010-05-03T01:18:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	was it you helping me with grub?
2010-05-03T01:18:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	i was
2010-05-03T01:19:00.000Z	chiz	acicula	I figured out that you just need to add GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true to /etc/default/grub to get the save default working
2010-05-03T01:21:00.000Z	acicula	chiz	sweet :)
