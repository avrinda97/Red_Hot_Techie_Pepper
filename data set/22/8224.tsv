2006-01-18T17:35:00.000Z	Marlun		if I want to search for a file in terminal, whats the command?
2006-01-18T17:36:00.000Z	Marlun		thanks
2006-01-18T17:36:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	you can use 'locate'
2006-01-18T17:36:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	you can also look at 'whereis' and 'find', read their man pages
2006-01-18T17:37:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	ok, I searched for "httpd.conf" but I got nothing with find and locate.
2006-01-18T17:38:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	are you sure you used the right syntax for find?, if the file is recent you will need to update the database that locate uses with 'sudo updatedb'
2006-01-19T17:24:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	no 's' at the end
2006-01-19T11:14:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	you are installing php from source?  why?
2006-01-19T11:15:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	testing mostly :)
2006-01-19T11:15:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	try 'sudo apt-get build-dep php5'
2006-01-19T11:15:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	plus that I didn't like that they put things in /etc/
2006-01-19T11:16:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	ah,
2006-01-19T11:16:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	that seems interesting :)
2006-01-20T12:51:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	if you use gnome terminal there is an option in the profile, otherwise mute the pc speaker
2006-01-20T12:52:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	nope, i've not installed gnome yet, i'm at a server install.
2006-01-20T12:52:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	how do I mute the pc-speaker?
2006-01-20T12:52:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	i *think*: xset b off,
2006-01-20T12:52:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	actually no, i just read the man, it's for X as the name implies.
2006-01-20T12:56:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	Dr_Willis: thanks for the help, I'll install xset and see if it works =)
2006-01-24T13:01:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	it's in multiverse, have you enabled it?
2006-04-16T07:29:00.000Z	_jason	Marlun	edit /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts accordingly
2006-04-16T07:30:00.000Z	Marlun	_jason	thanks!
