2011-03-02T12:16:00.000Z	iRabbit	blue_pearl	cli sudo update-grub

2011-03-02T12:17:00.000Z	iRabbit	blue_pearl	reboot and let me know if it's back
2011-03-02T12:18:00.000Z	blue_pearl	iRabbit	here is the output if it helps anyway http://paste.ubuntu.com/574324/
2011-03-02T12:19:00.000Z	iRabbit	blue_pearl	do you have Windows on one HDD and Ubuntu on the other?
2011-03-02T12:19:00.000Z	blue_pearl	iRabbit	no i have only 1 hdd its a laptop
2011-03-02T12:20:00.000Z	iRabbit	blue_pearl	alright. I had something similar happen to me... but unfortunately Windows was on another drive. I'm sorry but I'm lost.. perhaps someone with a bit more knowhow will pick up where I left off
2011-03-02T12:21:00.000Z	blue_pearl	iRabbit	ok thanks though
2011-03-02T12:21:00.000Z	iRabbit	blue_pearl	you will probably end up editing your /boot/grub/menu.lst to add windows and point grub to the partitiion
2011-03-02T12:22:00.000Z	blue_pearl	iRabbit	ok thanx
2011-03-02T12:23:00.000Z	iRabbit	blue_pearl	found several threads on a google search on how to complete the operation
2011-03-02T12:23:00.000Z	blue_pearl	iRabbit	ok will check
2011-03-02T12:26:00.000Z	blue_pearl	iRabbit	the drive in which windows is installed can not mount it
2011-03-02T12:28:00.000Z	iRabbit	blue_pearl	uh oh,
