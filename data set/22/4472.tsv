2008-01-03T11:23:00.000Z	WEW		I tried modprobe -r snd-hda-intel, and it says Module snd_hda_intel is in use. How do I know what is using it?
2008-01-03T11:24:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	lsmod | grep snd_hda_intel
2008-01-03T11:25:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	sorry, backwards thinking, that shows whats being used by snd-hda-intel
2008-01-03T11:26:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	I got this http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=9296
2008-01-03T11:26:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	I was thinking backwards, that shows what's being used by snd-hda-intel , sorry
2008-01-03T11:27:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	Okay so what else can I do other than restarting GDM
2008-01-03T11:27:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	what are you trying to accomplish? removing modules isn't really a recommended thing
2008-01-03T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	and I don't think restarting gdm wouldn't be enough, to answer your question
2008-01-03T11:28:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	My sound is not working in Cedega. Whenever this happens, I stop gdm, remove the module and add it again, and start gdm. But I wanna do it without stopping gdm each time
2008-01-03T13:30:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	I think file-roller supports zip; anyway xarchive does , if you have p7zip-fill installed iirc
2008-01-03T13:31:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	I need for .rar files, not .zip
2008-01-03T13:31:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	er, that was 7zip with file-roller
2008-01-03T13:31:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	then install unrar , file-roller will use it also
2008-01-03T13:32:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	you should probably explore system->admin->synaptic , it references more software than add/remove
2008-01-03T13:33:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	it says I have file-roller already installed..
2008-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	install unrar , then doubleclick an rar file
2008-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	Okay, that's archive manager.. I need something else. It shows an error in some rar files
2008-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	have you installed unrar yet?
2008-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	yes
2008-01-03T13:34:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	ah, then try the p7zip-full
2008-01-03T13:35:00.000Z	nickrud	WEW	or   rar e <file>
2008-01-03T13:35:00.000Z	WEW	nickrud	they are .r01 .r02 .r03 etc
