2009-03-19T06:48:00.000Z	gRunt		Can anyone tell me if there is a way to change the default mount point for my ipod? I have looked in the mtab and can't see anything glaringly obvious like with my ntfs partitions. Any idea?
2009-03-19T06:48:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	paste me your /etc/fstab to http://www.pastebin.ca
2009-03-19T06:53:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	and you say that the IPod is connected and mounted now?
2009-03-19T06:53:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	pastebin me the output of "fdisk -l" and "mount".
2009-03-19T06:55:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	im waiting on the paste :)

2009-03-19T06:57:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	where is the IPod mounted now, /mnt/shared_ntfs ?
2009-03-19T06:59:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	can you tell where your ipod is mounted as of right now?
2009-03-19T06:59:00.000Z	gRunt	r00tintheb0x	by default it is /media/ipod but I will check
2009-03-19T07:01:00.000Z	gRunt	r00tintheb0x	hah it doesn't appear there, which is odd it used to be /media/ipod. The only reason I want to mount it somewhere else is that stupid icon just makes me cry (im anal about having unwanted desktop icons gone)
2009-03-19T07:01:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	is the ipod plugged in?
2009-03-19T07:01:00.000Z	gRunt	r00tintheb0x	aye im charging it, and yes I was just playing pokemon emerald on it ;)
2009-03-19T07:02:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	open up a terminal.
2009-03-19T07:02:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	what'd it say?
2009-03-19T07:03:00.000Z	gRunt	r00tintheb0x	i had a clean terminal up it didnt say anything I just got a gnome window that asked me what default action I wanted to take
2009-03-19T07:04:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	gRunt	did you "tail -f /var/log/messages" ?
2009-03-19T07:05:00.000Z	gRunt	r00tintheb0x	no didnt even know that existed lol ill do it now
