2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	abstrakt		is there any such thing as a "files and settings transfer wizard" for moving from 9.10 to 10.04
2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	abstrakt		e.g. is it safe to just tarball my home dir and then unpack it?
2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	that should be fine
2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	abstrakt		will that work? will that restore my gnome panels and such?
2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	solid_liq	what if versions are different?
2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	all your settings for your desktop are stored under your home directory
2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	solid_liq	will that also restore my panel positions and icons and stuff
2010-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	abstrakt		ok
2010-05-16T01:55:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	the version thing is something that has always annoyed me though...  someone needs to come up with a good migration solution for that someday
2010-05-16T01:56:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	if it won't be exactly the same, it should hopefully at least be really close so it won't take too terribly long to get it exactly the way you want
2010-05-16T01:56:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	10.04 is really nice too btw
2010-05-16T01:56:00.000Z	abstrakt		k
2010-05-16T01:56:00.000Z	abstrakt	solid_liq	i just need it to be faster mostly, i probably won't be using GNOME
2010-05-16T01:56:00.000Z	abstrakt		probably going with openbox
2010-05-16T01:56:00.000Z	abstrakt		though i do wish i could figure out how to better configure openbox
2010-05-16T01:57:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	old computer?
2010-05-16T01:57:00.000Z	abstrakt	solid_liq	umm, not as much as what i'm doing with it
2010-05-16T01:57:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	???
2010-05-16T01:57:00.000Z	abstrakt		audio video sucks down the processor time
2010-05-16T01:58:00.000Z	solid_liq	abstrakt	that should still be fast enough with gnome
2010-05-16T01:58:00.000Z	abstrakt	solid_liq	yeah actually moving to fluxbox didn't make much of a difference, still ended up with the same issue
2010-05-16T01:58:00.000Z	abstrakt	solid_liq	although i think i know how to solve it temporarily, but it's a hack and a PITA
