2011-04-10T09:58:00.000Z	Vustom		I have headphones that plugin to my comuter using the green and pink + USB ports at the front of my computer, and they go out one of the ports in the back of the computer and plugin to my Xbox 360, (I think it's In-line or something?) anyways, when I was on Windows I could hear the Xbox sounds, when using Ubuntu i can't
2011-04-10T09:59:00.000Z	Vustom		Any ideas..?
2011-04-10T09:59:00.000Z	^NiNjA	Vustom	 sounds like you have some connections mismatched
2011-04-10T10:00:00.000Z	Vustom	^NiNjA	the connections are fine because i haven't changed them since I was on Windows, but I remember this happening before and I had to make another sound device default in the Windows Sound control panel..
2011-04-10T10:00:00.000Z	^NiNjA		in ubuntu 11.04 standard gnome 2.? is an option at GDM login
2011-04-10T10:01:00.000Z	Vustom		?
2011-04-10T10:01:00.000Z	^NiNjA	Vustom	 is this a windows problem or Ubuntu?
2011-04-10T10:02:00.000Z	Vustom		Ubuntu, i need to make another sound device default in Ubuntu, like I did once before in Windows so i could hear my Xbox 360 sounds through my headphones.
2011-04-10T10:03:00.000Z	^NiNjA	Vustom	 not knowing particualrs on your system or your setup I would say to go into sound preferences and check your settings
2011-04-10T10:03:00.000Z	^NiNjA		make sure you have input output going to proper devices.
2011-04-10T10:03:00.000Z	Vustom	^NiNjA	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=657593 describes my problem.
2011-04-10T10:04:00.000Z	^NiNjA		k, reading
2011-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	^NiNjA	Vustom	 may sound like im being picky but did you try the fix mentioned there?
2011-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	Vustom		I just found it like a second ago, trying it now.. :3
2011-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	^NiNjA		ok cool
2011-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	^NiNjA		Good luck
2011-04-10T10:06:00.000Z	Vustom		I don't know what to turn up or down -_-
2011-04-10T10:08:00.000Z	Vustom	^NiNjA	now the sound on Ubuntu won't work at all -_-
2011-04-10T10:09:00.000Z	^NiNjA	Vustom	 open sound preferences from the sound icon on top bar
2011-04-10T10:10:00.000Z	^NiNjA		go to hardware tab, and see if it has a hardware listing for both your pc soundcard/chip and your xbox
2011-04-10T10:11:00.000Z	Vustom	^NiNjA	it's open.
2011-04-10T10:12:00.000Z	^NiNjA	Vustom	 your sound preferences / hardware has bot sound sources listed?
