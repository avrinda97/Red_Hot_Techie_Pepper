2009-05-04T13:48:00.000Z	kopichu		hi
2009-05-04T13:50:00.000Z	kopichu		how do i connect ubuntu to a Local Area network?
2009-05-04T13:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	kopichu	like ethernet network or wifi?
2009-05-04T13:51:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	ethernet is the one with hub and utp cat5 cables right?
2009-05-04T13:51:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	im plugged right now but i cant see the other pcs
2009-05-04T13:52:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	yes and games,
2009-05-04T13:54:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	the other PCs are both windows xp, samba is for file sharing right? i want to start with the basics - like being able to ping the other hosts
2009-05-04T13:55:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	i just want to ping them first since samba is difficult to configure. ive tried many configurations already and nothing works
2009-05-04T13:55:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	like i ping 169.x.x.x and no replies are returned
2009-05-04T13:56:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	so you mean, they cant ping me? or i cant ping them?
2009-05-04T13:57:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	well ubuntu has iptables right?
2009-05-04T13:58:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	tyvm i will try that arping
2009-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	here is a picture of my problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1139972
2009-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	the bottom post shows it
2009-05-04T14:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	kopichu	I used system-config-samba to setup samba
2009-05-04T14:05:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	i tried that too.
2009-05-04T14:08:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	is there a way for me to find other IPs in my LAN with a command without having to type ifconfig or ipconfig (for windows)?
2009-05-04T14:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	kopichu	you could monitor ip trafic with wireshark to see what addresses are active but is that what you want?
2009-05-04T14:11:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	sounds like it - if it helps me find other hosts
2009-05-04T14:12:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	RoyK, you guys have been really helpful thanks - im going to list down the commands u say
2009-05-04T14:15:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	RoyK my sisters want XP :(
2009-05-04T14:17:00.000Z	kopichu	sacarlson	but ideally it should be ubuntu right?
