2006-03-08T13:55:00.000Z	omatunto_		Hi, I'm getting a Mac Mini today, but I don't have an external display.
2006-03-08T13:55:00.000Z	omatunto_		I was wondering if I can install Ubuntu blind.
2006-03-08T13:56:00.000Z	omatunto_		Has anyone any experience doing it or any suggestions?
2006-03-08T13:56:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	i know its possible to use a serial output as terminal, but i never done that
2006-03-08T13:57:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	yes, theres an option to load that module (atleas on debian)
2006-03-08T13:57:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	but to select that you need an monitor :) (AFAIK)
2006-03-08T13:58:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	i think your better of with debian, theres propably some images that initialises automaticly a "ssh installation"
2006-03-08T13:59:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	there a ways to install linux wihtout monitor, but dunno how easy that is wihtout knowledge.. (never done that too, but would love to know)
2006-03-08T14:01:00.000Z	omatunto_	oskude	I guess I try to use some fairly graphical installation walkthrough and just select the defaults...
2006-03-08T14:01:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	maybe there are some netboot images that automaticly install debia base..
2006-03-08T14:01:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	for server i would highly remonned debian and this http://www.debian-administration.org/
2006-03-08T14:03:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	not because debian is better or such, just because debian is used alot longer than ubuntu, so you find better info/help...
2006-03-08T14:03:00.000Z	omatunto_	oskude	ok, perhaps that is wise...
2006-03-08T14:03:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	are you from finnland, your name is funny :)
2006-03-08T14:03:00.000Z	omatunto_	oskude	Finland, yes. :-)
2006-03-08T14:04:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	ok :)
2006-03-08T14:07:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	is your server going to be public ?
2006-03-08T14:07:00.000Z	omatunto_	oskude	not really, possibly ssh open to the wide net
2006-03-08T14:08:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	ok. just wanted to know if you let php accesible from net.. as there are so many script kiddies outthere (i know, i had one a week ago:)
2006-03-08T14:10:00.000Z	omatunto_	oskude	running too much services may bite you :-)
2006-03-08T14:11:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	it was just my fault, not having updated the php apps (and didnt have any IDS)
2006-03-08T14:12:00.000Z	oskude	omatunto_	but the bot just wanted to do some spamming, didnt even get real acces to the system
