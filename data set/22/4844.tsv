2008-02-13T18:54:00.000Z	bazhang		sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg kez
2008-02-13T18:55:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	im on the menu thing now, whuch driver should i pick?
2008-02-13T19:04:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	thanks for the tip. ok, now i selected nvidia and gave it a name (8800 gtx)... now the next screen is just some writing with an "ok" button that i cant actually click... do i just close that?
2008-02-13T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Kez	tab to that
2008-02-13T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Kez	and then hit enter
2008-02-13T19:07:00.000Z	bazhang	Kez	that would be my guess
2008-02-13T19:11:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	should i pick yes or no for use kernal framebuffer interface ?
2008-02-13T19:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Kez	yes; from here-- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2008-02-13T19:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Kez	the rest are defaults; then log out log back in, go through that process again if you get a text prompt asking you to login (once you have logged in) and the next time choose no for the framebuffer question
2008-02-13T19:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Kez	if you get that and have to sudo dpkg again--then once you have entered no the second time to the framebuffer question then restart your computer once you are finished and you should be good to go
2008-02-13T19:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Kez	best to write down this command once you are dropped into text mode login sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-02-13T20:35:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	here is the error message "failed to start the X server. It is likely that it is not set up correctly."
2008-02-13T20:48:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	how do i reload/reboot it now ive done all of that setup? is there a command? or should i just turn pc off and back on
2008-02-13T21:17:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	i finally got in to my gui, and selected my native resolution (woo!) but i have 2 black bars at either side of the screen... do you know of any fix?
2008-02-13T21:20:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	that's what everyone has suggested, but with DVI input on my monitor, it does not allow access to those kind of controls... they're locked
2008-02-13T21:21:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	if there's no easy way to fix it i'll probably just leave it
2008-02-13T21:23:00.000Z	Kez	bazhang	thanks :)
