2005-12-27T15:42:00.000Z	agorf		thx

2005-12-27T07:07:00.000Z	agorf		synaptics*
2005-12-27T07:08:00.000Z	ktogias	agorf	doesn't it ask you for your password?
2005-12-27T07:09:00.000Z	agorf	ktogias	err no
2005-12-27T07:09:00.000Z	agorf	ktogias	i just listen to a sound and then nothing
2005-12-27T07:09:00.000Z	agorf	ktogias	moreover, i never got the change to set a root password (not that it is relevant)
2005-12-27T07:09:00.000Z	ktogias		strange...
2005-12-27T07:10:00.000Z	ktogias	agorf	in Ubuntu you don't have a root passwd... You get root privileges with sudo...
2005-12-27T07:11:00.000Z	ktogias		Have you set a password for root?
2005-12-27T07:11:00.000Z	agorf		no
2005-12-27T07:11:00.000Z	ktogias		right
2005-12-27T07:11:00.000Z	agorf		so i do everything by prepending sudo ?
2005-12-27T07:11:00.000Z	ktogias	agorf	yes
2005-12-27T07:12:00.000Z	agorf		m, strange
2005-12-27T07:12:00.000Z	ktogias		or sudo -i if you want a root shell ....
2005-12-27T07:12:00.000Z	ktogias		try running sudo synaptic from a terminal...
2005-12-27T07:13:00.000Z	agorf	ktogias	i will thanks :)
