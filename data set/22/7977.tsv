2005-11-15T14:59:00.000Z	cbetan		Thank you! Why did the GPG error happened in the first place? Any pointers to documentation?
2005-11-15T15:00:00.000Z	cbetan		Did the ftpmaster change the gpg key?
2005-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	mustard5	cbetan	its really just a connection issue that is doing it
2005-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	mustard5	cbetan	I can hit reload in synaptic and get gpg errors every time..but I hardly ever get them with sudo apt-get update
2005-11-15T15:02:00.000Z	mustard5	cbetan	you can try sudo apt-get update if you like...I guarantee that it will work better than synaptic ;)
2005-11-15T15:03:00.000Z	mustard5	cbetan	as it should
2005-11-15T15:03:00.000Z	mustard5	cbetan	the unreliability of it will lead to complacency (take me as an example)
2005-11-15T15:06:00.000Z	mustard5	cbetan	what mirror you downloading from ?
2005-11-15T15:07:00.000Z	mustard5	cbetan	no employees around that I know of...mostly community members
