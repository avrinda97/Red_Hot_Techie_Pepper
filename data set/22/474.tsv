2011-09-07T23:48:00.000Z	mmyers		Good afternoon, everyone.  I'm having a problem with the Ubuntu Installer on a Mac Mini.  I see the purple boot screen, and I can select "Try Ubuntu before Installing" or "Install Ubuntu", but either way, when I do, I lose signal to my monitor, and my disk drive just clicks around for a while.  I've tried waiting 20 minutes, but nothing ever happens.  Is there any troubleshooting or anything I can do here?
2011-09-07T23:49:00.000Z	mmyers		Not the HD.  The DVD drive.  It sounds like it's trying to read stuff, ZenMasta.  Not really a click, more...the drive working furiously at reads.
2011-09-07T23:49:00.000Z	share	mmyers	did u burn the CD at low speed?
2011-09-07T23:49:00.000Z	share		you have to.
2011-09-07T23:50:00.000Z	mmyers		It's a new disk.  And no, I didn't.  I tried three different images (32 bit 11.14, 64 bit 11.14, 10.12), and all three have the same issue.
2011-09-07T23:50:00.000Z	share	mmyers	check md5sum of .iso or download using .torrent, then burn th cd at the lowest speed possible
2011-09-07T23:50:00.000Z	mmyers		And all the MD5 sums are correct on all three isos.
2011-09-07T23:50:00.000Z	share	mmyers	ok, so the problem is your driver
2011-09-07T23:50:00.000Z	mmyers		But I will try again burning the DVD at low speed.
2011-09-07T23:51:00.000Z	mmyers	share	The driver?
2011-09-07T23:51:00.000Z	share		drive
2011-09-07T23:51:00.000Z	share		sorry
2011-09-07T23:51:00.000Z	share	mmyers	you can also install using a USB
2011-09-07T23:51:00.000Z	share		pendrive I mean
2011-09-07T23:51:00.000Z	mmyers		Any clue how to boot from a pendrive on a Mac?
2011-09-07T23:55:00.000Z	share		hi
2011-09-07T23:56:00.000Z	mmyers	share	The thing is, I guess, I don't think it's the drive:  A Debian install disk works just fine; the only problem is that Debian doesn't seem to have support for the Ethernet Card I have, so I can't really use that unless I find a way to get the driver in.  And I tried the Ubuntu disk in a MacBook Pro and it worked fine.  It's just this Mac Mini, which is weird.
2011-09-07T23:57:00.000Z	share	mmyers	try ##hardware (maybe u need a registered nick)
2011-09-07T23:57:00.000Z	mmyers		All right.  Thanks.
2011-09-07T23:58:00.000Z	share		lol
2011-09-07T23:59:00.000Z	share	mmyers	##mac
2011-09-07T23:59:00.000Z	mmyers	share	Wouldn't that channel be more for Mac OS X type stuff?
