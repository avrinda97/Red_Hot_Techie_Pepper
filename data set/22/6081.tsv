2007-06-09T05:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	or you could just sudo apt-get update
2007-06-09T05:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	if you added them yes...
2007-06-09T05:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	are you using Ubuntu or Kubuntu
2007-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	well, i dnt know german, so i don't know what it means
2007-06-09T06:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	that looks completely different from my rep-mgr...
2007-06-09T06:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	can you start control center from the menu?
2007-06-09T06:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	not even the normal menu?
2007-06-09T06:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	ok.
2007-06-09T06:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	kamikaye	i assume you restarted after installing the driver.
