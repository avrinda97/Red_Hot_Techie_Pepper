2006-11-02T10:26:00.000Z	lukeb		when I use beryl as my window manager, the borders to all my windows disappear
2006-11-02T10:26:00.000Z	lukeb		did i install it incorrectly?
2006-11-02T10:26:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	it probably crashed if you have no borders
2006-11-02T10:29:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	click on the ruby and tell it to restart beryl or use the window manager menu in there to re-select beryl, see if it starts up again
2006-11-02T10:29:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	it just reverts to compiz (which incidentalyl doesnt have window borders either)
2006-11-02T10:29:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	ah, not sure there, you enabled glx in xorg.conf right?
2006-11-02T10:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	just to check, you have nvidia or ati for a card right?
2006-11-02T10:30:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	Nvidia - im pretty sure its enabled ill check
2006-11-02T10:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	go through the howto for installing/configuring Beryl on the Ubuntu wiki
2006-11-02T10:31:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	yeah thats how I installed it
2006-11-02T10:31:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	xorg.conf does say Load           "glx"
2006-11-02T10:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	you disabled dri and glcore too right?
2006-11-02T10:32:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	err not glcore, but comment out dri
2006-11-02T10:33:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	its not even there. ill try restarting the PC brb
2006-11-02T10:37:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	it worked - all it needed was a reboot hehe
2006-11-02T10:37:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	the module loading is a bit weird at times on boot, I put gdm in to start at level 90 in inits and it helped quite a lot
2006-11-02T10:38:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	if that means nothing to you, just ignore it ;-)
2006-11-02T10:38:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	consider it ignored :D
2006-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	Beryl tip, hit your mouse cursor in each corner, try it with multiple things open on multiple desktops
2006-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	lukeb	Kingsqueak	holy crap thats awesome
2006-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	ctrl-alt- arrow keys too
2006-11-02T10:40:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	lukeb	ctrl-alt click and drag with left mouse button too
