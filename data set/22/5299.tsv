2007-06-01T13:32:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	the site is simply broken again.
2007-06-01T13:34:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	please just wait until i can find out what's wrong with the site this time
2007-06-01T13:34:00.000Z	BlueBird22	LjL	ok
2007-06-01T13:40:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	try now, should be working
2007-06-01T13:42:00.000Z	BlueBird22	LjL	dont those packages show as dependencies. have further sub sub dependenceis?
2007-06-01T13:42:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	finding the sub sub dependencies is precisely what apt.byethost14.com tries to do
2007-06-01T13:42:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	by giving it a metapackage, you tell it which packages you *already* have, so that it won't make you download things you already have
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	BlueBird22	LjL	oh so those are all what i need to have
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	http://apt.byethost14.com/?repo=Feisty&arch=i386&package=build-essential&have=ubuntu-desktop should be
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	BlueBird22	LjL	iam using kubuntu. not ubuntu
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	try omitting the "ubuntu-desktop" metapackage, and you'll see many more
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	LjL	BlueBird22	well, you didn't say that. use "kubuntu-desktop" instead of "ubuntu-desktop" then.
2007-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	BlueBird22	LjL	ok
2007-06-01T13:46:00.000Z	BlueBird22	LjL	should i now go to packeges.ubuntu.com and dl that from there?
2007-06-01T13:47:00.000Z	BlueBird22	LjL	sory. i got it
