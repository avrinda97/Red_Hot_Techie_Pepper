2006-12-27T14:04:00.000Z	opteek		is it normal for an install of winxp to take 2.5 hours using qemu?
2006-12-27T14:04:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	yes.
2006-12-27T14:05:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	its entirely normal.
2006-12-27T14:05:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	thanks
2006-12-27T14:05:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	you can use kqemu (a proprietary kernel module which makes things go faster in qemu)
2006-12-27T14:06:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	but i dont recommend it
2006-12-27T14:06:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	 why not?
2006-12-27T14:06:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	I tried using kqemu while installing but the installation pagefaulted
2006-12-27T14:07:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	because it is proprietary!
2006-12-27T14:07:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	do you know what proprietary means?
2006-12-27T14:07:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	 i read something about an open source equivalent to kqemu
2006-12-27T14:08:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	well,  don't use it. it is too alpha.
2006-12-27T14:08:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	thats what I thought
2006-12-27T14:09:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	do you understand what the problem is with kqemu?
2006-12-27T14:09:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	it's proprietary!!
2006-12-27T14:09:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	that isn't complete understanding. yes, it's proprietary...
2006-12-27T14:10:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	but it means that if, say, you wanted kqemu to be fast, you couldn't do it, or hire someone else to do it for you.
2006-12-27T14:11:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	or, if you wanted to promote kqemu by bundling it, you couldn't do it without asking.
2006-12-27T14:15:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	are there comparative open source alternatives to qemu?
2006-12-27T14:15:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	 for running xp
2006-12-27T14:15:00.000Z	kbrooks__	opteek	not really.
2006-12-27T14:16:00.000Z	opteek	kbrooks__	 ok, can I expect a significant performance increase if I add, say a gig of ram ( i am using 128 for the VM currently)
