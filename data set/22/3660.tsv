2008-12-11T04:06:00.000Z	R0b0t1		For some reason when trying to update a program from a .deb, it says "Older version in software channel" and proceeds with the download, but the installed package is not the newer version :|
2008-12-11T04:07:00.000Z	gusto5	R0b0t1	uninstall previous first and then install new?
2008-12-11T04:07:00.000Z	R0b0t1	gusto5	That did not work.
2008-12-11T04:07:00.000Z	R0b0t1	gusto5	When I did that, the "older" version was reinstalled.
2008-12-11T04:08:00.000Z	gusto5	R0b0t1	what's the package for?
2008-12-11T04:08:00.000Z	R0b0t1	gusto5	Free Pascal. "fpc" for apt-get, etc.
2008-12-11T04:09:00.000Z	gusto5	R0b0t1	if i may ask, whats the version on a search for fpc*
2008-12-11T04:10:00.000Z	R0b0t1	gusto5	What do you mean?
2008-12-11T04:10:00.000Z	gusto5	R0b0t1	when you run an aptitude search for fpc*
2008-12-11T04:11:00.000Z	R0b0t1	gusto5	It says installed version is 2.2.2 (which is what I want, the older one is 2.2.0), although when typing "fpc" on the terminal brings up version 2.2.0
2008-12-11T04:12:00.000Z	gusto5	R0b0t1	what version runs? 2.2.0?
2008-12-11T04:12:00.000Z	R0b0t1	gusto5	Yes, like I said :)
2008-12-11T04:13:00.000Z	gusto5	R0b0t1	sorry im a little confused. to conclude, it says 2.2.2 is installed, which is what you want, but 2.2.0 comes up on the apt search?
2008-12-11T04:13:00.000Z	gusto5	R0b0t1	and 2.2.2 is the one that runs?
2008-12-11T04:14:00.000Z	R0b0t1	gusto5	No, no... In the synaptic window, it says the installed version is 2.2.2. But what actually runs is 2.2.0.
