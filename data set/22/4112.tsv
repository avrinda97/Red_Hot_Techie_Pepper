2009-08-05T21:23:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	open a terminal, run 'killall firefox && firefox -ProfileManager' , create a new, empty  profile for testing and try if firefox starts with that
2009-08-05T21:24:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	firefox: no process killed
2009-08-05T21:24:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	nothing else happened
2009-08-05T21:25:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	then firefox wasn't running. just make a fresh profile with firefox --ProfileManager
2009-08-05T21:25:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	i know it wasnt running... i said i restarted computer and reinstalled firefox and the error didnt change
2009-08-05T21:26:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	reinstalling didn't give you a new clean profile
2009-08-05T21:26:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	ok... i created a new profile... thanks
2009-08-05T21:27:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	how do i recover last one
2009-08-05T21:27:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	did you install some new addon or did anything specfial?
2009-08-05T21:29:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	didnt install any addon or anything that i can remember
2009-08-05T21:30:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	so if a new profile works the error is in your user profile... some bad addon, corrupted database... whatever... i can't guess what it might be
2009-08-05T21:31:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	you might get useful information if you switch back tto your old profile and run 'firefox' from a terminal. YOu might get an error message
2009-08-05T21:32:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	cant use last profile.. says its already being used
2009-08-05T21:33:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	hmmm... there could be some stale lock file in that profile, and you get it back by just deleting it
2009-08-05T21:34:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	deleting the profile? wont i lose everything?
2009-08-05T21:35:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	not deleting the profile... only deleting a .lock or similar named file in the profile folder
2009-08-05T21:35:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	where is the profile folder :P
2009-08-05T21:37:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	i'm not too familiar with firefox' mechanism of determinig locks, so might better ask in #firefox . you profiles are kept in ~/.mozilla/firefox
2009-08-05T21:37:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	ok thanks
2009-08-05T21:43:00.000Z	stefg	ltcabral	BTW, teh fiel you're looking for is .parentlock just on the first level in the profile subfolder
2009-08-05T21:43:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	i just copied everything inside the last profile folder to the new one :P
2009-08-05T21:43:00.000Z	ltcabral	stefg	worked
