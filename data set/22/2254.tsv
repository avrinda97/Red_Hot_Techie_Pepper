2009-08-06T03:53:00.000Z	boomerang		Hey there I have an issue, I got no sound, anyone willing to help??
2009-08-06T03:54:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	did you try alsamixer and unmute all the channels
2009-08-06T03:54:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	I tired unmuting everything, didn't work unfortunately
2009-08-06T03:55:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	if you open a konsole ... then alsamixer .. all the channels with 'MM' in front are still muted ... check this please
2009-08-06T03:56:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	to unmute select the channel and press 'm'
2009-08-06T03:56:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	it replied "function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory" that bad??
2009-08-06T03:57:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	probably your alsa drivers are not loaded correctly...
2009-08-06T03:57:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	try lsmod | grep snd*
2009-08-06T03:57:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	try lsmod | grep snd
2009-08-06T03:57:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	k ill try
2009-08-06T03:58:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	does it have any snd_ moules loaded (listed in grep)?
2009-08-06T03:58:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	I did it, and then tried the alsmixer command again, It didnt work...
2009-08-06T03:59:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	this won't load them ... just list them if they are loaded... the 'lsmod | grep snd' ... did it print out anything like snd_pcm ?
2009-08-06T04:00:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	this is to check if your drivers are loaded correctly
2009-08-06T04:00:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	well i dont see anything under snd_moules there
2009-08-06T04:01:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	yes: snd_pcm                83076  5 snd_ice1724,snd_ac97_codec,snd_usb_audio,snd_pcm_oss,snd_ak4114
2009-08-06T04:01:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	this is the problem ... your drivers aren't loaded ...
2009-08-06T04:01:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	did you try /etc/init.d/alsa-utils start?
2009-08-06T04:03:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	It says setting up ALSA and I have an Envy24PT/HT
2009-08-06T04:03:00.000Z	boomerang	brotkasten	huh??
2009-08-06T04:03:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	alsa = advanced linux sound architecture ... this is not the nam of your card
2009-08-06T04:04:00.000Z	brotkasten	boomerang	huh?
