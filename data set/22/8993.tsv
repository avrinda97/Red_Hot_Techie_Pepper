2005-05-20T16:17:00.000Z	dockane		to be precise : ""HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted " is my problem
2005-05-20T16:18:00.000Z	gma	dockane	I had that message when I didn't have the correct module for my chipset loaded. have you checked that properly?
2005-05-20T16:18:00.000Z	dockane	gma	this is what i wrote above
2005-05-20T16:19:00.000Z	gma	dockane	not since I logged in you didn't. last thing I saw you say about it was what chipset you have, not which modules you've loaded.
2005-05-20T16:21:00.000Z	dockane	gma	i am running an intel 840 chipset. which module do i have to choose ? (my modules http://pastebin.com/282913 )
2005-05-20T16:24:00.000Z	dockane	gma	maybe this helps, too : lscpi -v ( http://pastebin.com/282914 )
2005-05-20T16:25:00.000Z	gma	dockane	sorry, disappeared there for a bit.
2005-05-20T16:26:00.000Z	dockane	gma	you were afk ?
2005-05-20T16:26:00.000Z	dockane	gma	or the pastebins have disappeared ?
2005-05-20T16:26:00.000Z	dockane	gma	, i see np
2005-05-20T16:31:00.000Z	gma	dockane	not having much luck...
2005-05-20T16:31:00.000Z	dockane	gma	what does that mean ?
2005-05-20T16:31:00.000Z	gma	dockane	probably that I can't help you
2005-05-20T16:33:00.000Z	dockane	gma	i basicly don't know what do replace in /etc/modules and what to put there instead (intel 840 /carmel)
2005-05-20T16:40:00.000Z	gma	dockane	try loading piix and running hdparm again.
2005-05-20T16:41:00.000Z	dockane	gma	"modprobe piix" ?
2005-05-20T16:44:00.000Z	dockane	gma	:( http://pastebin.com/282920
2005-05-20T16:45:00.000Z	gma	dockane	do you know if piix was already loaded?
2005-05-20T16:46:00.000Z	dockane	gma	nope sorry
2005-05-20T16:46:00.000Z	dockane	gma	should have looked before
2005-05-20T16:48:00.000Z	gma	dockane	I'm afraid I've outlived my usefulness in that case.
2005-05-20T16:48:00.000Z	dockane	gma	thank you very much for your time and help
