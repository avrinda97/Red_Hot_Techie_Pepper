2008-02-08T06:31:00.000Z	wil_		hi... I am trying to migrate to ubuntu... I want to write a very simple script with 2 commands in it... what extention do I need to run 2 terminal commands? Need to know the linux equivalent of .bat
2008-02-08T06:31:00.000Z	wil_		.bash?
2008-02-08T06:32:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	change it to an executable file with the chmod command
2008-02-08T06:33:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	 then, run the script by typing the path and file name, or  " ./filename " instead.  Most people use .sh as a common script "file extension", although it is unnecessary, technically.
2008-02-08T06:36:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	need to run it from the command line interface (terminal) to see the output
2008-02-08T06:37:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	you don't need #!/bin/sh as the first line, by the way, nor renaming with .sh
2008-02-08T06:37:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	ahh :( just trying to follow advice
2008-02-08T06:38:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	good advice, but I'm just tryiing to make it easy for you to get it right
2008-02-08T06:38:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	it is just one command! I just want to run it by double clicking.... it would be quicker for me to type the command than have to go to console and do that every time :(
2008-02-08T06:38:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	Are you in a terminal when you run this script, or are you trying to double click it?
2008-02-08T06:39:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	 I want to run one command that does metacity --replace and one that does compiz --replace so I can quickly enable and disable it whilst keeping all my settings because I have a old windows app that I need for work that is not compatible with it... but I dont want to get rid of compiz! I love it
2008-02-08T06:39:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	ah - there we go.  well, go into a command prompt and see what the error is
2008-02-08T06:41:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	I went to terminal and when I type normal.sh it just says command not found :(
2008-02-08T06:41:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	type " ./normal.sh " like I said before
2008-02-08T06:41:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	I know I can just type compiz --replace, but I really want to have it as a desktop icon I can just click on... it is a learning experience, but annoying
2008-02-08T06:41:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	sorry, I missed that one... ok that works fine.... but how do I do that from a icon?
2008-02-08T06:44:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	okay, try this now:  right click on your GNOME Panel (with the menu), and do Add to Panel, then click on Create Launcher
2008-02-08T06:45:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	then type in the full name of the script, " /home/blahyouruser/normal.sh " and you might have to run it as Type "Application in Terminal"
2008-02-08T06:46:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	I clicked on browse, found it and it works fine!
2008-02-08T06:46:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	see you around!
2008-02-08T06:46:00.000Z	wil_	desertc	I have to say.... and dont hate me... that is the one thing so far I still like about windows.... create a file, call it .bat and run!.... but I wouldnt go back for anything!
2008-02-08T06:47:00.000Z	desertc	wil_	it's called freedom - you'll learn to like it  ;-)
