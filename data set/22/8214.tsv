2006-01-22T12:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Thank you :)
2006-07-04T07:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Hoary is no longer supported
2006-07-04T08:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	heh, good point
2006-07-14T06:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	However, doing gksudo nautilus --no-desktop --browser gives error.. so there's no way to run nautilus using gksudo in a way that the root instance of nautilus doesn't "take over" the users desktop.
2006-07-14T06:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ardchoille	A) Do you really want to do that? B) nautilus has got a --root flag, doesn't it?
2006-07-14T06:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	I don't see one. Using the "--no-desktop --browser" options prohibits nautilus from taking over the desktop. Ig you run gksudo nautilus, then the root instance of nautilkus will take over the users' desktop.. since gksudo doesn't allow the use of options with a command.
2006-07-14T06:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	, gnomefreak You can run gksudo nautilus and gksudo nautilus --no-desktop --browser if you like to see what I am talking about.
2006-07-14T06:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ardchoille	No, I can't. I am using xubuntu and kubuntu only now. :)
2006-07-14T06:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Ahh, ok :)
2006-08-10T06:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Won't he need to add a line to /etc/hosts.allow to allow ssh from a machine? I set up sshd today and I had to do that.
2006-08-10T06:46:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ardchoille	That depends on what's in his hosts.deny file. :)
2006-08-10T06:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	ahh, true
2006-08-10T06:46:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ardchoille	besides I should get a "connection refused" if I was able to resolve his host and not a "no route to host".
2006-08-10T06:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Yeah, good point.
2006-08-10T12:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	hehe
2006-08-14T09:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Does that just make an ISO of the cdrom?
2006-08-14T09:26:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ardchoille	it sure does
2006-08-14T09:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Thank you :)
2006-08-14T09:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ardchoille	and argument: Note however that some "copy protected" cd-roms won't be happy with dd.
2006-08-14T09:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	Ah, yeah, noted
2006-08-22T06:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	BlueEagle	I don't have ati or nvidia cards and that update broke mine too
