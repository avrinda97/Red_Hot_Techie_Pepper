2011-04-26T01:09:00.000Z	api984_		did anyone try to use SPDIF IN?
2011-04-26T01:10:00.000Z	api984_		i am having trouble with SPDIF input ? can you give me some advice for starters?
2011-04-26T01:11:00.000Z	LAcan	api984_	is the rest of your sound card working properly? headphone jack and speakers?
2011-04-26T01:11:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	yes
2011-04-26T01:12:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	i am trying to build the following scheme: xbox(spdif out) -> soundcard1 (spdifin) -> decode (ac3dec) -> souncard2 (5.1 channel) -> analog out
2011-04-26T01:12:00.000Z	LAcan	api984_	thats above my pay grade, but i suspect that ubuntu is not using the correct driver
2011-04-26T01:13:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	i thought so too, still thinking about this...
2011-04-26T01:13:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	i'll have to do some more tests
2011-04-26T01:16:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	how long do you use linux?
2011-04-26T01:16:00.000Z	LAcan	api984_	bout a week
2011-04-26T01:16:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	only a week experience in linux?
2011-04-26T01:17:00.000Z	LAcan	api984_	im no expert, but sound is a known issue
2011-04-26T01:17:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	i am doing a little complicated scheme
2011-04-26T01:17:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	cheap SPDIF soundcard and thats it
2011-04-26T01:18:00.000Z	LAcan	api984_	no kidding
2011-04-26T01:18:00.000Z	LAcan	api984_	so this monster rig you are doing... you have it all pkugged in already...?
2011-04-26T01:19:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	yes... working all day to make it work
2011-04-26T01:19:00.000Z	LAcan	api984_	ok so first question: do all the other ins and outs work correctly?
2011-04-26T01:19:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	trying to make it work like i did in windows... similar config this is
2011-04-26T01:20:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	as I know they should... i am doing tests right now... still searching for the headphones... module is ok and up
2011-04-26T01:20:00.000Z	api984_	LAcan	driver seems to be fine
