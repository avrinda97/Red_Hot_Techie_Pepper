2007-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	wilo_	juano_1	 ok ill disable 3rd party
2007-12-26T08:41:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	whats the error message when you open up synaptic ?
2007-12-26T08:41:00.000Z	wilo_	juano_1	 ^^
2007-12-26T08:42:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	is synaptic still open after that ?
2007-12-26T08:42:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	or does it crash ?
2007-12-26T08:43:00.000Z	wilo_	juano_1	 yeah its still open
2007-12-26T08:45:00.000Z	wilo_	juano_1	 its as simple as this, i cannot install anything, if i install through gui, it tells me to go to synaptic, and it tells me i ned the right dependacies, and when  igo to install the right dependacies, it tells me i need more
2007-12-26T08:45:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	in synaptic go to preferences ---> repositories
2007-12-26T08:45:00.000Z	wilo_	juano_1	 if i installed via cli then it tells me i need dependacies, and if i sudo get-apt install (application) it says its "unavailable" or need other dependacies
2007-12-26T08:46:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	check in ubuntu software to see if you have all 5 enabled boxes
2007-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	wilo_	juano_1	only 3 were ticked, ill try with all 5
2007-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	and please disable all third-party ones
2007-12-26T08:48:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	after that click CLOSE below and then reload in the main synaptic window
2007-12-26T08:49:00.000Z	juano_1	wilo_	if all goes well, then just try to install what you need
2007-12-26T08:50:00.000Z	wilo_	juano_1	 thankyou VERY much
