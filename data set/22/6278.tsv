2008-07-14T18:10:00.000Z	ER_A		yup slart is rite, you shouldn't have to adjust ur DNS settings for pidgin
2008-07-14T18:11:00.000Z	ER_A		i quite like 8.04 i pref to 7.10
2008-07-14T18:12:00.000Z	ER_A		although i think i only find hardy easier because I have learn't more since I used gutsy
2008-07-14T18:12:00.000Z	ER_A		lol
2008-07-14T18:13:00.000Z	ER_A		slart are you about?
2008-07-14T18:14:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	huh?
2008-07-14T18:15:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	sure
2008-07-14T18:15:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	happy amateur =)
2008-07-14T18:16:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	ok, sounds like a common setup.. I've got something similar here
2008-07-14T18:19:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	mm... do you have dns setup for the internal network? ie can you do ping pcserver ?
2008-07-14T18:20:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	I haven't really messed with this myself.. I use nfs between the ubuntu machines and the wife uses samba from vista to the ubuntu server.. but hang on.. I'll give it a try here.. see if I can access the server using name only in nautilus
2008-07-14T18:21:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	but.. I don't use the workgroup name like that.. I just use smb://pcserver/sharename
2008-07-14T18:22:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	I think there is a setting for configuring what workgroup you're in .. somewhere in the samba settings
2008-07-14T18:22:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	workgroups are a ms thing
2008-07-14T18:23:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	what happens if you try it without the workgroup name there
2008-07-14T18:24:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	I think that workgroup thing is handled by that weird ms network name thingy..  wins or whatever it's called
2008-07-14T18:24:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	I think nmdb is supposed to do that in samba
2008-07-14T18:25:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	that is more strange than the first thing.. smb is slow and clunky.. but it usually works
2008-07-14T18:26:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	some kind of NetBIOS thingy.. you configure it in smb.conf
2008-07-14T18:28:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	I just use regular dns.. one xubuntu server running dhcp/dns/samba.. two ubuntu clients and one vista laptop
2008-07-14T18:28:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	samba is the linux version of ms filesharing.. it's already built in if you're running xp
2008-07-14T18:48:00.000Z	Slart	ER_A	sorry.. here's one for you then... "There is a gnome-open command.. try it, tastes like chicken" =)
