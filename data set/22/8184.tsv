2006-01-18T08:36:00.000Z	mark_		Hi guys, I wonder: i have an `older' centrino with buggy bios, which somehow prevents top 16 megs  (out og 1gig) to be cached, and making the computer veeeery slow, I fixed it by adding mem=1008 - this seem to fix the problem, but then the computer stopped discovering PCMCIA card, sound, batttery and other "gadgets". Right  now the problem is solved by removing one 512 Mb memory card, but I wonder if I could still keep it, without sacrific
2006-01-18T08:36:00.000Z	mark_		ing other parts of the computer. Any thoughts?
2006-01-18T08:37:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	can you do a BIOS update?
2006-01-18T08:37:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	risky on a laptop, I know...
2006-01-18T08:39:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	I wish i could -- nope, Asus stopped releasing bioses for m3n two years ago :)
2006-01-18T08:41:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	have you tried using different kernels?
2006-01-18T08:42:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	yep, the problem seem to appear only on 2.6.*, and not on 2.4.*, but again i need 2.6 to have my 802.11B to work. :)
2006-01-18T08:43:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	which of 2.6.* have you tried?
2006-01-18T08:44:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	interestinly enough, it seems much worse on 2.6.8 where it took debian nearly 45 minutes to boot.  On 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 (which i am running now on Ubuntu) it is much less so -- about 5 minutes to boot (with 1gig of memory) and <1 min with 512Mb.
2006-01-18T08:44:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	why not try 2.6.12 then?
2006-01-18T08:45:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	ups sorry, it is 2.6.12.9  (and 10), (debian was still 2.6.8)
2006-01-18T08:47:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	it may be worth getting the linux-image package from http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.15/ and trying that.
2006-01-18T08:49:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	well, i am a little cautious about installing newer versions of kernel without having to... I was wondering what's the actual problem is  and if it is possible to fix it :) (particularly, why mem option prevents sound card from working - even though lspci detects it fine)
2006-01-18T08:50:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	oh, yeah, and i forgot, the thing worked on 2.6.8-386 (but not 686) fine too...
2006-01-18T08:52:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	this is weird stuff. You probably need to find someone with kernel expertise to give you a thorough explanation. All I can suggest is shotgun-style experimentation.
2006-01-18T08:52:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	but if you can't take any risks, I suggest you stick with 512M.
2006-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	alright, thanks, I will try to look around. :)
2006-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	perhaps #linux ...
2006-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	sure :), thanks
2008-06-20T03:01:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	does anyone here do commercial support?
2008-06-20T03:01:00.000Z	soundray	mark_	I don't. Why are you asking me?
2008-06-20T03:04:00.000Z	mark_	soundray	I just asked you because you mentioned it right after I joined...I missed the first part of your conversation though :(
