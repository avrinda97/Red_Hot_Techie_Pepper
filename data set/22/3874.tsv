2008-06-05T00:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	if you want to get rid of grub you must replace it with something else, if you want to install windows, you must replace with the windows MBR, for that matter you must use a windows uility, fdisk /mbr or fixmbr
2008-06-05T00:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	please ask on ##windows, your question is not ubuntu related
2009-04-28T19:16:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	do a sudo fdisk -l (to see what is the partition name)
2009-04-28T19:16:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	if it does not mount, the filesystem is corrupted or not of the type you are expecting, please check with fdisk -l first
2009-04-28T19:18:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	"sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb" says it is sdb5, as did gparted, and it's on an extended partition.
2009-04-28T19:18:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	if you can't mount id, and its listed as ext3, then it's probably corrupted
2009-04-28T19:20:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	It is listed as unrecognized, and I *know* it is ext3, since I left it when I upgraded to jaunty the other day.  / and /home are on different partitions, / is ext4, /home is ext3, only thing I can think of is that it is on an extended partition, and there is empty space infront of it, not sure if that could be doing it
2009-04-28T19:21:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	you could try to use testdisk, to check for a deleted partition entry
2009-04-28T19:21:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	I don't think it's deleted, since it shows up, just as unrecognized.
2009-04-28T19:21:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	so it's corrupted...
2009-04-28T19:22:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	Yes, as stated, and I was asking for either help mounting it or help fscking it
2009-04-28T19:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	I mean, seriously corrupted, since you can't fsck it...
2009-04-28T19:23:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	I realize that, but do you know of anything I can try?  I tried SpinRite, it sees it, but says it doesn't think it can successfully read/write to it, so it doesn't want to try
2009-04-28T19:24:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	I would try testdisk anyway
2009-04-28T19:30:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	You know of a more or less reliable way I can at least get one last read out of it?  Running testdisk now, not sure how long it should take, I selected the drive, and did proceed, not sure when the "fixing" comes into play.
2009-04-28T19:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	if it's seriously corrupted, forget it
2009-04-28T19:32:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	So since it's corrupted, and I have a replacement drive, and have accepted that the data is gone, you can't suggest anything to try with a spare drive I have that had my former /home on it?  I mean it's gone either way, so what's the difference?
2009-04-28T19:33:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	I mean if there is a slight chance I can get it back, why not try it?
2009-04-28T19:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	I don't have the know-how for such a recovery attempt, sorry
2009-08-01T03:42:00.000Z	ubuntu	joaopinto	ath5k is a free driver, why would it need restricted drivers manager?
2009-08-01T03:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	because it allows yo swap between the madwifi and ath5k which is disabled because it introduces problems with some models
2009-08-01T03:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	ubuntu	actually it is just called, hardware drivers dialog
