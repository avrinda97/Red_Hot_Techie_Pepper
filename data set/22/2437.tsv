2011-05-10T15:33:00.000Z	AceKing		I've been using Ubuntu for four years now. I absolutely HATE the new layout! I don't mind change, but this is ridiculous. I know how to change it after an install, but during a Live CD session I find myself on an Easter egg hunt just to find everything! If someone can tell me how to use Classic Ubuntu from Live CD I would appreciate it.
2011-05-10T15:33:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	in GDM choose Gnome Classic
2011-05-10T15:33:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	you could also install the Gnome3 PPA.. Gnome3 is niceee
2011-05-10T15:34:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	but I have to logout to do that right?
2011-05-10T15:34:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	sure
2011-05-10T15:34:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	I tried that.
2011-05-10T15:34:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	select your username in GDM, then below, change the session
2011-05-10T15:35:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	no reason why it would not work...
2011-05-10T15:35:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	oh, you have installed Ubuntu 11.04 or you are running it live ?
2011-05-10T15:35:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	I am going to try again. BTW.. I didn't know about Gnome3. How do I install that?
2011-05-10T15:35:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	one sec let me find you the PPA info
2011-05-10T15:35:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	I'm running off of Live CD
2011-05-10T15:36:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	ah ok ... mmm well certainly if you have installed it, you can switch to Classic Gnome
2011-05-10T15:36:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	have no idea if it would work on LiveCD
2011-05-10T15:37:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	I know, I'm doing that on my PC. I'll have to just deal with it for a little bit.

2011-05-10T15:37:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	Thank you! YOU ROCK!!
2011-05-10T15:37:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	beware ! The PPA is not stable ... if you can, I would install 11.04 as normal, then just change the session to Classic
2011-05-10T15:38:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	but I am certainly looking forward to Gnome 3 in the future release of Ubuntu (hopefully they will include it)
2011-05-10T15:38:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	OK, I will install it on my "test" laptop
2011-05-10T15:38:00.000Z	AceKing	[diablo]	Thank you so much for your help!!
2011-05-10T15:39:00.000Z	[diablo]	AceKing	your welcome, good luck
