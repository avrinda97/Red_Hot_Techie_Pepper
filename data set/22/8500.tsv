2005-07-27T16:20:00.000Z	daves		God the default file manager is a pain!
2005-07-27T16:21:00.000Z	daves		anyone suggest an alternative
2005-07-27T16:21:00.000Z	daves		getting sick of windows poping up alover the place, reminds of ie???
2005-07-27T16:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	under prefs, change to "always open as browser" or whatever
2005-07-27T16:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	indeed - i use the rox filer here: but the browser mode of nautilus is OK
2005-07-27T16:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	erm - you misunderstood
2005-07-27T16:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	the browser mode of nautilus is a file management mode
2005-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	daves	thoreauputic	so what state is it by default after installation ??
2005-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	edit preferences behaviour "open in browser windows"
2005-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	daves	thoreauputic	'cause that's the way it is now , will try it now.
2005-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	the default is "ubuntu spatial" or something
2005-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	warty had the old spatial mode
2005-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	change to browser mode as above
2005-07-27T16:35:00.000Z	daves	thoreauputic	little bugge rcouldn't see the box for the holes :)
2005-07-27T16:37:00.000Z	daves	thoreauputic	now it does LOOK like the ms ie.
2005-07-27T16:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	frankly I prefer the rox filer so I hardly ever use nautilus
2005-07-27T16:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	does what do tabs? neither nautilus nor rox do
2005-07-27T16:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	daves	I like rox because it's configurable, quick and has a built in commandline feature i use a lot
2005-07-27T16:44:00.000Z	daves	thoreauputic	far enough :) , never know i might stumble across it and like it ...
