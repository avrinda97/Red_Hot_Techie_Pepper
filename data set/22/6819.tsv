2006-07-23T12:38:00.000Z	Bonez56		does anyone know of any good samba guides? i followed one on ubuntuguide.org but I still can't get it to work. when windows users browse my shares it fails authentication, even though they have been added to the samba group and have permission to read/write my shares.
2006-07-23T12:39:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	I know the problem
2006-07-23T12:39:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	do you know what I am doing wrong?
2006-07-23T12:40:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf
2006-07-23T12:41:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	ok I have that file open
2006-07-23T12:41:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	CTRL K and type security
2006-07-23T12:41:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	security=user
2006-07-23T12:42:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	change it to security = share
2006-07-23T12:42:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	ok, is that all i need to do?
2006-07-23T12:42:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	Then try this: sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2006-07-23T12:43:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	ok ill be back in a minute ill just test it :)
2006-07-23T12:43:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	with security = share, you dont have to run any extra commands afterwords though
2006-07-23T12:46:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	ok that seems to be working a bit better, but when I access a share it automatically shows up as bonez\Guest as the username, and it's greyed out. I can't change it to any other user
2006-07-23T12:47:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	Then change it back to user and then run smbpasswd -a username for whatever users you want added.
2006-07-23T12:47:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	that's how I had it before, but i'll try it again now.
2006-07-23T12:47:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	But you didn't try smbpasswd -a username I bet
2006-07-23T12:48:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	yes I did
2006-07-23T12:48:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	just testing now
2006-07-23T12:48:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	it's doing the authentication failure problem again.
2006-07-23T12:49:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	it shows the username as MYPCNAME\mark (mark is the account I just set an smbpasswd for)
2006-07-23T12:51:00.000Z	Bonez56	zealot	do u have any further ideas?
2006-07-23T12:51:00.000Z	zealot	Bonez56	No, that worked for me
