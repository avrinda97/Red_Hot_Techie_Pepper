2012-01-25T11:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	?
2012-01-25T12:38:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Maybe a for each loop?
2012-01-25T12:48:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Did you figure it out?
2012-01-25T12:50:00.000Z	wookienz	bobo37773	yeah i was using find command, so i used -exec to run it. thanks
2012-01-25T12:51:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Right on
2012-02-14T10:31:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Are they all exactly the same?
2012-02-14T10:31:00.000Z	wookienz	bobo37773	the files the same name? or the strong in each file?
2012-02-14T10:31:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	No I mean the string
2012-02-14T10:32:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	use -i switch with sed
2012-02-14T10:34:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Something like -->         sed -i /"eval(base64blahblahblah"/d *php
2012-02-14T10:37:00.000Z	wookienz	bobo37773	thanks.
2012-02-14T10:37:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Your welcome.
2012-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Maybe a for each loop?
2012-02-14T11:06:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Are the files located in different places? Like different places of a directory tree?
2012-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	If I understand correctly you are saying file1= ~/folder1/file.php    and file2= ~/folder2/file2.php    <-- Is this correct?
2012-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	wookienz	bobo37773	yes
2012-02-14T11:10:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	You can take the ouput from your find command and use sed with it. Is that what you want?
2012-02-14T11:15:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	Something like this -->  http://pastie.org/3378808
2012-02-14T11:16:00.000Z	wookienz	bobo37773	thanks,,, so will that operate an oeach line of $x
2012-02-14T11:17:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	That is just a basic example
2012-02-14T11:18:00.000Z	bobo37773	wookienz	sixdahs solution is much more elegant
