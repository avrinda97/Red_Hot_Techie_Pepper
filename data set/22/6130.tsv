2006-12-22T11:18:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r		Q. How do you install SOCKS5 on an Ubuntu gateway to make it act as a proxy?  I think I'm having my stupid day because I can't find it.  I'm checking the packages but don't seem to find the appropriate one.  Thanks in advance.
2006-12-22T11:19:00.000Z	sbalneav	pr3d4t0r	Not sure, but ssh can act as a socks5 proxy via the -D switch
2006-12-22T11:20:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	Ah.
2006-12-22T11:20:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	I'd still like to have a real one installed.  Some of the machines on the LAN behind the gateway have users who'd get confused by SSH.
2006-12-22T11:21:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	Thanks for the suggestion, though; that may work out for some people.
2006-12-22T11:21:00.000Z	sbalneav	pr3d4t0r	If you just need a proxy for some app, ssh -ND 9999 localhost on some machine will set up a socks5 proxy on port 9999, users can just point to that.
2006-12-22T11:21:00.000Z	sbalneav		Might be worth fooling with :)
2006-12-22T11:22:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	It's a generic proxy.  I'd like to set it up independently of SSH.
2006-12-22T11:23:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	But yeah, let me think about this a bit more.
2006-12-22T11:23:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	The scary thing is that www.socks.nec.com doesn't work anymore.

2006-12-22T11:23:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	Thanks for your help.
2006-12-22T11:23:00.000Z	sbalneav	pr3d4t0r	sorry I can't be of more help, but I've used the ssh trick for so long, it's all I know anymore :)
2006-12-22T11:23:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	HeH.

2006-12-22T11:23:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	Same here.
2006-12-22T11:24:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	My problem is normal people on the 'net now.  "What is this SSH thing?"
2006-12-22T11:24:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	Plus some are running Windows :: shudder ::
2006-12-22T11:24:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	Most of us Mac or Linux guys can just run /usr/bin/ssh in the background and put it out of mind.
2006-12-22T11:25:00.000Z	sbalneav		:)
2006-12-22T11:30:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	sbalneav	It looks like I may be able to hack something for ssh proxying on the Windows machines without user intervention.
