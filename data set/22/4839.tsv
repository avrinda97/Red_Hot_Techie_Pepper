2008-02-20T20:15:00.000Z	brunner		hi all
2008-02-20T20:17:00.000Z	brunner		my install CD is damaged and it's the only one I have.  Is there any way to adjust the apt sources so it uses an online server as the source for the installation packages instead of trying to pull them off the CD?
2008-02-20T20:19:00.000Z	brunner		but it will read enough for me to get to this point with the live cd
2008-02-20T20:19:00.000Z	brunner		it just has errors when it goes through the install
2008-02-20T20:21:00.000Z	brunner		okay, so I changed my apt sources.  will that do the trick for the install?
2008-02-20T20:22:00.000Z	brunner		that is, if I uncheck the CD-Rom and pick online sources, it will use the online apt repo for the source of packages during the install?
2008-02-20T20:23:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	is this already installled and you want to update; or is it part of the initial installation? there is a minimal cd (around 9MB) that can get you going if you have a download cap
2008-02-20T20:24:00.000Z	brunner	bazhang	can I make my ubuntu install CD act like the mini.iso by changing the apt sources
2008-02-20T20:25:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	no; just get the minimal cd and do it that way only 9MB ;]
2008-02-20T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	it is only 9MB and if you are referring to your damaged full ubuntu live  cd installer then no
2008-02-20T21:01:00.000Z	brunner	bazhang	for some reason, the mini iso didn't work.
2008-02-20T21:01:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	didn;t work? could you elaborate please?
2008-02-20T21:02:00.000Z	brunner	bazhang	there was an error of some sort when it was installing the packages
2008-02-20T21:03:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	please be more precise
2008-02-20T21:04:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	if you say there was an error of some sort then we can not offer any decent help
2008-02-20T21:04:00.000Z	brunner	bazhang	after the stage when I had to select which software packages I wanted, it presented some sort of generic error stating the the download failed or that a packaged failed to install.  later on, the grub install failed as well.
2008-02-20T21:05:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	you burned the minimal cd iso to disk?
2008-02-20T21:05:00.000Z	brunner	bazhang	yes. yesterday.
2008-02-20T21:06:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	you said that the disk was damaged; is this a different disk? if so, which one is the damaged one?
2008-02-20T21:08:00.000Z	brunner	bazhang	I'm running off of the live cd, which is obviously not the minimal cd.  There is only one cd drive that I can boot from, and I'm using it now.
2008-02-20T21:09:00.000Z	bazhang	brunner	I would suggest trying the minimal burn again--it seems that you burned it at the wrong speed or the media itself is faulty
2008-02-20T21:09:00.000Z	brunner	bazhang	okay, thanks.
