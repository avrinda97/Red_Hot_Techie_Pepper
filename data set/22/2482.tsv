2009-06-22T23:24:00.000Z	FFMike		yeah
2009-06-22T23:25:00.000Z	FFMike		tax - yeah it has a cd
2009-06-22T23:25:00.000Z	FFMike		tax - is livecd similar to running the remix/flash drive deal?
2009-06-22T23:25:00.000Z	FFMike		no it's not a netbook at all
2009-06-22T23:26:00.000Z	FFMike		actually :P
2009-06-22T23:26:00.000Z	FFMike		i actually misread it and thought it was for all notebooks
2009-06-22T23:26:00.000Z	FFMike		alright well as soon as the wife gets home with some cd's I'll oad up the live cd
2009-06-22T23:26:00.000Z	FFMike		until that point, if I'm just running live-cd, I don't need to worry about cleaning off my second partition right?
2009-06-22T23:27:00.000Z	FFMike		gotcha, makes sense..
2009-06-22T23:27:00.000Z	FFMike		I think if i like this, I'll probably end up getting a netbook for ubuntu.. a nice one out there for $250 right now..
2009-06-22T23:27:00.000Z	cabrey	FFMike	make sure you don't get the SSD variety
