2010-12-18T21:30:00.000Z	vipul		then type a new password
2010-12-18T21:30:00.000Z	vipul		but when i try sign off and again try to root user the old password was working not new

2010-12-18T21:30:00.000Z	vipul		then i used sudo passwd

2010-12-18T21:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	vipul	you just use « passwd » in a terminal with no sudo
2010-12-18T21:31:00.000Z	vipul		and again i changed a old password*
2010-12-18T21:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	vipul	you did it wrong
