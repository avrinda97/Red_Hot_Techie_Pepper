2006-03-29T11:14:00.000Z	Eleaf		Man, I'm getting pretty bad freezups in Ubuntu on my server
2006-03-29T11:14:00.000Z	Eleaf		I think it's only in X, but it has gotten substantially worse
2006-03-29T11:14:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	might be a bad driver.
2006-03-29T11:14:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	really?
2006-03-29T11:15:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	my only experience with freezing was when using a bad ndiswrapper driver.
2006-03-29T11:17:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	wfm.
2006-03-29T11:17:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	works for me.
2006-03-29T11:17:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	haha. the live screenshot thing is great.
2006-03-29T11:17:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	It isn't running right now though
2006-03-29T11:18:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	I don't have X running currently.
2006-03-29T11:18:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	I don't even have x installed on my server.
2006-03-29T11:18:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	I do use this server for generally browsing and working on some stuff though (programming, etc.)
2006-03-29T11:19:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	yeah.
2006-03-29T11:19:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	I wouldn't have X installed normally on this server, but it's multi-purpose.
2006-03-29T11:19:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	yep.
2006-03-29T11:24:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	I wonder how I should get some of these processes down.  I'm currently running 75 processes with no X.   (come on, I should get it to be like 10 ;))
2006-03-29T11:24:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	yeah, that does sound like a lot. :\
2006-03-29T11:28:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	dapper 8% ;)
2006-03-29T11:28:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	on my 256k up/down line yay.. lol
2006-03-29T11:28:00.000Z	ispiked	Eleaf	ouch.
2006-03-29T11:29:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	I also have a 1.5 mbit down / 800 Kbps up line.
2006-03-29T11:29:00.000Z	Eleaf	ispiked	I still insist on using this line for my server ;)
