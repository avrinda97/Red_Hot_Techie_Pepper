2005-06-01T11:56:00.000Z	spinifex		maybe if you wrote something to run `ps aux` every half a second?
2005-06-01T11:57:00.000Z	spinifex		heh, that reminds me of when I tried to take apart an old compaq.  Ouch...
2005-06-01T11:59:00.000Z	spinifex		hey, you forgot "Real Computer Users"
2005-06-01T11:59:00.000Z	spinifex		what about the people who just want to use a computer, and not spend all day setting it up?
2005-06-01T11:59:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	that's fine :) but he obviously does
2005-06-01T12:16:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	huh - have you used any other distributions with GNOME? :p
2005-06-01T12:17:00.000Z	spinifex	reisio	yes.  Red Hat 9, Debian Woody, and SuSE (ick!)
2005-06-01T13:09:00.000Z	spinifex	reisio	bad reason.  Using dvorak nearly /always/ pisess people off instead of impressing them
2005-06-01T13:09:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	no I mean to be able to switch from QWERTY to Dvorak
2005-06-01T13:34:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	right-click on panel, hit "Add"
2005-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	that sounds so crazy :p
2005-06-01T13:57:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	left panel is not flash
2005-06-01T14:05:00.000Z	spinifex	reisio	I already suggested that, but he says he has
2005-06-01T14:12:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	might be missing some codecs
2005-06-01T14:13:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	hopefully you can get them through apt
2005-06-01T14:13:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	as deps for mplayer
2005-06-01T14:13:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	dunno, though
2005-06-01T14:13:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	that's how it works for Gentoo
2005-06-01T14:18:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	different codecs
2005-06-01T14:36:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	well that's because of bad programming :p
2005-06-01T14:36:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	usually :)
2005-06-01T14:40:00.000Z	reisio	spinifex	the desktop, basically
