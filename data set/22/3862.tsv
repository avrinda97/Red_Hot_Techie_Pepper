2008-05-10T03:48:00.000Z	Invisionfree		I installed EasyCam2, but when I type "lauchcam2" in a terminal, it doesn't open .. Why?! :(
2008-05-10T03:50:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	Have you tried testing the webcam with anything yet?  Like VLC?
2008-05-10T03:50:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	The light at the top isn't even on..
2008-05-10T03:51:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	I can't say about the light, but if it were me, I would test it just to see.
2008-05-10T03:52:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	Fine, but if it only shows up under lsusb, and nothing else anywhere, what do I do with it?
2008-05-10T03:52:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	You do not have /dev/video or /dev/video0?
2008-05-10T03:53:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	I got /dev/video0
2008-05-10T03:53:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	Who knows, maybe the beast will work plug and play - get VLC and open up the camera as a capture device.
2008-05-10T03:54:00.000Z	Invisionfree		Ahh, crazybagua, I got it working, I had VLC looking for /dev/video -_-
2008-05-10T03:54:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	Point it to /dev/video0 as the source of course
2008-05-10T03:54:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	Excellent.
2008-05-10T03:54:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	Next question, how can I make it display a live feed :o
2008-05-10T03:54:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	Display it where?
2008-05-10T03:55:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	Basically output it to a .ogg file, and stream it live to my other box here
2008-05-10T03:56:00.000Z	crazybagua		Should be simple, Invisionfree.  But I have not done it.  Have you tried dumping the video capture to a file, and then streaming the file using a stream server?
2008-05-10T03:57:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	How
2008-05-10T03:57:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	Like, what stream server
2008-05-10T03:57:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	But VLC can stream it by itself you know.
2008-05-10T03:57:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	1) How, 2) How can I speed it up :x
2008-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	unless you are hard-wired, your wireless will be your bottleneck
2008-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	Invisionfree	crazybagua	Both me and my server are on wireless
2008-05-10T03:58:00.000Z	crazybagua	Invisionfree	Check out the VLC pages. I don't mean to bail on you, but time for me to give my little one a bath
