2009-09-25T09:28:00.000Z	webbb82	lstarnes	thank you
2009-09-25T09:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	how you edit it is usually a matter of personal preference
2009-09-25T09:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	off-topic
2009-09-25T09:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	an editor
2009-09-25T09:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	vim is usually used instead of vi, but it's based on vi
2009-09-25T09:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	yes
2009-09-25T09:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	it's short for vi improved, but is almost always called vim
2009-10-12T08:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	you only need one ? mark.  That's usually an extension for xulrunner, firefox, or thunderbird
2009-10-12T08:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	firefox and thunderbird can load it through their graphical interfaces.  I think xulrunner has a command-line method

2009-10-22T08:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	not the official ones
2009-10-22T08:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	google has their own apt repo for it
2009-11-07T09:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	check its instructions first
2009-11-07T09:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	you may need to run other commands before make install (if it even uses make install)
2009-11-07T09:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	usually there's a configure script for making a Makefile
2009-11-23T09:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	that package could not be downloaded
2009-11-23T09:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	or the version of the file there is different than what apt expected
2009-12-15T09:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	webbb82	when nickserv works fully again, see /msg nickserv help set password
