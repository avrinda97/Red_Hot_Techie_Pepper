2009-01-08T22:15:00.000Z	Wingard		How can I check outputs xrandr is able to use?
2009-01-08T22:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	type xrandr in a terminal?
2009-01-08T22:16:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	That shows available modes, I need available outputs.
2009-01-08T22:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	as in # of displays? not sure what you mean by outputs
2009-01-08T22:18:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	xrandr --addmode requires an output to add the mode, but I can't figure out the output to use.
2009-01-08T22:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	man xrandr has lots of info on outputs.  "Per-output options" --output selects an output to reconfigure. Use either the name of the output or the XID..
2009-01-08T22:20:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	I already checked the man page. The problem is that I don't know the name of the output.
2009-01-08T22:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	is this nvidia? have you also tried using nvidia-settings?
2009-01-08T22:23:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	Yes, I've tried nvidia-settings. That is an utterly worthless utility.
2009-01-08T22:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	are you trying for dual monitors?
2009-01-08T22:23:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	No, I'm trying for a resolution above 1024x768.
2009-01-08T22:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	is the size you need available in the list displayed with xrandr in a terminal?
2009-01-08T22:25:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	No, nor is it displayed in nvidia-settings, or System > Preferences > System Resolution. I do know the video card and monitor are capable of the resolution I want, considering it worked fine in Windows.
2009-01-08T22:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	dumb question but I gotta ask, did you turn on the restricted nvidia driver in System>Admi>Hardware drivers? or install nvidia's driver directly from their site .. or none of the above?
2009-01-08T22:27:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	Used System > Administration > Hardware drivers
2009-01-08T22:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	xorg shouldn't have anything in it really.. just generic stuff.  did you reboot after turning on the Hardware drivers?
2009-01-08T22:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	Vs. 177 has issues with some cards.. what card do you have.?
2009-01-08T22:29:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	GeForce 6200
2009-01-08T22:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	go with the 173 driver.. it will/should work great with the 6200.  That's a good series of cards.
2009-01-08T22:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart to restart
2009-01-08T22:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	Wingard	you'll find a lot of adventure and fun here in linux land.
2009-01-08T22:32:00.000Z	Wingard	Scunizi	I've used Linux before, though most recently it was Debian 4.0 before it started sucking.
