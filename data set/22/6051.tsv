2009-01-07T01:45:00.000Z	bmhm		Can someone confirm Bug 313448 for me?
2009-01-07T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	link to it?
2009-01-07T01:45:00.000Z	bmhm	Slart	https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mplayer/+bug/313448
2009-01-07T01:45:00.000Z	bmhm	Slart	sorry i thought some bot would post a link
2009-01-07T01:46:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	it usually posts the bug name if you post a link to it..
2009-01-07T01:46:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	nope.. mplayer works here.. no segfault
2009-01-07T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	but I'm on 64 bit ubuntu
2009-01-07T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	oh.. you're too
2009-01-07T01:47:00.000Z	bmhm	Slart	what's next to do then?
2009-01-07T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	hmm.. I suppose you've tried reinstalling and so on.. also tried switching mirrors?
2009-01-07T01:50:00.000Z	bmhm	Slart	no, not yet. I compiled it myself, it worked.
2009-01-07T01:54:00.000Z	bmhm	Slart	What do you recommend I do next?
2009-01-07T01:55:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	try to narrow it down.. see if it affects both 32bit and 64bit ubuntu.. try reinstalling.. see if it works on KDE.. in a vm..
2009-01-07T01:55:00.000Z	bmhm	Slart	well that's WAY too much work. I just want it running.
2009-01-07T01:55:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	then do what you just did.. make other people do the same.. try to find a pattern.. perhaps it's only your computer, perhaps it's everyone using a special processor.. special brand of memory.. etc etc
2009-01-07T01:56:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	then do what you've already done, compile it yourself if that helps
2009-01-07T01:56:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	or find another package etc
2009-01-07T01:56:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	apart from that it's not a lot you can do about a segfault
2009-01-07T01:56:00.000Z	bmhm	Slart	It's still a pain in the neck to compile it myself. I was waiting for other ppl confirming my prob
2009-01-07T01:57:00.000Z	Slart	bmhm	good luck
