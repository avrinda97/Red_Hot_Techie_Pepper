2007-02-26T16:10:00.000Z	rmd_	Cosine	ok.  armed with this new information start Googling "proftpd.conf", or "missing arguments on line 18 of '/etc/proftpd.conf" or "GProFTP configuration"
2007-02-26T16:11:00.000Z	Cosine		ok, thanks for your help
2007-02-26T16:12:00.000Z	rmd_	Cosine	no problemo.  If you need anything be sure to come back and ask some more.  Never know if someone might have a better answer.
