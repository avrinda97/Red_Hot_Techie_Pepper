2010-05-04T14:30:00.000Z	andy112233		Hi everyone. After installing Lucid Lynx, my system frequently crashes (screent turns black, system reboots). Is there a known bug? Also changed from ext2 to ext4. Thanks!
2010-05-04T14:30:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	did you take a look into your system  logs?
2010-05-04T14:30:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	after bootup verify if some hardware stuff hasnt been detected correctly...use dmesg
2010-05-04T14:32:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	system logs are under /var/log/  take a look at files like syslog and messages.......... after a fresh reboot type   dmesg   in  a terminal window....you can see what has been going on at boot time....dmesg | less maybe to pageinate
2010-05-04T14:36:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	sr0 is bad.....io stuff can often lead to locked systems
2010-05-04T14:37:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	remove disks from your optical drivers
2010-05-04T14:38:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	What's sr0? What means "lock up"? To crash? And why do I have an fd0 floppy drive appearing?
2010-05-04T14:38:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	if this doesnt help, your drives optical lense may have problems
2010-05-04T14:38:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	sr0 in common is the first optical drive on your system
2010-05-04T14:39:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	Thanks
2010-05-04T14:39:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	And what's the matter with fd0?
2010-05-04T14:40:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	whats your system? scsi? sata?
2010-05-04T14:41:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	sata. I think I have a BIOS setup which lets SATA drives appear as IDE. Should I turn off this feature? I cannot imagine my optical drive crashing the system since it is quite new and never made any problems with karmic koala.
2010-05-04T14:43:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	the cd in it could be damaged too....
2010-05-04T14:43:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	but i think something wired is going on....
2010-05-04T14:43:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	It's a blank DVD which I haven't used yet.
2010-05-04T14:44:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	remove it! blank disks
2010-05-04T14:44:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	The system crashes appeared even before inserting this DVD.
2010-05-04T14:44:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	just to make sure pls
2010-05-04T14:45:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	Just to make sure I get you right: You suggest that keeping the DVD-burner empty whenever possible will prevent the crashs?
2010-05-04T14:47:00.000Z	beli	andy112233	try it...it's to find the source of the problem...not ment as a solution
2010-05-04T14:48:00.000Z	andy112233	beli	Okay thanks. I will also try to edit my BIOS setup and disable floppy features and this SATA-as-IDE-feature.
