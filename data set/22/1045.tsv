2011-07-19T18:29:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	sudo chown www-data:<you> them and then chmod 775 them
2011-07-19T18:31:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	if I chown that directory, then how will www-data have access to it?
2011-07-19T18:31:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	because I made www-data the owner and you the group owner.  so you both have access.  There is more than just owner ya-know :)
2011-07-19T18:33:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	so I should do that to the main directory of the website?
2011-07-19T18:33:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	I gave incomplete commands and the solution I gave is one of many (perhaps not the BEST) but it will work just fine.  Would you like complete commands?
2011-07-19T18:34:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	yes. Basically i have this directory called 'foo' which is my website. I want it to be both read/write accessible to www-data (apache) and my user (so php command line) can access it too.
2011-07-19T18:34:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	and I want the permission to be recursive on ALL the files under this. (This is a development server, so I don't have to worry much about security)
2011-07-19T18:35:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	sure, what is the path to the dir? (of course recursive :) )
2011-07-19T18:35:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	/home/dayson/projects/www/textme
2011-07-19T18:35:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	^^ that's my website directory.
2011-07-19T18:36:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	Perhaps it would be more proper to make you the owner and www-data the group owner  since it's in your home
2011-07-19T18:36:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	hang on
2011-07-19T18:36:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	yes
2011-07-19T18:36:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	but it has to also ensure that all 'dynamically' generated files are created with permissions accessible to both my user and www-data
2011-07-19T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	I was afraid you'd say that.  That' part is harder.
2011-07-19T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	I have to look it up first
2011-07-19T18:37:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	the whole crisis is happening _because_ my php console scripts cant access the files created by apache :-(
2011-07-19T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	yeah, hang on
2011-07-19T18:39:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	alright I found a way.  PM me?
2011-07-19T19:27:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	you around?
2011-07-21T00:10:00.000Z	Soothsayer	edbian	hey mate!
2011-07-21T00:10:00.000Z	edbian	Soothsayer	hello :)
