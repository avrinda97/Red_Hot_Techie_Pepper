2012-08-24T22:17:00.000Z	damien		Hi, anyone knows how configure RAID1 disks given that they have already been mirrored earlier under Windows 7 (and I do not want to erase one of these two)
2012-08-24T22:18:00.000Z	bekks	damien	Yes. No chance, to be exact.
2012-08-24T22:21:00.000Z	bekks	damien	It is not possible.
2012-08-24T22:21:00.000Z	bekks	damien	Really.
2012-08-24T22:24:00.000Z	bekks	damien	NOT possible.
2012-08-24T22:24:00.000Z	bekks	damien	There is NO way to use a software based mirror in linux AND in windows.
2012-08-24T22:26:00.000Z	bekks	damien	For creating a _linux_-based software RAID. NOT for creating a software raid that can be used by windows too.
2012-08-24T22:30:00.000Z	bekks	damien	You will have to format both disks, not only one...
2012-08-24T22:31:00.000Z	bekks	damien	And you will not be able to use that RAID1 from the other OS.
2012-08-24T22:32:00.000Z	bekks	damien	Well, face it, that how things work :)
2012-08-24T22:37:00.000Z	bekks	damien	I am just typing the first letters of your name, press the tab key, and my IRC client expands it to "damien: " -- thats called "tab completion".
2012-08-24T22:37:00.000Z	damien	bekks	oki
2012-08-24T22:37:00.000Z	bekks	damien	The second answer means that you will introduce three RAID1, not one.
2012-08-24T22:38:00.000Z	damien	bekks	yes, 3 raid1 relying on 2 hard drives
2012-08-24T22:39:00.000Z	bekks	damien	Whats on those three partitions?
2012-08-24T22:40:00.000Z	damien	bekks	what do you mean ? the content ? just personal file on one hand, professional files on the second, and entertainement on the third one
2012-08-24T22:40:00.000Z	damien	bekks	NTFS for entertainement and the rest in ext3
2012-08-24T22:40:00.000Z	bekks	damien	So not separated like "one for linux, one for windows, one for sharing between linux and windows"?
2012-08-24T22:41:00.000Z	bekks	damien	Again: no chance to mirror using linux when going to use it from windows -- which is the ONLY valid reason for using NTFS.
2012-08-24T22:43:00.000Z	damien	bekks	understood, but again, I do not want to use windows anymore. I will only access my files from ubuntu as from now on.
2012-08-24T22:43:00.000Z	bekks	damien	then you dont need ntfs. :)
2012-08-24T22:45:00.000Z	damien	bekks	ok thanks.
