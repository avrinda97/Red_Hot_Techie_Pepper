2007-04-25T15:15:00.000Z	abo		after upgrading to feisty I can't mount ntfs drives anymore, can anyone help please (they used to automatically mount without any problem)
2007-04-25T15:16:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	FUSE installed? ntfs-3g installed?
2007-04-25T15:16:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	I used to have ntfs-3g installed, will it be disabled or still installed, how can I tell?
2007-04-25T15:18:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	I have this in my /etc/fstab :  /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1 ntfs-3g auto,gid=1001,umask=0002 0 1
2007-04-25T15:19:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	$ sudo mount /media/hdb1/   would give me : Failed to access '/dev/hdb1': No such file or directory ... which I found strange
2007-04-25T15:20:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	- is /media/hdb1 created?
2007-04-25T15:20:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	yes.. but effectively I can't find /dev/hdb1 anymore ...
2007-04-25T15:21:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	- what happens if you do a 'fdisk -l' do you see /dev/hdb1?
2007-04-25T15:25:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	intresting... it seems weird... everything that used to be sda is now sdb... and I can't see hdb
2007-04-25T15:25:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	there you go.
2007-04-25T15:25:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	where did my /dev/hdb drive go?
2007-04-25T15:26:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	how can I tell what's it's new name?
2007-04-25T15:28:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	try mounting one of them
2007-04-25T15:28:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	one of them? them who?
2007-04-25T15:29:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	try any of them
2007-04-25T15:32:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	ok the sdb ones mounts fine now... but there is still my hdb that I need and I can't find
2007-04-25T15:33:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	check hdb's physical connections
2007-04-25T15:34:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	are you sure sdb isn't your former hdb?
2007-04-25T15:34:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	it's inside my computer ... what would the physical connection be lost after an upgrade to Feisty, ... my former sda is my current sdb (this is the SATA drive) ... I still can't find my former hdb?
2007-04-25T15:35:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	it's inside my computer ... why would the physical connection be lost after an upgrade to Feisty, ... my former sda is my current sdb (this is the SATA drive) ... I still can't find my former hdb?
2007-04-25T15:37:00.000Z	Lilacor	abo	from which drive are you booting?
2007-04-25T15:51:00.000Z	abo	Lilacor	ok.. I found out what's the new name of the disk: /dev/sdb1 instead of /dev/hdb1 ... tx
