2009-02-19T17:59:00.000Z	hareldvd		since kaudiocreator can not be installed due to it's dependencies (kdemultimedia-kio-plugin 3.5) I am looking for a recommendation on another ripping software.
2009-02-19T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	what does it do?
2009-02-19T18:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	konqueror can rip cds
2009-02-19T18:02:00.000Z	hareldvd	ActionParsnip	Do you recommend it?
2009-02-19T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	if you cant install via cd, yes
2009-02-19T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	if you can install via cd i'd use that, its less complex to burn a cd and boot from it than put all the various gumf on a usb stick to boot from it
2009-02-19T18:05:00.000Z	hareldvd	ActionParsnip	any gnome ripping package you would recommend?
2009-02-19T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	for ripping what?
2009-02-19T18:06:00.000Z	hareldvd	ActionParsnip	CDs
2009-02-19T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	grip is one option
2009-02-19T18:06:00.000Z	hareldvd	ActionParsnip	I used it. Anything better tnan that?
2009-02-19T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	there is no better or "best" just wat you like
2009-02-19T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	try a tonne of apps then choose one you like
2009-02-19T18:07:00.000Z	hareldvd	ActionParsnip	OK, thanks.
2010-07-14T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	there is no single answer, you need to reboot and count the options down, then set it to that
2010-07-14T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	you could have 20 kernels installed and the number will be greater than if you had 1 or 2
2010-07-14T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	there is no ONE answer, we can only tell you HOW you can get it yourself
2010-07-14T23:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	yes you count those, count them all
2010-07-15T00:00:00.000Z	hareldvd	ActionParsnip	Can I control the amount of Kernels saved for backup?
2010-07-15T00:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	you can remove unused kernels to reduce entrys
2010-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	hareldvd	ActionParsnip	can the update_manager get configured to hold just 2?
2010-07-15T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hareldvd	you can tell grub to only hold 2 but update manager will not, you must manually remove
