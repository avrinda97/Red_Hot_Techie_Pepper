2007-01-20T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	thug	do you tend to run a lot of gui programs with sudo?
2007-01-20T06:47:00.000Z	thug	jrib	no not really why ?
2007-01-20T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	thug	because you don't have permissions on a lot of the stuff in your home.  What does this say:  ls -ld /home/thug/.{kde,qt,gnome,local}

2007-01-20T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	thug	sudo chown -R $USER: ~        this will restore ownership of all of the files in your $HOME to your user
2007-01-20T06:50:00.000Z	thug	jrib	thank you, works :)
2007-01-20T06:50:00.000Z	thug	jrib	how did it got change ?
2007-01-20T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	thug	usually happens if you use sudo on a gui app, you should use gksudo (in gnome) or kdsu (in kde) for gui apps.  And that should be rare too
2007-01-20T06:51:00.000Z	thug	jrib	ok thanks
