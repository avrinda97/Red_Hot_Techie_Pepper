2007-10-11T09:48:00.000Z	mythri1		For some reason or another my scroll wheel stopped functioning, but the ZAxisMapping is set up properly (as far as I can tell), is there something else I need to make sure is set up right?
2007-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	there should be a line Option         "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2" or Option         "Protocol" "ImPS/2"
2007-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	I see the ImPS/2 one
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	has it stopped in all applications?
2007-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	so far, firefox, gaim, gedit
2007-10-11T09:53:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	any other ideas (scrolll wheel thing)?
2007-10-11T09:54:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	has it just failed in this session, or have you rebooted since?
2007-10-11T09:54:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	rebooted twice
2007-10-11T09:55:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	anything suspicios in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ? Look for lines that start with EE
2007-10-11T09:57:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	only stuff about my wacom tablet (which hasn't been attached for nearly 6 months)
2007-10-11T09:57:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	have you tested the mouse wheel on another machine?
2007-10-11T09:58:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	so what has changed since yesterday?
2007-10-11T09:59:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	is it a USB mouse?
2007-10-11T10:01:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	any chance you can plug it into a USB port?
2007-10-11T10:01:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	no difference
2007-10-11T10:02:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	also, run a 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and watch while you unplug and replug. Any errors logged?
2007-10-11T10:09:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	no difference
2007-10-11T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	logs?
2007-10-11T10:10:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	again only wacom errors
2007-10-11T10:10:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	run a 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and watch while you unplug and replug. Any errors logged?
2007-10-11T10:12:00.000Z	mythri1	soundray	nothing looks out of place in syslog
2007-10-11T10:13:00.000Z	soundray	mythri1	I suspect a hardware fault then. Some dirt blocking the optical sensor. Borrow another mouse to test, or test yours elsewhere.
