2012-01-12T03:38:00.000Z	skone		I just created a couple users and don't want to give them access to sudo.  How do I do that from a command prompt?
2012-01-12T03:39:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	you don't have anything to do
2012-01-12T03:41:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	really ? didn't you get an error after typing the password for sudo ?
2012-01-12T03:42:00.000Z	skone	glebihan	no, I typed sudo then entered the user I created password and it worked
2012-01-12T03:42:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	how did you create the user ?
2012-01-12T03:43:00.000Z	skone	glebihan	just sudo adduser
2012-01-12T03:43:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	are those users in the admin group ?
2012-01-12T03:44:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	ok, but are they in the group ?
2012-01-12T03:45:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	cat /etc/group | grep admin
2012-01-12T03:45:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	or just "grep admin /etc/group" actually
2012-01-12T03:46:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	what does your /etc/sudoers file look like ?
2012-01-12T03:47:00.000Z	skone	glebihan	I know I didnt put them in there though
2012-01-12T03:48:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	really weird...
2012-01-12T03:48:00.000Z	skone	glebihan	I didnt even know where the file was :)
2012-01-12T03:49:00.000Z	skone	glebihan	one more thing, and I can probably google it, but with sudo can I have a seperate sudo password than my user password or would I just have to enable the root account to do that?
2012-01-12T03:49:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	well, use "sudo visudo" to remove the user from there (be careful, if you remove a line you shouldn't have, your main user could also end up not being able to use sudo)
2012-01-12T03:49:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	sudo cannot use a separate password
2012-01-12T03:49:00.000Z	skone	glebihan	i just cut that line out and verified the admin group was listed in there
2012-01-12T03:50:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	remember to use visudo in the future, it's a lot safer (it checks the file's syntax before letting you save it)
2012-01-12T03:51:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	IMO, it doesn't make a difference
2012-01-12T03:51:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	just make sure the password is string enough
2012-01-12T03:54:00.000Z	glebihan	skone	well, not really sure what to tell you there. Maybe you should just do what makes you the most comfortable (or ask in #ubuntu-server,maybe they can give better advice on this there)
