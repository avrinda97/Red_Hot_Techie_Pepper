2011-06-10T07:44:00.000Z	hypodermia		okay guys. i feel like i'm taking crazy pills. can anybody tell me if it's possible to tell ubuntu to open steam URLs using steam?
2011-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	is steam comptible with linux?
2011-06-10T07:46:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	runs in wine fine. tbqh i want the URIs handled with this command: wine c:\\program\ files\\steam\\steam.exe
2011-06-10T07:47:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	Do you mean you can't access the store and game trailers and what not?
2011-06-10T07:47:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	or you can't get firefox to link it to externally when clicking on a link?
2011-06-10T07:47:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	steam works perfectly. that latter (chrome, xdg-open, whathaveyou)
2011-06-10T07:48:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	nvm i probubly just didn't understand your question
2011-06-10T07:48:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	it'd be super sweet if i could set a URI handler for steam:// URI scheme that opened it with "wine c:\\program\ files\\steam\\steam.exe"
2011-06-10T07:48:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	AHH i wonder the same thing
2011-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	what kind of game do you get running with Wine nowa days? i play left 4 dead, tf2 and portal
2011-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	i don't own l4d, but tf2 and portal work flawlessly
2011-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	tbqh my experience was no different than windows. double-click steam installer, then use like normal.
2011-06-10T07:50:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	no kidding!? I remember why half-life2 would barley be compatible... with wine
2011-06-10T07:50:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	that works perfectly as well. i could dig up a screenshot or two...
2011-06-10T07:50:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	whats the frame rate difference from windows then ubuntu
2011-06-10T07:51:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	bear in mind i have no video card, just integrated intel graphics, but my experience is almost identical. maybe a tiny bit better performance with wine.
2011-06-10T07:51:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	http://s.zubon.org/20110606-08-Workspace1.png i was playing yesterday
2011-06-10T07:54:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	sick that looks like the same graphics quailty too!. UPDATE: i edited my /etc/apt/source.list to all say natty instead of my jaunty distro and im not getting any 404's yet, hopefully it will install tho
2011-06-10T07:54:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	it was really a pleasant experience tbqh. wine got their act together.
2011-06-10T07:55:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	looks like it's installing with a BUNCH of updates (obviously becuase 2 major version realeases LOL)
2011-06-10T07:56:00.000Z	Xenland	hypodermia	looks like i'll be upgrading to natty soon :P
2011-06-10T07:56:00.000Z	hypodermia	Xenland	good times :)
