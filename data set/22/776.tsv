2011-07-12T02:05:00.000Z	thesary		Hi all
2011-07-12T02:06:00.000Z	thesary		I am having a problem in Natty Narwhal -- my sound suddenly stopped working completely. I think I've figured out it's because pulseaudio has crashed, but I can't figure out how to fix it
2011-07-12T02:06:00.000Z	thesary		Can anyone help?
2011-07-12T02:07:00.000Z	thesary		Does anyone know how to fix a pulseaudio crash?
2011-07-12T02:08:00.000Z	ChogyDan	thesary	service pulseaudio status   ??
2011-07-12T02:09:00.000Z	thesary	ChogyDan	do I put that into terminal?
2011-07-12T02:09:00.000Z	ChogyDan		yes
2011-07-12T02:09:00.000Z	thesary		it says service configured for per-user sessions
2011-07-12T02:10:00.000Z	ChogyDan	thesary	same for me.  I think that means it is running
2011-07-12T02:10:00.000Z	thesary		Hm. And yet, I get no sound at all
2011-07-12T02:10:00.000Z	thesary		It suddenly stopped working about 4 days ago. After one restart, it worked for a minute, and then quit again
2011-07-12T02:10:00.000Z	thesary		I tried checking my preferences, and adding in a line for my soundcard, but with no luck
2011-07-12T02:11:00.000Z	ChogyDan	thesary	maybe try: sudo service pulseaudio restart
2011-07-12T02:12:00.000Z	thesary		gave me the same message, hm
2011-07-12T02:12:00.000Z	ChogyDan	thesary	still no sound though?
2011-07-12T02:12:00.000Z	thesary		nope, not at all
2011-07-12T02:15:00.000Z	thesary		I have found much for this about other versions of ubuntu, but nothing for nattynarwhal... everything i've checked seems to be telling me that everything is fine, unmuted, and working,
2011-07-12T02:15:00.000Z	thesary		except that PulseAudio has crashed, and now I guess it's telling me THAT is working too, but still won't play sound for music or alerts or movies or anything
2011-07-12T02:17:00.000Z	ChogyDan	thesary	how do you know that it has crashed?
2011-07-12T02:17:00.000Z	thesary		I am looking for the code that I used,
2011-07-12T02:17:00.000Z	thesary		it was some system probe that I entered into terminal and it popped up with a little box saying 'PulseAudio has crashed'
2011-07-12T02:19:00.000Z	ChogyDan	thesary	speaker-test?  I really don't know though
