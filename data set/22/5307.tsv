2007-05-28T16:59:00.000Z	saddeh		when i installed ubuntu i did 2 partitions, root (25gb) and onee another partition (not swap, nor i cant remember what it was) with 135gb, which doesnt show up now and i cant use it... any way tofix that?
2007-05-28T05:00:00.000Z	wols	saddeh	if it doesn't show up with df,  cat /proc/partitions and then add teh 135GB partition to fstab (if ti's already formatted)
2007-05-28T05:01:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	alright, now slowly :D what is df?
2007-05-28T05:01:00.000Z	wols	saddeh	man df
2007-05-28T05:01:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	kay... and /proc/partitions is empty
2007-05-28T05:02:00.000Z	wols	saddeh	if it's empty you can't run linux cause: you don't have any partitions to run from. so please rethink that statement
2007-05-28T05:02:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	 :)))) lol, but... ehm thats the file which opened with text editor, isnt it? and its blank sheet
2007-05-28T05:03:00.000Z	wols	saddeh	cat /proc/partitions
2007-05-28T05:03:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	it wrote me smth
2007-05-28T05:06:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	so after i made df it got me some kind of info, whats next? :D
2007-05-28T05:06:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	i mean... how do i partition my free space?
2007-05-28T05:07:00.000Z	wols	saddeh	use gparted
2007-05-28T05:07:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	k will install it now
2007-05-28T05:07:00.000Z	wols	saddeh	and you said you partitioned it already. so is that 135GB partition showing in /proc/partitions or not?
2007-05-28T05:07:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	nope. i thought i partioned it when i installed linux
2007-05-28T05:08:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	seems that i had only formatted it
2007-05-28T05:09:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	then i did partition it. nvm. ive run gparted and i have 2 partitions
2007-05-28T05:09:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	one is "/" and another is "/ush" which is for an unknown reason to me is particulary used (4gb)
2007-05-28T05:09:00.000Z	wols	saddeh	so why isn't it showing in /proc/partitions? also what is the output of df ?
2007-05-28T05:10:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	ah wait, it is showing in /proc/partitions
2007-05-28T05:13:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	ah well found it, tho its unusualy to me that it is in /usr folder :)
2007-05-28T05:13:00.000Z	saddeh	wols	unusual*.. thanks for ur time and help
