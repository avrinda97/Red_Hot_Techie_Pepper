2006-11-17T06:42:00.000Z	_joey	rausb0	yes
2006-11-17T06:42:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	which revision?
2006-11-17T06:42:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	thats not what i meant
2006-11-17T06:42:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	hardware revision b1
2006-11-17T06:43:00.000Z	_joey	rausb0	2.03
2006-11-17T06:44:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	look on backside of the stick. it says: model no. dwl-g122, h/w ver: b1, f/w ver: 1.00
2006-11-17T06:44:00.000Z	_joey	rausb0	god damn it I am telling 2.03
2006-11-17T06:45:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	i just wanted to make sure we are talking about the same hardware (which is not the case, i think)
2006-11-17T06:45:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	there might be slight differences. which usd id (vend/prod) does lsusb show?
2006-11-17T06:47:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	okay, mine is the same. i use the official driver from ralink (RT25USB-SRC-V2.0.8.0.tar.gz) and compiled it from source.
2006-11-17T06:47:00.000Z	_joey	rausb0	I am using the official driver too
2006-11-17T06:48:00.000Z	_joey	rausb0	rt2570
2006-11-17T06:48:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	hmm, no problems so far. but i havent used wpa for a longer period.
2006-11-17T06:48:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	the problem is that all drivers for this thing have the same module name
2006-11-17T06:49:00.000Z	_joey	rausb0	mine works all right when, however, it stop under average network load and I have to re-insert the module
2006-11-17T06:49:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	there is the ralink one, the sourceforge rt2570 and a hacked one to allow sending while in monitor mode
2006-11-17T06:50:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	didn't had that problem. the only thing that happens with all rt2570 drivers is that the system load goes up to 2.00 even if no traffic is happening.
2006-11-17T06:51:00.000Z	rausb0	_joey	(the load only goes to 2.00 when the interface is "up")
