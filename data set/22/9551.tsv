2007-04-13T14:39:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		I have a little problem when installing Ubuntu
2007-04-13T14:40:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		C'mon!!!!
2007-04-13T14:41:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		I don't know wich drives to mount
2007-04-13T14:41:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		When installing
2007-04-13T14:41:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		The installer restarts every time
2007-04-13T14:41:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	which version of ubuntu?
2007-04-13T14:41:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	if you can't identify your drives, the easiest way to do so is to boot off a live cd and have a look at them (making notes on paper)
2007-04-13T14:43:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	what kind of partitions?  NTFS?
2007-04-13T14:43:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	ubuntu will only mount those read-only.
2007-04-13T14:43:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	i'm confused.  why do you want to mount them?
2007-04-13T14:45:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	i would use a live cd to do that.  the version after 6.06 is a combo livecd/install cd...so you may want to use that
2007-04-13T14:45:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	isn't 6.06 LTS?
2007-04-13T14:45:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	the one after that is edgy
2007-04-13T14:45:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	which is not beta.
2007-04-13T14:46:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	well, you can hit ctrl+alt+f2 and then mount the partitions yourself, but this may be tough for a "newbie"
2007-04-13T14:47:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	so hit ctrl+alt+f2, and mount em
2007-04-13T14:47:00.000Z	pestilence	Drk_Guy	even though you just downloaded it, it's still almost a year old ;)
