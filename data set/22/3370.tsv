2008-10-05T12:44:00.000Z	fenerli7		nice, has a few things I've been waiting far too long for too
2008-10-05T12:45:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Sa[i]nT: yes, both ubuntu 8.10 and fedora 10 have a lot of nice features
2008-10-05T12:46:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Sa[i]nT: good, it will let them know they need to make it more obvious that the user should choose a suitable server
2008-10-05T12:46:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: alt-f2, gnome-do
2008-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: best to add gnome-do to your startup applications
2008-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	Pupeno1	fenerli7	I don't mean running the program, I'm mean launching the dialog. Gnome Do is already running.
2008-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	fenerli7	Pupeno1	start-space by default
2008-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿﻿Sa[i]nT: system>admin>software sources>choose best server
2008-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	Pupeno1	fenerli7	start?
2008-10-05T12:48:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: the "super" key
2008-10-05T12:48:00.000Z	Pupeno1		Oh, it's win-space... except I don't have a win-key on my keyboard.
2008-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: you can change it
2008-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	Pupeno1	fenerli7	do you know how?
2008-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: first, end gnome-do through system monitor, then alt-f2, gnome-do, that should open the dialog, then change the preferences
2008-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿chrisjunkie: shoot
2008-10-05T12:50:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿chrisjunkie: he means "dont ask to ask, just ask :)"
2008-10-05T12:51:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿brylie: right click, end process?
2008-10-05T12:52:00.000Z	Pupeno1	fenerli7	I'm sorry, it didn't open any dialog.
2008-10-05T12:53:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: oh :(, try open gconf-editor
2008-10-05T12:53:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: then go to apps/gnome-do/preferences
2008-10-05T12:54:00.000Z	fenerli7		﻿Pupeno1: change it to <Alt>space or something
2008-10-05T12:55:00.000Z	Pupeno1	fenerli7	thanks!
