2005-04-12T10:00:00.000Z	meatmanek		I don't want to start a distro war
2005-04-12T10:00:00.000Z	meatmanek		sorry 'bout that.
2005-04-12T10:01:00.000Z	meatmanek		so /var/tmp is on there
2005-04-12T10:02:00.000Z	meatmanek		as is /tmp
2005-04-12T10:02:00.000Z	meatmanek		well
2005-04-12T10:02:00.000Z	meatmanek		back up everything in /home
2005-04-12T10:02:00.000Z	meatmanek		and repartition
2005-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	meatmanek	what in the world do you need with that kind of hd space? just curious, b/c I'm having trouble figuring out how I'll ever fill my 80 even with 3 os's installed on it
2005-04-12T10:05:00.000Z	meatmanek	Quinn_Storm	I dunno, /dev/hda7              68G   53G   15G  78% /home
2005-04-12T10:05:00.000Z	meatmanek		and no, actually, I don't have any pr0n on there
2005-04-12T10:05:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	meatmanek	wow
2005-04-12T10:05:00.000Z	meatmanek		I could clean quite a bit of that out.
2005-04-12T10:06:00.000Z	meatmanek		but I already have the hard drive
2005-04-12T10:06:00.000Z	meatmanek		it's just a matter of backing up the old stuff
2005-04-12T10:06:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	meatmanek	its easy to back it up with cp to the other hd
2005-04-12T10:07:00.000Z	meatmanek	Quinn_Storm	I mean the stuff on the 160G.
2005-04-12T10:07:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	meatmanek	ahhh, ok
2005-04-12T10:08:00.000Z	meatmanek	Quinn_Storm	the fun part about that is it's from a Mac, and so formatted HFS+
2005-04-12T10:08:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	meatmanek	heh, well I think linux can handle reading that
2005-04-12T10:08:00.000Z	meatmanek	Quinn_Storm	kind of... I'll have to set up netatalk in order to transfer the Resource fork
2005-04-12T10:09:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	meatmanek	ahh, yeah, stupid mac and their resource forks
2005-04-12T10:09:00.000Z	meatmanek	Quinn_Storm	yeah, well, the Resource fork is kind of a good idea.
