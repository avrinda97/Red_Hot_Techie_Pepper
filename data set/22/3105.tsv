2009-08-01T09:43:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Going to System>Administration>Hardware Drivers may be an easier way of getting your wifi working.  It tries to autodetect what you need to have installed.
2009-08-01T09:45:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 That's generally what the Hardware Drivers tool is used for.  Wifi, and also getting graphics cards working better.
2009-08-01T09:46:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	im trying to find a program that i can use to make it easier to connect that actually shows me the network connections but i dont know what that program is can you help me im looking in the synaptics package manger and i typed in wlan
2009-08-01T09:49:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 The program you want to use is the Network Manager Applet on your panel.  If the panel applet doesn't display any wifi connections that means you need to install the drivers.  Do you see that applet?  If you are using a wired connection it probably looks like a black computer monitor.
2009-08-01T09:50:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	yes i see it but when i take out the ethernet cable it displays two computers with and orange x on the right bottom side
2009-08-01T09:51:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Yes, that's what I'd expect.  If you click it, does it give you a "Wireless Network" section?
2009-08-01T09:52:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	no it doesnt its odd is there a program i need to install or something
2009-08-01T09:54:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 You probably need to install the drivers for your wifi.  A lot of wifi cards don't work out of the box, because there are legal restrictions on how the drivers can be distributed.  Ubuntu has the Hardware Drivers tool to try to help people get this type of hardware working.  Did you try it?
2009-08-01T09:54:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	where do i start
2009-08-01T09:55:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Go to System>Administration>Hardware Drivers
2009-08-01T09:55:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	okay
2009-08-01T09:58:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	its up i have hardware drivers windows up
2009-08-01T09:59:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Does the window list any drivers in the box?  (Are you running Ubuntu 9.04?)
2009-08-01T10:01:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Do you know what version of Ubuntu you are running?
2009-08-01T10:01:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Was it active when the window first popped up?
2009-08-01T10:05:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Alright.  Check the network-manager applet to see if it is detecting wireless networks now.  If not, you might want to try restarting the computer.  If that doesn't work, there was a bug in Ubuntu 8.10 with getting some Atheros cards working and you need to install the linux-backports-modules-intrepid-generic package to make it work.  You can search for it in the Synaptic Package Manager you had open previously.
2009-08-01T10:06:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	okay i will just install the package
2009-08-01T10:07:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 Let me know if it works.
2009-08-01T10:08:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	okay
2009-08-01T10:09:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	should i restart my computer after i get the package
2009-08-01T10:10:00.000Z	omegamormegil	Xodiac13	 I'd check network manager first.  Sometimes it just starts working without a restart.  If it isn't working yet try the restart.
2009-08-01T10:10:00.000Z	Xodiac13	omegamormegil	okay i didnt see anything i will restart brb
