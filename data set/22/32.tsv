2012-10-22T05:13:00.000Z	MiningMarsh		myRednek: did you downlad a file ending in .deb?
2012-10-22T05:15:00.000Z	MiningMarsh		myRednek: ah. Try and extract the .deb and then poke in the preinst file to see where it stores the gz
2012-10-22T05:15:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	was kinda hoping someone would know offhand
2012-10-22T05:14:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	oh, that's been grabbed and installed, i'm referring to the gz that the dpkg --configure -a wants to grab
2012-10-22T05:16:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	let's put it this way, it keeps downloading to randomly-named gz files in /tmp...trying to find a way to make it quit and use a file i provided it
2012-10-22T05:18:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	well, that's no good
2012-10-22T05:26:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	What is the deb's name/location on the web?
2012-10-22T05:27:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	told you twice already, not talking about a deb, but a file the install program tries to run after you dpkg -i it
2012-10-22T05:27:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	I know. Iw as going to look at the deb and see if it has the location of where it expects the gz.
2012-10-22T05:28:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	oh, i think it's flash-plugin-nonfree
2012-10-22T05:28:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	part of xubuntu-restricted-extras deps
2012-10-22T05:28:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	what version? (I am on gentoo at this moment and cant downlaod it without a link...)
2012-10-22T05:29:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/flashplugin-installer
2012-10-22T05:29:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	this machine is far from up, and keeps dropping the download
2012-10-22T05:33:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	the installer seems to support what you want to do. give me a minute...
2012-10-22T05:33:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	i see that the program references a specific url...is there a way i can edit it to reference a file:// url?
2012-10-22T05:34:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	do echo $RET
2012-10-22T05:34:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	i think it just fixed itself...brb
2012-10-22T05:44:00.000Z	nyRednek	MiningMarsh	nope, didn't self-correct...pretended to finish, but failed
2012-10-22T05:45:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	oh, uhm... I guess I will look at that filea gain then
2012-10-22T05:48:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	think I found it
2012-10-22T05:49:00.000Z	MiningMarsh	nyRednek	from what I can tell, you can manually install it via /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/install_plugin "path to the flash plugin gz"
