2009-07-10T00:57:00.000Z	btnz		is there a way to make an actual phone call  with a modem connected?
2009-07-10T00:58:00.000Z	btnz		i'm not talking about voip
2009-07-10T00:59:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	a modem is not a phone. it can be used only for digital data transfers
2009-07-10T01:15:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	so, what kind of modme you have?
2009-07-10T01:17:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	ok, it's a umts modem. i don't think it's possible to use it for voice. maybe sms
2009-07-10T01:19:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	but, why you don't want to use skype, for example? with the skypeout option you can call everywhere at low cost
2009-07-10T01:22:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	i'm not 100% sure, but i don't think you can use the huwaei e169 for phone calls
2009-07-10T01:23:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	the simplier thing is to move the sim card on a cell phone
2009-07-10T01:23:00.000Z	btnz	K99Brain	as far as linux is concerned or in general?
2009-07-10T01:23:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	in general
2009-07-10T01:24:00.000Z	btnz	K99Brain	thing is - i have done it, but that was on a windows machine
2009-07-10T01:25:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	with which software? maybe you can try to use it with wine
2009-07-10T01:25:00.000Z	btnz	K99Brain	of course i could simply put the sim card back into my mobile but that'd mean that i couldnt go online on my notebook
2009-07-10T01:26:00.000Z	btnz	K99Brain	the proprietary software it came with 'umts modem manager' or something alike
2009-07-10T01:39:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	just some clarifications. the voice capability of the e169 is optional and not available anywhere. i have a e169 and i've never seen that option because here (in italy) is not available.
2009-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	i have searched on the huwaei web site and there is the downloadable software to do voice calls, but it's only for win/mac
2009-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	btnz	K99Brain	what system have you tested it on?
2009-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	i use it with win and ubuntu
2009-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	mainly in ubutnu
2009-07-10T01:41:00.000Z	btnz	K99Brain	also with the green-GUI software (win)
2009-07-10T01:43:00.000Z	K99Brain	btnz	my only suggestion is to try to use win software via wine, but i think will be hard that it will work.
2009-07-10T01:45:00.000Z	btnz	K99Brain	haven't really gotten down with wine so far as I'm pretty new to linux but i'll defenitely also give that one a try once i find the time to, thx
