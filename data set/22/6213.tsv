2007-04-21T05:20:00.000Z	kbrooks		I have a problem. A  basic one that Ubuntu seems to be missing.
2007-04-21T05:21:00.000Z	kbrooks		I have a wireless windows computer on a network. *How* (with or without samba) do I share files between the two of them?
2007-04-21T05:22:00.000Z	kbrooks		I prefer without samba
2007-04-21T05:22:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	Ubuntu can connect to windows shares out of the box
2007-04-21T05:22:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	I don't want to do a windows share for now. Must I?
2007-04-21T05:22:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	no, there's alternatives but less easy
2007-04-21T05:23:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	well, the reason is that I'm on xubuntu, heh :-)
2007-04-21T05:23:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	if you install cygwin on the windows machine you can use SSH, which is secure
2007-04-21T05:23:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	I can't install cygwin.
2007-04-21T05:24:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	that limits your options then. There's an X server for windows...
2007-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	or ftp...
2007-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	I'll try FTP. Is there a way to install in a few clicks?
2007-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	install on which?
2007-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	with sane configuration
2007-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	install on which what
2007-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	install ftp server or client on ubuntu or windows?
2007-04-21T05:27:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	the client is there already.
2007-04-21T05:28:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	i cant do one.
2007-04-21T05:28:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	is this a temporary solution?
2007-04-21T05:29:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	no, and will never be, unless the owner sells me the laptop
2007-04-21T05:29:00.000Z	latoo	kbrooks	um...email yourself the files in gmail.
2007-04-21T05:30:00.000Z	kbrooks	latoo	no, i;d rather ftp instead. thanks.
