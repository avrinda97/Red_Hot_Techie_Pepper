2008-11-05T14:13:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	if you lack read-permissions it wouldn√§t notice the medium, I suppose
2008-11-05T14:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	if I run it as root, permissions shouldn't be a problem
2008-11-05T14:14:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	oh that might be true..
2008-11-05T14:22:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	does it work with a live environment?
2008-11-05T14:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	I have no way of knowing
2008-11-05T14:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	1) how would I boot from a live cd then burn a cd, and 2) how would I burn the livecd in the first place?
2008-11-05T14:23:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	you dont ;P
2008-11-05T14:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	well there you go then
2008-11-05T14:23:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	you put the environment on a USB-stick instaed
2008-11-05T14:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	haven't got a big enough one
2008-11-05T14:24:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	w00t it only needs like 1gb
2008-11-05T14:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	I don't have USB sticks, they're just not something I use
2008-11-05T14:24:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	what a shame ;P
2008-11-05T14:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	what difference would booting from a live environment make anyway?
2008-11-05T14:25:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	so the only other choice is to boot the livecd from your hdd
2008-11-05T14:25:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	well it might be that during the install, some error snuck in.
2008-11-05T14:25:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	I've had that happen to my wifi once, worked great in live didn't work in installed
2008-11-05T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	worth a shot I suppose
2008-11-05T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	right, well, I'll go and get a USB drive then
2008-11-05T14:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ay^	I know the drive works perfectly
2008-11-05T14:27:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	you could boot it off of your hdd as well
2008-11-05T14:28:00.000Z	ay^	gordonjcp	tho I have to go to now, but there are ways at least.
