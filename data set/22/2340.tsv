2010-05-28T02:56:00.000Z	Green_		Can anyone else please help me then?
2010-05-28T02:57:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	go ahead and ask your question
2010-05-28T02:59:00.000Z	Green_	h00k	any ideas?
2010-05-28T02:59:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	I personally don't know, but it's good practice to ask every few minutes and someone will jump in if they're familiar
2010-05-28T03:00:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	can you boot from a CD or USB and fsck that drive?
2010-05-28T03:00:00.000Z	Green_	h00k	i can boot from a cd, but i will need guidance in fsck'ing
2010-05-28T03:00:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	sure, I have to run in a few, but I'm sure there'd be someone here that can definitely help you do that.
2010-05-28T03:01:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	If you know the drive, (/dev/sdX) it's as easy as opening a terminal when you boot from a CD/USB and run 'fsck /dev/sdX' in the terminal
2010-05-28T04:35:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	you're going to need to 'gksudo gedit /etc/defaults/grub' to open it as root
2010-05-28T04:35:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	Are you...on a server?
2010-05-28T04:36:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	then...nano is pretty easy: sudo nano /etc/defauts/grub
2010-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	Green_	h00k	says it's a new file
2010-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	h00k	Green_	uh. maybe it's /etc/default/grub then, sorry
