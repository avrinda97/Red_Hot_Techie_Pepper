2008-06-28T22:30:00.000Z	sinn2df		can anyone help with mouse cursor disapearing.  restarting X does not fix, have to reboot.   happens 2 or 3 times a day.
2008-06-28T22:30:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	um what kind of mouse?
2008-06-28T22:32:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	if its a wireless mouse, try changing the batteries?
2008-06-28T22:34:00.000Z	sinn2df	cirkit	it has rechargable batteries, and is currently pluged in.  the mouse still works, have to look for highlighted buttons, just the graphical cursor is gone.  had been using this mouse with slackware 12 for some time with no issues.
2008-06-28T22:35:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	hmm is the proper module loaded for your mouse device?
2008-06-28T22:38:00.000Z	sinn2df	cirkit	im not sure.  dont really know where to look, thought that maybe restarting the mouse handler would work but have only been using ubuntu for a few days and have not figured out where all the conf files are or what handlers and system servers are used.
2008-06-28T22:39:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	what is the name / model of your mouse?
2008-06-28T22:40:00.000Z	sinn2df	cirkit	targus amw15us
2008-06-28T22:46:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	hm try using mdetect to try and detect your wireless mouse
2008-06-28T22:50:00.000Z	sinn2df	cirkit	mdetect give /dev/psaus and intelimouse xserver-xorg-input-mouse is installed
2008-06-28T22:52:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	can you paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file please
2008-06-28T22:55:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	might wanna try changing the device being used for your mouse in xorg.conf
2008-06-28T22:56:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	try using /dev/input/mouse0
2008-06-28T22:56:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	/dev/psaux is psuedo so that may be why your mouse cursor gets lost
2008-06-28T22:57:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	"Protocol""auto-dev"
2008-06-28T23:24:00.000Z	sinn2df	cirkit	tried changing mose dev but no matter if i set it to auto dev, usb, ps2, imps2 there was either no cursor or mouse would not work at all.  thanks for your help though.  is there any program to help setup xorg.conf file.  i had to piece mine together from postings to beable to get monitor support.  i dont like the generic conf file generated by debconf.
2008-06-28T23:26:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	what graphics card do you have?
2008-06-28T23:28:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	X -configure
2008-06-28T23:28:00.000Z	sinn2df	cirkit	nvidia geforce 6150 le onboard
2008-06-28T23:34:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	backup your current xorg.conf and run nvidia-xconfig
2008-06-28T23:34:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	then restart once complete
2008-06-28T23:35:00.000Z	cirkit	sinn2df	np ;)
