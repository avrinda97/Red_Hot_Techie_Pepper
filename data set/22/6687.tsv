2006-12-20T17:53:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mzuverink	I have an iPod with the usb cable. It showed up on the desktop but I never got it to sync music. I installed rocbox and it works
2006-12-20T17:54:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mzuverink	rockbox
2006-12-20T17:55:00.000Z	mzuverink	DigitalNinja	I have no problems with the orig firmware, and I use rockbox too, but I bout a dock and through the dock it does not recognize the ipod anymore
2006-12-20T17:55:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mzuverink	I don't think roxkbox will work with the dock
2006-12-20T17:56:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mzuverink	the orig firmware should though. Might be a Linux thing
2006-12-20T17:56:00.000Z	mzuverink	DigitalNinja	i am trying to get it to recognize it through the org firmware from apple
