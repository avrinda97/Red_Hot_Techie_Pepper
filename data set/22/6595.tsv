2006-09-10T14:03:00.000Z	madcow		I have tried tutorials but mothing works, no not Dr. Madcow
2006-09-10T14:03:00.000Z	madcow		I have installed gtkpod and ipodder
2006-09-10T14:04:00.000Z	madcow		i believe the trouble is mounting ipod, though I can access through computer
2006-09-10T14:05:00.000Z	madcow		Hello ravenous??
2006-09-10T14:06:00.000Z	ravenous	madcow	i dont have much experience with it, mine works by mounting in console then running gtkpod with gksudo
2006-09-10T14:06:00.000Z	ravenous		never had to do anything else
2006-09-10T14:06:00.000Z	madcow		what is command for mounting it in console
2006-09-10T14:07:00.000Z	ravenous	madcow	depends on what device it is, but i do 'sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/ipod'
2006-09-10T14:07:00.000Z	madcow		"mount"  all by itself not mount dev/hds2
2006-09-10T14:08:00.000Z	madcow		when I do that it says "mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2006-09-10T14:08:00.000Z	madcow		"
2006-09-10T14:09:00.000Z	madcow		when I mount it says ".mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
2006-09-10T14:09:00.000Z	ravenous	madcow	no clue, your ipod may be formatted to something else, it doesnt ask me that
2006-09-10T14:10:00.000Z	ravenous		!fixres
2006-09-10T14:13:00.000Z	ravenous		!info dhcp-server
