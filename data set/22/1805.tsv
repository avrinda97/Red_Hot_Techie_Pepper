2010-01-02T07:36:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	*still* struggling with this? It's been 24 hours at least...
2010-01-02T07:36:00.000Z	JMONEY	losha	yea
2010-01-02T07:37:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	has this machine ever run ubuntu before?
2010-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	well that's a good sign, but they use totally different kernels. In your place, I would try downloading 8.04 instead. It's had tons of bugfixing and is probably the most stable of all the ubuntus...
2010-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	JMONEY	losha	thanks
2010-01-02T07:40:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	inferno_daulXEON: my current motherboard won't boot from sata cdroms, I had to add an ide cdrom to make it boot. But if you've booted *bsd with the same hardware, that's not *your* issue....
2010-01-02T07:43:00.000Z	JMONEY	losha	I'm going to download now.
2010-01-02T07:44:00.000Z	JMONEY	losha	he pmin me 2
2010-01-02T07:44:00.000Z	JMONEY	losha	so if I download 8.04 can I upgrade to 9.10 ?
2010-01-02T07:45:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	yes, though it's a long process, and we aren't even sure if 9.10 will run on your hardware. There are worse things than being stuck at 8.04....
2010-01-02T07:45:00.000Z	JMONEY	losha	I did install inside of windows and it worked.
2010-01-02T07:47:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	interesting. But it seems clear that we don't understand why you seem unable to install 9.10 onto disk. 8.04 would be an interesting data point, and give you something to work with. There's always virtualbox too if you wish....
2010-01-02T07:48:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	if we knew the answer to that, we'd have solved your problem....
2010-01-02T07:49:00.000Z	JMONEY	losha	yeah I know
2010-01-02T08:01:00.000Z	losha	JMONEY	I notice that google turns up quite a few matches on the error you report. You're obviously not the only person who's run into this issue, but I haven'
