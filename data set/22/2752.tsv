2009-03-29T10:28:00.000Z	zaccour		how come the network switch only works when its unplugged??
2009-03-29T10:30:00.000Z	QPrime	zaccour	surely you don't expect an answer for that question.
2009-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	actually its not what it seemed
2009-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	QPrime	zaccour	clarify :)
2009-03-29T10:32:00.000Z	zaccour		i have my ethernet cable plugged into the switch, and it connects auto etho when unplugged, but when i plug in the ac adapter it disconnects it
2009-03-29T10:32:00.000Z	zaccour		and at no time is it transmitting the signal to my ps3
2009-03-29T10:33:00.000Z	QPrime	zaccour	prolly not an ubuntu issue... I'll msg you.
2009-03-29T10:34:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	ok
2009-03-29T10:42:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	i figured it out thanks anyway
2009-03-29T10:43:00.000Z	QPrime		k
2009-03-29T10:43:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	but what i cant figure out is why it wont connect to my ps3
2009-03-29T10:43:00.000Z	zaccour		ill call sony about that one later
2009-03-29T10:45:00.000Z	QPrime	zaccour	auto-ned on a switch can sometimes fail for various reasons.  sometimes its as (simple/stupid) as improper implimentstion of the auto-negotiation protocol.  If the switch is a managed switch you can try and force duplex/speed.
2009-03-29T10:45:00.000Z	QPrime		auto-ned=auto-neg
2009-03-29T10:45:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	i dont know what you are talking about
2009-03-29T10:46:00.000Z	QPrime	zaccour	then change the cables and if that will not work get a different brand of switch.
2009-03-29T10:48:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	perhaps i should just return it and pay $10 more for a wireless router
2009-03-29T10:49:00.000Z	QPrime	zaccour	always an option...
2009-03-29T10:49:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	im gonna bring it back and exchange, ill be back within 30 minutes
2009-03-29T10:49:00.000Z	QPrime	zaccour	good luck.
2009-03-29T10:49:00.000Z	zaccour	QPrime	thanks
