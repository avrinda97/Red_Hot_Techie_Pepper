2008-07-09T17:25:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	I have been for 2 hours posting my problem, and no tesponse yet
2008-07-09T17:25:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	I have been for 2 hours posting my problem, and no tesponse yet
2008-07-09T17:26:00.000Z	djhash	chakir	are you currently in ubuntu?
2008-07-09T17:26:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	yes I am, actually is wubi
2008-07-09T17:27:00.000Z	djhash	chakir	i'm not familiar with wubi's installation.. and I can't just assume that the way it is installed is similiar to the regular ubuntu installation..
2008-07-09T17:28:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	yesterday the VPN connection was wroking properly, I haven't done any changes in the system, but todays it doesn't
2008-07-09T17:28:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	I restarted to XP, and I connected to VPN to the server, and it worked, so the server is ON
2008-07-09T17:28:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	I went back to Ubuntu, and it desn't work, it says that the modem unged up
2008-07-09T17:29:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	how is it possible that without making any changes from yesterday to date a tool doesn't workÂ¿????
2008-07-09T17:29:00.000Z	djhash	chakir	you probably are having a modem issue with ubuntu..
2008-07-09T17:29:00.000Z	djhash	chakir	 is it a dialup modem?
2008-07-09T17:30:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	but there is no modem...I'm connected thru LAN, and it is working fine sin I hace access to internet, I'm chating with you now, and I can make do a ping to the VPN gateway without any problem!
2008-07-09T17:31:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	is som kind of issue with Network Manager
2008-07-09T17:32:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	that's why I'm so angry, I was happy to be able to work in Linux, I like it, but I'm checking that it's unestable, I can't trust on it, I have several iissues with Evolution as well, anyway
2008-07-09T17:32:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	sorry not Linux, the APPS for Linux
2008-07-09T17:43:00.000Z	djhash	chakir	just like windows and everysingle other os in the planet.. during the boot process somethings might not have loaded in the proper order or a very small fault in hardware could've ended up in a certain module not loading properly... If shutting the computer down and then starting caused the problem.. then maybe restarting will fix it.. if not.. then reinstallation would be a good option..
2008-07-09T17:45:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	I'm really thinking in formating and installing a complete Ubuntu system instead of this .."whatever".. called "Wubi", just one big think is keeping me stick on XP partition: the email managing
2008-07-09T17:45:00.000Z	djhash	chakir	what email system do you use at work? Exchange or something else?
2008-07-09T17:46:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	My company has a Exchange server with NO IMAP, so.. I only managed to get them under Linux with Evolution, which is a $%%&$ becaus eit's always crashing, hanging, and most of the important outlook features are misssing
2008-07-09T17:49:00.000Z	djhash	chakir	i can't really tell you about evolution and exchange.. since I haven't used either in ubuntu..
2008-07-09T17:51:00.000Z	chakir	djhash	so that's the point for anyone who wants to quit from the "dark side" of MS tools in companies envairoments
