2009-12-26T11:40:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	What is your problem?
2009-12-26T11:42:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Is there encryption on the connection?
2009-12-26T11:42:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Yes.
2009-12-26T11:42:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	But you shouldn't be using WEP :P
2009-12-26T11:43:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	What do you mean by "it still doesn't work"?
2009-12-26T11:43:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Does it attempt to connect? Is there an error message?
2009-12-26T11:44:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Ah. Yeah then it's a driver like gaelfx said :D
2009-12-26T11:50:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Yes.
2009-12-26T11:50:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Is this an onboard wireless controller or a PCI slot?
2009-12-26T11:51:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	I would guess you might need to pull it out and write down the card model, manufacturer, name, etc.
2009-12-26T11:51:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Boot into windows and write down the hardware info on it.
2009-12-26T11:51:00.000Z	Snares	mota_	Do you know the model name?
