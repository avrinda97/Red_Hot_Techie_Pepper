2009-05-20T15:47:00.000Z	matmo		hello, sat here in dread looking at another kernel update :-( All previous ones got into a loop about merging changes (menu.lst?) and left the computer unbootable. I then had to do a usb boot to fix. Don't know if I have the patience for another round.
2009-05-20T15:49:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	I normally just pick the option for the package maintainers version and haven't had any problems
2009-05-20T15:49:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	Does that option leave the previous kernel?
2009-05-20T15:50:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	I've found that it add's the previous kernel's into the menu.list with the newest one at the top
2009-05-20T15:51:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	ok, good to know, thanks
2009-05-20T15:54:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	btw, are you dual booting?
2009-05-20T15:55:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	its set up for dual boot, although i don't boot into the other O/S very often
2009-05-20T15:57:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	ok. Now holding my breath while it updates... I may faint... especially if it's problem free :-)
2009-05-20T15:57:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	Good luck
2009-05-20T16:06:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	no fainting here. Exactly the same boot problem "Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition"
2009-05-20T16:07:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	Sounds strange, I've not seen error 17 before
2009-05-20T16:10:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	it's reported often. The boot menu line has no root device specified. Now if only could remember, "root (hd0,6)/..."
2009-05-20T16:11:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	Just picked up a point that error 17 is reported if the partition requested exists, but the filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB.
2009-05-20T16:12:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	yep, because of the missing entry for root device
2009-05-20T16:13:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	Maybe you should report it as a bug if you find it happens everytime you get a kernel update
2009-05-20T16:14:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	I will but I'm pretty sure it has been reported many time already
2009-05-20T16:14:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	luckily I have unetbootin also on the hd
2009-05-20T16:15:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	Good job you're used to it and expect it, at least you know what to do to fix it
2009-05-20T16:16:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	yeah, but I'm PO at having to go through the same pain every time
2009-05-20T16:23:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	relief, back up running, wifi not effected... my be my lucky-ish day :-)
2009-05-20T16:23:00.000Z	DJones	matmo	:)
2009-05-20T16:39:00.000Z	matmo	DJones	FYI (and others) a kernel update puts "root ()/ubuntu/disks" in every option in menu.lst instead of, in my case, "root (hd0,5)"
