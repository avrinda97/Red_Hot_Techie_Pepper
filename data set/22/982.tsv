2010-12-15T10:26:00.000Z	valke2		pkkid, awesome. thanks for passing along your new found knowledge.
2010-12-15T10:27:00.000Z	valke2		does ubuntu have a clipboard for when cut command is used?
2010-12-15T10:29:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	cut/copy keep just last entry, but there is some choice to extend it
2010-12-15T10:34:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	what have you cut/paste?
2010-12-15T10:35:00.000Z	valke2	shcherbak	my thesis and some other docs, all very small, at the most 10mb
2010-12-15T10:35:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	you mean files?
2010-12-15T10:36:00.000Z	valke2	shcherbak	you bet, all open office docs.
2010-12-15T10:36:00.000Z	valke2	shcherbak	from hd to thumb drive.
2010-12-15T10:36:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	testdisk is first stage, to check both drives
2010-12-15T10:37:00.000Z	valke2	shcherbak	how?
2010-12-15T10:38:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	you should not use drives to maximize chnces of succes. testdisk is rather simple,
2010-12-15T10:39:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	seluth-kit more advanced. you can download backtrack4 and run forensic mode, good how to in on ubuntu page.
2010-12-15T10:40:00.000Z	valke2	shcherbak	bad thing about why i was doing it...i don't have internet AT ALL avail on my notebook ii was trying to transfer from. just got new comp today.

2010-12-15T10:41:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	well whole idea is to not use notebook until you get files back or be certain that it is not possible.
2010-12-15T10:43:00.000Z	valke2	shcherbak	true. thankfully it's not a failed harddrive or a failed thumb drive. it's just, if the power cord get's juggled, it all dies.
2010-12-15T10:44:00.000Z	shcherbak	valke2	i think, scalpel and foremost will do job
2010-12-15T10:44:00.000Z	valke2	shcherbak	thanks. i'll see what i can do.
