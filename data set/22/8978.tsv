2005-04-10T16:25:00.000Z	andreas_		Confused
2005-04-10T16:25:00.000Z	Fikrann		dpkg-query -s zope
2005-04-10T16:26:00.000Z	andreas_		Package Zope is not installed
2005-04-10T16:26:00.000Z	andreas_		apt-get install zope?
2005-04-10T16:27:00.000Z	Fikrann	andreas_	check for zope2.7
2005-04-10T16:27:00.000Z	andreas_		zope2.7 - Open Source Web Application Server
2005-04-10T16:28:00.000Z	andreas_		Is this the one i am to install?
2005-04-10T16:28:00.000Z	Fikrann		zope2.7, good.
2005-04-10T16:28:00.000Z	andreas_		andreas@ubuntu:~ $ sudo apt-get install zope2.7
2005-04-10T16:28:00.000Z	andreas_		Reading package lists... Done
2005-04-10T16:28:00.000Z	andreas_		Building dependency tree... Done
2005-04-10T16:28:00.000Z	andreas_		zope2.7 is already the newest version.
2005-04-10T16:29:00.000Z	Fikrann	andreas_	btw, you might want to try apt-getting plone-site, it seems that its a metapackage that installs Plone and friends, then configures them for immediate use.
2005-04-10T16:30:00.000Z	andreas_	Fikrann	Thanks! Got it now
2005-04-10T16:30:00.000Z	Fikrann	andreas_	you're welcome
2005-04-10T16:31:00.000Z	Fikrann		By the way .. can anyone tell me if there are any pitfalls (like ethernet, usb not working) when installing Ubuntu on NForce based mobo?
2005-04-10T16:32:00.000Z	andreas_	Fikrann	When having done that 127.0.0.1 doesn`t get me there
2005-04-10T16:33:00.000Z	Fikrann	andreas_	zope by default is using different port, 8080, 9724, can't recall now what is standard.
2005-04-10T16:33:00.000Z	andreas_		Writing "port 8080" in firefox gets me here: http://grc.com/port_8080.htm
2005-04-10T16:34:00.000Z	Fikrann	andreas_	you want to check this addy: http://localhost:8080/
