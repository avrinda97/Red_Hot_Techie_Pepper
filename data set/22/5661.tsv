2008-03-15T07:53:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	thanks, i was just thinking about that.
2008-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	i think the hard drive has bad sectors, would a format with fdisk trigger the drive to replace those with spare sectors?
2008-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	badblocks does bad block checking.
2008-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	i think it's called that
2008-04-06T00:59:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	give me a sec i'm going to play around with the tools and see what they all do.
2008-04-06T01:00:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	i am running badblocks on the drive at the moment, i suppose it takes quite long. also, the drive gets mounted and recognized as an 80gb drive, allthough its a 250gb drive
2008-04-06T01:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	the partition on the dirve is prob only 80 gb
2008-04-06T01:01:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	i don't remember, but i don't think i wouldve created an 80gb partition for all the data, it seems to be capped
2008-04-06T01:03:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	can i use fdisk to low-level-format the drive?
2008-04-06T01:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	give me a bit....
2008-04-06T01:04:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	oh my god!
2008-04-06T01:04:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	i really put the wrong drive in
2008-04-06T01:04:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	it says right on the drive, 80gb. oh my word
2008-04-06T01:04:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	lol did you set any options with badblocks?
2008-04-06T01:05:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	no, but i have a backup of everything. the thing is, i have bought a 250gig hard drive for my server and i have no idea where it is!
2008-04-06T01:05:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	thanks a lot for your help
2008-04-06T01:05:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	if you set no options all the data will be there.
2008-04-06T01:06:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	as i said, i don't care about the data, but, how can i really make sure the drive is healthy?
2008-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	i don't know, you would have to ask someone else... this was already a bit father then my knolegde
2008-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	stefano_	Ashfire908	anyways, thanks again for your help
2008-04-06T01:08:00.000Z	Ashfire908	stefano_	sorry i wasn't of more help.
