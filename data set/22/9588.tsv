2004-08-30T15:41:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	nobody here has
2004-09-07T09:12:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	http://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r3/ has a couple packages in "need more info" status because they never built on hppa and/or ia64 ... got time to take a peek?
2004-09-07T09:43:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	curious... all of the packages marked 'MISSING hppa' I've looked at are either (1) built successfully long ago, or (2) not tried
2004-09-24T15:59:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	debian-only package (debootstrap) that I'm about to NMU has version 0.2.44 ... is 0.2.44.1 the right version for me to use for a source NMU?
2004-09-25T16:23:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	that's what I'd use
2004-09-25T16:44:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	thanks, I'm never sure what to do with debian-only version numbers...
2004-09-25T16:45:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	it's really a question of whether or not the previous version was an NMU..
2004-10-03T11:35:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	to the best of my knowledge, dselect is still the only front-end to package management that gets the handling of all dependency types right.
2004-10-03T11:35:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	yeah, but if you have binaries in your package, that depend on a shlib, is it _LEGAL_ to make that just a recommends?
2004-10-03T11:36:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	since I no longer use xmms, and never used any plugins, I'm not sure I care in this particular case.  [so slap me] 
2004-10-03T11:36:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	I only care because the bug landed in my lap.
2004-10-03T11:37:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	this sounds like anothe problematic example of handling optional functionality
2004-10-06T16:00:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	no frozen bubble in the default load?  ;-)
2004-10-06T08:30:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	I _TRIED_ to get f-b or kobo into the desktop seed, but it didn't happen..
2004-10-31T11:18:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	PSC-1315xi?
2004-10-31T11:19:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/suplist.shtml
2004-11-14T11:23:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	netperf likely as an eventual addition?
2004-11-14T11:23:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	not by default, but at least available...
2004-11-14T11:24:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	that could certainly go to multiverse today, and with a small license change, could go into at least universe, if not supported.
2004-11-14T11:24:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	have I poked you sufficiently, or do I need to note it somewhere else?
2005-03-21T15:08:00.000Z	lamont	bdale	still here?
2005-03-21T15:08:00.000Z	bdale	lamont	sort of
