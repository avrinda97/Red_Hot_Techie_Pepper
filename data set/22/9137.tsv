2006-05-27T11:45:00.000Z	Some_Person		I finally got ubuntu installed with LILO
2006-05-27T11:46:00.000Z	Some_Person		but how do i set it to use the VESA driver?
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	Some_Person		yes
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	Some_Person		it is set to use nv, but nv won't work with my video card for some reason
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	Some_Person		VESA does
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	Some_Person		on livecd, i use live-expert and tell it to use VESA driver
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	Some_Person		will it ask me for the driver?
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	Some_Person		so all i do is go to a command line and type in sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	yes and then you choose vesa when the card list comes up
2006-05-27T15:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	you don't want do to that, so I will say to you don't do that and there ya go
2006-05-27T15:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	now your getting sense
2006-05-27T15:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	^^^
2006-05-27T15:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	just a moment I am not a windows user
2006-05-27T15:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	but I will have an answer for you
2006-05-27T15:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	you need this in your /etc/fstab for that line >>>  vfat umask=000
2006-06-07T15:25:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	read that and check out modems http://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/desktopguide/en_GB/hardware.html
2006-06-16T10:06:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	that is not the issue, what is the issue is buggy hardware
2006-06-16T10:07:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	no it will not if they are on this channel, it is a matter of what port people connect to,
2006-06-16T10:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	I think your talking about something other than what I am talking about
2006-06-16T10:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	hardware choices can be important
2006-06-16T10:21:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	got a serial port? serial modems rock when it comes to comms and yes it is more hardware but they are just light and usefu
2006-07-12T08:21:00.000Z	ompaul	Some_Person	write to canonical
