2005-05-24T11:38:00.000Z	lotusleaf		I'm on a 56k modem and the speed is very slow, everything loads 700 - 900 bytes per second. I read on the Ubuntu forums that someone fixed this by installing and using Gnome-PPP, which I tried, but Gnome-PPP won't find my modem whereas the System->Networking program does, but works slowly. How do I get Gnome-PPP to find my modem?
2005-05-24T11:40:00.000Z	lotusleaf		anyone know?
2005-05-24T11:42:00.000Z	lotusleaf		I have an external hardware modem but my modem only goes 700 - 900 bytes per second in ubuntu
2005-05-24T11:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	did they say *why* switching to Gnome-PPP would fix things?
2005-05-24T11:44:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	no they just said it worked. The other option in another post was to "sudo gedit /etc/ppp/peers/ppp0" and add a speed # to the end of it, but that didn't work for me
2005-05-24T11:44:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	if I can get Gnome-PPP to actually see my modem, I can test it myself. ;)
2005-05-24T11:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	what did you set the 'speed' parameter to?
2005-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	thanks, I know about adding repos, but when I add multiverse to sources.list and apt-get update it doesn't show transcode in synaptic but transcode IS listed here: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/
2005-10-08T12:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	is transcode available for hoary?
2005-10-08T12:08:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	how can I tell?
2005-10-08T12:09:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	it's listed in http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/t/transcode but not in my synaptic with multiverse added
2005-10-08T12:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	check packages.ubuntu.com
2005-10-08T12:10:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	I don't think transcode is on packages.ubuntu.com but thanks I'll check, I received this info on ubuntuforums I believe a mod mentioned transcode and the url and said it was unsupported
2005-10-08T12:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	my impression is that archive.ubuntu.com has *all* packages, i.e., for warty, hoary and breezy. The relevant file(s) deciding what belongs to what are the Package.gz files
2005-10-08T12:12:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	thanks for the info - packages.ubuntu.com lists gtranscode which is a frontend, but not transcode. So why does packages.ubuntu.com offer gtranscode and not transcode since transcode is required to use transcode???? That's very odd.
2005-10-08T12:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	check here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=transcode&searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all
2005-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	hoary-backports doesn't have it and hoary-extras isn't on ubuntu.com is it?
2005-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	no
2005-10-08T12:14:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	ok thanks, I'd much rather stick to official Ubuntu repos
2005-10-08T12:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	lotusleaf	fair enough. breezy'll be officially available october 13; if you're patient, you can get transcode then
2005-10-08T12:14:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	thanks for your help, I appreciate it. :)
2005-10-08T12:15:00.000Z	lotusleaf	HappyFool	I guess there's always the compiling option. ;)
