2006-03-06T11:39:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	i read that 2 but.. whats the difference whit
2006-03-06T11:39:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	i read that 2 but.. whats the difference whit * or whit out it
2006-03-06T11:40:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	da*er will match daer, daper and dapper
2006-03-06T11:41:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	so you can say it represent a random string like in your case p and pp
2006-03-06T11:43:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	actually for regexes I misspoke.  it would be da.*er.  it's a multiplier for the preceding character.  da.*er would match those 3 things because it's a "zero or more" multiplier.  da.+er would only match daper or dapper because it's one or more.
2006-03-06T11:46:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	so p.*e (for example) would match? =S *reading*
2006-03-06T11:47:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	anything with an e after a p with 0 or more characters in between. like punxatawnee.
2006-03-06T11:48:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	think i finaly got it =) thanks for the help
2006-03-06T11:48:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	it would also match pe.  if you want to match p<something>e but not pe, use p.+e
2006-03-06T11:50:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	and edward0, thanks
2006-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	you mean symbolic links?
2006-03-06T12:01:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	yeh probably =)... ls -a lists all files.. i want the links only
2006-03-06T12:01:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	find . -type l
2006-03-06T12:02:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	find . -type l -maxdepth 1  if you don't want it recursive
2006-03-06T12:04:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	ls -F | grep '@$'
2006-03-06T12:04:00.000Z	Webx	trappist	thanks man
2006-03-06T12:04:00.000Z	trappist	Webx	we're not doing homeword for you, are we?
