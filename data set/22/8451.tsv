2006-01-05T17:00:00.000Z	Heimdall	twysted	i don't understand :/
2006-01-05T17:01:00.000Z	twysted	Heimdall	azureus should write any errors to a log file, check out the azureus FAQ page or their wiki
2006-01-05T17:01:00.000Z	twysted		irvine but where
2006-01-05T17:01:00.000Z	Heimdall	twysted	I already looked everything I could...
2006-01-05T17:02:00.000Z	twysted		heimdall hmmm i dunno try looking for a error log
2006-01-05T17:02:00.000Z	twysted		irvine what web site did u get the deb file from and was it for debian or ubuntu
2006-01-05T17:03:00.000Z	Heimdall	twysted	the problem is not tha azureus does not work, it is that I can't find the executable file
2006-01-05T17:03:00.000Z	Heimdall		I cant' launch it
2006-01-05T17:03:00.000Z	twysted		heimdall oh lol
2006-01-05T17:03:00.000Z	Heimdall		but it works, the first time after the install it launched well
2006-01-05T17:03:00.000Z	twysted		heimdall you try logging out of gnome and logging back in to see if gnome generates a shortcut for it in your menu?
2006-01-05T17:04:00.000Z	Heimdall		but then I cant find how to launch it, the script in /usr/local/bin/azureus wasn't correct
2006-01-05T17:05:00.000Z	Heimdall	twysted	no it didn't, there was just my old short cut I did myself long time ago, but "azureus" command (to /usr/bin azureus I suppose) does not work anymore
