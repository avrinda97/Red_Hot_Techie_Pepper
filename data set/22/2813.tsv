2009-02-24T12:59:00.000Z	Scuanor		hello :o) can you help me installing my x-years old eizo CRT-monitor in ubuntu v8.10? i want a bit more screenresolution than 640x480  :o(
2009-02-24T12:59:00.000Z	Scuanor		you = someone
2009-02-24T13:00:00.000Z	Scuanor		funnyly, after i installed my videodrivers for nvidia, the resolution droppped from 800 x 600. now im stuck with 640 x 480
2009-02-24T13:00:00.000Z	Scuanor		and i can tell you, thats BIG on a 21" CRT ;o9
2009-02-24T13:01:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	cant you set resolution via $nvidia-settings?
2009-02-24T13:01:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	hm, consider me newbieish to ubuntu and linux. i do not know, wehre i would find that file $nvidia-settings
2009-02-24T13:02:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	okies
2009-02-24T13:07:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	i can acess that program, but cant set a different CRT in the settings there. i DO know, that that CRT can handle 1280x1024. maybe if i edit that configfile directrly?
2009-02-24T13:08:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	try nvidia-xconfig and restart Xorg
2009-02-24T13:08:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	will do
2009-02-24T13:08:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	precede it with sudo
2009-02-24T13:09:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	if not you will have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf file manually
2009-02-24T13:10:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	i preceded it with sudo, making the command look as "sudo nvidia-xconfig" but ntohing happens, no feedback whatsoever
2009-02-24T13:11:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	yes. you must restart X. i believe it writes the settings it recognizes
2009-02-24T13:12:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	im not sure i understand, i must restart ubuntu before giving the sudo xconfig command?
2009-02-24T13:12:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	you must exit the windowed mode and start it anew before it takes effect
2009-02-24T13:12:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	okay.
2009-02-24T13:13:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	no need to restart...
2009-02-24T13:13:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	sorry, i meant not del but backspace
2009-02-24T13:13:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	examine your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-02-24T13:14:00.000Z	credo	Scuanor	yes but i believe ubuntu has graphic login manager running still... not sure if you must exit that TOO or not
2009-02-24T13:16:00.000Z	Scuanor	credo	okay, i just restart the pc ( its not this one )
