2012-02-18T22:38:00.000Z	no_gravity		Hello from Germany! When I start my machine, I get asked to unlock "the Keyring" so my machine can access my wpa router. ok. Then when I start a root-terminal, I get asked to unlock "the keyring 'default'". What is the difference between theses keyrings? Can I make it so I only get asked once?
2012-02-18T22:39:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	Do you use the same password for login as for the keyrings?
2012-02-18T22:39:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	yes
2012-02-18T22:42:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	If you start the program seahorse, do you see only 1 keyring?
2012-02-18T22:42:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	should i start it as root or as the user gnome runs as?
2012-02-18T22:43:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	never as root
2012-02-18T22:43:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	It WILL mess up your configuration when started as root.
2012-02-18T22:44:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	i dont see "keyrings" in that program. I see "Passwords: login" and "Passwords: default"
2012-02-18T22:44:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	those are the keyrings
2012-02-18T22:45:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	so, could i combine them?
2012-02-18T22:45:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	You should set the "login" one as Default and see what saved secrets you need from the "Default" one.
2012-02-18T22:46:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	what do you mean with "see what saved secrets you need from the 'default' one"?
2012-02-18T22:47:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	Click the little arrow besides the "Passwords: Default", there will be a list of saved secrets.
2012-02-18T22:47:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	yes, i see them
2012-02-18T22:48:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	its only one. "local password for user root"
2012-02-18T22:48:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	now what?
2012-02-18T22:49:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	There is no user root on default ubuntu (Well, there is, but the account isn't used) so you can remove that keyring altogether.
2012-02-18T22:50:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	then i have to type the password everytime i start a root terminal. i have put this entry in my main-menu: gksu /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator. thats what i use.
2012-02-18T22:51:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	What ubuntu release are you on?
2012-02-18T22:52:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	ups, im in my debian partition right now.
2012-02-18T22:53:00.000Z	Ampelbein	no_gravity	Wait, you share your /home between ubuntu and debian?
2012-02-18T22:54:00.000Z	no_gravity	Ampelbein	no
