2007-05-10T11:56:00.000Z	foo		Anyone have a rough idea of how long an e2fsck -fyv may take on an 800GB partition? Hmm.
2007-05-10T11:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	haha
2007-05-10T11:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	oof
2007-05-10T11:58:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	seriously, depending on how much stuff, and what kind of disk it is (RAID?)
2007-05-10T11:58:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	hours
2007-05-10T11:59:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	what stage is it on?
2007-05-10T12:00:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	it's not re-building the RAID5 is it?
2007-05-10T12:00:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	Not sure. It's remote
2007-05-10T12:00:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	hm, don't think so.
2007-05-10T12:00:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	cat /proc/mdstat
2007-05-10T12:00:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	oh.. you don't have a console on it?
2007-05-10T12:01:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	6 hours seems a bit long, but ext3 fsck is dependant on how much stuff is on the FS
2007-05-10T12:01:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	I do, I'd just need to call my buddy
2007-05-10T12:01:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	600GB out of 800GB was used
2007-05-10T12:02:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	I would verify that it's not trying to fsck and rebuild at the same time
2007-05-10T12:02:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	Hm, before we did that... the RAID array was fine. It's hardware RAID, fwyi
2007-05-10T12:03:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	this is why I use XFS on big filesystems :)
2007-05-10T12:11:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	hmm, interesting, ok
2007-05-10T12:12:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	yes
2007-05-10T12:14:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	thanks
2007-05-10T12:15:00.000Z	SuperQ	foo	?
2007-05-10T12:16:00.000Z	foo	SuperQ	for he tip
