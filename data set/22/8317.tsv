2005-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	bob2		that's a very bad idea
2005-09-24T11:12:00.000Z	HiddenFly	bob2	yea thats what i thought, anyways i could still install cedega? it doesnt let me continue after that message
2005-09-24T11:13:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	that's ridiculous
2005-09-24T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	mv
2005-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	how are they different things?
2005-09-28T13:53:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	why bother? just put a new filesystem on it
2005-09-28T13:53:00.000Z	HiddenFly	bob2	ok, how?
2005-09-28T13:54:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/whatever
2005-09-28T13:54:00.000Z	HiddenFly	bob2	ok thanks
2005-09-28T13:54:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	that will destroy the contents of /dev/whatever ireperably, tho
2005-09-28T13:55:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	I mean, be very very careful where you point that loaded gun ;)
2005-09-28T14:03:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	5% is reserved for root
2005-09-28T14:10:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	so that if the disk is nominally full, you still have space to compress things or whatever to save space
2005-10-11T12:10:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	#cedega
2005-10-18T11:35:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	/topic
2005-10-18T11:35:00.000Z	HiddenFly	bob2	yea i noticed, but found only images there
2005-10-18T11:35:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	the 3rd link explains how to update
2005-11-02T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	delete the dir you installed it to
2005-11-02T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	if it was /usr/, you lose, don't do it again
2005-11-02T13:38:00.000Z	HiddenFly	bob2	ok
2005-11-02T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	HiddenFly	(make uninstall might work if you still have the source tree around)
2005-11-02T13:38:00.000Z	HiddenFly	bob2	it propably went to /usr/ :/
