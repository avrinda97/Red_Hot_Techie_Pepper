2007-10-01T05:05:00.000Z	jxxxt		Tried to install feisty but my c/d went into loop at the partitioner. any ideas what might be the cause??
2007-10-01T05:05:00.000Z	jxxxt		 I reburnt the image at a slower speed but no difference
2007-10-01T05:05:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	you could try partitioning with cfdisk to see what is the culprit.
2007-10-01T05:07:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	Then it looped on user/name/password
2007-10-01T05:07:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	where does cfdisk ask for username/pasword?
2007-10-01T05:08:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	I was using live install disc
2007-10-01T05:09:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	I couldn't quite get where you failed when you tried "cfdisk" as  a partitioner.
2007-10-01T05:11:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	I did not use cfdisc the partitioner is the default one one the live c/d
2007-10-01T05:11:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	ok I suggest you try cfdisk to see what the error it gives is
2007-10-01T05:13:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	I can do that in a terminal now right??
2007-10-01T05:13:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	yes. run "cfdisk /dev/sda" or whatever your disk is
2007-10-01T05:13:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	OK
2007-10-01T05:27:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	I just get a fatal error on hda and hda1
2007-10-01T05:28:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	what does "fdisk -l" say?
2007-10-01T05:28:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	use pastebin please for the output.
2007-10-01T05:31:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	No outcome from fdisk -l
2007-10-01T05:31:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	you should do it as root "sudo fdisk -l"
2007-10-01T05:32:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	Of course sorry!!
2007-10-01T05:38:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	I got there. I am going to keep this script and go to bed as I have been at this for too long today. Thanks for your help thus far.
2007-10-01T05:38:00.000Z	JimQode	jxxxt	np. nighty night!
2007-10-01T05:39:00.000Z	jxxxt	JimQode	G night
