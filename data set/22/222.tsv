2012-04-01T13:49:00.000Z	atomicity		hi everyone
2012-04-01T13:51:00.000Z	atomicity		I'm having a big problem installing ubuntu on an older laptop. I'm currently booted on an alternative install iso dd'd on a usb disk (actual disk, not flash). So, I boot, and then the 'detect and mount cdrom' step fails. What do I do?
2012-04-01T13:51:00.000Z	atomicity		(I should mention I'm at home with the terminal, so complex instructions are ok)
2012-04-01T13:53:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	what are the specs for laptop! may want xubuntu
2012-04-01T13:53:00.000Z	atomicity	JelloPop	1.6GHz centrino, 2G ram, 80GB disk.
2012-04-01T13:54:00.000Z	atomicity	JelloPop	and also, I'd just be happy with getting the commandline install currently, I plan on trying different window managers and seeing what works best.
2012-04-01T13:54:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	what version of ubuntu are u trying to install?
2012-04-01T13:55:00.000Z	atomicity	JelloPop	the is is 11.10-alternate-i386
2012-04-01T13:57:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	I would go with xubuntu and just install the gnome desktop :) I'm not to happy with the idea of 11.10 but thats ur choice . md5 check..
2012-04-01T13:57:00.000Z	atomicity	JelloPop	what's wrong with 11.10
2012-04-01T13:59:00.000Z	atomicity		also, I can mount the usb by hand no problem from the shell the system boots into
2012-04-01T13:59:00.000Z	atomicity		I think it's just the installer that expects me to be booting from /dev/sr0 and not from /dev/sdb
2012-04-01T13:59:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	meant ubuntu 10.04 lts next will be 12.04 lts
2012-04-01T14:00:00.000Z	atomicity		I'm sorry, I'm not a regular ubuntu user. I use archlinux :). It's just that for this laptop I wanted something supposedly hassle-free since it's not going to be a development machine.
2012-04-01T14:01:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	Good Luck.. ")
2012-04-01T14:01:00.000Z	atomicity		So I don't really know anything about problematic versions etc.
2012-04-01T14:01:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	I use Linux Mint.. for hasslefree
2012-04-01T14:01:00.000Z	atomicity	JelloPop	hm...
2012-04-01T14:02:00.000Z	atomicity	JelloPop	did it get any better than it was 2 years ago? because back then I tried it and hated it.
2012-04-01T14:02:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	But, I dont consider either Ubuntu or Linux Mint are a bad choice
2012-04-01T14:04:00.000Z	JelloPop	atomicity	Oh, yes Linux Mint is lot more funcutional, but it supports gnome3 + mate... It is more like the old gnome 2 since LInux Mint annouced it would be working on the Nutmeg for Gnome 4 users have doubled over Ubuntu
2012-04-01T14:04:00.000Z	atomicity	JelloPop	first thing I'm doing is installing kde anyway :)
