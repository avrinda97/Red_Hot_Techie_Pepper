2009-08-04T18:31:00.000Z	JPZ		Hello everyone, I need help with an issue regarding nautilus. I did 2 file transfers to a network drive ( of about 2GB each) yesterday. Today I notice that the file transfer window is locked, blank, and nautilus is using lots of CPU recources. I've rebooted and still no changes n cpu consumption. Any ideas? Running ubuntu 8.10
2009-08-04T18:32:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	what do you mean by "lots of CPU resources"?
2009-08-04T18:32:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	sry, meant to write its using 100% of cpu
2009-08-04T18:33:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	you've verified this in top? could you pastebin some top output?
2009-08-04T18:33:00.000Z	JPZ		sure, one sec

2009-08-04T18:34:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	could you show the top lines as well? also, did the file transfer you mentioned complete?

2009-08-04T18:37:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	i assume "garbage" is a known user :-)
2009-08-04T18:37:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	yes
2009-08-04T18:38:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	its been like this ever since I did that big file transfer to a WIN network share
2009-08-04T18:39:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	if you kill and restart nautilus, does it run normally? also, you might try turning off snort temporarily to help isolate the problem.
2009-08-04T18:39:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	no, it goes to 40% then kicks to 100% after a few mins. the same with a reboot.
2009-08-04T18:40:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	does turning off snort help?
2009-08-04T18:40:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	on it, one sec
2009-08-04T18:42:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	done, I stopped snort and then killed nautilus. seems like its fixed. the large file transfer must have been a coincidence then O.o
2009-08-04T18:43:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	the file transfer windows were frozen, so I assumed wrong.
2009-08-04T18:43:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	yeah, maybe. if you restart snort, does the behaviour resume?
2009-08-04T18:43:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	I'm trying that right now, lets see
2009-08-04T18:46:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	started, thus far seems to be all good. I'm lost as to what it could have been.
2009-08-04T18:47:00.000Z	sipior	JPZ	no telling with nautilus, i'm afraid :-) at least you have a solution of sorts, should the problem reappear.
2009-08-04T18:47:00.000Z	JPZ	sipior	thanks for the support, much apreciated. I'll keep an eye on it and try to check how the log sizes are doing.
