2007-08-16T10:09:00.000Z	anathematic		:) anyone know of some automatic backing up programs for ubuntu server
2007-08-16T10:10:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	what do you want to back up?
2007-08-16T10:10:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	 two things, mysql database and then just basic files
2007-08-16T10:11:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	if you want to back up off-site, rsync or unison are good, use mysqldump for the database.
2007-08-16T10:11:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	okay i'll go read up on those now =)
2007-08-16T10:12:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	look into using cron to automatic schedule your maintenance also
2007-08-16T10:13:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	don't mean to overload, but it is worth it.
2007-08-16T10:13:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	yeah of course backing up is important, doing a good job even more so :)
2007-08-16T10:13:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	he he
2007-08-16T10:14:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	yep, once / night to another computer at the same building, once / week backup off site ( to my home computer )
2007-08-16T10:16:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	so i use rsync to do the actual backup and then i use cron to set a script to backup the mysql database + use rsync right?
2007-08-16T10:28:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	yes , it does
2007-08-16T10:29:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	i've gone "sudo cron" and it's up "cron: can't lock /var/run/crond.pid, otherpid may be 4340: Resource temporarily unavailable" any ideas?
2007-08-16T10:29:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	there a gui program that allows you to edit your crontab ( the config file )
2007-08-16T10:29:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	 using the console and i guess i'd rather learn it :p
2007-08-16T10:29:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	cron is a daemon, a process that runs in the background.
2007-08-16T10:30:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	edit cron by the command sudo crontab-e
2007-08-16T10:30:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	are you familliar with vim ?
2007-08-16T10:30:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	na it's okay i am
2007-08-16T10:31:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	vi is the default editor for crontab
2007-08-16T10:31:00.000Z	anathematic	nephish	well it's a good thing i've used it before :)
2007-08-16T10:31:00.000Z	nephish	anathematic	oh, then good. takes a while to get familliar with vi/vim
