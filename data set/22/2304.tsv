2010-04-26T21:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	core X feature i do nor know of a way to disable it
2010-05-11T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	create a launcher ?
2010-05-11T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	and how it fails ?
2010-05-11T00:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	maybe you have to uncheck the "run in terminal" in launcher properties
2010-05-11T00:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	/etc/environment ?
2010-05-11T00:30:00.000Z	JenniferB	erUSUL	what do I type there.. export stuff and such ?
2010-05-11T00:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	just the vars and the values. SOMEVAR=somevalue
2010-05-11T00:31:00.000Z	JenniferB	erUSUL	do I need to restart after that?
2010-05-11T00:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	maybe just a log out log in cycle is enough
2010-05-11T00:50:00.000Z	JenniferB	erUSUL	I changed the environment, logged out ( restarted even ) ... and when I try to log in, after entering the password the screen goes black for 2 seconds... and then I get back to the login screen !! :( ... how can I change back the /etc/environment file ?
2010-07-27T19:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	chmod -R +rw folder/
2010-07-27T19:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	no rw is enough
2010-07-27T19:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	where does the git repo come to have such messed permissions ?
2010-07-27T19:17:00.000Z	JenniferB	erUSUL	It's on our company server... I created a new repo.. and I am getting a fatal thing.. and cannot commit to it... I alos created it with sudo ... because I didn't have the permissions to create it
2010-07-27T19:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	so maybe the problem is the ownership not the modes ? maybe it belonged to root...
2010-07-27T19:19:00.000Z	JenniferB	erUSUL	yes.. but I can't seem to be able to create a new repo without the sudo
2010-07-27T19:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	JenniferB	by "create a new repo" you mean « git init » ?
