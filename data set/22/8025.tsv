2005-11-25T15:07:00.000Z	NCLife		if i have kubuntu and want to install ubuntu-desktop, does it includes all the main progamms as if it is a complete install? with gaim, etc..
2005-11-25T15:07:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	yes
2005-11-25T15:07:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	not at startup, but at the X login screen
2005-11-25T15:08:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	and there's nothing really to "switch", as you'll have programs from both environments listed in your menu, and you'll be able to load Gnome and KDE programs from either
2005-11-25T15:08:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	you'll just decide whether to load Gnome or KDE
2005-11-25T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	since, in case you ever want to remove it, you'll be able to, without hunting down every single package
2005-11-25T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	yes, actually, it will ask one or two questions to you
2005-11-25T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	for instance, whether to load GDM or KDM as your login manager
2005-11-25T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	it is
2005-11-25T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	the only really "difficult" thing with having both installed is that you won't clearly distinguish which apps are Gnome and which apps are KDE from the menu
2005-11-25T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	no, you don't, as ubuntu-desktop only requires packages from main
2005-11-25T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	even though enabling universe is probably a good idea anyway
2005-11-25T15:13:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	edit /etc/apt/sources.list directly
2005-11-25T15:15:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	i'm not sure what you mean, but what you have to do is, basically, add one or more lines to the /etc/apt/sources.list file
2005-11-25T15:15:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	for example, my line for Universe is "deb http://it.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy universe"
2005-11-25T15:15:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	that's from an Italian mirror though, it might not be very fast for you
2005-11-25T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	but simply adding "universe" to the list of things ("breezy main restricted", probably) in the main line of your sources.list should work
2005-11-25T15:18:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	it's in /etc/apt
2005-11-25T15:18:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	do "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
2005-11-25T15:18:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	no, actually, you don't have gedit i suppose since you don't have gnome, so make it "sudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list"
2005-11-25T15:19:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	make you edit the file of course
2005-11-25T15:19:00.000Z	LjL	NCLife	or "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list", for a textmode editor
