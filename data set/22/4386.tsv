2011-12-28T21:45:00.000Z	zgr		hello i'm using 11.10, can someone tell me how is possible to disable guest login? adding "allow-guest=false" to lightdm.conf makes no sense
2011-12-28T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zgr	why does it make no sense?
2012-01-15T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zgr	I do but I just tell evince to run when I download a PDF
2012-01-31T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zgr	the OS should still boot
2012-01-31T22:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zgr	if you hold shift and select recovery mode, does it hang there, or can you select root?
2012-01-31T22:46:00.000Z	zgr	ActionParsnip	hangs on  skipping prof in /etc/apparmor/disable:/usr/bin/firefox
2012-01-31T22:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zgr	but can you select root?
2012-01-31T22:48:00.000Z	zgr	ActionParsnip	no it hangs on load

2012-01-31T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zgr	all I can suggest personally is use liveCD and chroot, others may have a suggestion but not being able to get root recovery mode isn't a good sign
2012-01-31T22:53:00.000Z	zgr	ActionParsnip	ok thanks
