2011-05-21T20:31:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		I like wobbly windows
2011-05-21T20:32:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		some people do not ;)
2011-05-21T20:33:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		That should be enough to run compiz
2011-05-21T20:33:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		driver issue, most liekly then, nclx
2011-05-21T20:33:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		What about if you run with nouvous?
2011-05-21T20:34:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		I cannot spell Nouvous correct - I'm not French ;)
2011-05-21T20:34:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		Thanks, rww
2011-05-21T20:35:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		I have a Q, too, people
2011-05-21T20:35:00.000Z	BorgTK2001		Q: With compiz running [Lucid 10.04LTS], on my Lenovo 3000 C100, the window boarders randomly vanish. Where are the logs so I can see the crash reports in action for these errors?
2011-05-21T20:36:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	what graphics card do you have
2011-05-21T20:36:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	escott	he has those drivers already, and unity is not working for him
2011-05-21T20:37:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	ok. for your wobbly windows have you tried http://iloveubuntu.net/desktop-cube-has-just-been-resurrected-natty-narwhal-doesnt-break-unity-anymore
2011-05-21T20:38:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	is compiz completely crashing? or just the borders disappear?
2011-05-21T20:40:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	i've heard of compiz not drawing the decorations but still running. more likely is compiz just crashing. you could start compiz with compiz --replace from a terminal and then monitor the output. if it crashes it should say why
2011-05-21T20:42:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	you could tweak your session with gnome-session-properties to dump the stderr to somwhere you can find it
2011-05-21T20:46:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	escott	When I do that command in a terminal - my panels are gone, but the windows are wobbly
2011-05-21T20:48:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	your gnome-panel at the top disappeared? at the least compiz is working (you wouldn't have wobbly windows without it), not sure why the panel disappeared
2011-05-21T20:51:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	the point is that glxinfo says his glx source is dri nvidia, even mesa can run glxgears smoothly these days
2011-05-21T20:55:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	faster than screen refresh
2011-05-21T20:57:00.000Z	escott	BorgTK2001	i'm not sure i can. thats why i advise looking at glxinfo
2011-05-29T01:04:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	escott	I think you have to hold shift to enable that menu on 10.04LTS and above
