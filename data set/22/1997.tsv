2010-01-07T02:16:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	a long but very informative article http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7568/1.html
2010-01-07T02:17:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	please stay polite
2010-01-07T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	changing your password will *never* ruin your computer - so what is the issue?
2010-01-07T02:23:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- I changed my password and upon restarting my Ubuntu thinks my login password is one thing and my encrypted home folder will not decrypt - Changing my password back to original via the same sudo passwd shwakc command did not work.  I am trying to follow the directions on the same link you gave me on the last page - the data recovery
2010-01-07T02:24:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- I have my wrapped-passphrase file that is encrypted with my old or new user password - I try decrypting this file using ecryptfs with both passwords and it fails everyt ime
2010-01-07T02:24:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	on thta page you will aslo see that "in the end" you need the "random grenerated passphrase" which you certainly recorded somewhere secure
2010-01-07T02:24:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- the random generated passphrase can be found by decrypting the wrapped passphrase file, as noted on the last page of the link you sent me
2010-01-07T02:24:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- this is how you find out your random passphrase if you failed to record it down but still know the login password
2010-01-07T02:25:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- however, this has not worked
2010-01-07T02:25:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	yes, but you *should* have done as soon as you created your system
2010-01-07T02:26:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- I set up linux using advanced partition editor so I could make my own partition for /home, I do not remember ever being asked if i wanted to encrypt my home folder...and thus i never wrote down any passphrase.  It looks like decrypting the wrapped passphrase file is my only hope
2010-01-07T02:27:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- I boot from live CD, mount the partition containing  /home,   fine my wrapped-passphrase file,    I run the correct command to decrypt it with ecryptfs, and I try using both the old and new password and it will not decrypt.  I am desperate to recover my files...i would die without them
2010-01-07T02:27:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	I guess you must have missed something there - I clearly remember that question when I set up a LVM / encrypted system
2010-01-07T02:28:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- it may very well be that i just missed it as I am new to linux (first time user)  however, if discovery of the passphrsae is possible ith my login password and wrapped-passphrase file,    it is my only hope for getting my fiels back and I really need it to work.
2010-01-07T02:28:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	I'm sorry - didn't want to "rub it in" - I wish you the best possible luck with your data - bedtime here
2010-01-07T02:28:00.000Z	Shwack	guntbert	- thank you for your help, have a good night
2010-01-07T02:29:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	same to you - and Good luck :-)
2010-01-07T20:09:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	are you still around? did you get access to your data?
2010-01-08T00:33:00.000Z	guntbert	Shwack	are you still around? did you get your problem sorted?
