2012-08-25T03:26:00.000Z	meio		how to edit kernel modules assgined to an ethernet controller?
2012-08-25T03:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 edit in what way?
2012-08-25T03:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 rephrase what you mean....
2012-08-25T03:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 blacklist the one you dont want to use. and load the other module
2012-08-25T03:29:00.000Z	meio	Dr_Willis	because I have already blacklisted r8169 and it is still showing
2012-08-25T03:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 rmmod it...
2012-08-25T03:29:00.000Z	meio	Dr_Willis	I already did that
2012-08-25T03:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 well.. no other user could do it. :) so you would have to be root/use sudo.
2012-08-25T03:33:00.000Z	meio	Dr_Willis	I already reinstalled 11.10 3 times already
2012-08-25T03:34:00.000Z	meio	Dr_Willis	http://unixblogger.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/the-pain-of-an-realtek-rtl8111rtl8168-ethernet-card/
2012-08-25T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 what does that have to do with anything? ;) If a newer kenel may have proper drivers..id go with 12.04 or even test out 12.10
2012-08-25T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 why do you expect reinstalling the os to fix anything?   You could try a 12.10 live cd..
2012-08-25T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 not our fault that the HW maker cant supply drivers for their own hardware...  then again.. ive rarely seen a wired NIC that dident work..
2012-08-25T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 not really...  the kernel versions are VERY differnt.
2012-08-25T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 so your logic is flawed.
2012-08-25T03:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 how are you even installing the drivers from teh realtek site?
2012-08-25T03:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 so you 'compiled' them..
2012-08-25T04:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 look at dmesg output for any errors?
2012-08-25T04:01:00.000Z	meio	Dr_Willis	I'm looking
2012-08-25T04:05:00.000Z	meio	Dr_Willis	realtek rtl8169 is not even loaded which is what is supposed to happen since it is blacklisted
2012-08-25T15:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 most patches would be for specific versions of kernel sources.
2012-08-25T15:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meio	 ubuntu and other disrtos may have their own patched kernel source trees also.
