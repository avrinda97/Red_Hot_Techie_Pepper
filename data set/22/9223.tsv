2005-03-17T12:14:00.000Z	cwillu		powernow:  This is indicative of a broken BIOS.
2005-03-17T12:15:00.000Z	cwillu		so I've been told
2005-03-17T12:15:00.000Z	cwillu		does this sound like broken bios behaviour?
2005-03-17T12:16:00.000Z	cwillu		does sudo swallow output?
2005-03-17T12:18:00.000Z	cwillu		doh
2005-03-17T12:18:00.000Z	cwillu		i.e., if I do sudo synaptic I'm not going to see any output from synaptic
2005-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	cwillu		I'm trying to troubleshoot applications closing on their own
2005-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	cwillu		synaptic is only an example, but it has done it
2005-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	cwillu		Program (mozilla, nautilus, synaptic, etc) just closes
2005-03-17T12:21:00.000Z	cwillu		yes, although not for mozilla
2005-03-17T12:22:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	Is this recent? Does the same thing happen if you restart X?
2005-03-17T12:22:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	hoary or warty?
2005-03-17T12:23:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	me too. I'm running warty though.
2005-03-17T12:23:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	what's the load like?
2005-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	also check your disk space.
2005-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	lots free?
2005-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	I'd check your RAM next
2005-03-17T12:25:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	possibly bad RAM - just throwing out ideas
2005-03-17T12:29:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	that doesn't sound good...
2005-03-17T12:32:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	elephants?
2005-03-17T12:40:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	I think they're sending out hoary mid-april
2005-03-17T13:30:00.000Z	snowblink	cwillu	ssh -X remoteprogram is probably the fastest way
