2005-08-02T11:30:00.000Z	zerboxx		Umm, when in thunderbird I can click the scroll wheel, and a little circle pops up (this is similar to M$), why is it only with thunderbird though?
2005-08-02T11:31:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	cause that program has that feature?
2005-08-02T11:32:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	Though in M$ it appears to be a standard feature, I was wondering if it's possible to make it standard in ubuntu aswell, thats all
2005-08-02T11:32:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	Do you have thunderbird?
2005-08-02T11:32:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	nope.
2005-08-02T11:33:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	yup, should be :)
2005-08-02T11:36:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	what again, right click anywhere in the thuinderbird app or what?
2005-08-02T11:36:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	middle click (w the wheel)
2005-08-02T11:37:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	seems to only work in an email, not sure if it has a "welcome" email or not though
2005-08-02T11:37:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	If you'd like I could take a screenshot and put it up so you can see what i mean (if that would be easier)
2005-08-02T11:43:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	Currently can't take a screenshot, not sure why, but I'll figure it out :)
2005-08-02T11:46:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	got it.
2005-08-02T11:46:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	perfect!  So you see that thing which pops up?
2005-08-02T11:47:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	app specific, can not be set in a wm, is what I would expect.
2005-08-02T11:47:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	I figured it was app specific, though I was hoping it may not be :)
2005-08-02T11:47:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	Thanks for checking though!
2005-08-24T08:43:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	asked on #perl?
2005-08-24T08:43:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	Yup :)
2005-08-24T08:44:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	dont tell me those freaks dont knowit?
2005-08-24T08:44:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	I have no idea what they're saying :D
2005-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	dabaR	zerboxx	script it, or alias it.
2005-09-02T06:22:00.000Z	zerboxx	dabaR	There's nothing already out there? ;)
