2010-05-13T02:13:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	any error messages when you try that apt-get command?
2010-05-13T02:13:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	It says that it is not in the E file directory.
2010-05-13T02:15:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	Another thing is I don't know how to change my username on ubuntu 10.04 and when I use the sudo command it does not ask me for a password for sudo.
2010-05-13T02:17:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	Did you figure out why it won't download?
2010-05-13T02:18:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	those are some odd error messages.. can you pastebin them?
2010-05-13T02:20:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	well.. I don't recognize any of those errors and as far as I know a regular ubuntu install does ask for your password when you use sudo.. (unless you've used sudo in the last 5 minutes or so in the same terminal)
2010-05-13T02:21:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	Well I have Ubuntu 10.4 on a CD maybe that is the problem?
2010-05-13T02:21:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	ubuntu 10.04 is a regular ubuntu install... so it shouldn't be the problem
2010-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	When it booted it went straight to the desktop, it never asked me to create a profile.
2010-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	if it's the regular desktop install cd you should first get a menu where you can choose to install, try it, check the memory and so on
2010-05-13T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	I'm not sure what kind of profiles you are talking about
2010-05-13T02:23:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	I am talking about the root profile.
2010-05-13T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	ehm.. the root user?
2010-05-13T02:23:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	I will try again and if I have problems I will come back.
2010-05-13T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	calibre	do that
2010-05-13T02:24:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	Because on install i was not asked to create a profile.
2010-05-13T02:24:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	ok brb.
2010-05-13T02:42:00.000Z	calibre	Slart	So I guess when I hit try, its like a trial.
