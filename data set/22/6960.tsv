2006-09-12T14:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	levander	They are also very professional looking (jackets/cd's) to inspire friends to use them..
2006-09-12T14:10:00.000Z	levander	Jack_Sparrow	do they do a mass mailing right when a new release comes out?  so you don't have to wait that long when a new version comes out?
2008-03-04T04:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	levander	It is slow, but surprisingly good with the right video configuration
2008-03-04T04:54:00.000Z	levander	Jack_Sparrow	How do I go about getting the right video configuration?
2008-03-04T04:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	levander	I did it with trial and error until I got a res that worked.  Sorry I dont have an easy answer..
2008-03-04T04:55:00.000Z	levander	Jack_Sparrow	so, it's mostly desktop resolution on the machine you're rdesktop'ing into?
2008-03-04T04:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	levander	It was more on the machine and config or where I was.. not the remote
2008-03-04T05:28:00.000Z	levander	Jack_Sparrow	Have you ever gotten video to play from a Windows box over rdesktop?  I try it and just get a black box in Windows Media Player where the video would be.

2008-03-30T04:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	levander	32 bit is still recommended for new users,  dual booting 32 and64 is another good option.
2008-03-30T04:13:00.000Z	levander	Jack_Sparrow	Any idea why 32 bit is still recommended for new users?
2008-03-30T04:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	levander	flash and driver issues are the basics..
2008-03-30T04:15:00.000Z	levander	Jack_Sparrow	Well, I hope my wireless Linksys card works under 64 bits.  It works fine with ndiswrapper under 32 bits.
