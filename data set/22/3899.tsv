2008-05-01T17:01:00.000Z	Cointoss	bebe	with that command you make a backup of your graphics-server's configuration
2008-05-01T17:01:00.000Z	Cointoss	bebe	you can copy the backup back if installation fails so you don't need to install ubuntu again

2008-05-01T17:03:00.000Z	Cointoss	bebe	are you familiar with basic shell commands like changing directory and copying files?
2008-05-01T17:05:00.000Z	Cointoss	bebe	 if your startup fails you can switch to a console with <ctrl>+<alt>+F1...F6
2008-05-01T17:06:00.000Z	Cointoss	bebe	this is getting complicated are you willing to wirk on it?
