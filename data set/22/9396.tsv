2004-11-17T06:01:00.000Z	guestuser		hey, i have 2 questions
2004-11-17T06:01:00.000Z	guestuser		i have a background image but i dont want to manualy set it every session, is there a way to make it default
2004-11-17T06:01:00.000Z	guestuser		and 2: i tried to edit the fluxbox menu so that aterm would be abit transparant when i open it but that doesnt seem to work
2004-11-17T06:02:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	when you change the background, it remembers it
2004-11-17T06:05:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	what have you got in ~/.fluxbox?
2004-11-17T06:07:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	maybe you'll find the answer to your other problem somewhere in there too :)
2004-11-17T06:07:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	you don't like gnome huh?
2004-11-17T06:08:00.000Z	guestuser	Matt|	im just experimenting with things, i already have gnome configured to my likings conserning the background
2004-11-17T06:08:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	ok cool
2004-11-17T06:08:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	damn
2004-11-17T06:09:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	it is def. in there somewhere, might not have actual word "background"
2004-11-17T06:14:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	do you get an error?
2004-11-17T06:15:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	make sure you have the command fbsetbg?
2004-11-17T06:16:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	i seem to remember also that fsbetgb uses a difference command to draw the background. I had to install it separately. But i remember it giving me an error
2004-11-17T06:22:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	check the command exists
2004-11-17T06:24:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	try the command fbsetbg in a terminal to make sure it exists
2004-11-17T06:25:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	good idea
2004-11-17T06:28:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	glad it's working
2004-11-17T06:32:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	how do you get it to work manually?
2004-11-17T06:36:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	how are you opening aterm?
2004-11-17T06:37:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	you need to edit the menu
2004-11-17T06:40:00.000Z	Matt|	guestuser	paste the relevant part of ~/.fluxbox/menu
