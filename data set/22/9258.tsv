2005-02-14T13:49:00.000Z	randabis		okay
2005-02-14T13:49:00.000Z	randabis		to add stuff to the applications menu, type nautilus applications:/// in a terminal
2005-02-14T13:49:00.000Z	randabis		it will open your menu
2005-02-14T13:49:00.000Z	randabis		then you can right-click, and select Add Launcher
2005-02-14T13:50:00.000Z	randabis		you "should" be able to figure it out from there :)
2005-02-14T13:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	Not in hoary. :P
2005-02-14T13:50:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	that's why I asked him which version he was running
2005-02-17T12:21:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	cool idea...my sister could have used that when she still hadn't used her gift card :p
2005-02-17T12:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	Oh, you can't register with it. :/
2005-02-17T12:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	Basically with the GUI all you can do is search (still working on it) but with the CLI you can do basically everything but register.
2005-02-17T14:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	Gecko is not
2005-02-17T14:17:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	in what way?
2005-02-17T14:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	Because the standard isn't specific, it has to be interpreted. That means people interpret things differently.
2005-02-17T14:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	And that's before you find the actual bugs. :P
2005-02-17T14:18:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	that's better :)
2005-02-17T14:18:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	yeah, they are pretty good as well
2005-02-26T11:40:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	that's true..you'd need a 512MB card at minimum
2005-04-11T12:01:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	incorrect
2005-04-11T12:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	ask -devel
2005-04-11T12:02:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	breezy will be the next stable release
2005-04-11T14:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	randabis	0.5 tomorrow, hopefully :)
2005-04-11T14:51:00.000Z	randabis	Amaranth	good job btw. I don't have a use for it, but it would be helpful if I was using gnome. :)
