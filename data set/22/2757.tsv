2009-03-26T23:09:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	locally or remotely?
2009-03-26T23:11:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	I want to edit the file locally
2009-03-26T23:12:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	For example, I'd like to open up an apache config file for editing on my local machine
2009-03-26T23:12:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	then it's remotely that you need root access
2009-03-26T23:13:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	it's nasty, you will need to enable root login, afaik
2009-03-26T23:13:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	I know, but since it's an ubuntu server, I can't log in as root
2009-03-26T23:13:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	Damn, there has got to be a better way >.<
2009-03-26T23:14:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	you just need to set a root password
2009-03-26T23:14:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	I could do that, but the majority of my work I need to be logged in as the user...I'll keep looking
2009-03-26T23:17:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	why doesn't that solve it for you?
2009-03-26T23:20:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	Well, I'm a newb, but from what I know, enabling root is against Ubuntu's best practices.
2009-03-26T23:21:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	ubuntu is also free software, so you do whatever you like
2009-03-26T23:21:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	In addition, it would require me to have to separate mounted drive, which doesn't flow well
2009-03-26T23:21:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	if you need it, you need it. do you really need it? :)
2009-03-26T23:22:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	iiuic, you need to edit remote config files, right? why not just edit them via ssh to your ordinary account with sudo via command line?
2009-03-26T23:24:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	Yeah, that's what I'm going to do, but I would prefer a way to be able to keep everything in one editor
2009-03-26T23:25:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	oh, now I get it. sorry, out of ideas
2009-03-26T23:25:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	It helps me streamline. I'm just switching my main workspace from Windows, so I'm trying to see all the stuff I wanted to do but couldn't on windows ;)
2009-03-26T23:25:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	It's fine, thanks for you help and interest
2009-03-26T23:26:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	you could have several tabs in one terminal window. it's similar to several tabs in one gedit, for example
2009-03-26T23:26:00.000Z	philsf	dylanmcd	I do that
2009-03-26T23:27:00.000Z	dylanmcd	philsf	Yeah, that's a good idea
