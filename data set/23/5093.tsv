2007-03-10T17:52:00.000Z	profx		whats a good choice to install linux on, for file systems ?
2007-03-10T17:52:00.000Z	profx		ext2?
2007-03-10T06:28:00.000Z	profx		so there are two screens leading me into ubuntu, the first, has a progress bar, it reaches the end, then freezes, anything I can do to troubleshoot it, besides installing another OS?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		why is ubuntu this hard to install?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		is it because I have a Nvidia card?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		really?
2007-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	profx		prove it?
2007-03-10T06:31:00.000Z	profx		your all geniuses
2007-03-10T06:31:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	it's more difficult on some hardware.
2007-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	take a digital photo of the boot sequence with recovery mode
2007-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	profx	crimsun	what the h are you talking about?
2007-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	if you say that booting doesn't work, then I want a picture of where it fails.
2007-03-10T06:37:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	so boot in recovery mode (choose it in the boot menu), and take a photograph of it. Your describing doesn't help. We need the actual text.
2007-03-10T06:37:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	of course there's text IN THE MENU ENTRY I told you.
2007-03-10T06:38:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	obviously if you boot into the 'normal' entry, you'll get the graphical usplash that hides text. That's why I told you to use the recovery mode that does not use that graphical usplash.
2007-03-10T06:39:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	yes, that's intentional.
2007-03-10T06:40:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	which prompt? Describe it, or take a digital photo and post it (even better)
2007-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	quite probably. Which Nvidia card is it?
2007-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	profx	crimsun	root@host:/# command prompt
2007-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	right, so which Nvidia card is it (as I just asked)?
2007-03-10T06:49:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	so you need to follow the fglrx instructions, then
2007-03-10T06:50:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2007-03-10T06:50:00.000Z	crimsun	profx	under the ATI section, there's a walk-through
