2006-05-26T05:07:00.000Z	maike-maus2		hello. at reboot after installation of breezy the system stops ap "starting hotplug subsystem". Does anybody know how to solve the problem? I use a notebook, packard bell w3420
2006-05-26T05:08:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	listen to linux_galore, and also try boot options: noapic and nolapic
2006-05-26T05:09:00.000Z	maike-maus2	soundray	do I have to write this in a "special way" ?
2006-05-26T05:11:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	during boot, select "edit" on the first entry of the grub boot menu. Go to the kernel line and append 'noapic' (just the word, not the quotes) and boot. If that doesn't help, try 'nolapic'
2006-05-26T05:12:00.000Z	maike-maus2	soundray	and linux_galore: thanks, I'll try it
2006-05-26T05:28:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	don't know if it helps, but have you seen https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/PackardBellR3280 ?
2006-05-26T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	here's another one that may be useful: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BootOptions
2006-05-26T05:32:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	can you boot in recovery mode?
2006-05-26T05:37:00.000Z	maike-maus2	soundray	I just tried to boot recovery mode but since 2 inutes there are following lines with azx_get_response timeout... Is ts usual? Or can I abort this?
2006-05-26T05:38:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	that's going to be the same thing that happens in normal mode...
2006-05-26T05:39:00.000Z	maike-maus2	soundray	oh, then I would say recovery mode doesnt work...
2006-05-26T05:42:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	you should try blacklisting  snd-hda-intel -- do you know how?
2006-05-26T05:45:00.000Z	maike-maus2	soundray	and linux_galore: I blacklisted snd-hda-intel and snd_hda_codec with the wiki documentation and now the hotplug problem is solved
2006-05-26T05:45:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	well done. Have you got a new problem now?
2006-05-26T05:45:00.000Z	maike-maus2	soundray	do you think that I don't need to blacklist the snd_hda_codec ??
2006-05-26T05:47:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	I think it's the other one that causes the trouble, but I reckon they both need each other to be of any use.
2006-05-26T05:47:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	so you might as well blacklist both
2006-05-26T05:49:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	immer gern
2006-05-26T05:49:00.000Z	maike-maus2	soundray	immer gern? sag bloss du kannst deutsch? ;-)
2006-05-26T05:50:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	yes, but not here... pm me?
2006-05-26T05:51:00.000Z	soundray	maike-maus2	#ubuntu-de?
