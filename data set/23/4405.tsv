2008-01-25T03:00:00.000Z	josiah		If I want to rename my external hard drive to I just: mv ext\ drive extdrive
2008-01-25T03:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 I dont think so.
2008-01-25T03:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 you are refering to where the HD is mounted to it sounds like.
2008-01-25T03:01:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	I am in the /media dir
2008-01-25T03:01:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	in there is my hard drive called: My Book
2008-01-25T03:01:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	I dont like the space in the name so I want to rename it to MyBook
2008-01-25T03:02:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	so usually when I rename a dir i just do: mv dirname dirname2
2008-01-25T03:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 you could just make a soft link from 'MyBook' to 'My Book' which sould be easier.
2008-01-25T03:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 sudo ln -s 'one thing' 'other thing'
2008-01-25T03:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 sudo ln -s 'Original Name' 'New Name' is more clear :)
2008-01-25T03:05:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	yes that worked just fine... but my windows machine is still not seeing it for some reason... i thought it might have been because of the space in the share name... im going nuts trying to get samba to work or for my windows machine to read it at least
2008-01-25T03:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 if this is a exteranal usb hard drive with ntfs/vfat onit. You Might want to change the disk label under windows to MyBook
2008-01-25T03:08:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	I just did... still no luck. It was working before... then I unplugged the external drive and plugged it back in... now windows isnt seeing my machine
2008-01-25T03:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 You may want to mount the thing manually, and create a share specifically for that hard drive.
2008-01-25T03:09:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	I tried that... and I just tried sharing a dir in my /home dir and windows still isnt seeing it... the workgroups are set up correctly I dont understand
2008-01-25T03:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 work on one thing at a time i guess. so homes was being shared and now its not?
2008-01-25T03:10:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	yes everything worked yesturday
2008-01-25T03:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 see if the linux box can see/acces its own shares for a start I guess.
2008-01-25T03:14:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	when I goto Places -> network it shows my windows machine right away and its not listed in "Windows Network"... isnt that odd?
2008-01-25T03:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 i normlally use the 'fuse samba' tools these days.
2008-01-25T03:15:00.000Z	josiah	Dr_willis	what is that?
2008-01-25T03:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	josiah	 makes your samba network show up under a normal 'directory' Not needing to use the file manager to browse smb:// stuff
