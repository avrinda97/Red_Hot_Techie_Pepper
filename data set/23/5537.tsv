2010-03-16T23:37:00.000Z	lars__	Jordan_U	I just pulled it up, and the only driver that is active is my broadcom sta wireless driver...im sure thats not the adapeter but only the bluetooth...but im not sure..basically i got the wireless network kernal and it has pulled up the hardware and sees it as present...but i just cant activate it...haha sorry 4 my n00bishness lol
2010-03-16T23:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lars__	If that driver is active your wireless should be working. Can you pastebin the output of "iwconfig scan"?
2010-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lars__	Sorry, just "iwconfig"

2010-03-16T23:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lars__	Yes, in the terminal.
2010-03-16T23:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lars__	Do *not* paste the output to the channel though.

2010-03-16T23:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lars__	"sudo modprobe b43" and "iwlist scan" again.
2010-03-16T23:52:00.000Z	lars__	Jordan_U	"sudo" first then "iwist"
2010-03-16T23:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lars__	You can ignore that warning.

2010-03-17T00:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lars__	Not really sure what to try from here, rebooting may help but it's not likely.
