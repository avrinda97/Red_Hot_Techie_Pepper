2012-04-29T21:57:00.000Z	flyingbuddha		How can I fix this?
2012-04-29T21:57:00.000Z	flyingbuddha		How do you boot into the BIOS menu, I've tried F1, F2 and F10
2012-04-29T21:58:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	depends on your computer, might be del, or esc too
2012-04-29T21:58:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	It's a VPS / Virtual Machine
2012-04-29T21:58:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	I'll try some of your combos too :p
2012-04-29T21:59:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	in which case there is no bios, it is done in the settings of the VM. Virtualbox or vmware or other?
2012-04-29T22:00:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	Oh no :( I've no idea how to enable my ethernet card, all the instructions on the net say to boot into the BIOS
2012-04-29T22:01:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	What is ioemu / netfront? (Network Emulator)
2012-04-29T22:04:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	so are you looking at this VPS through some kind of serial console? what VPS service is it?
2012-04-29T22:04:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	I have a server with ThrustVps, I'm administrating the machine through vnc
2012-04-29T22:08:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	I would suggest asking thrustVPS support, I think they are really good
2012-04-29T22:08:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	Ok
2012-04-29T22:09:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	they might be able to change the emulation mode of the network hardware (it isn't a real network card so they can maybe change what it pretends to be)
2012-04-29T22:09:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	anyhow, I think they would be interested in getting to the bottom of a problem with 12.04 on their setup
2012-04-29T22:10:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	I can choose a different Network Card and a different Network Emulator in my control panel, would either of these be any use?
2012-04-29T22:10:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	yes, try them out
2012-04-29T22:11:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	What is a 'Network Emulator'? Options are: ioemu and netfront
2012-04-29T22:11:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	no idea, but there are not that many combinations to try :)
2012-04-29T22:21:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	yay \o/
2012-04-29T22:22:00.000Z	AlanBell	flyingbuddha	I would suggest you email trustVPS support and let them know
2012-04-29T22:22:00.000Z	flyingbuddha	AlanBell	OK dude.
