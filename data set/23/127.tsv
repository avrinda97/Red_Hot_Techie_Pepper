2012-06-13T07:52:00.000Z	JW1		For instance, I open up my home folder, and I have a file with an extension of .log, and I right-click on the file and I get "Open With" and several options, but none of those options work for me
2012-06-13T07:52:00.000Z	JW1		I choose "Open With Other Application" but the application that I want to use doesn't appear there either
2012-06-13T07:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	file extensions in Linux don't mean much
2012-06-13T07:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	what app do you want to use?
2012-06-13T07:55:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	the program is wxmacmolplt, it does not come with the standard Ubuntu distribution nor is it on the Ubuntu servers
2012-06-13T07:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	bit of a hack but you could add: TextEditor;    to the end of the categories line in the .desktop file for the app in /usr/share/applications
2012-06-13T07:56:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	where would I add it in this file?  It looks like this file has the format of variable=value
2012-06-13T07:57:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	oh never mind, I just read your last comment, thanks
2012-06-13T07:59:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	that didn't seem to work, wxmacmolplt still doesn't show up when I right-click on a .log file
2012-06-13T08:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	try logging off and on
2012-06-13T08:00:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	hmm is there a way to do it without restarting my session?  I have a job running that I would prefer not to interrupt
2012-06-13T08:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	not sure, i'd just wait for the job to finish. Maybe they are read periodically...
2012-06-13T08:03:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	unfortunately the job will take several more days to finish.  Guess I will try it out then.
2012-06-13T08:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	wow, large job!
2012-06-13T08:03:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	it is a quantum chemical calculation
2012-06-13T08:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	dang
2012-06-13T08:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	same way you added the TextEditor   option I gave..
2012-06-13T08:12:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	but I don't see a mime type variable in the .desktop value, what is the precise syntax?
2012-06-13T08:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	look at some of the others, you will see the category. With you stating this sort of thing I'm doubting you did what I sugegsted earlier at all...
2012-06-13T08:14:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	no I did, because I just had to append it to the end of an existing variable, but there is no mime type variable in the .desktop file
2012-06-13T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	look for: MimeType=    in the .desktop file and add what glitsj16 suggested
2012-06-13T08:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JW1	use the search function in the text editor you are using, or just add the line in full
2012-06-13T08:18:00.000Z	JW1	ActionParsnip	and glitsj16 unfortunately the MimeType trick didn't work either
