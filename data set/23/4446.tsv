2008-03-25T18:36:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	errm, if the files are world-writable .. that could still work despite the owner
2008-03-25T18:36:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	not that i am saying thats a good way to have it setup
2008-03-25T18:36:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	I don't thi^W^W do agree
2008-03-25T18:37:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	I was writing a disagreement, then agreed
2008-03-25T18:38:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	with your followup that is :)
2008-03-25T18:38:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	right right, i just saw a flurry of odd characters, wondering what was going on there :)
2008-03-26T00:54:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	gotta?  :)
2008-03-26T00:55:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	well, for all normal user purposes yes ;p
2008-03-26T00:55:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	well, isn't "sudo updatedb" for normal user purposes? :p
2008-03-26T00:55:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	nah, that's an admin function :)
2008-03-26T00:56:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	but, let me see you run sudo updatedb from alt-f2 (using gksudo something just before is cheating)
2008-03-26T00:56:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	ohh, i dont have an alt+f2 .. which is why i was asking ;)
2009-01-24T08:16:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	though, disown doesn't necessarily make the job immune to SIGHUPs
2009-01-24T08:17:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	but for the purpose?
2009-01-24T08:17:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	i guess it works .. depends on which process becomes the parent of the job then i think
2009-01-24T08:18:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	why I mentioned screen above: but with talk of nohup I was kinda wondering
2009-01-24T08:19:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	i'm not sure .. but i think with disown the parent of the shell i.e. gnome inherits the children when the shell exits .. in which case, if the user logged out (gnome terminated) the children would recieve the SIGHUP
2009-01-24T08:19:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	screen would be quite the perfect solution here, methinks
2009-01-24T08:20:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	more than I knew before and a testable hypothesis. thanks
2009-02-07T05:35:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	wouldn't sudo a2enmod userdir get the results you're looking for?
2009-02-07T05:35:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	the module is loaded by default - but you still need the directive in your site for it to be enabled and working
2009-02-07T05:36:00.000Z	nikrud	unop	that's provided in mods-available/userdir.conf iirc (don't have apache installed in this vm at work)
2009-02-07T05:37:00.000Z	unop	nikrud	that's what i said - the module is loaded by default, but it doesn't automagically work with your site - you still need the directive
