2007-12-03T12:52:00.000Z	romme		no, logged in as root to unmount /home
2007-12-03T12:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	You should NEVER do that
2007-12-03T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	Disconnect now and connect again from another computer if you have to but DO NOT EVER RUN XCHAT AS ROOT!
2007-12-03T12:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	You do not need to be root to unmount /home either
2007-12-03T12:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	You do not need to be root to unmount /home either
2007-12-03T12:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	You can do many things, su to a user that does not have a home directory at all, mount another home directory from another drive or change your current user's home directory to be somwhere outside of /home
2007-12-03T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	First of all, why are you trying to unmount /home, what is your goal?
2007-12-03T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	Also check lsof to confirm that there really are in fact no files open on your /home partition
2007-12-03T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	Can you use a LiveCD?
2007-12-03T13:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	Even when run as root?
2007-12-03T13:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	lsof only shows files open by your user IIRC
2007-12-03T13:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	Or all users when run as root
2007-12-03T13:02:00.000Z	romme	Jordan_U	i'm logged in as root, and ps ax | grep romme shows nothing
2007-12-03T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	What about "lsof | grep /home" ?
2007-12-03T13:04:00.000Z	romme	Jordan_U	under root, it shows nothing. should i do something like su romme and lsof /home ?
2007-12-03T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	No
2007-12-03T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	What error do you get when you try to umount /home?
2007-12-03T13:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	Is your /home on the same drive ( even if it's a seperate partition ) as / ?
2007-12-03T13:06:00.000Z	romme	Jordan_U	/dev/sda5 on /home type ext3 (rw,noatime,nodiratime,commit=900)
2007-12-03T13:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	Why don't you want to use a LiveCD?
2007-12-03T13:08:00.000Z	romme	Jordan_U	well, i want to troubleshoot a problem. might be worth filing a bug for it.
2007-12-03T13:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	romme	What problem?
2007-12-03T13:09:00.000Z	romme	Jordan_U	not being able to unmount a partition
