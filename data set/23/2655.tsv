2009-05-02T12:53:00.000Z	trece8		hi... installed ubuntu, works everything ok with generic kernel
2009-05-02T12:53:00.000Z	trece8		i install the RT kernel and can't display the graphics well
2009-05-02T12:53:00.000Z	trece8		it says "unsuitable screen" or something! (sorry, i don't remember exactly)
2009-05-02T12:54:00.000Z	trece8		it's a 22 inch widescreen screen (1680x1050), nvidia geforce6200, and linux-rt
2009-05-02T12:55:00.000Z	trece8		do somebody know how to install properly the nvidia driver in linux-rt in ubuntu 9.04?
2009-05-02T12:56:00.000Z	trece8		I know that in 8.04 it worked with nvidia-glx-new-envy
2009-05-02T12:56:00.000Z	trece8		but it doesn't seem to work now
2009-05-02T12:56:00.000Z	shadeslayer	trece8	go to system > admin >restricted drivers
2009-05-02T12:56:00.000Z	trece8	shadeslayer	i did it in the generic kernel, i tried before
2009-05-02T12:56:00.000Z	shadeslayer	trece8	its nvidia-glx-180 in jaunty
2009-05-02T12:57:00.000Z	shadeslayer	trece8	hmm,how very strange
2009-05-02T12:58:00.000Z	shadeslayer	trece8	well i dont think rt kernels are supported here :)

2009-05-02T15:39:00.000Z	trece8	shadeslayer	sometimes making ubottu say things doesn't make concepts clearer
2009-05-02T15:39:00.000Z	shadeslayer	trece8	i showed him the command to restart X
2009-05-02T15:42:00.000Z	trece8	shadeslayer	where is the terminal in the applications menu?
2009-05-02T15:42:00.000Z	shadeslayer	trece8	yes or alt-F2 then gnome-terminal
