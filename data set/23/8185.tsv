2004-12-08T10:03:00.000Z	Gwildor	GreenBox	you can if you enable it, but its best not to
2004-12-08T10:04:00.000Z	GreenBox		im using root do to things that require root permission. i don't wan anyone to access my root account, so i sudo -s and change password, and then use su -.
2004-12-08T10:05:00.000Z	Gwildor	GreenBox	this that require root....do this I.E. sudo apt-get update              sudo apt-get upgrade

2004-12-08T10:07:00.000Z	GreenBox		with sudo i don't need to write password each time, right?
2004-12-08T10:08:00.000Z	GreenBox		well that fucks it. then everyone with access to my computer while im loges on can also access root
2004-12-08T10:09:00.000Z	Gwildor	GreenBox	only if they know your user pass
2004-12-08T10:15:00.000Z	GreenBox	Gwildor	i meant WHILE I (my user account) is LOGGED ON
2004-12-08T10:19:00.000Z	Gwildor	GreenBox	yeah, but the USER will have to sudo before evry command they need root for, and if they dont know your user pass, they cant get root
2004-12-08T10:19:00.000Z	GreenBox		...
2004-12-08T10:19:00.000Z	GreenBox		ok
2004-12-08T10:19:00.000Z	GreenBox		like that
2004-12-08T10:20:00.000Z	GreenBox		this makes my user pass just as importent as the root pass
2004-12-08T10:20:00.000Z	Gwildor	GreenBox	sudo doesnt remember your pass for long, if you sudo apt-get update (enter your pass), then sudo apt-get upgrade (it will have your pass already), it doesnt REMEMBER much longer than that
