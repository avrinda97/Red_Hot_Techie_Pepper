2010-09-22T12:08:00.000Z	quietone		can anyone help me connect my laptop via my mobile phone?
2010-09-22T12:08:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	as in you're tethering you laptop to your phone?
2010-09-22T12:09:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	what is tethering?
2010-09-22T12:10:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	what are you connecting the two for?
2010-09-22T12:10:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	I need to access the web when I am not at home
2010-09-22T12:11:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	Then you're looking at tethering. Basically, you use your phone to give your laptop internet access
2010-09-22T12:11:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	What kind of phone is it?
2010-09-22T12:12:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	nokia 2730c. it can access the web. I can 'talk' to it via bluetooth (don't have a cable)
2010-09-22T12:14:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	Tethering through bluetooth is possible, are you aware of your cellphone carrier's data charges?
2010-09-22T12:14:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	Just because I don't want to help you commit financial suicide by racking up the world's biggest phone bill
2010-09-22T12:15:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	yes. my only choice is my phone or a vodem and they both have the same fee.
2010-09-22T12:15:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	Alright, good. Have you set up your bluetooth drivers?
2010-09-22T12:15:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	As in, can you connect the two?
2010-09-22T12:16:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1578329   will tell you what I have done
2010-09-22T12:19:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	do you know what bluetooth manager you have on ubuntu? bluez-gnome etc.
2010-09-22T12:20:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	bluez  on lucid
2010-09-22T12:24:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	You could try a different bluetooth manager and see if that helps
2010-09-22T12:26:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	at this stage I will try anything. what are the other ones I can try?
2010-09-22T12:27:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	There are a bunch. gnome-bluetooth, bluez-gnome, depends on what repositories you have and what's updated
2010-09-22T12:30:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	it looks like I have gnome-bluetooth and bluez installed. Do you think that is a problem?
2010-09-22T12:30:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	I'm not sure, bluetooth is one of my less-knowledgeable areas. They shouldn't conflict if you've only set one up, but as I said, I can't be sure
2010-09-22T12:33:00.000Z	quietone	MasterofPuppets	I've been mucking around so much I'll purge and start from scratch. Thx for listening.
2010-09-22T12:33:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	quietone	No problem, good luck!
