2006-04-21T08:40:00.000Z	luisito		sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-$(uname -r) reconfigures the last kernel image in the system?
2006-04-21T08:42:00.000Z	luisito		what does "sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-$(uname -r)" do?
2006-04-21T08:43:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	It reconfigures the kernel, so that involves making a new "initrd" a file used at boot, and rewriting the grub menu.lst file (in case you added a new kernel)
2006-04-21T08:44:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	thank you
2006-04-25T12:03:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	Make up something complicated, tell him it will break it and by the time he's learnt that you were making it up he knows enough about Linux to not install it :)
2006-04-25T12:04:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	the thing is, he have it installed.
2006-04-25T12:05:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	I think the damage has been done. Doesn't it change stuff irreversibly (for apt I mean, not manually)
2006-04-25T12:07:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	I have seen really weird thing like, when choosing the keyboard language the USA works like Latinamerican and vice-versa.
2006-04-25T12:08:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	What I was saying was that if you want to put it back to normal you have to change it back yourself, getting rid of Automatix won't do it
2006-04-25T12:08:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	Anyway, if you use a USA keyboard the " and @ are in the wrong place :)
2006-04-25T12:11:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	yeah, but his keyboard is spanish, when he uses the latinamerican layout it uses the USA layout and when he uses the USA layout then the Latinamerican is the layout, it is a really weird thing.
2006-04-25T12:12:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	Is this graphically (KDE or GNOME) or Xorg itself, or even terminals?
2006-04-25T12:16:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	well, I tried graphically only, but considering that he doesn't mess around with the system, like installing weird programs and exploring the system trying to change things, then I thing the fault is because automatix.
2006-04-25T12:18:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	Basically you set your locale (not entirely sure how to do this actually) for the whole system, including ctrl-alt-f1 terminals (if you don't know what that is then REMEMBER: ctrl-alt-f7) Then dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg will let you reconfigure Xorg language and finally KControl will let you reconfigure KDE, and System > Preferences > keyboard will do GNOME. Hope it helps
2006-04-27T16:03:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	No, but it's easy enough to get
2006-04-27T16:03:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	and it is very stable?
2006-04-27T16:04:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	Well it's as stable as Xgl at the moment (Dapper doesn't make it any less stable) but that is a bit unusable at the moment. I've had no porblems with crashing though
2006-04-27T16:06:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	ok :) . good to know.
2006-04-27T16:07:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	If you are coming from Windows it is perfectly usable. I'm too used to nice Window Manager controls (and I miss E16) like On Top and Sticky. Also Xine playback gets screwed up
2006-04-27T16:09:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	well, it is on pampers yet. we have to let it grow a little more.
2006-04-27T16:10:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	I want something which doesn't require a new Window Manager. (maybe AIGLX does this)
2006-04-27T16:12:00.000Z	luisito	Warbo	well, if it is going to use 3d technology I think the window manager will be reinvented. For a full 3d desktop experience I think.
2006-04-27T16:14:00.000Z	Warbo	luisito	I was thinking now that we have translucency maybe take away "focus on click" to enable using buttons obscured by a translucent window. Would need some ergonomic research...
