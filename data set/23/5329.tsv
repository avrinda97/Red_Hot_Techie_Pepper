2009-02-17T08:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	do you know what wireless device your laptop has?
2009-02-17T08:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	ok.. you want to get on a wireless network, so you must have a wireless device
2009-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	open a terimnal and type "lspci" no quotes, hit enter, and then pastebin the results and give me the link
2009-02-17T08:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	you currently have an internet connection on that machine?
2009-02-17T08:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	gimme a sec, i'll get you instructions to get that working
2009-02-17T08:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	do not download madwifi for that device.. gimme a second
2009-02-17T08:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	are you on 8.04 or 8.10?
2009-02-17T08:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	ok, go to system/admin/hardware drivers
2009-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	one more question, are you using 32bit, or 64bit?
2009-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	ok.. you should see an option there... "Support for Atheros 802.11 wireless lan cards" right?
2009-02-17T08:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	highlight that one, and at the bottom, click deactivate... its gonna tell you you have to restart, but don't do it just yet, just click close.
2009-02-17T08:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	type this w/o quotes... "/join #indygunfreak"
2009-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	ok
2009-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	i assume it worked.
2009-02-17T09:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	i take it it worked ok?
2009-02-17T09:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	hmm, gimme a sec, lemme help computerMoney and we'll se if we can figure that out.
2009-02-17T09:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	hmm.
2009-02-17T09:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	if you're seeing networks, then the device is presumably set up correctly.. what encryption level is your network using?
2009-02-17T09:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	deeejz	can you log in to your router?
