2010-08-30T22:33:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	Wow our bot must be offline.
2010-08-30T22:34:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	Well, it's going to be under applications and then a category usually.
2010-08-30T22:34:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	What specifically did you install?
2010-08-30T22:35:00.000Z	synvilla	avi_	It's not under appications. I installed 7zip, because archieve manager won't let me open RAR
2010-08-30T22:35:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	Then it would most likely not have an entry there. It probably just added a contextual menu item to Nautilus
2010-08-30T22:36:00.000Z	synvilla	avi_	not following
2010-08-30T22:36:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	So just right-click the compressed file and select 7zip.
2010-08-30T22:37:00.000Z	synvilla	avi_	that doesn't work, it wants to know where on the computer it is, I need to click on browse blabla. because 7zip is not in the list
2010-08-30T22:37:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	Try typing "killall nautilus" into a terminal.
2010-08-30T22:38:00.000Z	synvilla	avi_	wrote it
2010-08-30T22:39:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	All it does is restart nautilus.
2010-08-30T22:40:00.000Z	synvilla	avi_	it still can't find 7zi√•
2010-08-30T22:40:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	Interesting.. what sort of file are you trying to open?
2010-08-30T22:41:00.000Z	synvilla	avi_	 a RAR
2010-08-30T22:42:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	Yup. That was going to be my next statement.
2010-08-30T22:42:00.000Z	avi_	synvilla	sudo apt-get install unrar
2010-08-30T22:47:00.000Z	synvilla	avi_	nope, it still says BAD
