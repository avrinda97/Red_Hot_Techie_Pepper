2007-05-12T05:33:00.000Z	icebreeze		i'm currently switching from gentoo to ubuntu.  I have  files i need to back up but no place to put them.  It is possible to just delete the old file system and keep my files on the hard drive and not have to reformat it when installing ubuntu ?
2007-05-12T05:33:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	yep
2007-05-12T05:34:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	well how would i do that since i set the partition to root and it says it must be formatted anyway
2007-05-12T05:37:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	do you have a dvd burner?
2007-05-12T05:37:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	yes but i really don't want to do that... 20+ gigs isn't fun to burn..
2007-05-12T05:37:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	and actually i don't have a dvd burner on the linux computer just my laptop so its just a moot point
2007-05-12T05:37:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	I agree, but it really is your best option.
2007-05-12T05:38:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	there isn't a baselayout i could get like in gentoo?
2007-05-12T05:38:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	not really. you REALLY want to back up
2007-05-12T05:39:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	sigh... thought i loath compiling. i do miss the flexibility of a gentoo install...
2007-05-12T05:39:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	the install is about all you'll miss ;)
2007-05-12T05:40:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	i personally love gentoo.  just as a busy college student i don't want to maintain it right now
2007-05-12T05:41:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	i hear ya. I think you'll like ubuntu - maybe not as much as you do gentoo, but it'll get you by
2007-05-12T05:42:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	for sure... i just totally see no point i backing to back all this up...  just because of a root fs
2007-05-12T05:42:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	backups are a good idea anyway ;)
2007-05-12T05:43:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	if i click guided on how to partition.  will it automatically erase my drive when i click forward.?
2007-05-12T05:44:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	it should give you a checkbox next to the partitions it's going to format
2007-05-12T05:56:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	well i can't see how i'm going to back this up now.  Samba isn't working on the live cd.  I don't have a dvd burner in the linux comp.  Nor do i have a external hard drive.  Are you sure there is no base install i could od>
2007-05-12T05:56:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	move everything to a new directory under / ... /backup for example
2007-05-12T05:57:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	even if i do that it will erase that directory when it reformats the drive...
2007-05-12T05:57:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	yeah, don't reformat
2007-05-12T05:58:00.000Z	icebreeze	dick-richardson	it won't let me continue unless i choose reformat.
2007-05-12T05:59:00.000Z	dick-richardson	icebreeze	...I'm stumped then
