2009-12-15T07:11:00.000Z	nescius	zoug	thank you for that, but i was thinking something of qdbusviewer, but of less stupid interface (services part are really awful to work with)

2009-12-15T07:15:00.000Z	zoug	nescius	there is one dbus low-level api that you can use, but that is all another thing.

2009-12-15T07:21:00.000Z	zoug	nescius	i think, 90% of all the problems here can be solved by just going to ubuntuforums
