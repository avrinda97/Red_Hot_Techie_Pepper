2010-06-27T19:24:00.000Z	vu1kan	vodll	not sure i understand what you mean
2010-06-27T19:24:00.000Z	vodll	vu1kan	how do you connect to irc with pidgin? i created the irc account and then?
2010-06-27T19:24:00.000Z	vu1kan		vodll...oh...same as the procedure for joining a yahoo room
2010-06-27T19:25:00.000Z	vodll	vu1kan	what do you input in username/password on an irc connection? [really silly question I know]
2010-06-27T19:26:00.000Z	vu1kan	vodll	username would be your nick, and you can ignore the password unless you set one up with nickserve...either way nickserve will bug you about /identify
2010-06-27T19:28:00.000Z	vodll	vu1kan	hm weird...must be doing something wrong since nothing happens once I click save and I don't get an option to join anything
