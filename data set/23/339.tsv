2011-11-21T02:31:00.000Z	gajbooks		Is there any way of installing Ubuntu from Windows recovery mode?
2011-11-21T02:32:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	can you use a live cd?
2011-11-21T02:32:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	No, the CD drive in this crappy old thing died.
2011-11-21T02:34:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	how did you use the normall install for the flash-drive?
2011-11-21T02:35:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	Huh?
2011-11-21T02:36:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	you mentioned getting an error using a flash drive, how were you using it?
2011-11-21T02:36:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	I got an error from the BIOS: "Operating system not found".
2011-11-21T02:37:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	is this when you try booting normally, or booting from a usb?
2011-11-21T02:38:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	I took the HD out to see if that made a differnece, but that is what I got. I removed the HD because I kept having my ruined 7 install trying to boot.
2011-11-21T02:41:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	when your computer boots, try pushing f8 to get to a boot menu. (if that does not work, your bios probably shows you what to push). Also, do you know if the usb drive is bootable?
2011-11-21T02:42:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	Do you mean the setup? No, I do not know if the USB is bootable.
2011-11-21T02:43:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	What have you done to the usb so far?
2011-11-21T02:47:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	then the usb should be bootable. My guess is your bios setup does not look for usb drives. You should be able to fix that by going into the bios menu. If it doesn't have a usb option, it is probably an old bios, in which case check the manufacturer's website for an update.
2011-11-21T02:47:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	It has one, and it is set to first boot priority.
2011-11-21T02:49:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	do you have access to another computer you could use to install to the hd?
2011-11-21T02:49:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	Would it be possible to use a VM?
2011-11-21T02:51:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	Maybe, you would need to see if it can access the host's harddrive.
2011-11-21T02:52:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	If it would install for different hrdware, then how would that work right?
2011-11-21T02:54:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	the problem with using a VM on the host hd, is that the host OS might lock you out of direct access.
2011-11-21T02:57:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	I can directly mount USB drives in the VM, so I should be good. (I am going to use a HD to USB adapter)
2011-11-21T02:57:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	that should work
2011-11-21T02:59:00.000Z	gizmo	gajbooks	the default install is fairly generic. If there is a specific support missing you can always add it after installing.
2011-11-21T02:59:00.000Z	gajbooks	gizmo	Ah, thanks.
