2008-10-12T18:23:00.000Z	tehlrov		Can anyone here help me out with various sound issues?
2008-10-12T18:23:00.000Z	leachim6	tehlrov	shoot

2008-10-12T18:24:00.000Z	tehlrov	leachim6	my front mic is apparently broken: when I un-mute the front mic I get terrible hissing in my headphones, and capture doesn't work
2008-10-12T18:24:00.000Z	tehlrov	leachim6	I'm using an Intel HDA Audio controller, if that helps
2008-10-12T18:24:00.000Z	leachim6		eww....me too
2008-10-12T18:24:00.000Z	leachim6	tehlrov	I assume this is a laptop ?
2008-10-12T18:25:00.000Z	tehlrov	leachim6	no, this is a desktop with front headphone/mic ports; intel p35/ICH9R chipsets.  Playback through headphones works fine, but the mic is broken
2008-10-12T18:25:00.000Z	leachim6		ohh wait...
2008-10-12T18:25:00.000Z	leachim6		they're built-into the monitor ?
2008-10-12T18:25:00.000Z	tehlrov	leachim6	no, they're audio ports connected to headers on the motherboard
2008-10-12T18:26:00.000Z	tehlrov		they have separate volume controls in alsamixer
2008-10-12T18:26:00.000Z	leachim6		without knowing the exact computer you have there is no telling...
2008-10-12T18:26:00.000Z	tehlrov		It's a Gigabyte P35-DS3R motherboard, if that helps
2008-10-12T18:26:00.000Z	leachim6		I have the intel HDA audio controller too...I ended up booting windows for skype...
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	leachim6		I could never get it to work
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	tehlrov		it's not just skype
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	leachim6		I hope intrepid will fix it
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	tehlrov		my entire microphone system is broken
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	leachim6		I know, but that's all I use the mic for
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	tehlrov		whenever I unmute capture it causes terrible hissing in the audio out ports
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	leachim6	tehlrov	sounds like you've got the wrong driver
2008-10-12T18:27:00.000Z	tehlrov	leachim6	How would I check?
