2009-08-11T23:01:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	isn't /tmp a tmpfs by default?
2009-08-11T23:02:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	no.... discussions are still going on...
2009-08-11T23:02:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	that's the PITA in open source ... too many people with attitude :-)
2009-08-22T22:01:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	Better map Caps to Compose
2009-09-27T16:40:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	I think Ubuntu uses vol_id instead?
2009-09-27T16:40:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	let's see ...
2009-09-27T17:03:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	Cannot, they don't support symlinks.
2009-09-27T17:05:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	sman: exactly. in fact these are zero byte files on the iso-image, so they are just flags
2009-09-27T18:06:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	huh , that's scary. do you have an alias for that, or do you regularly type such command lines while inocently whistling on the console ? :-)
2009-09-27T18:06:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	I haven't needed to do things like that yet, so no, I don't have an alias for that.
2009-09-27T18:56:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	i wonder if there's actually a *desktop* mobo that supports more than 16GB hardware-wise on the market
2009-09-27T20:42:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	No, not really. init is a real process, 'System idle process' is just a fake entry.
2009-09-27T20:42:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	right... the concept is quite different
2009-09-27T20:42:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	init is a little more like the 'System' process in Windows.
2009-09-29T21:43:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt
2009-09-29T22:20:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	The "clients" will be running on the remote end - Firefox, gedit, whatever.
2009-09-29T22:19:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	Xming, or any other X server.
2009-09-29T22:20:00.000Z	stefg	grawity	xming is just the server .... you need the client
2009-09-29T22:20:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	Client such as?
2009-09-29T22:20:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	Xming and PuTTY are all you need on Windows.
2009-09-30T21:54:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	Tell that to BBS owners.
2009-09-30T21:56:00.000Z	grawity	stefg	It's not (it does come with a default install though)
