2005-06-14T05:24:00.000Z	syntaxerror64		the simple fact i can't find irssi means i probably shouldn't run it...  lol
2005-06-14T05:26:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: ive been in linux for 5yrs and i i'm clueless with windows..
2005-06-14T05:27:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	i'm the exact opposite :)
2005-06-14T06:02:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: do not run /exec -o yes bleh
2005-06-14T06:02:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	i certainly will not, i have no clue how to use this software.
2005-06-14T06:03:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	x-chat is easier to use than this
2005-06-14T06:05:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: no need for a mouse.. looks leet ect..
2005-06-16T15:34:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: need to make an alias for that
2005-06-16T15:34:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	sorry, i don't understand?
2005-06-16T15:36:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: an alias to quickly put that text on the screen since ppl keep buggering us with the same questions
2005-06-16T15:36:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	ohhh, gotcha :)
2005-06-16T15:43:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	was that directed at me?
2005-06-16T15:46:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	ah ok then i'll keep them disabled
2005-06-17T16:37:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	yes
2005-06-17T16:38:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: use your own fonts+sizes
2005-06-17T16:38:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	i tried, but it doesn't seem to be keeping them
2005-06-17T16:38:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	when i go back it's back to the ugly scrunched up tiny stuff
2005-06-17T16:39:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	i guess i didn't set it to override
2005-06-17T16:39:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: my advice.. build-dep mozilla-firefox and install the binary from the mozilla team
2005-06-17T16:39:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	i am not quite ready for that yet
2005-06-17T16:40:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	better than the one in synaptic package manager?
2005-06-17T16:40:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	syntaxerror64	: you wouldnt believe
2005-06-17T16:50:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	lsuactiafner	just copy them in there and that's it?
