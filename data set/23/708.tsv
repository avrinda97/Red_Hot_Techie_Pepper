2011-03-23T12:01:00.000Z	hosein		hi people! I tried to install ZendStudio and Zend Server CE on ubuntu. Now I am running Studio and Server seem's to be installed. but I and Studio can  not create any dir or file on www root directory with this error: "Parent of resource: /var/www/index.html is marked as read-only./var/www/index.html (Permission denied)"
2011-03-23T12:03:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	gksudo to launch your studio app might do it
2011-03-23T13:26:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	all your debs are cached in /var/cache/apt/archives if you are curious to see what's there
2011-03-23T13:28:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	so if the deb is still there, and still current, the next time you install the package Ubuntu will not get it from the net, but from the cache locally
2011-03-23T13:32:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	that's because you still had the config from last time (probably in ~/.someapp-config
2011-03-23T13:34:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	It is  zend server wrapper for phpMyAdmin, I dont know where it is installed?
2011-03-23T13:35:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	neither do I, sorry.
2011-03-23T13:37:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	you can use "apt-get purge somepackage" instead of apt-get remove , to remove config
2011-03-23T13:37:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	that should offer the config wizard next time you install it.
2011-03-23T13:39:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	without removing its .deb from chache?
2011-03-23T13:39:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	correct
2011-03-23T13:40:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	you never have to touch that cache. you can clear it if you want to save drive space for some reason. apt-get clean, apt-get autoclean  are different ways to clean it, look at the docs for details.
2011-03-25T08:18:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	remove the card and then start.
2011-03-25T08:19:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	what?! without any vga?!
2011-03-25T08:20:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	with the onboard vga on the motherboard
2011-03-25T08:20:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	my board have not it.
2011-03-25T08:22:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	then how were you using the computer before?
2011-03-25T08:23:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	I had a geforce card, now I buy an ATI.
2011-03-25T08:23:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	knowing what ATI card would be extremely helpful :)
2011-03-25T08:24:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	ATI Radeon HD 5450
2011-03-25T08:31:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	denight a person in this channel (named ruan) said that I must regenerate something! he asked me if I have access to terminal and showed me: sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.bak
2011-03-25T08:35:00.000Z	critical_max	hosein	there he is!
2011-03-25T08:36:00.000Z	hosein	critical_max	thank you very much!
