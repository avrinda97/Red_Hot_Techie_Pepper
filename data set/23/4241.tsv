2007-10-01T15:13:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	not sure if this will help, but in the old days I used Mandrake (Mandriva) and needed eagle usb stuff. is that installed?
2007-10-01T15:14:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	yes, it is but some guides say that it has to be removed cause it conflicts with the firmware i have to install
2007-10-01T15:14:00.000Z	Badseed		so i think i might try that
2007-10-01T15:14:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	it's the USB version then I assumd?
2007-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	Jowi		assume
2007-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	yes, unfortunately
2007-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	Jowi		!info eagle-usb-utils
2007-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	Badseed		the lights are on but no synchronization
2007-10-01T15:16:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	does the modems status light blink when you start the computer and then gets stable after a while?
2007-10-01T15:17:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	it gets on a couple of times but then both go out
2007-10-01T15:17:00.000Z	Badseed		the modem works well under windows
2007-10-01T15:20:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	have you seen this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/ueagle-atm
2007-10-01T15:22:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	yes, followed it except the step with the module removal which it says isn't necessary on 7.04
2007-10-01T15:25:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	then I don't have much else to add... If I remeber correctly, the lights go out if the firmware hasn't been loaded.
2007-10-01T15:26:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	yes it's a strange situation. i think i'll play with the module, there's nothing else to do. But thanks a whole lot for your time and interest :)
2007-10-01T15:27:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	I remember that eagle modem with horror. least I could do. ;)
2007-10-01T15:27:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	almost worth the investment to get  a "normal" modem with ethernet connection
2007-10-01T15:28:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	yes, i think that would be a better solution. will do as soon as i have the cash to get rid of the usb modm!
2007-10-01T15:29:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	hang on. which version is it? E4 or something else?
2007-10-01T15:30:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	it's the e4, which tends to work only by chance as i have understood from the various guides
2007-10-01T15:31:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	it's in french. altough not difficult level: http://www.siteduzero.com/tuto-3-16791-1-installer-un-sagem-f-st-800-e4-sous-ubuntu-edgy-eft-6-10-ou-feisty-fawn-7-04.html
2007-10-01T15:31:00.000Z	Jowi	Badseed	might be worth a shot
2007-10-01T15:32:00.000Z	Badseed	Jowi	thanks! :) missed that, will give it a try
