2005-08-09T13:52:00.000Z	MikeW		Okay, I'm installing warty. I can either set it up manually or have the installer using up all the hdd space.
2005-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	Use hoary
2005-08-09T14:11:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	Firefox loads much quicker on ubuntu for me
2005-08-09T14:15:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	Explain, whats your situation. 1 HDD?
2005-08-09T14:17:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	I got 2 hdds, IDE1 Master is where I'm installing ubuntu. I'll set up other OSes later. No matter though, I got it. Installing the base system now :)
2005-08-09T14:18:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	OK, as long as you have enough space and arn't overwriting anything
2005-08-09T14:18:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	Nah, I bought another hdd. I notice that the installer seen it as a 30gb hdd though :/
2005-08-09T14:19:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	Bah, might be windows fucking up the table, else you need to ajust the bios o.O
2005-08-09T14:20:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	I hope so, for your sake >_> what can your BIOS handle up to?
2005-08-09T14:20:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	32gb
2005-08-09T14:34:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	I'm looking into it, apparently its something to do with the partitioning
2005-08-10T14:01:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	linux would be the only os
2005-08-10T13:58:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	The partition table may be corrupt.
2005-08-10T13:59:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	Run a live CD (knoppix, ubuntu) and use cfdisk
2005-08-10T13:59:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	Then press "w" to re-write the partitions
2005-08-10T13:59:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	I picked the defaults, and reinstalled several times
2005-08-10T13:59:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	where the defaults were automatically partition the entire hdd
2005-08-10T14:00:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	I don't know. Have you googled it/
2005-08-10T14:00:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	yes, and it points me back to the ubuntu forums where the quesiton is unanswered
2005-08-10T14:00:00.000Z	MikeW	Stormx	I get the feeling its a grub problem :/
2005-08-10T14:00:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	GRUB does its best.
2005-08-10T14:01:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	So you can't access any OS's on that system?
2005-08-10T14:01:00.000Z	Stormx	MikeW	So surely you wouldn't need a boot loader?
