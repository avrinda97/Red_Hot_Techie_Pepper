2006-01-12T16:52:00.000Z	evert		hello all
2006-01-12T16:53:00.000Z	evert		how can i copy a file into ect/mozilla-firefox/profile/chrome ? i can't paste there a thing :(  i have to paste there a new userconfig.css file
2006-01-12T16:53:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 sudo
2006-01-12T16:55:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 then you'd have to start nautilus with gksudo i guess
2006-01-12T16:55:00.000Z	evert	kemik	; i'm completely new to ubuntu and to linux ... what you said is like chinese for me :(
2006-01-12T16:55:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 then learn chinese ;)
2006-01-12T16:56:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 you have different users which own files
2006-01-12T16:56:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 systemfiles are usually owned by the "root" user (the administrator if you like)
2006-01-12T16:56:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 and then there is your user
2006-01-12T16:56:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 in order to have "root" access, in ubuntu you use "sudo"
2006-01-12T16:57:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 yea
2006-01-12T16:57:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 but you can start "nautilus" (the 'explorer' app)
2006-01-12T16:57:00.000Z	kemik	evert	  "gksudo nautilius"  (not that i recommend todo that unless you have to)
2006-01-12T16:58:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 sudo works aswell, but gksudo is recommended for guiapps
2006-01-12T16:58:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 or you could use "cp" which i copy
2006-01-12T17:00:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 spelled it wrong
2006-01-12T17:03:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 what error do you get?
2006-01-12T17:03:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 and beware, using nautilus with root permissions can be devastating...
2006-01-12T17:04:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 well, you have to copy it first
2006-01-12T17:05:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 well, it doesnt carry over to anohter process
2006-01-12T17:05:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 what have you copied btw, a File or just text ?
2006-01-12T17:06:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 good
2006-01-12T17:08:00.000Z	kemik	evert	 not really... there are GUI equivalents to alot of things
