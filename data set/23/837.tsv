2011-04-07T04:56:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	you cannot.
2011-04-07T05:00:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	can you see me?
2011-04-07T05:01:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	yes...see what??
2011-04-07T05:01:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	did you see that I said no?
2011-04-07T05:02:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	okay, now you do.
2011-04-07T05:03:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	then how can i bypass mac filtering that only allow 00:00:00:00:00:00 to enter the router??
2011-04-07T05:03:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	I guess not.
2011-04-07T05:03:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	u mean there's no way??
2011-04-07T05:04:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	correct
2011-04-07T05:06:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	could you reconfigure your router?
2011-04-07T05:07:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	in that case, you may have to reset it to factory defaults.
2011-04-07T05:08:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	FYI, im remote
2011-04-07T05:09:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	then you will have to be local to reset to factory defaults.
2011-04-07T05:09:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	that's almost imposible
2011-04-07T05:10:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	nevertheless, it will be required if you can't access the unit any other way.
2011-04-07T05:13:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	that's how you described it..
2011-04-07T05:15:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	would it be possible for me to clone my mac to the mac of wired client connected to the router even if im wirelessly connected??
2011-04-07T05:16:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	you said that you had blocked all mac addresses except the one, so no, that would not help.
2011-04-07T05:18:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	OMG what have i done?then how can the local user connected to the router using wired connection connect to internet??
2011-04-07T05:19:00.000Z	ayecee	biborn	isn't the mac filter just for the wireless side?
2011-04-07T05:20:00.000Z	biborn	ayecee	yes u r right...i almost forgot bout that
