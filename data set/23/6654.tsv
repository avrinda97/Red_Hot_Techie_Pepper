2006-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	unix_infidel		hey guys, anyone here using vim7 deps or vim7 compiled on their system.
2006-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	unix_infidel		in dapper, of course, not edgy.
2006-09-23T08:28:00.000Z	unix_infidel		Been trying to find some debs or a decent how-to on vim7 compile that provides atleast binaries for deps or gives specific instructions on compiling them.
2006-09-23T08:30:00.000Z	unix_infidel		seriously doubt*
2006-09-23T08:32:00.000Z	unix_infidel		anyone for the vim question ( kitche ) ??
2006-09-23T08:34:00.000Z	unix_infidel		installing things that are really powerful for windows are MUCH more involved than for linux.
2006-09-23T08:34:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	I've built vim from source many times.  are you having a specific problem?
2006-09-23T08:34:00.000Z	unix_infidel	sethk	not specifically, i'm at the, how do i do it stage.
2006-09-23T08:34:00.000Z	unix_infidel	sethk	you know of a good tutorial.
2006-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	it's very very simple.  especially if you only want the command line version
2006-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	it's just three or four steps, so I doubt there is a tutorial.
2006-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	unix_infidel	sethk	nono, i'm looking for vim-gnome/gtk/python/perl
2006-09-23T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	that's just as easy, _if_ you have all the required libraries and headers
2006-09-23T08:37:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	try it.  worst thing that happens is that configure complains that this, that, or the other thing is missing.
2006-09-23T08:47:00.000Z	unix_infidel	sethk	did you do apt-get remove --purge vim first before compiling from cvs?
2006-09-23T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	no
2006-09-23T08:47:00.000Z	unix_infidel	sethk	just installed on top of the regular binary?
2006-09-23T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	if you build from source with the default destination it will install to /usr/local and the two versions will not step on each other.
2006-09-23T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	then you should make two aliases, one for /usr/bin/vim and another for /usr/local/bin/vim
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	you can use the --prefix=/usr   with configure it you want it to step on your binary.
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	unix_infidel	sethk	hmm, ahh, ok.
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	unix_infidel	but I think keeping them separate is wiser.
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	unix_infidel	sethk	yea, alias sounds good to me, thanks.
