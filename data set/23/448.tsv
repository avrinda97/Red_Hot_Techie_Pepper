2011-08-16T20:40:00.000Z	Dan18		new user / account creation problems, would this be here?
2011-08-16T20:40:00.000Z	Dan18		to ask about?
2011-08-16T20:41:00.000Z	Dan18		ok. let me try: created a new user, logged in to the new user, but home folders werent created
2011-08-16T20:41:00.000Z	Dan18		for the new users -- hence login failed with various .abc files not found
2011-08-16T20:41:00.000Z	Dan18		no idea why home folders werent created.
2011-08-16T20:42:00.000Z	Dan18		via system, administration - user groups - add user
2011-08-16T20:43:00.000Z	Dan18		ok, created a new user again -- only folder that was created i home is "Examples"
2011-08-16T20:45:00.000Z	Dan18		right, etc skel only includes Examples
2011-08-16T20:45:00.000Z	Dan18		why is that?
2011-08-16T20:46:00.000Z	Dan18		anything i did or didnt do
2011-08-16T20:46:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	what did you expect?
2011-08-16T20:47:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	it's the usual behavior. If you log with the user into gnome e.g., gnome will create it's folder-and configstructure
2011-08-16T20:47:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	it's exactly the default behaviour
2011-08-16T20:49:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	yes. And this implies a method for getting back to the default config: by deleting/moving the config-folders
2011-08-16T20:49:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	not every user on a system needs a desktop
2011-08-16T20:50:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	the desktop-files are created by the desktop-environment
2011-08-16T20:50:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	or define your own skel(eton) structure
2011-08-16T23:00:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	what's the problem?
2011-08-16T23:02:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	Gnome doesn't need any file/folder in $HOME to start
2011-08-16T23:03:00.000Z	Dan18	rumpe1	what process/program requires these settings
2011-08-16T23:04:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	none
2011-08-16T23:05:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	what exactly doesn't work?
2011-08-16T23:07:00.000Z	rumpe1	Dan18	you could check $HOME/.xsession-errors for errors
