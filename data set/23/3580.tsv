2008-03-14T03:41:00.000Z	gintu		What is the command to list all the user accounts on an ubuntu system?
2008-03-14T03:42:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	it might be "users" but look it up first
2008-03-14T03:43:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	users only outputs who is currently logged in, I want all the user accounts on the system even if they're not logged in
2008-03-14T03:46:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	did you try "who" ?
2008-03-14T03:47:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	Who also only shows who is logged on (i want not logged on as well).  Can I invoke "Users and Groups" at the command line? I'm attempting to list all users accounts.
2008-03-14T03:49:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	not sure then if they don't do it
2008-03-14T03:51:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	i guess all users would be listed in /etc/passwd wouldn't they
2008-03-14T03:51:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	yeah, how would i display that?
2008-03-14T03:52:00.000Z	gbz		cat /etc/passwd
2008-03-14T03:52:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	that's what i tried but it's a mess :( I just want the users
2008-03-14T03:53:00.000Z	gbz		maybe try #>cat /etc/passwd |grep 500*
2008-03-14T03:54:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	that doesn't display anything. i think for this advanced functionality i'll have to go back to windows :(
2008-03-14T03:55:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	i tired id -nu also but it only works for the current user :\
2008-03-14T03:56:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	can you use the gui instead?
2008-03-14T03:59:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	the gui does just what i want (Users and Groups) but I'm working from the commandline and need to display all user accounts :(
2008-03-14T03:59:00.000Z	gintu		this is a bash shell before gnome has loaded
2008-03-14T04:00:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	ok well if all regular users have home directorys, maybe you can find them, eg /home/gintu means gintu is a user ?
2008-03-14T04:02:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	not all users have home directors ex /root, there should be a command to list the users and there doesn't appear to be :(
2008-03-14T04:02:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	well i am stumped ;)
2008-03-14T04:03:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	me too, back into windows land for me x_x
2008-03-14T04:03:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	thanks for your time.
2008-03-14T04:03:00.000Z	gbz	gintu	try google if you cannot find an answer here, must be possible
2008-03-14T04:04:00.000Z	gintu	gbz	i have a few hours into it already and nothing comes up, i want to know how "users settings" gui does it because that's what i want
