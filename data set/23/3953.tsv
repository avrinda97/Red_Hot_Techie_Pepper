2009-02-02T04:58:00.000Z	tsrk		Hi, I'm trying to print pictures on a 4 x 6 paper.  When I go into the page setup and choose 4 x 6, but when i close it and reopen it it says 2.12 x 1.41 inch.  Why does this happen?  Does it make any sense?
2009-02-02T05:00:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	ppi, Pixels per Inch, tsrk what are you modifying the image with, and are you saving the change?
2009-02-02T05:01:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	I mean when I close (by clicking apply) the page setup dialog... and it happens in Gimp and the default photo editor (F-Spot i believe).  I don't actually close the image, just the page setup dialog, but when I try to print it prints the tiny 2 x 1.5 inch dimensions.
2009-02-02T05:03:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	are you changing the ppi setting?  image Resolution or something like that.  /me loads gimp
2009-02-02T05:04:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	not in the page setup.  I don't change anything else.  (There's very few options, just the printer, size, and orientation)
2009-02-02T05:07:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	you are changing page setup?  you need to change image resolution.  Not sure how it is labeled or where to find it.
2009-02-02T05:07:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	Do not change resize the image.  You only want the inches and ppi to change.  pixels should remain the same.
2009-02-02T05:07:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	it has a DPI setting in the print dialogue, but i'm having this problem even before then.  All i want to do is make a 4 x 6 print, but it's always making it way to small.
2009-02-02T05:07:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	i'm not change pixles, i'm changing inches
2009-02-02T05:08:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	That's it.  DPI, Dots Per inch.  probably defaults to 75 dpi.
2009-02-02T05:08:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	but it needs to print 4 x 6, and it's giving me 1200 dpi
2009-02-02T05:09:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	page setup is for the printer.  Not the image.
2009-02-02T05:09:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	 you need to chnage the image settings.
2009-02-02T05:10:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	ohh, ok, i see what you're saying, i'll try that
2009-02-02T05:12:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	you see where it says resolution of 72 ppi?
2009-02-02T05:12:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	yeah, i should set that to 1200 right?
2009-02-02T05:13:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	don't set it based on the ppi.
2009-02-02T05:13:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	resize the image, keeping the same pixel, but increasing the inches.  The result, the ppi will change.
2009-02-02T05:13:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	ok, how do I do that?
2009-02-02T05:13:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	in other words, you want to scale without resizing.
2009-02-02T05:14:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	yeah, how do i tell it to keep pixles constant though?
2009-02-02T05:15:00.000Z	uncmar	tsrk	I could show you if I had gimp,   I guess I could install on this tiny crappy laptop.
2009-02-02T05:15:00.000Z	tsrk	uncmar	i think i mighta got it, i'm trying it now
