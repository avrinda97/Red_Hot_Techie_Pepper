2011-11-07T07:24:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	no
2011-11-07T07:24:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	it's already installed though.
2011-11-07T07:25:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	Ubuntu Software Center you're saying, and search for ubuntu one
2011-11-07T07:27:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	i'm sorry, i have no idea what you're talking about. i have no left panel.
2011-11-07T07:28:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	i said I am running 10.04, i don't have unity installed.
2011-11-07T07:30:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	have you ever gotten UbuntuOne to work in 10.04? There is NO UbuntuOne choice within Internet inside Applications.
2011-11-07T07:31:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	before maverick, you would click on UbuntuOne within System>Preferences and it should trigger a webpage to open which has a button that says "Add this Computer" That is NOT occuring
2011-11-07T07:31:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	well, there is no UbuntuOne within Applications>Internet
2011-11-07T07:33:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	only System within Applications is System Tools and there is NO UbuntuOne choice there either.
2011-11-07T07:35:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	it's installed by default.
2011-11-07T07:35:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	these directions do NOT work
2011-11-07T07:36:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	oops, sorry. https://one.ubuntu.com/help/tutorial/install-and-setup-ubuntu-one-8/
2011-11-07T07:36:00.000Z	lilrubyprog	mazda01	so I am guessing you figured it out?
2011-11-07T07:37:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	NO
2011-11-07T07:37:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	the link i posted does NOT work
2011-11-07T07:38:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	yes.

2011-11-07T07:42:00.000Z	lilrubyprog	mazda01	Which browser you using?
2011-11-07T07:44:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	firefox 3.6.23
2011-11-07T07:45:00.000Z	mazda01	lilrubyprog	no, what, would i install google chrome and set that as my default browser in my preferences?
