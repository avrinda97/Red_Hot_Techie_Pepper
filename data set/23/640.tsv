2011-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	Bronz		I know you guys are busy, but I still hope for some help with booting the LiveCD on a computer with an NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GT, 256Mb...
2011-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	Bronz		The computer will freeze upon starting the graphical environment. I'd get the "ubuntu" splash screen (with the progressive dots), then blink to a garbage screen of static, and the computer would freeze.
2011-04-29T07:37:00.000Z	rileyp	Bronz	start to a prompt and remove type sudo xconfig and then type startx that should give tyou basic grahpics then google how to install your nvidia drivers
2011-04-29T07:38:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	thanks, how do I start the liveCD to a prompt instead of graphical?
2011-04-29T07:38:00.000Z	Bronz		Also rileyp: what do you mean "remove type sudo xconfig"?
2011-04-29T07:39:00.000Z	rileyp	Bronz	are you trying to run from a live cd or install from alive cd
2011-04-29T07:39:00.000Z	rileyp		if running from a live cd do not choose nvidia driver in setup
2011-04-29T07:40:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	eventually install, but right now just vboot. I can't do either because of the freeze. If I can get the basic graphics you say, that should be enough; I can install nvidia-current on my own after that.
2011-04-29T07:41:00.000Z	rileyp	Bronz	often graphics fail because they are not set up correctly and leave you with no screen. To avoid this use default video drivers and they will work. This will get your system up and running have aplay then google how to install nvidia drivers and do so accordingly
2011-04-29T07:42:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	OK, how do I tell the live-CD to boot using default video drivers?
2011-04-29T07:43:00.000Z	rileyp		Also rileyp: what do you mean "remove type sudo xconfig"?  to remove any nvidia created xorg.conf which most probably is casing your x screen to fail  by typeing sudo xconfig a std xorg.conf will be created using std driversl
2011-04-29T07:44:00.000Z	rileyp		bronx do not select nvidia
2011-04-29T07:45:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	I mean, if I load the live-CD, it will attempt to go into graphical mode on its own; how do I stop it from doing that? How do I tell it to use "default" or "safe" video drivers when booting?
2011-04-29T07:46:00.000Z	rileyp		ziber http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766683
2011-04-29T07:46:00.000Z	rileyp		ziber that will fix any audio issue you have :D
2011-04-29T07:48:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	Don't forget about me! How do I boot a liveCD without it trying to use the nvidia graphics (or whatever is causing it to freeze when starting the graphical env)?
2011-04-29T07:48:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	(thanks for the help, though 8-))
2011-04-29T07:49:00.000Z	rileyp	Bronz	If live cd will not boot for you and your not selcting nvidia I cant help sorry. I never use livecd.
2011-04-29T07:50:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	Yeah, I'm not actively selecting anything; I don't see any options to change the video either. Thanks for the help, though, it is going in the right direction. I'll try the alternative disk to see if any ideas pop up.
2011-04-29T07:51:00.000Z	Bronz		Congratulations guys on the new release. If I still have troubles I'll come back in a day or two, hopefully the traffic will have subsided a bit by then.
2011-04-29T07:51:00.000Z	rileyp	Bronz	at screen freeze you could try CTRL+alt +f1 and see what happens you may end up in a tty session meaning ubuntu has started up completely but gdm has failed thenits just a matter of resolving that
2011-04-29T07:52:00.000Z	Bronz	rileyp	Oh, good idea. I'll try that too. Thanks.
2011-04-29T07:52:00.000Z	rileyp	Bronz	 are you trying latest ubuntu?
