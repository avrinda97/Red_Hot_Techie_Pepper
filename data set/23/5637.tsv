2006-10-21T14:55:00.000Z	whyso		if i have a tar.gz, how do i install it?
2006-10-21T14:56:00.000Z	Hal_	whyso	in a terminal:
2006-10-21T14:56:00.000Z	Hal_		tar -zxvf [PACKAGE NAME] 
2006-10-21T14:56:00.000Z	Hal_		To extract.
2006-10-21T14:57:00.000Z	Hal_		I can't use apt-get sky123, I don't have an internet connection on the box in question.
2006-10-21T14:58:00.000Z	Hal_		I am windows right now on my GF's computer.
2006-10-21T14:58:00.000Z	Hal_		Furthermore, I already have network-manager.
2006-10-21T14:58:00.000Z	Hal_		That's exactly what I'm using to connect.
2006-10-21T14:58:00.000Z	Hal_		None at all.
2006-10-21T14:58:00.000Z	Hal_		BUT!
2006-10-21T14:59:00.000Z	Hal_		If I try to use google in an explorer, no results.
2006-10-21T14:59:00.000Z	Hal_		It's bizzare, I installed the firestarter package to see if it was a firewall interfering with it, but no such luck.
2006-10-21T14:59:00.000Z	Hal_		No lol
2006-10-21T15:00:00.000Z	Hal_		No I don't use a proxy.
2006-10-21T15:00:00.000Z	Hal_		And I checked all that in the broswer.
2006-10-21T15:00:00.000Z	Hal_		brower*
2006-10-21T15:00:00.000Z	Hal_		Yeh it's got me stumped too.
2006-10-21T15:01:00.000Z	Hal_		All I can guess is that it's just a DUD windows driver that ndiswrapper can't use, or that my wireless router is having trouble.
2006-10-21T15:01:00.000Z	Hal_		Yes.
2006-10-21T15:01:00.000Z	Hal_		But msn.com won't work.
2006-10-21T15:01:00.000Z	Hal_		LOL ironically
2006-10-21T15:01:00.000Z	Hal_		Hey, lets not start we'll never finish :)
2006-10-21T15:02:00.000Z	whyso	Hal_	thanks!!!
