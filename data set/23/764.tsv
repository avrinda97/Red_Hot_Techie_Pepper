2011-03-29T00:42:00.000Z	Cem_Nome5		So
2011-03-29T00:43:00.000Z	Cem_Nome5		I accidentally removed the plug from my computer
2011-03-29T00:43:00.000Z	Cem_Nome5		and when I started it again
2011-03-29T00:43:00.000Z	Cem_Nome5		a strange screen is appearing
2011-03-29T00:43:00.000Z	Cem_Nome5		saying to boot the selected OS
2011-03-29T00:43:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Anything else? Anything you can choose?
2011-03-29T00:44:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Pick first line, hit enter
2011-03-29T00:44:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Should boot like normal
2011-03-29T00:45:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	What happens? What were you doing when you lost power?
2011-03-29T00:45:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Were you doing a system update at the time?
2011-03-29T00:46:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	That wouuld finish the installs
2011-03-29T00:47:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	In effect, complete the interrupted update
2011-03-29T00:47:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Could doi please do a ls / and tell us what is there?
2011-03-29T00:50:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Is that the same thing it's saying with the normal mode?
2011-03-29T00:50:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Please check, if it is, you will need a liveCD to repair this since it might have interrupted a kernel update.
2011-03-29T00:51:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	It's not that bad! No data is lost, just.. incomplete core..
2011-03-29T00:52:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Please first get a liveCD or liveUSB ready, you will need to to get back into the system and hopefully have it repair itself
2011-03-29T00:53:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	.... ext2? Which was the original ubuntu installed on this? ext2 isn't a journaling system yet..
2011-03-29T00:54:00.000Z	Cem_Nome5	Dcite	I tried a different generic here
2011-03-29T00:54:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Did you download that january one?
2011-03-29T00:56:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Please try to boot again, choose the Ubuntu entry just above memtest86.. or which ever generic is on the bottom
2011-03-29T00:57:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	I.. wasn't expecting that....
2011-03-29T00:58:00.000Z	Dcite	Cem_Nome5	Please try to get a linux cd.. ANY..
