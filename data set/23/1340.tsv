2010-05-07T17:45:00.000Z	dto		hi. compiz doesn't start automatically on login. the compiz fusion icon thinks compiz is running, but it doesn't work until i select it again.
2010-05-07T17:46:00.000Z	defswork	dto	you might have a saved session that doesnt parse
2010-05-07T17:46:00.000Z	dto	defswork	how might i fix that? i have been thinking something is up with my gnome-config :)
2010-05-07T17:46:00.000Z	defswork	dto	delete all your saved sessions
2010-05-07T17:47:00.000Z	dto	defswork	where are they?
2010-05-07T17:47:00.000Z	dto	defswork	am i supposed to set Desktop Effects to normal? it's "none" now.
2010-05-07T17:49:00.000Z	defswork	dto	if you have the same issue as I did - do that rm, log out and in again and then turn on compiz
2010-05-07T17:49:00.000Z	dto	defswork	what should i delete? i don't know where the sessions are.
2010-05-07T17:49:00.000Z	defswork	dto	 rm -R ~/.config/gnome-session/saved-session
2010-05-07T17:49:00.000Z	dto	defswork	thank you :)
2010-05-07T17:50:00.000Z	dto	defswork	brb
2010-05-07T17:52:00.000Z	dto	defswork	ok i did that and logged back in, but still had to start compiz manually.
2010-05-07T17:53:00.000Z	defswork	dto	yeah but maybe now it works if you log out and back in
2010-05-07T17:53:00.000Z	dto	defswork	ok i will try in a moment
2010-05-07T17:54:00.000Z	dto	defswork	and i am still getting tearing issues with nvidia despite all the sync-to-vblank boxes being checked
2010-05-07T17:54:00.000Z	defswork	dto	using vdp ?
2010-05-07T17:55:00.000Z	defswork	dto	vdpau
2010-05-07T17:55:00.000Z	dto	defswork	i see vdpau packages in synaptic, but no program.
2010-05-07T17:55:00.000Z	dto	defswork	do you mean the nvidia options menu thing?
2010-05-07T17:57:00.000Z	dto	defswork	how do I tell whether vdpau is running?
2010-05-07T18:19:00.000Z	dto	defswork	the system seems to think this monitor refreshes at 59.88 hz
2010-05-07T18:41:00.000Z	dto	defswork	my tearing occurs only during window moving, not video playback.
2010-05-07T18:42:00.000Z	dto	defswork	however i can't seem to play dvd's. movie player says "error reading from resource" instead. i have ubuntu-restriced-extras installed though
