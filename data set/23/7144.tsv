2010-03-23T13:48:00.000Z	dudeface		hi all
2010-03-23T13:49:00.000Z	dudeface		hi
2010-03-23T13:49:00.000Z	dudeface		is this where i talk about coding?
2010-03-23T13:49:00.000Z	dudeface		i am keen to help the project
2010-03-23T13:49:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	what kind of coding
2010-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	dudeface		well, i have recently sold my business, and am getting bored, so i am keen to code for ubuntu full time
2010-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	there's nothing stopping you.
2010-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	dudeface		and what i want is a better end user experience, and was wondering weather to start here, or to talk to the gnome guys
2010-03-23T13:51:00.000Z	dudeface		 i program in c and assembly
2010-03-23T13:51:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	send patches to the gnome ml
2010-03-23T13:51:00.000Z	dudeface		but i want to present myself as a project manger for something
2010-03-23T13:51:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	why?
2010-03-23T13:51:00.000Z	dudeface		i think i can be better than a coder
2010-03-23T13:51:00.000Z	dudeface		well, i work for xbmc
2010-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	the only project manager you can be is if you fork a project and be your own manager
2010-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	dudeface		and it has to be one of the best open sourse projects right now
2010-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	you can't just sai"hey guys i wanna be your project manager"
2010-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	dudeface		i think i can improve gtk a large ammount
2010-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	so send patched to gtk then
2010-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	rsk		patches*
2010-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	dudeface		well if i am not wanted i will just go work for bsd
2010-03-23T13:53:00.000Z	dudeface	ubuntu	obviously has a large hand in gnome, was just wondering if anyone knew what channel to join
2010-03-23T13:54:00.000Z	rsk	dudeface	there's no channel where you can be a project manager for a day no
