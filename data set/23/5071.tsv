2007-02-28T17:05:00.000Z	ernz		Hello. I am using Beryl with Edgy and whenever I go fullscreen on a video playback I get choppy video. Can anyone help?
2007-02-28T17:05:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	xv or x11 output?
2007-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	- Dunno. I am using Totem
2007-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	run gstreamer-properties
2007-02-28T17:06:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	if you are using ximagesink, that is expected since you are not using the hardware scaler
2007-02-28T17:07:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	- Output is: "Autodetect" Whenever I run a video the CPU jumps right up.
2007-02-28T17:07:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	set it to xvimagesink and click test
2007-02-28T17:08:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	- xvimagexink isn't there.
2007-02-28T17:08:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	- SDL/x-no xv/x-x11/customer
2007-02-28T17:09:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	try the third one
2007-02-28T17:09:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	when you select it what does the Pipeline field say?
2007-02-28T17:09:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	- I made a custom called xvimagesink. The "Test" button worked on that
2007-02-28T17:10:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	- ................xvimagesink.......... :p
2007-02-28T17:12:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	Still choppy :(
2007-02-28T17:13:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	are you using totem-gstreamer or totem-xine
2007-02-28T17:13:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	Unknown
2007-02-28T17:14:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	in totem, help->about
2007-02-28T17:15:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	Using xine-lib
2007-02-28T17:16:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	that explains why gstreamer-properties does'nt work
2007-02-28T17:16:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	Oh. How can I fix that then? :)
2007-02-28T17:17:00.000Z	crdlb	ernz	look in the totem preferences
2007-02-28T17:17:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	Nothing in preferences along the lines of xine/gstreamer
2007-02-28T17:19:00.000Z	ernz	crdlb	Thanks for your help I will play with it a little more tomorrow. Cheers.
