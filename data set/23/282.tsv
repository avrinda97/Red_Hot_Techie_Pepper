2012-02-01T17:29:00.000Z	crizzy		doesn't 11.04/11.10 include working oss driver for bm43?
2012-02-01T17:30:00.000Z	crizzy		i'd remember so
2012-02-01T17:30:00.000Z	BenSprz	crizzy	you're saying? get a newer distro?
2012-02-01T17:30:00.000Z	crizzy		yes
2012-02-01T17:31:00.000Z	BenSprz		i kind of liked the lts idea with 10.04 though for i am new to this topic (as in linux...)
2012-02-01T17:31:00.000Z	crizzy		sure
2012-02-01T17:31:00.000Z	crizzy		but it also means it's already 2 years old
2012-02-01T17:31:00.000Z	crizzy		with 2 years old drivers
2012-02-01T17:32:00.000Z	BenSprz		crizzy/reisio: the laptop is 5 years old, shouldnt a 2 year old distro have the proper drivers?
2012-02-01T17:32:00.000Z	crizzy		open driver for these crappy chipsets didn't exist 2 years ago
2012-02-01T17:32:00.000Z	crizzy		so no
2012-02-01T17:32:00.000Z	BenSprz		and: i checked help.ubuntu.com, i read lots, tried lots of commands, but to no avail
2012-02-01T17:33:00.000Z	crizzy	BenSprz	and yes, i seemed to remember somewhat right: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/broadcom-releasing-fully-open-source-driver-wifi-driver/
2012-02-01T17:33:00.000Z	crizzy		(this dated 5 months after LTS release)
2012-02-01T17:34:00.000Z	crizzy		so 11.10 should have this for sure
2012-02-01T17:34:00.000Z	crizzy		and besides, you can upgrade to 12.04 soonish pretty painlessly, it will be LTS too
2012-02-01T17:34:00.000Z	BenSprz	crizzy	i did mean no offense, just trying to switch to linux and learn something while im at it
2012-02-01T17:35:00.000Z	crizzy	BenSprz	well, yes, broadcom chipsets were one of the last 'painful' common hardware cases with linux, but just pick latest 11.10 rel and you should be ok
2012-02-01T17:36:00.000Z	crizzy	BenSprz	or, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx this might help. i'd still just go for newer distro and forget old problems
2012-02-01T17:39:00.000Z	crizzy	BenSprz	and if you're trying to 'convert' to linux, i'd recommend not to :) install dualboot, investigate linux, find out how to do things in linux, which ways to do things work best, etc. but don't try to forcefully 'convert'
2012-02-01T17:40:00.000Z	crizzy	BenSprz	usually this only leads to eventually hitting some thing that works differently than what you're used to in windows / what you don't get working / and then you just get frurstrated
2012-02-01T17:41:00.000Z	crizzy		unity is way more keyboard friendly than gnome2 ever was, though
2012-02-01T17:42:00.000Z	BenSprz	crizzy	if i were to get frustrated easily I'd not be in this forum anymore. I'm trying to do exactly that: learning how to do things in linux
