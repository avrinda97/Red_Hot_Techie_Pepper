2010-11-27T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 hulu works very well here.
2011-01-26T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 repartition the hd, then reformat it.
2011-01-26T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 delete the partitions using a gparted live cd, then use whatver os you want to repartition/reformat as needed.
2011-01-26T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 you may want to be sure you got windows bootloader reinstalled first.
2011-01-26T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 most every iso/live cd out - can be put on a pendrive.
2011-01-26T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 if theres no windows partitions. then theres no c:  or other letters.
2011-01-26T19:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 #windows channel perhaps can help. I dont use XP any more.
2011-01-26T19:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 you can delete the partions from a XP/windows cd/install also..
2011-01-26T19:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 or use the fdisk command and the 'd' to delete.. to delete them all.. then 'w'rite changes to disk.
2011-01-26T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 the xp installer may have some partioning tools. I dont use it.  so you got options mentioned above to try.
2011-01-26T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 gparted is a special linux disrto for 'partitoning' and workign with hard drives.
2011-01-26T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jonny	 you can use it to delete all partions if you want. and remake new ones how you like.
