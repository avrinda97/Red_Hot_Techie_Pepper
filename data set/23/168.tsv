2012-06-20T13:10:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	do you have 3d enabled in your VM?
2012-06-20T13:23:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	/ theadmin seems like I got it to work now \0/ thaaaanks
2012-06-20T13:25:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	one of my machines runs gnome shell, but it gets annoying pretty quickly
2012-06-20T13:25:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	what do you prefer then?
2012-06-20T13:26:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	my main desktop runs xfce 4.10, closest thing i've found to what im looking for
2012-06-20T13:28:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	its very customisable don't think your stuck with the default desktop you get when you boot if it doesnt suit
2012-06-20T13:28:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	great! and I have an expert in you :P
2012-06-20T13:32:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	- do I need the compiz something?
2012-06-20T13:32:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	for gnome shell? no
2012-06-20T13:32:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	for xfce :)
2012-06-20T13:33:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	"After you install/upgraded XFCE you might want to get Compiz/Emerald working on it"
2012-06-20T13:34:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	you'd like to have compiz? xfce has its own compositing window manager
2012-06-20T13:34:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	not really sure what it is and do :/
2012-06-20T13:36:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	I wouldn't really worry about it too much at this stage
2012-06-20T13:37:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	just changed from windows(all my life) to at work to have 12.04 only
2012-06-20T13:37:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	you can get the built in from settings->window manager tweaks->compositor and enable that
2012-06-20T13:38:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	your work uses 12.04?
2012-06-20T13:38:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	my workspaces do, the other guy using a mac, but they cant afford it to me
2012-06-20T13:39:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	looks like you might have won out there :)
2012-06-20T13:40:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	mostly right now I'm suffering due old habbits
2012-06-20T13:40:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	"use dafault panel" or "empty panel" at startup
2012-06-20T13:41:00.000Z	cvr	Jacta	default to start with, you can customise panels how u want and how many later
2012-06-20T13:47:00.000Z	Jacta	cvr	do you have a screenshot of your current setup? :)
