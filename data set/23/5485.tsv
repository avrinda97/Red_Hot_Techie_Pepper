2008-10-31T03:49:00.000Z	earthen		Hey guys i'm try to find the name of the program that gives me the tool bar similar to that of the mac tool bar
2008-10-31T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	awn is one I think
2009-08-06T18:12:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	login as root? something went wrong there..
2009-08-06T18:12:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	what do you mean
2009-08-06T18:13:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	well never really loged in as root just started nautilus as root
2009-08-06T18:14:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	but in older versions of ubuntu it would alway show up as root like i told it too
2009-08-06T18:14:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	as windows soory
2009-08-06T18:14:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	ahh.. now that's an entirely different thing. I'm not sure why it's different.. probably some setting that isn't configured for the root user
2009-08-06T18:15:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	it's more like it's using what i told it to and my account is not
2009-08-06T18:15:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	I'm not sure what is responsible for naming hard drives in nautilus.. udev perhaps
2009-08-06T18:16:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	it's not only that even the icon that is created on my desktop is wrong
2009-08-06T18:16:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	I would rather it say windows rather than just 21 gb media
2009-08-06T18:17:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	usually the drives are named according to the partition label..if that is set
2009-08-06T18:17:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	i have that set, did that during install
2009-08-06T18:18:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	but like i said it only seems to be the root user that is getting that info
2009-08-06T18:19:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	hmm.. not sure why it would behave like that.. btw how do you start nautilus as root?
2009-08-06T18:20:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	in terminal type sudo nautulis
2009-08-06T18:21:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	not sure if that's the problem.. but you should *never* use sudo with gui apps..
2009-08-06T18:22:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	good to know I just use it from once in awhile to copy things that need root
2009-08-06T18:23:00.000Z	Slart	earthen	try starting it with gksudo instead.. see if that makes things better
2009-08-06T18:24:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	will do
2009-08-06T18:25:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	yeah thats the same the drive show up as windows
2009-08-06T18:26:00.000Z	earthen	Slart	like it shod
