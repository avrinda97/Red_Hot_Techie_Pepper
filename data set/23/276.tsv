2012-02-04T02:35:00.000Z	grubbyone		ok, lets say I zero out the entire drive, then install ubuntu server, then make a compressed dd image of the drive, how big will the image be? is there anything else I can do to make it smaller?
2012-02-04T02:37:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	the image will be the size of the drive, you can compress it after you've made it
2012-02-04T02:38:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	not going to happen with dd
2012-02-04T02:38:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	dd is block for block copy - white space or datsa
2012-02-04T02:38:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	dd will copy the zeros - zeros is data,
2012-02-04T02:39:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	you can compress it post creating the image, it will still be a big image
2012-02-04T02:39:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	nothing, you won't with dd
2012-02-04T02:40:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	dd is block for block copy, nothing will change that
2012-02-04T02:40:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	not using dd would be a method, however I don't believe in the "image" tools for linux
2012-02-04T02:40:00.000Z	grubbyone	ikonia	what to use then?
2012-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	grubbyone	ikonia	I want to put a full drive backup on a USB stick
2012-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	I don't make "images"
2012-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	how big is your drive ?
2012-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	grubbyone	ikonia	120GB
2012-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	how big is your usb ?
2012-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	grubbyone	ikonia	8GB
2012-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	that seems unlikly
2012-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	grubbyone	ikonia	why would 3 gigs of data+ 117GB of zeroes be more than 5GB compressed?
2012-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	because zeros is still data
2012-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	if you believe it will work, do it
2012-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	grubbyone	ikonia	I'm just looking for a solution
2012-02-04T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	grubbyone	you have found one, you think it will work, do it
2012-02-04T08:07:00.000Z	grubbyone	ikonia	my 120gig drive compressed to 500 megs btw
