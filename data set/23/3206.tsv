2008-06-20T03:11:00.000Z	slayton		Prose pick a file of a known size then transfer it while timing the transfer
2008-06-20T03:12:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	I guess but I would rather have some program tell me the same thing ;)
2008-06-20T03:12:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	you could try a verbose SCP I think it has a transfer rate bar thingy
2008-06-20T03:13:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	well actually, I am trying to understand why a PATA ultra-100 has transfer speeds of 10MB/s over LAN (no wi-fi)
2008-06-20T03:13:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	Yes it does, just get a big file, try scp -r <filename> <destination> and it should pop up a transfer gauge with the speed
2008-06-20T03:14:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	that yes it does was in reference to my earlier post not yours... sorry
2008-06-20T03:16:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	hmm nothing visual indicating transfer speed over ssh :(
2008-06-20T03:17:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	doing so
2008-06-20T03:17:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	-v will spit out a lot of text but in the end you will see a transfer bay
2008-06-20T03:18:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	nada when I tell it to verbose over ssh
2008-06-20T03:19:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	how big is the file your transfering?
2008-06-20T03:19:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	230MB
2008-06-20T03:19:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	how big is the file your transfering?
2008-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	http://pastebin.com/d480bfe9a
2008-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	it finisehd transferring and gave the prompt
2008-06-20T03:20:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	look in the bottom right, transfer rates show up
2008-06-20T03:21:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	well sorry I can't tell you more....
2008-06-20T03:21:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	I will try a 4GB file... maybe it needs more 'data' to have statistical pertinence
2008-06-20T03:22:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	thanks anyways :)
2008-06-20T03:22:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	ok good luck, I transfered a 240mb file and it showed up for me
2008-06-20T03:23:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	7.1 via ssh myself but I might plug a screen and see if local access does anything
2008-06-20T03:23:00.000Z	slayton	Prose	it shouldn't make a difference you get the same terminal output
2008-06-20T03:23:00.000Z	Prose	slayton	yeah you're probably right
