2010-03-18T22:16:00.000Z	Trek		how do you force grub to update in 9.10?  i know there's a update command for grub legacy
2010-03-18T22:17:00.000Z	Trek		!grub
2010-03-18T22:17:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	upate-grub I think is what you're looking for
2010-03-18T22:17:00.000Z	Trek	wjm	does that work with grub 2?
2010-03-18T22:17:00.000Z	wjm		affirmative
2010-03-18T22:18:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	it'll update with the kernel choices from /boot
2010-03-18T22:18:00.000Z	Trek	wjm	will it detect any other OS installs on other drives that are connected to the system?
2010-03-18T22:19:00.000Z	wjm		no it will only scan for them in /boot and update the menu.lst with the appropriate info
2010-03-18T22:19:00.000Z	Trek	wjm	then how can it manually be forced to recognize XP on a secondary drive>
2010-03-18T22:19:00.000Z	Trek		?
2010-03-18T22:20:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	fdisk -l
2010-03-18T22:20:00.000Z	wjm		find your Windows partition and thus set it up that way
2010-03-18T22:20:00.000Z	Trek		okay, then what gets updated manually?
2010-03-18T22:20:00.000Z	Trek		what files, wjm?
2010-03-18T22:21:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	It's kinda messy to do that read this - http://blogs.koolwal.net/2008/12/28/windows-xpvista-dual-boot-does-not-boot-from-grub2-or-grub-pc/
2010-03-18T22:22:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	as a rule, I personally don't mix linux/windows just because it can get mess
2010-03-18T22:22:00.000Z	Trek	wjm	messy is fine, Ubu's already messed enough upon install, I had to do chmod recursively on everything in my /home/ folder in order to edit .bashrc and others without using sudo
2010-03-18T22:22:00.000Z	Trek	wjm	i need win for iPod and Dreamweaver :P
2010-03-18T22:22:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	ok then those directions should be easy for you to understand if you know what you're doing (which it sounds like you do)
2010-03-18T22:23:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	my ipod works in Ubuntu? :(
2010-03-18T22:23:00.000Z	Trek	wjm	i use iPod Touch?
2010-03-18T22:23:00.000Z	wjm	Trek	not me, but my iphone and ipod work fine
