2004-11-22T10:40:00.000Z	eclipse		can someone tell how to upgrade XFree86 to X.org on ubuntu?
2004-11-22T10:41:00.000Z	eclipse		then apt-get install x.org?
2004-11-22T10:41:00.000Z	eclipse		it's ok
2004-11-22T10:42:00.000Z	eclipse		ok
2004-11-22T10:42:00.000Z	eclipse		really?
2004-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	eclipse		well, can i just upgrade x.org only?
2004-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	eclipse		reason i want to upgrade to x.org is because my animated cursors keep on flicking
2004-11-22T10:44:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	hoary is like 80% less unstable only
2004-11-22T10:41:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	remove from /etc/apt/sources.list everything that says warty to hoary
2004-11-22T10:41:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	apt-get update $$ apt-get dist-upgrade
2004-11-22T10:42:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	warning: you'll get as unstable as hell
2004-11-22T10:42:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	you will have even the gnome 2.9.1 which is buggy
2004-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	if you need something stable
2004-11-22T10:43:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	but if you don't need to have 100% stability then move to hoary
2004-11-22T10:44:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	but I'm in hoary without probs
2004-11-22T10:45:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	nope
2004-11-22T10:46:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	xorg is only obtained with hoary
2004-11-22T10:47:00.000Z	eclipse	kensai	i only want x.org not gnome 2.9.1
2004-11-22T10:49:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	well it is almost possible almost imposible
2004-11-22T10:49:00.000Z	eclipse	kensai	what do u mean?
2004-11-22T10:50:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	youll need to work more by doing it but you can do it
2004-11-22T10:51:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	anyways the only problem with the new gnome is that you need to log out and in again to emty trash
2004-11-22T10:53:00.000Z	kensai	eclipse	take what trey says
