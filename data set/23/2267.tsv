2009-09-01T19:06:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	do you have a lot of wifi traffic in your area?
2009-09-01T19:07:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	 yes...
2009-09-01T19:07:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	 does wifi interfere with bluetooth??
2009-09-01T19:08:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	yes. if there is enough wifi traffic, it can be crippling for bluetooth devices. wifi is a direct spread spectrum technology and bluetooth uses frequency hopping in the same frequency range
2009-09-01T19:09:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	if the different wifi networks are spread out enough over the different channels, bluetooth's hopping scheme is usually good enough to avoid service interruptions, but if there's lots of wifi networks positioned closely together over the whole spectrum, that causes a problem.
2009-09-01T19:10:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	also, there seems to be a bug filed in launchpad about this problem
2009-09-01T19:10:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	 well, the odd thing is that it seemed to work better when I was using a usb bluetooth dongle (never experienced lag),  but I bought an internal module for my laptop recently,  and that's when I noticed it..
2009-09-01T19:10:00.000Z	brassmaster		so it may be something that is specific to the bluez stack or your driver
2009-09-01T19:10:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	 so is it something that software can fix?  or is it a hard limitation?
2009-09-01T19:11:00.000Z	savid		hmm,  ok.
2009-09-01T19:13:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	can you send me the output of 'iwlist scanning'?
2009-09-01T19:14:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	http://dpaste.com/88192/
2009-09-01T19:15:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	yeah, it doesn't seem like wifi interference should be bad enough to cause that much of an impact on your mouse.
2009-09-01T19:15:00.000Z	brassmaster		what version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-09-01T19:15:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-09-01T19:16:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	jaunty
2009-09-01T19:17:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	in the launchpad ticket filed on this, the person filing the bug found that his problem was solved by upgrading to 9.10. I'm cautious to suggest that since it gave my roommate some problems, but if you really must use the wireless mouse, that's one option. Otherwise, if the bluetooth dongle worked better, maybe it's best to go back to that.
2009-09-01T19:19:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	 yeah saw that.   The only thing about the dongle is that it didn't re-connect my mouse after going to sleep :-P   oh well, I guess it's promising to hear its (possibly) fixed in 9.10
2009-09-01T19:20:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	yeah. sorry i couldn't be of more assistance.
2009-09-01T19:22:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	 hey no problem -- if anything you kept me from throwing my mouse across the room in frustration.
2009-09-01T19:22:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	lol. good to hear.
2009-09-01T19:23:00.000Z	savid	brassmaster	 I usually find it's more comforting when I can at least understand _why_ something's not working  :-)
2009-09-01T19:24:00.000Z	brassmaster	savid	ditto. supposedly this is a regression that's been around since 8.04. hopefully 9.10 will do the trick for you.
