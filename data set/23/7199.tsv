2007-01-09T12:59:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.200
2007-01-09T12:59:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	what is the problem?/
2007-01-09T13:00:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	PC -> Router -> Modem -> Internet ???
2007-01-09T13:01:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	make sure your router and modem are working
2007-01-09T13:01:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	what is router IP ?
2007-01-09T13:03:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	so you want to talk to the gateway?
2007-01-09T13:03:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	and it is on the sam switch/hub ?
2007-01-09T13:04:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	if so, what is the IP of the gateway
2007-01-09T13:04:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	sudo ifconfig eth0 172.19.42.2
2007-01-09T13:04:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	on the linux PC
2007-01-09T13:05:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	i assume this is a wired connection
2007-01-09T13:05:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	what is the error?
2007-01-09T13:06:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	dont do that yet
2007-01-09T13:06:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	i didnt tell you to do that
2007-01-09T13:06:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	no ifconfig
2007-01-09T13:06:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	did it make any errors?
2007-01-09T13:07:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	ping 172.19.42.1
2007-01-09T13:08:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	if your ip is set correctly and the gateway is really in that range, then you should be able to ping it
2007-01-09T13:08:00.000Z	khermans_	n0ne	this assumes the 172.19.42.2 and 172.19.42.1 interfaces are on the same switch
