2012-06-23T02:46:00.000Z	UNG		it says, that the device size is diffeent, then the volume size
2012-06-23T02:46:00.000Z	UNG		different*
2012-06-23T02:46:00.000Z	UNG		how can i do that?
2012-06-23T02:47:00.000Z	UNG		dd if=/dev/sda of=/some/where/myCurrentPbr.pbr bs=512 count=1 skip=63 i found this command, and i wondered what to tpy in the pbr directory

2012-06-23T02:48:00.000Z	UNG		or does it just copy the pbr into a file to a directory, that i just choose?
2012-06-23T02:49:00.000Z	L3top	UNG	if=Input "file"    of=output "file"
2012-06-23T02:52:00.000Z	L3top	UNG	I did not backread... but it is FUNDAMENTAL that you do not dd a partition/drive that is mounted
2012-06-23T02:52:00.000Z	UNG	L3top	no worries, gparted made sure, that i cant mount it now ;)
2012-06-23T03:01:00.000Z	L3top	UNG	sorry to backtrack, but can you tell me the original problem, and if you have run fsck?
2012-06-23T03:02:00.000Z	UNG	L3top	i did not run fsck, what does it do?
2012-06-23T03:02:00.000Z	L3top	UNG	fsck = file system check... but before that, tell me the original problem please
2012-06-23T03:04:00.000Z	UNG	L3top	well i tried to resize my ntfs partition, and I did, but with an error: Current NTFS volume size is bigger than the device size
2012-06-23T03:05:00.000Z	L3top	UNG	fsck probably is not the answer. I would try to run chkdsk from a win machine... but... this is a bit outside of my area... I don't deal with NTFS except for detection.
2012-06-23T03:06:00.000Z	UNG	L3top	ok, thanks for you trying to help :)
2012-06-23T03:06:00.000Z	L3top	UNG	chkdsk -f
2012-06-23T03:07:00.000Z	L3top	UNG	listen to Jordan_U... he is much more clever than I
2012-06-23T03:07:00.000Z	UNG	L3top	i tried that too, but it couldn't do that, because it said, that some proccess is using the disk, and it can't do anything
2012-06-23T03:07:00.000Z	UNG	L3top	ok
