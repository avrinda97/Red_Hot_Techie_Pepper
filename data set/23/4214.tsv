2007-10-11T13:09:00.000Z	Malcovich		I need somebody with some real wireless chops. I've been thru the online tutorials etc... Had an intermediate linux guy over to help. No luck. I've got an RaLink RT2561/RT61. Anyone?
2007-10-11T13:10:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	i have an rtsomething or other. i suggest you buy a gun and shoot yours. err. i mean, what exactly are you having problems with?
2007-10-11T13:10:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	Won't see the access points. Won't pull a dhcp ip address.
2007-10-11T13:15:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	you might want to take the easy road and go the ndiswrapper route, if you haven't given that a shot
2007-10-11T13:15:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	I have in fact tried that. Same results.
2007-10-11T13:16:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	I actually have another wireless card. A usb linksys. Can't get that one working either. Though that one can see the access points.
2007-10-11T13:16:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	is the linksys also a ralink?
2007-10-11T13:17:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	Don't think so. I can pop it in and see.
2007-10-11T13:18:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	Yeah. Apparently so do Airlink 101 ralinks.
2007-10-11T13:27:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	I'd see if there were drivers available on the manufacturer's website - they may be newer. the ones on my CD sucked.
2007-10-11T13:19:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	if it's any consolation, and you're willing to upgrade in about a week, 7.10 does seem to handle ralinks better. not great, but better. :
2007-10-11T13:19:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	did you try compiling the serialmonkey drivers > rt2x00.serialmonkey.com (.net?)
2007-10-11T13:20:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	No. I found them, moved on to ndis. I'm NEW on linux. Compiling and installing those drivers was over my head.
2007-10-11T13:20:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	was over mine, as well.
2007-10-11T13:23:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	 when you went the ndiswrapper route, did you try the older driver [9x/me]  if it was available? 2k/xp drivers failed for me? I wish I could say something USEFUL b/c I know how much it sucks :P
2007-10-11T13:24:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	I tried the only driver I had, which did not specify 98/xp/etc...
2007-10-11T13:25:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	did you get it from a CD or download from the maker's website?
2007-10-11T13:26:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	From the cd that came with the card. Kicking around for a while. If I had to guess, I'd say older, not newer.
2007-10-11T13:28:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	I went the whole ndis route before I discovered the rt61 driver was in Feisty. (Like I said, I'm new.) Abandoned it for the native one after that. You think the ndis might actually be a better bet?
2007-10-11T13:32:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	not having personal experience with that specific ralink chipset, i can't tell you. Getting my own ralink to work was a nightmare, and I was *this* close to selling it and looking for a 3rd adapter when i updated to the 7.10 beta and found my adapter "worked" out of the box. the native drivers for my chipset are just vile. i'm not sure if yours are better.
2007-10-11T13:34:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	Didn't post. Spent hours reading and trying stuff though. I'm starting to lean towards installing the Gutsy beta. :)
2007-10-11T13:36:00.000Z	Malcovich	riotkittie	That RutilT looks interesting.
2007-10-11T13:38:00.000Z	riotkittie	Malcovich	all you need to do is open a terminal and "sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall"  if you dont have them, or search for them synaptic. download, uncompress, switch to the directory, "sh configure" "make" "sudo checkinstall"  (you can "sudo make install" for the last step, but checkinstall will allow for easier removal of things compiled from source)
