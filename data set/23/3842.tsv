2009-01-21T03:58:00.000Z	SmokeyD		hey people. I still haven't solved the problem with login and permissions. somehow I don't have a+w on ~ and ~/.dmrc
2009-01-21T03:58:00.000Z	SmokeyD		but gnome still complains when logging in
2009-01-21T03:58:00.000Z	SmokeyD		I already created another user and login using that one, and it works fine
2009-01-21T03:59:00.000Z	SmokeyD		I tried to find -type f -exec chmod 644 '{}' \;
2009-01-21T03:59:00.000Z	SmokeyD		and the same with 755 for dirs, but no luch
2009-01-21T03:59:00.000Z	SmokeyD		I am really baffled what is wrong
2009-01-21T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	try sudo chown -R <username>:<username> /home/<username>
2009-01-21T04:02:00.000Z	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip	already did
2009-03-25T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	write a script to seqentially mount iso files and search the mount point recursively for the file
2009-03-25T18:11:00.000Z	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip	easier: find -name *.iso -exec isoinfo -l -i '{}' \;|grep somefilename
2009-03-25T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	that too
2010-03-19T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	HP have great Linux support
2010-03-19T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	look at the HPLIP site for supported printers and buy one of those
2010-03-19T15:27:00.000Z	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip	ok, cool, thanks
2010-03-19T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	find one you fancy then check cmopatibility, you can alos consult the hcl
2010-03-19T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	buying compatible stuff makes life smoooooth
2010-03-19T15:31:00.000Z	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip	thanks for the hcl. The thing with first finding a printer and then checking compatibility is that it takes so much time. I would rather find a list of compatible hardware (like hcl) and then choose one from there which I fancy.
2010-03-19T15:31:00.000Z	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip	but the HPLIP tip was a good one
2010-03-19T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	hp rock that way :)
2011-08-24T21:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	as long as the user is in the right group, it should work
2011-08-24T21:01:00.000Z	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip	in the desktop environment/nautilus, yes. But mount /dev/sdc1 doesn't work, and there is also no mountpoint for the memorystick in /media for instance
2011-08-24T21:03:00.000Z	SmokeyD	ActionParsnip	I guess nautilus and gnome do all sorts of magic things that the "mount" commandline tool doesn't do. I am wondering what nautilus/gnome are doing
2011-10-07T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD	~/.bashrc  is ran,its coded in bash script
