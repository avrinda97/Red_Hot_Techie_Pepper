2006-04-14T09:02:00.000Z	lorem		how much processor power do i really need to run ubuntu without noticing any sluggishness, mostly i want to be able to download with bittorrent and watch movis at the same time, and still be able to check email and browse the web
2006-04-14T09:04:00.000Z	lorem		  pahlooka:how much rams do you have
2006-04-14T09:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	what are your system stats? (RAM & CPU?)
2006-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	anything reasonably modern will run Ubuntu just fine. More RAM is always good, though :)
2006-04-14T09:07:00.000Z	lorem	Madpilot	what do you consider modern
2006-04-14T09:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	anything less than 2 years old - my own machine is just a bit over 2yrs old, tech-wise
2006-04-14T09:09:00.000Z	lorem	Madpilot	what is your processor?
2006-04-14T09:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	I've got an AMD XP-M 2500+, slightly overclocked to about 2.0Ghz
2006-04-14T09:10:00.000Z	lorem	Madpilot	and your happy with the performance?
2006-04-14T09:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	yes, as I said, ubuntu is faster than XP was on this machine, and actually getting *faster* with each new release of Ubuntu
2006-04-14T09:12:00.000Z	lorem	Madpilot	have you ever maxed out your cpu?
2006-04-14T09:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	it goes to 100% fairly regularly, never stays there for long - but Gnome itself hardly ever lags
2006-04-14T09:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	bittorrent doesn't take much processor/ram, really
2006-04-14T09:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	ouch - I've had up to five or six torrents going here, no problems at all
2006-04-14T09:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	hmm, not fast, but torrents usually aren't
2006-04-14T09:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	wow - I never clock anywhere near that high - not sure my broadband actually will do that sort of speed at all :P
2006-04-14T09:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	if you're just buying a tower (no new monitor, etc) probably no more than $500-600 USD (very roughly)
2006-04-14T09:25:00.000Z	lorem	Madpilot	for that price what would you recommend
2006-04-14T09:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	I'm not really sure - it's been a year since I bought my system, and a year is a long, long time for computer tech :P
2006-04-14T09:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	start googling for hardware review sites, and checking places like new egg and other online retailers
2006-04-14T09:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	no, but most hardware runs Linux just fine - just be careful with things like wireless & printers
2006-04-14T09:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	benchmarks are benchmarks, and there are also some very good Linux-specific hardware sites - linuxprinting.org, for example
2006-04-14T09:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	lorem	the good review sites - Tom's Hardware, say - give you enough detail to compare things fairly well
