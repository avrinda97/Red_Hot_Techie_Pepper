2009-07-24T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	should be able to add Fedora    gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-24T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	are you dual booting  Fedora and Ubuntu, or do you have Windows on there as well or something?
2009-07-24T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	well any way with enough RAM you can do other  distros in virtual machine
2009-07-24T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	how much RAM do you have?
2009-07-24T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	ok  well dual booting is sucky, how about  picking a distro,  Ubuntu or Fedora,   Fedora :)   and  putting that on as host, and virtual maching the other
2009-07-24T05:02:00.000Z	faryshta	sebsebseb	I wanna try to learn as much distros as I can, besides I have a /home partition so the configuration is not an issue.
2009-07-24T05:03:00.000Z	faryshta	sebsebseb	thanks for the suggestion.
2009-07-24T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	as much distros as you can, so virtual machines make sense :)
2009-07-24T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	having to psyically install each time you want to try another distro, that really does suck
2009-07-24T05:04:00.000Z	faryshta	sebsebseb	thunar and gnome-monitor manager can't find the partitions were I have fedora. :(
2009-07-24T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	virtualizaton is better :)
2009-07-24T05:07:00.000Z	faryshta	sebsebseb	I don't wanna run virtual, I wanna feel thee all distro.
2009-07-24T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	I think your issue is, because  Fedora uses LVM, and Ubuntu don't, and  now  Ubuntu's  Grub  can't find your Fedora install
2009-07-24T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	webpidgeon may be able to help you,  since he uses Ubuntu and Fedora,   and setting up to many partitions for some crazy  multiboot  which  ActionParsnip is suggesting, I really don't think is that great an idea
2009-07-24T05:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	normalley  ActionParnsip is pretty good at giving people advice, but I am not so sure about this time,  also  you have alreayd expereinced Grub  not working as you would have liked,  because you can't boot up Fedora right now,  and oh yes if you put to many distros on, you can get some right issues with Grub in the future
2009-07-24T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	well I got someone to join the channel,  that may be able to help you boot up  Fedora  as well as Ubuntu again,  but then you got confused by  actionparsnip 's multiboot talk hmm
2009-07-24T05:18:00.000Z	faryshta	sebsebseb	I am already talking with webpigeon
2009-07-24T05:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	faryshta	oh pm ah ok, good
2009-07-24T05:22:00.000Z	faryshta	sebsebseb	ActionParsnip, no actually first I had Ubuntu, then installed Fedora and re-formated the Ubuntu partition (upgrades are boring).
