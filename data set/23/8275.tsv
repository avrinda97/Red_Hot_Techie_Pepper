2005-04-11T10:05:00.000Z	geppy		Anyone in here know of a command-line tool that can ascertain the length of an audio file in milliseconds?
2005-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	calc	geppy	sox might be able to
2005-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	calc		depends on the audio type though
2005-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	geppy		I looked in the man page, but couldn't find out how.
2005-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	calc		xiph has a tool for ogg vorbis files
2005-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	geppy		I can convert between audio types, that's no problem.
2005-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	geppy		I'd be interested in both sox and this xiph tool;  could I have more information on either?
2005-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	calc		iirc for xiph its called ogginfo
2005-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	geppy	calc	 ooh, fantastic!
2005-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	geppy	calc	Thanks!
2005-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	calc		yea it does eg 71m:51.955s
2005-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	geppy		Yeah. =)
2005-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	geppy		What would be the syntax for sox?
2005-04-11T10:08:00.000Z	calc		not sure about sox, i was just guessing that there is some way to extract the info from it
2005-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	calc		if you know the format and container overhead you can calculate the length of wav files as well
2005-04-11T10:11:00.000Z	calc		i think sox stat might tell you
2005-04-11T10:12:00.000Z	calc		yea it tells you length
2005-04-11T10:12:00.000Z	calc	geppy	use sox filename -e stat
2005-04-11T10:12:00.000Z	calc		cd
2005-04-11T10:12:00.000Z	calc		oops
2005-04-11T10:12:00.000Z	geppy	calc	Thanks!
2005-04-11T10:13:00.000Z	calc	geppy	that also works for ogg files
2005-04-11T10:13:00.000Z	geppy	calc	_Much_ thanks! =D
