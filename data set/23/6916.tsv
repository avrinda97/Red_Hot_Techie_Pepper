2005-12-02T13:59:00.000Z	krak`nix		where can i find asound.conf ?
2005-12-02T13:59:00.000Z	krak`nix		i dont see one in /etc
2005-12-02T13:59:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	we don't create one by default, nor should you
2005-12-02T14:00:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	nothing. You just need to install alsa-oss.
2005-12-02T14:02:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	specify a device explicitly, like plughw:0,0
2005-12-02T14:03:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	you'll need to consult the q4 Linux documentation for the precise syntax
2005-12-02T14:06:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	what were you using prior to plughw:0,0 ?
2005-12-02T14:07:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	what about hw:0,0 ?
2005-12-02T14:08:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	probably not going to have much luck there, but I can't confirm since I don't own a copy of q4
2005-12-02T14:11:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	ok, try hw:0 then
2005-12-02T14:15:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	yes, what do you need?
2005-12-02T14:16:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	don't do that
2005-12-02T14:16:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	that's the soname, and it doesn't exist because @2@ is the version in the alsa-lib that we ship
2005-12-02T14:17:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	pastebin the output from ''cat /proc/asound/devices''
2005-12-02T14:18:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	cat /proc/asound/cards
2005-12-02T14:19:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	what type of audio abberations do you hear?
2005-12-02T14:20:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	is there a parameter for specifying the buffer or period size?
2005-12-02T14:21:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	brb, need to restart wpa_supplicant
2005-12-02T14:25:00.000Z	krak`nix	crimsun	http://sial.org/pbot/14579
2005-12-02T14:27:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	are there any posts in the Linux q4 forums?
2005-12-02T14:30:00.000Z	krak`nix	crimsun	what do you think of this
2005-12-02T14:31:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	absolutely not
2005-12-02T14:31:00.000Z	crimsun	krak`nix	openal is library and is completely different from alsa-lib
