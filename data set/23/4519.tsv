2007-08-02T15:24:00.000Z	Xenoie		what type of device it is?
2007-08-02T15:24:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	it's a USB flash drive
2007-08-02T15:25:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	how can i do it manually?
2007-08-02T15:27:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	you mean I have to find if a new sda device pops up in /dev/ and then try mount /dev/thatdevice?
2007-08-02T15:27:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	I don't think I saw any new things appear in there but I can try it again
2007-08-02T15:30:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	that's a lot of output... I should grep that by sdX you say?
2007-08-02T15:31:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	dmesg | grep sd   is empty
2007-08-02T15:32:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	oh... it's how many seconds of logs?  lol... lemme try unplugging and repluggin :-)
2007-08-02T15:33:00.000Z	Xenoie	hendrixski	you can clear dmesg with dmesg -c, unplug and replugin the device and look to see if anything is logged there for it
2007-08-02T15:35:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	I did dmesg -c then plugged it in and ran dmesg and it's blank
2007-08-02T15:36:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	 yeah sounds like it.... it does mount when I reboot.. it's very strange
2007-08-02T15:37:00.000Z	Xenoie	hendrixski	you could reboot and let it mount to see what it is being mounted as
2007-08-02T15:38:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	when it mounts it gets the name I gave the drive:  "NAKED"  :-p
2007-08-02T15:41:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	Ok... so when I reboot I'll look at that.. then when I know what it actually mounts at .... then when I come across this problem again I'll just try mount /dev/whever/it/mounted/last/time
2007-08-02T15:42:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	thanks
2007-08-02T15:43:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	you know what I think it is... I think this happens only after I hibernate
2007-08-02T15:44:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	it could be that the usb is just not waking up... do you know if there's a way to test that theory?
2007-08-02T15:44:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	oh... right.. lol
2007-08-02T15:45:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	so assuming that is the case... is there a way to wake it up manually if it didn't wake up from hybernate?
2007-08-02T15:46:00.000Z	Xenoie	hendrixski	 the only think i can think of would be to reload the kernel module that is providing support for your USB chip
2007-08-02T15:47:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	hhmm  that may be just as much work as rebooting,
2007-08-02T15:48:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	Ok.  well, I'll test out the hybernation theory, and I'll look at where it mounts
2007-08-02T15:48:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xenoie	thanks :-)
