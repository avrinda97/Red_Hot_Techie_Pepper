2007-12-29T04:32:00.000Z	ryanov		Does anyone here happen to know why flashplugin-nonfree with Flash 9.0.115 was removed?
2007-12-29T04:33:00.000Z	ryanov		I see that it was pulled from the repository by Martin Pitt, but the reason given was (broken SRU)... not sure what that stands for.
2007-12-29T04:34:00.000Z	ryanov		Isn't the limit 3.3 or something like that with 32-bit, or is that Windows only?
2007-12-29T04:35:00.000Z	ryanov		What's the reason for sticking to 32 anyway?

2007-12-29T04:41:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	What HW?
2007-12-29T04:42:00.000Z	Tallen	ryanov	this pastebin has all alot of details about my issue -> http://www.pastebin.org/13242
2007-12-29T04:45:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	Interesting.
2007-12-29T04:48:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	Assuming you haven't tried going with a PAE kernel
2007-12-29T04:49:00.000Z	Tallen	ryanov	how exactly would I do that? what are any pitfalls of such a kernel?
2007-12-29T04:49:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	No idea, I just generally listen to the kernel messages if they tell me to try something. :
2007-12-29T04:49:00.000Z	Tallen	ryanov	well I saw that , but I am not using more than 4GB so I didnt think it applied.
2007-12-29T04:51:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	The fact that it mentioned it is interesting, though... I'm not sure what causes it to print that message.
2007-12-29T04:52:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	Mine does not bitch about that, but I only have 1024MB
2007-12-29T04:53:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	Similar, but below 4GB also: http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2003-07/0995.html
2007-12-29T04:57:00.000Z	Tallen	ryanov	aha http://osdir.com/ml/admin.managers/2005-07/msg00005.html
2007-12-29T04:57:00.000Z	Tallen	ryanov	so I guess I need to make a custom kernel now. well that should be fun.
2007-12-29T04:59:00.000Z	Tallen	ryanov	wonder if the 'server' ubuntu kernel has this PAE enabled?
2007-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	Someone said that earlier.

2007-12-29T05:01:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	Discussion of what's different.
2007-12-29T05:03:00.000Z	ryanov	Tallen	I'm out, but good luck.
2007-12-29T05:03:00.000Z	Tallen	ryanov	thanks.
