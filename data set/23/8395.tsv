2004-09-27T06:17:00.000Z	Qerub		Is someone gonna provide some space for community driven KDE support in Ubuntu?
2004-09-27T06:17:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	yes; I'm not sure we can give you a timeline yet, but that's very much the plan
2004-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Great. I'm right that KDE is currently excluded, even in the "unsupported" repository?
2004-09-27T06:19:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Am I*
2004-09-27T06:20:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	the source is in universe, but I believe there was some build problem, and generally up to now we've been ignoring build problems in universe
2004-09-27T06:20:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	it's an issue for people, though, so somebody is looking at it ...
2004-09-27T06:21:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Sounds fair enough :)
2004-09-27T06:33:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	it's already tuned for p4 ...
2004-09-27T06:34:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Oh. I haven't seen that information anywhere.
2004-09-27T12:05:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	If the community does a good work, will Ubuntu provide KDE as an alternative DE in the installation phase?
2004-09-27T12:06:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	I'm not sure what'll happen w.r.t. installation for things like Kubuntu
2004-09-27T12:06:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	I think the plan is more to have the KDE-interested guys ship a separate CD
2004-09-27T12:06:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Does something named Kubuntu exist or are you just making fun of me? :)
2004-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Sounds better, yes.
2004-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	not yet, we named it a while back anyway ;)
2004-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Is Kubuntu something Canonical staff will do? :)
2004-09-27T12:08:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	unlikely; we'll be creating infrastructure for that sort of thing in general, but KDE support is expected to be community-provided
2004-09-27T12:09:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.
2004-09-27T12:09:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Ubuntu's "snapshots" of Debian is pretty much what the Debian Desktop Distribution is doing/going to do.
2004-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	sort of the same angle but a different approach
2004-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	Hows is the approach different? Except the focus on some selected packages.
2004-09-30T08:46:00.000Z	Kamion	Qerub	please report that to the qemu developers
2004-09-30T08:47:00.000Z	Qerub	Kamion	I know it has nothing to do with Ubuntu, just looking for someone with the same experience. And sure, I'll do that.
