2009-10-31T04:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	while IFS=' ' read -r file do; command "$file" ; done << file_with_filenames
2009-10-31T04:03:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	there wouldnt be a simpler way like command echo$textfile commandoptions?
2009-10-31T04:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	well i did the hard part for you ;P
2009-10-31T04:07:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	so lets say i make a text file that contains only -a . . . there is no way to type at the bash line: ls (insert text file contents here)
2009-10-31T04:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	which line ? is the file allways a one liner ?
2009-10-31T04:08:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	in that case it is producing ls -a
2009-10-31T04:08:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	the file is one line right now already
2009-10-31T04:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	you want to execute commands stored on a text file ?
2009-10-31T04:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	was not a file with filenames ?
2009-10-31T04:10:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	i have a textfile right now that has the name of textfiles separated by a space all on one line
2009-10-31T04:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	ok then do as i said. is the safe way to do things
2009-10-31T04:10:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	i just want to be able to type at bash command line:  cat (insert content of text file) > file
2009-10-31T04:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	what does (insert content of text file) exactly means ? cat file1 file2 > file3 do just that...
2009-10-31T04:12:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	a simple example was the one i just did of producing ls -a . . . you have textfile that contains the text ¨-a¨
2009-10-31T04:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	ls "$(cat file_with_-a_inside)" ??
2009-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	that might work let me try
2009-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	you are doing very wrong thisngs if you want to store options in textfile
2009-10-31T04:16:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	that was a simple example . . . i have 300 pdf pages that im trying to use pdftk with to generate one pdf
2009-10-31T04:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	what was wrong with « pdftk 00*.pdf cat output output_file.pdf » ??
2009-10-31T04:24:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	hmmm yep that works too
2009-10-31T04:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	mom	it is right there in the pdftk webpage ;)
2009-10-31T04:25:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	ive been reading about bash and was thinking of > that i just learned
2009-10-31T05:05:00.000Z	mom	erUSUL	fyi you can do ls $(< textfile) too
