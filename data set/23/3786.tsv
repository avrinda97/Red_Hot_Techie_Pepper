2008-03-06T04:34:00.000Z	Sakkath		i have a microsoft usb wireless mouse taht has worked on every distro of linux i've tried so far.... but it doesn't work on kubuntu! lsusb shows it, and it's def not the port since it lights up (the receiver). also i can't find gpm? it says something refers to it but it has no candidates (apt-get install gpm)
2008-03-06T04:36:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- your apt-get problem sounds like you need to enable a repository - check you have the universe repository enabled
2008-03-06T04:37:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	thanks for response. it IS only the install cd though. taht might be why. that's just a help, but not even a lil' bit required. i'd much rather know why this mouse isn't working. the device is set to /dev/input/mice in xorg.conf, the default; i see no reason this shouldn't work as it has on many other distros
2008-03-06T04:41:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- check you have the modules psmouse usbcore and uhci_hcd in your kernel modules list. check by typing lsmod in a terminal and searching through or grep them ie lsmod | grep psmouse etc
2008-03-06T04:43:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	they are all loaded.
2008-03-06T04:47:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- type sudo cat /dev/input/mice and press return. move your mouse about and see if you get anything turn up on the screen
2008-03-06T04:47:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	will do, thanks
2008-03-06T04:48:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	nothing :(
2008-03-06T04:53:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- also check you have the module ehci_hcd loaded ie lsmod | grep ehci
2008-03-06T04:53:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	i do
2008-03-06T04:55:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	what i don't get... appears right in lsusb. the receiver obv. gets power, is lit up. mouse/receiver definitley work
2008-03-06T04:57:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- does you mouse work using the live cd?
2008-03-06T04:58:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	this is the livecd. i'm trying to install it
2008-03-06T05:01:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	maybe it's just this pc. maybe the board/usb port. it gets power, yes, but that doesn't mean data. when i say it works, even w/linux, it was never on this box before.
2008-03-06T05:01:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- ahh ok - sorry your problem has me beat - i have a wireless usb mouse on my system and that works fine.... fraid i've kinda run out of ideas on that one
2008-03-06T05:01:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- that may be the case :(
2008-03-06T05:01:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	maybe another port... before i grab a new mouse/try w/same ubuntu cd on another box
2008-03-06T05:07:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- just a quick one - do you have usbmouse in the output of lsmod ie does lsmod | grep usbmouse show up? if not try sudo modprobe usbmouse
2008-03-06T05:08:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	no, it was not loaded by default. seems to make no difference though.
2008-03-06T05:08:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- do you have usbhid module loaded too?
2008-03-06T05:09:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	yes
2008-03-06T05:09:00.000Z	danand	Sakkath	- ok, well ...it was worth a go :)
2008-03-06T05:09:00.000Z	Sakkath	danand	thanks.
