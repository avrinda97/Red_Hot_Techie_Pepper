2009-07-30T06:57:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	So, the pressure's on, eh?
2009-07-30T06:57:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	naw  :)  Just a good opportunity for me to learn  :)
2009-07-30T06:59:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	I've never heard of that - does it mean no network card?
2009-07-30T06:59:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	deexannihilate, not sure what the error message means.  Googling...
2009-07-30T07:10:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	I wonder if the network cable has anything to do with the error - perhaps its a crossover cable?
2009-07-30T07:10:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	That's where I was about to go
2009-07-30T07:18:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	what do you think?
2009-07-30T07:18:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	I would try unplugging the cable from the notebook and plugging it into the desktop first.
2009-07-30T07:19:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	we know the desktop is working, so that would tell us if the cable is okay.
2009-07-30T07:19:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	that makes sense  :)
2009-07-30T07:19:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	Once we know the cable is okay, then we know the problem is definitely on the notebook.
2009-07-30T07:21:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	deexannihilate1 wow!
2009-07-30T07:23:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	thanks for all the great help :)
2009-07-30T07:33:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	I think deexannihilate is trying to get connectivity so he can install a fix for his wireless

2009-07-30T07:53:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	Yes.  But I just want to make sure we're implementing the right solution.
2009-07-30T08:09:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	what key phrase did you search for to find this solution?
2009-07-30T08:10:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	acer asire one linux ethernet  I think
2009-07-30T08:11:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	we lost her...
2009-07-30T08:31:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	thanks for all the help
2009-07-30T08:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	I didn't think about checking the logs until a few minutes ago.
2009-07-30T08:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	inx-mdg	I guess I'll have to turn in my linux+ cert.
2009-07-30T08:32:00.000Z	inx-mdg	dsnyders	I didn't know to check the logs...
