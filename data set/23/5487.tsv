2007-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	grndslm		*does a better torrent client exist than ktorrent?*  (I'm starting to wonder if a switch to KDE would make sense considering I'm starting to find that apps like KTorrent, Amarok, and K3b are unbeatable)
2007-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	azureus? if you have the memory and resources
2007-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 sorry, no java apps allowed on my machine unless it's the only option
2007-03-02T17:43:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	utorrent through wine? =)
2007-03-02T17:46:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 have you personally used utorrent on wine?
2007-03-02T17:46:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	nope.. I've used it when I had windows on the box.. and I've seen screenshots and such.. apparently it works
2007-03-02T17:47:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	I use azureus myself
2007-03-02T17:47:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 I'm wondering if i should download the standalone program, or the installation version of utorrent?  the standalone version doesn't quite work
2007-03-02T17:47:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	I don't think there is much of a difference
2007-03-02T17:48:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	get the standalone version.. it's only a small exe file.. I think you can run it in install-mode to make it create shortcuts and such
2007-03-02T17:49:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 i tried, but all I can see is the window border/frame
2007-03-02T17:49:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	what version of wine? I'll give it a try
2007-03-02T17:49:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 0.9.30
2007-03-02T17:51:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	works here.. on wine 9.31
2007-03-02T17:53:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 I don't get it...there's no real configuration for wine is there??
2007-03-02T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	there's winecfg.. but that's about it
2007-03-02T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	but try updating.. 0.9.30 was a bit dodgy
2007-03-02T06:19:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 hah...i'm not sure if it was the new version of wine...but i just realized that uTorrent startes minimized, that's why i couldn't see it!!  wine's pretty sweet
2007-03-02T06:20:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	hehe.. nice.. so.. you have a small, nice torrent client =)
2007-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	grndslm	Slart	 I'll prolly end up sticking with ktorrent...but it's nice that i know wine works!  if i wanted to launch utorrent, the launch command would be "wine /opt/utorrent.exe"???
2007-03-02T06:23:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	yup. that sounds right
2008-02-09T20:10:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	I think he left.. well well.. he'll be back I suppose =)
2009-01-19T21:06:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm	I think that's what "sudo apt-get install" does.. not sure though but try it
