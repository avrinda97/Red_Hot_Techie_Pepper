2008-10-28T11:26:00.000Z	frogscott		can anyone answer this? Mozilla crashes on any video played I have installed flash 10
2008-10-28T11:26:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	flash?
2008-10-28T11:26:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	try installing flashblock
2008-10-28T11:26:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	a FF plugin
2008-10-28T11:27:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	that is what it is aimed at; it blocks them until you choose to play them
2008-10-28T11:28:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	ok let me see
2008-10-28T11:31:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	that didnt do anything except temporarily block it..once i watch it does the same thing
2008-10-28T11:33:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	could it be something in synaptic left over from libflash or flashplugin?
2008-10-28T11:33:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	how did you install flash
2008-10-28T11:33:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	and which version of flash is it
2008-10-28T11:34:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	 I uninstalled flashplugin and then went to adobe to get 10 for Ubuntu
2008-10-28T11:35:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	I do not have flashplugin non-free installed but some of the libflash things are still there
2008-10-28T11:35:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	well since you went outside of the package manager there is no telling what conflicts there are
2008-10-28T11:36:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	sweet but this happened before that
2008-10-28T11:36:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	so no way to tell what the conflicts are.
2008-10-28T11:37:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	um can I just uninstall some things and reinstall everything?
2008-10-28T11:37:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	sure
2008-10-28T11:37:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	lol
2008-10-28T11:45:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	if i want to remove pulse audio and i remove my desktop how do I put my desktop back after?
2008-10-28T11:46:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	switch to alsa in sound preferences; that may be one source of trouble
2008-10-28T11:46:00.000Z	bazhang_	frogscott	also set vlc or other apps to use alsa and not pulse
2008-10-28T11:46:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	yes I think it is but how can I get rid of pulse?
2008-10-28T11:53:00.000Z	frogscott	bazhang_	yes I think it is but how can I get rid of pulse?
