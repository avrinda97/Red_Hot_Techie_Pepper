2010-10-14T04:47:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	you're talking about the netboox remix right? I'm trying to do that. I can't pin anything.
2010-10-14T04:48:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	right. thats what im using. The option has actually appeared now though! It'd be nice if there was a way to reorder the icons though . . .
2010-10-14T04:49:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	you can reorder them, drag the icon strait out and move it
2010-10-14T04:49:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	ah nice!
2010-10-14T04:49:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	if you drag it tooo far away the icon will be deleted !
2010-10-14T04:49:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	ohnoes!
2010-10-14T04:50:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	although a little slow and a little buggy, I'm loving unity.
2010-10-14T04:50:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	mee tooo :D defiantly buggy
2010-10-14T04:51:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	but well designed overall. Sidebar needs autohide though. . .
2010-10-14T04:51:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	can't wait until tabs touch the very top, ex. in chrome for 11.04
2010-10-14T04:51:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	ah, 11.04 is adding support for non-standard window decorations?
2010-10-14T04:51:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	wouldn't tabs touching the top cover battery indicator, etc.?
2010-10-14T04:52:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	at least i remember mark saying something similar, i'll hold him to it. The top right would fade over it some how....
2010-10-14T04:52:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	Mark as in Mark Shuttleworth?
2010-10-14T04:52:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	yep
2010-10-14T04:53:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	Is he a friend of yours, or he said it in some public statement?
2010-10-14T04:53:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	i wish i knew him better, it was just from a mailing list :p
2010-10-14T04:53:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	psh, I was going to ask you to ask him if he could lend me some money :-P
2010-10-14T04:54:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	have you found any chrome themes that are a good match for the 10.10/unity theme?
2010-10-14T04:55:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	well i don't really user the clean themes i just use the designer ones, vincent at the moment from the google themes
2010-10-14T04:56:00.000Z	liquidmeson	rockets	vince*
2010-10-14T04:57:00.000Z	rockets	liquidmeson	this theme seems like a great match, if you're interested: http://j.mp/bbMiW7
