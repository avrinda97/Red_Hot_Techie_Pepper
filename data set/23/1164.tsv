2010-08-02T09:14:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	don't know, just ever since the upgrade to lucid all my drives whether they have labels or not are being mounted via UUID
2010-08-02T09:09:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	dont know how to fix offhand. something new they added
2010-08-02T09:10:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	i figured, just sick of disks mounting as /media/UUID instead of /media/disk or /media/label
2010-08-02T09:10:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	you install or cd boot?
2010-08-02T09:10:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	full install should show you the lable, but the liveCD shows you /media/asbe98skjhsd87
2010-08-02T09:11:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	i have determined that /dev/disk/by-label isn't being generated
2010-08-02T09:11:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	full install
2010-08-02T09:12:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	hrm odd. i know off the cd or frugal install, it mounts them like that, but after install it mounts my ntfs drives by lable
2010-08-02T09:14:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	did you look at the disk in disk manager, just to double check it has a lable?
2010-08-02T09:15:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	nope, if it isn't being generated by udev in /dev/disk what would the point be? :)
2010-08-02T09:15:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	ah. might have something to do with upgrading versus an install and import
2010-08-02T09:17:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	updates work fine, by i try to stick away from revision upgrades. some reason they dont always go as planned and give problems i can never figure out.
2010-08-02T09:17:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	i thought that...i know at least on intrepid live cd (which is the last disc i burned live cd wise) it will mount properly
2010-08-02T09:18:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	heh i know what you mean but i've always been able to fix any quirks that crop up....been dist upgrading since breezy
2010-08-02T09:20:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	hey figure this out, insert a dvd that has a label and it works
2010-08-02T09:21:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	plug up a usb stick or external drive with labels and it chokes and falls back to UUID
2010-08-02T09:21:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	that is odd
2010-08-02T09:21:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	you're telling me
2010-08-02T09:22:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	if automount, assume fs=iso9660 lol
2010-08-02T09:22:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	almost seems like its a udev rule, which i can't recall if i'm missing rules or not
2010-08-02T09:22:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	yeah really
2010-08-02T09:23:00.000Z	Wiesshund	kmyst	cant say there, ive never had much reason to set rules for udev on my own pc's
2010-08-02T09:24:00.000Z	kmyst	Wiesshund	i've had a few occasions i needed to...but i meant i can't recall whethere i had more than 4 rules which i think back a few dist updgrades i did have a good number of them meaning they got nuked
