2010-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	Xae		with ubuntu on it
2010-09-20T12:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	Windows version of Flash is known to be faster than the Linux/Mac OS X version
2010-09-20T12:57:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	flash aint an issue anymore..
2010-09-20T12:57:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	what is it now
2010-09-20T12:57:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	what kind of slow?  graphics? cpu? memory?  (i doubt the later 2 though)
2010-09-20T12:58:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	what video card do you have and what video driver you are using
2010-09-20T12:58:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	slow start of apps, etc.
2010-09-20T12:58:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	dunno, it's an intel card, Toshiba Satellite L10-154
2010-09-20T13:05:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	Intel Corporation 82852/855GM
2010-09-20T13:07:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	something is keeping my cpu @ 99,9%
2010-09-20T13:08:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	run  "top" command and see what it is
2010-09-20T13:11:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	http://pastebin.com/BLxs5iUe
2010-09-20T13:13:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	the top seems fine
2010-09-20T13:13:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	80%..
2010-09-20T13:13:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	i suppose it is just Flash or a complex webpage
2010-09-20T13:13:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	even without flash, ubuntu is slow as hall
2010-09-20T13:13:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	don't forget it is just a Celeron M @1.4Ghz..
2010-09-20T13:14:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	my laptop used to run way faster on linux
2010-09-20T13:14:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	look at the CPU usage. it is 52% chromium,  12% X (graphics) 11% pulseaudio(audio)
2010-09-20T13:15:00.000Z	icarus-c	Xae	moreover, with Linux even 100% cpu wouldn't feel slow
2010-09-20T13:15:00.000Z	Xae	icarus-c	linux is slow as hell :|
