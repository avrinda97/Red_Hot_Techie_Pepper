2007-11-16T22:04:00.000Z	jsschmid1		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2007-11-16T22:04:00.000Z	jsschmid1		is only available from another source
2007-11-16T22:05:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	try sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic , that should pull the right headers as dependency.
2007-11-16T22:06:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	it might be that your sources.list is screwed. get afresh one at !easysource then , and sudo apt.get update afterwards
2007-11-16T22:07:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	than it says: linux-headers-generic is already the newest version. ... I mean the headers are present in the directory of my old kernel, but in the new one they are not
2007-11-16T22:09:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	look in /usr/src . is there a linux-headers-2.6.20-16 dir ?
2007-11-16T22:10:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	: no, just two for the previous kernel (normal / generic )
2007-11-16T22:24:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	think twice if you really want to upgrade. I'm quite suspicious you broke your conf already by use of automatix or some other 'helper'-script, so you have a pretty high chance to hose your install in the process. And IMHO gutsy is quite pointless for the majority of users
2007-11-16T22:26:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	the only thing is that i included some source repos
2007-11-16T22:26:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	but  didnt use automatix or something like
2007-11-16T22:27:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	so did you regenerate your sources.list and apt-get update 'd ?
2007-11-16T22:27:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	but take my word. you're going to regret the upgrade, so make a backup first
2007-11-16T22:29:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	lsb_release says anyway that I am already gutsy
2007-11-16T22:29:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	huh ?
2007-11-16T22:30:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	is my kernel 2.6.20-16-generic the current kernel for gutsy?
2007-11-16T22:31:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	no, that's the feisty kernel. and using the feisty kernel with gutsy results in quite a couple of issues
2007-11-16T22:33:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	 so how could this happen and how can I fix it?
2007-11-16T22:35:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	i don't know what you did, so i can't tell what happened. My suggestion would be to make a backup and do clean reinstall of feisty (prolly a netinstall with the minimal .iso), so you don't need to upgrade after install, but have immediatly all the latest (feisty-)packages installed
2007-11-16T22:46:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	 what I did is installing via USB stick and netinstall, because my laptop hasn't got a CDROM. After that I updated because of the more comfortable Bluetooth support. I didn't find an option to install gutsy directly with the netinstall
2007-11-16T22:46:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	is it possible to upgrade the kernel on it's own?
2007-11-16T22:48:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	so you did a gutsy netinstall with a feisty installer... hmmm, i wonder that it worked at all. Man, don't screw around with that unclean state. Start over with a clean gutsy installation medium
2007-11-16T23:00:00.000Z	jsschmid1	stefg	i did a feity install with a feisty installer (netinstall) and upgraded to gutsy. So usally it should work... Where can I find the gutsy netisntaller? on the .ISO? Because I have to build a bootable USB key 'cause I dont have a CDROM...
2007-11-16T23:01:00.000Z	stefg	jsschmid1	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation has some tricks for you
