2005-12-22T15:06:00.000Z	nubuntu		"Qt installation not detected.
2005-12-22T15:06:00.000Z	nubuntu		Set $QTDIR correctly and reru" - What would be right path here? /usr/local/qt3 ?
2005-12-22T15:06:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	where is this happening?
2005-12-22T15:07:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	installing Exscalibar
2005-12-22T15:07:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	since i don't know what it is -- do you actually mean installing, or *compiling*?
2005-12-22T15:08:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	compiling I guess :) sorry, but setting path, doesnt help. Same response
2005-12-22T15:08:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	is it a KDE program or just a QT program?
2005-12-22T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	try installing libqt3-mt-dev, or kdelibs4-dev
2005-12-22T15:09:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	think I got those actually...
2005-12-22T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	well, be very sure you do before going mad trying to compile... "apt-cache policy libqt3-mt-dev" will tell you if it's really installed
2005-12-22T15:11:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	off course Im sure. Not going mad, only almost :)
2005-12-22T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	would you give me a link to the archive you're trying to compile so i can try as well?
2005-12-22T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	thanks
2005-12-22T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	try "export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3"
2005-12-22T15:19:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	thanks!
2005-12-22T15:19:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	jackpot! :)
2005-12-22T15:19:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	i can confirm it compiles with QTDIR set to /usr/lib/qt3. don't know why it doesn't work "out of the box", that's a very strange configure script they're using
2005-12-22T15:20:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	your the master
2005-12-22T15:32:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	did you successfully compile that program? At make, I get "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsndfile
2005-12-22T15:32:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	i get that too, but then i didn't install libsoundfile, i stopped after i saw the QT part worked
2005-12-22T15:33:00.000Z	nubuntu	LjL	so installing libsoundfile then
2005-12-22T15:33:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	you need either libsndfile0-dev or libsndfile1-dev, not sure which one yet
2005-12-22T15:34:00.000Z	LjL	nubuntu	libsndfile1-dev is ok
