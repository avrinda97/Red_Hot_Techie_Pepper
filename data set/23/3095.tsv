2008-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	dynoll3		i need help plz
2008-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	dynoll3		how we active ubuntu manualy?
2008-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	dynoll3		sorry not ubuntu
2008-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	dynoll3		compiz fusion
2008-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	in a terminal: compiz --replace &
2008-07-30T03:46:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	if it fails, you do the following to roll back: metacity --replace &
2008-07-30T03:48:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	you need to install a driver that will enable your 3d hardware
2008-07-30T03:49:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	what driver did you install?
2008-07-30T03:49:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	and how did you install it?
2008-07-30T03:52:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	what graphics card do you have? do you know the model?
2008-07-30T03:56:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	I'm not proficient with nvidia cards, but you probably need a proprietary driver
2008-07-30T03:58:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	oh ... hm ... there might be clues in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ... could you open that in gedit and paste the content to the pastebin?
2008-07-30T04:04:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	you are using the open source driver, and it says it can't utilize the 3d-hardware of your card
2008-07-30T04:05:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	it might be a kernel update that has caused this
2008-07-30T04:06:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	try installing the binary nvidia driver and see if that works better
2008-07-30T04:19:00.000Z	dynoll3	geirha	u there?
2008-07-30T04:23:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2008-07-31T19:07:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	They probably know that in #compiz-fusion
2008-07-31T19:09:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	I remember I got such a screensaver working in beryl, I had to compile a module for compiz to get it to work. Might be the same thing with compiz
2008-07-31T19:09:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	compile a module for _beryl_ to get it to work I mean
2008-07-31T19:10:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	have you asked in #compiz-fusion ?
2008-07-31T19:10:00.000Z	geirha	dynoll3	well, I haven't done anything like that with compiz, so I can only direct you to google I'm afraid
