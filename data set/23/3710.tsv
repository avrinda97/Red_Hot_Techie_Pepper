2008-02-15T02:30:00.000Z	Cew27		does anyone know where to get a script that disables compiz when running a game
2008-02-15T02:30:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	you could switch to metacity first
2008-02-15T02:31:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	make a shortcut that runs 'metacity --replace' and another that runs 'compiz --replace' to switch back and forth
2008-02-15T02:33:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	i am switching manualy at the moment but it is abit annoying
2008-02-15T02:33:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	yeah, that's why i made the shortcuts :)
2008-02-15T02:33:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	i have the blackbox icon for compiz, since i couldn't find the official ones, lol
2008-02-15T02:34:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	what does the blackbox icon have to do with anything lol
2008-02-15T02:34:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	'cause it looks like a black cube, so makes me think of compiz :P
2008-02-15T02:34:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	ahh got you now lol
2008-02-15T02:36:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	meh ill make the scripts and add a kayboard shotcut ;)
2008-02-15T02:37:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	whatever works for you. you should only have to do it once, so...
2008-02-15T02:37:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	wait, how do i make the script isnt it #bin/bash then the command or something
2008-02-15T02:37:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	might be easier with shortcuts though if someone else wants to use your computer
2008-02-15T02:38:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	no one else will ;)
2008-02-15T02:38:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	uh, sorry? having trouble parsing your grammar, lol
2008-02-15T02:39:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	oh, just missing a . i think
2008-02-15T02:39:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	it's "#!/bin/sh"
2008-02-15T02:40:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	using a script seems needlessly indirect though
2008-02-15T02:41:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	a shortcut would run it directly
2008-02-15T02:41:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	also i am now missing window borders :(
2008-02-15T02:41:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	your window manager isn't running
2008-02-15T02:42:00.000Z	Cew27	tanath	how do i fix it
2008-02-15T02:42:00.000Z	tanath	Cew27	alt+f2 should still work if you're running gnome.. then run in there 'compiz --replace' (or metacity, depending on which you want)
