2008-05-11T02:41:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=461309
2008-05-11T02:44:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	tried audacious?
2008-05-11T02:45:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	search the bug tracker, it's probably a similar reason
2008-05-11T02:47:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	audacious looks the same to me.  It's small and skinnable.  To each his own
2008-05-11T02:49:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	it's in the repositories, but here is a preview: http://www.audacious-media-player.org
2008-05-11T02:49:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	seems to be a fork of beep media player
2008-05-11T02:53:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	it does
2008-05-11T02:54:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	make sure you set PulseAudio as  your output audio plugin in preferences
2008-05-11T02:56:00.000Z	cute_bettong	jrib	sorry
2008-05-11T02:56:00.000Z	cute_bettong	jrib	i don't use fancy chat programs for irc i use irssi
2008-05-11T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	so?
2008-05-11T02:57:00.000Z	cute_bettong	jrib	it's a diffrent command than !<name> in irssi at least this one hehe
2008-05-11T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	irssi has tab completion same as xchat and others :)
2008-05-11T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	jr<tab>

2008-05-11T02:58:00.000Z	cute_bettong	jrib	no i apologise i did not
2008-05-11T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	make sure you set PulseAudio as  your output plugin in audio preferences
2008-05-11T02:59:00.000Z	cute_bettong	jrib	what is pulse audio, see i run a game called secondlife, i build clocks and test them in the havoc4 engene if SL is running it locks my sound server will pulse audio stop this from happning?
2008-05-11T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	cute_bettong	pulse audio is the default sound server in hardy
