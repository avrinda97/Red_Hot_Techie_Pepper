2007-10-20T01:01:00.000Z	nonix4		Should I expect 7.10 dist-upgrade to fit in 300 megabytes of space?
2007-10-20T01:02:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	the file is: 695.8 MB (729608192 bytes)
2007-10-20T01:03:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	not talking iso or anything... 4 gigabytes free on /home but the 4 gigabyte / has only 300 megs.
2007-10-20T01:03:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	and you don't want to repartition?
2007-10-20T01:04:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	preferably not :/
2007-10-20T01:04:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	wondering what will happen if I follow the documented upgrade method...
2007-10-20T01:04:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	not sure. I still have 7.04 :/
2007-10-20T01:07:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	have you tried looking to see how much space it uses right now? in a terminal window (and as root) type : du --max-depth=1 -h /
2007-10-20T01:07:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	that will give you a summary of your current directory sizes.
2007-10-20T01:10:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	Hmm, looks like no sane way to upgrade except repartitioning... wish I had installed using alt-cd & lvm :/
2007-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	bummer. :( If it's any consolation I've made some (similar) bad partitioning decisions.
2007-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	do you have available space in any of the other partitions?
2007-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	I'll make a policy for myself to never install a non-LVM system again ;)
2007-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	heh. I made a pact with myself to never try to guess how much to put into 18 different partitions for custom linux installs. :)
2007-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	have some partitions I can scrap & install clean there
2007-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	how big are the other partitions?
2007-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	dunno, the next step is figuring out which fdisk variants actually work... fdisk doesn't.
2007-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	apparently when you're installing Ubuntu you can do custom partitions. http://linux.wordpress.com/2007/10/01/installing-ubuntu-linux-704-feisty-fawn-on-the-ps3/
2007-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	on alt-cd, yes.
2007-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	(that's for playstations, but you might be able to use some keywords to do more searching)
2007-10-20T01:14:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	I've done some raid-lvm setups (real pain in the butt to install such on feisty btw)
2007-10-20T01:14:00.000Z	nonix4	emmajane	just this unlucky laptop here...
2007-10-20T01:14:00.000Z	emmajane	nonix4	I had a demon laptop once. I understand your pain! :)
