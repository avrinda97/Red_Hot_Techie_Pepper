2005-10-20T10:14:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	i used the hoary libdvdcss pkg in breezy
2005-10-20T10:14:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	like are there 'universe' repos for breezy?
2005-10-20T10:15:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	yes, but libdvdcss isn't there
2005-10-20T10:16:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	could you point me to any docs that describe additional repos, mp3's, etc?  i really cannot find the dang page!  :-)
2005-10-21T10:48:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	no
2005-10-21T10:48:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	lol... any way to make that 'permanent' ?
2005-10-21T10:48:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	yes
2005-10-21T10:50:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	could you point me in the general direction perhaps?
2005-10-21T10:50:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	bootscripts
2005-10-21T10:51:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	im sure there is a way to do it with out having to adjust scripts..  for example, suse linux has a gui option where you can set 'module name'
2005-10-21T10:52:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	that's not good enough for ndiswrapper because you have to load the .inf first
2005-10-21T10:53:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	i already did that...
2005-10-21T10:53:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	i do 'modprobe ndiswrapper'... card works
2005-10-21T10:54:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	you have to load the .inf every time
2005-10-21T10:54:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	uhh... negative.   as i just booted fresh and that did not happen
2005-10-21T10:54:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	then you can just use /etc/modules
2005-10-21T12:28:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	network-admin should be able to ifup for you
2005-10-21T12:28:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	that is already set to dhcp
2005-10-21T12:29:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	like right now, my system started up.. wlan does not have an ip
2005-10-21T12:30:00.000Z	sn9	vanberge	Enable this connection (checkbox)
2005-10-21T12:30:00.000Z	vanberge	sn9	it is
