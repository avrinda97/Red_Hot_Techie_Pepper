2011-02-19T02:53:00.000Z	g_		hi, is the notification thing supposed to queue notices? i only have one displayed at a time, even when i trigger more than one
2011-02-19T02:54:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	The notification box on the top right of the desktop?
2011-02-19T02:54:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	yeah
2011-02-19T02:54:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	i only see one box ever, not more than one, like it's supposed to, right?
2011-02-19T02:54:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	I'll show you what it does. May I private message you to send you like 5 messages real quick so you can see how it works (to avoid spamming this channel)?
2011-02-19T02:55:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	you mean notify-send foo hello ?
2011-02-19T02:55:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	and yes go for it
2011-02-19T02:56:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	See? IT's one box but it keeps expanding.
2011-02-19T02:56:00.000Z	g_		no it doesn't
2011-02-19T02:56:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	i just see one message
2011-02-19T02:56:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	What message would that be?
2011-02-19T02:56:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	whatever i send with notify-send
2011-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	g_		ie: notify-send boo; notify-send boo2;notify-send boo3
2011-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	g_		that just shows one box which slowly swaps between the messages

2011-02-19T02:58:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	Try this (this does it for me usually to get multiple bubbles) Change a song in your media player and adjust volume at same time. Or really anything with a notification and volume. Volume has its own notification bubble.
2011-02-19T03:03:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	you're missing the point! i'm triggering the bubbles myself!
2011-02-19T03:03:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	Yes, I udnerstand that and I gave you a link to the program you are using.
2011-02-19T03:04:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	Previously I did not, that is correct, but the link I gave is about the program it would appear you are using?
2011-02-19T03:05:00.000Z	g_	Starminn	so, is there a better notification program to use?
2011-02-19T03:05:00.000Z	g_		the notify plugin with ubuntu kinda doesn't work
2011-02-19T03:05:00.000Z	g_		it just feels like a cheap osx clone!
2011-02-19T03:07:00.000Z	Starminn	g_	I do not know of any, I'm sorry. You could try Googling around though and see what you come acorss. I do not know of any though, no.
