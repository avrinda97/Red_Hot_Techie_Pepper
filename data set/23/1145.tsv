2010-08-03T15:14:00.000Z	mcnellis		I'm trying to move all .swp files from a directory and all the swp files in its children & so forth directories as well. How cal I select them all?
2010-08-03T15:14:00.000Z	mcnellis		so I dont' have to do mv ./*.swp ./temp && mv ./*/*.swp ./temp && mv ./*/*/*.swp ./temp && etc...
2010-08-03T15:15:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	you would have to use find or a shell script
2010-08-03T15:15:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	do you mean you need to delete them?  once moved they don't work
2010-08-03T15:16:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	and once removed it is possible for a file being edited to be corrupted
2010-08-03T15:16:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	is you are talking to me use my nick in your response
2010-08-03T15:18:00.000Z	mcnellis	tesuji	what is the best way to properly dispose of them?/
2010-08-03T15:19:00.000Z	mcnellis	tesuji	I have many of them from vim sessions. Not sure why they remain
2010-08-03T15:20:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	.swp files exist while a file is being edited by vi - they disappear when the session ends - if a .swp exists it means either the file is still being edited of the vi session was discontinued abruptly (system rebooted during edit, for example) so why do you want to remove them, what's going on?
2010-08-03T15:21:00.000Z	mcnellis	tesuji	well I do have my session open. I uploaded the dirs to anothe server
2010-08-03T15:21:00.000Z	mcnellis	tesuji	and it seems the files are getting corrupted. the last 5-10 lines are replicating at the bottom. doing PHP work so this is causing allm y files to err heh
2010-08-03T15:22:00.000Z	mcnellis	tesuji	should I close vim and then reupload those directories?
2010-08-03T15:22:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	i do not know what you mean by 'upload directories'
2010-08-03T15:23:00.000Z	mcnellis	tesuji	 ^
2010-08-03T15:24:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	you want to close your vim session before moving the directories around else the .swp files will go too, and then when you vi on the server you have an exiting .swp file and vi gets confused
2010-08-03T15:25:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	where vim puts the .swp files is configurable i believe, you could cause them to be created outside your workspace
2010-08-03T15:25:00.000Z	mcnellis	tesuji	if I save my vim session does it persist the .swp files?
2010-08-03T15:25:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	.swp files are removed when the session is closed
2010-08-03T15:26:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	the existence of a .swp file usually means either the file is being edited or the session terminated abnormally (hence the file needs to be recovered)
2010-08-03T15:27:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	i can't tell you what you should do with them but i can explain how they work so you can make appropriate decision whether to delete them
2010-08-03T15:29:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	i will tell you not to run that find command unless you know what you're doing - deleting .swp files while the file is being edited may trash your file
2010-08-03T15:39:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	either close your vim sessions or package up everything but the .swp files to move
2010-08-03T15:39:00.000Z	tesuji	mcnellis	better to close your vims
