2007-11-25T21:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	At worst you would apt-get wine and reload it
2007-11-25T21:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	wine is safe,
2007-11-25T21:11:00.000Z	NewUserr	Jack_Sparrow	What about viruses on Wine?
2007-11-25T21:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	they can not effect the linux part of your os.

2007-11-26T00:58:00.000Z	NewUserr	Jack_Sparrow	what should i do then?
2007-11-26T00:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	You can try reinstallng cups, or reinstall base system again, if one piece is missing, you may be missing other things as well
2007-11-26T01:00:00.000Z	NewUserr	Jack_Sparrow	and how does that work?
2007-11-26T01:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	as in full install.
2007-11-26T01:01:00.000Z	NewUserr	Jack_Sparrow	thnx
2007-11-26T04:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	dual boot is fine.. it is a bit easier to have xp on first... especially, when it usually needs to be reinstalled more often
2007-11-26T04:04:00.000Z	NewUserr	Jack_Sparrow	yes i know thats why i am asking but i try out dual boot thnx
2007-12-02T02:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	that is a rather odd error.. have you used outsdie repos or any of those horrible scripts
2007-12-02T02:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NewUserr	I would start by cleaning up you repo list..
