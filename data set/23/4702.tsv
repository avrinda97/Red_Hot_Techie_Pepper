2007-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	ummm ya
2007-05-26T12:57:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	Linux runs on boxes that would never in their lives run Linux
2007-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	err ya sorry
2007-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	Wow... Now, I'm awfully tempted.
2007-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	whats the specs on your computer?
2007-05-26T12:58:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	No idea.  Let me try to dig them up.
2007-05-26T13:00:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	So, what things dya need to know?
2007-05-26T13:00:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	processor, memory mainly
2007-05-26T13:00:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	those are the key points
2007-05-26T13:02:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	1305 MHZ (Or so the sys info says) and Virtual memory or physical?
2007-05-26T13:02:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	physical
2007-05-26T13:02:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	256MB.  Did say It was hyucky.
2007-05-26T13:02:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	that would run Xubuntu fine
2007-05-26T13:02:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	Oooooo.
2007-05-26T13:02:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	Ubuntu would be painful, but Xubuntu would be just fine, I put it on my dad's lappy and it has similar specs
2007-05-26T13:03:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	http://xubuntu.org ;)
2007-05-26T13:04:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	What specs would you recommend as a good minimum for Ubuntu?
2007-05-26T13:04:00.000Z	zbrown	Funkah	good minimum for ubuntu? Well I would say at least a 2ghz Pentium (NOT Celeron) and 512 MB ram
2007-05-26T13:09:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	I should get Dapper Drake versus Feisty Fawn?
2007-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	Funkah	zbrown	Hate to ask, but is dual-booting Xubuntu with windows not possible without putting it onto a CD?  The dual-booting page at Xubuntu seems to suggest such :/
