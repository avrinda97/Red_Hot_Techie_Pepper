2011-01-18T22:37:00.000Z	Guest65971		Hi all. I've got huge problem: gparted see hdd as 150 GB which is utter bl since there are 2 os's on it (ubuntu / windows). The 'fdisk -l' says it cannot access device and one time (i don't remeber name of software) I've got info about missing prtition table. What I can do to restory it to working state?
2011-01-18T22:39:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	what device are you using with fdisk -l ?
2011-01-18T22:39:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	/dev/sda
2011-01-18T22:40:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	are you doing it as root?
2011-01-18T22:41:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	good point. Now I get the output. Looks norml thou it does not work so.
2011-01-18T22:41:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	I don't know what you mean by "it does not work so"
2011-01-18T22:42:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	I am using live usbe atm. I wanted to format old ubuntu install and make new one but gparted see hdd as empty space.
2011-01-18T22:42:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	could you pastebin the output from fdisk -l ?
2011-01-18T22:43:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	That would be problematic as the machine with the problem also refuses to make eth0 connection. It is samsunch netbook.

2011-01-18T22:43:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	fdisk -l says there's no partitions?
2011-01-18T22:44:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	No. The fdisk shows all of them. Gparted ergo the install program has problems. Let me check it again.
2011-01-18T22:46:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	Nope. Still it looks like unallocated space. Maybe this is related but few days ago it stopped booting. It started the bios and then restarted. I reinstalled grub from live cd and everything was working till yesterday as I was performing dist updated and some hanges.
2011-01-18T22:46:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	I'm confused. fdisk -l shows partitions, but gparted shows all unallocated space on /dev/sda ?
2011-01-18T22:47:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	excacly.
2011-01-18T22:47:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	you're running gparted as root as well?
2011-01-18T22:47:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	yes.
2011-01-18T22:49:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	when you run gparted from terminal, do you see any messages in the terminal?
2011-01-18T22:50:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	Right now I am booting into ubuntu installed on the hdd (the one I want to reinstall).
2011-01-18T22:51:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	ok. in any case, someone had a similar problem to you, and found that the drive had overlapping partitions. It may be relevant to your case: http://gparted-forum.surf4.info/viewtopic.php?id=1161
2011-01-18T22:51:00.000Z	ayecee	Guest65971	I have to attend to other things. good luck!
2011-01-18T22:51:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	I will check that out. Thank you.
2011-01-18T22:58:00.000Z	Guest65971	ayecee	It is exacly the same as in the link. One more question. Do you knew the software that the person is reffering to? The "testdisk". I can't find it in a live cd or repositories.
