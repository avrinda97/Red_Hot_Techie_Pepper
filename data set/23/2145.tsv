2009-06-16T20:37:00.000Z	sedontane		does anyone know how i can make ubuntu recognise my IR receiver? it was seen in the old 8.10 revisions
2009-06-16T20:38:00.000Z	sedontane		I am running 9.04
2009-06-16T20:39:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	linux uses lirc -- you will need to read up on lirc to make a IR reciever work
2009-06-16T21:21:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	your configs were probably replaced by the upgrade
2009-06-16T21:22:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	I have a clean install of 9.04
2009-06-16T21:23:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	I'm guessing you had v4l working in 8.10 and it doesn't work in 9.04 ... and I say...
2009-06-16T21:24:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	I havent personally used 8.1 i have it on good authority that it works on 8.1
2009-06-16T21:25:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	that might be a good place to start ... or better yet is 8.04 which is a Long Term Support version that at least for me has been extremly reliable
2009-06-16T21:26:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	Mythbuntu 8.04.1 ok?
2009-06-16T21:26:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	we cannot support that as it is a derivitave version ... reccommend the real deal
2009-06-16T21:28:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	what I would do ... you might want the myth repos later on though as they are built from svn and are probably newer versions than the ubuntu packaged ones
2009-06-16T21:28:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	thanks for all the help and ill get back to you on how it all turns out
2009-06-19T04:45:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	2.6.28 is part of jaunty .. is not part of intrepid ... you will have to upgrade to jaunty if you want 2.6.28
2009-06-19T04:46:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	cant do that as it kills the very thing i need the higher kernel to fix
2009-06-19T04:47:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	is there any way to install a newer kernel - sebsebseb told me about ppa earlier
2009-06-19T04:50:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	this would be the ppa in question ... WARNING this could break your system...https://launchpad.net/~next-kernel/+archive/ppa
2009-06-19T04:50:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	warning taken - thanks
2009-06-19T05:04:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	thanks for the ppa tip - have 2.6.28 kernel now
2009-06-19T05:04:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	woo hoo... I like pointing people in the right direction
2009-06-19T05:20:00.000Z	fccf	sedontane	card works? IR doesn't?   -- install lirc
2009-06-19T05:21:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	it was installed (back on 9.04) wouldnt work at all
2009-06-19T05:23:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	problem was that ubuntu didnt even see IR reciever - hopefully this will fix it
2009-06-19T05:38:00.000Z	sedontane	fccf	I saw somewhere a command line way to test my remote but i cant frind the reference anywhere - any more finger waggling you can do for me?
