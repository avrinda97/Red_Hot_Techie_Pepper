2010-01-25T14:35:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	nothing happens
2010-01-25T14:26:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	it should be sudo apt-get upgrade   No 'install'
2010-01-25T14:27:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2010-01-25T14:27:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	that means there's nothing that needs to be upgraded
2010-01-25T14:28:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	and you want to upgrade to Karmic?
2010-01-25T14:28:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	yes
2010-01-25T14:32:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	when you open the update manager doesn't it tell you that there's a new version available?
2010-01-25T14:32:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	nope it says no current updates available
2010-01-25T14:33:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	it says my system is up-to-date
2010-01-25T14:34:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	hit alt+f2 then type gksudo update-manager -c
2010-01-25T14:35:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	it should tell you at the very top that a new version of ubuntu is available.
2010-01-25T14:38:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	try just update-manager -c  leave off the gksudo
2010-01-25T14:39:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	works, but it's saying still my system is up-to-date
2010-01-25T14:39:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	 hit 'check'
2010-01-25T14:40:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	already hit the check button, still the sname
2010-01-25T14:46:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	Go to System > Administration > Software Sources:  then choose Normal releases in the Show new distribution releases drop-down menu
2010-01-25T14:46:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	then alt+f2 update-manager -d
2010-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	I don't think you can upgrade directly to karmic.  You'll have to go to 8.10, then to 9.04, then to 9.10
2010-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	got it mate, it's showing 8.10 now..
2010-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	I totally forgot that wasn't selected by default.
2010-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	thanks =)
2010-01-25T14:56:00.000Z	l3ns	EastDallas	is it possible to go back to 8.04 after upgrading to 8.10?
2010-01-25T14:56:00.000Z	EastDallas	l3ns	not that i'm aware of, not without reinstalling.
