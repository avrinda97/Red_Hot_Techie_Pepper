2010-09-23T05:56:00.000Z	dublisk		Can anyone point me to a good tutorial to share certain folders over the network to other linux computers?
2010-09-23T05:56:00.000Z	dublisk		I want it password protected too
2010-09-23T05:57:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	With Ubuntu, you should be able to right-click and choose "Share this folder'
2010-09-23T05:57:00.000Z	dublisk	undecim	: how does the other computer access it?
2010-09-23T05:57:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	smb://hostname/sharename
2010-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	dublisk	undecim	: you can mount it like that?
2010-09-23T05:59:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	There is a way to mount smb shares, but gnome will do it for you automatically
2010-09-23T06:00:00.000Z	dublisk	undecim	: the other boxes might not have gnome installed
2010-09-23T06:00:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	Will you be the only other person using these, or will other ppl be?
2010-09-23T06:01:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	Setup an SSH server then.
2010-09-23T06:02:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	You can access it via gvfs (i.e. nautilus) or through a command-line tool (rsync, scp) or mount it with sshfs.
2010-09-23T06:03:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	Well, you can, I think, but ssh is much more secure, and if you are only going to be doing this on Linux machines, it's the best option IMHO
2010-09-23T06:04:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	SSH is also a lot more flexible. You can login and run commands via SSH. This would make working with files over the network easier if you know how to use the command line
2010-09-23T06:05:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	If you want minimal overhead, an FTP server would be good, too
2010-09-23T06:07:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	flan_suse: If there is anyone else on your network (or if, for example, you have a wifi access point, secured or not) you will want to password protect the share.
2010-09-23T06:08:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	I would look at setting up an FTP or NFS server then.
2010-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	If you're already used to doing this with the windows server and just want to use a Linux server instead, then use a samba share.
2010-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	From what I can find though google, NFS is fastest transfer for large files.

2010-09-23T06:16:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	ubuntu desktop has not SSHd installed unless you install it yourself
2010-09-23T09:03:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	Kind of...
2010-09-23T09:03:00.000Z	undecim	dublisk	You could set up a remote serial port or something like that.
