2006-05-01T06:28:00.000Z	steel	brandon_	I have other things i need to have in there and the fat is read only
2006-05-01T06:28:00.000Z	steel		this is what the proftpd guide says to do,"Work arounds to allow access to other parts of the file system include exporting the part of the filesystem to be accessed from inside the chroot and mounting via NFS" how do i do that?
2006-05-01T06:29:00.000Z	steel		it also says "As of the 2.4.x Linux kernel tree it is possible to mount filesystems multiple times and to mount subdirectories of filesystems elsewhere on the filesystem."
2006-05-01T06:31:00.000Z	steel		i hope so
