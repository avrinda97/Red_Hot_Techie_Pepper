2009-12-20T03:41:00.000Z	Omen_20		Why is it that Complete Removal of a program seems to be completely useless?
2009-12-20T03:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	which program?
2009-12-20T03:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	ok the .folders in home
2009-12-20T03:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	the hidden .folders in home
2009-12-20T03:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	that is where program user data goes
2009-12-20T03:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	yeah I just seen, on another distro right now, but  should be the same as Ubuntu for the Banshee stuff,  i'll have a look to see if I can find something hold on
2009-12-20T03:45:00.000Z	Omen_20	sebsebseb	thanks
2009-12-20T03:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	ok new there was something.  .cache and .config have Banshee stuff in them
2009-12-20T03:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	if you delete the hidden folder for a program or move it some where else, .mozilla for example, then re open Firefox, it will be like you just installed it for the first time
2009-12-20T03:48:00.000Z	Omen_20	sebsebseb	thanks
2009-12-20T03:49:00.000Z	Omen_20	sebsebseb	most of my issues were in terms of podcasts. It started doubling everything and every podcast would download the Presidents Weekly Address. It was like that RSS feed took over.
2009-12-20T03:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	oh .gconf  apps has Banshee in it as well
2009-12-20T03:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	(banshee-1 the exact name, but not really relivaint)  anyway if you remove/move all Banshee stuff from hidden .folders in Home.  and re open Banshee it should be like a new install again
2009-12-20T03:54:00.000Z	Omen_20	sebsebseb	yes it does. Thanks! This is actually easier than Windows which I should have expected. But I live on Banshee and freaked out.
2009-12-20T03:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	uhmm at the last bit?
2009-12-20T03:56:00.000Z	Omen_20	sebsebseb	what?
2009-12-20T03:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	nevermind, I misunderstood or something,  I guess you weren't happy when Banshee messed up on you, that's what you were saying basicalley
2009-12-20T03:59:00.000Z	Omen_20	sebsebseb	yeah I had never had a problem with a program in linux since ive been using it. First time I've ever had to deal with it like on Windows.
2009-12-20T03:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	well as you just learnt, it's easier to fix programs that went wrong in Ubuntu, than on Windows
2010-06-27T03:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	maybe you moved something about on it, and so something to do with that
2010-06-27T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	or maybe you removed the uhmm.  seperators
2010-06-27T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Omen_20	This might help
2010-06-27T03:28:00.000Z	Omen_20	sebsebseb	It shouldnt have anything to do with separators. It just expands to the left with blank space, cramming my system monitor towards my global menu. I'll try the commands though.
