2007-08-02T15:30:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	Sorry, i got disconnected
2007-08-02T15:31:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32214/ that's what's in etc/mtab
2007-08-02T15:32:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	well, your second disk isn't mounted atm
2007-08-02T15:32:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	 you say it's /dev/hdb1?
2007-08-02T15:33:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	first make a folder where you want to mount it. then: "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 <where you want to mount it>"
2007-08-02T15:36:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	I'm getting mount: mount point media does not exist when i try "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 media"
2007-08-02T15:38:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	mount mounts a file system over the existing system at that point, so you probably don't want to mount /dev/hdb1 over /mount but rather at /mount/<some directory in mount>.
2007-08-02T15:59:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	did you get the permissions that i sent before?
2007-08-02T15:59:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	oh sorry. i was busy... one second...
2007-08-02T15:59:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	Okay
2007-08-02T16:01:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	yep, your permissions are fine. i'd try mounting the drive with rw, user and see if that helps:
2007-08-02T16:01:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	Sorry, but how do i go about that?
2007-08-02T16:02:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	sorry: "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /home/jay/media -o rw,user"
2007-08-02T16:04:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	can you navigate into /home/jay/media using root? (sudo -i)
2007-08-02T16:04:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	Should i just reinstall windows, get what i need, then format the drive as a ext3?
2007-08-02T16:05:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	i really have very little experience with ntfs. it may be easier, i dunno. however, you managed to mount the file system, so theoretically you should be able to get into it and take stuff out of it
2007-08-02T16:06:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	what are the permissions on /home/jay/media now?
2007-08-02T16:07:00.000Z	JayF1	howlingmadhowie	rx and root is the owner
2007-08-02T16:08:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	mm, then you should be able to read it at least
2007-08-02T16:11:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	once you've mounted it, you can't chmod it. that would mean chmodding the file system. the question is why it got mounted read-only
2007-08-02T16:13:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	JayF1	there is a driver for writing to ntfs. i'm still unsure as to why you can't go there as jay but only as root.
