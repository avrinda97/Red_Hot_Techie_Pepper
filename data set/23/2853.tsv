2008-10-26T17:48:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	just ask your question
2008-10-26T17:48:00.000Z	jjdiamond		should my hard drives be labeled sda and sdb?
2008-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	why not. and what is your real question?
2008-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	jjdiamond		so a is primary drive and b is slave?
2008-10-26T17:50:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	no. a is the first drive, and b - the second
2008-10-26T17:50:00.000Z	jjdiamond		ok thats what i meant
2008-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	i'm not sure if the system guarantees that the master is listed first. and you can have up to 2 masters
2008-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	jjdiamond		when i click on places, i see the second drive.  when i open it, it won't let me create a folder
2008-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	jjdiamond		all i see is lost and found folder
2008-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	this is maybe a permisson problem. check if your user owns the folder and if it has write permissions on it
2008-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	jjdiamond	velko	i don't know how to do that
2008-10-26T17:53:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	right click the folder and go to properties. select the permissions tab
2008-10-26T17:53:00.000Z	jjdiamond	velko	all grey
2008-10-26T17:53:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	who is listed as the owner of the folder?
2008-10-26T17:54:00.000Z	jjdiamond	velko	root
2008-10-26T17:54:00.000Z	velko		!pt > Nvidiot
2008-10-26T17:56:00.000Z	velko		!permissions > velko
2008-10-26T17:56:00.000Z	velko	jjdiamond	look at this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
2008-10-26T17:59:00.000Z	jjdiamond	velko	thanks but it's like reading a different language
