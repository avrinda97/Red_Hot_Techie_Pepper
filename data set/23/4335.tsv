2007-10-26T12:00:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	 like the one i'm on.
2007-10-26T11:56:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	whats your story?
2007-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	Once upon a time, Feisty was a happy powerbook. But he wanted more, so Upgrade said 'hey, click me and you'll get GUTSY!'. Feisty was tempted, but when powerbook restarted there was nothing after the splash screen. Splash screen froze in the icy new kernel, but now all I can get is the Safe Terminal.
2007-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	thats awesome... but horrible...
2007-10-26T11:59:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	got data you need to backup?

2007-10-26T11:59:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	and you have no other machine around?
2007-10-26T11:59:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	 oh i have other machines.
2007-10-26T12:00:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	so transfer your data and install Gutsy from scratch
2007-10-26T12:00:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	 yikes. i can only get to terminal...is there an easy way to tell Ubuntu to use that other kernel?
2007-10-26T12:01:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	I don't know if the other kernel is still there..... but I would take the HDD out and whack it into the next machine ... get my data off and wipe the drive...
2007-10-26T12:02:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	easier said than done, its a laptop!
2007-10-26T12:03:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	 i have a few kernels in there, i just looked.
2007-10-26T12:03:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	yes I know... but then again I do that sorta thing for a living
2007-10-26T12:03:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	can you load into another kernel at startup?
2007-10-26T12:04:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	i did rebuild this lappy, but im running out of deskspace here, with that Nintendo DS in a million bits over there....heheh... how do i load into another kernel? you mean  hit TAB at the Boot prompt?
2007-10-26T12:06:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	 i tried the 'old' option but it froze.
2007-10-26T12:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	there are some interesting codes here: http://www.herckb.com/2007/08/29/ubuntu-compiling-a-custom-kernel/
2007-10-26T12:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	well ... you may have a real screwed up system then...
2007-10-26T12:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	nicholaspaul	I would really get the data backed up and renew the state of the machines OS...
2007-10-26T12:08:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	zetheroo	dagnabbit. I'll give it a shot.. cheers :D
