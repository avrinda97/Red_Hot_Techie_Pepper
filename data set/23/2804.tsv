2009-02-13T23:02:00.000Z	SingAlong	mhall119	that guy on the blog clearly mentions that the suggested driver by ubuntu wont work
2009-02-13T23:02:00.000Z	mhall119	SingAlong	yeah, some of them don't
2009-02-24T22:37:00.000Z	mhall119	SingAlong	is it a new domain, or recently moved?
2009-02-24T22:37:00.000Z	SingAlong	mhall119	since 2 days. it works for others bro. just not on my comp
2009-02-24T22:37:00.000Z	mhall119	SingAlong	maybe your ISP's DNS servers just haven't propogated the change?
2009-02-24T22:38:00.000Z	SingAlong	mhall119	oh. but my other website's blog subdomain which i configured together works right.
2009-02-24T22:39:00.000Z	mhall119	SingAlong	for a subdomain, your ISP's servers will check with the domain host's servers.  For a new domain, your ISP won't know who the domain host is
