2011-01-28T03:28:00.000Z	ubun	goltoof	export? your know more than i do
2011-01-28T03:28:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 i mean convert
2011-01-28T03:28:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 ie,  convert -resize 50% image.png image.png
2011-01-28T03:29:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	beats opening the image in gimp, rescaling, etc
2011-01-28T03:29:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 but as far as the lossyness, idk
2011-01-28T03:31:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 bernardv is right, rescale the image... but offtopic anyway.. try #gimp
2011-01-28T03:34:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 try #gimp
2011-02-01T03:50:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	and in firefox?
2011-02-01T03:50:00.000Z	ubun	goltoof	i dont use firefox... in fact i uninstalled it because i liked chrome...
2011-02-01T03:51:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 lol, uninstall firefox from ubuntu?  wow..
2011-02-01T03:52:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 what are your specs?
2011-02-01T03:52:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 usually it's from lack of resources, in my experience
2011-02-01T03:53:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 specs..
2011-02-01T03:53:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	  your system specifications.. how much ram?
2011-02-01T03:54:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 as i stated, i find the flash plugin will crash on computers with scarce avaailable memory.
2011-02-01T03:54:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 or when having too many flash videos open at one time. rarely crashes on good systems
2011-02-01T03:56:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 well, one good reason NOT to uninstall firefox, or you could test to see if you had this problem in other browsers...
2011-02-01T03:56:00.000Z	goltoof	ubun	 good to keep multiple browsers for testing purposes
