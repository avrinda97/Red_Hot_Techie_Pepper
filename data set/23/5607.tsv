2007-06-21T07:31:00.000Z	AaronCampbell		Would anyone have time to try to help me make my networking work again on Kubuntu Fiesty?  I have 2 wired gigabit connections, and 1 wireless connection.  All I really want is to get one of the gigabit connections working
2007-06-21T07:32:00.000Z	AaronCampbell		It appears as though all the interfaces are working fine.   don't see any way to choose a wireless network, and as for wired, I can't get an IP on my network (192.168.2.x), and a static IP (what I used to run) doesn't seem to work.  I've changed the cables out a few times, and am using one I tested on this laptop.   This laptop connects to the same router, using DHCP
2007-06-21T07:32:00.000Z	AaronCampbell		And worst of all, it was working fine a few days ago
2007-06-21T07:33:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	does ifconfig show any ip addresses assigned to anything?
2007-06-21T07:34:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	eth0 has 192.168.2.1 (static)  Eth1 has nothing, wlan0 lists an inet6 address...which I don't think it should
2007-06-21T07:35:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	inet6 addr is normal
2007-06-21T07:35:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	is eth0 plugged into anything?
2007-06-21T07:36:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	yes.  It's plugged into a gigabit switch, which is connected to a router.  I tried plugging it straight to the router as well.
2007-06-21T07:44:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	any other ideas on my network problem?
2007-06-21T07:44:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	one sec
2007-06-21T07:45:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	does the router have dhcp enabled?
2007-06-21T07:47:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	yes, that's how this laptop and a couple other computers here get their IPs
2007-06-21T07:47:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	what do you get if you do sudo dhclient eth0 (or whichever you have plugged in, regardless of whether it's actually set static or dhcp)?
2007-06-21T07:51:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	?
2007-06-21T07:51:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	it says: wmaster0: unknown hardware address type 801...Listening...Sending...it tried 4 different intervals...No DHCPOFFERS received...No working leases in persistent database - sleeping
2007-06-21T07:51:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	just takes me a while to type all that in...since I'm on a different system..
2007-06-21T07:55:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	ditto with eth1?
2007-06-21T07:56:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	yes
2007-06-21T08:03:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	any other ideas?
2007-06-21T08:04:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	was curious why wmaster0 showed up for dhclient
2007-06-21T08:05:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	not sure...lemme check
2007-06-21T08:06:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	cwillu	same thing
2007-06-21T08:24:00.000Z	cwillu	AaronCampbell	still there?
