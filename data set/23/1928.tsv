2009-12-22T20:21:00.000Z	rods		howdy! Got an interesting problem. Anytime I change my monitor resolution, my internet drops away (daemon dies?). Any ideas?

2009-12-22T20:25:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	(WAG) not enoug memory?
2009-12-22T20:26:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	shouldn't be a problem--6 GB RAM, more than enough swap memory as needed
2009-12-22T20:26:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	sometimes processes get killed by linux if not enough memory
2009-12-22T20:26:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	anyway to force it to continue?
2009-12-22T20:27:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	in that case... not a clue. What does the log show?
2009-12-22T20:27:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	how do I check the log? (still a newb--sorry :-/)
2009-12-22T20:28:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	(top of my head) /var/log/syslog file, check it with an editor /viewer
2009-12-22T20:28:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	will do
2009-12-22T20:29:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	check messages file to
2009-12-22T20:29:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	to -> too
2009-12-22T20:30:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	segfault?
2009-12-22T20:30:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	I see some segfault errors
2009-12-22T20:31:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	eeep.. means either faulty program or incorrect library
2009-12-22T20:31:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	know any good tricks to fix? This has been an issue for awhile (internet drops out in screen resolution change)
2009-12-22T20:32:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	could be there are some missing libraries, but i don't know how you can check that easily.
2009-12-22T20:33:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	only way i know is to check it manually with ld.  Question : which program segfaults?
2009-12-22T20:35:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	I get the following: npviewer.bin[3883]: segfault at ff999ed8 ip 00000000ff999ed8 sp 00000000ff85b24c error 14
2009-12-22T20:35:00.000Z	rods		not sure where to check on that
2009-12-22T20:37:00.000Z	MarderIII	rods	never heard of it. I think that program _voilently_ objects to screen changes :-) I would look into it if it can be uninstalled, or otherwise start ubuntu in the correct screen size
2009-12-22T20:53:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	you still here?
2009-12-22T20:53:00.000Z	rods	MarderIII	I have a pastebin for the issue as it showed up in the logs: http://paste.ubuntu.com/344785/
