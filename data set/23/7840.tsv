2005-04-20T09:45:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	have you tried to enable sync mode?
2005-04-20T09:46:00.000Z	Jefis	delire	i am not sure how to enable
2005-04-20T09:46:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	but the readme says you need to edit /etc/modules.conf
2005-04-20T09:46:00.000Z	Jefis	delire	how to do that?
2005-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	Jefis	delire	any idea how to fix it?
2005-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	ok, that's no issue. you have followed the readme on that page?
2005-04-20T09:48:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	under the "7) IMPROVE PERFORMANCE - SYNC OPTION"
2005-04-20T09:49:00.000Z	Jefis	delire	 done that sync, uncommented, but how with modules?
2005-04-20T09:49:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	right, and so does '"tail -25 /var/log/messages | grep pppoe' give you any output about whether sync mode is working/running?

2005-04-20T09:50:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	sorry for double post..
2005-04-20T09:50:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	don't msg me
2005-04-20T09:51:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	you should have output like " pppoed[5555] : Operating in Sync mode."
2005-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	Jefis	delire	any more ideas?
2005-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	not unless you tell me whether you got the output i gave above..
2005-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	 pppoed[5555] : Operating in Sync mode.
2005-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	or similar.
2005-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	it's not in syn mode by the looks of it..
2005-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	Jefis	delire	i can give you remote ssh root login, if you help me :)
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	delire	Jefis	no, i reckon you best check http://google.com/linux, though the info you've found on that page is very good. as i don't have that router, i can't help you properly
