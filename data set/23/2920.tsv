2008-10-01T06:21:00.000Z	Indoctrine	_mach	The only time I've had something like that as a problem is with Gentoo, as for Ubuntu, its never happened to me
2008-10-01T06:21:00.000Z	_mach	Indoctrine	you saw the log?
2008-10-01T06:22:00.000Z	Indoctrine	_mach	You're using a PCI wireless card? Or a wireless modem?
2008-10-01T06:23:00.000Z	_mach	Indoctrine	pci wireless card.
2008-10-01T06:24:00.000Z	_mach	Indoctrine	i really don't get it.
2008-10-01T06:24:00.000Z	Indoctrine	_mach	Do you have security enabled on your network?
2008-10-01T06:25:00.000Z	_mach	Indoctrine	did you use the gnome ppp?
2008-10-01T06:25:00.000Z	_mach	Indoctrine	if you could show me what you did, maybe i'd find out what im doing wrong.
2008-10-01T06:25:00.000Z	Indoctrine	_mach	For? I haven't set my fileserver up yet.
2008-10-01T06:26:00.000Z	_mach	Indoctrine	no, your desktop
2008-10-01T06:27:00.000Z	Indoctrine	_mach	I don't have EVDO, I have an 802.11x in built. Which, although a pain in the proverbial won't help you. :P
2008-10-01T06:28:00.000Z	_mach	Indoctrine	tah.
2008-10-01T06:28:00.000Z	Indoctrine	_mach	It's much worse if you're using a USB wireless modem, I tried setting my sister's one up today and I couldn't even get it working.
