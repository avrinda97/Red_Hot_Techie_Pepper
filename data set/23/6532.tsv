2006-07-25T14:24:00.000Z	seanh		Hi all, trying to get a pcmcia wireless card working, lshw calls it a Texas Instruments ACX 111, the wiki says these should work out of the box. I can see and acticvate the card, but it sees no networks
2006-07-25T14:25:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	did you tell it the name if the wiress.. thing?
2006-07-25T14:25:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- huh? I'm telling it to look for networks to join, but it can't see any, it lists none
2006-07-25T14:26:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	how do you tell it to look? i had to just type in the name of mine
2006-07-25T14:26:00.000Z	Intangir		some of them dont advertise so they wont be found
2006-07-25T14:27:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- in System-Administration-Networking, setup the card to use DHCP (in Properties) then activate the card, then go intoo Properties again, you should have a drop-down list of all the networks in range, but I'm getting none
2006-07-25T14:27:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	your wireless AP might be set up to not send that information, mines set up to not 'advertise' it doesnt broadcast anything about itself to people trying to join
2006-07-25T14:27:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	thats usually a good idea
2006-07-25T14:28:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- no, there is definitely a network in here it should see. I just gave it the network name myself though, and it's not connecting to it
2006-07-25T14:28:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	make sure you give the name, the SSID, and the password info
2006-07-25T14:29:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- there's no such info, it's DHCP connect
2006-07-25T14:29:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	its wireless right?
2006-07-25T14:29:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- yes
2006-07-25T14:29:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	wireless need name and SSID at least to connect, and usually a password too
2006-07-25T14:29:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	WEP password, or WPA preshared key stuff
2006-07-25T14:30:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	i think default SSID for most networks is 6
2006-07-25T14:30:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	or maybe that was the channel, and ssid was the name of it.. i cant recall
2006-07-25T14:31:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	your card shows up the right? a wireless card? when you goto network settings?
2006-07-25T14:31:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- the ESSID is the network name, like "my network", if the network is open, as this one is, that's all you should need. Anyway, the netowrk is advertised, so it shuold see it
2006-07-25T14:31:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- Yeah, I can se the card, but it sees no networks
2006-07-25T14:31:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	could you just be too far away?
2006-07-25T14:31:00.000Z	seanh	Intangir	- I don't think so
2006-07-25T14:32:00.000Z	Intangir	seanh	hrm im out of ideas then, i know at my house mywireless stuff downstairs had a hard time picking up my access point until i moved it to a place where fewer walls were between us
