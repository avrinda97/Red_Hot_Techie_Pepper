2011-05-18T21:00:00.000Z	Rich_		Hi guys, this is Rich and i am looking for some help.
2011-05-18T21:01:00.000Z	Rich_		hi mohadila :)
2011-05-18T21:01:00.000Z	Rich_		I am still new to Linux and i am trying to do some network programming on Ubuntu 10.1
2011-05-18T21:01:00.000Z	Rich_		10.10
2011-05-18T21:02:00.000Z	Rich_		its a simple system issue, but its stopping me doing my prog
2011-05-18T21:02:00.000Z	Rich_		i am trying to leverage the "Checksum.h" header file, so i can use the TCP Checksum functions defined within it.
2011-05-18T21:03:00.000Z	Rich_		But the checksum.h is not in my /usr/include.
2011-05-18T21:03:00.000Z	Rich_		its in /usr/src/linux-header<version>/include.
2011-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	TheRedOctober	Rich_	Did you try making a link as a rough work-around?
2011-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	Rich_		Anyone know how to take a header from /usr/src/linux-header-<version>/include over to /usr/include?
2011-05-18T21:05:00.000Z	Rich_	TheRedOctober	yeah i did actually.
2011-05-18T21:05:00.000Z	Rich_		I am new to linux (Ubuntu), and have read tons of stuff.
2011-05-18T21:05:00.000Z	Rich_		But still stuck :(
2011-05-18T21:07:00.000Z	Rich_	TheRedOctober	do you know much about including headers from the Kernel Source Headers?
2011-05-18T21:08:00.000Z	TheRedOctober	Rich_	I'm do most of my systems stuff like that in python, it handles it all for me:)
2011-05-18T21:08:00.000Z	Rich_		The one i want is in there (checksum.h), but its not in my other store (/usr/include).
2011-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	Rich_	TheRedOctober	yeah, this is the 1st time its been very difficult, the other issues were a learning curve.
2011-05-18T21:10:00.000Z	Rich_	TheRedOctober	Have you done much programming with Packets on Ubuntu?
2011-05-18T21:11:00.000Z	TheRedOctober	Rich_	have you tried asking #linux? #ubuntu is more for complaints about unity these days.  I haven't spent time on the lower region of the tcp/ip stack in a decade.
2011-05-18T21:11:00.000Z	Rich_	TheRedOctober	No, actually im new to IRC as well ;
2011-05-18T21:11:00.000Z	Rich_		:)
2011-05-18T21:12:00.000Z	TheRedOctober	Rich_	Try another place, even #Debian would be better.  Best of luck, wish I could help.
2011-05-18T21:12:00.000Z	Rich_	TheRedOctober	Never knew about #linux i may try that next (This is quite busy lol)...... Thx man!!!
