2012-01-06T02:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	mtu 9000 might not work
2012-01-06T02:14:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	I couldn't find the max value for my chipset
2012-01-06T02:14:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	but it is a Gb ethernet NIC.
2012-01-06T02:15:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	it's not just your chipset that needs to support it, the other end also needs to
2012-01-06T02:15:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	oh, there's no issue there. My Airport Base Station and connected Macs, and the unmanaged switch, are all Gb.
2012-01-06T02:16:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	true, all I can say is that my Macs all run with Jumbo frames, going through the switch and the router, and no issues so far.
2012-01-06T02:17:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	ok, then it is probably your chipset indeed, I was just being thorough :)
2012-01-06T02:17:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	appreciated :)
2012-01-06T02:20:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	you wouldn't happen to know an iterative way of determining my chipset's max mtu?
2012-01-06T02:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	I haven't played an awful lot with jumbo frames. Most of my mtu adventures are around broken networks requiring a lower mtu without properly supporting path mtu detection
2012-01-06T02:22:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	ok :)
2012-01-06T02:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	organized trial and error, minimizing the amount of tries
2012-01-06T02:27:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	gotcha.
2012-01-06T02:30:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	increasing the mtu isn't really going to improve speed for many things.
2012-01-06T02:31:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	That's true. But I use my network for a lot of media sharing (movies especially), so i thought it might improve performance and reduce load on the server.
2012-01-06T02:31:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	it definitely won't reduce load. And if your data is on rotating rust, a high mtu won't help
2012-01-06T02:32:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	won't it reduce the number of packets my server has to frame to send large amounts of data?
2012-01-06T02:33:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	for the speeds needed for media sharing, I've found this barely (if at all) noticeable. YMMV
2012-01-06T02:35:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	'can't find the network' sounds like you're doing dhcp and get timeouts. Use static ip addresses :)
2012-01-06T02:39:00.000Z	Kimble	Seveas	dhcp actually works fine, it's when I use the static address with a new MTU that the boot-up stalls.
2012-01-06T02:40:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	always good advice
2012-01-06T02:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	mrtg, cacti, zabbix
2012-01-06T02:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Kimble	though, despite the fact that the "S" in "SNMP" means "Simple", there's not much that's simple about it :P
