2010-07-03T08:59:00.000Z	mirskens		I am having problems with audio on my newly installed Ubuntu. I am using a Sony Vaio and am not getting any audio at all (it worked fine previously in Windows 7). I have tried basic fixes such as adjusting volume levels, using the system controls, etc. Any advice on how I can fix the problem, or, if necessary, switch to an audio driver that Ubuntu can support?
2010-07-03T08:59:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	by chance, is PCM muted?
2010-07-03T09:00:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	you know in windows how in your advanced volume control you have volume in 1 slider, and wav in another slider, and if either is muted, you have ZERO sound?
2010-07-03T09:00:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	thats kind of like PCM/volume in linux. Two individual sliders, both need to be set appropriately or itll be muted.
2010-07-03T09:00:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	its just a quick thought, I have no idea if itll help, but lets make sure... are you on ubuntu 10.04?
2010-07-03T09:01:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	hm, in the GUI I'm not sure where it's located in 10.04. They must have moved it from where I previously remember it.
2010-07-03T09:01:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	open a terminal and type "alsamixer" and hit enter
2010-07-03T09:01:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	you should see several sliders. PCM (for me) is the 2nd slider over. Is it muted?
2010-07-03T09:03:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	what does it say for "master"
2010-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	mirskens	Roasted	master slider says 00 and it has a colored bar running all the way to the top
2010-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	under the PCM slider, there is an icon just above the 100 <> 100 you saw
2010-07-03T09:05:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	itll either say MM, or have a green square with 00 in it. Whcih is it?
2010-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	ah, for me its the opposite - I have nothing for master, but for pcm I have that option. That's probably because pcm may be listed as your primary audio adjustment device.
2010-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	let me think a minute...
2010-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	highlight the master slider, and bring it up to about 30
2010-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	then play some sort of audio and see if you hear output
2010-07-03T09:08:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	is there a "MM" under master?
2010-07-03T09:09:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	and PCM has 00 in the box and is maxed?
2010-07-03T09:09:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	ahhh thats right. I forgot you said that.
2010-07-03T09:10:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	what kind of sound card do you have
2010-07-03T09:12:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	is this a laptop?
2010-07-03T09:13:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	hmm... I'm not too sure bro. All I know to check for is the obvious things (muted, etc) and the PCM + Master, making sure both are NOT muted and both have adequate sound level.
2010-07-03T09:13:00.000Z	Roasted	mirskens	for example, when I hit volume up/down, it changes master. AS a result, I leave PCM maxed @ 100
