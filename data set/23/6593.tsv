2006-03-07T07:28:00.000Z	brianP		is there any way to clear a network interface info from the kernel?  for instance when i'm using my laptop wirelessly and then i suspend it and then take it to school and resume it I can never it get back on the network until i reboot becase it gets stuck with the old info....?
2006-03-07T07:28:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	 ooo don't reboot for that!   sudo ifdown eth0    sudo ifup eth1
2006-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	 ifconfig and ifup/down  will let you see which network interface is running and activate and deactivate
2006-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	brianP	wastrel	ive tried every combination of ifup ifconfig iwconfig....
2006-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	 so what happens?
2006-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	brianP		it just plain gets stuck
2006-03-07T07:30:00.000Z	brianP		i need a way to clear the interface cache from the kernel
2006-03-07T07:30:00.000Z	brianP	wastrel	when i do ifup it says network down
2006-03-07T07:31:00.000Z	brianP		ifconfig shows that it still has the old ip
2006-03-07T07:31:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	 you're talking about using the same wifi for school and home?  heh sry i wasn't thinking....
2006-03-07T07:31:00.000Z	brianP		even setting the ip to one that i know is on the same network doesnt help
2006-03-07T07:31:00.000Z	brianP	wastrel	yeah wifi
2006-03-07T07:32:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	you probably need to call the dhcp server
2006-03-07T07:32:00.000Z	wastrel		er client
2006-03-07T07:32:00.000Z	brianP	wastrel	yeah ifup does that
2006-03-07T07:32:00.000Z	brianP		but it can't seem to talk to the dhcp server
2006-03-07T07:33:00.000Z	brianP		i hate having to reboot, but its the only thing that fixes it
2006-03-07T07:33:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	 have you tried reloading the kernel module for your wifi card
2006-03-07T07:34:00.000Z	brianP	wastrel	no i have the module compiled in
2006-03-07T07:35:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	 how about clearing the routing table and/or arp cache?
2006-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	brianP	wastrel	how do you that ?
2006-03-07T07:37:00.000Z	wastrel	brianP	 route del  for removing routes.  (just route will show the current kernel routing table)
2006-03-07T07:37:00.000Z	brianP	wastrel	ok cool i'll try that
