2010-11-11T10:02:00.000Z	zed_		any help with my problem? I tried to install Ubuntu 10.10, got to the Ubuntu screen with 5 red & white dots, then got a black screen, and nothing happens!
2010-11-11T10:02:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	X session failed to load
2010-11-11T10:03:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	what do you mean?
2010-11-11T10:03:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	are you on a seperat computer from the one that failed to load?
2010-11-11T10:03:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	yes
2010-11-11T10:04:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	on the computer that failed to load fully press ctrl+alt+F1
2010-11-11T10:06:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	does it put you at a terminal?
2010-11-11T10:06:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	it's rebooting now, one moment
2010-11-11T10:07:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	no, no change
2010-11-11T10:08:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	so when it stalls you cant press that button set to get a terminal... that stinks
2010-11-11T10:08:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	how old is the machine you are trying to install 10.10 on?
2010-11-11T10:09:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	brand new, I did install windows 7 on a seperate partition
2010-11-11T10:10:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	just so I can be clear you are trying to run the live boot and not the installer directly right?
2010-11-11T10:11:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	sorry, what do you mean?  I downloaded the iso, put it into my computer, restarted, and it came up with the ubuntu logo and then a black screen
2010-11-11T10:12:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	when the disk first starts to load it should have options " try Ubuntu without making changes" or "install ubuntu now"
2010-11-11T10:12:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	did you just let it run out the timer?
2010-11-11T10:13:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	no it just comes up with the ubuntu logo and the 5 dots
2010-11-11T10:13:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	it starts with a little cannonical logo down the bottom, then the ubuntu logo
2010-11-11T10:14:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	I tried the i386 iso, but it didn't boot off of that
2010-11-11T10:15:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	well 10.04 is still out there and its the LTS "long Tearm Support" release you may have better luck with it
2010-11-11T10:16:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	alright I'll have a look, thanks for your time
2010-11-11T10:16:00.000Z	dustin_	zed_	no prob
2010-11-11T10:24:00.000Z	zed_	dustin_	hey, thought I'd let you know the USB method worked - I think my laptop has a dodgy burner
