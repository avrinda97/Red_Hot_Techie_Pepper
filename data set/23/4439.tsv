2007-12-24T02:17:00.000Z	DarKMode		what can i do
2007-12-24T02:17:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	to restart the sshd?
2007-12-24T02:17:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
2007-12-24T02:19:00.000Z	DarKMode	scguy318	the problem that in connected to this server with ssh when i killed the sshd i deconnected
2007-12-24T02:20:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	oh...
2007-12-24T02:21:00.000Z	DarKMode	scguy318	 what can do
2007-12-24T02:21:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	you'll probably have to restart it at the console of the remote machine or gain some other way of access, unfortunately
2007-12-24T02:22:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	how did you kill it anyway? I get an operation not permitted when I try to kill the sshd running on this machine
2007-12-24T02:22:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	has to be done as root
2007-12-24T02:23:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	well, I'm thinking you're a bit out of luck unless you have some other way of connecting in or actually restart it at the physical console
2007-12-24T02:24:00.000Z	DarKMode	scguy318	i have http access i put some kind of php shell console and i have the access with apache
2007-12-24T02:25:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	if you could, you could try restarting through those interfaces, but yeah
2007-12-24T02:25:00.000Z	DarKMode	scguy318	 i try this command  echo "pass" | sudo -u root -S /etc/init.d/sshd restart but dont work
2007-12-24T02:26:00.000Z	DarKMode	scguy318	 i try this command  echo "pass" | sudo -u root -S /etc/init.d/sshd restart but deosnt work
2007-12-24T02:27:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	mm, why the -S?
2007-12-24T02:28:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	unfortunately I wouldn't know too much :(
2007-12-24T02:28:00.000Z	DarKMode	scguy318	 -S  The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal device.
2007-12-24T02:29:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	ah
2007-12-24T02:30:00.000Z	DarKMode	scguy318	apache@myserver:>su   standard in must be a tty 
2007-12-24T02:32:00.000Z	scguy318	DarKMode	restate your question, someone else might have a better idea than I
