2008-09-11T14:12:00.000Z	koshari	waan	aaaahhh ati sucks with compiz
2008-09-11T14:13:00.000Z	waan	koshari	it works fine for me
2008-09-14T10:04:00.000Z	koshari	waan	thats what a swap file is
2008-09-14T10:05:00.000Z	waan	koshari	ok to be specific I'm using vbox to install a guest operating system, but when the physical memory gets really low vbox will abort, I've solved this temporarily by reducing the guest os ram amount.
2008-09-14T10:06:00.000Z	waan	koshari	but vbox doesn't seem to be utilizing swap
2008-09-14T10:06:00.000Z	koshari	waan	what guest OS are you using?
2008-09-14T10:07:00.000Z	waan	koshari	windows xp, i've set 64mb
2008-09-14T10:07:00.000Z	koshari	waan	winXP will use a pagefile that will be on the virtual disk
2008-09-14T10:07:00.000Z	koshari	waan	however when it comes to ram you cant gt something for nothing
2008-09-14T10:08:00.000Z	waan	koshari	it's only a problem during the installer (which is is past now) and the memory has spiked back up to a large free amount
2008-09-14T10:09:00.000Z	waan	koshari	thanks for the help, i'll just use low ram amounts for vbox and it should be ok
2008-09-14T10:11:00.000Z	waan	koshari	anyway it's more a vbox bug, since it was trying to use more physical memory than the system had
2008-09-14T10:11:00.000Z	koshari	waan	well that will do it
2008-09-14T10:12:00.000Z	waan	koshari	do you happen to know the minimum ram required for intrepid?
2008-09-14T10:12:00.000Z	koshari	waan	otherwise you could disable a few services in the guest
2008-09-14T10:13:00.000Z	koshari	waan	 i suspect 8.10 would be about the same as 8.04
2008-09-14T10:13:00.000Z	waan	koshari	yeah i'll do that, but installing the os is where the ram usage goes through the roof
2008-09-14T10:14:00.000Z	waan	koshari	anyway I'll work it out. Thanks again
2008-09-14T10:14:00.000Z	koshari	waan	you could use an alternative install disk for ubuntu as a guest
2008-10-01T15:55:00.000Z	koshari	waan	the symlink will be backed up but not the stuff at the destination
2008-10-01T15:55:00.000Z	waan	koshari	I could use a follow symlinks copy though right?
2008-10-01T15:56:00.000Z	koshari	waan	no you wiill only copy the actual symlikk if you did a cp -R
2008-10-01T15:57:00.000Z	waan	koshari	ok no biggie themes I can forget about, i'll keep the installers in a hidden directory
