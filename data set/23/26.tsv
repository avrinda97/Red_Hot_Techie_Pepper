2012-11-12T05:24:00.000Z	unclezipper		Hey, is there anyone here that can help me out? I'm having a small issue with OpenSSH.
2012-11-12T05:25:00.000Z	DarKMode	unclezipper	come on just ask
2012-11-12T05:26:00.000Z	unclezipper	DarKMode	Ok, well I've researched the problem for several hours and come up with nothing. I'm running Ubuntu Server and I've been trying to use password authentication instead of keys
2012-11-12T05:27:00.000Z	unclezipper		I've edited sshd_config in several places, but I still get an error message(and no password prompt) when I try to connect.
2012-11-12T05:28:00.000Z	DarKMode	unclezipper	what happen then . the system just let you in or what ?
2012-11-12T05:28:00.000Z	unclezipper		I don't know what the issue is exactly. I just upgraded servers, and on my old one I was running Linux Mint 11. OpenSSH was configured to use password authentication out of the box, and now I simply can't get it to work
2012-11-12T05:28:00.000Z	unclezipper		Let me c+p the message I get.
2012-11-12T05:28:00.000Z	DarKMode		ok
2012-11-12T05:29:00.000Z	unclezipper		~ $ ssh dustin@192.168.0.102

2012-11-12T05:29:00.000Z	unclezipper		IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
2012-11-12T05:29:00.000Z	unclezipper		Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
2012-11-12T05:30:00.000Z	DarKMode		hehe
2012-11-12T05:30:00.000Z	unclezipper		Well I suppose it's obvious that I'm new here :P
2012-11-12T05:31:00.000Z	DarKMode	unclezipper	this is normal after reinstalation
2012-11-12T05:31:00.000Z	unclezipper		How should I fix it? I've already restarted the SSH server
2012-11-12T05:31:00.000Z	DarKMode	unclezipper	try typing
2012-11-12T05:32:00.000Z	DarKMode	unclezipper	cd .ssh
2012-11-12T05:32:00.000Z	DarKMode		in you local machine
2012-11-12T05:33:00.000Z	unclezipper		I see a file called known_hosts
2012-11-12T05:33:00.000Z	DarKMode	unclezipper	then echo "" > known_hosts
