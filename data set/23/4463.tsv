2007-08-06T05:24:00.000Z	centaur5		What is the command to login to a broken system after booting into a live cd on that machine?
2007-08-06T05:25:00.000Z	mr_dude	centaur5	What's broken about your system?
2007-08-06T05:26:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	fsck found errors but said that there's a package called less missing so it doesn't proceed with repair (I think that's what stops it).
2007-08-06T05:30:00.000Z	mr_dude		centaur, You can boot into safe mode from the GRUB at the beginning.
2007-08-06T05:32:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	tried that and fsck starts scanning again and I can't even get an ip address from my network to install the missing applications it complains about.
2007-08-06T05:34:00.000Z	mr_dude	centaur5	less is a simple little console application that let's you view page by page information in a file, that's a weird error.
2007-08-06T05:34:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	It's been over a year since I've had my system broken to where it wouldn't boot and I came across a howto on logging into the broken system from a live cd to run commands on that installation.
2007-08-06T05:34:00.000Z	mr_dude		less comes with ubuntu by default.
2007-08-06T05:35:00.000Z	mr_dude	centaur5	What did you do to cause this error or did it just happen out of no where?
2007-08-06T05:35:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	I figured it's supposed to already be on there as well.
2007-08-06T05:36:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	Well I haven't had my machine on for 2 days but the last thing I was doing was using the live cd to transfer files off my hd to a sd card.
2007-08-06T05:37:00.000Z	mr_dude	centaur5	Why were you using the live cd and not just booting unto  your hard disk?
2007-08-06T05:38:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	Cause I'm using gutsy and it doesn't automatically mount sd cards anymore so I manually mounted my sd card and transferred some things to it but then it wouldn't unmount so I couldn't switch to use my 2nd sd card so I booted into the live cd to finish the job.
2007-08-06T05:40:00.000Z	mr_dude		centaur, Weird, heh.  Yeah, I'd search around about making recovery CD's, and the file to edit to skip the fsck scan.
2007-08-06T05:41:00.000Z	mr_dude		centaur, I am pretty sure there's a console recovery mode where you got line by line of your boot up and it asks you yes/no whether or not you want to perform that command.
2007-08-06T05:41:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	perhaps funning fsck from the live cd and having it finish the job that way will fix it?
2007-08-06T05:43:00.000Z	mr_dude	centaur5	Couldn't hurt.
2007-08-06T05:44:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	Okay, I'll try that real quick and see where that gets me. I've been running a long time without a non-bootable machine even with alfa and beta installs.  :)
2007-08-06T05:46:00.000Z	mr_dude		centaur, Good luck.
2007-08-06T05:47:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	that fixed it. thanks for your help!
2007-08-06T05:48:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	The only error found by fsck was that there were large files in the file system but no support for them was enabled.
2007-08-06T05:48:00.000Z	mr_dude		centaur, You figured it out on your own, I was just a sounding board.  ;)
2007-08-06T05:49:00.000Z	centaur5	mr_dude	Well I needed an audience while I thought out loud.  :)
