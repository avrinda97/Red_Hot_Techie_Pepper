2008-03-11T10:59:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	no
2008-03-11T11:00:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	oh, i thought there was an LTS -> LTS upgrade path
2008-03-11T11:00:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	it doesnt work like that ..
2008-03-11T11:01:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	pity
2008-03-11T11:01:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	dapper -> edgy -> feisty -> gusty -> hardy
2008-03-11T11:01:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	what about servers where you only want to run LTS?  reinstall ?
2008-03-11T11:02:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	or delpoy a new server ?

2008-03-11T11:12:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	what do u wanna tell me?
2008-03-11T11:12:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	it looks like it is in planning
2008-03-11T11:13:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	it's a blueprint, havent been implemented yet
2008-03-11T11:14:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	yes.  Now instead of saying "no you can't" you can tell people that it will hopefully be supported in the future
2008-03-11T11:14:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	that'd just confuse ppl
2008-03-11T11:15:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	no it won't
2008-03-11T11:15:00.000Z	linuxboy	[Hardy]TuTUXG	it's better then misinforming people
2008-03-11T11:15:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	if u think u r misinformed by me, im sorry
2008-03-11T11:16:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	linuxboy	however i won't change my answer for that question unless it's official confirmed
