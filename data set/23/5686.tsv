2006-11-02T13:45:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		so does anyone know how I can install something with apt-get when it tells me that some other app has an unmet dependancy ?  and how can I permanently get rid of the warning, when the package it wants is not needed and doesn't exist, heh
2006-11-02T13:46:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	this fixes the dependencies: sudo apt-get install -f
2006-11-02T13:52:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	this ignores any packages not installed, it's man apt-get: sudo apt-get install -m package-name
2006-11-02T13:59:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	thank you, I will give that a try
2006-11-02T14:03:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	oops, that last line I said was for you: I tried both "apt-get install -m netpbm" and "apt-get -m install netpbm", but neither tried to install it, it just complained about the opera package not having its non-existant dependancy
2006-11-02T14:04:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	it got lost in the flood of chat in here, heh.
2006-11-02T14:59:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	try download package libqt3-mt
2006-11-02T14:05:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	remove the opera package, and install it again with automatix
2006-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	I have never heard of automatix, will look it up
2006-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	look about the warning they all say in !automatix :P
2006-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	just read that warning, heh
2006-11-02T14:09:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	if you're still with 6.06 better forget about automatix, i heard it really is breaking stuff, can you tell me the name of the package you can't find?
2006-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	nothlit: opera: Depends: xlib6g (>= 3.3.6) but it is not installable or xlibs but it is not installable
2006-11-02T14:17:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	try from deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free
2006-11-02T14:21:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	he's in console, can't do that
2006-11-02T14:22:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	I know, I was explaining how to get back to IRC once their X is started
2006-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	can you tell me the broken dependency package again?
2006-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	opera: Depends: xlib6g (>= 3.3.6) but it is not installable or xlibs but it is not installable
2006-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	and that package is a dummy placeholder package, used to transition to a new package with Xorg 7.x (as far as I remember, when I looked it up before)
2006-11-02T14:50:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	have you read this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
2006-11-02T15:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	libqt3-mt is already the newest version.
2006-11-02T15:03:00.000Z	savvas	Samus_Aran	are you dapper drake release client RC or long term support LTS?
2006-11-02T15:04:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	savvas	I installed the official 6.06 version just after it was released, to a clean partition (switched from Arch Linux in June)
