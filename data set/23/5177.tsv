2007-01-29T15:20:00.000Z	aalhamad_	psh	thanks for the comment .. and your help
2007-01-29T15:23:00.000Z	psh	aalhamad_	remember that testing your firewall if you are behind router is useless, you need to be connected directly to the internet
2007-01-29T15:25:00.000Z	aalhamad_		its sudo iptables -L
2007-01-29T15:25:00.000Z	aalhamad_	psh	its sudo iptables -L  (sometimes people can say i dont know)
2007-01-29T15:27:00.000Z	aalhamad_	psh	you should resive something like this # iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
