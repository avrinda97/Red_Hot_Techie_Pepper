2007-06-18T07:55:00.000Z	alduin		Whenever I boot, my X server complains that the nvidia kernel module isn't the same version as the X server module.  If I do a manual install of the nvidia drivers downloaded from nvidia.com it works until I reboot.  Anyone know what packages I need to re-install to get all the version numbers synced up so I don't have to re-install the drivers every time I boot? =P

2007-06-18T07:57:00.000Z	alduin	wols	well, two are at 1.0.9631, the other is 20051028+1ubuntu7.
2007-06-18T07:58:00.000Z	alduin	wols	and it doesn't look like there's a newer version of nvidia-kernel-common (the one with the odd version).
2007-06-18T07:59:00.000Z	wols	alduin	use the 97.55 driver
2007-06-18T08:00:00.000Z	wols	alduin	apt-cache search nvidia
2007-06-18T08:01:00.000Z	alduin	wols	I assume that's the nvidia-glx-new?
2007-06-18T08:02:00.000Z	wols	alduin	what version is your kernel module?
2007-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	alduin	wols	Not sure... how do I find out?
2007-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	wols	alduin	I already told you with dpkg -l
2007-06-18T08:03:00.000Z	alduin	wols	then I already told you, too. =)  20051028+1ubuntu7
2007-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	wols	alduin	no you did not. that's not a kernel driver
2007-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	alduin	wols	only nvidia kernel things I've got installed are nvidia-kernel-common and nvidia-kernel-source.  The source matches up with the 9631 version, but that's just the source.  It's not compiled.
2007-06-18T08:05:00.000Z	wols	alduin	well, what do you expect then? how could it work without having a kernel module?
2007-06-18T08:06:00.000Z	alduin	wols	... that's kinda what I was hoping to get some help on.  As it stands, I have to manually re-install the kernel driver from nvidia's install script every time I reboot.  I'd like to avoid that.
2007-06-18T08:06:00.000Z	wols	alduin	I asked you to run a command modinfo
2007-06-18T08:07:00.000Z	alduin	wols	I don't have that in my scrollback.  Could you repost that line?

2007-06-18T08:09:00.000Z	wols	alduin	you can simply add "nvidia" (without the quotes) into /etc/modules
2007-06-18T08:10:00.000Z	wols	alduin	however: that will break when you upgrade your kernel or your X since oyu haven't isntalled the driver properly
2007-06-18T08:11:00.000Z	alduin	wols	I'm pretty sure that's the situation I'm in now, since the problem started when the last kernel update came out.  Which ubuntu package provides the kernel module that matches the X driver I'm using?
2007-06-18T08:14:00.000Z	wols	alduin	I told you to compile it
2007-06-18T08:15:00.000Z	alduin	wols	... Pidgin must be doing something odd, because I didn't see that, either.
