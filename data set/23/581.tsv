2011-05-26T15:06:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	you write so much I couldn't even figure your problem
2011-05-26T15:06:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	just give a short description of the problem again
2011-05-26T15:09:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	Yep, so now first you need to know what happened. Can you start your ubuntu in save mode?
2011-05-26T15:10:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	if not, get a live usb key boot with it and chroot into your system
2011-05-26T15:11:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	okay, I would go the usb route. You have to know which partitions are used for your system. Do you have one partition plus swap?
2011-05-26T15:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	imagine you have a root-partion and a /boot partion, you start live system, you mount your root part. somewhere ( e.g. sudo mount /dev/sdx /mnt ), you mount your boot partition ( e.g. mount /dev/sdx2 /mnt/boot ), you chroot into it ( chroot /mnt ) and then you can check your system
2011-05-26T15:15:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	yes
2011-05-26T16:01:00.000Z	guglu	schnuffle	when i boot in recovery mode this is the last line where it freezes on "internal journal on sda5:8"
2011-05-26T16:03:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	only idea i have is the live usb thing I told you
2011-05-26T16:08:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	normally apt-get upgrade doesn't cause any problems
2011-05-26T18:47:00.000Z	guglu	schnuffle	would you like to tell me ?
2011-05-26T18:49:00.000Z	schnuffle	guglu	to find out you'll have to do the chroot stuff I told you hours ago, Maybe your harddisk fucked up
2011-05-26T18:50:00.000Z	guglu	schnuffle	i think reinstalling would be better than that
