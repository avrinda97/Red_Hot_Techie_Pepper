2011-09-09T15:08:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	is xfce like gnome 2?
2011-09-09T15:08:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	i find it better, but that is a matter of personal taste
2011-09-09T15:10:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	even i'm looking for a unity alternative for oneric, so i was asking
2011-09-09T15:11:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	try out different desktop environments (gnom3 unity kde xfce lxde enlightenment) see what you like
2011-09-09T15:12:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	just been 5 months with linux.... seems risky :|
2011-09-09T15:12:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	you'll get the hang of it, try them in virtualbox vms
2011-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	virtualbox... never used it... can u link me to a good tutorial.. ?
2011-09-17T18:15:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	that will break your system
2011-09-17T18:15:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	:(
2011-09-17T18:15:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	will it replace the old software center?
2011-09-17T18:15:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	i assume so
2011-09-17T18:18:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	not sure via software centre, but you can do it on website or even on irc
2011-09-17T18:18:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	see the size there?
2011-09-17T18:20:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	i do the website thing currently, but it is very irritating visiting each website, what's the point of the software center then?
2011-09-17T18:20:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	i've never used the software centre (i use synaptic)
2011-09-17T18:21:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	thanx for the irc tip, so can i use this command in any channel or only in ubuntu channel?
2011-09-17T18:21:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	you'd have to add lucid at the end, otherwise it shows the latest releases repo (natty)
2011-09-17T18:22:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	i'd open a chat with ubottu, that way you won't disturb the channel
2011-09-17T18:22:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	/msg ubottu bot
2011-09-17T18:23:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	then type the commands to ubottu
2011-09-17T18:24:00.000Z	ssk_the_gr8	auronandace	thanx a lot, i'm willing to live with this temporary solution
2011-09-17T18:24:00.000Z	auronandace	ssk_the_gr8	no worries :)
