2009-10-13T05:14:00.000Z	RegressLess		does anyone know how to edit the keyring settings?

2009-10-13T05:17:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	can you be more specific? I tried alt-f2 and got an error
2009-10-13T05:18:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	If you've got "Passwords and Encryption Keys" in Administration or Preferences, use that.
2009-10-13T05:19:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	I believe it's the same thing. The name may be slightly different; I'm on Linux Mint.
2009-10-13T05:26:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	I have Encryption and Keyrings, but I don't get it. In the Encryption tab, there's a drop-down for Default Key, but it only has one choice: "None. Prompt for a key." Then there's a checkbox that says " When encrypting, always include myself as a recipient, which is checked. On the PGP Passphrases tab, it says Remember PGP Passphrases, but then it says "A supported PGP passphrase caching agent is not running."
2009-10-13T05:26:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	What exactly are you trying to do?
2009-10-13T05:28:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	my wireless network is password protected. When I first set up ubuntu it asked if I wanted to add it to the keyring, so I agreed. Now, every time I log in, I have to enter the keyring password. It's driving me mad.
2009-10-13T05:29:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	You set the password in the first place, correct?
2009-10-13T05:29:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	yes
2009-10-13T05:32:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	This may or may not work, but have a look at http://www.goitexpert.com/general/disable-login-to-wireless-wifi-in-ubuntu/

2009-10-13T05:37:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	The first link looks promising. brb
2009-10-13T05:51:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	that didn't work, I'll try the next.
2009-10-13T06:27:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	Disable SpeedStep/whatever AMD has.
2009-10-13T06:28:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	eh? It's an intell and I don't follow ya.
2009-10-13T06:28:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	Disable SpeedStep in the BIOS, then.
2009-10-13T06:36:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	yeeeeaaah... I don't see that option. Under CPU Configuration, I have one option: "Max CPUID Value Set <Enabled>". Perhaps I should mention it's an EeePC with the array.org kernel. I'll try searching array.org.
2009-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	Similar issue: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7910689
2009-10-13T06:42:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	the eepc bios are pretty different than normal bios. I've been all over'em and there is no SpeedStep, which is the only suggestion given in that thread. It is an an Atom. It's probably the special kernel from array.org.
2009-10-13T06:43:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	I suppose so.
2009-10-13T06:43:00.000Z	k0nane	RegressLess	Regardless, it -is- related to power management. =P
2009-10-13T06:43:00.000Z	RegressLess	k0nane	fair enough
