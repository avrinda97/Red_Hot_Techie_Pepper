2007-02-18T12:04:00.000Z	Hedegaard		how do I get my open programs to be listed in the top bar instead of the bar in the bottom of the screen ?
2007-02-18T12:05:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	open programs?
2007-02-18T12:05:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	 yes as in eg. firefox, xchat and so on ...
2007-02-18T12:06:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	great!! :) that easy ... thanks a bunch
2007-02-18T12:07:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	or you can create a new window list by right mouse buttoning an empty bit of panel and going to add to panel...
2007-02-18T12:07:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	is it possible to make the topbar 2 lines instead of one ?
2007-02-18T12:07:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	sort of
2007-02-18T12:07:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	you can set a panel's width and height
2007-02-18T12:08:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	but not two lines ... with width and height it only makes the line bigger
2007-02-18T12:08:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	you need your panel to be bigger
2007-02-18T12:08:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	but what in particular did you want on two lines?
2007-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	everything in the top panel or just a particular thing?
2007-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	the programs listed in two lines, i tend to have a lot of open programs and it's very difficult to overview with just one line
2007-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	that's doable
2007-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	it will happen "by magic" if the panel itself is tall enough
2007-02-18T12:12:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	brilliant! :) thanks! :)
2007-02-18T12:12:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	as you've noticed, not everything will go on to two lines...
2007-02-18T12:13:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	no that's perfect :)
2007-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	one last panel question - is there a way to resize the bottom one so it's not 100% width ?
2007-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	yes?
2007-02-18T12:20:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	find an empty bit of panel and press the right mouse button
2007-02-18T12:20:00.000Z	sits	Hedegaard	untick Expand
2007-02-18T12:20:00.000Z	Hedegaard	sits	agh! :) sorry ... should have seen that :) thanks again
