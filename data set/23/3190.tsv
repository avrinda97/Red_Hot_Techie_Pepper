2008-09-16T00:35:00.000Z	tehboriz		hay guys i'm looking for a SIMPLE distro to be used on my homeserver
2008-09-16T00:35:00.000Z	tehboriz		i've got xp on it right now and i'm hating.
2008-09-16T00:35:00.000Z	tehboriz		i wanna have apache with php kind of stuff
2008-09-16T00:35:00.000Z	tehboriz		not sure what linux uses
2008-09-16T00:36:00.000Z	tehboriz		vnc is a must
2008-09-16T00:36:00.000Z	tehboriz		it's gotta have amazing start up time
2008-09-16T00:37:00.000Z	tehboriz		something that I think it can accomplish
2008-09-16T00:37:00.000Z	tehboriz		oh lol that's good
2008-09-16T00:38:00.000Z	tehboriz		i've got barely any linux experience
2008-09-16T00:39:00.000Z	tehboriz		would i be able to set up apache?
2008-09-16T00:39:00.000Z	yoyoned	tehboriz	apache works out of the box for most distros including ubuntu server
2008-09-16T00:40:00.000Z	tehboriz	yoyoned	does ubuntu start up fast
2008-09-16T00:41:00.000Z	tehboriz		what the hell is red hat
2008-09-16T00:41:00.000Z	yoyoned	tehboriz	fast is relative.  should start in about 30 seconds, but start up time souldn't be an issue when considering a server.  Uptime is more important
2008-09-16T00:41:00.000Z	tehboriz		well hiptobecubic obviously windows isn't great for servers
2008-09-16T00:42:00.000Z	tehboriz		it uses up unnecessary cpu usage, and my apache php module is broken
2008-09-16T00:42:00.000Z	tehboriz		i must have it fixed
2008-09-16T00:42:00.000Z	yoyoned	tehboriz	what are you moving from
2008-09-16T00:42:00.000Z	tehboriz		cause i needed some experience with servers
2008-09-16T00:42:00.000Z	tehboriz	yoyoned	i have xp right now... very embarassing
2008-09-16T00:42:00.000Z	tehboriz		i'm thinking of moving to ubuntu server
2008-09-16T00:43:00.000Z	yoyoned	tehboriz	it's not hard.  If you hava apache running under XP, it will be a breeze under ubuntu
2008-09-16T00:43:00.000Z	tehboriz	yoyoned	thanks
