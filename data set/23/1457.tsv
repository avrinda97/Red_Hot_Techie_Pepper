2010-07-06T10:35:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	do you plan to let anonymous users access the system?
2010-07-06T10:36:00.000Z	[Screamo]		yea
2010-07-06T10:36:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	or is this for only people with actual user accounts?
2010-07-06T10:36:00.000Z	[Screamo]		its for my local (4) comp house network =/
2010-07-06T10:36:00.000Z	[Screamo]		security is not an issue
2010-07-06T10:36:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	then anonymous users are not necessary
2010-07-06T10:37:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	will you be the only one accessing it? or other people, too?
2010-07-06T10:37:00.000Z	[Screamo]		other people (family members)
2010-07-06T10:37:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	so create accounts for them on the Ubuntu machine and use SFTP
2010-07-06T10:38:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	SFTP is a no-brainer install and setup.
2010-07-06T10:38:00.000Z	[Screamo]	mneptok	i want something easy!
2010-07-06T10:38:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	SFTP is far, far easier to set up than is FTP
2010-07-06T10:39:00.000Z	mneptok	[Screamo]	alternatively, install thttpd and just let everyone access it via a web browser
