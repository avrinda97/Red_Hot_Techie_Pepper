2010-01-04T10:09:00.000Z	p1und3r		does anyone know how i can force ubuntu to boot to tty rather than gui?
2010-01-04T10:09:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	don't use gdm
2010-01-04T10:10:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	where can i specify that? i'm looking in startup applications
2010-01-04T10:10:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	it's a daemon, install something like rcconf to change it
2010-01-04T10:13:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	when i run rcconf, gdm isn't enabled
2010-01-04T10:14:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	you could just aptitude remove gdm
2010-01-04T10:14:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	im setting up an ubuntu server for the first time and i wanna use tty but im still new and wanna keep the safety of gnome
2010-01-04T10:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	you can keep gnome
2010-01-04T10:15:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	the only way i know how to start gnome is /etc/init.d/gdm start
2010-01-04T10:15:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	sounds like removing gdm removes that too
2010-01-04T10:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	it would, but you could aptitude install gdm if you wanted it back
2010-01-04T10:16:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	rather than that i thought there would be a nice little config file somewhere oh well, ill hafta research
2010-01-04T10:16:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	gdm should be listed in rcconf if it's running
2010-01-04T10:16:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	it's listed but it isn't checked
2010-01-04T10:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	try sysv-rc-conf
2010-01-04T10:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	it's like rcconf but a little more advanced
2010-01-04T10:19:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	gdm is again listed with nothing enabled for it at all levels
2010-01-04T10:19:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	weird :O
2010-01-04T10:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	hmm.. and it does boot to the graphical login when you restart?
2010-01-04T10:19:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	yeah im gunna reboot again and see wut happens
2010-01-04T10:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	p1und3r	k
2010-01-04T10:20:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	yeah just booted in to x
2010-01-04T10:20:00.000Z	p1und3r	blakkheim	maybe if i disable "X11-common" ?
