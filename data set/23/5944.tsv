2011-04-30T10:33:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	it says the hardware is insufficient, but it is a nvidia quadro. And it runs gnome 2.
2011-04-30T10:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	ok is that a new card or?
2011-04-30T10:33:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	yes, brand new
2011-04-30T10:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	is a propritary driver installed?
2011-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	well, yes
2011-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	also your card may be to new for Unity
2011-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	oh
2011-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	well the 3D version of it, Unity 2D well of course not
2011-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	is there a list of supported cards?
2011-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	ok so it says the driver is installed, but not activiated? in additional drivers?
2011-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	no, the driver is running fine
2011-04-30T10:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	in general Linux distro's work best with not to old, and not to new hardware
2011-04-30T10:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	and you get an error message when trying to load Unity?
2011-04-30T10:35:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	yes, that error message appears in a GTK dialog at login
2011-04-30T10:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	ok if you remove the propritary driver,  an experimetnal 3D driver is probablay available and it may work with that.  or just use Unity 2D or Gnome Shell from the ppa instead or something :)
2011-04-30T10:36:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	ok
2011-04-30T10:36:00.000Z	AlbertoP		thank you

2011-04-30T10:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!unity  | AlbertoP
2011-04-30T10:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	AlbertoP	thought Unity factoid might have mentioned 2D version, hadn't seen it yet
2011-04-30T10:38:00.000Z	AlbertoP	sebsebseb	yeah, I know... the "fork" story was everywhere ;-)
