2007-04-01T15:13:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	try sudo update-manager -d
2007-04-01T15:15:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	use your user password... NOT a root password
2007-04-01T15:16:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	 okay try sudo passwd root
2007-04-01T15:20:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	download a feisty cd and do a vanilla install then, sorry
2007-04-01T15:21:00.000Z	ric1	mon^rch	what did you just tell me to do?
2007-04-01T15:22:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	you should probably download the feisty .iso, burnit and install it that way. okay?
2007-04-01T15:23:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	I can give you the link if you want
2007-04-01T15:24:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ubuntu-7.04-beta-desktop-i386.iso save that file
2007-04-01T15:25:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	that's wht I'm helping you with
2007-04-01T15:26:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	most of the time it's alot easier to just reinstall than to upgrade and risk mucking things up
2007-04-01T15:27:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	you DONT want to use a root password with ubuntu, use the "sudo" command instead
2007-04-01T15:28:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	sounds to me like you've forgotten your password...
2007-04-01T15:30:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	provided you dont forget it, yes
2007-04-01T15:31:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	is the caps lock on?
2007-04-01T15:35:00.000Z	mon^rch	ric1	good luck changing the password if you've forgotten the one for sudo...
