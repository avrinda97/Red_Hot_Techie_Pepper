2009-02-07T01:18:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Did you do a crc check on the disc, assuming it's an Ubuntu iso?
2009-02-07T01:11:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	What could be wrong is a corrupt cd, or a faulty cd-rom drive.
2009-02-07T01:12:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	this is the second CD..the first one had the same mistake, and the cd-rom drive should actually be fine, hang on, i'll try another drive
2009-02-07T01:17:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	same error with another drive :-/ and it's the second CD. burnt the first one with maximum speed, and this one with 8x.
2009-02-07T01:19:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	how do i do that? :)
2009-02-07T01:19:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Boot off the cd, there's a cd check in the menu.. should be anyways, assuming you have the desktop version.
2009-02-07T01:20:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Or what guntbert referenced.
2009-02-07T01:22:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	when i do the check of the cd, i get the same error like trying to install :O
2009-02-07T01:23:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Oh dear, sounds like you need to go the md5checksum route then :/
2009-02-07T01:24:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	the md5sums are the same. what am i doing wrong here :S
2009-02-07T01:25:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Sounds like your drive might be on the fritz.
2009-02-07T01:26:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Um, or possibly your drives don't like your cd-rs..
2009-02-07T01:26:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	could be the drive with which i am burning the cd :S could i compare the burnt cd somehow?
2009-02-07T01:26:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Could be that, sure.
2009-02-07T01:27:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	is there a way to check the burnt cd?
2009-02-07T01:27:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	I'm fresh out of ideas, short of a) finding different cd-rs to burn to and.or burning the iso with another drive (at slowest speed).
2009-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	should i burn the CD, Disc-At-Once or Track-At-Once?
2009-02-07T01:36:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Disc-at-once.
2009-02-07T01:36:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Be sure to close the session.
2009-02-07T01:36:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	okay. i'll try to burn on another pc.
2009-02-07T02:42:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	aw god. now i was burning the cd on another notebook. the software got stuck at the end. so i rebooted and took out the cd. and of course it doesnt work :( the 3rd useless CD-R today.
2009-02-07T02:43:00.000Z	blizzle	Tobias2200	Not your lucky day it seems :/
2009-02-07T02:44:00.000Z	Tobias2200	blizzle	can i "uniso" the iso with winrar, and burn it onto a DVD-RW? (i dont want to burn another CD-R) or do i need a special boot sector file or something?
