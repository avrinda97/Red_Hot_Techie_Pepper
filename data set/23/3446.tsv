2010-12-14T22:48:00.000Z	salil		Hi Does anyone know of a screen sharing+control tool for ubuntu (or linux)?
2010-12-14T22:48:00.000Z	undecim	salil	VNC
2010-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	salil		great will look into them
2010-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	salil		thanks all
2010-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	undecim	salil	I think it al ldepends on what exactly you want to do
2010-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	salil		I want sharing of screen with control..
2010-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	salil		do all of these have control facility?
2010-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	salil		someone else controls your screen
2010-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	undecim	salil	I use x11vnc to do that with my HTPC
2010-12-14T22:50:00.000Z	undecim	salil	though I think Ubuntu has desktop sharing builtin... 1 sec
2010-12-14T22:50:00.000Z	undecim	salil	System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
2010-12-14T22:51:00.000Z	salil	undecim	I don't have that in Maveric
2010-12-14T22:51:00.000Z	salil		k
2010-12-14T22:52:00.000Z	undecim	salil	really? I must have some other package installed...
2010-12-14T22:54:00.000Z	undecim	salil	Looks like it's "vino" is the package giving me that option
2010-12-14T22:54:00.000Z	salil	undecim	k
2010-12-14T22:54:00.000Z	undecim	salil	Install the vino package from the software center or synaptic and you should have that option. Easy to setup
2010-12-14T22:55:00.000Z	salil	undecim	That I believe should give you an exclusive remote desktop session.. not a sharing session
2010-12-14T22:56:00.000Z	undecim	salil	unless I misunderstood what you were asking, this should do what you want. Both the logged in user and the remote user control the same screen
2010-12-14T22:56:00.000Z	salil	undecim	Ok that gets close.. But I still need to share my password or give access.. I can't show or give control to my screen to someone else over chat
2010-12-14T22:57:00.000Z	undecim	salil	With vino you set a different password, or use a push-button-configuration type setup. They don't even need a password to connect, but you have to allow them to connect by click "yes" when they try to connect
2010-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	salil	undecim	k
2010-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	undecim	salil	You can even require both password and confirmation
