2009-03-15T03:51:00.000Z	russia213		Can someone help me with this tutorial? http://djbarney.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/how-to-keep-the-compiz-cube-zoomed-out-and-in-3d/
2009-03-15T03:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 you do have the cube set where it works normally?
2009-03-15T03:54:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	Yes, now I want it so I can stay zoomed out of the cube with out having to old down button 3
2009-03-15T03:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 that guide looks rather straight forwared..you change one section of the xorg.conf then you  rightclick/middkleclick to lock   some how. :) not sure if it works with the newer xorg versions..
2009-03-15T03:55:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	When I opened my xorg.comf file the imput device section wasn't there
2009-03-15T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 yep.. thats because xorg.conf is now very very much auto-configured.
2009-03-15T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 if you had mentioned that earlier :) we would of told ya that. heh
2009-03-15T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 i have machines with totally empty xorg.conf files
2009-03-15T03:56:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	So what do I do?
2009-03-15T03:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 personally i hate the cube.. so i woudlent mess with it
2009-03-15T03:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 or learn how edit the xorg.conf and paste in the proper sections
2009-03-15T03:57:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	I pasted in that section, nothing happened
2009-03-15T03:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 you may need to generate a whole new xorg with some other sections as well.
2009-03-15T03:58:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	How would I do that?
2009-03-15T03:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 or figure out the right  hal stuff to tweak to get that setting enabled.
2009-03-15T03:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 for a nvidia card i use the nvidia-settings tool..  otjher then that.. no idea
2009-03-15T03:59:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	I have an Nvidia card, could you help me?
2009-03-15T03:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 install/run nvidia-settings.. but BACKUP your original xorg.conf first
2009-03-15T04:00:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	How do I back it up? *is a total n00b*
2009-03-15T04:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 i would not get obsessed with the cube then untill you learn some more fundamentals..
2009-03-15T04:01:00.000Z	russia213	Dr_Willis	Would I just copy, rename, and paste somewhere else?
2009-03-15T04:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	 learn to use the command line..  if you break X you wont bea le to use X to 'fix' it
2009-03-15T04:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	russia213	  the proper way to tweak those setting now are via 'hal'   and fdi config files. (somhing ive not used befor eitehr) ---> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=948154
