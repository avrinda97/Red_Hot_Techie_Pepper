2011-10-10T23:15:00.000Z	figure002		hello! i just uninstalled winxp and installed ubuntu 10.10 on a standard PC. But now the PC works very slow, even slower than when it was running winxp. Watching video's on youtube is the worst. And i constantly see high CPU usage. What can i do to make Ubuntu faster?
2011-10-10T23:15:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	what hardware?
2011-10-10T23:16:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	you can't expect a os made in 2011 to be just as light as one made in 1999
2011-10-10T23:16:00.000Z	figure002	MrElendig	i don't know much about the hardware
2011-10-10T23:17:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	open the case and have a look, or check pcuinfo, lspci etc
2011-10-10T23:17:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	also, flash on gnu/linux is really buggy, and the hw acceleration in it is mostly broken
2011-10-10T23:18:00.000Z	figure002	MrElendig	pcuinfo doesn't work

2011-10-10T23:20:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	dpaste.de please

2011-10-10T23:22:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	outch, unicrome
2011-10-10T23:22:00.000Z	figure002	MrElendig	Ben64: what is?
2011-10-10T23:22:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	you can pretty much forget about hw acceleration on that
2011-10-10T23:22:00.000Z	figure002	MrElendig	what's HW acceleration?
2011-10-10T23:22:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	hardware acceleration
2011-10-10T23:25:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	htop, F6 -> sorg by cpu %
2011-10-10T23:27:00.000Z	figure002	MrElendig	i did 'top' a few times, and it was mostly the browser (FF/Chrome) that was eating all CPU during youtubing
2011-10-10T23:28:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	perfectly normal, as I said, flash is .... not good....
2011-10-10T23:28:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	using vlc/mplayer/minitube can make youtube playback a bit less painfully
2011-10-10T23:29:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	that could also be a good solution, eg getting a gts520 if you have a pcie slot
2011-10-10T23:29:00.000Z	figure002	MrElendig	I actually tried Totem with youtube instead, but it was still way too slow
2011-10-10T23:29:00.000Z	MrElendig	figure002	and hope that vdpau actually works for you in flash
2011-10-10T23:30:00.000Z	figure002	MrElendig	ok, so GTS520, will look that up, thanks!
