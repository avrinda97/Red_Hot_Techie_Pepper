2008-08-31T21:05:00.000Z	labanux		I want to upgrade my hardisk from 40GB to 160GB. How can I move my system from 2nd partition in 40GB disk to 1st partition in 160GB disk?
2008-08-31T21:06:00.000Z	labanux		I've all my best configuration in my recent system, so how can I have this system on the new hardrive?
2008-08-31T21:07:00.000Z	unop	labanux	use something like rsync or tar to backup from the old harddrive to the new one
2008-08-31T21:08:00.000Z	labanux	unop	: but it didn't move the bootloader..
2008-08-31T21:08:00.000Z	labanux	unop	i've tried : cat /dev/sda2 > /dev/sdb1. But it has error message when booting
2008-08-31T21:08:00.000Z	unop	labanux	that's easily rectified by running reinstalling grub
2008-08-31T21:08:00.000Z	unop	labanux	cat is not suited for that purpose
2008-08-31T21:10:00.000Z	labanux	unop	: so how can i copy the whole system? using 'cp'?
2008-08-31T21:11:00.000Z	unop	labanux	how many partitions does your old setup have?  just one for / ?
2008-08-31T21:14:00.000Z	unop	labanux	mount both devices somewhere like /media/sda2 and /media/sdb2 .. then use something like this.  cd /media && sudo rsync -aAHXv sda2/ sdb2/
2008-08-31T21:14:00.000Z	labanux	unop	: two partition / and /media/data. But i only want to copy the system (/) to the new hdd (with different partition size)
2008-08-31T21:15:00.000Z	labanux	unop	then how about the bootloader?
2008-08-31T21:15:00.000Z	labanux	unop	how should I copy the bootloader from one hdd to the other?
2008-08-31T21:16:00.000Z	unop	labanux	once that command has finished running.  chroot to /media/sdb2 like this.  sudo chroot /media/sdb2 # and run this. sudo aptitude reinstall grub
2008-08-31T21:17:00.000Z	labanux	unop	: i've a problem with the rsync : "rsync: -aAHXv: unknown option"
2008-08-31T21:19:00.000Z	unop	labanux	hmm, how exactly are you using the rsync command?
2008-08-31T21:19:00.000Z	labanux	unop	sudo rsync -aAHXv / mnt/
2008-08-31T21:20:00.000Z	unop	labanux	try this.  sudo rsync -avHX / mnt/
2008-08-31T21:22:00.000Z	labanux	unop	: laban@labanux:/root$ sudo rsync -avHX / mnt/
2008-08-31T21:23:00.000Z	unop	labanux	 sudo rsync -av / mnt/
2008-08-31T21:25:00.000Z	labanux	unop	ok, work in progress..
2008-08-31T21:26:00.000Z	unop	labanux	just out of curiosity .. did you wipe the sdb2 partition clean ?
2008-08-31T21:27:00.000Z	unop	labanux	because if sdb2 is of a different size to sda2 .. then it's probably going to have the wrong filesystem size now - a result of your earlier cp command
