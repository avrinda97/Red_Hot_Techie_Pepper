2009-06-06T12:13:00.000Z	Gnea	rob235	try ushare
2009-06-06T12:13:00.000Z	rob235		i dont think ushare works with xbox360 yet
2009-06-06T12:13:00.000Z	Gnea		it worked with the 360 a few years ago, why not now?
2009-06-06T12:14:00.000Z	rob235	Gnea	i didnt know it did, i was just going by what i read
2009-06-06T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea	rob235	I've used it, I'm pretty sure it works, I wouldn't recommend it unless I knew for a fact that it does.  try it, see what happens.
2009-06-06T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea		*doesn't
2009-06-06T12:16:00.000Z	rob235		ushare doesnt have a gui does it?
2009-06-06T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea		nope, just a config file - make a dir, point it at it, startit up, and it should "just work", as long as the config is set correctly
2009-06-06T12:17:00.000Z	rob235		i mean i dont mind if it doesnt, just curious
2009-06-06T12:17:00.000Z	rob235		can you organize your folders with links/shortcuts?
2009-06-06T12:17:00.000Z	rob235		or just through the config file?
