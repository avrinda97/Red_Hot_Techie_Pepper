2010-04-14T21:35:00.000Z	strange		hey guys do you know how i can force gdm to use a resoultion for some reason nvidia tool doesnt recognize it but when i plug a simular screen in the same computer it works then i switch the screen that doesnt work and it shows fine in 1980x1200 as well
2010-04-14T21:36:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	I am not using gdm on this computer but, could you plug the smaller screen in and login
2010-04-14T21:37:00.000Z	strange	pyMitch	its not a smaller screen they are exactly the same heh
2010-04-14T21:37:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	oh..
2010-04-14T21:37:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	your best bet is in screen settings (I think thats what it is listed as)
2010-04-14T21:38:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	go to system>preferences>
2010-04-14T21:38:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	are you sure you have the right driver?
2010-04-14T21:39:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	are they different model screens?
2010-04-14T21:39:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	Oh.. could be a faulty screen?
2010-04-14T21:41:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	Could you say that again?
2010-04-14T21:41:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	Did you mean it does display on boot
2010-04-14T21:42:00.000Z	strange	pyMitch	it displays all the way just not at a decent resolution (640x480) max
2010-04-14T21:43:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	but the other screen the exact same works higher?
2010-04-14T21:43:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	that must be a faulty screen then!
2010-04-14T21:44:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	if the other exact same screen works
2010-04-14T21:44:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	it comes down to the hard ware
2010-04-14T21:44:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	:)
2010-04-14T21:45:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	send it back to the shop you got it from if it still has return time left
2010-04-14T21:46:00.000Z	strange	pyMitch	mmkay :)
2010-04-14T21:47:00.000Z	pyMitch	strange	Oh :/
