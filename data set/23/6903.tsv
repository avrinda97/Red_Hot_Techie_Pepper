2005-11-25T10:31:00.000Z	TenPlus1		Is it possible to share an internet connection through a wireless card to a WinXP laptop and share files/printer also using Ubuntu on main System ???
2005-11-25T10:32:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	I'm trying the same that you'd like to
2005-11-25T10:33:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	what chipset your wlan card has?
2005-11-25T10:34:00.000Z	TenPlus1	mdjake	Asus WL-138g... I have to use ndiswrapper, but it screws ubuntu up when I use card
2005-11-25T10:36:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	mine is MSI cb54g2 and MSI pc54g2
2005-11-25T10:36:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	both are rt2500 chipsetted
2005-11-25T10:37:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	but unfortunately rt2x00 doesn't support Access Point mode
2005-11-25T10:37:00.000Z	TenPlus1	mdjake	I'm trying to use ad-hoc only ???
2005-11-25T10:37:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	however I was said that connection sharing can be done (here on ubuntu irc)
2005-11-25T10:38:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	how do you use ad-hoc?
2005-11-25T10:38:00.000Z	TenPlus1	mdjake	on my WinXP system, both computers are setup as Ad-Hoc (pc to pc) only... the main computer is sharing the internet and files to the laptop...
2005-11-25T10:38:00.000Z	TenPlus1		I want to be able to use ubuntu to do the same...
2005-11-25T10:39:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	looks like your and my card will work only in ad-hoc for a while
2005-11-25T10:39:00.000Z	TenPlus1	mdjake	why does it only work fo a while ?
2005-11-25T10:39:00.000Z	mdjake		I'm here to ask about ad-hoc connecting too
2005-11-25T10:40:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	needs further kernel development of some IEEE stack as I understand
2005-11-25T10:40:00.000Z	TenPlus1		will this be on mandrake when it's released ?
2005-11-25T10:40:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	but ad-hoc work for some guys here
2005-11-25T10:40:00.000Z	mdjake		The guy callled P...something I don't remember
2005-11-25T10:41:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	he told me he shares his connection through wlan with Ubuntu
2005-11-25T10:41:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	unfortunatley he is not here now :(
2005-11-25T10:42:00.000Z	TenPlus1		mdjake; I will wait until drake is developed more and maybe use that... but I do like Ubuntu a lot
2005-11-25T10:43:00.000Z	mdjake	TenPlus1	problem is more general than distro specific - current Linux kernels doesn't give support for master mode - only Prism2/3 chipsetted cards can do that with an app called HostAP
