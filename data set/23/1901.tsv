2009-09-16T13:01:00.000Z	henry5		i facing firewall problem in UBUNNTU
2009-09-16T13:01:00.000Z	henry5		how can i check whether the ubuntu got any firewall or not?
2009-09-16T13:03:00.000Z	henry5		i follow the instruction in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo
2009-09-16T13:04:00.000Z	henry5		but it look not work
2009-09-16T13:04:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	are you sure it doesn't work?
2009-09-16T13:05:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	try:  iptables -nvL
2009-09-16T13:08:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	so what's the problem?
2009-09-16T13:09:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	again, what's the problem?
2009-09-16T13:10:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	probably incorrect password or the host isn't set right in mysql client
2009-09-16T13:10:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	it's not the firewall, your firewall is completely wide-open
2009-09-16T13:11:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	it is, however, catching the packets to mysql
2009-09-16T13:11:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	try telling it to connect via socket
2009-09-16T13:13:00.000Z	henry5	Gnea	any idea?
2009-09-16T13:13:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	you're either trying to connect to localhost or to the hostname with the GUI client
2009-09-16T13:13:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	they are trying to connect via lan?
2009-09-16T13:15:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	I did. yes, firewall is correct. problem is your mysql configuration. when you add a user to connect remotely, you need to add hostname of master-desktop, so they can connect to localhost or master-desktop
2009-09-16T13:19:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	well it's already wide-open, so it's not blocking anything, so stopping it wouldn't affect anything
2009-09-16T13:19:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	but:  sudo iptables -F
2009-09-16T13:21:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	yes, it turns the firewall off by removing the rules
2009-09-16T13:21:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	the firewall is not your problem.
2009-09-16T13:22:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	you'd have to save it first. see that URL.
2009-09-16T13:23:00.000Z	Gnea	henry5	good luck, I go to bed now
