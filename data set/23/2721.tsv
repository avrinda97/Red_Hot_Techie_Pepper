2008-12-16T10:16:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Hi. I'm experiencing a strange problem with my internet. Well, I can't access it. I can connect to my wi-fi network, but I can't access the internet. This is strange, because I can do so from a custom LiveCD I have, and my brother's computer is working just fine too. Does anyone know what might cause this?
2008-12-16T10:17:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	Type ifconfig and pastebin your wireless interface?
2008-12-16T10:18:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	That would be impossible. Sure, I can do it from the LiveCD. But the liveCD is working. The installed OS is not. It can't access the internet, so I can't pastebin it. :(
2008-12-16T10:19:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	Actually, what I can do... and it will probably take a while... is to reboot to the installed OS, ifconfig, output to a file, boot to the live CD, and then pastebin it.
2008-12-16T10:20:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	Okay...well in that case. You need to *boot* into Ubuntu and just check ifconfig to see whether your interface is getting an ip assigned.
2008-12-16T10:21:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	What if I already know that it is? This CD... or DVD, rather... takes a while to boot. I'd like to gather up a bunch of things to try, and do them all at once.
2008-12-16T10:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	No worries. && Could someone take a look here?
2008-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	You can go to your router page right?
2008-12-16T10:27:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	That could be. What would I do to fix those?
2008-12-16T10:30:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	There you go. Checklist. Pastebin ifconfig. Run netstat -rn. Pastebin that, too.
2008-12-16T10:31:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	Okay. I'll pastebin ifconfig and netstat -rn. Should I do it from here on the live CD too? To have something to compare to?
2008-12-16T10:32:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	Good idea.
2008-12-16T10:55:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	For netstat -rn, it's the same for the installed and the livedvd. Here's the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/f583783b1
2008-12-16T10:56:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	As for ifconfig, well, here is the installed's ifconfig: http://pastebin.com/f2fa9176e And here is the livedvd's ifconfig: http://pastebin.com/f23b01413
2008-12-16T10:56:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	That seems to be correct.
2008-12-16T10:58:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	Everything seems to be fine with your configuration.
2008-12-16T10:58:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	I noticed that the hwaddr's were different between the two. What is "hwaddr"?
2008-12-16T10:59:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	That's the MAC address of your card.
2008-12-16T11:00:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	That's the MAC address of your card.
2008-12-16T11:00:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	Unless your router has got MAC filtering enabled, I don't know what's wrong. :/
2008-12-16T11:01:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	Oh. Well what's an MAC address? :P
2008-12-16T11:01:00.000Z	tiyowan	[TiZ]	It's like an unique ID number for your wireless card. :-)
2008-12-16T11:01:00.000Z	[TiZ]	tiyowan	okay. Thanks for your help anyways.
