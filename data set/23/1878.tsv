2011-09-20T13:14:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	broken prerm-script. sudo killall nxserver     or however the process is called
2011-09-20T13:19:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	no process found . . .
2011-09-20T13:20:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	ps aux |grep -i nx
2011-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	ID 2088 ..when doing killall - no process found
2011-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	sudo killall 2088
2011-09-20T13:23:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	err: sudo kill 2088
2011-09-20T13:23:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	no process found .....I think is a ghost process or so ....
2011-09-20T13:23:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	kill: no such process
2011-09-20T13:25:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	pgrep nx
2011-09-20T13:25:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	I have a bigger problem I think I've installes nxserver and freeNX both together ...now the situation is messy :d
2011-09-20T13:28:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	http://pastebin.com/w2NDZZvw - could you please check this ?
2011-09-20T13:30:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	sry i don't use nx and cannot help you with that
2011-09-20T13:30:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	Ok but how should I uninstall that packages ??
2011-09-20T13:32:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	aptitude purge '~nfreenx' nx-common nxagent nxlibs
2011-09-20T13:34:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	it will work even if not installed through aptitude ???
2011-09-20T13:34:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	yes, aptitude is just another frontend to apt
2011-09-20T13:35:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	yes but if they were installed by dpkg ????
2011-09-20T13:35:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	shouldn't matter
2011-09-20T13:35:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	or by configuration scripts ???
2011-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	it seems to work ...no more server reporting to run .....
2012-02-13T13:54:00.000Z	llutz_	parapan	check routeing "route -n", your defalut-route should point to the vpn-servers IP
2012-02-13T13:56:00.000Z	parapan	llutz_	the command is giving me the external IP of the VPN server ...and also an internal IP address ...guess that's correct
