2007-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	nolt_	mage	look it its simple script but it wont work http://wklej.org/id/77b8266b74
2007-05-29T10:57:00.000Z	mage	nolt_	how come the variables aren't in quotes like if [ "$v1" -gt "$v2" ]  ; then ; whatever

2007-05-29T10:58:00.000Z	mage	nolt_	that script works for me, no changes
2007-05-29T10:59:00.000Z	nolt_	mage	u installed additional librares for scripting or somthing ?
2007-05-29T11:00:00.000Z	mage	nolt_	what are you feeding the script? you've wrote it to take numbers and tell you which is bigger
2007-05-29T11:01:00.000Z	nolt_	mage	that's right
2007-05-29T11:04:00.000Z	mage	nolt_	could be bad hardware or language problems :-/
2007-05-29T11:06:00.000Z	nolt_	mage	this hard or lang prob are fixable ?
2007-05-29T11:08:00.000Z	mage	nolt_	well uh I'm just guessing, its either something dumb resulting from you choosing not english installing ubuntu, or hardware, or you're humorously running like Etch+1 (whatever the unstable is)
