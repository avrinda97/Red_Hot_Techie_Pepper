2012-04-04T16:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	I'm not sure what you did to get into the terminal,  maybe did you <ctl><alt> f7
2012-04-05T18:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	I think it's a lisence isue,  they make it hard to install the needed firmware and stuf
2012-04-05T18:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	yes because it's one of the few that isn't plug and play
2012-04-05T18:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	sometimes newer isn't better, there have been times I have to go back to older code that still works until they fix the new code
2012-04-05T18:42:00.000Z	myhero	sacarlson	- how to msg to any specific user name....not pvt msg but to any specific user so it gets highlighted
2012-04-05T18:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	sudo ifconfig ;  will display each
2012-04-05T18:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	you want a solution?  you should provide the hardware data from sudo lshw; and also google it
2012-04-05T19:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	you might want to pastebinit the info to us for the details example pastebinit | sudo lshw ;  you will need to install pastebinit if not installed already apt-get install pastebinit
2012-06-05T05:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	oh you only lost 1 file?  I would think you could recover that
2012-06-13T18:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	if the old one works can't you just add it to the launcher?
2012-06-13T18:00:00.000Z	myhero	sacarlson	means
2012-06-13T18:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	maybe I don't understand what a launcher is?
2012-06-13T18:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	I thought you could add any application you wanted to the launcher to make it easy to start
2012-06-13T18:04:00.000Z	myhero	sacarlson	yeah i can add manually but previously when installed through software center it got added to launcher by itself and now doing manually it is not adding....i m running live 12.04 and whenever i boot i install it manually thatsy....
2012-06-13T18:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	I still run 10.04 i'm not an expert at 12.04 with unity,  it's just a few clicks away on 10.04 to add to apps to the pannel for quick start,  it keeps even after reboot.  another reason for me not to upgrade to 12.04 I guess
2012-06-13T18:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	maybe try the ppa for VLC, but I also tried that and it didn't work with the android remote control anymore,  so if that's not important to you then?
2012-06-13T18:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	your method of installing will not always bring in all the dependancies
2012-06-13T18:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	myhero	I've never done it so I'm no expert but you might try reading about it https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence
2012-06-13T18:33:00.000Z	myhero	sacarlson	ok...
