2007-06-18T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	he has it at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26163/ , doesn't make sense to me
2007-06-20T06:11:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	paste your config.log
2007-06-20T07:38:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	does ubuntu have tasksel?
2007-06-20T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	seems to
2007-06-20T07:39:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	but is ubuntu actually using it, in relationg to what Nutubuntu asks?
2007-06-20T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	no idea how well it works in ubuntu
2007-06-20T07:40:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	well he can use the minimal install to get a base system and proceed from there, that's another option
2007-06-24T06:27:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	see waht jrib said
2007-06-24T06:28:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	does universe get security patches?
2007-06-24T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	yes, though they aren't guaranteed I think
2007-06-24T06:28:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	if there is no guarantee it'S worthless as security update imho
2007-06-24T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	main has higher standards
2008-03-01T20:42:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	there's no need for name calling here
2008-03-01T20:42:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	you can ban me if you want I don't care
2008-03-01T20:42:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	I'm asking you not to name-call users if this channel, that is all
2008-06-23T18:01:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	he said VB, yes
2008-06-23T18:07:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	non-free versions. same developer yes
2008-08-30T20:50:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	didn't you read? there is NOTHING in tehre :P
2008-09-03T20:12:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	how does one change repos "the ubuntu wwy"? Homicide needs to upgrade from gutsy
2008-09-03T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	wols_	!upgrade  factoid should give the update-manager instructions.  Or are those not working?
2008-09-03T20:13:00.000Z	wols_	jrib	he says they are not. but I'M skeptical :)
