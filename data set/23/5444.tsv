2009-02-08T02:23:00.000Z	Frijolie		what file system should I partition an external HDD so both Windows and Linux can read/write to it?
2009-02-08T02:24:00.000Z	Frijolie		does NTFS work?
2009-02-08T02:24:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	NTFS works, but is proprietary
2009-02-08T02:24:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	you can use ext3, but then you have to download an extra tool for Windows (e.g. ext2fsd)
2009-02-08T02:26:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	I suggest you back up everything with Linux, even Windows data. Then you can use the best file system for large files and large contiguous reads and writes, which is currently XFS.
2009-02-08T02:38:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	Freecom FSG-3
2009-02-08T02:27:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	no
2009-02-08T02:28:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	I've never used XFS
2009-02-08T02:28:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	it's a matter of technical limitations. ext3 is okay under Windows with ext2fsd
2009-02-08T02:33:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	I would be the one performing all the backups from my Linux lappy. My wife is the one that uses Windows and has some photos that would need to be backed up mostly
2009-02-08T02:33:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	I guess I could just transfer the photos from her Windows lappy to my Linux comp and then backup/sync them from here
2009-02-08T02:34:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	so why not backup the Windows data while you're booted into Linux?
2009-02-08T02:34:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	oh, I see, you've got different machines
2009-02-08T02:34:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	you could of course partition the backup drive and have both NTFS and ext3 on it
2009-02-08T02:34:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	I'm trying to get her to convert over to the dark side...and replace XP with Intrepid
2009-02-08T02:35:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	she just uses proprietary apps which require Window$ for her work
2009-02-08T02:35:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	that's too much to have multiple partitions and filesystems
2009-02-08T02:36:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	I think I'm just going to go ext3 and use that driver for Windows
2009-02-08T02:36:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	have you considered a NAS box for backing up?
2009-02-08T02:36:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	yeah I was looking into that originally, but it was cost prohibitive
2009-02-08T02:36:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	I'm using an external USB 2.0 HDD for now
2009-02-08T02:36:00.000Z	soundray	Frijolie	I found the Freecom offer reasonable
2009-02-08T02:37:00.000Z	Frijolie	soundray	"Freecom"?
