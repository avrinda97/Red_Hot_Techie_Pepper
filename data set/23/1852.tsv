2012-03-11T02:36:00.000Z	Guinness2702		So, I moved my server to my new flat last weekend, all went well.  A couple of days later, my server just died - don't know why, but it did.  It will boot, as far as getting just a flashing cursor on a blank screen.  I can boot an ubuntu CD as far as the menu, but when I select either "run" or "install" it does the same thing with the cursor.  The drive is okay, I plugged it into another box and fsck'd it - all okay.  A
2012-03-11T02:36:00.000Z	Guinness2702		nybody have any idea what might be happening?
2012-03-11T02:37:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	try running memcheck86
2012-03-11T02:38:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	- oh yeah, forgot to say, I also was able to run memcheck off the disk, and let it do the first couple of passes with no trouble
2012-03-11T02:39:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	start removing hardware until it can boot a livecd/usb
2012-03-11T02:39:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	- the only thing removable is memory and cpu, unless you want me to dig out the soldering iron :\
2012-03-11T02:40:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	- it's a little mini-ITX system I use as a server - it's practially all in one
2012-03-11T02:40:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	can it boot another operating system?
2012-03-11T02:41:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	not got any to hand :\
2012-03-11T02:42:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	your problem is a tough one to solve, im out of ideas
2012-03-11T02:43:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	- yeah, me too :(  The only think I can think of is that it's a little warm in this new place, and it's a fanless system, but I don't get why it can run memtest or the ubuntu live cd menu, and then not boot :\
2012-03-11T02:43:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	- if it was fried, i wouldn't expect it to be so selective
2012-03-11T02:53:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	okay, I got a win95 install disk booting now, so my guess is h/ware is okay
2012-03-11T02:54:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	thats strange that it wouldnt atleast bott the ubuntu livecd then
2012-03-11T02:54:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	do you have a high end video card by chance?
2012-03-11T02:54:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	it will boot as far as the menu, but not the OS
2012-03-11T02:55:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	- quite the opposite, it's a low power mini-itx system - and anyway, it's been working for the last year - just suddenly died
2012-03-11T03:01:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	hold shift while booting, then press 'e' at the grub menu
2012-03-11T03:01:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	k, thx, I'll try it
2012-03-11T03:04:00.000Z	pfifo	Guinness2702	on the line starting with 'linux'
2012-03-11T03:04:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	k, that's where i went wrong :)
2012-03-11T03:06:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	okay, I also took out quiet - it got as far as "new low speed USB device using uhci_hcd"
2012-03-11T03:07:00.000Z	Guinness2702	pfifo	I'm thinking something to do with gfx mode though, as win95 install booted until it tried to start win (presumably GUI mode, previously was the text intro)
