2009-03-31T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	player1work	if you comment out those repositories in /etc/apt/sources.lst does it work ok?
2009-03-31T16:44:00.000Z	player1work	ActionParsnip1	how do i do that? i am a newbie
2009-03-31T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	player1work	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-03-31T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	player1work	and add a # character to the start of the lines defining the repos which are giving you issues
2009-03-31T16:48:00.000Z	player1work	ActionParsnip1	: none of these are listed in the sources.list file
2009-03-31T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	player1work	they must be, thts how apt knows where to look for packages
2009-03-31T16:52:00.000Z	player1work	ActionParsnip1	http://paste.ubuntu.com/141373/

2009-03-31T17:00:00.000Z	player1work	ActionParsnip1	ok...but i didnt add them :)
2009-03-31T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	player1work	comment them out one line at a time, then try to update, some or one is bad
2009-03-31T17:05:00.000Z	player1work	ActionParsnip1	:ok the errors are gone...but i still dont see the application in the menus
2009-03-31T17:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	player1work	what app?
2009-03-31T17:07:00.000Z	player1work	ActionParsnip1	 i was trying to install inkscape originally...maybe i misunderstood......the steps we just did fixed the add/remove problem or installed the app?
2009-03-31T17:08:00.000Z	player1work	ActionParsnip1	: its working now...thank you
2009-03-31T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	player1work	just need to clear those errors or no installs will take place
