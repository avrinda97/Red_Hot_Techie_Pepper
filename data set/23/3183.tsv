2008-07-13T05:07:00.000Z	eftex		okay thanks Seveas i knew its about grub but i was not sure if that is possible because i dont want to destroy the osx
2008-07-13T05:07:00.000Z	eftex		i want it to be seperated on each disk
2008-07-13T05:07:00.000Z	Derander	eftex	Oo, I'm running a hackintosh too.
2008-07-13T05:07:00.000Z	eftex		so there can be a mbr on the 2nd disk too or?
2008-07-13T05:07:00.000Z	eftex	Derander	 :)
2008-07-13T05:08:00.000Z	Derander	eftex	The way I have things set up it just boots off hd#1, GRUB there takes care of everything.  I don't know if you can put an MBR on disk #2 also
2008-07-13T05:08:00.000Z	Derander	eftex	Oh, read the question.  I'm not an expert - but if you install an MBR on the second one and then use your bios to read that first, you should be in business
2008-07-13T05:10:00.000Z	eftex	Derander	thats what i am now trying... but i want to "repair" my ubuntu its not a new install
2008-07-13T05:10:00.000Z	eftex		 (hd1,0) <-- thats the 2nd harddisk first partition right?
2008-07-13T05:10:00.000Z	Derander	eftex	yes
2008-07-13T05:10:00.000Z	eftex		k that should be fine since sdb is the harddisk on which linux runs and sda the one with osx
2008-07-13T05:11:00.000Z	Derander	eftex	I don't think you'll have to repair anything, grub is installed by default - just switch the boot order in BIOS
2008-07-13T05:11:00.000Z	eftex		grub> setup (hd1) leads to --> Error 12: Invalid device requested
2008-07-13T05:12:00.000Z	eftex	Derander	thats what i did... for osx i had to enable ahci in the sata controller i switched that back and chose the right harddisk via F8 (theres no biossetting needed with an asus mobo you can do that on the fly)
2008-07-13T05:12:00.000Z	eftex		but it shows just a black screen
2008-07-13T05:12:00.000Z	eftex		:/
2008-07-13T05:12:00.000Z	eftex		so i asume it cant find the boot-entry
2008-07-13T05:12:00.000Z	Derander	eftex	ah
2008-07-13T05:13:00.000Z	Derander		eftext: yeah, I have an asus mobo also.  this is getting in a bit over my head.  there are various grub utilities you can find
2008-07-13T05:14:00.000Z	Derander		Oh, question.  How does one know if they are running 64 bit?  This is a 64 bit intel processor
2008-07-13T05:14:00.000Z	Derander		64bit ubuntu*
2008-07-13T05:14:00.000Z	eftex	Derander	is there a way (without a hexeditor) to find out where grub is installed on the 2nd harddisk?
2008-07-13T05:15:00.000Z	Derander	eftex	I have no idea
