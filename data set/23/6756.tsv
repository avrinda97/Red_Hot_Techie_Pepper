2006-01-10T07:10:00.000Z	Steve|		http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/ubuntu/releases/5.10/ <--- from that
2006-01-10T07:11:00.000Z	Steve|		so whats the point of having 2 different types..?
2006-01-10T07:12:00.000Z	Steve|		nope
2006-01-10T07:12:00.000Z	Steve|		i'm new to the whole linux stuff
2006-01-10T07:12:00.000Z	Steve|		i just heard ubuntu is win
2006-01-10T07:13:00.000Z	Steve|		win as in good
2006-01-10T07:13:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	: the live cd allows you to try out ubuntu before you install it
2006-01-10T07:16:00.000Z	Steve|	lowman62	- how long did it take for you?
2006-01-10T07:16:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	: it took exactly 4 weeks
2006-01-10T07:22:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	: from a newbie point of view packages are additional software
2006-01-10T07:23:00.000Z	Steve|	lowman62	- so how do I run windows applications/games/etc on a linux based system?
2006-01-10T07:24:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	: I use a emulator called wine
2006-01-10T07:25:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	: it works for me
2006-01-10T07:25:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	I really don't see any real difference...I mean I use wine for a fixed number of applications that I must use and it works perfectly
2006-01-10T07:26:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	but I am not a gamer and there maybe something better for games
2006-01-10T07:27:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	in the linux world all those things you would normally have to install already come with ubuntu like office software
2006-01-10T07:28:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	: I have been running ubuntu now as a test for 68 days without a reboot and with very little problems...this is the most unbroken linux I have used thus so far
2006-01-10T07:28:00.000Z	Steve|	lowman62	- i see, sounds good.
2006-01-10T07:29:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	and yes..unlike windows that really will not make any use of the gig of ram you have...ubuntu uses it...my machine flies
2006-01-10T07:29:00.000Z	Steve|	lowman62	- haha, i only have 512mb :|
2006-01-10T07:30:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	believe it or not windows doesn't use all that ram...reports it does but does not in reality...ubuntu will
2006-01-10T08:25:00.000Z	lowman62	Steve|	: stick with ubuntu
