2005-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	somerville32		How do I make something mout everytime I boot?
2005-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	somerville32		No gui?
2005-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	why do you need it?
2005-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	just set the options to auto in /etc/fstab
2005-11-25T09:31:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	why is that? write a script to execute this, ifconfig eth0 up yourip netmask 255.255.255.0
2005-11-25T09:33:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	does it slow down at the dhcp part?
2005-11-25T09:33:00.000Z	somerville32	Eternalist	Yes
2005-11-25T09:33:00.000Z	somerville32	Eternalist	Nope, wired
2005-11-25T09:33:00.000Z	somerville32	Eternalist	I'm using XP's ICS
2005-11-25T09:34:00.000Z	somerville32	Eternalist	Correct
2005-11-25T09:34:00.000Z	somerville32	Eternalist	Well, why is it taking so long for the dhcp server to respond? Could it be my settings?
2005-11-25T09:34:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	if you have to connect thru a windows machine first, itll be slow no matter what you do on linux
2005-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	nothing to do with linux, its how fast windows xp can distrubute the ip to your computer
2005-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	check the ICS settings
2005-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	im not familiar with that aspect though so
2005-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	why does another xp computer go thru fine?
2005-11-25T09:36:00.000Z	somerville32	Eternalist	Sometimes it doesn't respond and the dhcp server goes to sleep
2005-11-25T09:36:00.000Z	somerville32	Eternalist	Sometimes it picks it up right away
2005-11-25T09:36:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	well then its best to just leave it
2005-11-25T09:37:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	id still recommend having all other pcs connect to the linux machine first
2005-11-25T10:01:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	linux is already more secure than windows
2005-11-25T10:01:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	only root can access ports 1024 and below
2005-11-25T10:01:00.000Z	Eternalist	somerville32	i dont run a firewall, i dont think a lot of peopele to, its fine how it is
