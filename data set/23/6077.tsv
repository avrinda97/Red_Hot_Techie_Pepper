2006-06-28T06:15:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Sivik...
2006-06-28T06:15:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Well.
2006-06-28T06:16:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		I just tried Lilo to see if it was my drive or if it was the install.
2006-06-28T06:16:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		I let the Ubuntu installer auto-partition it.
2006-06-28T06:16:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		And install it there.
2006-06-28T06:17:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Grub found my windows installl.
2006-06-28T06:17:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		All is a-okay until I boot.
2006-06-28T06:18:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		In my opinion.
2006-06-28T06:18:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		Yeah, this computer traditionally didn't boot Grub, but 5.06 booted Grub fine.
2006-06-28T06:19:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo		In any case, I had a windows partition, and let the Ubuntu installer auto-partition the remaining space.
2006-06-28T06:19:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	did you try just reinstalling grub by itself?
2006-06-28T06:19:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	sysdoc	What do you mean?
2006-06-28T06:20:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	you can boot to the CD and just reinstall grub
2006-06-28T06:20:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	sysdoc	Well I reinstalled the whole system multiple times.
2006-06-28T06:20:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	ok sorry to butt in then
2006-06-28T06:20:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	sysdoc	It's a-okay.
2006-06-28T06:21:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	ya know you can caue the boot loader from windows to boot Linux
2006-06-28T06:21:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	sysdoc	Really?!
2006-06-28T06:21:00.000Z	PseudoPlacebo	sysdoc	That would be best, imo.
2006-06-28T06:23:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	U may have to search around the wiki but google may be a faster search
2006-06-28T06:23:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	 there ya go
2006-06-28T06:30:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	I'm almost positive that I have read about it in either the wiki or the forum
2006-06-28T06:33:00.000Z	sysdoc	PseudoPlacebo	you there?
