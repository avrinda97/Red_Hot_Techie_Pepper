2007-02-16T13:08:00.000Z	atomiku		What can I do to force my game (Enemy territory) to use ALSA instead of OSS? I've tried aoss...
2007-02-16T13:09:00.000Z	atomiku		lol okay
2007-02-16T13:09:00.000Z	atomiku		thanks
2007-02-16T13:09:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	aoss for ET works fine for me
2007-03-27T10:41:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	you can add a incoming rule for everything and drop it
2007-03-27T10:41:00.000Z	atomiku	Slart	yeah thats what I wanna do
2007-03-27T10:41:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	hold on.. I'll check what my rules say
2007-03-27T10:43:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	DROP       0    --  anywhere             anywhere            state INVALID,NEW   that's my last rule in my incoming chain..
2007-03-27T10:43:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	I set my iptables rules using webmin so I can't give you a command line for it
2007-03-27T10:44:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	I kind of remember sometihng about a default policy too.. you could set it to drop and it would drop anything not specified anywhere else
2007-03-27T10:45:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	I'd say my firewall works nicely.. all NEW and INVALID connection attempts will get dropped.. anything connected to my outbound activities is allowed inside
2007-03-27T10:46:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	that way I can still use im, mail, ftp etc.. since iptables knows what ports to open up for answering connections, most of the time
2007-04-19T07:20:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	check /etc/fstab
2007-04-19T07:20:00.000Z	atomiku	Slart	yeah, I couldnt figure out what to add
2007-04-19T07:21:00.000Z	atomiku	Slart	any ideas?
2007-04-19T07:21:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	just add another line.. I don't know the syntax by heart.. you can always look at man fstab
2007-04-19T07:21:00.000Z	atomiku	Slart	Okay thanks :)
2007-04-19T07:21:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	you have some lines in there already, don't you? just copy paste one of them
2007-04-19T07:21:00.000Z	atomiku	Slart	hmm
2007-04-19T07:22:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	ok, I'm looking at my setup now.. the drive.. is it ext2? ext3? reiser?
2007-04-19T07:23:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	here is a line from my fstab                   /dev/sdb1    /media/sdb1     ext3 defaults  0 1
2007-04-19T07:24:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	first thing is the device name of the drive.. next is the mountpoint, next is filesystem.. then there are some options and the numbers are about file system checks and something else I forgot right now..you can probably use the values that are there
2007-04-19T10:55:00.000Z	Slart	atomiku	because the rest of the world is doing it... =)
