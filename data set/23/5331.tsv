2008-03-10T01:09:00.000Z	ut2004player	moreati	its says in the installation setup "guided - use entire disk or manual" which do i pick for dual boot? (windows is using 35 gb out of my total 40gb)
2008-03-10T01:10:00.000Z	ut2004player	moreati	no its just says use full disk.
2008-03-10T01:11:00.000Z	ut2004player		sry not full says "enitire disk"

2008-03-10T01:13:00.000Z	ut2004player	moreati	i dont have any storage to back up my data :( do i have to back up?
2008-03-10T01:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ut2004player	it'd be silly not to, proceed at your own risk w/o a backup
