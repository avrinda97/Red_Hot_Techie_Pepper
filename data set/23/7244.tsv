2005-09-22T05:22:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	come to think of it which video card have you got?
2005-09-22T05:22:00.000Z	dskloet	ompaul	asus riva tnt
2005-09-22T05:23:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	can you put the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list into http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-22T05:23:00.000Z	dskloet	ompaul	I don't understand. (but I think I forget to add multiverse indeed)
2005-09-22T05:24:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	a place where you can paste lots of data so others can view it
2005-09-22T05:26:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	tell you what dcc it to me
2005-09-22T05:27:00.000Z	dskloet	ompaul	dcc? You know, I'm going to add multiverse and then return here...
2005-09-22T05:27:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	and after that apt-get udpate
2005-09-22T05:27:00.000Z	dskloet	ompaul	of course ;)
2005-09-22T05:27:00.000Z	dskloet	ompaul	but thanks for reminding :)
2005-09-22T05:31:00.000Z	dskloet	ompaul	I did something wrong, adding multiverse is just copying the two lines and changing main to multiverse, right?
2005-09-22T05:32:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	I just add the word to the end of the line, but thats me :)

2005-09-22T05:33:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	both the same - I do it all on the one line
2005-09-22T05:34:00.000Z	ompaul	dskloet	I am going to get the bot to send you info

2005-09-22T05:36:00.000Z	dskloet	ompaul	I'd like to paste my source.list but I don't think I have a copy/paste buffer without X...
