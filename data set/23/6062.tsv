2009-11-30T02:25:00.000Z	Satan911		Hi. I need help with Ubuntu 9.10. I received the CD and I'm running Ubuntu from the CD (no installation on HD). It seems my WiFi device is recognized cause I can there are 4 networks available to connect. However on windows there are 6 networks including MY network which is not showing on Ubuntu. I tried connection "to hidden network" but with no success. I don't understand why some networks are showing but not mine. I also trie
2009-11-30T02:27:00.000Z	Satan911		I have a Linksys Cisco WiFi USB. It works great on Windows AND I can see some networks on Ubuntu (i see 4 on Ubuntu but 6 on Windows)
2009-11-30T02:27:00.000Z	Satan911		I also have a built-in card but it's broken and disabled.
2009-11-30T02:28:00.000Z	Satan911		I have a really powerful router that. The signal strengh is 100% on Windows
2009-11-30T02:29:00.000Z	Satan911		Anyone can tell me how to install this package: http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/net/ndisgtk  with the source. There's no configure / config or make file
2009-11-30T02:29:00.000Z	Satan911		Then why can I see my neighbor networks?
2009-11-30T02:30:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Are you unable to see your own ?
2009-11-30T02:30:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Does your wireless router broadcast it's essid?
2009-11-30T02:31:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Do you know the essid of your wireless router?
2009-11-30T02:31:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Then we can not help you.  Sorry.
2009-11-30T02:32:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Then you DO know the essid.  Right?
2009-11-30T02:33:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Does your router use encrypted authentication?
2009-11-30T02:33:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	What is your wireless card?
2009-11-30T02:34:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Tell us the make and model of  your wireless card.
2009-11-30T02:34:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	lspci |grep ireless
2009-11-30T02:35:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Bring up a terminal window and type:   lspci |grep ireless
2009-11-30T02:37:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	You can turn off security on your router and that might just enable you to connect.
2009-11-30T02:38:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Confuzius has the best solution, use a wired connection until  you get things figured out.
2009-11-30T02:38:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Turn off security on the router.
2009-11-30T02:39:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Turn of WPA
2009-11-30T02:41:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	You will need to install some kernel packages in order to compile from source.  And then you unpack the tarball and cd into it and do ./configure  make and make install   etc.
2009-11-30T02:42:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	But the package you downloaded more than likely is pre-compiled for Ubuntu and you can install it via the package manager, (once you get online).  I suggest you connec to wired network and get online, these things are easy once you are online.
2009-11-30T02:43:00.000Z	tgm	Satan911	Anytime.
