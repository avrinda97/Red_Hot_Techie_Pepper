2010-10-14T10:20:00.000Z	pankajm		my wireless is disable in network manager .. any resons?
2010-10-14T10:20:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	right click on network manager and click enable wireless
2010-10-14T10:21:00.000Z	pankajm		not possible , its greyed out
2010-10-14T10:22:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	i tried rfkill list all , it shows wlan0 -- soft block no , hard block yes
2010-10-14T10:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	is wireless enabled in bios? what about pressing the wifi button?
2010-10-14T10:23:00.000Z	pankajm		it works perfectly in windows xp in dual boot , btw i m only worried about mobile broadband , it was working once , now i cant see it in the applet's list
2010-10-14T10:24:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	but it is still inside the mobile-broadband tab..
2010-10-14T10:24:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	I'd check dmesg output, you might have installed a standard kernel
2010-10-14T10:24:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	err I meant non-standard kernel
2010-10-14T10:25:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	yeah , its the ubuntu 10.04 kernel
2010-10-14T10:25:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	i m on xp , which software can i use to read the ext4 files?
2010-10-14T10:25:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	recall what you did last to make it not work.. the wireless broadband afaik is usually handled by the driver known as option
2010-10-14T10:26:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	I don't think there are any.. had you been on ext3 you can get ext2ifs
2010-10-14T10:27:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	now it seems i cant detect my 3g usb modem as a modem , when i try to make a new connection , it doesn't detect it as it used to..
2010-10-14T10:27:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	was it detected as a flash drive? some wireless broadband modems allow you to also store or retrieve drivers from the stick itself, if so you need usb-modeswitch
2010-10-14T10:28:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	yeah it has storage which is detected
2010-10-14T10:28:00.000Z	pankajm		i have also got those packages
2010-10-14T10:29:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	i will try it and see , btw it worked without them...
2010-10-14T10:29:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	have you actually tried switching it back to modem mode?
2010-10-14T10:29:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	well it would be more ideal if you recalled what you did last to mess things up like that :) no wireless internet and no wireless broadband
2010-10-14T10:30:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	modem_ode?
2010-10-14T10:30:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	pankajm	yes modem mode, usb-modeswitch has that capability
2010-10-14T10:30:00.000Z	pankajm	hatake_kakashi	thanks for that info , i ll try that
