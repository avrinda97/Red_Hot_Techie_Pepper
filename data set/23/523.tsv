2011-10-31T04:24:00.000Z	gavin_		hello reisio
2011-10-31T04:25:00.000Z	gavin_		does anyone know how to update the linux ubuntu
2011-10-31T04:25:00.000Z	gavin_		?
2011-10-31T04:26:00.000Z	gavin_		just upgrade the whole ubuntu to 11.04
2011-10-31T04:26:00.000Z	gavin_		how do i find out the version for this ubuntu?
2011-10-31T04:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	"lsb_release -a"
2011-10-31T04:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	Stereocaulon's suggestion will NOT update to new release!
2011-10-31T04:34:00.000Z	gavin_	zykotick9	What type of command line will upgrade to the newer version?
2011-10-31T04:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	?
2011-10-31T04:35:00.000Z	gavin_	zykotick9	each time I try upgrading it, my whole system continuously  crashes
2011-10-31T04:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	i'm not surprised - i "personally" think upgrading Ubuntu to new releases is a terrible idea.  Good luck.
2011-10-31T04:35:00.000Z	gavin_	zykotick9	why is it a bad idea?
2011-10-31T04:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	too many problems
2011-10-31T04:36:00.000Z	gavin_	zykotick9	Why does the application continuously popping up asking me to upgrade to a newer version?
2011-10-31T04:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	do-release-upgrade - that's the command in cli to upgrade your system.  Thanks miceiken ;)
2011-10-31T04:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	oh you're suppose to upgrade!
2011-10-31T04:38:00.000Z	gavin_	zykotick9	I know I'm supposed to upgrade but each time I do, it crashes the system but I think I'm upgrading it now through command line
2011-10-31T04:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	hope it works out for ya :)
2011-10-31T04:38:00.000Z	gavin_	zykotick9	thanks and what if it doesn't work?
2011-10-31T04:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	what if... is impossible to answer
2011-10-31T04:39:00.000Z	gavin_	zykotick9	the system is trying to upgrade but nothing happening
2011-10-31T04:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	gavin_	don't direct your issues to me - as i said, i think it's a horrible idea...
