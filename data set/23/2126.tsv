2010-07-16T12:53:00.000Z	rapsli		I want do disable hpet in grub 2... all the instructions are for grub1 though
2010-07-16T12:54:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	hpet ?
2010-07-16T12:54:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	it has to do with the power management
2010-07-16T12:55:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	for example http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1269421
2010-07-16T12:55:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	you want to modify a kernel option then ?
2010-07-16T12:56:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	I guess? I'm not a linux guru, but I'm having this issue, and google tells me that disabling hpet would solve the issue
2010-07-16T12:57:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	grub 2 is really different,  try to modify /etc/default/grub (backup the old one!!) , then sudo update-grub,  apart from it , there single files for own menu-entries located elsewhere
2010-07-16T12:58:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	there are single*...
2010-07-16T13:00:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	int /etc/grub.d/ you find files, in their headers their purpose is explained, if /etc/default/grub won't do the job, think of visiting #grub, too
2010-07-16T13:01:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	yes, don't edit it, it's /etc/default/grub
2010-07-16T13:02:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	and MaRk-I ... which file should I edit now? grub or grub.conf?
2010-07-16T13:02:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	grub
2010-07-16T13:04:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	you did a backup, to grub_orig .. worst is you copy it back  :)
2010-07-16T13:04:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	but the system will still boot? ;)
2010-07-16T13:04:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	rapsli . file modified, saved ?
2010-07-16T13:05:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	should , or have onother entry , case mess up
2010-07-16T13:05:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	sudo update-grub
2010-07-16T13:05:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	... oky. let's try. ... be back in a minute
2010-07-16T13:10:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	... system is still running ;)
2010-07-16T13:10:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	and no errors ? well, modify on ..
2010-07-16T13:11:00.000Z	rapsli	DasEi	Nope. everything normal... I hope there are no more of those hpet errors. they usually come after some time
2010-07-16T13:12:00.000Z	DasEi	rapsli	fine then, I had my fun today with drdy errors on a crypted fake raid.. solved
