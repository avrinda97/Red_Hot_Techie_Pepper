2012-02-17T04:45:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	I don't fully get what you want to achieve. But maybe udisk (check man 7) helps you
2012-02-17T04:40:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	have you read man fstab?
2012-02-17T04:41:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	^ sorry
2012-02-17T04:42:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	so what do you want?
2012-02-17T04:42:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: So if I get some random usb key, it'll automount world read/write
2012-02-17T04:43:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	but that's what fstab does, no?
2012-02-17T04:43:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: My fstab does not contain entries for "Any Device" or any equivalent thereof that I can find
2012-02-17T04:44:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: Yet every device I plug in mounts, ergo something else is defaulting me to 700, for example.
2012-02-17T04:49:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: Looks promising, but I got to say that I am unimpressed w/ Ubuntu's documentation lately, esp. anything dealing w/ freedesktop.  Example, do you see anything about how udisks is configured?
2012-02-17T04:51:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: Nothing in gconf, nothing in /etc...  Argh.
2012-02-17T04:51:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	yes: "On Linux, udisks relies on recent versions of udev(7) and the kernel."
2012-02-17T04:51:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: Hmm, already checked out udev, didn't find anythign on default perms for usb block devices; will try again...
2012-02-17T04:53:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	so you want i.e. /dev/sdb carry, say, 0777 once you plug a pendrive in?
2012-02-17T04:54:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: Exactly
2012-02-17T04:54:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	well. that's crazy. But that's a udev thing
2012-02-17T04:54:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: No, it's completely logical given the scenario, but each to his own I suppose.
2012-02-17T04:58:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	simple: echo foo >/dev/sdb
2012-02-17T04:58:00.000Z	muelli	JessD	but udev does exactly what you want, i.e. just put MODE="0777" to your udev rule and off you go.
2012-02-17T04:59:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: How is mounting a drive with more perms equivalent to that?  I'd hate to do that, but that doesn't follow
2012-02-17T04:59:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: Or do you mean, any system user "could" do that..?
2012-02-17T05:00:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: If the latter, that's not a concern given the nature of the box.  It's purpose is to allow a group of trusted users to easily share files over samba
2012-02-17T05:00:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: If I were worried about malicious users, I a) wouldn't use samba and b) wouldn't be using this method for perms
2012-02-17T05:01:00.000Z	JessD	muelli	: alrighty then.
