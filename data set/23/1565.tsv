2010-02-02T06:50:00.000Z	phong_		why some website teach me to do  it  with  /  and then another partition with /home
2010-02-02T06:51:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	many people prefer to make /home on it's own partition so it doesn't fill up the hard drive and cause the system to slow down
2010-02-02T06:51:00.000Z	phong_	ezrafree	is that the advantage ?
2010-02-02T06:51:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	as far as i know that's why some folks recommend it, yes
2010-02-02T06:54:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	did you look in /home ?
2010-02-02T06:54:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	try browsing or cd'ing to the /home directory
2010-02-02T06:54:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	then it is in fact there
2010-02-02T06:54:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	partitions are mounted as folders
2010-02-02T07:44:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	there are many themes, which window manager are you running? gnome? compiz?
2010-02-02T07:45:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	then as mentioned the themes are gnome-look.org should work, as well as try installing Emerald
2010-02-02T07:51:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	do you have emerald installed?
2010-02-02T07:52:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	if it were me, i'd install emerald (a theme manager for compiz)
2010-02-02T07:52:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	installing software on ubuntu is done through "Ubuntu Software Center" located under the Applications menu
2010-02-02T07:55:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	yes never get help in PM with linux, someone could potentially make you do something bad and noone else will see it to warn you that it's a bad idea
2010-02-02T07:56:00.000Z	ezrafree	phong_	to download emerald, go to APPLICATIONS > UBUNTU SOFTWARE CENTER
