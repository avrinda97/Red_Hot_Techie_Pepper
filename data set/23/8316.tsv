2004-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	lobo_nz		Just installed mod_perl onto my ubuntu, had trouble with apache not finding libapreq.so (Apache::Request is installed) anyone know the correct way to tell apache where to find it
2004-10-25T15:33:00.000Z	lobo_nz		using dselect
2004-10-25T15:33:00.000Z	lobo_nz		1
2004-10-25T15:34:00.000Z	lobo_nz		I googled and found a solution but dont like it
2004-10-25T15:34:00.000Z	lobo_nz		no, I have a debian system aswell and diddn't have the problem
2004-10-25T15:35:00.000Z	lobo_nz		I will check there
2004-10-25T12:30:00.000Z	lobo_nz		I just updated ubuntu using dselect and now gnome dosn't seem to start and is stuck on the naked people loading screen - X is running and my mouse still works, where should I look to find out whats wrong?
2004-10-25T12:31:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	create a new user and see if they can log in. it could be gnome-session trouble or something. (just guessing)
2004-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	Made a new user and that got me further, I now have a GConf error about no databases to save my configuration - and another error about the gnome-panel attempting to change something that my system vendor does not allow
2004-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	hmm. when did you last update before this?
2004-10-25T12:44:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	first time it was an iso from a week or so ago
2004-10-25T12:45:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	i'm pretty sure it's gconf or gnome-session daemon
2004-10-25T12:46:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	I have a right click menu on the desktop but no menus, I'll try your suggestions or as I have not configured anything yet use the latest iso, thanks
2004-10-25T12:46:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	be warned that i don't know what i'm talking about
2004-10-25T13:27:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	I just re-installed ubuntu using the latest RC iso and still get the same problem as I did when updating from an old iso - Gnome sits on the naked people screen and does not load
2004-10-25T13:30:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	sorry, i honestly don't know what's wrong. you should file a bug. do you have some weird hardware in there?
2004-10-25T13:31:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	no pretty standard p4 with GeForce 4, the old ubuntu worked fine
2004-10-25T13:31:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	then it's surely a bug :(
2004-10-25T13:32:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	thanks for your interest, I will have a go at fixing it by removing and reinstalling stuff
2004-10-25T13:33:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	good luck! make sure the developers know about your problem
2004-10-25T13:34:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	I just did the add another user thing you suggested and have managed to log in sucessfully so all is not lost, if I get more errors I will file a bug if I can figure out whats wrong
2004-10-25T13:35:00.000Z	topyli	lobo_nz	great! now you can try and clean up your home dir of all gnome settings (make backups!) and see if you can log in as yourself then...
2004-10-25T13:36:00.000Z	lobo_nz	topyli	doing that now thanks
