2009-02-28T20:26:00.000Z	exodus_ms		gladideg, right-click on the workspace located on the panel, choose preferences and change the names from 'Desktop 1' Desktop 2' etc
2009-02-28T20:27:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	no such config option under preferences :/
2009-02-28T20:29:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	did you right-click on the box on the panel that is representing the workspaces you have open, you should be able to do that and get 'Workspace Switcher Preferences' Dialog box
2009-02-28T20:31:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	yes, I did get that, but there is no option to change the name.. do you think I need this>http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Environment/Tools/Workspace-Name-Applet-15863.shtml
2009-02-28T20:32:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	when you right click on the workspace box on the panel did you get a Workspace Switcher Preferences box? Inside tha box should be an area labled Workspace names:
2009-02-28T20:33:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	after you have made the name changes, check the box that says: Show workspace names in switcher
2009-02-28T20:37:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	don't know if you still need help but it should look something like this --> http://imagebin.ca/view/GHuLRphZ.html
2009-02-28T20:40:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	may I send you a screenshot.. I don't have the options you're talking about
2009-02-28T20:40:00.000Z	exodus_ms		gladideg, http://imagebin.ca/
2009-02-28T20:41:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	cool didn't know they had a pastebin for images ;)
2009-02-28T20:43:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	http://imagebin.ca/view/B2xnjlWh.html
2009-02-28T20:45:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	see what I mean
2009-02-28T20:46:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	ya
2009-02-28T20:46:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	what version of ubuntu you on?
2009-02-28T20:46:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	8.10
2009-02-28T20:47:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	same here.. how come I dont have those preferences?
2009-02-28T20:47:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	don't know, I'm reading something right now, might be what we are looking for
2009-02-28T20:48:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	thanks
2009-02-28T20:49:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	are you using visual effects?
2009-02-28T20:49:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	yes compiz fusion emerald
2009-02-28T20:50:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	ok, looks like a compiz problem. The workaround would be to turn off Compiz, change the workspace names and then turn Compiz on again (through System -> Preferences -> Appearance). The changes should "stick".
2009-02-28T20:52:00.000Z	gldtn	exodus_ms	doesn't stick :/
2009-02-28T20:53:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gldtn	so, got to system>preferences>appearance>none   then  right click on your workspace on the panel and choose preferences>change workspace names and check the box 'show workspace names in switcher. See if it works, if it does, then enable your visual effects by going to system>preferences>apearance
