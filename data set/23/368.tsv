2011-11-05T01:12:00.000Z	DavidCA		Is it possible to fix an Advanced Format Drive's misaligned sectors without losing all of my data?
2011-11-05T01:12:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	are you sure its misaligned ? do you have 4k sectors or 512byte ?
2011-11-05T01:13:00.000Z	DavidCA	failure	4k sectors. and yes, its misaligned because I used CloneZilla to to clone from a non-advanced format drive to an advanced format 4k sector drive
2011-11-05T01:13:00.000Z	DavidCA	failure	it even says so in the GUI Disk Manager or whatever its called
2011-11-05T01:14:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	yes, it dosnt take in mind that we can use 4k sectors :P so its prob. not misaligned
2011-11-05T01:14:00.000Z	DavidCA	failure	im pretty sure it is, i googled around and it said something about starting on sector 64, but mine starts on sector 63

2011-11-05T01:17:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	thats cylinders, not block you start at cylinder 1
2011-11-05T01:18:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	1C = 512B according yo your past bin
2011-11-05T01:19:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	google it up, and count on your own if its inlined or missaligned... it dont trust the "dist utility" anymore
2011-11-05T01:19:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	and what disks are you using ?
2011-11-05T01:20:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	ok some as me i guess, so we are at 4k blocks
2011-11-05T01:21:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	tell your fdisk to print blocks and not cylinders
2011-11-05T01:22:00.000Z	DavidCA	failure	how
2011-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	its true, start at 63 sector is missalined, you shall start at 64
2011-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	(64*512)/4096 = 8
2011-11-05T01:26:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	(63*512)/4096 = 7.8 in other words missalined
2011-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	if you dont have any data on it delete the partition and readd it and tell it to start at 64
2011-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	if you have data on it, do some reading before altering your partition table
2011-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	it is possible to remove the partition table with data on it and re add it, you will just loose the first sector eg 64
2011-11-05T01:31:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	if you can, backup your data and try to fix your partition
2011-11-05T01:32:00.000Z	failure	DavidCA	anyway om off, good luck with your alignment :)
2011-11-05T01:32:00.000Z	DavidCA	failure	thanks
