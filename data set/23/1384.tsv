2010-04-27T02:56:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	why DOS?
2010-04-27T02:57:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	because its a program that i have to use at my work.
2010-04-27T02:58:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	Type version at work and type version in Dosemu, maybe not compatible
2010-04-27T02:59:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	Or run XP/MS-DOS in VirtualBox and use you app there.
2010-04-27T03:01:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	i dont understand you. How could i note that? I mount c$ in /folder and then i try to assign /folder to f: but i get invalid argument in dosemu. If you can see this, http://pastebin.com/8bz5c3xZ its my config in dosemu, my trouble is in line 41
2010-04-27T03:02:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	can i run xp "mode" without xp from virtualbox? maybe i can try that :s
2010-04-27T03:05:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	Not sure what you mean by "mode"? You need a operating system in virtualbox, it's not a software emulator, but a hardware emulator.
2010-04-27T03:07:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	Not sure why your Dosemu config doesn't work, but if I was to run a windows/dos app, I would go for virtualbox with XP on it. OR create a secure remote desktop connection to your work place
2010-04-27T03:10:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	Also check http://www.dosemu.org/docs/HOWTO/
2010-04-27T03:12:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	i cant use virtualbox, i dont want to use windows. If i virtualize its the same that install in the hard drive so... I already read the howto thanks... but i cant figure out how to solve my problem.
2010-04-27T03:13:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	its seems to be that i cant assign a network drive to f: if i assign something local it work fine. :S
2010-04-27T03:14:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	What type of network sharing is on your netwok?
2010-04-27T03:15:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	i dont know if its the correct answer. I have a eth LAN. All pcs with xp. One is the "server" its share his C drive complete.
2010-04-27T03:16:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	now im traying to migrate to ubuntu, but only the clients for now. So im in a ubuntu 9.10
2010-04-27T03:17:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	Maybe Dosemu doesn't support SMB, if you are using gnome, see if Dosemu works with Gnome-VFS (virtual file system)
2010-04-27T03:19:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	how could i check that, where could i read about it?
2010-04-27T03:19:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	Even I have that problem sometimes loading things from sftp (Gnome-VFS)
2010-04-27T03:20:00.000Z	eoeas	deposito	1 sec ..
2010-04-27T03:20:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	yes no problem. ill google Dosemu works with Gnome-VFS (virtual file system)
2010-04-27T03:27:00.000Z	deposito	eoeas	i have to go now. ill read about it. If i couldnt fix it ill ask you again tomorrow. Thanks a lot.
