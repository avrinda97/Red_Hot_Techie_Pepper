2010-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	Saik		anyone got an idea why only one site's images aren't working for me? I checkedblacklists etc, and nothing
2010-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	Saik		checked blacklists*
2010-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	what blacklists? Some adblock?
2010-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	no, blacklists as in blocking things. there are none on this pc
2010-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	do you have any adblock installed then?
2010-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	nope
2010-10-16T08:11:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	are you behind a proxy?
2010-10-16T08:11:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	facebook's avatars aren't loading up, and this is recient. I asked friends theysay it's fine for them
2010-10-16T08:11:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	no, not at al, nothing's changed anyway over months
2010-10-16T08:11:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	Facebook was under maintenance about 30 minutes ago, maybe that could be related.
2010-10-16T08:12:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	I just had someone check, they see them, I don't
2010-10-16T08:12:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	have you tried with a different browser? (just to make sure the browser is not the problem)
2010-10-16T08:13:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	I don't have anotherone on this box, and it's never caused an issue till very eciently
2010-10-16T08:13:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	but something is causing the problem and you don't know what. It wouldn't be a good idea to try a different browser just in case.
2010-10-16T08:14:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	I'm using Firefox updated to latest
2010-10-16T08:27:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	VLC doesn't need codecs.
2010-10-16T08:27:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	I'e neded codecs on vlc
2010-10-16T08:30:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	I believe totem uses gstreamer. I could be wrong, though.
2010-10-16T08:30:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	no idea either way tbh
2010-10-16T08:37:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	I found GIMP MUCH more organised than photoshop lol
2010-10-16T08:37:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	I found it a mess at first. Now I love it (and I generally dislike GTK).
2010-10-16T09:03:00.000Z	leo_rockway	Saik	cache?
2010-10-16T09:03:00.000Z	Saik	leo_rockway	kz6090 aparenty, after I installed epiphay lol
