2009-06-06T12:43:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		ha, and I thought kde was bloated
2009-06-06T12:43:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		only 40 kB installed!
2009-06-06T12:44:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	that's just the meta-package
2009-06-06T12:44:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	sudo apt-get install kde  tells me: Need to get 187MB of archives.
2009-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	what gave you that idea? ;)
2009-06-07T12:19:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	hell hath no fury...
2009-08-21T07:03:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Gnea	you're too fast
2009-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	how so?
2009-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Gnea	i was about to answer "use tab completion" but you had already answered
2009-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	clearly this person doesn't fully understand the concept, yet
2009-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	in a channel with over 1000 people, it's not obvious?
2009-08-27T01:28:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	clearly, there's been precedents set that justify their existance.
2009-08-27T01:29:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	but basically, it helps keep the chatter and scrolling in the channel at a decent level so that it can function like it should and does
2009-08-27T01:30:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	it's usually not worth bothering to follow unless you're trying to get a problem solved or helping to solve a problem
2009-08-27T01:34:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	there's another reason why they're there ;)
2009-08-28T16:02:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	there's usually a good reason.
2009-09-13T12:19:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Gnea	well...microsoft does it
2009-09-13T12:19:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	lol
2009-09-18T06:03:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Gnea	well he has a 2ghz and 1 gig of ram, so ubuntu should run, albeit not incredibly fast and might have memory problems without a decent swap...
2009-10-03T08:00:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Gnea	office space fan?
2009-10-03T08:00:00.000Z	Gnea	DigitalKiwi	yes.
