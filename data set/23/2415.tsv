2011-03-07T23:45:00.000Z	antonius		sudo: /etc/sudoers is owned by uid 1001, should be 0
2011-03-07T23:45:00.000Z	antonius		sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting
2011-03-07T23:45:00.000Z	antonius		any ideas fols?
2011-03-07T23:45:00.000Z	antonius		\*folks
2011-03-07T23:46:00.000Z	antonius		and any "su" command doesn't seem to work
2011-03-07T23:47:00.000Z	terry	antonius	You can do sudo su -
2011-03-07T23:49:00.000Z	terry	antonius	Are you using the original user account? (The one that was established when the OS was originally installed?)
2011-03-07T23:49:00.000Z	antonius	terry	NO! this is the problem, i had to create a second account, because of (magical linux) vnc wouldn't work with that account..every other acccoiunt on this machine but that lol
2011-03-07T23:50:00.000Z	antonius	terry	 so now its asking for a uid that's been assigned to another user at this point
2011-03-07T23:50:00.000Z	terry	antonius	you might need to log into that original account to fix ti.
2011-03-07T23:50:00.000Z	antonius	terry	original account deleted :(
2011-03-07T23:51:00.000Z	terry	antonius	Why did you delete the original account?
2011-03-07T23:51:00.000Z	antonius	terry	well, figured i had no use for it..wanted to use the same username..didn't want to clutter gdm screen even more
2011-03-07T23:52:00.000Z	antonius		havent touched sudoers file
2011-03-07T23:53:00.000Z	terry	antonius	pastebinit /etc/goup
2011-03-07T23:54:00.000Z	antonius		http://pastebin.com/Dn0Gdqqd
2011-03-07T23:55:00.000Z	terry	antonius	pastebinit /etc/sudoers
2011-03-07T23:56:00.000Z	antonius	terry	don't have permissions for sudoers...they let me view /etc/group tho..?
2011-03-07T23:56:00.000Z	antonius		lol@ "they"
2011-03-07T23:58:00.000Z	terry	antonius	antonius Well, you have about 3 other accounts, right?  None of the other accounts will work?
2011-03-07T23:59:00.000Z	terry	antonius	Only thing I can figure is that you've edited the sudoers account and you're going to have to fix it some how.
2011-03-07T23:59:00.000Z	terry	antonius	Try another user account.
2011-03-08T00:02:00.000Z	terry	antonius	Or you could boot to a boot disk and choot over to the filesystem and run visudo and fix it that way.
