2008-04-27T04:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	lol, good luck w/ that.. boot a boot disk and run fixmbr and that should do it.
2008-04-28T01:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	is the device mounted?
2008-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	i don't know why you're calling me indyguyfreak, but ok
2008-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	Gerinych	IndyGunFreak	sorry, misspell
2008-04-28T01:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	right click the device.. choose properties, and on the volume tab, what does it say the mount point is?
2008-04-28T01:30:00.000Z	Gerinych	IndyGunFreak	/media/Sansa e260
2008-04-28T01:31:00.000Z	Gerinych	IndyGunFreak	i'll check that
2008-04-28T01:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	you need to chmod the device, to give your user permission to use it.
2008-04-28T01:32:00.000Z	Gerinych	IndyGunFreak	I can't, I tried doing that logged in as root, but the thing says that I have no permission to change the owner
2008-04-28T01:33:00.000Z	Gerinych	IndyGunFreak	somehow, this is not the case
2008-04-28T01:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	type this w/o quotes.. "/join #indygunfreak"
2009-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	why don't you just use a live cd to reinstlal grub?
2009-01-21T06:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	hang on.
2009-01-21T06:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	follow the "quick start" instructions..  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
2009-01-21T06:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	no, just follow the instructions
2009-01-21T06:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	what are the results?
2009-01-21T06:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	you have two hard drives, correct?
2009-01-21T06:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	which one is set to boot first?.. hd1 or 2?
2009-01-21T06:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	which obviously isn't right.. i'd try hd1
2009-01-21T06:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	you don't need the source, you need to follow the instructions on the link i gave you
2009-01-21T06:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	i really have no idea what you're talking about needign the source code for grub, i've used the live cd to reinstall grub many times w/ those instructions w/ no problem.. thats all i can tell you'
2009-01-21T06:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	if you're not gonna follow the instructions, then i can't help you
2009-01-21T06:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gerinych	and i told you, try hd1, and if that doesnt work, try the other one
