2012-06-20T10:27:00.000Z	mputtr		i see 4080 now
2012-06-20T10:27:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	got disc..
2012-06-20T10:27:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	cool..
2012-06-20T10:28:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	https://<ip>:4080 .. (u can tell the ip by doing-- ifconfig <enter> )
2012-06-20T10:28:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	and if you want a faster session with sound, download the binary nomachine "player" ..
2012-06-20T10:30:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	keep the v3 binary client.. because the current nmchine player shares the same settings as v3.. (eg, if you customize a session type to the same server with the v3 client, you'll have to undo changes from there, if you want a default session from the 'player'-- the player client doesnt currently let you do this)
2012-06-20T10:31:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	btw.. in the web https:// you go to the toppest-right pixel to activate the peel.. there'll be optional settings there..
2012-06-20T10:31:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	you'll notice it's only to get better with the final release when they have recording built into it..
2012-06-20T10:32:00.000Z	mputtr	jagginess_	yeah. im messing with the settings
2012-06-20T10:32:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	there's a way to scale it elegantly and resize it.. it'll take some fiddling..
2012-06-20T10:33:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	you use a dlink or linksys box?
2012-06-20T10:34:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	so ideally this is a little tricky.. reason is it's tricky to set a static-ip for ubuntu desktop.. (you have to setup networmanager.conf, etc etc)...
2012-06-20T10:35:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	if your dlink can do a port-forward against an address range it may be easier.. do you have the dlink model? i can look at online emu pages..
2012-06-20T10:37:00.000Z	jagginess_	mputtr	arp -a .. gimme the mac address for your gateway...
