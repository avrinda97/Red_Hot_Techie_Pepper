2012-06-14T09:33:00.000Z	savr		hi
2012-06-14T09:33:00.000Z	savr		there is something wrong with my wifi
2012-06-14T09:33:00.000Z	savr		I can not connect to secure networks in ubuntu. If I boot into windows I can
2012-06-14T09:33:00.000Z	savr		I can connect to the network via ethernet
2012-06-14T09:34:00.000Z	savr		WEP
2012-06-14T09:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	did you try wicd with wpa-supplicant?  that seems to work better for me with wifi
2012-06-14T09:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	in wicd you can try all or most posiblites of encryption drivers that are selectable in the gui
2012-06-14T09:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	if you fail to get an ip address from network-manager then your encryption isn't getting decoded
2012-06-14T09:37:00.000Z	savr	sacarlson	I do get an IP and it matches both on the router and ifconfig
2012-06-14T09:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	oh I could be wrong then I guess encryption is done after they give you an IP?
2012-06-15T13:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	my guess is you won't be able to use voip for fax but I could be wrong,  there are fax services on the net that can
2012-06-15T13:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	I guess I was wrong http://www.3cx.com/PBX/FOIP.html
2012-06-15T13:34:00.000Z	savr	sacarlson	yeah I need linux software not windows
2012-06-15T13:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	this free web service apears to be able to fax a pdf file direct tell me if it works http://faxzero.com/  limit is 5 free pages per day
2012-06-15T13:40:00.000Z	savr	sacarlson	it is to my credit card company so I don't want to use any free services like that
2012-06-15T13:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	good point
2012-06-15T13:52:00.000Z	savr	sacarlson	found hylafax-client
2012-06-15T13:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	I'm looking at CallWeaver
2012-06-15T13:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	but that apears to require going through a hylafax server so it's just as insecure as the website I originaly gave you
2012-06-15T13:57:00.000Z	savr	sacarlson	I can't load callwaver in china for some reason
2012-06-15T13:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	 I was having the same problem with there blog but this http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/CallWeaver#T38FaxoverIP
2012-06-15T14:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	savr	I see some packages that use skype to be the interface between the fax but not sure in linux, I wonder if this callweaver will work over skype?
2012-06-15T14:00:00.000Z	savr	sacarlson	will look into it thanks
