2011-07-30T05:24:00.000Z	yaaase		Hi #ubuntu, I have a question.  I currently have ubuntu installed in dual-boot with Windows 7.  I want to wipe my drives and install ubuntu only.  I am going to be doing this from a USB stick.  The documentation indicates that I need a "working internet connection" - my question is, can I use a wifi connection for this, or do I need an ethernet cable plugged into my pc?
2011-07-30T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yaaase	you don't strictly need a wifi connection
2011-07-30T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yaaase	but yes you can use wifi
2011-07-30T05:26:00.000Z	yaaase	ActionParsnip	I only have a wifi connection at the moment, so as long as I can use that and don't brick my laptop due to connection failure, I'm happy.
2011-07-30T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yaaase	if you use the alternate or desktop ISO you will be fine
2011-07-30T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yaaase	sure your system doesn't have ethernet. Very weird
