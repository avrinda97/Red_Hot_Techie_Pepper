2009-09-14T21:38:00.000Z	digilord	aaron11	Looks like you have a keyboard mapping that X doesn't recognize
2009-09-14T21:38:00.000Z	aaron11	digilord	i did nothing to my mapping
2009-09-14T21:44:00.000Z	digilord	aaron11	Have you made any changes recently that would mess up your X install?  Have you done an update recently?
2009-09-14T21:44:00.000Z	aaron11	digilord	yes just few mins ago
2009-09-14T21:45:00.000Z	digilord	aaron11	Were there a lot of items in the update list?
2009-09-14T21:45:00.000Z	aaron11	digilord	on my cousins account i disabled her 3d exaleration so i went to system--administrator--users and groups
2009-09-14T21:46:00.000Z	digilord	aaron11	3D accelleration is not a per account setting.  It's system wide as far as I remember.
2009-09-14T21:46:00.000Z	aaron11	digilord	i unlocked the admin account (mine) and went to her properties and checked 3d exaleration then ok
2009-09-14T21:47:00.000Z	aaron11	digilord	realy
2009-09-14T21:47:00.000Z	digilord	aaron11	Have you tried turning it back on and seeing if the problem goes away?
2009-09-14T21:48:00.000Z	digilord	aaron11	If I disable something and my desktop breaks I set it back and then do some research on that setting in Google.
2009-09-14T21:50:00.000Z	aaron11	digilord	i wanted to turn it on and tried it and i logged out of her account and logged back in then it showd an error gmd cannot write onto your home folder or somthing now each time i get on my account which is not logged out it shows up that same mesage manny times
