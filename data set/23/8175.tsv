2004-12-13T16:36:00.000Z	SimplyRob		Hello
2004-12-13T16:36:00.000Z	SimplyRob		What's the best dependency handler for ubuntu? synaptic? aptitude ?
2004-12-13T16:37:00.000Z	SimplyRob		I use aptitude for Kanotix, aptitude install or aptitude update, aptitude ugprade to handle dependency better than apt-get
2004-12-13T16:37:00.000Z	SimplyRob		With Ubuntu I can use what? gui and non-gui ?
2004-12-13T16:38:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	Synaptic
2004-12-13T16:38:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	aptitude is still installed though...
2004-12-13T16:39:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	that would work... sure... synaptic is prefered for Ubuntu though...
2004-12-13T16:39:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	apt-get owns aptitude
2004-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	blah, then why are you here?
2004-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	apt-get and apt-cache... better output.
2004-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	just use Ubuntu... its probably the best distro around right now.
2004-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	I am yet to here one thing bad about it...
2004-12-13T16:40:00.000Z	SimplyRob	|trey|	thats your opinion it runs too slow on mines
2004-12-13T16:41:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	I have seen Ubuntu on a P2 with no issues...
2004-12-13T16:41:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	if it uses the same repo, how does beatrix better enable the use of crap PC's?
2004-12-13T16:47:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	seems to me they are no different to Ubuntu... other then minimalizing the packages installed to 200mb's...
2004-12-13T16:47:00.000Z	SimplyRob	|trey|	told you
2004-12-13T16:48:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	Ubuntu runs fine on a 633 mhz 128mb RAM Celeron... although thats my server...
2004-12-13T16:48:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	it says it runs on such machines... but damn, Ubuntu runs on a fucking Apple Lisa ffs... thats old hardware!!
2004-12-13T16:48:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	its still using GNOME... so it will be the same...
2004-12-13T16:50:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	You'd learn more sticking to one... but ok...
2004-12-13T16:51:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	either way, if you're not using Ubuntu, this isn't the right channel for you.
2004-12-13T16:52:00.000Z	|trey|	SimplyRob	if Beatrix doesn't have a channel, go to #linux or #linux-help
