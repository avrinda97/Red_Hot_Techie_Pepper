2007-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	xhost		hello all
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	xhost		i was wondering wether i can make Fedora and Ubuntu coexist
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	xhost		hi bruenig
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	xhost		hi ubotu
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	xhost		yeah that all right but can one swap partition be used for both ubuntu and fedora
2007-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	variant	xhost	yes
2007-03-24T12:37:00.000Z	variant	xhost	use qemu?
2007-03-24T12:38:00.000Z	xhost	variant	and how do i install it.
2007-03-24T12:38:00.000Z	variant	xhost	apt-get install qemu
2007-03-24T12:39:00.000Z	variant	xhost	yw
2007-03-24T12:40:00.000Z	xhost	variant	one last thing is there any alternate free clone of cedega (the game env for windows based games)
2007-03-24T12:41:00.000Z	variant	xhost	cedega is free software (most of it)
2007-03-24T12:41:00.000Z	variant	xhost	you can get it from CVS, it is based on wine though
2007-03-24T12:41:00.000Z	xhost	variant	i agree but i think the site says one needs to pay
2007-03-24T12:42:00.000Z	variant	xhost	you can get the code from CVS and compile it your self although it probably leaves out directX parts
2007-03-24T12:43:00.000Z	variant	xhost	indeed, and wine has some support for that, cedega has improved support however
2007-03-24T12:44:00.000Z	variant	xhost	so, the moral of the story is to just try wine :) what games specifically?
2007-03-24T12:45:00.000Z	variant	xhost	http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=147
2007-03-24T12:45:00.000Z	variant	xhost	it seems to have some support, you may be able to optimise it
2007-03-24T12:46:00.000Z	variant	xhost	if you wish to address a comment to me, please use my full nick. you can type "va" press tab key and it will fill in the rest for you
2007-03-24T12:46:00.000Z	variant	xhost	otherwise i wont see it probably
2007-03-24T12:48:00.000Z	variant	xhost	seems to be reported working very well in fc6, it's worth your while compiling the very latest version of wine you can get as this will generaly have the best support
2007-03-24T12:48:00.000Z	variant	xhost	winehq.org
