2008-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis		you can boot a live cd, then chroot into the installed system, and use the passwd USERNAME command to set a new password. is one way. rescue mode may let you do it also
2008-04-20T13:31:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	the command please (I m a linux noob)
2008-04-20T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	it might be faster if you just reinstall and REMBER your password then.
2008-04-20T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 in short. boot to recovery/rescue mode to get to a shell.  mount the installed system, chroot /mountpoint, passwd username.   Of course all that is total magic to you. :) but i dont know the specifcs of your system.
2008-04-20T13:34:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	Thank you! I tried a lot of variations and got it now!
2009-02-25T14:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 not in the way you are talking about.. If you want to mount them someplace else.. you can manually mnount them whever you want.
2009-02-25T15:00:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	no I actually set the mount points by rightclicking and now I get an error "illegal characters in mount point"
2009-02-25T15:00:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	so none of my partitions mount
2009-02-25T15:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 ive never heard of anyone ever getting that right click stuff to 'work' :) those settings as far as i know are not in the fstab. they are a per user setting.. so are in your gnome settings somewhere.
2009-02-25T15:01:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	how do I find that out?
2009-02-25T15:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 most likely a space  in the mountpoint - from what i am imagining.
2009-02-25T15:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 make a new user - see if they mount for him. would be a good test.
2009-02-25T15:01:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	the character it said was GD_DIR_SEPARATOR
2009-02-25T15:02:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	but anyway where can I reset those settings?
2009-02-25T15:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 hard core way would be to reset all the gnome settings by removing the .gnome* and .gconf* directories.. which is why i said to test with a new user first.. befor going that hardcore
2009-02-25T15:04:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	oh ok
2009-02-25T15:07:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	nope doesnt work
2009-02-25T15:07:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	so is it dangerous to reset my gnome settings?
2009-02-25T15:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 you wuill lose all yoru settings.. but if it dosent work for your other new user.. it may not be a gnome setting issue
2009-02-25T15:19:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	it seems to be a HAL setting issue in gnome. as per the error msg
2009-02-25T15:19:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	googled :)
2009-02-25T15:19:00.000Z	SingAlong	Dr_willis	but no solution
2009-02-25T15:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SingAlong	 this is linux.. thers always a solution.. You could just mount the things manually.
