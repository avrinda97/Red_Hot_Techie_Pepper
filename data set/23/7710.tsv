2005-05-19T07:41:00.000Z	mebaran151		and bam you have 15 thou of apps
2005-05-19T07:41:00.000Z	mebaran151		the kernel is a bit fix
2005-05-19T07:41:00.000Z	mebaran151		yeah you can

2005-05-19T07:41:00.000Z	mebaran151		it is a little harder than you think it will be
2005-05-19T07:42:00.000Z	mebaran151		you have to apply a couple kernel patches
2005-05-19T07:42:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	don't worry i know - i've been battlign for days
2005-05-19T07:57:00.000Z	mebaran151	Xanadu	the Zen Linux project might be good for you
2005-05-19T08:00:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	so basically i'm pretty screwed?
2005-05-19T08:02:00.000Z	mebaran151	Xanadu	Debian patches are not Ubuntu patches
2005-05-19T08:03:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	where can i get clean ubuntu patches?
2005-05-19T08:09:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	two problems with that: 1) it's not ubuntu, and 2) i want to learn to do it myself
2005-05-19T08:10:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	been through the XFree guide but i inevitably get to the "patch your kernel" part
2005-05-19T08:10:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	oi vey
2005-05-19T08:11:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	backstreet ruby is a patch too
2005-05-19T08:14:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	i'm 99% of the way there so there is some stuff in xorg for multiusers - i've got two completely seperate sessions running with seperate screens and mice
2005-05-19T08:23:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	i've downloaded kernel-image-2.6.0-ruby-athlon_10.00.Custom_i386.deb
2005-05-19T08:29:00.000Z	mebaran151	Xanadu	the problem I think is that keybd code
2005-05-19T08:39:00.000Z	Xanadu	mebaran151	whats wrong with them?
