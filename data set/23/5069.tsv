2007-04-28T16:47:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		i need help Azureus is quitting itself as soon as I launch it, and I tried reinstalling it through automatix but Automatix won't launch either because it says Apt-get is running and I don't know how to stop it from running...
2007-04-28T16:49:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	have you tried deluge instead of azureus?
2007-04-28T16:49:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	i want to use azureus it used to work i dont see why it wouldn't work anymore
2007-04-28T16:50:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	that's probably why it's broken (automatix)
2007-04-28T16:50:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	how do i close apt-get
2007-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	uh, don't run it?
2007-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	i dont even know why it's still running im not checking for updates
2007-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	synaptic is closed too?
2007-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	i dont have the update icon and im not updating i have no idea why it's supposedly running
2007-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	yes synaptic is closed everything is closed but XIRC
2007-04-28T16:53:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	how do i make sure apt-get is closed
2007-04-28T16:53:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	it doesn't stay open, you can reboot, then once you've rebooted, you can delete the lock file
2007-04-28T16:54:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	any way I could kill it without rebooting
2007-04-28T16:54:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	it's probably not running, but you can't delete the lock file without rebooting to be sure
2007-04-28T05:00:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	thank you it worked
2007-04-28T05:01:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	however Azureus tries to update and it fails because it doesn't have write permission, do you know how I could fix?
2007-04-28T05:01:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	that's normal I would think
2007-04-28T05:01:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	don't worry about it
2007-04-28T05:02:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	it prompts me to update everytime i launch it, it bugs me lol
2007-04-28T05:02:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	can't turn it off?
2007-04-28T05:02:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	i do not know how
2007-04-28T05:02:00.000Z	efrancolaporte	crdlb	id like to update if possible
2007-04-28T05:03:00.000Z	crdlb	efrancolaporte	you shouldn't install software outside of APT
