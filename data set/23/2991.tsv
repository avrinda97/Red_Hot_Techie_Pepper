2009-02-05T04:53:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	Thanks
2009-02-05T04:54:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	just write "cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log" and you'll get the whole thing
2009-02-05T04:54:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	the log file is from X starting up.. lines that contain an error starts with EE.. it's a good way to see why you don't have acceleration or other problems
2009-02-05T04:56:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	some stuff ends up in dmesg, but not the very first text..
2009-04-04T23:54:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	nevermind that.. it's just a command to show what you've said so far in the channel.. did you have a "real" question about multi-os machines?
2009-04-04T23:56:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	Yeah, I've been running Ubuntu 8.10 and my wife needed to use a new printer she got but it doesn't work.  I partitioned 15GB for an XP install.  I installed it and it turns out I have to unload some drivers to it to get the internet and all of that to work.  I went to restart to boot into Ubuntu so I could D/L them to a thumbdrive but it doesn't give me the option to choose.  It just...
2009-04-04T23:57:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	installing windows probably wiped grub.. windows does that (no respect for other software=).. type !grub here in the channel to get some links with howtos.. it's a pretty common problem
2009-04-04T23:58:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	Thanks.
2009-04-05T00:28:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	Heya man, I looked at that grub howto and got grub back on my master boot record so now I can boot Ubuntu.  However, it doesn't give me the option to boot to the windows partition now and I'm not sure which option would work for me after that...
2009-04-05T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	you have to add a couple of lines to the grub configuration file for that
2009-04-05T00:31:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	try running this in a terminal "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst" you should get an editor window with the grub configuration file
2009-04-05T00:32:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	 Oh alright, what lines do I add?
2009-04-05T00:32:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	browse through that file.. I Think there is an example for booting a windows partition
2009-04-05T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	did you find anything?
2009-04-05T00:36:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	I saw one example, but I'm not sure about it yet, going to look at some google results.
2009-04-05T00:36:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	ok, let us know if you need any help
2009-04-05T00:42:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	Okay, one quick question...  How do I tell which drive/partition my Windows install is on?  I've only got one HD (laptop) and I've got two partitions.  sda1 is linux and sda2 is windows, but how do i translate that into (hd#,#)?
2009-04-05T00:42:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	grub starts counting at zero.. first drive, first partition is hd0,0  the first number is driver number, second is partition
2009-04-05T00:43:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	so sda2 would be hd0,1
2009-04-05T00:43:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	Thanks, I'll give this one a go and I'll be back soon hopefully!
2009-04-05T00:43:00.000Z	Slart	nkei0	good luck =)
2009-04-05T01:05:00.000Z	nkei0	Slart	Thanks man, everything is working now.
