2008-11-29T03:04:00.000Z	zicho		im having som difficulties with dbus. when i run e"nv | grep dbus" i get no output, but when i run "sudo /etc/init.d/dbus start" it says that dbus is already running, how can i fix it?
2008-11-29T03:06:00.000Z	rww	zicho	was `` e"nv `` a typo? I'm not familiar with that command...
2008-11-29T03:07:00.000Z	rww	zicho	if you meant "env", that isn't supposed to have any dbus lines in it, I think (my dbus works fine and env has nothing about dbus in it, anyway)
2008-11-29T03:07:00.000Z	zicho	rww	it should be "env"
2008-11-29T03:07:00.000Z	rww	zicho	try ps -AH | grep dbus
2008-11-29T03:08:00.000Z	zicho	rww	i have both launch and daemon there
2008-11-29T03:08:00.000Z	rww	zicho	iono, are you having dbus problems? if so, what errors are you getting?
2008-11-29T03:08:00.000Z	zicho	rww	"Unhandled Exception: System.Exception: Unable to open the session message bus."
2008-11-29T03:10:00.000Z	rww	zicho	open a terminal and try dbus-launch banshee
2008-11-29T03:11:00.000Z	zicho	rww	i have banshee already running using that command, but the problem is that i cant control it remotely with example "banshee --pause"
2008-11-29T03:12:00.000Z	zicho	rww	my "echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" gives me nothing though
2008-11-29T03:13:00.000Z	rww	zicho	does it persist after a restart? there's a launchpad bug that looks similar that got cleared up after a restart
2008-11-29T03:13:00.000Z	rww	zicho	you could also try "sudo /etc/init.d/dbus restart" i guess
2008-11-29T03:13:00.000Z	zicho	rww	i rebooted earlier, still the same error
2008-11-29T03:14:00.000Z	rww	zicho	hmm
2008-11-29T03:16:00.000Z	rww	zicho	i have no idea, then. Try asking in #dbus maybe?
2008-11-29T03:17:00.000Z	zicho	rww	i think i have it figured out. I run fluxbox, and there in lies the matter. it doesnt connect to dbus automaticcaly
2008-11-29T03:28:00.000Z	zicho	rww	 if i close fluxbox, and start it up again via "dbus-launch" banshee works just like it should. Is there anyway to edit the script that runs when logging in?
2008-11-29T03:29:00.000Z	rww	zicho	If this were the Arch Linux IRC channel, I'd say to modify .xinitrc and put that command in there, but I don't know whether that's the Ubuntu Way of doing things.
2008-11-29T03:30:00.000Z	zicho	rww	what about .xsession?
2008-11-29T03:36:00.000Z	rww	zicho	which file did you put that in? so I know for future reference?
2008-11-29T03:37:00.000Z	zicho	rww	~/.fluxbox/startuo
2008-11-29T03:37:00.000Z	zicho	rww	thanks for your support too
