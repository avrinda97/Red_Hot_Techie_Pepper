2006-12-20T07:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	Why do you need to run alsamixer with sudo?
2006-12-20T07:58:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	you don't need to but I was gonna say then store the settings
2006-12-28T09:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	IIANM the default prefix is already /usr/local
2006-12-28T09:48:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	umm not on a lot of programs most are just set to /usr
2006-12-28T09:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	When you run ./configure, it sets up the default prefix for /usr/local, I'm quite sure. The debian packages are made for /usr, yes.
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	They are one in the same, I'm pretty sure. Intel released GPL drivers which the Linux developers integrated into their trees.
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	maybe but the xorg driver isn't the intel driver since xorg 7.1 was out before Intel released the drivers
2007-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	mine did that also but after a few reboots it worked normally for some reason
2007-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	...o__O
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	with just booting to shell first but then after about 3 or so boots it started gdm on boot
2007-01-02T07:17:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	probably cat file >> otherfile
2007-01-02T07:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	I only want the first 500kb
2007-01-02T07:18:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	hmm then not sure
2007-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	fuse can do sshfs and other filesystems
2007-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	In the context of !ntfs recommending !fuse versus !ntfs-3g. Why?
2007-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	from what I been reading ntfs-3g will be int he linux kernel sometime soon
2007-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	Then shouldn't it be recommended, rather than fuse?
2007-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	I would recommand ntfs-3g since I onyl use fuse for sshfs
2007-01-03T06:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	So what reason is there that !ntfs recommends !fuse? Should I suggest changing it in the -ops channel? Are there good reasons for it, or is it an oversight?
2007-01-03T06:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	Whoa, it just got changed. xD Nevermind.
2007-01-03T06:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	The wise ones are listening >__>
2007-01-03T06:50:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	BULLE: I wish Sun Java will be open source Java and not just the implmentation
2007-01-20T09:21:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	thought it's 0 instead of disable?
