2007-01-08T13:47:00.000Z	Sergemine		windows. but that's a different PC , StraightShootinC
2007-01-08T13:49:00.000Z	Sergemine		i installed an EXT3 filesystem driver under windows and mabaged to delete all Ubuntu files somehow
2007-01-08T13:50:00.000Z	Sergemine		the partition is deleted
2007-01-08T13:50:00.000Z	Sergemine		:(
2007-01-08T13:50:00.000Z	Sergemine		can GRUB read from FAT drive?
2007-01-08T13:50:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	the ext3 ifs driver destroyed your partition? or did you delete anything yourself?
2007-01-08T13:52:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	you should be able to use any livecd with grub to install grub
2007-01-08T13:54:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	the debian business card iso should be really really small
2007-01-08T13:54:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	although i cant guarantee that theres grub on it... but it should be
2007-01-08T13:56:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	i you can boot, and then get a shell, you should be able to reinstall grub
2007-01-08T13:57:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	just start grub, then do the root (hd0,0) or whatever thing, then setup (hd0) (make sure hd0 is the actual harddisk where the grub files are)
2007-01-08T14:02:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	hd0 stands for the whole disk hd0,0 would be the first partition on the first harddisk
2007-01-08T14:02:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	root (hd0,0) tells grub where to look for the grub/ dir
2007-01-08T14:03:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	setup hd0 will install grub in the MBR of the disk hd0
2007-01-08T14:03:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	you can use tab-completion while in the grub shell to examine things
2007-01-08T14:04:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	and grub will tell the fs if you execute the root command, so from that you should be able to tell if you are using the right partition
2007-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	mmh, if hd0,3 is your /boot partition, with the grub/ dir that contains all the necessary files, and if grub can read fat32 (which i think it should) then you should be able to do setup (hd0) afterwards
2007-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	then grub should tell you that it found all files and installed itself, but you can't remove hd0,3 afterwards or things will break
2007-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	the grub/ dir+files will have to stay there
2007-01-08T14:09:00.000Z	Sergemine	laz0r	yeh! that's what I need
2007-01-08T14:09:00.000Z	Sergemine	laz0r	thank you so much!
2007-01-08T14:10:00.000Z	Sergemine	laz0r	thank you so much!
2007-01-08T14:10:00.000Z	laz0r	Sergemine	np
