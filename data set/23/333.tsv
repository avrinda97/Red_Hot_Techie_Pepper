2011-12-09T10:28:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	I think i'll use google code, since I like it better
2011-12-09T10:08:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	go on
2011-12-09T10:08:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	in one line
2011-12-09T10:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	in short how would this help?
2011-12-09T10:10:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	shockwave is not available for linux
2011-12-09T10:11:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	and many linux users want to be able to play shockwave games (a lot of 3d online games are shockwave)
2011-12-09T10:12:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	but really how about this adobe shockwave only developers just drop it, google already kinda does this - they are pushing for native code(in a conainer) for chrome
2011-12-09T10:13:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	if you look at miniclip.com (a gaming site I use a lot), there's a lot of shockwave games on there
2011-12-09T10:13:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	i don't see shockwave games as a turning point for OS switches
2011-12-09T10:13:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	I hate booting into windows to play shockwave games, and wine can't install the latest version
2011-12-09T10:13:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	even then, people won't open a windows browser just to play a shockwave game.
2011-12-09T10:14:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	dude what could they not do with html5/javascript and flash that they can with shockwave?
2011-12-09T10:14:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	hardware accellerated 3d graphics
2011-12-09T10:16:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	heh, a small niche but if you've got time go ahead; but i expect eventually this will be much more than a one man project - as soon as adobe changes you have to react
2011-12-09T10:17:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	that's the whole point of open source. the whole community can help :)
2011-12-09T10:18:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	this is big though, the opensource flash version doesn't seem to be doing well, i'm not even sure gnash is around anymore
2011-12-09T10:20:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	I think they abandoned it cuz flash is available for linux from adobe
2011-12-09T10:25:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	heh this'll be difficult with you not being able to review minute by minute changes; how close is this to being functional?
2011-12-09T10:25:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	I'm starting to code. It will be ready soon, but i can't give you any ETA's though
2011-12-09T10:26:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	It will depend on how many people join in, and how much people contribute.
2011-12-09T10:27:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	start a git or svn
2011-12-09T10:27:00.000Z	coolstar	aeon-ltd	which do you think is better?
2011-12-09T10:28:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	coolstar	i've never personally used them, i would say use whatever is the easiest to set up to save time
