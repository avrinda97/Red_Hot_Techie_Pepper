2007-03-28T06:01:00.000Z	MrXclusiv		fglrxinfo lists my chip as Mesa DRI Radeon 20060327 AGP 1x NO-TCL
2007-03-28T06:02:00.000Z	Pici	MrXclusiv	What does the Driver section under "Device" in xorg.conf say?
2007-03-28T06:04:00.000Z	MrXclusiv	Pici	: driver is "ati"
2007-03-28T06:05:00.000Z	Pici	MrXclusiv	If you installed the fglrx driver you'll need to change it to "fglrx".
2007-03-28T06:05:00.000Z	MrXclusiv	Pici	: i have done that several times, but when i do it busts my gui
2007-03-28T06:10:00.000Z	Pici	MrXclusiv	Did you follow the instructions on the BinaryDriverHowTo page regarding fixing the Mesa issue?
2007-03-28T06:10:00.000Z	MrXclusiv	Pici	:yes i have not all of them tho as some i dont know how to do
2007-03-28T06:10:00.000Z	Pici	MrXclusiv	Which steps are you having difficulty with?
2007-03-28T06:13:00.000Z	MrXclusiv	Pici	: the step "make sure that the restricted-modules package installed correspond to the kernel you are running and that you can load the fglrx driver.... etc.....
2007-03-28T06:14:00.000Z	MrXclusiv		pici : i cant load the fglrx driver, nor can i unload the radeon and dri modules
2007-03-28T06:14:00.000Z	MrXclusiv		it says they in use
2007-03-28T06:15:00.000Z	Pici	MrXclusiv	Basically, you just need to make sure that you have the linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` installed.
2007-03-28T06:16:00.000Z	Pici		!flash64 > wdwhitney (see the private message from ubotu)
2007-03-28T06:16:00.000Z	MrXclusiv	Pici	: that makes little sense to me
2007-03-28T06:17:00.000Z	MrXclusiv	Pici	: could you please /j #ubuntu-mesaprob
2007-03-28T06:17:00.000Z	MrXclusiv		to avoid all the chatter
2007-03-28T06:17:00.000Z	Pici	MrXclusiv	Sorry.  You need the linux-restricted-modules-yourkernelversion installed. i.e. do 'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`'
