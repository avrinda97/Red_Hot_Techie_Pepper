2005-10-23T16:42:00.000Z	mustard5		ask you question Dynamite, go ahead
2005-10-23T16:43:00.000Z	Dynamite	mustard5	After trying to install ubuntu (it failed) my computer doesn't boot from the harddrive anymore
2005-10-23T16:43:00.000Z	mustard5	Dynamite	heh...thats a pretty unusual problem :D
2005-10-23T16:43:00.000Z	mustard5		you got me :D
2005-10-23T16:44:00.000Z	mustard5		I'm lost for that one
2005-10-23T16:44:00.000Z	Dynamite	mustard5	It says "Restart and choose proper boot device or insert a boot device then press any key"
2005-10-23T16:44:00.000Z	mustard5		time to change password, hey Java_the_Hutt :)
2005-10-23T16:44:00.000Z	mustard5	Dynamite	I would guess that you need to check your bios settings to see the order of boot devices
2005-10-23T16:45:00.000Z	Dynamite	mustard5	If faileds while installing the base system, My bios is configured correctly
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	mustard5	Dynamite	you running XP?
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	Dynamite		Yeah
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	mustard5		ah ok
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	mustard5		you might have trashed your MBR
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	mustard5		maybe
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	mustard5		let me check for some help
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	Dynamite		I tried to fix it
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	Dynamite		I got to the recovery console and typed: Fixboot c:
2005-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	Dynamite		and fixmbr
2005-10-23T16:47:00.000Z	Dynamite		yeah
2005-10-23T16:47:00.000Z	mustard5	Dynamite	I don't use XP, so I am not familiar with the technique to recover, but it does exist
2005-10-23T16:47:00.000Z	Dynamite		I guess the C: Partion which has windows isn't considered primary boot drive
2005-10-23T16:47:00.000Z	Dynamite		How could I know?
2005-10-23T16:48:00.000Z	mustard5	Dynamite	my advice would be to run a search on the ubuntu forums for a post of a similar problem or hang out in here and look for someone more knowledgeable than me
