2006-10-06T16:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Anyone know how to run a "root desktop"?
2006-10-06T16:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	it's *not* recommended to log into a graphical environment as root
2006-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	if you need to run a command as root, use gksudo or sudo.
2006-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	(gksudo is for graphical programs and sudo for terminal-based)
2006-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ladydoor	ok, but i am trying use the keyboard layout which is not working
2006-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	please clarify what you mean and perhaps i can help you.

2006-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ladydoor	are you in the thread suggesting how i can create shortcuts to access different language modes?
2006-10-06T05:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	sorry, i was gone...how did it work?
2006-11-15T08:19:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ladydoor	not as developed is a euphemism for it sux
2006-11-15T08:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	killall -s KILL gnomebaker
2006-11-15T08:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ladydoor	thx
2006-11-15T08:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	you might check out k3b or bashburn...i've had a lot of success with the latter, personally :-)
2006-11-15T08:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	and if it doesn't work, you can just hit control-c to kill it.
2006-11-15T08:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	ladydoor	yea, gnomebaker is an inferior application.  I don' tknow bashburn, but K3B is awesome
2006-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	i don't know that it's inferior so much as not as developed yet.
2006-11-15T08:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	livingdaylight	well...that's one way of looking at it, i guess. i just associate "inferior" with "inherently lesser" rather than "under development"
