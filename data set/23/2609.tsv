2009-03-22T16:56:00.000Z	syntax\		whats wrong with pidgin? it crashed like 5 times on me already
2009-03-22T16:57:00.000Z	syntax\		and can anyone help me out with my apache problem?
2009-03-22T16:57:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	Can you ping "localhost" ?
2009-03-22T16:58:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	nope. that figures.
2009-03-22T16:59:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	Can you ping 127.0.0.1 ?
2009-03-22T16:59:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	still can't
2009-03-22T17:00:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	What, even 127.0.0.1 ? What does "ifconfig -a" show?
2009-03-22T17:00:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	or start with "ifconfig lo" for your loopback device, the one with 127.0.0.1 on it
2009-03-22T17:03:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	lstarnes : here's my lo http://pastebin.com/d53796fa7
2009-03-22T17:04:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	not having a loopback address is a problem, since programs rely on it
2009-03-22T17:04:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	Is "iface lo inet loopback" in /etc/network/interfaces file?
2009-03-22T17:06:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	you should add 2 lines: first "auto lo", and then "iface lo inet loopback"
2009-03-22T17:09:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	got it fixed, thanks a bunch :D
2009-03-22T17:09:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	ok!
2009-03-22T17:10:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	i still have issues with pidgin sheesh it keeps on crashing :(
2009-03-22T17:11:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	even now, after loopback is configured? Maybe it crashing was related
2009-03-22T17:17:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	start it from cmdline, and see if there is any error output.
2009-03-22T17:22:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	so far i run'd pidgin without "&" on the terminal its not crashing just yet.
2009-03-22T17:23:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	keep fingers crossed! Oh no, then there's no typing :)
2009-03-22T17:24:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	 an error pop'd up
2009-03-22T17:25:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	Don't know offhand - Let me see if google knows anything about this
2009-03-22T17:32:00.000Z	oCean_	syntax\	sorry, did not find anything that seems related.
2009-03-22T17:39:00.000Z	syntax\	oCean_	oh ok :9
