2011-02-12T19:00:00.000Z	delicious		I'm having trouble loading Ubuntu Netbook Remix from a USB drive, I think the problem is that the BIOS does not recognize the thumbdrive as a boot device. I've used the "universal usb installer" (Windows) to create the USB drive.
2011-02-12T19:00:00.000Z	delicious		But I don't know how to create the USB drive in another way..
2011-02-12T19:01:00.000Z	delicious		Or why the universal usb installer does not create a working drive
2011-02-12T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	are you using an ISO?
2011-02-12T19:02:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	yes, the netbook 10.10 iso
2011-02-12T19:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	did you MD5 test the ISO?
2011-02-12T19:02:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	nope
2011-02-12T19:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	then how do you know it is consistant and complete?
2011-02-12T19:02:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	but that problem would pop up after booting, right?
2011-02-12T19:03:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	now the device does not show itself as bootable
2011-02-12T19:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	maybe, depends where the corruption is, if there is any
2011-02-12T19:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	if the bot info is damaged, it wont boot
2011-02-12T19:03:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	ah ok, I'll try the MD5 check, tia!
2011-02-12T19:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	why don't you check your ISO, so you know if its the image at fault?
2011-02-12T19:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	please MD5 test in future too, if you do it before you use it, you will speed things along
2011-02-12T19:04:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	will do, thanks for the tip
2011-02-12T19:22:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	I've checked the MD5, the iso consistent and correct. Do you know any other reason why my (Asus EEE PC 1201 HA) BIOS won't recognize my USB drive as bootable?
2011-02-12T19:22:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	(iso is consistent...)
2011-02-12T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	delicious	do you have the latest bios?
2011-02-12T19:23:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	I'll check that
2011-02-12T19:28:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	I've got BIOS 0303, the latest I can find on the Asus website is 0302. Any other ideas? (Could there be some flag on the USB drive that is not set?)
2011-02-12T19:31:00.000Z	delicious	ActionParsnip	I think I'll try it with another USB stick.
