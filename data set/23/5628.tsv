2008-01-28T06:31:00.000Z	PyChild		anyway I was here for a question myself, I have troubles starting gnome
2008-01-28T06:32:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	what sort of problems?
2008-01-28T06:33:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	it doesn't start right, even in failsafe mode the desktop, the panel nautilus nothings starts up
2008-01-28T06:33:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	the only thing that starts up is tilda
2008-01-28T06:33:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	 if you have acces to a terminal, try reinstalling nautilus
2008-01-28T06:33:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	tilda is like xterm
2008-01-28T06:33:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	dunno what xterm is either,.,.;)
2008-01-28T06:34:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	like gnome-terminal, a terminal
2008-01-28T06:34:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	if you press alt+f2 you should get a dialog box xome up, and you can type a command in there and select the box that says run in terminal
2008-01-28T06:35:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	alt+f2 doesn't work, if it wasn't for tilda i couldn't do a thing!!
2008-01-28T06:36:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	alt-f2 is provided by gnome-panel isn't it?
2008-01-28T06:36:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	do you have the GDM login screen? i seem to remember there being a way to switch to command line from there
2008-01-28T06:37:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	i HAVE shell access, i even started xchat from my shell, that's not my problem
2008-01-28T06:37:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	wait a min
2008-01-28T06:37:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	in the shell,. type     sudo apt-get reinstall nautilus
2008-01-28T06:38:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	i'll keep it in mind, but i'm almost sure its something else thanks
2008-01-28T06:38:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	are you using compiz, try disabling it
2008-01-28T06:38:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	tribaldata no compiz
2008-01-28T06:39:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	tritium what really surprises me is that when i type gnome-panel things happens, not even a segfault message or something
2008-01-28T06:39:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	tritium i mean nothing
2008-01-28T06:39:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	im stumped then m8,. sorry,. i can only assume that its nautilus or GNOME itself, but i dont no if you can reinstall GNOME
2008-01-28T06:39:00.000Z	PyChild	bod_	thanks
2008-01-28T06:40:00.000Z	bod_	PyChild	thats because the only thing that is broken is your graphical interface,. the hard coding is still working
