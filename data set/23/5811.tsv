2006-08-29T08:50:00.000Z	peteweez		I have an issue with K9Copy and libdvdread.  Whenever I try to copy a dvd with its original menus using K9Copy (without original menus isn't affected), I get a fatal error.  Anybody know anything about this?  Error message from console is available.  System is Debian Sarge/Etch.
2006-08-29T08:51:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	why don't you pastebin your errors and bring us the URL ?
2006-08-29T08:51:00.000Z	peteweez		put it in #flood?
2006-08-29T08:51:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	a pastebin would be better, it'll float away in #flood
2006-08-29T08:52:00.000Z	peteweez	nalioth	ok can you give me a pastebin link?
2006-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	peteweez	nalioth	pastebinned in paste.ubuntu-nl.org under name peteweez
2006-08-29T08:55:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	did it have a URL ?
2006-08-29T08:55:00.000Z	peteweez	nalioth	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21936
2006-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	you can add that URL to your question for best results
2006-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	peteweez		ok
2006-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	peteweez	nalioth	Did the errors make any sense to you?
2006-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	i'm looking, gimme a minute please
2006-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth		!headers
2006-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	unfortunately, i can make nothing of your errors.  keep asking every 5 minutes or so  :(
2006-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	nalioth		!tell Dravas about headers
2006-08-29T08:59:00.000Z	peteweez		OK thanks for your time anyway :).
2006-08-29T08:59:00.000Z	peteweez	nalioth	Obviously it's something to do with libdvdread but I don't know what...I've heard about newer versions of libdvdread having issues with my software, and I have the newer version
2006-08-29T09:01:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	perhaps you can downgrade it ?
2006-08-29T09:02:00.000Z	peteweez	nalioth	Yeah I installed older libs but I don't know how to force the prog to use the old libs and not the new libs.  Do I need to recompile my prog?
2006-08-29T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	remove the newer libs ?
2006-08-29T09:04:00.000Z	peteweez	nalioth	Removing new libs breaks many other packages...not an option.
2006-08-29T09:05:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	i suspect you need a more knowledgable person
2006-08-29T09:05:00.000Z	nalioth	peteweez	keep asking about every 5 minutes
