2010-05-13T20:46:00.000Z	tommy^m		guys, how do i activate the menu in grub2? my laptop just boots right into X, i want the grub menu so i can init=/bin/bash
2010-05-13T20:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	perhaps you should pastebin the following file for people to have a look at... /etc/default/grub
2010-05-13T20:50:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	just wondering what lines to pass to that file to enable the menu
2010-05-13T20:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	do you have a line in there that's like this? --> GRUB_TIMEOUT=xxx
2010-05-13T20:52:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	yes
2010-05-13T20:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	i'm not sure why it's doing that. the default is like a 10 second delay.. or maybe it's only 5 seconds
2010-05-13T20:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	ok, show me that line.. show me what your's has
2010-05-13T20:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	mine is really the following --> GRUB_TIMEOUT=480
2010-05-13T20:53:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	i changed it but still no grub menu, and when in X i cant alt-F2 to get a tty
2010-05-13T20:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	so, i have '480' seconds until it will automatically boot the default(highlighted) OS
2010-05-13T20:54:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	ok, problem is i only runt one OS, so there is no menu for me
2010-05-13T20:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	what about using Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to a virtual console?
2010-05-13T20:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	why not?
2010-05-13T20:55:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	no, it doesnt work, really strange and annoying. I need to install nvidia drivers cause X just hangs. I can move the mouse but there is nothing there
2010-05-13T20:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	you need to be able to edit that file... put your number in there, and then run --> sudo update-grub
2010-05-13T20:57:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	ok im booting the live cd now, going the mount the drive, mount /dev and /proc to the mounted locations and the chroot to the environment
2010-05-13T20:58:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	ok, good luck. don't know i can help with all that. thought you just needed some help with the grub config file. didn't know about all this other stuff
2010-05-13T21:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	you got X working ok with those drivers?
2010-05-13T21:24:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	yes sir :D
2010-05-13T21:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	cool, good deal. get the grub menu figured out ok yet?
2010-05-13T21:25:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	yes, pressing esc made the menu appear :D then booted recovery mode, then init 3 and finally installing nvidia propr. drivers =)
2010-05-13T21:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	tommy^m	cool, good deal! :-) glad you got it sorted out
2010-05-13T21:27:00.000Z	tommy^m	onetinsoldier	haha me to =)
