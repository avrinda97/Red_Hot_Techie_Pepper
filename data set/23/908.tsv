2010-12-19T23:51:00.000Z	keito	pid_	I would put the commands in a script, make it executable and then add the script to the Startup Apps in System>Prefs
2010-12-20T00:02:00.000Z	keito	pid_	sudo chmod +x
2010-12-20T00:03:00.000Z	keito	pid_	sudo chmod +x /path/to/script
2010-12-20T00:04:00.000Z	keito	pid_	np
2010-12-20T00:18:00.000Z	keito	pid_	chmod +x makes a file executable
2010-12-20T00:18:00.000Z	keito	pid_	what do you mean by exe?
2010-12-20T00:20:00.000Z	keito	pid_	?  you need to put the command in a file, name it whatever, eg "startup-script.sh", then if it is on your desktop "sudo chmod +x ~/Desktop/startup-script.sh"
2010-12-20T00:21:00.000Z	keito	pid_	you should look up creating bash scripts on google
2010-12-20T00:22:00.000Z	keito	pid_	the startup-script should begin "#!/bin/bash" as the first line in the text file
