2007-09-27T14:33:00.000Z	cello_rasp		hi. thunderbird isn't finding my account files. Thankfully its there but on start up it opens the usual 'create email account' dialog
2007-09-27T14:33:00.000Z	cello_rasp		is this common?
2007-09-27T14:33:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	when you first start, yeah.. but there's a way of setting your old profile as the default
2007-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	so you don't haev to do that
2007-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	cello_rasp	volantares	this isn't my first start. it just started doing this.
2007-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	if you look at thunderbird help, there should be a thing on migration
2007-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	first start on a new OS/program/whatever
2007-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	cello_rasp	volantares	nope!
2007-09-27T14:35:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	i've done it myself
2007-09-27T14:36:00.000Z	cello_rasp		it was working fine on feisty the day before. Nothing was installed in the time in between. Perhaps a file was corrupted and thunderbird chokes on my dafault account?
2007-09-27T14:38:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	http://www.mozilla.org/support/thunderbird/faq.html#profilemanager ... so what is that then?
2007-09-27T14:39:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	you need to transfer the profile you've been using to the equivalent place, and then run the profile manager and change it so that the profile you transfered is the default
2007-09-27T14:40:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	the two questions at the top of that link will cover everything you need to know
2007-09-27T14:41:00.000Z	cello_rasp	volantares	you misunderstand. I haven't migrated anything. profiles.ini points to the same one it did yesterday, when it loaded it fine. thanks though.
2007-09-27T14:41:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	so what's the problem?
2007-09-27T14:43:00.000Z	cello_rasp	volantares	thunderbird *suddenly* will not open the default profile folder.
2007-09-27T14:43:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	does it open the others?
2007-09-27T14:43:00.000Z	cello_rasp	volantares	i only have one profile
2007-09-27T14:44:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	well make one and see. it could be that the main one is corrupted. i'm sure it can be fixed somehow. don't know personally
2007-09-27T14:44:00.000Z	cello_rasp		thanks for trying to help :)
2007-09-27T14:44:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	you could try making a new one, and then transferring all the files into that profile. not sure if that works, but it's also worth a try
2007-09-27T14:45:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	but my guess is that one of your files has broken
2007-09-27T14:47:00.000Z	volantares	cello_rasp	outside of all that you'll have to go through the thunderbird support pages (it would HAVE to be in there somewhere), or maybe someone else can help.. but you're probably in the wrong channel
