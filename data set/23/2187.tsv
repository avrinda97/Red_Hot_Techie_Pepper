2009-06-03T11:52:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc		I am ready... my log file is at: http://paste.ubuntu.com/187166/
2009-06-03T11:52:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc		this log messages identify that my bios is corrupt.. starting with that... i have more issues
2009-06-03T11:54:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc		Also, i need to know if loading all that bluetooth stuff is ok or normal, because i think that's how i am being hacked
2009-06-03T11:55:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc		I mean, I have no bluetooth devices installed on my system, yet it loads that stuff....
2009-06-03T11:56:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	you're just paranoid
2009-06-03T11:56:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc	bc	How do you know?
2009-06-03T11:57:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc	bc	I mean, you 're saying my log is normal?
2009-06-03T11:57:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	I don't see too much unusual about that dmesg output
2009-06-03T11:58:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	the BIOS may be corrupt message appears to have been written by a non-native English speaker
2009-06-03T11:59:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	or could just be cryptic. probably anticipating buggy phoenix bios, but not necessarily a problem
2009-06-03T12:01:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	also, are you sure your system has no bluetooth capability? if not, the kernel built for the desktop might be anticipating future usage, or something like that.
2009-06-03T12:05:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	looks ok to me assuming you are on supposed to be on the 10 network and your DNS server is in fact 10.3.1.125
2009-06-03T12:05:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc	bc	My mother board is an ASUS model M2NPV-VM, and it does'nt have any mother board bluetooth , and i have no peripherials but a grub hard disk
2009-06-03T12:07:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	no worries. i dont have bluetooth and I see the same messages.
2009-06-03T12:09:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc	bc	Are you sure?
2009-06-03T12:09:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	I'm positive about the bluetooth
2009-06-03T12:10:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	http://pastebin.com/f74a5d9ff
2009-06-03T12:11:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc	bc	I mean, is it normal to have an pan0 interface loaded after booting?
2009-06-03T12:11:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	yes
2009-06-03T12:14:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	none taken
2009-06-03T12:14:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	say what?
2009-06-03T12:15:00.000Z	mib_19lvlcuc	bc	It ain't an accusation....
2009-06-03T12:16:00.000Z	bc	mib_19lvlcuc	okay, I'm going to be going away in a few seconds. but based on what I saw from the pastebin, you look fine to me. good luck.
