2012-01-25T02:29:00.000Z	Mathuin		Actually, if there's any reference documentation for PAM that's newer than the 2006 stuff on kernel.org, that'd be helpful.
2012-01-25T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	so you are SSHing to your phone?
2012-01-25T02:30:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	I am ssh'ing to my home server from work, and the password I enter is the verification code that is displayd on the Google authenticator.
2012-01-25T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	not seen that, what client are you using?
2012-01-25T02:31:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	I installed libpam-google-authenticator and added the requisite lines to /etc/pamd/common-auth.
2012-02-12T01:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	xorg edgers has an update ppa (less fresh more stable)
2012-02-12T02:01:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	I will try to add the xorg-edgers PPA and see if it causes the same trouble.
2012-02-12T02:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	if you just install the driver, then remove it then its ok :)
2012-02-12T02:02:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	I'm here because of a failed installation of 290.10 from Nvidia just so I can do CUDA and OpenCL.  Looks like I can do those if I give up graphics. :-)
2012-02-12T02:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	have you tried an xorg.conf file?
2012-02-12T02:03:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	I let nvidia-xconfig build one but it did not work.
2012-02-12T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	same place, same in all distros
2012-02-12T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	if you run:   sudo nvidia-xconfig    it will make one for you, you can always drop to root recovery console to fix if it makes issues
2012-02-12T02:06:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	I just ran sudo nvidia-xconfig, I'm going to reboot that box and see what happens.
2012-02-12T02:11:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	sorry about that -- was running xchat on that box, heh.  Anyway, the kernel log tells me there's some other driver in the way.  How do I see what kernel modules are installed, and remove them?  modprobe and friends?
2012-02-12T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	try blacklisting nouveau and nv
2012-02-12T02:13:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	just by adding "blacklist nouveau" to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf ?
2012-02-12T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	if you like, you could even make your own file in the modprobe.d folder and it willwork (must have .conf extension)
2012-02-12T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	np man
2012-03-27T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	if you add the command to start the server in /etc/rc.local   (remember to background it with &) it will run at startup
2012-03-27T04:32:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	so something akin to "su - minecraft screen" with the proper .screenrc should do it?
2012-03-27T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mathuin	sounds ok if that does it, remember to background it with an ampersand, or the boot will hang
2012-03-27T04:34:00.000Z	Mathuin	ActionParsnip	I will remember to background it, and put in a few echos so I can see if I forget. :-)
