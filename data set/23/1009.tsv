2010-10-14T01:51:00.000Z	Firartix		Mmh guys i got some kind of issue with wifi... i think it's driver related, but i'm not really sure :(
2010-10-14T01:52:00.000Z	Firartix		i can't get to connect to my school's wi-fi under ubuntu
2010-10-14T01:52:00.000Z	Firartix		it uses hidden SSID and multiple broadcasting access points
2010-10-14T01:52:00.000Z	Firartix		it works fine on Win7 though
2010-10-14T01:52:00.000Z	Firartix		and i heard people saying they had no problem with Ubuntu
2010-10-14T01:52:00.000Z	Firartix		but it just won't work on my comp
2010-10-14T01:53:00.000Z	Firartix		excuse me <_<
2010-10-14T01:53:00.000Z	Firartix		soo well let me' sum it up
2010-10-14T01:55:00.000Z	Firartix		I can't get to connect to my school's Wi-FI network (hidden SSID, multiple access points, and in-browser auth) using Ubuntu. I got no issue on Win7 though. Do you think it's driver related ?
2010-10-14T01:57:00.000Z	LWSDesigns	Firartix	I doubt it I think its the type of encryption they use....like tokens or EAP mode maybe
2010-10-14T01:58:00.000Z	LWSDesigns	Firartix	like software tokens with Radius or anything like that
2010-10-14T01:59:00.000Z	Firartix	LWSDesigns	well
2010-10-14T01:59:00.000Z	Firartix		they don't use any kind of encryption LWSDesigns
2010-10-14T01:59:00.000Z	Firartix		just hidden SSID
2010-10-14T02:00:00.000Z	LWSDesigns	Firartix	hmm thats an issue I can't solve I have the same issue
2010-10-14T02:00:00.000Z	Firartix		aw :/
2010-10-14T02:00:00.000Z	Firartix		okay
2010-10-14T02:00:00.000Z	LWSDesigns		I had a program installed trying to think of name green icon logo on ubuntu 6.06 to solve it
2010-10-14T02:01:00.000Z	Firartix		:o

2010-10-14T02:02:00.000Z	Firartix		mmmh
2010-10-14T02:02:00.000Z	LWSDesigns	Firartix	back then it wasn't an ideal fix I will look into a bit here if you will online for awhile
2010-10-14T02:02:00.000Z	Firartix	LWSDesigns	this hasn't been updated for 2y, isn't the ubuntu integrated wirless manager better?
