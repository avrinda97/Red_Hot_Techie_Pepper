2010-05-06T04:53:00.000Z	silvernode		is there any way to get the latest versions of software over the next 6 months rather than simply bug and security fixes?
2010-05-06T04:53:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	no, ubuntu is not a rolling release distro
2010-05-06T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	use a different distro.  Ubuntu is not the distro for you if you want bleeding edge
2010-05-06T04:55:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	if you like ubuntu, I would recommend debian testing or maybe testing/unstable mix if you are comfortable doing that
2010-05-06T04:57:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	I come from Arch Linux. I was a loyal Ubuntu user for many years before. With the latest release of Ubuntu I am impressed. I was simply trying to see if it was possible to maybe add a repo or something to get the latest and greatest.
2010-05-06T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	just not how ubuntu works.  You could run the development version of ubuntu if you want, but it breaks and is meant for developers and testers
2010-05-06T04:58:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	I was using 10.04 beta for a while so I know what you mean.
2010-05-06T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	honestly, there's not much point in a rolling release.  You probably have a handful of apps that you like and want the latest version of (for some reason; I won't go into that).  If they are popular you can find ppas for them and if they aren't you can maintain them yourself.  So you could use ubuntu that way
2010-05-06T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	is your question "how do I create a new user with the ability to sudo?"
2010-05-06T17:30:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	There used to be a default root account located in Users and Groups. By changing the password you used to be able to access it. There are some instances where sudo does not understand how to pass a command. For this I wish to have root available. I could make another user with admin rights but I find it highly unlikely that root doesn't already exist.
2010-05-06T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	root exists.  But you don't need it.  Just use sudo
2010-05-06T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	why would making a user with admin rights help you?  Anyway, I am telling you that for whatever reason you *think* you need a root account, you do not.  If you want to actually learn as to why this is, you can tell me your reasons, and I'll try to tell you how you would do it with sudo.  If you want to ignore me and think I don't know what I am talking about, yet still want help from me, well...
2010-05-06T17:41:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	passwd only changes the password for the current user.
2010-05-06T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	read the man page.
2010-05-06T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	that's fine, but you should know how to use passwd...
2010-05-06T17:43:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	I assume there is a detailed man page for passwd explaining how to access and change the root password from another user account.
2010-05-06T17:44:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	why are you assuming?  Just read it
2010-05-06T17:44:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	I am, don't worry.
2010-05-06T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	this isn't some magical secret invocation.  This is standard usage of a basic command.  If you aren't comfortable with this, I seriously recommend you learn more about sudo
2010-05-06T17:50:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	Excuse my wild assumptions kind sir. I am not debating whether or not you are correct. I simply have not used Ubuntu in awhile so sudo is not something I have used in a long while. Although maybe I should listen to you and start. Thank you for providing your logical and simple thinking.
2010-05-06T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	basically, most people's complaint about sudo is that they don't like to type sudo before each command (with « sudo -i » you basically get a root shell where all commands are ran with superuser privileges).  There's nothing wrong with using root, there's just no advantage to doing it.  And often, people believe it's "better" somehow mostly because they are unaware of what you can do with sudo.
2010-05-06T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	silvernode	I of course don't expect you to (nor do I want you to) just follow my advice, but at least hear my reasoning and then make your own informed decision.  Apologies if I was harsh earlier regarding reading the man page
2010-05-06T18:11:00.000Z	silvernode	jrib	I have just had no reason to lookup passwd until now. now that I have, I am glad I did.
