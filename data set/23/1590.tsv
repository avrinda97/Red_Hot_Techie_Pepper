2010-01-15T14:59:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	Random hiccup seems to have borked video drivers.
2010-01-19T13:55:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2010-01-19T13:56:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	listen to eastdallas.
2010-01-19T13:57:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	i have 8.10 lol
2010-01-19T13:58:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	Use synaptic package manager and install the "firefox-3.0" package
2010-01-19T14:00:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	is correct...
2010-01-19T14:01:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	what exactly is the latest version of firefox?
2010-01-19T14:01:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	so use the "firefox-3.0" package.
2010-01-19T14:03:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	3.5 is I think... 3.6 and 3.7 still in development, but old versions of ubuntu will obviously lag in versions
2010-01-19T14:03:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	i see their is a 9.04 do u suggest upgrading to it?
2010-01-19T14:06:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	guess you could always try out 9.20 and see if the touchpad works, just running the liveCD should give you an idea..
2010-01-19T14:06:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	9.10 sorry
2010-01-19T14:07:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	im using xubuntu at the moment lol...
2010-01-19T14:08:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	9.10 is with xfce as well.
2010-01-19T14:08:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	ok lemme give it a try lol...
2010-01-19T14:10:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	Linux Mint has a version with fluxbox
2010-01-19T14:10:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	hate linux mint... like a windows mimic
2010-01-19T14:11:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	Or crunchbang, (but I'm sliding offtopic now...)
2010-01-19T14:11:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	one thing at a time...lets start with this fluxbox ;)
2010-01-19T14:13:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	to boot into flux i simply logout and then log into the flux session?
2010-01-19T14:14:00.000Z	arand	_DarkStar_	I've very little experience with flux, listen to koshari ;)
2010-01-19T14:18:00.000Z	_DarkStar_	arand	flux is dam fast
