2011-02-06T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	the terminal is the parent process so killing the parent kills the processes it spawns
2011-02-06T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	create a launcher to run the command or a script and it will run. The parent will be the desktop
2011-02-09T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	can you expand the question please
2011-02-14T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	the default is bash, you can use any shell you desire
2011-02-14T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	you define the users shell in /etc/passwd   you can use dash if you desire (for example)
2011-02-16T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	oocalc   I believe
2011-02-17T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	sure
2011-02-17T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	press ALT+F2 and run:  gegls from outer space
2011-02-17T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	maco2: to stop the fist run:  killall gnome-panel
2011-02-17T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	I already told you
2011-02-17T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	run it in a terminal
2011-02-17T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	its for when you run: sl   instead of:  ls
2011-02-27T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	make a script to cd to the downloads folder then run the command
2011-02-27T00:57:00.000Z	eXpLoD	ActionParsnip	i did that and it tells me 'Failed to execute child process "/home/andrei/Minecraft.sh" (Permission denied)'
2011-02-27T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	then run:   chmod +x /home/andrei/Minecraft.sh
2011-02-27T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	the file extension isn't needed by the way ;)
2011-02-27T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	if you put the command in one of the folders in $PATH then you can call it like you do the other commands
2011-02-27T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	ubuntutweak has a few nice scripts you can add easily
2011-02-27T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	put them ni the nautilus scripts folder in your home folder and they will be used
2011-02-27T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	thats the one, remember to mark the script as executable
2011-02-27T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	the nautilus scripts are good for that
2011-03-03T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eXpLoD	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y upgrade
