2010-07-05T03:22:00.000Z	rethus		where can i see on server1 - that i be ping.... if i ping from my local pc to server1?
2010-07-05T03:22:00.000Z	rethus		which logfiles
2010-07-05T03:23:00.000Z	rethus		or even can i see it with netstat?
2010-07-05T03:23:00.000Z	rethus		i have debian on my server
2010-07-05T03:23:00.000Z	rethus		so i start tcpdump on server1 ?
2010-07-05T03:24:00.000Z	Compiling	rethus	if it has tcpdump yes, if not download wireshark
2010-07-05T03:25:00.000Z	rethus		i have following problem... i have virtualize my server, and have add an ip to an openvz-container... but if i enter the ne added ip, i got an timeout
2010-07-05T03:26:00.000Z	rethus	Compiling	tcpdump does much output. which parms should i use?
2010-07-05T03:28:00.000Z	Compiling	rethus	if you want to filter icmp packets, use tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
2010-07-05T03:28:00.000Z	Compiling	rethus	replace eth0 with the active interface you're pinging
2010-07-05T03:28:00.000Z	rethus		i only will see, if my request comes to this VZ-container.
2010-07-05T03:28:00.000Z	rethus		didn't know which one i need to filter
2010-07-05T03:28:00.000Z	rethus		icmp is ping ?
2010-07-05T03:28:00.000Z	Compiling		oo a t23
2010-07-05T03:29:00.000Z	Compiling	rethus	yes icmp protocol is ping
2010-07-05T03:29:00.000Z	Compiling	rethus	well it will show ping packets
2010-07-05T03:29:00.000Z	Compiling		I dug up this old t61 the other day
2010-07-05T03:29:00.000Z	Compiling		loaded it up with 4G DDR2 and it flies
2010-07-05T03:30:00.000Z	rethus		works well with "tcpdump icmp"
2010-07-05T03:31:00.000Z	rethus		and the ping comes to my VZ-Container. thats good (for the first step
2010-07-05T03:31:00.000Z	rethus		but if i try my new ip, no icmp request comes anymore to my vz :(
2010-07-05T03:33:00.000Z	Compiling	rethus	what new IP are you setting?
2010-07-05T03:33:00.000Z	Compiling	rethus	and how are you setting it?
