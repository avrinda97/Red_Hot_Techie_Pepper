2008-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	gb__		is there anyone who is running a postgres server here?
2008-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	possibly
2008-08-01T08:00:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 sir i'm using pgadmin to conect to my postgres server and i'm not able to correct
2008-08-01T08:00:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	i'll bet you need to edit your /etc/postgres/pg_hba.conf file
2008-08-01T08:00:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	there is no default password
2008-08-01T08:04:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 should i paste that pg_dba.conf file on pastebin?
2008-08-01T08:05:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	uhh, i wouldn't
2008-08-01T08:05:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 ok it says local is enabled
2008-08-01T08:05:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	are you trying to get local logins to work or web or across the network?
2008-08-01T08:09:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 so i should use local login names?
2008-08-01T08:10:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	local   all         postgres                          ident sameuser  <-- something like that?
2008-08-01T08:10:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 yup sir
2008-08-01T08:11:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	are you trying to connect to the postgres database or some other? because that only allows access to the system db named 'postgres'
2008-08-01T08:13:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	i'm trying to connect all the databases on the postgres server on my local system, mostly use mysql, was chking out postgres for first time
2008-08-01T08:14:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	you'll need to edit the file to allow explicit access to another db then
2008-08-01T08:14:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 ok thanks will check that out, thanks again mate
2008-08-01T08:15:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	do you have a line that has 'all' for the databases with 'ident sameuser' for the auth scheme?
2008-08-01T08:18:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 sir i did that , i also changed one more option on it
2008-08-01T08:18:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 changed the ident same user to trust ?
2008-08-01T08:20:00.000Z	gb__	bderrly	 i got in thanks man, ya rock :)
2008-08-01T08:22:00.000Z	bderrly	gb__	nice :)
