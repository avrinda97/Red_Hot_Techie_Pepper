2006-08-30T14:35:00.000Z	Samuli^	gansinho	what file format is it?
2006-08-30T14:36:00.000Z	Samuli^	gansinho	ok. I don't think fat supports permissions like that.
2006-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	Samuli^	gansinho	you have to define permissions in the fstab.
2006-08-30T14:38:00.000Z	gansinho	Samuli^	gid=46
2006-08-30T14:38:00.000Z	gansinho	Samuli^	this should alow me to acess it doesent it?
2006-08-30T14:40:00.000Z	gansinho	Samuli^	in fstab what should I do to give permissions
2006-08-30T14:41:00.000Z	Samuli^	gansinho	if you want to give everyone all rights umask=0000
2006-08-30T14:42:00.000Z	gansinho	Samuli^	 thanks
2006-08-30T14:42:00.000Z	Samuli^	gansinho	umask works just like chmod, only the other way around so you don't give permissions, you take them away with umask.
2006-08-30T14:44:00.000Z	gansinho	Samuli^	 do I need to have any nls ?
2006-08-30T14:45:00.000Z	Samuli^	gansinho	what's nls?
2006-08-30T14:46:00.000Z	Samuli^	gansinho	there's lots on information available about fstab on the google, try it tomorrow :)
