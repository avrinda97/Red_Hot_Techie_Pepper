2012-06-02T07:53:00.000Z	shai	escott	thanks
2012-06-02T08:04:00.000Z	escott	shai	(a) are you selecting gnome-shell or gnome-panel (b) [at least in 11.10] it had a fallback mode that looked like gnome2 but was really gnome3 based
2012-06-02T08:05:00.000Z	shai	escott	i have ubuntu 12.04, i think is gnome-shell but i not shure... i think is gnome.shell and it looks like gnome2 (i said that because the notifications of sound and things like that are of the gnome3)
2012-06-02T08:06:00.000Z	escott	shai	what does ps aux | grep gnome-panel say?
2012-06-02T08:06:00.000Z	shai	escott	semasad  15424  2.5  0.7 638156 31636 ?        Sl   00:00   0:08 gnome-panel semasad  15831  0.0  0.0  13600   932 pts/0    S+   00:06   0:00 grep --color=auto gnome-panel
2012-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	escott	shai	so you are running panel which is a forwardported version of the panel from gnome2 to gtk3 (But many applets were lost) so yes it basically is gnome2. if you are selecting shell and getting panel its probably a graphics card issue
2012-06-02T08:07:00.000Z	shai	escott	i have recent install the graphic card driver...
2012-06-02T08:08:00.000Z	escott	shai	you could try gnome-shell --replace in terminal and see what it says
2012-06-02T08:10:00.000Z	shai	escott	i do the command, and i log off... the same problem... starts gnome2...
2012-06-02T08:10:00.000Z	escott	shai	you mean your gui crashes and you have to login again?
2012-06-02T08:11:00.000Z	shai	escott	mmm... no, something (i think the gui) have said have break... but dosent close... i log off...
2012-06-02T08:11:00.000Z	escott	shai	you are forcibly logged out when you run gnome-shell --replace
2012-06-02T08:12:00.000Z	shai	escott	no... i log off manualy....
2012-06-02T08:12:00.000Z	escott	shai	im confused. why are you logging out?
2012-06-02T08:12:00.000Z	shai	escott	to restart the gui...
2012-06-02T08:12:00.000Z	escott	shai	why?
2012-06-02T08:13:00.000Z	shai	escott	to try reboot gnome, and see if that can fix my problem...
2012-06-02T08:13:00.000Z	escott	shai	i thought the problem was that you wanted gnome-shell. so you run gnome-shell --replace and what happens?
2012-06-02T08:14:00.000Z	shai	escott	ubuntu pop out a mensage of error, but dosent force to me to reboot.
2012-06-02T08:14:00.000Z	escott	shai	so you get an error but gnome-shell doesn't start. what was the error
2012-06-02T08:15:00.000Z	shai	escott	the clasic error of ubuntu founds an error on something... and report it... and on the terminal says: Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2012-06-02T08:15:00.000Z	escott	shai	you dont have the drivers for opengl on you computer
