2011-03-19T21:20:00.000Z	lusmus	ruan	tells me that i need to install that thing to use that command i think..
2011-03-19T21:21:00.000Z	ruan	lusmus	then install it, if you wish to access the gui.
2011-03-19T21:22:00.000Z	lusmus	ruan	i dont know if i choosed right method.. to installing.. i choosed CLI :/
2011-03-19T21:23:00.000Z	ruan	lusmus	that's not stopping you from installing a GUI
2011-03-19T21:24:00.000Z	lusmus	ruan	i thought i
2011-03-19T21:25:00.000Z	ruan	lusmus	i think sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop   should do it?
2011-03-19T21:25:00.000Z	lusmus	ruan	how much diff is it from installing from a livecd.. the main thing is that i wanted to install like live cd but with a command line interface with the installer
2011-03-19T21:26:00.000Z	ruan	lusmus	well its a cli install
2011-03-19T21:27:00.000Z	lusmus	ruan	its why i got like this.. or is it the same on whole cd on altanative cd=
2011-03-19T21:28:00.000Z	ruan	lusmus	well im not sure
2011-03-19T21:28:00.000Z	ruan	lusmus	but as i said, nothing is stopping you from installing ubuntu-desktop and booting it
