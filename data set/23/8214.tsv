2005-04-25T11:24:00.000Z	nickoli		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or

2005-04-25T11:24:00.000Z	nickoli		E: Package gstreamer0.8-mad has no installation candidate

2005-04-25T11:30:00.000Z	chazwurth	nickoli	You might want to take a look at the unofficial starter guide as well ( www.ubuntuguide.org ); I found it helpful as a checklist if nothing else.
