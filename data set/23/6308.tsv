2007-01-09T12:41:00.000Z	macross		been googling this one for a while :  XORG_MANPAGE_SECTIONS: command not found
2007-01-09T12:41:00.000Z	macross		says my aclocal is not define but it is
2007-01-09T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	its not a command, its a variable
2007-01-09T12:42:00.000Z	macross	ikonia	i know that
2007-01-09T12:42:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	so thats the problem ?
2007-01-09T12:42:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	when do you get that
2007-01-09T12:42:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	what are you building
2007-01-09T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	then you shoujld know the basics of software development and required variables
2007-01-09T12:43:00.000Z	macross	ikonia	was there a point to asking me questions
2007-01-09T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	there was a point to me response - but if you don't know anything about what your doing - its dangerous
2007-01-09T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	before you build software it is helpful to know the basics
2007-01-09T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	its clear you don't
2007-01-09T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	XORG_MAN_PAGES - hmmm what could it want
2007-01-09T12:45:00.000Z	macross	ikonia	it's the m4 functions to build it wants
2007-01-09T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	are you sure they are m4's its looking for and not just variables to be extracted from another global m4 script
2007-01-09T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	what makes you strongly sure its M4 (not challanging - asking)
2007-01-09T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	I think its wrong
2007-01-09T12:51:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	FYI: the way its testing for those variables in the configure script is nothing to do with M4
2007-01-09T12:52:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	why would it be a version thing ?
2007-01-09T12:52:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	look at how the configured script is testing for the variable - it gives a big clue
2007-01-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	you do know there is #ubuntu-xgl that specialises in ubuntu on xgl
2007-01-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	just FYI
2007-01-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	macross	yeah, some good guys in there
