2008-07-15T01:46:00.000Z	Michael88		can anyone help me with a problem about the vnc server of ubuntu??
2008-07-15T01:47:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	what's your problem?
2008-07-15T01:48:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	i setteup my vnc...i left home my pc restarted...and now it's in the logon screen of ubuntu and i cant access it remotly
2008-07-15T01:49:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	hmm, couple things to note:  first of all, you will need to open a port on your router to access it remotely.  I believe the port is 5900-- have you done this?
2008-07-15T01:49:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	yes
2008-07-15T01:50:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	ok.  The other thing is (although I'm not *entirely* sure), but I believe you need to be logged into the Ubuntu machine locally before you can connect remotely
2008-07-15T01:50:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	So a good thing to try would be to log in and then try connecting-- do you have an extra laptop or computer you can test with now?
2008-07-15T01:51:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	i'm on my girlsfriend laptop
2008-07-15T01:52:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	but my pc is not responding on vnc viewer
2008-07-15T01:52:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	Have you logged into the Ubuntu machine locally?
2008-07-15T01:53:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	no...i'm not home :(
2008-07-15T01:53:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	ok, I think you may need to have it logged in to work.  The other thing to make sure is that you're using a correct IP address.  Note that it shouldn't start with 192.168..., as this is your local IP
2008-07-15T01:54:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	i have dinamic routable ip
2008-07-15T01:55:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	sorry for the bad english at this hour
2008-07-15T01:55:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	no problem, I can understand you fine  :)  I'm not sure if there's any way we can get VNC working at this point without logging in first  :-/
2008-07-15T01:56:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	damn...this is bad :(
2008-07-15T01:56:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	Do you have SSH set up?  Perhaps logging in there would be enough to start the VNC server
2008-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	i dont think so ..... :|
2008-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	i'll try to connect with putty now
2008-07-15T01:59:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	not respoding with putty
2008-07-15T02:00:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	Ok.  Unfortunately, I think we might be out-of-luck at this point.  However, next time you're home, I've found instructions for making VNC work from the login screen: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC#VNC%20Server%20with%20Login%20Screen%20via%20GDM
2008-07-15T02:01:00.000Z	Michael88	ScottWegner	thanks very much :) for your help
2008-07-15T02:01:00.000Z	ScottWegner	Michael88	no problem.  Good luck
