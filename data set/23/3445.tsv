2010-09-03T21:55:00.000Z	ubuntu		i'm trying to activate my Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03) on hp laptop
2010-09-03T21:55:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	Easiest way is to connect it via Ethernet long enough to download the drivers
2010-09-03T21:57:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	it will show the modaliases or something like that which are needed to detect the wireless card, but you need to connect to the internet to download broadcom drivers
2010-09-03T21:58:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	The driver is called "broadcom-sta" I think
2010-09-03T21:58:00.000Z	ubuntu	undecim	i have the ether.. connected
2010-09-03T21:58:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	As soon as you connect, go to System -> Admin -> Hardware Drivers
2010-09-03T22:00:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	do you see a broadcom driver there?
2010-09-03T22:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	undecim	yes and its "ctivated but not currently in use"
2010-09-03T22:04:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	hmm... it says you need to restart to activate it?
2010-09-03T22:05:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	of course... you'll probably have to load the module manually then... I think it's something like bcm-wl... not sure
2010-09-03T22:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	undecim	is there a way to make it alive via cli
2010-09-03T22:06:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	run "modprobe -l bcm*" and that will give you a list of modules that start with bcm.
2010-09-03T22:09:00.000Z	ubuntu	undecim	i know that the bcm43 is not loaded .. here's the output from the command
2010-09-03T22:13:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	Nothing from kernel/drivers/net?
2010-09-03T22:16:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	can you give me a pastebin of the output of "ls /lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/net"
2010-09-03T22:20:00.000Z	ubuntu	undecim	http://paste.ubuntu.com/487914/
2010-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	Can you make sure that bcmwl-kernel-source is installed?
2010-09-03T22:23:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	when installing, it should do an initial DKMS build of the module and it will be available
2010-09-03T22:31:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	You sill there?
2010-09-03T22:38:00.000Z	ubuntu	undecim	yes.. now the synaptic is showing that the bcmwl-kernel-source is installed
2010-09-03T22:39:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	I forget what the command to build a module with DKMS is. Maybe the man page would help...
2010-09-03T22:44:00.000Z	ubuntu	undecim	thanks for trying to help me.. i have to step out for a couple of hrs..
2010-09-03T22:44:00.000Z	undecim	ubuntu	no problem
