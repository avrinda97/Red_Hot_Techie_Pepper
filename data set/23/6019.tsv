2006-07-06T05:44:00.000Z	kkman		hi
2006-07-06T05:45:00.000Z	kkman		I have a nasty networking problem
2006-07-06T05:45:00.000Z	kkman		I have a pcmcia wifi card from Microsoft (MN-720) and i Use ndiswrapper and windows driver (not microsoft's but someone else's)
2006-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	kkman		My problem is that every now and then the laptop (ubuntu of course) looses connectivity
2006-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	kkman		i can't ping from it anywhere
2006-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	kkman		could anyone assist me ?
2006-07-06T05:46:00.000Z	kkman		please :)
2006-07-06T05:47:00.000Z	narfmaster	kkman	did you try "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"?
2006-07-06T05:47:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	ahh yes. then the network works again! but the problem is that it is a server that i connect from work ... icant restart networking from remote :)
2006-07-06T05:48:00.000Z	narfmaster		wifi on a work server? :p
2006-07-06T05:48:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	not a "server" server ... just a small svn of my stuff :)
2006-07-06T05:49:00.000Z	narfmaster		okay, just thought it was rather strange
2006-07-06T05:49:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	any suggestions?
2006-07-06T05:50:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	any logs i can look at? options to set?
2006-07-06T05:50:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	how do i 'debug' this?
2006-07-06T05:50:00.000Z	narfmaster	kkman	that's a doozy of a problem
2006-07-06T05:51:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	nevertheless... any suspects? the wifi driver maybe?
2006-07-06T05:51:00.000Z	narfmaster	kkman	absolutely
2006-07-06T05:52:00.000Z	narfmaster	kkman	another suspect is the hardware of course
2006-07-06T05:52:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	is there any generic driver i can use?
2006-07-06T05:52:00.000Z	narfmaster	kkman	plus you might have some interference from other devices in the area
2006-07-06T05:53:00.000Z	kkman	narfmaster	then why should network restart fix it?
2006-07-06T05:53:00.000Z	narfmaster	kkman	just my experience in the matter
