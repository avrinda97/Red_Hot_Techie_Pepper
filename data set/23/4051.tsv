2007-11-25T09:39:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	can you help me with pidgin?
2007-11-25T09:40:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	is there some googletalk irc channel?
2007-11-25T09:40:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	I can try...
2007-11-25T09:40:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	Apparently not.
2007-11-25T09:41:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	What are you trying to do with pidgin?
2007-11-25T09:42:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=49147 Isn't helping. Whenever I click on the account is says "Connection Error MYADDRESS@gmail.com/Home disconnected Server requires TLS/SSL for login. No TLS/SSL Support found." So then I try all the options in Advanced, to turn on this or that, and it doesn't connect to googletalk
2007-11-25T09:43:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	I built 2.2.2 for dapper since I couldn't find a repos, nor a .deb even though some say it was/is on getdeb.net .
2007-11-25T09:47:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	ephemient, do I have SSL Support in dapper???
2007-11-25T09:48:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	specifically under pidgin? Did you compile the option in?
2007-11-25T09:48:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	probably not, was unaware.
2007-11-25T09:49:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	I don't know why I have to use SSL anyway, that page doesn't say anything about it at all
2007-11-25T09:50:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	I didn't compile it, am using the one for gutsy from the repos.
2007-11-25T09:52:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	do you think there is a dapper repos which would have done this for me??? I don't need version 2.2.2.
2007-11-25T09:54:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	Why do you specifically want to run pidgin rather than gaim?
2007-11-25T09:56:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	Pidgin is gaim relabelled.
2007-11-25T09:57:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	so then why isn't pidgin working, is it because I didn't compile in? How to:...
2007-11-25T09:58:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	Possibly. Did you do a ./configure --help? Is there an ssl option?
2007-11-25T09:58:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	is there a clean way of 'sudo make uninstall' if I get there?
2007-11-25T09:59:00.000Z	VulcanRidr	q_a_z_steve	You should be able to install overtop of the existing one.
2007-11-25T10:00:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	I'm talking if I do just use gaim
2007-11-25T10:11:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	ephemient nephlim http://q_a_z_steve.pastebin.org/9285
2007-11-25T10:11:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	VulcanRidr	ephemient nephlim should I use something like that?
