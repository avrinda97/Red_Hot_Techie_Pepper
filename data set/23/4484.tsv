2008-07-10T21:44:00.000Z	maszlo		can someone recommend a commandline bin/cue app to burn a dvd?
2008-07-10T21:46:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	dvdauthor is a good one
2008-07-10T21:46:00.000Z	maszlo		I haven't tried anything.. have a process going on devede and stuck a dvdr in want to have it burnt when I get home lol
2008-07-10T21:46:00.000Z	maszlo		I will look at it now.. thanks
2008-07-10T21:47:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	here is some documentation on how to use it http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html
2008-07-10T21:47:00.000Z	maszlo	Soulwarp	you can start the burn from command line or it is for making the bin/cue?
2008-07-10T21:48:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	im not sure about bin/cue but it will make a DVD structure
2008-07-10T21:48:00.000Z	maszlo	Soulwarp	I have the structure.. just don't have access to the computer until after 5.. looking to start the burn through ssh
2008-07-10T21:49:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	oh i see what you mean
2008-07-10T21:49:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	let me look it up
2008-07-10T21:52:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	growisofs -speed=1 -Z /dev/dvd -dvd-video /path/to/your/dvd/structure/files
2008-07-10T21:53:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	that with the -dvd-video command will tell the burner to cread a dvd dvid
2008-07-10T21:53:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	dvd vid even
2008-07-10T21:53:00.000Z	maszlo	Soulwarp	its going to be in bin/cue already.  this mean I have to convert It back out?
2008-07-10T21:53:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	oh it's in bin/cue already....
2008-07-10T21:54:00.000Z	maszlo	Soulwarp	yeah..  I checked modim, seems that its support of bin/cue is not great
2008-07-10T21:56:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	i would think you would have to mount it then run the previous command
2008-07-10T21:56:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	i may be wrong
2008-07-10T21:57:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	having never tested this myself i suggest restating your question in chat for further assistance
2008-07-10T21:57:00.000Z	maszlo	Soulwarp	I think I might have to do something else as well, to get it to an iso so I can use modim... this looks promising  bchunk IMAGE.bin IMAGE.cue IMAGE.iso
2008-07-10T21:57:00.000Z	maszlo	Soulwarp	never herd of bchunk
2008-07-10T21:58:00.000Z	maszlo	Soulwarp	thanks for the help.. will give these commands a chance then ask again if it's a failure
2008-07-10T21:58:00.000Z	Soulwarp	maszlo	good luck, i hope you achieve your goal
