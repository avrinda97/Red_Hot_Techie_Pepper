2010-07-28T15:33:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		which of those do i use for xeon (intel 64bit)
2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		yeh
2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		it lists it as 'amd64'
2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		we run intel
2010-07-28T15:34:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		perhaps amd64 is not the most appropriate name?
2010-07-28T15:35:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		ok cheers
2010-07-28T15:35:00.000Z	SwedeMike	hrhrhr_	it's the name used.
2010-07-28T15:36:00.000Z	SwedeMike	hrhrhr_	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64
2010-07-28T15:36:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		presumably it's now deprecated in 10*
2010-07-28T15:38:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		it's still called amdblah?
2010-07-28T15:38:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		lol
2010-07-28T15:38:00.000Z	SwedeMike	hrhrhr_	yes, because that's the correct name.

2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		how is 'amd' the correct name for a distribution which applies to architecture extending beyond amd?
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	SwedeMike	hrhrhr_	do you thin kit's weird that amd emulated i386? so it's weird that it's called i386 ?
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		citation? :)
2010-07-28T15:39:00.000Z	hrhrhr_		anyway
