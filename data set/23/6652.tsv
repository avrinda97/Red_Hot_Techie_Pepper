2006-02-23T10:17:00.000Z	sovin		I've just installed Firestarter through Automatix -- during every startup I get a 'password request,' that doesn't take my user password.
2006-02-23T10:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	do not use automatix
2006-02-23T10:18:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	why?
2006-02-23T10:20:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	should i uninstall automatix via the instructions on the site or would you recommend reinstalling ubuntu?
2006-02-23T10:21:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	if ubotu's cautions were as serious as they appear; I'm not too sure on my ability to correct the configs (noob).
2006-02-23T10:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	never used it but i would uninstall it anyway you choose
2006-02-23T10:21:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	k -- thanks for the information!
2006-02-23T14:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	you need multiverse enabled i think
2006-02-23T14:32:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	multiverse? what is that? k
2006-02-23T14:32:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	thanks, i'll do that
2006-02-24T07:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	yes
2006-02-24T07:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	you can install them both but sdk should have the runtime enviorn ment
2006-02-24T08:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	you need multiverse enabled
2006-02-24T08:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	make sure its multiverse not backports that you have enabled
2006-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	i haven't done anything of the sort of enabling for multiverse or backports -- only a dl of the java 1.5 sdk.  what topic would your recommend me researching to get on the right track?
2006-02-24T08:12:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	oh, sorry -- just read your message above the last one; I'll look into enabling _multiverse_ then.  Thanks a bunch.
2006-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	can you have ubotu tell me as well?
2006-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	you can also type /msg ubotu azureus
2006-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	sovin	gnomefreak	_jason, and gladiator: thanks ALOT for all the help; I couldn't of gotten bluej/java to run without you guys!
2006-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	Seveas has a package that fixed that problem
2006-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sovin	as i told you yesterday you can get it from Seveas repo/site
