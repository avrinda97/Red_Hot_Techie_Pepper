2005-05-25T11:25:00.000Z	yahalom		can i install ubuntu on my machine and then take the hard drive and put it on another or will i have kernel issues?
2005-05-25T11:26:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	If you use a generic kernel and both machines are x86, you should be ok.
2005-05-25T11:28:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	That was to you.
2005-05-25T11:28:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	thanx
2005-05-25T11:29:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	copy /etc/X11/xorg.conf to someplace safe and run X --configure. then copy resultant file to /etc/X11/xorg.xonf
2005-05-25T11:30:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	Flip between two files as you need to.
2005-05-25T11:30:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	Ther eis probably some ubuntu-friendly way of doing the same thing. :)
2005-05-25T11:30:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	i use adsl so i need to setup my pppoe in x, yet install insists on checking the network repos and it sticks forever i dont know how to get past it
2005-05-25T11:31:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	It shjould not wait forever, but if you need to, enter the hostname into /etc/hosts as 127.0.0.1
2005-05-25T11:31:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	it will timeout right away then.
2005-05-25T11:32:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	so when it asks me for a host name type 127.0.0.1?
2005-05-25T11:32:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	it asks for a host name?  When?
2005-05-25T11:33:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	technically, yes, that should work.
2005-05-25T11:33:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	untested.
2005-05-25T11:33:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	well what did u mean? how can i edit /etc/hosts before i have ubunt installed?
2005-05-25T11:36:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	I thought you had already installed.
2005-05-25T11:37:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	no. i'
2005-05-25T11:37:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	no. i''m talking about during install
2005-05-25T11:38:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	u know how ubuntu want to download updates?
2005-05-25T11:38:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	so it gets stuck there.
2005-05-25T11:39:00.000Z	queuetue	yahalom	You may just have to wait for the timeout - it has to time out eventually.
2005-05-25T11:39:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	ok :) hey is installing ubuntu and then removing gnome and installing xfce a good way to get ubuntu to work for a celeron 500 mhz?
2005-05-25T11:40:00.000Z	yahalom	queuetue	i dont know how else to do it
