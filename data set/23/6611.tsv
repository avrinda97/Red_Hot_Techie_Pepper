2006-03-03T15:37:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	thanks :)
2006-03-03T15:40:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	umount -l /dev/hdc and remount it
2006-03-03T15:42:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	iok
2006-03-03T15:42:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	let me know how it goes
2006-03-03T15:43:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	it tells me this: mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
2006-03-03T15:43:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	good. CDs are readonly.
2006-03-03T15:44:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	okayz so what could i do?
2006-03-03T15:45:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	you should be able to read the cd now
2006-03-03T15:46:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	i cant. the cd is not mounted :(
2006-03-03T15:47:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	damn
2006-03-03T15:47:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	i noticed that that i have to very similar lines on fstab and mtab, maybe thats making the problem?
2006-03-03T15:48:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	backup your mtab and delete the lines refering to the cdrom, this may break something so backup the mtab file
2006-03-03T15:49:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	okay. how do i backup it. Just save the lines on mtab?
2006-03-03T15:50:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	cp mtab mtab_backup
2006-03-03T15:55:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	any luck?
2006-03-03T15:56:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	not really, it says /media/cdrom1 is not mounted (according to mtab)
2006-03-03T15:57:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	did you try mounting it?
2006-03-03T15:58:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	yes. when i type sudo mount /media/cdrom1 or mount /dev/hdc it says: mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
2006-03-03T15:59:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	I'm at the end of my knowledge... sorry
2006-03-03T15:59:00.000Z	NCLife	sundancezephyr	thanks anyway :)
2006-03-03T15:59:00.000Z	sundancezephyr	NCLife	your welcome.
