2007-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	HawkeV		is the reverse to what you're thinking
2007-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	HawkeV		777 - umask
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		022 would give you
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		755
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		or root r/w, world read/execute
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		000 = 777
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		which is world r/w
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		because you are a retard and you just ignored what i said
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	keep it nice
2007-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	rgr
2007-01-01T08:27:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	you only want ECC if your processor is compatible with it
2007-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	well, strictly, it is only useful if the *mainboard* supports it, but yeah.
2007-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	ECC support is not dependent on the CPU
2007-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	raid10 swraid ain't gonna happen
2007-01-01T08:32:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	don't be silly - it's standard on 2.6 kernels
2007-01-01T08:32:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	you're on crack bro
2007-01-01T08:32:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	it won't actually increase performance over raid-5 i software, since you'd have to run raid 0 on top of raid 1 , but it is certainly possible
2007-01-01T08:33:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	please stop talking out of your rear end :)
2007-01-01T08:33:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	heh
2007-01-01T08:33:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	do you have any life experience in a real environment with raid, or is this just what you read on google?
2007-01-01T08:34:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	what do you mean by real life experience ? I run about 50 HP proliant servers with any thinkable combination of raid and hardware controllers, including a cluster setup with a fully redundant MSA1500 w/ 14x 72GB Ultra320 on fibre channel
2007-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	then you should well know that swraid doesn't fly in that environment
2007-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	what environment ? what are you talking about ?
