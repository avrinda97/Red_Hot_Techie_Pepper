2011-05-24T15:59:00.000Z	adam61		hey, i just deselected an option in compiz config settings, it was the unity one, i thought it would just delete the settings but it removed my whole desktop. can someone please help me get it back? thanks
2011-05-24T16:01:00.000Z	adam61		does anyone know how to open compiz config settings manager from terminal?
2011-05-24T16:03:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	once installed, type CCSM in terminal;
2011-05-24T16:04:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	ok thanks. gonna reinstall then i'll do that
2011-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	/usr/sbin/synaptic ==> must to be root
2011-05-24T16:07:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	thanks
2011-05-24T16:09:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	type : sudo aptitude install compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-05-24T16:10:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	ok great thanks. that sounds better than synaptic since there are so many packages there
2011-05-24T16:10:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	in Synaptic, juste type Compiz in the search box and they show you the pakage to install
2011-05-24T16:11:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	ok i have it installed, how do i open it?
2011-05-24T16:12:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	Type CCSM in terminal, it should work now
2011-05-24T16:12:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	You don't have the menu bar on top window?
2011-05-24T16:13:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	no, i don't. it said command not found again; i didn't think it'd be different cause i had it installed before
2011-05-24T16:16:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	i suggest also to install compiz_fusion
2011-05-24T16:19:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	Unity?
2011-05-24T16:20:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	ya, it says "Some edge and key bindings of Plugin Ubuntu Unity Plugin conflict with other plugins. Do you want to resolve these conflicts?"
2011-05-24T16:22:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	ok i'll go for it
2011-05-24T16:24:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	i think i set the first setting properly, but not quite sure what this means: "The new value for the key binding for the action Key to put keyboard-focus on launcher in plugin Ubuntu Unity Plugin conflicts with the action Show Main Menu of the Gnome Compatibility plugin.Do you wish to disable Show Main Menu in the Gnome Compatibility plugin?"
2011-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	what was your problem at the beginning?
2011-05-24T16:27:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	it just said there were compatibility issues in switching back to unity, and should i ignore or resolve them. i clicked resolve and the first was about flip left disable or something. the second i think i should disable it because the "Key to put keyboard-focus on launcher in plugin..." is probably a replacement for the "main menu" am i right?
2011-05-24T16:27:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	yep do it
2011-05-24T16:28:00.000Z	adam61	kamelot314	ok great, everything's back! thank you very much!
2011-05-24T16:28:00.000Z	kamelot314	adam61	no problem!
