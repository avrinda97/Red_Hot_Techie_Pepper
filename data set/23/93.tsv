2012-07-25T18:55:00.000Z	partial_upgrade		Hi, I'm running Ubuntu 10.04. Running update brings up a message to do a partial upgrade, is there a way around this?
2012-07-25T18:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	sounds like your last update was interupted
2012-07-25T18:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	don't worry, that won't move you to a new release
2012-07-25T18:56:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	The partial upgrade shows a list of everything installed to be removed, which is literally everything on the computer.
2012-07-25T18:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	what update got interrupted?
2012-07-25T18:58:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	No idea, I always complete any update successfully.
2012-07-25T18:58:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	when was the last time you did an update?
2012-07-25T18:58:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	A week ago.
2012-07-25T19:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	is there a kernel update in the list?
2012-07-25T19:03:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	I don't know, there's some gnome2 stuff and metacity, and a bunch of libs.
2012-07-25T19:03:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	if there isn't a kernel update in there then go for it
2012-07-25T19:04:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	I did a partial upgrade last year, which caused the computer to stop working. So I want to avoid doing a partial upgrade, and just want to continue with normal updates. Is there a way to do that?
2012-07-25T19:05:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	partial upgrades are only triggered if the previous update failed, you need to go through with them
2012-07-25T19:06:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	I don't have a spare drive for backup, if I do the upgrade and have data loss, can I restore it?
2012-07-25T19:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	not that i know of, you really ought to have a backup
2012-07-25T19:07:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	i wouldn't expect data loss, just an updating of packages
2012-07-25T19:07:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	Thats what worries me about partial upgrades, I lost all my uni work last year.
2012-07-25T19:08:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	if it goes wrong you can mount it from a livecd and recover what you need
2012-07-25T19:08:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	but seriously thats the backwards way of doing it, you should have backups in the first place
2012-07-25T19:09:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	I'll wait another week or two in that case, because I'm getting an extra hard disk.
2012-07-25T19:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	good, better safe than sorry
2012-07-25T19:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	partial_upgrade	i don't mean to lecture you but i find that if you don't have backups you are essentially saying your data isn't worth keeping safe
2012-07-25T19:12:00.000Z	partial_upgrade	ThinkT510	Thanks, I'll get a backup disk, and do the upgrade. I was out of cash for a while, so buying a hard disk was out of the question.
