2008-05-06T21:21:00.000Z	copponex		any synergy users out there? Bueller... Bueller...
2008-05-06T21:21:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	me me
2008-05-06T21:21:00.000Z	copponex		a tcp/ip solution for sharing keyboards and mice
2008-05-06T21:21:00.000Z	copponex		Hello Charbucks! :) Like the name... my input is getting stuck on the client screen
2008-05-06T21:22:00.000Z	copponex		the server is XP pro, client Ubuntu 8.04... all firewalls are turned off for the moment
2008-05-06T21:22:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	thanks ;) are you running hardy?  There's a bug where you have to run synergyc as root
2008-05-06T21:27:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	still there?
2008-05-06T21:28:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	yep
2008-05-06T21:28:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	I sudo synergyc... the debugger shows the clipboard copied over to the client screen, but when I try to move it back to the server nothing happens
2008-05-06T21:28:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	I have to kill the process to get back to the XP box
2008-05-06T21:30:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	sorry, I missed where you said you were running 8.04.  Try killing synergy on the client, then running sudo synergyc -f <server ip>
2008-05-06T21:30:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	bah, sorry bout that, I keep on missing messages :P
2008-05-06T21:31:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	is it only when you use the clipboard that it screws up?
2008-05-06T21:31:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	no, the first time I mouse over to the client I can't go back
2008-05-06T21:32:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	besides cliboard info, I get this: NOTE: synergyc.cpp,247: connected to server INFO: CScreen.cpp,98: entering screen
2008-05-06T21:33:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	On the server side, the last info is DEBUG:send clipboard 0 to "ltop" size=4 DEBUG:send clipboard 1 to "ltop" size=4
2008-05-06T21:34:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	hrm, that is weird.  I find I get stuck sometimes moving back and forth, but it always eventually starts working... like after a minute or two
2008-05-06T21:35:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	have you explicitly configured i.e. Server left of Client, Client right of Server?  You need to put both
2008-05-06T21:36:00.000Z	copponex		two links in the windows setup? that would make sense, eh? :)
2008-05-06T21:36:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	I'll try that now... thanks
2008-05-06T21:36:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	hopefully that should work.  It can't infer from "C is left of S" that "S is right of C"
2008-05-06T21:38:00.000Z	copponex	Charbucks	Thanks! works perfectly now... I'll do a better job of RTM next time
2008-05-06T21:38:00.000Z	Charbucks	copponex	Awesome, glad to hear it works.
