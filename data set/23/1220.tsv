2011-02-28T06:00:00.000Z	Isonyx		Heyo, question. I'm trying to use the HTTPRequest function in PHP under ubuntu..I have Xampp set up and apache and such running via xampp. It says to use the HTTPRequest extension you need to enable it but adding it to php.ini. I found the location of php.ini for xampp which is /opt/lampp/etc but I added it and ti dosen't seem to work correctly. Can anyone help me out?

2011-02-28T06:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	Isonyx	I don't know the answer to that but why on earth would you install xampp instead of the standard install available?
2011-02-28T06:03:00.000Z	Isonyx		It was the fastest to install.
2011-02-28T06:03:00.000Z	Isonyx		ughh
2011-02-28T06:03:00.000Z	Isonyx		Alright.
2011-02-28T06:03:00.000Z	Isonyx		Thanks for the help.
2011-02-28T06:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Isonyx	not really.  sudo tasksel .. select LAMP.. enter
2011-02-28T06:04:00.000Z	Isonyx	Scunizi	what does it do?
2011-02-28T06:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	Isonyx	sudo tasksel brings up a menu of a bunch of stuff you can install including LAMP.. The L is linux of course.. the rest is Apache, MySQL and PHP
2011-02-28T06:06:00.000Z	Isonyx		ah
2011-02-28T06:06:00.000Z	Isonyx	Scunizi	After you click enter nothing seems to happen. Has everything been installed?
2011-02-28T06:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	Isonyx	well.. by installing xamp you've installed some version of apache mysql and php.. which one's I don't know.. If you want supported versions uninstall xamp and reinstall using the preferred methods.
2011-02-28T06:07:00.000Z	Isonyx		Ahh.
2011-02-28T06:07:00.000Z	Isonyx		Alright.
2011-02-28T06:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	Isonyx	was xamp a download? and if so was it a .deb file or something else?
2011-02-28T06:08:00.000Z	Isonyx		When you install Lamp from tasksel how exactly does it work? On xampp you can upload files to localhost via ftp..
2011-02-28T06:08:00.000Z	Isonyx	Scunizi	I actually don't remember.
2011-02-28T06:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	Isonyx	you running a separate box for the install?
2011-02-28T06:10:00.000Z	Isonyx		Seems like to much trouble since I did it the more inconvenient way.
2011-02-28T06:10:00.000Z	Isonyx		I'll see if I can find something that will help in xampps user manuals.
2011-02-28T06:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	Isonyx	are you new from the windows world?
