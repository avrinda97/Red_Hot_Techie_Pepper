2008-03-19T01:19:00.000Z	leeping2008		Hi there, I really need to install kernel 2.6.22-15 (the current one is 2.6.22-14).  What's the fastest way to do this?
2008-03-19T01:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	2.6.22-15 does not exist afaics (untill they release it)
2008-03-19T01:21:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	does that mean I need to build a deb file with make-kpkg?
2008-03-19T01:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	there are no sources for 2.6.22-15 either. kernel.org 2.6.22.15 or 16 or whatever is *not* the same as 2.6.22-15 ubuntu release
2008-03-19T01:24:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	it's true that there are no source,s I was thinking of downloading the kernel source from kernel.org
2008-03-19T01:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	well keep in mind that ubuntu kernel includes a lot of external device drivers so check if your hardware is supported by vanilla (kernel.org) releases
2008-03-19T01:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	you can try to install just the kernel deb from hardy (packages.ubuntu.com)
2008-03-19T01:26:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	that's what I did previously.  I'm getting very strange problems with the Hardy kernel
2008-03-19T01:29:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	a computational chemistry program that I use will crash randomly on the Hardy kernel.  I'd rather stay closer to 2.6.22-14 if I could
2008-03-19T01:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	what do you need that the current gutsy kernel does not provide?
2008-03-19T01:30:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	I'm running an AMD64 system with 8GB of RAM.  The Attansic L1 network driver with pre-2.6.22.15 kernels will cause kernel panics in this configuration
2008-03-19T01:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	well if you have that iron maybe it is time to learn how to build and roll your own kernels ;P
2008-03-19T01:32:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	the 8GB systems that I'm describing are part of a Beowulf cluster; the master node uses the 2.6.22.14 kernel.  Programs compiled on the master node are served via NFS to the slave nodes, but since they're compiled using 2.6.22-14 I suspect they're crashing on the systems that are running 2.6.24-8
2008-03-19T01:32:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	I guess that's what I gotta do. :)
2008-03-19T01:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	good luck
2008-03-19T01:34:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	in case my hardware is not supported by the vanilla kernel, I'll rebuild the restricted modules package as well.  Thanks :)
2008-03-19T01:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	on stable release only a serious bug or exploit can make ubuntu devs release a new kernel
2008-09-02T19:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	screen is meant to be used without mouse. do not think you can do what you want
2008-09-16T18:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	what's wrong woth .bashrc?
2008-09-16T18:37:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	here's the thing.  I have a long MOTD on my remote computer's account that I like to look at when I log on ... but I also frequently "jump" between the remote computer and local computer, in which case I don't want to redisplay the MOTD.
2008-09-16T18:38:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	thus what I've done is to have an environment variable in .profile (export MOTD=1), and my .bashrc has if [ MOTD == 1 ]; then ~/bin/logon.py; fi.  When I invoke the "jump" command, I set MOTD to zero before invoking bash
2008-09-16T18:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	leeping2008	.profile is only read on login shells
2008-09-16T18:42:00.000Z	leeping2008	erUSUL	thank you :)
