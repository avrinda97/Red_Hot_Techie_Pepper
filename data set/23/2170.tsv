2010-09-24T00:31:00.000Z	Name141		does anyone know if ubuntu-server will install desktops? Or will I have to start over from a desktop version of ubuntu ?
2010-09-24T00:31:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	Ubuntu server does not come with a desktop by default
2010-09-26T05:49:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	yeah
2010-09-26T05:50:00.000Z	Name141	edbian	would xfce (xubuntu) run 'that much better' than Gnome on old hardware?
2010-09-26T05:50:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	In my opinion they run the same.
2010-09-26T05:50:00.000Z	Name141	edbian	I'm thinking I might as well install Ubuntu since I have the ubuntu disk.
2010-09-28T04:38:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	you purge it first then install it.  It won't take care of ~/.files though  those you have to delete manually
2011-05-23T04:31:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	they'll have to come up with something when the options are KDE 4, Gnome 3, xfce 5, etc etc
2011-05-28T21:31:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	libreOffice is an open source community project.  Openoffice is controlled by oracle
2011-05-28T21:32:00.000Z	Name141	edbian	It looks and "Feels" the same to me.
2011-05-28T21:32:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	Many distros switched to libreOffice because it is more free
2011-05-28T21:32:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	libreOffice is a fork of openOffice.  Originally they were identical.  Now they are nearly identical
2011-05-28T21:33:00.000Z	Name141	edbian	sort of like Fedora vs Red Hat ? One is "more free" ?
2011-05-28T21:33:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	Except Fedora is still controlled by the red hat corporation
2011-05-28T21:33:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	So that's not really a good analogy
2011-05-28T21:35:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	they are nearly identical at this point because the fork happend like 2 months ago
2011-05-28T21:37:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	Both versions are open source so both versions work on all platforms that have a C compiler (pretty much all compilers)
2011-05-28T21:37:00.000Z	Name141	edbian	OK, but any reason to go all Patriotic on Libre and boycot the OpenOffice?
2011-05-28T21:38:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	Actually it's even more convoluted now because Oracle recently 'gave' openoffice to the community so now they're both pretty much the same in every way except branding
2011-05-28T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	My advice is to not fix what isn't broke.  Leave openOffice on the machines that have it until you have a problem there
2011-05-28T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	Leave libreOffice on those machines.  They're completely compaitable anyway
2011-05-28T21:40:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	I can guess you can switch if you have a problem with anonymous community members vs. anonymous oracle employees
2011-05-28T21:41:00.000Z	edbian	Name141	:)  Glad we could help
