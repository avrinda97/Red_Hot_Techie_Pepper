2012-04-30T06:01:00.000Z	xubuntu		I think its corrupted
2012-04-30T06:01:00.000Z	xubuntu		gparted didnt open at all, only could access from disk util
2012-04-30T06:01:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	 does dmesg tell you anything?
2012-04-30T06:01:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	daemon inhibited, cannot mount or something like that
2012-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	errors pointed towards closing windows system improperly that damaged file system but why is whole drive experiencing errors/ there is ubuntu on other side
2012-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	is gparted running by chance?
2012-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	I terminated it cause it was hanging on scaning device, couldnt scan
2012-04-30T06:03:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	do you see it in a ps still?
2012-04-30T06:03:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	it may not have closed completely
2012-04-30T06:04:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	problem is deeper I think, when i am trying to install os on top of another partition, installation cant even lead to partition utility, its ha? :S
2012-04-30T06:06:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	i would expect a different error from corrupted drives (i did some file system fuzzing a while back and seen tons of corruption errors) could you double check that gparted is actually dead
2012-04-30T06:07:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	i ll check from task manager one sek
2012-04-30T06:24:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	i am still betting on gparted being hung
2012-04-30T06:25:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	I terminated it and how do I open disk util from terminal ?
2012-04-30T06:26:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	is it gone from the ps listing?  i would try the reboot violinappren suggested and see what happens then
2012-04-30T06:27:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	I am alreadt from live session
2012-04-30T06:27:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	did you reboot after you had the issues with gparted?
2012-04-30T06:28:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	i had problems because I cant even boot in any system, whole drive is corrupted
2012-04-30T06:28:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	right so have you rebooted the live environment since the gparted issues
2012-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	and I rebooted generally 500 times with different live cds and stuff
2012-04-30T06:33:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	your partition table is valid enough for fdisk to read it and identify the partitions, what live image are you using now? and to confirm you haven't run gparted on this current boot, correct?
2012-04-30T06:45:00.000Z	xubuntu	b^j	yes  I havent run gparted on xubuntu 12.04 it failed cause of my corrupted windows partition that could have had damaged whole drive ?
2012-04-30T06:49:00.000Z	b^j	xubuntu	that is odd, not sure i would expect different errors for corruption, like bad superblock.  have you tried fscking the linux partition and seeing what it says?
