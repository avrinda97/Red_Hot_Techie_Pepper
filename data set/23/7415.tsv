2005-08-06T07:02:00.000Z	Cin		lol
2005-08-06T07:02:00.000Z	mada	Cin	well ... when xscreensaver runs for a while, it crashes xorg, and that locks up my entire system, i can't even alt+tab+F1
2005-08-06T07:03:00.000Z	mada	Cin	any ideas?
2005-08-06T07:04:00.000Z	mada	Cin	swap file sorted?
2005-08-06T07:05:00.000Z	mada	Cin	no, i run gkrellm and then erun the screensaver for a few minutes and then move my mouse to see how my system is holding up ... it seems fine, only using a little over half the ram
2005-08-06T07:07:00.000Z	mada	Cin	any ideas?
2005-08-06T07:10:00.000Z	mada	Cin	i've been googling the hell out of it ... i've been a debian user for about 4 years and never had a problem, i read up on ubuntu and liked the idea of it, so i installed it on this old machine to try it out ... i like it, but i have a little problem :P
2005-08-06T07:12:00.000Z	mada	Cin	naw ... i don't think it is a generic issue, i've never had a problem with xscreensaver, even in the years i spent on both redhat and slackware :/
2005-08-06T07:15:00.000Z	Cin	mada	http://draves.org/HyperNews/get.cgi/flame.html?inline=-1
2005-08-06T07:15:00.000Z	mada	Cin	just a minute ... lemme see
2005-08-06T07:17:00.000Z	Cin	mada	i don't fully understand much of linux yet... so it's probably irrelevant lol
2005-08-06T07:17:00.000Z	Cin	mada	made the switch from windows to linux, heh
2005-08-06T07:18:00.000Z	mada	Cin	lol, fair enough ... i will take a look into it
2005-08-06T07:18:00.000Z	mada	Cin	good for you, i did that a few years ago and have been so happy with it
2005-08-06T07:18:00.000Z	mada	Cin	and the thing about debian and debian based distros is that once you install it once, get your base setup working ... you never have to re-install EVER
