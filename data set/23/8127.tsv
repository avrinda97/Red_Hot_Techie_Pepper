2005-01-21T09:27:00.000Z	Crane		is there a way to do a minimal install of Ubuntu?
2005-01-21T09:27:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	yes... 'custom' at the installer prompt...
2005-01-21T09:28:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	or if you really like headaches... 'expert'  :P
2005-01-21T09:28:00.000Z	Crane	trey3	Cool thanks
2005-01-21T09:28:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	yw  :)
2005-01-21T09:29:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	hah... hoary is being very friendly to me right now  :)
2005-01-21T09:30:00.000Z	Crane	trey3	 me too...now, but it didn't want to install from cd
2005-01-21T09:30:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	ahh... I haven't tried that method... only via dist-upgrades...
2005-01-21T09:31:00.000Z	Crane	trey3	stick with dist-upgrade, cd didn't install xorg, any type of desktop either
2005-01-21T09:31:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	just apt-get install xserver-xorg after install...
2005-01-21T09:32:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	didn't get pulled in automatically here either..
2005-01-21T09:32:00.000Z	Crane	trey3	thats what I ended up doing. using apt for xserver, gnome, and fluxbox
2005-01-21T09:36:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	depending on your definition... Operating System is usually kernel or kernel and libc etc...
2005-01-21T09:37:00.000Z	Crane	trey3	I agree
2005-01-21T09:44:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	get out of the dir (and close windows pertaining to it) and umount it...
2005-01-21T09:47:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	what all is running right now... and are you at a terminal (if you're at a terminal, type 'cd' and try again...
2005-01-21T09:51:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	no really... 2.6 doesn't use /dev/cdromX anymore..
2005-01-21T10:05:00.000Z	Crane	trey3	yep
2005-01-21T10:06:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	you mean kde-base
2005-01-21T10:07:00.000Z	Crane	trey3	I was guessing :)
2005-02-16T10:09:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	whats it saying?
2005-02-16T10:09:00.000Z	trey3	Crane	well... at least it was nice enough to tell ya  ;P
