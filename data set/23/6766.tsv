2006-01-08T07:43:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	So it is a bot. Hmm...
2006-01-08T07:44:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	yes, we use him to talk to n00bs :-D
2006-01-08T07:44:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	Are you familiar with Ubuntu good enough? Maybe you can explain some things to me?
2006-01-08T07:45:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	i'm not an expert but I'll be willing to help out on anything I know
2006-01-08T07:47:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	So will all of my hardware work with Ubuntu?
2006-01-08T07:49:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	there is one thing that concerns me...your graphics card....I am not familiar with ATI video cards and I know Linux might take some configuration to get different v-cards working
2006-01-08T07:49:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	also, no idea about your video capture device...never even worked with one before....
2006-01-08T08:06:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	GNOME and KDE are windows managers, they have their own set of programs and ways to display programs and stuff...its a matter of preference which one you use. those are the most popular ones, but there are also others (of which I have no experience yet)
2006-01-08T08:18:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	Thanks. But which one resemble WinXP more? KDE or GNOME?
2006-01-08T08:19:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	KDE
2006-01-08T08:19:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	I prefer gnome though :-D
2006-01-08T08:19:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	Why GNOME?
2006-01-08T08:20:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	I like the applications bar, it's cleaner looking, I like the programs better, I find it prettier...hard to explain, matter of personal preference I guess
2006-01-08T08:34:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	Is it possible to try both, GNOME and KDE, and then stay with one of them?
2006-01-08T08:34:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	yes, in fact i believe the default Ubuntu installation has both installed and you select which session you want to use at login
2006-01-08T08:49:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	Is there something like FAR manager for Ubuntu? http://farmanager.com/screens.php?l=en
2006-01-08T08:50:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	for textmod?
2006-01-08T08:50:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	I mean, in text mode only?
2006-01-08T08:51:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	Well, it works in window mode in XP and it is text window.
2006-01-08T08:51:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	midnight commander :-D
2006-01-08T08:51:00.000Z	motorsep	skon	But it's really comfortable since I love Norton Commander for DOS :P
2006-01-08T08:55:00.000Z	skon	motorsep	check it out yet?
