2007-08-21T09:19:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Budwaa	ok, is the account your run under a Vhosted websiet on that server, or is this the root website? or what's the situation?
2007-08-21T09:19:00.000Z	NET||abuse		!backports
2007-08-21T09:20:00.000Z	Budwaa	NET||abuse	this is on my personal machine not a webserver of any kind
2007-08-21T09:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Budwaa	oh.. ok.
2007-08-21T09:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Budwaa	well then your apache is probably running as unprivilidged user,,
2007-08-21T09:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Budwaa	and since this is only on your local laptop or whatever,, don't worry, just chmod 777
2007-08-21T09:20:00.000Z	Budwaa	NET||abuse	what does apache haveto do with this?
2007-08-21T09:21:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Budwaa	Oh crap, I missread your question
2007-08-21T09:21:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Budwaa	fusermount.. riiight.
2007-08-21T09:21:00.000Z	Budwaa	NET||abuse	yeah thats the one.
2007-08-21T09:22:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Budwaa	bleh... emm, usually you have to just figure out how to give your personal user access to the device,, the best way is to add yourself to the group with such permissions..
