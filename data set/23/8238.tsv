2004-11-15T11:59:00.000Z	x0563511		"Can't get address for smb" when i try "mount smb://L103/c$ /windows"
2004-11-15T12:00:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	is L103 in your hosts file, or is it resolveable by Samba through WINS or DNS ?
2004-11-15T12:00:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	its resolvable through netbios (WINS, i think)
2004-11-15T12:01:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	as is, the station is being recognised under network as L103
2004-11-15T12:01:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	the $ is required, its a part of the share name
2004-11-15T12:01:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	makes it appear hidden (its the hidden administrative share)
2004-11-15T12:02:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	hmm ... I don't like NetBIOS and window's pechant for "$"s ... not quite sure ... maybe escape it ... or unhide it
2004-11-15T12:03:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	well, gnome can read it fine using SMB://L103/c$
2004-11-15T12:03:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	yes ... but that doesn't mean Samba will like the syntax ...
2004-11-15T12:04:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	ill test it with mount before i fstab it
2004-11-15T12:19:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	any standard VNC client will work
2004-11-15T12:19:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	er, is the windows remote desktop a VNC client?
2004-11-15T12:31:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	indeed :) Remote X is better though
2004-11-15T12:32:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	you have to install an X server on windows (if VNC floats your boats, that's all you need)
2004-11-15T12:34:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	very much easier than hooking it into the keyboard and other peripherals directly, plus you can use the desktop itself
2004-11-15T12:34:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	what do you mean "over a standard cable provider" you mean VNCing someone's desktop via the internet ?
2004-11-15T12:34:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	IE leaving my laptop at home, and VNCing it from my university
2004-11-15T12:34:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	it would be tolerable ... but would flood bandiwdth ... it is very difficult to control in that regard
2004-11-15T12:35:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	heh im OK with that...
2004-11-15T12:35:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	it would flood your Uni's bandwidth too ...
2004-11-15T12:35:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	its capped at 75kb/s
2004-11-15T12:35:00.000Z	x0563511	mercurus	per server... so downloading is not that bad
2004-11-15T12:36:00.000Z	mercurus	x0563511	I'd check with Uni admins before I did it ... otherwise you might be accused of a DoS ...
