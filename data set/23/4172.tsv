2008-03-07T16:54:00.000Z	qos_		hey guys ... i am trying to get my ipod running with ubuntu. i found a kernel module which seems to work fine... but i don't know what the author means with "location of your linux tree" in the following line: make -C <the location of your linuxtree> M=`pwd` modules
2008-03-07T16:56:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	??? Kernel modules? What instructions are you following and what is your ubuntu version?
2008-03-07T16:58:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	instructions are here http://de.pastebin.ca/931871, 2.6.22-14-generic, ubuntu 7.10
2008-03-07T16:59:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		qos and what program are you using to manage your music? Rythmbox, exaile, amarok?
2008-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		oh, qos_ You said " i am trying to get my ipod running with ubuntu", but you really want to get your iphone going.
2008-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	no ipod touch ...
2008-03-07T17:01:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	Well, you pasted instructions about a kernel module that charges and iphone when plugged into your computer.
2008-03-07T17:02:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	thats my problem at the moment ...  it is not recharing with linux
2008-03-07T17:02:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		But you have an ipod touch. Not an iphone qos_ What makes you think that will work?
2008-03-07T17:03:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	the module is for the ipod touch
2008-03-07T17:04:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	you can see the project details here ... http://matt.colyer.name/projects/iphone-module/
2008-03-07T17:04:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	So let me get this straight. You've got an ipod touch, which you have working with ubuntu. The only thing that isn't working, is that it doesn't charge when connected. Is that right?
2008-03-07T17:05:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	right :) ... and for this there is a module or i think they call it driver
2008-03-07T17:05:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	Did you follow these instructions to get it working? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone
2008-03-07T17:06:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	yeah
2008-03-07T17:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	Ok... well, at least I'm up to speed now if not very helpful. :P And what was the problem with the instructions, they didn't work?
2008-03-07T17:08:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	i don't understand what the location of my linux tree is...
2008-03-07T17:09:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	I don't know either.
2008-03-07T17:10:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	are you familiar with compiling?
2008-03-07T17:13:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	I can follow instructions. And I used to compile my own kernel back in the dapper days, but no more. Aside from that kernel tree thing though, it doesn't look too hard.
2008-03-07T17:13:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		Try just asking about that single line qos_
2008-03-07T17:14:00.000Z	qos_	ArthurArchnix	didn't start this whole thing with my question about that single line? ;)
2008-03-07T17:15:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	qos_	Yup. But because you said "my ipod" I was concerned you were doing something really wrong. I just wanted to make sure you weren't a noob following bad advice.
