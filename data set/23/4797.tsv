2007-10-22T15:21:00.000Z	Wamphyri		is it ok to ask questions about bind and dns?
2007-10-22T15:22:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	don't ask to ask ... just ask.
2007-10-22T15:25:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	have you disabled ipv6?
2007-10-22T15:28:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	yes sir
2007-10-22T15:28:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	pretty sure i have anyways
2007-10-22T15:29:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	check ifconfig and see if there are any ipv6 addresses listed.
2007-10-22T15:30:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	http://pastebin.com/ma05b012
2007-10-22T15:31:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	i see that ... disable ipv6 by adding - blacklist ipv6 ... to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist - reboot, and check again.
2007-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	thanks, rebooting now
2007-10-22T15:33:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	same issue
2007-10-22T15:34:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	try changing dns servers ... www.opendns.org
2007-10-22T15:46:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	hmmmm
2007-10-22T15:47:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	still nothing?
2007-10-22T15:47:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	what should i do with opendns i added them to the forwarding
2007-10-22T15:47:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	check the howto ... they have directions for ubuntu.
2007-10-22T15:58:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	would the resolv.conf lacking nameservers do it?
2007-10-22T15:59:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	i don't think so.  if i remember correctly recolv.conf gets overwritten every session anyway.
2007-10-22T16:00:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	i think it still gets overwritten.  you could always specify the ip in /etc/hosts ... lol
2007-10-22T16:01:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	doesn't get overwritten but lol
2007-10-22T16:02:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	well, it can't hurt anything to try specifying them in resolv.conf either way.
2007-10-22T16:03:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	i'm stuck.  sorry.
2007-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	Wamphyri	dmizer	its ok :) thanks
2007-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	dmizer	Wamphyri	it's only that one url?
