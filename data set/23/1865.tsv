2009-10-23T04:43:00.000Z	Gratz474		:(
2009-10-23T04:44:00.000Z	Gratz474		i feel i can figure it out though but blah
2009-10-23T04:45:00.000Z	Gratz474		how can i restart X without closing all the applications?
2009-10-23T04:46:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	System/Preferences/Startup Applications, Options tab, remember applications when I log out
2009-10-23T04:48:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	no idea, I have nvidia too and firefox scrolls fine
2009-10-23T04:48:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	how about on facebook?
2009-10-23T04:49:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	although, do you have smooth scrolling enabled?
2009-10-23T04:49:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	I don't have a facebook account so I don't know
2009-10-23T04:50:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	i do not
2009-10-23T04:50:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	the only time scrolling is slow for me is on sites that put several flash applications on a page, but that is more of a flash issue than a firefox one
2009-10-23T04:52:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	yea but i am sure you have a much higher one
2009-10-23T04:54:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	I don't know I only have a nvidia geforce 6800, it is kind of old
2009-10-23T04:54:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	yes, this is just super temporary
2009-10-23T05:00:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	I doubt it
2009-10-23T05:01:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	i have experienced a performance improvement from going from 32 to 16 before
2009-10-23T05:01:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	give it a shot then, I haven't noticed any difference, unless of course it was through vnc or something, cause then smaller images to send over the network
2009-10-23T05:03:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	i mean will i see a visual difference though with the quality of my desktop?
2009-10-23T05:04:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	probably not, there are differences, but they really aren't noticable most of the time
2009-10-23T05:05:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	do you have any idea on that ?
2009-10-23T05:08:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	the allow flipping is to allow opengl to page flip if possible
2009-10-23T05:09:00.000Z	Gratz474	trism	let me do a restart
2009-10-23T05:10:00.000Z	trism	Gratz474	and sync to vblank means that opengl applications will swap buffers during the vertical retrace
