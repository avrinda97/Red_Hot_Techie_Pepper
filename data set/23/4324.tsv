2008-11-07T05:24:00.000Z	jpastore		so the upgrade to 8.10 didn't go so well. it aborted. I'm afraid to reboot because it said my system might be unstable....what should I do?
2008-11-07T05:25:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	did you try running the upgrade again?
2008-11-07T05:25:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	yes...it says my system is up to date.
2008-11-07T05:26:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	u maybe ok mine did the same thing. I just had to install the NV driver afterwards through hardware drivers
2008-11-07T05:27:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	I have the nvidia drivers so I can recompile for the new kernel if need be
2008-11-07T05:27:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	I'll give it a reboot and see what happens
2008-11-07T05:28:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	system>Admin>Hardware drivers
2008-11-07T05:59:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	so it rebooted ok. had to enable the restricted driver for nvidia...but everything in evolution is showing up as if there is no spell check dictionary and it's trying to spell check. everything is underlined...is there a package I need to reinstall
2008-11-07T06:01:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	my evolution is doing the same thing (or I can't spell chit!) are you running Office 3.0?
2008-11-07T06:02:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	what driver did you enable for NV?
2008-11-07T06:03:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	if ya plan on running twin view or 2 x sessions use the 173 driver the 177 is bugged
2008-11-07T06:03:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	I enabled version 177 and I'm not sure if office got upgraded
2008-11-07T06:03:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	nah it's on my laptop
2008-11-07T06:04:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	I also get an error about python-setuptools
2008-11-07T06:04:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	yea it doesn't do that in my laptop, maybe reinstall office
2008-11-07T06:05:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	try system>admin>update mgr
2008-11-07T06:06:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	I did. I'll try it again.
2008-11-07T06:07:00.000Z	jpastore	sysdoc	update mgr says I'm up to date
2008-11-07T06:07:00.000Z	sysdoc	jpastore	POS lol
