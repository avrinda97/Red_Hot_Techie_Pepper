2012-11-01T10:02:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	Is the modem/router configured for DHCP?
2012-11-01T10:04:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	Is that wireless modem-router connected to a ADSL or DSL modem?
2012-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	aln	rootbrian	I think it is DHCP. see this please: http://up.download.ir/di-V9D3.png
2012-11-01T10:14:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	Did you configure the PPPoE settings correctly from within the modem itself?
2012-11-01T10:19:00.000Z	aln	rootbrian	In Windows it is working correctly
2012-11-01T10:20:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	I guess the manufacturer didn't intend it to work with Linux. I suggest getting a refund and going about the ADSL/DSL modem and router individually if possible, like i'm doing. It's less trouble.
2012-11-01T10:21:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	i'm thinking bridge is the only way it'll work.
2012-11-01T10:26:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	If you intend to tether to your cellular phone, you'll need either a USB bluetooth dongle or the smartphone's Mobile Hotspot functionality and likely, a tethering or data option enabled.
2012-11-01T10:33:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	you'll likely have to use one or the other.
2012-11-01T10:34:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	Under my impression, Mobile Hotspot works with up to five devices. Bluetooth, only one.
2012-11-01T10:35:00.000Z	aln	rootbrian	Thanks a lot  for your help
2012-11-01T10:45:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	sorry if I got lost/got you lost. Just plugging the computer into the modem-router via the ethernet cable will work fine.
2012-11-01T11:11:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	if it's a wireless modem router, why don't you connect via wifi instead and let DHCP take care of it all?
2012-11-01T11:12:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	Press and hold the reset button until it reboots, release. this will reset it to the defaults, then enter the PPPoE information your internet service provider gave you, then apply the settings. Next, connect to it via wifi. That's all you need to do.
2012-11-01T11:12:00.000Z	aln	rootbrian	With my desktop computer?
2012-11-01T11:14:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	connect the desktop computer's Ethernet cable to either port numbered 1, 2, 3 or 4.
2012-11-01T11:15:00.000Z	rootbrian	aln	also, before you do that, reset anything you changed via Edit Connections, or where you made the changes.
2012-11-01T11:16:00.000Z	aln	rootbrian	Thanks a lot for your attention and for your help.
