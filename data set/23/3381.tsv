2008-05-02T14:17:00.000Z	Carbonflux		anyway, this problem is hypersimple
2008-05-02T14:17:00.000Z	Carbonflux		and someone here knows the answer
2008-05-02T14:17:00.000Z	Carbonflux		but I am giving up because I can't explain it
2008-05-02T14:17:00.000Z	Carbonflux		:)
2008-05-02T14:19:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	check the netmasks... sure they are all 255.255.255.0
2008-05-02T14:20:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	it is a netmask! not an ip address
2008-05-02T14:22:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	whatev! I was assuming you had a simple basic network. Using two routers gets you into routing troubles (hence routers)
2008-05-02T14:23:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	yes it is... anyway. draw a diagram somewhere and post it, so you have something to talk by
2008-05-02T14:23:00.000Z	Carbonflux	j0be	thanks for thinking about it, I don't want to waste your time :)
2008-05-02T14:23:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	I bet the windows machine is on the same side as your website and your linux behind the 2nd router.
2008-05-02T14:23:00.000Z	Carbonflux	j0be	no
2008-05-02T14:24:00.000Z	Carbonflux	j0be	if I change the gateway of the linux machine to the 1.1 addy I can get at uit
2008-05-02T14:25:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	which linux machine? the one you are trying to connect to your website? what is the default gateway then, where does that lead to, where is the website.
2008-05-02T14:26:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	what is the IP of the website?
2008-05-02T14:26:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	 can 192.168.0.1 see this website
2008-05-02T14:27:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	 can 192.168.0.1 see this website, and what is it IP address
2008-05-02T14:28:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	focus please! it is not IM
2008-05-02T14:28:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	 can 192.168.0.1 see this website, and what is it IP address
2008-05-02T14:29:00.000Z	Carbonflux	j0be	that is the addy of router one, I can get to its website
2008-05-02T14:29:00.000Z	Carbonflux	j0be	1.1 is the other router, if I use that for a gateway I can get at its site
2008-05-02T14:29:00.000Z	Carbonflux	j0be	but it will not route between 0.1 and 1.1 and only on this one linux box
2008-05-02T14:31:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	or trace via a ping with # ping -R ip.addr.of.box
2008-05-02T15:19:00.000Z	j0be	Carbonflux	still there? i saw a /16 coming by, you are messed up with your netmasks
