2008-10-27T01:31:00.000Z	ikonia	[[thufir]]	depends on your model, check teh hardware guide
2008-10-27T01:35:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	ikonia	you mean the manual which came with the CPU for temp parameters, to see if the temp is excessive?
2008-10-27T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	[[thufir]]	correct
2008-10-27T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	[[thufir]]	it's normally on the web
