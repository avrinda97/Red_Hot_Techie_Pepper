2005-12-24T17:24:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	k thx
2005-12-24T17:27:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	does kubuntu uses sudo system too?
2005-12-24T17:28:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	I take it you don't like sudo?
2005-12-24T17:29:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	I'd give it a try, you'll get used to it... if you end up preferring root you can always enable it, it's your choise.  But try getting used to sudo for a week or so.
2005-12-27T06:29:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	there's a list in man bash
2005-12-27T06:29:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	oh k thx
2005-12-27T06:31:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	line 2300 lol
2005-12-27T06:32:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	can you tell me how to jump to specific line?
2005-12-27T06:32:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	use bimberi's method: /prompting <searches for prompting... then press 'n'
2005-12-27T07:15:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	are you getting that many crashes that you need a shortcut key? :P
2005-12-27T07:16:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	just wondering, thx
2005-12-27T07:31:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	what are you doing?
2005-12-27T07:32:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	want to figure out why i can't do gedit as a root
2005-12-27T07:32:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	are you actually logged in as root or just using sudo?  and 'gedit' should work
2005-12-27T07:32:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	someone said something abt losing x vars or something
2005-12-27T07:32:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	sudo -i
2005-12-27T07:33:00.000Z	_jason	toya_	just use sudo -s
2005-12-27T07:34:00.000Z	toya_	_jason	hmm ok i'll read man sudo
