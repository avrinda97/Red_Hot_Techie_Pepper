2010-02-15T14:46:00.000Z	KamaL		hi all.. I have ubunut server 9.04 on a VPS, I installed the desktop pack on it, but now when I type STARTX I get this error log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/376753/
2010-02-15T14:48:00.000Z	KamaL		can i have a remote desktop on a ubuntu server VPS??? is it possible?
2010-02-15T14:48:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	I think the VPS machine has no screen to let run X on it. Try vncserver instead
2010-02-15T14:49:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	i tried it
2010-02-15T14:49:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	(I do that a lot here with Ubuntu machines running oin Xen)
2010-02-15T14:55:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	To verify that the server is listening on the vnc port (5901, 5902, 5903 in your case) you can check `netstat -tlpen  |grep 5901` on the server. Maybe there'S a firewall blocking that packets. I would recommend using `vncviewer 127.0.0.1:1 -via <server>`.
2010-02-15T14:58:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	Oh, you're connecting from a windows client. I don't know whether it supports the "-via" option but you can establish an ssh tunnel manually using putty for example
2010-02-15T14:58:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5901            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          1297554     9548/Xvnc
2010-02-15T14:59:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	what does that output mean?
2010-02-15T15:01:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	It means the server is listening on that port but maybe some packet filter _between_ you and the server is blocking it. I'd strongly recommend using an encrypted ssh tunnel in the case you have not full control over the network.
2010-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	how do i do that?
2010-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	You already use putty to connect to the VPS?
2010-02-15T15:05:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	Open connection settings, look for ssh tunnel, define a local listening port (like 12345 or 5901 too) and a remote endpoint (127.0.0.1:5901). Then open vncviewer and connect to ":1".
2010-02-15T15:06:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	local listening port=source port, and remote endpoint=destination ?
2010-02-15T15:09:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	choose a local listening port and connect to that later. Remote endpoint (the server) should be 127.0.0.1 on port 5901.
2010-02-15T15:10:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	- i chose 5901 as local listening, and remote point as u said
2010-02-15T15:11:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	When your local listening port is 5901 connect to 127.0.0.1:1 or just :1 on newer vncviewers
2010-02-15T15:12:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	In case you can't occupy the 590* ports locally choose something like 12345 and connect to 127.0.0.1::12345 (double colon)
2010-02-15T15:12:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	So there's at least a connection ;-)
2010-02-15T15:13:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	source port and local port 12345?
2010-02-15T15:14:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	12345 is just an example. Port 5901 seems to be available on your local machine so keep using it
2010-02-15T15:23:00.000Z	KamaL	vlt	same error msg. closed unexpectedly
2010-02-15T15:25:00.000Z	vlt	KamaL	Tried another vncviewer?
