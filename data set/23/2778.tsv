2008-12-12T01:28:00.000Z	clooluss		Hi. I have an upgrade problem: "Not all updates can be installed" - it tells me to do a partial upgrade, but if i do that it tells me "not all packages could be authenticated" The list of software it mentions seems to be mainly OOo. I have the OOo repository in my software sources. Intrepid 64bit.
2008-12-12T01:29:00.000Z	clooluss		Ooops... fell offline. Did I missanything?
2008-12-12T01:30:00.000Z	clooluss		=-)
2008-12-12T01:32:00.000Z	clooluss		fang: Has there been a new kernel release lately? This was a frsh-from-cd install of ibex, not an upgrade from Hardy.
2008-12-12T01:32:00.000Z	clooluss		fang: OK, how do I fix it?
2008-12-12T01:33:00.000Z	clooluss		Fang: I try to, but it doesn't work. I says that packages can't be authenticated, and then lists a bunch of OOo stuff.
2008-12-12T01:33:00.000Z	clooluss		I run OOo 3.0 from the OOo repository, not 2.X from the standard repo.
2008-12-12T01:34:00.000Z	Pici	clooluss	Are you referring to the OOo PPA?
2008-12-12T01:35:00.000Z	clooluss		Fang: No. "It was not possible to authenticate some packages. This may be a transient network problem... try aagin later... see below for list of unauthed packages." I ddon't think it is a transient network problem. Or if it is a netowrk problem, it isn't a transient one - this has been going on since tuesday or wednesday.
2008-12-12T01:36:00.000Z	clooluss	Pici	Yeah, pp.launchpad...openoffice...intrepid. something like that
2008-12-12T01:37:00.000Z	Pici	clooluss	PPAs do not currently offer the ability to be signed.  So you *will* get an error regarding unauthenticated updates.
2008-12-12T01:38:00.000Z	clooluss		fang:Reading package lists... Done
2008-12-12T01:38:00.000Z	clooluss		Building dependency tree
2008-12-12T01:38:00.000Z	clooluss		Reading state information... Done
2008-12-12T01:38:00.000Z	clooluss		The following packages have been kept back:
2008-12-12T01:38:00.000Z	clooluss		  openoffice.org-base-core openoffice.org-calc openoffice.org-core
2008-12-12T01:38:00.000Z	clooluss		  openoffice.org-writer python-uno
2008-12-12T01:39:00.000Z	clooluss		pici: wil this affect other updates that come through synaptec?
2008-12-12T01:39:00.000Z	Pici	clooluss	No.
2008-12-12T01:40:00.000Z	Pici	clooluss	Launchpad will be offering signed PPAs in the next week or so.  So you won't have to put up with this for much longer.
2008-12-12T01:41:00.000Z	clooluss		pici: That's good news, thanks. I'll wait it out. Thanks to Fang too.
2008-12-12T01:42:00.000Z	clooluss		pici: One last question: Will I have to do anything when these signed thingies come in? Or will it all "just work"
2008-12-12T01:43:00.000Z	Pici	clooluss	You'll probably be prompted with a different error.  I'm not sure how it would be worded though.
