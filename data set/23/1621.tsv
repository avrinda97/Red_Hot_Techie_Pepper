2010-01-09T18:40:00.000Z	Xfact		anybody knows about game 'alien arena'?
2010-01-09T18:40:00.000Z	Xfact		It installed in my karmic but not running...
2010-01-09T18:40:00.000Z	Xfact		it's need any supported file?
2010-01-09T18:41:00.000Z	Xfact		I have a game 'alien arena' which is installed but not running in my karmic, it's need any supported files like java or something?
2010-01-09T18:42:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	"not running" is not a very precise description of the error ;-)
2010-01-09T18:43:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	start it from the commandline and see the output
2010-01-09T18:43:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	you installed via apt/synaptic?
2010-01-09T18:44:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	basically i meant "try to run it in the console"
2010-01-09T18:44:00.000Z	Xfact	nibbler	no I installed it through 'software center' and how to run it on console? (drug and drop)
2010-01-09T18:45:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	open commandline and type in the name.... try to find the name of the executable with tab, should not be to hard
2010-01-09T18:46:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	/var/lib/dpkg/info/ there is packagename.list - look for the executable ther (in /usr/bin most likely)
2010-01-09T18:48:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	you have proprietary 3d drivers installed? check if there are commandlineoptions like -v --verbose or whatever
2010-01-09T18:50:00.000Z	Xfact	nibbler	I think it's having problem on it's sound section cause it showing------- sound initialization -------
2010-01-09T18:50:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	ah, you cannot boot the ubuntu installer cd?
2010-01-09T18:52:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	sorry, mixed up some nicknames ;-)
2010-01-09T18:53:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	ah ok, well... seems so, one way to debug is to run "strace -eopen " as prefix to the command, so you can see if there is a file/permission problem, but this goes a bit too far for supporting via chat
2010-01-09T18:55:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	it actually seems to be a sound probem then, even thou this is no more than a guess
2010-01-09T18:55:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	i dont use karmic, went back to 904 ;-)
2010-01-09T18:56:00.000Z	Xfact	nibbler	my window sound is working fine...with nice quality!
2010-01-09T18:56:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	sorry no clue then, maybe check if you see a bug in the config files, if there is a save-mode or whatever (commandline --help etc)
2010-01-09T18:57:00.000Z	Xfact	nibbler	 well, jaunty and karmic almost same, just the appearance and theme little different....but one thing you can say karmic is UNSTABLE!
2010-01-09T18:57:00.000Z	Xfact	nibbler	it's ok thanks for your try :)
2010-01-09T18:57:00.000Z	nibbler	Xfact	welcome, sorry for notbeing too helpfull
