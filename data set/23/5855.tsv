2006-08-20T16:06:00.000Z	jdskate98		you tried shit distros
2006-08-20T16:07:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	what was your problem again? Arguing with others or fixing a dependency problem?
2006-08-20T16:07:00.000Z	jdskate98	t-thing_	deps
2006-08-20T16:08:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	so, what is the package you trying to install?
2006-08-20T16:09:00.000Z	jdskate98	t-thing_	give me a minute, sorry
2006-08-20T16:11:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	it is xgl problem. It's installation screw it up by uninstalling ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-20T16:11:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	and for some brilliant reason you accept it
2006-08-20T16:11:00.000Z	jdskate98	t-thing_	i'm actually pretty sure it's not Xgl
2006-08-20T16:12:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	when was the last time you did apt-get update?
2006-08-20T16:13:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	but like everybody else has said, it's probably a broken xgl package which is a problem that should be taken to #ubuntu-xgl
2006-08-20T16:13:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	uninstall the xgl / install ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-20T16:14:00.000Z	jdskate98	t-thing_	lmao
2006-08-20T16:14:00.000Z	t-thing_	jdskate98	you have a weird sense of humor
2006-08-20T16:15:00.000Z	jdskate98	t-thing_	thank you
