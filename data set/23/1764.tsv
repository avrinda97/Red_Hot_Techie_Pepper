2010-02-24T11:17:00.000Z	heater_		if someone has moment I have a question regarding NTFS partition and setting permissions on certain directories
2010-02-24T11:18:00.000Z	heater_		ok...how do i specify a certain directory on an NTFS partition in the fstab file that has different permissions than the  rest of the parition?
2010-02-24T11:18:00.000Z	heater_		partition**
2010-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	heater_		Zykotick9, the reason i ran into this issue is i formatted by hard drive NTFS for a data drive...this way in case the computer for some reason goes down or I decide to remove the drive i can still access the data
2010-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	heater_		Zykotick9, now i cannot chmod or chown on the directory because it is NTFS, so is there any way to specify a certain directory to hae different permissions than the rest of the drive?
2010-02-24T11:22:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	to the best of my knowledge NTFS doesnt hold file permissions, best way to check is to go in a terminal type in "Sudo Nautilus" go to your file right click, property, then try to change the permissions
2010-02-24T11:23:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	Why would you be using NTFS?
2010-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	heater_	brando753	i am using NTFS just in case i decided to move the hard drive to a Windows box, and the last time i tried windows didn't do too well ext3
2010-02-24T11:25:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	just realize NTFS and Linux do not blend well, NTFS fragments and corrupts easily and linux wont be able to fix it :(
2010-02-24T11:26:00.000Z	heater_	brando753	oh....well i was unaware, so how would i go about, without fat32, having a drive easily swapped between windows and ubuntu?
2010-02-24T11:26:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	if you are using the same windows box then I would recomend ext2 as there are programs that let windows see it one sec...

2010-02-24T11:27:00.000Z	heater_	brando753	ahhh alright, well brando you just made me have to buy an 2tb external drive.....thanks ;) lol
2010-02-24T11:28:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	usally it wont
2010-02-24T11:29:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	stick with ext2 and you might be fine
2010-02-24T11:29:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	ext3 drivers are very flaky last time i used them
2010-02-24T11:29:00.000Z	heater_	brando753	here is my question then, what is the real advantage between ext2 and 3?
2010-02-24T11:29:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	1 sec
2010-02-24T11:30:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	yup thats the big diffrence not that bad
2010-02-24T11:31:00.000Z	heater_	brando753	ahhhh alright thanks, well shoot, i was trying to solve a problem and thought i was being creative but ended up just creating a bigger problem lol
2010-02-24T11:31:00.000Z	brando753	heater_	well whats the bigger problem?
2010-02-24T11:32:00.000Z	heater_	brando753	permissions is the bigger problem
2010-02-24T11:33:00.000Z	heater_	brando753	used to have OS and data on same drive....then separated them using NTFS for data
