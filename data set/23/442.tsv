2011-09-06T16:28:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb		sometimes, about 1-2 times a day, my system (mint 11) just freezes for no apparent reason, leaving me only to reset the damn thing - what could cause that?
2011-09-06T16:28:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	mint is not supported here
2012-01-13T15:44:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	have you checked if your history file is actually locked?  fuser -v $(find ~/.mozilla -name places.sqlite)
2012-01-13T15:53:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	oCean	where is it in a portable firefox?
2012-01-13T15:53:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	no idea, why would you use portable?
2012-01-13T15:54:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	oCean	i.e. to be able to use it on a different computer
2012-01-13T15:54:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	you're not using ubuntu? and the firefox from the ubuntu repositories?
2012-01-13T15:55:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	oCean	i am running ubuntu and use the firefox from the repositories, i installed it portable
2012-01-13T15:56:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	I'm not sure what you mean, but generally all the configs/settings/history is in your homedirectory under .mozilla
2012-01-13T15:59:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	when you run  locate mozilla | grep bookmark  what does it return?
2012-01-13T16:00:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	no, that's not the one, you need the files from your .mozilla directory
2012-01-13T16:00:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	try  locate .mozilla
2012-01-13T16:01:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	oCean	the only others are png files in the installed folder. icons.
2012-01-13T16:01:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	you still have to find where your settings etc are stored, try  locate .mozilla
2012-01-13T16:02:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	oCean	nothing, you mean the profile folder?
2012-01-13T16:02:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	yes
2012-01-13T16:02:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	I mean, the profile folder is somewhere under .mozilla too (in a normal install)
2012-01-13T16:02:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	so, what is the program dir? - you have to see if the places.sqlite and bookmarks file etc are there
2012-01-13T16:03:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	I never used FF in a portable install, so I'm just trying to get an idea
2012-01-13T16:03:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	oCean	the places.sqlite is there
2012-01-13T16:04:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	ok, run  fuser -v /path/to/places.sqlite
2012-01-13T16:04:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	that should show if another program is locking that file
2012-01-13T16:06:00.000Z	oCean	bbbbbbbb	I have no clue how this portable install is configured, sorry.
