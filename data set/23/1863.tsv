2009-09-28T06:57:00.000Z	Mooch_		is there any way to use the live CD to fix an install of 8.04?  power supply failed, replaced it, thei it booted into Nautilus w/ no tool bars and a COBRA error
2009-09-28T06:57:00.000Z	Mooch_		I am using the live cd now
2009-09-28T06:58:00.000Z	RHorse	Mooch_	sounds like just the .gnome settings might be in issue
2009-09-28T06:59:00.000Z	Mooch_	RHorse	how do I fix it?
2009-09-28T07:00:00.000Z	RHorse	Mooch_	Removing the contents of ~/.gnome, ~/.gnome2, ~/.nautilus, ~/.gconf should remove most of the settings and put you back to a default setup
2009-09-28T07:02:00.000Z	Mooch_	RHorse	how do I find that using the live CD ?
2009-09-28T07:03:00.000Z	RHorse	Mooch_	are you using the live CD to recover a hard drive install?
2009-09-28T07:03:00.000Z	Mooch_	RHorse	I am in the live CD now,
2009-09-28T07:05:00.000Z	Mooch_	RHorse	the problem is the installed version on the hard drive, been running it for about a year
2009-09-28T07:06:00.000Z	Mooch_	RHorse	I am using the live cd to get here
2009-09-28T07:07:00.000Z	RHorse	Mooch_	you have to mount the partition that your install is on if it isn't already.
2009-09-28T07:09:00.000Z	Mooch_	RHorse	it is not, can  send me the command

2009-09-28T07:25:00.000Z	Mooch_	RHorse	is it because the directory is locked?
2009-09-28T07:26:00.000Z	RHorse	Mooch_	can you boot into a recovery console on your bad install?
