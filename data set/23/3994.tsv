2008-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	Phoenix87		bump
2008-12-28T15:28:00.000Z	Phoenix87		anyone can help me with my usb joypad problem?
2008-12-28T15:29:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	What's the problem?
2008-12-28T15:29:00.000Z	Phoenix87	soreau	i used jscalibrator on it
2008-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	That's not a problem
2008-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	Phoenix87	soreau	unfortunately it is 'cause axes stopped working
2008-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	Even after a reboot?
2008-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	Phoenix87		yep
2008-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	Phoenix87		i unplugged the controller
2008-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	Try 'jstest'
2008-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	Phoenix87		i even completely removed jscalibrator
2008-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	Phoenix87	soreau	jstest works fine
2008-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	So what's wrong exactly?
2008-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	Phoenix87		even jscal seems to work fine
2008-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	Phoenix87	soreau	when in a game, supertux say, axes don't work
2008-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	Phoenix87		only buttons work
2008-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	If the axes work in jstest, it is a matter of setting said game to use the axes accordingly
2008-12-28T15:33:00.000Z	Phoenix87	soreau	searching on the internet this seems to be a common problem for those who used jscalibrator, but the common solution isn't the solution for me :(
2008-12-28T15:34:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	Then file a bug or look up a bug report for jscalibrator
2008-12-28T15:34:00.000Z	Phoenix87		in addition axes used to work fine in supertux prior to jscalibrator
2008-12-28T15:34:00.000Z	Phoenix87	soreau	I did that but the suggested solution doesn't work for me :(
2008-12-28T15:35:00.000Z	soreau	Phoenix87	Well I doubt I have used the exact hardware and configuration you have so I don't have an answer for your specific situation
2008-12-28T15:36:00.000Z	Phoenix87	soreau	don't worry ;) I appreciate your help!
