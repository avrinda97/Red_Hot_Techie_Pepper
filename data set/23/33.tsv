2012-11-06T22:46:00.000Z	lizardbrain		trying to add teamviewer7 to startup nothing works
2012-11-06T22:46:00.000Z	lizardbrain		it needs to run as root
2012-11-06T22:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	it shouldn't need to run as root...
2012-11-06T22:48:00.000Z	lizardbrain	gordonjcp	it does
2012-11-06T22:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-team-viewer-version-7-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin.html
2012-11-06T22:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	^ that doesn't look like it needs to be run as root
2012-11-06T22:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	it probably depends on what it's actually failing on, then
2012-11-06T22:50:00.000Z	lizardbrain	gordonjcp	read comments on page you linked
2012-11-06T22:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	you could use strace to see where it actually gets the permission denied error, and see if you can tweak its permissions
2012-11-06T22:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	I have neither the time nor inclination
2012-11-06T22:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	I don't use teamviewer and I don't really see the point of it
2012-11-06T22:51:00.000Z	lizardbrain	gordonjcp	do you know of something better?
2012-11-06T22:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	for what?
2012-11-06T22:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	I mean, what exactly are you trying to solve?
2012-11-06T22:52:00.000Z	lizardbrain	gordonjcp	trying to remote desktop a machine behind a firewall
2012-11-06T22:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	if it's getting permission denied errors, there will be a specific resource it cannot get at
2012-11-06T22:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	run it with strace and see where it fails.  This will be pretty scary and technical.
2012-11-06T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	it depends what you're trying to do
2012-11-06T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	you could try tunneling X over SSH
2012-11-06T22:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	in any case, if you're trying to use GUI apps remotely, chances are you're Doing It Wrong
2012-11-06T22:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	what *exactly* is the problem you're trying to solve with this?
2012-11-06T22:59:00.000Z	lizardbrain	gordonjcp	using vmware workstation remotely
2012-11-06T23:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lizardbrain	well, you'll either have to spend money or leave the machine logged in
