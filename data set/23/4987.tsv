2008-01-03T08:40:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	thahx ... I think I have tried that one, but I will look again.  foug it may not be precisely what you want, but you might like it.  It's an easy tag editor that is intelligently written.  Sudo aptitude install exfalso
2008-01-03T08:44:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	Okay, that's the help page I already tried.  The auto script gives me no help (screen comes back "out of range").  I tried the second method (horiz rate, etc), and no errors, but no change in resolution.
2008-01-03T08:44:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	You can try to edit xorg manually...just make sure to back it up
2008-01-03T08:45:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	yeah, that's what I did with the horiz rates and stuff (I've done this before, a long time ago).
2008-01-03T08:48:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	thanx for the help.  I will continue mucking about and see what I can do.
2008-01-03T08:48:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	Editing it manually is the best I can think of....maybe just me
2008-01-03T08:48:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	yeah, me too.  I'll see if maybe I forgot something simple.  tis usually the way it is :D
2008-01-03T08:51:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	hey, is there a way to force xorg to default to a specific *higher* resolution?
2008-01-03T08:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	I don't know about default, but I know that you can add rez and then go into system and change to them
2008-01-03T08:52:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	so is it the best way to just add a resolution to xorg.conf, restart xorg, then try to select the res?  Or is there a better way?
2008-01-03T08:53:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	I don't know if that's the best, that's just what I'd do...but like I said, make sure to back up xorg
2008-01-03T08:53:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	heheh yeah I know.  But it never hurts to beat that one to death.  *always back up your xorg.conf*  <--- for everyone elses benefit ;)
2008-01-03T08:54:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	The few of us idiots who made that mistake once...;)
2008-01-03T08:54:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	I was one of those ... like 3 years ago ;)
2008-01-03T08:56:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	kay I am gonna restart xorg. wish me luck :D
2008-01-03T09:06:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	strangely, xorg accepts 1440x900, but will not take 1680x1050 (the native res).  Any thoughts?
2008-01-03T09:06:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	As in, it won't show up as a choice?
2008-01-03T09:06:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	in fact, 1680x1050 won't even show up in the menu either.  I don't understand why.  PurpZeYcorrect.
2008-01-03T09:06:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	My math is rather fuzzy, is that the correct aspect ratio?
2008-01-03T09:07:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	Sounds like Jack_Sparrow is on to something
2008-01-03T09:08:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	PurpZeY	is the command something like metacity -replace for that?
2008-01-03T09:08:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Em3raldMcSquizzy	Methinks so, yes.
