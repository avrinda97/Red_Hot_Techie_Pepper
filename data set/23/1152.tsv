2010-07-30T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 if you select NONE - then it works fine?
2010-07-30T21:40:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	Not sure how to select 'none', sorry
2010-07-30T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 right where you change the Compiz/effectsd settings.. it has   desktop right click -> change wallpaper -> last tab
2010-07-30T21:42:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	Are you talking in Windows? Or Ubuntu?
2010-07-30T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 Windows resizer feature works for me very well. however you really should defrag the drive in windows, bwefor useing the windows resize feature.
2010-07-30T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 you shoudl be able to. but ive found the windows manager tool to be often 4x as fast as gparted.. but that was about a year+ ago i last 'tested' it.
2010-07-30T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 you shoudl be able to. but ive found the windows manager tool to be often 4x as fast as gparted.. but that was about a year+ ago i last 'tested' it.
2010-07-30T21:57:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	Alright, but the benefit for me is that gParted might actually be able to work, as it doesn't need the disk to be defragged to 0%
2010-07-30T21:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 actually the goparted docs DO suggest defragging beforhand..
2010-07-30T21:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 is there some reason defraggng is such a hassle?
2010-07-30T21:58:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	Just that it never seems to take it to 0%. I've never been able to fully defrag my drive :/
2010-07-30T21:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 it proberly dosent have to be at 0% - but the wiondows tool shouild be able to resize.
2010-07-30T22:00:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	At the moment it's at 12%, and not working :/
2010-07-30T22:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	  I alwauys use this defragger tool from  the portableapps.com web site.
2010-07-30T22:00:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	I'm using Defraggler
2010-07-30T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 what correct softweare? You can try a live cd if you want. but none of them come with the nvidia drivers.
2010-07-30T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 or install to a flash drive to let you fully install the restricted drivers and so forth to test it out
2010-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	I'm trying to partition the drive, though o_O
2010-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 i use the various live cd's to reparittion windows all the time. gparted also has its own 'gparted live cd' and other variants
2010-07-30T22:14:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	So i need that one, right? Not the generic Ubuntu desktop install liveCD?
2010-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 the ubuntu live cd.. can work fine. You may need to install gparted.. but the installer should also be able to resize
2010-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Underscore	 in mot sure what your 'original' problems are that you are having so many issues...
2010-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	Underscore	Dr_Willis	Ok, I'll just give it a shot. Basically windows isn't letting me shrink the drive, and I can't defrag it down to 0%. So I needed another way to shrink/partition.
