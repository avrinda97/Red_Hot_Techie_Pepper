2009-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	Tyrath		i have to admit it would be great if the next version of ubuntu doesn't ensure that every new installed program has to be tweaked to get it to work
2009-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	Tyrath		i seem to have to tweak every program i install
2009-01-09T16:46:00.000Z	Tyrath		and i still can't get hibernate to work - that's the shell app
2009-01-09T16:46:00.000Z	Gnea	Tyrath	like what? what programs do you have to tweak, and for what?
2009-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	i've used the wrong word when I say tweak. I usually have to fiddle with screen dimensions, comp settings, etc. to get things to work
2009-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	Gnea	Tyrath	so have I, but that doesn't stop me
2009-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	it's not stopping me either
2009-01-09T16:48:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	I would love to be able to hibernate properly through shell tho
2009-01-09T16:48:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	the hibernate application doesn't hibernate properly
2009-01-09T16:48:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	which means if I want to hibernate/suspend i have to always do it through the GUI
2009-01-09T16:48:00.000Z	Gnea	Tyrath	so troubleshoot it, google it
2009-01-09T16:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	it's difficult without a log
2009-01-09T16:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	see, it powers down but i just doesn't power up afterward
2009-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	thanks but I have it installed and it works. I just need help adding extra components
2009-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	Gnea	Tyrath	aah... haven't used it, i usually use the little gnome applet
2009-01-16T07:17:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	well this one does have a GUI :)
2009-01-16T07:18:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	one thing to note though is that installing qtstalker any other way than adding it to the repositories in ibex will fail
2009-01-16T07:19:00.000Z	Gnea	Tyrath	dude, gnome is all about gui ;) but i'm game for anything that'll help
2009-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	if you want it add deb http://www.zwets.com/debs unstable/ to your /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-01-16T07:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Tyrath	sec, i'm installing the base from ibex to see how bad it is
2009-01-16T07:21:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	it will install it just won't get the quotes for you
2009-01-16T07:21:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	which defeats the purpose of having the program lol
2009-01-16T07:22:00.000Z	Tyrath	Gnea	I would personally like it a lot better if I could set it up the way I like butI don't know how to :/
