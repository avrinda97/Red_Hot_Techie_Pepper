2011-08-23T22:44:00.000Z	calwig		Hi, the mouse scroll section of the mouse pad isnt working. How can I check that this module is loaded?
2011-08-23T22:45:00.000Z	xrdodrx	calwig	I'm assuming you're not talking about the trackpad on your laptop?
2011-08-23T22:48:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	yeah
2011-08-23T22:48:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	Last week it was working now its now
2011-08-23T22:49:00.000Z	xrdodrx	calwig	have you updated your kernel in that time? rebooted your computer? is the module psmouse loaded? what does the output of `lsmod` look like?
2011-08-23T22:49:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	kernel update yeah, let me see..
2011-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	psmouse                40336  0
2011-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	I presume it must be loaded from somewhere
2011-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	xrdodrx	calwig	try doing sudo rmmod psmouse && sudo modprobe psmouse
2011-08-23T22:51:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	now wait.. the pad works, its just the scroll
2011-08-23T22:52:00.000Z	xrdodrx	calwig	i know, thought that might help ;)
2011-08-23T22:52:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	let me explain what happened...
2011-08-23T22:54:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	I run this OS on the fly and I thought I could load this on another computer. X however didnt load, and I presume xorg.conf got backed up or changed. Anyhow I gave up loading Ubuntu on that PC so I just went back to my laptop and X did not load. I had to manually get an xorg.conf backup file and restore it myself
2011-08-23T22:54:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	Once I got X to load up again, the scroll bar just didnt work.
2011-08-23T22:55:00.000Z	xrdodrx	calwig	mind putting your xorg.conf up on paste.ubuntu.com so I can take a look?
2011-08-23T22:57:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	yeth thir

2011-08-23T23:11:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	back
2011-08-23T23:17:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	I cant seem to understand why the mousepad works but not the scroll bar
2011-08-23T23:36:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	hi you there?
2011-08-24T00:23:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	were you able to figure anything out on the paste?
2011-08-24T05:25:00.000Z	calwig	xrdodrx	You there
2011-08-24T05:50:00.000Z	xrdodrx	calwig	you there?
