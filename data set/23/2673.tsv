2008-12-20T02:03:00.000Z	Talendel		I have Ubuntu 8.10 installed, with the educational add-ons included, but I need to remove access to certain features of the OS.  I'm putting this together for a friend's kids, and he wants them to have all the edu stuff, but doesn't want them to be able to go on the 'net, and I want to make sure that their account is restricted.  Not familiar with how to do that as I'm more of a RH/SLAX user, so Deb is new to me.
2008-12-20T02:05:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	for package management, synaptic is your friend.
2008-12-20T02:06:00.000Z	Talendel	Neaai	Been using synaptic.  I've got the packages installed, and removed, accordingly.
2008-12-20T02:06:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	for network related things, I use /etc/network/interfaces
2008-12-20T02:06:00.000Z	Talendel	Neaai	I just want to make sure that, after I turn it over to them, the *kids* can't mess around with any of that.  I need to know how to limit their accounts from even being able to *see* this other items.
2008-12-20T02:07:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	well, the usual *nix tools come handy the same way. chown, chmod, iptables, etc.
2008-12-20T02:07:00.000Z	Talendel	Neaai	I'll check /interfaces, and see what I can do in there.  Thank you for that.
2008-12-20T02:08:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	tailoring systems, any system, is best done 'old school'. And those are all there in any flavor of linux.
2008-12-20T02:08:00.000Z	Talendel		Okay.  I just wasn't sure if there were different calls to be made, or if there was a different syntax.  Not really familiar with the Deb structure, and don't want to bork it.
2008-12-20T02:09:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	one you'll get to glance it, I'm sure you'll like it. More as time will go by :)
2008-12-20T02:09:00.000Z	Neaai		once*
2008-12-20T02:09:00.000Z	Talendel		What I was familiar with, in RH, was the 'Session Manager' option.  Let you configure what a user was allowed to even see, after login, along with everything else.
2008-12-20T02:09:00.000Z	Talendel		And, still, thank you for the advice and the info!
2008-12-20T02:09:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	see as in what sense ?
2008-12-20T02:10:00.000Z	Talendel		I really wasn't sure what I was getting into with this, but I had been told that Ubuntu was the easiest for people to get into, so I figured I'd give it a shot, for his kids.
2008-12-20T02:11:00.000Z	Talendel	Neaai	As in, what programs even appeared in the menu/on the desktop/in the panels, what they were allowed to access, what commands they had access to and didn't, and whether or not they could add or remove anything, and whether or not they could make changes to the panels, themselves.
2008-12-20T02:12:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	I'm not familiar with rhel. I'm sure there's something similar to this in ubuntu/debian but i haven't had the need to after all. You might ask for advice in #debian as well. I can tell you're not affraid you're not afraid to mess with the system so it's quite fine :)
2008-12-20T02:13:00.000Z	Talendel	Neaai	I've had my hands dirty in code, before.  Nothing new there, LoL!  My main concern is, since the structure is new to me, and I'm trying to have this ready and out the door so that he's got time to wrap it and all(holiday gift for the kids), I want to make sure I don't bork anything, and have to go and fix it before they really even get much use out of it.
2008-12-20T02:14:00.000Z	Talendel		And, I'll check out #debian.  They may very well have some suggestions or advice.
2008-12-20T02:15:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	yeap. And this also sums it up for me today. I'm off. Have a good day all.
2008-12-20T02:15:00.000Z	Talendel		Thanks for the help, Neaai!  Take care and be well!
2008-12-20T02:15:00.000Z	Talendel		Hopefully it's not snowing where you are, like it is out here.
2008-12-20T02:16:00.000Z	Neaai	Talendel	thanks. you too. No. it's raining a litle but it's 10deg.Cels. so it's very fine. I'm off. lol
