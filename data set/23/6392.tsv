2007-05-28T06:31:00.000Z	newen		so, mono or java are beter alternatives for me
2007-05-28T06:32:00.000Z	newen		python is slooow
2007-05-28T06:33:00.000Z	newen		it's easier to write slow phyton code
2007-05-28T06:33:00.000Z	newen		and it needs far more RAM
2007-05-28T06:33:00.000Z	newen		well, in C you have to be careful with pointers
2007-05-28T06:35:00.000Z	newen		python just gives fast development
2007-05-28T06:37:00.000Z	newen		yes, that's what I said, you have to be careful with pointers
2007-05-28T06:37:00.000Z	newen		but Glib and Gobject helps a lot
2007-05-28T06:37:00.000Z	newen		with memory management
2007-05-28T06:39:00.000Z	newen		what's faster, mono or python?
2007-05-28T06:40:00.000Z	LinuxHelp	newen	I think mono eh
2007-05-28T06:40:00.000Z	newen		and what's more RAM hungry?
2007-05-28T06:41:00.000Z	LinuxHelp	newen	mono is probably the most memory efficient out of: mono, java, python
2007-05-28T06:41:00.000Z	newen		I still think that gnome programs should be programmed in C, C++ or mono
2007-05-28T06:42:00.000Z	LinuxHelp		.net for linux
2007-05-28T06:42:00.000Z	newen		I dont like python!
2007-05-28T06:42:00.000Z	newen		It's like programming in javascript
2007-05-28T06:42:00.000Z	newen		:)
2007-05-28T06:43:00.000Z	newen		well, it's actually a script what you run
2007-05-28T06:44:00.000Z	newen		at least, python, but compiled to CIL and run by mono
2007-05-28T06:44:00.000Z	newen		efficiency
2007-05-28T06:45:00.000Z	newen	hajhouse	I don't know ocaml
2007-05-28T06:45:00.000Z	LinuxHelp	newen	look imo none of mono, java, python compile efficiently compared to C++ and pascal etc.
