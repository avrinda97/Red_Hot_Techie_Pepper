2010-11-13T04:59:00.000Z	jc0694		anybody know why when i try and telnet to my ubuntu machine it says "connection refused".  just installed ubuntu and haven't messed with any settings
2010-11-13T05:00:00.000Z	jc0694		oh... how do i get it to run?
2010-11-13T05:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	can you connect to localhost from the same pc?
2010-11-13T05:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	wy not use ssh?
2010-11-13T05:01:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	 i know... going to use that
2010-11-13T05:01:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	how do i connect to localhost?
2010-11-13T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	sit at the same pc you want to telnet to and connect to localhost rather than an IP address
2010-11-13T05:03:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	it says "connection refused" when i try and connect to my own ip
2010-11-13T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	then it's not running. I suggest you install openssh-server and use that instead. Its secure
2010-11-13T05:05:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	i can do that via synaptic?  what's the exact package name?
2010-11-13T05:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	openssh-server. or you can run: sudo apt-get install openssh-server   and get it faster
2010-11-13T05:06:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	i also see a package just called "ssh" shoul i install that too?
2010-11-13T05:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	thats a client and is already installed
2010-11-13T05:07:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	the box isn't green in synaptic so i don't think it's installed
2010-11-13T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	if you run the command I gave you will get the server
2010-11-13T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	screw synaptic, just run the command I gave
2010-11-13T05:12:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	when i set up ubuntu i don't think it ever prompted me for a root password?  is that possible?
2010-11-13T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	yes absolutely, there is no root pass. You use your OWN password in conjunction with sudo and gksudo to get elevated priveledges
2010-11-13T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	no, if you use: ssh servername    it will use your username, not root
2010-11-13T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	or if you want to connect as a different user, use:   ssh username@server
2010-11-13T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	if you are being asked to log in as root then your current user is root and thats not supported in ubuntu
2010-11-13T05:18:00.000Z	jc0694	ActionParsnip	that did it right... many thanks
2010-11-13T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jc0694	if you dont use root, you will have fewer issues
