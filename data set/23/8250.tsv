2004-12-02T14:41:00.000Z	stuNNed	Anima	is there a way to boot from livecd and chroot into your ubuntu install or do the same with ubuntu install cd?

2004-12-02T14:45:00.000Z	stuNNed	Anima	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/InstallFromKnoppixHowto and http://www.sysresccd.org/index.en.php come to mind.
2004-12-02T14:46:00.000Z	Anima		thanks stuNNed i will go read it
2004-12-02T14:47:00.000Z	stuNNed	Anima	np, the key is set up your chroot environment, then once done, chroot into it and run something like 'grub-install /dev/hda' or wherever your grub is installed.
2004-12-02T14:48:00.000Z	Anima		ok but what is chroot?
2004-12-02T14:48:00.000Z	stuNNed	Anima	(ch)ange (root) as in change your root dir to whatever you want :)
2004-12-02T14:48:00.000Z	stuNNed	Anima	root dir being /
2004-12-02T14:49:00.000Z	Anima		oh ok, so its like instead of using the root from the livecd we set it to the one on the hard disk?
2004-12-02T14:49:00.000Z	stuNNed		yes
2004-12-02T14:49:00.000Z	stuNNed		exactly :)
2004-12-02T14:49:00.000Z	Anima		oh ok
2004-12-02T14:50:00.000Z	stuNNed	Anima	it's also good for security purposes, limiting a daemon or something other to a restricted dir with given needed files
2004-12-02T14:51:00.000Z	Anima		er ok
2004-12-02T14:52:00.000Z	Anima	stuNNed	how do i chroot when i am in livecd?
2004-12-02T14:53:00.000Z	stuNNed	Anima	read that install from knoppix on the wiki, see if you can apply it to your ubuntu livecd, basically you mount things, set up proc, etc, then chroot in
