2006-11-05T09:21:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	 try videolan player
2006-11-05T09:21:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	have you downloaded codecs?
2006-11-05T09:22:00.000Z	probose	Ambimom	no, i just searched for "wmv" in synaptic manager but i dont found anything
2006-11-05T09:22:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	 install automatix; load codecs
2006-11-05T09:23:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	 or check the link to restricted formats from the website
2006-11-05T09:23:00.000Z	probose	Ambimom	i think i gonna download vlc
2006-11-05T09:23:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	vlc should work but you should also load codecs
2006-11-05T09:24:00.000Z	probose		what is automatix?
2006-11-05T09:24:00.000Z	probose		ambimom
2006-11-05T09:24:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	it is a great tool that loads the stuff you need that is not on ubuntu install
2006-11-05T09:25:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	 the codecs are proprietary which is why they don't come with cd
2006-11-05T09:25:00.000Z	Ambimom	probose	search ubuntu forum for automatix; there's a link
2006-11-05T09:25:00.000Z	probose	Ambimom	ok, thanks
