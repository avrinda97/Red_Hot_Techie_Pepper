2006-06-28T11:48:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	absolutely, what version of Ubuntu do you have?
2006-06-28T11:48:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	well, i haven't used dapper yet, though i'm pretty sure it's the same.
2006-06-28T11:48:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	crack open a terminal, please.
2006-06-28T11:49:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	now, type 'cd /etc/apt'
2006-06-28T11:49:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	and type 'ls'
2006-06-28T11:51:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	depending on your favorite editor.
2006-06-28T11:52:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	well, i recommend gedit if you want something graphical.
2006-06-28T11:53:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	could you type ctrl-x, please?
2006-06-28T11:53:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	and type 'gksudo gedit sources.list'?
2006-06-28T11:54:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	Ok, could you use pastebin and copy+paste that file into pastebin, so I can see what you have?
2006-06-28T11:57:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	ok, gedit's still open, right?
2006-06-28T11:57:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	ok lemme check your sources.list file.
2006-06-28T11:58:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	ok, this is easy.
2006-06-28T11:59:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	see those lines that have # (not ##) before them?
2006-06-28T11:59:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	just delete the # before the repositories you want to enable.
2006-06-28T12:00:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	when you're done, save the file and then run 'sudo apt-get update'
2006-06-28T12:00:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	and you're all done.
2006-06-28T12:01:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	right.
2006-06-28T12:01:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	# tells apt to ignore that line.
2006-06-28T12:01:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	No problem, and if it doesn't work (but I swear it will), I'll stick around in here.
2006-06-28T12:07:00.000Z	theblue	cydrive	well, that really depends.
