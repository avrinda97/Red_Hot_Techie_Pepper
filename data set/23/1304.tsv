2010-10-25T02:32:00.000Z	oly562	balr0g	are you saying you can not log ruby1.x?
2010-10-25T02:33:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	i can run it, it say The program 'ruby' is currently not installed.
2010-10-25T02:33:00.000Z	oly562	balr0g	what are you trying to do, curious now
2010-10-25T02:33:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	just trying to isntall ruby1.9.1
2010-10-25T02:37:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	http://pastie.org/1245758 lot of output on both commands, that is the dpkg output
2010-10-25T02:38:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	sb?
2010-10-25T02:38:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	yes it is, but why in the terminal it says The rybu program is not installed ??
2010-10-25T02:39:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	oh! i see
2010-10-25T02:39:00.000Z	oly562	balr0g	im not a ruby programmer, i do see its installed though per your pastebin, like i ask before, what are you trying to do... i believe ruby is like a glue
2010-10-25T02:40:00.000Z	oly562	balr0g	no clue why your getting that error, how are you using ruby is the logical question now....
2010-10-25T02:40:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	i need ruby to use RubyOnRails, Agile Web Development
2010-10-25T02:41:00.000Z	oly562	balr0g	i assume you need to point the AWD to point to the bin that it needs... i have never used that b4. but logically it appears your are not configured right. maybe the AWD site has input on how to point paths so forth, no clue. anyone?
2010-10-25T02:42:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	how to know the path for ruby and irb (the ruby interpreter), and how to know if that path is environment for the terminal, and how to add a path to the environment? or how to address this issue?
2010-10-25T02:42:00.000Z	oly562	balr0g	sorry your asking the wrong person... try another...
2010-10-25T02:43:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	ok, will keep seeking

2010-10-25T02:56:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	only left is a symlink to invoke the p≈ïogram
2010-10-25T02:58:00.000Z	balr0g	oly562	symlink is short for symbolic link
2010-10-25T02:59:00.000Z	oly562	balr0g	yes and linux is an operating system
