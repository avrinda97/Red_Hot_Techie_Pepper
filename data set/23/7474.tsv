2005-07-26T09:50:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	source /etc/bash_completion
2005-07-26T09:50:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	also look in /etc/bash_completion.d
2005-07-26T09:50:00.000Z	zwnj	zyga	what's the package name?
2005-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	bash
2005-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	it's right there, just not enabled by default
2005-07-26T09:52:00.000Z	zwnj	zyga	the version that's in bash is very simple.  i used to use fc3 and it has a complete support for cvs, scp, ssh, etc
2005-07-26T09:52:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	look in /etc/bash_completion.d
2005-07-26T09:52:00.000Z	zyga		and source /etc/bash_completion
2005-07-26T09:52:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	many packages include their own /etc/bash_completion.d/* stuff
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	if you want completion for cvs, install cvs
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	that's all
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	also, get apt-file
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zwnj		apt-file :-/
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	and do: apt-file update
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	apt-file search bash_completion | less
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zwnj	zyga	uhu, tnx
2005-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	n/p

2005-07-26T10:02:00.000Z	zwnj	zyga	"""cvs co <TAB><TAB>""" doesn't read CVS/Root and just works if i use the ENVVAR
2005-07-26T10:31:00.000Z	zyga	zwnj	hmm?
