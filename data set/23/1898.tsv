2010-08-11T18:00:00.000Z	alienkid10		I am booting off a USB HDD and when after the GRUB menu but before GDM All I get is a blank screen then the boot splash for a second then GDM. Pressing del or F1 or anything to see details doesn't work. Anyway to fix this?
2010-08-11T18:02:00.000Z	alienkid10		Tik: make a new wireless connection and make sure to click "connect automatically"
2010-08-11T18:02:00.000Z	alienkid10		Tik: I am doing it
2010-08-11T18:03:00.000Z	alienkid10		Anyone have any ideas why I can't see boot up? Maybe some moudule I need to add?
2010-08-11T18:04:00.000Z	trijntje	alienkid10	what do you want to see?
2010-08-11T18:04:00.000Z	alienkid10		ANYTHING during boot up
2010-08-11T18:04:00.000Z	alienkid10		the splash screen or the detailed text
2010-08-11T18:05:00.000Z	alienkid10		I select kernel then blank untill right before
2010-08-11T18:05:00.000Z	alienkid10		GDM
2010-08-11T18:05:00.000Z	trijntje	alienkid10	put "verbose" for text and "quiet, splash" for the picture
2010-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	alienkid10	trijntje	quiet splash is alreeady there
2010-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	alienkid10		I tried verbose and same result
2010-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	trijntje	alienkid10	where did you put it?
2010-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	alienkid10		that's why I think it's a module
2010-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	alienkid10		after everything
2010-08-11T18:06:00.000Z	trijntje		in grub during boot?
2010-08-11T18:07:00.000Z	alienkid10		quiet splash was already there so I replaced ot with verbose
2010-08-11T18:07:00.000Z	alienkid10		it*
2010-08-11T18:08:00.000Z	trijntje	alienkid10	thats weird, in that case I dont know whats wrong, sorry
2010-08-11T18:08:00.000Z	alienkid10	trijntje	is there any USB module that may not be loaded during boot?
2010-08-11T18:10:00.000Z	trijntje	alienkid10	if you boot from usb I'd think all usb-stuf is loaded, but I know very little about that
2010-08-11T18:10:00.000Z	alienkid10	trijntje	anyway to check?
2010-08-11T18:12:00.000Z	trijntje	alienkid10	I think you should ask again here, and mention you are booting from usb
