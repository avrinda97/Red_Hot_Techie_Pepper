2011-07-11T00:48:00.000Z	Oraiz		Hi all. I have downloaded a cursor theme but I'm unsure how to install it, anyone able to help?
2011-07-11T00:49:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	  are you running unity or classic
2011-07-11T00:50:00.000Z	Oraiz		Classic, but I'm playing around with 'Macbuntu'. When I try to drag and drop to the theme window it says it isn't a valid theme.
2011-07-11T00:50:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	   ok open system /preference/appearance
2011-07-11T00:50:00.000Z	Oraiz		Yup
2011-07-11T00:50:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 when that opens  click the "Install" button  and locate the cursor tar.gz package
2011-07-11T00:51:00.000Z	Oraiz		Ok, sec.
2011-07-11T00:51:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	then when you want to use it,,, click the "Customize " button and locate the "pointer"  tab
2011-07-11T00:52:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 ir you are using compiz along with this , the cursor may not show up on all applications,, but th ere is  a simple command fix for that
2011-07-11T00:52:00.000Z	Oraiz		I am using compiz, yes. The theme I currently have only works when over some applications (Firefox, for example).
2011-07-11T00:53:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 right ,, that can be fixed
2011-07-11T00:53:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 I have to do this on each system. as well as distribution since I only use one certain cursor theme on every system
2011-07-11T00:53:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 so when you choose your theme remember that name of it,, and let me kn ow
2011-07-11T00:54:00.000Z	Oraiz		"Macbuntu-Cursors"
2011-07-11T00:54:00.000Z	Oraiz		Without the quotes, of course.
2011-07-11T00:55:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 ok open a terminal and paste this command in it,...     sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme  look for that theme name in the list and use the number it's attached to
2011-07-11T00:56:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 then next time you start up or restart x ,, that theme should be used on all appliations with or without compiz running
2011-07-11T00:57:00.000Z	Oraiz	coz_	the cursor theme isn't in that list. :\
2011-07-11T00:58:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	did it install properly?
2011-07-11T00:58:00.000Z	Oraiz		Well, I assume so, as it's working over some windows. It's available in the theme->pointer menu as wlel.
2011-07-11T00:59:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	 ok, you might have to restart x or reboot,, I have seen some themes not show up until a reboot
2011-07-11T00:59:00.000Z	Oraiz		Ok, I'll do that and try the same terminal command and report back if it doesn't work. Thanks!
2011-07-11T00:59:00.000Z	coz_	Oraiz	cool
