2010-04-28T09:20:00.000Z	polarsky		how did /etc/fstab get deleted?
2010-04-28T09:21:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	it didn't get deleted. apparently it can't be found but i checked and it's where it's supposed to be.
2010-04-28T09:22:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	one sec.
2010-04-28T09:23:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	there's no backup.
2010-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	i ran cp but there is no fstab.bak
2010-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	talking to me?
2010-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	polarsky	evilbug	use ur livedisc
2010-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	ok. apparently fstab is hosting the correct uuid for root.
2010-04-28T09:29:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	my fstab has the correct uuid but the system somehow can't see it.
2010-04-28T09:29:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	could it be an xserver issue?
2010-04-28T09:29:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	what happens is that i boot, select my kernel, boot splash comes on for a while, and then black screen instead of login.
2010-04-28T09:30:00.000Z	polarsky	evilbug	has that happened?
2010-04-28T09:30:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	yes. that's what my problem is. started today for no reason.
2010-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	no. i looked and the fstab is there. now i'll try copying the one from the livecd onto my hdd.
2010-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	my fstab displays everything correctly.
2010-04-28T09:33:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	that did the trick. thank you very very much.
2010-04-28T09:38:00.000Z	evilbug	polarsky	thanks again for your help.
