2007-08-07T10:03:00.000Z	Eleaf		uhm, no.
2007-08-07T10:03:00.000Z	Eleaf		That was a typo due to the tapping r00tintheb0x ...
2007-08-07T10:03:00.000Z	Eleaf		I'm wondering if therums has helpede is a way around it, since nothing from the forr
2007-08-07T10:03:00.000Z	Eleaf		grr tapping!!!
2007-08-07T10:04:00.000Z	Eleaf		Anybody know about athe syn
2007-08-07T10:04:00.000Z	Eleaf		anybody know about the synaptics problem?
2007-08-07T10:05:00.000Z	Eleaf		a very bad excuse.
2007-08-07T10:05:00.000Z	Eleaf		disable trackpad tapping r00tintheb0x
2007-08-07T10:06:00.000Z	Eleaf		yes, from dapper.
2007-08-07T10:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	Feisty straight from Dapper?
2007-08-07T10:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	That's not recommended, by the way.  Could (concievably) be part of your problem.  Which kernel are you running currently?
2007-08-07T10:07:00.000Z	Eleaf	Flannel	ethanlofton 2.6.20-16-powerpc #3
2007-08-07T10:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	Ah, right.  You lucked out with the PPC, no generic transition.
2007-08-07T10:14:00.000Z	Eleaf	Flannel	did you check the xorg.conf?
2007-08-07T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	I know nothing of X
2007-08-07T10:15:00.000Z	Eleaf	Flannel	I gave you a link
2007-08-07T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	right, I saw it.  I don't know anything with respect to X.
2007-08-07T10:15:00.000Z	Eleaf	Flannel	it's synaptics
2007-08-07T10:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	right, I have no GUI.  Thus no idea how X breaks and how to fix.
2008-06-28T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	Social is in #ubuntu-offtopic, not here, thanks.
2008-06-28T12:04:00.000Z	Eleaf	Flannel	It's been 1.5 years and I'm still banned from there
2008-06-28T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Eleaf	#ubuntu-ops, being banned from there is no excuse for bad manners here.
