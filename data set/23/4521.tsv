2007-07-23T09:18:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	what is the problem you have?
2007-07-23T09:19:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	on our servers, just recently sites started displaying apostrophes as black diamonds with question marks in them..
2007-07-23T09:19:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	nothing was changed, it just happened all of a sudden, and we don't know why.
2007-07-23T09:19:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	you can see an example of what it's doing here, http://www.mediathoroughbredgroup.com/blog/index.php/category/horse-racing-trivia/
2007-07-23T09:20:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	any errors in your logs? It sounds like an encoding issue, e.g. you're using the wrong ISO version
2007-07-23T09:20:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	we're using UTF-8, but what logs are you referring to? apache?
2007-07-23T09:21:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	yeah, but seeing it now, I don't think that will be in apapche logs - though ofc worth taking a look.
2007-07-23T09:21:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	it doesn't appear to be just apostrophes actually - unless you have random apostrophes.
2007-07-23T09:22:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	I think it's actually apostrophes and hyphens maybe?
2007-07-23T09:23:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	also, it appears to be jus tthat page - check out the source.
2007-07-23T09:24:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	the marker is in the SOURCE code of the page, hehee - someone has most likely edited the file in a dodgy editor :-)
2007-07-23T09:24:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	Yea I know the source code shows them that way, but that file when viewed locally (the file that was uploaded to the server) does not have those characters, the server views them that way, and the source code shows them that way
2007-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	and these files haven't been changed in months... and it's not only that site, it's more than one site on the server that all started showing things this way at once...
2007-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	hmm, where re you viewing the file locally? via a local apache install? What happens if you login to the server and edit them out?
2007-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	perhaps something has become corrupted?
2007-07-23T09:26:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	Yes, viewing the file locally (as i created it) does not have those characters.
2007-07-23T09:26:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	and that's my question what could've become corrupt or what could i change to get things back to they way they were
2007-07-23T09:27:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	hmm, you could try reuploading the original and seeing if that fixes it,  if it does it's likely just the file itself that's corrupt.
2007-07-23T09:31:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	Reuploading the file did not solve the issue
2007-07-23T09:32:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	I don't believe it has anything to do with the files themselves because a lot of different sites started doing this
2007-07-23T09:33:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	xanith	it might be worth having a chat in apache then, but something in that file is being interpreted as those chars - what are you writing your files in? nano/vim? or something more complex?
2007-07-23T09:33:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	some of them are coded in dreamweaver's code tab, some are in nano/vim...
2007-07-23T09:33:00.000Z	xanith	Lunar_Lamp	but all are having the same issues
