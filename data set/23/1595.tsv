2010-08-12T20:47:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	has the optical drive ever worked?  my DVD rom used to work, now it looks like it's dead :-(
2010-08-12T20:48:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	yes, on suse before installing kubuntu
2010-08-12T20:52:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	is ubuntu even picking up your optical drive: sudo lshw -C
2010-08-12T21:11:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	http://nopaste.info/94796b7440.html << they're both in there
2010-08-12T21:16:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	my mistake
2010-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	apparently it's: sudo lshw -C disk
2010-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	the command you used gave you everything including the information we need, the command i just gave you will give you specific information that we can use
2010-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	but the drives appear there
2010-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	are you trying to use a CD or DVD or what ??
2010-08-12T21:19:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	both don't work
2010-08-12T21:20:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	 check to see if you have a mount point for the cdrom under /media, you should have something like "/media/cdrom"
2010-08-12T21:22:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	then you mount the device to "/media/cdrom", which is why we wanted to know what device your hardware was using in the first place, the command is: sudo mount [DEVICE] /media/cdrom ---for [DEVICE] try putting the devices you got from the link you gave me, you already tried /dev/sr0
2010-08-12T21:37:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	all of them seem to point to /dev/sr0 and all fail :/
2010-08-12T21:38:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	what are you trying to use on your optical drive?  did you put a cdrom into the drive? try first a cd, like a music cd
2010-08-12T21:39:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	several media
2010-08-12T21:41:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	all these media work on other machines
2010-08-12T21:41:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	if you have a live CD or an install CD I would try it just to make sure it's not a hardware issue
2010-08-12T21:43:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	i used a dvd to install ubuntu just a few days ago. The hardware worked flawlessly on suse before that.
2010-08-12T21:43:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	its clearly an ubuntu-related problem
2010-08-12T21:44:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	 all hardware has a life span, they tend to RIP when you least expected, I would at least try that option just to make sure it's not a hardware issue, just boot up into the CD/DVD live, if you succeed then you know the problem is with ubuntu
2010-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	two drives?! the drives work. I made sure.
2010-08-12T21:45:00.000Z	tucemiux	riot	then it's an ubuntu issue, i would file a bug report or look up your hardware in launchpad
2010-08-12T21:46:00.000Z	riot	tucemiux	okay
