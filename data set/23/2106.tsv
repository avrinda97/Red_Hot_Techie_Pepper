2009-06-29T02:56:00.000Z	d0wn4r		ugh
2009-06-29T02:56:00.000Z	d0wn4r		i broke my x and i need to get to a command prompt, but after boot it freezes at the gdm login
2009-06-29T02:57:00.000Z	d0wn4r		ctrl-alt-f1 wont work, does anyone know another way?
2009-06-29T02:58:00.000Z	d0wn4r		just normal recovery which inits x and a memtest option
2009-06-29T02:59:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	do you have intel integrated graphics?
2009-06-29T03:00:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	yes intel
2009-06-29T03:00:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	I recall there are some issues with intel graphics freezing in 9.04 -- I had to edit the X.org configuration manually because the intel drivers cause the graphics hardware to do a hard lockup
2009-06-29T03:01:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	thats what i did.. its a hard lockup .. i did the -phigh ooption and thats where it borked
2009-06-29T03:01:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	You'll either need to manually set it to use VESA, or downgrade to 8.10
2009-06-29T03:02:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	how do i do that without getting to a console?
2009-06-29T03:03:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	you'll need to get to a console from the GRUB boot menu
2009-06-29T03:48:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	thank you..
2009-06-29T03:03:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	i dont know the grub lines for that and im having poor luck finding that on the net
2009-06-29T03:04:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	replace "quiet splash" with "single" and it should put you in the right place, if you know how to dynamically edit the kernel arguments in grub at boot time?
2009-06-29T03:05:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	ill try that now.
2009-06-29T03:13:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	i changed 'quiet splash' to single .. and i still got a lockup
2009-06-29T03:14:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	wait, it didnt save.
2009-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	just remember to change it back when you want to go back to having the splash screen and X...
2009-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	im just booting it with the b option
2009-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	okay
2009-06-29T03:47:00.000Z	d0wn4r	cbhl	thank you sir i am up and running again
2009-06-29T03:48:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	Good to hear. All the best.
2009-06-29T03:48:00.000Z	cbhl	d0wn4r	You're welcome!
