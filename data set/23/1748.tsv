2009-11-05T21:08:00.000Z	soundstopped		my sound stopped working from upgrade to 9.10 from 9.04; any solution?
2009-11-05T21:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	 Ok many people have  had issues after upgrading 9.04 to 9.10.  A good idea would be to try a clean install.
2009-11-05T21:09:00.000Z	soundstopped	sebsebseb	not an option
2009-11-05T21:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	Why not?
2009-11-05T21:10:00.000Z	soundstopped		no place to backup all files (no more space)
2009-11-05T21:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	Buy an external hard disk maybe, or  use  Ubuntu One?

2009-11-05T21:12:00.000Z	soundstopped	sebsebseb	is it a problem in pulse, can i compile it from src
2009-11-05T21:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	 probably, but probably not the best idea also
2009-11-05T21:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	I can't really help with sound
2009-11-05T21:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!sound | soundstopped
2009-11-05T21:13:00.000Z	soundstopped	sebsebseb	i can't even access the sound controls (won't load)

2009-11-05T21:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!one
2009-11-05T21:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	oh no factoid for it or whatever, well anyway as I said you could back up your data with it
2009-11-05T21:13:00.000Z	soundstopped	sebsebseb	i get the error "waiting for sound system to respond"
2009-11-05T21:15:00.000Z	soundstopped	sebsebseb	for major problems on stable releases, the ideal solution is not always to wipe everything and start again with a fresh install
2009-11-05T21:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	sure, but 9.10 isn't that stable really, by the sounds of things
2009-11-05T21:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	check out the notes and find that out for yourself by the way
2009-11-05T21:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	plus if you stick around here long enough  more 9.10 upgrade issues and such

2009-11-05T21:18:00.000Z	soundstopped	sebsebseb	nothing on there regarding "sound"
2009-11-05T21:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	soundstopped	ok well sound is a common issue with Ubuntu since like 8.04 when they introduced puleaudio
