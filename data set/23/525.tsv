2012-09-10T01:39:00.000Z	joe		hey guys
2012-09-10T01:39:00.000Z	joe		ubuntu 12.04, everything is blurry after installing nvidia driver
2012-09-10T01:40:00.000Z	joe		can someone help me please?
2012-09-10T01:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	to start, using nvidia-settings verify your resolution is correct
2012-09-10T01:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	1024x768 is a very low resolution.  i'm guessing your nvidia is not currently working.  pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log might help.
2012-09-10T01:59:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	thanks zyk, in a few
2012-09-10T02:01:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1195552/
2012-09-10T02:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	also "lspci | grep -i vga" ;)
2012-09-10T02:01:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	on the way ;)
2012-09-10T02:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	comes down to "Failed to load module "nvidia"" but i'm still reading

2012-09-10T02:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	2 related questions.  what driver are you currently trying?  how did you install it?
2012-09-10T02:05:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	NVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.20-pkg1.run, i just sh it
2012-09-10T02:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	.run - so you installed one you downloaded from nvidia.com
2012-09-10T02:05:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	that's right
2012-09-10T02:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	i'm so sorry - i can't help you further.   i believe there is an #nvidia channel perhaps though.  best of luck.
2012-09-10T02:06:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	cheers
2012-09-10T02:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	96 does appear to be the correct driver for that card btw.
2012-09-10T02:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	fyi, i think using nvidia.com drivers on ubuntu is a very bad idea (but that's just my opinion - and i'm SUPER conservative)
2012-09-10T02:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	you need a 96 driver, is one in ubuntu?
2012-09-10T02:11:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	not sure
2012-09-10T02:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	joe	sorry man, if you've already tried the nvidia.com driver - i can't/won't help further.  i have no idea how to remove the potential damaging changes it just made.  a package can be easily removed with apt but what you just installed???  someone probably knows, but i consider your system corrupted/compromised.  sorry.
2012-09-10T02:13:00.000Z	joe	zykotick9	that's ok no prob. i might restore it and come back to you ;)
