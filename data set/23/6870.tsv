2005-12-09T07:54:00.000Z	khalif		What is that clicking sound that comes on when the log-in window starts up?
2005-12-09T07:55:00.000Z	khalif		A window popped up saying that GDM_failsafe is the default.
2005-12-09T07:56:00.000Z	khalif		Should I make GNOME the default?
2005-12-09T07:58:00.000Z	khalif		Still nothing!
2005-12-09T07:58:00.000Z	khalif		 grrr!
2005-12-09T08:00:00.000Z	khalif		ok! thanks for all your help mycket
2005-12-09T07:21:00.000Z	khalif		hey all :)
2005-12-09T07:21:00.000Z	khalif		Noob to 'nix here....
2005-12-09T07:22:00.000Z	khalif		I was wondering if someone could answer a couple quick questions for me?
2005-12-09T07:23:00.000Z	khalif		Anybody using Wine currently?
2005-12-09T07:23:00.000Z	mwe	khalif	well, yes
2005-12-09T07:24:00.000Z	khalif	mwe	Have you had any success using it with any recently released software?
2005-12-09T07:25:00.000Z	mwe	khalif	no it only works with quite a limitid number of programs. they have a compatibility list on their website
2005-12-09T07:25:00.000Z	mwe	khalif	most recent program I ran with wine was IE because I needed it for my web bank
2005-12-09T07:25:00.000Z	khalif		I know, I was just browsing it. I'm a web developer who's addicted to Dreamweaver....
2005-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	mwe	khalif	Oh
2005-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	khalif		I use an iMac at home, but I need something for my laptop which is running Kubuntu...
2005-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	mwe	khalif	I don't think it works with wine. check frankscorner.org too, though
2005-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	khalif		What's frankscorner?
2005-12-09T07:27:00.000Z	mwe	khalif	frankscorner.org is a web page with instructions for installing different programs in wine
2005-12-09T07:28:00.000Z	khalif		ok, cool. Thanks mwe
2005-12-09T07:28:00.000Z	khalif		One more question for you: I'm also browsing KDE-Apps.org for some web development tools. Anyone you could suggest?
2005-12-09T07:29:00.000Z	mwe	khalif	http://frankscorner.org/index.php?p=dreamweavermx
