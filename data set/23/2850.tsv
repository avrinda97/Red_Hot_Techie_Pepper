2010-01-07T09:42:00.000Z	kain_		hi all, what is the syntax for mount a ntfs partition with permissions read-write-execute to put in the fstab?
2010-01-07T09:43:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	you can install ntfs-config and you'll have a nice simple gui that does it for you :)
2010-01-07T09:43:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: will this erase the lines i manually put in the fstab?
2010-01-07T09:44:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	/dev/<YOUR DRIVE> /media/Windows ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.UTF-8 0 0
2010-01-07T09:45:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: is this line added manually without installation of ntfs-config?
2010-01-07T09:45:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	yes.
2010-01-07T09:45:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: ok i'll try thanks
2010-01-07T09:46:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	add that line rather than installing ntfs-config... i wasn't sure how confident you were to hand-edit fstab :)
2010-01-07T09:49:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: i get "mount: unknown filesystem type 'ntfs-3g' "
2010-01-07T09:49:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
2010-01-07T09:50:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: what does ntfs-3g do exactly?
2010-01-07T09:50:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	it is the drivers that allow linux to 'talk' ntfs
2010-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: does ntfs-3g change my grub file?
2010-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	no
2010-01-07T09:54:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: THANKS, it worked :D
2010-01-07T09:54:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	 great !:D
2010-01-07T09:54:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: i just hoped it didn't do anything to my grub file cause i had to modify a line to be able to boot Ubuntu on my sata drive
2010-01-07T09:55:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	no, ntfs-3g doesn't have anything to do with grub, you're fine
2010-01-07T09:58:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: i got another problem now
2010-01-07T09:59:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: now when i turn my external hard drive on, i get error : "only root can mount ...."
2010-01-07T10:00:00.000Z	Hammerjak	kain_	putting it in your fstab will auto-mount without needing to be root.... if you turn the hdd on after ubuntu boots... i don't know how to get around that :)
2010-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: hmmm, i'll try and find how
2010-01-07T10:17:00.000Z	kain_	Hammerjak	: how can i create a sort of script to execute some console commands?
