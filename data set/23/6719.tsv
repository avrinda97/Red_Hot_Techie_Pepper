2006-03-19T14:18:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		Hi. I just finished installig ubuntu and made a major goof. I apparently stopped the downloading of current updates and can't restart them without going into superuser.
2006-03-19T14:19:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		That's the problem, rukuartic. I don't have a pw for superuser, I don't think.
2006-03-19T14:20:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		I was asked to put in a user name and pw for myself but not for root.
2006-03-19T14:21:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		Hmm. I  tried that
2006-03-19T14:21:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		What is "sudo"?
2006-03-19T14:22:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	sudo = superuser od
2006-03-19T14:23:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	the super user, or root user, is like the ultimate user on the system with permission to do just about anything
2006-03-19T14:23:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	to go permanently into super user mode type "sudo -s" but be careful cause you can do some serious damage as super user
2006-03-19T14:24:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	You're confusing the root user with the root directory
2006-03-19T14:26:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	/ is the root directory. It's called "root" because the directory structure is like a tree, with "root" at the bottom
2006-03-19T14:27:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	The directories are like branches of the tree and the files like the leaves, hence the analogy
2006-03-19T14:27:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	The "root account" is a user account with permission to do just about anything on the system, like create new users and edit protected files
2006-03-19T14:28:00.000Z	Lil-Abner	Xanadu	thanks. I just tried to use my user password, but it didn't work. Is it supposed to be invisible? No "*'s"?
2006-03-19T14:28:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	yeah it's invisible
2006-03-19T14:31:00.000Z	Lil-Abner	Xanadu	it keeps coming up "authentication failure". Is there a way to verify that I'm not making a mistake typing my pw?
2006-03-19T14:31:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	are you the first user on the system?
2006-03-19T14:32:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	The first user created gets permission to be root, the other users have to be given permission
2006-03-19T14:32:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	try copy n paste
2006-03-19T14:32:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	Paste is ctrl-shift-v in the console (not just ctrl-v like normal)
2006-03-19T14:33:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	It's caps sensitive so check that too
2006-03-19T14:36:00.000Z	Lil-Abner	Xanadu	some how the pass word is messed up 'cause it doesn't work.
2006-03-19T14:39:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	just don't forget it ;)
2006-03-19T14:45:00.000Z	Xanadu	Lil-Abner	try type "sudo -s" (without the inverted commas)
