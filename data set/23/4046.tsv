2007-11-29T17:46:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	I've never used vista, so I dont know.
2007-11-29T17:48:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	RAM is measured in megabytes or gigabytes...
2007-11-29T17:49:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	you can ask in ##windows how to find out what the ram is in Vista
2007-11-29T17:52:00.000Z	ThuLex	Pici	u there?
2007-11-29T17:55:00.000Z	ThuLex	Pici	..
2007-11-29T18:39:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	How are you trying to unmount it?
2007-11-29T18:40:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	can you pastebin the output of `mount`?
2007-11-29T18:40:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	Are you sure that the device is /dev/sdd2?
2007-11-29T18:42:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	does the output of `mount` say that the mountpoint of /dev/sdd2 is equal to where the usb drive is mounting?
2007-11-29T18:43:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	mount without any options will tell you what is mounted and where
2007-11-29T18:44:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	mount
2007-11-29T18:48:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	You're confusing us here.
2007-11-29T18:50:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	You can ask your questions here, but please just one at a time.
2007-11-29T18:52:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	does the output of typing 'mount' on a terminal show that /dev/sdf2 is mounted?
2007-11-29T18:53:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	Are you typing this in a terminal, or on the alt-f2 'command line'?
2007-11-29T18:55:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	yes,
2007-11-29T18:55:00.000Z	Pici	ThuLex	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
