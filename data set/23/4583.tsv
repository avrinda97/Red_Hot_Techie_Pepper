2007-07-03T09:51:00.000Z	Ramon		rich: YES
2007-07-03T09:51:00.000Z	jerbull88		so the one thats not working was a clean slate when u tried to install ubuntu

2007-07-03T09:52:00.000Z	jerbull88	Ramon	what year is the bios dated?
2007-07-03T09:52:00.000Z	Ramon		jerbull: let me check
2007-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	Ramon		Jerbull: it is 1998
2007-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	Ramon		rich: absolutly
2007-07-03T09:54:00.000Z	jerbull88		Ramone, that may be the issue, its a little old for ubuntu, ubuntu has a cutoff at 2000 after that it has to emulate and that could cause issues
2007-07-03T09:54:00.000Z	Ramon		jerbull: and there's no solution for that?
2007-07-03T09:55:00.000Z	jerbull88	Ramon	unfortunately a new BIOS
