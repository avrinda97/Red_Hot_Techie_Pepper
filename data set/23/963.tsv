2010-11-02T18:22:00.000Z	xibalban		I cannot browse/slow browse websites on firefox. However, if I fire up deluge I get enormous download speeds (say 200 kB/sec)
2010-11-02T18:23:00.000Z	xibalban		But, as I quit deluge and try to browse using firefox, it slows down.
2010-11-02T18:24:00.000Z	xibalban		That's exactly what I did. I downloaded Chromium, Opera and even text-based browsers, but the issue persists.
2010-11-02T18:25:00.000Z	xibalban		It seem only my http requests aren't processed. Torrents run fine. Apt-get too runs great but browsers just crawl

2010-11-02T18:28:00.000Z	xibalban		No, my internet rocks always but I cannot browse
2010-11-02T18:29:00.000Z	xibalban		It works great when I download packages using apt-get, it rocks when I use Deluge but it simply wouldn't browse using ANY browser
2010-11-02T18:30:00.000Z	xibalban		Yes, I have Vista dual booted with Maverick, and browsing is a breeze on it.
2010-11-02T18:31:00.000Z	xibalban		Yes, it rocks it is super fast
2010-11-02T18:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	which browsers are you trying ?
2010-11-02T18:33:00.000Z	xibalban	BluesKaj	I've tried several Firefox, Opera, xlinks
2010-11-02T18:34:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	explain your situation pls .home , office/work or ? and what kind of network connection router / lan ?
2010-11-02T18:37:00.000Z	xibalban	BluesKaj	I've installed loads of applications using apt-get which downloads packages off the internet. It provides the download speed average as 200 kBps
2010-11-02T18:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	why are you using wvdial . why not just use /etc/network/interfaces, no need for a network client
2010-11-02T18:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	read my post above
2010-11-02T18:43:00.000Z	xibalban	BluesKaj	What is the difference/advantage?
2010-11-02T18:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	no client needed , no NM , just the settings in /etc/network/interfaces are required , very simple to set up, http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
2010-11-02T18:45:00.000Z	xibalban	BluesKaj	how do I configure my 3G USB Modem for "why not just use /etc/network/interfaces, no need for a network client", a link/walkthrough would be great.
2010-11-02T18:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	oops sorry , I didn't notice the post about the USB modem ...sorry :(
2010-11-02T19:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	is using irc on 3g the same as texting or are you charged for use as a cellphone call
2010-11-02T19:07:00.000Z	xibalban	BluesKaj	well I've subscribed to an unlimited data plan. Hence, no charges per message!
2010-11-02T19:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	xibalban	that's not what I mean , perhaps your network is filtering web-browsing because your router appears as a text source rather than a browser sources to the 3G network ...does that make sense ?
