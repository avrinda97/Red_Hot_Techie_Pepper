2010-04-04T19:36:00.000Z	macha		Every time I try to remove mysql-server-5.1, it tells me "package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should reiinstll it before attempting a removal". However, any attempt to reinstall it causes the package manager to freeze.
2010-04-04T19:37:00.000Z	macha		How do I get rid of it? I can't install anything else while it's there
2010-04-04T19:39:00.000Z	macha		Also, while it's frozen, I have to kill apt-get, then reboot the system to get rid of the lock. Is there an easier way around this?
2010-04-04T19:41:00.000Z	macha		Oops, closed wrong terminal
2010-04-04T19:41:00.000Z	macha		So, how do I remove the lock? (Sorry if you've said it already, I closed the irssi terminal by mistake.
2010-04-04T19:42:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	sudo apt-get install -f
2010-04-04T19:43:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	I can't. It freezes on mysql-server-5.1 normally, and the second time after I've killed one, it just says "could not get lock"
2010-04-04T19:44:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	just check if it goes to sleep, how do you kill it ?
2010-04-04T19:45:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	Closing the terminal window, then it prompts to kill the process running in the terminal
2010-04-04T19:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	erm, ps aux | grep apt will give you an insight
2010-04-04T19:47:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	Ok, thanks
2010-04-04T19:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	no problem
2010-04-04T19:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	is apt still running ? did you check ?
2010-04-04T19:48:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	It was. kill <process_id> got rid of it.
2010-04-04T19:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	check again, to make sure, kill -9 will be better
2010-04-04T19:49:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	Yes, it's gone now
2010-04-04T19:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	run apt-get install -f
2010-04-04T19:49:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	Already done, it freezes on "preparing to replace mysql-server-5.1"
2010-04-04T19:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	then purge it
2010-04-04T19:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	you can also use Synaptic and use the Broken filter to see what is broken
2010-04-04T19:53:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	kk
2010-04-04T19:57:00.000Z	macha	arvind_khadri	, and whoever else was helping - it seems to be solved now. Thanks.
2010-04-04T19:57:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	macha	no problem, happy to help you :)
