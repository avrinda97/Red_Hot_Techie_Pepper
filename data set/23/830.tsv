2011-01-23T14:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	I think when I normaly install stuff I download and compile the default to a dir ~/local  or something like that and are kept separate from the packages installed from deb installs
2011-01-23T14:43:00.000Z	snimavat	sacarlson	?
2011-01-23T14:43:00.000Z	snimavat	sacarlson	any idea?
2011-01-23T14:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	I looked closer at my installed custom and it's /usr/local/*  that they end up,  it's the normal default that's setup in the compile configs i guess
2011-01-23T14:45:00.000Z	snimavat	sacarlson	did u read my thread?
2011-01-23T14:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	yes I read your thread
2011-01-23T14:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	I assume your custom is compiled source from outside ubuntu,  each source is a bit different to configure but they seem to be common for the most part.  but to be sure you should look at the configs of that source
2011-01-23T14:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	oh ok,  so you want to keep the cd install in one set and any upgrades in another?
2011-01-23T14:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	well I guess the easy way is to install from cd and move everything to a new dir so when you add new stuff it will acumulate in the original location
2011-01-23T14:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	I'm not sure how complicated that would be to move all /usr/sbin /usr/bin  /bin /sbin  files to example /usr/sbin.org /usr/bin.org /bin.org /sbin.org  and add those to the path so they will work
2011-01-23T14:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	but I guess there are also the libs and database and etc configs,  I guess it's much more involved than I realize
2011-01-23T14:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	cool I didn't know that
2011-01-23T15:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	maybe the dpkg  --root=dir  option?
2011-01-23T15:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	i looked at --instdir but seems --root has presidence over that,  try a single deb file with both and see,  if it seems to do what you want then maybe make a symlink to a modified dpkg script  that adds the --root or --install on every install after that
2011-01-27T11:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	snimavat	I've seen examples of unity on youtube.com  if you want to see a video of what it looks like google unity youtube
