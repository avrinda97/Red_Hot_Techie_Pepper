2009-12-27T19:24:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	you have to configure it, there is a howto in the src directory for the kernel
2009-12-27T19:24:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	Where can I find that info?
2009-12-27T19:26:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	what setting are you trying to enable?
2009-12-27T19:27:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	CONFIG_NETDEVICES_MULTIQUEUE & CONFIG_NET_SCHED
2009-12-27T19:30:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	You still there?
2009-12-27T19:32:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	yes was looking in the kernel config
2009-12-27T19:32:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	Did you find anything?
2009-12-27T19:32:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	conf_net_sched is already built in as a module
2009-12-27T19:33:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	Does that mean it is already enabled?
2009-12-27T19:33:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	in the stock 9.10 (2.6.31-16-generic) kernel
2009-12-27T19:34:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	means its already a module and should load when needed, but you can manually load it yourself from a shell
2009-12-27T19:34:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	I am using hardy heron.
2009-12-27T19:35:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	should be in there too... check in /boot/ for a file named config with the kernel version, and grep it for the option
2009-12-27T19:36:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	Thanks !
2009-12-27T19:37:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	np

2009-12-27T19:38:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	Sorry had dumb ass moment!
2009-12-27T19:39:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	there is no file named config-x.x.x-x-xxx?
2009-12-27T19:39:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	Sorry had dumb ass moment!
2009-12-27T19:47:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	How can I grep that config file?
2009-12-27T19:49:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	How can I grep that /boot/config-2.6.24-26 ?
2009-12-27T19:50:00.000Z	sloopy	S0LIDUS	use 'less /boot/config-2.6.24-26' and in less '/findMe' will search for text
2009-12-27T19:53:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	sloopy	You are a star! Its enabled. Thanks. Long live Ubuntu!!!
