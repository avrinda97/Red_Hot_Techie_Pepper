2007-10-25T23:11:00.000Z	times9		anyone in here a gnome expert?  im in desperate need of help
2007-10-25T23:11:00.000Z	times9		ok,  gnome isn't reading my ~/.gnome2/session file correctly and doesn't even load metacity or panels when i log in
2007-10-25T23:11:00.000Z	times9		and im forced to log in with failsafe
2007-10-25T23:12:00.000Z	times9		i've even copied the [failsafe] portion of a session file and resaved it as ~/.gnome2/session
2007-10-25T23:12:00.000Z	times9		and nada
2007-10-25T23:12:00.000Z	times9		i have to manually start metacity (metacity --replace) and i still get no theme engine and no way to log out
2007-10-25T23:13:00.000Z	times9		pici:  what does that do?
2007-10-25T23:13:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	are you selecting gnome at the gdm login screen?
2007-10-25T23:13:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	try setting to gnome
2007-10-25T23:17:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	try logging out and deleting all your .gnome related config directories?
2007-10-25T23:19:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	sure. heck, move your whole home directory away, if you have to
2007-10-25T23:27:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	and .gnome and .gnome2?  do you have the ubuntu-desktop package installed?
2007-10-25T23:28:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	huh. try creating a new user, and see if you can login as him.
2007-10-25T23:29:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	its either something funky about your account permissions, your home directory, or a borked install of ubuntu. We should try to rule things out till you figure out which
2007-10-25T23:31:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	no.. if the other works, you should be able to just delete session info and it will create new ones
2007-10-25T23:36:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	thats the default now i think
2007-10-25T23:36:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	you can turn them off in prefs i think
2007-10-25T23:37:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	no.. if that worked, your not clearing something on your own account that you can clear, I'm guessing.
2007-10-25T23:38:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	logout, ctrl-alt-f1 to get a terminal, login and sudo -s to get a root prompt.  do mv /home/yourusername to /home/yourusername-broken
2007-10-25T23:38:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	then mkdir /home/yourusername; chown yourusername.yourusername /home/yourusername
2007-10-25T23:38:00.000Z	Rubin	times9	then try logging in again
