2011-06-30T20:04:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	that doesn't help , especially when theat same usb wifi stick works flwlessly on windows . like my belkin
2011-06-30T20:05:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	"it works on Windows" is not the same as "it works in every OS ever designed by human hands"
2011-06-30T20:05:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	this is why i replaced the mini PCI-E 802.11 card in my laptop with an Intel 4965
2011-12-06T23:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	who set that rule ?
2011-12-06T23:13:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	it's not a rule. it's a request.
2011-12-06T23:14:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	very observant.
2011-12-06T23:14:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	uhhh ...
2011-12-06T23:16:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	feel free to discuss this with me in #ubuntu-ops if you feel my request was out of line
2011-12-06T23:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	oh so you are an op ..what's the rule then , it would be good to clarify it here , f it's 30mins , then is a long time to wait for an answer.
2011-12-06T23:24:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	such a discussion will needlessly clutter a support channel. like dr_willis and XDS2010 are currently doing.
2011-12-06T23:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	no ...I've been in your ops chat before and it's not necessary , I'm just looking for a straight answer. What's the rule , or ist arbitrary /
2011-12-06T23:26:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	it *is* necessary if you'd like me to answer.
2011-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	then don't answer ...I don't see the need to be directed to the ops chat for a simple answer to a question that all ubuntu chat users should know about
2012-01-03T21:12:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	ifconfig does not return route info
2012-01-03T21:19:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	"trolls?"
2012-01-03T21:20:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	yeahn rather than helping the subject first , you guys like to correct other ppls mistakes first
2012-01-03T21:21:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	name-calling is hardly the answer.
2012-01-03T21:22:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	I've been called worse :)
2012-01-03T21:22:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	well, keep it to yourself in this channel, please.
2012-01-03T21:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	same goes for you , if I make a mistake perhaps a friendly pm would be in order then I would correct my mistake in the channel myself
2012-01-03T21:24:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	i will, one last time, invite you to discuss this in #ubuntu-ops.
2012-01-03T21:24:00.000Z	mneptok	BluesKaj	you have *severely* tried my patience, and that of other ops. you are walking a tightrope, and i suggest you turn around and head back to the ledge.
2012-01-03T21:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mneptok	nope,  no kangaroo court for me ... too bad about your lack of patience
