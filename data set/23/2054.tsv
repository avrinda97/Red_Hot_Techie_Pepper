2009-08-21T21:23:00.000Z	ankush		i need help compiling beryl effect ..
2009-08-21T21:23:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	berl merged with compiz to form compiz fusion.  There is no beryl anymore
2009-08-21T21:24:00.000Z	ankush	edbian	ok..are those lovely effects still available?
2009-08-21T21:25:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	They sure are!  Go to: System -> Preferences -> Appearances -> Desktop Effects tab
2009-08-21T21:30:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	Basically it's a backup utility.  There are loads of them in the repos.  Nothing as seemless as "Window System Restore" or Mac's "Time Machine"
2009-08-21T21:31:00.000Z	ankush	edbian	i dnt have a desktop themes tab in appearence, will installing Desktop effects do the thing?
2009-08-21T21:31:00.000Z	ankush	edbian	from add/remove applications
2009-08-21T21:31:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	What tabs do you have there?  I think it's the last one.  The desktop effects are installed by default in ubuntu
2009-08-21T21:32:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	I'm sure there is a tab in there for it.
2009-08-21T21:32:00.000Z	ankush	edbian	no, i have visual effects
2009-08-21T21:32:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	That's it
2009-08-21T21:33:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	What specifically were you looking for?
2009-08-21T21:35:00.000Z	ankush	edbian	i saw the beryl effects on a video on youtube..so installed beryl source files ..but they are not compiling...
2009-08-21T21:36:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	I'm telling you beryl is deprecated.  Compiz can do anything beryl can do + much more :)  If you'd like to configure compiz install "simple-ccsm"
2009-08-21T21:38:00.000Z	ankush	edbian	i went offline, can u help me gettng those wonderful graphics
2009-08-21T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	Yeah. Compiz can do everything beryl can do + more.  If you'd like to configure it install "simple-ccsm"
2009-08-21T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	The cube, the wall, fire  all of it is in compiz
2009-08-21T21:41:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	"sudo apt-get install ccsm"
2009-08-21T21:42:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	"sudo apt-get install simple-ccsm"
2009-08-21T21:42:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	np
2009-08-21T21:42:00.000Z	edbian	ankush	I LOVE compiz-fusion :)
