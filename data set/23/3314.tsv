2008-05-16T19:27:00.000Z	sportman1280		hello. I'm trying to create a package that adds wallpapers for our users.  They are put in the /usr/share/backgrounds  however the dont show up as background options when you try to change your wallpaper.  Any help?
2008-05-16T19:27:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	there's a config file in gconf2/backgrounds.xml. Add them to that file should add them to the background menu.
2008-05-16T19:27:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	Thanks! will look now
2008-05-16T19:28:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	i'm not sure of the file though. Let me search for it again.
2008-05-16T19:28:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	/home/hischild/.gnome2/backgrounds.xml is the file for me.
2008-05-16T19:28:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	is this in the home directory? because we dont want it in home.. we want it in the default
2008-05-16T19:28:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	it's rolled out as a default file. Find the skeleton file and add em in there.
2008-05-16T19:29:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	been looking around for it.  any suggestions on where to look?
2008-05-16T19:29:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	uhm got a few. let me check.
2008-05-16T19:30:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	/usr/share/gnome-background-properites
2008-05-16T19:30:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	that look correct?
2008-05-16T19:31:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	yeah ... you beat me to it with a few secs
2008-05-16T19:32:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	thank you :)
2008-05-16T19:32:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	you're welcome.
2008-05-16T19:50:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	those files for the backgrounds dont seem to change a thing. :(
2008-05-16T19:50:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	because they'
2008-05-16T19:51:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	because they're skeleton files and get rolled out to the corresponding file in your home dir. You have to add it to the file i gave your before to make a change to any existing user.
2008-05-16T19:51:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	would simply removing the .gnome2 folder also work?
2008-05-16T19:51:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	it could, but not advisable
2008-05-16T19:52:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	figured as much. just understanding how it works...
2008-05-16T19:52:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	tried to remove just the background.xml and it doesnt auto create it..
2008-05-16T19:52:00.000Z	sportman1280	hischild	thanks
2008-05-16T19:52:00.000Z	hischild	sportman1280	the file you edited in /usr/share is a skeleton file which gets copied to ~/gnome after which that file is used.
