2006-11-25T06:54:00.000Z	Halpo		anyone here use Eclipse IDE?
2006-11-25T06:54:00.000Z	lazarus	Halpo	yup...what's up?
2006-11-25T06:55:00.000Z	Halpo	lazarus	I used it before the upgrade to Edgy....now everytime i try to open it, it wont open and gets stuck on an error that says "Error notifying a preference change listener"
2006-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	lazarus		hmm
2006-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	lazarus		halpo: what jdk are you running...  i'm still running dapper, so I won't be of much help if the problem is specific to the new version
2006-11-25T06:57:00.000Z	lazarus		well, specific to edgy anyways
2006-11-25T06:57:00.000Z	Halpo	lazarus	jdk?
2006-11-25T06:57:00.000Z	lazarus		Eclipse is a java development environment
2006-11-25T06:57:00.000Z	lazarus		so you need some java runtime environment
2006-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	Halpo	lazarus	oh yeah, well it works for C stuff to I believe, I havent used it much, but i just know i liked the setup of it before i upgraded
2006-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	Halpo		its not a huge deal but was just curious
2006-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	lazarus		sure, but the IDE itself is written in java, so you need a runtime environment to run it
2006-11-25T06:59:00.000Z	lazarus	Halpo	 what do you see when you execute "which java"
2006-11-25T06:59:00.000Z	Halpo		i get a directory.../usr/bin/java
2006-11-25T06:59:00.000Z	lazarus	Halpo	nevermind....execute java --version instead
2006-11-25T07:00:00.000Z	Halpo		1.4.2
2006-11-25T07:00:00.000Z	Halpo		i tried installing 1.5.0 the other day because firefox needed a plugin, but i was never successful
2006-11-25T07:00:00.000Z	Halpo		i've only ever installed from synaptic package manager
2006-11-25T07:01:00.000Z	lazarus	Halpo	if the jdk specific to edgy has changed from dapper, the problem could be related to the new jdk included in the distro
2006-11-25T07:03:00.000Z	lazarus	Halpo	you could try to install the J2SE runtime environment from java.sun.com
2006-11-25T07:03:00.000Z	lazarus	Halpo	there is a version for linux, and the installation is really easy
2006-11-25T07:03:00.000Z	Halpo		ill try that again i guess
2006-11-25T07:04:00.000Z	lazarus	Halpo	basically after you install this version of java, then just modify your path to run the new one
