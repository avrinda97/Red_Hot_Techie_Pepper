2006-03-11T07:19:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	that's funny
2007-10-03T06:52:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	yeah, a bit
2007-10-03T06:52:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	I'm getting this error when I type 'latex blah.tex': dvips: Font ecrm1728 at 8000 not found; scaling 600 instead.
2007-10-03T06:54:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	I can't imagine that being right. Why would calling latex invoke dvips?
2007-10-03T06:54:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	what output format are you aiming for?
2007-10-03T06:55:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	pdf, sorry, that's from 'dvipdf'
2007-10-03T06:56:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	is using 'pdflatex file.tex' an option?
2007-10-03T06:56:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	If it works, sure, let me try thtat.
2007-10-03T06:56:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	Still poor output
2007-10-03T06:57:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	you mean the PDF is poor? Or you're still getting errors?
2007-10-03T06:57:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	This error resulted when I accidently tried to dvi a file that didn't exist I think--and I tried reinstalling all the tex-base, etc. files, but it still does this.
2007-10-03T06:57:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	The pdf quality is poor..
2007-10-03T06:57:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	let me pastebin you
2007-10-03T06:57:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	which version of ubuntu?
2007-10-03T06:58:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	http://pastebin.com/m26be5991
2007-10-03T06:58:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	fiesty
2007-10-03T06:59:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	tex-base is a tetex package. I suggest you make sure you have the texlive packages installed instead.
2007-10-03T07:00:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	OK, I'll check that.
2007-10-03T07:00:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	I actually have to be somewhere at 6 (I'm already late), but I'll try that.
2007-10-03T07:00:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	it's quite possible that this will fix your problem. If not, you'll have to configure dvips and make it default to the desired output resolution.
2007-10-03T07:00:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	OK, perfect.
2007-10-19T04:26:00.000Z	soundray	mikebot	you need the alternate CD to upgrade. With the Desktop CD, you can only do a fresh install.
2007-10-19T04:26:00.000Z	mikebot	soundray	argh, so what do I need?
