2011-10-06T19:00:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	You can google for more information https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
2011-10-06T19:00:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	Its just the TITLE for the OS> (What it will display at the grub meny during bootime)(
2011-10-06T19:01:00.000Z	ugarit	sevith	this goes in grub.cfg or /etc/grub.d ?
2011-10-06T19:03:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	Neither if your on 10.10 its /etc/grub/menu.lst if your on 11.04 its grub.cfg
2011-10-06T19:05:00.000Z	ugarit	sevith	is not supposed to be in /etc/grub.d and then run update-grub?
2011-10-06T19:06:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	what?
2011-10-06T19:07:00.000Z	ugarit	sevith	to boot windows first! grub.cfg says that "It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates"
2011-10-06T19:09:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	no You dont need all those commands. Just add in your windows title and stuff and reboot. It will work.
2011-10-06T19:09:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	You can update grub using update-grub2 or w.e but i dont think you need to
2011-10-06T19:09:00.000Z	ugarit	sevith	on top? of grub.cfg ?
2011-10-06T19:12:00.000Z	ugarit	sevith	so add http://pastebin.com/Q2EQz87P as the first part of /boot/grub/grub.cfg ?
2011-10-06T19:16:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	^----
2011-10-06T19:19:00.000Z	sevith	ugarit	Try Running update-grub like he said. If that doesnt work add something simliar like :http://pastebin.com/p9ZdUv47 to your file but you shouldnt need to
2011-10-06T19:20:00.000Z	ugarit	sevith	when you say "to your file" do you mean 40_custom?
