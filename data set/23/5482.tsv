2009-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	andrew__		beryl help needed
2009-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	andrew__		I am not able to find any useful information on how to install beryl on jaunty jackalope...any gurus feel like helping this newbie?
2009-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	andrew__		really?  very disappointing
2009-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	andrew__		was looking forward to "the Cube"
2009-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	all that stuff is in compiz now
2009-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	compiz is already installed, by default, in jaunty. You just have to activate it in system, preferences, appearance.
2009-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	it's called "Desktop Effects"
2009-07-20T11:25:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	you don't really need emerald, afaik, there is another decorator by default
2009-07-20T11:25:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	don't forget to install the ccsm
2009-07-20T12:07:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	sure
2009-07-20T12:08:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	set 4 horizontal desktops.. that's in the general settings area in ccsm, then enable the cube plugin and set a keyboard key for it
2009-07-20T12:16:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	no worries
2009-07-20T12:23:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	ah.. sorry about that.. I don't get popups unless you put my nick somewhere in the message
2009-07-20T12:24:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	it's called keybindings.. somewhere in the cube plugin settings there should be a keybinding option
2009-07-20T12:25:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	the plugin is called "Rotate Cube".. it's in the Desktop section
2009-07-20T12:25:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	you'll probably need both Rotate Cube and Desktop Cube enabled
2009-07-20T12:26:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	in the "Rotate Cube" settings... go to the "Bindings" page/tab
2009-12-20T18:28:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	no problems here.. amd64+chromium from the nightly build ppa
2009-12-20T18:28:00.000Z	andrew__	Slart	hmmm, ever since I started using chromium I've experienced 3 complete system lockups...which I've never experienced before
2009-12-20T18:29:00.000Z	andrew__	Slart	you have adobe flash enabled in chromium?
2009-12-20T18:29:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	yup.. but a browser shouldn't be able to cause a kernel panic.. or?
2009-12-20T18:30:00.000Z	Slart	andrew__	oh.. chromium the game? or chromium the browser?
2009-12-20T18:30:00.000Z	andrew__	Slart	well, my whole system locks up
