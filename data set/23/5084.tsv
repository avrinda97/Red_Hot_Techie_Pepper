2007-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	siavash		reuben: its wierd because almost all distros work, except ubuntu, the CD wont even load into it

2007-02-25T07:39:00.000Z	siavash		i just liked ubuntu the best. Plus i did here wifi is good on it
2007-02-25T07:41:00.000Z	siavash		Mandriva is a good, i liked it
2007-02-25T07:41:00.000Z	siavash		i might switch back if i cant get this too work out. Its really wierd though, xubuntu works but not any other ones

2007-02-25T07:42:00.000Z	siavash		I like debian
2007-02-25T07:42:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	likes/dislikes can be discussed in #ubuntu-offtopic, mate. this channel is for support
2007-02-25T07:52:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	alternate cd has text mode
2007-02-25T07:53:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	if that disk has OEM, it should have text only mode too
2007-02-25T07:59:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	which torrent? if you're accidentally getting an old herd, it will be slow, less seeders
2007-02-25T07:59:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	is this herd4?
2007-02-25T07:59:00.000Z	siavash	lastnode	herd 3
2007-02-25T08:01:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	herd 4 is out. id grab that
2007-02-25T08:01:00.000Z	siavash	lastnode	is it pretty easy upgrading it?
2007-02-25T08:02:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	from herd3 -> herd4? oh yes, it's just apt-get upgrade
2007-02-25T08:02:00.000Z	siavash	lastnode	apt-get upgrade scares me :)
2007-02-25T08:02:00.000Z	siavash	lastnode	but this is my play laptop anyways
2007-02-25T08:03:00.000Z	lastnode	siavash	apt-get upgrade hardly ever fails, and if it does, it does so gracefully
2007-02-25T08:03:00.000Z	siavash	lastnode	i had a problem with samba dieing after i upgraded libc to 2.4. there was a patch but i had no idea how to apply it
