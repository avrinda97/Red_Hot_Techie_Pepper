2010-01-31T10:22:00.000Z	user123		where can I download the windows driver for ATI Technologies Inc SBx00 Azalia (Intel HDA)? I am running virtualbox to run windows but I cannot have audio in there
2010-01-31T10:22:00.000Z	codebx	user123	did you install the virtualbox guest additions?
2010-01-31T10:24:00.000Z	user123	codebx	I have no idea :(
2010-01-31T10:24:00.000Z	user123	codebx	probably I didnt
2010-01-31T10:24:00.000Z	codebx	user123	boot windows under virtualbox and click devices -> install guest additions
2010-01-31T10:24:00.000Z	codebx		and it'll install the drivers for your mouse, audio, network, etc
2010-01-31T10:26:00.000Z	user123	codebx	is it in control panel?
2010-01-31T10:27:00.000Z	codebx	user123	in the virtual box application itself, there is a menu bar at the top that says "Machine", "Devices", "help" once you have your guest operating system booted.  You just click "Devices -> Install Guest Additions"
2010-01-31T10:32:00.000Z	user123	codebx	I installed it, but It didnt do anything, I think I need to get the audio driver because the card is not detected
2010-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	codebx	user123	virtualbox has an emulated set of hardware (audio, network, etc) so you don't have to get specific drivers for your actual hardware; you just use the guest additions
2010-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	codebx	user123	you should reboot after you install the guest additions, and see if your audio works then
2010-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	user123	codebx	I already did it, but it doesnt work :(
2010-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	codebx	user123	i failed you... oh noes D:
2010-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	user123	codebx	well, thank you, I appreciate your help
2010-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	codebx	user123	does it say there's no playback audio device when you try and play sounds or what happens?
2010-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	user123	codebx	exactly
2010-01-31T10:35:00.000Z	codebx	user123	just to clarify, your normal operating system (host) is ubuntu, and you're running windows via virtualbox, right? i can help you research for a few minutes
2010-01-31T10:35:00.000Z	user123	codebx	that is correct
2010-01-31T10:36:00.000Z	codebx	user123	which version of windows do you have installed? 64bit/32? xp/7/vista/etc
2010-01-31T10:37:00.000Z	user123		32, 7 on x64 architecture
2010-01-31T10:37:00.000Z	user123	codebx	32, 7 on x64 architecture
2010-01-31T10:38:00.000Z	codebx		hey user123, im going to private message you
2010-01-31T10:38:00.000Z	user123	codebx	allright :)
