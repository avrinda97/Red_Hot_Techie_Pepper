2009-11-14T12:00:00.000Z	vng		how can i type vietnamese on karmic?
2009-11-14T12:01:00.000Z	vng		I install language-pack and use scim
2009-11-14T12:01:00.000Z	vng		But it does not work
2009-11-14T12:01:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	install ibus, that will be replacing scim
2009-11-14T12:02:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	thanks
2009-11-14T12:03:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	you may need to log out for it to take effect if I recall correctly
2009-11-14T12:03:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	yeah
2009-11-14T12:04:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	I uninstall scim
2010-02-12T22:13:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	are you installing a package?
2010-02-12T22:15:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	erUSUL : thank you!
2010-02-12T22:17:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	are you using another instance of apt?
2010-02-12T22:18:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	I just do the previous command pkill synaptic
2010-02-12T22:18:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	and synaptic is closed
2010-02-12T22:18:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	are you trying to install via the command line/software center and synaptic at the same time?
2010-02-12T22:20:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	no, I use synaptic to install software. And use pkill synaptic to close it
2010-02-12T22:20:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	that is not the way to close it, did you have more than one instance running? open a terminal and type   top
2010-02-12T22:21:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	pastebin the output of sudo apt-get update
2010-02-12T22:25:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/374857/
2010-02-12T22:26:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	in a terminal type sudo dpkg --configure -a
2010-02-12T22:26:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	yeah, it's running
2010-02-12T22:26:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	thank you
2010-02-12T22:26:00.000Z	bazhang	vng	next time try not to run more than one instance of apt, xkill'ing synaptic is not the ideal way of closing it
2010-02-12T22:27:00.000Z	vng	bazhang	But synaptic hang on. It does not respond me
