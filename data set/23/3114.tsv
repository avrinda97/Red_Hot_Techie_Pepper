2008-07-23T01:56:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	can you launch a terminal window? are you familar with the terminal?
2008-07-23T01:58:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ok, launch terminal and type df -h   to list mounted drives and see if you can spot your main drive mounted, looking at size column might help you identify it
2008-07-23T02:00:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	nice!
2008-07-23T02:01:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	try to df -h again and see if you can see it listed
2008-07-23T02:02:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ok the last column shown by df -h is where it is mounted, can you CD to that directory?
2008-07-23T02:03:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	Im probably not gonna be able to get your graphics card set up correctly, but hopefully can at least get it to boot again
2008-07-23T02:03:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ok, can you see a directory in there called etc?
2008-07-23T02:04:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	cd into etc/X11
2008-07-23T02:05:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	then do ls -l to list files, Im hoping alongside an xorg.conf that a backup had been made like xorg.conf.somethingelsehere
2008-07-23T02:05:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	thats a letter l not a number 1 (sorry not sure what level you are at so being careful)
2008-07-23T02:07:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	awesome, does the date on it look like around the time you tried to get the drivers working?
2008-07-23T02:08:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ok lets first make a backup of your non-working xorg.conf file (btw thats the xserver graphics configuration file), to do this type: sudo cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.notworking
2008-07-23T02:09:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	you will need to enter your password for this
2008-07-23T02:12:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	type pwd and tell me what it says your current folder is please
2008-07-23T02:13:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ah thats why, at this point we want to be in your mounted drive folder, and then cd to etc/X11
2008-07-23T02:15:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	are you looking at X11 as a folder on the desktop or in the terminal?
2008-07-23T02:17:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	we need to do this in the terminal as we need root access to backup / restore the xorg.conf file so, when you type df -h in the terminal can you look at the last column to see where your main drive is mounted?
2008-07-23T02:18:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ok great, so on the command line type cd /media/disk/etc/X11
2008-07-23T02:19:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ok, now is you type ls -l    can you see both xorg.conf and xorg.conf.bak?
2008-07-23T02:20:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	great. now type sudo cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.notworking
2008-07-23T02:22:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	that means you have a copy of where you got to, even though it was broken, just in case you want to refer to it, next we will restore from your backup by typing: sudo cp xorg.conf.bak xorg.conf
2008-07-23T02:23:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	ok, now you need to try rebooting without the cd, I hope that works for you, I've got to go now, if that doesnt work then you probably want to ask "how do I reconfigure X", good luck mate
2008-07-23T02:24:00.000Z	open_sauce	chad	good luck, and may the force be with you
