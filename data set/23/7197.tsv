2005-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	holycow		mostly incredibly useless
2005-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	holycow		i never understood why anyone would install something like that
2005-11-15T08:43:00.000Z	holycow		no dude
2005-11-15T08:45:00.000Z	holycow		and i can qualify the stupid
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		sure its easy
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		if your cpu is so wildly spiking in temperature from one minute to the next so as to justify having a fekin applet on the desktop monitoring it, you don't need an applet you need a new fekin computer
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		if you need an applet to tell you what the weather is like outside of your window, your a fekin moron
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		see?
2005-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	holycow		its stupid
2005-11-15T08:47:00.000Z	holycow		it's cool and the 'cause i can factor' but its usefullness cannot be justified by an ameaba
2005-11-15T08:48:00.000Z	DShepherd	holycow	 what if u want to know the temperure outside...?
2005-11-15T08:48:00.000Z	DShepherd	holycow	u going to look out there fr that
2005-11-15T08:48:00.000Z	holycow		hey i didn't tell anyone how to run their system :) i do reserve the right to be judgemental about how they run their system
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		:)
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow	DShepherd	if you don't know if its 'hot' or 'cold' outside, you have some serious problems
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		really
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		*hmmm* there are these funny things falling out of the sky
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		i wonder what temperature they are
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		oh let me look at my applet on my desktop
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		ohhhhh ... so its RAINING OUTSIDE MY WINDOW and its 5C today
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		yes that makes total sense
2005-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	holycow		-_-
