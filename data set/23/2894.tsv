2011-06-18T10:36:00.000Z	Gracenotes		vlc and banshee are similarly blank. mplayer works, but it doesn't allow seeking in partially downloaded files, making it much worse than totem for me.
2011-06-18T10:36:00.000Z	Gracenotes		it may be a video card problem
2011-06-18T10:36:00.000Z	Gracenotes		the files are just fine
2011-06-18T10:37:00.000Z	Gracenotes		I haven't had this problem before and I'm guessing it's due to some 64bit hiccup somewhere
2011-06-18T10:37:00.000Z	Gracenotes		since I've previously only used 32bit ubuntu and installed it in lots of different places :/
2011-06-18T10:39:00.000Z	Gracenotes		mm, I'll install it and see if it works okay
2011-06-18T10:39:00.000Z	Gracenotes		otherwise I'll look at common dependencies between totem, vlc, and xine and see if I can blame anything
2011-06-18T10:41:00.000Z	Gracenotes		:| still no video
2011-06-18T10:41:00.000Z	Gracenotes		wat
2011-06-18T10:43:00.000Z	Gracenotes		it's odd to not have video working out of the box. lemme check if any apt upgrades will help...?
2011-06-18T10:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	if its nvidia based you may need to blacklist the nouveau driver
2011-06-18T10:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	add the bootoption: nouveau.blacklist=1
2011-06-18T10:47:00.000Z	Gracenotes	ActionParsnip	okay, lemme see how that goes, thanks
2011-06-18T10:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	np man. When you get the proprietary driver in you will be ok
2011-06-18T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	hold shift at boot, press E to (e)dit the kernel. Delete quiet splash and add blacklist.nouveau=1 in its place. Enter to continue
2011-06-18T11:02:00.000Z	Gracenotes	ActionParsnip	hmmm no such luck
2011-06-18T11:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	if you websearch: black screen boot ubuntu   you will see a link to the ubuntugeek site, explains it well
2011-06-18T11:13:00.000Z	Gracenotes	ActionParsnip	video screen seems black still with blacklist.nouveau=1 ... and audio still works
2011-06-18T11:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	blacklist nv too
2011-07-12T22:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	have you contacted the maintainer?
2011-07-12T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	its a ppa so not an official source. The maintenaner may havd ceased the ppa. I'd contact them
2012-04-13T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gracenotes	could bind it to:   killall -u $USER
2012-04-13T05:51:00.000Z	Gracenotes	ActionParsnip	did not know about custom commands. killall seems to make gdm not pop back (yet to add lightdm), but gnome-session-save looks promising
