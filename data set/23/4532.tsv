2007-07-19T14:43:00.000Z	univremonster		cyberhuman:  Do you know how to cleanup the drivers from your old graphics card?
2007-07-19T14:44:00.000Z	univremonster		cyberhuman:  My problems were less severe, I just can't do 3D rendering.  But I know that you have to remove the old drivers before things work normally
2007-07-19T14:45:00.000Z	mc44	univremonster	does your new card not work?
2007-07-19T14:46:00.000Z	univremonster	mc44	 It works, but it doesn't render 3D and it's choppy

2007-07-19T14:48:00.000Z	mc44	univremonster	then enable it
2007-07-19T14:48:00.000Z	univremonster	mc44	 "Because the software is proprietary, it cannot easily be changed to fix any future problems"
