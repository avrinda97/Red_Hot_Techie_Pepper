2008-09-01T01:11:00.000Z	perillux		the Ubuntu cd image is 690MB but I only have 650MB cd's..  is there anyway I could still do this, via some kind of compression?  I'm only 40mb away....
2008-09-01T01:12:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	Unfortunately not.  You could, however, use the minimal CD, which is only 8mb.
2008-09-01T01:12:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	what features would I lose?
2008-09-01T01:13:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	You'd only lose the fact that you'd be forced to connect to the internet during the install (instead of afterwards) to download packages.
2008-09-01T01:13:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	The installed system will be identical (also, it won't be a liveCD)
2008-09-01T01:13:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	is something like that available for Intrepid Ibex yet?
2008-09-01T01:15:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	where can I find that 8mb download?
2008-09-01T01:15:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/intrepid/main/installer-i386/20080522ubuntu12/images/netboot/mini.iso  for intrepid.  Also, #ubuntu+1 is the place for intrepid support
2008-09-01T01:15:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	that page has links to the other versions
2008-09-01T01:17:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	so when all is completed it should be exactly the same as if I had used the LiveCD correct?
2008-09-01T01:18:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	yes, the installed system will be the same
2008-09-01T01:18:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	thank you :)
2008-09-01T01:19:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	Actually, thats technically not true.  The minimal ISO will give you a fully updated system.  Which is the same as if you install the liveCD and then fully upgrade
2008-09-01T01:34:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	u there?
2008-10-27T02:58:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	You can also install the desktop edition, and then install server things.
2008-10-27T02:58:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	you'll want the generic kernel, instead of the server kernel
2008-10-27T02:59:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	wait.. so the server edition comes with things that the desktop edition does not come with?
2008-10-27T02:59:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	All editions merely come with different default packages installed, you can convert from one to the other, etc, at will.
2008-10-27T02:59:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	and how do I do that?  "you'll want the generic kernel, instead of the server kernel"?
2008-10-27T03:00:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	well honestly, I think it would be simpler to start with the desktop and then add the server things.
2008-10-27T03:00:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	well I don't want the server things at all, I just want the desktop.  But I only have 650mb CD's.
2008-10-27T03:01:00.000Z	Flannel	perillux	ah.  Use the minimal CD
2008-10-27T03:01:00.000Z	perillux	Flannel	very nice, thank you :)
