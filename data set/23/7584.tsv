2005-06-20T15:56:00.000Z	a-l-e		hello back with the same question: can anybody help me booting ubuntu from a fire wire external disk?
2005-06-20T15:56:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	methinks that'll take some grub hacking
2005-06-20T15:56:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	unless of course you are using a macintosh
2005-06-20T15:57:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	mac... it's a yaboot hacking...
2005-06-20T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	then screw yaboot
2005-06-20T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	use open firmware
2005-06-20T15:58:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	when you hear the chime, hold down the <option> key (with the fw drive plugged in, of course>
2005-06-20T15:58:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	mmmh... the problem is that yaboot couldn't install properly on the fw-disk.
2005-06-20T15:59:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	ah crap (my mind is rusty)
2005-06-20T15:59:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	you can install yaboot on the fw drive
2005-06-21T16:00:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	the installing failed doing it... and somewhere on the net i've read that it's normal... now i'm reading that i should do some linuxrc magic... but i can't figure out how to do it :-(
2005-06-21T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	you can add a line to your yaboot.conf taht allows you to hit a certain key during boot to point to the fw drive
2005-06-21T16:04:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	googling for that line...
2005-06-21T16:05:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	you should be able to open the .conf and monkey-see monkey-do it
2005-06-21T16:06:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	ok... i think that it's ok just to add a line in yaboot.conf to let him boot on the firewire... the problem with xinitrc is that the kernel should be able to load enough soon the fire wire drivers.
2005-06-21T16:08:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	i'm not sure about kernel stuff, but a mounted drive is a mounted drive
2005-06-21T16:09:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	ok, thank you! i think that i change the yaboot entry and then try to reboot... if i'm not back in the next five days, it means that it didn't work :-)
2005-06-21T16:10:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	you'll still have the other options
2005-06-21T16:10:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	you know how to update the bootloader, right?
2005-06-21T16:11:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	i've written somewhere ... i will find it, yes :-)
2005-06-21T16:11:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	cuz just writing to yaboot.conf won't do it
2005-06-21T16:14:00.000Z	a-l-e	nalioth	yes yes i know! it's something like ybin... i already use linux ppc on this machine :-) now i'd like to try if it also works the easy way ... but not too easy :-)
2005-06-21T16:14:00.000Z	nalioth	a-l-e	well then, you got it goin on
