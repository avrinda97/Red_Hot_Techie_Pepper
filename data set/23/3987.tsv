2007-12-13T17:52:00.000Z	asjad	Guest047	yep
2007-12-13T17:53:00.000Z	asjad	Guest047	it is only the ubuntu machine which does not show the other computers i have to access them via ip addresses
2007-12-13T17:53:00.000Z	asjad	Guest047	for e.g. smb://192.168.1.4
2007-12-13T17:54:00.000Z	Guest047	asjad	- i do windows network engineering for a living so i understand whats going on - just dont understand why you cant browse the workgroup
2007-12-13T17:55:00.000Z	asjad	Guest047	wow, but i can browse it via ip addresses though.
2007-12-13T17:55:00.000Z	asjad	Guest047	the names are gone

2007-12-13T17:57:00.000Z	Guest047	asjad	- smb/cifs runs over tcpip

2007-12-13T18:03:00.000Z	asjad	Guest047	what is a WINS Server?
2007-12-13T18:05:00.000Z	Guest047	asjad	- not really used anymore because of advances in DNS - but its netbios stuff and you aint using netbios
