2009-09-23T20:30:00.000Z	Balsaque		is xubuntu faster than ubuntu 8.10?
2009-09-23T20:30:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	not really
2009-09-23T20:31:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	what video card do you have?
2009-09-23T20:32:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	I wouldn't unless y ou want to have headaches
2009-09-23T20:33:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	if you can get a decent nvidia card then I would say yes
2009-09-23T20:34:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	ati support on old cards has really dropped off so stay under 9.04 unless you can get a better card
2009-09-23T20:34:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	ati or nvidia?
2009-09-23T20:35:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	nvidia currently has better support then ati
2009-09-23T20:38:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	check around with kijiji or craigslist or a local mum and pop store and see if you can get something for next to free
2009-09-23T20:39:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	there is a place around here that I buy alot of used stuff from and they have 64meg agp cards for 5.00
2009-09-23T20:43:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	honestly xubuntu is not much different then ubuntu anymore. it should run with the card you have currently but guess on the age, I would probably go with LXDE for the desktop as it is much lighter
2009-09-23T20:47:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	http://lxde.org
2009-09-23T20:47:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	if  you have 9.04 installed you can simply run sudo apt-get install lxde
2009-09-23T20:48:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	ok, then you would need to get it manually from the website
2009-09-23T20:49:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	if you are happy with it then stick with what you like :)
2009-09-23T20:50:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	maybe for the next one go 9.04 minimal install from the alt cd and then install lxde
2009-09-23T20:52:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	there are alot that are lighter, any of the *box window managers will be even lighter
2009-09-23T21:23:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	its good for restoring really old systems
2009-09-23T21:24:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	don't think puppy will work on a power pc
2009-09-23T21:25:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	check here http://distrowatch.com/search.php?category=All&origin=All&basedon=All&desktop=All&architecture=powerpc&status=Active
2009-09-23T21:26:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	they do but unless its an intel based mac, 9.04 won't work
2009-09-23T21:26:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	for a powerpc you may want to look to the roots and use Debian on it
2009-09-23T21:29:00.000Z	Halitech	Balsaque	the cd they ship works with any intel system, only need to go looking otherwise if you are running powerpc
