2006-10-13T13:53:00.000Z	kristjin		Do not have the necessary permissions.
2006-10-13T13:53:00.000Z	kristjin		not sure how to do that.
2006-10-13T13:54:00.000Z	kristjin		Thank you very much.  I'll do that tomorrow.  For now, it's very late for a work night.  I'm off.  You've been extremely helpful.
2006-10-13T08:31:00.000Z	kristjin		Hi there...
2006-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	kristjin		I am having trouble executing a chown on drive contents, apparently...
2006-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	kristjin		This is what someone else had me doing last night at 1am before going to bed.
2006-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	kristjin		I have bout 10 minutes before going to work if someone has one suggestion I can try, here is what I'm trying to do:
2006-10-13T08:33:00.000Z	kristjin		I have a 400 GB data drive which is 93% full with mp3s that I need to mount.  It is an NTFS volume.
2006-10-13T08:33:00.000Z	kristjin		I have a mount point at /home/kristjin/Desktop/Music which has already been set to 777
2006-10-13T08:34:00.000Z	kristjin		I have in fact already executed a sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home/kristjin/Desktop/Music
2006-10-13T08:34:00.000Z	timalot	kristjin	 how many hours of music?
2006-10-13T08:35:00.000Z	kristjin		And it appears to have been successful, however, when attempting to access the volume from within ubuntu, I get an error window which reads "The folder contents could not be displayed.  You do not have the permissions necessary to vbiew the contents of "Music.""
2006-10-13T08:36:00.000Z	kristjin	timalot	The Full Albums section has 40729 tracks, totaling 117 days, 13:39:26 to my recollection.  I have it in an excel file I can send you if you like.  My singles and unsorted are also in it.
2006-10-13T08:36:00.000Z	timalot	kristjin	its ok
2006-10-13T08:36:00.000Z	timalot		:)
2006-10-13T08:36:00.000Z	kristjin		:)
2006-10-13T08:37:00.000Z	kristjin		Anyway, if I switch to root, I can access the folder, but when trying to chown the contents, it reported back that the drive was a read only drive.
2006-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	timalot	kristjin	u can only mount ntfs partitions read-only in linux
2006-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	kristjin		Now, gomen, but I don't know the commands for chown, nor the exact response we got back, as it was 1am, and he gave me exact commands which I just popped into the terminal.
2006-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	kristjin		I am supposed to hop into the shower in 2 minutes but can stand to do so in 12.
2006-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	kristjin		Any suggestions?  :)
2006-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	kristjin		Goddess I'm such a geek...
2006-10-13T08:39:00.000Z	timalot	kristjin	what do u want to do with the mp3s?
