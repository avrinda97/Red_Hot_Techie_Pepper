2009-03-03T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	/etc/passwd
2009-03-03T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	type gparted in that little box
2009-03-03T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	they are encryptedadn you should NOT touch the file
2009-03-03T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	cat /etc/passwd
2009-03-03T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	you have no reason at all to be looking at, sniffing or even thinking about that file
2009-03-03T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	use gksudo gparted
2009-03-03T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	gparted is gui
2009-03-03T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	in the run box type: gparted
2009-03-03T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	you should have typed: gksudo gparted
2009-03-03T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	both words in the terminal
2009-03-03T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	then you wouldnt see that box
2009-03-04T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	then reinstall grub from the live cd
2009-03-04T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Riya	if windows isnt loading you need to add an entry to /boot/grub/menu.list
