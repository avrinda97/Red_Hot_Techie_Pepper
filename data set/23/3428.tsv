2008-04-25T10:19:00.000Z	talcite		ahh. server edition's pretty fun. I threw it onto an old machine to play around with
2008-04-25T10:20:00.000Z	talcite		its interesting
2008-04-25T10:21:00.000Z	talcite		uhh... sorry why is everyone here saying blacklist b43?
2008-04-25T10:21:00.000Z	talcite		as of the 2 6 24 kernel, b43 should be the one to use. Ndiswrapper is pretty terrible. bcm43xx is even worse
2008-04-25T10:22:00.000Z	talcite		uname -r*
2008-04-25T10:22:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	i used to use ndiswrapper for 7.10, and am now on 8.04 - should i use b43 then?
2008-04-25T10:23:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	depends on your card. Ndiswrapper is good if you happen to be using the MN-720
2008-04-25T10:23:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	lspci -v. Tell us what chipset your wireless card is using
2008-04-25T10:23:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	i see. i'm on a bcm43-something card. not sure how to see the info on it?
2008-04-25T10:23:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	lspci -v
2008-04-25T10:24:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	here it is - BCM4328 802.11a/b/g/n
2008-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	oh... its one of those blasted draft-n cards...
2008-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	let me look it up.
2008-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	it usually worked well previously in 7.10. i haven't tried it yet in 8.04
2008-04-25T10:27:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	your card isn't supported by b43 yet. I'd say stick with ndiswrapper for awhile longer until they release support. Keep looking every few months though. Ndiswrapper is a sub-optimal solution
2008-04-25T10:28:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	i see. well its not critical, cos i have no wifi at the moment so.. i'll do that =)
2008-04-25T10:28:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	thanks for confirming for me =)
2008-04-25T10:28:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	no problem
2008-04-25T10:29:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	cheers
2008-04-25T10:38:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	Ndiswrapper's latest version is 1.52 as of a few weeks ago
2008-04-25T10:38:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	I don't know if its in the repos yet.
2008-04-25T10:38:00.000Z	eugenebythesea	talcite	i see.. thanks!
2008-04-25T10:45:00.000Z	talcite	eugenebythesea	go ahead. 1.50 is fine
