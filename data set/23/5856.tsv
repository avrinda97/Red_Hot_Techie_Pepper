2006-08-19T15:29:00.000Z	pluma		I still get a Look Up timeout on Wikipedia.org in Firefox despite having disabled IPv6 as per the wiki article and having set the about:config value in Firefox appropriately. Dig and Network Tools Lookup still works.
2006-08-19T15:29:00.000Z	pluma		Also, does anybody know a way to monitor the system fans and system/cpu temperature in Linux? I don't want to have to reboot whenever I suspect that they might be acting up.
2006-08-19T15:30:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	like i have asked some time ago, did you checked your dns configuration ?
2006-08-19T15:30:00.000Z	pluma	lamego_	You did? Sorry. Where do I check my dns config?
2006-08-19T15:30:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	doesn't your BIOS takes care of that ? Shuting dow if required ?
2006-08-19T15:30:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	/etc/resolv.conf
2006-08-19T15:31:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	i dont use it, but there is something called lm sensors
2006-08-19T15:31:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	on a terminal, type sudo apt-cache search fan sensors
2006-08-19T15:32:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	your name service is coming from the router, did you checked the configuration on windows ?
2006-08-19T15:33:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	if on windows evertyhing is fine, eventually windows is using the internet dns servers
2006-08-19T15:35:00.000Z	pluma	lamego_	There are multiple windows computers on the network, on all of them wikipedia.org can be resolved correctly. The only PC acting up is my linux box, on which most domains work fine, except for wikipedia.org, which doesn't make sense.
2006-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	on the windows box, open a command prompt
2006-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	pluma	lamego_	Also, as I said, the DNS server is set to the same, i.e. the router.
2006-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	and tupe ipconfig /all
2006-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	check for the dns server IPs
2006-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	so, so it's not dns, its a networking issue
2006-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	pluma	lamego_	192.168.0.254
2006-08-19T15:36:00.000Z	pluma	lamego_	Same result
2006-08-19T15:37:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	ok, i am out of ideas, that seems to be a networking issue
2006-08-19T15:39:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	if firefox hangs during "Lookup" it is doing a lookup...
2006-08-19T15:40:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	have you tried with other browser ?
2006-08-20T16:15:00.000Z	lamego_	pluma	gnome-app-install
2006-08-20T16:15:00.000Z	pluma	lamego_	ta
