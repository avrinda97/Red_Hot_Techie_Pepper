2010-01-11T03:12:00.000Z	obiwan_		hi all! hey 1 question, is there any way to load a manpage in other lang without changing environment vars? Something like man --lang=french ls
2010-01-11T03:13:00.000Z	obiwan_		look at what type of partition you have
2010-01-11T03:14:00.000Z	obiwan_		and then simply mount it
2010-01-11T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	"man man" suggests using the -L <locale>   --locale=<locale> switch
2010-01-14T23:43:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	ouch.. that sounds painful.. there has to be good books out there about bash.. it's been around for a while
2010-01-14T23:45:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	"can't even read the man".. I would say that managing to read the entire man page is a big feat indeed.. reading a book about bash sounds much more pleasant
2010-01-14T23:46:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	man pages are available as html-files as well.. perhaps that's easier on the eyes?
2010-01-14T23:48:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	I would go with something like this http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565923478  (I'm not familiar with that book myself.. that's just an example)
2010-01-14T23:49:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	you're welcome
2010-01-15T21:21:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	two keys? you mean why there is one public key and one private key?
2010-01-15T21:23:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	oh.. didn't know it did that... you've installed the standard gpg package?
2010-01-15T21:24:00.000Z	obiwan_	Slart	yeah hehe
2010-02-07T13:26:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	"type of process" ? what do you mean by type? they are all processes
2010-02-07T13:26:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	there are several tools to list your processes, top or htop for the terminal.. then there's the system monitor in system, administration
2010-02-07T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	afaik sockets or pipes aren't processes.. a daemon is a normal process afaik
2010-02-07T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	if you want to list open ports and such there's "netstat"
2010-02-07T13:46:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	try to explain what you're trying to do
2010-02-07T13:46:00.000Z	obiwan_	Slart	i'm trying to know if a program is running as daemon or not
2010-02-07T13:46:00.000Z	obiwan_	Slart	top does that work, so i thought some simpler program can do it too
2010-02-07T13:47:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	how do you see if a process is a daemon in "top" ?
2010-02-07T13:49:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	afaik a daemon is just a regular process that runs in the background.. ie it's not under direct user control..  some daemons have a special parent process.. but that's not necessary either
2010-02-07T13:53:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	you're welcome
2010-03-01T22:15:00.000Z	Slart	obiwan_	just describe your problem
