2010-10-07T17:45:00.000Z	delinquentme	Dr_Willis	where do i find the install location of a program :D
2010-10-07T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	delinquentme	 check the package manager - it has ways to show whats installed. or if its runable from the commandline 'which binaryname'

2011-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	delinquentme	 its a way to 'share the desktops' but thats not quite the same as 'networking'

2012-08-08T04:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	delinquentme	 :) one of the first things i learned to do with regular explressions was convert an old 'dice rolling' script from REXX. :)  took several dozen+ lines  into 1 regexp.
