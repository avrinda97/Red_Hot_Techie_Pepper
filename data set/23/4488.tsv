2008-03-03T21:03:00.000Z	mrh		Hi Antkin
2008-03-03T21:03:00.000Z	mrh		Say, silliest question ever,
2008-03-03T21:04:00.000Z	mrh		How do I open an application from the command line? I have looked in several sources
2008-03-03T21:04:00.000Z	mrh		Antkin
2008-03-03T21:05:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	which application?
2008-03-03T21:05:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	clamav
2008-03-03T21:07:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	did you install it?
2008-03-03T21:07:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	yes I did
2008-03-03T21:07:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	how? using symatec/apt-get/aptitude, or from source or something odd?
2008-03-03T21:08:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	I did it through the update utility
2008-03-03T21:08:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	i am unaware of what you mean by update utility, as its not an update, if your installing it
2008-03-03T21:09:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	I installed it before through the add/remove then uninstalled it using same
2008-03-03T21:09:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	so it is 'uninstalled' then?
2008-03-03T21:09:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	then it was on the update utility
2008-03-03T21:10:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	I thought it was, but it was not
2008-03-03T21:10:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	does 'man clamav' give you the help file ?
2008-03-03T21:10:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	one sec
2008-03-03T21:11:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	no it does not
2008-03-03T21:12:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	http://wiki.clamav.net/Main/WebHome <<-- you may want to read the documentation on how to use it, located here
2008-03-03T21:12:00.000Z	mrh	neverblue	ok, I will look there, thanks, I figured just the command for opening it from the cmd line
2008-03-03T21:13:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	seems you want to do: clamscan
2008-03-03T21:14:00.000Z	neverblue	mrh	then use 'man clamscan' for reference
