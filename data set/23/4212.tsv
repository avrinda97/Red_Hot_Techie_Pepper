2008-02-27T22:50:00.000Z	danhs		I guess if I just set editor = emacs in profile
2008-02-27T22:50:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	Try the shell variable EDITOR.  A lot of programs check that variable when they are supposed to launch an editor.
2008-02-27T22:51:00.000Z	danhs	levander`	Apparently not subversion
2008-02-27T22:51:00.000Z	danhs		I changed EDITOR environment variable and subversion behavior didn't change
2008-02-27T22:51:00.000Z	danhs		I'd like to make it "universal"
2008-02-27T22:51:00.000Z	danhs		so maybe "editor" variable
2008-02-27T22:52:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	There's a way to tell svn what editor to use, I've done it before.  But, I've switched to git.  If you can figure out what command svn is using, you could alias that command per-user is one way to do it.
2008-02-27T22:52:00.000Z	danhs	levander`	Yea, I agree......I just don't want to have vim be my default editor for eveyrthing *but* subversion
2008-02-27T22:53:00.000Z	danhs		I'd just like to set my "editor" path to point to emacs
2008-02-27T22:53:00.000Z	danhs		but, I figure putting a "editor" link in ~/bin seemed hackish and definitely not hte "right way"
2008-02-27T22:53:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	Shell variables are almost always used in upper-case.  editor won't work I'd definitely bet on that.
2008-02-27T22:53:00.000Z	danhs		so I was hoping there is "right way"
2008-02-27T22:53:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	That's an svn problem.  Sometime applications are non-standard.
2008-02-27T22:53:00.000Z	danhs	levander`	oh?  you think so?
2008-02-27T22:54:00.000Z	danhs	levander`	I just figured that ubuntu doesn't use environment variable EDITOR but instead used path variable "editor"
2008-02-27T22:54:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	Yeah, the EDITOR variable is an old standard.  I'm sure they've heard the complaints about not support it before.  And, I'm sure they've got some non-sense excuse for not doing it.
2008-02-27T22:54:00.000Z	danhs	levander`	Okay....I'll just set the environment variable and not worry about it then
2008-02-27T22:54:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	Every time someone does something non-standard, they've always got some non-sense to back it up.  It's rarely really valid.
2008-02-27T22:54:00.000Z	danhs		nothing else you can do
2008-02-27T22:55:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	I don't know that svn doesn't check EDITOR.  I'm just commenting on your claim that it doesn't.
2008-02-27T22:55:00.000Z	danhs	levander`	Seems silly to have "editor" on the path if I won't use it tho....no?
2008-02-27T22:55:00.000Z	levander`	danhs	Not sure what you mean.
2008-02-27T22:56:00.000Z	danhs	levander`	I mean, even if I changed EDITOR environment variable the "editor" path variable is still pointing to vim; which I don't intend to use.....that seems silly
