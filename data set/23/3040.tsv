2008-08-23T19:05:00.000Z	WDC		root@dlemcoe-laptop:/home/dlemcoe# dd if=image.img of=/home/dlemcoe
2008-08-23T19:05:00.000Z	WDC		dd: opening `/home/dlemcoe': Is a directory
2008-08-23T19:05:00.000Z	WDC		Is a directory? What does that mean! I want to put it into a directory
2008-08-23T19:05:00.000Z	WDC		oh
2008-08-23T19:05:00.000Z	WDC		Thought I was using a different window
2008-08-23T19:07:00.000Z	WDC		Why is this so hard to extract a .img? It keeps saying it can't find it
