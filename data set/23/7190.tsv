2006-07-25T16:12:00.000Z	xed		Oh man.. I want to just set this thing to go and install and go to sleep
2006-07-25T16:13:00.000Z	xed		alright, time for some sleep
2006-07-25T16:14:00.000Z	xed		I'm goign to get some sleep, and probably be back in a few hours... I hate myself.
2006-07-25T16:14:00.000Z	xed		WHY is the installation thing stuck at 0%!?
2006-07-25T16:15:00.000Z	xed		THERE we are...
2006-07-25T16:15:00.000Z	xed		I think it's finally doing something...
2006-07-25T10:40:00.000Z	xed		is there a browser available for xubuntu, other than firefox?
2006-07-25T10:40:00.000Z	xed		I think firefox is a bit of a resource hog on this old machine
2006-07-25T10:42:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	depends how feature-full you want the browser to be, epiphany is a smaller gecko browser, dillo is about as light as you can go and still be in gui
2006-07-25T10:42:00.000Z	xed	elkbuntu	what is this "gecko" and "dillo" you speak of?
2006-07-25T10:43:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	gecko is the engine that firefox runs on, so epiphany is sort of a baby version of firefox. Dillo is basically the lightest graphical browser you can get
2006-07-25T10:44:00.000Z	xed	elkbuntu	and where do about getting this 'dillo' ?
2006-07-25T10:46:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	dillo is in universe
2006-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	xed	elkbuntu	noob here, so I'm just goign to pretend like you understand..
2006-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	--^
2006-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	xed	elkbuntu	does dillo have macromedia flash, adobe acrobat reader, and java support?
2006-07-25T10:48:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	no.. opera is as light as you will go for those
2006-07-25T10:48:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	somewhat
2006-07-25T10:49:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	the applicatiosn button is the one that says 'applications' next to the ubuntu logo on the taskbar
2006-07-25T10:50:00.000Z	xed	elkbuntu	I got that much.. I click on it.. and whatnot.. but where does it say "Add/Remove..."; no where!
2006-07-25T10:50:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	it -should- say it immediately below it
2006-07-25T10:50:00.000Z	xed	elkbuntu	In Xubuntu?
2006-07-25T10:51:00.000Z	elkbuntu	xed	i wouldnt know, i dont use xubuntu, you're goig to have to wait for someone else, or join #xubuntu
