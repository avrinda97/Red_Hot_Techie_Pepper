2009-11-06T08:15:00.000Z	emma	prower	that's not the same thing.
2009-11-06T08:15:00.000Z	prower	emma	Maybe not, but it would allow you to do what you'd like to do, wouldn't it?
2009-11-06T08:17:00.000Z	emma	prower	it's not the same.
2009-11-06T08:17:00.000Z	prower	emma	Not the same as what?
2009-11-06T08:17:00.000Z	emma	prower	as booting into a real cmd line environment where the only processes running on your machine are from the cmdline environment.
2009-11-06T08:18:00.000Z	prower	emma	So? What command line processes are you going to run that are so resource intensive that you'd need to shut down the GUI portion entirely?
2009-11-06T08:18:00.000Z	prower	emma	For that matter why aren't you running ubuntu-server?
2009-11-06T08:19:00.000Z	emma	prower	because I would like to occasionally use the FULL BLOWN Ubuntu, but I would also like to have the learning experience of a proper command line system.
2009-11-06T08:19:00.000Z	prower	emma	Which you can already do :> You just want to make the process more inconvenient for yourself by avoiding dropping to a tty
2009-11-06T08:20:00.000Z	prower	emma	Going to a TTY -is- a command line environment
2009-11-06T08:20:00.000Z	emma	prower	I don't feel it's the same. Some very experienced users would agree.
2009-11-06T08:20:00.000Z	prower	emma	Ahh, so I'm inexperienced for having suggested the easiest route for you to take then, by extension :> Interesting logic
2009-11-06T08:21:00.000Z	prower	emma	Just because you don't "feel" it's the same doesn't mean that it isn't, essentially, the same
2009-11-06T08:21:00.000Z	prower	emma	That's a matter of your personal preference
2009-11-06T08:22:00.000Z	emma	prower	also your taking offense at a comment that had nothing to do with you is the misapplication of logic.
2009-11-06T08:23:00.000Z	prower	emma	So is claiming that dropping to a TTY -isn't- a command line environment, but hey, you're apparently the expert logician here, feel free to take the hard route and ignore everyone's advice
2009-11-06T08:23:00.000Z	emma	prower	I am actually an expert logician.
2009-11-06T08:23:00.000Z	prower	emma	Why doesn't that surprise me :P Every argumentative and opinionated person I've met claimed much the same
2009-11-06T08:23:00.000Z	prower	emma	What makes you an "expert logician" pray tell
2009-11-06T08:24:00.000Z	emma	prower	but that doesn't have anything to do with this discussion. And I never said that that TTY isn't a command line environment.  This is not a problem with logic this is a problem with reading carefully.
2009-11-06T08:24:00.000Z	prower	emma	Well indulge me then, what makes you an expert logician? What are your qualifications?
2009-11-06T08:25:00.000Z	emma	prower	well we would have to talk about that in a different channel. This is an Ubuntu support channel.
2009-11-06T08:26:00.000Z	prower	emma	Well it was apparently an appropriate place for you to insult my reading comprehension skills but hey, I'll indulge you :>
