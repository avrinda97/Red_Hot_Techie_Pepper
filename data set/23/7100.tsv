2006-06-10T07:36:00.000Z	zexr0		it might help you to know that i'm trying to make pcsx works with FFVII
2006-06-10T07:36:00.000Z	jcape	zexr0	Do you have a default locale set?
2006-06-10T07:36:00.000Z	zexr0		I don't know
2006-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	jcape	zexr0	When you ran "dpkg-reconfigure locales", what did it say after "Generating locales..."?
2006-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	zexr0		a lot of lines
2006-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	zexr0		but mainly every en and fr
2006-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	jcape	zexr0	K
2006-06-10T07:40:00.000Z	jcape	zexr0	If you run "dpkg-reconfigure localeconf" as root, what is the currently selected locale?
2006-06-10T07:42:00.000Z	zexr0	jcape	C
2006-06-10T07:43:00.000Z	jcape	zexr0	Was the "manage locales with debconf" checked?
2006-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	jcape	zexr0	My suggestion is to set the default locale using "dpkg-reconfigure localeconf" (ensuring that the "Manage locales with debconf" checkbox is checked), and then log out/log back in.
