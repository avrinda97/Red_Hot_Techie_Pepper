2007-11-07T16:32:00.000Z	gluonman		My OpenOffice is not working right. Everything (Presentation, Spreadsheet, etc.) opens Word Processor and only after going through a document recovery process.
2007-11-07T16:33:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	that might be because openoffice is a buggy pile of crap? ;-)
2007-11-07T16:33:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	if it is a pile of crap, is there an alternative?
2007-11-07T16:40:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	crap. Removing the program and then reinstalling it didn't fix the problem at all.
2007-11-07T16:40:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	any ideas?
2007-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	no, I don't really have ideas, I'm just negative... (Personally I found that OOo will always crash if I have any mp3 playing software running at the same time)
2007-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	you could try Abiword and Gnumeric
2007-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	or vim, sc, and latex, if you fancy getting oldschool
2007-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	thanks.
2007-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	also, even if it opens up the document writer by default, you should be able to go "New -> Spreadsheet" or similar
2007-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	I'll try that.
2007-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	what's a good command to free up disk space (other than obviously removing/uninstalling stuff)?
2007-11-07T16:50:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	also worth trying the Disk Usage Analyser, or the ohter one that shows a pretty pie chart, to see where your space is going
2007-11-07T16:50:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	right.
2007-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	filelight was the disk usage thing I was thinking of
2007-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	it seems like I have to ask a question 20 times before someone answers if I don't direct it to someone specifically. I have one more issue I was wondering if you might know anything about.
2007-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	I can't change my greeting on my login screen to a custom greeting. every time it automatically restores the default Welcome!
2007-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	yes, that's frustrating, but the thing is, I answered the questions I a) had time for, b) was interested in, c) knew something about...
2007-11-07T17:06:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	I'm afraid I don't know in this case... you're best off asking in public (and yes, I do get that that can be frustrating :-( )
2007-11-07T17:06:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	I wasn't talking about you ignoring questions. I just meant that if I pose a question to anyone, it doesn't get answered. I aksed the question many times, but only got answered when I specifically directed it at you.
2007-11-07T17:07:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	See what I'm saying?
2007-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	osfameron	gluonman	yarr... well, good luck!  (/me heads off to lunch)
2007-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	gluonman	osfameron	enjoy your lunch.
