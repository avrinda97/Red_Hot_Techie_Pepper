2009-04-04T21:05:00.000Z	usr13	media	What type of connection is getting cut off.  And Cut off from what?  Is it wired, or wireless?  etc.
2009-04-04T21:06:00.000Z	usr13	media	Are you very far from the AP?
2009-04-04T21:07:00.000Z	usr13	media	Sound like a weak signal problem.
2009-04-04T21:08:00.000Z	usr13	media	what does   iwconfig    say?
2009-04-04T21:09:00.000Z	usr13	media	iwconfig
2009-04-04T21:14:00.000Z	usr13	media	Your problem is weak signal.
2009-04-04T21:15:00.000Z	usr13	media	This is mine: Link Quality=88/100  Signal level=-51 dBm  This is yours: Link Quality=48/64  Signal level=21/65
2009-04-04T21:15:00.000Z	usr13	media	Notice the difference?
2009-04-04T21:17:00.000Z	usr13	media	Microwave requires line of sight. Improve the location of the client radio or the AP and try again.
