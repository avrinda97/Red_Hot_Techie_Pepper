2010-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	kraig6412		if you hold down shift when you restart and hit f6 deleate quite and splash you can get in to the gnome and install the recomended driver for computer if you have nvidea
2010-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	kraig6412		*****after deleating quite and splash type "nomodeset"
2010-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	nips		I don't have a cd :c
2010-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	nips	kraig6412	when do I do that ctrl f6 thing?
