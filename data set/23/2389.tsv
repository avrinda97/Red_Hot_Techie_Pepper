2009-03-27T12:09:00.000Z	androxoid1		Hiho, if got a problem with going full screen in games. When I start them my screen turns black and I get an "Analog - Out of Range - 80.8kHz / 65 Hz" Whereas the first number always changes to something between 80 and 85... anyone knows what could be the problem?
2009-03-27T12:10:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	androxoid1	turn your refresh rate down on your monitor
2009-03-27T12:11:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	androxoid1	should find what the optimum refresh rate is and resolution
2009-03-27T12:11:00.000Z	androxoid1		it is on 50Hz in the resolutionoptions
2009-03-27T12:11:00.000Z	androxoid1		I only can go for 50, 51 and 107
2009-03-27T12:11:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	androxoid1	what about your game options?

2009-03-27T12:20:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	androxoid1	I'm not sure what else to tell you, if your range settings are correct, I'm not sure what else could be the problem
2009-03-27T12:20:00.000Z	androxoid1	o0Chris0o	 where can I find those range settings?
2009-03-27T12:21:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	androxoid1	try asking in #xorg they may be able to help you
2009-03-27T12:21:00.000Z	androxoid1		alright thanks
2009-03-27T12:21:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	androxoid1	have to google the make and model and serial number to see if you can find a match to find the specs
