2008-06-21T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	do you have a 3d party repo added that provides mono?
2008-06-21T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	what thats about is you have a package mono-addins that has that file in it. when dpkg gets ready to install a new package, it checks to be sure it's not overwriting a file from another package.
2008-06-21T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	so someone didn't write their package to follow the ubuntu file structure.
2008-06-21T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	remove mono-addins ,
2008-06-21T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	apt-cache policy mono-addins will tell you what repo it's from
2008-06-21T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	apt-get remove --purge mono-addins . You might find it trying to remove some other packages that were installed from the 3d party repo as well
2008-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	sorry, mono-addins-0.3
2008-06-21T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	no try installing the package you wanted in the first place
2008-06-21T09:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	there's no context there, waht package, what are you doing?
2008-06-21T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	you haven't even told us what you are doing when you get that error
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	there's some forums there as well. This is an ubuntu system help channel, not mono programming
2008-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	and the channel's I'm pointing you at aren't on Freenode
2008-06-21T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	you probably haven't been in those yet
2008-06-21T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	no, I understand frustration with an error you can't track down, just that you're gonna get very lucky to get programming help in a pm from here
2008-06-21T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Bourne	yw
