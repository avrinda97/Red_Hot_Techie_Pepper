2012-10-27T20:57:00.000Z	slave_of_God		Hey guys
2012-10-27T20:58:00.000Z	slave_of_God		Does anyone use ubuntu 12.04 with AMD 64?
2012-10-27T20:59:00.000Z	slave_of_God		I got 8GB ram, 1GB gpu
2012-10-27T20:59:00.000Z	slave_of_God		1,6 quad core
2012-10-27T21:00:00.000Z	slave_of_God		I tried to open LibreOffice but it kept freezing my pc each time i tried to open it
2012-10-27T21:00:00.000Z	slave_of_God		So I removed and replaced it with openoffice
2012-10-27T21:00:00.000Z	slave_of_God		and now I experience the same issue
2012-10-27T21:02:00.000Z	escott	slave_of_God	what degree of freezing
2012-10-27T21:10:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	a degree where you leave your laptop open as soon as it freezes and ten hours later discover it still be freezed
2012-10-27T21:11:00.000Z	escott	slave_of_God	i mean does it respond to capslock or mouse pointer movements, can you ssh into it. can you switch to tty1, can you reisub it
2012-10-27T21:12:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	but the gui is freezed
2012-10-27T21:12:00.000Z	escott	slave_of_God	then that is not "frozen" thats a graphics glitch. the problem is with your graphics card drivers. ati or nvidia?
2012-10-27T21:13:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	ati
2012-10-27T21:13:00.000Z	escott	slave_of_God	fglrx or radeon driver? (proprietary or open source)
2012-10-27T21:14:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	I think it's radeon
2012-10-27T21:14:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	no, it's not
2012-10-27T21:14:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	i see now
2012-10-27T21:15:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	it's fglrx - can see it trough additional drivers which I have enabled
2012-10-27T21:16:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	what to do now :(
2012-10-27T21:17:00.000Z	escott	slave_of_God	so thats proprietary driver. not a lot we can say about that b/c the code is not open. you might find radeonhd more stable
2012-10-27T21:18:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	but that won't fit my card
2012-10-27T21:20:00.000Z	escott	slave_of_God	why not?
2012-10-27T21:22:00.000Z	slave_of_God	escott	i'll try to fix it :-) Thanks for help
