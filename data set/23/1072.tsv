2010-09-24T21:24:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	This is linux, do whatever you like :)
2010-09-24T21:26:00.000Z	th_		is there a way to verify what window manager is loaded?
2010-09-24T21:28:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	you can choose it at login
2010-09-24T21:29:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	yea... is it possible to have 2 running? i mean i did install openbox but my confs doesnt seem to affect enviroment :S
2010-09-24T21:29:00.000Z	nothingspecial		obconf? rc.xml menu.xml?
2010-09-24T21:30:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	obconf
2010-09-24T21:31:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	Are you using openbox "within" anything else? Gnome, Lxde? Just choose openbox session at login.
2010-09-24T21:32:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	gnome. i chose openbox gnome session. theres no other options
2010-09-24T21:33:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	Not sure, I don`t use gnome. I would think that gnome is your problem though. You may have to edit your xinitrc
2010-09-24T21:34:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	yes thats what i thought. what are you using?
2010-09-24T21:34:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	lxde, not used openbox for a while :)
2010-09-24T21:34:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	how come?
2010-09-24T21:35:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	not openbox, or using lxde?
2010-09-24T21:35:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	not openbox. i think its pretty good.
2010-09-24T21:36:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	it`s great, but I`m just taking lxde for a spin. I kind of like it
2010-09-24T21:37:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	so you are one of those "players" what i call them. instead of playing CoD you conf and try different distros :P
2010-09-24T21:37:00.000Z	th_		*as
2010-09-24T21:38:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	`fraid so
2010-09-24T21:38:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	im not saying theres nothing wrong with it. but i like to setup my system and stick to it.
2010-09-24T21:39:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	I have a few systems, and all of them dual boot :)
2010-09-24T21:40:00.000Z	th_	nothingspecial	i have 2. unfortunately they have dual boots too... XP being that other OS
2010-09-24T21:41:00.000Z	nothingspecial	th_	No windows, different linux distros. I got to go
