2009-08-07T05:11:00.000Z	bucky	Orange_v_Blue	i also installed other supporting packages
2009-08-07T05:11:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	bucky	similar problem? audio skipping in music and video?

2009-08-07T05:13:00.000Z	bucky	Orange_v_Blue	no.. since alsa has dropped alsaconf  alsa could not figure out that my sound was an ac97 not an nvidia chipset
2009-08-07T05:13:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	bucky	but it may help anyway?
2009-08-07T05:13:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	bucky	because I'm almost at "whatever it takes"
