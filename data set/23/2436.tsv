2009-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	Shadow121		How can i remove mythtv?
2009-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Either synaptic, or "sudo apt-get remove mythtv"
2009-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	"sudo apt-get remove <package name>"
2009-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	 i get this "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"
2009-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Looks like dpkg is broken.
2009-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	i cant seem to remove mythtv-backend.  Its giving me all these problems.
2009-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Have you tried, "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
2009-05-11T09:43:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	 i get dpkg: error processing mythtv-backend (--configure)
2009-05-11T09:44:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Have you tried to, "sudo apt-get remove mythtv-backend"
2009-05-11T09:45:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	it says i need to stop the backend from running.
2009-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	try "killall mythtv"
2009-05-11T09:47:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Not sure how to stop the backend. But I'm sure you could type, "top" in the browser, figure out the PID, then "kill <PID>".
2009-05-11T09:47:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	bah not browser. terminal
2009-05-11T09:49:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Or try, "killall mythtv-backend"
2009-05-11T09:51:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	is there a mode i can login to that will only run the system minimums?  Like safe mode in windows?
2009-05-11T09:53:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Not sure. I doubt it. This is not Windows. If you used the alternate installation disc, you can boot the computer into recovery mode or whatever and it'll boot into a commandline interface which then you can fix your installation. But you don't really need that.
2009-05-11T09:55:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	 hmmmm maybe if i restart i can get rid of it.  Another issue trying to remove it is this message "MythTV home directory, /home/mythtv does not exist."
2009-05-11T09:55:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	try sudo /etc/init.d/mythtv-backend stop
2009-05-11T09:56:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	:  I get this with that command " MythTV home directory, /home/mythtv does not exist."
2009-05-11T09:57:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	#mythtv
2009-05-11T09:57:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	 Thanks :)
2009-05-11T09:58:00.000Z	J-_	Shadow121	Sorry I couldn't help. I mean, this is ubuntu support. But, that should have stopped mythtv. If you ask then anything about Ubuntu they'll probably direct you this way
2009-05-11T10:01:00.000Z	Shadow121	J-_	:  Thanks for the help anyway :)
