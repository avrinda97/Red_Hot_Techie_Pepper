2008-08-06T10:14:00.000Z	rodold		hi i have a problem with ndiswrapper on xubuntu
2008-08-06T10:15:00.000Z	rodold		penol: ive followed all of the instructions on the website but when i try to install the drivers it says that ndiswrapper isnt installed
2008-08-06T10:16:00.000Z	rodold		penol: i've gotten it to work a long time ago but i dont remember
2008-08-06T10:16:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	do you not have ndiswrapper installed...?
2008-08-06T10:17:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	actually, when i run sudo make install i get a flood of errors
2008-08-06T10:17:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	why not just download the binary?
2008-08-06T10:17:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	and on the Ubuntu forums all the solutions involve apt-get or downloading something, which i cant because i dont have an internet connection
2008-08-06T10:18:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	i downloaded the source on another PC and transferred it with a usb drive and followed the installation instructions
2008-08-06T10:18:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	when i get to sudo make install i get a bunch of errors and i have no clue what to do
2008-08-06T10:18:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/ndiswrapper-utils-1.9 http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/ndiswrapper-common
2008-08-06T10:19:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	should i dowlnoad that and install it?
2008-08-06T10:19:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	yes, just transfer the .deb to your box without a connection
2008-08-06T10:19:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	OK, i'll give it a try, thanks for the help! :)
2008-08-06T10:34:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	i installed the driver for my wifi card :) now how do i configure it? it doesnt show up in the network manager
2008-08-06T10:35:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	If you installed the driver correctly, it should automatically be added to network-manger
2008-08-06T10:35:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	wifi networks, that is
2008-08-06T10:36:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	The network manager's still empty...although the installation went smoothly (i think)
2008-08-06T10:36:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	I installed the windows XP .inf drivers that were on the wifi card CD
2008-08-06T10:37:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	what type of card is this
2008-08-06T10:37:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	its an encore brand card with a marvell chipset
2008-08-06T10:38:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	If you're sure you installed everything correctly (with the correct modules), that sounds more like a googleable bug you can hopefully find a fix to
2008-08-06T10:38:00.000Z	rodold	RequinB4	i'll just try restarting the pc, see if that helps :P
2008-08-06T10:38:00.000Z	RequinB4	rodold	that would be good too
