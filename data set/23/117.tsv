2012-07-19T12:08:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	uhm, please.
2012-07-19T12:08:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	his question is perfectly understandable.
2012-07-19T12:09:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	please don't be so incredibly stupid.
2012-07-19T12:11:00.000Z	L3top	aetoxx	his question is about how to "protect" files from being removed. I am not sure of many scenarios where this is a fear... so I asked for clarification.
2012-07-19T12:19:00.000Z	L3top	aetoxx	why are you using gksudo out of curiosity? and what is the case if you type su -u otheruser mplayer /path/to/mp3.file?   Also does su -u alsamixer reveal anything?
2012-07-19T12:20:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	alsamixer isn't a user
2012-07-19T12:20:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	I am using gksudo, because I want to run an X program with sound as another user.
2012-07-19T12:21:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	no
2012-07-19T12:25:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	if you want to help, test it first on your own system before suggesting anything.
2012-07-19T12:26:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	I know the answer; I am not here to teach you Linux.
2012-07-19T12:45:00.000Z	L3top	aetoxx	DISPLAY=:0 su - user -c 'mplayer /path/to/an.mp3'      works just fine. Dont need to open it as root... which is what you are doing with gksudo.
2012-07-19T12:46:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	gksudo doesn't do anything as root with the -u option.
2012-07-19T12:53:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	correct
2012-07-19T12:53:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	via kdesudo, I can run graphical applications; there is just no sound.
2012-07-19T12:53:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	and previously did this work.
2012-07-19T13:02:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	cannot open mixer: No such file or directory
2012-07-19T13:03:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	(which is a bad error message, because there is no such thing as 'mixer', there might be something like /dev/something)
2012-07-19T13:04:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	 open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
2012-07-19T13:06:00.000Z	L3top	aetoxx	can you log in as that user and check to see that this user does not have alsamixer avail?
2012-07-19T13:06:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	as I said before; if I properly login as that user, I can play audio.
2012-07-19T13:07:00.000Z	aetoxx	L3top	which means that it also has alsamixer available.
2012-07-19T13:09:00.000Z	L3top	aetoxx	Sorry that I do not cling to your every word when speaking to other people. I will try and follow your conversations closer... I guess.
