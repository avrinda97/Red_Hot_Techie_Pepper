2008-01-16T02:46:00.000Z	blackranger	khermans	: shouldsn't the vista drivers work? it still didn't work with ndiswrapper
2008-01-16T02:47:00.000Z	khermans	blackranger	it may be possible that they implement some feature of NDIS in Vista that is not presently implemented in ndiswrapper???
2008-01-16T02:47:00.000Z	khermans	blackranger	can you try the XP driver instead?
