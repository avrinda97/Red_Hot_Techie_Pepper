2008-05-13T06:13:00.000Z	StevenX		how do i turn of the beeps in ubuntu? For example, when I hit backspace and there is "no more room" to go.
2008-05-13T06:14:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	System > Preferences > Sound ... "System Beep" tab.
2008-05-13T06:14:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	thank you.
2008-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	I installed starup-manager, but I don't know how to bring it up.
2008-05-13T08:18:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	dpkg -L startup-manager | grep bin ... one of those  :P  I'm leaving for a bit though.
2008-05-13T08:18:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	thanks.
2008-05-28T05:20:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	go to 'ctrl + alt + f8' and logout
2008-05-28T05:21:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	thank you.
2008-05-28T10:46:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	screenlets
2008-05-28T10:46:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	thanks. are there themes for that?
2008-05-28T10:46:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	many
2008-05-28T10:47:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	screenlets is the nicest by far... they are actual mini apps rather than just html boxes
2008-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	and can i find these themes on deviant art or is there a specific website you prefer?
2008-05-28T10:49:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	www.gnome-look.org
2008-05-28T10:49:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	 i installed screenlets from apt-get. how do i star it?
2008-05-28T10:49:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	thanks again.
2008-05-28T10:50:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	should be in Applications > Acessories
2008-05-28T10:50:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	it's not there. it installed fine in apt-get. no errors
2008-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	dpkg -L screenlets | grep bin
2008-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	fde	StevenX	run the appropriate with a & after it.
2008-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	StevenX	fde	I get the following:
