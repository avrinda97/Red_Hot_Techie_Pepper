2009-08-31T19:55:00.000Z	stlsaint		how do you get into a cd-rom from terminal?
2009-08-31T19:56:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	cd /media/cdrom
2009-08-31T19:56:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	i think that's it, but i'm sure that this will work:  run "mount", not as root
2009-08-31T19:57:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	actually, make that "mount|grep cd"
2009-08-31T19:57:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	that should tell you where the device is mounted, if anywhere
2009-08-31T19:59:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	how's it working out for you?
2009-08-31T20:00:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	well, if you'd like to make an image, i'd look into the manpage for dd
2009-08-31T20:01:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	something along the lines of dd if=/dev/your-cdrom-device,-most-likely-cdrom0 of=~/Desktop/my-image.iso
2009-08-31T20:01:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	in that case, just use cp
2009-08-31T20:02:00.000Z	stlsaint	bunny	k...will do
2009-08-31T20:03:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	try man cp, basically it stands for "CoPy", the use is "cp <original source file> <new copy of file's destination directory>"
2009-08-31T20:03:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	it sounds like you're really missing out on the joy's of the cli
2009-08-31T20:04:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	see linuxcommand.org
2009-08-31T20:04:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	sorry, idk how to fix that
2009-08-31T20:04:00.000Z	stlsaint	bunny	well im slowly learning cmds to use with day today ops
2009-08-31T20:04:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	actually, try "reset"
2009-08-31T20:05:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	also, LEARN VIM!!!
2009-08-31T20:06:00.000Z	stlsaint	bunny	reset? also yea i just made a vm of crunchbang which comes with VIM
2009-08-31T20:06:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	sudo apt-get install vim-gnome
2009-08-31T20:09:00.000Z	stlsaint	bunny	what makes it better than say nano or gedit
2009-08-31T20:11:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	well, its REALLY efficient once you learn all the functions that are relevant to what you use text editors for the most
2009-08-31T20:12:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	the only caveat is that you reach a point of diminishing returns, you need to know when to be happy with the amount of features you know how to use, and stop expending time on learning new ones
2009-08-31T20:12:00.000Z	bunny	stlsaint	that way, it actually does save you time
