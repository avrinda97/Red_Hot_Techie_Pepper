2011-05-01T04:47:00.000Z	Susanna		Hi there, updated Ubuntu and now graphical output is dead slow when second monitor is connected
2011-05-01T04:47:00.000Z	Susanna		Switched to gnome 3, no difference. Seems to be a driver issue?!
2011-05-01T04:47:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	what graphic adapter or driver installed?
2011-05-01T04:48:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	well, tried with Unity as well but was the same problem
2011-05-01T04:49:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	type in terminal ' sudo /usr/bin/jockey-gtk ' and see if any driver is needed
2011-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	"No proprietary drivers are used on this system"
2011-05-01T04:51:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	is that a first run after upgrading?
2011-05-01T04:51:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	Yes
2011-05-01T04:52:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	well I did reboots already
2011-05-01T04:52:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	might need to reboot. sorry one thing.. was that an upgrade or fresh install?
2011-05-01T04:52:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	upgrade
2011-05-01T04:52:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	please don't tell me to reinstall
2011-05-01T04:53:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	, please reinstall
2011-05-01T04:53:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	j/k :p
2011-05-01T04:54:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	did you do the upgrade as it should - updating previous ubuntu, fixing the system and not interrupting the upgrade process?
2011-05-01T04:54:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	I reckon it is a bloody driver issue and will be solved over time (http://bit.ly/mLhpDN). Why do you think a reinstall will solve the issue
2011-05-01T04:55:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	The update ran without any issue
2011-05-01T04:55:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	and everything worked well before
2011-05-01T04:55:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	i was kidding, as i said right after it. don't need to reinstall
2011-05-01T04:55:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	do the failsafeX. you now how?
2011-05-01T04:56:00.000Z	Susanna	lcb	Yes, I'll try
2011-05-01T04:56:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	do the default, to start
2011-05-01T04:57:00.000Z	lcb	Susanna	SHIFT after bios messages and before grub, recovery, failsafeX and blah blah... i think you know
