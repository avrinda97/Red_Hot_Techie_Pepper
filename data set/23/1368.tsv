2011-06-25T22:45:00.000Z	unclemantis		so this would run once a minute? * * * * * /usr/bin/env ruby
2011-06-25T22:46:00.000Z	unclemantis		well it is not LOL
2011-06-25T22:46:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	You have to wait
2011-06-25T22:46:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	It may not start till about 3-5 minutes
2011-06-25T22:46:00.000Z	unclemantis	soreau	ok
2011-06-25T23:33:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	You should eliminate the possibility of errors in cron by 1) Specifying the full path of any files or binaries you invoke 2) Use an echo command to test 3) Run the command in a terminal (with full paths) to make sure it works
2011-06-25T23:34:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	So instead of 'echo' you would use whatever the value of 'which echo' is when run as your normal user
2011-06-25T23:34:00.000Z	unclemantis	soreau	i have done all of the above
2011-06-25T23:34:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	What happens when you try and echo something > /tmp/somefile ?
2011-06-25T23:35:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	Also..
2011-06-26T00:16:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	Like I said, use echo something > /tmp/somefile
2011-06-26T00:18:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	Or something like date command
2011-06-26T00:18:00.000Z	unclemantis	soreau	so how do i find out why the other command is not running?
2011-06-26T00:18:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	/bin/date > /tmp/croncheck
2011-06-26T00:19:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	What command are you trying that isn't working?
2011-06-26T00:20:00.000Z	unclemantis	soreau	/usr/bin/env ruby /home/unclemantis/rails_projects/raffle2/script/rails runner 'UserTransactionsController.new.test'
2011-06-26T00:22:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	ruby? How is it supposed to know where that is
2011-06-26T00:22:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	What is the output of 'which ruby'?
2011-06-26T00:26:00.000Z	unclemantis	soreau	i am using this and it is not firing.....    * * * * * /usr/bin/env /home/unclemantis/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/bin/ruby /home/unclemantis/rails_projects/raffle2/script/rails runner 'UserTransactionsController.new.test'
2011-06-26T00:26:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	What is 'runner' here?
2011-06-26T00:27:00.000Z	unclemantis	soreau	runner is an attribute
2011-06-26T00:27:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	Should work then, give it 5 minutes or more
2011-06-26T00:29:00.000Z	soreau	unclemantis	The trick is, cron has an extremely minimal environment so you have to tell it everything like full paths and environment variables
