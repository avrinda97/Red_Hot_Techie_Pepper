2009-11-15T00:55:00.000Z	vis		lol, no, but I'm really tempted to
2009-11-15T00:55:00.000Z	vis		Are there any benefits to it?
2009-11-15T00:55:00.000Z	vis		why do you ask?
2009-11-15T00:56:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	because to set a default device you can do it in sound prefs instead of using asoundconf. because
2009-11-15T00:46:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	yes
2009-11-15T00:47:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	asoundconf list
2009-11-15T00:47:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	to list your audio devices
2009-11-15T00:47:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	e.g. it lists one as "Live"
2009-11-15T00:47:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	thus, then to set it as the default, you do: asoundconf set-default Live
2009-11-15T00:48:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	sorry its set-default-card not set-default
2009-11-15T00:49:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	eh, maybe you need to install the alsa-utils package
2009-11-15T00:50:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	what command?
2009-11-15T00:51:00.000Z	vis	kostkon	asoundconf
2009-11-15T00:51:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	hmm
2009-11-15T00:52:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	ok, it seems it was remove from karmic. but there is "asoundconf-gtk"
2009-11-15T00:52:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	just install this
2009-11-15T00:54:00.000Z	vis	kostkon	apting now, thanks very much =)
2009-11-15T00:55:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	:) you have removed pulse?
2009-11-15T00:55:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	eh yeah, some.
2009-11-15T00:57:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	asoundconf does not work if you have pulse and your apps send their sound through pulse
2009-11-15T00:57:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	what problems do you have with pulse?
2009-11-15T00:58:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	hmm ok
2009-11-15T01:00:00.000Z	kostkon	vis	if you want to remove pulse, yeah it seems to be ok
