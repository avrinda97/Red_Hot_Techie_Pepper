2007-06-16T16:58:00.000Z	BrightEyes`		hello.any good DELPHI developement tools for linux?
2007-06-16T05:07:00.000Z	BrightEyes`		which programming language has the easiest and newest tools for applications with gui? (for linux)
2007-06-16T05:07:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	probably Python
2007-06-16T05:09:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	python has tools for making gui easily?
2007-06-16T05:09:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	Glade has export for python, sure.
2007-06-16T05:10:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	but if it's easy you want, maybe windows programming in VB.net is more your speed?
2007-06-16T05:11:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	yes VB.net...well except from java any other programming languages for making gui easily??
2007-06-16T05:12:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	if you want to do something, you're going to have to learn. Python and Glade will probably be your best bet. Python is a full-featured 4G language with clear syntax and a beginner-friendly philosophy (there's only one right way to do it)
2007-06-16T05:14:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	i thought c, c++, java where more famous than python...why python?
2007-06-16T05:14:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	you asked for "easy", not for "famous"
2007-06-16T05:15:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	python is easier than java?
2007-06-16T05:15:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	all those languages, in order "java", "c++", "c", require you to do far more micro-management and reinventing the wheel and less "getting things done"
2007-06-16T05:16:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	i did not understand my friend :(
2007-06-16T05:17:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	basically thus: the four languages we're talking about in order from easiest-to-use to hardest-to-use: python, java, c, c++
2007-06-16T05:18:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	aham. Glade..thats good.Glade supports java?
2007-06-16T05:19:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	since you're not listening anyway, no. Glade is for the GTK+ GUI toolkit. I think Java might have GTK+ bindings, but I'm not sure. Otherwise there's Eclipse, i've never used it but it's Java, and it might have a GUI creation tools.
2007-06-16T05:20:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	might be a good idea to go to a library or order some books on any language really (the books by O'Reilly are almost universally awesome), and use that to learn a language, then later learn how to build a GUI application. take your time, this is not something you learn overnight.
2007-06-16T05:20:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	ok friend. NetBeans (by sun) is the best java ide ive seen.
2007-06-16T05:21:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	i know how to build a gui app.but not as easy as vb.net :)
2007-06-16T05:21:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	and i think that IDEs in general are counter-productive. everyone's got their own opinion
2007-06-16T05:23:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	dude!!!in python you never declare a variable..thats AWFUL!
2007-06-16T05:23:00.000Z	preaction	BrightEyes`	no, you are not REQUIRED to declare a variable, and this is now getting very off-topic
2007-06-16T05:25:00.000Z	BrightEyes`	preaction	is python apps faster in execution than java apps?
