2010-10-14T10:26:00.000Z	shaheenery		correct
2010-10-14T10:28:00.000Z	shaheenery		when I "mount" the drive I can't write to it...when I "sudo mount" the drive I can't start a samba share
2010-10-14T10:28:00.000Z	shaheenery		no, I"m not testing across samba
2010-10-14T10:28:00.000Z	shaheenery		I am simpy in the directory in terminal
2010-10-14T10:29:00.000Z	shaheenery		just a folder
2010-10-14T10:29:00.000Z	shaheenery		http://pastie.org/1220009  this is my fstab line
2010-10-14T10:31:00.000Z	shaheenery		shaheenery@mallow:~$ ls -ld /media/crazy_bear/CrazyBear/
2010-10-14T10:31:00.000Z	shaheenery		drwxr-xr-x 14 shaheenery shaheenery 32768 2010-10-14 01:17 /media/crazy_bear/CrazyBear/
2010-10-14T10:32:00.000Z	shaheenery		?
2010-10-14T10:32:00.000Z	shaheenery		No, problem, but why is that?
2010-10-14T10:32:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	are you trying to mount a directory to another directory?
2010-10-14T10:34:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	why not create a directory under /mnt as root and mount it there?
2010-10-14T10:38:00.000Z	shaheenery	hatake_kakashi	same as mounting it in media, it can't change the folder permisisons to create it as a samba share
2010-10-14T10:40:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	not really, afaik HAL deals with mounting storage devices into /media and if you have a directory there with the same name as the one HAL is planning to mount it as (i.e. disk for example) HAL will create a new directory and mount the storage device there.. which is why it will get messy and thus not ideal.
2010-10-14T10:41:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	you'll need root permissions to do it.. I don't know of the graphical way, I deal with it via command line
2010-10-14T10:43:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	if you're going to mount it manually I suggest you to mount it inside /mnt instead.. there's no fancy automounting happening in /mnt and so you won't have a messy setup
2010-10-14T10:45:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	maybe you need to mount it with option for user to add/remove files, etc
2010-10-14T11:06:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	unusual, not that I've had that issue
2010-10-14T11:07:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	its the mount options, you have to mount it giving permissions to user
2010-10-14T11:08:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	try users
2010-10-14T11:12:00.000Z	shaheenery	hatake_kakashi	 no users does the same thing
2010-10-14T11:13:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	is the device mounted as ntfs? I think ntfs has issues even if you did specify mounting as users, you need to mount it under your id and group id specifying that in the mount
2010-10-14T11:14:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	shaheenery	is it FAT32?
