2007-01-21T08:09:00.000Z	brandonbl79		anyone have access to how to access a hard drive i don't have permissions to.  I'd like to understand the permissions more.
2007-01-21T08:09:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	what filesystem?
2007-01-21T08:09:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	how did you mount them?
2007-01-21T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	ok, pastebin your /etc/fstab
2007-01-21T08:11:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	open a Terminal and type 'gedit /etc/fstab' without quotes.  Then visit http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and make a post there with the contents of the file.  Then give us the url
2007-01-21T08:15:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	ok, then you need to use a umask when you mount them.  Change your fstab according to the "permissions" section in the following website:
2007-01-21T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	if you search for the first instance of "umask" you'll get to the aprt I am talking about btw.  It doesn't seem to be labelled as "permissions" like I thought
2007-01-21T08:19:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	edit your fstab then unmount and remount
2007-01-21T08:19:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	you want to be at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions#head-2a64a964ff8833576586c7216a1199f022c505a6
2007-01-21T08:20:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	enter your password
2007-01-21T08:22:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	it shouldn't be blank.  did you type the full command?
2007-01-21T08:22:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	ok close that.  Try:  gksudo "gedit /etc/fstab"
2007-01-21T08:24:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	what version of ubuntu by the way?
2007-01-21T08:25:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	find what out?
2007-01-21T08:26:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	k, you should consider upgrading soon.  breezy will reach end-of-life (no more security updates) in 3 months
2007-01-21T08:27:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	not really necessary.  It's up to you
2007-01-21T08:27:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	I would take care of the permissions first
2007-01-21T08:28:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	k, see the table on the wiki?  It lists filesystems and access permissions.  Find the ones you want, and change the options for your ntfs drives appropriately
2007-01-21T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	right
2007-01-21T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	only for the ntfs drives of course
2007-01-21T08:30:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	it changes the way ubuntu mounts the drive
2007-01-21T08:31:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	k, "umount" is the unmount command by the way.  And you reload your fstab afterwards with "mount -a"
2007-01-21T08:31:00.000Z	jrib	brandonbl79	take a look at "kino" and "pitivi"
