2006-07-25T08:29:00.000Z	ali		i can't log in as root in gnome but it's possible when I log in at a real terminal
2006-07-25T08:29:00.000Z	oskude	ali	you should not use root, thats what sudo is for
2006-07-25T08:30:00.000Z	ali	oskude	but im trying to use a administration tool
2006-07-25T08:31:00.000Z	oskude	ali	then run "sudo commandname"
2006-07-25T08:33:00.000Z	ali	oskude	The thing is that im trying to run the program "users and groups", and i dont know what it is called from the console,
2006-07-25T08:34:00.000Z	oskude	ali	and it should ask for a password, right ? its askin you password, if youre the user created at installation
2006-07-25T08:35:00.000Z	ali	oskude	yes, and im typing the right password, but I only get wrong password, but i know it works, beacouse i can login as root on a terminal with that password
2006-07-25T08:36:00.000Z	oskude	ali	hmm, you should be able to login as root anywhere...
2006-07-25T08:36:00.000Z	oskude	ali	*shouldnt
2006-07-25T08:37:00.000Z	oskude	ali	did you do somehow set a password for root ? you shouldnt...
2006-07-25T08:37:00.000Z	oskude	ali	try "sudo echo foo" in terminal and try your password, if the user is really the user that was created during installation, something is wrong
2006-07-25T08:38:00.000Z	oskude	ali	eh, i mean if it doesnt work, somwthing is wrog
2006-07-25T08:41:00.000Z	ali	oskude	I tried to type the root password but it doenst work, Should't I have a root passoword and a password for my user?
2006-07-25T08:42:00.000Z	oskude	ali	as i said, "sudo" ask your password (if youre the first user created, like at the installation)
2006-07-25T08:43:00.000Z	ali	oskude	I installed ubuntu in expert mode, and I was able to set a root password
2006-07-25T08:44:00.000Z	oskude	ali	well, then youre an expert, you should know ;) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
2006-07-25T08:45:00.000Z	ali	oskude	Hehe, im not used to not having the root password :) I was using slackware, but i wanted something that supports my amd64 processor
2006-07-25T08:45:00.000Z	oskude	ali	you login (in gnome) with the user (not root!) you created during installation, then click the program you want to use, and if it asks for a password, its the password of that user, not roots password
2006-07-25T08:51:00.000Z	ali	oskude	Does these administration tools use sudo when i try to run them?
2006-07-25T08:51:00.000Z	oskude	ali	yup, atleast from the gnome menus
2006-07-25T08:51:00.000Z	oskude	ali	if you run them from terminal, you need the command "sudo" in front of them
2006-07-25T08:52:00.000Z	ali	oskude	yeah I know, but thanks :)
2006-07-25T08:58:00.000Z	oskude	ali	better is relative... but ubuntu is "better" for first time users (atm)
