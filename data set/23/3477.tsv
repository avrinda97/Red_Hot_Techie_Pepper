2008-04-09T02:26:00.000Z	Simpl3x		Can someone please help me, my /boot seems to have been completely erased
2008-04-09T02:27:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	Are you sure it's mounted?
2008-04-09T02:27:00.000Z	Simpl3x		yes, it's mounted, and I can see the files in there, but there is no grub directory
2008-04-09T02:28:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	Oh.  That's not quite so complete as I imagined, but it is quite odd.
2008-04-09T02:28:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	Were you doing anything in there that might have caused it?
2008-04-09T02:29:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	yea, I know I updated to the lates .15 kernel but when I rebooted it had removed everything from menu.lst so I think it did an imcomplete install of the new kernel or something
2008-04-09T02:29:00.000Z	frogduster		hrm..
2008-04-09T02:29:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	and the menu.lst~ was the same
2008-04-09T02:31:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	Ah.  I'd recommend backing up the menu.lst~, then copying it to menu.lst, then: Boot off of an older kernel, remove the latest kernel (you can check what your most recent is in synaptic), and then reinstall your latest kernel.
2008-04-09T02:31:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	let me re-phrase that. Both menu.lst and menu.lst~ are the same, as in blank
2008-04-09T02:31:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	ah.
2008-04-09T02:32:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	Run "sudo update-grub" from the command line.
2008-04-09T02:32:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	but it's a moot point now either way because the grub directory is no longer there so there is no grub whatsoever in stalled
2008-04-09T02:33:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	I think that worked
2008-04-09T02:33:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	wait...wait...no it didn't
2008-04-09T02:33:00.000Z	Simpl3x		there is still no /grub in there
2008-04-09T02:34:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	but I'm going to reboot anyway and see what happens because I do see some things in there that might work
2008-04-09T02:34:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	hrm.
2008-04-09T02:34:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	Just for safety's sake, you should probably run "sudo update-grub" and see if it gives you errors.
2008-04-09T02:35:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	I did that and it said that there was no menu.lst found, so I told it to generate one
2008-04-09T02:35:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	 *nod*
2008-04-09T02:36:00.000Z	frogduster	Simpl3x	Should work, then, if there were no more errors.
2008-04-09T02:36:00.000Z	Simpl3x	frogduster	then I'll brb hopefully
