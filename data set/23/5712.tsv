2007-11-17T03:09:00.000Z	Xklark		can anyone help? I can't install samba through apt-get - the package is getting a 404 error
2007-11-17T03:09:00.000Z	Xklark		Err http://security.ubuntu.com gutsy-security/main samba 3.0.26a-1ubuntu2.1 403 Forbidden
2007-11-17T03:10:00.000Z	Xklark		do i have to compile the source myself?
2007-11-17T03:10:00.000Z	Xklark		ill try
2007-11-17T03:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	you gan get it from mirrors.kernel.org, but you have to fix the dependency errors by hand
2007-11-17T03:14:00.000Z	Xklark	nickrud	I can't find the samba package on that mirror site you gave me - what would it be under?
2007-11-17T03:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	a sec
2007-11-17T03:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	s/kernel.com/kernel.org/
2007-11-17T03:17:00.000Z	Xklark	nickrud	thanks
2007-11-17T03:18:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	same with security.ubuntu.com, that's mirrors.kernel.org as well
2007-11-17T03:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	you have an ubuntu source listed somewhere ... and I think you should read what nsteeves just posted if you need samba functionality now
2007-11-17T03:42:00.000Z	Xklark	nickrud	should i just wait till they fix it? then try it later?
2007-11-17T03:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	I'd wait till it was fixed; you could also take erUSUL 's advice and comment out security for now
2007-11-17T03:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	you need to do update (reload?) first
2007-11-17T03:47:00.000Z	Xklark	nickrud	what? sorry im new to ubuntu :(
2007-11-17T03:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	the reload button will update your sources, removing the security sources.
2007-11-17T03:49:00.000Z	Xklark	nickrud	i have no idea what reload button your talking about
2007-11-17T03:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	on synaptic, left button below the menu bar
2007-11-17T03:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	mark all upgrades, then apply
2007-11-17T03:51:00.000Z	Xklark	nickrud	i did that, still getting the same error
2007-11-17T03:52:00.000Z	Xklark	nickrud	ill leave you alone - i can ask box1 if you want
2007-11-17T03:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	then you haven't disabled the security source yet, settings->repositories, updates tab, uncheck important security updates
2007-11-17T03:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Xklark	then reload, mark for upgrades, and apply
