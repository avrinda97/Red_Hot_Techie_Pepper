2008-03-27T23:44:00.000Z	styrman		is there a command to check if i got conflicting packages installed?
2008-03-27T23:45:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	hm, if  apt-get -f install completes successfuly, you don't have conflicting _pacakges_
2008-03-27T23:46:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	it completed succesfully, thing is I installed totem-xine and i think it brought with it alot of dependancy packages, 3d driver libs, is there a way to see dependancies of a package?
2008-03-27T23:47:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	yes. apt-cache depends totem-xine
2008-03-27T23:48:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	yeah i've got a conflict there, it installed 3d packages for me that messed up somewhere, for a game of mine i played
2008-03-27T23:48:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	thats my only idea what it could been.. is there somehow i can reinstall now totem-gstreamer and remove all totem-xine installed?
2008-03-27T23:48:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	totem-xine doesn't depend on 3d stuff, but it does depend on some sound stuff
2008-03-27T23:49:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	  install totem-gstreamer, that will remove-totem-xine. then run apt-cache autoremove to get rid of the rest
2008-03-27T23:49:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	hm... its the only thing i can think of, yesterday my game worked fine, since yesterday i only messed with two things, w32codecs and totem-xine.. i've uninstalled the codecs already and.. want to get rid of all packages xine got me
2008-03-27T23:49:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	ok thanks
2008-03-27T23:50:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	no such command as autoremove? =)
2008-03-27T23:51:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	doh.   apt-get autoremove . I do type that by rote myself often ;)
2008-03-27T23:52:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	it removed 0, thing is i also tried reinstalling the graphic driver to fix my game problem, when i reinstalled Xgl it removed 10 packages
2008-03-27T23:53:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	that is very strange, xserver-xgl removing packages. what did it remove?
2008-03-27T23:53:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	i dont know :) is there a log? =)
2008-03-27T23:53:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	i've rebooted since
2008-03-27T23:53:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	yes, /var/log/dpkg.log
2008-03-27T23:55:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	that log is such a mess, i can't see what packages it removed can i paste it for you and you look? =)
2008-03-27T23:55:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	at the end of the file is that relevant stuff. Just do a search in there for xserver-xgl, you'll see the rest after it
2008-03-27T23:56:00.000Z	nikrud	styrman	mainly, I'm only around for a couple more minutes ;)
2008-03-27T23:56:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	http://paste.stgraber.org/
2008-03-27T23:56:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	ah
2008-03-27T23:57:00.000Z	styrman	nikrud	2008-03-27 20:39:09 remove libdirectfb-extra 0.9.25.1-6ubuntu3 0.9.25.1-6ubuntu3 stuff like that it removed
