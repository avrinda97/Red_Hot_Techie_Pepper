2006-01-11T17:26:00.000Z	joshua		switched to ubuntu from fedora4 tonidh im stuck in 640x400 any help?
2006-01-11T17:27:00.000Z	joshua		can anyone see my posts?
2006-01-11T17:27:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	no
2006-01-11T17:44:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	close all open windows, open a terminal and run the command from there
2006-01-11T17:48:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	not a problem ... sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-01-11T17:51:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	might be worth a reboot and doing it from a console rather than X
2006-01-11T17:54:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	you have virtual screens on all the F keys with F7 running the X screen by default
2006-01-11T17:55:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	well technically it just takes you to that virtual console that happens to be running x
2006-01-11T17:58:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	lol
2006-01-11T06:00:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	the console driver treats each F key as a seperate login, i.e. as if you've logged in from multiple different machines, so all the sessions are independant from each other so you can leave something running on one screen and go to another to do something else
2006-01-11T06:00:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	or you can just use X and do it all on one screen :-)
2006-01-11T06:02:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	yes but idependant from each other, the virtual desktops in X are just an extention of your existing session, if you log out they all die
2006-01-11T06:02:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	go for it
2006-01-11T06:04:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	reboot just to make sure everything is killed off
2006-01-11T06:11:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	apt-get install xserver-xorg ?
2006-01-11T06:20:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	get the xserver package installed
2006-01-11T06:30:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	startx -- :1
2006-01-11T06:34:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	hmmm I presume that your xorg.conf has got multiple modlines in? can try changing the defaultDepth to 16 from 24 as that sometimes helps
2006-01-11T06:37:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	whats weird?
2006-01-11T06:39:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	want to mail to me at nics@sarginson.com I can take a quick look before I have to go
2006-01-11T07:22:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	I'm back for a bit now, you want to mail me your xorg.conf file
2006-01-11T07:26:00.000Z	nics__	joshua	you could try making sure that only 1024x768 is selected when you get the option, i.e. the only one with an 'x' against it, then when its finished edit the xorg.conf and make sure that the defaultdepth is set to 16, what card and and spec is it you are using?
