2006-10-25T15:17:00.000Z	Killerkiwi		how do i chmod for a specific user ie john
2006-10-25T15:17:00.000Z	Killerkiwi		?
2006-10-25T15:18:00.000Z	Killerkiwi		anyone?
2006-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	what do you mean? do you want a file readable/writable by user "john" only?
2006-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	Killerkiwi	yprm	yes i want to +rw him
2006-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	and no other users or group?
2006-10-25T15:20:00.000Z	Killerkiwi	yprm	I want the rest to stay as is
2006-10-25T15:20:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	who is the file owner?
2006-10-25T15:20:00.000Z	Killerkiwi	yprm	 root
2006-10-25T15:22:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	two possible solutions: 1. chown the file to john (make john the owner) and chmod 600 it, or: 2. chgrp the file to a group only john belongs to and chmod 660 it.
2006-10-25T15:22:00.000Z	Killerkiwi		yprm.... seems like the should be an easier way...
2006-10-25T15:23:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	no. permission bits in unix work like that. you can only set permissions for the owner of a file, the group of a file, and all others
2006-10-25T15:24:00.000Z	Killerkiwi	yprm	Well I got a nautilus action for grant read/write to all anyway that might be enough for now
2006-10-25T15:24:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	i don't use gui for that. i prefer command line, it's more generic.
2006-10-25T15:25:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	btw, which file is it?
2006-10-25T15:26:00.000Z	Killerkiwi	yprm	I was trying to edit the new edgy GDM background to be black ';)
2006-10-25T15:27:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	and why don't you use sudo gedit ... for that?
2006-10-25T15:27:00.000Z	Killerkiwi	yprm	I just added that as well "Open with sudo" gksu gnome-open %W
2006-10-25T15:27:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	making a systemwide config file world-writable is a bad idea
2006-10-25T15:28:00.000Z	Killerkiwi		I know thats why I wanted to make it for one user
2006-10-25T15:29:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	then you can only solve it with setting a different owner or group for the file
2006-10-25T15:29:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	but if you edit the file with sudo you dont need that
2006-10-25T15:30:00.000Z	yprm	Killerkiwi	because commands executed by sudo run with root privileges
