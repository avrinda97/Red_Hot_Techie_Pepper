2009-09-01T15:56:00.000Z	chuuk		anyone here have any experience with tiling window mangers?
2009-09-01T15:57:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	ye, sure...
2009-09-01T15:57:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	are you using the "window" key and enter?
2009-09-01T15:59:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	but apparently the keybinding for Mod4+Enter seems to conflict with something else
2009-09-01T15:59:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	hm... ye, well, it should work then. Problem is, awesome has got a difficult "for experts" lua based configuration with little documentation. Most documentation they have is still for awesome 2. You should probably contact their irc channel directly.
2009-09-01T16:00:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	other than that... wmii is also more or less the same if you don't need multi-screen support
2009-09-01T16:01:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	anything involving the Return key doesn't work for me
2009-09-01T16:01:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	in fact it it is more powerful in the default configuration, if you don't want to bother with customization and don't mind using alt instead of the window key. I'm sticking to it until awesome 3 is more well documented, even though I can do basic lua.
2009-09-01T16:02:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	I've tried wmii, xmonad
2009-09-01T16:02:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	Ah, now that's odd.
2009-09-01T16:02:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	do you know how to change the keybindings on wmii?
2009-09-01T16:04:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	"xev" may help you to debug what xorg registers when you hit these buttons...and yes, changing keyboard mappings on wmii is slightly easier.
2009-09-01T16:04:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	going to give it a try now, cheers for the help so far
2009-09-01T16:07:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	shortcuts are in /etc/wmii-3.5/wmiirc I think
2009-09-01T16:08:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	np, good luck
2009-09-01T16:16:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	so, something came up
2009-09-01T16:17:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	it turns out that after i open any app that requires GNOME (?) such as xChat, Firefox etc, the keybinding (Mod4+Enter) begins to work... :S
2009-09-01T16:17:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	also, the terminal that it opens isn't an xterm but a gnome-terminal
2009-09-01T16:20:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	sounds a bit like the TERM variable wouldn't be set until then...
2009-09-01T16:21:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	what happens if you, say, export TERM="xterm" ? :)
2009-09-01T16:21:00.000Z	Radtoo	chuuk	(hm... not sure if that works if its a child console tho.. guess its best to set it up before even xorg starts or something)
2009-09-01T16:22:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	That's what I'm thinking of doing...going to boot into GNOME and muck around with some settings for a bit
2009-09-01T16:22:00.000Z	chuuk	Radtoo	brb, thanks again
