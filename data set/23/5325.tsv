2007-05-01T07:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	i thought thats what i needed to do, but i don't know the command
2007-05-01T07:07:00.000Z	mneptok	IndyGunFreak	chown + chmod
2007-05-01T07:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	ok, so chown + chmod device?
2007-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	could you explain that command i need a little better?..

2007-05-01T07:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	that command is working, as i can write to the drive now, but i can't delete anything off the drive
2007-06-06T07:19:00.000Z	mneptok	IndyGunFreak	Opera 9.02 is in the commercial repo
2007-06-06T07:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	but not for Ubuntu 5.10
2007-06-06T07:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	lol, ask paddy
2007-06-06T07:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	but his laptop probably would run better with Xubuntu.
2007-06-06T07:21:00.000Z	mneptok	IndyGunFreak	agreed
2007-06-06T07:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	lol, he can't get online

2007-12-08T07:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	i could care less, i just think that was being a bit anal.
2008-06-10T07:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mneptok	that was slightly subtle.
2008-06-10T07:28:00.000Z	mneptok	IndyGunFreak	that's why my nickname is "The Flying Mallet"
