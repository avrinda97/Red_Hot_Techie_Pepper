2006-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	SurfnKid		how can i remote login to another linux box
2006-06-17T13:38:00.000Z	SurfnKid		no gui
2006-06-17T13:39:00.000Z	ProN00b	SurfnKid	you need ssh
2006-06-17T13:39:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	ah thats what i was lookin for
2006-06-17T13:39:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	do i have to enable that
2006-06-17T13:40:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	 hehe thats what i thought
2006-06-17T13:40:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	i knew it was some telnet type but didnt know what
2006-06-17T13:40:00.000Z	ProN00b	SurfnKid	well, you need to install sshd on the machine you want to access and then you can access it with a ssh client
2006-06-17T13:41:00.000Z	ProN00b	SurfnKid	ssh is like telnet, but its unsniffable
2006-06-17T13:41:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	ok cool, do i just look for the pkg and install it
2006-06-17T13:41:00.000Z	ProN00b	SurfnKid	apt-get install sshd ssh
2006-06-17T13:42:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	k
2006-06-17T13:53:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	I got the ssh server on one machine and I can login, but what would the password be? do i set it on the server. where's the settings to enter it
2006-06-17T13:54:00.000Z	ProN00b	SurfnKid	you log into it with a normal username and password of the box
2006-06-17T13:55:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	do I have to have ssh on the client too
2006-06-17T13:56:00.000Z	ProN00b	SurfnKid	yes, you need an ssh client (putty is used mostly on windows (single exe, no install))
2006-06-17T13:56:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	ok so most clients are preinstalled so then i just need to figure out what password is on the server box, it doesnt ask for a username, just password
2006-06-17T13:57:00.000Z	ProN00b	SurfnKid	with the linux client you do it like ssh username@hostname/ip
2006-06-17T13:57:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	ok
2006-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	doesnt let me, (ssh klormexor@H5N1/10.0.0.2) Name or service not known
2006-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	i got it
2006-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	its the server user @ server hostname/ip
2006-06-17T14:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ProN00b	thx
