2006-01-19T17:02:00.000Z	Sh4d0x		plz plz plz help me out
2006-01-19T17:02:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	you messed with xorg.conf?
2006-01-19T17:04:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	restore the backup
2006-01-19T17:04:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	like cp the backup file name to the original file name
2006-01-19T17:05:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	I asume you can get a console login
2006-01-19T17:05:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	you can find it where you put it when you made it
2006-01-19T17:06:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	well look in /etc/X11/ I would guess
2006-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	mwe	it worked only "problem" is that it now takes a bit longer to load my dekstop (10-15sec)
2006-01-19T07:20:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	what's that?
2006-01-19T07:20:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	now xorg.conf?
2006-01-19T07:21:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	mwe	yup it uses xorg.conf (the correct one)when booting, but when i enter my account it takes a few seconds longer to load my desktop themes etc
2006-01-19T07:22:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	ok
2006-01-19T07:23:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	mwe	but i got the feeling the reconfige created some more files whitin the X11 folder which are used when booting, could that be possible?
2006-01-19T07:23:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	no X files are used when booting. only when gdm starts
2006-01-19T07:24:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	and it should touch anything other than xorg.conf
2006-01-19T07:24:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	mwe	ok thnx, then i can try a bit further on my tv out
2006-01-19T07:25:00.000Z	mwe	Sh4d0x	again back it up before messign with it
2006-01-19T07:27:00.000Z	Sh4d0x	mwe	uhu i have taken a backup from the original file, atm i have only add twinview at the xorg.conf and that works fine, but i want to use my desktop when playing a movie on tv, that's what need to be changed, i also wrote your backup way down in case xserver should crash again :)
