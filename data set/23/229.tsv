2012-07-12T19:00:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		how do i open a terminal in ubuntu 12.04 from a shortcut
2012-07-12T19:00:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		i've installed a pieace of software that starts with d and it enables you to install the lamp server
2012-07-12T19:00:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		and i unchecked ubuntu desktop
2012-07-12T19:01:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		now it has erased all desktop functionality
2012-07-12T19:01:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		anyone?
2012-07-12T19:02:00.000Z	a5m0	Wiz_KeeD	so you're not actually looking for a way to start terminal but a way to restart gnome/unity?
2012-07-12T19:02:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		i guess
2012-07-12T19:02:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		idk
2012-07-12T19:04:00.000Z	a5m0	Wiz_KeeD	perhaps sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2012-07-12T19:05:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		now that it has restarted it doesn't boot anymore
2012-07-12T19:06:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD	a5m0	it doesn't boot now
2012-07-12T19:06:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		just sits at the login screen
2012-07-12T19:06:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		i mean boot screen
2012-07-12T19:06:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		with blank text
2012-07-12T19:07:00.000Z	a5m0	Wiz_KeeD	no command prompt?
2012-07-12T19:08:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD	a5m0	not really just stops at unable to enumarte usb device on port 5
2012-07-12T19:08:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		and nothing else happens
2012-07-12T19:08:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		and a few ok's along the way
2012-07-12T19:08:00.000Z	a5m0		that sounds like a new issue
2012-07-12T19:08:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD		i just want access to a terminal
2012-07-12T19:09:00.000Z	a5m0	Wiz_KeeD	you said earlier you needed gnome back, do you know the difference between cli and gui?
2012-07-12T19:09:00.000Z	Wiz_KeeD	a5m0	i do, but right now i cannot access any
