2006-04-14T10:08:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	how did you install wpa... through apt?  or source?
2006-04-14T10:09:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	yeah...
2006-04-14T10:10:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	so what wireless security scheme you using?  wpa-psk?  or something with 802.1x?
2006-04-14T10:12:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	so yer gonna need wpasupplicant... unles ya dumb the ap down to wep...
2006-04-14T10:16:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	type in iwconfig....  what device is yer wireless card?  eth1?
2006-04-14T10:27:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	which AP is yours?
2006-04-14T10:28:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	that would be appropriate... deactivate your wired first...  then wireless
2006-04-14T10:32:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	paste the following output when you activate wireless  (1) iwconfig (2) ifconfig (3) route -n (4) cat /etc/resolv.conf
2006-04-14T10:36:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	everything looks fantastic...  you're associated...  and have an IP with appropriate bcast and netmnask... and routing looks good...
2006-04-14T10:42:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	what device is 192.168.2.1 ?  is that the access point?  or another router?
2006-04-14T10:44:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	do this... when you bring down the wired network... instead of activating wireless from the GUI... try this in order... and paste all results...   (1) sudo ifdown eth0 (2) sudo ifup eth0
2006-04-14T10:49:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	you're getting a valid ip from the ap... but there's something up with the udp packets.... I've seen this before... but it had not prevented traffic flow...  brb
2006-04-14T10:51:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	solan	while I look somethin up... when wireless is up...    "dig @192.168.2.1 www.yahoo.com"
