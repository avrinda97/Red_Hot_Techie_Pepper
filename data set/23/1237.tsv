2010-10-11T09:48:00.000Z	rifter	deryl	mine is more like 800 GB :D
2010-10-11T09:48:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ i've only a 250GB 5400RPM drive. split evenly between windows (ok so i still like to game), and ubuntu
2010-10-11T09:49:00.000Z	rifter	deryl	yeah .. I am having good luck with wine but some games still work better with windows.. for instance punkbuster stuff :P
2010-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ yeah. I don't like wine when I have a legal and working copy of Windows 7 as well. (This laptop is still under warranty). so I just split the drive.
2010-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ when I get bug eyed from ruby and rails, i reboot to windows and take it out on someone's ass :)
2010-10-11T09:50:00.000Z	rifter	deryl	me neither.. my var is 10GB but on anotehr machine I had to symlink that directory to somewhere bigger
2010-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	rifter	deryl	thank you for your service  then
2010-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ ehh, its my job. just like some folks are mechanics, others florists. I'm a soldier. it's what i do.
2010-10-11T09:52:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ but.. you're welcome
2010-10-11T09:54:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ you gimme back my icon? ;)
2010-10-11T09:55:00.000Z	rifter	deryl	maybe it was taking awhile to load? I missed your initial question on that
2010-10-11T09:55:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ oh. it disappeared on me, left the blank spot like a spacer but the same color as the bacground of the taskbar. put the mouse over the spot and the clipboard popup would show but the main icon was gone
2010-10-11T09:56:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ then just now out of the blue 9oh i'd say 45 minutes later) it showed back up. weird stuff
2010-10-11T09:57:00.000Z	rifter	deryl	yeah I run into that with apps in the notification area from time to time
2010-10-11T09:57:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ yeah. not sure what the issue is, but i've a far bigger issue to rigure out that I just have no clue wth to do anything about
2010-10-11T09:58:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ i have an ati radeon card in this laptop. for some reason kdm doesn't completely reset X when you log out and it corrupts my video. works perfect under gdm, just not kdm. did it under 10.04 too
2010-10-11T09:59:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ hehe solve that one, you come to Port Elgin Ontario canada, i'll get you drunk and buy you lunch :)
2010-10-11T09:59:00.000Z	rifter	deryl	oh I haven't been to that part of canada yet I would like to sometime
2010-10-11T10:00:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ hehe. I'm slightly north by northwest from TO :)
2010-10-11T10:01:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ but to add to the mix.. I'm using the fglrx kernel module for the ati cards. I'm getting a sneaking suspicion that what happens is gdm FULLY resets the X server as in completely kills itself and X and then restarts itself so it fully resets the card. I'm thinking kdm doesn't
2010-10-11T10:02:00.000Z	deryl	rifter	~ i can't prove it beyond the differences in how gdm and kdm reset, but thats my suspicion from watching the screen and how the system reacts
