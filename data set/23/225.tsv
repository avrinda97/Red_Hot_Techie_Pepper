2012-08-30T03:29:00.000Z	Super_Dog		Anybody done an upgrade from 10.04 LTS to 12.04.1 LTS on Ubuntu?  Just showed up as a viable upgrade option in the last week or so.
2012-08-30T03:31:00.000Z	Super_Dog		What mailing list are you talking about?
2012-08-30T03:31:00.000Z	Super_Dog		You have a URL for that?
2012-08-30T03:31:00.000Z	Super_Dog		I'm on the forums and stuff.  Didn't know they had a "mailing list"...
2012-08-30T03:32:00.000Z	Super_Dog		(Super_Dog has limited brain bandwidth... :-)
2012-08-30T03:34:00.000Z	Super_Dog		Holy crap batman....  That's a lot of lists.
2012-08-30T03:34:00.000Z	Chaser	Super_Dog	I did. It was fine except for some pop up dialog boxes with alien characters during the upgrade. I hit what I thought was OK button and it went on.
2012-08-30T03:35:00.000Z	Super_Dog		Chaser... Do you have a LAMP installation on your desktop?
2012-08-30T03:35:00.000Z	Chaser	Super_Dog	sorry nope
2012-08-30T03:35:00.000Z	Super_Dog		Particularly interested in how 10.04 to 12.04 upgrade will go with LAMP.
2012-08-30T03:36:00.000Z	Super_Dog		Guess I better clone this sucker just in case the worst happens before I try the upgrade.
2012-08-30T03:36:00.000Z	Chaser	Super_Dog	thats a good idea even if otherwise
2012-08-30T03:37:00.000Z	Super_Dog	Chaser	 But your 10.04LTS to 12.04.1 LTS upgrade went smoothly other than some weird alien characters?
2012-08-30T03:37:00.000Z	Chaser		yup !
2012-08-30T03:37:00.000Z	Super_Dog	Chaser	You running 12.04 LTS right now with satisfactory upgrade?  You didn't have to re-install from scratch.
2012-08-30T03:39:00.000Z	Chaser	Super_Dog	thats correct. Its a desktop but have been using it as build machine.
2012-08-30T03:39:00.000Z	Super_Dog		Cool... Running 12.04 LTS on some other machines over here but I know that the support runs out in April so I want to bite the bullet and just go for it.
2012-08-30T03:40:00.000Z	Super_Dog		All the other machines I'm running with 12.04 were virgin drive installs and not upgrades.
2012-08-30T03:40:00.000Z	Chaser		I am sticking to 10.04 till support ends for my laptop though.
2012-08-30T03:41:00.000Z	Super_Dog		I actually am running 12.04 on my laptop and upgraded through the whole cycle - 10.04 -->11.04 -->11.10 --> 12.04.
2012-08-30T03:41:00.000Z	Super_Dog		I guess I just got lucky with that one.
2012-08-30T03:42:00.000Z	Super_Dog		The desktop I'm running has a sweet install of AjaxPlorer with a LAMP stack and that's why I've been hesitant to mess with it until the 12.04 LTS upgrade path was released to the public.
2012-08-30T03:42:00.000Z	Chaser	Super_Dog	I remember having to tweak xchat2 profile when I upgraded from 8.04 -> 10.04 on my laptop but other than that it was smooth as far as I can remember.
