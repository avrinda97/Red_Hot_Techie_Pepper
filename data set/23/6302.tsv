2006-05-24T12:57:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		Can someone tell me why, after installing a software app with Synaptic I cannot see it in the Applications menu, but I can see it in the Applications Configuration Menu?
2006-05-24T12:57:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		the Applications Menu Editor i mean
2006-05-24T12:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	just tick the box then
2006-05-24T12:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	the powers that  be like to hide things they think are too geeky for Ubuntites ;)
2006-05-24T12:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	like terminals ;)
2006-05-24T13:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	sometimes a "killall gnome-panel" makes them appear
2006-05-24T13:00:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	thoreauputic	the kill all won't bust my setup will it?
2006-05-24T13:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	no, gnome-panel respawns
2006-05-24T13:01:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	thoreauputic	thanks
2006-05-24T13:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	killall foo means "kill all processes of the foo program" - but gnome-panel resurrects itself :)
2006-05-24T13:03:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	thoreauputic	cool man. Tried that and it has worked for some things like Scribus that was not showing before. Still no sign of 3D Chess though. But thanks for that little gem. So many things to remember with Linux :-)
2006-05-24T13:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	dpkg -L <packagename> | grep bin
2006-05-24T13:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	that usually finds a binary
2006-05-24T13:07:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	thoreauputic	that rocks! I'm really starting to see why command line so good. It is in usr/share
2006-05-24T13:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	:)
2006-05-24T13:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	 sudo apt-get install apt-howto && apt-howto
2006-05-24T13:08:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	thoreauputic	  It is in usr/lib/menu actually - reading the wrong bit :-)
2006-05-24T13:08:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	thoreauputic	what will that do?
2006-05-24T13:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	give you an apt-get howto and open it in your browser :)
2006-05-24T13:09:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	thoreauputic	how the hell do you guys remember all that?
2006-05-24T13:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	it's like playing pool - if you waste enough of yourlife doing it you get to know how a bit
2006-05-24T13:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Gizmo_The_Great	enjoy :)
