2007-07-10T11:20:00.000Z	davidspart_		well basically, my ubuntu install can no longer connect to my wireless network. i've tried running from the latest LIVE cd iso and it has the same problem. the system can detect that the wireless is there, as it knows when the name changes, but it cant get an ip address or any other ninformation. i also think it gets stuck on validating the security key, as when i add or remove a security...

2007-07-10T11:23:00.000Z	phaidros7	davidspart_	did you change something on the access point or wireless router?

2007-07-10T11:26:00.000Z	phaidros7	davidspart_	when you try dhclient as root (or something like sudo dhlient) - what error appears?
2007-07-10T11:32:00.000Z	phaidros7	davidspart_	that looks good. so maybe the wep or wpa key is missing?
2007-07-10T11:33:00.000Z	phaidros7	davidspart_	oh. looks not so god. mom...
2007-07-10T11:35:00.000Z	phaidros7	davidspart_	when you did the dhcielnt, maybe you should log out of gnome, say sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart and log in agagin
