2006-10-13T06:31:00.000Z	nba		anybody who read my problem?
2006-10-13T06:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	You should just be able to put the cd in the drive and it should auto mount it.
2006-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	does the cdrom drive work with other cds?
2006-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	is there other way of mounting the cd?
2006-10-13T06:34:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	yes
2006-10-13T06:34:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	you can mount it manually with a sudo mount /dev/locationofdevice  <options>
2006-10-13T06:35:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	do you know how the cd drive is hooked up to your machine i.e. /hda  /hdb  etc...
2006-10-13T06:35:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	can u give me the exact command coz i'm  a newbie to linux
2006-10-13T06:36:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	well do you know how to use pastebin?
2006-10-13T06:36:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	nope
2006-10-13T06:36:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	see if the drive shows up in System > Administrations > Disks  You should be able to mount it in there I believe
2006-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	yes, it shows up
2006-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	is there an option to mount it in there?
2006-10-13T06:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	You'll have to forgive me i'm in edgy so my screen is completely different
2006-10-13T06:38:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	no, there's no option
2006-10-13T06:38:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	it's ok
2006-10-13T06:40:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	error says "mount:block device /dev/hdb is write protected, mounting read only;  mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb, missing codepage or other error in some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg l tail or so
2006-10-13T06:40:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	thats when you try to mount it?
2006-10-13T06:40:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	yes
2006-10-13T06:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	did you try just playing the cd because technically you don't need to mount an audio cd to play it.
2006-10-13T06:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	like with xmms or rhythmbox
2006-10-13T06:43:00.000Z	nba	chuckyp	the cd doesn't load when i try the xmms
2006-10-13T06:43:00.000Z	chuckyp	nba	i dunno perhaps someone else will know more.
