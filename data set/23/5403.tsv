2007-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	brunner		There's no hda in /dev when I boot from the ubuntu live cd
2007-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	brunner		never mind. I didn't realize my laptop uses SATA
2007-07-08T14:17:00.000Z	brunner		if I have two partitions on my hard drive, one being NTFS and the other ext3, an sda2 should exist in /dev, right?
2007-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	brunner		if I have two partitions on my hard drive, I should see sda, sda1, and sda2, right?
2007-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	Yep
2007-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	if both are active
2007-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	I only have sda and sda1, could that be because sda is my cd-rom?
2007-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	is your cdrom sata?
2007-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	this is a laptop. I've never opened it up.
2007-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	what are you trying to do exactly, add a windows partition to view?
2007-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	word
2007-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	I just installed ubuntu for the first time on a second partition, and I'm trying to install a bootloader so I can use it
2007-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	I'm currently booted off of a live cd
2007-07-08T14:22:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	Why are you trying to find partitions?
2007-07-08T14:22:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	I want to mount the partition ubuntu is installed on so I can find /boot/grub/stage1
2007-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	make a folder
2007-07-08T14:24:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	make a folder then type, "sudo mount /dev/sda1 /folder"
2007-07-08T14:24:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	well I'm puzzled as to why I only have sda1 and no sda2 when I have two partitions
2007-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	why do you think you have two partitions
2007-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	because I'm on crack. I'll see you guys later. thanks very much for your help. I just realized what happened.
2007-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	 :D
2007-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	ax1s	brunner	 GL dood ;] 
2007-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	brunner	ax1s	thanks =]
