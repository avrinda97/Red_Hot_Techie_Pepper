2010-03-15T11:30:00.000Z	saurabh	ortsvorsteher	nope. Seems like the driver is not getting loaded.. cause it does show in my system > administration > hardware drivers.. but its not activated and nothing happens even if i click on activate
2010-03-15T11:30:00.000Z	saurabh	ortsvorsteher	I thought adding wl to /etc/modules would do it
2010-03-15T11:31:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	saurabh	yes, this will be a part of the work...
2010-03-15T11:32:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	saurabh	my wlan devices works in ubuntu 8.04 and i dont know you hardware details, so i cannot help. sorry. i also followed the procedure and it worked for me
