2005-09-25T13:15:00.000Z	freddy_s		or anyone else
2005-09-25T13:16:00.000Z	freddy_s		i've found the codecs I need at mplayer homepage, but i don't know how to install them
2005-09-25T13:17:00.000Z	freddy_s		and the ubuntu guide instructions won't let me install w32codecs
2005-09-25T13:17:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	hoary or breezy?
2005-09-25T13:18:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	grab the codecs from mplayerhq.hu...
2005-09-25T13:19:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	mplayerhq.hu
2005-09-25T13:20:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	/usr/lib/win32/
2005-09-25T13:21:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	the win32 folder isn't there, how do i create it?
2005-09-25T13:21:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	sudo mkdir /usr/lib/win32/
2005-09-25T13:22:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	so i guess i will have to chmod 770 /usr/lib/win32 as well?
2005-09-25T13:23:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	no, you unpack the tarball and move the files in there as root...
2005-09-25T13:30:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	okay great, thanks. but everything isn't working, is that package really everything in w32codecs? because when i had w32codecs on another install  i could view those i can't now
2005-09-25T13:31:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	you may have luck with the w32codecs package on seveas.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-25T13:32:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	i need to enter username and password. arent those for breezy?
2005-09-25T13:34:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
2005-09-25T13:35:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	okay
2005-09-25T13:37:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	apokryphos: i installed it now, great thx :)
2005-09-25T13:39:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	apokryphos: i still can't play the files though, do you need to register the codecs before it works? I saw some command with register in ubuntu guide about codecs
2005-09-25T13:39:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	which player?
2005-09-25T13:40:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	xine, totem, mplayer :P preferably mplayer i heard it's the best
2005-09-25T13:40:00.000Z	Seveas	freddy_s	mplayer should pick them up automagically
2005-09-25T13:42:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	apokryphos: I killed MPlayer, and the other media players. tried to play the videos, *.mov *.wmv *.avi
2005-09-25T13:43:00.000Z	freddy_s	Seveas	apokryphos: but no luck, it still doesn't work, xine only plays sound, and shows some messed up graphics,Mplayer hangs, and totem shuts down immediately
