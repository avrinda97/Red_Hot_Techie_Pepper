2009-10-14T04:11:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	then Im not sure why it wasnt working X_X
2009-10-14T04:07:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	are you sure you stated your question correctly?
2009-10-14T04:08:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	well I have a proxy server set up on my home computer and have a port forwarded with it so I can connect through it from my laptop but it didnt work today and Im wondering if that is because my computer was "Locked"
2009-10-14T04:09:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	which computer, the server that port is forwarded to, or the laptop you were on?
2009-10-14T04:09:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	the computer that the server is running from was locked
2009-10-14T04:11:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	yes, i leave my FTP/VNC/SSH server locked all the time, i even reboot it remotely and can log back in remotely without logging in locally on the server
2009-10-14T04:12:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	could my school's network have Proxy connecting blocked even though firefox said "This port is refusing connections"
2009-10-14T04:13:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	i have my own IRC channel that i leave a nick used on that box logged into constantly so i know when it's up ordown while i'm at work
2009-10-14T04:15:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	Is it possible for a network to block users from accessing a proxy server from their web brouwser
2009-10-14T04:19:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	thats kinda ... open-ended, because i know how things work i dont know for sure if you are sure of the question you're trying to ask,,, better to ask in ##networking
2009-10-14T04:21:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	I just mean when trying to connect through my Proxy server from school firefox said "This port is not accepting connections" Could this be because the network is blocking me from accessing the Proxy Server or is it my own error in forwarding it because Im fairly sure its correct
2009-10-14T04:21:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	yes, the school can block that port either incomming, outgoing , or both
2009-10-14T04:22:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	and there is no way around this? X_X Im just trying to find a way past their web site restrictions and I was told a proxy server is the best way but I think they are blocking my connection to it
2009-10-14T04:23:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	use port 80 external and whatever internal
2009-10-14T04:23:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	what do you mean?
2009-10-14T04:23:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	or 8080
2009-10-14T04:24:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	I have port 8118 forwarded.. Why would using Port 80 make a difference?
2009-10-14T04:25:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	because the school doesn't block 80 0r 8080 or else you'd have no web
2009-10-14T04:25:00.000Z	shawn_	SeaPhor	so if I forward my port 80 or 8080 it would work?
2009-10-14T04:26:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	not just that, that would be the "External" port, need more info-- ask in ##networking
2009-10-14T04:42:00.000Z	SeaPhor	shawn_	also, if you want to discuss OT stuff like extended networking, you are welcome to come by my channel when mems are active...
