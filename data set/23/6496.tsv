2006-12-30T16:43:00.000Z	StingRay		 Hi. Can somebody tell how can I disable graphical logins to gnome at all? I don't want to remove gnome.
2006-12-30T16:44:00.000Z	StingRay		 I removed /etc/init.d/gdm and /usr/sbin/gdm, but I am still able to login.
2006-12-30T16:44:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	apt-get remove gdm
2006-12-30T16:45:00.000Z	StingRay	POVaddct	but this will remove gnome at all, right?
2006-12-30T16:45:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	no, just gdm, the display manager
2006-12-30T16:46:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	it will also remove the ubuntu-desktop metapackage
2006-12-30T16:46:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	but ubuntu-desktop is just an empty package with nothing but dependencies
2006-12-30T16:47:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	yes, apt-get install gdm will get you the graphic login back
2006-12-30T16:47:00.000Z	StingRay	POVaddct	is gdm a lot of packages or just one. I want to download just in case.
2006-12-30T16:48:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	one
2006-12-30T16:49:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	you mean the failsafe entry in grub?
2006-12-30T16:50:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	i dont know. i use neither gdm nor kdm (and no gnome, no kde)
2006-12-30T16:51:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	i prefer text login and then startx. my desktop is xfce.
2006-12-30T16:51:00.000Z	StingRay	POVaddct	This box is used by non-professionals. They understand only GUI logins
2006-12-30T16:52:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	then why do you want to disable gdm?
2006-12-30T16:53:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	okay. sorry, cannot help you with kdm. however there should be a kdmrc somewhere in /etc/kde/...
2006-12-30T16:57:00.000Z	StingRay	POVaddct	my apt is telling me it has to remove 2 packages?
2006-12-30T16:58:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	gdm and ubuntu-desktop i guess
2006-12-30T17:06:00.000Z	StingRay	POVaddct	I am going to delete gnome manually. I made apt-get remove gdm, but I can login to ubuntu without any problem?
2006-12-30T17:08:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	you said you wanted kdm, so apt-get install kdm. or do you want to use kde instead of gnome?
2006-12-30T17:08:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	yes to what?
2006-12-30T17:08:00.000Z	POVaddct	StingRay	but you still want gnome as desktop, dont you?
2006-12-30T17:09:00.000Z	StingRay	POVaddct	nope
