2006-11-18T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 what do you mean ?
2006-11-18T08:05:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	I just found it - /etc/sudoers
2006-11-18T08:22:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 system > admin > user & groups
2006-11-18T08:22:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	I am not running X
2006-11-18T08:23:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 I can'T help then
2007-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 I would say no
2007-10-05T06:27:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 I think that is because it is the latest version of the format, I got that to on occasion
2007-10-05T06:28:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	no, these are documents that I've been able to open before
2007-10-05T06:28:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	try and move them around
2007-10-05T06:28:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	move what around?
2007-10-05T06:29:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	there is no scroll bar, since the document is empty
2007-10-05T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 zoom ?
2007-10-05T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 what does the page count show ?
2007-10-05T06:29:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	Zoom In and Zoom Out and greyed out
2007-10-05T06:29:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	the correct number of pages (4 in this case)
2007-10-05T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 try changing page
2007-10-05T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	 in other words  , mess with it a bit , see if it triggers soemthing
2007-10-05T06:30:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	yeah, all I can do is use the menu at the top, which when the menu goes back, leaves a white background (changing page numbers does nothing)
2007-10-05T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	not much else I can recommend,  exectp getting  acroreed from adobe
2007-10-05T06:31:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	there is nothing else open source?
2007-10-05T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	dibblego	not that I know , I donT use pdf s a lot
2007-10-05T06:32:00.000Z	dibblego	Pelo	thanks
