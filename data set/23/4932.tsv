2008-04-14T04:49:00.000Z	Lake		I set up a samba file server on a P3 500MHz 256MB box and sometimes I am under the impression that the transfer speed between server and other machines could be faster if the box was better. Is it just an illusion or is my box a discernable bottleneck ?
2008-04-14T04:49:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	the only thing that will be slowing you down is potentially your disc subsystem.
2008-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	On the hardware you describe it's probably some old slow PATA setup.
2008-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	what do you mean by 'disc subsystem' ?
2008-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	oh yes it is !
2008-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	Basically, you should verify that you have at least DMA support for your IDE controller/disc.
2008-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	so it's not the cpu itself, it's the PATA
2008-04-14T04:50:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	hdparm should tell you tht.
2008-04-14T04:51:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	IDE/ATA comes in a number of levels of "hellness".
2008-04-14T04:51:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	less is better ?
2008-04-14T04:52:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	well, run hdparm -d /dev/hda <= that will tell if your hardware at least uses DMA.
2008-04-14T04:52:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	all right, one second
2008-04-14T04:53:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	and you should probably check first the docs if hdparm -d does not destroy your hardware :-P (no it does not, but sometimes there are joksters around :-p)
2008-04-14T04:55:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	whats the command used to bring up connected drives ?
2008-04-14T04:56:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	I remember once when a colleague and me were quite irritated by the "root" at a customers installation, and while waiting for the email round trip painted out ways to make that stupid MSCE execute rm -Rf without us being implicated by the email.
2008-04-14T04:56:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	connected drives?
2008-04-14T04:56:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	well I want to list the drives that buntu sees
2008-04-14T04:57:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	/dev/sdb5, thats all I get returned
2008-04-14T04:58:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	I am thinking rm -R isn't a nice thing to do :P
2008-04-14T05:00:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	so any ideas on what to do when the output I got it /dev/sdb5:
2008-04-14T05:05:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	What output? Beside you should probably be running it on /dev/sdb :-P
2008-04-14T05:05:00.000Z	yacc	Lake	*shucks* hdparm does not know about DMA on SCSI devices :(
2008-04-14T05:22:00.000Z	Lake	yacc	well thanks anyways then ! even with DMA, I am pretty sure that the combination of 550MHz along with PATA connection as well as the fact that it's streaming over a cheap 40$ D-link router helps the slow speed
