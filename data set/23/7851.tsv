2006-05-27T16:07:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	^^ a couple of lines
2006-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	first prefix lines with the users name, that is the best way on IRC, second, If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
2006-05-27T16:09:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	i aksked twice now ; )
2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	if you resized and your kernel is bombing out there is something very serious wrong (just a guess)
2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	maybe its beacause i resized it under windows with Paragon Partition Manager
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	more likely you overwrote something you should not have and have done serious damage to your ubuntu installation, I suggest using a live CD to see if you can mount the partition and rescue any data you want from it, and then do a reinstall
2006-05-27T16:14:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	get yourself a live CD and see if you can rescue anything, but somehow I doubt you will be able to
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	i have a livecd but i have no possiblity to backup my data
2006-05-27T16:17:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	well then loose windows and you won't make that mistake again :-) seriously get your partitioning right before you try reinstalling again give yourself at least 10G for ubuntu but personally I have over 200 G in this box all ubuntu and its not the only ubuntu machine here :-) (no other o/s allowed ;-))
2006-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	i need windows but i need it for somethings and i nedet more space on my windows partition so i changed the size
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	well you need to give ubuntu a reasonable amount of room if your to use it and enjoy it and as I said about 10G is the minimum that I would suggest to anyone for a general purpose machine
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	my partiton for ubuntu is 90gig
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	:-) kewl
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	but it looks like a reinstall is your only option
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	linux is my main system windows just for music production and some games
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	agnula for music :)
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	by the time eft comes out it may have more music features
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	there must be a posiblity to fix this reinstall system is just the windows way i think an on linux you fix it ^^
2006-05-27T16:22:00.000Z	ompaul	sammy	you don't know what you broke, try the liveCD and see what you can find
2006-05-27T16:22:00.000Z	sammy	ompaul	so you mean i have to backup the data an reinstall kubuntu?
