2009-12-17T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	the panels have nothing to do with wireless
2009-12-17T16:04:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	the toolbaar at the bottom is gone and also the tools in the right bove corner
2009-12-17T16:05:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 they dissepeared after i installed them, it's a clean install
2009-12-17T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	right click the top bar -> add item   and add the notification area
2009-12-17T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	right click the desktop -> add panel
2009-12-17T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	you can then add a new panel at the bottom and add what you wish
2009-12-17T16:08:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	the bug is that the screen is widdenth
2009-12-17T16:08:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 so the lower panel is not shown
2009-12-17T16:08:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 probaly graphic driver problem?
2009-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	boot to the live cd and click places -> the partition you want to access
2009-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	yes but it doesn't give me write access
2009-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	then run: gksudo nautilus    and you can access the partition from /media
2009-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 thanks
2009-12-17T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	you need gksudo ;)
2009-12-17T17:03:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	i still can't access my harddisk
2009-12-17T17:04:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 nvm
2009-12-17T17:06:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 ok it boots now but screen is still fucked up
2009-12-17T17:06:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 it's like my desktop is bigger then my screen
2009-12-17T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	then you need to configure the driver, depends on the video card
2009-12-17T17:09:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	it was ok before i installed the wireless driver :s :(
2009-12-17T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaSSaSLaYeR	you will need to configure settigs, depends on yor video card
2009-12-17T17:11:00.000Z	MaSSaSLaYeR	ActionParsnip	 probaly cause it's a driver for U-b-u-n-t-u  9.04
