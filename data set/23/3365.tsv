2008-05-06T11:51:00.000Z	Bidget		ok now second question about rar archives... is there an app that will open multi-part rar files?
2008-05-06T11:52:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	apt-get install unrar
2008-05-06T11:53:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	it's an option during the install, as long as you choose it, when you boot you should get the menu of which OS to book
2008-05-06T11:55:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	i think once unrar is installed, you can also open the archive with the graphical archive manager and extract that way
2008-05-06T12:24:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	bad advice
2008-05-06T12:29:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	if you are at least running the nvidia driver, you can sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings and use that to customize your resolution, thats what I use
2008-05-06T12:31:00.000Z	Bidget	fiya_werkin	yeah I tried the nvidia-settings but its telling me Im not using an nvidia driver, so that one didnt work
2008-05-06T12:34:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	this from the downloaded install from nvidia?
2008-05-06T12:34:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	you should be in fairly good shape so far then
2008-05-06T12:35:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	you're at a terminal?
2008-05-06T12:39:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	you can try running sudo nvidia-xconfig from the terminal, then restarting x, or run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and go through the menu to redo your xorg.conf
2008-05-06T12:41:00.000Z	Bidget	fiya_werkin	its asking if I want to use a kernel framebuffer device... yes or no?
2008-05-06T12:48:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	any luck?
2008-05-06T12:48:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	what about the restart of x after dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-05-06T12:49:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	what is? nvidia-settings?
2008-05-06T12:49:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	you only do that once, i thought you already did it
2008-05-06T12:50:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	each thing you 'try' may be putting you a bit further in the hole, say yes to the framebuffer
2008-05-06T12:57:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	even after selecting nvidia in the dpkg-reconfigure?
2008-05-06T13:06:00.000Z	Bidget	fiya_werkin	"You do not appear to be using the Nvidia X driver"
2008-05-06T13:07:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	ok, thats all i can really try, the only other thing i could think to look for is errors in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-05-06T13:08:00.000Z	Bidget	fiya_werkin	that file is empty
2008-05-06T13:10:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	its system->admin -> hardware
2008-05-06T13:16:00.000Z	fiya_werkin	Bidget	on the other hand, only one way to learn :)
