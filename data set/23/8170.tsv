2004-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	sval	scizzo	just add the multiverse repository in source.list
2004-12-15T14:58:00.000Z	sval	scizzo	and download all the codec on the mplayer website
2004-12-15T15:03:00.000Z	scizzo	sval	well it hasn't helped me..I have done those things actually
2004-12-15T15:03:00.000Z	sval	scizzo	and what's the problem then ?

2004-12-15T15:04:00.000Z	sval	scizzo	what's the error message ?
2004-12-15T15:12:00.000Z	scizzo	sval	The selected video_out device is incompatible with this codec.
2004-12-15T15:12:00.000Z	scizzo	sval	VDecoder init failed :(
