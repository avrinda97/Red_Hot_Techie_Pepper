2011-10-02T04:10:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Any chance someone can answer a question about Ubuntu installation problems?
2011-10-02T04:11:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		So I burned Ubuntu 10.04 to a CD and booted it.  It gets to the point where it asks what time zone I'm in.  I click 'forward', and it simply doesn't respond or do anything
2011-10-02T04:12:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		I re-burned the CD, and the same thing happened.  I can use that CD to test Ubuntu... it actually runs from that... however when installing it just doesn't do anything after trying to leave the time zone selection screen.
2011-10-02T04:12:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Currently downloading 11.04 to see if it does anything different.  Otherwise, any ideas?
2011-10-02T04:14:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Thanks doctorZeus.  How do I check the md5hash?  I know what it is... I've just never looked into how to verify one
2011-10-02T04:15:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		No, never entered my mind until it was mentioned above.
2011-10-02T04:16:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Bah... looks like google pointed me how to check it in Linux terminal
2011-10-02T04:16:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Unfortunately I'm in Windows (dual-boot system).
2011-10-02T04:17:00.000Z	Visitor_099	Kabuthunk	there are softwares to do it on windows
2011-10-02T04:17:00.000Z	Visitor_099		google something like md5 file check windows
2011-10-02T04:18:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Cool, thanks.  Currently looking into getting a checker and see what it spits out.
2011-10-02T04:19:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Gah, right, Windows doesn't recognize 'ls' in command prompt :P
2011-10-02T04:20:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Yeah, I think I direct downloaded it from ubuntu's site.  Which is where 11.04 is coming from.  Eh, might as well check that when it's done too.
2011-10-02T04:26:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Well crap.  Looks like the md5 matches.
2011-10-02T04:27:00.000Z	Visitor_099		did you try another time zone to see if it works?
2011-10-02T04:27:00.000Z	Kabuthunk	alohaanni	That is a good thing normally, except I was hoping that the file being bad was the problem :P
2011-10-02T04:28:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Didn't try another time zone yet, since it just auto-selects the right one.  Suppose I could try that.
2011-10-02T04:28:00.000Z	Visitor_099		oopies
2011-10-02T04:28:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Will wait until 11.04 finishes downloading though
2011-10-02T04:28:00.000Z	Visitor_099		I accidentally my IRC client.
2011-10-02T04:29:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Don't see how a different time zone would change much, but who knows.  It's like when I click 'forward', I get the hourglass, the CD spins down, and then the computer just sits there like a rock.  I can move the mouse and whatnot, and even click 'x' to exit.  It acknowledges that.
2011-10-02T04:29:00.000Z	Kabuthunk		Strange, strange problem
2011-10-02T04:30:00.000Z	Visitor_099	Kabuthunk	sometimes strange problems have strange solutions
