2009-11-11T01:13:00.000Z	Delano		Is there a better audio player than RhythmBox?
2009-11-11T01:13:00.000Z	Delano		RB is okay
2009-11-11T01:13:00.000Z	Delano		But it's primitive
2009-11-11T01:14:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	banshee, exaile
2009-11-11T01:15:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	exaile has that i believe
2009-11-11T01:16:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	EXAILE
2009-11-11T01:16:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	okay
2009-11-11T01:16:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	you might wanna google its features
2009-11-11T01:19:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	I'm not terribly impressed by exhaile
2009-11-11T01:19:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	there's not equalizer
2009-11-11T01:20:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	i seem to have read somewhere that it can be installed hang on lemme check
2009-11-11T01:20:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	don't bother
2009-11-11T01:20:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	whatever you say
2009-11-11T01:21:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	winamp using wine..wow. now thats bleeding, no edge. seriously
2009-11-11T01:23:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	well, it works and works well... don't get me wrong, I love Linux, but honestly, all the default Linux audio players are either weak Winamp clones or they're bogged down trying to intergrate your playlist to last.fm but offer no functionality or expansion
2009-11-11T01:23:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	are you on gnome, because if you were on kde you wouldn't be saying that
2009-11-11T01:23:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	I tried amarok, didn't impress me either
2009-11-11T01:24:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	again, another "web intergration" bloat
2009-11-11T01:24:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	ok then, well you are really hard to impress...i rest my case
2009-11-11T01:24:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	yes, yes I am :o)
2009-11-11T01:25:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	no reason for settle for 2nd best, imo
2009-11-11T01:25:00.000Z	Delano	pronoy	part of the spirit of open source is listening to suggestions and improving upon them
2009-11-11T01:26:00.000Z	pronoy	Delano	exactly ! this isn't a development channel. its helping channel.
