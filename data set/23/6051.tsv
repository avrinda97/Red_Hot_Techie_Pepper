2007-02-09T16:28:00.000Z	Nitro		Hi. :) I'm trying to compile xchat 2.8, and it first said I didn't have a decent C compiler, so I got gcc( good enough?). Now it says "error: C compiler cannot create executables". Why, is there a way to fix this?
2007-02-09T16:29:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	install build-essential
2007-02-09T16:30:00.000Z	Nitro	bimberi	erm, sorry to ask again, but I'm a bit new to linux, which folder? the same? (xchat-2.8?)
2007-02-09T16:32:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	it's a package you install, for example 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
2007-02-09T16:33:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	no, in order to compile things in Ubuntu you need that package
2007-02-09T16:34:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	cool, np :)
2007-02-09T16:35:00.000Z	Nitro	bimberi	do I need to relogin after it's done (the package you told me)?
2007-02-09T16:37:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	no, should work straight away
2007-02-09T16:39:00.000Z	Nitro	bimberi	need to install glib?
2007-02-09T16:42:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	possibly.  The best way to install the required dependencies would be to 'sudo apt-get build-dep xchat'

2007-02-09T17:21:00.000Z	Nitro	bimberi	Why won't it work?
2007-02-09T17:21:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	hm. if everything worked without error it should be there.  Does 'ls /usr/bin/xchat' return anythibng?
2007-02-09T17:23:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	'ls /usr/bin/*xchat*' ?
2007-02-09T17:24:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	no, from the directory with the source code
2007-02-09T17:25:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	seemes so, is there any clues in the output of the commands? or in the INSTALL file perhaps?
2007-02-09T17:27:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	them I am at a loss.  perhaps 'sudo updatedb' then see if 'locate xchat | grep bin' returns anything
2007-02-09T17:29:00.000Z	Nitro	bimberi	do you know of a package of xchat-2.8?
2007-02-09T17:30:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	no
2007-02-09T17:30:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	there you go, you could try backporting the feisty package
2007-02-09T17:34:00.000Z	Nitro	bimberi	?

2007-02-09T17:39:00.000Z	bimberi	Nitro	no, follow that guide to build a package from feisty sources
