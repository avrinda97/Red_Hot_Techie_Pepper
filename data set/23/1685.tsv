2011-04-04T22:42:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	can you boot into reovery mode? what make/model video card?
2011-04-04T22:43:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	I don't know how to try to boot into recovery mode. Radeon 6850
2011-04-04T22:45:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	choose reovery mode from the grub menu. If you don't see a menu, hold down the left Shift key after POST
2011-04-04T22:47:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	I still don't see any menu, just a command prompt
2011-04-04T22:48:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	if you see a command prompt, grub has already loaded the OS.
2011-04-04T22:48:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	Ok so now what?
2011-04-04T22:49:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	run 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2011-04-04T22:51:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	Someone in the linux channel suggested dpkg-reconfigure -a, what is the difference between that and what you suggested?
2011-04-04T22:52:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	dpkg-reconfigure -a reconfigures all packages. the command I gave you only reconfigures xorg
2011-04-04T22:52:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	 And what is xorg?
2011-04-04T22:55:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	xserver-xorg is the software that enables your graphics
2011-04-04T22:55:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	What is xorg?
2011-04-04T22:56:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	Is there a possible disadvantage of reconfiguring all?
2011-04-04T22:57:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	usually not, but I don't know anything about your system
2011-04-04T22:58:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	With this, would you know of a way to cancel the process? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1721391
2011-04-04T23:00:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	It says it must be run as root
2011-04-04T23:01:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	put 'sudo' in front of the command to run it as root
2011-04-04T23:03:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	Ok I did it, but nothing seem to happen other then it asking for my password. Restart anyway?
2011-04-04T23:04:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	try rebooting. Sorry I don't know much about ATI cards, I use Nvidia
2011-04-04T23:05:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	It didn't work
2011-04-04T23:06:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	maybe your forum post will generate some responses
2011-04-04T23:09:00.000Z	truepurple	oldos2er	I tried the -a trigger, it is asking if I want system wide reasable home directories. Do I?
2011-04-04T23:11:00.000Z	oldos2er	truepurple	I've never seen dpkg ask for 'system wide reasable home directories' before. Don't know what to tell you.
