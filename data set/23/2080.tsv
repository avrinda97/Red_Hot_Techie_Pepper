2009-12-24T20:29:00.000Z	plustax		what is the command to start compiz fusion in terminal?
2009-12-24T20:29:00.000Z	plustax		I just accidentally ended the process
2009-12-24T20:30:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	compiz
2010-01-21T10:44:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	You've been repeating the same meaningless statement. Why not try explaining what it is exactly you're trying to accomplish?
2010-01-21T10:47:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	im trying to get help so that I can actually right click on my desktop and have the ability to put icons on it.
2010-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	That's a little better. Try this command, then restart nautilus: gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop true
2010-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	thank you. Now how do I restart nautilus?
2010-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	From your terminal run 'killall nautilus' and run 'nautilus' from Alt+F2 run dialog
2010-01-21T10:50:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	I tried killall and it said no process found
2010-01-21T10:51:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	Ok, just run nautilus then
2010-01-21T10:51:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	worked great! Thank you man!
2010-01-21T10:52:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	Same gconftool command but substitute true for false
2010-01-21T11:38:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	You need to explain more and learn to ask better questions. Your distros icon is all over the place. Exactly where do you want to change it?
2010-01-21T11:39:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	It's much quicker for you if you don't leave us up to guessing
2010-01-21T11:39:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	I just did. applications menu. That thing at the upper left next to the word applications. Right now it's a gnome foot. and I want to be able to change it to whatever I want!
2010-01-21T11:39:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	All I saw was <plustax> I'm having trouble changing my applications distro icon. I was wondering if anyone could help me?
2010-01-21T11:40:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	I can wrangle up some screen coordinates if you'd like.
2010-01-21T11:40:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	The part where it says 'all on one line' is key here
2010-01-21T11:40:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	fair enough, fair enough. I will get better at it.
2010-01-21T11:41:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	I am not trying to be mean, I want to help you ask better questions so you get better results :)
2010-01-21T11:42:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	But to be frank, I do not know how to change the ubuntu icon in the gnome-panel next to the applications menu
2010-01-21T11:42:00.000Z	plustax	soreau	: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2066611/Screenshot.png
2010-01-21T11:43:00.000Z	soreau	plustax	but that is the question I would ask if I were you, "How can I change the ubuntu icon next to the Application menu in gnome-panel?"
