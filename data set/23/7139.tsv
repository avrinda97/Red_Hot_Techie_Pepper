2005-10-14T08:36:00.000Z	Mon	sn0n	hm but try installing "gcopernicus" helped for me :)
2005-10-14T08:39:00.000Z	Mon	sn0n	you're completely right. apt should take care of that, unfortunatly it didn't. lets hope the maintainer fixes it
2005-10-14T08:39:00.000Z	Mon	sn0n	if you search for gcopernicus in synaptic you can read more about it
2005-10-14T08:43:00.000Z	Mon	sn0n	use synaptic :)
