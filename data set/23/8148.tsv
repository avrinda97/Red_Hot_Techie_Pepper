2005-02-01T12:16:00.000Z	Stew2		If there are two users, User account Bla is member of the group Blagroup, and User Admin is member of the group Admingroup. And User Admin is member of Blagroup, I want Admin user to be able to read and write user account Bla's files. Why can't I? Permissions are R&W for the group Blagroup.
2005-02-01T12:17:00.000Z	Stew2		checking it out
2005-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	Stew2		Yup. The user account Bla's home folder does not have Write permissions for the group.
2005-02-01T12:18:00.000Z	Stew2		Neither does the subfolder 'files' I'm working in.
2005-02-01T12:19:00.000Z	Stew2		When I change the permissions for Bla's home folder, how do I make that propigate? CHMOD -R something or other?
2005-02-01T12:19:00.000Z	Stew2		propigate=recurse
2005-02-01T12:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	yes, chmod -R should do it
2005-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	*DON'T* tell them to log in as root!
2005-02-01T12:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	yes, you can sudo nautilus
2005-02-01T12:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	a script in your menu that asks for a password to run nautilus in "admin" mode would be relatively simple
2005-02-01T12:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	there's a program "gksu" that pops up a dialog box to ask for a password, for instance, though I think that requires a root password
2005-02-01T12:30:00.000Z	Stew2	thoreauputic	That might work then, thanks. Like I said, this isn't some all-important terminal server.
2005-02-01T12:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	I think you would do "gksudo nautilus" as a script
2005-02-01T13:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	no, that's the Debian way
2005-02-01T13:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	the user will also be in group users
2005-06-19T08:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	the error is probably on the server, not your machine
2005-06-19T09:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	get a windowmaker dockapp or use gkrellm to monitor your dialup etc
2005-06-19T09:06:00.000Z	Stew2	thoreauputic	It doesn't matter if I restart the machine. Poff still thinks I've got multiple copies of pppd running.
2005-06-19T09:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	my experience with the networking front end was that I got *very* slow connection speeds
2005-06-19T09:08:00.000Z	Stew2	thoreauputic	I seem to get slow connects too, though the slow connection in Ubuntu Hoary seems to be an artifact of the inability to enter a proper command string to get reliable connections with the modem.
2005-06-19T09:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	in my case, th emodem is perfectly fine, yet the default config with the gnome frontend gave me $MB per hour (do not adjust your set, there is a fault in reality)
2005-06-19T09:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	i don't think the hoary frontend to ppp uses pppconfig
2005-06-19T09:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stew2	as I used pppconfig after the frotend and it knew nothing about my previous config
