2007-02-02T11:03:00.000Z	agliv5		I had to update glib to >= 2.5 and, in doing so, removed the standard glib ubuntu package.  Ubuntu didn't like that and now I'm trying to fix it.  Anyone feel up to helping me?
2007-02-02T11:04:00.000Z	agliv5		I have a question.  If I install a new version of ubuntu, will my files in /home/ be effected?
2007-02-02T11:04:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	depends on how you format
2007-02-02T11:04:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	but by default, yes
2007-02-02T11:05:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	please explain
2007-02-02T11:05:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	the best thing is if /home was on a seperate partition
2007-02-02T11:06:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	how do I view my partitions?
2007-02-02T11:06:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	you can use fdisk/cfdisk for command line utilities, or use gparted
2007-02-02T11:08:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	gparted terminated glib option error
2007-02-02T11:11:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	try using cfdisk then to take a look
2007-02-02T11:19:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	cfdisk says fatal error: cannot open disk drive
2007-02-02T11:19:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	you do know you can't partition a live filesystem right?
2007-02-02T11:21:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	that's why it took me so long to respond.... I had to restart my broken 6.06 istall to run cfdisk
2007-02-02T11:21:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	and fdisk -l isn't showing anything which is starting to freak me out...
2007-02-02T11:21:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	the livecd has gparted on it, and psychocats.net has a great tutorial about how to move your data to a home partition
2007-02-02T11:23:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	so reboot live and run gparted?
2007-02-02T11:24:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	your main aim is to do a NEW installation while preserving your /home data?
2007-02-02T11:27:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	seeing as how I really messed up 6.06, I would like to get a clean install of 6.10 and perserve my /home data yes :)
2007-02-02T11:27:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	yes, then boot the livecd and gparted and follow the tutorial (remember pyschocats.net)
2007-02-02T11:29:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	I've found pyschocats.net but I haven't found the tutorial you're talking about...
2007-02-02T11:30:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	I think I found it now... talking about the backup ubuntu guide?
2007-02-02T11:31:00.000Z	nothlit	agliv5	Beyond The Basics: Make a /home partition http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
2007-02-02T11:33:00.000Z	agliv5	nothlit	thanks for your help and I'll get back if I'm having trouble ;)
