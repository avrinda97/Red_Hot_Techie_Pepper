2010-12-26T08:45:00.000Z	TheWarden		okay I have another problem that is driving me nuts with Ubuntu in the X Window
2010-12-26T08:46:00.000Z	TheWarden		One has I believe 4 virtual desktops created. Now each desktop is a viewing area that can be the resolution set or beyond your resolution. Does this make sense before I continue?
2010-12-26T08:46:00.000Z	TheWarden		when I say viewing area I'm not talking about the monitor resolution.
2010-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	TheWarden		view area or desktop size not sure what the proper term is
2010-12-26T08:48:00.000Z	TheWarden		If that makes sense, I'll continue the viewing area or desktop size for some reason is beyond the size of the monitor resolution. how do I make them the same? Keep in mind in my case here I'm using a CRT TV as my monitor.
2010-12-26T08:49:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	try in system>Preferences>onitors to check the best settiongs for your screen resolution and configuration
2010-12-26T08:50:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	I can't do that as I'm using the NVIDIA drivers. Also I'm in no way referring to the resolution size the monitor is using.
2010-12-26T08:50:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	i used the driver from the nvidia website and i can use that tool for that
2010-12-26T08:51:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	well I can't it says I have to use the NVIDIA tool as I'm not using a regular monitor its a CRT TV. Why it says I can't I do not know.
2010-12-26T08:52:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	ah! mmm but in my opinion, first check if you can play with the monitor via that tool, in that way you check that your linux and the monitor are understanding each other
2010-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	well I've looked in there and all there is a monitor resolution setting. Nothing more that refers to size of virtual desktop/viewing area.
2010-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	I can't let me get the message it tells me when I try to use the monitors. Plus even if I do use that tool it doesn't provide what I'm talking about. It again only allows one to set the monitor resolution used.
2010-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	mmm i get the point... but... isn't an odd combination a CRT TV with an accelerated graphics video card?... :)
2010-12-26T08:59:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	yes okay here is the message
2010-12-26T08:59:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	when I run "Monitors" I receive this message, "It appears that your graphics driver does not support the necessary extensions to use this tool. Do you want to use your graphics driver vendor's tool instead?
2010-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	oh! never saw that before... then install the nvidia tool for that, i just used it once
2010-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	Like I was saying I checked again and there is no way to change the setting I'm referring to in Monitors anyways. It only has monitor resolution nothing much more then that.
2010-12-26T09:01:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	I have it installed and that doesn't have what I'm talking about either :(
2010-12-26T09:02:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	you are right, virtual size desktop is a pretty old feature i see years ago... in fact in the last century, xD
2010-12-26T09:03:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	well lol that is what I'm talking about... the size of it is bigger then my monitor
2010-12-26T09:03:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	afaik it was in the xserver previous to xorg... i forgtot the name... sigh
2010-12-26T09:05:00.000Z	cablop	TheWarden	let me think... suppose you have a monitor capable to only 640x480 resolution but yuou use 1024x768 on it and whn you push the pointer to the edge of the screen it "scrolls" to that portion of sesktop... right?
2010-12-26T09:15:00.000Z	TheWarden	cablop	thanks for your help too
