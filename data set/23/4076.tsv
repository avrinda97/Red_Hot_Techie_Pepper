2008-11-13T04:54:00.000Z	storrgie		When i set networking up in the gnome networking thing the settings dont stick around. what should i do to set up networking correctly
2008-11-13T04:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	ubuntu uses Network Manager
2008-11-13T04:57:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	yea i mean network manager... I Really want to set networking up to be a VERY particular way... but i cant get it working
2008-11-18T05:14:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	i dropped, dont know if u responded since my question about mounting
2008-11-18T05:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	list them and mount them from /etc/fstab
2008-11-18T05:15:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	but to what mountpoint?
2008-11-18T05:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	/mnt/somthing (if you mount them in /media/ they will appear on gnome desktop and in Places)
2008-11-18T05:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	you can mount things in any empty directory you want /media/ and /mnt/ are conventions
2008-11-18T05:16:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	I did do that, here is my fstab: http://pastebin.com/d6c181588
2008-11-18T05:17:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	but when i go there, i cant see any files
2008-11-18T05:17:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	http://pastebin.com/d2305c09
2008-11-18T05:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	cat /proc/mounts
2008-11-18T05:19:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	so messy: http://pastebin.com/d3cb82745
2008-11-18T05:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	the two volumes appear as no mounted... do "sudo mount -a"
2008-11-18T05:21:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	uh oh: http://pastebin.com/d418e4f5d
2008-11-18T05:22:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	got it, i spelled relatime as realtime
2008-11-18T05:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	:)
2008-11-18T05:23:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	best problems are the ones that solve themselves, haha. So now that they are mounted, do i get any indication in my gnome menu?
2008-11-18T05:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	you shouldn't. it was what you wanted no? if you want them to appear on Places and the like mount them in /media/
2008-11-18T05:24:00.000Z	storrgie	erUSUL	can I make a 'shortcut' to them?
2008-11-18T05:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	yep you can symlink to your destop if you want.
2008-11-18T05:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	but if you want them to appear on your desktop is easier to just mount them under /media/
2008-11-18T05:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	storrgie	instead of /mnt/
