2005-11-02T06:08:00.000Z	Korio		Is anyone running bitlbee?
2005-11-02T06:09:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	i did, now using gaim again :)
2005-11-02T06:09:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	i get some weird problem; :localhost. NOTICE AUTH :BitlBee-IRCd initialized, please go on
2005-11-02T06:10:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	so check what user bitlbee runs as and give it rw access to that dir ;)
2005-11-02T06:10:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	um how do i do that?
2005-11-02T06:10:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	is it in your inetd.conf
2005-11-02T06:11:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	if you get it in ps, try ps axu
2005-11-02T06:11:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	you confused me
2005-11-02T06:12:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	iirc there are several ways to install bitlbee, i have no idea how ubuntu does it (currently trying to download it ;))
2005-11-02T06:12:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	i just apt-get install bitlbee ?
2005-11-02T06:12:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	 im in inetd.conf now what should i do?
2005-11-02T06:13:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	is there something about bitlbee?
2005-11-02T06:14:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	thats whats there
2005-11-02T06:15:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	i would love to help you right now, but i have no debian running right now. first, check the rights of that dir by "ls -ld /var/lib/bitlbee", you know these masks?
2005-11-02T06:15:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	nope im pretty much not shure what im doing
2005-11-02T06:16:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	what is the standard file manager?
2005-11-02T06:16:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	my file manager is XFE
2005-11-02T06:17:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	but i guess this is some kind of bug, will look into that when i get it up and running :D
2005-11-02T06:17:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	well im running xubuntu
2005-11-02T06:18:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	this is just another package selection, is not it?
2005-11-02T06:18:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	no idea
2005-11-02T06:19:00.000Z	Korio	andi5	oh didnt understand the question, well xubuntu is ubuntu without gnome and all the bloat
2005-11-02T06:22:00.000Z	andi5	Korio	two things you need to do i guess: 1) find out the user bitlbee runs as (ps axu | grep tcpd might help, maybe just the second after some connection, dunno), 2) adjust the rights for /var/lib/bitlbee; alternative: there is some bitlbee configuration file you should read (now) ;)
