2010-09-06T20:07:00.000Z	ricdanger		doesnt work
2010-09-06T20:07:00.000Z	ricdanger		on 10.04
2010-09-06T20:08:00.000Z	ricdanger		freenx / remote access
2010-09-06T20:09:00.000Z	ricdanger		I already tried policykit policies, but they are not working for restart and shutdown
2010-09-06T20:10:00.000Z	trism	ricdanger	are you using the correct actions? the current ones in 10.04 are org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.*
2010-09-06T20:10:00.000Z	ricdanger		yep, I'm usign that ones org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.*
2010-09-06T20:10:00.000Z	ricdanger		and also upower
2010-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	ricdanger		hibernate and suspend is not shown after I disable the upower actions
2010-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	ricdanger		but restart and shutdown are still shown
2010-09-06T20:12:00.000Z	ricdanger		actually, I already disabled org.freedesktop.devicekit.power.*, org.freedesktop.upower.* and org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.*
2010-09-06T20:13:00.000Z	trism	ricdanger	this works for me http://pastebin.com/BxFTPVbE in /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/10-disable-shutdown.pkla , stops the test8 user from shutting down or suspending (well it prompts for an admin password, but completely disabling it is possible too), you have to add gdm too if you don't want someone shutting down from the login screen
2010-09-06T20:14:00.000Z	ricdanger	trism	I have something like that already, for all users. But shutdown and restart menu items are still shown in gnome
2010-09-06T20:15:00.000Z	trism	ricdanger	yes, that has nothing to do with showing the items
2010-09-06T20:15:00.000Z	ricdanger		I also set that to "no"
2010-09-06T20:15:00.000Z	trism	ricdanger	it just disabled them working, because they have no policykit auth
2010-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	ricdanger	trism	I understand. But if I disable suspend and hibernate with policykit, the menu items are not shown anymore. Is it possible to do the same with shutdown and restart?
2010-09-06T20:19:00.000Z	trism	ricdanger	I'm sure there is a way to hide those options, but I don't know it
2010-09-06T20:23:00.000Z	ricdanger	trism	figured it out :) /apps/indicator-session/ had settings to suppress the menu item :)
2010-09-06T20:23:00.000Z	trism	ricdanger	does it actually work? last time I tried that key did nothing
2010-09-06T20:23:00.000Z	ricdanger		yep. it seems to work. I no longer have the menu items there
2010-09-06T20:24:00.000Z	ricdanger		just lock scree and logout
2010-09-06T20:24:00.000Z	trism	ricdanger	excellent
2010-09-06T20:25:00.000Z	ricdanger	trism	I wonder if there exist more widgets that shutdown the computer
