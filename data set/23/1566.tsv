2010-03-20T10:08:00.000Z	leeping_		Hey guys, I need some help.  I unplugged a USB drive from a Mac, and now the disk is unreadable.  I need to figure out how to recover the data, are there any programs in Ubuntu that can do this?
2010-03-20T10:08:00.000Z	leeping_		For reference, it's a FAT-32 formatted drive.  I tried a few Windows recovery programs but none of them worked
2010-03-20T10:09:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	look at fsck.vfat
2010-03-20T10:11:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	I'm a bit hesitant to use fsck because I'm worried it'll write to my drive if I set the wrong options.  Maybe my worries are unfounded and I should use it anyway
2010-03-20T10:12:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	make a binary image of it with dd
2010-03-20T10:13:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	dd if=/dev/usb of=usbimage
2010-03-20T10:13:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	that's a good idea.  I'll do that. ActionParsnip, thanks for the suggestion, I'll try that too
2010-03-20T11:01:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	fsck is returning an error.  It says : "only 1 or 2 FATs are supported, not 235."
2010-03-20T11:01:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	maybe it only does fat and fat16
2010-03-20T11:01:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	it supports FAT32.  I just don't know if it recognizes my disk as such
2010-03-20T11:02:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	the partition doesn't show up.  It simply says /dev/sdb
2010-03-20T11:03:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	try fsck.vfat /dev/sdb1
2010-03-20T11:03:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	No such file or directory
2010-03-20T11:04:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	the best luck I've had so far was with GetDataBack (a Windows program).  It was able to recover most of the files except for the most recent ones, and the directory names got all scrambled up
2010-03-20T11:04:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	I use it all the time, its pretty good
2010-03-20T11:04:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	do you know if it's possible to get directory names back?
2010-03-20T11:05:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	I usually just take what it gives
2010-03-20T11:10:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	foremost wont find much more than getdataback, but its a try
2010-03-20T11:11:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	do you know if foremost tries to get the directories back too?
2010-03-20T11:11:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	it doesnt
2010-03-20T11:11:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	its a forensics application, its there to look at descriptors of files rather than recover them.
2010-03-20T11:13:00.000Z	mtx_init	leeping_	gl im off to bed
2010-03-20T11:14:00.000Z	leeping_	mtx_init	thanks!
