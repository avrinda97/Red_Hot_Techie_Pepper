2010-10-14T04:06:00.000Z	StaRetji		Folks, I need urgent help. My maverick installed on usb stick stopped booting. I've backup image of the stick and saved it on new stick, the same thing happens. USB stick reboots PC just after the bios logo appears. I've booted another system and mounted the stick, all files are there. I suspect boot record is broken somehow. Can someone help me restore it. Corrupted stick is mounted in /mnt . How can I update grub, or at least how can I find out which gru

2010-10-14T04:09:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	if any of the instructions are confusing, just ask
2010-10-14T04:09:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	thx for the info, I already booted another ubuntu and mounter currputed stick
2010-10-14T04:10:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	So start at the sudo mount --bind steps
2010-10-14T04:12:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	so far so good, fingers crossed
2010-10-14T04:13:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	Ok, good luck!
2010-10-14T04:22:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	Dude, thank you so much for the link and mickster04 also. You guys are great!!! It works :)
2010-10-14T04:22:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	Your welcome. I'm glad it worked.
2010-10-14T04:23:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	it took 5 minutes to boot. How can I force fsck. It booted 30 seconds before.
2010-10-14T04:23:00.000Z	StaRetji		It booted in 30 second before
2010-10-14T04:24:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	Maybe it will boot better now that you have run a fsck?
2010-10-14T04:26:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	I haven't run fsck, can't remember the command, it was something reboot -F something. This is my dmesg http://paste.ubuntu.com/512741/ it shows a lot of warnings which I don't quite understand. Thx for helping so far, it's really appreciated.
2010-10-14T04:27:00.000Z	StaRetji		EXT4-fs (sda1): INFO: recovery required on readonly filesystem
2010-10-14T04:28:00.000Z	StaRetji		Is mounted filesystem with ordered data mode good for USB stick, or it should be mounted differently.
2010-10-14T04:29:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	I don't know alot about mounting and filesystems
2010-10-14T04:29:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	ok mate, thx once again for the help :)
2010-10-14T04:29:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	If I was to give you advice on running fsck, it would be from me reading man fsck.ext4
2010-10-14T04:35:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	It looks like fsck.ext4 -f -p /dev/sda1 might be what you need. However, that would have to be while the filesystem is unmounted, so maybe from another system or somehow early in the boot? Of course, it might not still be /dev/sda1 if you are booted into another install/livecd
2010-10-14T04:40:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	I've found out that shutdown -rF now will force fsck on reboot
2010-10-14T04:42:00.000Z	StaRetji	Azendale	however, even after running fsck boot time is still about 4 minutes comparing to 30seconds. It's seems that between this line:  EXT4-fs (sda1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
2010-10-14T04:42:00.000Z	StaRetji		 and the line: udev[435]: starting version 163 is gap of 3 minutes
2010-10-14T04:46:00.000Z	Azendale	StaRetji	Hmm, I don't have any clue why it's taking so long then. Hopefully someone else can help you
