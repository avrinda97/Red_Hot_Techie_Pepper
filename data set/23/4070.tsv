2007-11-22T11:15:00.000Z	V1k1ng		My question tonight is this:   my folks have one of those usb wireless hubs on their desktop...how in the world do I get ubuntu to work with it???   Can you point me to a howto or something?
2007-11-22T11:15:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	youd have to know what kinda hardware is on it, specifically the firmware
2007-11-22T11:16:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	It's a D-Link
2007-11-22T11:16:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	is it a hub or a network card?
2007-11-22T11:16:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	give me a second and I'll pull up my thread...
2007-11-22T11:18:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  here's my thread, I just don't know where to start looking....http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=619775
2007-11-22T11:19:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	i dont know if its broadcom based or not, my friend's dlink wifi adapter is broadcom based, pretty easy to install, but i dunno about a usb dongle
2007-11-22T11:20:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  yeah, no one seems to know what to do with these, any idea where I would start?
2007-11-22T11:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	lsusb -v   may give you some useful output, if u pastebin it i may be able to help you, but i cant guarentee anything :)
2007-11-22T11:22:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	 Thanks for the offer,  I'll be at my mom's tomorrow so I was just trying to collect some ideas tonight
2007-11-22T11:22:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  her system is slow so I thought i'd install xubuntu
2007-11-22T11:23:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	good choice, but fluxbox may even be better, im assuming shes only using it for surfing the web, or maybe the occasional office utility
2007-11-22T11:24:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  there is a problem with the installer though when it prompts you for security updates and you don't have a connection
2007-11-22T11:25:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	that isnt a huge issue tho is it? generally you can skip over that part and deal with it later when u get a connection
2007-11-22T11:25:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  no but fluxbuntu's installer isn't graphical, but it hangs waiting for a graphical response
2007-11-22T11:25:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  oh, you're saying install fluxbox  i get it
2007-11-22T11:26:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	at least give it a try, you dont have to stick with it if she needs more, but most people (including my parents) dont really need a whole lot and fluxbox runs great :)
2007-11-22T11:27:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  the main thing is to get that wireless hub running, if they can surf the internet and check email, they'll love it
2007-11-22T11:27:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	yea that could possibly be an issue though, i dont know for sure if that wifi adapter will work or not
2007-11-22T11:28:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  it seems some have, but they haven't left much of a paper trail...you either know how to do it or you don't
2007-11-22T11:28:00.000Z	MasterShrek	V1k1ng	check the output from lsusb -v, you shold be able to find out what module its using
2007-11-22T11:28:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  I'm trying to urge my folks to buy a new laptop anyway
2007-11-22T11:29:00.000Z	V1k1ng	MasterShrek	  I tried to install wolvix because i heard it has great hardware support but that install failed too
