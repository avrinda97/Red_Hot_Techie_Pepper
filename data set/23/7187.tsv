2007-08-24T14:01:00.000Z	lgc		Nautilus help, please!
2007-08-24T14:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	What help do you need?
2007-08-24T14:02:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	why doesn't musical content displayed in a Nautilus window play anymore on Feisty when the cursor is over it?
2007-08-24T14:05:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	?
2007-08-24T14:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	Don't know. Maybe it is turned off under gconf?
2007-08-24T14:06:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	is it turned off by default?
2007-08-24T14:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	I don't know, perhaps.
2007-08-24T14:07:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	where should I look at?
2007-08-24T14:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	I'm not sure. Fire up a terminal and run gconf-editor. There's a section on nautilus, I'm pretty sure it allows you to turn on/off certain previewing
2007-08-24T14:17:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	could it be "preview_sound"?
2007-08-24T14:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	Try it and see.
2007-08-24T14:19:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	I see no way of changing it. The value of it is "<schema>". When I try to edit it says that current pairs and schemas can't be changed, blah, blah...
2007-08-24T14:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	Ah. Well, keep looking.
2007-08-24T14:19:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	do you get sound from icons when you "cursor" over them?
2007-08-24T14:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	No, but I used to.
2007-08-24T14:20:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	then you're in the same situation.
2007-08-24T14:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	What is /apps/nautilus/preferences/preview_sound set to?
2007-08-24T14:21:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	there is no such file...
2007-08-24T14:21:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	in gconf-editor
2007-08-24T14:22:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	it just says "<schema>" like almost everything else.
2007-08-24T14:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	lgc	Are you sure you're not looking at /schemas/....
2007-08-24T14:24:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	under Preferences there appear many settings, among them 'preview_sound', all set to "<schema>".
2007-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	lgc	Stormx2	and it's not just for my user, but for others as well.
