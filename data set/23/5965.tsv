2006-07-23T16:23:00.000Z	bobovski		is there a way to check a windows formatted partition for errors while in ubuntu?
2006-07-23T16:25:00.000Z	bobovski		jowi: ntfs
2006-07-23T16:25:00.000Z	bobovski		jowi: running xp
2006-07-23T16:26:00.000Z	bobovski		jowi: I was resizing my ntfs partition and there was an error. now I can't access the partition at all
2006-07-23T16:28:00.000Z	bobovski		jowi: let me see if I have a disk utility available to use as an ntfs program
2006-07-23T16:29:00.000Z	bobovski		subhuman: do either of those have disk error-corretion programs?
2006-07-23T16:30:00.000Z	bobovski		subhuman: I'm sorry, I don't understand what journalled means?
2006-07-23T16:31:00.000Z	bobovski		oh, great let me try that
2006-07-23T16:32:00.000Z	bobovski		er, shit. except us.archive.ubuntu.com is down
