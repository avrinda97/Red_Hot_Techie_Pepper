2007-03-05T15:16:00.000Z	ZepDom		Can anyone let me know if I need to install the proprietary ATI drivers on my machine?
2007-03-05T15:17:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	look here http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Hardware and here http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux64/linux64-radeon.html
2007-03-05T15:18:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	but make sure that you get the correct cpu chip type downloaded
2007-03-05T15:19:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	 My card is listed on the fglrx page... does that mean it will work without the dati drivers?
2007-03-05T15:20:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	i just installed yesterday. you have to research that. so far though, after my install, my machine seems to be fine
2007-03-05T15:21:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	 I guess I don't understand what the difference is between fglrx and the ati drivers... why I would use one over the other one.
2007-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	what video card are you installing?
2007-03-05T15:24:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	 oh, i installed AtI X200 so it is about the same
2007-03-05T15:24:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	 so you did fglrx?
2007-03-05T15:26:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	do these checks on your command line http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions
2007-03-05T15:29:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x4b
2007-03-05T15:30:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	are you getting that as a message from one of the commands?
2007-03-05T15:30:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	yeah... glxinfo
2007-03-05T15:31:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	man glxinfo to see what it checks
2007-03-05T15:32:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	but none of the glx stuff is coming up in the other commands i put in
2007-03-05T15:33:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	i see that there is no man page for it. i do see also that it has a lot of info
2007-03-05T15:33:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	 I lookd in synaptic and saw that fglrx is NOT installed.
2007-03-05T15:34:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	maybe you need it. have you done a search on the ubuntu forum to see what others experienced
2007-03-05T15:34:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	did you install the ATI driver?
2007-03-05T15:35:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	 no
2007-03-05T15:35:00.000Z	PCGenie	ZepDom	well that is how i installed it
2007-03-05T15:37:00.000Z	ZepDom	PCGenie	 did you just download the xorg driver?
