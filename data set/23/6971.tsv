2005-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	jesdiscover		anyone else seeing download problems from repositories ?..so far wine and blackdown java aren't fetching right (          blackdown failed at around 87%) and wanted to make sure its not just me ..??
2005-11-10T16:38:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	You have no business downloading from blackdown. Blackdown java is in the Ubuntu repositories.
2005-11-10T16:38:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	im not downloading from there..im doing all this from "add applications'....
2005-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	Ah, that's good then :-)
2005-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	See if you can try a different mirror site.
2005-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	Also check if your disk is full.
2005-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	disk has tons of room
2005-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	use a diffferent mirror ?
2005-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	Yep
2005-11-10T16:40:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	sorry..my brother setup this thing on my computer last night..I dont know a  mirror from the one in my  bathroom
2005-11-10T16:40:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	'sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list' and change the hostname for the mirror. What's in there now?
2005-11-10T16:41:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	I have no idea what your talking about :(..maybe im asking for help in the wrong place..where shoud I go ?
2005-11-10T16:41:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	Open a terminal. Type 'sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list'.
2005-11-10T16:42:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	its asking for some password....im going to strange my brother when I see him today
2005-11-10T16:43:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	That's supposed to happen. Enter your password.
2005-11-10T16:45:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	ok that seems to be working...nothing is happening though..the cursor wont move
2005-11-10T16:45:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	Not with the arrow keys?
2005-11-10T16:46:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	hm
2005-11-10T16:46:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	'nano' won't use the mouse.
2005-11-10T16:46:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	oh
2005-11-10T16:47:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	Now it'll have a few lines that start wuth 'deb'. Can you paste *one* of them?
2005-11-10T16:49:00.000Z	jesdiscover	cafuego	I am so glad your trying to help me...but this is all rather confusing coming from windows ( brother insisted and so far its nice enough ..)...shouldnt 'add applications' just work  ?
2005-11-10T16:49:00.000Z	cafuego	jesdiscover	yes, but if the server it's fetching the application from is not working right, there will be issues.
