2009-11-01T16:37:00.000Z	diam		is anone free? i have a simple problem with grub
2009-11-01T16:38:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	there are nos imple problems with grub, but ask your question
2009-11-01T16:39:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	on a different physical drive?
2009-11-01T16:40:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	that's strange.. did you upgrade or do a clean karmic install?
2009-11-01T16:40:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	and use my nickname when replying to my msgs so i know when there is a msg waiting for me, also doing something else so i can't keep an eye on the channel
2009-11-01T16:41:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	in that case you'll need to upgrade grub.. i can help you through it, but for starters, do you have any other hard drives in your comp? (no worries, just pointing it out for you so i can help you out more effectively)
2009-11-01T16:43:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	that's good... in that case your solution is very simple.. open the terminal and tell me when you're ready (we're gonna hook you up with grub2 which DOES recognize the windows partitions) :P
2009-11-01T16:43:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	sudo apt-get install grub-pc
2009-11-01T16:44:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	tell me when it installs the grub-pc package (which is grub 2)
2009-11-01T16:47:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	do it and make sure you select the partitions to install itself into like /dev/sda (one of the install steps should give you the option, make sure you check off the box)
2009-11-01T16:49:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	by clicking on the forward button.. if there is none, if you have something that looks more like a DOS program, use TAB to navigate
2009-11-01T16:50:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	just press enter.. i think there will be 2 of them
2009-11-01T16:50:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	enter for both.. leave default :P
2009-11-01T16:51:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	yes.. that's just grub crap that i have no idea how to configure, but it doesn't matter b/c i got it to run :)
2009-11-01T16:52:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	ok now before you run the next step, i'll warn you that if there is an issue, it might make your computer unbootable (1%< chance).. in that case you can always fire up the live cd, open x-chat and get some high-level support from people on #grub :)
2009-11-01T16:53:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	now run the following command.. sudo upgrade-from-grub-legacy
2009-11-01T16:53:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	sudo upgrade-from-grub-legacy
2009-11-01T16:53:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	once you run it, you should get a nicer boot menu, which WILL recognize vista as well as karmic :)
2009-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	once its upgraded from legacy, reboot and pray.. if prayers don't work out, there's always the ubuntu live cd and #grub ;)
2009-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	good luck and send me a private message once you get back just so i know everything worked out fine (/msg FiReSTaRT worked!!!!) :)
2009-11-01T17:02:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	so everything worked out fine? :)
2009-11-01T17:03:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	do /join #grub (here in xchat)... i'm assuming it's still not recognizing vista?
2009-11-01T17:04:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	diam	sorry about that buddy.. that did the trick for me.. fortunately you have grub2, so they should be able to hook you up with the right solution
