2005-04-10T12:03:00.000Z	Levander		does firefox's self-updating feature work in hoary?
2005-04-10T12:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 i would hope not
2005-04-10T12:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 the package should be upgraded by root, not each individual user
2005-04-10T12:04:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	why would u hope not?  is that works, don't have to wait for ubuntu releases to have latest stuff, and still be integrated w ubuntu
2005-04-10T12:04:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	u could set up firefox's upgrade feature so it can only be used by root
2005-04-10T12:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 why would i want every user to hve her own copy of something as large as firefox in their $HOME ?
2005-04-10T12:05:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	they wouldn't
2005-04-10T12:05:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	but that's not what the firefox upgrade feature does
2005-04-10T12:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 users shouldn't have write access to the requisite dirs, nor is subverting the packge management system something i'd want
2005-04-10T12:06:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	don't have to subvert either of those things
2005-04-10T12:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 it doesn't bypass dpkg?
2005-04-10T12:06:00.000Z	Levander		the upgrade puts it's files in the same place every time, could just tell dpkg the directory those files are in
2005-04-10T12:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 that wouldn't update the md5sums, etc
2005-04-10T12:07:00.000Z	Levander		who cares, you'd get all the security updates which the vast majority of users care about than the md5sums
2005-04-10T12:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	i still don't like the concept of non-root making system-wide changes either
2005-04-10T12:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 who CARES?? are you serious?
2005-04-10T12:08:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	already told you, could make it so that root has to do the upgrade
2005-04-10T12:08:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	most users gonna care a lot more about the security upgrades than the md5sums
2005-04-10T12:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 root (on this box at lest) would have no desire to break the box
2005-04-10T12:09:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	of course not
2005-04-10T12:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 perhaps you should research the implications of what you suggest
2005-04-10T12:09:00.000Z	Levander	eyequeue	perhaps i already have
2005-04-10T12:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	Levander	 your comments don't indicate that
