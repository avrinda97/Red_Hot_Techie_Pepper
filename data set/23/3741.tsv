2008-02-06T00:07:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- tar -cpgvf files.tar.gz files
2008-02-06T00:08:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- use bzip instead - you get better compression - use the "j" option instead of "g"
2008-02-06T00:35:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- you need to tar -xvgf .... the tar file has been compressed with gzip
2008-02-06T00:36:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	thanks
2008-02-06T00:36:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- note the extra "g" - you should use bzip though - that gives better compression - to use that replace g with j
2008-02-06T00:37:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- name files file.tar.bz2
2008-02-06T00:37:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	ca i also use -p when extracting or is that only when creating archive
2008-02-06T00:39:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- the p just means to preserve permissions - I prefer this
2008-02-06T00:39:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- that should read "preserve the origional permissions"
2008-02-06T00:40:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- that should read "preserve the *original permissions" :)
2008-02-06T00:40:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	will i have to use it when extracting though, being i created the archve with the -p option
2008-02-06T00:42:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- only if you wish to preserve permissions - otherwise I think some files permissions can get a bit messed up - ie executables etc
2008-02-06T00:43:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- not too much of a worry though - the p option is just a nicety really
2008-02-06T00:43:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	this is what im trying to do, and it just hangs there  tar -xpvgf grbackup.tar.gz
2008-02-06T00:45:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- How big is the archive you are trying to extract - ie whats the file size?
2008-02-06T00:45:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	8.2mb
2008-02-06T00:45:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	im ssh into my webserver and trying to ectract it there
2008-02-06T00:49:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- wierd - try creating the archive again but without the g flag. ie tar -cpvf file.tar files.... Sometimes different machines may have different versions of gzip installed and this can cause problems
2008-02-06T00:49:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	thanks ill gove it a go
2008-02-06T02:18:00.000Z	ouellettesr	danand_	that worked form me earlier thanks
2008-02-06T02:18:00.000Z	danand_	ouellettesr	- nice one! no problem
