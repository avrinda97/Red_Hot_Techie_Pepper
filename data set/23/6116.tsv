2006-08-31T12:42:00.000Z	orangey		hey all!
2006-08-31T12:42:00.000Z	orangey		Where can I find a dapper package of rhythmbox?
2006-08-31T12:42:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	in dapper's main repository
2006-08-31T12:43:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	oops. sorry. I meant 0.9.5
2007-01-10T10:31:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	remove totem and install mplayer
2007-01-10T10:33:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	I am going to write this on ubuntuforums, so I would rather not leave people with a 'broken' system.
2007-01-10T10:33:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	system won't be broken
2007-01-10T10:33:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	I do recognize it's a metapackage, but it seems suboptimal to leave it not installed
2007-01-10T10:33:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	you can also "touch" the mplayer*.so file in /usr/lib/firefox/ but the first way is better
2007-03-13T10:51:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	what version of ubuntu?
2007-03-13T10:51:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	feisty, though I would also like the info on edgy : )
2007-03-13T10:52:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	well, afaik that application disappeared in edgy because it was unmaintained and hasn't returned in feisty
2007-03-13T10:53:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	well, OK, maybe I'm wondering about another question..
2007-03-13T10:54:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	I don't know, I think the reasoning is that you shouldn't need to.  There is an application called pysdm in the repositories that you can try though (I have not used it myself)
2007-03-17T07:51:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	launchpad.net
2007-03-17T07:51:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	OK.. I'm there, and can't track it. It says general things, but it seems that only  when the maintainer makes a fixed change do I see it.
2007-03-17T07:52:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	For example, in a bug I contributed to in launchpad, Ben collins said that he committed a fix. But I don't see where.
2007-03-17T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	it was probably comitted to feisty's repos
2007-03-17T07:54:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	It doesn't seem to be.
2007-03-17T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	maybe #ubuntu-motu will know more, I'm interested too :)
2007-03-17T07:55:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/75398
2007-03-17T07:55:00.000Z	orangey	jrib	In that example, the newest version is from 14 March, but Ben only did it on 16 I think.
2007-03-17T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	orangey	from the wiki: Fix Committed: Means for package maintainers, that the changes are pending and to be uploaded soon
