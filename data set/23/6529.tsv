2006-03-21T10:26:00.000Z	novem		this is driving me nuts
2006-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	yes its in synaptic i think its gnome-keyring
2006-03-21T10:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	i thought that was the name run apt-cache search gnome-keyring
2006-03-21T10:30:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	it is the correct name.
2006-03-21T10:31:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	yes, but Is there a manager app to change my keyring password, or anything? if so how do i get to it?
2006-03-21T10:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	or there is alway gnome-keyring-manager
2006-03-21T10:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring-manager
2006-03-21T10:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	make sure you have universe enabled
2006-03-22T15:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	sudo apt-get install gnome-art will install a log-in screen settings area
2006-03-22T15:24:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	ive tinkered with gnome-art but i cant seem to use it to fix the solid brown spash bg? i cant seem to figure it out, it could be inheriting the color from root, but its using the universal x11 session file?
2006-03-22T15:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	go to system>preff>splash screen if you mean the splash screen after you log in
2006-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	what splash are you talking about
2006-03-22T15:27:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	when i log into gnome, it displays a splash logo wich icons pass acrossed, behind this splash logo there is a base (hex/color) brown background
2006-03-22T15:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	yes download a new splash than open system>preff>splash screen and add it in there than set it on
2006-03-22T15:28:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	already have a new splash, already have it active, the splash screen itself isnt the problem
2006-03-22T15:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	the wallpaper?
2006-03-22T15:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	normal
2006-03-22T15:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	gnome cant load anything until gnome is loaded
2006-03-22T15:30:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	so where exactly is that ugly brown being defined?
2006-03-22T15:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	novem	i dont have a clue. i dont think that is something that you can change
2006-03-22T15:32:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	gnome is LOADING at this point, it is going through its presession etc
2006-03-22T15:34:00.000Z	novem	gnomefreak	its brown because of the theme ubuntu threw in with dapper
