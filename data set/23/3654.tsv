2008-02-23T12:20:00.000Z	Hewus		Hi. Anyone know the difference between "free" and "available" disk space on my ext3 partition? There seems to be several GB of space I cannot access!
2008-02-23T12:21:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	the filesystem has to use space for stuff too
2008-02-23T12:22:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	so you can't take up all the space on the drive, or the filesystem wont be able to do what it needs to do
2008-02-23T12:22:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	I'm missing 7GB on one partition. Any idea what it's being used for, and how I could go about recovering it?
2008-02-23T12:22:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	I would have thought a few MB was reasonable for this purpose. FAT doesn't seem to have the same issue
2008-02-23T12:24:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	that is actually what I'd try
2008-02-23T12:25:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	I'd go into the options for that partition, and see if it'll let you scale down the space saved for root
2008-02-23T12:26:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	neither. but I have a lot of space around on my system. My 200GB partition has 10GB I cannot use, which I think is unreasonable. Any idea where these options are?
2008-02-23T12:26:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	but usaully they do things like that for good reason, if the partition is your root partition, I wouldn't use up too much of the space allocated for the root
2008-02-23T12:27:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	it happens on every partition, on creation. I have about 6 ext3 partitions over my drives
2008-02-23T12:27:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	and it's not really important for partitions not system critical
2008-02-23T12:28:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	I have partitions just full of data (like the 200GB one) and that 10GB could really be useful :S. Sorry, where are these partition options?
2008-02-23T12:29:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	my root partition isn't an issue, I'm happy for it to have its allocated space. It's my data partitions which are much larger that I need the space for.
2008-02-23T12:29:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	well, when you make an ext3 filesystem, that's where I generally set that kinda stuff and don't really mess with it after that, but it's probably
2008-02-23T12:30:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	yes. I've just made some more using gparted.
2008-02-23T12:33:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	no a lost and found folder wont
2008-02-23T12:34:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	did you make sure you didn't allocate any root only space?
2008-02-23T12:34:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	I just made one in gparted, as simple as it can be done
2008-02-23T12:35:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	it should be one of the filesystem options when you make a partition in gparted
2008-02-23T12:37:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	no options about space being allocated to root, just what type of filesystem and its size
2008-02-23T12:39:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	hang out for a minaute unless someone else chimes in on this, I'm in gparted myself, but I gotta wait until I can get gparted to recognize this SATA HD before I can get into filesystem options
2008-02-23T12:40:00.000Z	thundercles	Hewus	what IM do you have? I'll give you a sn for it and I can try and find out for you from some of my friends on IM the answer to your question, I just don't use gparted very much to make partitions and filesystems
2008-02-23T12:43:00.000Z	Hewus	thundercles	jabber/XMPP and msn
