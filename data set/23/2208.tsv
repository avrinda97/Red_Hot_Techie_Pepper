2009-08-06T06:40:00.000Z	Loafers		Is this right? GTK themes change panels & buttons?  Then what does window manager themes change?
2009-08-06T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 window decoration normally.
2009-08-09T02:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 some machines i got show uop the flash drive as usb-fdd, some show it as a usb-hdd, some show it as a actual hard drive. perhaps it showing up as somthing else.
2009-08-09T02:38:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	The only things listed are Cd-rom, usb-fdd, ide, and lsb120
2009-08-09T02:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 ive also had usb-flash disks setup in some odd way that they would boot on 4 out of my 5 machines.. but that 5th one.. was problematic.. then other flash drives worked find on that one... Test it out on other machines.. see if it boots on any others.
2009-08-09T02:39:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	Yes it does work on other machines, except just that particular machine
2009-08-09T02:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 on one box. I had to enable the 'lba' flag on the  flash drive to get it to boot.
2009-08-09T02:40:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	How do I enable the lba flag?
2009-08-09T02:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 gparted can do that
2009-08-09T02:41:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	Ok thanks :) I'll give it a try
2009-08-09T03:08:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	Hi, I tried the LBA method and it did not work as well.  I think the computer is the problem since it won't even detect bootable cdrom as well, which is weird because i triple checked the boot order and it still fails to detect.  Maybe the bios is really old?  Its Award BIOS

2009-08-09T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 at lesat you narrowed down the issue..  could try some diffrent usb ports on the machine.. but that may not help.
2009-08-09T04:34:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	Yes I tried that as well :/ still same problem
2009-08-09T04:35:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	There was this primary master slave thingy maybe that's it?
2009-08-09T04:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	  that wouldent affect usb drives.
2009-08-09T04:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 try disabling all the other drives in teh bios perhaps?
2009-08-09T04:35:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	okay i'll give that a try
2009-08-09T04:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 not that will do miuch good.. but it might  at lesat be a test.
2009-08-09T04:35:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	Ok thanks :)
2009-09-08T00:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 best way to answer that is try out  an alpha5 cd..
2009-09-08T00:06:00.000Z	Loafers	Dr_Willis	ok thanks
2009-09-08T00:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Loafers	 because untill you try.. any answer you get on IRC.. is just a guess.
