2006-04-06T16:04:00.000Z	PetterT		OK I'm going nuts now... fresh Ubuntu 5.10 install and I just can't get the networking to work. First I thought it was the UTC=yes/no problem mentioned in the bug database, but that didn't help. I just can't get dhclient to work properly. Help!
2006-04-06T16:04:00.000Z	PetterT		iface eth0 inet dchp
2006-04-06T16:05:00.000Z	PetterT		But I did try manually running dhclient, multiple times...
2006-04-06T16:05:00.000Z	PetterT		It just didn't help.
2006-04-06T16:06:00.000Z	PetterT		Is it possible to pass on the UTC=yes option to dhclient from the command line?
2006-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	PetterT		No I don't have an IP there
2006-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	PetterT		Well I'm booted in WinXP now of course
2006-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	PetterT		Otherwise I'd have a hard time being on IRC, with no networking under Ubuntu :-)
2006-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	why not just set a static ip for starters?
2006-04-06T16:08:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	how didnt it help? could you ping the router? could you ping the net? what options did you supply??
2006-04-06T16:09:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	erm, you need to supply a little more info to ifconfig
2006-04-06T16:11:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.42 gateway 192.168.1.0 up  (if 192.168.1.0 is indeed your router ip)
2006-04-06T16:12:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	^^
2006-04-06T16:14:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	set the router gateway first, then we can sort out the lan stuff once you can irc on it.
2006-04-06T16:14:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	wait
2006-04-06T16:44:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	i may have led you astray
2006-04-06T16:46:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	erm, what commands did you run, and what was the output?
2006-04-06T16:48:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	and route output looked good/
2006-04-06T16:48:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	try an older kernl.
2006-04-06T16:49:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	stick with sarge! :P
2006-04-06T16:50:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	but really, try an older/newer kernel. i would even suggest trying and seeing how the debian 2.6 image goes.
2006-04-06T16:51:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	its modprobe with 2.6, and yes. modprobe -r, but i doubt it will change anything.
2006-04-06T16:52:00.000Z	liable	PetterT	what version of debian worked with the card?
