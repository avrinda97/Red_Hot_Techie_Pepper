2008-05-22T23:59:00.000Z	JontyO		Who asked for me to type dmesg?
2008-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	it was simplexio
2008-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	where did you put your dmesg output?
2008-05-23T00:02:00.000Z	JontyO	damg	I am getting /sbin/modprobe abnormal exit
2008-05-23T00:03:00.000Z	JontyO	damg	and cat /proc/partitions shows nothing (no hdd detected?)
2008-05-23T00:04:00.000Z	JontyO	damg	whats the | tool
2008-05-23T00:07:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	forgot about that :E
2008-05-23T00:08:00.000Z	JontyO	damg	nothing about SATA
2008-05-23T00:08:00.000Z	JontyO	damg	what would that look like
2008-05-23T00:09:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	hm, lemme see my dmesg, maybe I have something broken :)
2008-05-23T00:10:00.000Z	JontyO	damg	what would that look like
2008-05-23T00:14:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	is there anything about hda/sda?
2008-05-23T00:16:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	it should be somewhere between [12...] and [18...]
2008-05-23T00:27:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	you could provide boot options by pressing c in the boot menu
2008-05-23T00:28:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	wait a moment, one thing I do not know: you are on livecd and trying to install on a drive it does not detect or are you failing to boot into an installed system?
2008-05-23T00:32:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	are you on the same machine which fails to boot right now from the livecd? then paste the livecd dmesg log
2008-05-23T00:35:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	dmesg > log  and then copy the contents of log into http://paste.ubuntu.com
2008-05-23T00:35:00.000Z	JontyO	damg	its on another PC ...
2008-05-23T00:36:00.000Z	damg	JontyO	ah, I thought you rebooted from livecd. actually you could really boot from livecd on the broken machine and paste the dmesg.
