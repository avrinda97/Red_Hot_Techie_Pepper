2011-05-13T03:44:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	can you use gnome-system-monitor to see which program is making your system slow?
2011-05-13T03:44:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	ok then I have to tell you which one of it?
2011-05-13T03:45:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	and which season do I need to use?in safe mode it works well but it doesn't find anything just searching
2011-05-13T03:46:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	if you sort by cpu usage, can you find a program which is taking up most of ur cpu time?
2011-05-13T03:47:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	It can't open the terminal
2011-05-13T03:48:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	also, could be your ram is low so the system might be using swap
2011-05-13T03:48:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	no it doesn't I don't see any writing on the hard disk
2011-05-13T03:50:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	do you see any program which is eating up your cpu?
2011-05-13T03:50:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	I can't
2011-05-13T03:51:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	I think that the wireless program because it run well in safe mode
2011-05-13T03:52:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	hmm, I'm not sure then ;/
2011-05-13T03:52:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	what should I do?ask in the forums of ubuntu?
2011-05-13T03:53:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	you could try, there might also be someone in here who knows more about the problem
2011-05-13T04:05:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	if your /home directory is on a seperate partition, you can reinstall 10.10 w/o deleting your files/settings
2011-05-13T04:07:00.000Z	O_0	_jop	I can downgrade without connection to internet?
2011-05-13T04:08:00.000Z	_jop	O_0	you'll have to download the 10.10 CD
