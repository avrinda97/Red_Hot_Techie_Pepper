2011-05-26T14:42:00.000Z	guglu		when i switch on the PC, the login screen is not coming, just a blank black screen comes. it was all fine untill yesterday. (i did sudo apt-get upgrade yesterday, that seems to cause the issue)
2011-05-26T14:43:00.000Z	notostraca2	guglu	were you using Wubi?
2011-05-26T14:44:00.000Z	notostraca2		I remember reading about a bug in older versions of Wubi that meant you shouldn't upgrade the grub package
2011-05-26T14:44:00.000Z	guglu		i dont even know what Wubi is
