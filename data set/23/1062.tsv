2010-09-22T23:39:00.000Z	mananan		ActionParsnip... thanks anyways.. anyone used a usb video grabber to capture video on ubuntu?
2010-09-22T23:41:00.000Z	mananan		cheese just says no device found!
2010-09-22T23:42:00.000Z	mananan		so is there any software for video grabbers or any way to get my machine to recognise it?
2010-09-22T23:45:00.000Z	Jebby	mananan	If you can try to find the 'chipset' you adapter uses, then you can search for generic linux support options. It might get you further than by searching by product name
2010-09-22T23:46:00.000Z	mananan		jebby thanks... how would i find out what chipset it is? it is only recognised and not named as a usb device
2010-09-22T23:54:00.000Z	Jebby	mananan	what exactly is this usb adapter, Make, Model etc?
2010-09-22T23:55:00.000Z	mananan		silvercrest usb video grabber 'vg2010'
2010-09-23T00:03:00.000Z	Jebby	mananan	what does lsusb command show u in terminal
2010-09-23T00:04:00.000Z	Jebby	mananan	usb adapter must be in first obviously
2010-09-23T00:07:00.000Z	mananan		jebby for the device itself it just shows = Bus 001 Device 014: ID 1d19:6105
2010-09-23T00:11:00.000Z	Jebby	mananan	the actual manufacturer is Dexatek Technology. http://www.dexatek.com Still cant confirm linux support
2010-09-23T00:11:00.000Z	mananan		jebby.. excellent dude
2010-09-23T00:14:00.000Z	mananan		jebby that site is a bit crap
2010-09-23T00:22:00.000Z	Jebby	mananan	I only see linux support for 1D19:1101  DK DVB-T Dongle , 1D19:1102  DK mini DVB-T Dongle, and  1D19:1103  DK 5217 DVB-T Dongle. I think your outta luck
