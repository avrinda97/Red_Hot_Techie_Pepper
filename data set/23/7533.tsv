2005-10-29T06:54:00.000Z	Thunderguy		Hey, cool that is my favorite desktop, sure I will.
2005-10-29T06:56:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	What are you trying to do? startx uses .xinitrx|.xsession
2005-10-29T06:58:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	Trying to get any GUI to work.
2005-10-29T06:59:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	What's the problem? Gnome hanging?
2005-10-29T07:00:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	Gnome hanging, then I installed KDE and KDE hangs, and I installed fluxbox and it hangs to.
2005-10-29T07:01:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Try letting gnome hang for some 10 minutes... Then it might continue... (I have the same issue and it bugs the crap out of me... I think something is waiting for something that doesn't happen and times out after ~10 minutes.)
2005-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	That sounds like a pretty aweful setup
2005-10-29T07:03:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Indeed, but try it - at least you'll know if gnome is b0rked or not.
2005-10-29T07:03:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	I'll let you know if I ever figure out what causes it... But right now I'm more concerned that my dbus is messed up. :-/
2005-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Interesting... I got the same error in my .xsession-errors
2005-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	ah really?
2005-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Yeah, and something "Cannot create /dev/X"...
2005-10-29T07:27:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Weird... Have you tried after a reboot?
2005-10-29T07:28:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	I don't think I want to reboot now, things actually work.
2005-10-29T07:28:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	Sadly I will be forced to, hurricane will shut me down by tonight for sure.
2005-10-29T07:29:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Hehe, if I log out now and back in, then it'll work fine... If I reboot, I'll have to wait the usual 10 minutes. :-/
2005-10-29T07:29:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	I hope yours work better than mine then. :)
2005-10-29T07:30:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	I did do one thing, in my hosts file I had 127.0.0.1 localhost home, I put in 2 seperate lines 127.0.0.1 localhost, then 127.0.0.1 home, I don't think that would do anything.. hrm, but it worked after I did that.
2005-10-29T07:30:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	I guess my faith has healed the machine o.O I was never religious but I am now.
2005-10-29T07:30:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Hmm.. I do get a "hostname lookup failure for 'localhost'" in the .xsession-errors...
2005-10-29T07:30:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Bow down for the awesome power of ... uhm ... /etc/hosts...
2005-10-29T07:31:00.000Z	Thunderguy	madsen	Yeah, I shall memorize the hosts config file now.
2005-10-29T07:31:00.000Z	madsen	Thunderguy	Hehe
