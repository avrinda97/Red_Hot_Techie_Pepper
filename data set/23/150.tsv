2012-05-20T03:36:00.000Z	Topcat		hello, having trouble finding help with this virtualbox issue it seems new. I can't use the seamless mode for the ununtu 12.04 guest OS and vbox 4.1.14 in win7. guest additions installed. Anyone have suggestions?
2012-05-20T03:38:00.000Z	terafl0ps	Topcat	what happens when you switch to seamless mode?
2012-05-20T03:39:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	it goes into fullscreen like mode but I suspect it's half enabled or something as the mouse cursor is still the win type not ubuntus
2012-05-20T03:40:00.000Z	terafl0ps	Topcat	as luck would have it I run Ubuntu 12.04 with that same VirtualBox version and I have a Win7 professional VM.
2012-05-20T03:41:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	I think you're doing the reverse to me by the sounds of it.  win7 is my main Host OS
2012-05-20T03:42:00.000Z	terafl0ps	Topcat	You're right.  I am doing the reverse of you.
2012-05-20T03:43:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	so close ;)
2012-05-20T03:43:00.000Z	terafl0ps		Seamless mode still won't change the mouse cursor though.
2012-05-20T03:44:00.000Z	terafl0ps		At least not until you move the cursor over a seamless window that is running a windows application that changes the cursor.
2012-05-20T03:44:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	it's as if the background is not being disabled
2012-05-20T03:45:00.000Z	Topcat		does unity havea  3d and 2d mode ?
2012-05-20T03:45:00.000Z	terafl0ps		You mean your gnome background?
2012-05-20T03:46:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	yes. In seamless I should be able to see that only the program windows.
2012-05-20T03:46:00.000Z	Topcat		shouldnt*
2012-05-20T03:48:00.000Z	Topcat		in vbox should ubuntu list the GFX driver as Unknown?
2012-05-20T03:48:00.000Z	terafl0ps	Topcat	I have a Linux VM I could try seamless on, but it's not Ubuntu...
2012-05-20T03:48:00.000Z	terafl0ps		It might be a virtualbox bug.
2012-05-20T03:48:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	if you could just give it a quick go that should help
2012-05-20T03:50:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	4.1.14 must be very new out I will roll the vbox additions back to 4.1.12 that's i nthe repo
2012-05-20T03:51:00.000Z	terafl0ps		I tried it with Centos 5.8 on top of Ubuntu in seamless mode and it hid the CentOS guest's background for me.
2012-05-20T03:52:00.000Z	terafl0ps		However, I wouldn't want to use this because I quickly ran into an issue where I couldn't click on Ubuntu windows while it was running.
2012-05-20T03:52:00.000Z	terafl0ps		All of my mouse clicks were going to the VM until I pulled it out of seamless mode.
2012-05-20T03:54:00.000Z	Topcat	terafl0ps	ok thanks for trying, my centos 6.2 doesn't let me seamless mode currently, maybe I'm missing a driver its quite fresh.
