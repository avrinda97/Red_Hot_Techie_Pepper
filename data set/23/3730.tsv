2008-02-05T00:34:00.000Z	Dante__		Anybody that can spare 5min to try and help me with my wireless network?
2008-02-05T00:34:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	what do you have, elaborate on your setup, and what you have done so far to test?
2008-02-05T00:39:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	do you see the dialog window or should I write it out here?
2008-02-05T00:39:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	I do not see it,  write it out here, but limit to 3 lines,
2008-02-05T00:44:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	Any idea on what I should try next?
2008-02-05T00:47:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	lspci  and look in the list if your wifi card is detected
2008-02-05T00:50:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	08:0a.0 Networkcontroller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g] 802.11g Wireless LAN controller (rev 02). Does that mean its on? Or just detected?
2008-02-05T00:50:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	it meant it is detected
2008-02-05T00:51:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	Is there some way to see if its on?
2008-02-05T00:55:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	if you see it in lspci, it is ON
2008-02-05T00:56:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	really? then im lost. I have no idea what do to next. Arent there some sort of wireless manager that is able to scan for connection instead of me writing a specific one?
2008-02-05T00:57:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	the thing is you are one of those lucky many to be using the dreaded broadcom chip 43xxx.
2008-02-05T00:58:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	Which means im screwed? Or is there a way?
2008-02-05T00:58:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	you can use restrictred drivers for it or maybe ndiswrapper, basically the issue is the driver for bcm43xx chips
2008-02-05T00:59:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	you may have to google for it...let see if the bot has any
2008-02-05T00:59:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	Ok. I installed the ndiswrapper for my card but I dont know were to manage ndiswrapper
2008-02-05T01:01:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	Should I (and how) uninstall ndiswrapper and WiFi radar before using the guide you linked me?
2008-02-05T01:02:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	follow that guide,  yeah may as well remove ndiswrapper and follow that link suggestions
2008-02-05T01:05:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	You have been very helpful. Thank you :) But I have a minor question. I have to activate some drivers that arent in use and I see ATI accelerated Graphics driver on the list. Should I activate?
2008-02-05T01:06:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	i dont know if you must activate those ATI, those are for video not for your wifi
2008-02-05T01:06:00.000Z	amenado	Dante__	so if it was me, I would not activate ATI lest I have to use them
2008-02-05T01:07:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	Okok. Ill worry about that later on :)
2008-02-05T01:44:00.000Z	Dante__	amenado	I tried that guide. I cant remove the ndiswrapper and when I scan for networks I get "No scan results"
