2010-12-16T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	run: dpkg -l | less    and review
2010-12-16T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	remove openoffice and install abiword if you only use write
2010-12-16T22:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	remove vino and vinagre if you never use them (VNC stuff)
2010-12-16T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	remove compiz and use openbox for a faster OS as well as less space used
2010-12-16T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	if you use unity then it will NEED mutter
2010-12-16T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	basically openoffice will get you 300Mb back
2010-12-16T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	keep your kernels to just ONE kernel, if you have more than 1 kernel then remove the unnecessary ones to keep maximum space
2010-12-16T22:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	if you set your browser cache to be stored in /tmp it will be stored in RAM and be lost on reboot but who cares, its web cache
2010-12-16T22:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	do you have 3d accelleration?
2010-12-16T22:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	cool
2010-12-16T22:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	is it at a particular point in the OS running or is it random?
2010-12-16T22:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	try pressing ALT+F2 and run:  metacity --replace     is it any better?
2010-12-16T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	just to test for now
2010-12-16T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	no, it REMOVES compiz and makes metacity your WM
2010-12-16T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	is the CPU usage any less?
2010-12-16T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	ok you can switch compiz back in if you want
2010-12-16T22:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	are you using a netboook?
2010-12-16T22:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Free_Speech	latest BIOS? You could try the xorg-edgers PPA but its VERY experimental and may cause issues
