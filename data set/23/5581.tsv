2007-04-29T16:43:00.000Z	larryone		I'm having dvd drive problems. one dvd caused the system to hang, the other created kernel errors in the syslog. Is it likely reseating the drive's ide cables will help at all?
2007-04-29T16:43:00.000Z	larryone		anyone?

2007-04-29T12:36:00.000Z	troxor	larryone	if it's a video dvd, just do something like `mplayer /dev/dvd` to play it (not sure about the graphical apps, but you still won't need to know the fstype to play it)
