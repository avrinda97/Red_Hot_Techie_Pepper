2007-04-22T14:27:00.000Z	elsni		hi, i installed ubuntu on my laptop and sound does not work (snd-hda-intel) what can I do?
2007-04-22T14:27:00.000Z	delire	elsni	sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel'
2007-04-22T14:27:00.000Z	delire	elsni	run that command in a terminal and then see if you can play sound.
2007-04-22T14:30:00.000Z	elsni	delire	nothing happens,no error, no sound. Volume is max
2007-04-22T14:30:00.000Z	delire	elsni	what kind of sound are you trying to play?
2007-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	delire	elsni	what is the output of 'sudo modprobe -l | grep snd_hda_intel'
2007-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	elsni	delire	internet radio
2007-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	delire	elsni	don't try that, try a wav file or mp3
2007-04-22T14:36:00.000Z	elsni	delire	i tried mp3 and ogg, but totem player hangs
2007-04-22T14:42:00.000Z	delire	elsni	this problem should be fixed soon. it's important you report a bug in that page.
2007-04-22T14:38:00.000Z	elsni	delire	Rhythmbox does not play, too
2007-04-22T14:41:00.000Z	delire	elsni	i don't know what's happening with sound on your system. you'd do well to search in the forums. i see this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/83015
2007-04-22T14:41:00.000Z	delire	elsni	you should add a post to that page
2007-04-22T14:41:00.000Z	delire	elsni	it's numbers that get bugs fixed..
2007-04-22T14:42:00.000Z	elsni	delire	ok thank you
2007-04-22T14:42:00.000Z	delire	elsni	sorry i can't help. many people are having problems with this card in Feisty.
2007-04-22T14:43:00.000Z	delire	elsni	also see this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=414827
2007-04-22T14:45:00.000Z	elsni	delire	thank you very much, i'll try!
2007-04-22T14:46:00.000Z	delire	elsni	good for you my friend. be a little patient and all will be well. the Ubuntu devs have to work hard to try to get things working on every configuration.
2007-04-22T14:49:00.000Z	elsni	delire	yes, i can imagine. I was just impressed that nearly everything else worked out of the box, even wlan!
2007-04-22T14:49:00.000Z	delire	elsni	yes there's a high hit rate with this release. still a few rough edges though. with some help from driver developers we'll get there..
2007-04-22T14:53:00.000Z	elsni	delire	yes, I only dicovered one more issue: wake up does not work after suspend to ram. And going to suspend mode takes very long time. But I dont use this normally, so I dont care.
2007-04-22T14:54:00.000Z	elsni	delire	so thank you again, I must reboot ;-)
