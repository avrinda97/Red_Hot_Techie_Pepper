2006-10-13T08:45:00.000Z	kyle__		alright so my Firefox installation is broken and its effecting synaptic, update manager.. this is the error i'm getting "E: /var/cache/apt/archives/firefox_1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-0ubuntu5.10.3_i386.deb: error creating symbolic link `./usr/bin/firefox'
2006-10-13T08:45:00.000Z	kyle__		"
2006-10-13T08:46:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	do file /usr/bin/firefox and post the output
2006-10-13T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	open a terminal and do this "file /usr/bin/firefox" tell me what it says...
2006-10-13T08:48:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	and after that
2006-10-13T08:50:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	sweet
2006-10-13T08:50:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	that should fix firefox also
2006-10-13T08:52:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	I would assume that the /usr/lib/firefox directory is messed up
2006-10-13T09:07:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	see if there is anything in the firefox lib directory, ls /usr/lib/firefox/
2006-10-13T09:08:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	there's a bunch of stuff in that folder
2006-10-13T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	do /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
2006-10-13T09:09:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	it does nothing
2006-10-13T09:12:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	do "file /usr/lib/firefox/firefox"
2006-10-13T09:15:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	what was the output for file /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
2006-10-13T09:15:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	/usr/lib/firefox/firefox: Bourne shell script text executable
2006-10-13T09:16:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	that is odd, how the symbolic link could be broken, I have no idea. It is there, the symbolic link shouldn't be broken.
2006-10-13T09:17:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	thanks
2006-10-13T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	when you did ls /usr/lib/firefox, were there 33 things listed?
2006-10-13T09:19:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	yes... what happened i think is.. i was following the instructions for installing the NewVersion of firefox from the ubuntu.org wiki and something went wrong so i never got 1.5.0.4 .. 0.7 installed and now 1.0.7 isn't working
2006-10-13T09:19:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	you are using breezy?
2006-10-13T09:19:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	so i was instructed to upgrade to dapper, that's when i found out the symbollic link error
2006-10-13T09:20:00.000Z	bruenig	kyle__	ah, well, these were all intended for dapper. I don't remember breezy well enough to instruct that. I assume they would be similar but perhaps not
2006-10-13T09:22:00.000Z	kyle__	bruenig	do you know any instructions for upgrading to dapper
