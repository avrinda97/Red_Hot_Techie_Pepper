2008-07-31T11:57:00.000Z	Bloodhound		can anyone help me with setting up a ftp server at ubuntu =)
2008-07-31T11:57:00.000Z	Bloodhound		just in harde no server edition =)
2008-07-31T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	It's the same instructions.  But first, what will you be doing with said ftp server?
2008-07-31T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	Right, but to yourself? or what?
2008-07-31T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	since, if its just for your own use/people you know, ther's a more secure/robust (and easier to set up) method.  sftp
2008-07-31T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	sftp is as easy as installing openssh-server... and, then you're done.
2008-07-31T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	it will use regular user accounts, so create users for your friends (through users and groups)
2008-07-31T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	To connect, you use any sftp client.  Almost any graphical FTP client can do sftp.  Filezilla is one (which works in both Linux and Windows)
2008-07-31T12:00:00.000Z	Bloodhound	Flannel	oke =) sounds great how to get it? with synaptec?
2008-07-31T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	yeah, install "openssh-server"
2008-07-31T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	And then you just need to make sure you forward port 22 on your router to your computer.
2008-07-31T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	Right.  it does both.  ssh and sftp (and scp)
2008-07-31T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	sftp (and scp) are done through ssh, basically.
2008-07-31T12:03:00.000Z	Bloodhound	Flannel	 how do i set it up?
2008-07-31T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	That'll be through regular folder permissions.  Basically, create their users, and if you want to share with them, add everyone to some new group, make a new folder, make it owned by that group, etc. (actually, theres a hundred ways to set this up, just remember, its through regular permissions)
2008-07-31T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	yeah
2008-07-31T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	well, all of *your* files
2008-07-31T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	well, you can view files outside of the home folder from your regular account
2008-07-31T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	Basically, open up nautilus, everything you can browse to from there, you'll be able to browse through with sftp.
2008-07-31T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	I don't know if I'd call it a security risk.  But, there's the potential for a security risk I guess, sure.  If you have strong passwords you'll be fine.  If you're worried about brute force, you might want to look into something like DenyHosts, that'll lock someone out after they fail logging in X times.
2008-07-31T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	If you do just want to have anonymous ftp, that's fairly easy to set up too: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/ftp-server.html
2008-07-31T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	I mean, sure, technically anyone can log in as you (assuming they get your password) and do whatever.  Installing SSH is by definition more dangerous than not.
2008-07-31T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Bloodhound	I don't want to mislead you
