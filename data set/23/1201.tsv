2011-07-11T19:29:00.000Z	extraclassic	bfri	get the ip address of a proxy on the list and manually configure proxy settings in your browser
2011-07-11T19:30:00.000Z	bfri	extraclassic	ok thats the part i'm havint trouble the configuration
2011-07-11T19:31:00.000Z	extraclassic	bfri	in firefox its edit->preferences->advanced->network->settings

2011-07-11T19:35:00.000Z	extraclassic	bfri	manually configure and put in an ip address
2011-07-11T19:36:00.000Z	bfri	extraclassic	...there are a lot of fields in that setting nowhere does it ask for ip address
2011-07-11T19:36:00.000Z	bfri	extraclassic	 plus how do i know what IP to put?
2011-07-11T19:37:00.000Z	extraclassic	bfri	if you ping a url it'll tell you the ip address
2011-07-11T19:37:00.000Z	bfri	extraclassic	- could i bother you to take this step by step with me
2011-07-11T19:40:00.000Z	extraclassic	bfri	go to that site i sent and ping some urls from the US to get an ip and the proxies there work over port 80
