2007-10-03T16:34:00.000Z	olga		how to use alsaconf on ubuntu?
2007-10-03T16:36:00.000Z	minimec	olga	I think alsaconf has been removed in feisty
2007-10-03T16:36:00.000Z	olga	minimec	true
2007-10-03T16:36:00.000Z	olga	minimec	and I need to use it
2007-10-03T16:37:00.000Z	minimec	olga	What do you want to do?
2007-10-03T16:37:00.000Z	olga	minimec	force alsa to support microphone
2007-10-03T16:37:00.000Z	minimec	olga	Try gstreamer-properties
2007-10-03T16:39:00.000Z	olga	minimec	same - no sound from mic
2007-10-03T16:39:00.000Z	olga	minimec	I thought that it's wrong kernel driver
2007-10-03T16:39:00.000Z	minimec	olga	But the device is visible in gstreamer-properties?
2007-10-03T16:40:00.000Z	olga	minimec	ubuntu uses snd_intel and i want to use snd_intel8x0
2007-10-03T16:40:00.000Z	minimec	olga	But is snd_intel8x0 visible in gstreamer-properties?
2007-10-03T16:41:00.000Z	olga	minimec	it loads only snd_hda_intel kernel module
2007-10-03T16:42:00.000Z	minimec	olga	So the driver is not loaded.... What kind of device is that? Is it something like a usb webcam with integrated soundcard (mic)?
2007-10-03T16:43:00.000Z	olga	minimec	Intel ICH7 sound card in HP nx7400 notebook
2007-10-03T16:44:00.000Z	minimec	olga	Hmmm... That shouldn't be a problem...
2007-10-03T16:44:00.000Z	olga	minimec	but is - on WinXP it works great
2007-10-03T16:44:00.000Z	minimec	olga	Should work on Linux too.
2007-10-03T16:45:00.000Z	olga	minimec	I want to use sn_intel8x0 which works on my toshiba with gentoo
2007-10-03T16:45:00.000Z	olga	minimec	but i don't have any idea how to do it without alsaconf
2007-10-03T16:45:00.000Z	minimec	olga	So if you blacklisted the driver you don't want to load?
