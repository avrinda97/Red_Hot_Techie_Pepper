2009-02-04T00:36:00.000Z	fiftyone		i have since removed it
2009-02-04T00:37:00.000Z	fiftyone		slart i wish someone told me that before! i knew it was stupid to play with it
2009-02-04T00:37:00.000Z	fiftyone		lol
2009-02-04T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	hehe.. that cube is alluring.. but you can play with compiz now.. it's even shinier
2009-02-04T00:37:00.000Z	fiftyone	Slart	that damn cube!
2009-02-04T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	you've tried using the restricted drivers thingy?
2009-02-04T00:38:00.000Z	fiftyone	Slart	well basically. i think it just deleted my default settings. i have a nice gui now everything looks fine just cant use the effects
2009-02-04T00:39:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	and you're using the binary nvidia drivers?
2009-02-04T00:39:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	run "glxgears -info" in a terminal and check the top of the output
2009-02-04T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	try setting 4 horizontal desktops
2009-02-04T03:33:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	in the first section in the settings manager
2009-02-04T03:38:00.000Z	fiftyone	Slart	how do you change the cap and dome?
2009-02-04T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	ask in #compiz-fusion, that's where the bling bling people hang out
2009-02-04T03:39:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	I have no idea myself... I don't even have the cube enabled any more
2009-02-04T03:39:00.000Z	fiftyone	Slart	lol i'm not a bling bling guy im just a cuber :D
2009-02-04T03:39:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	I'm pretty sure you'll find some cuber-friends in that channel too =)
2009-02-10T22:39:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	I use quod libet.. it works for me
2009-02-10T22:40:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	then tell us what kind of media player you want? something big and shiny with lots of extras like amarok? or are you running it on a mini-itx server hidden in your car? you could use mpd in that case.. we don't know what you want
2009-02-10T22:42:00.000Z	Slart	fiftyone	then why didn't you say that from the beginning.. would have saved us all a lot of wear and tear on the keyboard =).. look at audacious.. it's winamp but without the media library.. I have no idea what to do about the bluetooth headset.. bluetooth isn't working for me at all on intrepid
2009-02-10T22:44:00.000Z	fiftyone	Slart	its just a usb not bluetooth
2009-02-10T22:45:00.000Z	fiftyone	Slart	its a normal usb headphone no idea why i cant swch from default
