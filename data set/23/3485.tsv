2010-06-20T03:04:00.000Z	jkalex05		hey guys for dual booting ubuntu on windows 7 do I do a normal install like I would have done on vista
2010-06-20T03:04:00.000Z	jkalex05		windows installed first
2010-06-20T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	install win7 to a portion of the space, if you don't use 100% of the disk space for the windows partition you can avoid the whole resizing regmerall
2010-06-20T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	you will then have free unpartitioned space and ubuntu will be able to install to it
2010-06-20T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	win7 is installed to a partition.  I believe win7 can resize its own partition if you havent left free space
2010-06-20T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	yes, you can resize your windows partition in windows7. This will give you space to throw linux on
2010-06-20T03:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	it can be both
2010-06-20T03:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	some situations lean towards command line but there are a lot of guis for stuff
2011-01-09T22:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	try it without desktop effects if you use them
2011-01-09T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	which video chip?
2011-01-09T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	using proprietary driver?
2011-01-09T23:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	try: sudo mkdir /etc/adobe; echo "OverrideGPUValidation=true" | sudo tee /etc/adobe/mms.cfg
2011-01-09T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	you may also want to add this to /etc/X11/xorg.conf : http://pastie.org/1443106
2011-01-09T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	makes flash a lot nicer :)
2011-01-09T23:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	you will be using the open driver then
2011-01-09T23:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	sure, they help flash be smoother
2011-01-09T23:19:00.000Z	jkalex05	ActionParsnip	you told me to add some commands to /etc/X11/xorg.conf how do i do that?
2011-01-09T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf   add the lines and restart X server (or PC) to applyu
2011-01-09T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	http://pastie.org/1443155
2011-01-09T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	sure, use: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf   to get write access
2011-01-09T23:25:00.000Z	jkalex05	ActionParsnip	whats the command in nano to save the file?
2011-01-09T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	CTRL+X; Press Y, Press ENTER
2011-01-11T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkalex05	use the 1-2-3 app from pendrivelinux or unetbootin
