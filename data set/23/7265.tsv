2005-10-18T06:35:00.000Z	basvg		hi guys, during the install of breezy I had a nice graphical bootsplash.... but now that the install is completely finished I noticed that the text scrolls by again
2005-10-18T06:35:00.000Z	basvg		does anyone know how to get the graphical bootsplash back?
2005-10-18T06:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	hm, that shouldn't have happened
2005-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	basvg	apokryphos	what shouldn't have happened?
2005-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	do you have usplash? dpkg -l|grep usplash  ...gives?
2005-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	you should still have the usplash, that is.
2005-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	basvg		lemme check
2005-10-18T06:36:00.000Z	basvg	apokryphos	it claims that is installed (0.1-22)...
2005-10-18T06:37:00.000Z	basvg	apokryphos	perhaps I should reinstall (apt-get --reinstall install usplash) ?
2005-10-18T06:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	nope; that sounds right
2005-10-18T06:38:00.000Z	basvg	apokryphos	it seems that usplash doesn't have a man-page.. any thoughts on where I Can start looking?
2005-10-18T06:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	try doing a sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-`uname -r`
2005-10-18T06:40:00.000Z	basvg	apokryphos	ah, that claims `searching for splash image .... none found`
2005-10-18T06:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	that actually doesn't mean it doesn't work, as far as I know -- mine has always said that (and it has for others too), while it still works.
2005-10-18T06:42:00.000Z	basvg		I mean the nice ubuntu logo displayed on the center of the screen while the <service> [ok]  messages scroll by
2005-10-18T06:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	see if it works now
2005-10-18T06:43:00.000Z	basvg		the dpkg -L camed up with a /usr/lib/something... that file exsits and has -rw--r--r-- permissions
2005-10-18T06:43:00.000Z	basvg	apokryphos	ok, before trying anything else I'll reboot
2005-10-18T06:44:00.000Z	basvg		yes!!
2005-10-18T06:44:00.000Z	basvg		the reconfigure thingy fixed it!
2005-10-18T06:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	basvg	excellent; thought so :)
2005-10-18T06:45:00.000Z	basvg	apokryphos	thanks buddy!
