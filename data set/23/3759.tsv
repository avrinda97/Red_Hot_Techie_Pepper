2008-01-29T08:46:00.000Z	Lurner		I used Audacity to record audio
2008-01-29T08:46:00.000Z	Lurner		did you install it yet ?
2008-01-29T08:47:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	yes, i have; it does not successfully record audio for me.
2008-01-29T08:47:00.000Z	wittyphotons		when i try it with my sound card's output as the input, all i get is a blank audio file from recording.
2008-01-29T08:48:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	do you know of any other options? or perhaps why audacity is not working for me.
2008-01-29T08:49:00.000Z	Lurner	wittyphotons	what happens when you try to record ?
2008-01-29T08:49:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	i seem to have one of those not-natively-supported sound cards, the intel ALC268. i had to run through some hoops to get sound on my machine at all.
2008-01-29T08:49:00.000Z	Lurner	wittyphotons	do you get an error message ?
2008-01-29T08:50:00.000Z	Lurner	wittyphotons	in audacity ,  you set the record source , line, micr.. etc . and then set the level
2008-01-29T08:50:00.000Z	Lurner		I've having difficulty using the deluge torrent client to create a seed. Has anyone done this ?
2008-01-29T08:50:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	when i try to record, i have to close any other programs using sound first, otherwise i get an error message or it simply doesn't even begin recording. but if i close everything but audacity first (i think it has to do with some codec being in use otherwise), i can record in audacity. like, i see the recoding taking place. but it is just silence being recorded.
2008-01-29T08:51:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	i've already gone into alsamixer and unmuted stuff and enabled capture mode on the appropriate tab.
2008-01-29T08:51:00.000Z	Lurner	wittyphotons	you might want to think about getting another sound card that is supported.. they are pretty inexpensive
2008-01-29T08:51:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	yeah, i set the record source to "ALSA: HDA Intel: AlC268 Analog"
2008-01-29T08:52:00.000Z	Lurner	wittyphotons	sounds like you've done everything correctly so far. That method works for me
2008-01-29T08:52:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	what do i do for a short term solution, though; i have a project that I need this capability for before thursday and i'm a college student who can't easily drive to altec's or wherever to pick one up.
2008-01-29T08:53:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	also, how difficult is the sound card replacement process? i'm not so great with hardware issues (hence my trouble here in the first place).
2008-01-29T08:54:00.000Z	Lurner	wittyphotons	sometimes there is no software solution.  .. Drive to altec ? I live in an urban area and can find cheapo remaindered/ used/grey market stores everywhere
2008-01-29T08:54:00.000Z	Lurner	wittyphotons	one screwdriver will do the job
2008-01-29T08:54:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	i just have no idea what sort of sound card I should be looking for, i guess. any particular brand or model that's supported?
2008-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	Lurner		a card from Creative labs is pretty much standard.. ESS cards are also popular and much cheaper
2008-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	Lurner		I've having difficulty using the deluge torrent client to create a seed. Has anyone done this ?
2008-01-29T09:01:00.000Z	wittyphotons	Lurner	btw thanks for your advice; i guess getting a new sound card is just the easiest solution
