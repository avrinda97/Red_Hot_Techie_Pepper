2006-11-20T11:48:00.000Z	tim167		when a program crashes, bug-reporter tool hangs my system even longer than necessary, how can I disable bug-repoter ?
2006-11-20T11:49:00.000Z	tim167		also, this computer becomes downright slow nowadays, compared to when it had windows on it.
2006-11-20T11:50:00.000Z	tim167		How do I optimize ubuntu (turn off all unnecesary processes etc...)
2006-11-20T11:50:00.000Z	tim167		?
2006-11-20T11:50:00.000Z	tim167		nah XP
2006-11-20T11:51:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	try the i686 kernel, and man updeate-rc
2006-11-20T11:52:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	is that suitable for a PIV thinkpad notebook ?
2006-11-20T11:52:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	is it an intel cpu?
2006-11-20T11:53:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	yes
2006-11-20T11:53:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	then yes, the 686 kernel will give you a little speed
2006-11-20T11:53:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	and how do I do that exactly ?
2006-11-20T11:53:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	use synaptic, look for the most current 686 kernel
2006-11-20T11:54:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	ok!
2006-11-20T12:00:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	I want to try the i686 kernel, and man update-rc, is that 'kernel-image...' in synaptic ?
2006-11-20T12:01:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	if you install in synaptic everything is added for you
2006-11-20T12:04:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	you're not compiling your own kernel are you?
2006-11-20T12:12:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	uname -a
2006-11-20T12:13:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	tell me what it says
2006-11-20T12:14:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	gues its ok then, :p
2006-11-20T12:14:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	if it says 686, you're good to go
2006-11-20T12:14:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	thanks! now maybe I'll try a lighter window manager
2006-11-20T12:15:00.000Z	tim167	kmaynard	and see if I can get this thing up to speed
2006-11-20T12:15:00.000Z	kmaynard	tim167	look at man updeate-rc   see if there's services you can disable...jsut dont overdo it
