2008-01-13T22:08:00.000Z	Cleanser23		I think it is because of a modified kernel, does anyone know where in the filesystem the kernel and its backups are?
2008-01-13T22:10:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	kernels are in /boot
2008-01-13T22:11:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	thanks
2008-01-13T22:12:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	all i see in boot is a grub folder and a buncha other files what is the kernel named
2008-01-13T22:12:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	vmlinuz usually
2008-01-13T22:12:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	thnks dude
2008-01-13T22:13:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	if it says vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-generic is that the real one or a modified one
2008-01-13T22:14:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	that is the current gutsy version
2008-01-13T22:27:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	root is disabled in ubuntu
2008-01-13T22:27:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	there is a way to enable it you know
2008-01-13T22:28:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	uh yeah, but it's not necessary, sudo -i would give a root shell ifyou needed it
2008-01-13T22:28:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	no it won't, because people in here are using Ubuntu with root disabled
2008-01-13T22:29:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	oh sorry i think it would be easier for some things
2008-01-13T22:29:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	ill shut up about root
2008-01-13T22:30:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	like I said, there's sudo -i for that... sigh
2008-01-13T22:31:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	yea but i like guis and sudo nautilus just doesnt cut it, ill eventually need to format
2008-01-13T22:31:00.000Z	astro76	Cleanser23	oh dear me, you should NEVER log into X as root, even Strangelv would say that I'm sure
2008-01-13T22:32:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	lol i never would log into X as root
2008-01-13T22:32:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	im not that stupid
2008-01-13T22:32:00.000Z	Cleanser23	astro76	what happens if you do?
