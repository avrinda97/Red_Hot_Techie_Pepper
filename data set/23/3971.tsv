2007-12-21T10:31:00.000Z	rainwalker	aram_	also, if you need to type names really fast, you can start typing and press Tab and it will complete it for you

2007-12-21T10:32:00.000Z	rainwalker	aram_	if yo need to type out someone's name, like "rainwalker", instead of typing out the whole word you can type "rain" and press tab and it will finish the word for you
