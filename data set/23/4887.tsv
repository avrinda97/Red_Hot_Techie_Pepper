2007-04-15T12:15:00.000Z	pokoko	ferronica	everything went well I guess. It was a problem with your dpkg subsystem because probably you failed to install/uninstall some package before and had corrupted the dpkg's local repository
2007-04-15T12:15:00.000Z	ferronica	pokoko	yes when install Gsteamer at that time system hans up and i restarted my computer.
2007-04-15T12:16:00.000Z	pokoko	ferronica	ok. :)
