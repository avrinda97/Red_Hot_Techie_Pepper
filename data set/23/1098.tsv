2010-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	piyushmishra		hi I am trying to make an app launcher. its runs from the terminal can I make some launcher that doesnt need launcher?
2010-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	piyushmishra		Dr_willis: I installed matlab and am trying to make a launcher for it
2010-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	piyushmishra		dr_willis: its not in the default location so the file from ubuntu help doesnt work
2010-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	where do you want to put your launcher ?
2010-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	piyushmishra	glebihan	desktop/panel
2010-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	what command do you use when you run matlab ?
2010-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	you can try using "gnome-terminal --command='matlab'" as the launcher's command
2010-09-11T11:06:00.000Z	piyushmishra	glebihan	it also keeps the terminal open
2010-09-11T11:07:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	yes, if matlab needs a terminal (for some weird reason), it will stay opened as long as matlab is running
2010-09-12T14:53:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	Ctrl+F11 should put any window into fullscreen
2010-09-12T14:55:00.000Z	piyushmishra	glebihan	not working
2010-09-12T14:55:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	maybe it works only with metacity
2010-09-12T14:57:00.000Z	piyushmishra	glebihan	I just added the shortcut to my keyboard shortcuts still doesnt work
2010-09-12T14:58:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	do you use compiz ?
2010-09-12T14:58:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	in that case, in ccsm, you can set a shortcut to toggle fullscreen in the "Extra WM Actions"
2010-09-12T14:59:00.000Z	piyushmishra	glebihan	where?
2010-09-12T15:00:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	run "ccsm", then in the "Window Management" section, you'll find "Extra WM Actions"
2010-09-12T15:02:00.000Z	piyushmishra	glebihan	in WM is see app switcher move window place windows put resize ring switcher scale shift switcher snapping windows static app switcher and window rules
2010-09-12T15:06:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	maybe this plugin is not part of compiz by default
2010-09-12T15:06:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	I'm looking to find which package provides it
2010-09-12T15:06:00.000Z	piyushmishra	glebihan	its ok my fullscreen will work
2010-09-12T15:06:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	ok nice
2010-09-12T15:06:00.000Z	glebihan	piyushmishra	how did you do ?
