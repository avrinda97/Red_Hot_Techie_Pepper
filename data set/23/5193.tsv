2007-01-22T06:27:00.000Z	Pobega		Who's current owner of the files?
2007-01-22T06:29:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: im back...with no results :(
2007-01-22T06:29:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	Aw, well...Is Gnome actually loading, or is it not working right
2007-01-22T06:30:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: what else can i do to fix that?
2007-01-22T06:30:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	I'm thinking.
2007-01-22T06:31:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	Can you log in with another WM?
2007-01-22T06:31:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: WM?
2007-01-22T06:33:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	What do you mean?
2007-01-22T06:34:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: i dont have a window manager
2007-01-22T06:34:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	Gnome is a Window Manager :P
2007-01-22T06:34:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: :P i have only Gnome
2007-01-22T06:35:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	You could always install another one for the time being, I won't be able to help you though; This problem is far beyond me.
2007-01-22T06:36:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: how can i install another one?
2007-01-22T06:36:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	Might I suggest downloading xfce4 through aptitude, it will use all of your Gnome programs well and will be good until you fix Gnomwe
2007-01-22T06:36:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: just that?
2007-01-22T06:37:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	Yeah, just download xfce4; Not xubuntu-desktop, since you're going back to Gnome when you're done.
2007-01-22T06:38:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: i also have a Partition Explorer that i can read and write to ubuntu partition what is the directory of gnome2 and where is located the default folder to try delete it?
2007-01-22T06:38:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	~/.gnome2
2007-01-22T06:38:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	But I suggest not deleting it
2007-01-22T06:39:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: if i rename it will be a problem?
2007-01-22T06:40:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	Yeah, since I'm not sure how much important stuff is there. You can always try it, of course.
2007-01-22T06:40:00.000Z	taraksias	Pobega	: ok thx
2007-01-22T06:40:00.000Z	Pobega	taraksias	Most likely won't do any permanent damage.
