2010-06-16T05:24:00.000Z	Phun5tar		I kinda tried to check permissions, what options should I give chmod?
2010-06-16T05:24:00.000Z	Phun5tar	Bodsda	I'd lay off the technicality, though
2010-06-16T05:25:00.000Z	Phun5tar	Bodsda	I say that because "technically" nothing is "deleted"
2010-06-16T05:25:00.000Z	Phun5tar		I am using "technical" in a different sense, sorry
2010-06-16T05:26:00.000Z	Phun5tar		damn
2010-06-16T05:27:00.000Z	Phun5tar		it was too much like stating the obvious for its own sake
2010-06-16T05:28:00.000Z	Phun5tar		oh, sorry
2010-06-16T05:29:00.000Z	Phun5tar		lol, "no worries"
2010-06-16T05:30:00.000Z	Phun5tar		manual removal has never been a problem
2010-06-16T05:30:00.000Z	Phun5tar		my problem is, specifically, with the Trash applet
2010-06-16T05:33:00.000Z	shoopdawoop	Phun5tar	did you completely remove everything in ~/.local/share/Trash/ ? and is the trash button still greyed out?
2010-06-16T05:33:00.000Z	Phun5tar		What could cause the Trash applet from deleting /root/.Local/shared/Trash?
2010-06-16T05:33:00.000Z	Phun5tar		yes
2010-06-16T05:33:00.000Z	Phun5tar		several times
2010-06-16T05:33:00.000Z	shoopdawoop	Phun5tar	I don't suppose you're logged in as root?
2010-06-16T05:34:00.000Z	Phun5tar		Trash has issues with a Root login?
2010-06-16T05:34:00.000Z	shoopdawoop	Phun5tar	I wouldn't know. never tried that
2010-06-16T05:34:00.000Z	Phun5tar		Well, I did accidentally install GDM without having any user accounts, and forcibly removed it via CLI
2010-06-16T05:35:00.000Z	Phun5tar		that's the only thing that I can understand changing the way Trash works
2010-06-16T05:35:00.000Z	Phun5tar		I remember using Trash as root before, but I've only noticed this because I ran out of space today and noticed this problem
2010-06-16T05:36:00.000Z	Phun5tar		it could have been "deleting" without deleting for a while, now
2010-06-16T05:38:00.000Z	shoopdawoop	Phun5tar	I really don't know what the problem is. just delete the trash directory for the user you're logged in with and check the permissions of the folder (should probably be 600)
