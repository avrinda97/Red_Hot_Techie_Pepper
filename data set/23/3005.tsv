2008-11-09T16:27:00.000Z	Don123		I don't know the protocols here but I have a question about monitor resolution.  Version 7.10 correctly detected my 1440x900 monitor but I made a fresh install of 8.04.1 and it gives me a choice either of 640x480 or using 1440x900 in a virtual mode which is still apparently a 640x480 setting.  How do I set it to do real 1440x900?
2008-11-09T16:28:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	iit really depends on whether you have the correct driver for your graphics card. default most X servers start using a vga driver if they dont detect your graphics card driver
2008-11-09T16:36:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	what card are you on?
2008-11-09T16:38:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	can you pastebinit your lspci?
2008-11-09T16:40:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	can you open up a terminal and type sudo apt-get install pastebinit? once this is done type lspci > lspci.txt and cat lspci.txt | pastebinit
2008-11-09T16:53:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	give me the url
2008-11-09T17:04:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	missed it mate, you need to address it to me
2008-11-09T17:06:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	thats your video chip   23.
2008-11-09T17:10:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	you need to check whether that s3 driver is the one your X server is using
2008-11-09T17:11:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	do this in a terminal sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-s3
2008-11-09T17:15:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	you just need to press ctl+alt+backspace to restart the X server
2008-11-09T17:21:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	can you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-11-09T17:34:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | pastebinit
2008-11-09T17:46:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	your video driver is loading ok; its your monitor thats not letting  you get into higher resolution
2008-11-09T17:49:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	do you remember/can you find out your monitor's horizontal and vertical refresh rates?
2008-11-09T17:58:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Don123	can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf please
