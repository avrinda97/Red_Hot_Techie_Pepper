2006-12-26T07:30:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Can anyone help me get an Ubuntu package?
2006-12-26T07:30:00.000Z	spasticteapot		I can't access a repository.
2006-12-26T07:30:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	which one
2007-02-27T06:14:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	I run Xubuntu on my 1ghz Pentium-M.
2007-02-27T06:18:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	you wimp, just make a .desktop file and put it in /usr/share/applications
2007-02-27T06:18:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	Sorry?
2007-02-27T06:18:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	I tried that - the editor is buggy.
2007-02-27T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	the editor? mousepad?
2007-02-27T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	no not that, go to /usr/share/applications, that is where the menu entries are at. You can create new ones or modify all you need to in there
2007-02-27T06:20:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	you just have to edit text files. They are pretty self explanatory though. What I usually do is open a .desktop file of a similar application and just edit it appropriately for my new one. So if it is an internet application, just edit firefox.desktop and save it as something else
2007-03-13T16:10:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	like?>
2007-04-30T06:56:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	really?
2007-05-02T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	do you have multiple javas installed?>
2007-05-02T08:36:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	Just installed JRE5 and JRE6.
2007-05-02T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	probably need to update-alternatives
2007-05-02T08:37:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	What about Limewire? or about every D&D game table application ever written?
2007-05-02T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	crap
2007-06-10T07:24:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	thinkpads are ugly
2007-06-11T06:38:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	don't think you can, what is the point anyways in doing that
2007-06-11T08:41:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	Huh.
2007-06-11T08:42:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	So, I have network-monitor...and network-manager is what I want?
2007-06-11T08:42:00.000Z	bruenig	spasticteapot	I don't know what it is called, try every applet in there if you must, it should be there
2007-06-11T08:43:00.000Z	spasticteapot	bruenig	What if I create a new user, "Fubar", and then copy down what the applet is?
