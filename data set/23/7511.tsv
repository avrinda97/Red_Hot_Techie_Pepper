2006-01-04T16:35:00.000Z	hosler	shawarma	check for being loose?
2006-01-04T16:35:00.000Z	shawarma	hosler	Something like that.
2006-01-04T16:38:00.000Z	shawarma	hosler	Any luck?
2006-01-04T16:40:00.000Z	hosler	shawarma	no luck
2006-01-04T16:48:00.000Z	shawarma	hosler	How old is the machine?
2006-01-04T16:51:00.000Z	hosler	shawarma	i fixed it. i had a heat censor for under my cpu which didnt let the cpu get installed snuggly enough. took that out and let my cpu fan go full throttle and it worked.
