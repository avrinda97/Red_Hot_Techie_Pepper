2010-06-10T05:13:00.000Z	paraintj		ok this is going to sound crazy but I setup my entire family with ubuntu the last few days. Laptops freaking desktops media server etc etc 9 total new users now on linux :p I only have 1 complaint so far and I'm going to find a way to duplicate it.
2010-06-10T05:14:00.000Z	paraintj		My mom is complaining lol that the only thing she can't do on ubuntu so far that she could on vistacrapola is double click a browser to do a double side by side browser comparison?
2010-06-10T05:14:00.000Z	paraintj		To be honest I don't even know what she's talking about but I'm 99% sure somewhere out there ubuntu can do it lol
2010-06-10T05:15:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	were you using firefox on vista??
2010-06-10T05:15:00.000Z	paraintj	kreppnar	yes sir she was using ff on vista is that a ff option she is talking about?
2010-06-10T05:16:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	for one thing..old people who use vista and only know windows....can easily get confused to linux..its just fact
2010-06-10T05:16:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	firefox is pretty much the same as windows version..some slight difference..it just runs better
2010-06-10T05:16:00.000Z	paraintj	kreppnar	yea that's true but I've been teaching them for 2 days now and they really love ubuntu and are taking to it well. My fam only uses IM's and browsers.
2010-06-10T05:17:00.000Z	paraintj	kreppnar	ok I'll try that I been having them all use google chrome beta for linux but I'll switch her back to ff
2010-06-10T05:17:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	well there are a ton of browsers available. Opera, Chrome, Firefox, SeaMonkey, etc etc
2010-06-10T05:18:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	even konqueror from KDE is pretty simple to understand
2010-06-10T05:18:00.000Z	paraintj	kreppnar	well she explained it as - (and I wiped it so its gone now) as a double click in the bottom center of the screen and it somehow duplicated the browser and did a side by side comparison so she could copy over data. I'm going to check out this KDE option braxton is mentioning.
2010-06-10T05:18:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	as for IM... alot of good ones there too, Pidgin, kopete, Amsn
2010-06-10T05:19:00.000Z	paraintj	kreppnar	they are taking to this empathy pretty well.
2010-06-10T05:19:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	you on the standard gnome desktop now too right?
2010-06-10T05:19:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	i personally love the new LXDE desktop ...so awesome
2010-06-10T05:20:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	yeah Compiz has a set of a bunch of options for all those cool features
2010-06-10T05:21:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	LOL i feel yeah..im family tech support too..i wish they would all switch to Linux so i could just ssh to their box's and fix stuff from my house
2010-06-10T05:30:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	i love trying all different types of linux's
2010-06-10T05:33:00.000Z	paraintj	kreppnar	open suse that's a distro my father in law tells me is great I have got to try that one some day.
2010-06-10T05:34:00.000Z	paraintj	kreppnar	what is good about linux mint? I have never heard of that distro
2010-06-10T05:34:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	its ubuntu based...very stable though
2010-06-10T05:35:00.000Z	kreppnar	paraintj	yah i love Linux Mint. It runs well.
