2008-02-27T02:11:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	what shutdown issue
2008-02-27T02:15:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	can you issue a shutdown -h now and then dump the contents of ps aux to pastebin
2008-02-27T02:17:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	so everything goes black immediately after issuing that shell command?
2008-02-27T02:19:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	are you doing this within X
2008-02-27T02:20:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	gnome or kde
2008-02-27T02:20:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	/etc/init.d/gdm stop ..this will kill X
2008-02-27T02:21:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	you will most likely lose connection to us, im curious what happens when you issue a shutdown from outside of x
2008-02-27T02:28:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	what happened
2008-02-27T02:28:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	were you at a console only
2008-02-27T02:28:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	did it just freeze
2008-02-27T02:29:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	were you able to type commands after you issued the shutdown?
2008-02-27T02:30:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	can you reboot ok?
2008-02-27T02:30:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	when you issued the shutdown from the client did the screen go black or just freeze
2008-02-27T02:34:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	are you 100% positive you were outside of X
2008-02-27T02:34:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	it's a common X issue but I've never seen it from outside X
2008-02-27T02:36:00.000Z	utkan0s	riad	when you stopped gdm did it drop you to just text?
