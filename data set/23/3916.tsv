2008-12-04T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	Lartza_	disown the job after you run it (COMMAND & disown), or use nohup (nohup COMMAND), or use screen
2008-12-04T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	Lartza_	no, not in general.  Use the ubuntu repositories
2008-12-04T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	Lartza_	what exactly is too old?
2008-12-04T18:39:00.000Z	Lartza_	jrib	but is it 1.4.6?
2008-12-04T18:39:00.000Z	jrib	Lartza_	right
2009-09-10T19:27:00.000Z	jrib	Lartza_	just install it (it's in the repositories), add some music to the right directory (check /etc/mpd.conf), add some music to the playlist (you should probably use ncmpc or some other client), and then use mpc to start, stop, play etc...
