2011-05-07T03:33:00.000Z	Chepoll	ErezCohen	okay, firstly, is the network-manager applet working? the one that scans for the wireless and whatnot
2011-05-07T03:34:00.000Z	ErezCohen	Chepoll	i think every thing is working, what i am getting from the dasktop is i can see all the wireless networks around me...and i can connect to them, just not getting any ip from that
