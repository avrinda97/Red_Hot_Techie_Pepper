2006-10-15T05:58:00.000Z	bintut		anybody can help me here on how can i make my ubuntu install even faster?  :(
2006-10-15T05:58:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	thru the Alternate CD instead of Desktop CD
2006-10-15T05:59:00.000Z	bintut	KurtKraut	you mean, install?  yes, i did it already
2006-10-15T05:59:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	you said 'ubuntu install' ... so say 'an ubuntu installed'
2006-10-15T06:00:00.000Z	bintut		i'm wondering why ubuntu amd64 on my amd turion64 laptop is very, very slow..
2006-10-15T06:00:00.000Z	bintut	KurtKraut	it's my 4th time to install ubuntu on different ways
2006-10-15T06:01:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	it still ambiguous what you want. You just want to make ubuntu faster after you installed it or you want to make the installation process faster ?
2006-10-15T06:01:00.000Z	bintut		even in console, before the characters that i encode, it takes seconds before the characters will appear
2006-10-15T06:02:00.000Z	bintut	KurtKraut	i already installed ubuntu.. and i'm wondering why this is very, very slow
2006-10-15T06:03:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	how fast is your processor and how much RAM do you have ?
2006-10-15T06:04:00.000Z	bintut	KurtKraut	1.8ghz amd turion64 @ 512ram. my laptop is fast with other distros
2006-10-15T06:05:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	it should'nt be slow but you have to consider that Ubuntu loads a lot of stuff in order to offer some services, like bluetooth
2006-10-15T06:05:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	are you feeling the system slow as a whole or only during specific tasks ?
2006-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	bintut	KurtKraut	i know. but it's not the reason. it's really something with xorg or what that eats a lot of cpu..
2006-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	bintut	KurtKraut	slow as a whole
2006-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	what Ubuntu version are you using ?
2006-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	bintut		6.06.1
2006-10-15T06:07:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	try to install the video driver.
2006-10-15T06:07:00.000Z	KurtKraut		binarydigit, it should give you a better performance
2006-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	it should give you a better performance
2006-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	bintut	KurtKraut	what video driver? i'm already using fglrx here
2006-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	hmmm
2006-10-15T06:09:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bintut	can you do a bechmark ? Measure precisely how long tasks takes ? I think you may be suffering from a placebo efftct. It should'nt be slow with your config
