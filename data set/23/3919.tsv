2008-04-10T20:54:00.000Z	_moro_bana_		 is freeBSD not linux?
2008-04-10T20:55:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	no
2008-04-10T20:57:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	different kernel (bsd kernel vs linux), different userland (bsd userland vs gnu)
2008-04-10T20:58:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	i kinda understand the kernel stuff, but what is userland
2008-04-10T20:59:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	C library, coreutils (rm, ln, cp, ls ...) lots of low level things
2008-04-10T20:59:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	the GUI is X.org, it's pretty much the same on bsd and linux
2008-04-10T21:02:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	if you want to try bsd, there's several flavors: freebsd, netbsd, openbsd. I prefer freebsd over the others
2008-04-10T21:04:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	can i get it from the internet like ubuntu.what made you come to ubuntu, guess you started with bsd
2008-04-10T21:04:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	yes you can. Google is your friend in this case :)
2008-04-10T21:05:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	yes i can find it.
2008-04-10T21:06:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	can you handle this one? , my synaptic ,apt,aptitude stopped working
2008-04-10T21:06:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	I need a bit more info :)
2008-04-10T21:06:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	like an actual error
2008-04-10T21:07:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	well apt just halts at 0% when downlading, wait let me start synaptic and see what it gives me
2008-04-10T21:07:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-04-10T21:11:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/62737/
2008-04-10T21:12:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	ah, you've used automatix and enabled the beryl repos. You probably already ruined your system with that
2008-04-10T21:14:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	i removed automatix a long time ago after learnign it wasnt good for my system, fresh install then right ?
2008-04-10T21:14:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	well, at least disable the automatix and beryl repos in your sources.list
2008-04-10T21:16:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	that is deleting the lines from the file, am i right?
2008-04-10T21:16:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	correct
2008-04-10T21:19:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	Seveas	one thing i want to ask about fresh installs, my kpvnc on my fresh inst shows its connected to microsoft pptp but my browser can load
2008-04-10T21:20:00.000Z	Seveas	_moro_bana_	sorry, I know nothing about kvpnc
