2007-05-24T06:57:00.000Z	unimatrix9		hello there
2007-05-24T06:58:00.000Z	unimatrix9		how can i get nm-applet to load without asking for my keyring password all the time?
2007-05-24T06:58:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	there's a pam module
2007-05-24T06:58:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	hang on a sec...
2007-05-24T07:00:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	package is libpam-keyring
2007-05-24T07:00:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	are you familiar with pam?
2007-05-24T07:01:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	no, it's not installed by default.
2007-05-24T07:02:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	i believe you just need to install libpam-keyring, and it will cause your login password to also unlock your keyring
2007-05-24T07:02:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	assuming your keyring is the same password as your login, i believe
2007-05-24T07:03:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	i would think so, though I haven't done it myself.
2007-05-24T07:04:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	but not until you log in, right?
2007-05-24T07:05:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	right.. so if you had mutliple users, they each would get their own keyring.  anyway, i think you need to sync your keyring password and your user password.  and install libpam-keyring
2007-05-24T07:10:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	any luck?
2007-05-24T07:21:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	okay
2007-05-24T07:21:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	did you install libpam-keyring?
2007-05-24T07:22:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	jsut to be clear you need 3 things:  1. install libpam-keyring (yes)
2007-05-24T07:22:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	2. (i think) your login password and keyring password should be the same
2007-05-24T07:22:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	and 3. your wireless key must be in the keyring (if you deleted the keyring, you'll need to re-add that)
2007-05-24T07:23:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	it was a while ago that i installed libpam-keyring, but i believe i didn't have to do any additional configuration after installing it.
2007-05-24T07:25:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	it appears it was wrong-- there is a bit of additional config you have to do.
2007-05-24T07:25:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	i *think* this is the article i used to set it up:  it's *really* straightforward

2007-05-24T07:26:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	unimatrix9	okay, g/l
