2007-08-04T14:50:00.000Z	Retnuh		Anyone know why I dont have a Debian link under Applications?
2007-08-04T14:50:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	btw - NetBeans comes as a "bin" file - change this to be executable - it is the installer
2007-08-04T14:56:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	you should "sudo ./filename.bin" - otherwise Java and Netbeans will only be installed in your home dir!
2007-08-04T15:05:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	Yep - but this is a commercial tool and only available for windows ;-)
2007-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	oh, I didnt know it was only for Windows. I do know it is free though
2007-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	TextPad is free????
2007-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	I bought licenses last year... huh?
2007-08-04T15:07:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	I downloaded it and I have never paid for it
2007-08-04T15:07:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	JEdit should be quite OK and runs everywhere (Java)
2007-08-04T15:07:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	Yes, I have JEdit on windows, so that is on Linux too?
2007-08-04T15:08:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	Yes - Java runs *everywhere* - Mac, Windows, Linux...
2007-08-04T15:08:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	will that be under the symnaptic thing?
2007-08-04T15:08:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	So does nearly any Java program
2007-08-04T15:08:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	NetBeans itself is also written in Java
2007-08-04T15:08:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	cool
2007-08-04T15:09:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	Is JEdit on the Synaptic Package Manager?
2007-08-04T15:09:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	Nope - sorry, you have to download yourself
2007-08-04T15:09:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	The Debian package should work
2007-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	GREAT..... ... one sec, I might need help
2007-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	Or use the Java based installer
2007-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	Assumed that you have Java installed of course
2007-08-04T15:11:00.000Z	Retnuh	Askaaron	And I have Netbeans.......YEAH....
2007-08-04T15:11:00.000Z	Askaaron	Retnuh	Fine :) Hope you will like it as much as i do ;-)
