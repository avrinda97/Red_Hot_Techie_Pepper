2007-01-02T14:44:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki		anyone here with experince with: installing ubuntu on a USB - Harddisk??
2007-01-02T14:45:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	I installed ubuntu on the hdd from a stick
2007-01-02T14:45:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	on a USB harddisk?
2007-01-02T14:46:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	no ide
2007-01-02T14:47:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	I assume the process would be the same though. I hear there are some problems installing to usb hdds in general, though. I don't know the current status for that
2007-01-02T14:47:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	,thats the prob... i installed on a usb hdd but.. when i but up GRUB fails...
2007-01-02T14:48:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	yeah. I don't know how to solve it generally. what is the error?
2007-01-02T14:48:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	grub error 21 ;)
2007-01-02T14:49:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	that's informative ;)
2007-01-02T14:50:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	is it correctly configured? error 21 means the disk does not exist (or grub thinks so)
2007-01-02T14:50:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	see :D , i read it up and it said.. that the adress of the hdd could not resolved... seems that is a problem how to dress the usb harddisk on start up... grub ... :/
2007-01-02T14:51:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	all I know at least a year ago booting from a usb hdd was supposed to be a pain. I don't have personal experience installing to usb hdds
2007-01-02T14:52:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	, it still is i found a 12 step tutorial on the forums 12 steps where .... i m stuck at every step :/
2007-01-02T14:52:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	its involded with a lot manual filelist editing and such..
2007-01-02T14:53:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	oh
2007-01-02T14:53:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	here thats it: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=80811
2007-01-02T14:55:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	well did you aquire the alternate install cd?
2007-01-02T14:55:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	, i guess "USB" harddisk user are not seen as a general user so ... the developement in this deirection is slow or rather 0
2007-01-02T14:55:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	not not yet what advantages i would have then with thaT?
2007-01-02T14:56:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	the guide tells you to use that one as I understand it. it says not the live cd
2007-01-02T14:57:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	the guide is too complex too many points of error :/ i think i cant configure GRUB by hand...
2007-01-02T14:58:00.000Z	mwe	Shin_Gouki	then you probably have to give up or get someone to do it for you
2007-01-02T15:01:00.000Z	Shin_Gouki	mwe	why is this prcess so complicated? mount points, GRUB configuration... the GUI support is lwo to zero , WHY?
