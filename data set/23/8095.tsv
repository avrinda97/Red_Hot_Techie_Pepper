2005-01-30T07:08:00.000Z	cutterjohn		Is there any sort of minimal path to go from warty to hoary? (dialup)
2005-01-30T07:08:00.000Z	cutterjohn		(i.e. and still have a mostly working system)
2005-01-30T07:10:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	Right.
2005-01-30T07:11:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	thx. handy to know, as I'm not at all familiar with apt.
2005-01-30T07:11:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 You're most welcome.  =)
2005-01-30T07:26:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 No, deb-src doesn't fetch
2005-01-30T07:30:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 I didn't realize that they were in the regular depository...  Firefox is obnoxious about cutting the filenames off in directories.  Hmph, I'll just have to use lynx, next time.  =)
2005-01-30T07:31:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	I only knew for pretty much certain since I originally manually edited my apt/sources.list file
2005-01-30T07:31:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	and I have no clue as how to force synaptic to grab sources
2005-01-30T07:32:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 heh.  I've never used synaptic.  =)
2005-01-30T07:32:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	ah, I've had to manually grab stuff or use crappy old yum for so long that a GUI package/grabber/installer is a blessing... like being on OSX w/fink commander
2005-01-30T07:33:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	or worse grab raw packages and build with no nifty tools like checkinstall...
2005-01-30T07:33:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 haha
2005-01-30T07:33:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 haha... yeah
2005-01-30T07:33:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	almost as bad as the bad old days of depency hell...
2005-01-30T07:33:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 hahaha... not so old, for some of us recent FC converts.  =)
2005-01-30T07:34:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	wow, I thought that RPM had been pretty much improved lately... but I've primarily run my linux on powerpc macs, and mostly only ran x86s as servers with FreeBSD as my main server...
2005-01-30T07:35:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	just to clarify, I was speaking of 7 or so years ago in my original dependency hell comment
2005-01-30T07:35:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 RPM really _is_ improving, but the packagers are getting worse.
2005-01-30T07:35:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 Understood.  =)
2005-01-30T07:36:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geppy	what is CTRL-ALT-F2?
2005-01-30T07:36:00.000Z	geppy	cutterjohn	 Right.
