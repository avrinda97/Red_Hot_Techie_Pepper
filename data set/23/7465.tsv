2005-09-01T08:04:00.000Z	e0f		after i type sudo apt-get install tftpd, in what mode i start it?
2005-09-01T08:05:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	what mode are you reffering to? AFAIR tftpd is started from (x)inetd
2005-09-01T08:05:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	by default
2005-09-01T08:06:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	 i want to start tftpd server on my local machine but i don't know how
2005-09-01T08:08:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	tftpd is started by inetd or xinetd by default. you might want to edit /etc/hosts.allow to allow connections to your tftpd port. if you don't have inetd or xinetd (which is higly unlikely) yo might want to run tftpd in daemon mode. read man tftpd (or man in.tftpd ?)
2005-09-01T08:10:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	yep, but /etc/init.d/tftpd-hpa don't answer me
2005-09-01T08:11:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	why do you want to have tftp anyway?
2005-09-01T08:11:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	'cause i want to upgrade my router firmware
2005-09-01T08:12:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	and you want to install a tftp *server* on your box?
2005-09-01T08:13:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	yes, 'cause i want to transfer the firmware from my box to my router
2005-09-01T08:16:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	you might want to look at atftp, it is a tftp *client*. Though I can't be sure, your router should have a tftp *server* running
2005-09-01T08:16:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	my router got a tftp, i want to know only in what mode i start tftpd on my box
2005-09-01T08:16:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	oops it seems that atftp is a server as well, but I think you need a client
2005-09-01T08:17:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	i got a client too
2005-09-01T08:17:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	then I can't help you since I don't understand your question
2005-09-01T08:17:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	try connecting to the router with a client
2005-09-01T08:18:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	if you are sure that you need a tftp server I can't help you with tftpd-hpa since I never used it. If you install tftpd it is set up to be run by (x)inetd. You just would have to configure it a bit
2005-09-01T08:19:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	the problem is very simple, i want to upgrade the firmware of my router, so i donwload on my box a latest firmware, and now i want to move this firmware in my router by tftp, but i don't know in what mode i start tftpd lol
2005-09-01T08:19:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	it is very likely that tftpd-hpa is also run by inetd
2005-09-01T08:19:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	what is this mode you are reffering to?
2005-09-01T08:21:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	what I am saying is that most propably you don't need the tftp*d*, you just need a tftp client to connect to your router
2005-09-01T08:23:00.000Z	e0f	redguy	yep, but tell me how i start tftpd ?
2005-09-01T08:25:00.000Z	redguy	e0f	in.tftpd -l
