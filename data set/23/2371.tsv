2009-11-17T23:10:00.000Z	allowoverride	ha1331	got it thanks
2009-11-17T23:13:00.000Z	ha1331	allowoverride	64bit is built more for making money than for "normal" users. My opinnion tho.
2009-11-17T23:13:00.000Z	allowoverride	ha1331	got it
2009-11-17T23:15:00.000Z	ha1331	allowoverride	I'm willing to bet that if you would install 32bit, you wouldn't regret it. There wouldn't be moment when you would be missing the "extra 32bits". By that I mean that there hardly is anything _you_ couldn't do with 32bit that you could do with 64bit.
2009-11-17T23:16:00.000Z	allowoverride	ha1331	you mean 32 bit env on 64 arch. correct?
2009-11-17T23:17:00.000Z	ha1331	allowoverride	it doesn't mean that I have something against x86_64, have it my self on my desktop.
2009-11-17T23:17:00.000Z	ha1331	allowoverride	yeah, that's what I ment :)
2009-11-17T23:17:00.000Z	allowoverride	ha1331	got it. just confirming
2009-11-17T23:18:00.000Z	ha1331	allowoverride	If you decide to go with the 64bits, you just might need to do more googling on occasions where 32bit would just work.
2009-11-17T23:24:00.000Z	ha1331	allowoverride	was just about to say that what ever you do, just avoid ati and you'll be ok :)
2009-11-17T23:26:00.000Z	ha1331	allowoverride	the rest is not gnu, lot's of things are but not rest.
2009-11-17T23:27:00.000Z	allowoverride	ha1331	for most apps, all to me lol
