2006-03-05T09:36:00.000Z	setuid		Anyone know how to build the vmware modules against a stock Ubuntu kernel? Its looking for headers which don't exist in all of Ubuntu.
2006-03-05T09:36:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	you need to install the kernel source and headers
2006-03-05T09:37:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	I have those, its not there
2006-03-05T09:37:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	It takes about 7 hours to build the kernel from source (it builds 12 architectures)
2006-03-05T09:37:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	you have your kernel kernel's source in /usr/src/linux....
2006-03-05T09:37:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	Yep
2006-03-05T09:37:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	did you build it?
2006-03-05T09:38:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	But there is no include/linux/version.h without building the kernel, and building the kernel requires hacking a LOT of source files to swtich the arch to SMP, s/386/686/ and so on
2006-03-05T09:38:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	Build what?
2006-03-05T09:38:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	Build a kernel from the kernel source? Or a debian package from the source?
2006-03-05T09:38:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	kernel building in debian/ubuntu is easy.. 1 sec.. let me find howto (try asking the bot)
2006-03-05T09:39:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	I wrote _the_ kernel howto, I know how to build kernels ;)
2006-03-05T09:39:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	But 'debuild' on this tree takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R
2006-03-05T09:39:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	ah so your tring to find a way around it..
2006-03-05T09:40:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	No, I'm trying to build the vmware modules against the kernel I"m _actually_ runing, not a _new_ one I build from source
2006-03-05T09:40:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	VMware needs to source tree for the kernel your currently running to it can link hooks into the current kernel
2006-03-05T09:40:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	The problem is that the stock kernel *DOES NOT* match the source labeled with that same version stamp
2006-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	rgr.. I had the same problem here..
2006-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	I run a custom kernel here. So I have my kernel source..
2006-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	I normally would, but I need fglrx, and that doesn't build
2006-03-05T09:43:00.000Z	setuid	biovore	Any idea how I can build fglrx from source so it works with a custom kernel?
2006-03-05T09:45:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	no clue on fglrx stuff.. I run nvidia here
2006-03-05T09:46:00.000Z	biovore	setuid	I think its on ATI's site
