2011-07-08T18:57:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	... and what card do you have?
2011-07-08T18:57:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	Default one maybe ?
2011-07-08T18:58:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	ATI radeon.
2011-07-08T18:58:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	open a console and type... lspci | grep VGA
2011-07-08T18:58:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	OK
2011-07-08T19:00:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	As I see, you should have the option to install the catalyst driver. That might help with your VGA problem. As stated by Dr_Willis_, run jockey-gtk in a console. It will look for 'additional drivers' on for your system.
2011-07-08T19:01:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	Thanks :)
2011-07-08T19:08:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	Dr_Willis_: http://pastebin.com/1L8HJbCJ >_< error
2011-07-08T19:09:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	Looks that it did not download the driver... You were able to activate the driver and then Ubuntu asked you to reboot?
2011-07-08T19:10:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	No, just received that message but no reboot asked.
2011-07-08T19:10:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	Rebooting ?
2011-07-08T19:11:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	Ok. So you cannot activate the driver?
2011-07-08T19:11:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	Yes. It says not yet
2011-07-08T19:14:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	Looks like 'installation went well'... see that bug... The poster of post two is an ubuntu developper. So you should be save to reboot... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jockey/+bug/705986
2011-07-08T19:14:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	Dr_Willis_Thanks again :) I'll keep using this version without my external monitor.
2011-07-08T19:15:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	Again... looks like installation is ok...
2011-07-08T19:15:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	I see :)
2011-07-08T19:17:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	I can use my laptop minitor without having problem but any external monitors with VGA. It shaking and hurting my eyes.
2011-07-08T19:17:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	With that catalyst driver too? Check the new installed ATI configuration tool.
2011-07-08T19:18:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	OK :)
2011-07-08T19:18:00.000Z	leejongwook	minimec	Thanks :) you saved me and saved Ubuntu :P
2011-07-08T19:18:00.000Z	minimec	leejongwook	No problem.
