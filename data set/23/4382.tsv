2007-10-29T05:10:00.000Z	humblerodent		hey, if I upgrade to 64-bit, is there anything I need to worry about as far as running Ubuntu?  (including apps)
2007-10-29T05:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	not really, if you come across any apps that dont wanna run, there's workarounds for just about all of em
2007-10-29T05:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	flash used to be a big concern but with gutsy its no longer an issue, only major issue is lack of 64-bit java...but even that can be worked around
2007-10-29T05:12:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	yeah, I heard about the Flash one....you just need to use some wrapper shit or something right?
2007-10-29T05:13:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	yea, in gutsy all u have to do is apt-get install flash or install flash plug-in from firefox and it will setup the nspluginwrapper and install flash for you
2007-10-29T05:13:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	that's tight....Java's no big deal either?
2007-10-29T05:14:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	yea, as far as i know...right now i dont even have java because i dont really use it...but from what i hear it can be installed in 32-bit mode or any number of workarounds
2007-10-29T05:14:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	cool, thanks
2007-10-29T05:15:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	but suffice to say, some ppl might tell u otherwise on here, but 64-bit rally suffers no compatibility problems these days with gutsy and the average user
2007-10-29T05:15:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	anyone that tells u not to install 64-bit, doesn't use 64-bit
2007-10-29T05:17:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	well, actually, I wouldn't consider myself an "average user" anyway....it's just that my computer is a total dinosaur, I'm working on upgrading it, and if I went with 64-bit I'd be a total n00b to it
2007-10-29T05:17:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	what type of processor are we talkin?
2007-10-29T05:17:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	also, is it all good to run 32-bit Ubuntu on 64-bit architecture and will everything be as it was before?
2007-10-29T05:18:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	I'm not too sure yet....probably like an AMD 3200+
2007-10-29T05:18:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	oh you're planning to upgrade? i would definitely go with a dual-core or maybe even quad-core processor if i were you...and they're all 64-bit these days so u don need to worry about that
2007-10-29T05:19:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	dual-core and quad-core are 64-bit?
2007-10-29T05:19:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	yes, any newer processor these days is going to be 64-bit
2007-10-29T05:20:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	ah, okay....but like I asked....would I have any issues running 32-bit Ubuntu on a 64-bit computah box, if I decided I preferred it?
2007-10-29T05:21:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	no..what i meant by 64-bit is that they are 64-bit capable...they all can run natively in 32-bit as well
2007-10-29T05:21:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	but given that, i think it makes sense to run 64-bit ubuntu, as you can run 64-bit apps and 32-bit apps since the cpu is backwards compatible
2007-10-29T05:22:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	and mjancaitis: cool, thanks
2007-10-29T05:59:00.000Z	Evanlec	humblerodent	umm...heatsink compatibility? i think so..long asits the same socket
2007-10-29T06:00:00.000Z	humblerodent	Evanlec	and mrsno
