2012-01-09T03:57:00.000Z	NastyNaz		well it works pretty well I dont need the gui

2012-01-09T03:58:00.000Z	NastyNaz		and im back
2012-01-09T03:58:00.000Z	NastyNaz		is there any way to increase the resolution in here?
2012-01-09T03:58:00.000Z	NastyNaz		window is tiny
2012-01-09T03:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	what video chip?
2012-01-09T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	with proprietary driver?
2012-01-09T04:00:00.000Z	NastyNaz	ActionParsnip	no, it's virtualised, this is a VM im running on
2012-01-09T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	then its a virtualized hardware
2012-01-09T04:01:00.000Z	NastyNaz	ActionParsnip	i have pci-e passthrough though
2012-01-09T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	is there an app for setting the res for ATi?
2012-01-09T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	there is also the display settings item in dash
2012-01-09T04:02:00.000Z	NastyNaz	ActionParsnip	there is in the GUI but im in ctrl+alt+f1 now
2012-01-09T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	you may get a better desktop if you use the virtualized video card, the default install has the driver for that
2012-01-09T04:04:00.000Z	NastyNaz	ActionParsnip	i dont want a gui, I just want this text-only ubuntu to use 1680x1050 res instead of the small one it is now

2012-01-09T04:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	tty1
2012-01-09T04:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	sudo update-grub    will apply the setting, you may want to set the other things in the guide too
2012-01-09T04:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	simple stuff dude :)
2012-01-09T04:26:00.000Z	NastyNaz	ActionParsnip	the hardest thing is I don't know about stuff like initramfs-tools and other stuff and I have no way of 'finding out' about them until I google, how did people learn linux back before the internet?
2012-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	channels like this
2012-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	freenode is older than most folks in here :)
2012-01-09T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NastyNaz	easiest way is to just use the OS, just like you learned other OSes ;)
