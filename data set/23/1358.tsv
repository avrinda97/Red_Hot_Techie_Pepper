2010-05-13T12:57:00.000Z	vvd		anyone knows where apt expects cdrom: sources to be mounted?
2010-05-13T12:58:00.000Z	vvd		ive tried /media/cdrom and /media/cdrom0 but the packages aint found
2010-05-13T12:59:00.000Z	vvd		ive uninstalled hal now nothing works :>
2010-05-13T13:00:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	why you uninstalled it?
2010-05-13T13:01:00.000Z	vvd		hal is on the cdrom and cdrom: is added in sources.list but aptitude cant excess the files. i think i mounted the cdrom to a wrong loc
2010-05-13T13:02:00.000Z	vvd	pallgone	i want a minimal system in a vm so i uninstalled gnome which took hal with it...then i rebooted :) no net, nothing
2010-05-13T13:02:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	well, hal shouldn't affect network...
2010-05-13T13:02:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	just X will not recognise keyboard/mouse
2010-05-13T13:03:00.000Z	vvd		i have no network though
2010-05-13T13:03:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	have a look into /etc/network/interfaces
2010-05-13T13:04:00.000Z	vvd		theres no ethX in /dev pallgone
2010-05-13T13:05:00.000Z	vvd		is it possible to install a minimal system (no X/gnome) with the alternative cd?
2010-05-13T13:06:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	ifconfig -a
2010-05-13T13:07:00.000Z	vvd	pallgone	there is an eth0 :)
2010-05-13T13:07:00.000Z	vvd		but it did not get activated for some reason
2010-05-13T13:07:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	yes, and you need to configure it in /etc/network/interfaces
2010-05-13T13:07:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	gnome was using network-manager
2010-05-13T13:08:00.000Z	vvd	pallgone	ic
2010-05-13T13:08:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	then run '/etc/init.d/networking restart'
2010-05-13T13:08:00.000Z	vvd	pallgone	auto eth0; iface eth0 inet dhcp ?
2010-05-13T13:09:00.000Z	pallgone	vvd	yeah
