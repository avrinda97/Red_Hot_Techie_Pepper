2011-07-18T19:59:00.000Z	NielsMkn		Hey guys
2011-07-18T20:00:00.000Z	NielsMkn		I don't wish to be a troll, but is xubuntu 11.04 more similar to gnome 2.6? I don't like unity but I want to stay with the latest release
2011-07-18T20:01:00.000Z	zeroburn	NielsMkn	its very simmilar to win 2000 and pre....
2011-07-18T20:02:00.000Z	zeroburn	NielsMkn	the xubuntu interface...
2011-07-18T20:02:00.000Z	NielsMkn		ah is it true that the rollback option to gnome will be removed in 11.10?
2011-07-18T20:03:00.000Z	zeroburn	NielsMkn	yep.. unfortunatly.. according to the ubuntu forums, Gnome3 wont support the "classic" desktop out the box.. needs to be installed seperately (or something simmilar to the clasic desktop)
2011-07-18T20:03:00.000Z	NielsMkn		I hate both gnome 3 and unity :((
2011-07-18T20:04:00.000Z	NielsMkn		I hate typing things everytime in search
2011-07-18T20:04:00.000Z	zeroburn	NielsMkn	wel.. haha i never flame windows, but atleast ubuntu gives you a chance to get used to the new desktop environment before making the full switch :)...
2011-07-18T20:04:00.000Z	NielsMkn		well yeah :D
2011-07-18T20:05:00.000Z	NielsMkn	ActionParsnip	which DE?
2011-07-18T20:06:00.000Z	NielsMkn		Well which one is most like gnome 2.6?
2011-07-18T20:07:00.000Z	NielsMkn		eh, I don't want my ubuntu to look like Windows :/
2011-07-18T20:07:00.000Z	NielsMkn		Well ActionParsnip I looked at them, and found xfce similar :o
2011-07-18T20:08:00.000Z	NielsMkn		not gnome 3 right? :O
2011-07-18T20:08:00.000Z	NielsMkn		but right now, you guys told me it was like windows 2000 :O
2011-07-18T20:08:00.000Z	NielsMkn		and I dont' want windows and definetely not an old one :P
2011-07-18T20:09:00.000Z	zeroburn	NielsMkn	follow the other guy's advice... google... lolz..

2011-07-18T20:10:00.000Z	NielsMkn		lol why would I pick one I don't like :P
2011-07-18T20:10:00.000Z	NielsMkn		oh
2011-07-18T20:10:00.000Z	zeroburn	NielsMkn	KDE is very win7/vista like... If you HAVE to compare... Unity people say is alot like osx.(dont know if this is true) but really, just theme it?
