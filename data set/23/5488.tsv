2007-05-17T07:11:00.000Z	levander		Anybody know why they're ignoring a bug I filed for emacs in launchpad?  Is this common to ignore it?
2007-05-17T07:12:00.000Z	Slart	levander	if it's something obscure or not easily reproduced..
2007-05-17T07:13:00.000Z	levander	Slart	well, i posted a thread on comp.lang.python, and they reproduced it.  It's weird because it has to do with the python debugger under emacs.  And, I thought a lot of Canonical developers use python.  I'm sure they also use emacs as ubiquitous as it is.
2007-05-17T07:14:00.000Z	Slart	levander	then I don't know.. perhaps they will get to it in time... you'll have to ask the people responsible if you want a better answer, sorry
2007-05-17T07:14:00.000Z	levander	Slart	okay, thanks, guess i just wanted somewhere to complain... i probably will look at the package name and email an author...
2007-05-17T07:15:00.000Z	levander	Slart	wanna make sure it gets fixed in the next release, i've stayed quiet before, and the bug that affected me was still there in the next release, ticked me off
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	Slart	levander	hehe.. well, nag a bit.. it might help =)
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	levander	Slart	i'll just email an author of the package...
2007-05-17T07:16:00.000Z	levander	Slart	really, i guess RMS is the lead developer on emacs, i wonder if he'd respond?
2007-05-17T07:17:00.000Z	Slart	levander	hehe.. wonder how many emails he gets a day.. hundred? more?
2007-05-17T07:17:00.000Z	levander	Slart	you know, he used to have his user account set up at MIT (where he works) so that anyone could telnet in and read his mail.
2007-05-17T07:18:00.000Z	levander	Slart	he really didn't get that many emails a day, but that was before the days of spam
2007-05-17T07:18:00.000Z	Slart	levander	talking the talk and walking the walk.. impressive
2007-05-17T07:18:00.000Z	levander	Slart	yeah, it was one of his pro-sharing, anti-security beliefs that made him do that
2007-05-17T07:19:00.000Z	levander	Slart	he actually had a message popping up when you logged in saying "please don't delete any of my email!!!"
2007-05-17T07:20:00.000Z	Slart	levander	perhaps I should enable remote ssh, root/root and have that in the motd.. wonder how long it would be before my computer was busy spamming the world about v1agra etc =)
2007-05-17T07:21:00.000Z	levander	Slart	yeah, like i said, this was maybe 12 years ago, before spam really caught on.  The best porn used to be on Usenet.
2007-05-17T07:22:00.000Z	levander	Slart	Now, it's rare to find a good usenet group.
2007-05-17T07:22:00.000Z	Slart	levander	yea.. I remember when our ISP's in sweden still carried the binary groups.. nowdays they hardly carry the text only groups
2007-05-17T07:22:00.000Z	levander	Slart	porn, or otherwise, i don't even look anymore
2007-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	levander	Slart	there's a web interface to ubuto that you can go in and fill in answers for
2007-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	Slart	levander	huh?
2008-01-17T06:59:00.000Z	Slart	levander	user space file system block device.. or somthing like that
