2006-05-27T12:54:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	i had same problem
2006-05-27T12:54:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	lame :(
2006-05-27T12:56:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	I have that working
2006-05-27T12:57:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	I've got gnome setup where I have a taskbar/clock/everything on each monitor
2006-05-27T12:57:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	how you do it ? not xinerama
2006-05-27T12:57:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	clone?
2006-05-27T12:57:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	nope
2006-05-27T12:58:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	don't really want the screen stuff (taskbars) on the other monitor
2006-05-27T12:58:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	you could configure it
2006-05-27T12:58:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	I'm sure fluxbox will work :P
2006-05-27T12:59:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	i know but it takes time I'm trying to build a juke box
2006-05-27T12:59:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	I think you want the setup I have right now
2006-05-27T12:59:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	got flux box working but just not had the time to try it with both screens plus I think i'll wait for dapper
2006-05-27T13:00:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	be good to have a look
2006-05-27T13:02:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	to move you want xinerama but then you loose the independent desktops etc
2006-05-27T13:02:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	I know.. I want what windows nview does
2006-05-27T13:04:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	ireally want my whole other screen as a seperate session so I can restart x on the other but I think i need to improve my skills a little first
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	that's actually easy to set up... but you wouldn't be able to share the mouse and keyboard between the 2 on the fly (you'd need to do ctrl+alt+f8/f7 to switch between them)
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	you could setup another mouse and keyboard for it :P
2006-05-27T13:07:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	sounds fun
2006-05-27T13:11:00.000Z	bsdfox	toby	http://pastebin.com/737732
2006-05-27T13:13:00.000Z	toby	bsdfox	pressing ctl-alt f7/f8 totally screwed my box
