2005-07-07T09:05:00.000Z	osity		i partitioned a drive as one big partition and now when ubuntu boots it says special drive sda not found ...any ideas?
2005-07-07T09:05:00.000Z	osity		everything seems fine except for that error...
2005-07-07T09:06:00.000Z	Seveas	osity	can you paste the output of sudo fdisk -l && cat /etc/fstab on paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-07-07T09:08:00.000Z	osity	Seveas	someone told me yesterday it was becaues of the way the drive was partitionee
2005-07-07T09:09:00.000Z	Seveas	osity	when does it give this error, on boot..?
2005-07-07T09:09:00.000Z	osity	Seveas	yes
2005-07-07T09:09:00.000Z	Seveas	osity	so you cannot boot..?
2005-07-07T09:10:00.000Z	osity	Seveas	i can boot fine....it just gives the error...the drive is an empty formatted drive
2005-07-07T09:10:00.000Z	osity	Seveas	i have 3 drives.....1x40gb  2x200gb
2005-07-07T09:11:00.000Z	Seveas	osity	are the old paritions still in /etc/fstab perhaps?
2005-07-07T09:11:00.000Z	osity	Seveas	 Linux is on the 40gb....the 200's are to be partitioned and then raieded
2005-07-07T09:11:00.000Z	osity	Seveas	dont think so ...its a fresh install of ubuntu
2005-07-07T09:13:00.000Z	osity	Seveas	i was told I had to partition the drive a way other than one whole device.....
