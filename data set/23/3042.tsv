2008-08-19T14:12:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	try gpm then.
2008-08-27T20:48:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	in what context?
2008-08-27T20:48:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	on its own.. that command means nothing .. but i presume that is part of a find command
2008-09-08T15:30:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	list what though?
2008-09-08T15:30:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	what are you trying to do?
2008-09-08T15:31:00.000Z	Abracadabra	unop	I am trying to find all the files icmpInSrcQuenchs, recursively by a specific date and to find out which of those files are in which folder
2008-09-08T15:33:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	you should use find instead.  something like.   find /path -iname '*icmpinsrcquenchs*' -type f -newer $SOME_DATE -exec dirname {} \;
2008-09-08T15:33:00.000Z	Abracadabra	unop	so I start in /usr/folder (inside folder, there are over 200 subfolders, all named by numbers .... in each of those folders are the file icmpInSrcQuenchs). I need to list the ones that have been updating today, and in which folders they are in
2008-09-08T15:36:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	 find /usr/folder -iname '*icmpInSrcQuenchs*' -type f -mtime -1  #should list files modified in the last 24 hours
2008-09-08T15:37:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	if you just want the directories these files belong in.  find /usr/folder -iname '*icmpInSrcQuenchs*' -type f -mtime -1 -exec dirname {} \; | sort | uniq
2008-09-08T15:39:00.000Z	Abracadabra	unop	ty, and if I want to check files that have updated in the last 30 mins for eg ?
2008-09-08T15:40:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	 hmm, see the  -newer option to find
2008-09-08T15:40:00.000Z	unop	Abracadabra	also the -?time options
2008-09-08T15:42:00.000Z	Abracadabra	unop	ok, ty
