2006-08-24T09:35:00.000Z	omoore		i would like to use ubuntu as my host os.. for work reasons, i must have an environment which will run vmware workstation reliably.. anyone here been running vmware workstation on ubuntu for a long time?
2006-08-24T09:35:00.000Z	omoore		(i tried fedora once, but fell back to centos because of updates occasionally breaking vmware beyond what vmware-conf.pl would fix)
2006-08-24T09:35:00.000Z	distantbody	omoore	long time:no, reliably: yes
2006-08-24T09:36:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	have you *ever* had an update break it (as in vmware-config.pl not able to reconfigure for a new kernel)?
2006-08-24T09:38:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	it's not broke .. i'm currently running centos which has been rock solid for it... but i want to move to ubuntu for my host...
2006-08-24T09:39:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	it tried fedora once but an update (even withthe proper header (suposedly) for the runnign kernel broke it
2006-08-24T09:39:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	and i just don't want to get into a situation where i have to fall back to 'plan b' again
2006-08-24T09:40:00.000Z	distantbody	omoore	If it gets broken. just reinstall it, as long as your virtual machines are fine....
2006-08-24T09:40:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	yeah.. i know.. but...
2006-08-24T09:41:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	fedora had a miss-match of theheaders witht he running kernel at one point.. which meant that vmware-config.pl would nver work (even witht he support mod )
2006-08-24T09:42:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	i ended up having to downgrade the kernel to get vmware back up...
2006-08-24T09:42:00.000Z	distantbody	omoore	but if you install the correct header on Ubuntu it will install fine
2006-08-24T09:42:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	right..  i follow...
2006-08-24T09:42:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	i just wanted to hear from someone using it that things work well
2006-08-24T09:43:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	before i went through the bother of building another host environment
2006-08-24T09:43:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	i've used vmware reliably since pre 1.0.. the fedora 5 hickup has been the only time i had a problem
2006-08-24T09:44:00.000Z	distantbody	omoore	sure. All I can say is that I have had VMWARE player (free) and Server (also free) and the work fine.
2006-08-24T09:44:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	k.. i use player on most boxes.. but prefer workstation.. the extrea features are easily worth the cost :)
2006-08-24T09:44:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	the whole snapshot thing is very sweet
2006-08-24T09:45:00.000Z	distantbody	omoore	yes, i have had workstation, and snapshoots sure are great...
2006-08-24T09:45:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	not to mention the cloning, video, auto sizing of displays, etc
2006-08-24T09:46:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	(creating video, not video cards)
2006-08-24T09:47:00.000Z	omoore	distantbody	yeah.. pretty much.. except you can clone a snapshot too
