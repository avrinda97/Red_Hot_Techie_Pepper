2010-02-26T03:38:00.000Z	jastor		how do you get term to put ALL commands into history (so you can get to them with up/down arrows)?
2010-02-26T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	there are infinitely many possible commands, why would you want that anyway?
2010-02-26T03:38:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	the one ive typed .. not all possible ;)
2010-02-26T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	it should do that by default
2010-02-26T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	use ctrl-r  :)
2010-02-26T03:39:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	now for example .. it puts every command there EXCEPT thoose that returns an error .. like mv file1 file!  ... since i havent used \ in front of ! it doesnt remember that one .P
2010-02-26T03:40:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	oh I see.  That must be something fairly recent done in the default bash configuration
2010-02-26T03:41:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	mmm .. annoying to have to retype a long line just because you missed something somewhere ;)
2010-02-26T03:41:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	#bash can probably tell you right away
2010-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	that's really really really weird
2010-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	=
2010-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	? what is?
2010-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	your arrow suggested you compressed 70MiB into a 1.1 GiB file :)
2010-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	ah .. typo of me then ;)
2010-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	ok .. wasnt a typo .. meant 70MB tar.gz -> 1.1GB .log ;)
2010-04-10T16:19:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	why would you want to?
2010-04-10T16:20:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	so i wont have to put whatever,sh in cron and output the content to a file every X minutes
2010-04-10T16:21:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	its for a program that only supports static files but it would be nice if i could bind it to a file that generates output on the fly
2010-04-10T16:22:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	if what im after is not possible, ill just make a cronjob out of it and > virtualfile
2010-04-10T16:22:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	I don't understand the use case
2010-04-10T16:23:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	well probably not, but is it possible?
2010-04-10T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	jastor	not afaik
2010-04-10T16:24:00.000Z	jastor	jrib	ok .. cron it is then
