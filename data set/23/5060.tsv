2007-03-01T07:17:00.000Z	japers		hello there. I am in approximately hour 4 of the great windows -> ubuntu shift. but i think i have managed to destroy synaptic package manager
2007-03-01T07:17:00.000Z	cables	japers	how did you do that?
2007-03-01T07:18:00.000Z	japers	cables	no idea, but it gives me erros everytime i try to use it,so io cant actualy use it to get software
2007-03-01T07:18:00.000Z	cables	japers	what errors?
2007-03-01T07:19:00.000Z	cables	japers	did you change /etc/apt/sources.list at all?
2007-03-01T07:19:00.000Z	japers	cables	i have no idea what that means. so its possible
2007-03-01T07:19:00.000Z	cables	japers	what have you done so far to install things?
2007-03-01T07:20:00.000Z	cables	japers	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list please.
2007-03-01T07:20:00.000Z	cables	japers	that might be it. Did you make a backup of your sources list?
2007-03-01T07:21:00.000Z	cables	japers	do alt-f2, then "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
2007-03-01T07:23:00.000Z	cables	japers	yep.
2007-03-01T07:23:00.000Z	cables	japers	how far did you get in the beryl installation? Did you install any packages yet?
2007-03-01T07:24:00.000Z	japers	cables	nope, it kept saying bash: /etc/apt/sources.list: Permission denied
2007-03-01T07:27:00.000Z	japers	cables	i followed the installing beryl install guide as best i could. but becasue i have a geforce 4  i could use the autop script so had to try and understand what it was asking me to do.
2007-03-01T07:27:00.000Z	cables	japers	remove the last bit from that file (the nVidia bit.) To edit the file, you need to do this: alt-f2, then gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-03-01T07:27:00.000Z	japers	cables	this linux terminal thing is all new and slightly confusing
2007-03-01T07:27:00.000Z	cables	japers	that's not the terminal I'm telling you to use.
2007-03-01T07:28:00.000Z	cables	japers	I have to go now, sorry...
2007-03-01T07:29:00.000Z	japers	cables	your a legend. it's people like you that make the shift easy
2007-03-01T07:29:00.000Z	cables	japers	after you remove the nvidia bit, do the command "sudo aptitude update" and try again.
2007-03-01T07:29:00.000Z	cables	japers	cool
2007-03-01T07:29:00.000Z	japers	cables	thanks so much
2007-03-01T07:29:00.000Z	cables	japers	no problem. I expect in a few months you'll be good enough at this to help out here.
