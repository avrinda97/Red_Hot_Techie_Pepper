2008-04-08T19:46:00.000Z	Creationist		Okay, this is really starting to infuritate me.  For that past couple of months, Firefox just plain stops working at random times.  It no longer loads pages (just sits on "Loading..." indefinitely).  Sometimes after an hour of browsing, others just after visiting certain intense sites.  Restarting Firefox will temporarily solve the issue, but it just keeps repeating.  How can I track down the cause of this?
2008-04-08T19:47:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	how much RAM do you have?
2008-04-08T19:47:00.000Z	Creationist	pajamian	1gb
2008-04-08T19:48:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	tht's plenty, but the symptoms you describe sound like what happens when FF runs out of RAM.
2008-04-08T19:48:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	you may want to try the FF3 beta, it might work better for you.
2008-04-08T19:48:00.000Z	Creationist	pajamian	I figured that, but that's not the cause.  ANd FF3 is terrible for my system... way too buggy (and none of my necessary extentions work for it yet)
2008-04-08T19:49:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	ok, I understand, well, I would say you might possibly have a RAM problem, did you try running memtest for a couple passes?
2008-04-08T19:50:00.000Z	Creationist	pajamian	Haven't yet... but I guess that would explain why my entire system seems to grind to a halt at times, huh? ;)
2008-04-08T19:50:00.000Z	Creationist	pajamian	Although, that only happens in LInux, not Windows... so it shouldn't be a RAM issue.
2008-04-08T19:50:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	it could, bad RAM can do all sorts of weird things.
2008-04-08T19:51:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	Linux is more sensitive to RAM problems than windows.  That's because it makes much better usage of all your available RAM.
2008-04-08T19:53:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	the other thing is, check your RAM and CPU usage for FF when it starts freezing up, open up a terminal and run the "top" command, it will sort by the program with the highest CPU usage at the top.  You can then press M and it will change the sort to have the highest memory usage at the top.
2008-04-08T19:53:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	it will also report total RAM and CPU usage.
2008-04-08T19:54:00.000Z	Creationist	pajamian	But firefox never freezes, just can't load any pages... like my connection drops.
2008-04-08T19:54:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	check your connection, then, try pinging websites.
2008-04-08T19:54:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	rule out everything but FF, and then go to #firefox (I'm guessing) for support.
2008-04-08T19:55:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	you're with Comcast
2008-04-08T19:55:00.000Z	Creationist	pajamian	Well, I'm getting AT&T connected today.
2008-04-08T19:56:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	one sec, I'm looking up an article for you...
2008-04-08T19:56:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/265722093/article.pl
2008-04-08T20:01:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	nm that article I posted to you, I just checked the original article again and they've put up a post sayign it is in error.
2008-04-08T20:02:00.000Z	Creationist	pajamian	Yeah... didn't sound too likely.
2008-04-08T20:03:00.000Z	pajamian	Creationist	well you never know with comcast.  Unfortunately I wouldn't trust AT&T any more than them and I've heard you can't get 3rd party ISPs for DSL in the states anymore (I used to use DSL Extreme and thought they were great)
