2005-05-22T13:48:00.000Z	nakata	goofrider	yeah, lfs is sweet too
2005-05-22T13:53:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	why XFS?
2005-05-22T13:53:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	just wondering why u picked it. Not a flame or anything
2005-05-22T13:55:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	I use LVM, I grow and shrink my FS al the time
2005-05-22T13:55:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	we all have different priorities  :)
2005-05-22T14:03:00.000Z	nakata	goofrider	yeah, xfs attributes can store mime info
2005-05-22T14:03:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	that's kewl
2005-05-22T14:03:00.000Z	nakata	goofrider	yeah, lhttpd2 uses attributes for ACLs, hit counters, mime types, language settings, cgi flags, interpreter settings, custom config args, and possibly as 'as-is' headers for specific files
2005-05-22T14:04:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	that's super
2005-05-22T14:04:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	NTFS had extended attributes for  decade, just no apps ever uses them
2005-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	nakata	goofrider	same with afs
2005-05-22T14:06:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	well maybe their libraries doesn't support IPv6 so it doesn't help if DX8 does
2005-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	and they can be commericial libraries or engines that they licensed from other game devs, so they can really implement I{v^ even if they wanted to
2005-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	and US/Canada really doesn't give a shit about IPv6 because we got all the Class A subnets
2005-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	I;m saying we got all the IPv4 address. We'll probably not running out of IPv4 address for another 10 years
2005-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	nakata	goofrider	when did quake come out
2005-05-22T14:10:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	I don't play PC games
2005-05-22T14:11:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	i didn't say "exactly" i said "probably"
2005-05-22T14:13:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	I know what you mean. But US devs won't understand cause IPv4 is pretty much sufficient here. we don't ahve an imminent need to implement it. But I agree we'll be in real trouble when the time comes
2005-05-22T14:13:00.000Z	goofrider	nakata	cuz the whole world would have been 100% IPv6 and we won't even how to begin to implement it
2005-05-22T14:15:00.000Z	nakata	goofrider	too true, bro
