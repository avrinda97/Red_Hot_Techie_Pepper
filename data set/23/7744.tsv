2009-12-05T04:51:00.000Z	sonne		have you upgraded it?
2009-12-05T04:52:00.000Z	sonne		as in, from a previous version?
2009-12-05T04:52:00.000Z	noah	sonne	i'm all up to date with apt-get ...
2009-12-05T04:52:00.000Z	sonne		no, i mean...
2009-12-05T04:52:00.000Z	sonne		it used to work as a previous version, then you upgraded it to 3.5, and it stopped working?
2009-12-05T04:53:00.000Z	sonne		grats VirusTB :D
2009-12-05T04:53:00.000Z	noah	sonne	it was working until a little while ago when i did apt-get upgrade... i'm not sure firefox itself was upgraded in that upgrade though
2009-12-05T04:54:00.000Z	sonne	noah	have you tried with a blank configuration? maybe something got messed up in the config migration or whatnot
2009-12-05T04:54:00.000Z	noah	sonne	i.e. mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.bak ?
2009-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	sonne		or -> HOME=/tmp firefox
2009-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	sonne		i usually do that
2009-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	noah		ah that's an idea
2009-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	sonne		but be sure to close all firefox windows before you do that
2009-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	sonne		or it will just spawn another window
2009-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	noah		right
2009-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	noah	sonne	looks like it might be working
2009-12-05T04:56:00.000Z	sonne	noah	try the same things on both setups
2009-12-05T04:56:00.000Z	sonne		determine if that is the problem
2009-12-05T04:56:00.000Z	noah	sonne	hmm actually just remembered zotero extension upgraded itself a little while ago too
2009-12-05T04:56:00.000Z	sonne		i don't know what extension that is, but that can be a cause
2009-12-05T04:57:00.000Z	sonne		once you've determined that the problem is not within firefox itself, but within something in your .mozilla, you can start examining that
2009-12-05T04:59:00.000Z	noah	sonne	thanks for the suggestions, poking around now... disabling zotero didn't fix it
2009-12-05T05:00:00.000Z	sonne	noah	if i was you, i'd just export your bookmarks / passwords / whatever you care about
