2010-04-14T09:03:00.000Z	awesome_guest		do you know how to disable a lot of graphical eye candy?
2010-04-14T09:05:00.000Z	awesome_guest		I am experiencing cpu usage that's a lot higher than I am used to.. I only have firefox and a text editor open
2010-04-14T09:05:00.000Z	awesome_guest		I am experiencing 30-40% usage.. on two 2ghz cores
2010-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	awesome_guest		this is unacceptable
2010-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	try the 'top' command to see what process is taking up your cpu
2010-04-14T09:07:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	YES xorg is actually doing it
2010-04-14T09:08:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	hrm. I only get that much CPU out of xorg when I'm running 3D animated backgrounds
2010-04-14T09:10:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	what release are you running?
2010-04-14T09:11:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	9.04
2010-04-14T09:11:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	wow, that's was a pretty stable release too.
2010-04-14T09:11:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	oh it's stable, just highly suboptimal
2010-04-14T09:12:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	it's perfect.. if you don't care about power consumption
2010-04-14T09:14:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	I'm not sure what to tell you.  Maybe one of the gurus in here knows how to track/trace what xorg is doing.  Your experience is very unusual. I've got a ton of stuff running and I bet I'm at less than 5% CPU total
2010-04-14T09:15:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	I mean, I am running dual monitors with a mobile graphics thing, the intel 950 gma express
2010-04-14T09:16:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	DRI is basically your Direct Rendering
2010-04-14T09:16:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	alright, it may explain why the cpu has to do everything
2010-04-14T09:17:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	meaning, that your video card is not handling the 3D as it should. Or at least that is my take on it. I know my 3D gaming is a no-go if I don't have DRI enabled
2010-04-14T09:18:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	still, you are not running compiz, so you shouldn't need 3D. Your desktop should be in 2D mode, which a year 1998 graphics card should handle, but the dual-monitor thing might throw a kink in it
2010-04-14T09:19:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	let me rephrase. You aren't using compiz' 3D portions.
2010-04-14T09:19:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	the google says that graphics performance gets WORSE for intel gma in 9.04
2010-04-14T09:20:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	heh, I'd bet you'd agree
2010-04-14T09:21:00.000Z	awesome_guest	sinistrad	but I've found a set of relevant pages, so thank you for your help thus far
2010-04-14T09:22:00.000Z	sinistrad	awesome_guest	of course.  Sorry I couldn't be of more use.  I'm just like any other user =)
