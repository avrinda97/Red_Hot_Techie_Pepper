2008-06-04T08:11:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	I am particularly fond of postfix for for mail server, ubuntu also has exim4 (very popular)
2008-06-04T08:13:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	I use no-ip with postfix, dovecot, ssh, apache, and ftpd. I think you will be fine with all of or any :)
2008-06-04T08:15:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	Starnestommy any ideas how to configure the mail server?
2008-06-04T08:16:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	do you want the easy way, or the way people will respect you? I would suggest you use webmin, which can do a lot of the configuration for you
2008-06-04T08:17:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	both, i wnat to be a pro at this so i want to know the hard way, but i also want to try the easy way
2008-06-04T08:17:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	the hard way is pretty simple. download the entire manual for your mail server (exim4 is like 300 pages) and read it.
2008-06-04T08:18:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	... aaaa ...... what was the simple way again? :P lol
2008-06-04T08:19:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	webmin. It's a web based server administration tool. very conveniant, the problem with it is that it doesn't really teach you what is going on
2008-06-04T08:20:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	so to learn anything (like how to fix it) can take longer
2008-06-04T08:20:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	... how about wikipedia, i doubt ppl post the whole guide there, u think hey will have solutions
2008-06-04T08:21:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	the ubuntu forums is where I picked up most of what I know about postfix configurating. I set it up with webmin, the manually fixed it whenever it broke, and can find my way around pretty decently
2008-06-04T08:21:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	so you suggest reading the whole guide for this software? REcomend!
2008-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	lolno. it's insane and details every technical aspect of what is possibly the most comprehensive mail server
2008-06-04T08:23:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	btw, I hate exim4 because it is so hard to set up. I recomend postfix
2008-06-04T08:23:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	postfix it is
2008-06-04T08:26:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	it would actually be ssh -l username something.no-ip.biz
2008-06-04T08:27:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	why -l
2008-06-04T08:27:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	-l tells it that you will supply the login name. otherwise it will ask you for it
2008-06-04T08:28:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	not really, i have loged in without having to do so
2008-06-04T08:29:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	it's possible either way, just changes when you give the login
2008-06-04T09:24:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	what was the email things again??
2008-06-04T09:26:00.000Z	m_newton	Zoem	you there??
2008-06-04T09:27:00.000Z	Zoem	m_newton	postfix or exim4
