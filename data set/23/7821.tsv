2005-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	xgates		this thing is TESTING my paitence
2005-04-22T16:13:00.000Z	xgates		dammm
2005-04-22T16:14:00.000Z	xgates		I just cleaned out /tmp cleaned out some old logs in /var/log and installed gxine and now when I type --> startx as soon as the Nvidia screen comes up it craps and goes back to console no errors nothing
2005-04-22T16:14:00.000Z	xgates		ahhhhhhhhh
2005-04-22T16:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	gxine has issues - I had more luck with totem-xine
2005-04-22T16:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	actually xine-ui seems to be the most stable for me
2005-04-22T16:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	apt-cache show read-edid
2005-04-22T16:41:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	whats that cmd you just gave me I just missed it, cant scroll up for it either here in console
2005-04-22T16:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	apt-cache show read-edid
2005-04-22T16:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	read-edid is the app for finding info on monitors - that will give you a bit of info on it
2005-04-22T16:44:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	what are you suggesting?
2005-04-22T16:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	I thought that app might help you with edid
2005-04-22T16:45:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	ok just install it, or I need to do something with it?
2005-04-22T16:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	run it?
2005-04-22T16:45:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	'read-edid' do I just install it is all?
2005-04-22T16:46:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	or sorry I mean 'edid'
2005-04-22T16:47:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	ok I isntalled read-edid
2005-04-22T16:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	I think you run sudo get-edid
2005-04-22T16:50:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	ok
2005-04-22T16:51:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	ok I ran get-edid
2005-04-22T16:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	all it should do is give you some info - whether that helps I don't know
2005-04-22T16:52:00.000Z	xgates	thoreauputic	ahh now I dont know
2005-04-22T16:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xgates	as I said some time ago, I find gxine has issues - xine-ui or totem-xine seem to work much better here
