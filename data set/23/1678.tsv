2009-12-01T04:08:00.000Z	halouf		bluetooth isn't working on my laptop (hp 6830s) any way to fix this?
2009-12-01T04:08:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	have you tried searching for proprietary drivers?
2009-12-01T04:10:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	go to: System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers | It will scan your box for hardware that would require proprietary, non-open source drivers.
2009-12-01T04:12:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	the only hardware detected is my ati card
2009-12-01T04:12:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	do you have any hotkey on your keyboard to vary off/on the bluetooth antennae?
2009-12-01T04:13:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	yeah but it's turned on
2009-12-01T04:14:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	does the bluetooth logo appear at the top right with other processes?
2009-12-01T04:15:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	the appelet is there but "send files to device" and "browse files on device" are both grayed out
2009-12-01T04:16:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	it could be the device you're interfacing with blocking it and not Ubuntu. With my previous phone, I could browse the entire drive, with my new phone, I have to setup a specific folder to accept bluetooth sent items before it even allows it.
2009-12-01T04:16:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	have you tried whatever bluetooth device you're trying to interface with on anoter operating system before, as a frame of reference?
2009-12-01T04:17:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	had no problem previously on vista/xp
2009-12-01T04:17:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	have you ran an update on Ubuntu?
2009-12-01T04:18:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	I'm on 9.04
2009-12-01T04:19:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	what's the device you're trying to sync to?
2009-12-01T04:20:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	a nokia 6210 navigator
2009-12-01T04:22:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	try not setting the bluetooth "handshake" to require a PIN
2009-12-01T04:23:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	there is no pin set on my phone
2009-12-01T04:24:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	set your phone on discovery mode, then when you have the bluetooth program search for devices, un-check the box the makes it ask for a PIN or for you to make one up; there should be an option for a PIN-less handshake
2009-12-01T04:29:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	I found the problem, it's the integrated blutooth device of my laptop, plugged a usb/bluetooth adaptor and it's working fine
2009-12-01T04:29:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	thank you for your time ;)
2009-12-01T04:29:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	no problem, did that work for you?
2009-12-01T04:30:00.000Z	halouf	Fizix	yes it's working fine now
2009-12-01T04:31:00.000Z	Fizix	halouf	ok good! That was my first fix/help on here!
