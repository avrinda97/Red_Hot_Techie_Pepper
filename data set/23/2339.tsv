2009-09-29T13:58:00.000Z	RPG_Master	maxwell	I know I have space! its ubuntu who's a little confused :P
2009-09-29T13:59:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	What happened right before you apparently lost a bunch of space?
2009-09-29T13:59:00.000Z	RPG_Master	maxwell	interrupted a sbackup backup :(
2009-09-29T14:02:00.000Z	RPG_Master	maxwell	after purging those kernel configs? nope...
2009-09-29T14:04:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Just to be clear, I mean if you have a 40 GB hard drive or something, is it saying that you are using 40 GB?  Or does it think your hard drive is only 20 GB for example.
2009-09-29T14:06:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Sorry, used to my crappy old computer. ;)
2009-09-29T14:07:00.000Z	RPG_Master	maxwell	Yeah, I'll do that as soon as I am done copying my home folder to my external hard drive
2009-09-29T14:10:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Is it possible that the backup file(s) created by sbackup are taking up the extra space?
2009-09-29T14:13:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Not sure, but I've got about a 4 gig discrepancy when I look at System Monitor too.
2009-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Which makes me think that might be normal. ;)
2009-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Good luck!
2009-09-29T15:09:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	FYI, I Googled around and found that for some people, 5% of their drives were being reserved for root as a safety mechanism for when the disk fills up.
2009-09-29T15:09:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	That's why there's a difference between "free" space and "available" space.
2009-09-29T15:10:00.000Z	RPG_Master	maxwell	interesting....
2009-09-29T15:14:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	If you haven't already, take a minute to start a du running to give you a summary of disk space usage.
2009-09-29T15:15:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Right, and on my crummy old 32-bit processor, that du can take a little while.  Let it work while you sleep. :)
2009-09-29T15:15:00.000Z	RPG_Master	maxwell	done for me :P
2009-09-29T15:16:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	...  Couldn't resist, could you.
2009-09-29T15:16:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Pipe it into sort.
2009-09-29T15:22:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Don't worry about those errors.  Those are from processes that were running and closed during the du.
2009-09-29T15:24:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Now do the du -h /home/<yourname>
2009-09-29T15:25:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Yes, / is the whole tamale.  What's the biggest folder under / ?
2009-09-29T15:29:00.000Z	maxwell	RPG_Master	Night!
