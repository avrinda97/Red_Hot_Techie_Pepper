2004-12-02T12:42:00.000Z	eruin		ubuntu needs a gui for services/runlevels
2004-12-02T12:44:00.000Z	Keybuk	eruin	I tend to agree we need some kind of UI to select running software
2004-12-02T12:44:00.000Z	eruin	Keybuk	could take a look at fedoras approach
2004-12-02T12:45:00.000Z	Keybuk		but that needs to be totally abstract, the same UI should let you start and stop things like esd and the GNOME typing monitor, personal web server, etc. than system-level "services"
2004-12-02T12:45:00.000Z	Keybuk		certainly we don't need to expose runlevels anywhere near the user
2004-12-02T12:45:00.000Z	Keybuk	eruin	screenshot?
2004-12-02T12:45:00.000Z	eruin		hm, I could reboot and take one
2004-12-02T12:45:00.000Z	Keybuk	eruin	what's the app called?  I'll Google for it
2004-12-02T12:46:00.000Z	Keybuk		http://fedora.redhat.com/projects/config-tools/images/redhat-config-services.png
2004-12-02T12:46:00.000Z	Keybuk		^ that?
2004-12-02T12:46:00.000Z	Keybuk		that's way over-the-top
2004-12-02T12:47:00.000Z	eruin	Keybuk	yes, doesn't look exactly like that anymore but yeah tahts the one
2004-12-02T12:47:00.000Z	eruin		it's more cluttered now ;)
2004-12-02T12:47:00.000Z	Keybuk		seriously, there's no need for that in a UI
2004-12-02T12:47:00.000Z	Keybuk		if you know enough to use that dialog, you know enough to change the symlinks on the filesystem
2004-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	eruin	Keybuk	no, in ubuntus spirit it should be more userfriendly ofcourse, and since we're focusing in rl5 in ubuntu, lots is not needed
2004-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	Keybuk		I'd probably integrate it with a security dialog actually as well
2004-12-02T12:48:00.000Z	Keybuk		so you'd get a pretty list of running software, and could specify whether it should run or not and customise access control to it (through tcpwrapper/iptables)
2004-12-02T12:49:00.000Z	Keybuk		link it to the "Add and Remove Programs" dialog too
2004-12-02T12:49:00.000Z	eruin	Keybuk	yeah, that sounds nice ;)
2004-12-02T12:49:00.000Z	Keybuk	eruin	I have a vague idea anyway, I'll mock up a UI in Mataro for it
2004-12-02T12:50:00.000Z	eruin	Keybuk	will you let me have a look once you've got something? ;)
2004-12-02T12:50:00.000Z	Keybuk	eruin	sure.
