2012-07-07T00:30:00.000Z	agike		Hi, I have just deleted /boot on natty. Any advice on how to restore it .. ?
2012-07-07T00:32:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	reinstall grub
2012-07-07T00:41:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	'grub-install /dev/sda' seems to have done it. I will have to try a reboot ..
2012-07-07T00:44:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	can you send a uname -r ?
2012-07-07T00:50:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	not from synaptic -- in LXTerminal. On a debian/ubuntu dual-boot, update-grub only recognises the debian kernel at the moment ..
2012-07-07T00:51:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	/boot/ needs to be filled with linux-image System-map and initrd  i think
2012-07-07T00:56:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	to me ?
2012-07-07T01:00:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	I already have menuentry "Debian Linux" {
2012-07-07T01:01:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	sorry, i though it was grub2
2012-07-07T01:01:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	you might have to reinstall though
2012-07-07T01:01:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	don't know if I want to cange it. grub-mkconfig makes a symlink .. ?
2012-07-07T01:02:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	nevermind, i was talking about grub2
2012-07-07T01:08:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	this time I'm getting 5 lines of 'sudo' usage advice ..
2012-07-07T01:09:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	maybe its -e
2012-07-07T01:12:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	it now goes into the 'joe' editor. Is that OK ? I'm getting washed-out text on the screen so can't see the details ..
2012-07-07T01:33:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	I hate to be boring, but now I get sudo -i "grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg"
2012-07-07T01:37:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	there is a command sudo -? "mpla mpla mpla", but one can see it with "sudo --help" , i don't have sudo installed
2012-07-07T01:43:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	i believe it should have made an entry, unless you're mistaking the partitions
2012-07-07T01:44:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	yes it does
2012-07-07T01:46:00.000Z	Cottus	agike	did you mix up the partitions? is /boot/ empty ?
2012-07-07T01:51:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	Thanks - I might try a debian live CD ..
2012-07-07T03:09:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	I don't know what it tells us, but 'sudo os-prober' recognises debian, but not ubuntu
2012-07-07T03:21:00.000Z	agike	Cottus	os-prober does not recognise ubuntu .. que pasa ?
