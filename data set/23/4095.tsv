2007-11-19T09:13:00.000Z	fenn	domor	what timezone are you in?
2007-11-19T09:15:00.000Z	fenn	domor	you are doing good you found the IRC and you are asking questions.

2007-11-19T09:16:00.000Z	fenn	domor	macd tried ... sounds like you should try the UBUNTU drivers instead of the generic ones.
2007-11-19T09:17:00.000Z	fenn	domor	If you have X working open up firefox and google a bit, you might find what you are looking for.
2007-11-19T09:19:00.000Z	fenn	domor	or take a break and get a bite to eat, and a good night's sleep and try IRC again
