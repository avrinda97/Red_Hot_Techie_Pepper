2006-05-12T09:36:00.000Z	holycow		what do you mean?
2006-05-12T09:36:00.000Z	holycow		this isn't windows you know
2006-05-12T09:36:00.000Z	holycow		apps don't update them selves
2006-05-12T09:36:00.000Z	holycow		thats the job of the packaging mechanism,in our case dpkg
2006-05-12T09:36:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	firefox has a built in updator for all platforms
2006-05-12T09:37:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	this isn't windows bro :)
2006-05-12T09:37:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	that is a bad reason to disable features in software
2006-05-12T09:38:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	i agree, they should update when I tell them to
2006-05-12T09:38:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	no they should be updated by the package manager
2006-05-12T10:07:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	as long as you have an internet connection that can handle endless updates
2006-05-12T10:08:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	it is generally best to install from a cd
2006-05-12T10:08:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	as i found out during my dapper dist upgrade, way too many things to clean up
2006-05-12T10:09:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	i'd like to see eventually a checkbox that lets you wipe all settings but keep your home dir (minus . files)
2006-05-12T10:09:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	I learned a long time ago to keep a seperate /home partition
2006-05-12T10:10:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	heh, indeed i'm starting to do that too now *nod* right same thing
2006-05-12T10:10:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	don't forget to put /usr/local , and if necessary /var
2006-05-12T10:13:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	thats not exactly true
2006-05-12T10:13:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	hes trying to get the windows idiocy on linux
2006-05-12T10:13:00.000Z	holycow	mz111	as i've said earlier you guys should really jus tpoint him back to redmond
2006-05-12T10:14:00.000Z	mz111	holycow	I had to vommit after making that recomendation
