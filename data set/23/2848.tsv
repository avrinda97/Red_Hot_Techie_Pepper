2008-10-29T21:35:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	woot, it worked, i just had to push the sleep to about 6 seconds!!, thanks again man.
2008-10-29T21:35:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	oh, in the end, all it took was the & at the end
2008-10-29T21:36:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	that did it? hmm.. didn't work my little test script.. well.. glad it works for you..
2008-10-29T21:36:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	make a not of the command setsid for the next time.. it looked useful
2008-10-29T21:37:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	 because as I looked it more, it wasnt having problems closing out, it was having problems with the device not being fully registered
2008-10-29T21:38:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	ah.. might be some flag in /proc to look at.. if one wants to do it "the proper way" =)
2008-10-29T21:38:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	what is the "proper" way? use a daemon or something?
2008-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	or have the script run a loop until the flag is set?
2008-10-29T21:39:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	yes.. run a loop, checking the flag every second or so..
2008-10-29T21:40:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	how would i begin to look in /proc for a flag like that?
2008-10-29T21:40:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	I wouldn't just look around.. I would try to find some documentation on udev
2008-10-29T21:40:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	im not doing that, haha, it was hard enough to get this thing working like i want
2008-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	hehe..
2008-10-29T21:41:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	you said you run a GSM modem, do you have it start automatically when you plug it in?
2008-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	hmmm.. I've used my cellphone for internet together with my laptop, yes
2008-10-29T21:42:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	but that was using bluetooth.. and gnome-ppp.. nothing special fancy
2008-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	and I had to write some long things on a terminal window before I got the connection up
2008-10-29T21:43:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	i am using usb and pppd, its pretty cool, i used udev to detect when the thing is plugged in by vendor and product id, then have it run the startup script
2008-10-29T21:44:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	im assuming your pppd peer file and chat script?
2008-10-29T21:44:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	sounds neat
2008-10-29T21:44:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	no, mostly weird bluetooth connection stuff... hci bla bla.. irconn bla bla long weird hex numbers and stuff
2008-10-29T21:46:00.000Z	xtian__	Slart	cool, well thanks again
2008-10-29T21:46:00.000Z	Slart	xtian__	you're welcome
