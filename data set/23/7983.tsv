2005-03-09T16:02:00.000Z	mseney		could this be because Realplayer for Linux doesn't have an EQ ?
2005-03-09T16:04:00.000Z	mseney		i was trying to show off linux to my girlfriend but failed w/ that one
2005-03-09T16:05:00.000Z	mseney		or is it more dependant on the speaker system?
2005-03-09T16:06:00.000Z	mseney		I bought a Logitech 2.1 system 32Watts RMS they sound excellent, i really want to get the same sound from plugging them into my linxu box
2005-03-09T16:07:00.000Z	mseney		so to fix this problem maybe i need a better sound card that linux has decent drivers built into the kernel?
2005-03-09T16:08:00.000Z	mseney		i used the same 2.1 setup, 2 satellites and 1 sub
2005-03-09T16:09:00.000Z	mseney		and it sounds way better on the windows machine
2005-03-09T16:09:00.000Z	mseney		i'll have to try it again later
2005-03-09T16:10:00.000Z	mseney		i should try using xmms and a CD so i can play w/ a EQ
2005-03-09T16:10:00.000Z	mseney		is xmms pretty much what everyone uses on ubuntu for playing cd's, mp3, ogg's, etc..??
2005-03-09T16:11:00.000Z	cg0def	mseney	if you use gnome you'd probably like beep-media-player better
2005-03-09T16:12:00.000Z	mseney	cg0def	yeah i use gnome now.
2005-03-09T16:12:00.000Z	mseney	cg0def	ubuntu converted me back to it
2005-03-09T16:12:00.000Z	cg0def	mseney	well I still like debian better
2005-03-09T16:13:00.000Z	cg0def	mseney	the new gnome kinda syx in some places
2005-03-09T16:13:00.000Z	cg0def	mseney	like the applications menu
2005-03-09T16:21:00.000Z	mseney	cg0def	im not setup to the universe. so i can't apt-get it. if i setup to the universe doesn't that mean i won't get security updates for programs i get from it?
2005-03-09T16:21:00.000Z	mseney	cg0def	in regards to that media player
2005-03-09T16:22:00.000Z	cg0def	mseney	I am not really sure where the player was but if you add universe I don't think there are any security updates for it
2005-03-09T16:22:00.000Z	mseney	cg0def	yeah i think i'll pass on that then.
2005-03-09T16:22:00.000Z	cg0def	mseney	but you don't really need security updates for pkg from universe as long as you update the versions
2005-03-09T16:23:00.000Z	mseney	cg0def	why not any for xmms?
2005-03-09T16:24:00.000Z	mseney	cg0def	k thanks.
