2007-06-02T05:09:00.000Z	FFighter		Anyone ?
2007-06-02T05:09:00.000Z	FFighter		I really need a hand here!
2007-06-02T05:10:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	can you ping your router?
2007-06-02T05:10:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	I don't have a router
2007-06-02T05:11:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	how are you connected to your sisters box? Crossover cable?
2007-06-02T05:11:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	Here's the layout: I've got a usb modem (speedtouch usb) which connects to the internet, then a eth0 that directly connects to the XP machine
2007-06-02T05:12:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	directly through ethernet wired network
2007-06-02T05:12:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	the eth0 cable needs to be a crossover cable for a direct connection.
2007-06-02T05:12:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	It worked fine when I had XP installed
2007-06-02T05:12:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	both LAN (windows network) and the internet connection sharing
2007-06-02T05:13:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	Ok, can you ping your sisters box?
2007-06-02T05:13:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	Nops, I can't... btw, I followed this tutorial: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370 but couldn't make it to work
2007-06-02T05:13:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	Maybe seeing my ifconfig output would help ?
2007-06-02T05:14:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	yes, pastepin the output of ifconfig.
2007-06-02T05:14:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	I guess that the problem is my modem... it creates a "nas0" interface and also ppp0
2007-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	ignore the modem for now.
2007-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	Ok, just a min
2007-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	and thanks for helping =)
2007-06-02T05:16:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	nada, I enjoy problem solving. :)
2007-06-02T05:17:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	I'm having problems pasting it to pastebin.com (internet errors from the pastebin app) do you have another site where I could paste it ?
2007-06-02T05:17:00.000Z	FFighter		ops, I meant INTERNAL not INTERNET errors
2007-06-02T05:18:00.000Z	n2diy_	FFighter	things are quite in #ubuntu-classroom
2007-06-02T05:18:00.000Z	FFighter	n2diy_	Just got there
