2008-08-03T01:38:00.000Z	Illusioneer		hi, i am having a problem getting ruby to update
2008-08-03T01:38:00.000Z	Illusioneer		it's stuck at 1.8.2 (useless) when all the docs say it should be showing 1.8.6
2008-08-03T01:39:00.000Z	Illusioneer		in fact the ruby-dev even shows as 1.8.6 but if you do "ruby -v" it still shows as 1.8.2
2008-08-03T01:39:00.000Z	Illusioneer		so it's not actually updating anything
2008-08-03T01:40:00.000Z	Illusioneer		i even tried installing 1.9 but that was utterly useless

2008-08-03T01:40:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	what's the output from `apt-cache policy ruby1.8'?
2008-08-03T01:41:00.000Z	Illusioneer	crimsun	however the actual executable swears that it's only 1.8.2
2008-08-03T01:42:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	verify that `which ruby` is in fact pointing to the intended version of ruby.
2008-08-03T01:44:00.000Z	Illusioneer	crimsun	the actual binary in the /usr/local/bin is version 1.8.2
2008-08-03T01:44:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	you do know that /usr/local/bin takes precedence over /usr/bin and that Ubuntu packages do not use /usr/local/bin per Debian Policy, correct?
2008-08-03T01:44:00.000Z	Illusioneer	crimsun	here's the feedback from the apt-cache and version - http://pastebin.com/m48589f26
2008-08-03T01:44:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	i.e., who compiled and installed 1.8.2 into /usr/local ?
2008-08-03T01:46:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	it's pretty clear that /no/ official Ubuntu package will create a /usr/local/bin/ruby*
2008-08-03T01:46:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	so I'm going to ask again :) - where did you get a non-official version that installed there?
2008-08-03T01:46:00.000Z	Illusioneer	crimsun	well this is a plain straight from the download install on a vmware, i haven't tweaked it in any way
2008-08-03T01:47:00.000Z	Illusioneer	crimsun	again, i went through and did a search on ANY package even mentioning ruby and removed it
2008-08-03T01:47:00.000Z	Illusioneer	crimsun	if anything is in there, it is doing so without my knowledge
2008-08-03T01:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	how did you install gems?
2008-08-03T01:50:00.000Z	Illusioneer	crimsun	even when i axed the copy of ruby in /usr/local/bin it now throws a tantrum, how is it thinking this is the proper location for ruby if this is against policy???
2008-08-03T01:51:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	apt-cache policy rubygems
2008-08-03T02:02:00.000Z	crimsun	Illusioneer	any progress on pastebinning that `apt-cache policy rubygems'?
