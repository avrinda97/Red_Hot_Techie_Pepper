2005-03-25T13:00:00.000Z	mackid		so i installed the nvidia driver as it explained on ubuntuguide.org, and i hit ctrl-alt-bkspc to restart X, but it didn't restart it, it just killed it
2005-03-25T13:00:00.000Z	mackid		and now when i login and then % sudo gdm, it says it's already running
2005-03-25T13:01:00.000Z	mackid		so how do i get back to X?
2005-03-25T13:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	do sudo -s (enter your user password)
2005-03-25T13:01:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	then what?
2005-03-25T13:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	then do killall gdm      followed by /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-03-25T13:02:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	i'll try that, thanks
2005-03-25T13:04:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	that worked, thank you
2005-03-25T13:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	sometimes you need to do a restart x to get things running properly :)
2005-03-26T12:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	try installing libmp4-0
2005-03-26T12:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	that's if your runnig Hoary I don't knwo about Warty
2005-03-26T12:04:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	i am running hoary.  so just install that and see if it works?  anything else i have to do?
2005-03-26T12:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	I did apt-cache serach aac and it brought up a few libraries that might help getting it working. >> libfaad2-0 might be one that you need as well, I am just guessing :D
2005-03-26T12:07:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	libmp4-0 doesn't seem to be a package that exists, at least in the repos i have
2005-03-26T12:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	do you have universe enabled ?
2005-03-26T12:08:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	i believe i do
2005-03-26T12:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	it's in the mirillat repositories
2005-03-26T12:09:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	ok
2005-03-26T12:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	add that repo then apt-get update and it outta be there
2005-04-19T13:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	yeah xorg will read the XF86Config-4 file if it exists
2005-04-19T13:55:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	it's called a metapackage, all it does is reference a bunch of files to download as dependencies
2005-05-10T16:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mackid	you installed Ubuntu ?
2005-05-10T16:38:00.000Z	mackid	LinuxJones	no, i don't have it installed yet =P  had it installed before, but wiped so I'd have windows also
