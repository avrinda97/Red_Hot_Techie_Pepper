2011-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 are you dropping to text console on boot?
2011-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	  ok  try  sudo restart gdm
2011-03-20T18:12:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 ok try   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-03-20T18:13:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 ah I see,,, can you hard wire for the updates?
2011-03-20T18:14:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	  I am not there... I dont know what options you have for internet,,, besides wireless... but if you have cable connection that should work temporatily for the inital updateing
2011-03-20T18:15:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 ok then do the sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade     to see if that fixes the problem
2011-03-20T18:16:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 cool
2011-03-20T18:20:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 which vide card      lspci | grep -i vga
2011-03-20T18:22:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 ok and this is ubuntu 10.10...yes?
2011-03-20T18:23:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 you can try  sudo apt-get install nvidia-current  ,,, I believe the fx5200 can use that driver
2011-03-20T18:23:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	  you have to reboot  after that
2011-03-20T18:25:00.000Z	GEagle	coz_	it has already installed
2011-03-20T18:27:00.000Z	coz_	GEagle	 mm   it should boot into the system with nouveau driver  as fallback ... you can reboot holding down the left Shift key to get to the grub menu,,, press the  "e" key to get to kernel stanza to edit it... just before   quiet splad  type    nomodeset  then hit the listed approprate key to boot from there,, see if that gets you into the DE
