2010-04-29T09:51:00.000Z	twiztid	ActionParsnip	could i pastebin it to you for a quick look?
2010-05-13T11:14:00.000Z	twiztid	ActionParsnip	thx, i have compiz installed, hrm well my delema is that i want KMS so cairo dock is smooth, but compiz and gnome dont like direct-rendering with KMS, so i utilized a workaround soreau suggested to force indirect rendering on startup, what would be the best driver to use with a 512mb AGP ATI Radeon X1300 card?
2010-05-13T11:20:00.000Z	twiztid	ActionParsnip	ok, well no that reverts to my original problem, because it enables direct rendering which for some reason KMS on and directrendering enabled is horribly slow and choppy, and so instead of disable KMS and lose openGL cairo dock, ive set up for indirect rendering upon startup, so what would you suggest the best driver for my card be, if any?
2010-05-13T11:22:00.000Z	twiztid	ActionParsnip	i8 no worries, thx for the added insight, its alwayz appreciated, and ya im in compiz, ati, and radeon... lol

2010-09-28T11:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	twiztid	its for runing xp under virtualbox running in ubuntu but the opposite may work. You could also ask in #vbox

2011-03-10T07:47:00.000Z	twiztid	ActionParsnip	oh sorry, I was wanting to spread the news about a fix for new ubuntu 10.10 installs causing 5 to 10 second screen flickering that was posted 6 days ago and COMPLETELY fixed it ANNND effects to still work! =) Apparently it affects quite a few people and so post #7 and #8 from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/665233?comments=all solves it!!! so happy now!!! =)
