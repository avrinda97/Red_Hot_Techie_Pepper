2007-10-27T21:33:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		How do you mount an ISO?
2007-10-27T21:33:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	sudo mount -o loop isofile.iso /mnt/point
2007-10-31T09:39:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	VLC?
2007-10-31T09:39:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	scguy318	VLC media player
2007-10-31T09:40:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	reason is that VLC doesn't handle smb://
2007-10-31T09:40:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	whereas Rhythmbox and those other GNOME apps can handle smb://
2007-10-31T09:41:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	a workaround would be to mount the SMB share using smbfs
2007-10-31T09:42:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	scguy318	Newbie here. How would i do that? Also what would happen if i turned the windows pc off?
2007-10-31T09:43:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	sudo apt-get install smbfs, then sudo mount -t smbfs //ip/share /mnt/point -o lfs,rw
2007-10-31T09:43:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	if you turned the PC off while it's mounted, the unmaintained smbfs would kinda just kill itself, thus preventing you from unmounting it for a bit
2007-10-31T09:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	there probably are better solutions
2007-10-31T09:44:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	scguy318	It'd start working again as soon as i turned the pc on?
2007-10-31T09:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	not sure
2007-10-31T09:44:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	scguy318	The windows pc also needs a password to get onto the network. The keyring manager is currently handling that but would it stsill work with your mmethod?
2007-10-31T09:45:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	yeah, you'll be prompted for password when you mount I think
2007-10-31T09:45:00.000Z	scguy318	Flynsarmy	lemme look for a better solution

2007-10-31T10:17:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	scguy318	I tried both xSMBrowser and the other one mentioned on that page but neither work. xsm found 2 networks (Samba Config and Samba Config (Wins Service) but clicking on either returned an 'Unable to find Domain Master' error
