2008-04-29T23:34:00.000Z	Brent^		ï»¿I have a Broadcom BCM4306 and so far from some guides I've found I managed to get it to show the wireless access points around me. However I have yet yo be able to CONNECT to any of them. Is there something I'm missing or that I have to do? (installed bcm43xx-fwcutter to get this far)
2008-04-29T23:35:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	are you using HH?
2008-04-29T23:35:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	yes
2008-04-29T23:36:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	Use the Broadcom B43 driver under Administration > Hardware Drivers
2008-04-29T23:36:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	Make sure "Enabled" is checked and that you are connected to the Internet over a LAN connection
2008-04-29T23:37:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	didn't work
2008-04-29T23:38:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	what didn't work about it?  Is that one showing 'Enabled' and 'In use'?
2008-04-29T23:38:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	yes. I still can't connect to the internet through the access points though
2008-04-29T23:39:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	can you see them?
2008-04-29T23:39:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	yes
2008-04-29T23:39:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	have you rebooted since updating the driver?   Sounds Windows-like, but worked for me.
2008-04-29T23:41:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	like 3 times now, but it hasn't been showing that box in that hardware screen till now
2008-04-29T23:41:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	well if you just checked it, and installed the hardware, reboot and see if you can connect.
2008-04-29T23:42:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	are the networks WPA or WEP?  Can you connect to non-encrypted ones/
2008-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	unencrypted
2008-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	 have you tried another network?
2008-04-29T23:44:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	there are no other networks in this area
2008-04-29T23:44:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	nope reboot didn't work
2008-04-29T23:44:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	well in order to rule out another problem, you might want to go somewhere that there is.  Can you reboot the wireless router that you are trying to connect to?
2008-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	it isn't the router, I'm connected with a different computer to that router right now and it works fine. I tried connecting to another network that's across the street but that didn't work either
2008-04-29T23:47:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	I would still recommend rebooting the router if you have access.   Have you tried connecting to the other network since installing the B43 driver?
2008-04-29T23:47:00.000Z	Brent^	kesi	just tried both of those, neither worked
2008-04-29T23:48:00.000Z	kesi	Brent^	Don't know what to tell you then... you could try setting a static IP to see if it's a DHCP problem
