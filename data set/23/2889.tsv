2008-10-13T06:21:00.000Z	srpenney		I have just installed Ubuntu desktop (8.04.1) on a PC.  In said PC I have a PCI raid card (promise TX2300) with two 500GB drives configured as a RAID1 array.  The drives in the raid array are partitioned into three partitions (200GB, 200GB and 100GB).  I would expect to see, in my Nautilus window, three drives (in addition to the normal drives present).  What I am seeing though is two instances of each partition.
2008-10-13T06:23:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	your interface is not supported
2008-10-13T06:25:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	I had a previous install on a much older PC that I was able to get up and running (I had to come here and people gave me a hand in installing a few things I needed).  This was on an older version of Ubuntu.  This version seems better because it picked up the card without me having to install anything.  The other one wouldn't see anything and I had to install a few things.  Unfortunately I didn't write do
2008-10-13T06:26:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	yep, the modules are reading your interface wrongly, raid0?
2008-10-13T06:26:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	raid 1 is what I've configured in the PCI cards bios.
2008-10-13T06:27:00.000Z	srpenney		I don't know how to check how the interface is read though.  Is there a terminal command I can use
2008-10-13T06:27:00.000Z	srpenney		?
2008-10-13T06:27:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	try with raid0 first and see what happens
2008-10-13T06:27:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	There's already information that I don't want to lose.
2008-10-13T06:28:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	backup ASAP
2008-10-13T06:29:00.000Z	bunnyto		Raids are the safest way to loss information!!
2008-10-13T06:31:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	I don't have enough free space to make a backup (without using the 500GB drives that make up the array).  I seem to recall the drives had to have something special installed to work (I wish I could be more clear but I really can't).
2008-10-13T06:31:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	thanks for the patience BTW
2008-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	try liveCD to see whether detects the raid
2008-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	Will do.
2008-10-13T06:34:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	yeah its a problem with the modules, some models are not well supported
2008-10-13T06:35:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	is liveCD the main CD I downloaded from ubuntu.com.  I followed the links for the main desktop installation.
2008-10-13T06:35:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	Fits (just) on a full CD
2008-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	yeah its the first option i think
2008-10-13T06:37:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	and to use it to pick up the card do I just dump it in while running or do I boot from CD?
2008-10-13T06:38:00.000Z	bunnyto	srpenney	just boot with the 1st option
2008-10-13T06:39:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	Does this mean that I have to re-install everything or can I just add the modules to the existing install this way?
2008-10-13T06:42:00.000Z	srpenney	bunnyto	liveCD does not pick up the RAID1 array either.  Any other ideas.
