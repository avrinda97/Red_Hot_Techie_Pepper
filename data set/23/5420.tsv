2007-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	con-man		the default one with gnome
2007-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	con-man		the nautilus one
2007-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	burning discs is pretty simple on linux.
2007-03-12T13:21:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	you must be new to linux.  You a little patience at first buy you'll eventually get the hang of it.  I'm now at the point where I can do anything on linux that I can do on windows except games.
2007-03-12T13:22:00.000Z	con-man	nomin	Ive been using linux for only a few months, yes.  Its just odd that it wont burn cds.  Sometimes when I press the eject button on the drive the tray wont even open
2007-03-12T13:23:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	yeah, on ubuntu I have to right click the cd icon and tell it to eject.  It won't eject when I press the button on the cdrom drive for me, either, but it's not a problem.
2007-03-12T13:24:00.000Z	con-man	nomin	that wont work either
2007-03-12T13:24:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	I use k3b to burn discs.  I think it's the best burning app because it does a lot of stuff.  I've never used nautilus to burn.
2007-03-12T13:25:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	is your disc mounted?
2007-03-12T13:25:00.000Z	con-man	nomin	it was
2007-03-12T13:26:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	is there a cd icon on your desktop that showed up when you inserted the disc?
2007-03-12T13:27:00.000Z	con-man	nomin	k3b is installed, but now wont open
2007-03-12T13:27:00.000Z	con-man	nomin	I use gnome, not kde, does that matter
2007-03-12T13:27:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	what version of ubuntu do you have installed?
2007-03-12T13:28:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	I have dapper installed and when I insert a cd, an icon shows up on the desktop.
2007-03-12T13:28:00.000Z	con-man	nomin	so does mine
2007-03-12T13:29:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	you can run kde apps on gnome and gnome apps on kde.
2007-03-12T13:32:00.000Z	nomin	con-man	I don't know why k3b won't open up for you.  I have it installed and I've never had a problem with it.
