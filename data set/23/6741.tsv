2006-04-21T06:14:00.000Z	__mikem		I like the way linux deals with hidden files, it just makes file names starting with a '.' hidden, but windows makes it a file attribute which is bound to take up lots of space in the file system table in the long run
2006-04-21T06:15:00.000Z	__mikem		for proof, take a look at any LG Cell Phone
2006-04-21T06:15:00.000Z	__mikem		or Samsung for that matter

2006-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	__mikem		if you guys don't stop fighting, I will be forced to call on the ops
2006-04-21T06:18:00.000Z	__mikem		if you can't get the hang of it after about 2 weeks trying, then I am afraid you must be in the later catagory
2006-04-21T06:20:00.000Z	__mikem		[Chameleon]  what was that guys story anyway
2006-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	__mikem		[Chameleon]  Yes, I am aware, I didn't see any exit mesages associated with his irc session, but I was just wondering because i made a backhanded remark implicating his lack of knowlege at computers in general
2006-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	__mikem		I just wanted to make sure it was noone important
2006-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	amphi	__mikem	that is the common condition of windows refugees, it seems
