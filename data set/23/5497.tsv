2008-05-31T06:39:00.000Z	Polygon89	JoshJ	i tried installing them from envy but every time i just got a white screen when i tried to log in, the only way i could see stuff if i used a 'failsafe gnome' session
2008-05-31T06:39:00.000Z	Polygon89	JoshJ	and it worked before. Im positive that if i reinstall ubuntu it would work fine but i really dont want to reinstall =/
2008-05-31T06:40:00.000Z	JoshJ	Polygon89	did you just upgrade from gutsy to hardy?
2008-05-31T06:40:00.000Z	Polygon89	JoshJ	this installation is a upgrade from gutsy but i upgraded a couple days before hardy came out.

2008-05-31T06:44:00.000Z	Polygon89	JoshJ	ill go restart x and see if that magically fixed it.

2008-05-31T06:50:00.000Z	JoshJ	Polygon89	my problem was different; it was an actual fglrx issue and i had to nuke envy and the driver
