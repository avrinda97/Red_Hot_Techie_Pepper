2007-07-05T08:21:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	not sure i'm entirely understanding you, but if it were me i'd probably try to figure out a way to hack it with symlinks
2007-07-05T08:22:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	um...i haven't quite understood symlinks, can you explain? and for example, i want firefox's settings, .mozilla, to be stored in /home/matt/Data/Settings/.mozilla, instead of /home/matt/.mozilla/
2007-07-05T08:24:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	now you have a symlink in your home directory that points to that Data location
2007-07-05T08:24:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	it's like a shortcut in Windows if that makes any sense
2007-07-05T08:24:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	so how would i create one?
2007-07-05T08:25:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	please read what I wrote
2007-07-05T08:25:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	also lookup symlink on wikipedia for more background info
2007-07-05T08:26:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	so how would i do it for everything in /matt/
2007-07-05T08:27:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	the best thing to do at this point is to play around with symlinks for a little bit so you understand it
2007-07-05T08:27:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	make yourself a little test area with some directories and files, make some symlinks, get comfortable with the concept, then apply that to the problem you're trying to solve.
2007-07-05T08:28:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	for extra bonus points, teach yourself the difference between symbolic links and hard links
2007-07-05T08:28:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	ok, so ln -s is what i need to play with? and would ln -h be a hard link? i'll just need to figure out the difference
2007-07-05T08:29:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	so ln
2007-07-05T08:43:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	ok, i think i have it, -s if for dir, hard is for devices???
2007-07-05T08:43:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	no not at all
2007-07-05T08:43:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	really?
2007-07-05T08:43:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	really
2007-07-05T08:44:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	well, i can't do a hard link on a dir, i don't think
2007-07-05T08:44:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	hard links are useful for certain types of problems
2007-07-05T08:44:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	but could i do this? copy all my /matt to /Data or whatver, then ln -s /home
2007-07-05T08:45:00.000Z	boojit	matt__	i recommend you make yourself a test directory, then put some test dirs and files in that directory
2007-07-05T08:45:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	i did
2007-07-05T08:53:00.000Z	matt__	boojit	hey, i created a -s at /home/matt/Desktop to /home/matt/Data/ , how can i remove it?
