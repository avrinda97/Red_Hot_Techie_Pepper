2010-08-05T07:58:00.000Z	linuxmascot		I'm seeking some help. It deals with upgrading from 8.04 to 10.04, when ever one of you has a spare minute, It'd be appreciated.

2010-08-05T08:01:00.000Z	linuxmascot		Thank you
2010-08-05T08:02:00.000Z	linuxmascot		Well, i've tried to upgrade from ubuntu 8.04 to 10.04 two times, each time the update freezez when it gets to installing the 10.04 dbus. So 75% through the update it freezes, and I have to completely re-format my computer back to 8.04 because on restart it tries to boot 10.04, which didn't fully install.
2010-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	Wiesshund	linuxmascot	how old is the pc? 10.04 may not be the choice for some older hardware
2010-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	linuxmascot		I upgraded through the terminal with the update command ' update-manager- d'
2010-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	linuxmascot		it's not THAT old.
2010-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	linuxmascot		I'm running a 2.6ghz, 1gb ram, 32 bit graphics card computer.
2010-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	linuxmascot		acer extensa 4220
2010-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	Wiesshund	linuxmascot	well 8.X is pretty old :) is why i asked
2010-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	linuxmascot		Well, I don't have any blank cd's, and my two flash drives are gone. I was hoping to get it resolved tonight.
2010-08-05T08:04:00.000Z	Wiesshund	linuxmascot	what Tecna said, except you could use unetbooting since youve no media to use
2010-08-05T08:05:00.000Z	linuxmascot		I've never net booted
2010-08-05T08:07:00.000Z	linuxmascot		wiess: I've never net booted, how would I start that process.
2010-08-05T08:08:00.000Z	linuxmascot	Tecna	well that takes the fun out of computing, doesn't it? : p
2010-08-05T08:09:00.000Z	linuxmascot	Tecna	I suppose I can wait
2010-08-05T08:09:00.000Z	Wiesshund	linuxmascot	you got room on your drive to download the 10.04 ISO?
2010-08-05T08:09:00.000Z	linuxmascot		Wiess: yes

2010-08-05T08:10:00.000Z	Wiesshund	linuxmascot	you can give that a go. it would let you boot the liveCD from a location on the hard drive
