2011-03-21T19:46:00.000Z	bahaa		how to reinstall "apt-get autoremove" packages? (I've deleted half the system)
2011-03-21T19:46:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	lol. what's up
2011-03-21T19:48:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	i understand, sometimes it's because of the deps of the packages. usually you needn't worry about them
2011-03-21T19:49:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot : I always use it but this time it's different
2011-03-21T19:49:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot : it has deleted totem, empathy, and many other programs :(
2011-03-21T19:50:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	why not just get back whatever you what
2011-03-21T19:51:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	you've got a point of view but the problem I don't know the libs it deleted, dvds don't work any more :)
2011-03-21T19:52:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	apt-get install totem ?
2011-03-21T19:52:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot: should'nt be there a place where it logs what has been deleted?
2011-03-21T19:53:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	Segmentation fault :D
2011-03-21T19:54:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	;->
2011-03-21T19:55:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot : I've got a huge log would it be beneficial to post it?
2011-03-21T19:57:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot : gedit is deleted, too
2011-03-21T19:57:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot: I said half of the system
2011-03-21T19:59:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	grep -n  'autoremove'  /var/log/apt/history.log
2011-03-21T19:59:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	and you can see when and where you autoremoved
2011-03-21T20:02:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot: the computer freezed
2011-03-21T20:02:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	why
2011-03-21T20:03:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	I feel it's because half of the system isn't there
2011-03-21T20:04:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot : can't I undo autoremove?
2011-03-21T20:04:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot: I suspect the problem is I installed netbeans
2011-03-21T20:04:00.000Z	v_v	bahaa	reinstall ubuntu-desktop should be ok
2011-03-21T20:06:00.000Z	bahaa	v_v	iceroot : and after installation it said installation didn't go fine, so I tried "apt-get install netbeans" and it said netbeans is the newest version but suggested to autoremove about 270 MB
