2011-01-24T18:30:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	Did you replace /new/file/on/hd/test with an actual path?
2011-01-24T18:31:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	Probably in /media/  do sudo mount -l to get a list
2011-01-24T18:33:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	Is it an automount USB drive?
2011-01-24T18:33:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	Is it USB?
2011-01-24T18:34:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	Did you just plugit in and it mounted or did you use a command
2011-01-24T18:35:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	do, sudo mount -l  and pastebin the output
2011-01-24T18:35:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	paste.ubuntu.com
2011-01-24T18:36:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	get the end of dmesg as well
2011-01-24T18:41:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	sudo fsck.vfat -a /dev/sdc1
2011-01-24T18:41:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	sorry, typo
2011-01-24T18:42:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	No
2011-01-24T18:44:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	You asked it to check for the fs for cluster errors and other stuff. Reconnect the drove and test
2011-01-24T18:44:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	What was the output from command?
2011-01-24T18:44:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	Naa, just unplug it
2011-01-24T18:48:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	Well I'm not sure what caused it but just good following good practices.
2011-01-24T18:48:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	I also suggest reformatting, there could be an error or curruption on another part of the disk. And if
2011-01-24T18:49:00.000Z	rusty149	blumaa	And if you can use ntfs as that is better.
