2007-08-02T06:48:00.000Z	Romnous		what's your problem then?
2007-08-02T06:49:00.000Z	Romnous		then you selected the wrong partition?
2007-08-02T06:50:00.000Z	Romnous		i was finally able to setup ubuntu, with samba, and make it use roaming profiles so everyone can login from all over the network. Now i want to setup a mail-server. Preferably Kolab or Zimbra, since i heard good stuff about them.. is it possible to have both samba and the mailserver running at the same time?? and does anyone know which one to use??

2007-08-02T06:53:00.000Z	Romnous		!mailserver
2007-08-02T06:53:00.000Z	Geek_	Romnous	you can definately run samba and  a mail server at once... which i have no idea tho ;)
2007-08-02T06:54:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	ok thx, i need to see which one is better, and have a guide for installing it on feisty or something :/
2007-08-02T06:55:00.000Z	Geek_	Romnous	see if apt has packages, and look up the programmes on docs?
2007-08-02T06:55:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	did that already, it only gives a badly explained explanation for installing kolab on 6.10
2007-08-02T06:56:00.000Z	Geek_	Romnous	installation: use apt is its there. config is the hard part ;)
2007-08-02T06:56:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	hehe :P i knew that already
2007-08-02T06:57:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	thanks for the info anyway
2007-08-02T06:58:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	lol yeah, i got that one already, i'm not such a big noob :P
2007-08-02T06:58:00.000Z	Geek_	Romnous	and, smb and  e mail generally use well defined ports, which are standard so...
2007-08-02T06:59:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	yah ok, but i was wondering if my samba-backend might conflict with the mailserver
2007-08-02T07:03:00.000Z	Geek_	Romnous	looks interesting but if i sing, local wildlife runs away ;p
2007-08-02T07:03:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	heh, i'm going to install it on my PC, it rocks! i luv media/video/gfx editing ^.^
2007-08-02T07:05:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	hehe ok :P
2007-08-02T07:05:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	i need to setup this computer as a server/gateway at home, and then i can get to formatting my computer and installing linux and stuff
2007-08-02T07:11:00.000Z	Romnous	Geek_	i'm going to try to install kolab, wish me good luck lol:P
