2007-03-27T12:55:00.000Z	kandala		Hello guys, I am trying to setup a cron job (for the first time in my life), but nothing seems to happen......This is my crontab entry   21      12      *       *       *       /home/raghavan/ngodost/script/run.sh > /home/raghavan/out. Nothing gets written into the out file....and all I am doing is echoing some text. please help me in debugging things with this
2007-03-27T12:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	21 12 * * * sh /home/raghavan/ngodost/script/run.sh > /home/raghavan/out
2007-03-27T13:02:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	No luck :-( ! I tried doing a cd to the directory of the script and then execute the shell file....but nothing got written into the out file.
2007-03-27T13:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Can you apste the command you are using?
2007-03-27T13:04:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	31 12 * * * (cd /home/raghavan/ngodost/script; ./run.sh > /home/raghavan/out)
2007-03-27T13:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Try: 31 12 * * * cd /home/raghavan/ngodost/script && ./run.sh > /home/raghavan/out
2007-03-27T13:06:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	ok
2007-03-27T13:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Are you sure the script itself is written correctly?
2007-03-27T13:09:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	It has nothing but an echo statement and works properly when I run from the shell. After making the changes suggested by you just now, but no luck.....
2007-03-27T13:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Is the script executable?
2007-03-27T13:11:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	-rwxr-xr-x 1 raghavan raghavan 64 2007-03-27 11:05 run.sh (permissions of the script file)
2007-03-27T13:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Ah, ok. Then I have no idea why it isn't working. You are saving the cronjob, right?
2007-03-27T13:12:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	I have added the entry using crontab -e command and when I do crontab -l, the command is in the crontab file. Do you think I am missing anything?
2007-03-27T13:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	No, that's correct.
2007-03-27T13:13:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	How do I redirect the errors that cron job spits out into some file?
2007-03-27T13:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Does 'ps aux | grep cron' give you more than one line of return?
2007-03-27T13:14:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	No....
2007-03-27T13:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	You only get a line that ends in grep crond ?
2007-03-27T13:15:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	yeah.....only the grep process gets listed
2007-03-27T13:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Sounds like cron isn't even running
2007-03-27T13:17:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	But when I boot my system I can see lot of cron process running......I have no knowledge about the behaviour of cron except that it can execute schedule jobs in background. So, what's my next step then?
2007-03-27T13:26:00.000Z	kandala	ardchoille	Thanks... I got it working after I started the cron scheduler
2007-03-27T13:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	kandala	Ah, thought so.
