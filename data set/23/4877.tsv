2009-05-14T14:24:00.000Z	adi_		thanks
2009-05-14T14:25:00.000Z	adi_		what i need is command given from tty...to first mount the usb flash and from within usb run the script.
2009-05-14T14:26:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	that is the minimal install,
2009-05-14T14:26:00.000Z	adi_	koshari	| yes i know but now im gonna install x and gdm
2009-05-14T14:27:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	can you use apt?
2009-05-14T14:28:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	work out what packages you want, then sudo apt-get install package
2009-05-14T14:30:00.000Z	adi_	koshari	| first i need a full desktop environment like gnome for doing audio and video apps normally like ff youtube skype pidgin and totem
2009-05-14T14:30:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-05-14T14:32:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	use ubuntu-desktop, it will install x and gnome as it depends on them, ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage
2009-05-14T14:33:00.000Z	adi_	koshari	| but this is the point
2009-05-14T14:33:00.000Z	adi_	koshari	| i dont want those apps
2009-05-14T14:33:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	what apps do you want?
2009-05-14T14:34:00.000Z	adi_	koshari	| i just want a minimal clean gnome with no apps in it
2009-05-14T14:35:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	sudo apt-get install gnome,
2009-05-14T14:46:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	that script asnt anything complecated, just install the packages it calls,
2009-05-14T14:47:00.000Z	adi_	koshari	| so from tty i can install all those things it recalls and i will have a X window with gdm and just some apps?
2009-05-14T14:48:00.000Z	adi_	koshari	| than i can add apps i need?
2009-05-14T14:48:00.000Z	koshari	adi_	you will have the environment the author describes in his post.
