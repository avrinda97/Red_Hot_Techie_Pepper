2011-12-10T22:03:00.000Z	super789		i'm having porblems instaling ubunto 10.10 from the cd in a p3 500mhz
2011-12-10T22:04:00.000Z	super789		i get to the menu to pick the language, and after chosing install option i just get a black screen
2011-12-10T22:06:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	how long did you wait?
2011-12-10T22:06:00.000Z	super789	pfifo	5 minutes
2011-12-10T22:07:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	it will likely take hours to load, try the alternate installer
2011-12-10T22:09:00.000Z	super789	pfifo	thanks. but i don't have any linux skills the instalation will also be user friendlly?
2011-12-10T22:10:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	its not that hard
2011-12-10T22:18:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	not good at all
2011-12-10T22:22:00.000Z	super789	pfifo	just to confirm pc3200 512MB ddr doesnt fit in the pentium 3 board?
2011-12-10T22:23:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	a p3 500mhz isnt going to run ubuntu desktop very well
2011-12-10T22:24:00.000Z	super789	pfifo	i discovered that a few minutos ago when reading the system requirements, do you recomend another distro?
2011-12-10T22:24:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	ubuntu-server
2011-12-10T22:26:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	well anything graphical isnt going to be very good, no server dosent have a graphical enviroment
2011-12-10T22:26:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	i guess your stuck with ubuntu-desktop, you wont get any beter performance from a different distro
2011-12-10T22:28:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	it would make a good machine to run a remote desktop from
2011-12-11T03:10:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	can you give a bit more detail
2011-12-11T03:12:00.000Z	super789	pfifo	while loading up ubuntu in recoverymode>regular startup, i receive a post with severel services, and the inictl event says failed
2011-12-11T03:12:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	is it causing a problem for you?
2011-12-11T03:13:00.000Z	super789	pfifo	i dont know, but it apears to be working
2011-12-11T03:14:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	you can ignore it, initctl is a relic from the old sysvinit
2011-12-11T03:16:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	the root account is disabled in ubuntu
2011-12-11T03:18:00.000Z	pfifo	super789	no, use sudo instead
2011-12-11T03:30:00.000Z	super789	pfifo	i had the ubuntu running in the p3 500. shut down the computer, started it and i doesnt do nothing after pickup linux normal startup or recovery mode.. just a black screen...
