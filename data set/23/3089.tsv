2009-12-26T13:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	access to much of your hardware
2009-12-26T13:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	like your hard disks
2009-12-26T13:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	yes
2009-12-26T13:56:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	but you won't have access to some things like actual hard disks, wifi cards, (in some VM programs) USB, and (in some VMs) hardware graphics accelerations
2009-12-26T13:56:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	you can't use that either
2009-12-26T13:56:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	you can have internet access
2009-12-26T13:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	but you have to configure the VM software to handle that
2009-12-26T13:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	##windows is the best irc channel for asking about microsoft products
2009-12-26T13:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	there are also other virtualization programs, like virtualbox and vmware
2009-12-26T13:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	I haven't tried virtual pc or vmware, but virtualbox has a lot of features (at least when it is running with linux as the host.  I've never used it on windows so it might be different in windows)
2009-12-26T14:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	if you know how to configure your virtual machine software, you can still do most of what you can do on a real install
2009-12-26T14:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	the ubuntu cd's installer supports setting up dual boot
2009-12-26T14:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	also, you can do a real installation of ubuntu inside of windows using wubi, but I haven't tried it and I don't think I would recommend it
2009-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	512 MB of ram is definitely enough
2009-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	you might be able to get by with less
2009-12-26T14:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards
2009-12-26T14:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	probably, but you might want more if you need a lot of space for personal files and installed packages
2009-12-26T14:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	tbh = to be honest
2009-12-26T14:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	7.04 isn't supported anymore.  8.04 is newer and is a long term support release
2009-12-26T14:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	you should be able to manually configure it using iwconfig and ifconfig
2009-12-26T14:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	dapper is 6.06
2009-12-26T14:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	CarpeNoctum	9.10 is karmic (or karmic koala)
