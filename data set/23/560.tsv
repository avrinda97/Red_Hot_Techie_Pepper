2012-05-21T02:40:00.000Z	ejo		Is there a way to open an additional instance of a GUI program (in this case, my database administration tool)?  Normally clicking on it in the launcher opens a maximum of one instance.
2012-05-21T02:40:00.000Z	ejo		Would it be specific to each program?  I'm working with pgadmin3 for postgresql on ubuntu 12.04.
2012-05-21T02:40:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	try middle-clicking
2012-05-21T02:41:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	thank you!  I don't have a middle button configured on my mouse
2012-05-21T02:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	try clicking the left and right at the same time, it should emulate a middle mouse click
2012-05-21T02:49:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	Thanks again -- no result from the "both buttons click".  Maybe I should pursue the mouse click emulation first?  Is it the default of the 12.04 launcher to open additional application instances on middle-click?
2012-05-21T02:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	it should be. there may also be a right-click menu option to open another instance (I don't have my 12.04 machine in front of me)
2012-05-21T02:54:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	If the launcher's right-click menu for this particular app doesn't contain any option for opening an additional instance, is that then just something the app itself doesn't offer?  If that's likely then maybe I won't overly trouble myself over this.
2012-05-21T02:54:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	which application?
2012-05-21T02:55:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	pgadmin3 -- it's the GUI admin client for postgreSQL.
2012-05-21T02:55:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	naturally I asked in #postgresql but they're not too big on the GUI client ;)
2012-05-21T02:55:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	hmm, never used it. try it with firefox, if you get firefox to do it but not your tool, then it may be the tool
2012-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	yes, Firefox offers an "open a new window" option -- that's one of the data points that made me think that offering that option or not is on a per-application basis in Ubuntu
2012-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	then it could very well be an application limitation. try contacting the developer of the GUI
2012-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	and of course the default Terminal application does as well, that was my other hint
2012-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	yes, thanks again.  That's it for now!
2012-05-21T02:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	no problem
2012-05-21T03:05:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	I overlooked the obvious! ahaha.  /usr/bin/pgadmin3 launches an additional instance without complaint or error.
2012-05-21T03:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	well, there you go then :)
2012-05-21T03:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	actually, if running the command again works, then turning on middle-mouse-button-emulation will probably work!
2012-05-21T03:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ejo	I think the "second window" and "second terminal" items in firefox & terminal are ADDED by the applications.
2012-05-21T03:12:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	I see, thanks
2012-05-22T05:31:00.000Z	ejo	DarwinSurvivor	yesterday, when I thought CCSM and other tweak tools were failing to adjust my Launcher opacity... it was just that the launcher was black over black background, and Unity's launcher has a certain minimum opacity (i.e. maximum transparency) limit that interacted with that to make it appear as if no change was made.
