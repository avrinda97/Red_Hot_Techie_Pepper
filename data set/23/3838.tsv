2008-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	iceman		my keyboard layout is correct in CLI ttys and in my GNOME session. However, it isn't correct in GDM. How do I change it WITHOUT creating a xorg.conf file?
2008-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	you have an xorg.conf file
2008-10-08T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	you need to set kb layout in xorgconf to the correct country
2008-10-08T15:53:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	I don't have a xorg.conf anymore, I don't want to restore it because my DVI screen won't work if I do
2008-10-08T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	why didnt you simply rename instead of delete?
2008-10-08T15:54:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	actually, that's what I did...
2008-10-08T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	then rename back
2008-10-08T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	you can always comment out lines
2008-10-08T15:55:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	then I'll be back where I started, without my DVI screen.
2008-10-08T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	you may have to go there first to get to the goal
2008-10-08T15:57:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	I don't know what you mean. Situation was : correct kb layout in GDM and NO detection of DVI screen. After renaming of the xorg.conf, I got WRONG layout in GDM (correct everywhere else) and external DVI screen detected (yeah!)
2008-10-08T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	ok then with the display all good, set your keyboard language in xorg.conf
2008-10-08T15:58:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	to do that, I'll have to restore it, which would again break my external display...
2008-10-08T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	if you dont restore it you wont have any settings for your x server and one will be made
2008-10-08T16:01:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	I don't understand what you mean. My screens work better without a xorg.conf (which is now obsolete, as xorg is supposed to autoconfigure). If I restore it my external screen won't work.
2008-10-08T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	your system needs an xorg.conf
2008-10-08T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	it sets up the mouse, keyboard and display
2008-10-08T16:03:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	I'm currently operating my computer without a xorg.conf file... I moved it then rebooted my laptop.
2008-10-08T16:04:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	Xorg 7.2 doesn't need an xorg.conf file
2008-10-08T16:04:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	for most configs, anyway
2008-10-08T16:05:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	nope, hardy
2008-10-08T16:05:00.000Z	iceman	ActionParsnip	ow, don't be so pessimistic
2008-10-08T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iceman	i dont like auto anything
