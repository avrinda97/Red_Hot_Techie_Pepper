2005-12-15T10:27:00.000Z	fredl_		hello everybody, I just installed Ubuntu 5.10. I seem to have a small problem, my graphics card is not correctly detected. Would anybody mind helping me troubleshoot this and have some patience as I'm on a text console now :)
2005-12-15T10:27:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	Which graphics card?
2005-12-15T10:28:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	OK, so its a really new ATI card - I don't think it matters if it is a real one
2005-12-15T10:29:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	I think so yeah, although the X700 has been around a while. I had it running before when I ran Debian unstable, with the ATI proprietary driver on xfree...
2005-12-15T10:29:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	Yeh your going to need to get the proprietary driver again
2005-12-15T10:30:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	does that exist for xorg?
2005-12-15T10:30:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	There is a wicky entry here for it - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI?highlight=%28ati%29
2005-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	is there on ubuntu a text web browser?
2005-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	is it possible to enable the mouse in textmode on Ubuntu?
2005-12-15T10:32:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	Don't know - you could try installing the 'gpm' package -   if you have a freshly installed breezy can you do me a favour and run   dpkg -l initramfs-tools     and tell me what it says ?
2005-12-15T10:33:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	Thanks
2005-12-15T10:39:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	tried doing an apt-get install gpm ?
2005-12-15T10:39:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	that doesn't work
2005-12-15T10:39:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	says package gpm is not available
2005-12-15T10:40:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	OK, if you were in X I'd tell you to use the GUI to select universe and multiverse but since you aren't   edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and lookm for a line that says  deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ breezy main       and make it    deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ breezy main universe restricted multiverse
2005-12-15T10:40:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	Except yours probably doesn't say gb, your probably on a different mirror
2005-12-15T10:42:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	Then do an apt-get update  to get the list of packages in universe and multiverse
2005-12-15T10:44:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	alright that works.. thanks
2005-12-15T10:44:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	No prob
2005-12-15T11:02:00.000Z	fredl_	penguin42	can you give me that wiki URL about the graphics card one more time please now that I can cut and paste with my mouse? :)
2005-12-15T11:02:00.000Z	penguin42	fredl_	OK, just a sec
