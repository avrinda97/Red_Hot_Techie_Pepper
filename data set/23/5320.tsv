2007-07-10T12:11:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	I do!
2007-07-10T12:13:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	could you explain me a bit about xawtv....i dont understand...is this xawtv could be use to transmit video to another source?
2007-07-10T12:14:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	mmm... As far as I know it only allows you to watch TV and save clips and pictures, it is not a complete application like MythTV.
2007-07-10T12:16:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	how you scan the channels? i only been able to see myself on the screen from my cam and i tought i cam use it to transfer the display to perhaps flash player which i am been having trouble displaying my video...i have ov51x and using ov19
2007-07-10T12:19:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	well it has a few options, but I'm not sure it can do what you want. Read "man xawtv" you need to get a menu, and then use the tool "scantv" to create a file which contains the channels which you put in /home/user/.xawtv
2007-07-10T12:20:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	thanks ...let me see the help menu
2007-07-10T12:21:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	xawtv uses the Motif interface with xaw (Athena widgets)  an essentially identical application is "motv" which has GTK1 interface.
2007-07-10T12:22:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	so i have to download xaw?
2007-07-10T12:23:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	what?  "sudo aptitude install xawtv" and you have everything
2007-07-10T12:24:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	i guess i have everyting installed then
2007-07-10T12:25:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	but you said i have to have something else?
2007-07-10T12:26:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	no, I was just saying you need to use the "scantv" tool, to scan and save the channels in a file "man scantv"
2007-07-10T12:26:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	sorry thanks..lol let me check
2007-07-10T12:28:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	I only use xawtv because I cannot use other programs; for some reason my card doesn't work. So you should try with other tv applications first.
2007-07-10T12:29:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	i like xawtv
2007-07-10T12:30:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	ugly!
2007-07-10T12:31:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	lol
2007-07-10T12:31:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	just like me lol
2007-07-10T12:33:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	I recommend you to launch xawtv from the terminal, that way you can see warnings and error messages printed to the console. Do it like "xawtv &"
2007-07-10T12:35:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	changing the subject...do you know if there is a patch to have a video display on flash player from a camera using ov51x (ov19)?
2007-07-10T12:38:00.000Z	vox754	dimas__	no, I know little about cameras, no help with that.
2007-07-10T12:39:00.000Z	dimas__	vox754	thanks anyways...later...take care...thks
