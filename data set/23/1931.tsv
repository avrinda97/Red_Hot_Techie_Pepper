2009-09-06T13:19:00.000Z	phux		Does anyone have any knowledge of video streaming ?
2009-09-06T13:19:00.000Z	LogicFan	phux	be more specific please
2009-09-06T13:20:00.000Z	phux	LogicFan	Yea, I want to rss download tvshows to my server and stream em to my laptop 5km away
2009-09-06T13:21:00.000Z	LogicFan		well, there are many ways to do that.  "stream" means what exactly?  you could network both machines together and play the file off a shared drive
2009-09-06T13:21:00.000Z	LogicFan		if you have the bandwidth
2009-09-06T13:21:00.000Z	phux		The server got the bandwich
2009-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	phux		100/100, but the client just got a dsl on 10 or smth
2009-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	phux		Its totally enough but I want to use some kind of webinterface
2009-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	LogicFan		i mean the bandwidth between the server and laptop
2009-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	phux		where I can control the avi's
2009-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	LogicFan		well, you don't need a web interface
2009-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	phux		I know :P I can just stream it with a ftp but I want too ^
2009-09-06T13:22:00.000Z	LogicFan		if you have a shared drive, you just play the file from that drive on the local machine
2009-09-06T13:23:00.000Z	LogicFan	phux	you can't stream via ftp
2009-09-06T13:23:00.000Z	LogicFan		ftp is for file transfers
2009-09-06T13:23:00.000Z	phux		Yea, files transfer.
2009-09-06T13:24:00.000Z	phux		a avi is a file and I can just transfer it while watching it
2009-09-06T13:24:00.000Z	LogicFan	phux	or you could just play it off the shared drive it is stored on
2009-09-06T13:25:00.000Z	phux		How do I share the drive in a proper way ?
2009-09-06T13:25:00.000Z	LogicFan	phux	what OS are both machines running?
2009-09-06T13:26:00.000Z	phux		Its a freebsd server and a arch client
2009-09-06T13:28:00.000Z	LogicFan	phux	you could just use NFS, but i am not that familiar with FreeBSD or Arch and their packages, sorry.
2009-09-06T13:29:00.000Z	phux	LogicFan	thx anyway :)
