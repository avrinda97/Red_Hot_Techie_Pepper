2008-07-20T09:55:00.000Z	kmyst		anybody got a few minutes for some advice on some backup issue type questions?
2008-07-20T09:56:00.000Z	kmyst		i.e. backup the entire drive but it's encrypted
2008-07-20T09:56:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	do you want the backups encrypted too?
2008-07-20T09:57:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	most definitely...what'd be the point backing up data and leaving it unencrypted? :)
2008-07-20T09:58:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	somehow i figure doing a dd if=/dev/sda of=drive.img type of command won't get me what i want since the drive is encrypted
2008-07-20T09:59:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	well, it would work -- but the resulting file wouldn't be encrypted (i should think so)
2008-07-20T10:00:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	ya...thus my "problem"
2008-07-20T10:01:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	you could do something like .  dd id=/dev/sda | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in - -out encrypted.enc
2008-07-20T10:02:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	that could work...the thought i was wondering is that if i boot off a live cd and dd the drive in that manner would the resulting image be useful since the drive wasn't opened with luks?
2008-07-20T10:04:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	well, im not sure, i would presume that it wouldn't make sense
2008-07-20T10:06:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	yeah i'm not sure either...i was leaning towards opening the drive with luks and thus gaining access then backing up the data...a 1:1 copy a la cpio would be nice since a ton of data is video which doesn't lend well to compression unlike the rest of the filesystem
2008-07-20T10:07:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	well, if you can mount your luks volume like that, then sure .. anything works
2008-07-20T10:08:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	a tarball that got encrypted would be ideal but a ton of wasted processing cycles would take place trying to compress multimedia files (which is ~90% of the drive)
2008-07-20T10:09:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	you don't need to compress the tarball
2008-07-20T10:09:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	or rather, you don't have to..
2008-07-20T10:09:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	this is true...old sysadmin habit :)
2008-07-20T10:24:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	looks like i came up with a workable solution: duplicity will allow me to hobble together enough of what i need to accomplish
2008-07-20T10:25:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	is that duplicity - a name of an app or do you mean a mirrored volume?
2008-07-20T10:25:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	name of an app
2008-07-20T10:25:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	ahh, cool
2008-07-20T10:26:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	straight up command line driven, highly configurable...roll your own type of solution :)
2008-07-20T10:26:00.000Z	unop	kmyst	will keep that at the back of my brain if i ever find out rsync to be incapable :)
2008-07-20T10:28:00.000Z	kmyst	unop	ya i'd rsync but it wouldn't work well for my scenario
