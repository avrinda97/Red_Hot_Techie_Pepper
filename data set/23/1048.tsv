2010-09-26T19:34:00.000Z	obunto		I am having a problem with onBoard onscreen keyboard. When I click a letter, it types in roughly 5-10 of them instead of one. This can only be prevented if I very carefully stop and take my hand off the touchpad for a full 2 seconds before and after clicking on the letter, but this slows down typing considerably :( as you can probably imagine. Can anyone help me with this?

2010-09-26T19:36:00.000Z	obunto	juk	no, I rewrote the question in my last message. I have to take my hand off the touch pad for 2 seconds before and 2 seconds after for the letter to go through without typing additional letters.
