2008-05-17T22:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Jake_	that factoid is notoriously unhelpful, but that wiki page helps

2008-05-17T22:53:00.000Z	Jake_		It Says unknown user Owner\
2008-05-17T22:54:00.000Z	Jake_		so do i type in passwd Owner sorry   or do i type in passwd <username> or do i type in passwd <Owner> sorry
2008-05-17T22:55:00.000Z	Jake_	ikonia	the user that uid is 1000

2008-05-17T22:56:00.000Z	Jake_	ikonia	 i dont know the root admin or any admin usernames or passwords

2008-05-17T22:57:00.000Z	Jake_		he took so long to pay me that i forgot what i set it to
2008-05-17T22:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Jake_	the 1000 user should be the user, if thats deleted, is there a 1001 user?
2008-05-17T22:58:00.000Z	Jake_		Flannel nope
2008-05-17T22:58:00.000Z	Jake_		Flannel Owner is the 1000 user
