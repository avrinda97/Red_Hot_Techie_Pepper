2010-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	leonardo		Hi, I use debian squeeze. Is it possible to migrate to ubuntu changing the respository address
2010-03-19T23:17:00.000Z	leonardo		Can I add ubuntu respository on debian and change the system to ubuntu
2010-03-19T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	leonardo	debian isn't supported here, try #debian
2010-03-19T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Leonardo: you could but you'd get a huge mess possibly
2010-03-19T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Leonardo: I strongly advise a clean install with an md5 verified, cd verified ubuntu cd
2010-03-19T23:19:00.000Z	leonardo	ActionParsnip	But I would like to keep my programs and the config
2010-03-19T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Igoryonya: if you run; lsusb ,you can websearch for the 8 character hex id which will find more guides rather than constraining yourself to the laptop model
2010-03-19T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Leonardo: back the configs up. There is no garuntee they will work in ubuntu
2010-03-19T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Anon__; your OS isn't supported her
2010-03-19T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		E
2010-03-19T23:22:00.000Z	leonardo	ActionParsnip	what are the ubuntu respository address
2010-03-19T23:22:00.000Z	leonardo		any page I can see

2010-03-19T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Leonardo: packages.ubuntu.com
2010-03-19T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Leonardo: each source server is a repo and they all rsync between each other. There isn't one ubuntu server. The update speed woould be painful
2010-03-19T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Weirdaar: sudo lshw -C display
2010-03-19T23:24:00.000Z	leonardo	ActionParsnip	I would like the address to be added on synaptic. I'll try to change from debian to ubuntu changing the repository adrress
2010-03-19T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Leonardo: I don't want any part of a fix if it can really really screw your system up
