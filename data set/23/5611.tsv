2006-10-26T12:03:00.000Z	ehird		(by the way, if there was one thing that would make me use ubuntu's terminal over winxp's cmd, it would be CTRL+Z)
2006-10-26T12:04:00.000Z	ehird		is it safe to install something via apt-get while a package manager is downloading something, and would it appear in the pckage manager? Basically do all package managers use the same database
2006-10-26T12:05:00.000Z	ehird		but if i close the package manager and do the apt-get would opening the package manager show it as installed and let me do the regular stuff with it?
2006-10-26T12:06:00.000Z	ehird		i guess it will then?
2006-10-26T12:07:00.000Z	ehird		guess i'll try myself :)

2006-10-26T12:57:00.000Z	dabaR	ehird	I wish people would not send messages like that to the channel so that the text would scroll slower and everyone could find what they are looking for in the channel
