2009-08-09T05:26:00.000Z	MrWizard		is there a way to use nautilus to browse a network share (sftp or smb) without actually mounting the share?
2009-08-09T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 the fusesmb tool at one time sort of 'browsed'  the network shares  without mounting them (it sort of special mounted them)  Theres also the cli tools
2009-08-09T05:28:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	ok, thx... will there still be a desktop icon for them?
2009-08-09T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 No.
2009-08-09T05:28:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	ok, great :)
2009-08-09T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 things get mounted to dirctories in the system tree.. you said you dident want to 'mount' things...
2009-08-09T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 so what exactly are you trying to do?
2009-08-09T05:29:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	I have a lot of network shares, that I use very often
2009-08-09T05:29:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	I have hotkeys for them too
2009-08-09T05:29:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	but I don't want icons for them on my desktop
2009-08-09T05:30:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	and I haven't really figured out the best way to avoid that
2009-08-09T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 theres settings to tell GNOME to not show  mounted devices on the desktop.
2009-08-09T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 thats the 'best way' :)
2009-08-09T05:30:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	but I would still like it to show mounted usb
2009-08-09T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 i use the 'ubuntu tweak' to tweak that stuff..
2009-08-09T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 you could alwyas just have a icon pointing to the /media/ directory
2009-08-09T05:31:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	hmm... I guess I could - but still: it is nice for an icon to just pop up every time I plug in a device
2009-08-09T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 i hate that feature. :) i perfer it to not pop up some lame dialog :)
2009-08-09T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 just because it dont show the icon..it may still show that popup.
2009-08-09T05:32:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	well... I hate the popup too, but I love the icon :P
2009-08-09T05:33:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	but thanks for the advice :)
2009-08-09T05:37:00.000Z	MrWizard	Dr_Willis	the popup can actually be disabled with gconf too :)
2009-08-09T05:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MrWizard	 thats what ubuntu tweak does.. its a nicer front end then that.
