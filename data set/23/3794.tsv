2010-05-24T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ubuntunewbie: sudo swappon /dev/sda2 ,is one example. Your partition name may be different and the partition will need to be in swapfs
2010-05-24T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ngomes: sudo -i ,it's lowercase
2010-05-24T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ubuntunewbie: if you run: sudo fdisk -l ,is the partition marked as swap?
2010-05-24T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ngomes: linux is hugely case sensitive
2010-05-24T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ubuntunewbie: can't argue with that :)
2010-05-24T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ubuntunewbie: ok if you run: mount ,is it in use?
2010-05-24T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ubuntunewbie: there will be a few lines in the mount output though
2010-05-24T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Sebsebseb: yeah like it taking 2 hours to burn a dvd. It burns then just sits seemingly doing nothing and you can watch an entire film before it decides its bored and spits out the disk
2010-05-24T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Michelle_: sudo apt-get install acidrip
2010-05-24T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Webpragmatist: join and see
2010-05-24T23:30:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	did…
2010-05-26T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webPragmatist	thats exactly how I do mine
2010-05-26T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webPragmatist	well, depending on ram. my next rig is gonna have 4gb so i'm dropping swap
2010-05-26T20:47:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	really hrmm i have 8gb and have read you should half your junk in swap… but i'm sure that depends on what you are doing
2010-05-26T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webPragmatist	chat and browsing mainly. if you want suspend then you will need an 8Gb swap
2010-05-26T20:48:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	well for servers though…. i just figure it's better safe than sorry to have a swap
2010-05-26T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webPragmatist	oh if its a server then more is good
2010-05-26T20:49:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	 well… according to REHL you half it :\
2010-05-26T20:59:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	 so, uhmmm
2010-05-26T20:59:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	do you grow your drbd someho
2010-05-26T21:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webPragmatist	i have no idea what tat is so i'll say no
2010-05-26T21:00:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	well logical partitions can "grow" based on their contents i guess
2010-05-26T21:00:00.000Z	webPragmatist	ActionParsnip	i don't really either
