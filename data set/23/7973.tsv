2005-03-08T15:27:00.000Z	Slave		hi guys, is anyone having trouble accessing 'http://www.ubuntulinux.org/' right now?  For some reason I can't reach it (timeout on dns lookup)
2005-03-08T15:28:00.000Z	Nermal	Slave	fine here
2005-03-08T15:28:00.000Z	Slave	Nermal	 odd... it's the only site I don't seem to be able to access at the moment.
2005-03-08T15:28:00.000Z	Nermal		hum
2005-03-08T15:29:00.000Z	Nermal		peter@snoopy ~ $ host www.ubuntulinux.org
2005-03-08T15:29:00.000Z	Nermal		www.ubuntulinux.org has address 82.211.81.130
2005-03-08T15:29:00.000Z	Slave	Nermal	the ip address came straight up to canonical's website, so it's definitely just something weird at my end
2005-03-08T15:29:00.000Z	Nermal		mmm.. goat...
2005-03-08T15:30:00.000Z	Nermal	Slave	nameserver 62.241.162.200
2005-03-08T15:30:00.000Z	Nermal		is my first nameserver
2005-03-08T15:30:00.000Z	Nermal		not sure if you can use it outside my isp mind :|
2005-03-08T15:30:00.000Z	Slave		hmmm
2005-03-08T15:31:00.000Z	Slave		most nameservers work no matter what ISP you're on... they're not as strict as (for example) smtp
2005-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	Slave	Nermal	could be my gentoo installation just doesn't want me talking to the ubuntu site ;-)
2005-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	Nermal	Slave	I'm on gentoo here :P
2005-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	Slave	Nermal	lol... obviously your installation is more open minded
2005-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	Nermal		asking for help in ubuntu is a lot easier in than when using gentoo though
2005-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	Slave	Nermal	really? why's that?
2005-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	Nermal		Slave:gentoo has a lot of hostility towards it
2005-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	Nermal		for example: go into #gaim and say "my gaim appears to segfault. I'm using gentoo.. any ideas?"
2005-03-08T15:34:00.000Z	Slave	Nermal	do you mean that the gentoo channel is unfriendly?
2005-03-08T15:35:00.000Z	Nermal		most developers are
2005-03-08T15:35:00.000Z	Slave	Nermal	hmmm, it's been ages and ages since I've been in there.. but at the time it was pretty friendly
