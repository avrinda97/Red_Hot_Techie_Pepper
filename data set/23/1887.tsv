2010-04-23T12:10:00.000Z	vak		!ext4
2010-04-23T12:10:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Why?
2010-04-23T12:11:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	i tried to format my additional partition as ext4 and can't find the entry in format options...
2010-04-23T12:11:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	I used the GUI menu
2010-04-23T12:11:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Hm. Could you try "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1" (or similar, that is sda1 being the proper device)
2010-04-23T12:23:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	so what, not important
2010-04-23T12:24:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Which version of e2fsprogs you have?
2010-04-23T12:26:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	e2fsck only
2010-04-23T12:27:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	HUH? You need e2fsprogs to format to ext2/3/4
2010-04-23T12:28:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	oh, i see, you mean the *package* not the executable. actually, e2fsprogs is already the newest version
2010-04-23T12:28:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Ah :D Then... then dunno o_O
2010-04-23T12:30:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Here is a nice table showing what needs what: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2012912/.parttable.png
2010-04-23T12:32:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	1. really nice. ==> 2. I do have e2fsprogs 1.41.9
2010-04-23T12:33:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Tell "really nice" to GParted developers :D But as for that problem, I dunno anything anymore
2010-04-23T12:51:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	strings_: red2kic: thanks guys, CLI-approach went OK. The only question, are there any specific arguments that one could use in mkfs.ext4 for the big number of small files in directory?
2010-04-23T12:51:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Try... "for f in 'ls /your/directory' do mkfs.ext4 $f"
2010-04-23T12:52:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	i consider this as a joke :)
2010-04-23T12:52:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Was supposed to be serious, however I'm unsure what you meant.
2010-04-23T12:53:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	Oh, OK. My partition will be used to store directories, where each directory tends to have a very big number of small files.
2010-04-23T12:53:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	appox 200 000 files per dir
2010-04-23T12:54:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	Ah! Meh. That should not matter.
2010-04-23T12:54:00.000Z	vak	theadmin	so, I guess there could be some arguments to tune?..
2010-04-23T12:54:00.000Z	theadmin	vak	"man mkfs"
