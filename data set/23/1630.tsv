2009-12-26T04:20:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25		sorry, im not from the US but i think yes
2009-12-26T04:20:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	Are you in uk? What is the make and network of the USB?
2009-12-26T04:21:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25		mobile broadband is like a USB dongle that you attach to the laptop/computer and connects you to the internet via 3G or 3.5G
2009-12-26T04:21:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25		when i use it with windows, it automatically installs itself
2009-12-26T04:23:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	but you're not using windows. what is the make and model of the usb dongle?
2009-12-26T04:23:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25	dremits_	I'm using windows now since I can't have the internet work with ubuntu
2009-12-26T04:24:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	What is the make nd model of your usb dongle?
2009-12-26T04:25:00.000Z	dremits_		Hey does anyone know an easy way to have <username>: in chatzila?
2009-12-26T04:26:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25	dremits_	Lemme check.. It says Tattoo Mobile Broadband from Globe Telecom made by Hwawei
2009-12-26T04:27:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	give me a minute
2009-12-26T04:28:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	is youre system up to date?
2009-12-26T04:28:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25		yes, it is
2009-12-26T04:28:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25		i think my problem is really "how to install .exe files in ubuntu"
2009-12-26T04:28:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	Install the linux-backports-modules-generic package and gnome-phone-manager
2009-12-26T04:28:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	Install those packages
2009-12-26T04:29:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25		because the device is mounted and i can browse through files
2009-12-26T04:29:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25		how do i actually get to install the packages (sorry its my first time to use ubuntu)
2009-12-26T04:29:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	You can't install .exe files per se
2009-12-26T04:30:00.000Z	HomeBoy_25	dremits_	or shall i say, run .exe files
2009-12-26T04:31:00.000Z	dremits_	HomeBoy_25	If you wanna do it graphically go to System > Admin > Synaptic Package manager. then search for those packages, double click on the right ones to mark it and then click apply
