2008-05-14T04:32:00.000Z	hollerith		phixxor:that looks okay but I'd have to check the man pages
2008-05-14T04:33:00.000Z	hollerith		phixxor:I must admit I started using rdiff-backup because I set up rsyncs and they didn't lways run
2008-05-14T04:35:00.000Z	hollerith		worked a treat the first time...
2008-05-14T04:37:00.000Z	hollerith		phixxor:just saying careful not switch, rsync is great if you can grok it
2008-05-14T04:39:00.000Z	hollerith		manzon:sounds like failsafe mode - try ctrl-alt-break to get back to the login manager
