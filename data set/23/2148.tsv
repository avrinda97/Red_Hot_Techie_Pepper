2009-08-14T20:59:00.000Z	jigs		Hello!
2009-08-14T20:59:00.000Z	jigs		After setting "pppoeconf" I lost Network Manager in the taskbar. Also local area connection (auto eth0) wasn't working. So I reinstalled network manager using "sudo apt-get remove network-manager" and "sudo apt-get install network-manager". Network Manager now appear in the taskbar by unfortunately my "Auto eth0" connection is lost, and for unknown reasons I can't set-up a new one.
2009-08-14T20:59:00.000Z	jigs		Could somebody possibly help me?
2009-08-14T20:59:00.000Z	jigs		Thanks in advance.

2009-08-14T21:00:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	you can edit the /etc/network/interfaces file  by using a text editor. here's an example of mine: http://pastebin.com/f68405db2
2009-08-14T21:01:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	 you'll haev to use sudo as that file is owned by root.
2009-08-14T21:01:00.000Z	jigs	mazda01	just sec, I will upload it
2009-08-14T21:01:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	example if you're using gnome. gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces
2009-08-14T21:03:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	i dont' use network manager, i just set mine up manually. so I really can't help as i am unaware what the manual entry is for. maybe change that to dhcp?
2009-08-14T21:03:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	so it would be: iface eth0 inet dhcp
2009-08-14T21:04:00.000Z	jigs	mazda01	I wasn't using it at all, but it was convinient because I could easilly connect to my ADSL connection
2009-08-14T21:05:00.000Z	jigs	mazda01	I will remove network manager now
2009-08-14T21:08:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	so you want to use eth0 or not? i don't understand. it appears like you're using dialup
2009-08-14T21:09:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	it is connected to your ethernet port?
2009-08-14T21:09:00.000Z	jigs	mazda01	yes
2009-08-14T21:09:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	then you do need eth0. set it to dhcp then.
2009-08-14T21:10:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	unless you do want a static ip, then set it like mine but leave out the dns servers unless you use opendns
2009-08-14T21:10:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-08-14T21:12:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	no problem. jigs. just pay it forward
2009-08-14T21:14:00.000Z	mazda01	jigs	go for it. i told you the basics. it's either static or dhcp. if static you need to tell it the ip and the dhcp server, your internal ip of whatever is handing out ips
