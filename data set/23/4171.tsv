2007-10-20T09:19:00.000Z	asbani		wow the apt-get just asked me to insert my gutsy gribbon cd then press enter. is that right?
2007-10-20T09:21:00.000Z	asbani		I think it asks me for gutsy CD because I have to upgrade my sources.list or something?
2007-10-20T09:22:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	how did you go?
2007-10-20T09:04:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	give us a sec mate!
2007-10-20T09:04:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	Okay
2007-10-20T09:06:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	have a look at IntuitiveNipple's post above: <quote> Try removing the directory "/home/org/.cpan/build/DBI-1.59" and then running install again, so that 'make' can run correctly </quote>
2007-10-20T09:07:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	try removing the folder again then quit cpan shell and start again
2007-10-20T09:08:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	last few lines again from new shell/cpan http://pastebin.com/m2226801
2007-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	do you have build essential installed?
2007-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	not sure about that. whats build essential?
2007-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	build essential is the gcc compiler package for ubuntu. do apt-get install build-essential
2007-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	righty
2007-10-20T09:16:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	then see how you go
2007-10-20T09:16:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	I just got a fresh gutsy install :)
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	whats also important things to install such as build-essentail for a new system? :)
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	From experience in 7.04 Ubuntu does not install build essential as standard
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	Perl may have C/C++ modules in the code
2007-10-20T09:18:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	oh ok
2007-10-20T09:19:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	open a terminal and type sudo apt-get-install build-essential
2007-10-20T09:20:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	I did. it asked me for gutsy CD
2007-10-20T09:20:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	why does it ask me for CD when I try to apt-get every now and then. It's weird. never happened to me in fiesty
2007-10-20T09:30:00.000Z	asbani	mechdave	now I got DBI installed perfectly thanks mate
2007-10-20T09:30:00.000Z	mechdave	asbani	Fantastic, good to hear
