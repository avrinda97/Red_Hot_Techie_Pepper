2005-12-23T12:54:00.000Z	toya__		i have the classic windows-linux problem, how's the compatiblity of linux writing on ntfs, i read linux can't write at all on ntfs, but my friend said there's a project for it
2005-12-23T12:54:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	yes, that's right, but it's not recommended to write in ntfs
2005-12-23T12:55:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	it's not safe at all
2005-12-23T12:56:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	no, what's not safe is to write in ntfs since it might fuck your data up
2005-12-23T12:56:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	yes, there is not problem with fat32
2005-12-23T12:57:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	and from Win you can also read ext partitions but cannot write
2005-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	toya__	NanoBCN28	 i c, but i think i only see c: in my computer
2005-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	toya__	NanoBCN28	is there any special settings i have to do?
2005-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	sorry? didn't understand
2005-12-23T12:59:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	what do you want to do?
2005-12-23T12:59:00.000Z	toya__	NanoBCN28	i mean only c appears in my computer (windows' "my computer")
2005-12-23T12:59:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	you want to mount Windows partitions from Ubuntu?
2005-12-23T13:00:00.000Z	toya__	NanoBCN28	and be able to read ext in windows
2005-12-23T13:01:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	to read ext from Windows there is an application
2005-12-23T13:01:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	let me look for it
2005-12-23T13:01:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/ext2ifs.htm
2005-12-23T13:02:00.000Z	toya__	NanoBCN28	thx
2005-12-23T13:02:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	you're welcome
2005-12-23T13:06:00.000Z	toya__	NanoBCN28	how do i access my ntfs partition from linux, i remembered in mandrake it was in mnt/hda1 but there's nothing in the mnt
2005-12-23T13:07:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	same thing we're explaining to Mike_ , the only difference is ntfs instead of vfat
2005-12-23T13:07:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	 it's 3 steps: 1) create folder you want the partition to be mounted (ex. /media/Win) 2) Output the fdisk -l to see which is the partition 3) edit /etc/fstab to automatically mount it at boot
2005-12-23T13:08:00.000Z	toya__	NanoBCN28	not sure how those work, but i'll get help from my friend later, thx a lot.
2005-12-23T13:08:00.000Z	NanoBCN28	toya__	no problem, read the ubuntuguide.org for some info
