2008-08-08T00:21:00.000Z	kaiwen		hmm.. hopefully someone can help me, I connected the laptop and PC with a crossover cable, I want the PC to receive internet through the laptop's wireless. So far dhcp between the laptop and PC has been doing swell, the ping is good. But when I start firestarter with internet sharing available the PC is still unable to connect to the internet. I tried the command line way, still no luck, is...
2008-08-08T00:21:00.000Z	kaiwen		...it prob. because of the configuration?
2008-08-08T00:22:00.000Z	kaiwen		chip search grub
2008-08-08T00:22:00.000Z	kaiwen		chimp*
2008-08-08T00:22:00.000Z	kaiwen		ahh but i tried that though ;)
2008-08-08T00:23:00.000Z	chimp	kaiwen	jum, neither i think
2008-08-08T00:23:00.000Z	kaiwen		chimp grub is what manages operating systems when you startup your computer
2008-08-08T00:23:00.000Z	chimp		Ive used it before and forgotten its name,
2008-08-08T00:23:00.000Z	kaiwen		chimp you can do it by command line easily
2008-08-08T00:23:00.000Z	chimp	kaiwen	It adds to grub an option for installing another OS
2008-08-08T00:24:00.000Z	kaiwen	chimp	again you can do it by command line, all it does is edit a text file.
2008-08-08T00:24:00.000Z	kaiwen		menu.lst to be exact
2008-08-08T00:24:00.000Z	kaiwen		chimp if you really need to, go to synaptic and search grub, you may find it there
2008-08-08T00:25:00.000Z	chimp		You can direct grub to load an iso on boot?
2008-08-08T00:25:00.000Z	kaiwen		chimp to load a cd? for what reason.
2008-08-08T00:25:00.000Z	chimp		I want to install another os, have no cd drive, no usb, etc.
2008-08-08T00:26:00.000Z	kaiwen		chimp oh gosh, that just makes things harder ;), especialy when you said no usb
2008-08-08T00:26:00.000Z	chimp		I know it can be done within the os, ive done it before, cant remeber name of the program, and googling wont help
2008-08-08T00:26:00.000Z	kaiwen	chimp	i'm not sure abou that. let me do a quick google

2008-08-08T00:27:00.000Z	kaiwen	chimp	didn't take that long , now did it;)
2008-08-08T00:27:00.000Z	kaiwen		but chimp, careful though, you need to know which device it's on (root)
2008-08-08T00:27:00.000Z	chimp	kaiwen	This laptop is very slow,  (which is why i want to install a less resource intensive os)
