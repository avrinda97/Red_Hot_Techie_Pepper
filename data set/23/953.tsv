2010-11-20T10:23:00.000Z	humanMeat		hwo can i tell if my remote ubuntu server is accepting anything on port 1194
2010-11-20T10:24:00.000Z	greezmunkey	humanMeat	can you ss into it?
2010-11-20T10:24:00.000Z	greezmunkey		ssh
2010-11-20T10:24:00.000Z	humanMeat		hrm
2010-11-20T10:25:00.000Z	humanMeat	greezmunkey	i tried to ssh into xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:1194 but it's not doing anything
2010-11-20T10:25:00.000Z	humanMeat		does ssh work with all ports greezmunkey?
2010-11-20T10:25:00.000Z	humanMeat		i thought it's just 22 23
2010-11-20T10:26:00.000Z	humanMeat		i configured my client to connect on 22
2010-11-20T10:26:00.000Z	humanMeat		and the server seems to accept on 22
2010-11-20T10:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	humanMeat	ssh into your server, if it is set up for that, and then check which ports it is listening on.
2010-11-20T10:27:00.000Z	humanMeat	greezmunkey	i see this: tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1194            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
2010-11-20T10:27:00.000Z	humanMeat		what does that mean..
2010-11-20T10:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey		human it means it is listening...on that port number.
2010-11-20T10:28:00.000Z	humanMeat		my remote server is listening on that port number?
2010-11-20T10:28:00.000Z	humanMeat		how would I confirm this greezmunkey
2010-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	humanMeat		apparently the output looks like it's giving me lip service
2010-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	humanMeat		like from a remote place.
2010-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	humanMeat		i'm in windows
2010-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	humanMeat	It looks like you are running OpenVPN on it, is that right?
2010-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	humanMeat		yes..
2010-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	humanMeat		the server is running.  i can't seem to get my client to connect it keeps timing out or something
2010-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	humanMeat		i made some windows firewall exceptions
2010-11-20T10:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	humanMeat	stop and restart the openvpn service, then try connecting to it again.
