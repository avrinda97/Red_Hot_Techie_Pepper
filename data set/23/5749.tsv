2012-01-11T02:38:00.000Z	w30		the best way to get rid of Unity is to install gnome-pane, gnome-shell, install ccsm,edit ccsm and uncheck unity set up cube, rotate cube ,export the resulting profile to a file then make and switch to a new profile using that exported file; poof Unity gone
2012-01-11T02:39:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	I was told in compiz channel, compiz was hacked to work with unity, wont that break something ?
2012-01-11T02:39:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	yes it breaks Unity.
2012-01-13T04:58:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	what worked for me was to open ccsm and uncheck unity and unity grab handles wall; check cube rotate cube and other window functions like move resize etc. and then export that file as a profile to home-something. Make a new ccsm profile and import that file as your new profile and choose to use that new profile.
2012-01-13T04:59:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	the moment I uncheck unity everything freezes
2012-01-13T05:01:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	yeah, make sure you have all your window functions and window decorator stuff checked to take up the void unity leaves behind.
2012-01-13T05:02:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	what would I have to enable to have just plain regular compiz is that a window decorator with emerald?
2012-01-13T05:02:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	otherwise you loose the abilit to change window focus with mouse and keyboard
2012-01-13T05:03:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	I got one box running emerald and one with gtk-window-decorator
2012-01-13T05:04:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	how do you make sure another wm takes over when unity is unchecked?
2012-01-13T05:05:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	with gtk-window-decorator I have to put in my gtk window decoration by putting a line in the window decorator section of ccsm
2012-01-13T05:06:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	does gtk window decorator have anything to do with gnome 3 ?
2012-01-13T05:06:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	also any tutorials I can follow to do all this
2012-01-13T05:08:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	not that I know of; all the good knowledgeable help in here swear by Unity so they pretend to  say it can't be done.
2012-01-13T05:08:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	that sucks :(
2012-01-13T05:09:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	it's been making a swooshing sound for two years now. Ha
2012-01-13T05:10:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	I am booting kubuntu and xubuntu trying to decide between the two, I still hav Ubuntu on a laptop.
2012-01-13T05:12:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	/usr/bin/gtk-window-decorator --metacity-theme CopperDeck --replace
2012-01-13T05:12:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	(CopperDeck is the name of a metacity or gtk theme; substitute whatever feels good) (and you have it installed)
2012-01-13T05:14:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	I put that in ccsm for window decorator? then uncheck unity ?
2012-01-13T05:16:00.000Z	w30	FluxD	you better get your window management checked before unchecking Unity like extra, maximumize, move, resize, scale, place,
2012-01-13T05:16:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	I so hope you can document your setup on a blog or something for the unfortunates like me :)
2012-01-13T05:22:00.000Z	FluxD	w30	what would you suggest I do to get a pure compiz session working and with the unity app bar on top and a window list panel of some sort
