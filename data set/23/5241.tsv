2007-01-12T12:07:00.000Z	_caid_		Hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu on my amd64 system but things keep freezing up during early stages of the install. If I do thing from a terminal, I tend to get messages like "SQUASHFS error: sb_bread failed reading block". Is my ISO broke or something worse?
2007-01-12T12:08:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	there are md5 sums and a verify function you can use to answer that question
2007-01-12T12:08:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	What I meant was, could by burned CD be broken (I think the ISO is fine)
2007-01-12T12:09:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	do you have a tool to compute the md5 sum for the burned cd?
2007-01-12T12:09:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	Well, I could make an ISO from the CD and md5sum it, but that ould take a bit of time so I'd rather know if this was the likely problem.
2007-01-12T12:10:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	if it boots it is less likely to be broken but maybe.  and CDs can be summed by a decent tool
2007-01-12T12:11:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	Ok, so what other sources for this error could there be?
2007-01-12T12:13:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	i do not know - i do not have a 64b system to test.  just guessing, disk problems?  memory?  it might be good to know exactly where in the process it fails.  but i am not sure i will be the best answerer
2007-01-12T12:15:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	does the live cd work ok for a long time?  i know this is frustrating.
2007-01-12T12:15:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	hardware problems seem unlikely since i used the computer for winxp on a daily basis, but I put a new sata drive in it today on which i want to install ubuntu
2007-01-12T12:15:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	it freezes up after a little while
2007-01-12T12:16:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	right now i've managed to boot it and start the installer
2007-01-12T12:17:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	agreed on hardware problems except you just put in a new drive and linux stresses hardware in different ways. very often marginal memory will fail with linux that works with win osses
2007-01-12T12:17:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	didn't know that, I'll run a memcheck right away
2007-01-12T12:18:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	not 100% guaranteed but this is wtf mode - hard to troubleshoot, i know
2007-01-12T12:21:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	ok, bios memtest said ok. last try froze at partitioning... my new sata drive is looking mighty suspicious, but i can't figure out why i'd get squashfs errors from that
2007-01-12T12:22:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	i think you are on to something - may be a driver issue or somesuch - i don't have sata drives but it is worth your asking your questions to the group with the assumption that you may have a sata problem
2007-01-12T12:23:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	and remove my name or else nobody else might answer  (thanks rioghal)
2007-01-12T12:23:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	not that i mind seeing my name :)
2007-01-12T12:23:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	kind of new to the ubuntu community so sorry for asking but: what group?
2007-01-12T12:24:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	sorry i meant channel as in this channel
2007-01-12T12:24:00.000Z	_caid_	mnoir	ok, thanks... i'll fiddle with the installer a bit more before i ask
2007-01-12T12:25:00.000Z	mnoir	_caid_	:)
