2006-05-27T12:08:00.000Z	nickrud_		!xgl
2006-05-27T12:08:00.000Z	nickrud_		the wiki worked for me, but it needs more for real life
2006-05-27T12:09:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	are you in #ubuntu-xgl?
2006-05-27T12:09:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	not for at least a couple of months
2006-05-27T12:09:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	i'm gonna ask in there for help - i've followed the wiki, but it still ain't working
2006-05-27T12:10:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	most likeley place ;)
2006-05-27T12:11:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	gksudo update-manager -d , that does it all
2006-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	fyi, the error message i'm getting is: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/738732
2006-05-27T12:13:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	any ideas at all?
2006-05-27T12:13:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	have you set your .xinitrc correctly?
2006-05-27T12:13:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	afaik, yeah, i'll pastebin it
2006-05-27T12:14:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	i don't have an .xinitrc.. :/
2006-05-27T12:15:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	any chance i can steal your .xinitrc? ;)
2006-05-27T12:16:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	I wiped my xgl about an hour after starting it, it was not ready for prime time. I work on this machine
2006-05-27T12:17:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	and the instructions have changed radically since I read them, a sec
2006-05-27T12:17:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	ok
2006-05-27T12:19:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	I did the 'nvidia & other cards" section (equivalently) and then jumped down to "other way, console way".
2006-05-27T12:19:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	i did it using the other methon
2006-05-27T12:19:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	very much a testing type of a run
2006-05-27T12:21:00.000Z	welp	nickrud_	i gotta pack up - taking my desktop to my cousin's house, thanks for any help
2006-05-27T12:21:00.000Z	nickrud_	welp	xgl is just pie in the sky, maybe later
