2008-07-30T16:09:00.000Z	EminX		seems I'm just losing my time, nobody is ready to help, right ?
2008-07-30T16:09:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	I could try
2008-07-30T16:09:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	What's the problem
2008-07-30T16:10:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	ï»¿Ubuntu 8.04 disappointed me and many friends of mine, it lost the sound almost every session I start while I'm working on Firefox, not just in my comp. How come that Firefox is installed by default in Ubuntu and has this terrible problem.
2008-07-30T16:11:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	What do you mean by "lost sound"? While you were watching Youtube videos?
2008-07-30T16:11:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	I did updates and tried a lot on forums to find a solution, is so hard and I can't fix it
2008-07-30T16:11:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	not just in Youtube
2008-07-30T16:11:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	But is the problem that it loses sound when you watch Youtube/other videos?
2008-07-30T16:12:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	Yeah, I've had that problem too; you have to save and quit firefox and open it again
2008-07-30T16:12:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	all the time
2008-07-30T16:12:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	It's because something else is using the sound device
2008-07-30T16:13:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	does that mean I can not watch youtube and listen to music in amarok in the same time, that's not fear man
2008-07-30T16:13:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	Yeah, I guess so
2008-07-30T16:13:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	even I can not open more than one tam in Youtube
2008-07-30T16:13:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	You can try opening firefox first and THEN amarok
2008-07-30T16:14:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	what if i open 2 or more tabs on Firefox or opera or whatever
2008-07-30T16:14:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	the same problem
2008-07-30T16:14:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	I'm not sure but it'll be fixed when Flash 10 comes out
2008-07-30T16:14:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	isn't it yet
2008-07-30T16:15:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	is the flash 10 out now or not
2008-07-30T16:15:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	No
2008-07-30T16:18:00.000Z	EminX	SidStudios	So we have to wait, shame on ubuntu, I don't want but I have to switch to Windows, in this way we never gonna promote the Ubuntu, I installed it in all the computers here in my faculty and you can imagine the reactions of students all of them have seen this problem and I don't know what to say more just switch the windows xp
2008-07-30T16:18:00.000Z	SidStudios	EminX	Yeah, that was a bad idea..
