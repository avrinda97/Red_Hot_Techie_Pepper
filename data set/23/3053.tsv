2009-06-02T01:06:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	do you know how to do it ?
2009-06-02T01:08:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	your description is (for me) a bit hazy, what is your configuration and what are you trying to accomplish?
2009-06-02T01:12:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	slestak, mdm,   computerA is on internal wifi that has no outside internet,  computerB eth1 on internal wifi,  computerB eth0 is on internet.  I want computerA to be able to get internet through computerB.
2009-06-02T01:14:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	what OS runs on B?
2009-06-02T01:14:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	all are ubuntu
2009-06-02T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	so you want to share the internet connection from Computer A via wifi with B?
2009-06-02T01:16:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	I can't explain it any better than I just did
2009-06-02T01:16:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	I asked a yes/no question
2009-06-02T01:17:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	no.  reread what I said
2009-06-02T01:17:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	computerA is on internal wifi that has no outside internet,  computerB eth1 on internal wifi,  computerB eth0 is on internet.  I want computerA to be able to get internet through computerB.
2009-06-02T01:19:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	I mixed it up: so you want to share the internet connection from Computer B via wifi with A?
2009-06-02T01:19:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	yeah I guess so
2009-06-02T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	did you have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetConnectionSharing ?
2009-12-22T01:06:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	system/administartion/time ...
2010-08-25T00:14:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	try powertop
2010-08-25T00:18:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	so powertop is telling me what the cpu is waking up for but not amps or volts or watts of power
2010-08-25T00:18:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	in fact it says  no ACPI power usage estimate available
2010-08-25T00:19:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	it does if you pull the AC plug and run on battery
2010-08-25T00:26:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	it's not a desktop....
2010-08-25T00:26:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	i mean uhh   not a laptop.
2010-08-25T00:27:00.000Z	hwilde	guntbert	no ACPI power usage estimate available
2010-08-25T00:28:00.000Z	guntbert	hwilde	then I don't know - sorry - as far as I know the kernel modules all are observing the battery current
