2012-03-22T01:14:00.000Z	c_smith		has anyone seen my problem?
2012-03-22T01:16:00.000Z	c_smith		not just spam, but advertising......
2012-03-22T01:17:00.000Z	c_smith		methinks need_card might have been a bot.
2012-03-22T01:19:00.000Z	c_smith		is there something that 3 perfectly good (checked for errors on memtest86, and none found) 1GB RAM sticks could do to cause constant kernel crashes and panics?
2012-03-22T01:19:00.000Z	c_smith		mind you, this is an old desktop that uses PC-3200 RAM that I am talking about.
2012-03-22T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	c_smith	how long did you run memtest on them? ALL tests?
2012-03-22T01:20:00.000Z	c_smith		not sure, but I ran each individually, then ran them all 3 at once.
2012-03-22T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	c_smith	in my experience errors show often in the tests #6 - #8 only
2012-03-22T01:22:00.000Z	c_smith		well, I ran the default tests.
2012-03-22T01:23:00.000Z	c_smith		and the default, if I remember correctly, included everything.
2012-03-22T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	c_smith	yes, did you run it for at least on complete set? or did you interrupt ?
2012-03-22T01:25:00.000Z	c_smith	guntbert	I ran it for the whole time for each individual one, and then all 3 at once.
2012-03-22T01:26:00.000Z	guntbert	c_smith	I was asking because there is no "whole time" - it only stops when interrupted by you
2012-03-22T01:27:00.000Z	c_smith		I stopped it after it had run all the tests once.
2012-03-22T01:32:00.000Z	c_smith		so, I let memtest run all 9 tests each time, and no errors were found.
2012-03-22T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	c_smith	in  that case I have no helpful idea, sorry
2012-03-22T01:35:00.000Z	c_smith		ok
2012-03-22T01:35:00.000Z	c_smith		so, in this case, this might be a bug, correct?
2012-03-22T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert		!who | c_smith for the future
2012-03-22T01:37:00.000Z	c_smith	guntbert	duly noted.
2012-03-22T01:38:00.000Z	c_smith		well, I'm going to count the desktop as a loss until I can get it overhauled, then i'll test again.
2012-03-22T01:39:00.000Z	c_smith	guntbert	thanks for at least trying, but as I said to pretty much nobody in general, I'm going to let the desktop sit until I get the money to overhaul it.
2012-03-22T01:39:00.000Z	guntbert	c_smith	Good luck :-)
