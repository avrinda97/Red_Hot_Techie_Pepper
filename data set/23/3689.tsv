2009-09-20T09:37:00.000Z	echosystm		is there any way to allow ubuntu to run a program as root without typing in a password?
2009-09-20T09:37:00.000Z	echosystm		i want to be able to turn off/on my wireless without putting in a password
2009-09-20T09:37:00.000Z	echosystm		cheers
2009-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	echosystm		so you can do this for one program only?
2009-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	echosystm		obviously i dont want to do it for everything
2009-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> what you mean by that, you can turn off the interface if thats what you mean
2009-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	echosystm		i dont maen through network manager
2009-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	echosystm		i mean through iwconfig
2009-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> you can turn it of via ifdown
2009-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	echosystm		nono, i mean ACTUALLY turn it off
2009-09-20T09:40:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> whats the difference?
2009-09-20T09:40:00.000Z	echosystm		saves battery if you turn it off properly
2009-09-20T09:40:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> then you can unload the driver
2009-09-20T09:40:00.000Z	echosystm		but not all wifi cars allow it
2009-09-20T09:40:00.000Z	n8tuser		!who | echosystm
2009-09-20T09:41:00.000Z	echosystm	n8tuser	iwconfig ethX power off < this actually turns the chipset off entirely
2009-09-20T09:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> okay, you already knew the command, so why not do it?
2009-09-20T09:42:00.000Z	echosystm		it needs to be run as root and i was just wasking how i can do this without putting in a password
2009-09-20T09:42:00.000Z	echosystm		i already have the answer (see above)
2009-09-20T09:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> networking is a system resource that require a root access, so you need a root priviledge to turn it on/off
2009-09-20T09:43:00.000Z	echosystm	n8tuser	unless you modify sudo... which you can and i am doing right now ;)
2009-09-20T09:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> yes you can put the user as member of networking group
2009-09-20T09:44:00.000Z	n8tuser	echosystm	-> and you can put command specific to a user in sudoers file
