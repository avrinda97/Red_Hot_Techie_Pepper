2005-09-25T09:40:00.000Z	Ankka		nor does it even find my router or adsl modem
2005-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	Ankka		and when I try to connect to the net with it, it kills the router somehow so I need to restart it to connect with other machines either
2005-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	how did you try to configure it?
2005-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	well, I haven't gotten very far
2005-09-25T09:42:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	Did you use command pppoeconf to configure adsl?
2005-09-25T09:42:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	no, I don't think I did
2005-09-25T09:44:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	should that be done with or without the router in between?
2005-09-25T09:45:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	Is router same as adsl modem?
2005-09-25T09:45:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	no, it isn't
2005-09-25T09:45:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	the adsl modem connects to the internet, and the router then divides that to more than one machine
2005-09-25T09:46:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	What i know is once you connect adsl modem to ethernet jack, pppoeconf is all you need.
2005-09-25T09:46:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	well, at least now it didn't get anything done
2005-09-25T09:47:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	"Access concentrator of your provider did not respond"
2005-10-23T06:52:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	Hoe did you try to find it?
2005-10-23T06:53:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	there's a little icon there that complains about problems, and when I start synaptic, it tells me there is one broken package on my system
2005-10-23T06:53:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	and yet, when I try to find it with the "broken" filter, it doesn't find any
2005-10-23T06:54:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	after opening synaptic, click the Status button (lower left set of cuttons), and see if it shows any category Broken.
2005-10-23T06:56:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	 I don't think it gives any, nor does it when I try Custom > Broken
2005-10-23T06:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	Try once reloading package list by pressing Reload button. See if still says you have a broken package.
2005-10-23T06:58:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	it tells me one package is broken, still. How do I find the broken one?
2005-10-23T06:58:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ankka	I don't know why it isn't showing broken package if it knows there is one.
2005-10-23T06:59:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	looks like I had my preferences wrong. problem found
2005-10-23T06:59:00.000Z	Ankka	onkarshinde	thanks for the patience :)
