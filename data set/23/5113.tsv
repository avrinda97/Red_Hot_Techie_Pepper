2008-02-08T17:23:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	thx
2008-03-11T19:26:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	thx
2008-09-23T02:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	use gparted fdformat is only for disquettes
2008-09-23T02:21:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	ok so is it dont even possible to format a usb memory from the terminal?
2008-09-23T02:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	yes you can use "sudo mkfs -t fat /dev/sdxx"
2008-09-23T02:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	where /dev/sdxx should appear on dmesg when you plug the flash in
2008-09-23T02:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	or you can check once is mounted with the mount command
2008-09-23T02:23:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	ok, thx, will try this
2008-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	if you need to do recovery tasks. use recovery mode
2008-10-04T15:27:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	I don't need to do recovery stuff
2008-10-04T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	if you only want to disasble X windows "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2008-10-04T15:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	if you want that to be permanent (every boot with no X) "sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove"
2008-10-04T15:29:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	ok, thx, will try it. I was wondering since ubuntu 8.04 which I'm running, don't have a /etc/inittab where you otherwise could change runlevel
2008-10-04T15:29:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	ah, thx!!
2008-10-04T15:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	no it has not. it uses upstart not Sytem V init
2008-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	ah, I see
2008-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	but anyway on debian/ubuntu all runlevels are equal (except 0-1-6 of course)
2008-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	it is not like in RH/fedora or other distros
2008-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	okay, but why have different runlevels if they are equal then?
2008-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	mEck0	well somebody may want to teawk the runlevels and make them different.. they are no different by default but you can configure them
2008-10-04T15:32:00.000Z	mEck0	erUSUL	then I understand, thx for the info
