2008-02-03T06:28:00.000Z	Tann		My keyboard is having issues. It won't work in KDE, but it will work in GNOME. ans this problem only started a few minutest ago
2008-02-03T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	check your keyboard connector
2008-02-03T06:29:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	The keyboard works in GNOME though
2008-02-03T06:29:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	It is definately no the keyboard
2008-02-03T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	 consider that your connector may have moved or that the cable may be damages
2008-02-03T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	I don't have a clue then
2008-02-03T06:30:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	I have tried and retried several times
2008-02-03T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	usb ?
2008-02-03T06:30:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	PS/2
2008-02-03T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	did you try to change the keyboard settings in kde ? you might have accicentaly removed it or someting
2008-02-03T06:31:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	no. It was working one minute, and then i went to get something and when I came back it didn't work
2008-02-03T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	 I assume you tried to reboot ?
2008-02-03T06:32:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	yes, several times
2008-02-03T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	does it work in recovery mode ?
2008-02-03T06:33:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	let me see. Just a minute
2008-02-03T06:42:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	recovery mode didn't work
2008-02-03T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	 I'm stumped, are both kubuntu and ubuntu on the same hdd ?  try from ubuntu  sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop maybe it will restore files that might be missing
2008-02-03T06:45:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	I am running kde on ubuntu
2008-02-03T06:45:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	same answer then
2008-03-18T04:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	try reformulating your question
2008-03-18T04:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	do you mean use one computer's internet on another, or use two seperate internet connections on the same comp to speed up your transfers ?
2008-03-18T04:28:00.000Z	Tann	Pelo	I want to use one computer's internet on another
2008-03-18T04:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Tann	ok , I think you need to use firestarter to do that,  but I'm not sure,  you might want to try asking in #networking
