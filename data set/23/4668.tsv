2007-11-15T01:17:00.000Z	lunartear		How do I install debconf? apt-get dies cause debconf isnt installed
2007-11-15T01:18:00.000Z	lunartear		soundray? any ideas
2007-11-15T01:19:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	do you have a deb for debconf in /var/cache/apt/archives/ ?
2007-11-15T01:20:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	yes
2007-11-15T01:20:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	see if you can install it with 'sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/debconf*deb
2007-11-15T01:21:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	Can't locate Debconf/Db.pm in @INC
2007-11-15T01:22:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	how did you get into this situation?
2007-11-15T01:27:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	is there a package i can install that contains the Debconf perl modules?
2007-11-15T01:29:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	they are in the debconf package. You've got a classic catch 22. How did you get into this situation?
2007-11-15T01:30:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	i told you
2007-11-15T01:30:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	i had to reinstall perl manually to get rid of threads
2007-11-15T01:31:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	how is it a catch 22 if the system installs it in a state without debconf in the first place
2007-11-15T01:31:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	debconf is probably in the seed archive
2007-11-15T01:32:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	seed archive?
2007-11-15T01:33:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	I have only rudimentary knowledge, but I think when you install, the first thing that goes onto your disk is a "seed" system that is unpacked from a .tar.gz
2007-11-15T01:33:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	well there's gotta be a way to install it
2007-11-15T01:34:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	anyway, what you should do is read man dpkg to find out how to unpack a package (sorry, I don't know how offhand) and put the components into place with cp
2007-11-15T01:34:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	the components of debconf, I mean
2007-11-15T02:27:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	have you been able to repair your debconf?
2007-11-15T02:27:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	yes using aptitude
2007-11-15T02:27:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	wow - apt-get failed, but aptitude worked?
2007-11-15T02:28:00.000Z	lunartear	soundray	yep
2007-11-15T02:28:00.000Z	soundray	lunartear	that's amazing, well done
