2006-06-10T12:22:00.000Z	JohnsonE		OK guys, i return with more questions!
2006-06-10T12:23:00.000Z	JohnsonE		question 1: apt-get always tells me the package couldn't be found. How do I make it find the package?
2006-06-10T12:24:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	which package for instance?
2006-06-10T12:27:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	you need to enable universe in your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2006-06-10T12:28:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	try "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" and remove the '#' signs from beside the deb words
2006-06-10T12:28:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	then run sudo apt-get update
2006-06-10T12:29:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	yes, that would enable everything
2006-06-10T12:30:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	no problem
2006-06-10T12:32:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	run apt-cache search msttcorefonts
2006-06-10T12:33:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	and see what you get...
2006-06-10T12:34:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	thats all you got?
2006-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	what country are your repos in?
2006-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	i would suggest you go to packages.ubuntu.com and download it from there (you can search) then use 'dpkg -i path/to/download'
2006-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	if you get dependancy errors, then run 'apt-get -f install'
2006-06-10T12:37:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	i've had similar problems where certain specific packages were not available in my repos
2006-06-10T12:42:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	np
2006-06-10T12:43:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	they should be available to firefox
2006-06-10T12:58:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	try "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak"
2006-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	then run sudo aticonfig
2006-06-10T12:59:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	that means it ran with no errors
2006-06-10T13:00:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	did u install ati drivers according to a guide?
2006-06-10T13:04:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	you seem to be missing the fglrx module
2006-06-10T13:04:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JohnsonE	this is about as much as i know about ATi cards
