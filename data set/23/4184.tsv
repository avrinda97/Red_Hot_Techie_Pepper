2009-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	auk		i just installed ubuntu 9.04 amd64 on top of 9.04 amd64 (same version) because i was having technical problems (a whole host of things, the last straw being refusing to boot)
2009-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	auk		now it will boot but when i log in i see first the gnome toolbars briefly, then white
2009-07-21T11:41:00.000Z	auk		a full screen of white, which alllows me to do nothing because i can't see, though there does seem to be one window open, because when i zoom out on the compiz cube i see it's outline
2009-07-21T11:42:00.000Z	auk		and suggestiongs for getting it to work? i think it's a problem of conflicting settings with the fresh installation...
2009-07-21T11:42:00.000Z	auk		*suggestions
2009-07-21T11:42:00.000Z	[R]	auk	why did you reibnstall?
2009-07-21T11:44:00.000Z	auk	[R]	it wouldn't boot: got past the graphic ubutnu boot bar and then froze, flashing twice a strange graphically messed up thing, then staying on a third
2009-07-21T11:44:00.000Z	[R]	auk	did you format the partition when yo ureinstalled?
2009-07-21T11:44:00.000Z	auk	[R]	the root, yes, but not the home
2009-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	[R]	auk	well try making a new user and not reusing your probably broken old home dir
2009-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	auk	[R]	i should also mention i had been using the / previously as ext4
2009-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	[R]	auk	it doent matter what / was as long asy ou formated it
2009-07-21T11:46:00.000Z	auk	[R]	well i think it was never actually formatted as ext4, just i had set it to treat it as ext4, while it was actually ext3... so could that be holding over?
2009-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	[R]	auk	if you are installing, you must select the optino to format the partition
2009-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	auk	[R]	how can i create a new user from the command line?
2009-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	[R]	auk	useradd
2009-07-21T11:48:00.000Z	auk	[R]	ok thanks i'll try that now...
2012-01-23T07:03:00.000Z	[R]	auk	i highly doubt you have a virus
2012-01-23T07:03:00.000Z	auk	[R]	i know it's weird but it doesn't seem to be affecting the router... as the other computers in this lab (hostel) are not getting redirects
2012-01-23T07:04:00.000Z	auk	[R]	wait it could be an extension i recently installed...
2012-01-23T07:05:00.000Z	[R]	auk	lol
2012-01-23T07:05:00.000Z	auk	[R]	as chrome isn't having any probs either
2012-01-23T07:05:00.000Z	auk	[R]	i've developed a rather lax trust level with anything that's on addons.mozilla
