2010-10-11T22:42:00.000Z	zebastianortis		how do i figure out which version of l-ubuntu i have? how do i upgrade it? is it safe/effective to upgrade?
2010-10-11T22:42:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	open terminal: lsb_release -a
2010-10-13T03:37:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	what for?
2010-10-13T03:37:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	for what reason?
2010-10-13T03:37:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	how will it enhance?
2010-10-13T03:38:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	there is no root password, therefore nobody can login with it
2010-10-13T03:39:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	in ubuntu, there is no root password.
2010-10-13T03:39:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	okay, sudo doesn't use a root password, it uses your password
2010-10-13T03:40:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	you can go to system->administration->users & groups and change it there
2010-10-13T03:40:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	you asked for it to be done from the gui.
2010-10-13T03:41:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	sudo passwd  <-- that's all you need
2010-10-13T03:43:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	sudo passwd sebastian
2010-10-13T03:44:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	are you confused yet? I'm sorry, but 'passwd' by itself is all you need. sorry for the bad info above.
2010-10-13T03:45:00.000Z	zebastianortis	Gnea	i already changed the password thanks, now the problem is this, when i am on the gui and click on my root only folder it says access denied, and what i want it to do is prompt and ask for the password
2010-10-13T03:46:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	you'll just have to explain the whole thing, I don't understand 'root folder' you say one thing and mean another
2010-10-13T03:51:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	so that'd be a feature request of pcmanfm then
2010-10-13T03:52:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	you could possibly make a shortcut key-combo to do it
2010-10-13T03:54:00.000Z	zebastianortis	Gnea	ok, problem is i amon lubuntu
2010-10-13T03:54:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	yeah, you'll need to figure out how to do that then
2010-10-13T03:54:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	it's only lxde, shouldn't be too terribly difficult to figure out
2010-10-13T04:16:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	you should say that you're a noob in the first place, next time.
2010-10-13T04:16:00.000Z	zebastianortis	Gnea	will do next time
2010-10-13T04:21:00.000Z	Gnea	zebastianortis	it doesn't work like that.
