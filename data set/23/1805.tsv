2009-11-28T00:25:00.000Z	fool__		does anyone know how to connect from windows to a linux box directly through ethernet cable ?
2009-11-28T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	sure, use a crossover cable and set static IPs
2009-11-28T00:26:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	exctaly how should i do that ?
2009-11-28T00:26:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	it's faster than going through router right ?
2009-11-28T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	negligable
2009-11-28T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	use network manager to set the IPs
2009-11-28T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	the router will make the addressing easier
2009-11-28T00:27:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	oh so not much speed difference ?
2009-11-28T00:28:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	somehow i thought direct connection would be faster
2009-11-28T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	hardly any at all, the router is a dedicated device and will route it fast. you'll get maybe an extra few kbps every minute
2009-11-28T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	you'll be transferring at a decent enough speed so its negligable
2009-11-28T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	if yuo take the drive out and put it in the other system to transfer it will be a lot faster
2009-11-28T00:29:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	it's like 1mBps
2009-11-28T00:29:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	no can do lol
2009-11-28T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	you'd get about 280Mbps
2009-11-28T00:39:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	uhm that's not an option i dont have external enclosure
2009-11-28T00:40:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	both laptops :(
2009-11-28T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	you can opem your PCs and connect the to the controllers inside, doesnt need an enclosure. Sounds like you dont play with hardware much so only do this if you are comfortable with hard drive installs
2009-11-28T00:57:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	erhh i did say this is laptop didn't i lol there's no other places to plug the 2nd hdd
2009-11-28T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fool__	no you didn't, d'oh
2009-11-28T00:59:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	lol yeah that's my problem
2009-11-28T00:59:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	trust me if it's desktop i'd plug it in directly already
2009-11-28T01:00:00.000Z	fool__	ActionParsnip	that's ok i'm sticking to current setup
