2006-08-12T12:47:00.000Z	Dabian		I have to download the windows version of firefox ..
2006-08-12T12:47:00.000Z	Dabian		I hope this doesn't mean I have to run firefox through wine?
2006-08-12T12:48:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	huh?
2006-08-12T12:48:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	Shockwave
2006-08-12T12:48:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	you need to run it in wine then. linux can't run windows programs natively
2006-08-12T12:49:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	windows can't run linux programs either
2006-08-12T12:50:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	I am aware of that.
2006-08-12T12:50:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	I don't know why anyone is using that propriatary crap anyway
2006-08-12T12:51:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	Just .. having to run 32-bit chroot wine firefox ... just to access normal webpages with shockwave. ... thats kinda insane.
2006-08-12T12:51:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	Yeah .. beats me ..
2006-08-12T12:51:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	There is both java and flash .. why shockwave?
2006-08-12T12:51:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	really. I wouldn't put the future of my companys wub page into the hands of adobe
2006-08-12T12:51:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	Its a chatwebsite..
2006-08-12T12:52:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	I wouldn't do that either
2006-08-12T12:52:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	adobe doesn't care about linux
2006-08-12T12:52:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	Its not my webpage .. I am just a user ... I want to meet my friends there.
2006-08-12T12:52:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	yeah
2006-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	I think your options are qemu, wine 32 bit choot, vmware or windows native
2006-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	chroot
2006-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	I am followring this howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Shockwave
2006-08-12T12:55:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	the problem is it doesn't work well in 64bit mode
2006-08-12T12:56:00.000Z	Dabian	mwe	It does not..  No 64bit java or flash (yet).
2006-08-12T12:56:00.000Z	mwe	Dabian	personally I'd run 32bit linux for now if I had 64bit arch
