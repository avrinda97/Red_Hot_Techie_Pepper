2008-02-28T01:50:00.000Z	danand	ph0rensic	- try another disk??
2008-02-28T01:51:00.000Z	ph0rensic	danand	this is the thirs one, the other two did't even read..
2008-02-28T01:51:00.000Z	ph0rensic	danand	wouldnt mount even
2008-02-28T01:51:00.000Z	danand	ph0rensic	- hope that helps!
2008-02-28T01:52:00.000Z	ph0rensic	danand	maybe its the dvdread package ...
2008-02-28T01:52:00.000Z	danand	ph0rensic	- do you have libdvdread3 installed?
2008-02-28T01:53:00.000Z	ph0rensic	danand	I just checked and I dont think so, so i think that is the problem.. where is the repo?
2008-02-28T01:55:00.000Z	danand	ph0rensic	- never used that before - did you get that :)
2008-02-28T01:56:00.000Z	ph0rensic	danand	i see.. i have that repo enabled.. must be the package name is being typed wrong?? I'll figure it out thanks!
2008-02-28T01:56:00.000Z	ph0rensic	danand	oh wait it is installed already
2008-02-28T01:56:00.000Z	danand	ph0rensic	- sudo apt-get install libdvdread3
2008-02-28T01:57:00.000Z	danand	ph0rensic	- crap - hoped that was gonna solve it!
2008-02-28T01:57:00.000Z	ph0rensic	danand	weird first time I did that it it just said couldn't find package, didn't say already installed.. maybe i spelled it wrong..well the issue is something else.. and I believe I have all the codecs a sould could ever want installed
2008-02-28T02:00:00.000Z	danand	ph0rensic	- dvd's are a pain!
