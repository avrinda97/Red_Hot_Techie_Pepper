2008-02-23T18:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	that sounds like a router issue, do you have a router?

2008-02-23T18:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	well, you've got something going on, that makes little sense
2008-02-23T18:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	did you install Firestarter, or some other software firewall?
2008-02-23T18:38:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	but i am able to sgin in gmail and gooogle maps
2008-02-23T18:39:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	NO
2008-02-23T18:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	well, if you're getting to gmail, and googlemaps, then this is clearly a permissions issue.
2008-02-23T18:40:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	ya  i guess then what to do?
2008-02-23T18:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	have you set certain permissions for your users that might have effected that?
2008-02-23T18:41:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	No but i uninstalled gnash flash of firefox
2008-02-23T18:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	that shouldnt' cause that.
2008-02-23T18:41:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	from than the problem started
2008-02-23T18:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	what *I*  would do, is go back to your ubuntu install, and create a new user.. Log out, and log in to the new user, and see if you have the same problem, if you do, then its something in the user settings
2008-02-23T18:53:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	i created new user and still no use
2008-02-23T18:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	ok.. and that user was able to got o gmail also?
2008-02-23T18:53:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	 ya i was able to google and gmail and maps
2008-02-23T18:54:00.000Z	sandy37	IndyGunFreak	 even orkut
2008-02-23T18:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	sandy37	ok there's something w/ your connection, either a firewall, or something.
