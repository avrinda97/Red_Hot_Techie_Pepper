2005-10-21T14:12:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	was meant for slew..soz
2005-10-25T13:01:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	good thinking :)
2005-11-09T12:37:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	hostname?
2005-11-09T12:38:00.000Z	benplaut	mustard5	"hostname newname"?
2005-11-09T12:38:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	I'm think yes, but don't quote me on that :)
2005-11-09T12:39:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	if you cat /etc/hostname you can see the file
2005-11-09T12:39:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	it only has one word in it
2005-11-09T12:40:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	I'm curious whether you could do it in the network gui
2005-11-09T12:43:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	I can see a spot to change it in the network gui to change it, I can only assume it can be edited :)
2005-11-09T12:45:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	your sudo gone wacky?
2005-11-09T12:45:00.000Z	benplaut	mustard5	no idea... nothing, period will open
2005-11-09T12:45:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	recovery mode and put the hostname back to what it was
2005-11-09T12:47:00.000Z	benplaut	mustard5	ctrl+alt+F1 is my friend... everything working again :D
2005-11-09T12:47:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	hehe lucky break ;)
2005-11-09T12:48:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	I've had a few people come through with sudo not working because it cant find the hostname
2005-11-09T12:48:00.000Z	benplaut	mustard5	heh, look at this: This will prevent you from launching new applications, and so you will have to log in again. Continue anyway?
2005-11-09T12:51:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	all good now?
2005-11-09T12:51:00.000Z	mustard5	benplaut	k
