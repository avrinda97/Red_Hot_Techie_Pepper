2010-01-02T23:50:00.000Z	gfather		hello guys
2010-01-02T23:51:00.000Z	gfather		just added an nvidia card to my pc , now i can log into ubuntu , my lcd wont show anything
2010-01-02T23:51:00.000Z	gfather		is there any way to force a compatabile reolution ?
2010-01-02T23:52:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	you have to get to console shutdown gdm and run nvidia-xconfig
2010-01-02T23:52:00.000Z	gfather	darthanubis	how can i do that ?
2010-01-02T23:55:00.000Z	gfather	darthanubis	but how im going to do that from boot ?
2010-01-02T23:55:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	I normally don't do walk through but you will need to take notes
2010-01-02T23:56:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	you have to hit ctrl-alt-f1 to get to console
2010-01-02T23:56:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	no, after full load
2010-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	you with me?
2010-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	yes
2010-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	the key sequence I gave you will get you to a console
2010-01-02T23:58:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	to stop gdm type sudo stop gdm or sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-01-02T23:58:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	then sudo nvidia-xconfig
2010-01-02T23:58:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	that should do it, as gdm should restart itself
2010-01-03T00:00:00.000Z	gfather	darthanubis	thanks allot for the help , will test right now :)
2010-01-03T00:00:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	come back and let me know if it worked out for you:)
2010-01-03T00:23:00.000Z	gfather	darthanubis	no console apeared
2010-01-03T00:23:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	what exactly did happen?
2010-01-03T00:25:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	there is no way for me to confirm or deny that, so i can't help. "Nothing" seems highly improbable, as "something" always happens.
2010-01-03T00:26:00.000Z	gfather	darthanubis	myabe my lcd is not accepting the console resolution
2010-01-03T00:27:00.000Z	darthanubis	gfather	it should be a resolution that is easily displayable by any screen. Try booting a livecd to confirm that theiry?
2010-01-03T00:28:00.000Z	gfather	darthanubis	ok
