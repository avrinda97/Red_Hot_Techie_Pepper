2006-09-26T13:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	lol...you obviously miss the most-of-every-day when i'm *not* here. but i appreciate the compliment
2006-09-26T13:10:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	here is a question for you!
2006-09-26T13:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	shoot!
2006-09-26T13:10:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	Ready!
2006-09-26T13:10:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	when I go into my terminal and do su, it asks for a password
2006-09-26T13:11:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	when I enter anything it says authorization failed
2006-09-26T13:11:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	so what is my password? :P
2006-09-26T13:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	here's the thing:  ubuntu, by default, uses sudo for root access. when using sudo, you use your password. to become root, sudo -i is the command to use
2006-09-26T13:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	i would advise you to use sudo, and use sudo -i to su to root. if you *absolutely need* a root password, you can use sudo passwd root, but that is a LAST RESORT. use it only if your religion forbids sudo -i
2006-09-26T13:14:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	lol
2006-09-26T13:14:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	I Just want to have something set, I don't NEED to use root
2006-09-26T13:14:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	Great, first I can't eat meat, now I can't use a root
2006-09-26T13:14:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	damn the religions
2006-09-26T13:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	ok, then i guess you can do what i just said--however, do keep in mind it's not the "suggested" way of doing things :-)
2006-09-26T13:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	and lol
2006-09-26T13:15:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	thanks hun
2006-09-26T13:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	please don't call me "hon." and you're welcome
2006-09-26T13:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	though if you meant it in the sense of "attila/door the..." then you're fine
2006-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	when did you sneak in?
2006-09-26T15:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	xMorphix	i never logged out, though i did leave--very tricky :-)
2006-09-26T15:30:00.000Z	xMorphix	ladydoor	:P
