2010-01-22T03:31:00.000Z	daftykins	gammax500	ok what's in your /etc/resolv.conf ? should just be something like "nameserver 192.168.1.1" ?
2010-01-22T03:33:00.000Z	gammax500	daftykins	- has 2 nameservers which are 4.2.2.1 and 4..2.2.3

2010-01-22T03:37:00.000Z	daftykins	gammax500	obviously you won't be able to come online so if you can paste from another machine or whatever
2010-01-22T03:42:00.000Z	gammax500	daftykins	- http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m28d39a72
2010-01-22T03:43:00.000Z	daftykins	gammax500	your router is 192.168.1.1 but there you've got 192.168.0.x addressing, either you've got a router with a separate subnet for the wireless so it's 0.x or you're connected to the wrong wireless network?
2010-01-22T03:45:00.000Z	daftykins	gammax500	two entirely different internet connections + respective routers? or is the wireless just an access point plugged into a wired only router?
2010-01-22T03:46:00.000Z	daftykins	gammax500	ok i find it weird you're getting given 192.168.0.x addresses then, because you won't be able to communicate with 1.x addressing unless there's a router between
2010-01-22T03:48:00.000Z	daftykins	gammax500	hit me up in PM, i just gotta go see what the stupid dog is barking about >_<
