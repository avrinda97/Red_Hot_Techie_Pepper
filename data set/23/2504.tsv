2010-04-27T20:13:00.000Z	wildbat		is there a command to rescan for harddisk that just hot-plugged in?
2010-04-27T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	rescan what?
2010-05-07T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	wicd but it's usually a better idea to figure out why nm isn't working
2011-06-16T01:19:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	don't think the chown/chmod can apply to mountpoint
2011-06-16T01:19:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	forget about mountpoint, chown chmod whatever file you want to change the permissions of
2011-06-16T01:26:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	what did you try?  What can't you do?  What *exactly* do you want to do?  (Please answer all 3 questions)
2011-06-16T01:28:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	i am just learning ;p ~ there should be a way to mount other then the default permission and ownership
2011-06-16T01:28:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	if you want to change permissions, mount the partition and then use chmod/chown as desired
2011-06-16T01:31:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	that i know ~ but like if i have a usb drive format to ext4 ~ then it will be mount as root with 644 permission. i can change the folder/file within but not the mountpoint
2011-06-16T01:31:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	why do you care what the permissions of the mount point are?
2011-06-16T01:32:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	cause it is own but root ~ so users can't create file directly under it
2011-06-16T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	use chown/chmod.
2011-06-16T01:33:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	if it's ext4 then that's how you change permissions.
2011-06-16T01:34:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	can't change the mountpoint permission with that ~ it is the /media/usb_drive got root:root 644 premission ~ if a user wanna create a file say /media/usb_drive/file123 it will fail ~
2011-06-16T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	yes. you. can.
2011-06-16T01:35:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	what would you prefer the permissions and ownership to be?
2011-06-16T01:36:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	777 will be good for me ;p or own by the user UID1000
2011-06-16T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	pastebin the output of « mount; getent passwd 1000 »
2011-06-16T01:40:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	strange lastnight i can't chown/chmod with it ~ but okay now ~ xD
2011-06-16T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	:D
2011-08-07T02:39:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	maybe gvfs-open?
2011-08-07T02:48:00.000Z	jrib	wildbat	you could always just parse the file and run the Exec key
2011-08-07T02:51:00.000Z	wildbat	jrib	what you mean?? you mean make a script ? ;)
