2006-06-25T06:02:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY		and yeah, i got about 40 dvds so no big deal
2006-06-25T06:03:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY		im just so sick of nothing working on amd64
2006-06-25T06:04:00.000Z	blakkino	Lord-ChewY	"nothing working"?
2006-06-25T06:05:00.000Z	blakkino		maybe flash.. but i can live without it.. oo is already installed in 32bit mode on ubuntu..
2006-06-25T06:05:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	blakkino	well there is no wine binarys for it, source wont compile cause of a problime with binutils, quake4 needs a 32 bit driver, so does quake3
2006-06-25T06:05:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	blakkino	no flash for firefox64
2006-06-25T06:06:00.000Z	blakkino	Lord-ChewY	if you take a 32bit binary version of wine probably it will work
2006-06-25T06:06:00.000Z	blakkino		i use cedega 32bit and i play lots of games :)
2006-06-25T06:06:00.000Z	blakkino		nvidia drivers work support 32bit too
2006-06-25T06:06:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY		mistaED how is it right now? thats in testing right
2006-06-25T06:07:00.000Z	blakkino	Lord-ChewY	"there is no wine binarys for it" <- but amd64 is binary compatibile with i386 ;)
2006-06-25T06:07:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	blakkino	i tried cedega, didn't mount the cdrom
2006-06-25T06:08:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY	blakkino	put in my guild wars cd and cedega couldn't pick it up
2006-06-25T06:08:00.000Z	Lord-ChewY		there is really little advantage to amd64 anyway
2006-06-25T06:08:00.000Z	blakkino	Lord-ChewY	can't understand. you must mount the cd and start the setup :>
