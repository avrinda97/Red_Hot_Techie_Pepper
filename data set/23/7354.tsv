2005-09-10T10:44:00.000Z	durt		i will brb too
2005-09-10T10:46:00.000Z	oofnik	durt	well everything I add to my panels crashes wnck-applet
2005-09-10T10:47:00.000Z	oofnik	durt	i need some way to reset the gnome panel configuration to default
2005-09-10T10:50:00.000Z	durt		yay - it worked: life is much easier now :)
2005-09-10T10:51:00.000Z	oofnik		hey does anyone know how to reset the gnome panels completely, as in to back how they were when the system was installed
2005-09-10T10:52:00.000Z	durt	oofnik	killall gnome-panel
2005-09-10T10:52:00.000Z	durt	oofnik	nevermind
2005-09-10T10:52:00.000Z	oofnik		no durt that just reloads it, i want to completely reset all settings.. hah
2005-09-10T10:52:00.000Z	oofnik		ahh my panels are royally screwed...
2005-09-10T10:53:00.000Z	durt		you could reinstall gnome-panel maybe, oofnik
2005-09-10T10:53:00.000Z	oofnik		nope durt tried that
2005-09-10T10:53:00.000Z	oofnik	durt	it's a local issue, if i log into gnome as a different user it's okay
2005-09-10T10:55:00.000Z	durt	oofnik	im not sure what config file the panel info is stored it, but try and find it as a user in which the gnome-panel works, then replace the bad one with that or something
2005-09-10T10:56:00.000Z	oofnik	durt	i tried that too.. couldn't find the one that works
2005-09-10T10:57:00.000Z	oofnik		i tried to replace the whole panel folder in ~/gconf/apps/something and it didn't change a thing
2005-09-10T11:00:00.000Z	durt	oofnik	have you tried replaceing everything that has a "g" in its name?
2005-09-10T11:00:00.000Z	durt	oofnik	nevermind - replace ~/.gconf/apps/panel
2005-09-10T11:01:00.000Z	oofnik		yeah durt that's what i did
2005-09-10T11:01:00.000Z	oofnik		didn't change a thing
2005-09-10T11:01:00.000Z	durt	oofnik	wait - what is the problem exactly?
2005-09-10T11:02:00.000Z	oofnik	durt	it's not really a very specific problem, but whenever I add certain applets to my panels, wnck-applet crashes
