2010-08-23T14:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	you can look at the return of this command sudo netstat -pant  and kill the process that you don't want or need.
2010-08-23T14:33:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	if i kill them next boot they still working again
2010-08-23T14:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	find out what package they are and uninstall them or modify boot to not start them
2010-08-23T14:36:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	now i undrstand why debian is the more secure. i made nmap on my Ubuntu default on all ports from a Debian in my lan. after i done the same to Debian default. result no one port open ...
2010-08-23T14:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	only ports I have open are the ones I created except maybe cups,  not sure what you installed or what you have running
2010-08-23T14:37:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	sorry, but i don't accept that a service open ports w/o my permission. this is a very stupid policy from Ubuntu, Canonica or whaever
2010-08-23T14:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	oh maybe your browser has more than one window open and so have some more ports open?
2010-08-23T14:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	what application are these so called ports comming from?
2010-08-23T14:40:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	would yo lke a pastebin?
2010-08-23T14:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	sure pastebin it
2010-08-23T14:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	but I like this format better sudo netstat -pant
2010-08-23T14:44:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	http://pastebin.com/WMS3wyEX
2010-08-23T14:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	for one thing I don't see an appache2 server so why is mysqld running?
2010-08-23T14:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	dnsmasq  you must have installed that not that it's a bad thing
2010-08-23T14:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	sshd  you also installed that
2010-08-23T14:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	most are packages you installed except for cups  so you can install those on debian also not sure I see a difference
2010-08-23T14:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	like icecast what is that?
2010-08-23T14:50:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	these are services, doesn't matter some need locally. but no open ports please. if i do a nmap it is a disaster. I am lucky that my dsl router has a nice firewall. incredible if i had a direct connection with a modem for instance all the word can enter on my Ubuntu. this is *unmissable*
2010-08-23T14:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	so if you need these services localy I guess you want a firewall.
2010-08-23T14:51:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	so, you don want undestand me. even xp if an application try to go in listening mode ask you if it can or not, can you understand me??????? i believed linux was secure ...
2010-08-23T14:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	just because it listens is not a security risk,  but I agree with llutz
2010-08-23T14:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	North_Italian69	the default firewall is to deny all
2010-08-23T14:54:00.000Z	North_Italian69	sacarlson	so, who changed he mine?
