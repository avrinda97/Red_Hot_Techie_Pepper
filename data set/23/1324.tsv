2010-08-03T20:28:00.000Z	PunXtaR		Hey there, anyone knows if my wifi board can inject?, its an realtek and use the rtl8192se driver (i think)
2010-08-03T20:29:00.000Z	PunXtaR		sorry for my english xD
2010-08-03T20:29:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	well most can these days
2010-08-03T20:30:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	they did brake the atros chipset on the new kernels
2010-08-03T20:31:00.000Z	PunXtaR	gogeta	yes, but i did aireplay --test to check it but it said: 0/30 (0%) or something like that
2010-08-03T20:31:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	then its not working
2010-08-03T20:32:00.000Z	PunXtaR	gogeta	yeah i guess
2010-08-03T20:33:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	i think your chipset needs a patched driver
2010-08-03T20:34:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	they do make live cds just for aircrack
2010-08-03T20:34:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	with all the patched drivers
2010-08-03T20:34:00.000Z	PunXtaR	gogeta	i searched but i could not find one
2010-08-03T20:35:00.000Z	PunXtaR	gogeta	a live cd? mmm, backtrack 4 for example?
2010-08-03T20:36:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	thers a few of them
2010-08-03T20:37:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=links#live_distributions
2010-08-03T20:37:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	backtrack being the largest will all patched drivers
2010-08-03T20:38:00.000Z	PunXtaR	gogeta	i see... ok i will try with those live cds, but if they doesn't work i will buy an usb wifi... which one do you recommend me?
2010-08-03T20:39:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	well backtrack is the most widely used its a live dvd
2010-08-03T20:39:00.000Z	PunXtaR	gogeta	someone told me that anyone with chipset atheros will work to inject
2010-08-03T20:39:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	being it supports pretty mutch all wifi cards
2010-08-03T20:39:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	used to but it got broken in the new keernel
2010-08-03T20:39:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	so only backtrack works now
2010-08-03T20:40:00.000Z	PunXtaR	gogeta	isee, thanks gogeta!
2010-08-03T20:40:00.000Z	gogeta	PunXtaR	my old belking g+ pcima stil works
