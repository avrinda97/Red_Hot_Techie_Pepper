2008-03-25T01:37:00.000Z	julian_	orudie	make owner: sudo chown user:group /path/to/home
2008-03-25T01:38:00.000Z	julian_	orudie	sudo adduser username groupname --home /path/to/home
2008-03-25T01:39:00.000Z	orudie	julian_	what about chown ? and i dont really have groups
2008-03-25T01:39:00.000Z	julian_	orudie	most of the time the user testuser is in the group testuser so try sudo chown yourUser:yourUser /path
2008-03-25T01:44:00.000Z	orudie	julian_	orudie@ubuntu:/home$ sudo chown snapzilla:snapzilla /home/snapzilla/
