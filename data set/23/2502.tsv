2009-08-16T15:57:00.000Z	kamil		what does it mean when  after running iwconfig I've got output " wlan0     IEEE 802.11abgn  ESSID:"" " is there a problem with ESSID ?
2009-08-16T15:57:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	no
2009-08-16T16:01:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	I followed one howtoo http://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=879134&page=2
2009-08-16T16:03:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	lshw -C network gives me output that wifi is enabled yet iwconfig gives ESSID="" is that al right ?
2009-08-16T16:04:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	are you connected to any wifi network
2009-08-16T16:04:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	no
2009-08-16T16:05:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	I can't see any through network manager
2009-08-16T16:05:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	when you are connected it will write a ESSID there for you
2009-08-16T16:05:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	you mean like there is awifi network here but you cant see it ?
2009-08-16T16:07:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	it should work as it is on and I can't see any reason to say it will not work if there was a network there
2009-08-16T16:08:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	When I click on the network manager icon with left click it says "no network devices has been found" and "manual configuration"
2009-08-16T16:09:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	no network device mmm
2009-08-16T16:10:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	ifconfig -a  says wlan0 is UP and has HW address
2009-08-16T16:12:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	I'm not right guy for such a test , I will now take a look on my laptop to see if it is the same as you get , what w as your wifi hardware
2009-08-16T16:13:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	manual configuration is probably for setting up your own wifi network right?
2009-08-16T16:14:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	yes, but normally you don't need that
2009-08-16T16:16:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	I think last time I installed this wifi all I needed was click on Network Manager and choose wifi as wlan0 and that was it after I could see at least a few networks
2009-08-16T16:16:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	I have jaunty and it is not like that there is no manual configuration ... sorry , make you question more specific and long maybe the others can help you
2009-08-16T16:16:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	now only thing I can do is Edit wireless networks
2009-08-16T16:16:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	yes it is as you say
2009-08-16T16:17:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	only the problem is that there are none :)
2009-08-16T16:17:00.000Z	TheNano	kamil	du you use ubuntu Networkmanager?
2009-08-16T16:17:00.000Z	kamil	TheNano	yes the one that came up with installation
