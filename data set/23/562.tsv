2011-06-07T02:36:00.000Z	Squeezer		hey?
2011-06-07T02:36:00.000Z	Squeezer		so I have a question
2011-06-07T02:37:00.000Z	Squeezer		why does my laptop die twice faster under Ubuntu?
2011-06-07T02:37:00.000Z	Squeezer		than under Windows
2011-06-07T02:38:00.000Z	Squeezer		ubuntu drains my battery twice faster, though I have no idea how that can possibly happen
2011-06-07T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	sounds like a bug with acpi, manufacturers work close with microsoft so their stuff works. Supporting Windows gives more revenue than supporting other OSes
2011-06-07T02:41:00.000Z	Squeezer	ActionParsnip	what can I do to extend the battery life on my laptop for Linux then? I tried Gentoo as well, and I still get half as much battery life as I do with Windows.
2011-06-07T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	are there any bugs reported?
2011-06-07T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	yes
2011-06-07T02:44:00.000Z	Squeezer	ActionParsnip	there is this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1374912 where someone else complains about battery life on my laptop but it doesn't suggest a solution
2011-06-07T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	i'd log a bug with acpi
2011-06-08T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	can you give the output of:  lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep swf; dpkg -l | grep gnash

2011-06-08T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	cool, not sure then. I don't use firefox
2011-06-08T22:56:00.000Z	Squeezer	ActionParsnip	well it works in firefox. It doesn't work in Chromium
2011-06-08T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	try symlinking the libflashplayer.so to /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins
2011-06-08T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Squeezer	I use the daily build of chromium, I'm well aware of the browser
