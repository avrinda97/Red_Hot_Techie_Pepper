2009-07-14T14:48:00.000Z	gharz		guys, i've a usb flash disk... whenever i execute `ls` i get this error ls: cannot access THEME: Input/Output error... what's the best thing to fix this? is this hardware related now?
2009-07-14T14:49:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	could be hardware, could be a filesystem issue. Is this a fat or fat32 partition, and does it work in a different system or os?
2009-07-14T14:50:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	it's fat16
2009-07-14T14:51:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	try "dosfsck" (umount the partition first!)
2009-07-14T14:51:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	thanks
2009-07-14T14:54:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	if i umount it... how do i dosfsck an unmounted device?
2009-07-14T14:55:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	dosfsck /dev/insertdevicenamehere
2009-07-14T14:57:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	it says Currently, only 1 or 2 FATs are supported, not 6. what does this mean?
2009-07-14T14:58:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	what are you running it on exactly?
2009-07-14T14:58:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	if the card has a partition make sure you run it on that, not on the raw device
2009-07-14T14:58:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	(so run it on /dev/sdg1, not /dev/sdg)
2009-07-14T14:58:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	(replace sdg with your actual card)
2009-07-14T14:58:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	it doesn't have partition...
2009-07-14T14:59:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	that doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't have one large partition. Does /dev/sd<whatever>1 exist?
2009-07-14T15:02:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	 this is the result.... http://paste.ubuntu.com/217757/    ... i'm just wondering why does churvalooh, THEME and other folders doesn't appear on nautilus and cannot be deleted?
2009-07-14T15:03:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	might want to move some stuff out of the root directory into subfolders (assuming it lets you)
2009-07-14T15:04:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	I don't know how unhappy nautilus gets if the root directory is full if it tries to use a trash can there.
2009-07-14T15:04:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	can't access THEME, churvalooh and twilight... it says access error from terminal
2009-07-14T15:05:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	this folders do not appear on nautilus
2009-07-14T15:05:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	dosfsck complains about them too. I'm assuming corruption, either of the filesystem or the hardware kind.
2009-07-14T15:05:00.000Z	mzz	gharz	I'd make sure there's a fewer files on the root of the filesystem before trying to repair further though.
2009-07-14T15:07:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	i guess i'll just reformat this
2009-07-14T15:11:00.000Z	gharz	mzz	thanks!!!!!!
