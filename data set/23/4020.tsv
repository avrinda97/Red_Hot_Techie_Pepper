2010-04-25T20:38:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	yes.
2010-04-25T20:38:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	no
2010-04-25T20:29:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	you have your /home on a separate partition?
2010-04-25T20:31:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	What do you have, then, for two partitions?
2010-04-25T20:32:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	the best way to do that would be to have your / and /home on two separate partitions. Things you install will go to / and all of your user data will be separate on /home
2010-04-25T20:36:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	once you follow that tutorial to put your /home on a separate partition, everything will be installed to the / partition.
2010-04-25T20:37:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	I give 10gb for my / and the rest of my disk is my /home partition. I have never needed more than 10gb for my /
2010-04-25T20:37:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	no.
2010-04-25T20:43:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	you cannot do that, it doesn't work that way
2010-04-25T20:44:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	installing things to separate partitions like that isn't how package management works
2010-04-25T20:46:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	you can install KDE along side your GNOME environment. sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop. You can then choose what environment you can boot into at the login manager
2010-04-25T20:46:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	you're going to have to resize it, then.
2010-04-25T20:47:00.000Z	h00k	azertuio	You will need to resize the partition, there is not a way of installing it to another partition.
