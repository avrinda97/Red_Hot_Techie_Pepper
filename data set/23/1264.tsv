2011-01-07T23:16:00.000Z	pr0ph3t		hi all
2011-01-07T23:16:00.000Z	pr0ph3t		I'm having some problems with a couple of rfswitches that have not been implemented in the driver I am using, more specifically those for the 3g modem, for bluetooth and wifi all is good. Is there anyway I could set them up without recompiling the kernel and applying the patch?
2011-01-07T23:16:00.000Z	GeekSquid	pr0ph3t	what hardware?
2011-01-07T23:17:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	asus laptop UL30A
2011-01-07T23:17:00.000Z	GeekSquid	pr0ph3t	specifically the 3G modem
2011-01-07T23:17:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	there is a patch for it, yes the 3g modem
2011-01-07T23:18:00.000Z	GeekSquid	pr0ph3t	specifically the 3G modem hardware chip identifier
2011-01-07T23:18:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	but it hasn't been merged to mainline yet
2011-01-07T23:19:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	the soft and HW switches
2011-01-07T23:19:00.000Z	GeekSquid	pr0ph3t	if I don't know who made the 3G modem (it wasn't asus- they don't make them) and the model of the 3g modem I cannot help you... please answer the question
2011-01-07T23:20:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	it's Hawei
2011-01-07T23:20:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	let me find exactly the code
2011-01-07T23:21:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	it's Huawei EM770
2011-01-07T23:24:00.000Z	GeekSquid	pr0ph3t	does the card work? I mean, are you able to connect to the internet from within ubuntu?
2011-01-07T23:25:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	I can use it on windows yes, I can talk to it to a certain extent but rfkills list all only gives me the wifi and bluetooth so the 3g modem is off I guess?
2011-01-07T23:26:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	I can talk to it in ubuntu I mean, there is a git-diff patch that implements the two switches I need, but it hasn't been merged to mainline kernel yet
2011-01-07T23:30:00.000Z	GeekSquid	pr0ph3t	I think you are waiting for that to be merged, you would have a huge learning curve to compile a new kernel, and that is beyond the scope of the help you can receive here. ... however you can try a newer kernel from ppa to see if it has been implemented into later kernels... see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas or just the kernel ppa here https://launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/+archive/ppa
2011-01-07T23:31:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	I am running 2.6.37 at the moment and sadly the patch hasn't been implemented, I have compiled a kernel already but I don't know how to apply the patch to it
2011-01-07T23:32:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	I know it is patch p0 < file but I don't know which file :P
2011-01-07T23:34:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	can you please help me apply the patch to the kernel sources I prepared? http://dev.iksaif.net/issues/108 this is where the patch should be
2011-01-07T23:35:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	I have git but I don't know how to download the patch
2011-01-07T23:35:00.000Z	GeekSquid	pr0ph3t	beyond me, and like I said beyond the scope for this room ... try #ubuntu-kernel
2011-01-07T23:35:00.000Z	pr0ph3t	GeekSquid	will do thanks
