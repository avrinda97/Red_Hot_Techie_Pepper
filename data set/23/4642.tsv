2007-12-25T13:15:00.000Z	dominicus		anyone know if Gutsy does not force you to use the keyring manager for wi-fi?
2007-12-25T13:15:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	if you don't connect to any secured wifi, it shouldn't use it
2007-12-25T13:16:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	I think gutsy has a new option to save your passphrase
2007-12-25T13:17:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	if you don't rome, you could just turn off network-manager and hard-code it
2007-12-25T13:17:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	but that's a bunch of anoying config files
2007-12-25T13:17:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	SECURITY OMG! ;)
2007-12-25T13:18:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	so hard-code it
2007-12-25T13:18:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	wpa_supplicant.conf
2007-12-25T13:18:00.000Z	dominicus	SuperQ	i'm not gonna hardcode it.. cause I just won't be able to do it. Until there is an official way I just won't bother
2007-12-25T13:19:00.000Z	dominicus	SuperQ	maybe if there was an app.. but a little hack.. nah
2007-12-25T13:19:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	yea, sorry, wish it was easier
2007-12-25T13:19:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	hold on a sec, let me see if there's another way
2007-12-25T13:19:00.000Z	dominicus	SuperQ	my ears are open
2007-12-25T13:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	yea, I got nothing
2007-12-25T13:29:00.000Z	dominicus	SuperQ	it's ok.. I just dont think that not giving the users a choice is good
2007-12-25T13:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	The only thing I can think of is to take apart the C code that prompts and write something that reads a dotfile
2007-12-25T13:29:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	I don't think it's intentional
2007-12-25T13:30:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	I think it's just what the author thought was "good enough"
2007-12-25T13:30:00.000Z	dominicus	SuperQ	Well anything that's free is good enough.. but it can always be better
2007-12-25T13:30:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	Hrm, I wonder which app is actually asking for the passphrase
2007-12-25T13:30:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	there is a pam plugin
2007-12-25T13:30:00.000Z	SuperQ	dominicus	but I don't think that's going to help with auto-login
2007-12-25T13:32:00.000Z	dominicus	SuperQ	whatareyougonnado.. it's ok, thanks for the help anyways
