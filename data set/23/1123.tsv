2010-08-17T12:05:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	just ask, ...
2010-08-17T12:09:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	well, with Linux you usually just don't download software and install it, you use the software management tool.
2010-08-17T12:10:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	the point is, with Linux you've got basicall the following sorts of software: packages prepackaged for your distribution, source distributed packages that you need to compile/install and the last one would be 3rd party binary installers, which are usually seldom.
2010-08-17T12:10:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	press Alt-F2 and type xchat [Enter]
2010-08-17T12:11:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	it will give you an error if you have it not installed or start xchat.
2010-08-17T12:11:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	I'd expect it to be in the Internet group of the menu, btw, ...
2010-08-17T12:12:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	one of the issues that make Linux support such a pain is that it by default translates itself, so I cannot tell you the exact strings you have to look for, because my Gnome uses German strings, ...
2010-08-17T12:12:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	Unix/Linux has no concept of drives.
2010-08-17T12:13:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	In Unix you have the filesystem and "partitions/drives" can be mounted somewhere, ...
2010-08-17T12:13:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	so if you have say a Windows C: on the box, I'd expect it somewhere in /media/ to be mounted.
2010-08-17T12:14:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	so your home directory is usually in /home/USERNAME
2010-08-17T12:15:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	software is installed under different prefixes (/, /usr, /usr/local or /opt) depending upon a number of properties, but you do not care usually, because the PATH is setup so that it will just find the program as needed.
2010-08-17T12:16:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	in Gnome all devices (e.g. Windows partitions, USB storage devices, ...) should show up as icons on your desktop, just double click on them.
2010-08-17T12:21:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	why would you care?
2010-08-17T12:21:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	there are probably a number of GUI apps for this somewhere in the Gnome menu, but it's usually really not an issue.
2010-08-17T12:22:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	plus "resources" in the Windows sense there aren't any. There are stuff like CPU load or memory usage, and especially this is often misinterpreted => free memory on a Linux box as such is bad => much better to use it for cache, ...
2010-08-17T12:23:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	but WindowsXP users complain usually that all the memory is taken rather quickly, ...
2010-08-17T12:23:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	but in fact that's a good thing.
2010-08-17T12:29:00.000Z	Aerec	yacc	If I wanna uninstall something what would I do?
2010-08-17T12:29:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	synaptic
2010-08-17T12:45:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	that depends, you start with avidemux
2010-08-17T12:46:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	there are a number of commandline tools that are quite useful if you need to do batch converting, ...
2010-08-17T12:49:00.000Z	yacc	Aerec	avidemux is okay for some stuff too.
