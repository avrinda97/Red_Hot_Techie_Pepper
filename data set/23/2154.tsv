2009-06-13T06:45:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		I have a quick question
2009-06-13T06:46:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		my laptop mini pci-e card (broadcom 43xx) wireless b/g card is failing. It randomly picks works an cuts out on all three of my OSs on my laptops tripple boot.
2009-06-13T06:46:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		I plan on getting a different card what would be a better replacement as the broadcom support was a joke
2009-06-13T06:47:00.000Z	mibbsy	onethekjrekjfads	atheros chipsets are generally good
2009-06-13T06:48:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads	mibbsy	thanks
2009-06-13T06:50:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		is there an atheros in particular are the atheros n cards anygood because my linksys n card has really weak range (weaker than my broadcom wireless g)
2009-06-13T06:51:00.000Z	mibbsy	onethekjrekjfads	generally yes. you might need to install a 3rd antenna for MIMO though if you get a N card
2009-06-13T06:52:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		is this a good replacement for my 43xx http://tinyurl.com/atherosgcard

2009-06-13T06:53:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		its b/g
2009-06-13T06:54:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		it randomly stops working in all three systems in my triple boot. (win 7, xp and ubuntu)
2009-06-13T06:55:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		then just works on reboot without reinstalling or changing any drivers at all. this just began happening recently.

2009-06-13T06:55:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		pavilion but it is a tablet
2009-06-13T06:56:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		i pulled the card it is mini pci-e
2009-06-13T06:57:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		I had no idea. so maybe a direct replacement is best?  I do know wireless N plus bluetooth was an option
2009-06-13T06:57:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		so i might look for that card should work
2009-06-13T06:58:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		is there a way to check if my bios will lock out atheros ?
2009-06-13T06:59:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads		killerX: what was your ? I did not see it
2009-06-13T07:00:00.000Z	mibbsy	onethekjrekjfads	looks like a good deal. i'd do some web research on compatibility (auction says "won't work with HP")
2009-06-13T07:02:00.000Z	onethekjrekjfads	mibbsy	I should probably read the auction thanks for your help.
2009-06-13T07:03:00.000Z	mibbsy	onethekjrekjfads	might be just because of dimensions of the card though-- yeah and he's gone
