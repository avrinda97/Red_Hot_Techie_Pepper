2004-10-23T15:54:00.000Z	SmokingFire		question: from Gnome's hig guide point of view. What do you think of when hovering the mouse over the menu's Applications and Computer that the menu's should highlight up?
2004-10-23T15:55:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	It's sometimes a good idea.
2004-10-23T15:56:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	But I don't know what the Gnome HIG has to say about that.
2004-10-24T16:07:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	For Ubuntu's main button theme?
2004-10-24T16:08:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	I guess, but what do you have in mind? Brown highlighting of white?
2004-10-24T16:12:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	Well, if you use a different theme there's highlighting.
2004-10-24T16:24:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	I guess you could ask
2004-10-24T16:25:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	The "Button"
2004-10-25T14:47:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	C is probably best, and most frustrating, python is more fun.
2004-10-25T14:47:00.000Z	SmokingFire	wm_eddie	best in what way? I mean for a desktop application raw speed is not the most important feature is it?
2004-10-25T14:48:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	With C you have the most up-to-date gtk libs.
2004-10-25T14:49:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	But my friend made a great MusicPlayer (Called Quod Libet) in just a weekend using Python.
2004-10-25T14:49:00.000Z	SmokingFire	wm_eddie	python has sorting classes like the stl of C++?
2004-10-25T14:50:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	Not sure, I'm just a python newbie, I took it up over the weekend to make a program called PyFolder.
2004-10-25T14:52:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	The only thing about C is you have to learn the C way of object oriented programming.
2004-10-26T16:26:00.000Z	SmokingFire	wm_eddie	and Aan234: You just need the correct settings in /etc/fstab
2004-10-26T06:12:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	killall name_of_app
2004-10-26T06:12:00.000Z	SmokingFire	wm_eddie	ok, thanks
2004-10-26T06:13:00.000Z	SmokingFire	wm_eddie	the problem is thats its rythmbox and its only in the tray
2004-10-26T06:14:00.000Z	SmokingFire	wm_eddie	BTW if I don't know the name of the app, how do I find out?
2004-10-26T06:14:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	top maybe
2004-10-26T06:15:00.000Z	SmokingFire	wm_eddie	wait double clicking on system monitor allows me to do it the windows way
2004-10-26T06:15:00.000Z	wm_eddie	SmokingFire	that works too.
