2008-05-29T10:29:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	what'd it say?
2008-05-29T10:29:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	Starnestommy has a point - try installing vim-full first.

2008-05-29T10:30:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	clicked.
2008-05-29T10:31:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	Yeah, looks like you should be able to fix that by installing vim-full
2008-05-29T10:31:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	 not sure if that's the full package name, but open up synaptic and look for vim.
2008-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	phoenix24	Striking7	thanks!
2008-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	Sure thing.  Did that work?
2008-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	phoenix24	Striking7	installing
2008-05-29T10:36:00.000Z	phoenix24	Striking7	yes; Installing vim-full helped :)
2008-05-29T10:37:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	Awesome! Glad to help.  <3 vim
2008-05-29T10:39:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	just wondering... what do you use vim for?
2008-05-29T10:40:00.000Z	phoenix24	Striking7	programing
2008-05-29T10:40:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	I figured, just curious what you do.
2008-05-29T10:41:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	just so you know, there are a ton of vim plugins for various languages and libraries.  There's a rails plugin for ruby on rails programmers, for example.
2008-05-29T10:42:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	which is totally different from the normal ruby plugin, which is also really cool.
2008-05-29T10:42:00.000Z	phoenix24	Striking7	vim-plugin ?
2008-05-29T10:42:00.000Z	phoenix24	Striking7	where can I get them ?
2008-05-29T10:43:00.000Z	Striking7	phoenix24	vim.org
