2005-04-15T08:47:00.000Z	slask3n		is there noone who knows how to set up xorg to use a tv as a secondary screen??
2005-04-15T08:48:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	doesn't look like it... although I don't think you need a virt refresh... depends on type of TV I guess though...
2005-04-15T08:49:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	its a old philips.. i had to call philips help center to get the refresh rate and max resolution, and she never heard about vertical refresh rate... but should i just skip the vertical refressh rate line in xorg config?
2005-04-15T08:50:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	comment it out for that monitor... see if it works...
2005-04-26T15:50:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	they use the same backends... k3b is just an interface for that... gnomebaker is very simular
2005-04-26T15:51:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	and would fit into a gnome desktop a lot better
2005-04-26T15:52:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	ok, i didnt know that.. :) is gnomebaker as easy to use, and can burn images? i tried toaster once but it was reall crappy i thought...
2005-04-26T15:52:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	it is described on its site as: 'a k3b clone for gnome' ... its interface is very simular
2005-04-26T15:53:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	ok ill try it :) sounds nice...
2005-04-26T15:54:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	its basic interface: http://gnomebaker.sourceforge.net/wp-content/gnomebaker1.png is pretty much the same...
2005-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	are there anything similar to quanta for gnome too? other that bluefish then, ause that was nasty...
2005-04-26T15:58:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	apparently nvu ... but I've not tried that myself
2005-04-26T15:59:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	I don't really do web developement much... and what I do do, vi is fine
2005-04-26T16:00:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	ok. but what do you do then since you use vi?
2005-04-26T16:00:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	I type
2005-04-26T16:01:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	LOL! Is it really true?? :o hehe, no i ment what programming language do you use if any?
2005-04-26T16:02:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	heh... just basic HTML, CSS, and trying unsuccessfully to not suck at XHTML
2005-04-26T16:03:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	ok :) i guess vi has syntax highlighting then? i need it cause im writing PHP...
2005-04-26T16:03:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	gedit does ... not required here though
2005-04-26T16:04:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	also, so does nvu... it is basically mozilla composer, but without having to load the rest of Mozilla to use it...
2005-04-26T16:07:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	webtoe, ups: i have fell in love for the quanta, it has a nice syntax highlighting, autoclosure of tags, and some other stuff, the only bad thing is its made for KDE... but ive tested nvu and bluefish and some others too, but i dont like them as good as quanta..
2005-04-26T16:08:00.000Z	lunitik	slask3n	thats cool... just... quanta takes a year to run when you're using GNOME   :/
2005-04-26T16:20:00.000Z	slask3n	lunitik	another thing btw, do you know how to set the size of the icons? i found it a couple days ago but i formatted so now i dont find it anymore :s
