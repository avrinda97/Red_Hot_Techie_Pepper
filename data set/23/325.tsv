2011-12-11T03:00:00.000Z	Poz		its like the one that says ubuntu when it shuts down (with the dots)... but instead its just a blank purple screen
2011-12-11T03:00:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	post your /etc/default/grub to pastebin so people can see it.

2011-12-11T03:09:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	and you get a blank purple screen on boot? of ubuntu 11.10 ?
2011-12-11T03:10:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"
2011-12-11T03:13:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	did you open the file with gksudo ? or sudo
2011-12-11T03:13:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	gksudo mousepad /etc/default/grub
2011-12-11T03:13:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	or gedit if thats what you use
2011-12-11T03:14:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	do you know how to open a terminal?
2011-12-11T03:14:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	open one and do gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
2011-12-11T03:16:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	sudo update-grub or update-grub2 if that doesn't work
2011-12-11T03:20:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	did you update-grub ?
2011-12-11T03:22:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	listen carefully. maybe write this down on paper. When you reboot. it will load in text mode ( so maybe you can see why its taking so long to boot ) now. depending on your setup wou *might* need to type sudo service lightdm start OR sudo service gdm start and you *might* need to hit ctrl+alt+f7 after that.
2011-12-11T03:22:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	questions ?
2011-12-11T03:24:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	Poz	yea.
