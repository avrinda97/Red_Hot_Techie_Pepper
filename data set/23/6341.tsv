2006-12-07T16:58:00.000Z	shwag		Do I need to install a SMP kernel or something? Top is only showing use on one of my processors.
2006-12-07T17:00:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	what release of ubuntu?
2006-12-07T17:00:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	dapper
2006-12-07T17:00:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	you need the 686 kerne;
2006-12-07T17:01:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	  linux-686-smp - Complete Linux kernel on PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV SMP.   ?
2006-12-08T17:01:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	yep
2006-12-08T17:01:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	that works for Xeons ?
2006-12-08T17:01:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	on edgy and later the kernel is called generic and has smp by defaut
2006-12-08T17:01:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	should do, yes
2006-12-08T17:01:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	good info. thanks.
2006-12-08T17:05:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	do i have to modify my grub menu.lst ?
2006-12-08T17:05:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	no, installing the kernel sh9ould do so automatically
2006-12-08T17:28:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	im running off that kernel now, but mysql still seems to only be using one processor. top shows 1 processor taking the whole load.
2006-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	what does cat /proc/cpuinfo give?
2006-12-08T17:32:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	four processors...alld Intel Xeon CPU 4.00GHz
2006-12-08T17:32:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	then the are all recognisedand should be working :)
2006-12-08T17:33:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	it showed all four before I installed that kernel though.
2006-12-08T17:33:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	/proc/cpuinfo  always shows the hardware...but not if the linux kernel is using it.
2006-12-08T17:33:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	uname -a   shows  2.6.15-27-686 #1 SMP PREEMPT   now though.
2006-12-08T17:34:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	but before it was  2.6.15-26-server #1 SMP
2006-12-08T17:34:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	ah you were running the server kernel
2006-12-08T17:35:00.000Z	mc44	shwag	sorry I clearly know less than you :) try in #ubuntu-kernel
2006-12-08T17:35:00.000Z	shwag	mc44	no prob, thanks.
