2010-09-09T10:48:00.000Z	NAJI		hello, I have a problem with ubuntu, everything works just fine, excep that the hard disk get sometimes busy, just if you are installing or converting a video, I check the System manager where everything is normal, Firefox consumes 60 MB, Skype consumes 32 MB, and so, but that hard disk gets busy without sense f for a pretty long time and that's is frustrating, please help!!
2010-09-09T10:49:00.000Z	NAJI		I installed ubuntu on a IBM thinkpad T42, 1GB Ram, 60 hdd, 1.5 ghz pentium!!
2010-09-09T10:50:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	do you have indexing service enabled? desktop-search etc
2010-09-09T10:53:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	how would i find out those service are enabled??
2010-09-09T10:55:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	perhaps you have too less ram
2010-09-09T10:56:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	can't terminal tell the problem??
2010-09-09T10:57:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	you could try top and see if you have ram left
2010-09-09T10:58:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	i check the system monitor, no more than 400 mb is used!! swap is not used,!!!
2010-09-09T11:00:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	does ubuntu need defragmention as in MS-windows??
2010-09-09T11:01:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	check with "cat /etc/fstab" what file system you have. if its ext4 defragmentation should work automatically
2010-09-09T11:04:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	it is ext4!!!
2010-09-09T11:12:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	is the problem still there when you just boot without opening any extra programs? if so try "top" when the hard drive is active. perhaps that way you can identify the culprit
2010-09-09T11:17:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	I couldn't read that data!!
2010-09-09T11:19:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	try to look for the one with the highest cpu usage when the hard drive goes crazy
2010-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	Xorg is the highest: 4.5%!
2010-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	but!!! RAM is fully used!!
2010-09-09T11:21:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	the system monitor always says that is it only half used!!
2010-09-09T11:21:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	how can i find out that hard drive is being defragmented??
2010-09-09T11:22:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	well, does it have to work two hours to cash??
2010-09-09T11:23:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	dont know, you could look for the the virtual memory of each program in "top"
2010-09-09T11:23:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	the hard drive is crazy for an hour now!!!
2010-09-09T11:24:00.000Z	wertwertgfhjrer	NAJI	perhaps cryptopsy can help ya out
2010-09-09T11:24:00.000Z	NAJI	wertwertgfhjrer	Xorg: 72727 and gnome-terminal 88000??
