2005-10-30T06:12:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2005-10-30T06:13:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	That'll shut down X - ctrl-alt-backspace will restart it.
2005-10-30T06:13:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	Well, that'll start it if it's stopped and bitch if it's not... 'restart' will, well, restart it. ;)

2005-10-30T06:15:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	Why are you shutting down X and going console? (I'm just curious 'cause everyone else seems to be going more and more gui.)

2005-10-30T06:25:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	You could also look into using bitlbee instead, then you can use your favourite irc-client (irssi of course) for msn - and in an irc-like manner. :)
2005-10-30T06:27:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	Oh, I can't remember - but I think bitlbee.org might now... Or bitlbee.sf.net (can't remember the url).
2005-10-30T06:27:00.000Z	corincole	madsen	i'll check when ive left gui, what irc server are we on?
2005-10-30T06:27:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	irc.freenode.net
2005-10-30T06:28:00.000Z	madsen	corincole	Basically, just 'irssi -c irc.freenode.net' and then (in irssi) /join #ubuntu :)
