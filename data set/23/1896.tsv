2012-07-28T22:38:00.000Z	rodneymillerpca		Ok next question. My desktop thinks it has a laptop display. It is in 1024x768 (4:3) How do I loose the 4:3?
2012-07-28T22:38:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	that doesn't make sense, what is the native resolution of your monitor?
2012-07-28T22:41:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	if the native resolution of your monitor is 1024x768 and your currently running at 1024x768, and that is a 4:3 resolution, then I don't see the problem
2012-07-28T22:44:00.000Z	rodneymillerpca	tgm4883	It has everything bloated likes it 800x600
2012-07-28T23:06:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	4:3 simply means that given a pixel, there are 4 pixels horizontally for every 3 pixels vertically
2012-07-28T23:21:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	what version are you on?
2012-07-28T23:21:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	upgrade to what?
2012-07-28T23:25:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	do you need to install proprietary drivers?
2012-07-28T23:26:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	what desktop are you using?
2012-07-28T23:29:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	if you could fit 12, then you did something special
2012-07-28T23:31:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	but what we are trying to tell you is that is isn't
2012-07-28T23:31:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	you are just used to stuff being super small
2012-07-28T23:32:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	if you want to make things smaller again, you'll probably want to lookup how to change the DPI

2012-07-28T23:37:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	open up jockey and see if it says it's using the proprietary drivers
2012-07-28T23:38:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	pastebin the output of 'jockey-text -l'
2012-07-28T23:41:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	right click should work, or use pastebinit
2012-07-28T23:42:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	then use pastebinit
2012-07-28T23:44:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	yes, it's a program that will put it to pastebin for you
2012-07-28T23:56:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	yea that looks ok, providing your card is supported by nvidia current (which it should be). Have you tried going into nvidia-settings and changing the resolution there?
2012-07-28T23:57:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	run nvidia-settings (probably with gksudo) and look at the xserver display configuration
2012-07-28T23:59:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	that isn't odd, that is how the drivers work
2012-07-28T23:59:00.000Z	tgm4883	rodneymillerpca	which is exactly why I was trying to find out if you were using the correct driver
