2006-03-24T10:46:00.000Z	spiritz		andrewski: Ok so it's an applet, there's no way to start it without being in gnome?
2006-03-24T10:46:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	right click on your panel, select "add to panel" and search for "workspace" in the upper right.
2006-03-24T10:47:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	it has to be inside a running instance of gnome-panel, but you're free to run that anywhere.
2006-03-24T10:47:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	Ok let me try that
2006-03-24T10:47:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	I wanted to get this running under kde
2006-03-24T10:47:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	what's wrong with kpager, since you want to use kde?
2006-03-24T10:47:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	it is not supported by compiz :)
2006-03-24T10:48:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	oh... heh.
2006-03-24T10:50:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	I have been able to add it to my gnome taskbar, however how do u add it to the desktop backround?
2006-03-24T10:50:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	hmm, methinks kpager is not the same as this applet.  you're looking for something that sits alone on top of the desktop background?  i'm guessing it looks semi-transparent?
2006-03-24T10:51:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	yes, I'll show u a screenshot
2006-03-24T10:52:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	ok.  i think that you're SOL since you're running very unstable software (compiz) on top of a stable KDE, which doesn't work with compiz yet.
2006-03-24T10:53:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	sorry but what does SOL stands for ? ;)
2006-03-24T10:53:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	hmm... let's say "something" out of luck.
2006-03-24T10:57:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	I am looking for that : http://static.flickr.com/21/97621299_cc88112bfb.jpg; it should not be complicated to enable
2006-03-24T10:58:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	i can't load that screenie.  but "should not be complicated" goes right out the window when compiz enters the picture.
2006-03-24T10:59:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	compiz is actually pretty simple; have u tried it lately?
2006-03-24T11:00:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	yes, it hard locks my X.  it's simple when it works, but it's designed to work well in GNOME.
2006-03-24T11:01:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	I had to struggle a bit to make it work but nothing more than a regular linux issue :)
2006-03-24T11:01:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	i'd try aiglx to see if you get any better mileage with kpager.
2006-03-24T11:02:00.000Z	andrewski	spiritz	but i must be going now.  good luck!
2006-03-24T11:02:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	aiglx is not right for my hardware
2006-03-24T11:02:00.000Z	spiritz	andrewski	see you
