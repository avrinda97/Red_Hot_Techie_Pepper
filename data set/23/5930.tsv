2007-02-03T16:13:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	Done sudo dpkg xserver-xorg reconfigure and selected nv driver?
2007-02-03T16:13:00.000Z	linuxd00d		asc:nope not yet
2007-02-03T16:14:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	it's worth a try.  And becoming experienced with that command pays *evil grin*.
2007-02-03T16:14:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Asc	haha
2007-02-03T16:15:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Asc	thanks alot
2007-02-03T16:15:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	hope it helps.
2007-02-03T16:15:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Asc	so do i
2007-02-03T16:15:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	If the driver isn't listed, do sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nv
2007-02-03T16:17:00.000Z	linuxd00d		Asc:
2007-02-03T16:17:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Asc	will i be able to do this in the shell that ubuntu gives me when it cant run the xserver
2007-02-03T16:17:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	Hm, it looks as though the nv driver doesn't do 3d, but it should get the GUI running.  searching for 'nvidia' in synaptic returns some things that look useful.
2007-02-03T16:18:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	yes
2007-02-03T16:18:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Asc	thanks
2007-02-03T16:18:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	You might try installing nvidia-glx as well... not sure if it'll show up as a driver when reconfiguring, but it looks like it does hardware acceleration
2007-02-03T16:19:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Asc	thanks, well im about to try all this stuff youve told me
2007-02-03T16:19:00.000Z	linuxd00d		*FINGERS CROSSED*
2007-02-03T16:19:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	Righto.  Good luck.
2007-02-03T16:21:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Asc	i apt-get'd and no luck
2007-02-03T16:22:00.000Z	linuxd00d		im gonna go for a smoke and have a think
2007-02-03T16:22:00.000Z	Asc	linuxd00d	The drivers don't appear when you do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'?
