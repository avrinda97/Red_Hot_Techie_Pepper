2011-04-20T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jonii2	You should be able to get to the grub menu by holding shift during boot.
2011-04-20T05:54:00.000Z	Jonii2	Jordan_U	I can get the grub menu, thats not an issue
2011-04-20T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jonii2	Ahh, I misunderstood your initial comment in the channel. Just so you know, the automatic timeout was disabled *because* it was detected that Ubuntu wasn't booting successfully.
2011-04-20T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jonii2	Have you tried booting an older kernel?
2011-04-20T05:55:00.000Z	Jonii2	Jordan_U	ahh ok that makes more sense, but i'm still stuck :P
2011-04-20T05:56:00.000Z	Jonii2	Jordan_U	yep, same thing
2011-04-20T05:56:00.000Z	Jonii2		fail at (initramfs)
2011-04-20T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jonii2	What is the output of "cat /proc/partitions" from the initramfs shell?
2011-04-20T05:58:00.000Z	Jonii2	Jordan_U	I'll be back in 5 minutes with an answer :)
2011-04-20T06:03:00.000Z	Jonii2		Hey i'm back Jordan_U
2011-04-20T06:03:00.000Z	Jonii2	Jordan_U	it gave me a table, no errors, do you want me to type out the table?
2011-04-20T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jonii2	Just the last column, and a picture works as well. Basically I'm wondering if your root filesystem's partition is being detected at all. The next step would be to try to mount it from the initramfs shell.
2011-04-20T06:05:00.000Z	Jonii2		sda
2011-04-20T06:05:00.000Z	Jonii2		oops

2011-04-20T06:06:00.000Z	Jonii2		thats the last column
2011-04-20T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jonii2	Do you know off hand which of those would be your root filesystem?
2011-04-20T06:07:00.000Z	Jonii2		er, uh, no.  I believe windows and windows recovery are the first to though
2011-04-20T06:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jonii2	From a LiveCD, could you run boot info script as explained here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280 and pastebin the RESULTS.txt?
