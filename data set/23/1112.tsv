2010-09-15T11:59:00.000Z	graphitemaster		I think I b0rked my ubuntu :P
2010-09-15T12:00:00.000Z	graphitemaster		we'll see
2010-09-15T12:00:00.000Z	graphitemaster		i just damaged some stuff.
2010-09-15T12:00:00.000Z	graphitemaster		well, I for one added some sources to my list, from lucid ontop of maverik
2010-09-15T12:01:00.000Z	graphitemaster		then managed to break my keyring, and gpg in genreal.
2010-09-15T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	well that's a bad idea to start with
2010-09-15T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	lucid is lucid, maverick is maverick. You can't mix them as you have seen. There is a clear distinction between and mixing is not supported nor advised. Same with adding debian repos and such
2010-09-15T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	even if it doesn't boot you can fix it using chroot ;)
2010-09-15T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	as long as the OS has dpkg you should be able to install debs manually. Its going to be a long climb back
2010-09-15T12:04:00.000Z	graphitemaster	ActionParsnip	I can just reinstall if i break it.
2010-09-15T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	the OS is fine if you run it right and don't mix between releases
2010-09-15T12:07:00.000Z	graphitemaster	ActionParsnip	oh there is mixed releases galore here :D
2010-09-15T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	that's why you are getting issues then
2010-09-15T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	i'd reinstall and keep to your own release
2010-09-15T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	maverick isn't supported here either
2010-09-15T12:12:00.000Z	graphitemaster	ActionParsnip	it seems everything over here is going smooth :D
2010-09-15T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	nice
2010-09-15T12:14:00.000Z	graphitemaster	ActionParsnip	do you know how to reinstall keyrings?
2010-09-15T12:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	no idea, never had to do it
2010-09-15T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	websearch that error, see what turns up
2010-09-15T12:17:00.000Z	graphitemaster	ActionParsnip	nothing at all shows up.
2010-09-15T12:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	you may be able to copy the key from the livecd. Personally i'd reinstall. Sounds like a right mess
2010-10-13T20:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graphitemaster	there isn't one by default, it's not moved at all
