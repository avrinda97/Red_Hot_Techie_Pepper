2008-09-12T09:35:00.000Z	mikeyfbi		hey guys, i just installed 8.04 and can't get the sound to work properly as it did on my gusty install...i could play multiple audio sources (ie youtube and amarok) but now i cant
2008-09-12T09:35:00.000Z	mikeyfbi		and ideas?
2008-09-12T09:35:00.000Z	mikeyfbi		i did have ubuntu studio installed...maybe it had to do with that?
2008-09-12T09:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	No, no.....This is a known bug in Pulse. I suggest switching everything back to Alsa in System->Preferences->Sound
2008-09-12T09:36:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	ok i'll try that...think it'll require me to restartx for it to take effect?
2008-09-12T09:37:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	Amarok locks up on me when I play it and flash simultaneously, but it might work out better for you. Well, not X, but you might possibly need to stop pulse and/or restart alsa.
2008-09-12T09:38:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	can you do those from the terminal?
2008-09-12T09:38:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	yes
2008-09-12T09:39:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	WHOOP!  haha so far so good
2008-09-12T09:39:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	both youtube and amarok at the same time
2008-09-12T09:39:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	thank you so much :) :)
2008-09-12T09:40:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	You're welcome, and just fyi, we're ALL hoping that Ibex improves upon Pulse :D
2008-09-12T09:41:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	so Pulse is the default now?  what is ALSA then?  or why wouldn't they just use that? :)
2008-09-12T09:41:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	Yeah, they're in the process of pushing ALSA out and transitioning into Pulse.
2008-09-12T09:42:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	ah i see :)  when is Ibex due?
2008-09-12T09:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	The same way that OSS gave way to ALSA :)
2008-09-12T09:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	next month
2008-09-12T09:43:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	oh hahah, i shoulda just waited to re-install.  i've heard upgrading can be quite a feat sometimes
2008-09-12T09:43:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	yeah, it can, I usually prefer to start fresh each time.
2008-09-12T09:44:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	well i'll just get better at it...this time my ccsm profile didn't load properly...but the install was super fast and slick.
2008-09-12T09:44:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	a fresh install twice a year isn't much hassle with ubuntu anyway ;)
2008-09-12T09:46:00.000Z	bobertdos	mikeyfbi	exactly -- Let's just say that when something goes severely wrong with Ubuntu, I don't hesitate nearly as much to reinstall it as I would with, oh say, Windows.........:p
2008-09-12T09:47:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	bobertdos	touche, touche :)  well thanks again so much! back to work for me :)
