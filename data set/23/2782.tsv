2008-11-11T18:42:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	did you try 177 via hardware drivers manager?
2008-11-11T18:42:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	ya, tried 177 too
2008-11-11T18:45:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	exactly how does it not work? Like does it give you wrong resolution or x does not load at all?
2008-11-11T18:45:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	:  system freeze , cant move mouse ... cant switch to console ... just restart
2008-11-11T18:46:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	can you put output of lspci and your xorg.conf to pastebin?
2008-11-11T18:48:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	: if you tell me how i read the x.conf
2008-11-11T18:50:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	just open /etc/X11/xorg.conf with your favorite editor
2008-11-11T18:50:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	: http://pastebin.com/d2f0313f4   lspci
2008-11-11T18:53:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	: http://pastebin.com/d24e6f2e0     xorg.conf
2008-11-11T18:54:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	seems ok to me :S are you sure the card is not overheating or anything?
2008-11-11T18:55:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	: well, i think its not overheating ... how can i check that?
2008-11-11T18:56:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	with nvidia-settings
2008-11-11T18:58:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	: 70Â°
2008-11-11T18:58:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	it's kinda hard to diagnose as that behavious could be caused by broken memory or any other hardware fault, but if  you card is working anywhere else but in ubuntu, then it's driver problem. I my self switched to nouveau because i was disappointen in those buggy nvidia binaries.
2008-11-11T18:59:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	: my card works fine in windows and with games , my memory is ok ... i made 20 hours memtest86 without one error
2008-11-11T19:00:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	so it's the drivers. can you pastebin your xorg log in /var/log ?
2008-11-11T19:02:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	:  http://pastebin.com/d2f8e6c4c   Xorg.0.log
2008-11-11T19:05:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	no errors there, I'm out of ideas :\ If you dont need 3D that much try using the nv driver.
2008-11-11T19:05:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	 you could also try switching the card to other pcie slot if possible.
2008-11-11T19:06:00.000Z	DarkestSoul	Skry^	: im not sure, but i think i have only one pcie slot
2008-11-11T19:07:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	ok. btw my 7600GT is running at 55c with passive cooling so i'd guess 70C is quite high then.
2008-11-11T19:18:00.000Z	Skry^	DarkestSoul	it should not be too hot but maybe it spikes up when it crashes or something
