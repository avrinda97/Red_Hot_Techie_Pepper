2012-02-25T10:32:00.000Z	mi3		HI!
2012-02-25T10:34:00.000Z	mi3		can you suggest me how can I open image files in picasa photo viewer by default instead of gnome image viewer?
2012-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	mi3		?
2012-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	open the properties for the file type you want to change, go to the 'open with' section, and change it
2012-02-25T10:36:00.000Z	mi3	Chipzzz	there is no option of picasa photo viewer!
2012-02-25T10:37:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	no, you have to do it for each file type (.jpg, gif, etc)... just open the properties box for any file of the given type & change it there
2012-02-25T10:38:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	for example, put a jpg on your desktop, right click on it, select properties, and change which program opens it... done for all jpg's
2012-02-25T10:39:00.000Z	mi3	Chipzzz	give me the command to open that file from picasa cos i dont have that option
2012-02-25T10:40:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	under your choices, there's a button marked "Show other applications".. click that
2012-02-25T10:41:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	picasa should be in that list
2012-02-25T10:43:00.000Z	mi3	Chipzzz	I right click on the png/jpg file then select open with other application, then there is no option for picasa however there is custom command option so i guess there must be a command to open it via picasa can you suggest me that command?
2012-02-25T10:44:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	"select open with other application" is different from opening the properties box, selecting the "open with" tab and clicking the "Show other applications" button
2012-02-25T10:44:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	;-)
2012-02-25T10:48:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	the command would be /path/to/picasa %u ... to find the full path to picasa just type "which picasa"
2012-02-25T10:51:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	i don't have it installed, but i'd expect them to be in .config/picasa
2012-02-25T10:52:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	sorry ~/.config/picasa
2012-02-25T10:53:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	you're sure it's installed?
2012-02-25T10:56:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	google tells me they're in ~/.google/picasa
2012-02-25T10:57:00.000Z	mi3	Chipzzz	i got that folder now?
2012-02-25T10:59:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	that was for an installation running under wine... is your running native or under wine?
2012-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	you could try "locate picasa | less" and find them :-)
2012-02-25T11:06:00.000Z	mi3	Chipzzz	how long are there ? i will be back in 20? can you hang on?
2012-02-25T11:08:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mi3	i'll pribably be hanging around...
