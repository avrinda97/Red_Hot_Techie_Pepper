2006-12-08T07:43:00.000Z	Cubed		yay.......... i ALMOST installed that damn ndiswrapper....... can anyone tell a noob how i can make sure i have my DEPENDENCIES  in order?
2006-12-08T07:43:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	what dependencies?
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	Cubed		hell if i know
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	Cubed		that what it tells me when i try to install the deb
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	Cubed		for ndiswrapper
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	Cubed		i wen in terminal
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	are you installing it from apt?
2006-12-08T07:44:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	apt should install the dependencies for you
2006-12-08T07:45:00.000Z	Cubed		no i can't, i can't set up my internet so i have no access to online
2006-12-08T07:45:00.000Z	Cubed		so how do i manually install them?
2006-12-08T07:45:00.000Z	Cubed		or if there is an easier way, i would like to know
2006-12-08T07:46:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	well if you put the other .debs in the same folder as the ndiswrapper, dpkg should install all of the needed files
2006-12-08T07:47:00.000Z	Cubed	blameless	how do i know if i have all the debs?
2006-12-08T07:47:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	dpkg should spit out what it is depending on
2006-12-08T07:47:00.000Z	Cubed	blameless	all i downloaded was a file called ndiswrapper-modules2.6.deb
2006-12-08T07:47:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	was that built for ubuntu?
2006-12-08T07:48:00.000Z	blameless		i went ahead and built the ndiswrapper for source
2006-12-08T07:48:00.000Z	Cubed	blameless	i'm not sure, i thought all debs relate to debian-based linux systems like ubunt
2006-12-08T07:48:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	well it has to match the kernel version in ubuntu.  if not, it'll have to be rebuilt
2006-12-08T07:49:00.000Z	blameless	Cubed	and in that case, you might as well download the tar.gz and build it
2006-12-08T07:49:00.000Z	Cubed	blameless	i'm new to ubuntu, i have ver 6.10 edgy
2006-12-08T07:50:00.000Z	Cubed	blameless	i think my kernel ver in usr/src/ is ver 2.6(maybe a 2.6.7.1 or somthing like that)
2006-12-08T07:51:00.000Z	Cubed	blameless	what kernel version comes with 6.10 edgy ubuntu??????????
