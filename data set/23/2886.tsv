2009-06-18T02:46:00.000Z	elli222		Uh, why wont dpkg-reconfigure replace deleted configuration files?
2009-06-18T02:47:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	why would you expect it to?
2009-06-18T02:47:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	in any case, can you be more specific?
2009-06-18T02:48:00.000Z	elli222	jrib	i deleted the configuration files for libsensors3 and 4. i was kinda hoping a program with that name would replace configuration files...
2009-06-18T02:50:00.000Z	elli222		init=/bin/bash works. sometines sh being a symlink will fail...
2009-06-18T02:50:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	I'm pretty sure it just runs the .config and .postinst files for a package (or similar).  Just purge your package and reinstall it
2009-06-18T02:51:00.000Z	elli222		there REALLY needs to be a purge-reinstall option...
2009-06-18T02:53:00.000Z	elli222	jrib	how can i forcefully purge the packages without removing other packages?
2009-06-18T02:54:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	have you tried just reinstalling?
2009-06-18T02:54:00.000Z	elli222		-without removing other packages-
2009-06-18T02:54:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	you can use dpkg to force things like that
2009-06-18T02:55:00.000Z	elli222		ooh, dark dpkg magic...
2009-06-18T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	dpkg --install --force-confmiss PACKAGE.deb   may be what you want.  You can probably pass similar flags to apt-get
2009-06-18T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	the mighty google tells me: apt-get -o DPkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" --reinstall install <packagename>
2009-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	what file specifically are you trying to get back?
2009-06-18T03:01:00.000Z	elli222		sensors.conf and sensors3.conf
2009-06-18T03:02:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	dpkg -S /etc/sensors.conf
2009-06-18T03:02:00.000Z	elli222		dpkg: /etc/sensors.conf not found.
2009-06-18T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	so no package owns that file
2009-06-18T03:03:00.000Z	elli222		uh, dpkg-reconfigure says "not replacing deleted configuration file /etc/sensors.conf"
2009-06-18T03:04:00.000Z	elli222		it must be owned by some package :o
2009-06-18T03:04:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	why not read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto
2009-06-18T03:05:00.000Z	jrib	elli222	good luck (i must go)
