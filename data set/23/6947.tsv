2006-04-01T14:04:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	Try modifying your xorg.conf - add a line like FontPath     "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc" and see if that helps. Looks like that package hasn't been converted over to using /usr/share/X11/fonts .
2006-04-01T14:04:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Thank you very much kind sir. Is there anyway I can kind out where the fonts where installed to? I don't know off the top of my head. Will synaptics tell me?
2006-04-01T14:05:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	I don't think synaptics can do it. If you type "dpkg -L packagename |more" in a terminal, that'll list all files belong to a specific package.
2006-04-01T14:05:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Thank you sir.
2006-04-01T14:08:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	What was that command you said?
2006-04-01T14:08:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Nevermind. I got it.
2006-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	You're quite welcome. If you want to test if the font path change helps without logging out, you can do "xset +fp /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc", followed by "xset fp rehash". If you can then see your new fonts, you can add '  FontPath     "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc"   ' to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and that change will be permanent.
2006-04-01T14:10:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Yeah, I just added the path to my xorg.conf. The fonts where installed under /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc or something like that, and that wasn't a FontPath in my xorg.conf, so I added it.
2006-04-01T14:11:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Actually, it was that exact path you said.
2006-04-01T14:13:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	I spoke too soon. On running xset +fp <dir> it tells me http://pastebin.com/624559
2006-04-01T14:16:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	Hmm, maybe your package version is different from mine. Try "dpkg -L xfonts-artwiz |more" to see where the fonts are located, should be something like "/usr/blah/blah/misc". Then use that directory with the xset line.
2006-04-01T14:17:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Yeah, restarting X didn't help either.
2006-04-01T14:21:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	There's something weird about the artwiz package. I'll go off and mess with it for a few minutes, let you know if I find anything.
2006-04-01T14:21:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Thank you.
2006-04-01T14:41:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	Alright, I got my X server to recognize the artwiz fonts. I put a script to do what I did at http://nullinfinity.org/fontscript . You can download that, and then do "sudo bash /path/to/fontscript" and hopefully that'll get the fonts working for you too. The script is probably not optimal, but at least it shouldn't do any damage. The worst thing that can happen is that you'll end up with extra some symbolic links in a font directory.
2006-04-01T14:44:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	I see you put the rehash in the script. That means I don't have to restart X, correct? I just ran it after looking over the code, and it looks good from here (not really a coder), but the font's still aren't there.
2006-04-01T14:45:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	That's correct. Does "xlsfonts |grep artwiz" print anything?
2006-04-01T14:45:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Yeah, quite a bit of stuff.
2006-04-01T14:48:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	Okay, that means that the X server sees the fonts, which is good. Now what remains is to get gnome to see them too. I'll disappear for a few minutes again...
2006-04-01T15:06:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	I think I have the final piece of the puzzle. Do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig" and then answer yes to the question about bitmapped fonts.
2006-04-01T15:06:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	Thanks mate. I'll get back to ya.
2006-04-01T15:08:00.000Z	sethrd	johanbr	That was it. Thanks again mate.
2006-04-01T15:09:00.000Z	johanbr	sethrd	You're welcome. Glad I could help.
