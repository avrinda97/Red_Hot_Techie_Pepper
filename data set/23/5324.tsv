2007-12-12T02:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	derp	then you're doing something wrong.
2007-12-12T02:34:00.000Z	derp	IndyGunFreak	i ran the command "sudo mv /etc/apt ~"
2007-12-12T02:35:00.000Z	derp	IndyGunFreak	and i can't get emacs to work because my apt-get stopped owrking
2007-12-12T02:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	derp	why did apt-get stop working?
2007-12-12T02:35:00.000Z	derp	IndyGunFreak	i'm not sure
2007-12-12T02:36:00.000Z	derp	IndyGunFreak	but i ran "sudo mv /etc/apt ~" so i could edit my sources.list....or at least that's what a forum told me
2007-12-12T02:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	derp	what forum told you to do that?
2007-12-12T02:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	derp	i would suggest rebuilding your source list
2007-12-12T02:38:00.000Z	derp	IndyGunFreak	ok ill try that!
2007-12-12T02:39:00.000Z	derp	IndyGunFreak	wait...sudo apt-get exits on signal 11 with some complain about "GPG keyrings not found"
2007-12-12T02:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	derp	fix your source list, then install whatever it is you're trying to install.
2007-12-12T02:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	derp	and use a bit more auction in info you find online.
2007-12-12T02:40:00.000Z	derp	IndyGunFreak	will do
