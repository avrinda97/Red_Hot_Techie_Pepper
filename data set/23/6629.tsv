2006-02-26T13:19:00.000Z	ompaul	TonyB2006	dapper is very unstable
2006-02-26T13:20:00.000Z	ompaul	TonyB2006	are you trying to install dapper or 5.10?
2006-02-26T13:20:00.000Z	TonyB2006	ompaul	5.10
2006-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	ompaul	TonyB2006	so you have in place an AMD 64 and it freezes some of the way into the install, there are several possible causes of this, no definitive option, so first off there is a page with "boot options" which you can view by pressing F1 and then F5 while the machine is paused at the start of the boot process
2006-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	ompaul		!tell TonyB2006 about boot options
2006-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	ompaul		!tell TonyB2006 about bootoptions
2006-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	TonyB2006		the main thing is that i installed it once before a while ago
2006-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	ompaul	TonyB2006	the bot has sent you a message have a look at it
2006-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	TonyB2006		im already using vga=791 option
2006-02-26T13:22:00.000Z	TonyB2006		i know
2006-02-26T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	TonyB2006	there is also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulsKludge

2006-02-26T13:24:00.000Z	TonyB2006		*IS* booting up
2006-02-26T13:24:00.000Z	TonyB2006		and installing part of the system
2006-02-26T13:25:00.000Z	ompaul	TonyB2006	read that web page based on what I have seen here it seems to work for some
