2005-07-20T07:45:00.000Z	langenberg		Hi there,  I've got some problems booting ubuntu after changing the mobo and CPU.
2005-07-20T07:45:00.000Z	langenberg		Can I get some support.
2005-07-20T07:46:00.000Z	amichai	langenberg	doesnt look like it :) whats ur prob?
2005-07-20T07:46:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	The pc get's stuck after the "Unpacking linux ... OK, booting the kernel" message.
2005-07-20T07:47:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	I changed from Pentium3 to Athlon XP, quite a change.
2005-07-20T07:47:00.000Z	amichai	langenberg	its ur kernel
2005-07-20T07:47:00.000Z	amichai	langenberg	u get kernel panick?
2005-07-20T07:48:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	No, no panics, the pc just gets stuck.
2005-07-20T07:48:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	Does ubuntu save some information about the architecture or something like it?
2005-07-20T07:49:00.000Z	amichai	langenberg	like when u log in it stick, or during boot up?
2005-07-20T07:50:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	during bootup.
2005-07-20T07:50:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	PC booted fine, I upgraded the mobo and CPU, PC doesn't boot anymore. :)
2005-07-20T07:50:00.000Z	amichai	langenberg	try sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.10-5-k7
2005-07-20T07:51:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	Will I need an inet connection for that?
2005-07-20T07:52:00.000Z	amichai	langenberg	where r u chatting form now?
2005-07-20T07:52:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	Euhm, my pc, why?
2005-07-20T07:53:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	I'll need a livecd, and chroot the ubuntu install.
2005-07-20T07:53:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	am searching at my place for a livecd with pretty good inet support, but my gentoo disc seems lost.
2005-07-20T07:55:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	I already tried 'dpkg-reconfigure kernel-image-2.6.41-5' (or something similar)
2005-07-20T07:56:00.000Z	amichai	langenberg	nevertheless u'll want k7
2005-07-20T07:56:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	Ok, thank you.
2005-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	I know where the problem is from now. The pc got stuck at the same error "Unpacking linux ... OK, booting the kernel"
2005-07-20T08:36:00.000Z	langenberg	amichai	After using the 'noacpi' kernel option I could boot the gentoo livecd, do you know if there is a similar thing for the ubuntu kernel?
