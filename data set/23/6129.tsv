2006-06-14T13:59:00.000Z	n30n		is the room for firefox #firefox?
2006-06-14T14:00:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	you'd want to be on irc.mozilla.org I believe. It's best to check on the mozilla.org website for the correct channel.
2006-06-14T14:16:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	It's like a zip file in windows, you can just click on it to explore it and to unextract it just drag the folder inside it to the desktop
2006-06-15T12:52:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	That's not true in the US or in Europe (see the DMCA and the EUCD)
2006-06-15T12:53:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	yes it is. It's illegal still in US and Europe but they don't really impose it on you unless you are selling it
2006-06-15T12:53:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	So you just agreed with me, it's illegal.
2006-06-15T12:53:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	only formally. If you look at it in comparison to other places its just as legal as anywhere eles
2006-06-15T12:54:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	they just have a scare tatctic law
2006-06-15T12:54:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	That doesn't make it legal.
2006-06-15T12:54:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	well how illegal is it if the only thing they do about you doing it is nothing?
2006-06-15T12:55:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	AHHHH THIS IS SUCH A POLICITAL OFFTOPIC THING
2006-06-15T12:56:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	ok. yes you are right. it is illegal. I am only saying that i don't view it as illegal because they don't do anything about you doing it.
2006-06-15T12:56:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	they only time they do is when you copy and sell, and that goes into a totally different law
2006-06-22T12:50:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	You can use smbclient -M
2006-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	so if i was to try to send a message to a given computer what would it be? smbclient -M <message?>
2006-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	smbclient -M COMPUTERTOSENDTO message (i think)
2006-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	I'm not sure then, it's a long time ago since I used it. maybe you have to specify the computer name in \\COMPNAME syntax for some reason?
2006-06-22T12:59:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	Is the other computer running samba? and if so make sure you're using it's netbios name, and the computers are in the same workgroup
2006-06-22T13:01:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	they are just using novice windows. He sent me a message. and i've seen him send messages to windows before.
2006-06-22T13:02:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	Ok, if they are windows machines they will have samba running. Maybe it's worth checking the workgroups are the same. (Somewhere in /etc/samba/smb.conf i guess)
2006-06-22T13:03:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	no there is a command to just send a message to someone by just having their ip
2006-06-22T13:04:00.000Z	dsas	n30n	maybe you can use the ip instead of the machine name in smbclient? If not I'm at a loss. Sorry.
2006-06-22T13:04:00.000Z	n30n	dsas	im trying to. idk the syntax that well though
