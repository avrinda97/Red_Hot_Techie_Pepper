2012-06-23T12:39:00.000Z	EDawg878		I have an issue mounting my NTFS Drive, Error mounting: mount exited with exit code 13: Failed to load runlist for $MFT/$DATA.
2012-06-23T12:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	you mount an ntfs partition, not drive
2012-06-23T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	is the partition healthy? have you chkdsk'd it recently?
2012-06-23T12:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	chkdsk is a windows command, makes sure the data is consistent
2012-06-23T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	is it an internal drive or a USB thing?
2012-06-23T12:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	if it's internal and you don't have windows, why are you using NTFS?
2012-06-23T12:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	so what if the drive fails, where is your data?
2012-06-23T12:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	if the drive IDE dies and isn't detected in BIOS, what do you do?
2012-06-23T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	your call
2012-06-23T12:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	i suggest you grab a barftpe bootable CD and chkdsk the partition, you are making you life harder by keeping NTFS when you don't need it as you have no windows OS
2012-06-23T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	its great if its needed as Windows is crippled. Otherwise, yep it sucks
2012-06-23T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	ntfs isn't too shabby, you just need to know how to treat it :)
2012-06-23T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	if you setup partitions like Linux then it's not bad :)
2012-06-23T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	Windows CD can chkdsk NTFS partitions
2012-06-23T13:19:00.000Z	EDawg878	ActionParsnip	it wont let me
2012-06-23T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	I'd go for bartpe then
2012-06-23T13:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	just put CMD.exe on a floppy, or if you have a WIn98 CD around, boot that. Neither will have access to NTFS
2012-06-23T13:28:00.000Z	EDawg878	ActionParsnip	 a bootable cmd wont be able to run check disk?
2012-06-23T13:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	use an XP install CD or similar and it will be checkable
2012-06-23T13:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EDawg878	when you boot the XP CD, press R and you will get a prompt (its funny how I know this stuff as a non-desktop user of Windows)
2012-06-23T13:31:00.000Z	EDawg878	ActionParsnip	 thanks for the help i dont know much about Windows
