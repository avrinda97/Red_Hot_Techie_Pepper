2011-08-05T13:49:00.000Z	Hot2Trot		How can I edit ~/.mplayer/config so that whenever I use mplayer it automatically uses the option -fs?
2011-08-05T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	you can use an alias, it will mean mplayer ALWAYS uses the option
2011-08-05T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	in ~/.bashrc    you can add     alias mplayer='mplayer -fs'
2011-08-30T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	use ALT+F2
2011-08-30T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	the parent process needs to be running for it's children to keep running
2011-08-31T09:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	you can use:  cat vid1 vid2 > result
2011-08-31T09:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	the audio will be out of sync and there is a command to make it straight again
2011-08-31T09:14:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	The CAT command will put videos together and make one new big one? That seems nuts
2011-08-31T09:14:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	bout to test it
2011-08-31T09:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	or more gracefully: cat *avi | mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o myvideo.avi -cat *avi | mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o myvideo.avi -
2011-08-31T09:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	cat *avi | mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o myvideo.avi -
2011-08-31T09:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	will do it in one move :)
2011-08-31T09:17:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	will that take care of any video formats I have the codecs for, not just avi's? (obiously change the .avi in your command)
2011-08-31T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	I believe so, Have a search around to verify
2011-08-31T09:19:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	You are amazing, thank you for the help, and thank you for the help you've given me before and the help I'm sure you are likely to give me in the future
2011-08-31T09:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	maybe the opposite will happen too, makes the world go around
2011-08-31T09:20:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	Well, if you ever need help wasting several hours on google looking for complicated solutions to simple problems, I'm your man! :)
2011-08-31T09:27:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	hmm... I rejoiced a little too soon, I tried the straight 'cat vida.avi vidb.avi > newvid.avi' and 'cat vida.avi vidb.avi | mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o newvid.avi -' and each makes a new file called newvid.avi, but that file is just the first input file not stiched with the second one

2011-09-15T08:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	you can add emblems in nautilus
2011-09-15T08:36:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	kinda need in terminal so I can make neat scripts using the tags
2011-10-18T12:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hot2Trot	sure
2011-10-18T12:54:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	ActionParsnip	so i will be able to make a script that can do things in that emulated windows app?
