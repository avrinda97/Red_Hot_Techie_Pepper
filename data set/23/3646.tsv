2008-08-24T12:05:00.000Z	RifleEyes		anyone else know about triple-booting? or at least installing ubuntu?
2008-08-24T12:05:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	haven't really been watching your discussion. Can you sum it up? perhaps i can be of help
2008-08-24T12:06:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	don't thank me yet, haven't done anything ;-)
2008-08-24T12:07:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	i have a fresh laptop with vista installed. i used the livecd to make partitions to install xp and ubuntu. i'm pretty sure i did the partitions right. i've installed xp, but can't load into vista obviously because of the bootloader. don't have a vista cd. trying to install ubuntu currently but when its at the installation, it sees no partitions just "unallocated" with my total...
2008-08-24T12:08:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	and have you checked the output of fdisk?
2008-08-24T12:08:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	it sees all the partitions i made earlier
2008-08-24T12:09:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	did you reboot of the live cd? the kernel tends to not use the right partition scheme if you haven't rebooted sometimes
2008-08-24T12:09:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	reboot of the livecd?
2008-08-24T12:09:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	yes.
2008-08-24T12:10:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	what exactly does this mean
2008-08-24T12:10:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	after you've changed the partitions, have you rebooted your system?
2008-08-24T12:10:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	definitely. i've installed xp and stuff.
2008-08-24T12:12:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	alright. So if i see this right, the installer doesn't see any partitions while fdisk does?
2008-08-24T12:12:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	yes, and the livecd sees the drives ie., C:\, F:\
2008-08-24T12:13:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	but aren't you attempting to install of the live cd? Another thought is to create the partitions yourself first and then start the installer.
2008-08-24T12:14:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	thats exactly what i've done. i just made partitions a few hours ago. i'm using the livecd right now.
2008-08-24T12:14:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	and did you create a file system on those partitions?
2008-08-24T12:14:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	of course.
2008-08-24T12:17:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	if you'd like to see the result of the fdisk, i can paste it
2008-08-24T12:17:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	hmm ... it's odd that the installer isn't working. The output would be useful yes.
2008-08-24T12:17:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	in here or PM?
2008-08-24T12:29:00.000Z	hischild	RifleEyes	are you still there?
2008-08-24T12:29:00.000Z	RifleEyes	hischild	getting my messages?
