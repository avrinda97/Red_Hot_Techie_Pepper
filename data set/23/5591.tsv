2007-01-28T13:13:00.000Z	XplOzIon		anyone can help me getting xserver start?
2007-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	what happens when you try to start it?
2007-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	it wont start because it seems like it doenst find my nvidia card :(
2007-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	it wont even start using "vesa"
2007-01-28T13:15:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	oh. i had the same problem as you, but it worked iwth vesa. does nv work, becuase vesa doesnt support absolutely every card in existence
2007-01-28T13:15:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	im using a Inteal Motherboard i810 but the internal video is burned, so i am using a PCI Nvidia card
2007-01-28T13:16:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	i expect that it's trying to use your intel card then
2007-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	yes it looks like it is trying to use my internal card
2007-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	have you tried hte nv driver?
2007-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	i havent. Will do that now. Hold on :)
2007-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	huh? did you just say it was trying to use the fried intel?
2007-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	yes looks like it. As it set that as default when running -reconfigure
2007-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	do you know whats the bus ID of the first Pci Slot?
2007-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	couldn't you disabnle it in the BIOS?
2007-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	theres no option to disable it just to set whats the video. Internal or PCI.. i ahve set it to PCI
2007-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	sudo nvidia-xconfig
2007-01-28T13:20:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	i am running in terminal.
2007-01-28T13:20:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	that doesn't matter. just do sudo nvidia-xconfig
2007-01-28T13:21:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	Woohoo it worked using "nv"drivers
2007-01-28T13:21:00.000Z	XplOzIon	alecjw	hold on let me see if it works preperly
2007-01-28T13:21:00.000Z	alecjw	XplOzIon	cool.
