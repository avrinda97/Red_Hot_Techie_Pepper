2012-01-17T12:48:00.000Z	StrikerMan780		no idea
2012-01-17T12:48:00.000Z	StrikerMan780		why?
2012-01-17T12:50:00.000Z	StrikerMan780		yes there is
2012-01-17T12:50:00.000Z	StrikerMan780		if I type bash in my terminal
2012-01-17T12:50:00.000Z	StrikerMan780		it switches to it
2012-01-17T12:50:00.000Z	StrikerMan780		and it appears dash is installed
2012-01-17T12:50:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	"getent passwd $USER"  what shell does it show?
2012-01-17T12:51:00.000Z	StrikerMan780	llutz_	the output is here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1910278
2012-01-17T12:51:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	1 line, i don't have www atm
2012-01-17T12:52:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	"getent passwd $USER"  as user
2012-01-17T12:53:00.000Z	StrikerMan780	llutz_	I only run as root
2012-01-17T12:54:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	it's not, root account is disabled in *buntu by default
2012-01-17T12:54:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	you are on backtrack ?
2012-01-17T12:56:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	don't call for support in this case
2012-01-17T12:58:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	lsb_release -sc
2012-01-17T12:59:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	setup a user, add the user to admin-group, work as user.
2012-01-17T13:01:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	ask you vps-provider for support, they changed the installation defaults (of course, they had to)
2012-01-17T13:02:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	as you are acting as root all the time, what did you change 2 days ago? revert it and you'll be fine
2012-01-17T13:03:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	check your history-file, check dpkg/apt logs
2012-01-17T13:05:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	you are root on a vps... you should know those basics. "less .bash_history"  check apt-related logs in /var/log
2012-01-17T13:05:00.000Z	StrikerMan780	llutz_	I know a bit of linux, but, I am no guru... do I sense some condescending tone here?
2012-01-17T13:07:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	how to read/check textfiles has nothing to do with being a guru, thats basic knowledge you need to have
2012-01-17T13:09:00.000Z	llutz_	StrikerMan780	i already told you
