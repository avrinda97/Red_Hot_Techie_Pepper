2011-12-25T07:29:00.000Z	paulsomebody		Can anyone help with the syntax of the .bashrc file?
2011-12-25T07:29:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	 what's the problem?
2011-12-25T07:30:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	I have put there a command, but it does not seem to work. Do I understand correctly that things put in there are performed with the root privileges?
2011-12-25T07:31:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	 .bashrc is executed with the rights of the user the file belongs to. so if you mean /root/bashrc then yes if you mean /home/<user>/.bashrc then of course no
2011-12-25T07:32:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	If I put things into the /root/.bashrc will they be executed when I login as user?
2011-12-25T07:32:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	 no only if you login as root
2011-12-25T07:32:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	And I won't do that.
2011-12-25T07:33:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	so you could do following.
2011-12-25T07:33:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	Okay, so with what does it leave me? Are things put into the /etc/rc.local executed with root priveleges?
2011-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	as, but the file is executed at boot time
2011-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	I would like this command to be executed at login, as root. So I think that would be fine. Thank you.
2011-12-25T07:36:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	Syntax of the rc.local is as simple as putting necessary command between the comments and the 'exit 0' things, right?
2011-12-25T07:37:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	yes, keep in mind that the environemt isn't necessaryly the same as that of a normal user
2011-12-25T07:37:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	Enviroment? I am not sure I understand you.
2011-12-25T07:39:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	 each user has an env where your HOME,PATH....... is defined. Imagine you write iptables -F in your rc.local and /usr/sbin is not in the PATH variable?
2011-12-25T07:41:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	Okay, I got the picture. I think will simply use the full path.
2011-12-25T07:41:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	that answer sows you got it :)
2011-12-25T07:41:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	My command is 'evrouter -r /dev/input/by-id/usb-Microsoft_NaturalÂ®_Ergonomic_Keyboard_4000-if01-event-kbd'. I think it will be okay, will it?
2011-12-25T07:42:00.000Z	schnuffle1	paulsomebody	of your you need to give the full path to evrouter
2011-12-25T07:42:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	Ahh, yes.
2011-12-25T07:51:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	alvin_: I plan to do that as well, at some point.
2011-12-25T07:51:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	Ok, my Google foo goes the same way.
2011-12-25T08:03:00.000Z	paulsomebody	schnuffle1	I have no idea where the bin for the command I am trying to run is installed. Can you hint at where to look for?
