2009-01-12T02:05:00.000Z	enovativ		trying to create a bootable usb stick
2009-01-12T02:06:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	ext2 is pretty much bootable.
2009-01-12T02:06:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	i am trying to create a bootable usb stick to install windows xp on a different box
2009-01-12T02:06:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	use mkdosfs at your will. parted will use mk*fs too.
2009-01-12T02:07:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	i want the usb stick to be bootable, and the stick is only 1 GB...so i read it was advisable to use mkdosfs first to specifiy FAT16, and then use Parted
2009-01-12T02:09:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	then use parted for what?
2009-01-12T02:11:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	from what i read Parted was suggested to use to make a usb stick bootable
2009-01-12T02:12:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	cfdisk can make something bootable. mk*fs is generally used after partitioning.
2009-01-12T02:13:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	do i not have to create a partition...one for the boot area...and one for the data that i want to install ?
2009-01-12T02:13:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	it never hurts to make partition bootable after creating fs on it though.
2009-01-12T02:13:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	no, make one big partition.
2009-01-12T02:14:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	thanks..so it was called ckfdos ?
2009-01-12T02:14:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	cfdisk
2009-01-12T02:14:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	like Clear Format Disk
2009-01-12T02:14:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	thanks i will try cfdisk..i will be back to tell you what happens
2009-01-12T02:15:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	but this is not really the description. Just know that cfdisk is safer than fdisk.
2009-01-12T02:16:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	 ? (not really the desciption ? )
2009-01-12T02:16:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	what do you mean
2009-01-12T02:16:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	Clear Format Disk. This doesn't really stand for 'cfdisk'
2009-01-12T02:16:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	oh ok thanks....
2009-01-12T02:16:00.000Z	temoto-mobi	enovativ	maybe it's Clever or something even other. Forget it.
2009-01-12T02:17:00.000Z	enovativ	temoto-mobi	lol...thanks again...about to try it out
