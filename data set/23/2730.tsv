2008-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	it ran fine with 8.04
2008-11-28T11:06:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	sorry, the newest version of Ubuntu
2008-11-28T11:08:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	you could try http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html
2008-11-28T11:09:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	I have tried that, when i unzipped it Ubuntu could not run the program
2008-11-28T11:10:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	run it with 'sh flashinstaller....'
2008-11-28T11:10:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	ok
2008-11-28T11:21:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	i typed the "sudo apt-get install nspluginwrapper flashplugin-nonfree" it worked for one video...i loaded another and firefox froze again
2008-11-28T11:21:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	why did you type that command?
2008-11-28T11:22:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	i sent you the link for 64bit flash from adobe
2008-11-28T11:26:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	ok sorry i'm removing the previous command that I listed, then I have downloaded the flash plugin to the desktop how do I install it once I have unzipped it from the tar.gz file.  Sorry I am still somewhat new to the terminal
2008-11-28T11:26:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	sh flashplug....
2008-11-28T11:26:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	type that in terminal?
2008-11-28T11:27:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	type sh then the name of the file
2008-11-28T11:27:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	ok thank you
2008-11-28T11:30:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	when I typed that into the terminal this came back "Can't Open libflashplugin"
2008-11-28T11:30:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	you need to remove flashplugin-nonfree and ndiswrapper first
2008-11-28T11:31:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	I have done that
2008-11-28T11:37:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	I did remove the nspluginwrapper and the flashplugin-nonfree before typing the sh libflashplayer.so , this still did not work
2008-11-28T11:38:00.000Z	ejer	Trashypatches	oh, I thought you had the installer, close firefox, and copy that file to a folder in ~/.mozilla/plugins/
2008-11-28T11:39:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	 ok
2008-11-28T11:50:00.000Z	Trashypatches	ejer	is there a command i can type into terminal to copy the flash into the mozilla/plugin file? I can not find where mozila/plugin file is
