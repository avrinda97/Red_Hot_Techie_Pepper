2010-05-21T14:00:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	I actually was using wireless then suddenly both ethernet and wireless stopped working
2010-05-21T13:58:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	ifconfig eth down
2010-05-21T13:59:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	of course, you need sudo and you need to specify the real eth port.
2010-05-21T14:00:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	So I think I have somehow switched off the networking option and am not able to switch it on again
2010-05-21T14:01:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	so, is there a different question?  I don't understand if you still need something.
2010-05-21T14:01:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	Yeah, I am not able to figure out if I can switch on/off the network option from somewhere in ubuntu 9.10
2010-05-21T14:02:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	or else what reasons are possible for suddent switching off of the networks
2010-05-21T14:03:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	when I click on either ethernet or wireless network, the globe rotates for a long time and then it says u r disconnected
2010-05-21T14:03:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	Network manager or ifconfig can take interfaces up and down.  If both go down at once, I'd suspect an external cause.
2010-05-21T14:05:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	Yeah, I am able to connect to wireless through my phone
2010-05-21T14:05:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	So the network is working
2010-05-21T14:06:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	does that mean you are OK now?
2010-05-21T14:08:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	No, so I am able to access the wireless net using my cellphone, but am not able to access it in my laptop both with ethernet and wirelessly
2010-05-21T14:11:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	so it seems you have confirmed that your networking problem is not on the Ubuntu machine.  It is likely at the next step on the network.  A router/nat perhaps.  I don't know your network.
2010-05-21T14:12:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	Actually I was thinking that my problem is somewhere on the ubuntu machine only as I am not able to access the internet using that machine only, When I use my phone, I am able to access the net.
2010-05-21T14:13:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	So some setting is preventing me access the net from my machine
2010-05-21T14:15:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	maybe. That is not what you described.  If you can talk to the internet over the cell phone, then your tcpip stack is working.  You say both wired and wireless went offline at once.  That does not sound like an Ubuntu error.  Check your cable from the Ubuntu box.  What is it plugged into?
2010-05-21T14:17:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	I plugged the one end of ethernet cable into my laptop and the other in my router
2010-05-21T14:18:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	Do you see a light go on on the router when the cable is plugged in?
2010-05-21T14:20:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	I guess you are gone.  I am going to go eat dinner
2010-05-21T14:20:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	Yes, it's showing that light in my laptop also
2010-05-21T14:22:00.000Z	kj1986	Severian	sorry for answering little late, are you still there
2010-05-21T15:57:00.000Z	Severian	kj1986	Did you get your network issues resolved?
