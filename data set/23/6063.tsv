2010-08-17T01:10:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	yup, 1.6.19+ssl
2010-08-17T01:02:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	I installed it yesterday as well and I had to create all my own config files.
2010-08-17T01:03:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	Really? I have a web link for a simple.conf, but not sure if it's up yet.
2010-08-17T01:04:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	yea, I used that same config with eggdrop -m my.conf
2010-08-17T01:05:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	so you just created /home/user/my.conf ?
2010-08-17T01:05:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	yea, then run eggdrop -m /home/user/my.conf
2010-08-17T01:09:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	you installed 1.6.2 right?
2010-08-17T01:09:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	yea, whatever version was in the repos
2010-08-17T01:09:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	I'll try again on this comp and see what happens
2010-08-17T01:11:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	are you following this - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1028042
2010-08-17T01:12:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	trying to decide http://www.egghelp.org/setup.htm or http://www.nubae.com/eggdrop-irc-bot-with-logging-to-website-1
2010-08-17T01:17:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	because of permission issues and path issues I had to copy /usr/lib/eggdrop/modules to a dir in $home called eggdrop. I also put the .conf there and copied /usr/share/eggdrop/scripts then ran eggdrop -m simple.conf and all as fine
2010-08-17T01:17:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	thanks, I'll watch for that. Just started messing with their simple.conf
2010-08-17T01:18:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	ok cool... good luck
2010-08-17T01:18:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	thanks for that link btw.
2010-08-17T01:18:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	np
2010-08-17T01:26:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	what did you do for "user file"?
2010-08-17T01:27:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	the -m creates that and runs the bot. the nextime you run the eggbot you don't need to use the -m option
2010-08-17T01:27:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	yeah
2010-08-17T01:28:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	thats what I did anyway
2010-08-17T01:47:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	just tried to run $ eggdrop -m simple.conf and it gives me an error "invalid command name 'channel'"
2010-08-17T01:47:00.000Z	hiku	q_a_z_steve	double check your config file for "channel" you might have a typo
2010-08-26T12:46:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	hiku	have you ever dealt with eucalyptus ?
