2007-07-26T14:02:00.000Z	Carter		so what does it mean when the wireless connects and can function, but is unbearably slow?
2007-07-26T14:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Carter	weak signal or low bandwidth
2007-07-26T14:03:00.000Z	Carter	bruenig	it's not the signal strength, I know that. I'm right next to my desktop PC which is using wireless as well. It's been trying to load this website for over 3 minutes now
2007-07-26T14:03:00.000Z	bruenig	Carter	are  you using that same connection now with IRC?
2007-07-26T14:03:00.000Z	Carter		yea
2007-07-26T14:04:00.000Z	Carter		on the desktop, laptop is right next to me
2007-07-26T14:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Carter	ok so then you aren't
2007-07-26T14:04:00.000Z	Carter		oh, yea no it's too slow to work on the laptop
2007-07-26T14:04:00.000Z	Carter		thats how bad the connection is :P
2007-07-26T14:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Carter	are you doing any torrenting or whatnot with your desktop
2007-07-26T14:04:00.000Z	Carter		nope
2007-07-26T14:05:00.000Z	bruenig	Carter	what does pinging on the laptop give you
2007-07-26T14:06:00.000Z	bruenig		ubuntu has to be the only distro to not have ssh installed default
2007-07-26T14:06:00.000Z	Carter		I pinged www.yahoo.com
2007-07-26T14:06:00.000Z	Carter		I'm getting responses around 45ms
2007-07-26T14:06:00.000Z	Carter		I can load google.com pretty quickly
2007-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	bruenig	Carter	that is a pretty quick ping
2007-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	Carter		yea, I'm not sure whats going on
2007-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	Carter		I can load google.com
2007-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	Carter		but if I do a search the results never load
2007-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	Carter		just sits there "transfering"
2007-07-26T14:09:00.000Z	Carter		ever heard of anything liek this before bruenig? I'm totally lost at this point
2007-07-26T14:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Carter	what website is loading so slowly?
