2010-10-02T19:59:00.000Z	vincentk		I have a question - have a stuck update, been hung for about an hour on setting up lirc (0.8.6-0ubuntu4.2) on 10.4 AMD 64bit  Not sure what to do.
2010-10-02T20:01:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	open another terminal : sudo dpkg --clear-avail
2010-10-02T20:04:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	response is dpkg: status database area is locked by another process
2010-10-02T20:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	ok try , sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a
2010-10-02T20:07:00.000Z	vincentk		Blues
2010-10-02T20:07:00.000Z	vincentk		it is offering to kill the process...yes I guess?
2010-10-02T20:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	yes
2010-10-02T20:09:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	OK, looks like post processing in the terminal I opened and update manager went to a read meatball Update is complete...not all changes have been applied.  I had a lot of packages updating.  Should I re-run the update manager and un select the problem packag?
2010-10-02T20:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	now open synaptic /edit/fix broken packages/ and if needed click apply ...this is a reduntant step but just want to make sure
2010-10-02T20:11:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	what is the app/package you're trying to install ?
2010-10-02T20:12:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	- Being prompted for a restart before I run synaptic.  Should I restat first or synaptic edit / fix broken packages first?
2010-10-02T20:12:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	- it hung on updating LIRC
2010-10-02T20:12:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	yes fix the broken pkges first
2010-10-02T20:13:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	Thanks - trying now
2010-10-02T20:16:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	I opened syanptic and clicked edit then fix broken packages and status line in bottom of window states "Successfully fixed dependancy problems"  Should I reboot now?
2010-10-02T20:18:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	is the pakage manager rquirig a restart ?
2010-10-02T20:19:00.000Z	BluesKaj		or has the notification disappeared , vincentk ?
2010-10-02T20:20:00.000Z	vincentk		BluesKag - not the one I instantiated to run fix broke packages.  That restart dialog remains from my update attempt that we aborted earlier.
2010-10-02T20:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	ok reboot
2010-10-02T20:22:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	OK
2010-10-02T20:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	vincentk	so your reboot was successful , perhaps a different version of LIRC will work...does it require drivers?
2010-10-02T20:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj		gotta go
2010-10-02T20:37:00.000Z	vincentk	BluesKaj	I have successfully rebooted and update manager reports my system is up to date.  I thank you for your knowledgeable support and assistance.  I am in technical support for NetApp and I know how challenging support can be. Thanks again
