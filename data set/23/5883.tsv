2006-08-11T08:58:00.000Z	kaharas		hi all... someone knews a video player who runs without X server?
2006-08-11T08:59:00.000Z	kaharas		I would like to play a video without have to start the X server... just to save some ram...
2006-08-11T08:59:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	im not sure that would be possible.
2006-08-11T09:00:00.000Z	kaharas	node_runner	i read somewhere it is, but i cannot remember how...
2006-08-11T09:00:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	try running inside of a lightweight desktop instead of the default gnome, that will clear some ram.
2006-08-11T09:01:00.000Z	kaharas		i've still tried fluxbox...
2006-08-11T09:01:00.000Z	kaharas		and it uses too much ram
2006-08-11T09:01:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	hmmm, how much ram do you have? is that slowing your vide performance?
2006-08-11T09:01:00.000Z	kaharas		128 MB...
2006-08-11T09:02:00.000Z	kaharas		and when i try to run a avi video i see it bad
2006-08-11T09:02:00.000Z	kaharas		else if i've installed all the codecs and filters needed
2006-08-11T09:03:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	the thing is, even if some app played video without relying on x for a framebuffer device, it would still have to have it's own built in X-like display system.
2006-08-11T09:03:00.000Z	kaharas		node_runner... this means the ram usage will be the same?
2006-08-11T09:04:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	pretty much. unless you happen to find some project where some crazy guy decided to code his entire frame-buffer device completely in assembly. ;)
2006-08-11T09:05:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	how much swap space do you have?
2006-08-11T09:05:00.000Z	kaharas		300 MB
2006-08-11T09:05:00.000Z	kaharas		but the image is realy noisy
2006-08-11T09:05:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	do you get a low framerate?
2006-08-11T09:06:00.000Z	kaharas		yes, and the frame that the player show are really bad
2006-08-11T09:07:00.000Z	node_runner		hmmm. what codec are you using? if you use something really efficient, like ogg theora, you might have better luck than avi. can you re-encode the source file into something else?
2006-08-11T09:09:00.000Z	kaharas	node_runner	i'm using vlc codecs...
2006-08-11T09:09:00.000Z	node_runner		is anyone here running the xorg-fglrx drivers *without* having libgl1-mesa installed?
2006-08-11T09:09:00.000Z	node_runner	kaharas	I'm not sure what to tell you, other than to check and make sure your video drivers are working ok.
