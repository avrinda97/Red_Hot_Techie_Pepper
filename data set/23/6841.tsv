2005-12-21T12:40:00.000Z	yubimusubi		Oh, excuse meh language
2005-12-21T12:41:00.000Z	ejofee	yubimusubi	no, i think your english is good enough
2005-12-21T12:41:00.000Z	ejofee	yubimusubi	however, i want to know: how can one learn *anything* from some automatic compilation procedures?
2005-12-21T12:42:00.000Z	yubimusubi	ejofee	Well, for three days of pure cli...I learned how to actually USE it.
2005-12-21T12:50:00.000Z	yubimusubi	ejofee	I'm the one who claimed gentoo superiority...although I didn't actually say that...it's all preference anyway.
2005-12-21T12:51:00.000Z	ejofee	yubimusubi	i wonder what makes people feel gentoo is actually superior... the fact that it forces one to compile (or that it discourages people to use binary packages)?
