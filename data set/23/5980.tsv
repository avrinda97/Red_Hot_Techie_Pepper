2006-07-14T09:11:00.000Z	pdanger		Early use of dapper: is it normal for lots of apps to close without warning?
2006-07-14T09:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	ermm, no.
2006-07-14T09:13:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	I thought (and hoped) not - google earth, totem, VLC all doing it
2006-07-14T09:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	what do you mean exactly closing automatically?
2006-07-14T09:19:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	Google earth and VLC just close as if I've clicked quit, Totem tells me it's crashed; lets me click ok
2006-07-14T09:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	does synaptic report any broken packages?
2006-07-14T09:20:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	not that i know of; can i get it to check?
2006-07-14T09:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	it will tell you at the bottom status screen.
2006-07-14T09:20:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	in gnome? no nothing like that
2006-07-14T09:23:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	i see now - synaptic bottom status bar = 18843 packages listed, 1441 installed, 0 broken, 0 to install/upgrade, 0 to remove
2006-07-14T09:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	the best suggestion I can give you is to launch the applications from the console and see what messages they give.
2006-07-14T09:24:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	cool, i'll try - thanx
2006-07-14T09:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	also worth a look is /var/log/messages :)
2006-07-14T09:31:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	running VLC from terminal results in lots of errors when I try to open a DVD - can i copy them to you somehow?
2006-07-14T09:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	use pastebin
2006-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	#pastebin ? - how do i use pastebin?
2006-07-14T09:38:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	terminal output in pastebin under pdanger
2006-07-14T09:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	paste the link in here please.
2006-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18007
2006-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	what kind of video card do you have?
2006-07-14T09:46:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	from xorg.conf = Silicon Integrated Systems (SiS) 300/305 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter - it an 8mb vga card
2006-07-14T09:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pdanger	I think your problem is that the video card doesn't have enough ram to do any graphics heavy stuff (like vlc, dvd playing and google earth).
2006-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	pdanger	fyrestrtr	really? right, Ive got a 2nd vga card in the box that dapper detected but didnt install so il play with that - thanx again
