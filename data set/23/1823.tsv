2009-10-15T10:02:00.000Z	Roasted		and once again, considerable tweaking to be done to edit an installed program. Be nice if it did this automatically. Hate to be an ass but, seriously?
2009-10-15T10:02:00.000Z	Roasted		its something I see a lot
2009-10-15T10:03:00.000Z	Roasted		OMG BAD WORD
2009-10-15T10:04:00.000Z	Roasted		sudo: avggui: command not found
2009-10-15T10:06:00.000Z	Roasted		gksudo avggui does nothing, to whoever told me to try it.
2009-10-15T10:07:00.000Z	Roasted		okay, hell with AVG. What gui based virus scanners are there that will install properly and work fine?
2009-10-15T10:07:00.000Z	Roasted		menza - I have clamav, and I have cl amtk (the gui frontend) and it kind of sucks. I already tried it but it didnt find any viruses when I'm positive I have one on my flash drive.
2009-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	Roasted		doesnt look like avast is free
2009-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	Roasted		requires registration, license key, etc
2009-10-15T10:11:00.000Z	whatis6x9	Roasted	lol
2009-10-15T10:12:00.000Z	Roasted	whatis6x9	- wanna know something really interesting?
2009-10-15T10:12:00.000Z	Roasted	whatis6x9	- I did
2009-10-15T10:13:00.000Z	Roasted	whatis6x9	- its not an install, its my flash drive
2009-10-15T10:13:00.000Z	whatis6x9	Roasted	so let me see here... your flash drive windows programs have conficker and you cant clean it?
2009-10-15T10:13:00.000Z	Roasted	whatis6x9	- Programs? No. Data? Yes.
2009-10-15T10:15:00.000Z	Roasted	whatis6x9	- I'm just trying to utilize an Ubuntu virus scanner in hopes that perhaps I can zap conficker from my flash drive within Linux. The problem is, I'm also trying to tinker around with linux scanners while I'm at it. The curve ball - they either suck, or are terminal based (whcih is fine) but I'm just trying to find one that works.
2009-10-15T10:16:00.000Z	whatis6x9	Roasted	what ones have you tried so far? Avast! has a linux binary
2009-10-15T10:16:00.000Z	Roasted	whatis6x9	- AVG, ClamAV, and I tried Avast but it hit me with registration and licensing and Im just not dealing with that crap tongiht.

2009-10-15T10:19:00.000Z	Roasted	whatis6x9	- thanks. Im still curious about why AVG sucked so badly to install. :(
