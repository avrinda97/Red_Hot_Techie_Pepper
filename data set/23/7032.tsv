2007-08-09T09:35:00.000Z	roland		so it would seem no one can offer any assistance with my openvpn issue?
2007-08-09T09:35:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	I assume you configured it to allow passthrough.  Other than that *sshrug*
2007-08-09T09:36:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	I think I did but honestly not sure... not that familiar with the product... sad to say I can setup a pix firewall with vpn in 30 minutes.. been messing with this ubuntu box for over a week, and still don't have it working right
2007-08-09T09:38:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	I did my playing over a year ago, can't give you detailed advice.
2007-08-09T09:40:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	no worries, I'll keep digging.. I'll figure it out eventually... just amazing how difficult linux command line seems compared to cisco cli... granted I've managed cisco switches and routers for the last 5 years, and only been playing with linux a few months
2007-08-09T09:41:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	cisco is a specialized system.  Besides, the config files for openvpn are really straightforward.
2007-08-09T09:42:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	yeah, I know.. honestly I'm sure it's a config issue with openvpn but with shorewall.. not sure though... only been running the two of them a week
2007-08-09T09:42:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	shorewall?  Is that a wrapper for iptables?
2007-08-09T09:42:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	yeah basically
2007-08-09T09:43:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	did you turn on the logging for dropped packets?
2007-08-09T09:44:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	probably not, where do I go to turn it on?
2007-08-09T09:44:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	you can do it with the iptables command line.  You should really read a howto on iptables.
2007-08-09T09:45:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	will do.. thanks for the heads up.. will look that up now.. see what I can figure out
2007-08-09T09:47:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	though honestly if you think about it, it doesn't make sense that it's the firewall since I can connect and authenticate.. just at that point I can't go anywhere..
2007-08-09T09:47:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	did you enable ip4 forwarding?
2007-08-09T09:48:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	in the firewall? not sure... did all the config via webmin... honestly I need to just take the time to sit down and read the man pages
2007-08-09T09:49:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	webmin is more trouble than it is worth.  To get ip4 forward you need to echo true > /proc/ipforward (or something like that) and maybe do something with the firewall.  Its a necessary part of setting up a vpn to allow access to local machines.
2007-08-09T09:51:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	thanks for the tip... and at this point I'd have to agree about webmin being more trouble than it's worth... just thought It would make things easier on me until I was more familiar navigating around linux via the console
2007-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	read a howto on nat forwarding/masquarading and a short primer on iptables.  You'll only really need a few commands on the command line.
2007-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	thanks.. honestly it's all probably my own fault for being lazy.. figured it couldn't be much different than configuring a pix.. which... in a way it isn't.. but in a large way, nothing is quite where I'd expect it to be.. so all in all, I'm completely lost.. will read up on it... thanks for the help
2007-08-09T09:54:00.000Z	Falstius	roland	no problem.  Sorry I can't be more specific, I've only reluctantly played network admin in the past.
2007-08-09T09:55:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	can't blame you there... I do it for a living.. I do love it.. but some days it can be more trouble than it's worth
2007-08-09T09:57:00.000Z	roland	Falstius	been doing Windows administration for 10 years.. and cisco switching/routing/firewall administration for the past 4 years... trying to ween myself over to linux side of things..
