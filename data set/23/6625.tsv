2006-02-26T15:26:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	thx
2006-02-26T15:37:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	you shouldn't. Just run 'sudo chgrp ...'
2006-02-26T15:37:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	ok
2006-02-26T15:37:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	but I suspect it won't work anyway. Look into the umask mount option (man mount)
2006-02-26T15:38:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	you probably want umask=222 or similar.
2006-02-26T15:38:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	you are correct, doesn't work
2006-02-26T15:38:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	which is?
2006-02-26T15:38:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	listen to ubotu:
2006-02-26T15:39:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	why should I know this, has this to do with permissions?
2006-02-26T15:40:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	umask is for making a mounted Windows filesystem read/writable for users.
2006-02-26T15:40:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	ok
2006-02-26T15:41:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	so I should try to make a umask command to make it write/readeble, actually my fs is fat32 which is already readeble by itself
2006-02-26T15:42:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	you should really read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountPartitions?action=show&redirect=AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions ; you'll know more than I do after that :)
2006-02-26T15:43:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	reading
2006-02-26T15:51:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	the diskmounter said this to me: Disk /dev/sdb doesn't contain a valid partition table
2006-02-26T15:52:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	Mac disk?
2006-02-26T15:52:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	yes
2006-02-26T15:55:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	you know what that means? it's a mac drive... the script can't manage mac?
2006-02-26T15:55:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	apparently.
2006-02-26T15:56:00.000Z	joanverde	soundray	I'll try a reboot
2006-02-26T15:56:00.000Z	soundray	joanverde	it won't help I'm afraid.
