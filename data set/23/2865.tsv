2008-10-20T23:48:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	interesting article, but i think my problem falls under: The basic principles of reinforcement and rewards certainly work, but in a restricted context” — restricted, that is, to tasks that are not especially interesting.
2008-10-20T23:50:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	you're probably approaching the wrong crowd here, though. All of the helpers here who I know are doing it for the love of it.
2008-10-20T23:50:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	yeah i realize
2008-10-20T23:50:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	but so far i'm not having much luck, unfortunately
2008-10-20T23:51:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	I'm having no luck at all retrieving your link (launchpad hasn't been inaccessible for me all day)
2008-10-20T23:52:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	hasn't been accessible or inaccessible?
2008-10-20T23:53:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	not accessible, sorry
2008-10-20T23:53:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	well there really isn't that much more info there
2008-10-20T23:54:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	depending on where those errors are displayed, you may be able to halt the scrolling with the Pause key
2008-10-20T23:55:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	it's not perhaps a timing problem with your partitions becoming available only after a critical point during booting? Just speculating
2008-10-20T23:59:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	check out the errors around lines 400-500
2008-10-21T00:00:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	seen them, looks worrying, but I can't claim any ability to make sense of it all
2008-10-21T00:01:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	=/ the boot halts at around line 582
2008-10-21T00:03:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	occasionally, there are conflicts between SATA and PATA. I've seen this on an MSI mainboard, but it's been reported on launchpad for other hardware
2008-10-21T00:04:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	interesting...
2008-10-21T00:05:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	can i tell the installer to use one over the other? lsmod tells me i have a bunch of pata and satas loaded
2008-10-21T00:06:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	I don't think so -- I'd try to solve this kind of problem on the hardware front.
2008-10-21T00:10:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	I'm leaving now. Hope you can fix it.
2008-10-21T00:10:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	thanks for you help =)
2008-10-21T00:10:00.000Z	anewso1	soundray	and yea, me too
2008-10-21T00:10:00.000Z	soundray	anewso1	good luck. Bye
