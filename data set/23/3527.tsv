2008-04-08T07:18:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	ok so bittornado sucks, try ktorrent or azureus
2008-04-08T07:19:00.000Z	kelvin911	EvanR	do  they support filename that is not standard?
2008-04-08T07:19:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	duh
2008-04-08T07:20:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	trying one client does not excuse you for switch back to windows, since there are about 134 torrent clients for linux
2008-04-08T07:20:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	but if you were going to use ubuntu, perhaps you are better off with windows in the first place
2008-04-08T07:21:00.000Z	kelvin911	EvanR	which bt client is good?
2008-04-08T07:21:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	azureus is popular
2008-04-08T07:22:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	or did i not already say that twice
2008-04-08T07:22:00.000Z	kelvin911	EvanR	bitcomet allow unlimited download and limit upload
2008-04-08T07:22:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	..... every client lets you limit upload.
2008-04-08T07:22:00.000Z	kelvin911	EvanR	i can download 100 KB/s and upload 2 KB/s
2008-04-08T07:23:00.000Z	EvanR	kelvin911	azureus.
