2008-10-13T10:36:00.000Z	rfxcasey		What are files without extensions and can make there extension anything you want
2008-10-13T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	most are text, whats the files full path and name
2008-10-13T10:37:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	it's the vegastrike launcher
2008-10-13T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	try: file <file>
2008-10-13T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	itll tell you what it is
2008-10-13T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	e.g: file /usr/bin/firefox
2008-10-13T10:38:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	hey if I click on this vegastrike file it starts the game but if I make a link to the desktop or main menu and click that it freezes and I have to reboot x any idea what the problem is
2008-10-13T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	try cd ~/.Desktop; ln -s /path/to/file
2008-10-13T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	or make a bash script to cd to the containing folder then run the file
2008-10-13T10:44:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	I tried that not sure if I understand what your saying completely
2008-10-13T10:45:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	cd ~/.Desktop; In -s /home/rfxcasey/Games/vegastrike/bin/vegastrike-64
2008-10-13T10:45:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	bash: cd: /home/rfxcasey/.Desktop: No such file or directory
2008-10-13T10:50:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	when I put in file vegastrike-64 I get this vegastrike-64: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.6.8, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped
2008-10-13T10:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	then its a binary
2008-10-13T10:52:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	so why won't a link work on it? I can create working links for other files
2008-10-13T10:53:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	would giving it a .bin extension help you think?
2008-10-13T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	maybe it likes to be ran from the working directory, try editing your shortcut to specify the working directory
2008-10-13T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	no, extensions mean very little in linux
2008-10-13T10:54:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	Not sure I know what you mean about working directory. When I make a link it asks me to browse to the file and select it isn't that the working directory
2008-10-13T10:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	the working directory is the folder the file is sat in
2008-10-13T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	if you run a link to a file you are in the desktop folder
2008-10-13T10:55:00.000Z	rfxcasey	ActionParsnip	what else would a link contain? It is set to the working directory.
2008-10-13T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rfxcasey	you could make a bash script to cd to the folder the binary is in then execute it
