2007-12-13T02:06:00.000Z	P235		Hi, does anyone know if VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82830 CGC is good enough for the desktop effects feature on Ubuntu 7.04?
2007-12-13T02:07:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	is that built in to the motherboard?
2007-12-13T02:07:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	I'm using an hp laptop...I'm guessing yes.
2007-12-13T02:07:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	what's the model # of the laptop?
2007-12-13T02:08:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	Pavilion N5495
2007-12-13T02:08:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	I had a link of its particulars somewhere, I can dig it up
2007-12-13T02:10:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	what video driver are you using for X? vesa?
2007-12-13T02:11:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	don't know
2007-12-13T02:11:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-12-13T02:12:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	Driver          "kbd"
2007-12-13T02:13:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	okay, looks like you're using the right driver....
2007-12-13T02:14:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	Ah, I see.  So do you think I can run the desktop effects feature?
2007-12-13T02:18:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	hrm, looks like you might not want to use that.. it's only a 1ghz proc?
2007-12-13T02:18:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	yup
2007-12-13T02:18:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	I just turned it on actually...but not the cube feature
2007-12-13T02:19:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	yeah, i wouldn't bother. how much video memory does the card use?
2007-12-13T02:19:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	I was just about to thank you for holding my hand while I turned it on, hahaha.  Do you think I should turn this off?
2007-12-13T02:20:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	give it a go and see how good/bad it works and decide for yourself :)
2007-12-13T02:23:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	is there a command like htop to show me how much of the video card I'm using?
2007-12-13T02:23:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	nafaik..
2007-12-13T02:24:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	but lspci -v -v -v  should cast a bit of light, also look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-12-13T02:29:00.000Z	P235	[Scooter]	thanks for the suggestions.  With this laptop the desktop effects work well enough, but it just slows down a little when you scroll up or down windows.  I'll do without, but it's a good tech preview as the feature claims.
2007-12-13T02:31:00.000Z	[Scooter]	P235	:)
