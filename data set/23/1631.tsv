2009-12-26T00:42:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	I hear your frustration, and I've had plenty of grub/grub2 headaches as well, but I believe their stated reasons for the grub->grub2 migration are compelling.
2009-12-26T00:45:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	I guess I have to keep faith and learn again, you see, a transition from an expert to a newbie is traumatizing. We demand counselling to accompany the Grub2 HOWTO
2009-12-26T00:46:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	traumatizing, for sure
2009-12-26T00:47:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	are you looking for a hand translating your menu.lst to the grub.cfg form?
2009-12-26T00:48:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	I need to customize my grub2 bootloader
2009-12-26T00:49:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	I want to have for example a line that has only "LINUX" and another line with "WINDOWS"
2009-12-26T00:50:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	I dont need all the fuss about 2.6.***... appearing
2009-12-26T00:51:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	the fuss over kernel versions is there so you can tell apart which kernel you're starting. kernel updates sometimes patch nasty bugs, and sometimes introduce regressions.
2009-12-26T00:52:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	would you want to remove all the single-user mode boot menu items too?
2009-12-26T00:53:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	I know but for a family friendly computer those need to be hidden, the children can hardly sleep by those kernel versions
2009-12-26T00:53:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	oh i see
2009-12-26T00:53:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	yes ofcourse, as well as that useless memtest thing
2009-12-26T00:55:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	you can strip down your boot menu, but afaik that would mean you'd have to boot manually at the grub2 cmd prompt if something went haywire and you needed to start in maintenance mode; is that ok?
2009-12-26T00:57:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	that is NOT ok. So, in simple English, there is no way to customise the entries on the GRUB2 boot loader menu?
2009-12-26T00:58:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	yes you can customize, but it's a process one doesn't undertake so lightly
2009-12-26T01:01:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	I rest my case. adalal, you are right. there is no straightforward way to edit the entries
2009-12-26T01:02:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	that would beg the question of what one considers as straightforward, within the field of configuring things on Unix-like systems in general
2009-12-26T01:03:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	ok I withdraw my statement about straightforwardness, but IT CANNOT BE DONE!!
2009-12-26T01:06:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	something could be done, but it might not suit your wishes for ease of use, maintainability and so forth
2009-12-26T01:07:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	that file begs you with capital letters that you should not attempt editing it
2009-12-26T01:07:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	I know, but nothing is done yet
2009-12-26T01:08:00.000Z	adminewb1	mka	I think the caps are to scare off people who are not so well informed; it can be edited, I do it often; I just do it knowing it's at my own risk
2009-12-26T01:27:00.000Z	mka	adminewb1	elzoog, I remember another GUI that claimed to make things easy for GRUB legacy, it did more harm than good, GRUB2 needs to be friendly with or without a GUI frontend. As this is a critical part of the whole OS, there should not be any excuses about this. otherwise the installation process should always ask you to choose the grub version you want to use
