2010-01-26T10:03:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	can you repeat your question again, all in one line please
2010-01-26T10:04:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	one line
2010-01-26T10:04:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	that is a known issue, have you checked in the forum or launchpad?
2010-01-26T10:05:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	do you have karmic installed?
2010-01-26T10:06:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	go into a terminal and type lsb_release -a, let us know what you get for codename
2010-01-26T10:10:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	what sound card do you have? type this in a terminal: "aplay -l" then post the line that has "card 0" on it
2010-01-26T10:11:00.000Z	ZartantheKnife	mezquitale	 it says tihs
2010-01-26T10:12:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	i said only paste the line that has "card 0", I didnt need to see everything else
2010-01-26T10:15:00.000Z	ZartantheKnife	mezquitale	I posted it with that link to pastebin
2010-01-26T10:17:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	i was looking at the forums and couldnt find any post with your particular hardware, I suggest you file a bug in launchpad, what type of machine do you have is it a laptop?  There is a quick easy fix but is really not the right solution though, you can mute either headphones or speakers using gnome-alsamixer
2010-01-26T10:17:00.000Z	ZartantheKnife	mezquitale	it's an hp dv6
2010-01-26T10:20:00.000Z	mezquitale	ZartantheKnife	as someone else mentioned it, your particular machine has a switch that could be causing that problem
