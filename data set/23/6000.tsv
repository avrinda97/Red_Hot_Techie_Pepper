2006-07-07T05:57:00.000Z	morten_		I do understand this correctly ... ubuntu 64bit is unable to play DVD's with encryption - even with multiverse enabled, unless you set up a chroot or do something else extraordinary?
2006-07-07T05:57:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	I can play encripted DVDs on 64bit
2006-07-07T05:57:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	: How??
2006-07-07T05:57:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	I just can't freaking rip them cause for some reason Ubuntu takes it's sweet freaking time to rip
2006-07-07T05:58:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	are you trying to use totem?
2006-07-07T05:58:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	totem, gstreamer, mplayer, xine .. you name it ..
2006-07-07T05:59:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	I can play encripted DVDs in xine... I don't know what your issue is
2006-07-07T06:00:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	are you 64bit ?
2006-07-07T06:00:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	last time I checked my AMD64 3200+ was 64bit.
2006-07-07T06:00:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	yeah .. but you can run 32bit on a 64bit system, if you like. ...
2006-07-07T06:01:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	I run 64bit Ubuntu, I have a 32bit chroot for every freaking 32bit app, it's #@$%ing annoying
2006-07-07T06:01:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	Thats what I feared ..
2006-07-07T06:01:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	I consider going 32bit for now ...
2006-07-07T06:02:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	cause the stupid RIAS and MPAA says it's illegal...
2006-07-07T06:04:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	Oh .. so its only illegal in the US?
2006-07-07T06:04:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	I don't know, and I don't give a flying #$%^...
2006-07-07T06:05:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	yea, why don't you do what the PLF is doing?
2006-07-07T06:05:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	morten_	whoops. sorry, wrong person
2006-07-07T06:05:00.000Z	morten_	Snow_Shelter	plf?
