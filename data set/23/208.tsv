2012-03-27T21:07:00.000Z	It_2927		you don't have too :)
2012-03-27T21:07:00.000Z	It_2927		just use Xubuntu or Lubuntu?
2012-03-27T21:08:00.000Z	It_2927		its just ubuntu with a different desktop enviroment..
2012-03-27T21:09:00.000Z	It_2927		making the swap partition smaller.
2012-03-27T21:10:00.000Z	It_2927		if it really is so old
2012-03-27T21:11:00.000Z	It_2927		Maybe Lubuntu is for you.
2012-03-27T21:13:00.000Z	It_2927		can linux be actually installed to a usb stick
2012-03-27T21:13:00.000Z	It_2927		?
2012-03-27T21:14:00.000Z	It_2927		how so...
2012-03-27T21:14:00.000Z	It_2927		Lol! i understand you can install it from them
2012-03-27T21:14:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	you would select it has your hard-disk during installation
2012-03-27T21:14:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	it does indeed
2012-03-27T21:15:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	you can even use a portable h/d if you would like
2012-03-27T21:15:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	limiting factor btw, is that the machine you plug it into has to support boot from usb
2012-03-27T21:18:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	you should use a usb hub and softraid them then install linux
2012-03-27T21:18:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	now that would be hot
2012-03-27T21:20:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	now your talking. get more into it and you can ask more questions
2012-03-27T21:23:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	mdmadm is the software raid configuration tool used by linux... but I cannot get ubotu to tell me anything about it.
2012-03-27T21:27:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	if you have 5 usb's I would suggest checking out raidz very nice option.
2012-03-27T21:27:00.000Z	It_2927	tyler_d	I will look further into this "raid"
2012-03-27T21:28:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	raid = good clean fun
2012-03-27T21:30:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	dual booting is normally something I personally avoid, but if you get windows on first then sure; don't see why not, but you cannot use the raid then right.
2012-03-27T21:36:00.000Z	tyler_d	It_2927	I think you have about 2 weeks of reading... and more if you want to get into what is faster :)
