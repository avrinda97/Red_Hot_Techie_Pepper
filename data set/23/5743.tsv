2006-10-14T12:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		I've got a question, did dual-boot Ubuntu over an XP Media Center install, used the Ubuntu partition resize in install and now XP won't boot, the std grub entry doesn't work, GRUB doesn't recognize the filesystem type
2006-10-14T12:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		I can mount the XP partition and read all the files no problem, so it's still there
2006-10-14T12:53:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst

2006-10-14T12:54:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	sda3 is Ubuntu
2006-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	you have both media centre and regular XP? xD Why?
2006-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	I assume that's not your whole list?
2006-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	what would happen if you changed "rootnoverify" to "root"?
2006-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	I've done plain root, I've also done a hide statement for each, with no luck
2006-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	I've done a hide and then set root from the grub> prompt too
2006-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	and what does it tell you when you try to boot like that, again?
2006-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	fwiw, I'm not that new to this, and have several other Ubuntu dual boot boxes I've done from the installer with XP Pro and they work
2006-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	I get 0x7 unknown operating system
2006-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	ah. Then I don't know. My old computer absolutely refused to let grub boot windows. It totally screwed up. I had to use PartitionMagic's boot loader. But this one is fine with the same settings.
2006-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	yeah I suspect that the parted corrupted the boot block somehow
2006-11-18T10:13:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	won't it work to just ln -s /usr/lib/...whatever.../mplayerplugin-in* ~/.mozilla/plugins ?
2006-11-18T10:13:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	dunno, my command will do it for sure
2006-11-18T10:13:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	yes it will. Just tested it.
2006-11-18T10:14:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	mine is easy too ;-) just have to be used to what it means
2006-11-18T10:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	you used one!!!!
2006-11-18T10:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Kingsqueak	I took YOUR OWN wildcard, and took it out of a loop! That's it!
2006-11-18T10:18:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ArrenLex	inneresting it works on Solaris too heh, just never thought that would work for some reason
