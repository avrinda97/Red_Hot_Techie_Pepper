2010-02-11T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		trek: in /etc i wouldnt go playing with it as you may lose sudo ability in the installed system and need to use live cd to roll back. make a backup copy of the current one
2010-02-11T00:41:00.000Z	Trek	ActionParsnip	I've got working backups of the sudoers file, i'm messing with only one line: adding insult capabilities and making it ask for the pasword every time
