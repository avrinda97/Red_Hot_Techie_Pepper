2006-12-29T10:44:00.000Z	meng		<joth> I only have one partition at the moment, which I can't change the size of while it's mounted. -->gparted live cd?
2006-12-29T10:44:00.000Z	meng		<kbg_20> meng,  but joth will still lose data right? --> safer method is using a proprietary tool
2006-12-29T10:45:00.000Z	meng		esp with NTFS is concerned
2006-12-29T10:46:00.000Z	meng		<kbg_20> meng, exactly.. with gparted/fdisk resizing WILL involve losing data right? --> kinda forgot parted use anyway, i've been using Partition Magic instead
2006-12-29T10:47:00.000Z	meng		Blissex> kbg_20: 'parted' and 'gparted' will try to shrink the filesystem before shrinking the partition, but that is a bit tricky. --> start praying if ya do?
2006-12-29T10:49:00.000Z	meng		<Henry|> where the bar bounces to the left and the right --> are you on a high?
2006-12-29T10:50:00.000Z	meng		<siv0x> Can someone tell me the alsa or amixer command to set my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS to my default sound card? --> disable offending card in BIOS
