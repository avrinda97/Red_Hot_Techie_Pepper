2007-02-16T11:42:00.000Z	sean13		I can get it through other ways but I would like to get it in Device Manager
2007-02-16T11:44:00.000Z	dabaR	sean13	see whether any of the options listed at hal-device-manager --help helps.
2007-02-16T11:36:00.000Z	dabaR	sean13	lshw or a gui inside the menus on the top of the screen.
2007-02-16T11:37:00.000Z	sean13	dabaR	Do you know if their is any way to get the Device Manager to show more information about my system?
2007-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	dabaR	sean13	q~what about the advanced tab in there?
2007-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	sean13	dabaR	no that doesn't help, i'm looking more specifically for the name and model number of my hardware
2007-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	sean13	dabaR	thanks i'll give it ago
2007-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	dabaR	sean13	probably not, I just read through the options.
2007-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	sean13	dabaR	I don't suppose you can help me with another problem? when I put in a dvd disk containing mp3 albums Ubuntu wont let me browse it.  When I click it I get took straight to the cd/dvd burning program that comes with Ubuntu
2007-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	dabaR	sean13	the dvd is empty, it seems, double check it elsewhere
2007-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	sean13	dabaR	the DVD is definitely not empty, i've checked it on a windows machine
2007-02-16T11:53:00.000Z	dabaR	sean13	run mount in a termina, and pastebin it.
2007-02-16T12:02:00.000Z	dabaR	sean13	run mount in a termina, and pastebin it.
