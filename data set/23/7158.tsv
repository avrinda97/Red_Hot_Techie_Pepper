2006-10-01T09:28:00.000Z	SpudDogg		Can someone tell me how to read partitions on my HD?  I have another Linux distro installed on my hda2, but I need to read it from Ubuntu.  Is this possible?
2006-10-01T09:29:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	you just have to mount them on an empty directory. then you can go into that partition just like another directory. read about "mount" and see your /etc/fstab file
2006-10-01T09:30:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	is the mounting part done from in Ubuntu?  See I need to read the /boot directory from my Back|Track install so I can make grub recognize it as a bootable OS
2006-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	if you need grub to scan your disk to see another bootable partition, that's a different issue. if you just wanna mount it and use it for read/write while you're running ubuntu, you use "mount" and/or put it in your fstab
2006-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	not sure offhand how to have grub rescan for other OS's
2006-10-01T09:34:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	If you go to /boot/grub/menu.lst you will see all the items that are in the grub menu.  I am trying to put the boot info for Back|Track in there, but I cannot figure out what I need to put in there.  What I was hoping to do was to read Back|Track's /boot folder.  Do you happen to know an easier way?
2006-10-01T09:37:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	oh, i see. well, hda is 0, first partition is 0 and they go up from there. the other values you should be able to figure out from how it's getting your current boot settings (the kernel and initrd lines)
2006-10-01T09:38:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	Ubuntu is installed on hda1, B|T on hda2, and my swap is hda4.
2006-10-01T09:38:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	so the only tricky part is getting the disk/partition right where your other boot partition is located
2006-10-01T09:38:00.000Z	mister_roboto		hd(1,1)
2006-10-01T09:39:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	sorry, hd(0,1)
2006-10-01T09:39:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	so to boot into B|T, i should put hd(0,2)?
2006-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	 if it's hda2, that is hd(0,1)
2006-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	hda1 is hd(0,0
2006-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	yea, ok i got that.  now how do i find the kernel and initrd lines?
2006-10-01T09:41:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	you just need to point it at the right vmlinuz file and initrd.img file. use whatever is the latest version from the /boot directory
2006-10-01T09:41:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	actually, im just going to try to boot into b|T now.  Thanks for the help man!  I have a feeling I'll be right back :)
2006-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	you still here?
2006-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto		yes
2006-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	yes i'm still here
2006-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mister_roboto	i think i have this figured out now
2006-10-01T09:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	SpudDogg	ok, good :)
