2011-10-09T00:54:00.000Z	javier_		banzhang: how to upgrade to 11.10?
2011-10-09T00:55:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	same for you
2012-02-08T04:39:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	memtest
2012-02-08T04:40:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	should be part of any ubuntu-live-cd. start the cd and choose memtet
2012-02-08T04:44:00.000Z	javier_	iceroot	can I run memtest from normal installed ubuntu?
2012-02-08T04:45:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	imo yes but the results are not the same
2012-02-08T04:45:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	because the system is already running and some of the ram is used
2012-02-08T04:46:00.000Z	javier_	iceroot	so, i should restart and run from livecd, and run the program. If you can asses me a bit about what will I find and what to do before I run it, it will be a big help
2012-02-08T04:47:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	normally the ubuntu-cd will start and will offer you "install, live-system, memtest"
2012-02-08T04:47:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	but i started my last ubuntu cd years ago so i am not sure if we still have the memtest on it
2012-02-08T04:48:00.000Z	javier_	iceroot	i don't think you get that option just booting it, only options to try and install ubuntu. Don't know if i would have to run the program from terminal after booting in "try ubuntu" option
2012-02-08T04:50:00.000Z	javier_	iceroot	and will that program fix the problem it there is? or just detect it?
2012-02-08T04:50:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	just detect
2012-02-08T04:50:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	i know that "systemrescue disc" has this very usefull tool at start
2012-02-08T04:51:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	its always a good idea to run a memtest from a boot-cd to see if the hardware is fine
2012-02-08T04:51:00.000Z	javier_	iceroot	but I guess i can boot ubuntu cd and install the program there
2012-02-08T04:51:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	but then memtest cant reach the whole memory
2012-02-08T04:51:00.000Z	javier_	iceroot	memtest will test just ram memory, won't it?
2012-02-08T04:51:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	because of that you use memtest directly from the cd
2012-02-08T04:51:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	correct
2012-02-08T04:52:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	and some cpu-errors will also be visible (e.g. overclocking issues)
2012-02-08T04:52:00.000Z	javier_	iceroot	but I meant installing memtest in ubuntu live USB, which is very practical for this kind of things
2012-02-08T04:53:00.000Z	iceroot	javier_	normally memtest should be in the ubuntu-isos
