2005-12-24T11:56:00.000Z	tukuyomi	dpupp	are you sure about the 1:10:0?
2005-12-24T12:00:00.000Z	dpupp	tukuyomi	im not 100% positive of anything. but, what i did was, booted with that card being the only card... and i took the number that was in the xorg.conf that was working at that time.
2005-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	tukuyomi	dpupp	what is your problem exactely?
2005-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	dpupp	tukuyomi	i have 2 vid cards. 1 is dual head. that one is working fine with two monitors. I installed a 2nd card and attached a third monito.  that monitor is coming back black. however, when i boot the machine, that monitor is showing system status..... untill it hits the gdm. . then the other two monitors take over, and the third monitor shuts off.
2005-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	tukuyomi	dpupp	forget about your problem, i've the thread before my eyes ^_^
2005-12-24T12:03:00.000Z	dpupp		being new to linux, its quite frustrating to get it going smoothly because i dont know many of the terms or tricks to recover a failed system... i have reinstalled already 3 times already.
