2012-05-24T00:02:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	is it a new install?
2012-05-24T00:03:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	di you just install it or was it there before you touch it
2012-05-24T00:05:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	ok when you installed it it ask to ? one is download updates on install and install restricted extra. did you check these?
2012-05-24T00:06:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	sorry read that wrong
2012-05-24T00:07:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	can you back up there stuff and reinstall it connected to the internet. and make sure those boxes are check
2012-05-24T00:08:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	the install takes about 15 min, and if the boxes are check there internet will work after it done
2012-05-24T00:10:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	sure
2012-05-24T00:11:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	how good are at the command line?
2012-05-24T00:13:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	if you are ok you can do it from the term very ez if not you will have to login as both of them and copy the home separately
2012-05-24T00:15:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	sudo cp -R /home/ /mnt/usb device     but if you are unsure do it through the gui far safer
2012-05-24T00:15:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	sorry sudo cp -R /home/ /media/usb device
2012-05-24T00:19:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	so after the install create both user install any application they had installed than copy the stuff back reboot and it will be back as it was before with wireless internet
2012-05-24T00:21:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	you are at the terminal right? then sudo cp -ra /home  /media/usb drive < I do not know what it called so hit tab and it will show you the name
2012-05-24T00:29:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	harris	the whole home folder setting documents but not apps
