2009-09-15T10:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	have you installed cups?
2009-09-15T10:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	this may be useful:"
2009-09-15T10:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	try sudo invoke-rc.d cupsys restart
2009-09-15T10:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	is cupsys installed?
2009-09-15T10:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	what about cups?
2009-09-15T10:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	the initscript may have changed between my version and yours
2009-09-15T10:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	If I remember correctly, signal 15 is a segmentation fault
2009-09-15T10:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	you may need to generate ssl certificates for it
2009-09-15T11:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	the error message that you posted earlier referrs to a missing ssl cert
2009-09-15T11:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	you may be able to configure cups to not use ssl
2009-09-15T11:10:00.000Z	owner_	lstarnes	how would I configure cups to work without ssl?
2009-09-15T11:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	I honestly don't know, sorry
2009-09-15T11:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	owner_	it's probably somewhere in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
