2007-09-04T07:50:00.000Z	whonicca		anyone know why a video card would work on one computer and not another, both support agp 2x/4x
2007-09-04T07:52:00.000Z	whonicca		but on the p3 computer i just have a black screen
2007-09-04T07:53:00.000Z	whonicca		its a nvidia 57000 le
2007-09-04T07:53:00.000Z	whonicca		trying to install it for a better ubuntu experience =)
2007-09-04T07:54:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	did you switch the bios to use agp instead of onbaord (older mobos do not automatically switch it for you)
2007-09-04T07:55:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	it doesnt have an onboard video, im currently using an older agp video card on it
2007-09-04T07:55:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	when does the black screen kick in? right from power on or from when ubuntu starts loading?
2007-09-04T07:56:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	funny thing u say that cause i am also having a problem with the older agp card that works, when ubuntu starts up i get a black screen all the way until the login screen loads up
2007-09-04T07:56:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	but with the newer video card its as soon as i power up the machine and i dont get any video at all
2007-09-04T07:57:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	if it fails when the login screen loads up then it is to do with the driver selected in xorg.conf
2007-09-04T07:58:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	ahhhh, i see, now that is weird...........would be a framebuffer issue yes, but i'm surprised if any card doesnt natively support framebuffer, so sounds more like a hardware issue
2007-09-04T07:58:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	i can see grub, but after that i dont see the splash screen with the orange block in the bar going from side to side
2007-09-04T07:58:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	yeah i think its a crappy card, thats why i want to get this extra nvidia one i have laying around working on it
2007-09-04T07:59:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	so what is the model of the one you want working?
2007-09-04T08:00:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	nvidia geforce fx 5700 le 128mb ddr
2007-09-04T08:01:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	that should be a perfectly fine card on ubuntu..........so.........with that card, you power on, you see grub.....then black screen.....then login screen appears? can you log into gnome?
2007-09-04T08:02:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	no, with this card i dont get any video at all, from power on
2007-09-04T08:02:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	meanwhile i can plug it in another computer and it works
2007-09-04T08:02:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	and you say it works in another pc?
2007-09-04T08:03:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	yes works on another pc
2007-09-04T08:03:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	i have no idea to be honest in that case. i suggest maybe checking your bios settings
2007-09-04T08:03:00.000Z	whonicca	renzo17	yeah ill give it another look, only way to do so though is with the older video card plugged in
2007-09-04T08:04:00.000Z	renzo17	whonicca	lol, must be tedious
