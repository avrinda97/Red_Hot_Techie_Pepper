2006-01-02T06:37:00.000Z	john_		so it needs the username and password in there
2006-01-02T06:38:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	...,username=<uname>, password=<pword>
2006-01-02T06:39:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	so does that go in at any place in the line?
2006-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	<share> <mountpoint> smbfs rw,username=<uname>,password=<pword>
2006-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	can I put that anywhere in the line or at the end?
2006-01-02T06:41:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	"man smbmount" will give you more info
2006-01-02T06:53:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	sudo mount -a -t smbfs
2006-01-02T06:53:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	thanks for all your help, got everything working how I wanted. Thou art lord!
2006-01-02T06:54:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	hey dude you're the man, you did all the work, i just typed in a few funny words
2006-01-02T06:55:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	do you know how I can create a sweet link on the desktop to the mounts I just created?
2006-01-02T06:55:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	mount them under /media and they will automagically appear there and in the gnome-panel
2006-01-02T06:56:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	rightous :)
2006-01-02T06:58:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	ok Im being silly again, what command should I use to mount the mounts as media?
2006-01-02T07:01:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	it says it could not resolve mount point
2006-01-02T07:01:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	which command?
2006-01-02T07:02:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	how do you mean?
2006-01-02T07:07:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	yes but  in fstab
2006-01-02T07:08:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	then mkdir /media/sharename
2006-01-02T07:10:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	sorted man :)
2006-01-02T07:10:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	so is it possible to mount an ftp site?
2006-01-02T07:11:00.000Z	john_	Sepheebear	or at least to have a link to mount one?
2006-01-02T07:11:00.000Z	Sepheebear	john_	sure you'd have to use gnome-vfs to mount ftp
