2009-12-14T19:57:00.000Z	przemo_one	zamba	and vga? graphic card
2009-12-14T19:58:00.000Z	zamba	przemo_one	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82865G Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)
2009-12-14T20:00:00.000Z	przemo_one	zamba	here's your problem. you have some integrated graphic card. it's poor. what you need to do is check your bios settings for how much memory it have. give moreand then give a try. get better vga, because flash takes loads of vga and cpu power, so you're not the only one with this problem.
2009-12-14T20:01:00.000Z	przemo_one	zamba	there is temp solution. every file which is playd by flash is in /tmp. you can go on youtube, pouse, and open the file with totem. i do that with hd streams.
2009-12-14T20:02:00.000Z	przemo_one	zamba	pause* :)
2009-12-14T20:02:00.000Z	zamba	przemo_one	ok. i'll try that as well
