2010-12-17T12:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	I thought gparted was installed as default and normaly found at System>admin>gparted,  also I found the utilty from the command line sudo blkid will list all uuid on your system
2010-12-17T12:27:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	i tried blkifd from the CLI like suggested in fstab but could not get the uuid? what did you type exactly?
2010-12-17T12:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	example sudo blkid /dev/sda1
2010-12-17T12:30:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	fstab suggested something with more options. thanx
2010-12-17T12:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	yes the line you put in fstab has many options
2010-12-17T12:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	I think sudo mount -a
2010-12-17T12:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	oh if it's root then I would reboot
2010-12-17T12:36:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	bullgard4: ok. thanx for your help
2010-12-24T15:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	I'm not sure why but I need to ctl + alt + f8 to get back to gui
2010-12-24T15:16:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	ok. sorry i dont remember. maybe its f8
2010-12-24T15:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	it could be dependent on graphic drivers?  I use nvidia propriatary
2010-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	and linuxng should not allow port scanning
2010-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	l*inuxg
2010-12-24T17:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	how can you prevent someone from port scanning you ?
2010-12-24T17:12:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	if you get too many icmp (or whatever) packets on all your ports, then someone is doing a port scan. i don't know but may be iptables can be set to detect and then block all for that IP
2010-12-24T17:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	you can't stop someone from port scanning you,  but you can move services to none standard ports so they don't know what protocal to use to attack/breakin to it
2010-12-24T17:15:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	i don't remember this but i had read about something like this for my System Security class. :)
2010-12-24T17:17:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	ok
2010-12-25T11:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	 I beleave they have exited the chat
2010-12-25T11:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	rigved	I've had other people say the same thing,  when I log out and in it seems to fix that
2010-12-25T11:35:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	also, i cannot see you in my user list
2010-12-25T20:58:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	random_ubuntuer: also, others (like me) also like to find out what you have been able to accomplish.
2010-12-25T20:59:00.000Z	rigved	sacarlson	btw, tab now works with your name :P
