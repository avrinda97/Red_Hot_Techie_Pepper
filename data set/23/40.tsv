2012-10-07T15:10:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		uBUXUBu:playonlinux can make life easier installing many known games on ubuntu
2012-10-07T15:11:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	ArcaneWater	try installing win7 first, then from there create new partition for ubuntu, then install ubuntu next to win7
2012-10-07T15:12:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	lotuspsychje	huh there is no other way to fix thath? I already have second partition...
2012-10-07T15:12:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		ArcaneWater:cant you boot ubuntu next to win7?
2012-10-07T15:13:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	lotuspsychje	i can boot from usb and proceed with install, when there should be install them by side it says thath there were no os detected...
2012-10-07T15:14:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		ArcaneWater:so when trying to install ubuntu, it doesnt show win7?
2012-10-07T15:15:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	ArcaneWater	os you mean win7 got corrupted to proper boot?
2012-10-07T15:16:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	lotuspsychje	i already have win7 yes i am using it right now, for dual boot it says thath it will autmaticaly detected win7 and it will give you option Install them by side. But at my installation does not detect w7, but i can still normaly use w7
2012-10-07T15:17:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		ArcaneWater:ok that was clear now
2012-10-07T15:19:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		ArcaneWater:look at this url http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/05/17/how-to-dual-boot-ubuntu-12-04-and-windows-7/ and look at the 'something else' partitioning
2012-10-07T15:21:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		brb
2012-10-07T15:21:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	lotuspsychje	hmm yes i was already thinking about thath to install them seperated, but still strange thath it does not gives me option to install them by side..
