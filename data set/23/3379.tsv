2008-11-30T20:56:00.000Z	SpaceCow567		Anyone: Is there a fix for the sound in Intrepid Ibex yet? I've looked on the internet and some say it's  an out-of-date Alsamixer. Is this true?
2008-11-30T20:57:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	this place doesnt hand hold you
2008-11-30T20:58:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	I had the same problem and it had to do with me having 2 sound cards. my onboard and a audigy2 board
2008-11-30T21:02:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	what I had to end up doing, was set in System -> Prefs -> Sound was 'OSS Sound System' to get my flash to work
2008-11-30T21:02:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Okay, I'll try
2008-11-30T21:03:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Which one do I set to OSS Sound System?
2008-11-30T21:04:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	the top 2, especially the Movies/Music selection
2008-11-30T21:05:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	oh ok
2008-11-30T21:05:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Yes, I've had it on my system
2008-11-30T21:06:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	I had a bugger of a time getting it the sound to work but I finally got it to work
2008-11-30T21:07:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Okay, I took your guys recommendations, let me test
2008-11-30T21:10:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Changing the top 2 settings in sound to Open Sound System didn't help
2008-11-30T21:11:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	did you make sure firefox was dead?
2008-11-30T21:11:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Yes, I restarted firefox
2008-11-30T21:11:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Although, there are about 4 different types of OSS in my sound preferences
2008-11-30T21:12:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	Ok. I think this is beyond me man. I got it to work but I had to do alot to get it
2008-11-30T21:14:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Okay, I'll keep messing with it. That's what my brother always told me to do in Linux, lol
2008-11-30T21:14:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	yeah I wish that it came pre-loaded and ready to go as a far as flash I think that is what keeps alot of users from making the 'switch'
2008-11-30T21:15:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Haha, unforunately I still have to a bit since I need CAD programs that only work on windows
2008-11-30T21:16:00.000Z	MrCollins	SpaceCow567	you cant run CAD in VirtualBox?
2008-11-30T21:16:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	what's virtual box?
2008-11-30T21:17:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Thank you, I'll look into that
2008-12-01T22:57:00.000Z	SpaceCow567	MrCollins	Hey it's me again
