2012-01-08T20:44:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	There is no 10.11
2012-01-08T20:45:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	The newest is 11.10
2012-01-08T20:45:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	It goes by year / month.
2012-01-08T20:45:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	11 for the year, 10 for the month.
2012-01-08T20:45:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	next is 12.04, then 12.10, then 13.04, then 13.10 ... etc. Get it?
2012-01-08T20:46:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	I haven't read your question. There is Unity per default since 11.04
2012-01-08T20:47:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	You could install gnome3 (gnome-shell or gnome-session-fallback), use cinnamon (by mint) or choose to use KDE or XFCE (amongst many others)
2012-01-08T20:47:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	gnome-session-fallback still looks a lot like gnome 2.
2012-01-08T20:48:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	I suggest you stay on 10.04 though. It's supported for quite some time.
2012-01-08T20:48:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	10.04 is an LTS. Are you familiar with the meaning of LTS?
2012-01-08T20:49:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	They are supported for a longer period of time.
2012-01-08T20:50:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	What's the other question?
2012-01-08T20:51:00.000Z	kyentei	askmasterrr	Forbid you to use it? It comes default. They pretty much _want_ you to use it.
