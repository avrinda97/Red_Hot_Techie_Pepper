2009-08-18T09:56:00.000Z	Dac-iPhone		I will do anything if someone could help me simply boot into my computer.
2009-08-18T09:58:00.000Z	Dac-iPhone		Here's my problem: after I installed recommended ubuntu automatic updates, it completely effed up grub and now I can boot into ubuntu or windows. It was handling two partitions on the same drive, dual-booting. I desperately need to simply be able to boot into my computer.
2009-08-18T09:59:00.000Z	Dac-iPhone		I've edited my menu.lst file in grub to theoretically allow me to boot into windows, but it gave me an error when I tried that.
2009-08-18T10:00:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	You probably botched your menu.lst. pastebin it
2009-08-18T10:00:00.000Z	Dac-iPhone	majuk	Give me one sec. Logging on to livecd
2009-08-18T10:00:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	And what error would be useful as well.
2009-08-18T10:56:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	What was the error? The same thing?
2009-08-18T11:14:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	It should fix both. Because if your menu.lst has Ubuntu booting from hd(0,1) which.
2009-08-18T11:15:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	Yea you did. :D
2009-08-18T11:15:00.000Z	Dac-iPhone	majuk	Theres nothing in my menu.lst for ubuntu though. Windows is now my only option.
2009-08-18T11:15:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	Right, because you commented it out. Look right below the Windows boot entry (if you can)
2009-08-18T11:16:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	Fine, the system did, either way.
2009-08-18T11:16:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	It is currently commented out, so uncomment it, change the root assignement on the Ubuntu entry and you should be set.
2009-08-18T11:21:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	/dev/S<-------da2
2009-08-18T11:22:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	I don't even have /dev/hda2
2009-08-18T11:22:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	Well, I mean, try it.
2009-08-18T11:23:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	And if it doesn't work, we can figure out why.
2009-08-18T11:32:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	hd(0,1), smart stuff
2009-08-18T11:56:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	You don't wipe with penguin-friendly TP

2009-08-18T12:06:00.000Z	majuk	Dac-iPhone	You can use root hd(#,#) in place of that UUID stuff
