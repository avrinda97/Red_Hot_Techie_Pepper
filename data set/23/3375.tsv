2008-05-03T23:10:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	a useless media player
2008-05-03T23:14:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	don't get it, you're better off buying a new computer, AGP is dead
2008-05-03T23:14:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	im a poor college kid :(
2008-05-03T23:14:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	and you're trying to game? what?
2008-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	no i wasn't, it was for maya and 3d studio max.
2008-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	... on an FX5200? Premission to laugh...
2008-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	? i never owned a fx5200
2008-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	ah, ok, well don't get one
2008-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	they're.... underpowered and over prced
2008-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	someone wanted to sell me one
2008-05-03T23:16:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	i meant i was using my ati radeon x1950 pro with maya
2008-05-03T23:16:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	ah, ok
2008-05-03T23:16:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	and it was sexy because of the dual dvi and hd support
2008-05-03T23:17:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	I'm assuming this is all AGP
2008-05-03T23:17:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	agp 8x
2008-05-03T23:17:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	yeah, AGP8X is really pricy, and not really worth it
2008-05-03T23:18:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	it's all i could get though, agp_8x or pci... my motherboard is a little dated.
2008-05-03T23:18:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	what socket?
2008-05-03T23:18:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	not quite sure what that means
2008-05-03T23:19:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	like what processor does it take?
2008-05-03T23:19:00.000Z	damntourists	Ice_Wewe	it's a pentium 4
2008-05-03T23:19:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	damntourists	yes, what pin count
