2010-01-15T02:07:00.000Z	brokendisk		when i run ddrescue to rescue my disk it starts working, updates some numbers like access rate but stops updating after 20 seconds and the disk makes scratchy noises again for like 30 seconds, then it is silent and nothing happens for hours
2010-01-15T02:07:00.000Z	brokendisk		what can i do?
2010-01-15T02:07:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	sounds like a HW problem, probably fried HDD
2010-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	yes but ddrescue shuold rescue exactly that
2010-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	no, not really :)
2010-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	it should just jump over fried sectors
2010-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	it says so in the doc
2010-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	not if the HDD is physically damaaged
2010-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	yes exactly for physically damaged disks it is meant
2010-01-15T02:09:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	thats the entire idea of ddrescue
2010-01-15T02:09:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	call me a naysayer if you wish, but I think you put too much faith into that :)
2010-01-15T02:09:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	did you ever read the ddrescue doc? http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html
2010-01-15T02:10:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	yes it can rescue parts of it, thats what ddrescue is meant for.
2010-01-15T02:10:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	a HDD is a mechanical device, if there is something mechanically wrong with it, its dead, unless you ship it off to some fancy HDD rescue shop who will take it apart and fix it for you manually
2010-01-15T02:10:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	not correct
2010-01-15T02:11:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	there are many different hardware errors, most partially fixable
2010-01-15T02:11:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	no, it usually means head failure and bad sectors, which ddrescue is meant for to deal with
2010-01-15T02:11:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	okay, well why dont you just use it then? :)
2010-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	the problem is it stops working after some time
2010-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	maybe because it cant read from the disk AT ALL?
2010-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	it can read from the disk, it works for 20 seconds
2010-01-15T02:15:00.000Z	MorphyNOR	brokendisk	do that then...
2010-01-15T02:16:00.000Z	brokendisk	MorphyNOR	no thats the last resort and only necessary if the device is not recognized by the bios due to sticking heads
