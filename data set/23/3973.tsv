2010-05-10T08:33:00.000Z	te_	Durf	Sounds like you may have it mounted ro instead of rw.
2010-05-10T08:33:00.000Z	te_	Durf	You could create a fstab entry for it.
2010-05-10T08:33:00.000Z	Durf	te_	how?
2010-05-10T08:34:00.000Z	te_	Durf	Would first have to see what the device is and what partition you have created.
2010-05-10T08:35:00.000Z	te_	Durf	 pastebin the results of fdisk -l
2010-05-10T08:35:00.000Z	te_	Durf	sudo fdisk -l
2010-05-10T08:36:00.000Z	te_	Durf	How do you have it mounted now? mount
2010-05-10T08:37:00.000Z	te_	Durf	mount | pastebinit

2010-05-10T08:41:00.000Z	Durf		actually te_ I just want to increase space on my current partition
2010-05-10T08:41:00.000Z	Durf	te_	The partition I am using, but to edit it in gparted I need to unmount it, if I unmount the partition I am currently using what'll happen?
2010-05-10T08:42:00.000Z	te_	Durf	Nothing.
2010-05-10T08:43:00.000Z	te_	Durf	Oh the one you are currently using?  You can not umount it.
2010-05-10T08:43:00.000Z	Durf	te_	How do increase the size of my ubuntu partition then?
2010-05-10T08:44:00.000Z	Durf		kay
2010-05-10T08:44:00.000Z	te_	Durf	I think you need to tell us exactly what you want/need to do?
2010-05-10T08:45:00.000Z	Durf	te_	I wanna increase my ubuntu partition (I am currently using it right now) size without damaging it in any way
2010-05-10T08:45:00.000Z	te_	Durf	What size is / are our hard drives?
2010-05-10T08:47:00.000Z	te_	Durf	You may need to use a boot disk.   (Boot from CD)
2010-05-10T08:47:00.000Z	te_	Durf	And then you can resize the partition you are using now.
