2004-10-16T11:02:00.000Z	Nonphasis	LinuxJones	it ran a bit slowar than on dos, but my system was heavily loaded

2004-10-16T11:02:00.000Z	Nonphasis	LinuxJones	i'll try again when the load is down
2004-10-16T11:02:00.000Z	Nonphasis	LinuxJones	but, there is a demo for linux as well, so you can look before you leap
2004-10-16T11:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Nonphasis	I only have a GF2MX with 32 megs of ram and I don't thing that is enough
2004-10-16T11:03:00.000Z	Nonphasis	LinuxJones	yes, that isn't enough ;-)
2004-11-02T12:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Nonphasis	you probably have to enable anti-aliasing and adjust fonts in kdecontrol center
2004-11-02T13:00:00.000Z	Nonphasis	LinuxJones	yeah, probably, but at that point I was already uninstalling it. I thought I could get used to gnome, and i did
2004-11-02T13:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Nonphasis	I was a longtime KDE user until I installed Ubuntu and I would never switch back :)
2004-11-02T13:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Nonphasis	yes it is very good
