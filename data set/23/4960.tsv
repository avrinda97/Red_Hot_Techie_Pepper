2008-12-16T03:27:00.000Z	kristian_	raylu	: i will let you know, if i find out. do the same if your first. :-P
2008-12-16T03:28:00.000Z	raylu	kristian_	you'll likely be looking at a perl script
2008-12-16T03:29:00.000Z	kristian_	raylu	: maybe some playing with .irssi/config will do it, ill try and see if i can figure it out, have asked the same question in #irssi also, so will let you know, if i find anything.
2008-12-16T03:31:00.000Z	kristian_	raylu	: can you please type my nick in the middle of a sentence! :-P *testing testing*

2008-12-16T04:34:00.000Z	kristian_	raylu	: apparently! :)
2008-12-16T05:21:00.000Z	kristian_	raylu	: you should "/set hilight_nick_matches off" if your going to use "/hilight word". where word = nick! fyi! or there can be a conflict apparently!
2008-12-16T05:22:00.000Z	raylu	kristian_	conflict?
2008-12-16T05:22:00.000Z	raylu	kristian_	hilight_nick_matches tries to make my act bar yellow, hilight tries to make it red. hilight wins :D
2008-12-16T05:23:00.000Z	kristian_	raylu	: hilight ftw! ;-) anyways i was told to turn hilight_nick_matches off, if i was going to use hilight for my nick. according to #irssi people! just thought i'd let you know. :-)
