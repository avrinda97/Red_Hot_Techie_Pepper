2011-01-27T21:58:00.000Z	ChipCherou		how do I force a reinstall of libc6. It complains that its unable to locatio file for the libc6 package why I try  sudo aptitude --purge reinstall libc6
2011-01-27T21:58:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	reinstalling rarely fixes anything, why do you want to reinstall libc6?
2011-01-27T21:58:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	to try to fix this issue: Crashing under seperate vnc.  heres log of example: http://paste.ubuntu.com/559091/
2011-01-27T22:00:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	gksudo synaptic as root?  What on earth?
2011-01-27T22:01:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	force of habit
2011-01-27T22:01:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	terrible habit...
2011-01-27T22:12:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	why are you running it as root?  I don't even understand your setup.  You're running X as root?
2011-01-27T22:13:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	Ive been messing with this for hours and figured trying root accoutn etc may fix
2011-01-27T22:14:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	:/
2011-01-27T22:14:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	what else did you try before that?
2011-01-27T22:15:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	Xvnc4 Tightvnc both have same result
2011-01-27T22:15:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	changed my xstartup a few times to fix
2011-01-27T22:19:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	 If I change my xstartup to NOT have gnome-session &  then synaptic works fine  (basic x with grey background and 1 virtual terminal)
2011-01-27T22:19:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	is vnc attaching to your existing session or spawning a new one?
2011-01-27T22:19:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	spawning a new one
2011-01-27T22:20:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	the session that loads on the monitor does not have this issue
2011-01-27T22:20:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	isn't that a "no-no"?  Having two gnome-sessions fro the same user?
2011-01-27T22:20:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	but being a server that doesn't have a monitor...that doesn't help.  I have tried with different users
2011-01-27T22:21:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	 right now the monitor should be showing nothing but the gui login screen
2011-01-27T22:22:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	I was just saying when I am local and logged in it does not have an issue
2011-01-27T22:22:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	I see
2011-01-27T22:52:00.000Z	ChipCherou	jrib	just figured Id mentioned that I have given up on running gnome remotely and switched to xfce which does not appear to have problems.  Thanks for your assistance
2011-01-27T22:53:00.000Z	jrib	ChipCherou	use what works I guess :)
