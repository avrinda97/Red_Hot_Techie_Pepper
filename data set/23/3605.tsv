2008-09-07T17:52:00.000Z	mlLK		is there a command like uname for debian?
2008-09-07T17:52:00.000Z	mlLK		or ubuntu
2008-09-07T17:53:00.000Z	mlLK		which option gives distro info then
2008-09-07T17:53:00.000Z	mlLK		k
2008-09-07T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	none.  use lsb_release -a
2008-12-17T23:01:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	why do you want to?
2008-12-17T23:01:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	it's not included w/ apt
2008-12-17T23:01:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	what isn't?
2009-01-06T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	how would that help?  If the buttons are recognized, just use xbindkeys or imwheel to bind them
2009-01-06T06:32:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	which one is easier?
2009-01-06T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	xbindkeys is sort of universal, imwheel allows you to specify different binding for different programs.  Equal difficulty imo
2009-01-06T06:33:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	i'll give imwheel a shot
2009-01-06T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	what does firefox do exactly when you hit middle click?
2009-01-06T06:34:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	sometimes it'll take me back a page other times it'll redirect to a link somewhere in the page
2009-01-06T06:34:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	while all i want is my auto-scroll feature
2009-01-06T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	run 'xev' and see what button number middle click is generating.  What mouse?
2009-01-06T06:35:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	is there perhaps an app i'm missing for this feature?
2009-01-06T06:36:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	what sorta output am i looking for w/ xev?
2009-01-06T06:37:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	xev | grep -i button           will make it easier to spot
2009-01-06T06:39:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	it registers as button 2
2009-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	what ubuntu version?
2009-01-06T06:40:00.000Z	mlLK	jrib	all i wish for as an auto-scroll feature for firefox opposed to lame redirects
2009-01-06T06:41:00.000Z	jrib	mlLK	what is the value of middlemouse.contentLoadURL in about:config?
