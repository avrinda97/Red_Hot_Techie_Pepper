2007-07-28T10:04:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		Why does Ubuntu create .Trash files in external devices?
2007-07-28T10:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	that is nautilus... and they're folders not files
2007-07-28T10:05:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	I meant folders, sorry about that. Why does nautilus do that?
2007-07-28T10:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	whenever you delete a file using nautilus, it gets moved to .trash so that it can easily be restored
2007-07-28T10:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	once you remove it from .trash its gone forever
2007-07-28T10:05:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	Is there anyway to stop it from doing that on things like my iPod? Theres a .Trash folder filled with old songs that I deleted on my iPod and its really annoying.
2007-07-28T10:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	its all or nothing...d
2007-07-28T10:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	shift delete deletes for ever...
2007-07-28T10:06:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	Ok, thanks
2007-07-28T10:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	you can disable the whole lot from edit > preferences > behaviour
2007-07-28T11:21:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	I thought the intel drivers were restricted
2007-07-28T11:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	#ubuntu-offtopic and grr :)
2007-07-28T11:23:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	why did you direct me to offtopic? (just wondering)
2007-07-28T11:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	because this channel is for support, not chatter :)
2007-07-28T11:27:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	I was asking about something Ubuntu-related ;)
2007-07-28T11:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	but not support
2007-07-28T11:27:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	ok :)
2007-07-29T14:43:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	I have given shelia_ the official ubuntu documentation on frostwire
2007-07-29T14:43:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	ok then, didn't notice that was gonna send him to actual frostwire site which has a Ubuntu download on the main page
2007-07-29T14:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	that guide does the same, but has several "if you see this, fix it by..." things
2007-07-29T14:44:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	yeah, community docs are generally better, just didn't notice that you gave him the link :)
2007-07-29T14:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	d4rkmonkey	its all good :)
2007-09-22T15:46:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	PriceChild	I just did that ;)
