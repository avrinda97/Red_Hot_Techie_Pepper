2011-08-19T21:14:00.000Z	blognewb		hi everyone im trying to install ubuntu in my sister's computer, i want to know the system requirements for ubuntu 11 but can't find it help
2011-08-19T21:14:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	What process or and how much memory does it have?
2011-08-19T21:15:00.000Z	blognewb	usr13	piii :(
2011-08-19T21:15:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	How much memory?
2011-08-19T21:16:00.000Z	blognewb	usr13	Intel Pentium 4 1.8GHz / 256MB SDRAM / 40GB HDD
2011-08-19T21:17:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	Very low memory.  I recommend 3 or 4 times as much RAM.
2011-08-19T21:17:00.000Z	blognewb	usr13	so i guess i can't install ubuntu?
2011-08-19T21:17:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	The processor is fine, but you need to do RAM upgrade.  512 is minimum IMO, 1G is very good.
2011-08-19T21:18:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	Oh you can install it, but for good prefomance, I would put some more RAM in it.
2011-08-19T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	As you are advised above, xubuntu or Lubuntu will be better for the limited resources you have now, but if you do a memory upgrade, the standard Desktop edition will work too.  It's your choice.
2011-08-19T21:21:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	You mean you just want to use the whole drive?
2011-08-19T21:22:00.000Z	blognewb	usr13	yeah well i wanna clean everything before i install this
2011-08-19T21:22:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	Pretty cheap.  You can get 512MB pretty cheap nowdays.
2011-08-19T21:22:00.000Z	blognewb	usr13	what is cheap to you?
2011-08-19T21:22:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	The installer will do that for you.  Just run the install and it will wipe the whole drive if you want.

2011-08-19T21:26:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	Find the model# on the mother borad and do a search.  But you can safely assume it will take 512M or 1G modules.
2011-08-19T21:31:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	I don't have anything that slow, but almost.  I have a machine here that is only 2GHz, (AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2400+), and it runs nicely on 10.04 LTS.  (But it has 1G RAM).
2011-08-19T21:31:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	cpu MHz: 1994.357
2011-08-19T21:31:00.000Z	blognewb	usr13	i also have one like that but at the moment it's giving me ntfs corrupt messages, i dunno how to recover the files without formatting it
2011-08-19T21:32:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	You definately need to recover the files ASAP.
2011-08-19T21:33:00.000Z	blognewb	usr13	asap?
2011-08-19T21:33:00.000Z	usr13	blognewb	Probably looking at imminite hard drive failure
