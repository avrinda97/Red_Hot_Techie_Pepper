2009-12-06T18:47:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 if you still have mplayer installed open it up and right click the main window  go to Preferences
2009-12-06T18:47:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 ok  well we can set up mplayer now if you like
2009-12-06T18:48:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	also if you want the person you are talking to to be alerted simply type the first few letters of the name  and hit tab to get the correct nick   this way the text in the person's irc client should turn red or highlighted
2009-12-06T18:48:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 which did not install via synaptic?
2009-12-06T18:49:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 if you want more info on this stuff you can google   ubuntu restricted formats
2009-12-06T18:49:00.000Z	xvii69	coz_	yea for sure on the mplayer
2009-12-06T18:49:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 ok open that up and right click main window and go to preferences
2009-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	xvii69	coz_	k next
2009-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 go under the "Video" tab and choose   xv  X11/Xv
2009-12-06T18:50:00.000Z	xvii69	coz_	already done
2009-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 then under "Codecs & demuxer" tab for video codec family = FFmpeg's libavcodec codec family and for audio codec family =  MPEG layer-2, layer-3
2009-12-06T18:51:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	  close and then reopen mplayer for that to take effect
2009-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	xvii69	coz_	ok done
2009-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	  that should effectively allow mplayer to play dvd's
2009-12-06T18:52:00.000Z	xvii69	coz_	gives me error warning MVs no available
2009-12-06T18:53:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	 yeah you can ignore that  mplayer has been doing that for some time and I have not found the solution
2009-12-06T18:53:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	  it works here regardless of that error    maybe on an #mplayer channel the fix can be effected or maybe googling it
2009-12-06T18:54:00.000Z	xvii69	coz_	thanxs alot works now
2009-12-06T18:54:00.000Z	coz_	xvii69	  very cool :)
