2009-09-07T08:47:00.000Z	binarycortex		good evening
2009-09-07T08:47:00.000Z	binarycortex		i need some help
2009-09-07T08:47:00.000Z	binarycortex		i need to burn an iso from the live cd
2009-09-07T08:48:00.000Z	binarycortex		ubuntu wont let me eject the cd
2009-09-07T08:48:00.000Z	binarycortex		is there any way to boot from an iso on an ntfs partition
2009-09-07T08:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	"unmount" it...
2009-09-07T08:50:00.000Z	binarycortex	Scunizi	how would i unmount the cd if its being used as the hard drive
2009-09-07T08:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	why would you want to eject it if it's being used as the hard drive?
2009-09-07T08:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	to what purpose?
2009-09-07T08:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	if you've booted the live cd and want to put in the windows cd to run checkdisk .. it won't work anyway..
2009-09-07T08:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	that's a cunumdrum (sp?). you need the ubuntu cd in the drive to be able to burn but you need a blank in the drive to write to.. sounds like a second cd drive is in order unless someone else has a different solution
2009-09-07T08:55:00.000Z	binarycortex	Scunizi	its a laptop
2009-09-07T08:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	that doesn't change anything.
2009-09-07T08:55:00.000Z	binarycortex	Scunizi	is there a way to boot the live cd, and use a custom command to tell it to boot from an iso on the harddrive
2009-09-07T08:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	why do you need to run checkdisk?
2009-09-07T08:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	if you have enough room on your drive you could install ubuntu as a dual boot and take care of it that way.
2009-09-07T08:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	however in my experience, with a bsod in windows.. you most likely will have to do a full reinstall to fix it anyway..
2009-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	hahahaha.. but not without linux? Now that is funny!
2009-09-07T09:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	at least you have some humor about this.. :).. it's a tough situation.. you could create a usb boot of linux if you had usb and then make use of the cdrom
2009-09-07T09:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	you might be able to do a net boot of ubuntu and then have the cdrom available.. but that is beyond my experience.
2009-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	after creating a dual boot you might become a convert :)
2009-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	binarycortex	Scunizi	i already am, but this is a work computer
2009-09-07T09:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	binarycortex	good.. glad to hear you're not a "virgin" lixer
