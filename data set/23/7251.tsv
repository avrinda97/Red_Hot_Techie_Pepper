2007-09-29T12:38:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	That might just be your problem
2007-09-29T12:39:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	7.05 is not official ubuntu release afaik
2007-09-29T12:39:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	Get 7.04 from ubuntu.com, not ubuntu.pl
2007-09-29T12:41:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	7.04 should have the polish language in it.
2007-09-29T12:42:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	Well, allow me to suggest abiword instead of openoffice.
2007-09-29T12:42:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	What font errors are you talking about?
2007-09-29T12:44:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	Its easy!
2007-09-29T12:44:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	Press alt+f2 and type "gksudo synaptic"
2007-09-29T12:44:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	That program is meant to make installing packages easy
2007-09-29T12:45:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	Or it can be done from the console (sudo apt-get install abiword)
2007-09-29T12:46:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	Watch your language please.
2007-09-29T12:46:00.000Z	rukuartic	DeathMan|	Explain to me what the "font problems" are again
