2010-04-26T04:18:00.000Z	cviniciusm	rtty	use examples to help us to help you. For example, machine1 has ssh server and machine2 has ssh client. the command netstat -tlnp | grep -i ssh shows the sshd listening port and so on.
2010-04-26T04:21:00.000Z	rtty	cviniciusm	the grep returned no results
2010-04-26T04:21:00.000Z	rtty	cviniciusm	do i install ssh or start it somehow?
2010-04-26T04:22:00.000Z	cviniciusm	rtty	so sshd daemon is not running.
2010-04-26T04:22:00.000Z	rtty	cviniciusm	sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -i ssh -> no results
2010-04-26T04:22:00.000Z	rtty	cviniciusm	how do i start it?
2010-04-26T04:23:00.000Z	rtty	cviniciusm	sudo sshd command not found
2010-04-26T04:23:00.000Z	cviniciusm	rtty	dpkg -l | grep -i ssh does it shows ssh server installed?
2010-04-26T04:24:00.000Z	rtty	cviniciusm	it listed openssh-client, ssh-askpass-gnome and sshfs only
2010-04-26T04:28:00.000Z	rtty	cviniciusm	^
