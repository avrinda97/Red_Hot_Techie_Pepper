2005-12-17T11:15:00.000Z	qt2		err, my friend's x stopped working and dmesg is being outputted to the terminal for some reason, i've recently recompiled a kernel, any idea what could be causing it?
2005-12-17T11:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	Well, recompiling the kernel will require you to recompile the nvidia kernel modules. Also if you haven't got a system logger all log info is dumped to a terminal.
2005-12-17T11:16:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	apparently, a lot of the services failed to start.
2005-12-17T11:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	Well, then apperantly you did something wrong. ;D
2005-12-17T11:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	Is there a feature missing in the stock kernel that requires you to customize it?
2005-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	some frequency scaling, and i had to do a kernel hack to foce native p2 support.
2005-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	d/l and install the nvidia kernel module from nvidia.com last time I checked. I haven't reconfigured my kernel in Ubuntu as the stock kernel has got all my needs covered and I am happy with the speed of things.
2005-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	laptop?
2005-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	yep.
2005-12-17T11:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	Well, then I can see the need for recompiling the kernel. However I've never put my hands on freqscale as I haven't got a lappy. :)
2005-12-17T11:20:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	lol, ssh is failing to start :P
2005-12-17T11:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	Any sensible error messages?
2005-12-17T11:27:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	looks like its outputting ethernet stuff to terminal
2005-12-17T11:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	o.O
2005-12-17T11:28:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	she uninstalled friestarter.... and it stopped o.O;
2005-12-17T11:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	firestarter stopped when it was uninstalled?? Interesting.
2005-12-17T11:31:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	indeed it did, and ssh works again o.O;
2005-12-17T11:31:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	as in, it stopped failing.
2005-12-17T11:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	firestarter being a ehh.. firewall of sorts?
2005-12-17T11:31:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	indeed.
2005-12-17T11:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	Might sound like you missed some entries for iptables in your kernel config then.
2005-12-17T11:34:00.000Z	qt2	BlueEagle	happen to know how i fix the nvidia-glx driver, i removed and reinstalled it via synaptic.
2005-12-17T11:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	qt2	Don't remember, sorry.
