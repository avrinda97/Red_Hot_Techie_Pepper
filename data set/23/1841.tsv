2010-07-16T09:25:00.000Z	shafiq		can anyone tell me why my Samsung printer isn't showing up as an option to print from anymore?
2010-07-16T09:26:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	Has it changed from being your default printer?
2010-07-16T09:27:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	it doesn't even seem to be an option.  and the oddest part is, i can't even add a new printer to my system (under system>admin>printers)
2010-07-16T09:27:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	it's like something "broke"
2010-07-16T09:28:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	Ok - starting from the top, what has changed, been changed, updated, added or modified since it last worked?
2010-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	shafiq		hmm, not sure, but i can say that i did a system update yesterday i think and it froze, so i had to do a "dpkg configure -a" or something liek that to fix the broken install.  it was a font package i think.  but other than that, i can't really imagine what else it could be
2010-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	shafiq		should i try and reinstall cups maybe?
2010-07-16T09:30:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	What would be best to do first and foremost, is delete the printer (if you can), then manually run a package update, then upgrade (make sure nothing further gets broken) then turn off the printer, turn it back on - see if it's "re found"....
2010-07-16T09:30:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	just did a reinstall of cups and it worked
2010-07-16T09:30:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	Roger that - that's easier.
2010-07-16T09:31:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	and also, the printer wasn't showing at all.  strange that it worked now though.  thanks for all the suggestions :)
2010-07-16T09:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	Just a thought - if this happens again, what about just restarting the cups service?
2010-07-16T09:32:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	well, i rebooted to see if that fixed it before and it did not.
2010-07-16T09:32:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	Strange that mate.
2010-07-16T09:32:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	weird how things just seem to break in ubuntu sometimes. lol
2010-07-16T09:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	Well, truthfully, it's when the updates hit - or when something gets installed. I've got a few servers sitting around that I just don't touch - and they're happy as Larry - as long as nothing is done to them.
2010-07-16T09:33:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	really... so you don't update them at all?
2010-07-16T09:34:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	They're servers - they're happy doing what they're doing - the only thing that needs updating is clamav and fprot...nothing more...they're just servers.
2010-07-16T09:35:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	what about updates for potential security vulnerabilities?
2010-07-16T09:36:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	For all that we're security conscious, when was the last time a nicely locked down linux server was beaten up? "Plan the work, work the plan" - lock it down from the beginning - a server is a server, and when setup exactly as that, well, it's generally quite happy and solid and secure. I'll patch'em after 6 months, otherwise, nothing.
2010-07-16T09:37:00.000Z	shafiq	YankDownUnder	interesting.  thank you for sharing.  never really worked with linux as mainly servers.
2010-07-16T09:38:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	They're cheaper and less stress to run for business purposes...do pretty much the same thing...
2010-07-16T09:38:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	shafiq	...they just don't need to be rebooted or "watched for security issues" as much as anything MS
