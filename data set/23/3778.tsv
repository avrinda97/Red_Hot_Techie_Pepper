2009-04-09T23:18:00.000Z	imachine	histo	that was two lines only, man.
2009-04-09T23:19:00.000Z	imachine	histo	no need for pastebin.
2009-04-09T23:27:00.000Z	histo	imachine	whats your nvidia problem?
2009-04-09T23:27:00.000Z	imachine	histo	http://paste.ubuntu.com/147824/
2009-04-09T23:28:00.000Z	histo	imachine	You'll have to ask the nvidia people.
2009-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	imachine	histo	who exactly you mean by that?
2009-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	imachine	histo	I know there's an italian guy somewhere here
2009-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	histo	imachine	possibly check the nvidia.com support forums
2009-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	imachine	histo	the one who wrote envy
2009-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	histo	imachine	why are you using envy
2009-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	imachine	histo	I'm not using envy, when did I say that?
2009-04-09T23:30:00.000Z	histo	imachine	any reason you are trying to build the 71 drivers?
2009-04-09T23:30:00.000Z	imachine	histo	9x has flipped RGB channels on my card (gf3)
2009-04-09T23:31:00.000Z	imachine	histo	http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=106496
2009-04-09T23:31:00.000Z	imachine	histo	it's been like that for 4 years or more now.
2009-04-09T23:31:00.000Z	imachine	histo	nvidia doesn't care.
2009-04-09T23:32:00.000Z	histo	imachine	can you still download the 71.86 drivers from nvidia and just use their installer?
2009-04-09T23:32:00.000Z	imachine	histo	aye, but I'd rather have it automated.
2009-04-09T23:32:00.000Z	histo	imachine	their installer is automated
2009-04-09T23:32:00.000Z	imachine	histo	I know
2009-04-09T23:32:00.000Z	imachine	histo	but it's not what I want.
2009-04-09T23:32:00.000Z	histo	imachine	I have no idea about the error your getting though wish I could help more.
