2006-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	BockBilbo		which one eugman ?
2006-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	eugman		sudo nautilus
2006-02-24T11:17:00.000Z	eugman		then try removing it through nautilus
2006-02-24T11:17:00.000Z	BockBilbo	eugman	lets see
2006-02-24T11:18:00.000Z	eugman		Also I'm pretty sure you use a lower r to recurse with rm but you'd have to check the man pages.
2006-02-24T11:18:00.000Z	BockBilbo	eugman	... (<unknown>:6473): libgnomevfs-CRITICAL **: gnome_vfs_file_info_dup: assertion `orig != NULL' failed
2006-02-24T11:19:00.000Z	eugman		I dunno how to solve that. However you need to use the arguments -rf not -Rf when emptying a folder
2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	eugman		Also you will probable need a sudo before that or you should be able otherwise to delete it bu normal nautilus instead of a root file browser
2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	BockBilbo	eugman	i know.. but that doesnt woek
