2009-05-25T08:18:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	make sure you have satisfied all of the prequesites (sounds like you are missing kernel sources)
2009-05-25T08:19:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	i have extracted the kernel source in /usr/src/ do I need to make install that or what? its just a folder right now
2009-05-25T08:20:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	no
2009-05-25T08:32:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	whatever you are doing is probably wrong btw
2009-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	I finally got the make part to work and it said "Type 'make config' and enable loadable module support.Then build a kernel with module support enabled." that is why I am trying to build a new kernel.
2009-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	like i said, whatever you are doing is probably wrong.  1. there is almost 0 reason to compile a kernel on an ubuntu system, 2. you are supposed to compile a kernel using kpkg and other debian/ubuntu specific mechanisms or things are going to go badly.
2009-05-25T08:34:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	well I need this omnibook module so I can get my fn keys to work on my toshiba it says MODULE support is disabled what else am I suppose to do?
2009-05-25T08:36:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	have you bothered to search the forum, launchpad, or the wiki?  A basic search yields quite a few relevant results
2009-05-25T08:37:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	yes I have and all of them say to do it this way make install on the omnibook module and thats where I am at right now...so please stop making it sound like I am dumb
2009-05-25T08:37:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	actually the first link i'm looking at says to use module-assistant
2009-05-25T08:38:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	and yes I have tried that as well and that results in Errors and doesn't build right
2009-05-25T08:38:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	so why not diagnose those errors?
2009-05-25T08:39:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	because it doesn't produce a log file at all so I can figure out what the errors are it says it does and I go to where it says and there is no log file
2009-05-25T08:43:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	wget http://packages.kirya.net/debian/pool/main/o/omnibook/omnibook-source_2.20070211+svn20090227-1_all.deb; dpkg -i omnibook*.deb ; sudo module-assistant build omnibook ; sudo module-assistant install omnibook; sudo modprobe omnibook; sudo -i ; echo omnibook >> /etc/modules
2009-05-25T08:43:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	doesn't work?
2009-05-25T08:44:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	will try exactly what you put right now and tell you where and what exactly it says if fail k
2009-05-25T08:44:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	those are the directions from the first google link..
2009-05-25T08:56:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	okay I got to sudo module-assistant install omnibook....and I got this .... "Package omnibook-source was not built successfully, see /var/cache/modass/omnibook-source*buildlog* for details!" and I went to that place and there is no log file.
2009-05-25T08:57:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	so?
2009-05-25T08:57:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	follow the rest of the commands I gave you?
2009-05-25T08:57:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	I can't it won't install though it says its not built right and then the modeprob part doesn't work
2009-05-25T08:57:00.000Z	fryguy	pegon	did you install build-essential
2009-05-25T08:58:00.000Z	pegon	fryguy	i just checked thats already installed
