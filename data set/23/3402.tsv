2009-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	tARrAScH		Hi, Since I upgraded to 9.04 I've got quite a lot of amount of crashes on my system (that is, seeing a black screen for a second, then being logged out). Have other people also complained about it since the release of 9.04?
2009-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	tARrAScH		*black screen = typical terminal with text and such.
2009-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	what does it say?
2009-05-13T16:53:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- it flashes by so quickly, I can't read it
2009-05-13T16:55:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	ok can you log back in again? or does it stay black?
2009-05-13T16:55:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- it goes "black" (with a lot of text), you get logged out, and I then just log in again
2009-05-13T16:56:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	ok log back in and pastebin the last 100 or so lines of /var/log/messages
2009-05-13T16:58:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- here's a paste http://paste.ubuntu.com/171594/
2009-05-13T17:00:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	any program you were running just before the black screen?
2009-05-13T17:00:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- not any particular, just the usual, firefox, rhythmbox and perhaps OO.org
2009-05-13T17:02:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	this may cause it --> May 13 13:47:08 arash-desktop bonobo-activation-server (arash-16684): could not associate with desktop session: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-8Pd5KiDxj8: Connection refused
2009-05-13T17:02:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	as how to fix it... I don't know :(
2009-05-13T17:03:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- I think I got the same problem as CosmicChaos. Mabybe it's Pidgin causing it all as CosmicChaos says
2009-05-13T17:09:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	CosmicChaos I have been using pidgin and no crashes to date, I had a funny thing with BIOS that made my HD go spaz, a 160 Gig HD reporting as a 571 Gig one!
2009-05-13T17:09:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- even with 9.04?
2009-05-13T17:09:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	CosmicChaos nope
2009-05-13T17:10:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	CosmicChaos That made it crash with i/o errors
2009-05-13T17:10:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- well I had no problems until upgrade to 9.04
2009-05-13T17:11:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	CosmicChaos sorry, yes in 9.04 but not in 8.10
2009-05-13T17:12:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- do you mean no problem on 9.04 but problem on 8.10 :S ?
2009-05-13T17:13:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	no I mean I stuffed up and got my versions mixed up... 9.04 is current and I have had problems with current
2009-05-13T17:13:00.000Z	tARrAScH	mechdave	- so you're experienceing crashes too ?
2009-05-13T17:14:00.000Z	mechdave	tARrAScH	was, the BIOS was screwy. Since I fixed that everything has been rock solid
