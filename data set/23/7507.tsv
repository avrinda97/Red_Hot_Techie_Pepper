2005-07-23T11:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen		well, debian doesn't even have an OO version for amd64. hoary just has a 32 bit version for amd64 because it won't compile clean for a 64 bit processor
2005-07-23T11:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen		debian sarge has approximately 15,250 packages
2005-07-23T11:57:00.000Z	jasoncohen		sid has in the mid 16,000s
2005-07-23T11:57:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	yes sarge has quite a bit...but not everything works
2005-07-23T11:58:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	the debian maintainers are damn good. everything in "main" on sarge should work as it's been thouroughly tested, and remember- main on debian probably includes 13-14,000 packages. it encompasses all free software, unlike ubuntu
2005-07-23T11:58:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	well most of the stuff works...but there is a lot more than just main
2005-07-23T11:58:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	no- you don't understand
2005-07-23T11:58:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	main on debian is NOT LIKE MAIN ON UBUNTU
2005-07-23T11:59:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	well i see thousands of packages at the sunsite repository and there is a lot more than just main
2005-07-23T11:59:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	you can't blame debian for broken UNOFFICIAL packages
2005-07-23T12:00:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	well what is the official apt sources.
2005-07-23T12:00:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	because i had to look around and find several universities and also sunsite
2005-07-23T12:01:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	check out packages.debian.org. nearly everything is in main. contrib and non-free only have packages that can't be included in main for licensing reasons. everything in main gets full security support and is thoroughly tested. they're not handpicked packages like in ubuntu main. it includes everything- which is why debian takes forever to release. they are testing 10s of thousands of packages on 11 architectures and
2005-07-23T12:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	packages.debian.org lists all packages in debian- search sarge
2005-07-24T06:02:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	i run both
2005-07-24T06:02:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	but not changed from one to the other
2005-07-24T06:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	sarge's 2.6.8 gives me kernel page faults and 2.6.11 doesn't compile ivtv correctly for me. i think i was able to do it using hoary's 2.6.10 kernel
2005-07-24T06:03:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	ok..there must be a few header changes...so you just have to experiment.
2005-07-24T06:10:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	but like all the others before you....if you can't get your driver code to work....you can just give all your expensive proprietary code to Linus for free and he and his leutenants will make an effort to include for everyone for free in their constantly changing kernel
2005-07-24T06:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	bojangles	it's actually on open source driver - see chris kennedy's ivtv driver
2005-07-24T06:12:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	well linus is into free and gpl...so if they hand over all rights to the code  forever....they can give it to linus
2005-07-24T06:48:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	that is being worked on at the hardware level...there are now some iRAM boards and some solid state hard drives with fiber optics coupling that will help the i/o latency stuff.
2005-07-24T06:49:00.000Z	bojangles	jasoncohen	so you won't have to worry...just get or design the right hardware.
