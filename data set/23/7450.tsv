2005-08-08T13:38:00.000Z	taz_		Anyone using gallery here? .. When does ubuntu release new version of gallery in the package system? Or do i have to upgrade manually?
2005-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	there probably won't be a gallery upgrade until breezy, in october
2005-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	oh.. then i better update it myself.. do you know if i should remove it in the package manager before i upgrade it?
2005-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	yes you should
2005-08-08T13:40:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	ok .. thx :) Btw.. it is missing jpegtran.. do you know if i can find this package as a .deb package or something?
2005-08-08T13:42:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	I don't complie much these days, but packages.ubuntu.com can probably help you out
2005-08-08T13:43:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	ill try that.. thx :)
2005-08-08T13:44:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	no success.. but ill find it in some way :)
2005-08-08T13:45:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	jpegtrans is in some debian lib, trust me. you'll just have to find the equiv name :)
2005-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	oh.. ok
2005-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	I think what you are looking for is libjpeg-progs, it has /usr/bin/jpegtran
2005-08-08T13:52:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	ahhh thx man! :)
2005-08-08T13:52:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	I found that by doing apt-cache depends gallery
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	yeah..to be honest i checked depends on gallery and found that too.. but i did not know that jpegtran was included in that... hehe..
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	i did not think that far ;)
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	practice :)
2005-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	hehe :)
2005-08-08T13:57:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	now my gallery will look more nice thx to you ;)
2005-08-08T13:57:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	is there a simple way to reconfigure apache2 to add this: "--enable-module=rewrite" ?
2005-08-08T13:57:00.000Z	nickrud	taz_	not a ** clue, no apache here ;)
2005-08-08T13:59:00.000Z	taz_	nickrud	okis :)
