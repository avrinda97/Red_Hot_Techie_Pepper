2010-09-18T09:27:00.000Z	sisterd		ok. lucid lynx... just downloaded an hplip driver for my printer which came as a .run file it has been associated with gedit (dont know why?) and when i open a terminal and type in the command to run the shell script (as instructed at the website) i get a "sh: Can't open hplip-3.10.2.run" response.
2010-09-18T09:28:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	did you do 'sh hplip-3.10.2.run'
2010-09-18T09:29:00.000Z	sisterd	tensorpudding	yes, that is the command that generated the "can't" response
2010-09-18T09:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	are you in the right directory?
2010-09-18T09:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	i.e. are you in the directory where the file is located
2010-09-18T09:30:00.000Z	sisterd	tensorpudding	yes, they told me to put it in my desktop and then do a "cd desktop" before executing the command. so, yes my prompt defines me as in desktop
2010-09-18T09:31:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	that is odd then
2010-09-18T09:31:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	have you tried right-clicking, and making the file executable?
2010-09-18T09:32:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	under the right-click menu, properties -> permissions tab -> check the box after Execute:
2010-09-18T09:32:00.000Z	sisterd	tensorpudding	yes, I have. and, that's where I notice that the file has been associated with the program gedit. which doesn't seem liek what i would want if i want it to be an executable. but that's a guess.
2010-09-18T09:32:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	if it is marked as executable then double-clicking should ask you if you want to execute it
2010-09-18T09:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	it should say "do you want to run the file or view its contents"
2010-09-18T09:33:00.000Z	sisterd	tensorpudding	ok that seems to have done the trick. just wouldn't let me do it from within terminal for some reason.
2010-09-18T09:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	you'll want to run it in terminal
2010-09-18T09:33:00.000Z	sisterd	tensorpudding	it doesnt let me
2010-09-18T09:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	hmm
2010-09-18T09:34:00.000Z	sisterd		but, it seems to be working fine as a self-extracting doohickey
2010-09-18T09:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	okay
2010-09-18T09:34:00.000Z	sisterd	tensorpudding	ok, installation notes tell me to enable the universe/multiverse repositories... any clue on that?
2010-09-18T09:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	go to Software Sources in the Ubuntu menu
2010-09-18T09:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	and check to enable those repositories
2010-09-18T09:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding	sisterd	most likely they should be enabled already
2010-09-18T09:39:00.000Z	sisterd	tensorpudding	thank you.t hat is simpler than where i was heading (the ubuntu repositories page.. which gives me a terminal command that requires me to know the repository location....)
