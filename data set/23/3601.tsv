2010-03-31T03:36:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	just a moment
2010-03-31T03:37:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	what is the brand and model number of your computer?
2010-03-31T03:39:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	are you on ubuntu 9.10?
2010-03-31T03:40:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	was it a new install or an upgrade? and did it not work initially?
2010-03-31T03:42:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	did you install the proprietary Broadcom STA Driver through the ubuntu utility?
2010-03-31T03:43:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	were you prompted to install the driver?
2010-03-31T03:44:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	connect using the ethernet cable, go to System > Administration > Hardware drivers and pick the Broadcom STA wireless driver and activate it. then restart and your wireless should work.
2010-03-31T03:45:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	intel wireless cards contain chips in them. these chips can be broadcom.
2010-03-31T03:46:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	since the actual manufacturer of the card usually doesn't matter, people distinguish wireless cards with the manufacturer of the chips
2010-03-31T03:47:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	how did you determine that?
2010-03-31T03:48:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	this seems to be a bug for it https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wpasupplicant/+bug/468519
2010-03-31T03:49:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	you can get a launchpad account and click on "Subscribe/Unsubscribe" to be notified for changes in that bug.
2010-03-31T03:49:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	there doesn't appear to be a resolution, at least not one that's widely known, yet
2010-03-31T03:50:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	you did a good job checking the forums. if there are fixes they usually are outlined there. the other place to look is in bugreports
2010-03-31T03:51:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	i am not sure about 10.04. upgrading is a good idea so either way i recommend you upgrade and find out.
2010-03-31T03:51:00.000Z	chelz	Admin_	or ethernet. make sure you have mac address filtering enabled at least
