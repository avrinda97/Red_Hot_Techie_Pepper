2008-04-15T11:27:00.000Z	kdorf		My machine is the game machine, I suppose
2008-04-15T11:27:00.000Z	kdorf		Let me explain a little more and see if it answers your question
2008-04-15T11:28:00.000Z	kdorf		right.
2008-04-15T11:29:00.000Z	kdorf		But I'm not sure what you mean by "game machine"... it's a little ambiguous in this instance. Let me explain a little more.
2008-04-15T11:30:00.000Z	kdorf		making an outgoing connection isn't the issue, it's getting an incoming one
2008-04-15T11:30:00.000Z	kdorf		What it does, more or less, is connects to a matchmaking service (Battle.net) which will let you host games, puts them in a list and allows people to connect. If I host a game, I note that my VPN connection's appropriate port opens, however, people cannot connect to me.
2008-04-15T11:30:00.000Z	kdorf		They should be connecting directly to my VPN IP
2008-04-15T11:31:00.000Z	kdorf		but my theory is that the game is binding to eth0, and battle.net lists my public IP as 134.84.*.*, instead of my VPN's IP
2008-04-15T11:31:00.000Z	kdorf		it's the only explanation, since I can SSH directly into my public IP
2008-04-15T11:31:00.000Z	kdorf		the ports are being forwarded
2008-04-15T11:32:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	kdorf	can other people ssh to your vpn ip?
2008-04-15T11:32:00.000Z	kdorf	Robbie_Crash	As a test, I sshed into another university computer and then used that to ssh into my VPN IP, which worked
2008-04-15T11:34:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	kdorf	what's supplying your vpn?
2008-04-15T11:34:00.000Z	kdorf	Robbie_Crash	StrongVPN service @ http://www.strongvpn.com
2008-04-15T11:34:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	kdorf	also, what's your local ip scheme?
2008-04-15T11:36:00.000Z	kdorf	Robbie_Crash	my local eth0 IP is the same as it is externally, a 134.84.*.* address, and my ppp0 is reached via eth0 and has a 216.something something IP
2008-04-15T11:37:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	kdorf	what protocol does the game need?
2008-04-15T11:37:00.000Z	kdorf	Robbie_Crash	UDP
2008-04-15T11:37:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	kdorf	do you have the "openVPN" account upgrade?
2008-04-15T11:37:00.000Z	kdorf	Robbie_Crash	No
2008-04-15T11:38:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	kdorf	http://strongvpn.com/faq.shtml "Our standard VPN account uses TCP, we can however do UDP as well with a OpenVPN account upgrade."
2008-04-15T11:38:00.000Z	kdorf	Robbie_Crash	what a sadness :(
2008-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	kdorf	most games use tcp, but lots of them use udp too. Steam for example uses 42000-42020tcp and 42021-42050udp
