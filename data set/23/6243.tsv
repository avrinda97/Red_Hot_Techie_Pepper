2006-06-08T13:02:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	yes
2006-06-08T13:03:00.000Z	SurfnKid	KenSentMe	ok, this is weird, i open synaptic right. click on settings, repo, and the instructions says click on settings at bottom, tick show disabled sofwtware sources. but where's the settings button!
2006-06-08T13:05:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	click add and then choose the repo's you want to add
2006-06-08T13:06:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	just click all four options, so universe and multiverse
2006-06-08T13:06:00.000Z	SurfnKid	KenSentMe	i did. 2 are checked, i check the other 2 and click add?
2006-06-08T13:06:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	yes
2006-06-08T13:07:00.000Z	SurfnKid	KenSentMe	then exit that and when i go back again to check if those 2 were checked.they get unchecked its weird.
2006-06-08T13:07:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	but they are in the list on the previous page
2006-06-08T13:09:00.000Z	SurfnKid	KenSentMe	yes they are, but keep clicking on add and only the first 2 are selected. the other 2 keep getting unselected ( even tho i should click on 1 )
2006-06-08T13:10:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	that's teh same with me, but if they are in the list, it means the repo's are added. So just click close
2006-06-08T13:11:00.000Z	SurfnKid	KenSentMe	im gonna try thru cli
2006-06-08T13:13:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	isn't your problem solved right now?
2006-06-08T13:14:00.000Z	SurfnKid	KenSentMe	it might, once i reload the sources.list
2006-06-08T13:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe	SurfnKid	synaptic does that too
