2009-11-03T16:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	I was going to put that
2009-12-12T10:04:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	Those issues were largely resolved within a week of the release.
2009-12-12T10:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	oh ok, so upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10 should go pretty well for most now?
2009-12-12T10:05:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	Yes
2009-12-12T10:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	ok good
2009-12-12T10:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	I think it's in one of the repos that isn't on by default?  multiverse?  universe?  ,but maybe not
2009-12-12T10:23:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	Potentially Canonical's partner repository, but that is not part of Ubuntu.
2009-12-12T10:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	that sounds like what I was thinking of
2009-12-20T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	probably would have been better really if Ubuntu had stayed with the old one, untill the new could be themed
2009-12-20T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	without needing to use another program or whatever
2009-12-20T02:41:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	Perhaps, but the vast majority of users don't customise the gdm theme, and there were several benefits.
2009-12-20T02:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	Seems quite a lot of people want to change the theme.  Benefits such as?
2009-12-20T02:42:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	You're only going to be seeing the people who want to change the theme complaining.
2009-12-20T02:42:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	for every one of them, there could be hundreds of thousands of users who don't.
2009-12-20T02:43:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	Power management, better accessibility (I believe), better fast user switching for use in the new panel applets, faster startup, and probably other stuff.
2009-12-20T02:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	well yeah I guess, it's not been that often when someone has asked how to change it, in here, for example,  when I have seen it
2009-12-20T03:09:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	Yet they don't support RandR 1.2...
2009-12-20T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	for old cards as well yeah?
2009-12-20T03:19:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	Yes.
2009-12-20T03:21:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	But neither GRUB2 nor ext4 are particularly important.
2009-12-20T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	I assume that's ok,  for me to say, that they won't get Ext4 on a 8.04 upgrade?  even though of course I don't 100% know for sure,  but I highly doubt it will happen on upgrade.
2009-12-20T03:21:00.000Z	wgrant	sebsebseb	That's correct.
2009-12-20T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	wgrant	I once had ikonia telling me off, when I was saying stuff like that to someone in here.
