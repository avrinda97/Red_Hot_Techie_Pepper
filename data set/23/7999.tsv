2005-02-24T15:22:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	I don't know if I'm "good", but I'll be happy to hear about your problems.  :)
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	i cant get xwindows to start after installing ubuntu
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	it keeps having a fatal error
2005-02-24T15:26:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	hmm...
2005-02-24T15:26:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	are you familiar with your /etc/X11/XF86Config file (Warty) or /etc/X11/xorg.conf file (Hoary)?
2005-02-24T15:27:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	nope sorry, new to linux
2005-02-24T15:28:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	im on a dell inspiron 1100 laptop
2005-02-24T15:28:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	I'd try 'sudo nano /etc/X11/XF86Config' to see your config file.  that's where I would start looking to answer the question you asked.
2005-02-24T15:28:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	also, have you looked at your X server log output?
2005-02-24T15:28:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	no i havent,
2005-02-24T15:28:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	and google is your friend, of course.  "ubuntu dell inspiron 1100 laptop"  :)
2005-02-24T15:29:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	ty, 1 min gonna try the commands above
2005-02-24T15:30:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	oh - here it is.  do "sudo nano /var/log/XFree86.0.log" also.
2005-02-24T15:30:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	and you can switch between several different "virtual terminals" while you work on this - just use Alt+F{1,2,3,4,5,6}.
2005-02-24T15:30:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	that way you can multitask.
2005-02-24T15:33:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	there is nothing (blank screen except menu) in sudo nano /etc/X11/XF86Config
2005-02-24T15:34:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	and i cant get out of it..... :(
2005-02-24T15:35:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	uh, CTRL+x gets you out of nano
