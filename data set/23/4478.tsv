2007-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		i'm having some issues getting sound working with an audigy 4 card... no sound at all.  there was sound on the live cd.  i've done the due diligence and googled until i can't google anymore... tried all the tricks i found with no luck... ideas?
2007-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	LadyFantasy	what happens when you type alsamixer in a terminal?
2007-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	LadyFantasy	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	i've unmuted all the channels
2007-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		volume's all up
2007-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		unchecked the "use digital output" switch or whatever it was
2007-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	LadyFantasy	did you try turning up surround? my laptop wouldn't get any sound until I turned surround on
2007-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		turned up everything
2007-08-03T11:01:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		it seems to be specific to the audigy cards from what i've seen... but so far, none of the solutions seem to work
2007-08-03T11:03:00.000Z	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	LadyFantasy	did it stop working after the install, or after the upgrades?
2007-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	LadyFantasy	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	i don't remember... i think it worked after the install, but not after upgrades
2007-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		i did try going back one kernel rev
2007-08-03T11:09:00.000Z	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	LadyFantasy	if you know what is the audigy4 module is you can try replacing the current one with it
2007-08-03T11:09:00.000Z	\x6e\x65\x72\x64		the current with the old one that worked
2007-08-03T11:10:00.000Z	LadyFantasy	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	?  I believe it is the emu10k something or other
2007-08-03T11:10:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		yeah, emu10k1
2007-08-03T11:11:00.000Z	LadyFantasy	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	the emu10k1 module (which is correct for that card) is loaded, onboard sound is disabled also in case that was interfering...
2007-08-03T11:12:00.000Z	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	LadyFantasy	did you try playing with analog/digital output mute button
2007-08-03T11:12:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		yes i did
2007-08-03T11:13:00.000Z	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	LadyFantasy	what do you get when you type lspci -v | grep Creative ?
2007-08-03T11:13:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		05:06.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB0400 Audigy2 Value Subsystem: Creative Labs Unknown device 1021
2007-08-03T11:14:00.000Z	LadyFantasy	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	the card appears to be identified correctly (exactly as it was under gentoo on the same machine)
2007-08-03T11:17:00.000Z	LadyFantasy		well, i'm booting back to gentoo... this has already taken too much time
2007-08-03T11:17:00.000Z	LadyFantasy	\x6e\x65\x72\x64	thanks for the help, but i give up. shouldn't have to go through all this pain for something so simple, and my gentoo works perfectly.
