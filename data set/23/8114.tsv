2005-01-17T09:38:00.000Z	neenee		i will try ubuntu too
2005-01-17T09:38:00.000Z	neenee		at the moment i am on debian
2005-01-17T09:39:00.000Z	neenee		warum spreche sie deutsch?
2005-01-17T09:39:00.000Z	neenee		or is this an international channel?
2005-01-17T09:40:00.000Z	neenee		i'm used to separate channels for different languages
2005-01-17T09:40:00.000Z	neenee		but i can get used to mixed.
2005-01-17T09:42:00.000Z	neenee		hm
2005-01-17T09:42:00.000Z	neenee		now that doesn't make me want to rush into ubuntu
2005-01-17T09:42:00.000Z	neenee		flodins' question that is
2005-01-17T09:43:00.000Z	neenee		http://neeneedesktop.now.nu - go ion3 :)
2005-01-17T09:44:00.000Z	flodin	neenee	this is the big problem with a fixed release schedule and no package updates between releases
2005-01-17T09:44:00.000Z	flodin	neenee	the advantage is better support and fewer problems overall
2005-01-17T09:45:00.000Z	neenee	flodin	hm. well, i used gentoo for over a year.. i suppose i can deal with problems in ubuntu
2005-01-17T09:46:00.000Z	neenee	flodin	use -O, do not put a zero there
2005-01-17T09:47:00.000Z	flodin	neenee	i just switched from gentoo myself. I got tired of design flaws in the gentoo package system that broke my system... i can't say i'm unhappy about switching, but i wouldn't say either of them is a clear winner
2005-01-17T09:48:00.000Z	flodin	neenee	that's not the same is it? -O means optimize, -O0 means do not optimize
2005-01-17T09:48:00.000Z	neenee	flodin	hmm.. i've never seen -O0 being used
2005-01-17T09:48:00.000Z	neenee	flodin	i assumed it was erroneous
2005-01-17T09:49:00.000Z	flodin	neenee	-O0 is equivalent to having no option at all. What I mean to say is that with -O2 it compiles without warnings, and with no -O2 there it gives a gazillion warnings about forgotten return statements (but it still compiles the program)
2005-01-17T09:50:00.000Z	flodin	neenee	well i'm the developer... and without an -O option, it uses no optimization. Which is what I want, in order to debug the program
2005-01-17T09:51:00.000Z	neenee	flodin	ok. i thought it used no extra optimization with -O either
2005-01-17T09:51:00.000Z	flodin	neenee	-O is equivalent to -O1, i believe
2005-01-17T09:52:00.000Z	neenee	flodin	hm.. that would make sense mathematically speaking, but i often run into linux-things which do not make much sense since it tries to be unique/original :)
