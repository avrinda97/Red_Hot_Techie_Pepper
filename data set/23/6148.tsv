2006-10-09T08:38:00.000Z	Ronz		(EE) NVIDIA(0): Version mismatch detected between the NVIDIA X driver and the

2006-10-09T08:38:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	easy
2006-10-09T08:39:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	you will be my best friend if i can get this working. Hitch is already one of my hero's.   ;
2006-10-09T08:40:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	clearly your nvidia x driver and nvidia-glx arent the same versions
2006-10-09T08:40:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	could you post your xorg.conf on pastebin?
2006-10-09T08:40:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	how do i go about making them the same version? the way that i understood it was nvidia-glx contains the nvidia driver
2006-10-09T08:40:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	sure
2006-10-09T08:41:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	do you want the xorg file or the Xorg.0.log file?
2006-10-09T08:41:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	also, did you edit it manually? And did you apt-get the nvidia drivers, or did you get them off the nvidia website
2006-10-09T08:42:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	i edited it manually. used apt to install nvidia-glx, and edited the file with nvidia-glx-config enable. i also tried it manually, with no luck
2006-10-09T08:43:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26072/
2006-10-09T08:43:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	here is the xorg.0.log file also
2006-10-09T08:44:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	your xorg.conf is not set up to use the nvidia driver. I see that from the "device" section, it says Driver "nv" instead of "nvidia"
2006-10-09T08:44:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	i changed it back to nv so i can use my computer
2006-10-09T08:46:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	ah i see :) , well, like the xorg.0.log says, try to re-install everything related to 'nvidia', something has gone wrong when you installed those.
2006-10-09T08:47:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	i have reinstalled time and time again
2006-10-09T08:47:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	can you pastebin your sources.list?
2006-10-09T08:48:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	sure
2006-10-09T09:06:00.000Z	djuuss	Ronz	in your sources.list, uncomment the last two lines, then run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get install
2006-10-09T09:07:00.000Z	Ronz	djuuss	"0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
