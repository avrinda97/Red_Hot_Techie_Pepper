2006-08-22T14:35:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	XFCE != GNOME
2006-08-22T14:35:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	someone told me to go to gnome-look.org, where should I go
2006-08-22T14:35:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	no clue, i don't know much of xfce
2006-08-22T14:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	the bot only seems to know of kde and gnome
2006-08-22T14:37:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	I'll go to xfce-look.org
2006-08-31T15:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	what does it do?
2006-08-31T15:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	describe what you need done and we may know
2006-08-31T15:04:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	U dont know? It is the way that you make network connections in Windows. It mostly works with shared files
2006-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	by network connections I ment shared connections, IP to IP...
2006-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	um, how owuld i know?  this is #ubuntu not #ms :)
2006-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	okay, so you want to make a dir available to other machine on the lan, to read from?
2006-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	Windows, I was just asking if there is such a thing in Ubuntu
2006-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	or did you want to be able to log into other machines?
2006-08-31T15:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	i have never used windows, hence the request for the description
2006-08-31T15:06:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	You see, have you ever used Windows
2006-08-31T15:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	no
2006-08-31T15:06:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	nothing jazzrocker has the answer
2006-08-31T15:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	if you want to mount a local directory for export to others, in *nox, the standard means is via NFS (network file system) and /etc/exports is where you would specify that
2006-08-31T15:08:00.000Z	npster	eyequeue	Sorry, I found the answer, I mean jazzrocker found it
2006-08-31T15:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	npster	nfs?  okay
