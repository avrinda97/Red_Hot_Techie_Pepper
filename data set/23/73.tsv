2012-10-15T08:53:00.000Z	wubino		I am trying to add driver support for a hd radeon 6670
2012-10-15T08:53:00.000Z	wubino		I keep on getting an error during install
2012-10-15T08:54:00.000Z	wubino		here is the error log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1280530/
2012-10-15T08:54:00.000Z	wubino		FWIW: i did a completely new install of ubuntu 12.04
2012-10-15T08:54:00.000Z	crizis^	wubino	are you trying to install 'post release' updates with additional drivers?
2012-10-15T08:55:00.000Z	wubino	crizis^	yes
2012-10-15T08:55:00.000Z	crizis^		that won't work
2012-10-15T08:55:00.000Z	wubino		oh
2012-10-15T08:55:00.000Z	crizis^		either install regular driver, or install that from console
2012-10-15T08:55:00.000Z	crizis^		with: sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates
2012-10-15T08:55:00.000Z	wubino		will do
2012-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	wubino		crizis^,: is there a PPA better suited then the managed packaged driver?
2012-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	crizis^		that was broken even in back in 11.10.. dno why they won't fix it already
2012-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	crizis^		well, driver is quite current so don't bother
2012-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	wubino		great
2012-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	crizis^		fglrx-updates is catalyst 12.4
2012-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	crizis^		regular one is iirc 11.8
2012-10-15T08:56:00.000Z	crizis^		having 6870 myself and just running that regular one
2012-10-15T08:57:00.000Z	crizis^		haven't really noticed any performance difference in games.. then again these cards are almost 2 years already so doubt drivers will improve them much
2012-10-15T08:58:00.000Z	wubino	crizis^	whats the best opencl install method for an ati card?
2012-10-15T08:58:00.000Z	crizis^		ati's drivers are basically just stubs that translate opengl calls to hardware anyway.. nvidia's drivers are pretty much artificial intelligence on their own, optimizing themselves at runtime
2012-10-15T08:59:00.000Z	crizis^		haven't done any opencl stuff so no idea.. :)
2012-10-15T08:59:00.000Z	wubino	crizis^	I loved my nvidia cards but this was the best bang for buck I could find
