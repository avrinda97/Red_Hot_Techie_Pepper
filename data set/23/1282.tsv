2010-09-07T14:00:00.000Z	somethinginteres		hi all, is it really worth using a fresh install to upgrade Ubuntu or will an upgrade from within the OS be equally fine?
2010-09-07T14:01:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	A fresh install would definitely be better than an upgrade but you'd have to reinstall all your packages again. Upgrading would save you the headache of installing all packages all over again.
2010-09-07T14:02:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	what sort of benefit does it provide? I don't mind reinstall packages if it will mean a better system
2010-09-07T14:04:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	Well, if your system is too bloated/cluttered, it helps you remove the clutter. Plus some rogue configs would be cleared of. Boot time would be much better.
2010-09-07T14:05:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	right, might do that then. I have a regression bug in the kernel for Lucid that means no audio so I am thinking of making the jump to 10.10 early
2010-09-07T14:06:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	you should go ahead then
2010-09-07T14:09:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	Why don't you just upgrade the kernel?
2010-09-07T14:10:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	well I've upgraded as the updates have come through the update manager, but the bug is not resolved
2010-09-07T14:12:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	Latest kernel takes time to appear in update manager (repos). You might want to install manually.

2010-09-07T14:13:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	I would do that but each I try seems to have weird quircks
2010-09-07T14:14:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	for example, the daily I used a week ago made my screen super tiny
2010-09-07T14:14:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	nd it wasn't changing
2010-09-07T14:14:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	Well, its not worth the trouble then. BTW, have you filed a bug about your sound problem? Link?
2010-09-07T14:14:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	I have - give me a sec I'll find it
2010-09-07T14:16:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/622070
2010-09-07T14:19:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	2.6.35 is available with maverick. You should try that.
2010-09-07T14:20:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	I'd suggest you to install maverick.
2010-09-07T14:21:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	Alternatively, you might add maverick's repos and install the kernel from there, but that may create some problems, I am not really sure.
2010-09-07T14:22:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	I'll go for maverick then
2010-09-07T14:22:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	I ran Lucid from beta with no problems
2010-09-07T14:22:00.000Z	somethinginteres	dpac_	thanks
2010-09-07T14:23:00.000Z	dpac_	somethinginteres	you're welcome :)
