2007-12-08T04:18:00.000Z	talcite		hey guys, I'm having a problem starting ubuntu server
2007-12-08T04:19:00.000Z	talcite		it's stuck on loading rc.local scripts
2007-12-08T04:19:00.000Z	soundray_	talcite	can you boot in recovery mode?
2007-12-08T04:19:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	lemme try
2007-12-08T04:28:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	at loading rc.local scripts 0.o
2007-12-08T04:21:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	it has no problem booting into recovery mode
2007-12-08T04:21:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	but I have no idea why it's not booting into normal mode...
2007-12-08T04:21:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	any ideas?
2007-12-08T04:22:00.000Z	soundray_	talcite	while in recovery mode, have a look at /var/log/syslog and see if you find any entries relating to the failed boot
2007-12-08T04:25:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	it's really weird... It just stops at the cron jobs, after the NTP sever exits
2007-12-08T04:25:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	and it has a bunch of messages about IPtables blocking packets
2007-12-08T04:25:00.000Z	soundray_	talcite	is it a fresh install?
2007-12-08T04:26:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	well "fresh" yes, but it's been awhile since I've booted it up
2007-12-08T04:26:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	almost 2 months actually
2007-12-08T04:26:00.000Z	soundray_	talcite	did you do anything to configure iptables?
2007-12-08T04:27:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	I did configure them, yes
2007-12-08T04:27:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	that shouldn't be a problem though should it?
2007-12-08T04:27:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	you've got to be kidding me... It was waiting for me to press enter...
2007-12-08T04:27:00.000Z	soundray_	talcite	no, it shouldn't -- just wanted to make sure this wasn't some unintended effect of something else
2007-12-08T04:28:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	I feel like an idiot now >.>'
2007-12-08T04:28:00.000Z	soundray_	talcite	on what?
2007-12-08T04:28:00.000Z	talcite	soundray_	ahh well, thanks for your help =D
2007-12-08T04:28:00.000Z	soundray_	talcite	hmm, strange. Glad you located the problem, though
