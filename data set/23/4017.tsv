2009-05-08T19:16:00.000Z	space_cadet		well...
2009-05-08T19:16:00.000Z	space_cadet		i see my swap  but it's not using it
2009-05-08T19:17:00.000Z	space_cadet		i have 3.7 gig total, 0 used
2009-05-08T19:18:00.000Z	space_cadet		crazyness
2009-05-08T19:19:00.000Z	space_cadet		i have xchat, amarok, audacity, open office, foobilliard, compiz, firefox, and cairo dock all running and it won't even touch my swap
2009-05-08T19:21:00.000Z	space_cadet		why won't ubuntu use my swap?
2009-05-08T19:22:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	it wont use your swap unless it has to
2009-05-08T19:22:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	why does it "have" to
2009-05-08T19:22:00.000Z	space_cadet	h00k	to hibernate?
2009-05-08T19:22:00.000Z	space_cadet	h00k	but alas, it does not want to
2009-05-08T19:23:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	ah, I understand
2009-05-08T19:25:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	is this before or after hibernation?
2009-05-08T19:25:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	is it hibernating properly?
2009-05-08T19:26:00.000Z	space_cadet	h00k	well... it appears to go into hibernation properly (with various usb errors)
2009-05-08T19:26:00.000Z	space_cadet	h00k	but on "resume"  it just boots like i did a normal powerdown
2009-05-08T19:26:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	thats what hibernate is,
2009-05-08T19:26:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	and then it should resume your applications that you had open
2009-05-08T19:26:00.000Z	space_cadet	h00k	nope
2009-05-08T19:27:00.000Z	space_cadet	h00k	like i said.. it just boots like i did a normal power down
2009-05-08T19:27:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	interesting, I'm not sure what to tell you...
2009-05-08T19:28:00.000Z	space_cadet	h00k	you could tell me to stop trying to hibernate :)
2009-05-08T19:28:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	that would work
2009-05-08T19:28:00.000Z	h00k	space_cadet	perhaps check launchpad with your make/model of hardware and submit/subscribe to a bug
