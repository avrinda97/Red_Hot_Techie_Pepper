2008-04-22T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	are you editing xorg.conf as sudo/gksu
2008-04-22T13:09:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	yup
2008-04-22T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	if you remove all the other resolutions from xorg.conf it will have no other option
2008-04-22T13:10:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	hmm
2008-04-22T13:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	backup your xorg.conf before doing this
2008-05-09T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	doesnt make a difference, updating from cd will mean you download less from the repos\
2008-05-09T16:25:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	can i choose if i want a clean install or upgrade?
2008-05-09T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	if you have an installed OS and do clean instal it will wipe you drive. you want upgrade
2008-05-09T16:27:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	the reason i upgrade is that my earlier (gutsy) can't be booted anymore
2008-05-09T16:29:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	it's prolly gonna be a clean reinstall after i've managed to salvage the /home dir i believe
2008-05-09T16:30:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	thanks
2008-05-09T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	id research the method first
2008-05-09T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	and backup data just in case :)
2008-05-16T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	if you like it then yes
2008-06-12T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	yes, the only difference is the frontend
2008-06-12T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	xubuntu uses xfce as its window manager, Ubuntu uses gnome, Kubuntu uses KDE
2008-06-12T14:31:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	i see
2008-06-12T14:32:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	since xubuntu uses ext3 then i suppose it would be possible to reduce the partition size if not all space is used
2008-06-12T14:33:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	is that correct?
2008-06-12T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	parted can resize partitions, just make sure you backup first. Ive not done it myself as I plan my partitions before comitting them to the drive
2008-06-12T14:34:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	many thanks
2009-11-24T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mr_boo	its part of a kernel install postinst, you can manually run: sudo update-grub
2009-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	mr_boo	ActionParsnip	thanks
