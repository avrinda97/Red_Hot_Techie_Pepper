2008-09-06T19:02:00.000Z	wers		i just bought a laptop. it has 160gb hd. is it fine to make 5 partitions on it? I'm going to install 3 OSs and the two other partitions are for /home and swap
2008-09-06T19:03:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	4 primary partis are allowed, but you can create an extended on each that can contain more than enough partis
2008-09-06T19:05:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	so what do you advise?
2008-09-06T19:06:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	which oss'es?
2008-09-06T19:07:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	how do I do that if only 4 partitions are allowed and I want a /home partition?
2008-09-06T19:08:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	which oss'es?  extended partis can contain more than enough partitions witjin themselves
2008-09-06T19:09:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	'm planning to install  my main ubuntu, xp, and a light OS like damn small linux
2008-09-06T19:11:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	start up with ubuntu, choose manual partition, reserve one primary for win ,have to extended for linux
2008-09-06T19:13:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	i know how to partition. i just dont know how I can manage to install all those 3 operating systems
2008-09-06T19:14:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	take a sheet and plan your sizing, then simply use ubuntu installer to partition
2008-09-06T19:16:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	I have a plan already.  18 gb for my main ubuntu root partition, 12 gb for windows xp, 1 gb for the light OS, and the rest for my home partition. I also need one more for swap. is that feasible?
2008-09-06T19:17:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	ooh. that's not a problem because i can have 4 partitions and 1 swap, right? :D
2008-09-06T19:25:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	you can 4 Primary partis BUT in each an extend in within you can have multiple partis
2008-09-06T19:26:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	can I make one partition with the mini OS and swap on it? hehe
2008-09-06T19:31:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	I already have four partitions now. how do I make "subpartitions"?
2008-09-06T19:36:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	: new > extended at the second main
2008-09-06T19:37:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	I'm sorry. Where do i find "extended at the second main"?
2008-09-06T19:38:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	I did it! :D
2008-09-06T19:39:00.000Z	wers	ScheissDrogen	thanks! is it okay if my swap is just a sub parti in an extended parti?
2008-09-06T19:50:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	sry, busy, yes
2008-09-09T07:39:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	wers	lspci or hwinfo
