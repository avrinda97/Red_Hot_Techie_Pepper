2006-11-11T11:22:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	random loss of connectivity, ifconfig shows the link is still up and there are no lost packets. i tried different networks with different internet gateways and dhcp server and also different network cards even a wireless card. the issue is the same on all
2006-11-11T11:23:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	Sorry, not sure I can help you. :(
2006-11-11T11:25:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	does this happen when you're using it, or when it's idle? perhaps it's going into standby? *shrug*
2006-11-11T11:26:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	well, i am always using ssh on to and from it, both disconecct as do instant messengers/downloads etc
2006-11-11T11:26:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	anything of use in syslog?
2006-11-11T11:27:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	nope :/
2006-11-11T11:27:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	Other people on the network don't see the problem, I'm assuming.
2006-11-11T11:28:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	different networks, and no they certainly dont
2006-11-11T11:28:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	oh.. wierd
2006-11-11T11:28:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	you'd think syslog would say *Something*
2006-11-11T11:28:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	Have you tried disabling acpi?
2006-11-11T11:29:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	how long does it last?
2006-11-11T11:29:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	you say the if appears UP while it's not working?
2006-11-11T11:29:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	3 or 4 seconds
2006-11-11T11:29:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	yep, i did a while true loop every second on ifconfig eth0 and it was up
2006-11-11T11:31:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	Do you have other O/S on that box that works fine?
2006-11-11T11:31:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	nope
2006-11-11T11:31:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	will test it with a live cd tomorrow
2006-11-11T11:31:00.000Z	skreet_	variant	Was this working before? Or is this a fresh install
2006-11-11T11:32:00.000Z	variant	skreet_	i had the same issue on edgy which i upgraded from dapper months ago, before that was gentoo with no issues. this is currently a fresh install of edgy
