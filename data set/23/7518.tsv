2005-07-07T08:41:00.000Z	Peaker		kde is nice ;)
2005-07-07T08:41:00.000Z	Peaker		I tried gnome here and there along the years, and I can't get past its awful default look :)
2005-07-07T08:41:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	I don't know if you've noticed but gnome looks have changed over time :)
2005-07-07T08:42:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	perhaps, but kde's default look always looked much better :)  And I don't like messing around with themes too much
2005-07-07T08:43:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	KDE is a system, moreso than Gnome I'd say :)
2005-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	KIOSlaves/KParts/KUILib are most of what you see and use in KDE, apps just glue them together
2005-07-07T08:48:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	why would you need to
2005-07-07T08:51:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	Seveas: In KDE you are able to script the behaviour of every component on the system. This lets you control and configure multiple desktops from one place easily, it lets you use and communicate with existing gui apps in your applications, etc. etc
2005-07-07T08:52:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	and in GNOME, stuff Just Works. Better.
2005-07-07T08:52:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	hmm.. I beg to differ :) I find KDE apps are of much higher quality most of the time
2005-08-24T05:12:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	no need, simplt go to system-> administration->networking
2005-08-24T05:12:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	In what program? I don't have X working yet
2005-08-24T05:13:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	X didn't work out of the box (VAIO fs laptop, I think it needs newer nVidia drivers :(  )
2005-08-24T05:13:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	X should work automatically
2005-08-24T05:13:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	if you just want dhcp use 'sudo dhclient'
2005-08-24T05:13:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	There's no way to rerun the (very nice) network configurator from the installer?
2005-08-24T05:13:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	not afaik
2005-08-24T05:16:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	why, there's no need
2005-08-24T05:18:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	There's no need to..?
2005-08-24T05:19:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	run the tool again
2005-08-24T05:19:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	it's assumed you actually set it up the first time :)
2005-08-24T05:23:00.000Z	Peaker	HrdwrBoB	I need to run the tool again because I'm modifying my network configuration... (Physically reconnecting it)
2005-08-24T05:23:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Peaker	you can edit /etc/networking/interfaces
