2004-10-13T14:00:00.000Z	akra		no - I plugged it in after I had got X working :)
2004-10-13T14:01:00.000Z	akra		this is a 1GB one - doesn't say secure on it
2004-10-13T14:02:00.000Z	burner_	akra	nope
2004-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	akra		well, it's consistent at least!
2004-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	burner_		as a side note... i have a fat32 partition mounted to /files and it doesn't show up in computer -> disks either
2004-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	burner_		:\
2004-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	akra		how odd. my ntfs partition is showing up fine in /c
2004-10-13T14:03:00.000Z	burner_	akra	can you do a "cat /etc/fstab | grep sda1" for me?
2004-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	akra		doesn't exist
2004-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	burner_		my partition works if i browse to /files... it's mounted and all... but doesn't show up under "computer"
2004-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	burner_		how does it work if it's not in fstab?
2004-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	burner_		i'm so lost
2004-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	akra		closest is: "/dev/sda        /media/usb0     auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0"
2004-10-13T14:04:00.000Z	burner_		and that's where your data is for your drive when you plug it in?
2004-10-13T14:05:00.000Z	burner_		hrm
2004-10-13T14:05:00.000Z	akra		nope - its in sda1
2004-10-13T14:05:00.000Z	burner_		:)  mounting /dev/sda worked!!
2004-10-13T14:05:00.000Z	akra		well..  /media/sda1
2004-10-13T14:05:00.000Z	akra	burner_	cool
2004-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	burner_		the whole reason I went to ubuntu was for gnome 2.8's auto picking up adn mounting usb drives though :\
2004-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	burner_		so i guess that's next steap
2004-10-13T14:06:00.000Z	burner_		step even
2004-10-13T14:07:00.000Z	burner_	akra	i assume you didn't edit your /etc/fstab by hand?
