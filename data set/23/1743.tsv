2009-11-06T21:38:00.000Z	M3MNY		Can anyone help me with port forwarding so i can check the status of torrents in Transmission when away from home?
2009-11-06T21:38:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	you want a remote access to transmission?
2009-11-06T21:39:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	why transmission?
2009-11-06T21:39:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	yes, i do :)
2009-11-06T21:39:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	becuse that is the one that comes with Ubuntu, and it works fairly well.. light weight etc
2009-11-06T21:39:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	i would most likely go with rtorrent, personally
2009-11-06T21:42:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	no ideas then?
2009-11-06T21:42:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	i know there are web front ends for rtorrent AND ktorrent
2009-11-06T21:42:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	i bet there exists a web interface for transmission, but i would be hard pressed to use it for ubuntu
2009-11-06T21:42:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	it is incredibly light weight, too much so
2009-11-06T21:43:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	there is a web interface.. a fairly good one. by defualt, it is at 'YoutIP':9091/transmission/web
2009-11-06T21:44:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	ok, so from the outside it says this port is closed?
2009-11-06T21:44:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	and this is your problem??
2009-11-06T21:45:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	if you've enabled port forwarding and set the port and IP correctly, and if your IP has not changed, then the only suggestion I would make is to bridge your modem
2009-11-06T21:46:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	what is bridging? and how would i do it?
2009-11-06T21:46:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	you need access to the modem, and then you set its mode to "Bridge"
2009-11-06T21:46:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	i dont know your set up, i assume you have modem -> router -> laptop
2009-11-06T21:47:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	hmm.. i will have a look. thank you
2009-11-06T21:47:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	np
2009-11-06T21:47:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	its more like.. web > router > wireless home network
2009-11-06T21:47:00.000Z	kaneda^	M3MNY	is your modem also your router?
2009-11-06T21:49:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	yes, it is. and i can't find a thing for turning on bridging
2009-11-06T21:54:00.000Z	M3MNY	kaneda^	yes, it is. and i can't find a thing for turning on bridging
