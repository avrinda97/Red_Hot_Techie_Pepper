2008-05-04T05:05:00.000Z	xyzpaw		jesus ubuntu makes installing things incredibly difficult
2008-05-04T05:05:00.000Z	xyzpaw		no zelrink i just did a fresh install of xubuntu 8.04
2008-05-04T05:06:00.000Z	xyzpaw		yes?
2008-05-04T05:07:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	"ubuntu makes installing things incredibly difficult" wow u have no idea how funny that looks to people who've been using Ubuntu  and any unix for a while, lemme scroll up, we can help you, keep faith :)
2008-05-04T05:10:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	aha! the add/remove does very simple tasks only, theyre's a more fully featured software installing package under Administration>Synaptic Package Manager, oops, not in there it seems
2008-05-04T05:11:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	yes, i suggest looking for midnight commander, a handy simple filemanager that runs in a termminal, search/install that as a test using synaptic pakcage manager
2008-05-04T05:17:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	zelrikriando: i'm thinking its a .tgz installer not in APT, so needs to run the .tgz from the I2P project website, am i up to speed?
2008-05-04T05:20:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	ok, i just arrived halfway into your problem, but it seems u are wanting to install I2P, but its not automatically installlable using the normal ubuntu methods, i see on the I2P website there is a .tgz file to download
2008-05-04T05:20:00.000Z	xyzpaw	gord_	should i download it
2008-05-04T05:21:00.000Z	xyzpaw	gord_	could you please link me to it
2008-05-04T05:21:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	now, to use these "non-APT" methods, you have to sort out any neccessary "extras" yourself, but we can talk u thur the basics of doing the .tgz bit
2008-05-04T05:22:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	http://www.i2p2.de/download  is the page, but there are two files, "headless" and , err another (lol)
2008-05-04T05:22:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	:"source" is the other, i assume u need the headless one?
2008-05-04T05:23:00.000Z	xyzpaw	gord_	i have no idea what you're talking about
2008-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	ah ok, well the application does something (i dont evenknwo exactly what, u are the expert there lol) BUT it seems to be installed on a second machine, a linux machine, that you will route these "things" you are using I2P for ? does that make any sense to you?
2008-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	gord_	xyzpaw	i not a fast typer lol. I assume its for privacy u need the I2P program yes?
2008-05-04T05:27:00.000Z	xyzpaw	gord_	??/
