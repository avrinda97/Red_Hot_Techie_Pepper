2009-12-28T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	  Just because you say taht.. dosetn mean theres not any for it in linux
2009-12-28T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 if theres no linux drivers  for it.. then it wont work..
2009-12-28T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 there may exist some old drivers for it.. or nor..
2009-12-28T22:14:00.000Z	evergrenn	Dr_Willis	old acer scan prisa 320p
2009-12-28T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 meams very little to me. Check google and the sane homepage to see if its supported at all
2009-12-28T22:16:00.000Z	evergrenn	Dr_Willis	xsane Unsupported  there are only drivers for Win XP
2009-12-28T22:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 looks like its time to get a new scanner if the xsane homepage dosent mention the device
2009-12-28T22:18:00.000Z	evergrenn	Dr_Willis	I do not understand much Italian
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 if the xsane homepage does not mention the scanner.. or says its not supported.. then its not supported.
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 a lotof old scanners have no linux support
2009-12-28T22:21:00.000Z	evergrenn	Dr_Willis	 I thought that some guru could, because for win xp there are idrivers
2009-12-28T22:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 with that logic there wiould be drivers for everything...  and thats not true.
2009-12-28T22:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 i imagine theres no drivers for it for Vista or win7 either...
2009-12-29T20:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 if you mean it dident appear.. thats because its a cli tool.. there are gui front ends
2009-12-29T20:09:00.000Z	evergrenn	Dr_Willis	What should I apply?
2009-12-29T20:12:00.000Z	evergrenn	Dr_Willis	 What should I apply to show clamav on the taskbar?
2009-12-29T20:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 No idea.  thers  an av wiki page or 2 out there.
2009-12-29T20:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 checck the package manager for clamav - theres really no need for it to show on the 'taskbar' youi use it to scan  a location and then its done.
2009-12-29T20:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evergrenn	 you do realize its main job is tojust scan your windows files for windows viruses right?
