2009-07-28T01:30:00.000Z	helo		if i put a 1GB UNR .img onto a 4GB thumb drive, how can i use the extra 3GB for file storage?
2009-07-28T01:30:00.000Z	deany	helo	make 2 partitions
2009-07-28T01:32:00.000Z	helo	deany	after writing the .img to the thumb drive, the partition table appears to be invalid...
2009-07-28T01:35:00.000Z	deany	helo	what partition setup have you got on it
2009-07-28T01:36:00.000Z	helo	deany	the same partition table that is on the UNR live image
2009-07-28T01:36:00.000Z	helo	deany	which happens to be invalid...

2009-07-28T01:38:00.000Z	helo	deany	i know how to dd an .img onto a drive
2009-07-28T01:39:00.000Z	deany	helo	format 1 partition as fat32 for the UNR and the other as, I guess whatever.
2009-07-28T01:39:00.000Z	deany	helo	write img to it, it works, I use it
2009-07-28T01:40:00.000Z	deany	helo	 do you want persistence?
2009-07-28T02:02:00.000Z	helo	deany	the problem with creating two partitions on a thumb drive before writing the ubuntu live .img to it, is that the UNR .img will overwrite the partition table
2009-07-28T02:03:00.000Z	deany	helo	ive done it....
2009-07-28T02:04:00.000Z	deany	helo	you not writing it properly then... /dev/sdb1 not /dev/sdb
2009-07-28T02:05:00.000Z	deany	helo	I have a 16gb usb with UNR on first partition, and another partition for other stuff. ive written to the first partition multiple times, clonezilla, then UNR, then clonezilla, then UNR.. i`ll get myself another stick 1 day.
2009-07-28T02:09:00.000Z	helo	deany	hmm... i've never heard of writing a live image to the first partition... i thought they were intended to be written directly to the block device
2009-07-28T02:09:00.000Z	helo	deany	and the link you pasted says to write it to the block device, not the first partition
2009-07-28T02:12:00.000Z	deany	helo	ive never written to a block device.
2009-07-28T02:13:00.000Z	deany	helo	always /dev/sdb1
2009-07-28T02:13:00.000Z	deany	helo	etc
2009-07-28T02:14:00.000Z	deany	helo	formatted a partition already?
2009-07-28T02:17:00.000Z	helo	deany	yeah, i'm waiting for the .img to finish downloading
2009-07-28T02:37:00.000Z	helo	deany	your method appears to have failed
