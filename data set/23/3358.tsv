2008-05-07T06:14:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma		Ubuntu won't install on my computer, can anyone help me with this problem?
2008-05-07T06:15:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	probably can help, but need to boil it down some, what computer, what is happening, what error messages
2008-05-07T06:21:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	 I'm trying to install ubuntu 8.04 on my computer.  I am using a clone computer (not a brand name comupter) with an amd athlon processer, 390mb ram, 7 gigs of hard disk space, and currently running windows 2000.  I put the disk in and when it goes to the install screen and I hit install it goes to a completely black screen with only a cursor in the upper left
2008-05-07T06:22:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	did you checksum the iso before you burned it? what video card are you using, perhaps choose F4 at the menu screen and choose safe graphics mode from there, if you have a wierd piece of hardware perhaps even an alternate install cd may be required
2008-05-07T06:23:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	  I bought the CD from one of the places ubuntu reccomended
2008-05-07T06:24:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	nod, its probably a good disk then, have you tried the f4 and safe graphics option at the boot menu yet?
2008-05-07T06:25:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	I'll try that now, if it doesn
2008-05-07T06:25:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	cool I'll be back and forth from the KB but I'll keep an eye out for you
2008-05-07T06:41:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	the same thing happened in safe graphics mode.
2008-05-07T06:44:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	okay so its just hanging up on boot yeah?
2008-05-07T06:46:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	if you have a good internet connection I'd recommend perhaps downloading an ISO from http://www.ubuntu.com just in case you got a dud, I'm not sure why your system won't finish booting
2008-05-07T06:55:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	I think it's my computer because it's a piece of junk.
2008-05-07T06:56:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	I'm not sure why its not letting you boot, when I have stubborn hardware I won't fight with it on a livecd I just go download an alternate install cd and go that way
2008-05-07T06:58:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	I don't have a very great burner at my disposal and I'm not sure which one to get.
2008-05-07T06:59:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	pioneer, plextor, sony, dell surplus, just about anything will work. I use pricewatch and newegg to buy my gear myself, if your wanting one tonight you may have to shuck it on down to a brick and mortar where you live though
2008-05-07T07:02:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	are you talking about computers or alternate install cds
2008-05-07T07:16:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	are you there?
2008-05-07T07:18:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	hi, sorry am learning how to set up LVM
2008-05-07T07:18:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	whats up?
2008-05-07T07:20:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	I asked if you were talking about computers or alternate install CDs
2008-05-07T07:22:00.000Z	Tuojalta_Surma	starcannon	I was talking about alternate install CDs
2008-05-07T07:22:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	ah lol, got crossed up. Tuojalta_Surma another option if you have a windows install there would be to see if wubi will let you get it installed, the problem is to ambiguous for my level of expertise unfortunately
2008-05-07T07:25:00.000Z	starcannon	Tuojalta_Surma	sorry I couldn't get you solved :(   but blinking cursor in corner of screen isn't alot for my level of ability to go on :(
