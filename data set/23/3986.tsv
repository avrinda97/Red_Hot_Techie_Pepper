2007-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	RoDoX		pitruntu: i did it as well, and then I uninstalled FF. Once i already had automatix2, it got the MPlayer for firerox and the flash plugin but it still didnt work
2007-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	RoDoX		although ppl in here says that automatix2 is not recommended...
2007-12-17T00:54:00.000Z	RoDoX		i also realized that FF is too "heavy" on my machine...The browser consumes up to 76MB of ram with 2 tabs opened up...is that normal?
2007-12-17T00:55:00.000Z	RoDoX		have they (mozilla) fixed it? =P
2007-12-17T00:57:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	firefox memorize past pages
2007-12-17T00:55:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	yes :-(
2007-12-17T00:55:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	what about FF3 'gran paradiso'?
2007-12-17T00:55:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	i don't know, but I don't think they're going to work on it. FF works fine on newer computers
2007-12-17T00:56:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	try to disabled fast forward-rewind
2007-12-17T00:57:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	fast forward-rewind?
2007-12-17T00:58:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	but that happens only when the machine gets turned off accidentally...then it memorize the last pages you visited...right
2007-12-17T00:58:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	no, rodox
2007-12-17T00:58:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	it keeps in mind the last 3-4-5 pages you visited in order to let you go back more fast (with the back button)
2007-12-17T00:59:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	also watchout for the extensions you use, some have some serious memory leak http://kb.mozillazine.org/Problematic_extensions
2007-12-17T00:59:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	you know, i realized that even minimized, the 'firefox-bin' keeps screwing up my memory eating it so much...
2007-12-17T01:01:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	firefox is heavy. that's widely-accepted truth. you can only try to get things a little better. like http://howto.helpero.com/howto/Reduce-Firefox-Memory-Usage_4.html
2007-12-17T01:04:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	thanks for the links. i'm gonna take a look at them right now...but i really think that mozilla should study this case a lot in order to make FF to become 'hungryless'...and the only addon im using is the mcafee site advisor...nothing that much heavy...5MB
2007-12-17T01:31:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	applied all tips from the page you told me and this is what i got: 50,7MB(w/ 2 tabs) instead of 76,3MB -- :-)
2007-12-17T01:32:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	yeah mn...thx! XD
2007-12-17T01:39:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	...lthough for some reason it keeps using the same amount of memory when minimized, as if it was maximized >/
2007-12-17T01:40:00.000Z	tacone	RoDoX	you can set that behaviour on about:config
2007-12-17T01:51:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	it doesnt work. awkward
2007-12-17T01:53:00.000Z	RoDoX	tacone	you know what? im gonna try out the new version and see if the problem continues..
