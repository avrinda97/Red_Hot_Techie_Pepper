2007-12-17T02:51:00.000Z	Felin		Ah, if anyone has time, I'm having a bit of trouble getting my Linksys USB Wireless adapter to work, as a warning I'm still completely new at this sort of thing.
2007-12-17T02:52:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	how far have you got
2007-12-17T02:53:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	hey no worries, first off whats the model
2007-12-17T02:54:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	u in xp at the mo right? are u using encryption on your access point and if so wep or wpa?
2007-12-17T02:57:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	just checking how well its supported or not...
2007-12-17T03:02:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	looks like your card does work, when u boot into ubuntu, go to the network manager tool, does it list a wireless device? u can also check from a terminal with the command 'iwlist' does it return the name of a device with wireless extensions
2007-12-17T03:03:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	also look at the output of  and make a note 'lshw -C network'
2007-12-17T03:04:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	not from a normal install, possibly from within a virtual machine
2007-12-17T03:06:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	good luck
2007-12-17T03:44:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	thats on xp not the router
2007-12-17T03:25:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	what did u find
2007-12-17T03:28:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	could u see no available networks to join?
2007-12-17T03:28:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	is this a laptop / model?
2007-12-17T03:29:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	actually  ignore that , if you say you saw a network temporarily then we know that the card is pretty much working
2007-12-17T03:30:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	if you have broadcast essid off in the AP you wont see it, did you try configuring a connection and using the essid ?
2007-12-17T03:31:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	sorry, your access point is configured to use a name to identify it this is the essid, do you know what this is or was it set when you got the access point?
2007-12-17T03:35:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	xp, you should be able to see the name of the wireless network you're connected to, does that say default?
2007-12-17T03:42:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	ok u need to ascertain the name used by the AP to continue so you can do it by accessing the administration page of the AP or possibly from memory through settings, network connections and fishing around in the properties
2007-12-17T03:43:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	through settings, network connections, should see the wireless conn. icon open properties and so on
2007-12-17T03:48:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	thats it WLAN ok now go into ubuntu and create a wireless connection using this as the ssid with encryption off, you did say there is no encryption on? try this, if it doesn't work from a terminal type ' sudo iwlist scan' this will show a list of wireless networks in range, can u see yours?
2007-12-17T03:49:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	can u remember what name the wireless device had in ubuntu, might be wlan0?
2007-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	then if what I said did not work, in terminal look at the output of 'iwconfig wlan0' it will show you the wireless settings so essid should be now set to 'WLAN' if it worked, if not try at the prompt 'sudo iwconfig wan0 essid WLAN' but check that command 'man iwconfig'
2007-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	Brownster	Felin	*wlan0 not wan0
