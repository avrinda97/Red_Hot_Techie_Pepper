2009-07-07T09:17:00.000Z	yxz97		I'm doing some coding in objectiveC
2009-07-07T09:17:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	watch the caps its the same as yelling
2009-07-07T09:19:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	what are you looking to program? Script? c++/java?
2009-07-07T09:22:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	you might try and see if Eclipse can support ObjectiveC
2009-07-07T09:23:00.000Z	yxz97	iamtechno	yeah, seems like CDT can be modified to work with objectiveC compiler but, is complicated put it to work seems like
2009-07-07T09:23:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	I used to use nano when I first was doing cmd line programming
2009-07-07T09:28:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	You could run Notepad++ under Winw
2009-07-07T09:34:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	try the vim-gnome package
2009-07-07T09:38:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	were you checking out from a repository, like SVN or CVS?
2009-07-07T09:38:00.000Z	yxz97	iamtechno	yeah man !
2009-07-07T09:38:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	What were you try to check out?
2009-07-07T09:39:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	I meant what specific code?
2009-07-07T09:41:00.000Z	yxz97	iamtechno	sorry man, no more then :)
2009-07-07T09:42:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	Then they don't want prying eyes. Ask the developers for a key and get Ubuntu to accept it the you should be good to go.
2009-07-07T09:43:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	doing what you were doing is just asking to be booted. Just trying to help save you from not getting you the help that you need/want
2009-07-07T09:46:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	Then just enter it manually everytime you're asked instead of storing it.
2009-07-07T09:46:00.000Z	yxz97	iamtechno	but what password???
2009-07-07T09:48:00.000Z	iamtechno	yxz97	rem !enter. Yes, some code repositories have passwords so joe plummer doesn't check it out and hack it.
