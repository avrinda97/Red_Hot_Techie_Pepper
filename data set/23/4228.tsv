2007-11-01T04:26:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	what other names would the group plugdev be listed as?
2007-11-01T04:21:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	yes just create a new user in Users and Groups
2007-11-01T04:21:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	new users by default are not in admin group, so no sudo access
2007-11-01T04:22:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	you can remove the user from other groups like floppy, lpadmin, etc... to remove abilities
2007-11-01T04:22:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	ok i did that but now im trying to use this user to share an ssh network share and it can still read/write my storage drive when at most i want it  to only read
2007-11-01T04:23:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	so you have a storage drive mounted under /media with access for all users then, the way to fix this is to make the storage volume writable only to a group instead of all users
2007-11-01T04:24:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	fair enough i havent been able to get around to converting it to reiserfs or ext3 yet its still in ntfs can i just apply that setting to /media/WDSata320 ?
2007-11-01T04:25:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	ok a better question would be if i can do that what group should i make it available to?
2007-11-01T04:25:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	or groups
2007-11-01T04:25:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	remove the user from plugdev should fix it actually, sorry
2007-11-01T04:25:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	I think it's already set up so only plugdev members can write
2007-11-01T04:26:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	what do you mean, where are you looking?
2007-11-01T04:28:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	 system / administration / User settings / Group settings dialogue
2007-11-01T04:29:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	yeah that doesn't seem to show groups <100... if you click on a user and then properties, then user priveleges tab, uncheck the first one about external storage devices
2007-11-01T04:30:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	its just a sata drive in ntfs its still plugged directly into the mobo just not in ext3 yet so maybe thats y that setting hasnt worked because i left this user with no special privileges
2007-11-01T04:34:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	i guess thats why im having troubles
2007-11-01T04:38:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	well ill try to remove user "guest" from plugdev
2008-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	replace mount with ln -s
2008-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	thanks
2008-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	and no sudo
2008-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	is there a way to make it appear as the name Music
2008-01-23T09:24:00.000Z	astro76	Chamunks	it will be available under /home/user/Music/ with that command
2008-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	Chamunks	astro76	i see that well thats good enough thanks lots!!
