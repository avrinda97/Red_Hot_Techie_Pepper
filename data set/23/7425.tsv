2006-02-22T09:13:00.000Z	ryman		how do I copy files into /usr/share/pixmaps/ ?
2006-02-22T09:14:00.000Z	catskul	ryman	what would keep you from doing so ?
2006-02-22T09:14:00.000Z	catskul		!xgl
2006-02-22T09:14:00.000Z	ryman		I don't see pixmaps folder in share directory
2006-02-22T09:14:00.000Z	ryman	catskul	I'm new to linux. I'm trying to locate pixmaps folder
2006-02-22T09:14:00.000Z	catskul	ryman	i think its someting like /usr/share/pixmaps
2006-02-22T09:15:00.000Z	ryman	catskul	it said that i don't have permission to move files from / to /usr/share/pixmaps
2006-02-22T09:15:00.000Z	catskul	ryman	are you familiar with using sudo ?
2006-02-22T09:16:00.000Z	catskul	ryman	use  "sudo cp ...."
2006-02-22T09:16:00.000Z	ryman	catskul	sorry no. I'm totally new to linux
2006-02-22T09:16:00.000Z	catskul	ryman	have you used the terminal before ?
2006-02-22T09:16:00.000Z	ryman		Can you give me an example ? the file i'm trying to move is icon.ico
2006-02-22T09:17:00.000Z	ryman	catskul	yes
2006-02-22T09:17:00.000Z	catskul		so in the terminal
2006-02-22T09:17:00.000Z	ryman		sudo cp icon.ico /user/share/pixmaps
2006-02-22T09:17:00.000Z	ryman		?
2006-02-22T09:17:00.000Z	catskul		yep

2006-02-22T09:17:00.000Z	catskul		np
2006-02-22T09:18:00.000Z	ryman	catskul	opps it doesn't work. I think I need the path to desktop
2006-02-22T09:19:00.000Z	catskul		yeah... for that to work you would have had to have been in the same directory as the file at the time
2006-02-22T09:20:00.000Z	ryman		how do I change to desktop dir? I'm sorry I will look up for unix commands on google later
2006-02-22T09:20:00.000Z	catskul	ryman	cd ~/Desktop
