2010-11-04T23:42:00.000Z	onexused		After failing to upgrade my system to Ubuntu 10.10, any action I take with apt-get gives me something like this: http://dpaste.org/CWUa/ .  How can I fix this?
2010-11-04T23:43:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	sudo apt-get safe-upgrade
2010-11-04T23:43:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	sudo apt-get install -f    (tries to fix all broken packages)
2010-11-04T23:43:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade might be useful too.  To try to finish the version upgrade.
2010-11-04T23:45:00.000Z	onexused	edbian	You didn't read the pastebin : )  apt-get -f install is one of the commands that gives me that error.  Trying dist-upgrade, though I think it'll do the same thing.
2010-11-04T23:45:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	You called my bluff!
2010-11-04T23:46:00.000Z	onexused	edbian	Looks like dist-upgrade gives me that error, too.
2010-11-04T23:47:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	mmmm, odd.
2010-11-04T23:47:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	Have you tried purging or reinstalling that troublesome package?
2010-11-04T23:49:00.000Z	onexused	edbian	Packages, I think.  Way too many deps to do that.
2010-11-04T23:49:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	mmm, I'm not sure! :(
2010-11-04T23:50:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	sudo apt-get -f install xulrunner
2010-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	onexused	edbian	Incidentally, that's the second thing I tried.  "E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution)."
2010-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	sudo aptitude install -f
2010-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	aptitude is smarter
2010-11-05T00:01:00.000Z	onexused	edbian	Any other ideas?
2010-11-05T00:01:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	no :(
2010-11-05T00:01:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	(besides removing it)
2010-11-05T00:01:00.000Z	onexused	edbian	What, Ubuntu?
2010-11-05T00:02:00.000Z	onexused	edbian	Trying to remove xulrunner tells me it's not installed.
2010-11-05T00:02:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	no no, removing the package, all the dependencies, reinstalling everything
2010-11-05T00:02:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	oh ?
2010-11-05T00:02:00.000Z	edbian	onexused	I guess it's stuck 1/2 way
