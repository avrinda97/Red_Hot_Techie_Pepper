2009-02-11T23:27:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		Hi all
2009-02-11T23:27:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		I recently shifted from Ubuntu to Ubuntu 64
2009-02-11T23:27:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		I installed Desktop Effects
2009-02-11T23:27:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		but it hasn't come in my menu...
2009-02-11T23:28:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-02-11T23:28:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	thanks I will try that now
2009-02-11T23:31:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	do I need Desktop Effects anymore ? it was for KDE though
2009-02-11T23:32:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	i think it's all part of it... what version of ubuntu?
2009-02-11T23:32:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	8.10
2009-02-11T23:33:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	then go to visual effects
2009-02-11T23:33:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	where?
2009-02-11T23:33:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	system, preferences, appearance, visual effects
2009-02-11T23:33:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	ahh, well I have done that
2009-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	is compiz working?
2009-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	I selected the Extra option
2009-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	yes it is working after I installed the compizconfig settings manager as you told
2009-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	ok in the terminal you can type ccsm to get to it
2009-02-11T23:35:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	but I was wondering if that desktop effects thing I installed earlier was any useful
2009-02-11T23:35:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	desktop-effects-kde to be precice
2009-02-11T23:36:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	i think it's kind of an obselete thing. sort of like the lite version of compiz
2009-02-11T23:37:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	ok I removed it and everything is fine, I used it before on ?Ubuntu 8.04 32 bit one so installed that one here as well...
2009-02-11T23:38:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	xaos11	thanks for your help
2009-02-11T23:40:00.000Z	xaos11	dhruvasagar	have fun with compiz!
