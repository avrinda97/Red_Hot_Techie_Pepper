2006-10-24T15:13:00.000Z	michael		resolv.conf says not to edit it, that it will be overwritten
2006-10-24T15:13:00.000Z	jimmypw	michael	whats wrong?
2006-10-24T15:14:00.000Z	michael	jimmypw	i can't ping anything.  i have no dns
2006-10-24T15:14:00.000Z	jimmypw		can you ping ip address'?
2006-10-24T15:14:00.000Z	michael		i set it in resolv.conf but apparently that file gets overwriettin
2006-10-24T15:15:00.000Z	michael	jimmypw	i don't have any outside my network to try, but i'm pretty sure i could

2006-10-24T15:20:00.000Z	michael	jimmypw	not sure, i just know they got overwritten.  that's where i put them too.  but it says at the top that resolv.conf gets overwritten
