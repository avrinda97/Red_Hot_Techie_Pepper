2007-01-28T08:51:00.000Z	glyn		nevermind easier than I thought
2007-01-28T08:51:00.000Z	glyn		wait it's not
2007-01-28T08:52:00.000Z	glyn		thanks that worked
2007-01-28T08:54:00.000Z	glyn		how do I get read/write access to my kernel source tree?
2007-01-28T08:55:00.000Z	glyn		I'm trying to build a driver for my kernel
2007-01-28T08:55:00.000Z	glyn		how do I get read/write access to the kernel source tree?
2007-01-28T08:56:00.000Z	glyn		okay I just logged in as root how do I get back to my user?
2007-01-28T08:56:00.000Z	glyn		thanks
2007-01-28T08:57:00.000Z	glyn		frogzoo:I did that command udo chown -R glyn:glyn /usr/src/spca5xx-20060501
2007-01-28T08:57:00.000Z	glyn		and it's still telling me that I need read/write access to my kernel source tree
2007-01-28T08:58:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	you mean sudo, not udo ;)
2007-01-28T09:00:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	you should probably use sudo -i to get a root prompt. you should chown stuff in /usr, usually
2007-01-28T09:01:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	should not chown *
2007-01-28T09:02:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	did you see that? don't chown stuff under /usr. use sudo -i to get a root prompt if you get access denied in /usr/src
2007-01-28T09:03:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	please chown it back to root:src or whatever it was
2007-01-28T09:04:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	sudo chown -R root.src /usr/src
2007-01-28T09:05:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	careful with the command
2007-01-28T09:05:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	making typos with chown can hose the system
2007-01-28T09:51:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	remove it and rebuild it
2007-01-28T09:52:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	not succesfully, appearently
2007-02-17T13:25:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	probably 192.168.0.1 or 10.0.0.1 or something like that. depends on setup/router
2007-02-17T13:25:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	it will be on the same subnet as your own IP
2007-02-17T13:26:00.000Z	mwe	glyn	But some routers requires a port as well like 10.0.0.1:2033 or some other port specific to the router
