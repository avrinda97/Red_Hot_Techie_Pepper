2008-01-20T05:06:00.000Z	techgeek40		I'm getting retarded - how do I look into the sources.list ?
2008-01-20T05:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	what are you trying to do exactly?
2008-01-20T05:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	its probably all gonna be greek to you, why are you looking at your sources
2008-01-20T05:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	and why do you think your repository listing has something to dow ith that?.. all the repos do is install/remove software.
2008-01-20T05:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	so basically, you're not a computer tech.
2008-01-20T05:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	i worked in a fast food restaurant for 10yrs, i'm certainly not a chef
2008-01-27T04:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	i would think long and hard before following _snookie's advice
2008-01-27T04:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	you have an nvidia card, what card model?
2008-01-27T04:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	were you hear earlier, i'm pretty sure you were told you need the legacy driver
2008-01-27T04:36:00.000Z	techgeek40	IndyGunFreak	No I was in West Palm Beach Florida all day helping a friend move - it wasn't me
2008-01-27T04:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	ok.
2008-01-27T04:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	the modem is probably onboard, you just don't use it.
2008-01-27T04:47:00.000Z	techgeek40	IndyGunFreak	I don't have a modem - the mother board doesn't have it - and in the bios - nothing about modem is listed - that I can be 100% sure of -
2008-01-27T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	if you built your computer, then its even more likely you have an onboard modem, and you just didn't put the connections on it.
2008-01-27T04:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	i've done that numerous times
2008-01-27T04:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	you're not listening to a word i'm saying, so there's no reason to continue... but restricted, isn't going to just pick up hardware that isn't present, open a terminal and enter "lspci" and see if your modem is listed there
2008-01-27T04:52:00.000Z	techgeek40	IndyGunFreak	I am listening - two things: NO modem - that I promise you - this motherboard simply doesn't have one - there is no connection for in the back nor in the bios and even the manual clearly stats no onboard modem
2008-01-27T07:28:00.000Z	techgeek40	IndyGunFreak	Thank you - your suggestions helped a great deal
2008-01-27T07:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	no prob, glad you got it working
2008-01-27T09:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	what audio card is it?
2008-01-27T09:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	well, open a terminal and see what the output of lspci is(it should identify your sound card there), and tell me how it identifies it.
2008-01-27T09:11:00.000Z	techgeek40	IndyGunFreak	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53628/
2008-01-27T09:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	techgeek40	hmm, i know the Intel HDA devices, are a pain in the rump w/ Linux and Ubuntu, but you can get them working.
