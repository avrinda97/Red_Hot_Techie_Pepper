2009-06-20T17:43:00.000Z	JayX	mobi-sheep	 cant i change that to my "super" (windows key) Win+D  ??
2009-06-20T17:43:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	JayX	Sure.  Look under Shortcuts.
2009-06-20T17:45:00.000Z	JayX	mobi-sheep	 hmm is it also possible to configure the "media keys" (play pause etc. etc..) from shortcuts?
2009-06-20T17:46:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	JayX	You're talking about multimedia keys.  Read the message up there.  Every keyboard / layout are different.  Some will work, some may not, some will not.
