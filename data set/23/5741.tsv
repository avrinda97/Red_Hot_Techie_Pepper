2006-09-22T07:23:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn		hey, i'm running dapper on a rather long-in-tooth machine (mobile p3 @1.2 ghz w/256mb ram) and was wondering where i could go within GNOME to kill some apps and otherwise streamline my system
2006-09-22T07:23:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn		i found a 'services' tab in system, but it was of limited use
2006-09-22T07:24:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	what exactly are you trying to kill? you mean unneeded services/background processes?
2006-09-22T07:25:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn	rouben	 basically, yes.  i haven't any trouble with my desktop, but my laptop lags quite a bit under normal loads
2006-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	have you tried running top (or htop) or a GUI equivalent thereof? Usually Linux is pretty good at not wasting CPU cycles with sleeping processes
2006-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	chances are the lag is due to a slow video card
2006-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	or non-hardware accellerated video drivers :)
2006-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn	rouben	damn this gma830 all to hell
2006-09-22T07:27:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	?
2006-09-22T07:28:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn	rouben	haven't run top, or anything like that, but i can see how my antiquated gpu could be causing problems
2006-09-22T07:29:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	hehe, i see. Unfortunately X is quite sensitive to slow GPUs, in part due to its inefficient design and in part due to 99% of all drivers for X being software
2006-09-22T07:30:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn	rouben	well, that explains much. just ran top and everything seems to be fine (averaging about 12 percent cpu load)
2006-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	just to illustrate, when i was running the nv driver on my box with an nVidia Gefore4, my memory usage was around 500megs. When I switched to the binary driver, the memory usage almost went down 50%
2006-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	rouben		my guess is the nv driver used regular system ram instead of video ram! :(
2006-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn	rouben	wow.
2006-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	rouben		so yeah, drivers make a big diff
2006-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	rouben		especially if you run something heavyweight, like KDE or gnome
2006-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	have you considered xfce? might be just what your laptop needs :)
2006-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	apt-get install xubuntu-desktop, I believe
2006-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn	rouben	consider it considered, my friend
2006-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	rouben	i_am_the_pwn	well, give it a spin. if you want a preview, check the ubuntu website
2006-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn		rouben:thank you much
2006-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	i_am_the_pwn	rouben	auf Wiedersehen
