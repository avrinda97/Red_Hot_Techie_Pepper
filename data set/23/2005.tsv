2011-12-23T05:00:00.000Z	trism	mikere	nvidia-common is not the drivers package, you probably want nvidia-current
2011-12-23T05:00:00.000Z	mikere	trism	ah, thanks
2011-12-23T05:08:00.000Z	mikere	trism	pp7: if you are still available, I appear to be no further along.  xserver fails to start, can't find nvidia, modprobe can't load it.
2011-12-23T05:08:00.000Z	trism	mikere	uname -a and dkms status

2011-12-23T05:16:00.000Z	trism	mikere	looks fine, try: sudo modprobe nvidia-current; and check /var/log/kern.log for errors involving nvidia at the end
2011-12-23T05:16:00.000Z	mikere	trism	FATAL: Error inserting nvidia_current (/lib/modules/2.6.35-31-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia-current.ko): No such device

2011-12-23T05:24:00.000Z	trism	mikere	I'm really not sure, maybe nouveau loaded first? is it listed in lsmod?
2011-12-23T05:25:00.000Z	mikere	trism	I see nouveau in lsmod
2011-12-23T05:26:00.000Z	mikere	trism	is it possible it's not getting blacklisted?
2011-12-23T05:27:00.000Z	trism	mikere	yeah seems to be the case
2011-12-23T05:28:00.000Z	mikere	trism	any idea how to prevent it from loading?  I'd look it up but for some reason my web browsing ability seems to be almost non-existent right this minute
2011-12-23T05:28:00.000Z	trism	mikere	do you have an /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf? it should be blacklisting nouveau lbm-nouveau nvidia-173 nvidia-96 (although this is on lucid not maverick)
2011-12-23T05:29:00.000Z	mikere	trism	checking now
2011-12-23T05:29:00.000Z	trism	mikere	you should be able to copy the file there from /lib/nvidia-current/modprobe.conf
2011-12-23T05:30:00.000Z	mikere	trism	ok, it's got the blacklist there, I'll see if it's in /lib too
2011-12-23T05:30:00.000Z	mikere	trism	the blacklist is in nvidia-current/modprobe.conf as well ><
2011-12-23T05:32:00.000Z	mikere	trism	This problem just started when I upgraded my video card to 550 Ti - wonder if that's the problem
2011-12-23T05:35:00.000Z	trism	mikere	that may be it, quick search leads me to believe that card isn't supported with your nvidia version (doesn't seem to be added until 267.59
2011-12-23T05:37:00.000Z	mikere	trism	sounds right.
2011-12-23T05:42:00.000Z	mikere	trism	looks like I should distro upgrade to 11.04 so I can get 270+ nvidia driver for 550 ti support
2011-12-23T05:42:00.000Z	mikere	trism	 but thanks so much for all your efforts.
