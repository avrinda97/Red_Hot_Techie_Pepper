2009-10-01T03:59:00.000Z	mib_mib		Hi guys! I am trying to set up an apache2/nginx server behind my router - i have enabled port-forwarding on port 80, and set the server up correctly - i can access it correclty from localhost, but when I go to my IP on the web browser, i am not getting anything - how can I check?
2009-10-01T04:00:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	are you using public or private ip address in browser?
2009-10-01T04:01:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	i tried both the internal and external ip's
2009-10-01T04:01:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	neither worked
2009-10-01T04:03:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	you using nginix for load balance or revers proxy?
2009-10-01T04:03:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	the one thing I think i could have misconfigured, is the virtualconf file - I don't have a domain name like www.blah.com - i just want to use my ip address, but for servername and serveraliais, i just put bs stuff www.first.com and first.com
2009-10-01T04:04:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	reverse proxy - it handles the static content, and passes it through to apache for dyanmic stuff
2009-10-01T04:06:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	so why the reverse proxy setup...if its all local?
2009-10-01T04:06:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	and what do you have in your apache2 /var/www?
2009-10-01T04:07:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	i don't want it all to be local, rather, what i would like to do is be able to go to my ip address, and have a django project set up
2009-10-01T04:08:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	but i have apache set up with mod-wsgi for django
2009-10-01T04:08:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	so when i do like curl 127.0.0.1 i get some stuff back, but when i go to my ip address, i get nothing
2009-10-01T04:11:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	you seen this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Django
2009-10-01T04:14:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	i checked UFW and made sure that the rule to allow tcp on port 80 is enabled
2009-10-01T04:17:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	yah - i've set up this exact server before on a VPS, now i'm trying to set it up in the same way at my house, but for some reason i can't connect to it outside of my router
2009-10-01T04:18:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	hhmm...something is looking in the wrong place if you have django setup right...should start from basics
2009-10-01T04:20:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	well, i think one of my main problems is the router, and the second problem is maybe something having to do that i'm using a domain name but i don't actually have it registered maybe?
2009-10-01T04:22:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	yea instead of names use ip address...i dont have my domain linked to my ip yet so i do all my site editing via ip thru browser
2009-10-01T04:23:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	sorta what i just said aint it... =)
2009-10-01T04:32:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	if all ip info is good its coming down to the conf files
2009-10-01T04:36:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	yea check router setup
2009-10-01T04:39:00.000Z	stlsaint	mib_mib	i think there are too many hands in this issue...hope ya get it fixed...getting a little crowded! =)
2009-10-01T04:39:00.000Z	mib_mib	stlsaint	very much so, thanks!
