2010-10-15T05:12:00.000Z	glitchd		does anyone know anything about how i can enable pae so i can use all 8 gigs of my ram?
2010-10-15T05:13:00.000Z	charliehorse55	glitchd	 what do you have against 64 bit linux?
2010-10-15T05:17:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	nothing in general
2010-10-15T05:17:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	it just wasnt for me
2010-10-15T05:17:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	maybe i didnt give it enough of a chance, but maybe im jus right
2010-10-15T05:17:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	i only switched thinking that bluetooth would work, which it didnt.
2010-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	nd now im back in 32 but land trying to get this back the way i had it originally
2010-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	charliehorse55	glitchd	 I don't understand, 64 vs 32 shouldn't affect bluetooth drivers?
2010-10-15T05:19:00.000Z	glitchd		well i didnt know that
2010-10-15T05:19:00.000Z	glitchd		my bluetooth works in windows
2010-10-15T05:19:00.000Z	glitchd		just not in ubuntu
2010-10-15T05:20:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	my bluetooth works in windows, jus not in ubuntu
2010-10-15T05:20:00.000Z	charliehorse55	glitchd	right, this has nothing to do with 64 vs 32 bit linux, just install 64 bit and enjoy the extra ram. Not to mention the big speed increase in some CPU heavy tasks
2010-10-15T05:21:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	i did that already, i did not like it.
2010-10-15T05:22:00.000Z	charliehorse55	glitchd	did not like what? 64 bit ubuntu? There isn't really a User interface difference or anything. You can still run 32 bit applications anyways.
2010-10-15T05:23:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	it just didnt work better for me
2010-10-15T05:23:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	im  better off in 32 bit land
2010-10-15T05:23:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	with my pae enabled
2010-10-15T05:24:00.000Z	charliehorse55	glitchd	I still don't understand. Bluetooth somehow worked in 32 bit and not 64 bit?
2010-10-15T05:24:00.000Z	glitchd	charliehorse55	no it doesnt work in either
2010-10-15T05:24:00.000Z	glitchd		but there was no big speed increase in 64 either
2010-10-15T05:25:00.000Z	glitchd		in fact, i believe my 32 bit install with the pae enabled was faster
2010-10-15T05:26:00.000Z	charliehorse55	glitchd	so what do you have against 64 bit linux then? It will enable you to use 8GB of RAM natively and increase performance in some applications. What's not to like?
