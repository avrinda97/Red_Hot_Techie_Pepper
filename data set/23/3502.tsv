2008-04-02T03:11:00.000Z	sarah____		is it possible to do jin__?
2008-04-02T03:11:00.000Z	jin__	sarah____	sarah____to do that,  you need your own domain name
2008-04-02T03:12:00.000Z	jin__	sarah____	yes, but then you need a pc that's 24/7 connected to the internet
2008-04-02T03:12:00.000Z	jin__	sarah____	but you can do it with a hosting provider ;) much easier
2008-04-02T03:12:00.000Z	sarah____		but can't i do it with my ubuntu desktop jin__. I will only be able to acces it when its online. I can live with that.
2008-04-02T03:13:00.000Z	sarah____	jin__	what would i need to do this?
2008-04-02T03:13:00.000Z	jin__	sarah____	then you still need a domain name, which will cost you around 8 usd a year
2008-04-02T03:14:00.000Z	jin__	sarah____	but this is not Ubuntu specific
