2005-10-18T12:17:00.000Z	Chadza		Anyone know of a program that'll let me create and set up a sql database (not through a web server)?
2005-10-18T12:18:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	What do you need to do exactly?  Creating a mysql database is very easy.
2005-10-18T12:20:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	I'm playing around with rubyonrails, and I need to set up a database with 2 tables in it.
2005-10-18T12:21:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	Have you got mysql installed etc?
2005-10-18T12:21:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	Yeah.
2005-10-18T12:22:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	can you get in to the command line interface?
2005-10-18T12:22:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	Yep.
2005-10-18T12:23:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	Cool.  Then go in the command line and do "create database <database name>"
2005-10-18T12:24:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	oo, you'll need a ";" on the end.
2005-10-18T12:25:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	Do I need mysql in front of that?
2005-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	Yeah, so do a "mysql" to get the console up, then (assuming you've got rights set up) "create database <whatever>;"
2005-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	Where <whatever> is your database name
2005-10-18T12:26:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	Okay, lemme try again
2005-10-18T12:27:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	It said "Query okay, 1 row effected"
2005-10-18T12:27:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	Dahhh dahhh! One database created! (easy eh!) Now you need to create the tables... so "use <whatever you called your database>;"
2005-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	So what do I do to add a table to it?  I don't know if I got everything that you said
2005-10-18T12:30:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	To create a table within a database you first need to "use" the database, so 'use <databasename>;', then to create the table...
2005-10-18T12:31:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	"create table tablename(col_name TYPE, col_name TYPE, col_name TYPE);' where colname is the name of each column you want to create and TYPE is the type of column it needs to be.
2005-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-table.html
2005-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	Thank you very much.
2005-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	No worries.  It looks a little hard to start but you'll soon make sense of it.
2005-10-18T12:33:00.000Z	Chadza	_willcooke_	One last question, do you know where this db is, so I can move it to my rails folder?
2005-10-18T12:34:00.000Z	_willcooke_	Chadza	I dont know how rails works, but generally things access databases through an api in the language you are using.  So, they talk to the mysql server, not look at the file where the database is held.  Basically, you shouldnt need to move the file.
