2007-04-03T09:57:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	I'm looking at it, one sec
2007-04-03T09:57:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Thanks mate
2007-04-03T09:58:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	It's the last response I cant work out
2007-04-03T09:59:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	ok...  so you just need help installing SAMBA and configuring your printer to be shared through it?
2007-04-03T10:00:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Fun#
2007-04-03T10:01:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Yeah....I think my description of the issue was fairly straightforward....when I am logged into windows, the Linux machine upstrairs can see the printer and print ok.  However, when I have logged into Ubuntu down here, the Linux machine upstrais can no longer see the printer
2007-04-03T10:01:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	yea, it's just because you don't have ubuntu configured to share the printer.
2007-04-03T10:02:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Ahhh ok...well any help you can give will be greatly appreciated mate
2007-04-03T10:02:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	you really should just follow the link the last post had:   http://samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/     it will help you configure samba to share the printer...    to install samba just do     sudo apt-get install samba           in the console
2007-04-03T10:03:00.000Z	mikebeecham		right installed
2007-04-03T10:03:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Installed

2007-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	sorry man, i'm looking for a guide for you
2007-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	unfortunately whta you want to do is going to be over any ones head who is new to linux
2007-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Thanks mate
2007-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Not great news by the looks of it....the computer upstairs is for the children to print thier homework off on...I just dont want to have to log into windows so they can print
2007-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	here you go:    http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Print_Server_.28cupsd.29
2007-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	I suppose the solution is to get another local printer
2007-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mikebeecham	no, follow the link I just sent you:   http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Print_Server_.28cupsd.29
2007-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Thanks mate.....looking now
2007-04-03T10:16:00.000Z	mikebeecham	FunnyLookinHat	Reading now...however, with my limited knowledge Samba and Cupsys work differently...therefore I would need to essentially set up two printers on the Linux machine upstairs....one for when the machine downstairs is logged into windows, and one for when I am logged into Linux?  Is that right?
