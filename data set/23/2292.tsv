2011-02-28T02:21:00.000Z	Sid		why ubuntu is considered most powerfull?
2011-02-28T02:21:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	IIRC it isn't.
2011-02-28T02:16:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	Yes.  They're from very different families.
2011-02-28T02:17:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	Correct.  However, Fedora is in the Red Hat family, whereas Ubuntu is in the Debian family.  The families have several architectural differences.
2011-02-28T02:18:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	There's those too, but more like, for example, the fact that the debian family uses APT repositories whereas the Red Hat family use RPM for package management.
2011-02-28T02:19:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	There is no "better".  Except that this is an Ubuntu channel so we have to say Debian is better :P
2011-02-28T02:20:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	Indeed you can.
2011-02-28T02:20:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	Fedora is, yes.
2011-02-28T02:26:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	What and why, primarily.  And Starminn is right, take it to -offtopic.
2011-02-28T02:28:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	Is it slow or unresponsive?  The two are very different.  If it's slow to respond, you might want to look at disabling IPv6 - hang on, I'll dig out a link.
2011-02-28T02:29:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	Right.  Are you using a wired or a wireless connection?
2011-02-28T02:30:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	But it's a mobile internet connection?
2011-02-28T02:35:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	Yes, it does.  sudo apt-get install vlc
2011-02-28T02:36:00.000Z	Darael	Sid	The bit after the . was the command to use in a terminal to install it.  Alternatively, use the Software Centre.
