2011-04-02T14:52:00.000Z	qwebirc61633		"apm: BIOS not found."  Does this mean that my motherboard is not using APM?!
2011-04-02T14:52:00.000Z	qwebirc61633		or just the module is not LOADED?
2011-04-02T14:52:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	Youll use ACPI anyway, dont bother with APM
2011-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	the machine IS OLD
2011-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	Ubuntu is not powering it off!
2011-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	This is really buggy
2011-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	maybe you could post a complete dmesg after bootup somewhere?
2011-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	it shows System Halted and fans keep spinning
2011-04-02T14:54:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	Yeah, shitty BIOSes
2011-04-02T14:54:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	I have tried ACPI
2011-04-02T14:59:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	I cant poweroff successfully in Archlinux
2011-04-02T15:00:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	Doesnt make me wonder if this is really something BIOS specific
2011-04-02T15:00:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	no, it's not a setting in BIOS because same settings have different results, it's so problem in Ubuntu
2011-04-02T15:01:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	Im not talking about the settings, but about the actual BIOS code
2011-04-02T15:02:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	BIOS code? what do you mean
2011-04-02T15:03:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	All BIOSes have some quirks, which newer linux Kernels may know and work around
2011-04-02T15:03:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	BIOSes only tend to get tested under that one big OS
2011-04-02T15:05:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	of course this also might be because of the kernel doing something wrong, but then it's the BIOS again, as things are not standardized
2011-04-02T15:28:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	making it easy... what kernel version works, and what doesnt
2011-04-02T15:28:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	other OS kernel is recent why wouldnt work in Ubuntu?
2011-04-02T15:29:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	"recent" doesnt tell me anything... recent would be 2.6.38.2
2011-04-02T15:38:00.000Z	prx	qwebirc61633	any kernel versions yet?
2011-04-02T15:40:00.000Z	qwebirc61633	prx	just a second
