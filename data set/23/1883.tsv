2012-10-05T23:41:00.000Z	Westz		pastebin.com/G66bCdss for lsmod
2012-10-05T23:42:00.000Z	Westz		i hope not, my wireless card is aftermarket from Intel...
2012-10-05T23:43:00.000Z	Westz		yeah
2012-10-05T23:43:00.000Z	Westz		i don't see why it's this big a pain. i've heard of people running ubuntu on this laptop before. i feel like it'sbecause i'm using 10.04
2012-10-05T23:44:00.000Z	Westz		it'd probably work out of box in 12.04
2012-10-05T23:44:00.000Z	Westz		it's LTS and actually uses gnome. i like the version of banshee it uses
2012-10-05T23:44:00.000Z	theadmin	Westz	12.04 uses GNOME as well (with Unity as the shell)
2012-10-05T23:45:00.000Z	Westz		i thought it was using joli?
2012-10-05T23:45:00.000Z	theadmin	Westz	It was using "joli"? That's not any desktop I know.
2012-10-05T23:45:00.000Z	Westz		shoot, it's been SO LONG since i've used ubuntu...
2012-10-05T23:45:00.000Z	Westz		i thought jolicloud was the new DM they used
2012-10-05T23:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Westz	http://ubuntu.com/tour -- you can see the generic look of the modern Ubuntu desktop here
2012-10-05T23:46:00.000Z	Westz		not a fan of lxde
2012-10-05T23:46:00.000Z	Westz		i'd prefer openbox if anything other than gnome
2012-10-05T23:47:00.000Z	Westz		hmm. i might do that. it'd be less work than this
2012-10-05T23:47:00.000Z	Westz		though i'm considering just dumping ubuntu and going back to arch, if i'm going to go with openbox anyway
2012-10-05T23:53:00.000Z	Westz	thufir_	it's the issue that i know how to update better with Arch. if i just need a newer kernel because it's got the mods i need, i can do that with Arch.
2012-10-05T23:54:00.000Z	Westz		well i'm not leaving this channel until i get SOMETHING working, so don't wish me luck and send me on my way quite *yet*
2012-10-05T23:54:00.000Z	Westz		updating this could take all week....
2012-10-05T23:55:00.000Z	Westz		Lucid
2012-10-05T23:55:00.000Z	theadmin	Westz	Updating Ubuntu? A week? Dude, this isn't Gentoo, it will take maximally a couple hours
2012-10-05T23:55:00.000Z	Westz		i'm using 802.11b wireless.....
2012-10-05T23:55:00.000Z	theadmin	Westz	Besides you can upgrade from Lucid to Precise directly (LTS to LTS)
