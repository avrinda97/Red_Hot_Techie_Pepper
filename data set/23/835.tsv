2011-01-17T03:00:00.000Z	kalz		if it helps, im using a Sony Bravia 32" as a monitor
2011-01-17T03:01:00.000Z	kalz		okay, with nvida-current installed, can i edit a file somewhere in gedit to force a 1280x768 resolution?
2011-01-17T03:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-01-17T03:04:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	 Huh, my Xorg.conf is blank.
2011-01-17T03:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	"sudo nvidia-config" to generate one - but that also means you aren't using the proprietary nvidia driver currently.
2011-01-17T03:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	sorry nvidia-xconfig
2011-01-17T03:06:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	Im using the ones from apt install "Nvidia-current"
2011-01-17T03:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	nvidia-current doesn't install one i don't think - you need to run that "sudo nvidia-xconfig"
2011-01-17T03:08:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	Right I've ran "Sudo nvidia-xconfig" , and xorg is still blank
2011-01-17T03:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	when you say "blank" is there really content?
2011-01-17T03:09:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	gedit has it as a blank doc, its bizzare
2011-01-17T03:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	perhaps a problem with you gedit command?  "gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2011-01-17T03:12:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	AHA! opening it from the open button IN gedit rather than via terminal actually loaded it!
2011-01-17T03:15:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	 where abouts (and how) in here would I add a forced resolution
2011-01-17T03:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	the easy way is to use nvidia-settings in the GUI - manually you need to create a modeline line i believe
2011-01-17T03:17:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	 Ah okay, sorry but im going to have to ask for help there as well then
2011-01-17T03:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	sorry just reinstalled yesterday - haven't configured my xorg yet... give me a moment to google ;)
2011-01-17T03:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	looks like you need a line // Modes "1600x1200" "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" // under the "Screen" section
2011-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	obviously you need to customize the resolutions there
2011-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	 right i've added the line, I also added "1280x768" as well, as thats the res im hoping to achive at the end of all this.
2011-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	you probably ONLY want that 1280x768 actually - one entry only
2011-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	kalz	ZykoticK9	 Okay, just 1280x768. do I need to reboot, or will logging out/in suffice?
2011-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kalz	restart GDM - logging out should be sufficient
