2008-11-20T11:26:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	for a theme?
2008-11-20T11:26:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	system->appearance, theme tab, install...
2008-11-20T11:27:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	ohhhhhh
2008-11-20T11:28:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	does the site you got it from not have some instructions?
2008-11-20T11:29:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	tar files are like zip files. you untar them with the 'tar' command in the terminal, or with the archive manager
2008-11-20T11:30:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	for example, if it was a tar.gz (or tgz) its also compressed, you'd do: tar -xzf myfile.tgz
2008-11-20T11:31:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	BUT, i think for some gtk theme stuff, it accepts the theme in the tar without extracting it. so you will have to research it (or maybe someone else knows better than me)
2008-11-20T11:32:00.000Z	photomaniac	Rubin	thanks for the info. i have also seen instructions for some of the programs that have you ./configure and set a prefix and then use the make command and then the make install command. what is the diffence and which is the best way to do it.
2008-11-20T11:34:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	that process with the ./configure is 'compiling'
2008-11-20T11:34:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	you almost always want to not do that, but instead find the ubuntu specific package for things instead. its easy to break your system if you compile and install things yourself as root (unless you kinda know what your doing)
2008-11-20T11:36:00.000Z	photomaniac	Rubin	do most programs in the form of tar need compiling or do some of them do it with the tar command. sometimes its hard for me to find the packages or programs i want in a .deb
2008-11-20T11:36:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	tar is just a collection of files
2008-11-20T11:36:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	.deb is a package for debian or ubuntu
2008-11-20T11:36:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	.tar is completely generic can be anything else
2008-11-20T11:37:00.000Z	photomaniac	Rubin	i have been trying to get my card reader going so that i can use it to access my military site and almost all of the packages are installable through the package manager but i havent found how to configure them with out compiling from a tar.
2008-11-20T11:38:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	that may be an activity you'll have to get pretty familiar with linux to accomplish
2008-11-20T11:39:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	how are you on the commandline? :)
2008-11-20T11:39:00.000Z	photomaniac	Rubin	thanks for those apt options i always thought that the apt-get install would find any available packages you ask for.
2008-11-20T11:40:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	man pages are like wine. you kinda grow into them with practice
2008-11-20T11:41:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	(by that i mean, i understand, i remember hating them when i started out, but now i love them and really appreciate their breivity)
2008-11-20T11:42:00.000Z	photomaniac	Rubin	I understand the basics of them but i tend to have trouble understanding the syntax examples they have.
2008-11-20T11:43:00.000Z	Rubin	photomaniac	only way to learn is to read em a few times and ask someone.
