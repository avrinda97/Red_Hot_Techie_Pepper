2008-03-04T07:46:00.000Z	mrcalkin		hi, problem from a noob regarding a very old install of pidgin I just can't get to uninstall
2008-03-04T07:47:00.000Z	mrcalkin		it is one of the few programs I manually compiled
2008-03-04T07:47:00.000Z	mrcalkin		everything i've seen on the forums doesn't seem to work
2008-03-04T07:47:00.000Z	mrcalkin		I finally tried to sudo -r rm the directory
2008-03-04T07:47:00.000Z	mrcalkin		and its gone, yet it still opens....
2008-03-04T07:48:00.000Z	mrcalkin		I really want to upgrade past 2.0.0
2008-03-04T07:49:00.000Z	pestilence	mrcalkin	type which pidgin in a terminal
2008-03-04T07:49:00.000Z	mrcalkin		it pops out /usr/local/bin/pidgin
2008-03-04T07:49:00.000Z	pestilence	mrcalkin	so remove that ;)
