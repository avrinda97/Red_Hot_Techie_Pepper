2011-01-30T01:30:00.000Z	clavin12		How might I go about upgrading dpkg?
2011-01-30T01:30:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	apt-get update dpkg
2011-01-30T23:54:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	in synaptic, sources from the menu
2011-01-30T23:55:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	alright.
2011-01-30T23:59:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	I checked the box for source files in the synaptic package manager but I still cannot find the nvidia-kernel-source in the terminal with module-assistant
2011-01-30T23:59:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	what are you trying to do?
2011-01-31T00:00:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	I'm trying to install the nvidia module.
2011-01-31T00:00:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	then just use the hardware installer from the menu: system, administration, additional drivers
2011-01-31T00:02:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	ok so the driver for my card is installed but I can only run in failsafe mode. btw, i failed to mention earlier that I am running mint 10.
2011-01-31T00:03:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	is nouveau blacklisted?
2011-01-31T00:03:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	How do you mean?
2011-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	when you install nvidia from jockey, it should install and blacklist nouveau, the open source driver. if it didn't, i would uninstall nvidia and try again
2011-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	I will try that.
2011-01-31T00:06:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	it's hard to tell without see what's going on. i've installed nvidia both manually and using jockey in 10.10
2011-01-31T00:07:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	I usually prefer the gui.
2011-01-31T00:07:00.000Z	magicianlord	clavin12	yes, and it keeps across kernel upgrades
2011-01-31T00:09:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	So i hit remove driver, and it is now deactivated.
2011-01-31T00:10:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	ought i to simply hit activate or completely remove it some how?
2011-01-31T00:18:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	I installed it and am now rebooting.
2011-01-31T00:21:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	upon rebooting I got a plain text linux mint splash screen, then some terminal type stuff, and finally blinking caps lock and scroll lock. That is a kernel panick no?
2011-01-31T00:25:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	I rebooted in recovery mode and chose reconfigure X
2011-01-31T00:27:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	I selected new configuration for this hardware and still got the plain text splash.
2011-01-31T00:27:00.000Z	clavin12	magicianlord	now all I have is terminal.
