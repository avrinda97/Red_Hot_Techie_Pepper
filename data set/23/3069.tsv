2008-08-07T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	It's other information.  name,office,office phone,home phone I believe.
2008-08-07T12:03:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	what would happen if i delete the,s?
2008-08-07T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	bad things I imagine.
2008-08-07T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	either that, or nothing at all
2009-06-05T13:16:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	Please keep non-support topics out of this channel.  #ubuntu-offtopic, etc
2010-06-04T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	How did you install apache?
2010-06-04T11:30:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	now i tried "sudo aptitude install apache2" and "sudo apt-get install apache2"
2010-06-04T11:32:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	Alright.  Is this your second attempt at installing apache by any chance?
2010-06-04T11:32:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	yes
2010-06-04T11:32:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	is there any chance to get the configfiles?
2010-06-04T11:33:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	and when you removed that, you removed the package, and then deleted the apache folders?
2010-06-04T11:34:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	i removed with purge and so on. i tried to get the defaultconfigs back because they were messed up but now i obviously have none :(
2010-06-04T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	Alright.  When you purged, you must have not purged the sub packages (and then subsequently just rmd the directories are something), anyway, it's an easy enough fix.  What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-06-04T11:35:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	/etc/issue says "Ubuntu 9.10 \n \l"
2010-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	lsb_release is another way to find that out, by the way.
2010-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	and how to get the configfiles?
2010-06-04T11:38:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	sudo apt-get install apache2, then sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2 apache2.2-common apache2-mpm-worker apache2.2-bin, then sudo apt-get install apache2
2010-06-04T11:42:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	it seems to have problems with libapache2-mod-geoip i can't purge that. error: "/var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-geoip.postrm: 21: a2dismod: not found"
2010-06-04T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	oh, fun.  This is why you don't use rm on things from the package manager.  Alright, what we'll need to do is make up a fake a2dismod (/usr/sbin/a2dismod) that returns 0 all the time.
2010-06-04T11:48:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	how to do that?
2010-06-04T11:50:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	sudo nano /usr/sbin/a2dismod, and then paste this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/444436/  Save it (ctrl-o then ctrl-x), and then sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/a2dismod
2010-06-04T11:52:00.000Z	the_gamer	Flannel	works. great! thank you very much :)
2010-06-04T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	the_gamer	Once you remove all the packages, remove that file ;)
