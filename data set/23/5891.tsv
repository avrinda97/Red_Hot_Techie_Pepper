2006-08-19T12:44:00.000Z	thebishop		would anyone here like NetworkManager to have an Internet Connection Sharing dialog?
2006-08-19T12:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	install firestarter
2006-08-19T12:44:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	i did, it didn't work too well for me
2006-08-19T13:19:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	its not a sleek, but from a technical standpoint, its there
2006-08-19T13:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	its a great show stopper, but as far as productivity goes, I don't think it increases it any.
2006-08-19T13:21:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	lol big deal, its fun
2006-08-19T13:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	you'd have 10 fold better productivty if you go with dual monitors, for example.

2006-08-19T13:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	this is my laptop > http://img91.imageshack.us/my.php?image=laptopog3.png
2006-08-19T13:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	we have to get the crop circle first
2006-08-19T13:51:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	what video card is on your laptop?
2006-08-19T13:51:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	Intel 915
2006-08-19T13:51:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	should work okay (as long as you don't run xgl)
2006-08-19T13:52:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	it runs, but its a bit too choppy to enjoy
2006-08-19T13:52:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	maybe future Wine updates will help
2006-08-19T13:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	I always compile wine from source
2006-08-19T13:52:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	i'm using the WineHQ repo
2006-08-19T14:15:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	you play WoW in linux?
2006-08-19T14:18:00.000Z	thebishop	fyrestrtr	i still get it...
2006-08-19T14:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	well you shouldn't if you use cgwd properly
2006-08-19T14:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	thebishop	its probably because you never changed your startup script
