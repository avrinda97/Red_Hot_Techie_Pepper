2011-09-14T18:28:00.000Z	robin0800	chirag_d_gr8	are you sure there is no bios setting or is it because you have no disk drive?
2011-09-14T18:28:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8	ubottu	is a bot? it is so cool :O
2011-09-14T18:29:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		i have disk drive but my laptop does not read a bootable drive and continue with windows
2011-09-14T18:30:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		not even from usb drive
2011-09-14T18:30:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		i bought my laptop 3 days ago lol
2011-09-14T18:30:00.000Z	robin0800	chirag_d_gr8	there will either be a bios setting or a key to hit to choose boot device
2011-09-14T18:30:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		it is i3 processor, 3 gb ram, 2 gb graphics etc
2011-09-14T18:31:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		ok....
2011-09-14T18:31:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		i never pressed a key before while booting....let me check that
2011-09-14T18:31:00.000Z	robin0800	chirag_d_gr8	or f8
2011-09-14T18:32:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		so if i press all 3 will that do my job?
2011-09-14T18:32:00.000Z	robin0800	chirag_d_gr8	try one at a time
2011-09-14T18:32:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		ok...
2011-09-14T18:33:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		mine is hp
2011-09-14T18:33:00.000Z	robin0800	chirag_d_gr8	I still think there will be a setting in bios too
2011-09-14T18:34:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		ok so if i enter successfully in bios, i will change boot sequence and my pc boot from disc first?
2011-09-14T18:34:00.000Z	robin0800	chirag_d_gr8	yes
2011-09-14T18:34:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		i never entered bios
2011-09-14T18:34:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		:D
2011-09-14T18:35:00.000Z	chirag_d_gr8		but if i mess bios, how to get it back to normal?
2011-09-14T18:35:00.000Z	robin0800	chirag_d_gr8	it might be delete for bios
