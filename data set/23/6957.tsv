2005-12-29T11:18:00.000Z	intelikey		someone talk me out of buying the sarge cd's
2005-12-29T11:18:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	yes: ubuntu cds are free
2005-12-29T11:19:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	http://shipit.ubuntu.com/
2005-12-29T11:19:00.000Z	intelikey	rob1	but ubuntu does not ship cd's per se  but an install cd and then require net repos..... that's a real problem with a dialup connection over a slowdem
2005-12-29T11:20:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	no, the cd has a complete desktop environment on it
2005-12-29T11:20:00.000Z	intelikey	rob1	secondly by the time i get a ub system installed it's out of date and no longer supported.... hehh
2005-12-29T11:21:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	you only need to download extras
2005-12-29T11:22:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	try asking your local lug for a copy of some of the extra stuff on cd that you want
2005-12-29T11:22:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	thats no good :)
2005-12-29T11:23:00.000Z	intelikey	rob1	arkansas ozarks hill billy
2005-12-29T11:24:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	how far is little rock from you?
2005-12-29T11:25:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	there is a lug there
2005-12-29T11:27:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	heh
2005-12-29T11:28:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	thats pretty bad for a lug
2005-12-29T11:30:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	a set of debian cds might be more useful for you
2005-12-29T11:30:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	be aware that most of debain becomes dated and needs updates frequently
2005-12-29T11:32:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	I used to be on dialup myself, a set of debian cds kept me sane
2005-12-29T11:32:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	although I could take my box into my local lug and update it via a local networked mirror
2005-12-29T11:33:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	there is a ubuntu dvd
2005-12-29T11:33:00.000Z	intelikey	rob1	it seems that rather than talking me out of it, you are kinda with me on it....  ;/
2005-12-29T11:39:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	you could get someone to dl one of the ubuntu dvd images via bittorrent from http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/breezy/release/dvd/ and mail it to you
2005-12-29T11:39:00.000Z	rob1	intelikey	I'm not sure if a linux shop sells them
