2009-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	Guest3565		here is a question When I play a game it runs so incredibly slow, like impossible to play, how can I fix this problem?
2009-09-20T12:55:00.000Z	Guest3565		oh, and Nexiuz
2009-09-20T12:56:00.000Z	Guest3565		Graphics Card is intel 865G
2009-09-20T12:56:00.000Z	Guest3565		runs games perfectly fine using windows, but I switched to ubuntu 8.10 and nothing seems to work in that department
2009-09-20T12:57:00.000Z	Guest3565		I know bot, lol thats why I use 8.10 lol
2009-09-20T12:59:00.000Z	Guest3565		So what can I do?  those games run fine in windows, but using linux just ain't workin right, and I can't go back to windows
2009-09-20T13:00:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	What is your graphics card?
2009-09-20T13:03:00.000Z	Guest3565	Justicepsion	its an intel 865g
2009-09-20T13:04:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	That's definitely part of the problem--Intel cards are . . . eh. I mean, I have one too. But let me see, I know a way to fix that . . .
2009-09-20T13:05:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	Do you know how to add a package repository to your list of sources?
2009-09-20T13:06:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	In this case, you'll be adding a software source that will give you updated intel video drivers.
2009-09-20T13:08:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	Go to System -> Administration -> Software Sources
2009-09-20T13:08:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: then click on the Third-Party Software tab, and click on add.
2009-09-20T13:09:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-09-20T13:10:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: enter this line: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu jaunty main
2009-09-20T13:11:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: let it be known that this repo can be unstable
2009-09-20T13:11:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: but that I use it and it works fine for me
2009-09-20T13:12:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: in all seriousness I've never had any problems with it, but I can't promise anything.
2009-09-20T13:14:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: once you've added that, then you need to go to http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x3B22AB97AF1CDFA9 and copy everything underneath the title line and paste it into a text file.
2009-09-20T13:17:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: then on "Software sources" you need to go to the "Authentication" tab, click "Add," and select the text file you just made. (If you haven't saved it, then save it as something so you can add it.)
2009-09-20T13:19:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: just do sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-09-20T13:20:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: it should pull in the new drivers.
2009-09-20T13:26:00.000Z	Justicepsion	Guest3565	: how is it worse?
