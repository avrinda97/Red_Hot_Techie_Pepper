2009-05-30T20:50:00.000Z	Wixicy		this is not 4chan
2009-05-30T20:52:00.000Z	Wixicy		Alright, ive heard 9.04 is buggy. What do you guys recommend using for a laptop. 8.10 or 9.04?
2009-05-30T20:52:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	9.04
2009-05-30T20:52:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	8.10 sucks compared to 9.04
2009-05-30T20:52:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	8.10 is slowmo
2009-05-30T20:53:00.000Z	Wixicy	racecar56	the laptop isn that powerful. just 512MB ram
2009-05-30T20:53:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	notice: 9.04 uses ext3 by default, USE EXT4 WHEN POSSIBLE!
2009-05-30T20:53:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	uhh.... i have an equally bad comp and im chatting with u know
2009-05-30T20:53:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	*now
2009-05-30T20:53:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	it came with 512 mb BUT i upgraded it to 1gb
2009-05-30T20:54:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	a while ago
2009-05-30T20:54:00.000Z	Wixicy	racecar56	is it more power efficient too?
2009-05-30T20:54:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	minimum requirement for 9.04 is 156 mb and yes
2009-05-30T20:54:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	*256 mb
2009-05-30T20:54:00.000Z	Wixicy	racecar56	but I am unable to update to 9.04 through update manager
2009-05-30T20:55:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	it's called a clean install
2009-05-30T20:55:00.000Z	Wixicy	racecar56	bah, you've convinced me already
2009-05-30T20:55:00.000Z	racecar56	Wixicy	after all, 4.10 to 8.xx use ext3
2009-05-30T20:55:00.000Z	Wixicy		lol
