2007-09-01T16:47:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	are you sure? ntfs-3g or whatever it's called ?
2007-09-01T16:48:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	i used it for years without problems. but it still is a beta.
2007-09-01T16:48:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	oh.. ok. Didn't know that
2007-09-01T16:48:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	you only hve to install it and use it instead of "mount"
2009-01-24T02:18:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	what version is available in the repos now?
2009-01-24T02:19:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	2.1 is available. there are several big fixes in 2.2, so i would like to have it.. it is already in the repos of jaunty, but i dont want jaunty now :P
2009-01-24T02:19:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	I don't think they will update to the newer version unless there is a serious bug of some kind
2009-01-24T02:20:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	but who knows.. get enough people complaining about it and they might change their mind, I suppose
2009-01-24T02:22:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	there is already a bug filed asking to backport it, but i dont think so for now... so, i think ill try to build from source. i just wanted to know if there is a known good method of updating to higher versions, wich has some dependencies like perl wich could easyly disort the package system
2009-01-24T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	take a look at checkinstall.. that might help
2009-01-24T02:23:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	kk thanks
2009-01-24T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	you're welcome
2009-01-24T02:53:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	building from source dies instantly, because there is no sdl-something installed... no chance for frozen-bubble 2.2 as far as i can see :(
2009-01-24T02:54:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	hmm.. you don't remember the exact error message?
2009-01-24T02:54:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	just a sec
2009-01-24T02:55:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	SDL development environment seems to be missing ("sdl-config --cflags" reports an error)
2009-01-24T02:55:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	search in synaptic for SDL packages.. find one that ends in -dev.. install that
2009-01-24T02:55:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	k thanks
2009-01-24T02:57:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	that one might do the trick
2009-01-24T03:02:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	thanks, will do so just after fixing the package system -.-
2009-01-24T03:16:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	i had to install about 20 sdl dev libs. did work now. huge thanks =)
2009-01-24T03:16:00.000Z	damaltor	Slart	cya
2009-01-24T03:21:00.000Z	Slart	damaltor	ah.. nice that it worked out.. bye
