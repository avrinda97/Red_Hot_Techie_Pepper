2006-01-03T17:45:00.000Z	Mabus06		Can somebody please help me to get my ATI card to work with ubuntu? Tried the wiki article that ubotu said, but it doesn't work. I have no gui so it's hard to get help for myself on google etc.
2006-01-03T17:46:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	how far u get?
2006-01-03T17:46:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	using apt-get?
2006-01-03T17:47:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	a good place to start is /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-01-03T17:47:00.000Z	Mabus06	mojo	should I pastebin xorg.0.log?
2006-01-03T17:48:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	well, I am in text-only too.  but yes, you should anyway, I can always start GDM back up
2006-01-03T17:48:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	you can use grep to filter the output of the log file.  Try it with (EE) for error lines, or WW for warning.
2006-01-03T17:50:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	Hey, go on and pastebin your Xorg.0.log AND your /etc/X11/xorg.conf files since I'm going graphical here anyway
2006-01-03T17:50:00.000Z	Mabus06	mojo	I have a driver cd should I use that? But is it only for windows that I can use it?
2006-01-03T17:51:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	scratch that, now i cant start GDM cuz of my broken upgrade. (sigh)
2006-01-03T17:51:00.000Z	Mabus06	mojo	so will my drivers cd do any good?
2006-01-03T17:52:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	you should first be trying the ubuntu package for the ATI binary drivers.  It is called xorg-driver-fglrx and is avialable in apt or Synaptic program on administrative menu.
2006-01-03T17:52:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	NOT sure if you need to activate the universe or multiverse repositories, though.
2006-01-03T17:52:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	you might.
2006-01-03T17:54:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	you already have xorg-driver-fglrx installed via Ubuntu package management system (apt/synaptic)
2006-01-03T17:55:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	Okay then.  Well, you may have used it to start the install
2006-01-03T17:55:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	There is after all the foss 'ati' driver, xorg-driver-ati that does not have all the hardware acceleration but gives  u x
2006-01-03T17:56:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	but you can get the fglrx to work.  i have a radeon 9800 xt working fine on Breezy
2006-01-03T17:58:00.000Z	Mabus06	mojo	fglrxinfo yields an error
2006-01-03T17:58:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	have you tried grepping the x log for errors yet?
2006-01-03T17:59:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	try something like "cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log|grep EE" or try with WW for warning lines.  If too much for a screen (doubtful), you can also pipe to more by adding "|more"
2006-01-03T06:19:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-01-03T06:23:00.000Z	mojo	Mabus06	any luck?
