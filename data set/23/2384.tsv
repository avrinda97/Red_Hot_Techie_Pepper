2009-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson		So, nothing on sound and Flash in firefox?
2009-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	  i think the flash wiki page has some troublshooting tips.
2009-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	what address?
2009-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	I have Flash installed.  No sound though
2009-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 there are known Flash/audio issues..  check the troubleshooting tips perhaps?
2009-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	I understand, where?
2009-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 none at the link the bot just gave?  i think ive seen info there..
2009-07-04T08:16:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	no, none of the same symptoms.  I just have no sound.
2009-07-04T08:19:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	thanks.....way too much modifications to do to all my machines.  Thanks though.
2009-07-04T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 i have no flash/sound issues on my 5 machines..  I do know theres a package or 2 to try to get flash/audio working better.
2009-07-04T08:20:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	I will take it back to XP on those machines that require sound with Flash
2009-07-04T08:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 check the package manager/forums - i recall some  simple package you might want to isntall to see if it works.
2009-07-04T08:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 you mean when adobe gets its flash sound working? :)
2009-07-04T08:24:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	yup
2009-07-04T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	  i will repeate. there is some 'flash-sound compatiabilty' type package that some people require.. but  i dont know its name.
2009-07-04T08:25:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	my client doesn't care if it is Ubuntu or adobe.  Ubuntu will not play Flash audio.  Plain and simple problem.
2009-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	no such package
2009-07-04T08:35:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	no worries....Linux cannot solve all problems!
2009-07-04T08:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 expecially problems that come from closed source software
2009-07-04T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 there proberly is a fix..  but if you want to give up.. go ahead..    Ill stick with linux.  the fixs ive been seeing are normally simple.
2009-07-04T08:37:00.000Z	JorgeJorgesson	Dr_Willis	I'll stick with Linux as well....just my clients
2009-07-04T08:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 default? huh?  what package did you install for flash support?
2009-07-04T08:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JorgeJorgesson	 theres no flash plugin installed by default. You can install ubuntu-restricted-extras that will install flash and java and other parts. or install the specific flash package that downloads/installs flash from the adobe site.
