2009-01-30T03:53:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	Now I have tried to go http://welcome.opendns.com/ after a restart, but it does not work :\
2009-01-30T03:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	look into /etc/resolv.conf if it has the nameserver there at all, otherwise you did something wrong probabaly
2009-01-30T03:56:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	What should I find in that folder? There is a file called interface-order, maybe it is that?
2009-01-30T03:57:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	/etc/resolv.conf is a file, it holds the nameservers used to do dns lookups
2009-01-30T03:58:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	look into that to see if wicd actualy applied the dns servers
2009-01-30T03:58:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	It doesn't :(
2009-01-30T03:58:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	then you did something wrong or maybe wicd crashed or whatever
2009-01-30T03:58:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	And it says that I can't edit it
2009-01-30T03:59:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	yeah you can only edit it using root priviledges, but be aware of the fact that if you use dhcp it will overwrite the file everytime you request an ip from dhcp
2009-01-30T03:59:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	and replace the nameserver with the one supplied by the dhcp server
2009-01-30T04:00:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	Sorry, I am not sure that I understand. What do you suggest I could do? In the Wicd options the DNS I typed in is still there, but the resolv.conf shows me the standard DNS
2009-01-30T04:00:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	do you use dhcp? if yes change the dns server on your dhcp server
2009-01-30T04:01:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	I have no idea what dhcp is
2009-01-30T04:01:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	But I found the same bug via Google: http://wicd.sourceforge.net/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=226
2009-01-30T04:04:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	What if I temporarily removed Wicd and installed network-manager and typed in the OpenDNS. Then I reinstall Wicd (I need it because the GNOME network-manager doesn't work with my laptop's network card)
2009-01-30T04:05:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	again if you dont use static ip addresses the dns settings are useless as they will be replaced with the dhcp provided ones
2009-01-30T04:05:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	just run gksu gedit /etc/resolv.conf and change the nameservers and see if it works
2009-01-30T04:06:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	if they are gone after restarting the connection with wicd you probably use dhcp
2009-01-30T04:07:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	Is I requiered to have 3 name servers or can I just have 2?
2009-01-30T04:07:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	two is fine
2009-01-30T04:13:00.000Z	wikzo_	mgolisch	Thank you very much. It worked!
2009-01-30T04:16:00.000Z	mgolisch	wikzo_	your are welcome
