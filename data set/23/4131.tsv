2007-11-01T18:26:00.000Z	burwaco	JustinAllen	yes, wobbly windows, no cube yet ...
2007-11-01T18:28:00.000Z	JustinAllen	burwaco	mine wasn't either but i just figured it out.hehe..if you look in the bottom right corner (hope you're using GNOME) you should see your workspaces...i think default to Gutsy is 2..right click and go to preferences and change the columns to 4..so it shows 4 workspaces..then ur cube shold work properly
