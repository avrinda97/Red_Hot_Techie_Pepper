2008-02-20T14:20:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	if you had an nvidia card, and you switched to an ati card, you'll have to change the driver
2008-02-20T14:20:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	in xorg.conf (sorry)
2008-02-20T14:21:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	what card did you buy exactly? and how old is it (it being the model of card)?
2008-02-20T14:22:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	if your card is too new, ubuntu won't be able to detect it
2008-02-20T14:23:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	what model is your card?
2008-02-20T14:27:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	it would appear your card is old enough to be supported by the drivers in Ubuntu
2008-02-20T14:28:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	if Ubuntu is set to use the ATI driver, you won't get any love from that nvidia card :)
2008-02-20T14:29:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	did your run the dpkg-reconfigure command listed above?
2008-02-20T14:30:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	what video driver did you choose?
2008-02-20T14:32:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	I know nothing about graphics cards, but can you install both of them at the same time?
2008-02-20T14:42:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	how much ram do you have?
2008-02-20T14:43:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	you want a swap partition then
2008-02-20T14:44:00.000Z	compwiz18	karllenz	you really should install windows first, makes it a lot easier
