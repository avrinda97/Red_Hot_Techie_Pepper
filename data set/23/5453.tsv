2006-11-26T13:27:00.000Z	LaserLine		ubutnu keeps freezing for me on boot up... and will only boot up without freezing every 10th or so time... what can i do
2006-11-26T13:27:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	Sounds like flaky hardware to me
2006-11-26T13:28:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	is there a way i can scan my hard drive for defects?
2006-11-26T13:28:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	badblocks... if it's that bad you'd probably see something in dmesg though
2006-11-26T13:29:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	seek errors and drive status errors = bad times
2006-11-26T13:30:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	dmesg?  i'm fairly new to linux, but i've been running ubuntu for 6+ months now this is just when the problem occured
2006-11-26T13:30:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	run 'sudo dmesg'... it'll give you a log of recent system messages
2006-11-26T13:32:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	i don't see any
2006-11-26T13:32:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	That's good news for the drive
2006-11-26T13:33:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	Usually if you have sporadic boot problems like that it's heat-related, and probably an issue with the proc
2006-11-26T13:33:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	 I see a lot of ones like this: [17179942.596000]  atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e059 <keycode>' to make it known.
2006-11-26T13:34:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	a wireless microsft keyboard
2006-11-26T13:35:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	Also, are you getting any kind of weird graphical issues when it hangs on boot, or any kind of error messages?
2006-11-26T13:36:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	That seems like sound reasoning to me
2006-11-26T13:37:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	So it's not crashing or freezing once it boots?
2006-11-26T13:37:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	actually it will freeze when after it boots too and it's kinda random, but it seems like every time I'm doing something with sound
2006-11-26T13:38:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	Well, if it's not proc-related, my next guess would be RAM, but it could be a bad sound card as well (usually those won't cause the whole system to go down, but i've seen stranger things)... might wanna try pulling out the sound card and seeing if that resolves it
2006-11-26T13:39:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	it's integrated :(
2006-11-26T13:40:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	Hm... can you disable it in the bios?
2006-11-26T13:41:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	yeah i can see if that helps... also on a side note if gnome freezes is the dmesg thing is where i should look for the error?
2006-11-26T13:43:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	no problem
2006-11-26T13:44:00.000Z	LaserLine	tcli	yeah thanks... i'll see what i can try to make this thing stop freezing
2006-11-26T13:45:00.000Z	tcli	LaserLine	as far as I know... would be pretty silly if not, heh
