2007-05-24T07:48:00.000Z	linuxmasta		When I try to run quake4 it says "error while loading shared libraries: libX11.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory." But /usr/lib/libX11.so.6 exists as a symlink to libX11.so.6.2.0. What's the problem and/or where else is it looking?
2007-05-24T07:50:00.000Z	linuxmasta		or maybe even mplayer itself
2007-05-24T07:50:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	try "env LD_PRELOAD= /usr/lib/libX11.so.6 quake4"
2007-05-24T07:51:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	does that only work as root? I'd rather run as my user
2007-05-24T07:51:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	no.. it should work as user.
2007-05-24T07:51:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	hmm got Permission denied
2007-05-24T07:53:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	run 'sudo chmod +r  /usr/lib/libX11.so.6', and try running it normally.
2007-05-24T07:53:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	permission denied again on the LD_PRELOAD
2007-05-24T07:54:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	weird... what does ls -l  /usr/lib/libX11.so.6 say?
2007-05-24T07:56:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	it's a symbolic link, but I'll give you the output
2007-05-24T07:56:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	lrwxrwxrwx
2007-05-24T07:56:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	run 'sudo chmod +r /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.2.0', and try again
2007-05-24T07:57:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	currently that file is -rw-r--r--
2007-05-24T07:57:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	I thought maybe quake4 was looking elsewhere for the file, but that location is pretty standard
2007-05-24T07:57:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	could be a problem with 64bit-32bit?
2007-05-24T07:58:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	this is a buddy's box; I'm trying to help him out
2007-05-24T07:58:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	ubuntu64?
2007-05-24T07:59:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	I believe just ubuntu
2007-05-24T07:59:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	not amd64 ubuntu?
2007-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	nvm, he installed this: ubuntu-7.04-desktop-amd64.iso
2007-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	I'm not familiar with 64bit so this is all greek
2007-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	diabolix	linuxmasta	thats the problem.. most games are 32.. i highly recoment not using 64bit ubuntu.
2007-05-24T08:01:00.000Z	linuxmasta	diabolix	ah I see, I had a hunch, but no experience really. Alright, bro, thanks for the info
