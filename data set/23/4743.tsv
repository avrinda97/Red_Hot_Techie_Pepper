2007-05-16T14:03:00.000Z	DrLaunch		Seems like that grub page I got referred to only has information useful for those who already have GRUB installed. But it's OK for me to reinstall Ubuntu.
2007-05-16T14:05:00.000Z	DrLaunch		I want to select the correct partition for GRUB. I found out that my root partition is on sdb1. Should I select (sdb1) as boot loader drive then?
2007-05-16T14:06:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	Do you have only the 1 drive in your system?
2007-05-16T14:06:00.000Z	DrLaunch	genii	I have an external harddrive.
2007-05-16T14:08:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	What I mean is, is the sda drive the only hard drive which you are using for an operating system? If not, and you have some IDE drive for instance which normally boots and is seen as hda   then you would normally want the grub install to be hda  (NOTE, NOT hda1) Please also note that not to install grub to a subpartition eg sda1 sda2 etc) just sda for instance
2007-05-16T14:11:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	If the drive it sees as sda is the one it was trying to boot from before you put ubuntu on, then just put for grub sda (NOTE, NOT sda1 or sda2 or so on just sda)
2007-05-16T14:13:00.000Z	DrLaunch	genii	I'm going to boot from the external hard drive using the computers own boot device selection menu.
2007-05-16T14:37:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	Is there a hard drive which normally wants to boot when the computer starts?
2007-05-16T14:38:00.000Z	DrLaunch	genii	I can choose my self.
2007-05-16T14:39:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	Keep in mind if you switch the boot order in bios it screws the hard drive assignments that the drives got. sda might become after adc or weird stuff like so
2007-05-16T14:40:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	If you are making the removable drive the default boot drive in bios after setting it up with linux when the order was different, it will be trying to load from a drive that it cannot find
2007-05-16T14:43:00.000Z	DrLaunch	genii	I'm trying to make ubuntu-on-a-usb-hard-drive. So I can bring it anywhere.
2007-05-16T14:46:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	Yes, but when you installed it (the OS) to sdb, after you switched the bootup order in bios, it now thinks it's drive name is sda instead.
2007-05-16T14:46:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	However, this can be fixed
2007-05-16T14:48:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	If you can access the usb drive from another linux install or the livecd, you can edit the files /boot/grub/menu.lst   and /etc/fstab   to change hd1 to hd0 in the menu.lst and sdb to sda in the /etc/fstab
2007-05-16T14:50:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	At any rate I have to leave in order to not be late for my other job. If no one else can assist I will return in about45 minutes from now and guide you if need be to correct the issue
2007-05-16T14:50:00.000Z	DrLaunch	genii	I'll remember that. But I found an article about this exact thing on the internet.
2007-05-16T14:51:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	Good :) The changes will be for grub to hd0 from the old hd1 (corresponding to sdb) and in the fstab from sdb to sda
2007-05-17T16:15:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	Did you get help adjusting the grub and fstab files ?
2007-05-17T16:16:00.000Z	DrLaunch	genii	I had to do some stuff first. So no.
2007-05-17T16:18:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	I'm at my other job now. So not always at the keyboard. But if you need help I will do what I can (if you can be patient on occasion when I do not respond immediately, etc)
2007-05-17T16:19:00.000Z	DrLaunch	genii	Don't worry. I have plenty of time. I have all of tomorrow too. Because May 17th is Norway's independence day.
2007-05-17T16:25:00.000Z	genii	DrLaunch	Well, the basic process would be to boot to livecd. Then mount sda2 for instance somewhere temporary then you can edit the files on it which need the device for hard drive changed
