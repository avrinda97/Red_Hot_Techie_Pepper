2007-03-30T05:34:00.000Z	nexous		Anyone use NANO Syntax Highlighting??
2007-03-30T05:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	best to bite the bullet and learn vim
2007-03-30T05:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	it takes concerted effort to learn, but well-worth it really
2007-03-30T05:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	yep
2007-03-30T05:38:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	help? :D
2007-03-30T05:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	why else would I be here? :-)
2007-03-30T05:39:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	To lead people up to a climax :P
2007-03-30T05:39:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	correct me if i'm wrong but, .vimrc is the file right?
2007-03-30T05:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	yes...
2007-03-30T05:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	.vimrc needs this I think: syntax on
2007-03-30T05:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	I think there is more
2007-03-30T05:40:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	Alright, Well I currently have a php highlighter set into it, I just really need to know how to add the BOLD attribute
2007-03-30T05:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	'hlsearch' is the vim parameter you need I think...
2007-03-30T05:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	with that configured, you can hit '*' or '#' and it highlights whatever word your cursor is on
2007-03-30T05:44:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	Nah, I want it so like, php constants would be bold text.
2007-03-30T05:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	I think maybe you are talking about 'themes' then <shrug>
2007-03-30T05:45:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	Maybe, i look at it as Syntax Highlighting
2007-03-30T05:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	in the context of vim, I think that is a 'color scheme' AFAICT
2007-03-30T05:48:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	I have downloaded a colorscheme, how do I apply it? I moved the file to ~/.vim/colors
2007-03-30T05:48:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	are you using gvim by any chance?
2007-03-30T05:48:00.000Z	nexous	Xenguy	no just VIM
2007-03-30T05:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	hrm, I'm not sure offhand; maybe you can search/locate other color schemes to find the right spot?
2007-03-30T05:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	nexous	maybe: :he color
