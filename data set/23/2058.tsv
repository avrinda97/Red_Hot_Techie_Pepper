2009-07-18T16:11:00.000Z	fjordlord	grawity	maybe there is just a way to mount the phone?
2009-07-18T16:11:00.000Z	grawity	fjordlord	If it doesn't show up as a storage device or such, no.
2009-07-18T16:12:00.000Z	fjordlord	grawity	so theres no way to get it working? its not supported by linux or what?
2009-07-18T16:14:00.000Z	fjordlord	grawity	what do you think?
