2009-08-02T11:29:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	What do you need help with?
2009-08-02T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	What sources did you add? what software are you hoping to get?
2009-08-02T11:31:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	those are all in the regular repositories.
2009-08-02T11:32:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	You probably just hadn't updated it.  You don't need any third party repositories for those things.  What's your sources.list curerntly?
2009-08-02T11:33:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	Alright, well, let's solve that problem then, instead of just trying to put a bandaid over the symptoms.
2009-08-02T11:34:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-08-02T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	alright, Do you still have your original sources.list handy? We'd like to get it back to the default.
2009-08-02T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	alright, go ahead and remove whatever you've got in there now and set it back to default.  Save it, and then in a terminal pastebin the output of the following command: sudo apt-get update
2009-08-02T11:38:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	edit your sources.list, and then paste in the default ones
2009-08-02T11:40:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	Just delete whatever you've added to it.
2009-08-02T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	alright, save it, and then pastebin the output of sudo apt-get update
2009-08-02T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	right, pastebin the output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2009-08-02T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	you pastebin it, get the URL, and give us the URL by saying it in this channel
2009-08-02T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	Alright, so, do you remember any of the packages you thought you didn't have?
2009-08-02T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	Well, I don't think you'll be missing any of them, so, lets go ahead and install build-essential, which will give you gcc and g++, sudo apt-get install build-essential
2009-08-02T11:51:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	it's compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-08-02T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	If you're searching for compiz-config-manager, it won't show up, since that's not anywhere in it.
2009-08-02T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	you have access to all of the software in main, restricted, and universe, which is almost everything in the repositories.  I guarantee to you that you'll have 95% of the same results.
2009-08-02T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	what?
2009-08-02T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	sure
2009-08-02T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	pastebin it
2009-08-02T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	shahzad	there wouldn't be significant additions from those, no.
