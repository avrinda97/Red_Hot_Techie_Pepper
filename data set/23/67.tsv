2012-09-04T18:04:00.000Z	hualet_		Nobody  helps me :-(
2012-09-04T18:05:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	do 'dpkg -l | grep libreoffice' and pastebin the result, please
2012-09-04T18:06:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	ok
2012-09-04T18:07:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	rc  libreoffice-common                     1:3.6.0~rc4-0ubuntu3~ppa1~precise1       office productivity suite -- arch-independent files
2012-09-04T18:09:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	can you figure out what' wrong?
2012-09-04T18:09:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	'rc' at the beginning of the line means you removed it - why don't you try 'sudo apt-get install libreoffice' and paste the output at eb> what is the difference between HomeDirUmask=022 and Dir_Mode=0770? Dirmode is in etc/adduser.conf homedirumask is in the likewise-open registry (for AD authentication)
2012-09-04T18:09:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	sorry - bad paste
2012-09-04T18:09:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	'rc' at the beginning of the line means you removed it - why don't you try 'sudo apt-get install libreoffice' and paste the output at http://paste.ubuntu.com
2012-09-04T18:15:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	i've done with pasting,
2012-09-04T18:15:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	can you share the URL?
2012-09-04T18:16:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	sorry, I'm not familar with that, that' the url :http://paste.ubuntu.com/1185831/
2012-09-04T18:18:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	what happens when you do 'LANG=C sudo apt-get -f install'?
2012-09-04T18:20:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	okay - what steps did you take after you noticed that libreoffice had 'disappeared'?
2012-09-04T18:21:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	and were there any other system changes you made (especially adding APT sources or PPAs) before libreoffice was removed?
2012-09-04T18:23:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	at first i did nothing, then someone told me that i should follow the documentation of libreoffice to uninstall libreoffice, so i removed the files that 'locate libreoffice 'has found
2012-09-04T18:25:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	you should always use the package manager (apt-get/aptitude, software center, synaptic) to make those sorts of changes - doing things manually like you did makes it very difficult and time-consuming to recover.  I would actually consider backing up your data and reinstalling if I were you :-/
2012-09-04T18:26:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	you remind me that i also uninstall the package listed when i typed in synaptic...so, I should just give up?
2012-09-04T18:27:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	if you've removed a lot of files manually, yes, I would probably recommend a reinstall
2012-09-04T18:28:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	it would be less frustrating and time consuming almost certainly
2012-09-04T18:30:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	reinstall? the message i've given you is what i got when i run 'sudo apt-get install libreoffice'
2012-09-04T18:36:00.000Z	yeats	hualet_	I would reinstall ubuntu altogether is what I'm saying.  However, someone else in the channel may be willing to help you undo the damage you did by manually deleting files
2012-09-04T18:37:00.000Z	hualet_	yeats	ok, thank you very much...
