2011-04-30T14:02:00.000Z	Chepoll		Question: Upon booting my computer, it said that a new release of namby or whatever was out, and that i should do-something-something. It installed a GB load of stuff, or so it said,and now I'm unable to do few things. I cannot launch Software-update-center, I cannot apt-get install conkeror, I cannot use my terminal emulator properly urxvt
2011-04-30T14:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	please be more precise
2011-04-30T14:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	some exact error messages would be a good start
2011-04-30T14:03:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	okay, firstly, my error from urxvt : when I try "clear" command, it says "rxvt-256color", unknown terminal type
2011-04-30T14:10:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	did not see one from you
2011-04-30T14:12:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	my error #1: before startx, I can launch "irssi" no problem. AFter I startx, when I try to launch irssi, it says "rxvt-256 color: unknown terminal type"
2011-05-04T16:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	whats the chipset, what does ifconfig show paste.ubuntu.com with ifconfig and lspci
2011-05-04T16:59:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	1 sec, doing so, I will have to manually type the output so give me a minute
2011-05-04T17:06:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	lspci output is very long for me to type letter by letter. Can you tell me what entry you are looking for so I can check for it
2011-05-04T17:07:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	the wired chipset
2011-05-04T17:10:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	ethernet controller is Realtek something something, do you want the specifics or is it another entry I am looking for?
2011-05-04T17:10:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	need the exact chipset
2011-05-04T17:11:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	Ethernet controller: realtex semiconductor co ltd rtl 8111/8168B prci express gigabit ethernet controller (rev01)
2011-05-04T17:12:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	**realtek
2011-05-04T17:12:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	**realtek
2011-05-04T17:12:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	**pci
2011-05-04T17:18:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	sorry, forgot to attach the ifconfig. Ifconfig for eth0 ::: link encap:ethernet hwaddr 00:1e:......
2011-05-04T17:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	what does sudo dhclient eth0    show? ie does it get a lease or not
2011-05-04T17:21:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	operation not permitted, I think I have to chattr resolv.conf , right?
2011-05-04T17:21:00.000Z	bazhang	Chepoll	what did you remove to get in that state?
2011-05-04T17:23:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	as in, the permission or not having connection? All I did was dpkg-reconfigure console-setup and -reconfigure keyboard-layout
2011-05-04T17:24:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	if I knew how I ended up like this, I would be much less frustrated. as a sidenote, this problem occured the same boot as I got prompted to update a couple of stuff and upgrade a couple of others. I don't think that's related though
2011-05-04T17:26:00.000Z	Chepoll	bazhang	also my /etc/network/interfaces has "lo", not "eth0". I never touched that file.
