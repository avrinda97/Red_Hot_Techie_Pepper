2012-11-01T18:03:00.000Z	n00bie		Does anyone here know how i can create an installer usb stick from ubuntu-12.04.1-server-i386.iso?
2012-11-01T18:04:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	what files were missing?
2012-11-01T18:07:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	ActionParsnip these files are missing with the usb creator from the correcponding desktop verion     http://paste.ubuntu.com/1323624/
2012-11-01T18:08:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	How did you get that output?
2012-11-01T18:08:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	What command?
2012-11-01T18:09:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	i mounted the finished new usb stick, cd into its root and executed md5sum -c md5sum.txt
2012-11-01T18:10:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	it runs fine until the end part of it which is the paste in question
2012-11-01T18:10:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	there are similar bugs around http://askubuntu.com/questions/127398/usb-drive-install-of-ubuntu-12-04-server-fails-cant-find-components-from-cd-r
2012-11-01T18:11:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	thats why i tried to use the correspondung desktop verion of 12.04.1 but it didnt help.
2012-11-01T18:12:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	Did you use an ISO or a CD when you created the USB ?
2012-11-01T18:12:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	md5 checked iso
2012-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	i read somewhere i could just dd the iso to the usb block device, just not sure if thats the right method for the boot loader
2012-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	didnt try that yet
2012-11-01T18:16:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	ActionParsnip seems like either the release iso is broken, the usb startup media creator of it or both
2012-11-01T18:24:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	Try xorriso
2012-11-01T18:26:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	you mean copy the files from the iso_ they arent there either
2012-11-01T18:27:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	Oh, the iso is missing the files. I get it now... sorry.
2012-11-01T18:27:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	Myabe you can just remaster the ISO and add them.
2012-11-01T18:28:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	its the release iso for the server 12.04.1 i368 idk where to get those missing files
2012-11-01T18:28:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	from desktop version
2012-11-01T18:30:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	what you mean with remaster it? i dont want the desktop version, btw the desktop verion doesnt have this issue
2012-11-01T18:31:00.000Z	vfw	n00bie	mount the iso, add the files, create new iso from the mount.
2012-11-01T18:40:00.000Z	n00bie	vfw	i found the missing files in the original iso file, just copied them over to the usb stick ... now the md5sum check completes without error, i just hope those files were the ment for usb sticks, idk why they were missing ...
