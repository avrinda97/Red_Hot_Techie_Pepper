2008-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	Sunnz2		Can't get my onboard ethernet to work
2008-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	Sunnz2		Any ideas?
2008-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	Sunnz2		I tried ifconfig and can't find it
2008-02-20T08:58:00.000Z	Sunnz2		There are no eth*
2008-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	Sunnz2		And the Network Manager thing doesn't have any ethernet device
2008-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	Sunnz2		So how do I get Ubuntu to detect and use my onboard ethernet?
2008-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	ifconfig eth0
2008-02-20T09:02:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	ifconfig
2008-02-20T09:02:00.000Z	Sunnz2	usr13	like I said I tried that
2008-02-20T09:04:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	Are you connecting to wireless network?
2008-02-20T09:04:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	Are you connecting to wired network?
2008-02-20T09:04:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	lspck |grep net
2008-02-20T09:04:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	What network card do you have?
2008-02-20T09:06:00.000Z	Sunnz2	usr13	don't you mean lspci | grep net?
2008-02-20T09:07:00.000Z	Sunnz2	usr13	          lspci | grep -i net only shows up my wireless device, but not the wired one.
2008-02-20T09:09:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	May not be supported.
2008-02-20T09:12:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	If we had more info on your particular ethernet device, we might be able to tell you what driver software to install.
2008-02-20T09:12:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	lshw
2008-02-20T09:16:00.000Z	Sunnz2	usr13	i did a lshw, can't find the network port in there
2008-02-20T09:17:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	lspci
2008-02-20T09:17:00.000Z	Sunnz2	usr13	i see things like usb0 which is also build-in to the board
2008-02-20T09:18:00.000Z	usr13	Sunnz2	Sorry, dono what to tell you.  Google it.  google.com/linux
