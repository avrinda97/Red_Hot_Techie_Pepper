2007-11-03T22:27:00.000Z	bulmer		Martha-> ethernet cable? or wifi?
2007-11-03T22:27:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	yeah, I loaded all the modules in the netfilter dir, just to be sure :)
2007-11-03T22:27:00.000Z	bulmer		todsah-> type  lsmod |grep ip  does iptables shows up on the list?
2007-11-03T22:28:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	ip_tables shows up.
2007-11-03T22:28:00.000Z	bulmer		Martha-> iwconfig    and whats the result?
2007-11-03T22:29:00.000Z	bulmer		todsah-> thats odd that you cant add a single rule
2007-11-03T22:29:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	yeah. And it also won't change the default chain policies.
2007-11-03T22:29:00.000Z	bulmer		todsah-> reboot and see if things get corrected
2007-11-03T22:29:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	it's like it ignores everything I throw at it.
2007-11-03T22:29:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	hm. k.
2007-11-03T22:30:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	I did mostly strip a desktop ubuntu of all things desktopy, maybe that's the problem.
2007-11-03T22:31:00.000Z	bulmer		Martha-> what is the name of your AP essid? maybe you are detecting a neighbors?
2007-11-03T22:32:00.000Z	bulmer		needhel2-> thats a conflicting statement
2007-11-03T22:32:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	that fixed it.. thanks! Any idea what might've been the problem, or is it just a mystery-reboot-fix?
2007-11-03T22:32:00.000Z	bulmer		needhel2-> but you can ifdown eth0
2007-11-03T22:33:00.000Z	bulmer		todsah-> mystery...
2007-11-03T22:33:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	Mmm, an untrustworthy firewall. shit :-P Well, thanks for the help anyway!
2007-11-03T22:34:00.000Z	bulmer		Martha-> access point, have you also at least google for some tutorials on wireless or you expect us to tell you everything?
2007-11-03T22:35:00.000Z	bulmer		todsah-> what the heck are you talking about? you dislike what i told you?
2007-11-03T22:36:00.000Z	bulmer		Martha is not really that difficult, but you got to have some basic knowhow of what you wanted done
2007-11-03T22:37:00.000Z	todsah	bulmer	Nope, nothing you said. Just pointing out that it's too bad we probably won't figure out what the problem was. Guess I just got to hope it won't happen again.
2007-11-03T22:38:00.000Z	bulmer	todsah	yeah sometimes things happens that we dont have the explanations
