2012-02-16T11:36:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	did you back up xorg.conf before making alterations?
2012-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	yup
2012-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.confg /etc/X11/xorg.conf.broken
2012-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	you should probably fix my typo though...
2012-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	that's to back up your broken xorg.conf
2012-02-16T11:43:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	then sudo cp /path/to/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf change the first part to the the actual location of your backup
2012-02-16T11:55:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	that's probably because you specified a relative path from somewhere other than '/'.
2012-02-16T11:56:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	use an absolute path, meaning start the path from / ie: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-02-16T11:58:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	its a capital X in X11
2012-02-16T12:00:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	i suggest getting more familiar with the command line...
2012-02-16T12:06:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	also what command ? bash should tell you, bash: fooberdeegook: command not found
2012-02-16T12:07:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	you'll have to type in the *exact* command he gave you
2012-02-16T12:09:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	ls -lh /etc/X11/xorg.conf*
2012-02-16T12:13:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	can it ends with .config ?
2012-02-16T12:17:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	try this: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.config /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-02-16T12:19:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	i wanted you to verify that what you posted was correct, since you previously mentioned you were typing in chat from another computer
2012-02-16T12:21:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	waht command isn't found? what are you typing? what is the exact output?
2012-02-16T12:25:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	make sure you have sudo cp befoer thoose file names
2012-02-16T12:32:00.000Z	overclucker	shellcode84	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.config /etc/X11/xorg.conf
