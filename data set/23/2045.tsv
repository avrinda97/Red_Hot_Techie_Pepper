2009-07-23T19:59:00.000Z	crazysoul		i am currently running(not succesfully) kernel 2.6.28.3.1-rt (realtime(, anybody know how i could install a previous rt??
2009-07-23T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	older versions are in synpatic/repos you need to change your policy
2009-07-23T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	try it without the real time kernel
2009-07-23T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	try to narrow it down
2009-07-23T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	define crash
2009-07-23T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	it reboots on it's own ? that sounds like a hardware error
2009-07-23T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	any error with any hardware
2009-07-23T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	that doesn't mean it's not a hardware problem
2009-07-23T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	that means nothing in reality
2009-07-23T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	that doesn't mean anything
2009-07-23T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	look up a livecd called "Stress Linux" see if that works or how hard you can stress it
2009-07-23T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	again that sounds like a hardware issue,
2009-07-23T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	a OS crash would put stuff on screen normally
2009-07-23T21:03:00.000Z	crazysoul	ikonia	i have burned this "stress linux" but when i boot from it, after a few screens of text it ends wit "kernel panic - no syncing: attempted to kill init!"
2009-07-23T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	interesting,
2009-07-23T21:04:00.000Z	crazysoul	ikonia	what could that mean?
2009-07-23T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	well, it depends what's not syncing, that's normally a complain about disk devices, but there are other options
2009-07-23T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	can you get a few lines above that error ?
2009-07-23T21:05:00.000Z	crazysoul	ikonia	can we maybe talk in private about this, difficult to find all the messages between everyone elses talk
2009-07-23T21:05:00.000Z	ikonia	crazysoul	yeah, hang on
2009-07-23T22:53:00.000Z	crazysoul	ikonia	i know you said it would take min. 8 hours, but it seems to be ready
2009-07-23T22:57:00.000Z	crazysoul	ikonia	told me a "memtest" would take a minimum of 8 hours to finish, but it only took 1hour16minutes, anybody got a clue on this?
2009-07-24T18:01:00.000Z	crazysoul	ikonia	you there?
