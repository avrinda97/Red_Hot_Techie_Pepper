2007-05-30T12:48:00.000Z	Slart		bah.. my mouse just died... anyone know what part of gnome is responsible for handling the mouse? can I restart some subprocess to make it work again?
2007-05-30T12:49:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	X handles the mouse, not Gnome, i would just unplug it and plug it back in
2008-08-19T03:51:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	nah, the 'sd' one is quite common
2008-08-19T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	it is? ah.. I've got it too.. nevermind then.. thanks for the heads up
2008-08-19T20:48:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	what does axf do?
2008-08-19T20:49:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	man ps
2009-03-30T04:18:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	personally I think we should be honest... linux has its good sides and bad sides..
2009-03-30T04:18:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	I'm not saying that it doesn't
2009-03-30T04:18:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	ok, then I agree.. =)
2009-05-10T12:42:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	being a ubuntu-based distro I suppost it uses apt... just like daddy =)
2009-05-10T12:43:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	ha, well i found the website but it's in chinese - i can't read that :)

2009-08-06T00:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	it's fine here. depends on how fast the system is.
2009-08-06T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	oh.. I have to give it a go again then..
2009-08-22T13:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	why #ubuntu+1?
2009-08-22T13:33:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	I got the impression you were discussing sound on Karmic.. my bad
2009-08-22T13:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	np. I don't run alpha or beta releases.
2010-08-12T14:19:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	assembly code drives the bus? please tell me that was a huuuuuuge simplification
2010-08-12T14:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	care to re-simplify?
2010-08-12T14:20:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	"assembly is the code that drives the bus" ..
2010-08-12T14:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	either re-simplify or do something useful, don't attack me.
2010-08-12T14:22:00.000Z	Slart	Gnea	wasn't meant as an attack.. apologies..
2010-08-12T14:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Slart	no problem.
