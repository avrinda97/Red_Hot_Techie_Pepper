2008-05-03T04:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	how much ram do you have?
2008-05-03T04:36:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	2.5gb
2008-05-03T04:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	start by creating a swap space at the beginning of the drive, about 3g
2008-05-03T04:36:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	It looked like this before, deleted the partitions in extended     http://home.oscarfranzen.se/gparted-part.png
2008-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	do you want a separate home directory?
2008-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	Oggu		no
2008-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	* partition?
2008-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	just an ext partiton for my files
2008-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	Oggu		ubuntu is on sda3
2008-05-03T04:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	right click the /dev/sda3 and choose edit,  I think you should be able to expand its size
2008-05-03T04:38:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	think i have to unmount it then..
2008-05-03T04:39:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	yes
2008-05-03T04:39:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	tou mean expand it, and the ntake away space at the end and create my new?
2008-05-03T04:40:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	sorry, I didnt follow that
2008-05-03T04:40:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	Do you mean that i shoukld expand my sda3 with the space beetwen it and my new swap. then decrease it and put all the free space at the end
2008-05-03T04:41:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	why do you want the free space at the end?
2008-05-03T04:41:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	http://home.oscarfranzen.se/gparted-part3.png
2008-05-03T04:41:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	So I can create a new large partition
2008-05-03T04:42:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	why not just expand the current one to fill the space?
2008-05-03T04:42:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	i want 50gb sda5 for ubuntu and 150+30 for a large file partition
2008-05-03T04:42:00.000Z	Oggu	danbhfive	50gb sda3*
2008-05-03T04:43:00.000Z	danbhfive	Oggu	i see, well, I don't know.  I'm sure gparted can do it for you.  I bet there is a move partition option.  I would click around.  If it is greyed out, then you probably need to use the livecd
