2011-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	Make sure both 'Desktop Cube' and 'Rotate Cube' are enabled in !ccsm.  Then, in General Options --> Desktop Size, set the horizontal virtual size to 4.  Then you can grab the desktop with control+alt+left-mouse-button, and drag the cube around, or rotate the cube with control+alt+left/right.
2011-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	You really need to upgrade your ubuntu
2011-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	What graphics card is it?
2011-01-28T13:27:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	Ok. Pastebin the output of 'compiz --replace ccp' from your terminal to ubuntu.pastebin.com
2011-01-28T13:31:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	That output is normal which means compiz should be working
2011-01-28T13:34:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	I told you already
2011-01-28T13:35:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	1) Open ccsm by typing ccsm in your terminal or finding it in sys>prefs> 2) In General Options > Desktop Size, set the horizontal virtual size to 4. 3) Done.
2011-01-28T13:37:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	Or have a 2 sided cube forever, it's really up to you :p
2011-01-28T13:43:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	A skydome is the background image you see when rotating the cube. It can be set in ccsm>Desktop>Desktop Cube>Appearance>Skydome.  Skydome images can be jpeg, png, or svg (if the relevant image-handling plugin is loaded).
2011-01-28T13:45:00.000Z	x20twelve	soreau	is there a way to use an animated gif file? would it function the same way?
2011-01-28T13:46:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	no, there is no gif plugin in compiz
2011-01-28T13:54:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	Do you have jpg plugin enabled?
2011-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	x20twelve	soreau	where would i find plugins to be enabled or disabled?
2011-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	In ccsm
2011-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	In the upper left, there is a Filter box. Type 'jp' there
2011-01-28T14:17:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	You don't
2011-01-28T14:18:00.000Z	soreau	x20twelve	What are you trying to do exactly?
