2008-04-26T08:22:00.000Z	TropicalDude		Do i just ask thing here?
2008-04-26T08:22:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	aye
2008-04-26T08:26:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	what kernel are you using the generic?
2008-04-26T08:27:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	you need the generic kernel
2008-04-26T08:30:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	no need; the generic 32bit is fine; do a search in synaptic
2008-04-26T08:32:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	what should I look in synaptyc? generic kernel ?
2008-04-26T08:32:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	hang on a sec let me check
2008-04-26T08:36:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	no real need for 64 bit at this point; very few apps and many things can be more work to get going
2008-04-26T08:37:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	I think because Im a n00b I will put 64bit on stand by, so now I have to 1) fresh install 2) Figure out to make work dual core.
2008-04-26T08:37:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	why re-install?
2008-04-26T08:38:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	because I cant see dual activity CPU
2008-04-26T08:38:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	install the generic kernel then
2008-04-26T08:39:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	how :)? from synaptic?
2008-04-26T08:40:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	that would be best choice yes--be sure it is the 24 and not the 22 however (if this is an upgrade and not a fresh install)
2008-04-26T08:42:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	I have now 2.6.24-16-386, And how do I install the one you recommend?
2008-04-26T08:43:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	open up synaptic and search for generic and then choose the correct kernel to install
2008-04-26T08:44:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	thanks , now trying
2008-04-26T08:46:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	In synaptic description this one says: Complete Generic Linux kernel This package will always depend on the latest complete generic Linux kernel available.
2008-04-26T08:46:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	sounds good
2008-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	installing, thank you very much, will post how it does when done.
2008-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	will require a restart
2008-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	TropicalDude	bazhang	great!
2008-04-27T12:17:00.000Z	bazhang	TropicalDude	glad you solved it ;]
