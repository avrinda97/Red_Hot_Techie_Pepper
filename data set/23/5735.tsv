2006-09-24T11:32:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Yay internetness.
2006-09-24T11:33:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Punjabi: some packages depend on other packages to function.
2006-09-24T11:35:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Punjabi, what problems are you having?
2006-09-24T11:36:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Punjabi: if apt-get install xserver-xgl isn't good enough for you, try google.
2006-09-24T11:36:00.000Z	ArrenLex		!xgl
2006-09-24T11:37:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Geoffrey: something we can help you with, or just a random comment?
2006-09-24T11:38:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Punjabi: I love Debian.
2006-09-24T11:39:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Geoffrey: can you tell me why you want to run a windows-based DVD player?
2006-09-24T11:39:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Punjabi: yes, I know that, duh. But ubuntu is basically debian + whorishness of name
2006-09-24T11:40:00.000Z	ArrenLex		The only reason I run ubuntu is because of a bug that made it into Debian Testing with libpango that stopped rendering text in GTK applications and made my system unusable.
2006-09-24T11:41:00.000Z	cpw	ArrenLex	maybe both?
2006-09-24T11:44:00.000Z	ArrenLex	cpw	Discuss that with Shawn Hogan.
2006-09-24T11:47:00.000Z	cpw	ArrenLex	wow, that guy sounds bored
2006-09-24T11:47:00.000Z	ArrenLex	cpw	what guy is this now?
2006-09-24T11:47:00.000Z	cpw	ArrenLex	through a couple of million at a lawsuit?  Why not, it's a sunny tuesday!
2006-09-24T11:47:00.000Z	cpw	ArrenLex	this Shawn Hogan fellow
2006-09-24T11:47:00.000Z	ArrenLex	cpw	he's not bored, he's fighting against what he believes is an abuse of power.
2006-09-24T11:49:00.000Z	ArrenLex	cpw	the upgrade notes are SECRET!
2006-09-24T11:50:00.000Z	ArrenLex	cpw	you shouldn't even be seeing them. They're classified by the FBI.
2006-09-24T11:50:00.000Z	ArrenLex	cpw	if you ever tell anyone we showed you the 6.06 release notes, we will have to kill you.
2006-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	ArrenLex	cpw	have fun. Make sure you can talk to yourself for hours though if you do.
2006-09-24T11:36:00.000Z	cpw	ArrenLex	well in one of the Japanese community sites I frequent, there's a community with about 485 people in it
2006-09-24T11:36:00.000Z	cpw	ArrenLex	so I'm sure if I dropped a line I'd get SOME action :P
