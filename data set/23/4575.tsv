2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin		Man, this sucks. I wanna get to Windows!
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin		shiester: I get GRUB Error 21
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin		:shiester: I can't mount my hard drives either.
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin		Can anyone help me fix my GRUB error?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	What's the error?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin	Bothered	I have had Ubuntu erase hdb and install on it, and now when I reboot I get "GRUB stage 1.5 GRUB Error 21"
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	You may have installed to a drive that can't be accessed by the bios
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	Have you installed to a firewire drive?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin	Bothered	No. It's a Quantam Fireball 20gb
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin	Bothered	It's from a few years ago
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	Is it internal? SATA or IDE?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin	Bothered	It's internal IDE
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	Hmm, it might not be enabled in the bios
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	It is possible to install to a drive that can be accessed from a linux system (e.g. a Live CD) but not at boot time
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	I did it once
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin	Bothered	Anyway for me to fix that?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	I would check that the drive is enabled in your bios
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	If it is, try re-installing
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin	Bothered	How do I do that?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	Take care with bios settings
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	It varies from machine to machine, I can't really help you with that
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Bothered	`Kevin	sorry
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	`Kevin	Bothered	Damn. Stupid Dell >_>
