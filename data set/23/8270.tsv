2004-11-19T11:40:00.000Z	jamaas		Is there an award for most obscure question of the day/week ??  ;)
2004-11-19T11:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	we can start one :)
2004-11-19T11:43:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	Great idea but just to warn you, the rest of you don't have a chance ... I can dig em up from places you wouldn't even dream of  ... :-!
2004-11-19T11:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	heh
2004-11-19T11:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	firstly why are you compiling your own version of Gnome ?
2004-11-19T11:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	try installing libldap2-dev
2004-11-19T11:49:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	It doesn't show up for me in synaptic, where might it be hidden ?
2004-11-19T11:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	you probably have to add the universe repository
2004-11-19T11:50:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	I have and don't find it there ... :-(
2004-11-19T11:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	did you do an update of the repositories ?
2004-11-19T11:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	apt-get update or in Synaptic click the reload button
2004-11-19T11:51:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	now there's a good question, not in the last couple of days but will now, back in a minute, thanks
2004-11-19T12:01:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	Still digging and don't find open-ldap-dev   or anything for that matter that is ldap except something from sourceforge and I don't think its that one!?
2004-11-19T12:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	are you running warty or hoary
2004-11-19T12:06:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	warty
2004-11-19T12:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	you don't have the universe repository enabled
2004-11-19T12:07:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	thought I did, how can I make sure ..
2004-11-19T12:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	easiest is to run synaptic then >> settings >>reposiroties
2004-11-19T12:09:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	I think you got me, how do I add universe?
2004-11-19T12:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	click the ubuntu repsoitory (that has main in the section)  add the sections to look like this >> main restricted universe
2004-11-19T12:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jamaas	there you go
2004-11-19T12:15:00.000Z	jamaas	LinuxJones	Kamion I'm thrilled for the help really but you guys go so fast yo loose where am I now .. I do have universe installed
