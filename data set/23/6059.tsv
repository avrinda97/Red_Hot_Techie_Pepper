2006-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME		I am unable to play Gnome NetHack. This is unacceptable as I am highly addicted and have not yet ascended. When I run the file, nothing happens at all. Any ideas why this might be?
2006-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 nethack-gnome at the command line should give you some error messages
2006-10-28T11:11:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 add yourself to the games group
2006-10-28T11:11:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	how?
2006-10-28T11:15:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	there is no games group. I created it and added myself to it, to no avail. same strange errors
2006-10-28T11:16:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 sec i'm installing it
2006-10-28T11:20:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	dhn_: I just noticed this at the end of the error counts: Perhaps there is an old /var/games/nethack/perm_lock around? Edgy dhn
2006-10-28T11:20:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 check   ps aux | grep nethack   also   ls -l /var/games/nethack/perm_lock
2006-10-28T11:21:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 maybe it crashed first time you tried to run it or something.
2006-10-28T11:22:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	how does one unlock it?
2006-10-28T11:22:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 sudo rm /var/games/nethack/perm_lock
2006-10-28T11:24:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	ah, ok, so it runs, then as soon as I choose my orcish barbarian female, the game crashes
2006-10-28T11:24:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	I would agree
2006-10-28T11:24:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 might try nethack-x11
2006-10-28T11:24:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	I tried x11, qt, all the others
2006-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	I WINEed the win version... it was Very slow. is that typical?
2006-10-28T11:25:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	meaning you use sth else?

2006-10-28T11:31:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	in the telnethack, must my name always be my username? or can I specify it?
2006-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	wastrel	AkumAPRIME	 your name will always be your username, but you can create a new username whenever you want to
2006-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	AkumAPRIME	wastrel	and apply it to the same email address?
