2008-03-17T21:55:00.000Z	r3n0c		hey, i get this error when i try to install ubuntu 7.10 64 on my desktop.... after it finishes installation: can't find os
2008-03-17T21:55:00.000Z	r3n0c		i had it install over my previous windows install on one of the drives.
2008-03-17T21:56:00.000Z	r3n0c		after i install ubuntu 7.10 on my desktop, i can't load it.  does it matter that i put it on a sata drive or anything like that?
2008-03-17T21:58:00.000Z	r3n0c		anybody know why, after installing ubuntu 7.10 64 on my desktop, that it won't load after a restart?
2008-03-17T21:58:00.000Z	r3n0c		i told it to do a install taking up an entire disk
2008-03-17T21:58:00.000Z	DaemonLee	r3n0c	Did you install GRUB or LILO?
2008-03-17T21:58:00.000Z	r3n0c	DaemonLee	grub
2008-03-17T21:58:00.000Z	DaemonLee	r3n0c	did it install perfectly, no problems?
2008-03-17T21:58:00.000Z	r3n0c	DaemonLee	yeah, it finished, then told me to restart, so i do
2008-03-17T21:59:00.000Z	DaemonLee		Do you get a warning stating "NO OPERATING SYSTEM" or something like that?
2008-03-17T21:59:00.000Z	r3n0c	DaemonLee	yeah, or like can't find OS
2008-03-17T22:00:00.000Z	DaemonLee	r3n0c	try an reinstall. Sounds like GRUB/LILO didn't install right.
2008-03-17T22:00:00.000Z	r3n0c	DaemonLee	did it 2x already
2008-03-17T22:00:00.000Z	DaemonLee	r3n0c	 are you dual-booting?
2008-03-17T22:01:00.000Z	r3n0c	DaemonLee	no, i told it to overwrite the old windows partition
2008-03-17T22:01:00.000Z	r3n0c	DaemonLee	 the error is: "error loading operating system"
2008-03-17T22:01:00.000Z	DaemonLee		Are you using the LiveCD or Alt Installer?
2008-03-17T22:02:00.000Z	r3n0c		Live cd, 64bit 7.10
2008-03-17T22:03:00.000Z	r3n0c	DaemonLee	is there a way to make sure that the drive is formatted with the ubuntu livecd? i tried running the partion manager but it takes forever to load
2008-03-17T22:03:00.000Z	DaemonLee	r3n0c	 Try using the Alt Installer, as it has more output.
2008-03-17T22:04:00.000Z	DaemonLee	r3n0c	The Alt Installer is the best, it's more verbose and works great, then the LiveCD atleast in my opinion.
2008-03-17T22:04:00.000Z	r3n0c		does it matter that in the beginning it does give some error about /mnt/manager or something like that, saying that there is no disk space left, but then it just continues
2008-03-17T22:05:00.000Z	DaemonLee	r3n0c	Yes, that's bad. Again, the Alt Installer might work alot better.
