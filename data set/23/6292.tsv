2007-01-30T08:11:00.000Z	gili		simple multimedia question - i want something basic to do xvid/divx avi files to DVD format
2007-01-30T08:12:00.000Z	gili		without command line
2007-01-30T08:12:00.000Z	blanky	gili	http://www.kde-apps.org search "kmpg2"
2007-01-30T09:45:00.000Z	blanky	gili	read up on mencoder and ffmpeg
2007-01-30T09:38:00.000Z	gili	blanky	u had mentioned kmpg2 for xvid to DVD mpeg conversion
2007-01-30T09:38:00.000Z	blanky	gili	yeah
2007-01-30T09:38:00.000Z	blanky	gili	:)
2007-01-30T09:42:00.000Z	gili	blanky	i am looking for a simple xvid to dvd converter that does basic menus and standar output to VIDEO_TS folders (vob files)
2007-01-30T09:42:00.000Z	blanky	gili	didn't kmpg2 work?
2007-01-30T09:43:00.000Z	gili	blanky	i want something a bit moredirect for making simple dvd menus and VOB file outputs
2007-01-30T09:43:00.000Z	blanky	gili	oh really, sorry I don't know :(
2007-01-30T09:44:00.000Z	blanky	gili	but the command line are typically the best, in fact, most GUIs are typically just front ends to those command line solutions, and the command line solutions can be really helpful and quicker to use
2007-01-30T09:45:00.000Z	gili	blanky	i dont mind the command line...and i am willing to learn
2007-01-30T09:46:00.000Z	blanky	gili	mencoder and ffmpeg
2007-01-30T09:46:00.000Z	gili	blanky	i am just not the only one here using this machine.... there are people here that are used to standard GUI xvid to dvd who will never use the command line
2007-01-30T09:48:00.000Z	blanky	gili	Well, I'm sorry, I don't know of any GUIs, maybe you can find some though, I know about MeWig, the GUI front end for mencoder on windows, maybe there's a similar one, search synaptic, also look for a GUI front end to ffmpeg
2007-01-30T09:48:00.000Z	blanky	gili	if not, looks like you're on your own, but creating front ends are simple, such as using Kommander, which is what kmpg2 was written in I believe
2007-01-30T09:50:00.000Z	gili	blanky	it is one of those things that is the only reason why i still have to dualboot to windows....like i said i dont mind getting my hands dirty and learning mencoder and ffmpeg commands but the others here have tons of xvids they like burning to dvd's and they want a quick and simple solution.
2007-01-30T09:50:00.000Z	gili	blanky	it took me forever to persuad them to go the ubuntu way....
2007-01-30T09:51:00.000Z	blanky	gili	Again, if you don't mind, search for GUI front ends in synaptic or on the net, you could also simply learn the terminal way, and write simple scripts that can extremely easy automate the process, even more so than a GUI
2007-01-30T09:51:00.000Z	blanky	gili	but I understand you
2007-01-30T09:51:00.000Z	gili	blanky	yeah....thats not a bad idea
2007-01-30T09:52:00.000Z	gili	blanky	anyways....thanks
