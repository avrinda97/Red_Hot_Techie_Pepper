2005-03-09T09:36:00.000Z	regeya		hehe
2005-03-09T09:37:00.000Z	regeya		oh crap.  I forgot I had a Safari subscription. :-/
2005-03-09T09:37:00.000Z	regeya		guess I'll get billed for another month. :-(
2005-03-09T09:37:00.000Z	regeya		free money to oreilly from regeya
2005-03-09T09:38:00.000Z	regeya		indeed
2005-03-09T09:39:00.000Z	regeya		why an icon?
2005-03-09T09:39:00.000Z	regeya		I see what you're saying, but I don't see that as the "OMFG THAT RAWKS" type of thing
2005-03-09T09:39:00.000Z	regeya		it should be possible to script that sort of thing easily...
2005-03-09T09:40:00.000Z	regeya		then again, I'd like to do drag-and-drop multi-session in OS X too, and scripting such a thing might be neat.  darn you linux_galor1 now I'll have to think about it ;-)
2005-03-09T09:41:00.000Z	regeya		it should be possible to a.) make an iso of the files you drop on an icon and b.) burn a session to disc; must utilize poopatorium first, though.
2005-03-09T09:41:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	someone said I could make a script and the icon runs the script but so far Im not having any luck
2005-03-09T09:42:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	its also multi session
2005-03-09T09:43:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	in one case he said he could turn the CD-RW into a hardisk (slow one) and just drop and delete files
2005-03-09T12:43:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	yeah best promoter of Linux is Microsoft
2005-03-09T12:45:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	not really Microsoft arent that big
2005-03-09T12:45:00.000Z	regeya	linux_galor1	don't be so sure
2005-03-09T12:45:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	external intrest rates on bonds/cash would do more damage than microsoft
2005-03-09T12:46:00.000Z	regeya	linux_galor1	think about how many people are closing in on retirement age, how many of them have retirement funds, and how many retirement funds lean on stocks like ms.
2005-03-09T12:46:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	not mine lol
2005-03-09T12:47:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	actually IBM has more retirement funds stocks.....dont forget Microsoft is the 17th biggest company in the USA ....IBM is in the top 5
2005-03-09T12:49:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	see the RMS article that shows Bill as saying in 1992 ....if patents existed Microsoft would have never got were it was.... imagine Microsoft trying to shaft IBM on the OS/2 joint venture and taking the code and creating NT 3 if patents existed back in 1990
2005-03-09T12:51:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	no it shows how Bill is two faced.........one minute he says patents are bad for business and admits if they were around Micosofts profits would be very low and now Bills running around saying patents are a must
2005-03-09T12:54:00.000Z	linux_galor1	regeya	well the latest worry is the USA will be the cause of the next stock crash as the USA defaults on all its debt
