2008-03-05T17:32:00.000Z	netsrot		hi, how do I get swedish chars to work in terminal outside X?
2008-03-05T17:33:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	you have the language support installed for swedish language?
2008-03-05T17:33:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	I don't know, how do I check? I don't use gnome or kde btw.
2008-03-05T17:34:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	what do you use for a package manager?
2008-03-05T17:34:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	synaptic
2008-03-05T17:34:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	could you please go into synaptic and search for swedish
2008-03-05T17:35:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	I'm working on it.
2008-03-05T17:35:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	nope
2008-03-05T17:36:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	then you need to install it--for system wide, open office or whatever you need
2008-03-05T17:37:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	I want all programs to keep talking english while supporting swedish characters to be typed.
2008-03-05T17:38:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	should I install language-pack-sv and language-pack-sv-base?
2008-03-05T17:38:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	sounds like a plan ;]
2008-03-05T17:39:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	and then just reboot and it works?
2008-03-05T17:42:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	well then you need to go into system preferences keyboard and add swedish as a layout to your kb
2008-03-05T17:51:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	I have set that to swedish and still I don't get swedish chars outside X.
2008-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	in the keyboard layout you have to define the trigger key that will switch between the layouts
2008-03-05T17:59:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	no
2008-03-05T18:00:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	you have not enabled the switch or cannot find it or what--not sure what your 'no' means here
2008-03-05T18:00:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	I only have one layout that is swedish, how could I possibly switch layouts?
2008-03-05T18:01:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	I don't have swedish working, I want swedish =)
2008-03-05T18:02:00.000Z	netsrot	bazhang	I want swedish to work outside X, you know the terminal you get to when pressing ctrl+alt+F1
2008-03-05T18:02:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	then go into keyboard, enable the swedish layout, install the swedish language support and define a trigger in the same place that you set the keyboard layout
2008-12-13T20:46:00.000Z	bazhang	netsrot	yep
