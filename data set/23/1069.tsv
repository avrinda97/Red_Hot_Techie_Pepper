2010-09-25T09:04:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	nano
2010-09-25T09:05:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	ok and is this nano better than vim?
2010-09-25T09:05:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	it wears its manpage on the bottom two rows of the screen, making it easier for normal users than vim which results in "i couldnt figure out how to exit, so i hit the power button" ;-)
2010-09-25T09:06:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	:D
2010-09-27T08:22:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	then now?

2010-09-27T08:22:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	/msg nick hello
2010-09-27T08:23:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	oh you are talking about irc private message? i thought that it was im communication between two remote pcs
2010-09-27T08:24:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	i thought RK was asking for irc help since before was asking about highlighting
2010-09-27T08:24:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	ok
2010-11-01T08:40:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	lack of customisation options in GUI doesn't make it proprietary. you can get the code and edit it all you want
2010-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	yah
2010-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	i do agree that lack of customisation options is yucky though. this is why i use kde.
2010-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	yah kde is nice option in that case
2010-11-02T08:10:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	gnome and kde are both DEs. unity is just a shell
2010-11-02T08:10:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	the difference is unity doesnt have a whole new set of default aps
2010-11-02T08:11:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	so in naaty we will have unity on to of gnome?
2010-11-02T08:11:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	yep
2010-11-02T08:11:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	ok
2010-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	where is unity web site?
2010-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	maco	AbhiJit	i dont think it has a separate one
2010-12-22T10:06:00.000Z	AbhiJit	maco	:D
