2005-11-10T06:47:00.000Z	Arafangion		How do I *turn sound off*?
2005-11-10T06:48:00.000Z	Arafangion		I can adjust sound, etc, while the system is in use, but I just can't control the sounds that occur when the user is not logged in, ie, startup and shutdown sounds.
2005-11-10T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	you might be able to use amixer from a script to set the volumes at the right point
2005-11-10T06:49:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	Good idea.
2005-11-10T06:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	what I want is individual app sound control; kpig is very quiet, so I turn up the volume; then all other sounds make me jump :)
2006-06-12T07:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	why are you still using lilo?
2006-06-12T08:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	Because, as nice as grub is, it's fundamentally limited.
2006-06-12T08:00:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	If you want to use an entire system with LVM, you _have_ to use lilo.
2006-06-12T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	true, but only on old machines in my experience
2006-06-12T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	oh. I'll not claim an opinion there
2006-06-12T08:01:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	grub also only supports EXT2, and perhaps a few other partition formats.
2006-06-12T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	no, false. That seems to be fud
2006-06-12T08:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	no, lilo maps to the actual hard partition location. grub uses bios to locate the kernel
2006-06-12T08:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	grub needs to read the partition.
2006-06-12T08:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	precisley. Lilo does not
2006-06-12T08:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	Indeed.
2006-06-12T08:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	Presumeably, they would both be improved later. The bios is often slow, and buggy. Hardware is also buggy, but the software will work around them in time.
2006-06-12T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	to be truthful, I switched from lilo to grub with ubuntu. For my purposes, there was no real differences recently.
2006-06-12T08:14:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	In cases where grub works, it works better than lilo can ever hope to do so.
2006-06-12T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	google lilo heaven. I beg to differ.
2006-06-12T08:14:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	I speak from the experience of one who used to routinely compile his own kernels.
2006-06-12T08:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Arafangion	so do I, but pre-grub
2006-06-12T08:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	nickrud	:)
