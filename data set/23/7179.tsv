2006-01-18T09:10:00.000Z	soundray	Kyral	I use lynx -dump to read those.
2006-01-18T09:10:00.000Z	Kyral	soundray	ah

2006-02-25T14:25:00.000Z	soundray	Kyral	no, sorry, missed the line.
2006-02-25T14:26:00.000Z	soundray	Kyral	I shouldn't try to help, I can't even read straight :)

2006-04-02T10:00:00.000Z	soundray	Kyral	the HURD is incredibly well thought through and principled. But sometimes it takes a Linus-Torvalds-approach to get things that *work*.

2006-04-02T10:01:00.000Z	soundray	Kyral	no, I mean a pragmatic way of thinking.

2006-04-02T14:11:00.000Z	Kyral	soundray	given a spreadsheet, can it graph a best-fit line?
2006-04-02T14:12:00.000Z	soundray	Kyral	it has a linest function if that's what you mean.
