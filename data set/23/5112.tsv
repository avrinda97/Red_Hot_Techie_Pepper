2007-05-12T16:10:00.000Z	gortba		ok. lshw and sysinfo didn't work. I'll be more specific--I'm trying to see if my soundcard is working. How can I do this?
2007-05-12T16:11:00.000Z	gortba		It's a soundblaster
2007-05-12T16:11:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	cat /proc/asound/cards
2007-05-12T16:11:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	Trying that now.
2007-05-12T16:13:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	I did what you said but I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
2007-05-12T16:14:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	you should be looking at a list of the soundcards in your computer
2007-05-12T16:14:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	so if there's one there, then it looks like your soundcard is working
2007-05-12T16:15:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	Doesn't that also show the internal soundcard?
2007-05-12T16:17:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	yeah it should show the internal sound card too, unless you've disabled it in your bios config
2007-05-12T16:18:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	Can you please look at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/20421/ and tell me if my Sound Blaster is working?
2007-05-12T16:19:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	which sound blaster is it?
2007-05-12T16:19:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	The only info I have is a booklet. Do you mean 16 PCI
2007-05-12T16:20:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	it's a Soundblaster 16 PCI?
2007-05-12T16:21:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	cool ;-). I have an ISA one of them somewhere.
2007-05-12T16:21:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	I think the SiS card is your soundblaster
2007-05-12T16:21:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	Ok good--so it should be working then right?
2007-05-12T16:21:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	yep
2007-05-12T16:22:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	Then I don't know what to do because I don't get any sound at all from my computer.
2007-05-12T16:37:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	are you still around?
2007-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	yep
2007-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	gortba	funkyHat	would you mind helping me to try and get my sound up and running?
2007-05-12T16:40:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	hm. In that case you should direct your questions to #fedora ... I haven't used Fedora for years and anyway this channel is for help with Ubuntu.
2007-05-12T16:40:00.000Z	funkyHat	gortba	I agree with mneptok, install Ubuntu :-)
