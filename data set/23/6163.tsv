2006-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc		can anyone tell me how to change my ip address using ifconfig? i've tried restarting the networking services but it doesn't seem to try to pull dhcp
2006-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	change your ip? You mean your internal IP address?
2006-06-06T09:50:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- yes - right now it's got an ipv6 address setup that doesn't help me; i need it to get online (dns isn't important in my case)
2006-06-06T09:51:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	are you trying to get a static IP or are you using DHCP ?
2006-06-06T09:52:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- i would like ot use dhcp, but if that doesn't work i don't mind setting it to a static ip address [i'm using the live cd to get some data off of another hard drive that windows doesn't like] 
2006-06-06T09:53:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	are you running gnome ?
2006-06-06T09:53:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- no, that mcahine doesn't like X
2006-06-06T09:56:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	did you try ifup eth0 ?
2006-06-06T09:56:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- yes
2006-06-06T09:56:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	hmmm ... are you sure that is the correct device ... try ifup eth1
2006-06-06T09:56:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- there is no eth1, it's only th eloopbackup and eth0
2006-06-06T09:57:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	oh k. Well, I dunno then. I'd have to know a bit more about your internal network settings to try to troubleshoot
2006-06-06T09:58:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- what is it you need to know? i know the pool range...theres nothing else to know...
2006-06-06T09:58:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	what is your ip range ... and do you know which IPs are already taken ?
2006-06-06T09:59:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- i know everything that's taken; i can use anything from 2 to about 100, but i'm oging with 88
2006-06-06T10:01:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- can you help me in this case?
2006-06-06T10:06:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- did you log in?
2006-06-06T10:06:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	it connected me automoatically it seemed ... but ...
2006-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	did you receive my private messages ?
2006-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- did you receive mine..?
2006-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	errr ... no ...
2006-06-06T10:11:00.000Z	Iam8up|lpy|dsc	CokeNCode	- http://pastebin.com/762637
