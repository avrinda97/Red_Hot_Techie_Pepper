2006-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	SubMOA		opps... turns out, "Ctrl + X" isn't "cut"
2006-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	SubMOA		well I don't want to interrupt anybodies conversation, but can I ask a question?
2006-12-26T08:54:00.000Z	SubMOA		roger
2006-12-26T08:56:00.000Z	SubMOA		I am a recent covert to Linux from Windows (what else?) and I think I have an understanding of the Windows concept regarding programs (aka .exe files) but this Linux program thing is killing me... there are so many that do the same thing, is a .deb the same as a compiled .src (is .src right??) in .deb, what about non-debian, etc. etc. what's the dealio?
2006-12-26T08:58:00.000Z	SubMOA		True, true I have figured that out (after a LONG time) but I find that if I want something NOT in that list, say... Umm, well, I don't know, maybe something like gkrellm, and I can't, or the repository doesn't find it, what then?
2006-12-26T08:59:00.000Z	SubMOA		yes, Nickspoon
2006-12-26T08:59:00.000Z	SubMOA		ohh
2006-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	SubMOA		well, that was just an example *blushes* I thought it wasn't... I found a .deb for it, and I can kind-of get along with getting programs, I just odn't understand the way it works, I suppose
2006-12-26T09:01:00.000Z	SubMOA		Funkyhat, is it the case though, in windows, where only a .exe file can be run, where-as a a .zip is a .exe, but compressed (well, any file compressed, but for sake of argument...) etc. etc.  so the main executable is, well, .exe, right?
2006-12-26T09:02:00.000Z	SubMOA		maybe I just don't understand the actual basics of programs... any points to wiki, etc.?
2006-12-26T09:02:00.000Z	lupine_85	SubMOA	.exe does not an executable make
2006-12-26T09:20:00.000Z	SubMOA	lupine_85	they work ok for me, or at least I think they do... lol
2006-12-26T09:21:00.000Z	lupine_85	SubMOA	really? Because it seems to be off to la-la land right now :p
2006-12-26T09:22:00.000Z	SubMOA	lupine_85	perhaps...
2006-12-26T09:24:00.000Z	lupine_85	SubMOA	decompiler?
2006-12-26T09:25:00.000Z	lupine_85	SubMOA	then install it :p
2006-12-26T09:28:00.000Z	lupine_85	SubMOA	.h files mostly
2006-12-26T09:29:00.000Z	SubMOA	lupine_85	.h ?
2006-12-26T09:29:00.000Z	lupine_85	SubMOA	yes. .h
2006-12-26T09:29:00.000Z	SubMOA	lupine_85	what is that, exactly, or, rather, should I just wiki or google it?
2006-12-26T09:31:00.000Z	SubMOA	lupine_85	what you're saying seems to make sense, but I can't pretend I understand it all... basically it's something like a library for programs written in C?
2006-12-26T09:31:00.000Z	lupine_85	SubMOA	it's how C programs know how to interface with a library
2006-12-26T09:31:00.000Z	SubMOA	lupine_85	oOo
