2008-03-18T13:18:00.000Z	CroX	bod_	Single user mode? :S
2008-03-18T13:19:00.000Z	bod_	CroX	at grub selection, choose the second boot option not the first
2008-03-18T13:19:00.000Z	CroX	bod_	Alright. When that has loaded, then what?
2008-03-18T13:20:00.000Z	bod_	CroX	dunno,.,. just gettin you half way there,. your new question,. is ,.,. how can i uninstall the ati drivers from command line?
2008-03-18T13:21:00.000Z	CroX	bod_	Heh. Righto.
2008-03-18T13:21:00.000Z	bod_	CroX	do you no the name of the package?

2008-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	CroX	bod_	No, a binary file I downloaded from there.
2008-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	bod_	CroX	why not use the ones ubuntu provide in restricted drivers?
2008-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	CroX	bod_	Because Google Earth wouldn't recognize the driver but said I should download drivers from ati.com instead.
2008-03-18T13:24:00.000Z	bod_	CroX	i would trust the ubuntu guys over ati guys any day,.,.;~)
2008-03-18T13:24:00.000Z	bod_	CroX	are you at the CLI?
