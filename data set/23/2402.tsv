2011-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	TikaTaka		does anyone know why the software center doesnt work when i try to install a program
2011-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	TikaTaka		is the amd64 distro of linux hardy likely to be more buggy than the x86 version ?
2011-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	TikaTaka		then how come i cant seem to install anything in the software center
2011-12-17T13:26:00.000Z	TikaTaka		which version is supported ?
2011-12-17T13:27:00.000Z	TikaTaka		well i did a net install using http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/ubuntu-installer
2011-12-17T13:27:00.000Z	TikaTaka		i assume it would be the latest?
2011-12-17T13:28:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	the latest stable-release is 11.10 (oneiric)

2011-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	to see all nicks here
2011-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	no
2011-12-17T13:26:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	but hardy is no longer supported (only the server edition)
2011-12-17T13:26:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	10.04 and everything higher
2011-12-17T13:27:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	that is 12.04
2011-12-17T13:27:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	which is not stable
2011-12-17T13:28:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	of course
2011-12-17T13:30:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
2011-12-17T13:31:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	or the amd64 if you need http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
2011-12-17T13:31:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	tftp? sounds like pxe
2011-12-17T13:32:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	if that is working, yes you only have to replace the iso
2011-12-17T13:32:00.000Z	iceroot	TikaTaka	but why pxe with a netinstall-image?
