2010-07-02T08:46:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	yes. same setup when it was running w7.
2010-07-02T08:46:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	the raid config in bios reports it as healthy and functional
2010-07-02T08:46:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	and yet you cant boot to win7
2010-07-02T08:48:00.000Z	wookienz		no, w7 is long gone...i installed ubuntu on the boot drive (/dev/sdc, a ssd). even when i resinatlled w7 back on the boot drive it couldnt access it though i may not have loadedd the driver at install time.

2010-07-02T08:52:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	I take it that sdc is not a part of fakeraid.  Where did you install the GRUB of ubuntu?
2010-07-02T08:52:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	sdc
2010-07-02T08:52:00.000Z	jnewbuntu		So with your BIOS set to sdc can you boot into ubuntu

2010-07-02T08:54:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	"set to sdc" i have a 6 port SATA stack. First 4 ports have  2 x 250gb drives (the raid 0) ie 2 not used. Port 5,6 is the ssd (sdc) and cdrom. BIOS is set to raid fro port 1-4 and IDe for port 5-6.
2010-07-02T08:54:00.000Z	wookienz		"set to sdc" ?
2010-07-02T08:57:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	are you able to boot into ubuntu?
2010-07-02T09:00:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	where i am now.
2010-07-02T09:01:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	I assuming you are able to get into ubuntu.  Can you fire up gparted.
2010-07-02T09:02:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	i started gparted about 30 minutes ago and it is stuck sitting on "searching /dev/sdb partitions"
2010-07-02T09:05:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	does sudo fdisk pdc_fhdeecgf give anything?
2010-07-02T09:06:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	actually sudo fdisk -l pdc_fhdeecgf
2010-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	nothign
2010-07-02T09:09:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	I am sorry, I am out of ideas.  tried whatever I knew of fakeraid here.  Hope someone else can help. Or you could try the forums - http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=331
2010-07-02T09:10:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	thanks for persisting. I have run out of time as well - got to hit the road. once again thanks.
2010-07-02T09:10:00.000Z	jnewbuntu	wookienz	My idea was to get to the /dev/mapper/xxxxx whatever and have it mounted in the fstab.  But that never fired
2010-07-02T09:11:00.000Z	wookienz	jnewbuntu	ok thanks.... im trying dmraid but im not sure if it supports my fake raid controller...ill wil continue later when i get back. once again thanks.
