2005-03-23T10:32:00.000Z	Absenth		working on it, thanks
2005-03-23T10:33:00.000Z	Absenth		so when I did the update/upgrade yesterday is that when I moved from the Warty iso I installed to Hoary?
2005-03-23T10:34:00.000Z	Absenth		assuming I finished with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade that is
2005-03-23T10:34:00.000Z	Absenth		I admit to being new to debian based linux.  Been using it for about a week.
2005-03-23T10:35:00.000Z	Absenth		beats the snot out of the FC3 install I have at work.
2005-03-23T10:36:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	no, as you still pointing to the warty sources. You can confirm by locking at your sources.lst in /etc/apt
2005-03-23T10:36:00.000Z	Absenth	Burgundavia	what can I put in the sources.lst in order to get what's current?
2005-03-23T10:37:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	warty is current stable hoary is unstable
2005-03-23T10:37:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	if you can live with things sometimes breaking, try out hoary
2005-03-23T10:37:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	yes, lots of people
2005-03-23T10:37:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	simple change all refs of warty to hoary in your sources.lst
2005-03-23T10:38:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	and then do a dist-upgrade
2005-03-23T10:39:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	not really
2005-03-23T11:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	more specific codeweavers(crossover makers) pay the lead wine dev
2005-05-04T09:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	xen is a virtualization tech, to allow two or many OS to run on the same hardware
2005-05-04T09:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	they are currently making it work in the mainline kernel, as the source is gpl
2005-05-04T09:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	after that work is finished, it will be part of the mainline kernel, like other drivers
2005-05-04T09:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	how it does it, be my guest
2005-05-04T09:01:00.000Z	Absenth	Burgundavia	yeah, Xen sounds exactly like an opensource, and therefore badass project like what vmware does.
2005-05-04T09:02:00.000Z	Absenth	Burgundavia	that site looks like it's a bootable CD, that you can then load other os's onto.  And it sounds like the next Novel Linux distro will include Xen.
2005-05-04T09:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	xen runs even lower than vmware
2005-05-04T09:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	novell is sponsoring it, I think
2005-05-04T09:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Absenth	I think suse 9.3 already includes it
