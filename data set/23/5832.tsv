2007-11-14T23:45:00.000Z	green__		how would i install the libburn package from svn?
2007-11-14T23:45:00.000Z	macogw	green__	first youd need to have subversion and build-essential installed
2007-11-14T23:46:00.000Z	green__	macogw	ok then?
2007-11-14T23:46:00.000Z	macogw	green__	you have those installed?
2007-11-14T23:47:00.000Z	macogw	green__	the program's website should tell you how to checkout the source.  it'll be "svn co" (co or checkout...either works) then the url to the source
2007-11-14T23:48:00.000Z	macogw	green__	once you get the source, cd into it, and if there's a file called "configure" run "./configure" if there's not, run "./autogen.sh" first, then ./configure then "make" then "make install"
2007-11-14T23:48:00.000Z	green__	macogw	thanks i'll try that
2007-11-14T23:54:00.000Z	green__	macogw	it keeps telling me no such file or directory
2007-11-14T23:54:00.000Z	macogw	green__	are you inside the directory where the source is?
2007-11-14T23:54:00.000Z	macogw	green__	and can you do "ls" and see if autogen.sh is there?
2007-11-14T23:55:00.000Z	macogw	green__	theres likely also a readme
2007-11-14T23:55:00.000Z	green__	macogw	yes i got the source, then ls then cd into libburn
2007-11-14T23:56:00.000Z	green__	macogw	then i ls again and tried to cd into any other colored lisyting
2007-11-14T23:56:00.000Z	macogw	green__	what files were in there?
2007-11-14T23:56:00.000Z	macogw	green__	any green-highlighted ones?
2007-11-14T23:57:00.000Z	green__	macogw	the colored ones?
2007-11-14T23:57:00.000Z	macogw	green__	well purple is for directories.  anything green?
2007-11-14T23:58:00.000Z	green__	macogw	theres cdrskin, doc, libburn, libcevap and test
2007-11-14T23:58:00.000Z	macogw	green__	ok and what's inside libbburn
2007-11-15T00:00:00.000Z	green__	macogw	those are the only ones listed that are purple
2007-11-15T00:02:00.000Z	macogw	green__	not purple.  green means executable
2007-11-15T00:03:00.000Z	green__	macogw	bootstrap
