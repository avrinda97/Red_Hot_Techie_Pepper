2006-10-31T11:01:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	you want the installer for linux
2006-10-31T11:01:00.000Z	GirlRiver	kmitch87	excellent .. thank you .. any special tips for downloading it or is it pretty straightforward?
2006-10-31T11:01:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	pretty straight foward.
2006-10-31T11:02:00.000Z	GirlRiver	kmitch87	anything I need to know to run the installer on ubuntu ?
2006-10-31T11:02:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	put the .so file in your firefox plugins directory
2006-10-31T11:03:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	plugins directory is in .mozilla/ i think
2006-10-31T11:04:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	chmod +x filename
2006-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	GirlRiver	kmitch87	have downloaded Beta 9 flash and there is only an . so & readme, there is no install script to make executable
2006-10-31T11:16:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	the .so file goes in your firefox plugin directory
2006-10-31T11:17:00.000Z	GirlRiver	kmitch87	should I uninstall Flash 7 first ?
2006-10-31T11:17:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	yes
2006-10-31T11:17:00.000Z	GirlRiver	kmitch87	how ?
2006-10-31T11:18:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	sudo aptitude purge flashplugin-nonfree
2006-10-31T11:18:00.000Z	GirlRiver	kmitch87	thanks
2006-10-31T11:19:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	after flash 7 is gone, the new .so file goes in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins.  You will need to mv it as root.
2006-10-31T11:21:00.000Z	GirlRiver	kmitch87	is there a way to run Ubuntu File Mgr as sudo or root ? (i'm a newb and need a gui)
2006-10-31T11:22:00.000Z	kmitch87	GirlRiver	run sudo mv file.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
