2009-07-12T23:47:00.000Z	twig11		Why would I keep getting a bad header error when I try to install anything under 9.04?
2009-07-12T23:48:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	can you pastebin the entire error message?

2009-07-12T23:50:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	that's strange, can you open any of those URLs in your web browser?
2009-07-12T23:58:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	if i just enter one of those URLs in my browser, it does a google search on it and displays results
2009-07-13T20:00:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	what do you need, anyway?
2009-07-13T20:01:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	I'm backing up my home folder to a fat drive and frostburn says I might want the userids in order to get permissions working when I import from the backup.
2009-07-13T20:02:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	when you copy something to a FAT drive, it loses all permissions and owner and group.
2009-07-13T20:02:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	unless you use 'tar' or something like that, of course.
2009-07-13T20:03:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	anyway, when you restore the files, you can just do "ls -l" on a user's directory, note the UID shown, then just add a new user with the same UID.
2009-07-13T20:08:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	What I've done so far is to individually back up the two user directories from /home. Will I be able to bring them back and drop them in /home after I reinstall? or do I have to back up /home as a whole?
2009-07-13T20:20:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	just want to know if I'm going to be really really sorry if I copied my two user directories separately out of /home to a fat drive or should I start over? The filesystem on the drive isn't really able to be changed right now unless I partition it, which I don't know how to do. Can I just go ahead as I am and come back here for help with permissions afterward or is that asking for trouble?
2009-07-14T23:34:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	on nano, you just press Ctrl-X to exit.
2009-07-14T23:35:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	I'm using visudo
2009-07-14T23:35:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	visudo just calls your default editor.
2009-07-14T23:35:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	does it say "GNU nano" on the first line?
2009-07-14T23:36:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	*slaps forehead* yeah it does. But I don't know how to use nano either.
2009-07-14T23:37:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	nano is the simplest one.
2009-07-14T23:37:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	just use arrow keys, and type. Use Ctrl-X to exit.

2009-07-18T00:13:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	thanks.
2009-08-12T21:05:00.000Z	grawity	twig11	Most of the time, compiling is easy... doesn't Evolution have an "import" option?
2009-08-12T21:07:00.000Z	twig11	grawity	Evolution has an import option, but it doesn't include .dbx
