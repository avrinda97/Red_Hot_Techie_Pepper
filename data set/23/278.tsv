2012-02-23T20:04:00.000Z	CalicoJack		Has anyone had any luck setting up a VPN on their home network? I want to be able to connect to a machine running Ubuntu Lucid server over VPN.

2012-02-23T20:05:00.000Z	Trevor69420	CalicoJack	using openvpn
2012-02-23T20:05:00.000Z	CalicoJack	Trevor69420	is that F/OSS?
2012-02-23T20:05:00.000Z	Trevor69420		F/OSS??? CalicoJack
2012-02-23T20:06:00.000Z	CalicoJack	Trevor69420	Free and Open Source Software
2012-02-23T20:06:00.000Z	Trevor69420		yea you are correct tjkent
2012-02-23T20:06:00.000Z	Trevor69420	CalicoJack	yes openvpn is free and open source
2012-02-23T20:07:00.000Z	Trevor69420	CalicoJack	the thing to know is if you plan to run vpn on your home server it helps to have a static IP address instead of dynamic
2012-02-23T20:07:00.000Z	Trevor69420		no i was saying it'd be an issue if her were moving large files
2012-02-23T20:07:00.000Z	Trevor69420		i agree with that
2012-02-23T20:07:00.000Z	Trevor69420		however not all systems can read other filesystems... and for his use it didnt sound like he was gonna be storing large files
2012-02-23T20:07:00.000Z	CalicoJack	Trevor69420	Not an issue, I'm going to be using it for a Minecraft server, so I'll just give my IP to my friends when we want to play. If it changes, no big deal
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	Trevor69420	CalicoJack	are you using a dedicated server?
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	CalicoJack	Trevor69420	yep
2012-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	CalicoJack	Trevor69420	Ubuntu Lucid Server edition
2012-02-23T20:09:00.000Z	Trevor69420		calicojack ok then u shouild be fine to use openvpn
2012-02-23T20:09:00.000Z	Trevor69420	CalicoJack	everyone will need the openvpn client which is included with the instuctions and package and they will all need a user account on the server

2012-02-23T20:10:00.000Z	CalicoJack	Trevor69420	thanks for getting me started, I think the documentation can take me the rest of the way :-)
2012-02-23T20:10:00.000Z	Trevor69420	CalicoJack	thsoe are for an older server release but SHOULD work for you
2012-02-23T20:11:00.000Z	Trevor69420		if you have issues CalicoJack you can also get help in #openvpn
