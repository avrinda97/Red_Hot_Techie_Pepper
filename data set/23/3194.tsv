2008-07-03T10:38:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	how have you connected upto the UT300RU? what kind of cable? usb or ethernet?
2008-07-03T10:41:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	well, you don't really need the USB cable -- the RJ45 ethernet cable should suffice
2008-07-03T10:51:00.000Z	Jaseem	unop	so should I disconnect USB?
2008-07-03T10:52:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	well, it doesn't make a difference whether or not  you have it connected -- but it might make your router behave differently and expect to be connected to via the rj45 cable
2008-07-03T10:53:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	what you will probably need to do is.  sudo dhclient eth0 # substitute the name of your interface here
2008-07-03T10:54:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	see what Fryguy-- just said
2008-07-03T10:57:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	 what does this command give you?   copy and paste it if you can.   ifconfig -a | perl -nle 'print $1 if /^(\S+)/'
2008-07-03T10:58:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	why ever so?
2008-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	ok, what are you booted into now?
2008-07-03T11:00:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	right -- well, make sure your usb cable is unplugged and the rj45 cable plugged in properly -- when you boot up ubuntu, run this command.  ifconfig  - to look for network interfaces that might have IP addresses set, if so, you probably can connect to the internet already
2008-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	ifconfig -a   # that is
2008-07-03T11:29:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	ok, well, basically -- all we need is the name of the interfaces -- things like  eth0, eth1, ath0, wlan0, etc
2008-07-03T11:30:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	ok .. do you know what an IP address looks like ??
2008-07-03T11:31:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	yea, basically -- which one of eth0 or eth1 has an ip address set?  if they both do, list them both
2008-07-03T11:34:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	well, yes and no -- basically, you haven't got a valid ip address on any of those interfaces -- try this.  sudo dhclient eth1
2008-07-03T11:35:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	ok
2008-07-03T11:36:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	you do know, that you can save files to your windows partition, incase you need to copy and paste data - that could help us help you
2008-07-03T11:36:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	it's what gets your network interface to tell the router to give it an ip address
2008-07-03T11:45:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	sudo dhclient eth1
2008-07-03T11:57:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	did you get something like - DHCPACK from 192.168.2.1 - bound to 192.168.1.1 ... ?
2008-07-03T11:58:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	so, you did get an ip address successfully - did you try browsing the net then?
2008-07-03T11:59:00.000Z	unop	Jaseem	well, you should have -- go back and try this again :) it ought to work alright
2008-07-03T15:13:00.000Z	Jaseem	unop	i still can't connect to internet.
