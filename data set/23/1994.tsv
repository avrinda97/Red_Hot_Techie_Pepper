2009-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	finga		can you help my with a alsa problem? my soundcard worked perfect, but after a hangup while a reboot it crackles extremly
2009-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	adjust the volume settings
2009-08-07T05:06:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	it has nothing to do with the gain
2009-08-07T05:07:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	how have you concluded that?
2009-08-07T05:10:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	because its the same volume it was bevore, i have a moto interface which runns stand alone and has a VU-meter on it and its exactlich -0,5 dB peak
2009-08-07T05:11:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	are you using only native alsa (no pulseaudio)?
2009-08-07T05:12:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	in the alsa mixer i've choosed HDA NVidia (alsa mixer) but there 5 to choose 3 of them are pulseaudio
2009-08-07T05:13:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	if its help its the standard ubuntu jaunty settings
2009-08-07T05:18:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	what ui are you looking at?
2009-08-07T05:18:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	ui?
2009-08-07T05:19:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	gnome
2009-08-07T05:20:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	meaning, are you using the gnome volume control applet, the sound preferences, or alsamixer in a terminal?
2009-08-07T05:22:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	i think its the gnome volume control i use a standard setup from debian jaunty with the standard mixer in the upper bar
2009-08-07T05:22:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	i tried alsaconfig but i get command not found, but alsa-utils is installed
2009-08-07T05:23:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	we don't ship alsaconf. it's broken.
2009-08-07T05:23:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	oh ok
2009-08-07T05:23:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	also, if you use the gnome sound preferences, make sure they're set to Autodetect
2009-08-07T05:25:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	i have all on autodetect, it worked bevore i did an reboot where ubuntu hang up, now it i got a crackle if i play something
2009-08-07T05:25:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	please use "ubuntu-bug pulseaudio"
2009-08-07T05:25:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	i will send you the only one errors i got if i enter sudo alsa force-reload
2009-08-07T05:25:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	how do i use it?
2009-08-07T05:26:00.000Z	dtchen	finga	just type that command
2009-08-07T05:27:00.000Z	finga	dtchen	i did
