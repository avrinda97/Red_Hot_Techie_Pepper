2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	Coily		should i use the debian sid installer or mozilla's for firefox 1.0.1?
2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	Coily		i mean, if mozilla's works fine why bother
2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	why not via apt-get ?
2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	apparantly i dont have the right repositories because i cant find it
2005-03-31T17:10:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	You are using synaptic?
2005-03-31T17:10:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	yup
2005-03-31T17:11:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	Settings -> Reposities -> Enable all the reposities and it should be ready to rock
2005-03-31T17:12:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	all repositories are enabled =[
2005-03-31T17:12:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	and ive added everything from ubuntuguide.org
2005-03-31T17:12:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	You are using Hoary?
2005-03-31T17:12:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	ah no sorry warty
2005-03-31T17:14:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	sorry, dunno if it is in warty, BUT I cannot believe it is not. If it is not just go to the Ubuntu or Debian website and download the deb files. it can save you a lot of headache!
2005-03-31T17:14:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	alright ill check it out. do you have the name of the firefox installer? i can google it
2005-03-31T17:15:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	well i have the link if you give me one sec.
2005-03-31T17:15:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	thanks
2005-03-31T17:17:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	Again: you should be abled to find this yourself, bbut download what you think that you will need from this page: http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=firefox&searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all
2005-03-31T17:18:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	ya i found that before. i guess theres no ubuntu package?
2005-03-31T17:18:00.000Z	Coily		actually im positive theres a backports firefox 1.0.1 package for warty
2005-03-31T17:18:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	explain me the difference between a Debian and a Ubuntu package...
2005-03-31T17:18:00.000Z	Coily		there was a thread about it
2005-03-31T17:18:00.000Z	Coily	phanter	 please do :x
2005-03-31T17:19:00.000Z	Coily		ok thanks for the help. i wasnt sure if there was a difference
2005-03-31T17:19:00.000Z	phanter	Coily	there is none. Both are .deb files. Sometimes Debian is not as updates as other distro's but do not worry... everything you download from Debian is stable and secure (that is for shure !!!!)
