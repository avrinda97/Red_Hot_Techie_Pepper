2009-09-19T19:31:00.000Z	Sirmimer		Hi i need help with webcam and aMSN, can anyone help?
2009-09-19T19:31:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	go ahead
2009-09-19T19:33:00.000Z	Sirmimer	^mNotIntelligent	Im just testing this aMSN (just downloaded it), and im testing the webcam feature. At the wizzard guide the webcam works, but when its used in a conversation, it comes up with a white screen
2009-09-19T19:34:00.000Z	Sirmimer	^mNotIntelligent	Do you know why?
2009-09-19T19:35:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	no idea on that...trying to google out...
2009-09-19T19:35:00.000Z	Sirmimer	^mNotIntelligent	I did, and it says something about installing SVN?
2009-09-19T19:36:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	I guess you're not talking aobut versioning system SVN...whats taht?
2009-09-19T19:37:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	thats irrelevant ...what did google say?
2009-09-19T19:37:00.000Z	Sirmimer	^mNotIntelligent	Some guy on a post told a user to install SVN - http://amsn-project.net/wiki/SVN - but he was a mac user so dunno if i should to?
2009-09-19T19:38:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	SVN is just a versioning system...right? it has nothing to do with your case unless you're trying to get the source of that or do somehting like that...lemme check that link..wait a min
2009-09-19T19:39:00.000Z	Sirmimer	^mNotIntelligent	I dont know, it just said that in a topic on aMSN
2009-09-19T19:39:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	checking the link...
2009-09-19T19:40:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	got it....as i mentioned earlier it said install SVN and using taht check-out the current/bleeding edge source code and build it there in...
2009-09-19T19:41:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	so if you want it build it from source code ,you have to have SVN and then get the source code and buidl it
2009-09-19T19:41:00.000Z	Sirmimer	^mNotIntelligent	I just want to fix the white screen :S
2009-09-19T19:42:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	if you know how to build things from source code, then I must say go get the current src using SVN, but if you have no prior exposure or running short of time, dont do that
2009-09-19T19:43:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	if you've plenty of time...try it out...would be a nice learning exp and help you out in future...
2009-09-19T19:44:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	in that case try to get it done using some other wya....but if you can't make it work..thats the last option...to build things from source...
2009-09-19T19:45:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	thta apart, there must be some way to fix that without doing all this....without compiling the source
2009-09-19T19:45:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	not at alll, once you've the clue :-)
2009-09-19T19:47:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	but I must say when you've time learn installing things from source code...b'coz if you want to use *nix quite often you'll have to learn it anywya....theres no way to escape....so i suggest learn it sometime...
2009-09-19T19:48:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	Sirmimer	unix/linux ...yeh i know...
2009-09-19T19:55:00.000Z	Sirmimer	^mNotIntelligent	Would it be possible to run windows live messanger instead of aMSN, using whine?
