2006-10-06T12:53:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	oh...
2006-10-06T12:45:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	dpkg -l
2006-10-06T12:46:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	I tried dpkg -l * which to me was the only thing to try. Thx. :-)
2006-10-06T12:47:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	if you kinda know what package it is, use dpkg -l|grep $foo where foo is a search term.
2006-10-06T12:48:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	what's the error?
2006-10-06T12:49:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	Xorg.0.log is very short, ending with "Backtrace:" and nothing more
2006-10-06T12:49:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	hmmm... and no amount of updating will fix it?
2006-10-06T12:51:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	'apt-get -r install' ends with "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"
2006-10-06T12:53:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	what's -r? i don't see it in --help or the manpage.
2006-10-06T12:53:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	reinstall i assume? maybe -r is invalid?
2006-10-06T12:53:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	that was a suggestion by apt-get on a previous failure
2006-10-06T12:54:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	sounds like it's borked beyond what i know. =(
2006-10-06T12:54:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	all this trouble begain with trying to 'apt-get install edubuntu-desktop' yesterday
2006-10-06T12:54:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	interrupted install?
2006-10-06T12:55:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	maybe aptitude has some ideas on how to clean up the packages.
2006-10-06T12:55:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	interrupted by packging errors
2006-10-06T12:55:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	lots of packaging error messages yesterday
2006-10-06T12:56:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	try aptitude. at the very least, it might try to remove all the broken/unused packages.
2006-10-06T12:57:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	aptitude reinstall ends the same way as apt-get -r install
2006-10-06T12:58:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	sounds like the backend itself is busted. i can't help you there. sorry. =(
2006-10-06T12:58:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	back end busted what it sounds like to me too, but dpkg-reconfigure dpkg doesn't help either
2006-10-06T12:59:00.000Z	MrMazda	Terminus	I would try edgy, but have no DVD. does edgy have a boot.iso for network install?
2006-10-06T13:00:00.000Z	Terminus	MrMazda	no idea. i installed ubuntu from a breezy cd and just dist-upgraded from there. =)
