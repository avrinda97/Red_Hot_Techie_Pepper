2011-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	sab0tage		try grub-restore
2011-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	votz	sab0tage	from the grub shell upon boot? or from the live-cd"?
2011-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	votz		I assume the latter
2011-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	votz		also if it matters, the old grub was originally installed by fedora 13
2011-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	sab0tage		from the live cd.  did you use the correct parititon when installing grub "ie. grub-install /dev/<device>
2011-07-26T08:50:00.000Z	votz	sab0tage	I believe so if for no other reason than it used to boot windows, and now boots into grub shell
2011-07-26T08:51:00.000Z	sab0tage	maum	Add "options snd-hda-intel model=auto" to /etc/modprobe.d/50-sound.conf
2011-07-26T08:51:00.000Z	sab0tage		2. Install pulse audio. Strangely this was not installed and conflicted with patterns-openSUSE-kde4_pure which I had to remove.
2011-07-26T08:51:00.000Z	sab0tage		I got that from here:  http://forums.opensuse.org/english/other-forums/development/open-build-service-obs/450686-no-sound-intel-corporation-5-series-3400-series-chipset-high-definition-audio.html  seems to fix a lot of intel chipsets
2011-07-26T08:52:00.000Z	votz	sab0tage	also, does grub-restore care about grub2 vs grub legacy?
2011-07-26T08:52:00.000Z	votz		to tell you the truth, Im not sure which is in use. both grub.conf and menu.lst exist and have the same contents
2011-07-26T08:52:00.000Z	sab0tage		umm, can't say for sure,  I don't think so, but you might want to research
2011-07-26T08:52:00.000Z	sab0tage	maum	you need to go to that link or just put that line in that conf file
2011-07-26T08:53:00.000Z	sab0tage		there are similar lines already in that file, you might just have to change the last part to auto, or if it's not there, add it

2011-07-26T08:54:00.000Z	sab0tage		last entry is your solution, not tough at all.
2011-07-26T08:55:00.000Z	sab0tage		anyone here got selenium working in firefox 4?
2011-07-26T08:56:00.000Z	sab0tage		no, just disable ipv6, unless you don't use it, but I wouldn't uninstall
2011-07-26T08:56:00.000Z	sab0tage		dhcp3-server probably has it's own option for disabling in dhcp.conf
2011-07-26T08:57:00.000Z	sab0tage		type "options snd-hda-intel model=auto" into file /etc/modprobe.d/50-sound.conf, how hard is that.  If you don't understand, go use windows again.
2011-07-26T08:59:00.000Z	votz	sab0tage	there is no command 'grub-restore'
2011-07-26T08:59:00.000Z	sab0tage		did you try restore-grub
2011-07-26T09:00:00.000Z	votz	sab0tage	 nothing for 'restore-grub', either
