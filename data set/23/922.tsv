2011-01-05T20:16:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	yes
2011-01-05T20:17:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	if you mean that your excludes are not working?
2011-01-05T20:18:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	other problem is, that i got permission denied if i execute rsync as root (to a mounted nfs-folder)
2011-01-05T20:18:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	you mounted nfs with wrong parameters
2011-01-05T20:18:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	which have i to use?
2011-01-05T20:19:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	i use this: sudo mount -t nfs contio-desktop:/BACKUP /mnt/BACKUP/
2011-01-05T20:20:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	no_root_squash is the option
2011-01-05T20:21:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	you mean in the export-file on the nfs-server ?
2011-01-05T20:21:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	yes
2011-01-05T20:22:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	i have use anonuid=1000, and worked before.
2011-01-05T20:23:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	root is not allowed by default, so you need to add option to allow it
2011-01-05T20:27:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	now i got this... but the other files seems to be rsyncedhttp://pastebin.com/t3aRcmi6
2011-01-05T20:28:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	you have opened your gpg with root maybe
2011-01-05T20:29:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	just chown it back to your user
2011-01-05T20:29:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	don't know. i only installed ubuntu-desktop n my kubuntu-desktop-system, and have this errors now. before in kubuntu the script works well
2011-01-05T20:29:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	well..you might have installed gpg-keys with sudo and it caused that
2011-01-05T20:30:00.000Z	gobbe	rethus	just chown them back to your user with sudo and you are ok
2011-01-05T20:33:00.000Z	rethus	gobbe	wait, whats that: strange view...
