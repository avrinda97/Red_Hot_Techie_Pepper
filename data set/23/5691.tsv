2006-10-18T06:06:00.000Z	cef		ever since switching back to the nv driver, my system is quite laggy in video performance.. any suggestions on what to check? also how do I stop the nvidia kernel module loading automatically at boot (without removing restricted modules that is)?
2006-10-18T06:07:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	Try uninstalling the nvidia binary blob.
2006-10-18T06:07:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	you mean nvidia-glx? gone already
2006-10-18T06:08:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	You may then remove/rename the kernel module, it doesn't hurt to do it.
2006-10-18T06:09:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	yeah I guess..
2006-10-18T06:17:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	The vn driver doesn't support 3D Acceleration.
2006-10-18T06:18:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	who's talking about 3d.. this is plain 2d stuff and it's dog-slow
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	That's pretty much all it can do, from what I perceived.
2006-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	lag of up to 2 seconds after a mouse click on a scroll bar before the screen updates
2006-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	That's much slower than it should be, what web pages were you browsing ?
2006-10-18T06:21:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	pretty much anything.
2006-10-18T06:21:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	The performance would drop drastically if the pages contain Flash or heavy gif/jpeg files.
2006-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	from theregister to news sites to anything. it's not restricted to web browsing.. affects kmail, evolution, even xchat
2006-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	Did it work fine when you first install Ubuntu ?
2006-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	I don't remember.. that was back in the days of Hoary
2006-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	and I seem to remember the first thing I did was install the nvidia binary driver
2006-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	I'm afraid I can not help if it has anything to do with compatibility, if the nvidia 3D driver package (from their site) is not causing you problem (it does to me though - unstable for some people), try using it.
2006-10-18T06:24:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	see the topic as to why I uninstalled it.
2006-10-18T06:24:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	The nv driver should not causing troubles even in 1280x1024x32, as far as I know.
2006-10-18T06:25:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	1440x900x32 at the moment, so yeah
2006-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	Sorry for not be able to help you any further. If reducing the resolution/bitrate works, perhaps that's your video adapter could not handle screen resolution that big.
2006-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	cef	vanhtu1987	well it's the same size as before.. and since it's an LCD, going lower is not an option
2006-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	vanhtu1987	cef	High resolution for a 3D driver is not an issue (as you said you first installed nvidia-glx back then), but it should'nt be a surprise when using the default nv driver.
