2005-12-19T07:42:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		working in a terminal... I get used to have .c files that were colored back.. since installation of the backup data they're now green - the color of .exe... how can I change them to black ?
2005-12-19T07:43:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	tak a look at them with ls -l ; if the execute bit is set (an x in permissions) chmod -x *.c will fix it
2005-12-19T07:58:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	how do I get rid of the same color for text files?
2005-12-19T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	nm, vic secret
2005-12-19T08:03:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	the chmod command works for any file; that execute bit it mentioned earlier can be on any file. Just -x the files you want.
2005-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	also, linux looks at the file directly to figure out what it is, it does not use the extensions to figure it out
2005-12-20T14:52:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	you could try aptitude search ^gstreamer , and install anything not installed
2005-12-22T07:55:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	it does, it's available in /boot
2007-06-15T05:31:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	aptitude search ~dhex~deditor shows a bunch; the only one I've used is ghex & it was ok
2007-06-15T05:33:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	this is the dirty stuff.. :)
2007-06-15T05:53:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	KHexEdit - much better
2008-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	you would edit the menu launcher item, add --geometry=80x50  for example (50 lines, 80 chars)
2008-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	I initially did that.. to no avail
2008-02-19T12:00:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	using the menu after you did that didn't work? then you have something wrong in your editing
2008-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	got it... thanks.. I figured out that through the Applications > Accessories > Terminal, it would work, but I was launching form the panel, so I just replaced the current launcher in the panel with the new one. works. Cheers :)
2008-07-16T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	they're in your .bashrc , but commented out. Easy fix
2008-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	true, and I'm very familiar bash, but why are they commented by default, then?
2008-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	not sure. I have a .bash_aliases file, so I don't uncomment them. You could file a wish list bug I guess
2008-07-16T09:29:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	someone not really familiar with the aliasing system might not be aware of this...
2008-07-16T09:30:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	I'm not sure it's so important that I do so, pure curiosity is all... I wasn't sure if the developers had chosen it to be commented for some other reason that the other flavors of linux didn't(or did) account for
2009-04-02T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	  php5-gd I think
2009-04-02T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	CaptainMorgan	aptitude search php5- will be illuminating
2009-04-02T09:59:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nickrud	nice! that's it.. .I wouldn't never have known- thanks!
