2008-05-17T11:47:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	then minimal install is what you want
2008-05-17T11:50:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	you can read up on it; this strictly a support channel
2008-05-17T14:51:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	there should be file like flux.conf that you can edit
2008-05-17T14:51:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	you still online? :D I don't know how to access any files because of afforementioned dillemna, though.
2008-05-17T14:52:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	if it helps, my mouse seems to have two shadows.... o.O in fluxbox, I mean.
2008-05-17T14:53:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	or ANYONE, why aren't my TTY's working?
2008-05-17T14:59:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	while I still want to know why my tty's aren't working (that link didn't seem to answer that question), I am curious- is it possible to start a session with a window manager without using a display manager (as all display managers seem to have gui logins?)
2008-05-17T15:00:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	have not read the fluxbox documentation enough myself (linked on that page) to answer that
2008-05-17T15:00:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	so my second question is fluxbox dependent, not just a general linux question?
2008-05-17T15:01:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	seems like you would enjoy screen :)
2008-05-17T15:23:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	I'm typing up a forum post that's fairly in depth... but I still don't understand how/why my tty's aren't working. Is that also fluxbox related? I thought tty's went a level deeper than the window managers...
2008-05-17T15:47:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	one that is not supported here yes
2008-12-18T07:33:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	use ntfs
2008-12-18T07:34:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	I'm not hugely familiar with the carious kinds of formatting... what are the pros/cons of nfts vs fat32?
2008-12-18T07:34:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	file limit size for the latter
2008-12-18T07:34:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	I have only a 1gig stick.
2008-12-18T07:34:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	this is a usb stick? thought it was a shared hdd
2008-12-18T07:35:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	no, it's a usbstick I'm trying to make into a DSL liveboot.
2008-12-18T07:35:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	a bootable pen drive with puppy linux?
2008-12-18T07:41:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	dsl has a channel; why are you asking in #ubuntu
2008-12-18T07:42:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	I guess this is the only support channel I've ever used, as I use ubuntu solely. I'm installing it using ubuntu, also, but I can see merit in trying theirs as well...
2008-12-18T07:43:00.000Z	bazhang	kajo	how does this relate to ubuntu
2008-12-18T07:43:00.000Z	kajo	bazhang	this is also not related to DSL itself, these are basic linux questions from an ubuntu perspective. The fact that it is DSL is almost irrelevant... it could be any liveboot.
