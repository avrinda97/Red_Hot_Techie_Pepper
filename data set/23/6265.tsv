2006-06-20T08:23:00.000Z	freakabcd		or is it TwinView
2006-06-20T08:23:00.000Z	freakabcd		don't remember exactly. but thats the only difference between regular xinerama and nvidia xinerama
2006-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	freakabcd		;)
2006-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	what do you mean?
2006-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	huh?
2006-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	intel cards can handle multiple displays?
2006-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	err.. yeah the laptop ones can for a few years already~~
2006-06-20T08:25:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	I have a laptop with an intel card
2006-06-20T08:25:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	how would I go about using it should I so desire
2006-06-20T08:25:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	what card
2006-06-20T08:25:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	there shouldn't be any problems for you for having xinerama
2006-06-20T08:25:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	so, what happens when I plug a monitor into the hack in the back?
2006-06-20T08:26:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	i can paste my current xorg.conf if you desire to see it (and amend it to your configuration)
2006-06-20T08:26:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	if you just plug in the external monitor, chances are nothing will happen :( cos you need to setup xorg.conf for the xinerama support
2006-06-20T08:26:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	I don't suppose I could use Guidance to configre it?
2006-06-20T08:27:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	the nifty xorg configurator in kubuntu's system settings
2006-06-20T08:30:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16041
2006-06-20T08:31:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	few things to notice: only additions to the already present xorg.conf will be: 1 extra device section (identical to existing one), 1 extra monitor section, 1 extra screen section(can be identical.. but not always is), and additional line in Serverlayout
2006-06-20T08:31:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	yeah
2006-06-20T08:33:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	care to try it out now? man i even have aiglx+compiz working on this laptop and its funky
2006-06-20T08:34:00.000Z	RadiantFire	freakabcd	i don't have a mnitor lying around to test it on...
2006-06-20T08:35:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	anyway. you've got the idea and a sample file now. i'm very happy with xinerama though, gives me more real estate
2006-06-20T09:46:00.000Z	freakabcd	RadiantFire	it _is_ :)
