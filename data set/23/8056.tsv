2005-03-17T06:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	why not install Ubuntu ?
2005-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	i have my debian system *way* too customized
2005-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	cusom kernels qnd whatnot ?
2005-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	migrating would simply take too much time, which i don't have
2005-03-17T06:15:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	that too :)
2005-03-17T06:16:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	but i do recommend ubuntu to my friends
2005-03-17T06:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	changing distros is a pain but It was worth it for me to switch to Ubuntu, man it's awesome
2005-03-17T06:17:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	what benefits will i get, exactly?
2005-03-17T06:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	well there are regular release cycles for 1, the irc channel is full of cool people and the developers are very nice to offer help when they have time
2005-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	there is also 18 months support for a release which will co-incide with the gnome release schedule afaik ;)
2005-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	i run sid, which has updates whenever i want it, and #debian has the coolest bot ever, dpkg :)
2005-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	and i don't run gnome :)
2005-03-17T06:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	the only thing I miss about the Debian irc channel is the bot, doesn't say much for the other people there :D
2005-03-17T06:20:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	i think i only talk to the bot
2005-03-17T06:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	IMHO there are some real lamers in that channel
2005-03-17T06:20:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	it tells me all i need to know, and people to have to answer the same question a million times
2005-03-17T06:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	I wish they would install it here
2005-03-17T06:21:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	i still don't think lamers in #debian is a reason i should switch to ubuntu
2005-03-17T06:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	no but it's another fringe benefit :P
2005-03-17T06:21:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	and if i get a new computer (i plan to), i will install debian on it anyway
2005-03-17T06:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jcurry	if your happy with Debian that's cool I ran it for 3 years
2005-03-17T06:22:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	imho, ubuntu only has user-friendlyness over debian, and i am a power user...i can manage
2005-03-17T06:22:00.000Z	jcurry	LinuxJones	but i do recommend it to beginners, for that same userfriendlyness
