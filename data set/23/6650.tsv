2006-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	have you tried #kubuntu or searched the forum yet?
2006-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	yeah.... I did... doesn't look like very many people know
2006-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	but thanks for the suggestion
2006-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	do you see anything regarding ntpdate before it shuts off?
2006-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	um... i'm not sure... is there a way i can disable the ntupdate?
2006-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	nvm, it's probably not it then.
2006-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	so this is a kubuntu install?  or ubuntu with kde?
2006-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	it's kubuntu...
2006-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	maybe i should d/l ubuntu and then put kde on there????
2006-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	but still... i shouldn't have to do that...
2006-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	i agree.  what about the mailing list?
2006-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	yeah, i could post it there... maybe that would be the best thing
2006-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	i know it works though... i've had dapper (ubuntu) on there before... it ran beautifully
2006-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	ironic.  i thought dapper would be the least stable :-/
2006-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	I know.... me too!
2006-02-24T07:02:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	i'm burning ubuntu dapper now... we'll see how it goes... i'm going to install it after it burns...
2006-02-24T08:17:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	it finally worked dude!
2006-02-24T08:18:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	what did?  do i know you? :)
2006-02-24T08:18:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	come on dude... don't recognize me with my fancy new OS that I couldn't get on a little while ago?
2006-02-24T08:18:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	Finally, got dapper on... Kubuntu style...
2006-02-24T08:19:00.000Z	brenner	GoDawgs	ohhhhh
2006-02-24T08:19:00.000Z	GoDawgs	brenner	hehehehe
