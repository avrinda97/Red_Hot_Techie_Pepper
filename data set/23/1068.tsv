2010-09-19T16:46:00.000Z	actionParsnip	AbhiJit	no ext4 is not accessible yet, keep an ear on www.fs-driver.org
2010-09-19T16:47:00.000Z	actionParsnip	AbhiJit	also hassle microsoft, the definition is open and available so not hard to make, funny how their proprietary and close NTFS is readable and writable by Linux but Microsoft OSes can't write or even read ext4
2010-09-19T16:48:00.000Z	AbhiJit	actionParsnip	not that
2010-09-19T16:48:00.000Z	AbhiJit	actionParsnip	if i install previous version of kernel. then boot into taht kernel then remove the current latest kernel and then upgrade ubuntu. will it solve my sound problem?
2010-09-19T16:49:00.000Z	actionParsnip	AbhiJit	if you can find debs for the older kernel, sure why not. I'd tread VERY carefully though

2010-09-19T17:23:00.000Z	actionParsnip	AbhiJit	ubuntu-tweak is not an official canonical app (its not in the repos) so any action it takes is unsuportable. If you remove them using synaptic then it is fine. Why you are using ubuntu-tweak for that aqction is beyond my cmoprehension
2010-09-19T17:23:00.000Z	AbhiJit	actionParsnip	:'(
