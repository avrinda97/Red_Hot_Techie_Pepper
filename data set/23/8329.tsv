2005-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	ideafix		is it true that ubuntu dont have a firewall instaled out of the box ?
2005-02-09T13:23:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	it's half true, iptables is installed by default but not configured to act as a firewall... On another hand, by default hoary has no listening port, so no need for a firewall
2005-02-09T13:24:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	who care if you walk outside on the streets? Ubuntu has no listening port, if there were a firewall, which port should it monitor? :s
2005-02-09T13:27:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	there's no weakness in opening a port to receive a webpage.
2005-02-09T13:28:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	if you ask google for its index page, what would a bad package be like?
2005-02-09T13:31:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	firewall filters packets regarding the src, destination, dest port, source port and protocole... it doesn't care about the "content" of the package.
2005-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	all firewalls can do that by ignoring ping request and incoming connections instead of accepting/refusing it
2005-02-09T13:36:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	I don't want ubuntu to act this way by default
2005-02-09T13:37:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	who cares if 'peeps' can notice you? most of computer setup allow you to discover them
2005-02-09T13:38:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	Then turn on your firewall
2005-02-09T13:40:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	what's your point here? What do you want?
2005-02-09T13:44:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	I just got your ip address, found out that you were from portual, should should disconnect immediately as your privacy is about to be broken!!
2005-02-09T13:45:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	Oh shit, I don't neither
2005-02-09T13:46:00.000Z	spiritz	ideafix	Will I get busted and executed for being in a linux channel and talking  with you? I understand the need for a firewall
