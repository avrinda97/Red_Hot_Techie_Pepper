2010-12-30T09:55:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	yes it is me
2010-12-30T09:56:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	any clue how to reinstall a kernel to get a working system again?
2010-12-30T09:56:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	yes i have an idea
2010-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	i really dont want to reinstall the whole system and lose everything that ive done in there already
2010-12-30T09:57:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	what you need to do is to hold shift when you restart your machine, then if you have any kernels startup in anyone of them and then reload up the kernel that you accidently deleted... then reboot and load into the new kernel
2010-12-30T09:58:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	however if you have no images when you restart and hold shift... im sorry to say it but you'll have to prolly do a fresh install
2010-12-30T09:59:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	when grub comes up, i have burg ontop of it, i click the kernel thats listed and it does nothing at all
2010-12-30T09:59:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	so essentially i cant boot anything but windoes
2010-12-30T09:59:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	aww not good
2010-12-30T09:59:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	no sir
2010-12-30T09:59:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	let me check a few more things before i tell ya the bad news
2010-12-30T10:03:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	from what i understand since you removed the image you have no way to get to linux or a linux terminal so you'll have to do a fresh install im so sorry man
2010-12-30T10:04:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	theres no way to install a kernel from the install disc?
2010-12-30T10:05:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	you could essentially try that, but not sure how that would work, you'd prolly have to boot into livecd and then install the kernel and add it to the grub.conf file
2010-12-30T10:05:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	not sure how to do that tho
2010-12-30T10:07:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	i know what you mean, i may be doin a reinstall myself to possibly fix gnome-power-manager, ..lol don't think itll make difference for me....
2010-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	any clue where i can look for some information on this?
2010-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	screw it, im just gonna wipe it and reinstall
2010-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	dammit.
2010-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	i hate reinstalling
2010-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	needlez	glitfchd	sorry man
2010-12-30T10:14:00.000Z	glitfchd	needlez	not your fault but thx
