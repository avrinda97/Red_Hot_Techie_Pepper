2012-05-18T04:26:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	thanks, how can I find out whether that module is laoded or not?
2012-05-18T04:28:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	if you perform " sudo modprobe -r acer-wmi " and you have sound, then use the blacklist
2012-05-18T04:30:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	what do you mean by "if you have sound"?
2012-05-18T04:30:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	it should work instantly
2012-05-18T04:32:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	 err wlan should work instantly, my bad
2012-05-18T04:34:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	the Acer models they are talking about I think are bigger models
2012-10-10T03:21:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	rename = mv
2012-10-10T03:41:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	'deactivate' your keyring with an empty password.
2012-10-10T03:42:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	but if the password's empty, doesn't mean it'll stop asking for it, right?
2012-10-10T03:43:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	yes, and you still can store simple passwords for services.
2012-10-10T03:44:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	...which I can't with the edited lightdm?
2012-10-10T03:45:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	Yes to what exactly?
2012-10-10T03:45:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	asking too many questions afer another, yes ->  it'll stop asking for it
2012-10-10T03:46:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	I already removed those lines from lightdm, was that wrong? should I undo it?
2012-10-10T03:48:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	only if you want to revert the changes
2012-10-10T03:50:00.000Z	bennypr0fane	OerHeks	I removed these 2 lines from lightdm in order to get rid of the keyring:    auth optional pam_gnome_keyring.so
2012-10-10T03:51:00.000Z	OerHeks	bennypr0fane	not sure what howto suggests that, i wouldn't do it like that.
