2008-03-04T21:50:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	line 65: should be `nvidia`, not `nv`.  But,  how did you install the restricted drivers?
2008-03-04T21:50:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	from the restricted drivers window
2008-03-04T21:51:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	and glxinfo is giving these lines Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2008-03-04T21:53:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	try from command-line `sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new`
2008-03-04T21:54:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	i have nvidia geforce 4 will the new work?
2008-03-04T21:55:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	no, but maybe `sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx` will work?
2008-03-04T21:55:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	i already have that package
2008-03-04T21:56:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	can you try, line 65: `nvidia`, not `nv`.  No promises though
2008-03-04T21:57:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	yes did it but WoW wont work anyways so now i will download the nvidia-glx-package again

2008-03-04T21:58:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	i shouldnt try envy, right?
2008-03-04T21:58:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	haven't tried envy myself, so no advice on that
2008-03-04T21:59:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	cause yday some guys told me that it will ruin my system so today i had a fresh install
2008-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	hmm. I think i remember reading that.  *thinking*
2008-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	im trying the 'new' nvidia
2008-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	zackyramon1	zossso	Jack_Sparrow and IndyGunFreak were helping me
2008-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	let me know how it goes.  don't think there is support for geforce4 though
2008-03-04T22:01:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	I mean in the nvidia-glx-new
2008-03-04T22:02:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	hischild: won't think then. look here- http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=35213679&sid=1
2008-03-04T22:06:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	best option might be to look into a newer videocard
2008-03-04T22:09:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	if you don't get anywhere, best option is probably looking into a newer videocard
2008-03-04T22:10:00.000Z	zossso	zackyramon1	yeah. don't want to break your system though.
