2005-02-05T16:00:00.000Z	nir		anyone here run ubuntu on mac?
2005-02-05T16:00:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	yup, ibook G4
2005-02-05T16:02:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	i had that when i messed up /etc/yaboot.conf but for mac os x
2005-02-05T16:02:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	it suggests that it is trying to boot off the wrong partion
2005-02-05T16:03:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	and when it can't find ubuntu returns to the selection screen
2005-02-05T16:05:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	i have ide but mine says device=/pci@f4000000/ata-6@d/disk@0:
2005-02-05T16:05:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	so expect strange things
2005-02-05T16:09:00.000Z	nir	jcoxon77	on what hardware you run ubuntu?
2005-02-05T16:09:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	i have and iBook G4 800mhz
2005-02-05T16:14:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	well if you can chroot into you drive (perhaps even through mac os x) then you can run yabootconf which will automagically make a correct config file, tho you'll need to add mac os x and cd boot which are easy...
2005-02-05T16:14:00.000Z	nir	jcoxon77	I don't need mac os x boot or cd at all
2005-02-05T16:15:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	how do you alternate?
2005-02-05T16:16:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	well if you can access your drive then you can run yabootconf and it will install yaboot correctly
2005-02-05T16:18:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	yes once you've chrooted into the partition
2005-02-05T16:18:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	exactly, thanks knghtbrd :)
2005-02-05T16:19:00.000Z	jcoxon77	nir	when you chroot its as if you had booted from the hard drive and so when you run yabootconf it will set it up correctly
