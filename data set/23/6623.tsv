2006-03-30T16:23:00.000Z	Healot		Shared License isn;t GPL-like
2006-03-30T16:24:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	what's the difference? you have access to the source code and are free to change/redistriburte it
2006-03-30T16:25:00.000Z	Healot	Afief	read more of MSL
2006-03-30T16:27:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	it's very long, could you give me a hint?
2006-03-30T16:30:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	huh? "commercial purpose" i doubt that porting and distributing for free is counted as commercial
2006-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	hey, it's a good step for microsoft to open it at all. and who cares if you can do ANYTHING with it as long as we can port/play it on *nix systems?
2006-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	Healot	Afief	MS will never do a OSS license
2006-03-30T16:34:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	I don't see the point... as long as we can use it according to the linux philosophies(download source/binaries for free, alter code as you want) it should be great
2006-03-30T16:37:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	i'm not argueing that it IS an OSS license, but with some work around we could USE the code they offer us ALMOST like an OSS
2006-03-30T16:38:00.000Z	Healot	Afief	wait until MS launches a new MSL...
2006-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	huh? you mean they could CHANGE the license after they opened it up, thus rendering anyboyd trying to port it for free illeagal?:|
2006-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	Healot	Afief	not the released/licensed code though...
2006-03-30T16:40:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	drbreen: okay that makes sense for me... m$=Evil again. and i thought they were getting better:(
2006-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	okay then... any good OSS games out there? because i'm dying to play some games on my linux box
2006-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	new freeCiv? has it made it into the repositoreis yet?(breezy)
2006-03-30T16:45:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	the one i downloaded two weeks ago was really unintuitive to play... i couldn't find my way around the game....
2006-03-30T16:47:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	hmmm... UFOAI on sourceforge seems nice, anybody tried it?
2006-03-30T16:49:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	as i said... it's pretty much impossible to find original CDs here, not to mention Linux versions
2006-03-30T16:54:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	but that would upgrade to Dapper, which is unstable, i'm not looking for a whole dist upgrade, just the new stable programs:)
2006-03-30T16:55:00.000Z	Healot	Afief	just :upgrade:
2006-03-30T16:56:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	so... how safe is it? i love playing with sharp, cutting edge software, but i do need some of the stuff on the system
2006-09-07T07:19:00.000Z	Afief	Healot	i am not into racers, i prefer games like prince of persia and starcraft(i know starcraft runs under wine)
2006-09-07T07:20:00.000Z	Healot	Afief	you'll know what PPracer all about after you install it
