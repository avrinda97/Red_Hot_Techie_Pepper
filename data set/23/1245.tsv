2010-07-01T07:00:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx		I am surrounded by half crappy computer I built from parts people didn't want, and they are all running linux, but I half a few queries about the OS.
2010-07-01T07:02:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx		anyone wanna help me?
2010-07-01T07:02:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx		plz pm me.
2010-07-01T07:02:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	just ask your question(s)
2010-07-01T07:05:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	if you're displeased with the regular ubuntu, there are several options to still use ubuntu without using the regular (bloated) install
2010-07-01T07:06:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx	codebrainz	?
2010-07-01T07:07:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	you can install just the stuff you want using the alternate CD, or use something slimmer like xubuntu/xfce, the possibilities are endless
2010-07-01T07:08:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	there is very little in gnu/linux you can change, given the desire and time to do so
2010-07-01T07:09:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	pretty much everything is customizable and most of it simple (at least with ubuntu)
2010-07-01T07:12:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx	codebrainz	but the main problems for me are not its bloatedness, but the fact they taken out all the awesome stuff and replaced it with a load of crap., i mean, 'Glibber'?!? wtf!, 'pitivi' is one of the worst video editors I have seen in ubuntu, they took away 'GIMP'!!!, why the hell did that happen!, they took away over 1/3 of the awesomeness, and replaced it with a load of trivial crap!!! :-(

2010-07-01T07:13:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	so remove glibber and pitivi and replace with GIMP and avidemux?
2010-07-01T07:17:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx	codebrainz	1. 'avidemux' fail on ubuntu, it never works properly on ubuntu, it actually hindred the operating system a few ties causing it to crash. 2. 'GIMP', are you crazy!, I don't have the internet to download and installl that!, do you know how big the file is!?, and how many .deb packages it takes, I pay Â£15 per 3000mb of my crappy internet connection!, I'm poor dude!.
2010-07-01T07:18:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gimp
2010-07-01T07:18:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	otherwise, install from a CD
2010-07-01T07:21:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	it's even simple enough to "remix" you own ubuntu distro/CD so that when you install you get stuff the way you want instead of the way someone else assumes you want it
2010-07-01T07:23:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	people are gonna complain if you outright trash it like that here.  basically what the community wants and what the company pays for are two different things sometimes (not that often actually)
2010-07-01T07:28:00.000Z	xXEMO111Xx	codebrainz	what are you talking about?, I love ubuntu, I use no other., but 9.10 makes me wanna cry and piss blood., it kinda works, but like I said, they murderd it by taking the good and awesome stuff out, and just throwing anything in., it's not even nearly as bad as microsucks winblows, but it hasn't turned into a proud strong operating system like everyone expects when they are a part of the community, like me.
2010-07-01T07:29:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	it boils down to a matter of opinion, mine is often not in line with what the mainstream thinks
2010-07-01T07:30:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	you have the choice to type sudo apt-get install gimp (or install from a local cd/repo)
2010-07-01T07:31:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	i know you specifically meant not to, but you're gonna start a flame war
2010-07-01T07:32:00.000Z	codebrainz	xXEMO111Xx	i hear you totally, there are decisions made i don't agree with, but it's FOSS, no one can take away your choice
