2008-02-14T10:07:00.000Z	mark4	telexicon	im a heretic. im a software engineer who "hates" c.  i wrote a forth compiler for linux in 100% pure assembler lol
2008-02-14T09:55:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	apt-get install git-core
2008-02-14T09:55:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	git == gnu interactive tools
2008-02-14T09:56:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	git-core == Linus Torvald's distributed source control system
2008-02-14T09:56:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	I refer you to his google talk on why SVN is bad
2008-02-14T09:57:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 -- google tech talk
2008-02-14T09:58:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	heres another possibly less biased google tech talk on git: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3999952944619245780
2008-02-14T10:00:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	well i think git promotes some really cool workflows
2008-02-14T10:01:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	and it is Linus's opinion that centralized source control (like SVN) wouldnt be able to handle something as high traffic and distributed as the linux kernel
2008-02-14T10:02:00.000Z	mark4	telexicon	erm im not sure thats correct tho. i think svn can handle large projects like that
2008-02-14T10:02:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	for social reasons, not technical ones
2008-02-14T10:02:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	its not that SVN couldnt handle that throughput, its just a system which would require 1300 developers all the have access to the same codebase would be.. a crazy mess
2008-02-14T10:03:00.000Z	mark4	telexicon	well then they need to split the kernel into common code base, system specific code base and drivers
2008-02-14T10:04:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	well they found a better solution, distributed source control (which is what git does)
2008-02-14T10:04:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	and for xorg sources its git
2008-02-14T10:04:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	and for KDE sources its git
2008-02-14T10:06:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	oh.. i run gnome
2008-02-14T10:06:00.000Z	mark4	telexicon	for over 10 years ive run NOTHING but windowmaker. if they were still bothering to develop it I would probably not have switched
2008-02-14T10:06:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	ah.. so you are one of those non-changers huh
2008-02-14T10:09:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	python is my friend
2008-02-14T10:10:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	could you make us a nice open source flash implementation?
2008-02-14T10:10:00.000Z	mark4	telexicon	give me a spec for flash
2008-02-14T10:10:00.000Z	telexicon	mark4	eh.. well theres an issue with that
