2011-03-28T20:38:00.000Z	jamie4	shuttle	if you can install other things, I would go with installing aptitude, and use that instead of apt-get (I've had better luck that way, anyway, ymmv)

2011-03-28T20:43:00.000Z	jamie4	shuttle	I vote some kind of hardware, on first glance, anyway - check the hdd if it's smart, check for loose cables, etc etc. All that nonsense you never think to check, check it.
