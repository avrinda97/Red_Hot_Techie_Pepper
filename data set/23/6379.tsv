2006-06-22T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	That is not spyware
2006-06-22T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	Are you using a different laucher for Firefox?
2006-06-22T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	(it happened to me, but I forget the launcher I was using. Maybe GDesklets)
2006-06-22T05:59:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- what you mean with launcher?
2006-06-22T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	I think that I got that problem with GDesklets or something like that. The starter entry had the dodgy homepage in it
2006-06-22T06:00:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- yes, then i guess thats the deal, the starterbar..
2006-06-22T06:00:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- of course. it came after installing gdesklets
2006-06-22T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	Yes, I thiought it was. Remove the starter from the bar then drag Firefox out of the menu onto it
2006-06-22T06:01:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	(I forgot about that since I use Epiphany, but the package really should be fixed)
2006-06-22T06:04:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- i erased the starter, added a new one thats a copy from my gnomebar, still same problem. was this how you meant i should do?
2006-06-22T06:05:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	Yes. Hmm. Right click it and edit it, see what is in the "command" line
2006-06-22T06:08:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- thanks for your help. Now its fixed. That thing really should be fixed..
2006-06-22T06:08:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	I will submit a bug to launchpad
2006-06-22T06:10:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- Ok, where is that? Cause there are looots of bugs that should be fixed. In starterbar especially
2006-06-22T06:10:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- For example, when you have the "jumpyness" activated on the icons, then its very buggy. starts when im not clickin, icons moving around when hovering over etc.
2006-06-22T06:12:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- Anyhow, while your at it you could report that also, if your up to it. Now Im of to bed. Cu.
2006-06-24T06:01:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	Have a look in /etc/init.d
2006-06-24T06:13:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- Ok, I tried to open it in gedit as root, but gedit says it cant be opened.
2006-06-24T06:14:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	/etc/init.d is a directory. Look in it for a PCMCIA script (it is where bootup scripts are stored)
2006-06-24T06:15:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	You can enable/disable bootup services that you find in /etc/init.d with the "update-rc.d" command
2006-06-24T06:18:00.000Z	blackline	Warbo	- So if i do "update-rc.d pcmcia remove" it wont start anymore?
2006-06-24T06:20:00.000Z	Warbo	blackline	It's not quite as simple as that. It would be something like "sudo update-rc.d pcmcia 50 stop 1 . 50 stop 2 ." like that (as an example. Read the manual)
