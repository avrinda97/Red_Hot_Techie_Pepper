2006-06-09T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	it's true that running a native driver is always better
2006-06-09T05:50:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	what chipset does it have? Do you see it when you run lsusb?
2006-06-09T05:53:00.000Z	KarlsBerg	soundray	im confused read some comments but my final ids is diferent that other
2006-06-09T05:55:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	looks like it might be a ralink device.
2006-06-09T05:55:00.000Z	KarlsBerg	soundray	 i have rt2700 compiled and loaded but get no wireless extension
2006-06-09T05:56:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	are you sure that rt2700 is for USB devices?
2006-06-09T05:58:00.000Z	KarlsBerg	soundray	 yep
2006-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	are you on dapper?
2006-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	and it doesn't load a module spontaneously on connecting the device?
2006-06-09T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	is ndiswrapper an option for you?
2006-06-09T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	when you let it load the driver of its own choice, can you see the netdevice with ifconfig -a?
2006-06-09T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	KarlsBerg	that's not a wlan device though
2006-06-09T06:05:00.000Z	KarlsBerg	soundray	 yes, it is,m but ubuntu dont see correct
