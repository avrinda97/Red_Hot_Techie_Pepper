2007-01-19T13:46:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	which card
2007-01-19T13:46:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	or chipset, rather
2007-01-19T13:46:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	DWL-G122 Rev. B 1 rt2570
2007-01-19T13:46:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	chipset rt2570
2007-01-19T13:46:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	should work out of the box
2007-01-19T13:46:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	that is the rt25xx, no?
2007-01-19T13:47:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	yes
2007-01-19T13:47:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	and it doesnt work? are you running edgy or what?
2007-01-19T13:47:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	I run Dapper 6.06 and I connect with 96% to my AP
2007-01-19T13:47:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	so what's wrong
2007-01-19T13:48:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	But no datatransfe with WPA
2007-01-19T13:50:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	I followed HOWTO under ubuntu
2007-01-19T13:50:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	maybe you should try the serial monkey drivers? the ubuntu ones may be bad
2007-01-19T13:50:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	I am using  serial monkey drivers
2007-01-19T13:50:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	oh wow, so dapper didnt detect it out of the box?
2007-01-19T13:51:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	it did but the HOWTO under ubuntu said it doesn't work and freezes the system
2007-01-19T13:52:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	then maybe it is a wpasupplicant issue
2007-01-19T13:53:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	I don't even use wpasupplicant, since the driver should have with iwpriv
2007-01-19T13:57:00.000Z	Opermax	h3xis	I don't even use wpasupplicant, since the driver should have with iwpriv
2007-01-19T13:58:00.000Z	h3xis	Opermax	i dont know then :/ i've never used iwpriv
