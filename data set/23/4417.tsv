2007-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	xIke		how can I add stuff to my path?  my .profile is way more complicated than I'm used to
2007-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	export PATH=$PATH:new/path/here
2007-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	not sure you want that in the .profile however.
2007-09-20T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	exporting makes it avail to all child processes also.. so it depends on what you want.
2007-09-20T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	thats what export is all about.
2007-09-20T09:42:00.000Z	xIke	Dr_Willis	I thought you're supposed to add additional paths to .profile...  then any new shells will use that
2007-09-20T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	not sure when .profile is parsed. Normall y i use the .bashrc file for my paths.
2007-09-20T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	.bash_profile is read by bash login shells. , Not really sure when .profile is even read by anything. :)
2007-09-20T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	a read of .profile (the first 2 comments) clarify your problem.
2007-09-20T09:44:00.000Z	xIke	Dr_Willis	no it doesn't, I don't have those files
2007-09-20T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	interesting. if you dont have the .bash stuff put the export lines in the .profile then
2007-09-20T09:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	put in a 'echo this is .profile' - i sould guess that for some reason the new shells are Not reading the .profile. Perhaps only login shells read it.
2007-09-20T09:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	export should apply to al child/spawned shells from that shell.
2007-09-20T09:46:00.000Z	xIke	Dr_Willis	yeah, made a new shell, no echo
2007-09-20T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	try a 'xterm -ls' see if it loads it then.   I  never use .profile i always use .bashrc  what shell are you using anyway?
2007-09-20T09:50:00.000Z	xIke	Dr_Willis	yeah, that worked
2007-09-20T09:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	looks like .profile is only read by login shells.
2007-09-20T09:51:00.000Z	xIke	Dr_Willis	I didn't see anything about the path in .bashrc...sure that's the place to put it?
2007-09-20T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	    xterm -ls -> creates a login shell
2007-09-20T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	thats where i put mine. You could put it about anywhere. for sytem WIDE setting of the path do what bruenig mentioned.
2007-09-20T09:52:00.000Z	xIke	Dr_Willis	yeah, this is working...thanks man
2007-09-20T09:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xIke	i got my .bash and .bashrc all tweaked out. :)  fun!
2007-09-20T09:53:00.000Z	xIke	Dr_Willis	only downside of that...you're on someone else's system and it feels vastly superior :P
