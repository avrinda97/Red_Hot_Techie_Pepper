2007-04-08T15:19:00.000Z	thornomad		Hello everyone!  Does anyone know an easy way I can "shut off" my video output from the CLI ? (I have my server hooked up to a monitor that I share with another computer, however, when my other computer is off, the monitor stays on because it is getting a signal from the server ... so I want to shut that signal down but don't want to unplug it if I can help it.)
2007-04-08T15:20:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	sudo /etc/init.d/?dm stop
2007-04-08T15:20:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	thanks. and I assume I run a "start" when I want it back on again ?
2007-04-08T15:21:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2007-04-08T15:21:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	but if you are on kubuntu you may use kdm instead of gdm
2007-04-08T15:22:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	stopping is easier as starting :-)
2007-04-08T15:23:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	hmm ... i don't have either gdm or kdm ... the only *dm I have is mdadm
2007-04-08T15:23:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	no, no, no! this is the raid manager
2007-04-08T15:23:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	yea, that is what I thought.  I didn't stop that one. smile.  but no gdm or kdm
2007-04-08T15:24:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	it is the server edition ... i wonder if that is different ...
2007-04-08T15:24:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	what says "ls /etc/init.d | grep dm" ?

2007-04-08T15:26:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	what do you do to get X running?
2007-04-08T15:26:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	... um ... i don't think I am running X.  everything is command line.  headless
2007-04-08T15:27:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	it obviously does not start automatically
2007-04-08T15:27:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	otherwise i just turn on the computer.  monitor output works
2007-04-08T15:27:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	ok. i was under false impression that you are running x
2007-04-08T15:27:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	sorry. no ... just cli for me
2007-04-08T15:27:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	what do you want to acieve actually?
2007-04-08T15:28:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	i just want to turn off the output from my graphics card.  i have the server sitting next to my desk ... it is connected to a dual input monitor.  when that monitor "goes to sleep" it is woken up by the serrver and displays output.  i have to turn it off physically ... wanted to just shut off the video output since i rarely use it on the server.  then turn it on when needed
2007-04-08T15:30:00.000Z	velko	thornomad	hmm. the monitor of my server goes off automatically. i'm not able to help you with this one. i don't know why yours wakes up
2007-04-08T15:30:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	all right. thanks for trying. i appreciate it
2007-04-08T15:30:00.000Z	thornomad	velko	i will do some internet seraching perhaps thanks
