2005-04-20T13:06:00.000Z	pune		hey does anyone know how to ftp to another computer?
2005-04-20T13:06:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	ftp://user:pass@computername
2005-04-20T13:07:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	you need the "pass" in there?
2005-04-20T13:07:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	if it is anonymous access, then just ftp://computername
2005-04-20T13:10:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	it works fine for me, so probably there is something else wrong
2005-04-20T13:11:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	it needs an ftp server...
2005-04-20T13:12:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	if the other pc is yours too, install sshd on that machine and use sftp://computername to watch it
2005-04-20T13:12:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	ok, that program sets up an ftp server?
2005-04-20T13:21:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	ok, i've installed the ssh, but I can't connect to the other computer
2005-04-20T13:22:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	have you installed openssh-server on the other computer?
2005-04-20T13:22:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	wait do I need the computer name?
2005-04-20T13:22:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	or the user name
2005-04-20T13:22:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	sftp://username@computername
2005-04-20T13:23:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	or sftp://username@ip-adress
2005-04-20T13:23:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	is there a way to find out the computer name?
2005-04-20T13:23:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	just try its ip address
2005-04-20T13:23:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	ok sure thanks
2005-04-20T13:26:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	Sorry, how can I find out the ip address of that computer?
2005-04-20T13:28:00.000Z	Seveas	pune	on the other computer type: ifconfig
2005-04-20T13:29:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	thanks
2005-04-20T13:31:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	it's saying there's no such file or directory
2005-04-20T13:39:00.000Z	pune	Seveas	hey, it's saying there's no such file or directory, am I doing this right?
