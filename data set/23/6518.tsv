2008-07-27T16:26:00.000Z	tester		hi there, my usual log in is nerfed, i can't start any applications in it :(
2008-07-27T16:27:00.000Z	tester		i've created a new login, and that seems to work fine, anyone know how i can fix my normal login?
2008-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	tester		would really appreciate some help with why i can't start applications on my other user, feeling a bit desperate :(
2008-07-27T16:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tester	what application and what is the error
2008-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	any application and there's no error, they just don't start
2008-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tester	give me an example. Open a terminal and type 'gedit' and hit enter, what happens?
2008-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	not terminal, not firefox, not sessions, i can launch synaptic for some reason, and applications that auto-started are fine so long as i don't shut them down
2008-07-27T16:31:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	i'm on a different user login now and this one is fine - on my other login, i can't even open a terminal
2008-07-27T16:31:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	however, i have an embedded terminal screenlet that auto-starts, so i can tell you that if i type gedit into that, nothing happens, it just hangs
2008-07-27T16:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tester	this happened after you did something or just you were working and it stopped?
2008-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	i had just configured it to perfection, was happy with it, and decided to install cedega
2008-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	cedega for some reason also opened fine, i've tried uninstalling it now and that didn't make a difference
2008-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tester	are you on your other account right now?
2008-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	yes
2008-07-27T16:33:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	the broken account has xchat on auto-start, so i can come back on that account and still talk if you want to do tests
2008-07-27T16:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tester	sudo rm /home/yourbrokenaccount/.Xauthority
2008-07-27T16:34:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	there is no file .Xauthority
2008-07-27T16:34:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	or anything similar to that
2008-07-27T16:34:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tester	ah yes ... now that I think about it.
2008-07-27T16:36:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	http://pastebin.com/d5aacbf80
2008-07-27T16:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tester	the same, but with -la
2008-07-27T16:38:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	http://pastebin.com/d48cca08a
2008-07-27T16:49:00.000Z	tester	fyrestrtr	you there still?
