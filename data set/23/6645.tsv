2008-06-07T09:29:00.000Z	darth		people seriously!!!!.... i think i love my ubuntu
2008-06-07T09:29:00.000Z	darth		!!!!!
2008-06-07T09:30:00.000Z	darth		its almost as elegant as freebsd
2008-06-07T09:31:00.000Z	trask	darth	know that feeling, when i installed the 7.10 i was almost positive it was gonna last a month and i would swap back to slackware. Now its 4 months ago and ubuntu is my 2nd favorite seriously posing for leading posision
2008-06-07T09:35:00.000Z	darth		thnx technoviking
2008-06-07T09:36:00.000Z	darth	trask	i am a winxp as workstation and freebsd as anything-else guy
2008-06-07T09:37:00.000Z	darth		..... but ubuntu is a love-affair, everything is so goddamn smooth on this OS
2008-06-07T09:39:00.000Z	darth		the only thing i am missing in ubuntu is a decent handbook
2008-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	trask	darth	lol what is my biggest problem with it. its too smooth, i had to swap to fluxbox just to get it to be atleast a little challenging. Atleast on slackware you can spend your are forces to learn new stuff all the time.
2008-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	darth		...and a section callled "this is how you recompile your kernel (without breaking stuff)"
2008-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	trask		ok that needed a trimming that last msg
2008-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	darth	trask	lol i had to get used to that too
2008-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	darth		so i just imagine ubuntu as a better windows
2008-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	darth		a much better windows
2008-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	darth		"dont forget you dont need to su in a terminal"
2008-06-07T09:41:00.000Z	darth	trask	i would have installed freebsd and fluxbox on this laptop and spent countless hours getting things to work if i hadnt gone the ubuntu-way
2008-06-07T09:41:00.000Z	darth		it is awesome!
2008-06-07T09:41:00.000Z	darth		but very very UN-challenging
2008-06-07T09:42:00.000Z	darth		yes tommy_
2008-06-07T09:43:00.000Z	darth		i have a kernel-module loading question... where do i put that i want my computer to load a module on boot?
2008-06-07T09:44:00.000Z	darth		tommy: you could make a swap-file if you wanted to
2008-06-07T09:44:00.000Z	darth		i ran this 1GB laptop without swap for a week no problem
2008-06-07T09:45:00.000Z	trask	darth	i see windows as something very different. if your a heavy gamer thers little option. if your a lucky homeuser that doesnt game or have a weird homebanking ubuntu is currently what is recommendable.
