2006-03-26T08:27:00.000Z	babo		Help ... I'm trying to install skype again. Am I right in saying that skype doesn't work for ubuntu64 without the skype hijacker being installed ?
2006-03-26T08:28:00.000Z	babo		Has anyone installed skype ??
2006-03-26T08:28:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	yes
2006-03-26T08:28:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	did it work ?
2006-03-26T08:28:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	did you need the hijacker ? ... how did you do it ?
2006-03-26T08:29:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	automatix
2006-03-26T08:29:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	where did you find that ? ... btw I'm on 64 bit :-(
2006-03-26T08:30:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	: don't know if it will work correctly on a 64-bit, but you might wanna try
2006-03-26T08:30:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	to install do
2006-03-26T08:30:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	: wget http://beerorkid.com/automatix/automatix_5.6-2_i386.deb
2006-03-26T08:30:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	: then sudo dpkg -i automatix_5.6-2_i386.deb
2006-03-26T08:32:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	that's a i386 package :-(
2006-03-26T08:32:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	then try Easy Ubuntu
2006-03-26T08:32:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	what's easyubuntu ?

2006-03-26T08:48:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	: did you add them to your sources.list?
2006-03-26T08:49:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	It said it was doing that automatically ... sourcing 32 bit repositories isn't going to do me much good (methinks!).
2006-03-26T08:50:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	it sources them automatically ... it seems like they are not there ...
2006-03-26T08:54:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	no it's looking for 64 bit packages alright ... but 64bit breezy packages
2006-03-26T08:57:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	: maybe try this : http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-77069.html
2006-03-26T08:59:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	or even this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=77069&page=2#13
2006-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	FizDev	babo	if it works, tell me and I'll do a little script for future users
2006-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	babo	FizDev	cool, I think I'll try a chroot ... I don't want to force any packages if possible
