2005-11-26T11:55:00.000Z	Razor-X		or you can use ``cd ..'' twice
2005-11-26T11:56:00.000Z	Razor-X		Cygwin is annoying
2005-11-26T11:56:00.000Z	Razor-X		I'ld rather use coLinux
2005-11-26T11:57:00.000Z	Razor-X		errr
2005-11-26T11:57:00.000Z	Razor-X		``sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg''
2005-11-26T11:57:00.000Z	Razor-X		or.. that...
2005-11-26T11:57:00.000Z	Razor-X		oh :P

2005-11-26T11:58:00.000Z	Razor-X		it's my money source :P
2005-11-26T11:59:00.000Z	Mabus07	Razor-X	so do you have any suggestions for msn type clients for the terminal?
2005-11-26T11:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	older versions of centericq work with MSN
2005-11-26T11:59:00.000Z	Mabus07	Razor-X	and you can use that from the terminal ie: with no x
2005-11-26T12:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	unfortunately, they don't work with the current TOC AIM protocol, so you're either going to have to diff the patch in yourself, or not use AIM
2005-11-26T12:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	of course :P
2005-11-26T12:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	something older
2005-11-26T12:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	I don't know, the hoary version was old enough to have MSN support built-in
2005-11-26T12:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	I don't know about Breezy, you can try googling for the info though :P
2005-11-26T12:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	ohter than centericq, I don't know of much that connects to AIM unless you have a Jabber account and are using a Jabber server that comes with an MSN transport
2005-11-26T12:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	that also smoothes stuff like AIM compatibility, since they also tend to have AIM transports also
2005-11-26T12:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	cool
2005-11-26T12:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	then just head out and get an older version of centericq
2005-11-26T12:04:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mabus07	are you X-less, by the way?
