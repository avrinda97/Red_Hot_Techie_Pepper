2005-01-17T11:30:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	apt-get install vncserver or tightvncserver

2005-01-17T11:37:00.000Z	Konlied	pybe-lappy	I run vncserver from the same .bash_profile command I had with debian
2005-01-17T11:37:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	ahh
2005-01-17T11:39:00.000Z	Konlied	pybe-lappy	I don't see any reason for vncserver not to be working anymore, I really am unhappy with ubuntu now
2005-01-17T11:39:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	hey what can i say, i just apt-got it and typed vncserver and it asked me for a passwd and away it went
2005-01-17T11:40:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	i do have the extra repos and the back ports repos though, might be that....
2005-01-17T11:42:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	wheres the remote desktop in it?
2005-01-17T11:45:00.000Z	Konlied	pybe-lappy	remote desktop on ubuntu debian is under Computer > Desktop Prefs > Remote Desk
2005-01-17T11:46:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	thats not std vnc server
2005-01-17T11:46:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	thats so you can access your "current" desktop not as vncserver does a virtual one
2005-01-18T08:36:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	is it definatley there?
2005-01-18T08:38:00.000Z	Konlied	pybe-lappy	yep, I installed libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 as per the instructions at http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-10-20.3307060179/talkback/1099123912
2005-01-18T08:39:00.000Z	Konlied	pybe-lappy	the thing is I can run vncpaswd fine as root but I can't under any user account..
2005-01-18T08:40:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	Konlied	heh tried uninstall all the vncstuff and reinstalling it?
2005-01-18T08:44:00.000Z	Konlied	pybe-lappy	yes I've installed vnc from both supplied packages and the one on the vnc site
