2008-10-15T17:51:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	there is a dpgk-reconfigure command that configures java
2008-10-15T17:52:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	thanks that seems to be the missing hint :)
2008-10-15T17:53:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	question is, qhich package .. java-common its not :(
2008-10-15T17:54:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	sudo update-alternatives --config java
2008-10-15T17:54:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	ack, that was it .. to much fedora last months here :)
2008-10-15T18:01:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	let me look it up
2008-10-15T18:02:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/sun-java6-plugin .. only i386
2008-10-15T18:03:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	wait then
2008-10-15T18:05:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	there seems to be an executable provided by sun for 64bits. are your repos correct?
2008-10-15T18:06:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	have a look at the packages.ubuntu.com link above .. there is no sun java6 plugin package for amd64 ..
2008-10-15T18:07:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	it is even launchpad bug :) https://bugs.launchpad.net/sun-java/+bug/104512
2008-10-15T18:39:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	so it seems there is no amd64 firefox/mozilla plugin
2008-10-15T18:33:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	are you there?
2008-10-15T18:34:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	yes
2008-10-15T18:35:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp here is the 64 bit java
2008-10-15T18:36:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	it is not java for amd64 which is missing, it is the missing firefox plugin .. but thanx anyway!
2008-10-15T18:36:00.000Z	jim_p	phaidros	i thought it was in there. is it some other package?
2008-10-15T18:37:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	lemme try, their text besiddes the download suggests, that it is in tthis package ..
2008-10-15T18:40:00.000Z	phaidros	jim_p	just don't answer *any* question when not solved others already ;)
