2006-12-12T13:56:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	what a classic, have fun
2006-12-12T14:37:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	get rid of that sticker asap
2006-12-12T14:39:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	I  am a big fan of linux and ubuntu, but I am a bit disappointed with the fact that my new computer sucks with linux out of  box :(
2006-12-12T14:39:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	thats the whole fun of linux, getting everything to work
2006-12-12T14:41:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	as I told, I am an experienced user. I also have an HP nx7010 machine. And ubuntu recognizes every bit of hardware of it. it works perfect with ubuntu out of box. So I was illusionized with this thing that I though linux works good with most of the hardware esp. if they were new. Obviously I was wrong
2006-12-12T17:09:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	so like dont burn a DVD with in data format with a bunch of iso files on it
2006-12-12T17:04:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	of course a DVD is well over 2gb
2006-12-12T17:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	check out this
2006-12-12T17:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem
2006-12-12T17:06:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	there it says : WARNING: Files that are bigger than 2GB (a little less actually) are not supported by ISO9660 and may or may not be restorable. So don't simply burn a DVD with a huge .iso file on it.
2006-12-12T17:06:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	this why I am confused
2006-12-12T17:06:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	the ubuntu dvd iso is well over 2gig
2006-12-12T17:07:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	yes but why that wiki says the otherwise ?
2006-12-12T17:08:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	that means if its not been burnt as ISO format
2006-12-12T17:10:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	I am using growisfos -J -R -Z /dev/hdc /path/to/my/archive. the file size is 2.5 GB. Am I in any danger ?
2006-12-12T17:11:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	i've never used growisfos, I can't guarantee you anything.. sounds like a risky operation :)
2006-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	this a server and I need to handle the backup thingy from console. I am burning my backups to DVD which is a reasonable thing I believe. Do I have any other options rather than growisofs?
2006-12-12T17:13:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	once its done, split the file before burning
2006-12-12T17:14:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	that's what in my head. But since I will write a crontab for this, I want to keep it as simple as possible. So having a 2GB tar archive, I am curious if splitting is compulsory or not.
2006-12-12T17:15:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	probably not.
2006-12-12T17:16:00.000Z	reverseblade	rapid	what do you recommend, should I split it or not ?
2006-12-12T17:17:00.000Z	rapid	reverseblade	its quite easy to split it then put it back together. if the documentation says to do so, then you probably should.
