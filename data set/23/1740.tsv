2009-11-10T23:17:00.000Z	davdm2010		could use some suggestions, not sure if this is the right place. When I type my routers IP, I get my Apache web page. Thoughts?
2009-11-10T23:18:00.000Z	davdm2010		Dr: local IP.
2009-11-10T23:18:00.000Z	davdm2010		Dr: From the host computer, not from other computers.
2009-11-10T23:19:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	check /etc/hosts
2009-11-10T23:19:00.000Z	davdm2010	xt28	OK
2009-11-10T23:22:00.000Z	davdm2010	xt28	I don't see any mention of my router ip. I just have local 127... and my host ip address.
2009-11-10T23:23:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	does the route command return anything that looks wrong?
2009-11-10T23:25:00.000Z	davdm2010	xt28	One are that looks strange id the ff02::ip-6-mcastprefix and a few others
2009-11-10T23:26:00.000Z	xt28		!paste | davdm2010
2009-11-10T23:26:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	can you paste the output of route?
2009-11-10T23:28:00.000Z	davdm2010		xt28:http://paste.ubuntu.com/315270/
2009-11-10T23:30:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	that's the hosts file, isn't it?
2009-11-10T23:30:00.000Z	davdm2010		yes
2009-11-10T23:31:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	can you paste the output of route?
2009-11-10T23:31:00.000Z	davdm2010		let me try. What command would that be?
2009-11-10T23:32:00.000Z	davdm2010	xt28	http://paste.ubuntu.com/315275/
2009-11-10T23:33:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	so your router is 192.168.200.1?
2009-11-10T23:34:00.000Z	davdm2010	xt28	yes
2009-11-10T23:36:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	maybe you have enabled port forwarding in your router, so it will just send network packets back to your computer?
2009-11-10T23:37:00.000Z	davdm2010	xt28	I do have port forwarding enabled. So, you think it might be in that area?
2009-11-10T23:37:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	yes.
2009-11-10T23:38:00.000Z	davdm2010	xt28	Thanks at least that narrows my search and fix.
2009-11-10T23:39:00.000Z	xt28	davdm2010	then again, if you can't access your router's web interface, because it sends everything back to you, your router manufacturer screwed up...
