2006-08-20T08:10:00.000Z	imme		:D
2006-08-20T08:10:00.000Z	imme		Does anyone know the Command Line program animals?
2006-08-20T08:11:00.000Z	deltab	imme	animals - Traditional AI animal guessing engine using a binary tree DB
2006-08-20T08:11:00.000Z	deltab	imme	that?
2006-08-20T08:11:00.000Z	imme	deltab	Yes
2006-08-20T08:11:00.000Z	imme	deltab	Do you by any chance know how to reset it?
2006-08-20T08:15:00.000Z	deltab	imme	yeah, /var/games/animals/animals.db
2006-08-20T08:17:00.000Z	imme	deltab	I did a "man animals", had to think of that one earlier... :S
2006-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	deltab	imme	strace -e file animals  is another way
2006-08-20T08:25:00.000Z	imme	deltab	What does it exactly do? "strace -e file animals", is the animals.db a file with multiple system calls or something like that:S?
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	deltab	imme	animals accesses that file, and strace tells you when it does so
2006-08-20T08:30:00.000Z	imme	deltab	Can you do strace on most programs or only simple ones?
2006-08-20T08:31:00.000Z	deltab	imme	any, except setuid ones
2006-08-20T08:32:00.000Z	deltab	imme	it's useful for seeing what programs are doing, what files they access, etc.
2006-08-20T08:32:00.000Z	imme	deltab	yeah, I wrote it down.
2006-08-20T08:33:00.000Z	imme	deltab	I kind of keep track of my powerfull commands in ubuntu... :P like "ps -ef"(if i'm not mistaking now)...
2006-08-20T08:34:00.000Z	deltab	imme	do you know about pstree?
2006-08-20T08:34:00.000Z	imme	deltab	Now I do. :P
2006-08-20T08:34:00.000Z	imme	deltab	nice...
2006-08-20T08:35:00.000Z	imme	deltab	Thanks for the tips, I'm off now, got to teach animals. :P
