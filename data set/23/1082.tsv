2010-09-11T22:48:00.000Z	faibistes		hi I've connections issues with my rt3090 wifi card
2010-09-11T22:48:00.000Z	faibistes		has anybody experience with this card?
2010-09-11T22:48:00.000Z	faibistes		the netbook is an asuss eee 1001ha
2010-09-11T22:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	realtek have linux drivers you can compile
2010-09-11T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	how are you pinging? By name or IP?
2010-09-11T22:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	weird. Can the unpingable system access the WWW?
2010-09-11T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	if you edit /etc/resolv.conf and change the first namesrver to 8.8.8.8 does it get web access
2010-09-11T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	try without the encryption to test
2010-09-11T22:56:00.000Z	faibistes	ActionParsnip	is there any other step I could try first, besides disabling encryption?
2010-09-11T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	not sure. Its a good test though. Maybe you need extra compile options to get wpa
2010-09-11T22:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	not all wireless devices can do wpa under linux. Id imagine realtek ones can though
2010-09-11T23:01:00.000Z	faibistes	ActionParsnip	now just how freak is this? I can ping the netbook from a PC in the private network but I can't ping it from the router. And the netbook is in the router's association list
2010-09-11T23:04:00.000Z	faibistes	ActionParsnip	anything else i could try? As I said, reconfiguring the network isn't easy here. I wouldn't like to go through the pain of reconfiguring 2 headless servers without network access
2010-09-11T23:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	i'd check the compile settings you used for the driver. Also use a wired connection and get fully updated
2010-09-11T23:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	i'd get the source and compile it . Sounds like the deb isn't great
2010-09-11T23:08:00.000Z	faibistes	ActionParsnip	but do you still think it's a driver thing. can't it be upper in the stack?
2010-09-11T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	could log a bug I guess
2010-09-11T23:09:00.000Z	faibistes	ActionParsnip	OK, I may comment on one of those 100's of rt3090 bugs.... my wife is going to kill me
2010-09-11T23:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	could grab a wireless device which works out of the box. They are stupidly cheap
2010-09-11T23:12:00.000Z	faibistes	ActionParsnip	Not that it's a bad solution, but this is one of those "Hell I'm gonna fix it" things. It's recovering from a failed upgrade to lucid. I feel like I'm almost there
2010-09-11T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	could try ndisgtk
2010-09-11T23:14:00.000Z	faibistes	ActionParsnip	a little better. Isn't ndis a little flaky, or worse for performance? Or is it quite safe?
2010-09-11T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	faibistes	its fine
