2008-01-19T23:37:00.000Z	adrock358		 050d:705a mrobvious is this it?
2008-01-19T23:38:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	that's the USB ID -- type that into Google to find out your chipset
2008-01-19T23:40:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	well, if you do, you'll find that you have an rt73 chipset
2008-01-19T23:41:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	don't tell MrObvious that I sneaked the answer to you
2008-01-19T23:42:00.000Z	adrock358	soundray	said my chipset is rt73.  thank you, but i'm not uinterested in learning how to use linux while i have no wireless card.  i supposed i could skip work, and sit at my computer and learn linux without an internet connection, but that doesn't seem like a very good use of my time.  Does it to you?
2008-01-19T23:43:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	don't be so touchy. You're getting valuable help here.
2008-01-19T23:44:00.000Z	adrock358	soundray	 you;re right.  i'm just fried man.  i have too much pressure going to be dealing with this.  i don't know how to use linux.  i will.  and i will learn.  but now is not the best time for me.  i just want to get my internet card working.
2008-01-19T23:45:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	how did you determine that it's not working already?
2008-01-19T23:45:00.000Z	adrock358	soundray	 my wireless only works ont he livecd.  after i install it does not
2008-01-19T23:47:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	your device is supported by a module that is called rt73usb. It comes with Ubuntu as standard.
2008-01-19T23:47:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	now let me check where you're at -- you have a fresh install?
2008-01-19T23:48:00.000Z	adrock358	soundray	 sudo modprobe for that is negative as well.  soundray.  yes, fresh install.
2008-01-19T23:49:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	see if you have this file present on your system: /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/ubuntu/wireless/rt2x00/rt73usb.ko
2008-01-19T23:50:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	is it there?
2008-01-19T23:52:00.000Z	adrock358	soundray	i got disconnected.
2008-01-19T23:52:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	see if you have this file present on your system: /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/ubuntu/wireless/rt2x00/rt73usb.ko
2008-01-19T23:58:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	still here?
2008-01-23T05:33:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	with lsusb
2008-01-23T05:36:00.000Z	adrock358	soundray	 You know, I tried that and I got a single set of numbers.  I'm following this guide, where we are editing files, and in that file they have the usb as a pair of ID's denoted {xx@xx, xx@xx}.  Hey thanks for the help yesterday.
2008-01-23T05:37:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	it's probably just reformatted
2008-03-12T04:35:00.000Z	soundray	adrock358	##windows
