2012-05-06T10:54:00.000Z	cocolos		I get You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run nvidia-xconfig as root), and restart the X server.
2012-05-06T10:54:00.000Z	cocolos		I tried and restarted and still nothing
2012-05-06T10:56:00.000Z	cocolos		I just installed new drivers and sdk
2012-05-06T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 how did you install the drivers?
2012-05-06T10:57:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	I installed the toolkit then I went to tty to install drivers
2012-05-06T10:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 so you used the self installing .run drivers from the nvidia site?
2012-05-06T10:58:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	yea
2012-05-06T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 you did try the drivers from the repos and the PPA's first?
2012-05-06T10:59:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	How do I do that
2012-05-06T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	  the addational-drivers tool, (jockey-gtk) installs them from the repos.. thats how one normally installs them.
2012-05-06T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 id have that .run program remove its drivers, and try the  jockey tool first
2012-05-06T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 you run jockey-gtk and click... ;)
2012-05-06T11:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 in the menus its called 'addational-drivers' i belive
2012-05-06T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 you DONT have one of those dual-gpu optimus  setups do you?
2012-05-06T11:01:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	no
2012-05-06T11:03:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	first I need to unistall current drivers? can I do that over ssh
2012-05-06T11:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 i dont use the .run drivers. I think they do have some uninstall option. You might not need to remove them.. but its a good idea
2012-05-06T11:04:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	I tried running jockey but it error out
2012-05-06T11:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 if you are ssh'd in -  you could use the jockey-text tool.
2012-05-06T11:05:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	Downloading package indexes failed, note I am on 10.04
2012-05-06T11:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 or just try installing the nvidia-current package.
2012-05-06T11:13:00.000Z	cocolos	Dr_willis	any idea on CUDA error: CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version?
2012-05-06T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cocolos	 no clue. i dont use cuda.  the extendt of me using nvidia drivers - is i do a clean install.. run the jockey tool and install them from the repos.. done.
