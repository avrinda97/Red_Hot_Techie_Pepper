2008-12-07T23:37:00.000Z	xargon		i have a nvidia 8800 gts  which has 2 outputs, i want to use one for monitor and other for hdmi to the tv, i was able to do this in windows, anyone know how i can do this in ubuntu
2008-12-07T23:38:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	enable the restricted driver at System>Admin>Hardware drivers.. then open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings.. you'll find that after install at System>Admin>Nvidia x server settings..
2008-12-07T23:41:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	i get the error: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2008-12-07T23:41:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	do you have Synaptic open? or is auto update running?
2008-12-07T23:41:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	ahh silly me yes i do
2008-12-07T23:41:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	or "add remove programs" ?
2008-12-07T23:42:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	do i have to restart, it seems to have finished installing
2008-12-07T23:42:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	nope.. that's windows thinking.. just check System>Admin>Nvidia <something>
2008-12-07T23:43:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	i dont see it, can i just type nvidia-settings in terminal?
2008-12-07T23:43:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	yes
2008-12-07T23:44:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	sometimes it won't show until the next X restart.. or you can force it to show by right mouse clicking on "Applications" and choose "Edit Menus".. then navigating to the appropriate location and removing the check mark and then replacing it..
2008-12-07T23:45:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	ahh i think i still have to restart for the comp to recognize the hdmi input
2008-12-07T23:45:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	wait
2008-12-07T23:46:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	do you have a direct HDMI output and a DVI AND a VGA?
2008-12-07T23:47:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	there's a section in nvidia-settings that you have to activate the alternate output.. but will only work after hooking it to the secondary monitor.
2008-12-07T23:47:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	well it is hooked up, i guess i just have to find the option
2008-12-07T23:48:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	x server Display configuration
2008-12-07T23:48:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	im not sure waht you mean by that
2008-12-07T23:48:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	in nvidia-settings.
2008-12-07T23:49:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	hopefully someone else will pick this up.. I've gotta run.. sorry.. good luck
2008-12-07T23:49:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	i got it working so
2008-12-07T23:49:00.000Z	xargon	Izinucs	thanks a lot <3
2008-12-07T23:49:00.000Z	Izinucs	xargon	cool
