2005-10-09T13:56:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	not at all
2005-10-09T14:08:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	then only use official repos and backports sparingly (when needed)
2005-10-16T13:13:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	i dont think so
2005-10-16T13:13:00.000Z	damo21	nalioth	:( thats the only thing i really need
2005-10-16T13:14:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	there are window manglers you can use that do
2005-10-16T13:14:00.000Z	damo21	nalioth	i guess i'll stick with xfce then until gnome makes that an option
2005-10-16T13:17:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	use ctrl-alt-right/left arrow
2005-10-16T13:18:00.000Z	damo21	nalioth	meh too much effort, xfce is easier :P
2005-10-16T13:18:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	install xubuntu-desktop in breezy
2005-10-16T13:23:00.000Z	damo21	nalioth	which are the other packages i could uninstall if i just use xubuntu
2005-10-16T13:23:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	keep all your files, they'll all work under xfce4
2005-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	abiword is a very light txt/rtf editor
2005-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	nalioth	damo21	a not so good cd burner
