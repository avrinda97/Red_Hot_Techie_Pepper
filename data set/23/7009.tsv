2005-11-01T12:38:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	it'd be easier if you explained your reasons for not wanting the
2005-11-01T12:38:00.000Z	Korio	bob2	im just trying out as many as I can
2005-11-01T12:39:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	apt-cache showpkg x-window-manager
2005-11-18T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	it's in multiverse, wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto
2005-11-18T07:36:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	get rid of that, for a start
2005-11-18T07:36:00.000Z	Korio	bob2	 why?
2005-11-18T07:36:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	then actually read the page I pointed you at, and enable the universe repository
2005-11-18T07:37:00.000Z	Korio	bob2	that link was for warty, and i dont run gnome
2005-11-18T07:37:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	awesome
2005-11-18T07:37:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	#kubuntu, I guess (and it' snot just for warty)
2005-11-18T07:37:00.000Z	Korio	bob2	i run xfce..
2005-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	then presumably you know how to use aptitude or apt
2005-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	Korio	bob2	yes?
2005-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	so read /etc/apt/sources.list and tell it to enable multiverse (the file explains how)
2005-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	Korio	bob2	well thats what I did before I even came to this channel
2005-11-18T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	if you had, mplayer would be available
2005-11-18T07:39:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	perhaps now you should just show it to us, so we can tell you which line is incorrect
2005-11-18T07:40:00.000Z	Korio	bob2	u got pm
2005-11-18T07:41:00.000Z	bob2	Korio	#flood or pastebin.ca
