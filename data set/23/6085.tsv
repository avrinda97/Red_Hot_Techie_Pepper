2006-06-15T08:56:00.000Z	mystamax_		Is it possible to unmount a drive via Gnome? Everytime I try it states, Unable to unmount, only root can unmount.
2006-06-15T08:58:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	you can actually just edit your fstab and make it user mountable and umountable
2006-06-15T08:59:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	I thought there was a way to adjust that. Are you familar w/ what you stated? Do you know the correct syntax or can you point me in the right direction
2006-06-15T09:01:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	Yeah I know how to do it, you will need to pop up a terminal and cd to /etc and then type sudo nano -w fstab to edit fstab , what kind of device are you trying to make unmountable, is it a removable drive or one thats sata/ide?
2006-06-15T09:02:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	its SATA in this particular machine, I have my drive partition 4 times and  I have 2 windows based partitions that i dont want mounted
2006-06-15T09:03:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	Do you want them mounted sometimes or never?
2006-06-15T09:04:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	I have one I don't mounted @ all, and I'd like to mount the other when need be.
2006-06-15T09:05:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	alright, well umount them both now, then edit your fstab by popping up a terminal and typing cd /etc then typing sudo nano -w fstab then you will see all your mounts on your system
2006-06-15T09:06:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	It doesn't do much, just disables wrapping of long lines
2006-06-15T09:07:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	Cool thx
2006-06-15T09:08:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	in the fstab you see your drives and stuff, all your mounts on your system, and then you see your ntfs mounts, under <options> do the ntfs ones say defaults or do they have more than just that?
2006-06-15T09:09:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	more than that
2006-06-15T09:09:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	what exactly does one of them say?
2006-06-15T09:09:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	ntfs    defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1
2006-06-15T09:10:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	Alright, add this, do this line, defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46,user
2006-06-15T09:10:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	Just add user at the end like that to both of them
2006-06-15T09:11:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	And what ntfs partition did you not want mounted ever, was it the main one? And do you recognize which one it is in your fstab?
2006-06-15T09:12:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	ntfs    defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1    <-- Do I add it after the numerical 1 OR add comma and then add user w/o spaces
2006-06-15T09:12:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	good question let me double check
2006-06-15T09:12:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	Before the 0 after gid=46 so it would be gid=46,user
2006-06-15T09:22:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	I don't have to map to /media/ right? I can map anywhere I have created a folder?
2006-06-15T09:23:00.000Z	mystamax_	Malikith	Also, in fstab the type of one of the drives is NTFS, but in gparted it states its a FAT32
2006-06-15T09:33:00.000Z	Malikith	mystamax_	Yeah you can mount any drive anywhere as long as there is a directory there in place for it to put all its contents into
