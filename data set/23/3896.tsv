2011-12-06T23:18:00.000Z	XDS2010		I want ubuntu to go back to gnome by default
2011-12-06T23:18:00.000Z	XDS2010		I don't like unity at all
2011-12-06T23:19:00.000Z	XDS2010		Why is gnome dead ?
2011-12-06T23:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 gnome 2 is dead.. thd gnome devs decided to stop supporting it.
2011-12-06T23:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 'gnome 2' is dead.. not 'gnome'
2011-12-06T23:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 why should they?
2011-12-06T23:21:00.000Z	XDS2010	dr_willis	 why shouldn't they?
2011-12-06T23:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 lack of manpower.. and if the actual devs are not supporting it...  why should they spend the manpower on it.
2011-12-06T23:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 dual boot what os's ?
2011-12-06T23:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 so whats stopping you?  thats a normal way of using ubuntu
2011-12-06T23:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	a 'live' setup should have the installer icon/program on it. unless you re using some other odd 'live' install method.
2011-12-06T23:27:00.000Z	XDS2010	dr_willis	 it doesn't it sux
2011-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 you should be a bit more detailed in what you mean and are doing and how you did a 'live' install.
2011-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 ive definatly done live installs to flash drives and installed from them.
2011-12-06T23:29:00.000Z	XDS2010	dr_willis	 im running a live slax install right now on /sdb i have windows installed on /sda1 and want ubuntu to be able to dual boot on demand from /sda2
2011-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	XDS2010	dr_willis	 /sda2 is currently formatted with ext2
2011-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	  if you inssist on not using a ubuntu cd or flash drive. you should look into a debootstrap install of ubuntu. easier to just use a cd or flash.
2011-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	XDS2010	dr_willis	 what dont you understand ?
2011-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 this is the first time you actually explained what you were doing... and first you metnioned slax..
2011-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	XDS2010	dr_willis	 no this is the first time you asked me to repeat myself
2011-12-06T23:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 you can use 'debootstrap' to install ubuntu to a drive from within a differnt linux os  if you dont want to boot a cd/flash.
2011-12-06T23:41:00.000Z	XDS2010	dr_willis	 what is debbootstrap ive never heard of that is it new ?
2011-12-06T23:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	XDS2010	 first google hit -> debootstrap is a tool which will install a Debian base system into a subdirectory of another, already installed system. It doesn't require an installation CD, just access to a Debian repository. It can also be installed and run from another operating system,
