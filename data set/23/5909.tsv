2007-06-17T07:18:00.000Z	jose		Could anyone help me get my microphone working? Alsamixer is of  little use, I'm afraid.
2007-06-17T07:19:00.000Z	jose		err
2007-06-17T07:19:00.000Z	jose		patches?
2007-06-17T07:19:00.000Z	jose		You mean, err - dependencies or updates?
2007-06-17T07:20:00.000Z	nesl247	jose	I mean the actual patches
2007-06-17T07:21:00.000Z	nesl247		I know there is the .diff.gz file for each package, but that's not that great if you're trying to look at specific patches
2007-06-17T07:21:00.000Z	jose		nes1247 - I'm at a loss, though. What kinds of patches? What are you using them for?
2007-06-17T07:23:00.000Z	nesl247	jose	What do you mean what kind of patch. The patches that are used to patch the original package that is gotten from upstream..
2007-06-17T07:24:00.000Z	jose	nesl247	- So.... updates, then?
2007-06-17T07:24:00.000Z	nesl247		NO
2007-06-17T07:24:00.000Z	nesl247		A patch, you know, what's made with diff.
2007-06-17T07:24:00.000Z	jose	nesl247	- aaaah
2007-06-17T07:28:00.000Z	nesl247	jose	soo?
2007-06-17T07:28:00.000Z	jose	nesl247	- I'm reading up on it
2007-06-17T07:29:00.000Z	nesl247		thanks
2007-06-17T07:29:00.000Z	jose	nesl247	- are you looking to patch your kernel or something?
2007-06-17T07:29:00.000Z	nesl247	jose	Looking to port ubuntu's patches
2007-06-17T07:31:00.000Z	jose	nesl247	- You check out https://patches.ubuntu.com/   ?
2007-06-17T07:31:00.000Z	nesl247	jose	Those are patches against debians packages, not against upstream packages
2007-06-17T07:31:00.000Z	jose	nesl247	- gotcha
2007-06-17T07:34:00.000Z	jose	nesl247	- sorry dude, but this is beyond me. Have you tried asking in #ubuntu-devel?
2007-06-17T07:34:00.000Z	nesl247	jose	Nope, will do thanks
