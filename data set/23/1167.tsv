2010-09-09T22:44:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	'demonic' ?
2010-09-09T22:51:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	I am stuck at verifying dmi pool data after a installation-
2010-09-09T22:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	that's a BIOS error, check the cables connected to the hard disk
2010-09-09T22:54:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	thnx will do!
2010-09-09T23:08:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	Checked the cables and restesting- same issue
2010-09-09T23:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	then either your motherboard or your hard disk is having issues, enter BIOS settings and check if the hard disk is detected
2010-09-09T23:12:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	in bios- under standard cmos features- the two hardrives are listed as chanell 0 master and chanel 1 master
2010-09-09T23:24:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	so problem solved?
2010-09-09T23:28:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	I got it to launch the cd. Now I am checking th disk for erros with the ubuntu setup
2010-09-09T23:30:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	it said it found no errors bust still will only boot from cd
2010-09-09T23:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	what's the exact error message you get?
2010-09-09T23:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	when you boot from the CD
2010-09-09T23:32:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	how come it "sits there" but lets you boot?
2010-09-09T23:33:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	 if this hangs, then it's before anything has booted
2010-09-09T23:35:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	test the hard drive on another computer, it could be faulty
2010-09-09T23:35:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	can you browse the hard disk from the live cd?
2010-09-09T23:35:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	yes i can brows the disk from livecd
2010-09-09T23:39:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	what did this problem start to happen? did you change anything in BIOS or hardware before it started happening?
2010-09-09T23:40:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	I got this computer fixed- they said it was the hardrive so I lost my OS: I decided to install ubunutu- I havent been able to get past the instalation. It never boots up from when it was installed. It think It might be the cd so I was trying to book from flashdrive. I think it finally did it
2010-09-09T23:41:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ceegee	it's not the CD drive, it's STILL the hard disk or BIOS, most likely the hard disk
2010-09-09T23:43:00.000Z	ceegee	ilovefairuz	thank you so much for your helo. Il try using a new diskdrive- if not then I know its the bios
