2010-10-19T07:32:00.000Z	FalseLobster		Anyone want to help me figure out whats up with my drivers?
2010-10-19T07:34:00.000Z	FalseLobster		ATI 4850... it used to work fine (my sound also stopped working)
2010-10-19T07:34:00.000Z	FalseLobster		Yes, but it used to work fine
2010-10-19T07:35:00.000Z	FalseLobster		It's a live usb, so I'm suspecting that when I booted to a different machine recently
2010-10-19T07:35:00.000Z	FalseLobster		it got the drivers mixed up or something
2010-10-19T07:35:00.000Z	FalseLobster		I've tried to reinstall the ATI driver
2010-10-19T07:36:00.000Z	FalseLobster		but I'm getting this: http://pastebin.com/ySVZdNJi
2010-10-19T07:37:00.000Z	FalseLobster		I must say, I bought this tower from a friend who needed cash, but I've really disliked my experience with ATI.
2010-10-19T07:38:00.000Z	jags	FalseLobster	don't use fglrx, the opensource driver is pretty good
2010-10-19T07:38:00.000Z	FalseLobster	jags	which one is that?
2010-10-19T07:38:00.000Z	jags	FalseLobster	I'll find the latest ppa
2010-10-19T07:41:00.000Z	FalseLobster	jags	so with the open source one I wouldn't need the Catalyst Control Center, either... ?
2010-10-19T07:42:00.000Z	jags		no
2010-10-19T07:42:00.000Z	jags		FalsAlarm, no*
2010-10-19T07:44:00.000Z	jags		FalsAlarm, you'll want to completely uninstall fglrx if you have any packages, https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
2010-10-19T07:45:00.000Z	jags	FalseLobster	 https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa*
2010-10-19T07:45:00.000Z	FalseLobster	jags	I'm getting all these errors trying to remove the fglrx packages
2010-10-19T07:46:00.000Z	jags		FalsAlarm, are you using synaptic?
2010-10-19T07:46:00.000Z	jags	FalseLobster	are you using synaptic*
2010-10-19T07:46:00.000Z	FalseLobster	jags	Should I be using that over the Ubuntu Software Center ?
2010-10-19T07:46:00.000Z	jags	FalseLobster	either one
2010-10-19T07:47:00.000Z	jags	FalseLobster	synaptic has more info i think
2010-10-19T07:49:00.000Z	FalseLobster	jags	I'm trying the removal through synaptic this time, thanks for the help
