2006-11-12T17:03:00.000Z	variant	mixandgo	and a supported card
2006-11-12T17:03:00.000Z	mixandgo	variant	what is aixgl
2006-11-12T17:04:00.000Z	variant	mixandgo	an alternative to xgl (its replacement)
2006-11-12T17:04:00.000Z	mixandgo	variant	and where do I get it ?
2006-11-12T17:04:00.000Z	variant	mixandgo	it is built into edgy
2006-11-12T17:04:00.000Z	variant	mixandgo	you wont be able to use it if you have the propreitry ati drivers
2006-11-12T17:04:00.000Z	mixandgo	variant	I am using nvidia
2006-11-12T17:04:00.000Z	variant	mixandgo	and if you have an nvidia card you have to use experimental drivers
2006-11-12T17:05:00.000Z	variant	mixandgo	avoid it for now untill the drivers are stableised
2006-11-12T17:05:00.000Z	variant	mixandgo	or buy a nice card with full free software support
