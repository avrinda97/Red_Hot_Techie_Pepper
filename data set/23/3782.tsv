2008-01-25T21:15:00.000Z	santosh_		can anyone help me know how update-pciids works?
2008-01-25T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	it goes to a website and downloads a new definition file
2008-01-25T21:16:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	who updates it?
2008-01-25T21:16:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	the package maintainers
2008-01-25T21:16:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	: sorry i mean how it is tracked?
2008-01-25T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	what do you mean tracked ? the description file has a version, each update release incrments the version
2008-01-25T21:17:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	I mean how they know about different configuration?
2008-01-25T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	what different configuration, it's just 1 file
2008-01-25T21:18:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	yes i got it, but if a new hardware appears, how do they know about it?
2008-01-25T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	you don't - if new hardware appears the package maintainers update the file - you get the update file when you want to
2008-01-25T21:19:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	thank you ikonia. i want to know how it works more than knowing that its just a file
2008-01-25T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	what do you mean how it works
2008-01-25T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	lspci is a binary application, that reads device ID's from a flat file and offers a human readable output
2008-01-25T21:20:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	How it helps?
2008-01-25T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	how it helps ??? it shows you information about your hardware, thats it
2008-01-25T21:21:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	Yes i know that, what i mean is i want to know how different hardwares are identified?
2008-01-25T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	each hardware has a device ID - that device ID is listed in the file with a human readable name
2008-01-25T21:22:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	I checked that. You mean it is not useful more than just knowing the hardware info?
2008-01-25T21:26:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	may i know if i am right? You mean its only useful for knowing the hardware info?
2008-01-25T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	that's its function
2008-01-25T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	santosh_	lspci = "list PCI devices"
2008-01-25T21:33:00.000Z	santosh_	ikonia	Thankyou, have any idea, i have problem with external mouse. It doesnt work after i configured my display with dpkg-reconfigure
