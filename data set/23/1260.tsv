2010-06-21T00:45:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	404
2010-06-21T00:46:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	it's just 127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin  right?
2010-06-21T00:46:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	yeah, that should work
2010-06-21T00:47:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	but it's not :( i even tried to do apt-get again
2010-06-21T00:47:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	do you have another site enabled?
2010-06-21T00:47:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	is there another step after i do apt-get install? the tutorial i was following seemed to leave a lot out
2010-06-21T00:48:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	I have the fluxtorrent-b4rt setup open, if that's what you mean
2010-06-21T00:48:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	when you install phpmyadmin it should ask you what http server it should be setup for, I just chose apache from there
2010-06-21T00:49:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	like, it'll just pop up after install and ask me?
2010-06-21T00:49:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	it asked during the install, in the console
2010-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	turtle-man		hm...it didn't...
2010-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	see if "sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin" shows it
2010-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	k thnx... I'll try that
2010-06-21T00:58:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	still getting a 404
2010-06-21T00:59:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	but i did notice something about making a database... I don't think that an existing database could cause this, could it?
2010-06-21T01:01:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	phpmyadmin needs a database to work apparently, after it asked me if I wanted it to create the database, it asked "Please choose the web server that should be automatically configured to run phpMyAdmin.", one option was "apache2"
2010-06-21T01:06:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	okay, chose apache2 (that is the server i have) but when i got to make the database... It's asking me unix socket or tcp/ip I have no idea what to chose for the database
2010-06-21T01:07:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	it looks like it's asking you all the "low priority" questions too, anyway "unix socket" it the option you want there
2010-06-21T01:08:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	other than the questions asking for the password(s), the default selected options should work
2010-06-21T01:08:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	should i be using the default admin username?
2010-06-21T01:09:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	okay, I'll just try to blast through these questions :P
2010-06-21T01:10:00.000Z	tsimpson	turtle-man	the "Name of the database's administrative user" is "root", with whatever password you set mysql up with, and "phpmyadmin" is fine for the "MySQL username for phpmyadmin"
2010-06-21T01:22:00.000Z	turtle-man	tsimpson	it's still not working,,, but I'm feeling drained so i think that means it's lunch time. thanks for the help
