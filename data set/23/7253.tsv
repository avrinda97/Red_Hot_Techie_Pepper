2005-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	be more descriptive: is it starting up? does plain mplayer work?
2005-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	so you can access the preferences dialogue?  gmplayer uses different preferences to mplayer, apparently
2005-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	what to do for that
2005-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	try different video settings in the prefs dialogue: it's probably trying to use something that your system doesn't support
2005-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	there aren't many of them, and when you've set it, you've set it
2005-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	i had configured a lot selected most options but, no good
2005-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	SDL is usually workable, in my experience
2005-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	describe SDL plz
2005-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	also, you may need to restart gmplayer for the changes to take effect: so it might have seemed like it wasn't working
2005-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	i had restarted after each setting configuration
2005-09-19T11:30:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	can you find out what console mplayer is using?
2005-09-19T11:32:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	less /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf
2005-09-19T11:33:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	i had read n modifed some of conf file but no good for gui
2005-09-19T11:34:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	the conf for the gui is separate, in ~/.mplayer/gui.conf
2005-09-19T11:34:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	make that match the config which works for normal mplayer, and you should be sorted
2005-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	vo_driver=........
2005-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	error is like : Error opening/initializing the selected video_output(-vo) device
2005-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	even when you make it match the one that works for plain mplayer?
2005-09-19T11:40:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	how to do that match
2005-09-19T11:41:00.000Z	djm62	heart_reaver	as a normal user, gedit ~/.mplayer/gui.conf
2005-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	:P ok thanks
2005-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	heart_reaver	djm62	:P ok thanks
