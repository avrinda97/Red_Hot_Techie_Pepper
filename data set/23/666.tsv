2012-02-11T09:18:00.000Z	benhelps		Hey all. Was getting tips earlier to getting wifi working on my laptop. Closer to solved now (lspci sees wifi hw) but still not in ifconfig
2012-02-11T09:18:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	try ifconfig -a
2012-02-11T09:19:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	that shows all of the network interfaces, even disabled ones.
2012-02-11T09:19:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	even with the -a option?
2012-02-11T09:21:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	you been here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4311_rev_01_(ndiswrapper) yet?
2012-02-11T09:21:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	that uses a windows driver in ndiswrapper, but it should work if your prepared to be a little hacky
2012-02-11T09:22:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	can you give the output of "lspci -vvnn | grep 14e4"
2012-02-11T09:25:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	great
2012-02-11T09:26:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	does the correct broadcom driver appear in "additional drivers" (under system settings pane)

2012-02-11T09:28:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	so try this: "sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source"

2012-02-11T09:31:00.000Z	hydrox24	benhelps	on second thought... run that command
