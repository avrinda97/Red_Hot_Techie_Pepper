2005-09-01T09:22:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	You might try a different mirror, but outside that, I've not a clue.  Apologies.
2005-09-01T10:00:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	You can, but it's not set up by default.  I haven't used it in a couple years, but the explanation I used last time I set it up was in the grub-doc pacakge.
2005-09-03T07:01:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	The ubuntu kernel team looks at it first.  You can make a deb with kernel-package for installation, but it won't have all the nifty patches.
2005-09-03T07:03:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	Take a look at linux-patch-ubuntu for details...
2005-09-03T07:04:00.000Z	aftertaf	persia	"Ubuntu patches to Linux 2.6.10"
2005-09-03T07:07:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	Well, first they won't apply to a pristine kernel: just the specially modified "orig" kernel from ubuntu.  Secondly, they are for 2.6.10, rather than 2.6.13.  If you don't want to play with kernel internals, avoid this.  Otherwise, have fun.  You might do better to hunt for the ubuntu  patches for 2.6.12 if you really want to patch 2.6.13.
2005-09-03T07:11:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	there's some documentation available in /usr/share/doc if you install the linux-tree pacakge.  More than this, you'd want to ask google or someone on the kernel team.
2005-09-05T06:52:00.000Z	aftertaf	persia	 is it winfs ??
2005-09-05T07:12:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	uptime is uptime
2005-09-05T07:38:00.000Z	persia	aftertaf	A metasyntactic variable contains some unspecified value in language the way that $i holds an unspecified value in ...do echo $i; done.  The canonical metasyntactic variables are foo, bar, baz, and quux.  More information is available from either the jargon file or some of the old files on rftm.mit.edu (or whatever the MIT RTFM server is called).
