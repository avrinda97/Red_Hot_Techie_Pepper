2007-07-24T06:44:00.000Z	mythtv		hlst0 i have no idea from what i've looked up says that it should find them automatically, but how to i fix that?
2007-07-24T06:46:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	if its an mpeg encoder.
2007-07-24T06:43:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	are you using the proper drivers?
2007-07-24T06:45:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	the other thing maybe to try capturing the video directly from the device.
2007-07-24T06:45:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	ex: cat /dev/video0 > test.mpg
2007-07-24T06:46:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	it is what?  capturing?
2007-07-24T06:47:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	cat prints out files.  well a nifty little trick is to cat the device to a mpeg since its outputting mpeg and then trying to play back the test
2007-07-24T06:47:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	just hit ctrl+c to stop the cat /dev/video0 > test.mpg
2007-07-24T06:47:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	after a little while
2007-07-24T06:48:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	Yeah set the channel first too.
2007-07-24T06:49:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	I'm trying to remember the exact command something with ivtv or whatever.  I though mythtv's site had a whole bunch of info on trouble shooting.
2007-07-24T06:49:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	there is also #mythtv channel here.
2007-07-24T06:50:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	its h one not h L
2007-07-24T06:50:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	/j #mythtv
2007-07-24T06:50:00.000Z	mythtv	h1st0	haha ok
2007-07-24T06:50:00.000Z	mythtv	h1st0	thanks... bye
2007-07-24T06:50:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	or /join #mythtv  depends on what client you are using for irc.
2007-07-24T06:51:00.000Z	mythtv	h1st0	it says i'm banned
2007-07-24T06:51:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	ahh probably your nick.  You may have to change it to enter the channel
2007-07-24T06:51:00.000Z	h1st0	mythtv	that name is probably reserved.  try /nick "whatever"    no qoutes
