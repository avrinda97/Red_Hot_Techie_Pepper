2012-02-06T15:14:00.000Z	theadmin	Krised	So, sudo chroot /media/first_few_letters<tab>

2012-02-06T15:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Krised	Uuuuuh... That hardly makes any sense. ls /media/ # Don't see it listed?

2012-02-06T15:18:00.000Z	theadmin	Krised	Meh anyway, does it look like a bunch of hex numbers (that is 0-9, A-F) with dashes?
2012-02-06T15:18:00.000Z	Krised	theadmin	yes.. ill just see if i can check the partition name in gparted

2012-02-06T15:19:00.000Z	Krised	theadmin	problem: it cant resolve host ubuntu.. aparently my sudo doesnt work.. since i booted up on livecd and im trying to fix my broken login manager (i want lightDM back instead of lxdm
2012-02-06T15:20:00.000Z	theadmin	Krised	You don't really need a livecd for that, boot to the "broken" system, hit Ctrl-Alt-F2, log in and do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm"
2012-02-06T15:21:00.000Z	Krised	theadmin	ok ill try that ty
2012-02-06T15:25:00.000Z	Krised	theadmin	damn man youre a linux guru.. would you happen to know if i can change the lightDM login "Other" to another name ?
2012-02-06T15:25:00.000Z	theadmin	Krised	Nah probably not without recompiling from source
2012-02-06T15:26:00.000Z	Krised	theadmin	its ok. I just gotta remember saving all my shit first and burn a working copy of it.
2012-02-06T15:27:00.000Z	theadmin	Krised	K, sure thing
2012-02-06T16:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Krised	Try Testdisk (disk recovery) or Photorec (file recovery), both are part of the "testdisk" package in APT
