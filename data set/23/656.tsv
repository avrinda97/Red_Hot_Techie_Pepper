2011-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	are you running lucid?
2011-05-01T07:02:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	thats a pretty old ppa you may want to purge it with ppa-purge (its for lucid lynx)
2011-05-01T07:04:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	where could I find a newer ppa?
2011-05-01T07:04:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	is there a reason you don't want to use ubuntu firefox
2011-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	Oh, I thought I was
2011-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	no a ppa is for testing software or for things that are configured differently from stock ubuntu
2011-05-01T07:06:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	is ubuntu ff in the software center?
2011-05-01T07:07:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	yes
2011-05-01T07:07:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	you will want to look at ppa-purge then use synaptic to install firefox
2011-05-01T07:08:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	where is ppa-purge?
2011-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	sudo apt-get ppa-purge. just look over what you plan to do first, because in the meantime you wont have a browser
2011-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	that's fine, if anything I have chrome
2011-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	is it named ppa-purge? It's not finding the package
2011-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	yes
2011-05-01T07:15:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	ok well then it makes some sense to have a ppa if you want firefox 4, otherwise you are stuck with 3.2? but the mozillateam hasn't released any packages or has changed names. maybe someone else has packaged firefox 4 for lucid
2011-05-01T07:19:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	should 3.2 load pages such as: http://novemberblue-.tumblr.com ? Because, to be honest, that's the only thing that I seriously want to fix. There are only a few features in ff4 that I would not want to lose.
2011-05-01T07:23:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	yeah the old version of firefox is fine
2011-05-01T07:23:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	Okay, I know this is a stupid question, but what would be the smoothest way to revert back to 3.2?
2011-05-01T07:26:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	you have to purge the ppa which involves uninstalling firefox, and removing the ppa from your apt-sources, and then reinstall firefox
2011-05-01T07:26:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	the ppa-purge script merely automates the removal and makes sure that nothing else installed by that ppa
2011-05-01T07:28:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	okay, where is the *right firefox to install? Because I feel like there is an overwhelming amount of packages to install for ff?
2011-05-01T07:29:00.000Z	escott	tortoise	there should be only one firefox listed in synaptic after you remove the mozillateam ppa
2011-05-01T07:36:00.000Z	tortoise	escott	I'm honestly not sure which one I'm supposed to be installing. There's one titled "firefox" but I believe it's even older than 3.2. There is also xul-ext-ubufox, I'm not sure what this is though?
