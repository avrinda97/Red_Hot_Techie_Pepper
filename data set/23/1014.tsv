2011-08-21T18:57:00.000Z	scarleo		Hi, I get a lot of this every time I use apt-get: 'x86_64' is not a valid architecture name: character `_' not allowed (only letters, digits and characters `-') Why? And is it serious? Can I get rid of it?
2011-08-21T18:58:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 what are you trying to install?
2011-08-21T18:59:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 if you are doing apt-get install such&such package on a 64 bit system,, I dont believe it has to be prefraced with x86_64
2011-08-21T19:00:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 and was that  sudo apt-get install kismet   ?
2011-08-21T19:01:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 and   what is the readout of uname -m
2011-08-21T19:10:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 ikonia With a bit more thinking I guess this is from trying to install glideapps with wrong architecture. Tride apt-get remove glideapps but it didn't find the package. How can I get rid of it?
2011-08-21T19:12:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 did you install t his glideapps via apt or compilied?
2011-08-21T19:13:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 via apt I think
2011-08-21T19:14:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 see if a sudo apt-get auotremove  glideapps   works
2011-08-21T19:15:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 E: Unable to locate package glideapps
2011-08-21T19:15:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 ok ,,
2011-08-21T19:15:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 And I did check the spelling, it's correct
2011-08-21T19:16:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	  ikonia   seems to have a better handle on this than I do so I will back off for him
2011-08-21T19:16:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 I guess the only problem is the lines in /var/lib/dpkg/status that still refers to glideapps  even though it's not there
2011-08-21T19:16:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 ok, thanks
2011-08-21T19:16:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 can you check  there to see if it can be removed
2011-08-21T19:17:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 So can I just edit that file manually?
2011-08-21T19:18:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	  if possible hunt down any reference to glideapps  to see if they can be removed,, I would t hink yes  should be able to open that with sudo gedit  or gksudo the file
2011-08-21T19:18:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 Ok, I'll try
2011-08-21T19:40:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 out of curiosity,, if you do  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade   does it stall at that error or complete the command?
2011-08-21T19:42:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	I'm trying to manually remove all glideapps entries now and it seems to work
2011-08-21T19:42:00.000Z	coz_	scarleo	 ah excellent
2011-08-21T19:45:00.000Z	scarleo	coz_	 ikonia Thanks for your help, manual editing did the trick
