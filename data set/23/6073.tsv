2008-03-24T18:25:00.000Z	Lamego		wubi is a real install, it is just installed over a ntfs partition
2008-03-24T18:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	It is a simulated partition inside a window folder,  That doe not count as a real install
2008-03-24T18:26:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	uh why not ? A "real" installation is not based on the media it is installed, eg, an LVM LV is not a real partition
2008-03-24T18:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	this is a support room... we need to drop the discussion.
2008-03-24T18:29:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	sorry, just had to correct your doubtfull opinnion on the answer
2008-03-24T18:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	I still feel wubi is worthless junk and I will never support it.
2008-03-24T18:33:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	is is not about lazyness, there maybe tecnhical concerns to use ntfs as a target installation, do not presume that you clearly understand all the desried scenarios for a Ubuntu install
2008-03-24T18:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	People that op for that type of installation need to be advised of the diferences between it and a real installation.
2008-03-24T18:37:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	sure, but calling something a crap is not a tecnhical explanation, if you dont care about explaining the drawbacks of using wubi versus a plain partition install, then you should refraing yourself from answering
2008-03-24T18:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	I will ask politely , again, to drop the wubi discussion.  this is not the place.
2008-03-24T18:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	you should create the #Ubuntu-wubi room and we can send those interested to you
2008-03-24T18:39:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	I will ask politely that you do not keep presenting your personal oppining and providing it as a tecnhical answer to a user's question
2008-03-25T14:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	agreed, his problem is not related to 64 bit
2008-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	question, if someone has installed with wubi and they need to run a livecd to make an edit is it possible
2008-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	I don't use wubi myself, but yes, you can loopback mount it
2008-03-25T14:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	HOw is that going to help a livecd access the files on a wubi install
2008-03-25T14:22:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	an wubi install is a file based FS that you can mount an access to, just as you do with a regular partition
2008-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	how do you mount a file based ubuntu install from a livecd
2008-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	uh ? mount -o loopack ?
2008-03-25T14:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	I would appreciate a link and full examples.  now that it is supported. we will need that..
2008-03-25T14:34:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide , plenty of instructions, including mounting the wubi image files
2008-03-25T14:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lamego	I was hoping for something more direct that just the wubi wiki
2008-03-25T14:37:00.000Z	Lamego	Jack_Sparrow	CTRL-F, "mounting the virtual disks"
