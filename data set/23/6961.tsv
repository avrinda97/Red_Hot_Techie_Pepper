2005-11-19T14:13:00.000Z	fletch33		can i ask a question to everyone even if you dont know the answer i want to make sure it isnt just me.  sometimes when i am typing my cursor just goes to some other place on the page and i cant figure it out. it really sucks because it will just jump up to another paragraph or something and it is driving me carzy. anyone else have this happen or know how to fix it?
2005-11-19T14:13:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	are you using a touchpad, by any chance?
2005-11-19T14:14:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	is that happening to you
2005-11-19T14:15:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	i wonder why it didnt happen on windows and if there is a fix
2005-11-19T14:16:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	I doubt there's a fix, and I know I got that problem under windows
2005-11-19T14:17:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	 i use the touchpad the whole time i am typing so constantly turning it off is out of the question even though i do have that little on and off button. however it never did that while in windows
2005-11-19T14:18:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	well, I don't know what to say then. Maybe try being a bit more careful, and do a search in synaptic for synaptics, and maybe change some options?
2005-11-19T14:18:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	 one more question have you been able to find an updated package to add all the touchpad features i loost when i switched from windows
2005-11-19T14:18:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	what types of features? I can do scrolling on the pad, and do a two or three fingered click for middle and right clicking
2005-11-19T14:18:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	i have been looking for a synaptic with no luck yet
2005-11-19T14:20:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	ooh i agree it does do all that but i think i had a sensitivity setting before and that would fix this but i am sure that is asking to much. i just switched to linux 4 days ago and i am very happy so far. i cant wait to actually start learning stuff
2005-11-19T14:20:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	I'm looking around to see if I can find anything
2005-11-19T14:20:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	cool thanks
2005-11-19T14:22:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	did you try using the program qsynaptics?
2005-11-19T14:23:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	no i didnt see that 1 but there are so many too lok at
2005-11-19T14:23:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	what is it under
2005-11-19T14:23:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	I don't know. I did a search for the term 'synaptics' and it came up with it as one of the packages
2005-11-19T14:23:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	 ok i will check that out thanksa lot
2005-11-19T14:24:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	hope that helps, and best of luck
2005-11-19T14:24:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	 i will let u kinow when i get a chance to look at it
2005-11-19T14:31:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	 that has an option for sensitivity. i dont know how well itworks yet but i turned it all the way down and i guess i will find out. thanks
2005-11-19T15:10:00.000Z	medgno	fletch33	those are what store your preference and settings in all the programs you use
2005-11-19T15:27:00.000Z	fletch33	medgno	 can u tell me how to keep from getting locks on folders i have brought into ubu like my music folder from windows. i have to go to properties and change the permission to write and then when i open the folder all the 200 items in there need the same thing. there has to be an easier way
