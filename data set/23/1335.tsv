2011-07-27T14:36:00.000Z	Weazel		hey guys, here's a question, how do i know which eth number is the network card i have ?
2011-07-27T14:36:00.000Z	Weazel		its not yet configured.
2011-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	ifconfig | grep "eth"?
2011-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	 thanks
2011-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	Typically it's 0
2011-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	 for some reason eth0 or eth1 doesn't work for me to get ping from the machine
2011-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	And, usually the configuration is summed up by "ifconfig eth0 up ; dhcpd eth0", just saying
2011-07-27T14:39:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	Err, dhcpcd, not dhcpd
2011-07-27T14:39:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	 its not set to dhcp its supposed to be static
2011-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	Well then, "ip addr add your_ip/your_netmask dev eth0 ; ip route add default via your_gateway"
2011-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	 thanks a lot i'll try that
2011-07-27T14:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	Make sure you run those as root
2011-07-27T14:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	i.e., "sudo -i" before trying
2011-07-27T14:42:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	 yea i will thanks :D
2011-07-27T14:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	You might want to stop networkmanager first so it doesn't interfere if you're on the desktop version of Ubuntu
2011-07-27T14:44:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	yea its already stopped, its only a terminal machine no giui
2011-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	Write back if it worked (or if it didn't) and we'll dig along further if necessary
2011-07-27T14:48:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	 thanks a lot man, the guy that is near the machine need to call me back in a few minutes coz i don't have direct access to it but i will write thanks again for the help
2011-07-27T14:51:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	No problem... Wish Ubuntu'd have netcfg :(
2011-07-27T15:36:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	Well, any results?
2011-07-27T15:36:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	just finished with him on th ephone right now, it worked like acharm thanks a lot it was eth 1 at the end
2011-07-27T15:37:00.000Z	theadmin	Weazel	:) GLaD I helped.
2011-07-27T15:37:00.000Z	Weazel	theadmin	 thanks to u I thought with portals :D
