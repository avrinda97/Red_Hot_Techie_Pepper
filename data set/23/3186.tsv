2008-06-29T12:09:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Yes, you can.  The easiest way is to configure Apache to listen on any IP address.
2008-06-29T12:10:00.000Z	adityag	erichammon1	but how they will have my ip address ?
2008-06-29T12:10:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	How will who have your IP address?
2008-06-29T12:11:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Have you run an Apache or other web site before?
2008-06-29T12:11:00.000Z	adityag	erichammon1	i am running apache and my website is ready
2008-06-29T12:13:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Has your ISP given you a public IP address which maps to your internal NAT IP address?
2008-06-29T12:15:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Then it sounds like your ISP may already be doing the port forwarding.  Your users would connect to the public IP address, it would get forwarded to the internal NAT IP address.
2008-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	adityag	erichammon1	it works exactly as u said
2008-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Are you on a home/business network with a router you control or is this a server hosted at an ISP where they take care of the router/NAT?
2008-06-29T12:19:00.000Z	adityag	erichammon1	server and everything is taken care by the ISP, there just one link that come right my cabinet
2008-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Can you ssh into your server from outside?

2008-06-29T12:23:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Are you currently at your cabinet, then?
2008-06-29T12:24:00.000Z	erichammon1	adityag	Yes, that IP address responds to ping, ssh, and there is a web server on port 80.
