2008-02-17T23:45:00.000Z	Sandking		i'm a little noob in case of linux (but not total I hope). I set my linux box yesterday and I got problem with WiFi. card is automatically detected, I see my network but when readying signal computer freezes and my keyboard lights begin to flash
2008-02-17T23:45:00.000Z	Sandking		it's a dlink wifi card
2008-02-17T23:46:00.000Z	Sandking		internal
2008-02-17T23:46:00.000Z	Sandking		damn ;/
2008-02-17T23:47:00.000Z	Sandking		could you give me a name of some popular and widely distributed wifi card that would work with ubuntu? I had problems with this card several years ago on all distros and I was happy that it run but nonetheless it freezes ;/
2008-02-17T23:47:00.000Z	Sandking		belkin is ok?
2008-02-17T23:47:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	HCL should a list
2008-02-17T23:48:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	HCL?
2008-02-17T23:49:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	hardware compatability list
2008-02-17T23:49:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	thx. I think I've seen it and it looks like belkin is my choice
2008-02-17T23:51:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	gdebi i think
2008-02-17T23:53:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	but i got folder  with executable. no package (ie Blender, though Blender is in pack rep)
2008-02-17T23:54:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	tarball?
2008-02-17T23:54:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	that needs compiling, if you don't know how to, don't ;p
2008-02-17T23:55:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	i downloaded a zipped folder which I extracted (Blender or Kerkythea) and inside are some files including exec which runs my app. so I already am able to run an application. I just don't know is there a way to install it to my system as it would be visible in menu
2008-02-17T23:56:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	a bit out of my scope... sorry.. it runs right out the folder?
2008-02-17T23:56:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	that's right. try blender app from blender.org
2008-02-17T23:57:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	on Mac I'd normally drag that folder into App folder but I don't know what's the way of handling apps in Ubuntu
2008-02-17T23:59:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	you can use a menu editor i guess
2008-02-18T00:00:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	and where's the place I should place an App ? or do I place it anywhere I want?
2008-02-18T00:01:00.000Z	faileas	Sandking	you can place it anwhere though i think there's a standard location. it won't show up in the menu unless you add it anyway
2008-02-18T00:02:00.000Z	Sandking	faileas	thx for all your help and time!
