2011-04-12T11:27:00.000Z	bullgard4		Where is the »kerneloops« service described? '~$ rgrep 'kerneloops' /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.38/Documentation/ 2>dev/null' does not produce any output.
2011-04-12T11:27:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	We ship 2.6.38 now?
2011-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	Who is "we"?
2011-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	The Ubuntu community.
2011-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	Yes, the Ubuntu community does.
2011-04-12T11:29:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	So where'd you find the 2.6.38 stuff? :-)
2011-04-12T11:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	I will answer your question after you have answered my question.
2011-04-12T11:32:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	There isn't a kerneloops service in stock kernels; it's a debugging thing, not really something you'd want turned on for production releases.
2011-04-12T11:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	I see. Thank you for explaining. I inadvertently put my question here in this channel but should have rather put it in #ubuntu+1. linux-source-2.6.38 is provided by Natty.
2011-06-14T02:41:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	Any chance it's running without bonding to your current terminal?
2011-06-14T02:42:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	Er, binding rather.
2011-06-14T02:43:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	dmidecode
2011-06-14T02:46:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	Rather obviously, yes. :-)
2011-06-20T12:20:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	How does it restart then?
2011-06-20T12:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	After this operation you can restart GNOME in the usual way. For example: sudo service gem stop && sudo service gdm restart.

2011-06-20T12:24:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	?
2011-06-20T12:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	?
2011-06-20T12:24:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	I didn't have a question, so why are you telling me this? :)
2011-06-20T12:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	I made a mistake.
2011-09-19T08:45:00.000Z	Corey	bullgard4	Probably something wrapped around dmidecode?
2011-09-19T08:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	Thank you for commenting.
2011-12-27T19:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	Corey	I Think that this was a hacker's attack.
