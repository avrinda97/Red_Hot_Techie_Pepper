2009-10-30T07:15:00.000Z	Andysalina5		that could be embarrassing
2009-10-30T07:16:00.000Z	Andysalina5		hmm
2009-10-30T07:16:00.000Z	Andysalina5		well the thing is
2009-10-30T07:16:00.000Z	Andysalina5		my internet maxes out at about 300 kb/s
2009-10-30T07:16:00.000Z	Andysalina5		so i have to order a copy of the disk
2009-10-30T07:17:00.000Z	Andysalina5		I dont have a computer that i can use to download all night.  My dad thinks all torrents are viruses due to a bad experience with windows
2009-10-30T07:18:00.000Z	Andysalina5		lol i know but my dad isnt very technology educated
2009-10-30T07:19:00.000Z	Andysalina5		so he uses macosx cause its super easy
2009-10-30T07:20:00.000Z	Andysalina5		So i want to buy an older P4 computer with about 2 gigs of ddr2 ram.  Its single core clocked at 3.4ghz.  Should i install ubu 9.10 or should i use xubuntu instead?
2009-10-30T07:21:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Andysalina5	I run Ubuntu on a Celeron 630mHz and 512mb de RAM. I think you should try Ubuntu.
2009-10-30T07:21:00.000Z	Andysalina5	KurtKraut	 is it fast?
2009-10-30T07:22:00.000Z	Andysalina5		im getting the computer for approx 99$
2009-10-30T07:22:00.000Z	Andysalina5		its a steal
2009-10-30T07:22:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Andysalina5	no, but it is not slow either. I can use OpenOffice perfectly. Only intensive flash websites are noticeably slow.
2009-10-30T07:23:00.000Z	Andysalina5		ic KurtKraut.  Why dont you try xubuntu?
2009-10-30T07:24:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Andysalina5	because Xubuntu wouldn't interfere in the worst performance scenario: intensive flash websites.
2009-10-30T07:24:00.000Z	Andysalina5		I understand KurtKraut
2009-10-30T07:24:00.000Z	Andysalina5		How much for your box KurtKraut?
2009-10-30T07:25:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Andysalina5	how much I paid for it? 500 USD (in Brazil). It is an Eee PC.
2009-10-30T07:25:00.000Z	Andysalina5		wow
2009-10-30T07:25:00.000Z	Andysalina5		thats a lot of cash for a celeron.  How much do you want for it?
2009-10-30T07:26:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Andysalina5	eletronics are expensive in latin America, mainly in Brazil.
