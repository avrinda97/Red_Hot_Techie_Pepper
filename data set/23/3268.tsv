2008-05-30T23:57:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		Umm
2008-05-30T23:58:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		if there is no dirvers
2008-05-30T23:58:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		anyone know where I can buy Modems for Linux?
2008-05-30T23:58:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		lol I called my ISP and they said they had no idea what one was or where to get them
2008-05-30T23:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	what kind of modems?
2008-05-30T23:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	a modem for what, though?
2008-05-30T23:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	oh
2008-05-30T23:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	you might be able to buy one in 1993
2008-05-30T23:59:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	gordonjcp	lol... Where can I get ollddd ones then?
2008-05-30T23:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	ebay, possibly
2008-05-31T00:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	I suspect that pretty much any PCI modem will be a software modem
2008-05-31T00:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	got any serial ports?
2008-05-31T00:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	does anyone even do dialup internet access any more?
2008-05-31T00:01:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	gordonjcp	Yes, a lot of ISP's still have Dial-UP. :)
2008-05-31T00:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	hmm
2008-05-31T00:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	I can't even remember the last time I used a dialup modem, it was at least five years ago
2008-05-31T00:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	where are you?
2008-05-31T00:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	ah, bit far then - I've got a bunch of old external modems in a box up the loft
2008-05-31T00:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	but you'd need to come to Scotland for them, which is probably not really worth it
2008-06-27T02:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	that would be the password you normally use to log in with ;-)
2008-06-27T02:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	sftp and scp are the *only* sane way to move files to remote servers ;-)
2008-06-27T02:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	same as you normally log in with
2008-06-27T03:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Gaming4JC	you use the username and password you'd use to log into the Linux machine
