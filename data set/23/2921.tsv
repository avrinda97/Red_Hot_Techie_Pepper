2008-09-30T02:25:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	I've installed to a HDD before that's not inside of the PC. IT's really screwy.
2008-09-30T02:25:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	how so?
2008-09-30T02:26:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	well it depends on how your BIOS order is set. Linux sees drive order different than windows. Are you trying to dual boot w/ an external?
2008-09-30T02:27:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	i'm trying to install ubuntu to an external hard drive for a friend, so he can take it home and use it
2008-09-30T02:27:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	oh. well it compiles for the hardware. So if your hardware isn't the same as his, it won't work I think. Same w/ Windows.
2008-09-30T02:27:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	yeah, i was thinking that
2008-09-30T02:28:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	but can it not detect hardware changes, and use the appropriate drivers?
2008-09-30T02:29:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	but he can install it himself on that HDD, but if he has Windows, good luck. Sometimes you'll have to change GRUB to set the USB as hda instead of hdb or have it hd0 depending on something. It's been a month since I did it. It took us forever to get it to work because when we installed it, the USB drive was read as hda in Linux and not hdb. Really difficult since the Windows drive was the main one.
2008-09-30T02:29:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	no he can't. there's some issues
2008-09-30T02:29:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	his windows install is corrupted
2008-09-30T02:29:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	the LiveCD has a boatload of drivers, the Ubuntu you install probably does not
2008-09-30T02:30:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	you can just boot to the CD, it won't even touch Windows.
2008-09-30T02:30:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	i know.
2008-09-30T02:30:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	why does he want Ubuntu? There might be other solutions here.
2008-09-30T02:31:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	largely from watching me use it, i think
2008-09-30T02:31:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	ok, so he wants it as his main OS, and probably doesn't wanna reformat the Windows partition?
2008-09-30T02:32:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	i've already partitioned the drive
2008-09-30T02:32:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	ah ok. So what IS the friend wanting? Since Windows doesn't boot, I feel like putting Ubuntu on a USB HDD probably isn't the only reason.
2008-09-30T02:32:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	the plan is to back up some stuff while booted to linux, and kill the partition on the old drive. he has a worm
2008-09-30T02:33:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	he brought me the hard drive to try to install ubuntu for him, since the boot & live cds weren't working for him
2008-09-30T02:33:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	brought me his new one, that is
2008-09-30T02:34:00.000Z	kevin---	tanath	ah! Well you can use Ubuntu to repartition the drive that Windows is installed on and you can install Ubuntu into. But the LiveCD's don't work which doesn't make sense. That means that Ubuntu probably won't work. I was gonna suggest just booting from a LiveCD and moving the data onto the external HDD or repartitioning the main drive and installing Ubuntu there and then pulling the data into Ubuntu and having it the
2008-09-30T02:35:00.000Z	tanath	kevin---	his old drive with corrupted windows is still at home. he brought me a newer (and bigger) one, which i've split into ext3 & fat32
