2007-05-20T14:16:00.000Z	Fezzler		Can Ubuntu/Linux handle an IDE hard drive bigger than 137 gig?  I just installed a slave 200 gig 2nd HD and before I format it I'm thinking through best approach.
2007-05-20T14:16:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	yes, the only limit is your bios (if it has one)
2007-05-20T14:17:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	how old is your motherboard ?
2007-05-20T14:19:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	there should be no bios problem on a board from 01
2007-05-20T14:20:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	i am sure you will have no problems
2007-05-20T14:20:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	your only consideration now is filesystem
2007-05-20T14:20:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	ips: Yes, file system and is it desirable to have one big 200gig drive vs formating as two 100 gig
2007-05-20T14:22:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	 ips: ANy thoughts?  Again, use, file backup/server, media server, Ubuntu toy, on WORKGROUP with Vista HP and iMacG5 boxes.
2007-05-20T14:22:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	partitions on your disk have very little gain on *nix filesystems, with the exception of a few specialised situations, therefore one drive formatted with Ext3 should do you fine
2007-05-20T14:22:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	Your last post was too technical for me to understand.
2007-05-20T14:23:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	in a nutshell, format your drive using "ext3" and tell the formatting tool to use the whole drive
2007-05-20T14:23:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	Ubuntu is on a 20 gig boot HD
2007-05-20T14:24:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	The slave 200 gig is all for server storage
2007-05-20T14:24:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	that seems fine to me
2007-05-20T14:25:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	is EXT something I use via GNOME?
2007-05-20T14:26:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	Ext3 is a filesystem , like FAT32 or NTFS in windows
2007-05-20T14:27:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	so the Ext3 will play well with the iMacG5 and Vista HP files that will go to the Ubuntu server via samba?
2007-05-20T14:28:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	i cannot coment on macs, but on windows and linux samba automagically allows you to read and write to ext3 is the best explanation i can give without getting too technical
2007-05-20T14:29:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	sambas job is to act as a "buffer" between filesystems, its not worth knowing the details (unless you want too) its better to just understand that it will work
2007-05-20T14:31:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	i am correct in saying the new drive is IDE not SATA?
2007-05-20T14:31:00.000Z	Fezzler	HOT	Brand new Maxtor that can be ATA or IDE
2007-05-20T14:32:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	chances are the new drive is HDB (hard disk B) so fdisk should show it as that
2007-05-20T14:32:00.000Z	HOT	Fezzler	stefg is way ahead of me, follow his directions
