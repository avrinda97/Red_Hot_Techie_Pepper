2008-06-04T11:07:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. How can I tell an app (kdm in this case) to use only as much pixels as X is currently displaying? When the mouse pointer now reaches the edge of the visible 1280x1024 area the content "scrolls", it seems to be at least 1600x1***. Any idea?
2008-06-04T11:08:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 have you messed with /etc/X11/xorg.conf you should try doing that if you haven't.... or googling to find example configs of that same file
2008-06-04T11:27:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	xorg.conf: http://paste.ubuntu.com/16781/
2008-06-04T11:34:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 ya still there?
2008-06-04T11:35:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	y
2008-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 was that your xorg.conf?
2008-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	Yes.
2008-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 do you have hardy? gutsy?
2008-06-04T11:37:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	Hardy
2008-06-04T11:38:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	A fresh install. I only used the system settings dialog once to set resolution to 1280x1024, wich created all these mode lines in xorg.conf
2008-06-04T11:39:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 here's my xorg.conf.... you should take note of the mode lines & substitute with the rezes allowed by your monitor/graphics card:  http://pastebin.ca/1038467
2008-06-04T11:39:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 you should be able to use 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg' like it suggests in that file, but i don't do that personally
2008-06-04T11:40:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 and then hit CTRL+ALT+Backspace
2008-06-04T11:51:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	I ran `dpkg-reconfigure x...`. Now xorg.conf is "empty" again. But now X starts with a much too high resolution (1600x1***). How can I set it to fixed 1280x1024@85?
2008-06-04T12:08:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 like i said, i'd rather not use dpkg-reconfigure.... just edit the modelines to look like the xorg.conf i showed you
2008-06-04T12:08:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	also, make sure you " aptitude install nvidia-glx-new " instead of just the older nvidia-glx
2008-06-04T12:09:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	"nvidia-glx-new" is already installed.
2008-06-04T12:10:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 then use the pastebin i sent you as an example of what your modelines should really look like... i've never seen an xorg.conf with refresh rate, the @85 part, afterward
2008-06-04T12:13:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	I can't resolve pastebin.ca currently. (wt*?)
2008-06-04T12:14:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 try one more time... http://pastebin.ca/1038467
2008-06-04T12:15:00.000Z	vlt	grndslm	Hmmm, I think I have to care for that resolving issue first :(   bind9 on Debian. From two separate networks! From a third one it works. ...
2008-06-04T12:17:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 you ever heard of opendns??  that's what i use
2008-06-04T12:17:00.000Z	grndslm	vlt	 once ever few weeks i'll have to refresh their servers cache for them by going to their support page.... it's pretty nice
