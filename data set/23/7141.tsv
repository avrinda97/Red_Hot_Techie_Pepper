2005-10-12T16:52:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	how can i make a bootable ubuntu cd
2005-10-12T16:53:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	just burn the iso you find on ubuntu.com and it's bootable
2005-10-12T16:53:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	it won't
2005-10-12T16:53:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	that's my problem
2005-10-12T16:54:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	the cd images are not zips but isos
2005-10-12T16:58:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	nero 6
2005-10-12T16:58:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	winzip thinks it's being helpful. sometimes you want to look inside the iso to see what's on the cd
2005-10-12T16:58:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	so tell nero to burn it as an image. otherwise you'll end up with a cd with an iso file inside it
2005-10-12T16:58:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	oh my goodness
2005-10-12T16:59:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	i wasted a good cd there
2005-10-12T16:59:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	we always need coasters, right? i have a windows server 2003 cd as a coaster right here :)
2005-10-12T05:00:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	so when i open nero
2005-10-12T05:00:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	i'll go to "Disc Image or Save Project"
2005-10-12T05:01:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	i have never seen nero but something like "burn image" should be somewhere there
2005-10-12T05:01:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	i nedd to spend another 3 hours to download the file
2005-10-12T05:02:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	you have broken the iso?
2005-10-12T05:02:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	after using winrar, i permanently deleted it from my hard drive
2005-10-12T05:02:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	i tot, it was a zip file 'cause it inherits the icon of winrar
2005-10-12T05:35:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	that's my machine exactly, except i have a duron CPU
2005-10-12T05:35:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	i see, and a built in audio, lan and sound card
2005-10-12T05:35:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	i'm dreaming of more RAM but it does work quite well
2005-10-12T05:36:00.000Z	topyli	clark070	dunno, i disabled those the day i bought the motherboard and installed real cards
2005-10-12T05:39:00.000Z	clark070	topyli	TNX
