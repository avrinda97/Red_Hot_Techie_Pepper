2012-05-05T02:19:00.000Z	Restringere		but it sucks, I regret upgrading should have stuck with 2.8 rc 1, the performance lags terribly and is jittery
2012-05-05T02:20:00.000Z	Restringere		I have a good setup - dual core 2.2ghz, 2 gigs of ddr2 ram, Nvidia 8400M GS - and GIMP 2.8 was slow slow slow jittery and horrible
2012-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	Restringere		I dont know why 12.10 running XFCE is so jittery
2012-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	Restringere		Any tips?
2012-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	Restringere		And there is strange load and lag
2012-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	Restringere		is this load average ok 0.81, 0.77, 0.79
2012-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	Restringere		I dont know why its acting so strange
2012-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	Restringere		Is there a way to increase performance other than the typical settings?
2012-05-05T02:24:00.000Z	Restringere		I love the base
2012-05-05T02:25:00.000Z	modernbob	Restringere	I am running gimp with a 560ti geforce on ubuntu 12.04 and its really fast. I do a lot of web design and use gimp quite a bit..
