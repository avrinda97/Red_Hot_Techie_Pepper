2004-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	m_tthew		I burnt an earlier i386 sounder image in DiskUtility without trouble
2004-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	m_tthew		What version of OSX?
2004-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	Me too.
2004-09-26T15:28:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	10.3.5
2004-09-26T15:31:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	thanks, I think that is what I have here. I will try to replicate
2004-09-26T15:45:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	I've got about 40min left on this d/l, then I'll try it here
2004-09-26T15:46:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	Alright. But I guess it's definitely not working on 10.3.5 :(
2004-09-27T16:25:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	you managed to burn the image with DiskUtility after all?
2004-09-27T16:25:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	No, I used cdrecord.
2004-09-27T16:26:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	I'll file a radar bug later, let's see what Apple thinks ;)
2004-09-27T16:26:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	heh
2004-09-27T16:26:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	And I'm planning to re-rip the CD once I'm done installing and test that.
2004-09-27T16:27:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	I'm still waiting on the iso, unm mirror has slowed a bit :)
2004-09-27T06:24:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	does warty share a drive with OSX on that machine? (if so, how did that go?)
2004-09-27T06:26:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	I originally had 2 installations of OS X on that drive, one partition for each. Deleted one of them during the manual partition step and created a root filesystem (ext3), a swap partition and a new world boot loader partition on the freed space. That was all.
2004-09-27T06:26:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	thanks
2004-09-27T06:27:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	yeah, nice, isn't it?
2004-09-27T07:14:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	ping
2004-09-27T07:14:00.000Z	xTina	m_tthew	pong?
2004-09-27T07:15:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	powerpc image crashes disk utility here, too, soon as I load it.
2004-09-27T07:15:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	yeah, completely tanks as soon as I load the iso
2004-09-27T09:51:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	night
2004-09-27T09:52:00.000Z	m_tthew	xTina	hope you mentioned 'ubuntu' in your bug report w/ apple :)
