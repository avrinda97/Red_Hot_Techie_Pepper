2008-04-17T20:50:00.000Z	SnakeArt		Anyone knows how to get a missing file in /dev/input/ ?
2008-04-17T20:50:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	restart udeb
2008-04-17T20:51:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	maybe it's silly, but how to do that? Reset the system? I've already did it, but nothing changed. I still have no wacom device in /dev/input/ .
2008-04-17T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	what device are you expecting in /dev/input
2008-04-17T20:53:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	I'm trying to make working Wacom Bamboo One in my Gutsy. I need to have /dev/input/wacom .
2008-04-17T20:54:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	the output of dmesg for detecting the wacom device

2008-04-17T20:57:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	what version of ubuntu are you running ?
2008-04-17T20:58:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	Gutsy Gibbon 7.10 2.6.22-14-generic on AMD64
2008-04-17T20:58:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	ok, so the kernel sees the device, now check the udev rules
2008-04-17T20:58:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	thats a good start though
2008-04-17T20:59:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	also check if the wacom modeul is loaded witih lsmod
2008-04-17T21:01:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	I've already did it yesterday when I was talking with genii here at channel. But You can look at it: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63540/
2008-04-17T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	apologies, I have to leave now
2008-04-17T21:19:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	Are You there?
2008-04-18T00:10:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	:)
2008-04-18T00:13:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	was this your wacom issue ?
2008-04-18T00:15:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	Nice to meet You again. I made all the steps in linux-wacom-project archive, butmy Bamboo One doesn't seem to work. I haven't got a file called wacom in my /dev/input/ . I've read on ubuntu forums that many users has the same problem.
2008-04-18T00:17:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	Have You got any new ideas since our last chat?
2008-04-18T00:18:00.000Z	ikonia	SnakeArt	did you check the kernel module was loaded ok
2008-04-18T00:19:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	Yes. I've done everything correctly. I even tried to swap wacom.ko created during compilation of linux-wacom-project archive with the original one, but nothing changed.
2008-04-18T00:20:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	I've read on one of polish ubuntu forums that it might be a fault of bug in kernel of 7.10, which is amazingly too old for Bamboo tablets.
2008-04-18T00:26:00.000Z	SnakeArt	ikonia	Do You know any irc channel where I could ask for solve of my problem?
