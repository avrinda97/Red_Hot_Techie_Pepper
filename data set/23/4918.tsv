2007-06-22T16:25:00.000Z	Cooner750		 Anyone have any ideas?
2007-06-22T16:25:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	have you edited a config file before?
2007-06-22T16:26:00.000Z	Cooner750	greg_g	What do you mean by that? Have I ever done it, or have I done it on this machine?
2007-06-22T16:26:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	I'm asking because that is what you can do to fix this, just wondering what all to tell you
2007-06-22T16:26:00.000Z	Cooner750	greg_g	In that case, I've edited many config files on my non-GUI Linux server ;)
2007-06-22T16:27:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	ok then, it is as simple as editing your xorg.conf file most likely
2007-06-22T16:27:00.000Z	Cooner750	greg_g	/etc/x11/xorg.conf I believe?
2007-06-22T16:27:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	correct (only the x is X )
2007-06-22T16:28:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	just find the section that lists all of the resolutions for your monitor, should be near the end, and fairly obvious
2007-06-22T16:28:00.000Z	Cooner750		Yep I see it
2007-06-22T16:29:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	if you want, you can pastebin your xorg.conf, I can edit it and pastebin it back to you
2007-06-22T16:29:00.000Z	greg_g		!pastebin
2007-06-22T16:29:00.000Z	Cooner750		brb
2007-06-22T16:29:00.000Z	Cooner750		Hm
2007-06-22T16:29:00.000Z	Cooner750		what's the best way to restart X, restarting the machine, or CTRL+ALT+Backspace ?
2007-06-22T16:33:00.000Z	Cooner750		Well that worked.
2007-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	Cooner750		It went straight to 1280x1024 automagically
2007-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	right on
2007-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	Cooner750		One little problem though
2007-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	greg_g		??
2007-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	Cooner750		Text looks a little too sharp
2007-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	Cooner750		Not a big deal
2007-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	greg_g	Cooner750	don't know about that
