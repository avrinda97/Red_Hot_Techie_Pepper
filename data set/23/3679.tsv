2008-02-23T01:39:00.000Z	sdsheeks		Howdy all.  Is there a way to rerun the xorg configuration now that I have hooked up my external LCD monitor to my laptop?
2008-02-23T01:40:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	you mean something like "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"?
2008-02-23T01:41:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	I don't know.  Would that detect my external monitor?
2008-02-23T01:41:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	btw: if your graphics driver supports it, xrandr is just great for setting up external displays
2008-02-23T01:41:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	it is an integrated nvidia 7 series
2008-02-23T01:41:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	do you use the proprietary driver?
2008-02-23T01:41:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	i have backed up my xorg.conf and i'll try the command you gave
2008-02-23T01:42:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	yes
2008-02-23T01:42:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	you could try nvidia-settings
2008-02-23T01:42:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	okay nvidia-settings is just showing 1 screen..shouldn't I have two?
2008-02-23T01:42:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	i'm an old gentoo user so config files don't care me...so if you have any ideas let me know :)

2008-02-23T01:44:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	afaik dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg should recognize all monitors
2008-02-23T01:44:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	okay thanks i'll give that a try
2008-02-23T01:44:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	but i haven't tried it myself
2008-02-23T01:45:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	okay nvidia-settings see is and wants to know if I want - seperate x screen or twinview
2008-02-23T01:45:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	wouldn't i want seperate x screen?
2008-02-23T01:46:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	with twinview the desktop is extended and you can move windows between the screens
2008-02-23T01:48:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	just plugging in the screen and rebooting doesn't help?
2008-02-23T01:51:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	what was the command again to reconfigure xserver?
2008-02-23T02:09:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	works awesome after a reboot
2008-02-23T02:09:00.000Z	sdsheeks	fliegenderfrosch	i'm now in 1280x1024 on a seperate x screen thanks guys
2008-02-23T02:09:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	sdsheeks	when only one screen is used at a time, rebooting is usually enough
