2008-12-23T08:37:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	does it fade out smoothly, or just cut out?
2008-12-23T08:37:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	smoothly
2008-12-23T08:38:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	ok, go to system, preferences, sound
2008-12-23T08:38:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	there
2008-12-23T08:39:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	what sound driver are you running under?
2008-12-23T08:39:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	all autodetect except sound capture is alsa and device is Alsa PCM
2008-12-23T08:39:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	fresh install of 8.10 so whatever it comes with :)
2008-12-23T08:40:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	I had massive sound troubles too, and to get mine working, I had to go through OSS drivers, and then play with alsamixer at the command line to get any sound at all...but now I have full 7.1
2008-12-23T08:41:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	you suggest I change them to oss from autodetect?  Are you running oss 4?
2008-12-23T08:41:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	So, you could try using alsamixer -c 0 at the command line...you may have to change the number from 0 if you have more than one sound card
2008-12-23T08:41:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	its a laptop with only one soundcard
2008-12-23T08:42:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	if you are getting sound now, try leaving them and messing with what you can find in alsamixer...if that doesn't work, cycle through the different sound driver options, and repeat messing with alsamixer (don't bother with the drivers that give you no sound at all)
2008-12-23T08:42:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	since it is a lappy, -c 0 should get the card
2008-12-23T08:46:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	for sound playback I have a bunch of options:  autodetect, HDA intel STAC92xx Analog (alsa), HDA intel STAC92xx Analog (oss), HDA intel STAC92xx Analog (oss) [another one], ALSA - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture,  OSS Open Sound System, PulseAudio Sound Driver.
2008-12-23T08:48:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	for sound playback I have a bunch of options:  autodetect, HDA intel STAC92xx Analog (alsa), HDA intel STAC92xx Analog (oss), HDA intel STAC92xx Analog (oss) [another one], ALSA - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture,  OSS Open Sound System, PulseAudio Sound Driver.  Which one would you suggest?
2008-12-23T08:49:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	ok, so what I did was try each of my options, like the ones you listed, and hit the test button. Then, for each of those that gave me any sound at all, I went into alsamixer and turned each setting to max, and then to 0 while I had music playing. Evaetually, I found a set of sliders that controlled my sound (not pcm I think)
2008-12-23T08:50:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	alsa is best (I think), followed by oss, and then pulse...so that is the order I would try them in
2008-12-23T08:50:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	okay so I have to mix and match alsamixer with the gnome sound preference thing?
2008-12-23T08:50:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	alsamixer is (i think) actually the backend to the gnome sound gui
2008-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	I think that is what alsa is supposed to be, but unfortunately, nothing seems to work very well
2008-12-23T08:54:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	I lost my sound when I upgraded my kernal recently, as apt suggested, so I had to roll bacl
2008-12-23T08:55:00.000Z	deten	cdeszaq2	it worked fine in 7.04 :) my first try at ubuntu
2008-12-23T08:55:00.000Z	cdeszaq2	deten	yeah, same here...and now it's a pain
