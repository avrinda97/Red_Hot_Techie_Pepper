2007-03-05T10:57:00.000Z	nootrope		if it's not there, it's probably dead
2007-03-05T10:58:00.000Z	techie_	nootrope	I had erased vlc but will reinstall and try it.
2007-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	you can also try a demuxer
2007-03-05T11:00:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	it allows you to rip the video and audio separately
2007-03-05T11:00:00.000Z	techie_	nootrope	it sounds good.
2007-03-05T11:01:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	it's useful for all sorts of cool remix exercises. :)
2007-03-05T11:01:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	nope
2007-03-05T11:03:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	don't know anything about it. sorry. :\
2007-03-05T11:04:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	installation software for linux?
2007-03-05T11:05:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	yeah, but it was written for what OS? probably Windows
2007-03-05T11:06:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	then it won't do you any good in linux.
2007-03-05T11:06:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	add to that the whole USB mess and you're gonna have a hard time finding a way for that thing to get recognized
2007-03-05T11:07:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	use an audio cable to your soundboard's mic or line-in
2007-03-05T11:08:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	what recording software you using on the uuntu end?
2007-03-05T11:09:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	try Ardour
2007-03-05T11:09:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	i thik so. you'll need Jack, too, if you want to use audio from one app to plug into another
2007-03-05T11:10:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	but if all you're doing is recording this as a one-off thing, setting up Ardour isn't worth while the trouble.
2007-03-05T11:11:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	just use Sound Recorder
2007-03-05T11:13:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	Sound recorder will let you do that. just set the input to Line-in or Mic or Aux or whatever
2007-03-05T11:15:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	OH! your recorder only has a USB, no headphone jack?
2007-03-05T11:15:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	sorry. i was barking up the wrong tree!! :|
2007-03-05T11:16:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	no removable memory?
2007-03-05T11:17:00.000Z	nootrope	techie_	but the recorder doesn't have a removable memory like flash memory, right?
