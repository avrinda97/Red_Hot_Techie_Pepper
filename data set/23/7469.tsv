2007-01-28T15:52:00.000Z	Robbster		hi all. I've just installed edgy on my pc and x doesn't start. my LCD says 'input not supported'
2007-01-28T15:53:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	probably it is set to a refresh rate out of range for the monitor
2007-01-28T15:54:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	i takeit the live cd worked?
2007-01-28T15:54:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	yes, set the modelines to a sensible default
2007-01-28T15:55:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	or find out what your monitor supports and set to that.. the resolution is probably out of range not the refresh rate sorry
2007-01-28T15:56:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	yes, if it's an LCD then I am pretty sure that setting is mostly meaningless
2007-01-28T15:56:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	the refresh rate
2007-01-28T15:56:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	the default resolution is set to 1280x1024?
2007-01-28T15:57:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	do you have a second monitor at all you can plug in to diagnose the problem?
2007-01-28T15:58:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	what file system did you choose for the / filesystem?
2007-01-28T15:58:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	in that case (i really hate to suggest it) you can boot to windows and mount the ext filesystem to edit the files if you have win installed
2007-01-28T15:59:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	but lets leave that one for a while
2007-01-28T15:59:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	how? if your screen doesnt come on?
2007-01-28T15:59:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	ok
2007-01-28T15:59:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	do you have the nvidia driver installed?
2007-01-28T16:00:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	if xorg says nv then your not using the proprietry driver
2007-01-28T16:01:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	why are you talking in html?
2007-01-28T16:01:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	turn off the html output..
2007-01-28T16:04:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	sorry i don't know much about installing nvidia drivers.. if you ahve it properly installed then you should be ableto change the "nv" to "nvidia" in xorg.conf to make it work
2007-01-28T16:05:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	the nvidia driver should handle it better.. have you tried the nvidia driver? (NOT "nv"
2007-01-28T16:05:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	try startx on its own
2007-01-28T16:06:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	gdm might mess up if there are problems
2007-01-28T16:06:00.000Z	variant	Robbster	and startx gives more informative output
