2007-09-28T14:54:00.000Z	thinman1189		Hi everyone. I recently used norton ghost to ghost my hard drive over to a new one for space reasons. I had a windows and ubuntu installed on my drive. Now when I start the computer up with the new drive instead of starting grub it just says GRUB over and over again. Any ideas on how to fix it? I'm open to either deleting ubuntu and reinstalling it but I need to keep Windows in tact because of how annoying it is to reinstall the progr
2007-09-28T14:56:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	you could try the RecoveringGrub... instructions from the factoid:
2007-09-28T14:56:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: thanks i'll look into that
2007-09-28T15:01:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: if i did this to recover grub would switching to 7.10 when it comes out mess it up again? I plan on installing 7.10 not doing an update.
2007-09-28T15:02:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	if you do a fresh install, grub will be reinstalled, too, so there shouldn't be a problem afterwards.
2007-09-28T15:03:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: so if i just used a live cd to reinstall ubuntu over the current ubuntu then everything should just fix itself?
2007-09-28T15:04:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	that's what I would expect
2007-09-28T15:04:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: ok thanks i'll try that then
2007-09-28T15:08:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: in the partition menu for installing, how do i select to install over my current ubuntu?
2007-09-28T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	go to manual partitioning. Make sure you know which partition is which. Then it'll let you pick the install partitions, and it will format them for you.
2007-09-28T15:11:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: do i select anything for the current swap space or just the ext3 partition?
2007-09-28T15:11:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	if you're now in manual partitioning mode, you have to make everything explicit
2007-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: i'm in the manual partitioning mode. i want to keep my windows intact but want to only toast ubuntu and reinstall it so that grub will work. there's an ntfs, ext3 and swap partitions. do i have to select both the ext3 and the swap or just the ext3?
2007-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	both ext3 and swap
2007-09-28T15:15:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: it won't let me select the swap partition but it will let me delete it, there is no data in it should i?
2007-09-28T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	if it won't let you select it, the installer system is probably using it. Just leave it alone, do the installation and check later that it's using swap.
2007-09-28T15:18:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: when i select the etx3 partition and click forward it says : No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu.
2007-09-28T15:19:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	this means you have to give it a mount point, and that mount point should be '/' (not the quotes, just the slash)
2007-09-28T15:19:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: how do i set that?
2007-09-28T15:22:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: how do i set it to that?
2007-09-28T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	I don't know these dialogs by heart. You'll have to find out for yourself. Try right-clicking the entry for your ext3 partition.
2007-09-28T15:26:00.000Z	thinman1189	soundray	: found it. i don't think it's overwriting the swap but i could probably just delete it later, it is only 1/50 the space of the drive. if this works and i don't need to come back, thanks in advance for the help.
2007-09-28T15:26:00.000Z	soundray	thinman1189	good luck
