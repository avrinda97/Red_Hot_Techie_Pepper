2009-05-13T08:48:00.000Z	Frem_		Question: Where does cups-pdf save generated PDFs?
2009-05-13T08:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	in ~/PDF
2009-05-13T08:49:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	It's not there.
2009-05-13T08:50:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	I've seen two different cups-pdf on my system.. or 2 different implementations of it.. one went into the directory mentioned and the other allows you to set the name and save location
2009-05-13T08:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	if your's is the latter then try to create the pdf again and look closer to the pdf print option box
2009-05-13T08:51:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	I've found the one that lets you select the directory. When printing from a flashpaper document, it's using the other one.
2009-05-13T08:52:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	/home/<login name>/PDF and there's nothing there?
2009-05-13T08:54:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	yes
2009-05-13T08:55:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	weird.. I don't have an answer for that one.
2009-05-13T08:56:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	is there some random system-wide place it could be dumping these things?
2009-05-13T08:56:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	you could "sudo updatedb" then "locate *.pdf" to find it..
2009-05-13T08:57:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	That is an excellent idea.
2009-05-13T09:00:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	where did you find it?
2009-05-13T09:01:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	Well, I found every single PDF on my system, on all partitions. still sorting through it.
2009-05-13T09:01:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	Is there a way to restrict it to stuff created today
2009-05-13T09:02:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	:)  there is but I don't know how
2009-05-13T09:02:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	Ok, thanks. :-) My man skills obviously need honing.
2009-05-13T09:03:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	grep? awk? something like that or a combo.. my skills there are lacking as well
2009-05-13T09:05:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	Yeah, I don't think it's actually dumping PDFs anywhere. I printed like 15 test pages, so they should have showed up in the locate result.
2009-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	look at it's setup in http://localhost:631 and see if there is something that doesn't look right.
2009-05-13T09:08:00.000Z	Frem_	scunizi	It says all the test pages were printed, and shows the sizes and such
2009-05-13T09:09:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	you could "locate *.pdf > foundpdf.txt" then import into a spreadsheet and sort by date
2009-05-13T09:10:00.000Z	scunizi	Frem_	or .. locate *.pdf > ~/Desktop/foundpdf.txt
