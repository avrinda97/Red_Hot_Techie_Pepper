2008-06-16T09:30:00.000Z	user__		i've got no 1024x768 resolution - what should i do to get that resolution?
2008-06-16T09:31:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	do u have a restricted driver on?
2008-06-16T09:32:00.000Z	user__		i think not - i've installed ubuntu yesterday...
2008-06-16T09:32:00.000Z	user__		how do i know what driver i have?
2008-06-16T09:33:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	hmmm... i had trouble with a restricted driver yesterday.... did u try to change ur resolution?
2008-06-16T09:33:00.000Z	user__		yes no 1024 -- just 1100 1200 resolution
2008-06-16T09:35:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	oh boy.... i know there are ways to do it.... u'll need to reset the xserver-xorg... thats what i did
2008-06-16T09:35:00.000Z	user__		how do i do that?
2008-06-16T09:35:00.000Z	user__		if i install proprietary drivers will it fix this?
2008-06-16T09:35:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	let me check
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	user__		-e  ATI Technologies Linux Driver Installer/Packager
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	user__		-e ==================================================
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	user__		./ati-installer.sh: 165: Syntax error: Bad substitution
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	user__		 
2008-06-16T09:38:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg thats what i used
2008-06-16T09:38:00.000Z	user__	lmessenger	 i'll try it
2008-06-16T09:39:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	this may or may not work... idk what exactly it will do
2008-06-16T09:41:00.000Z	user__	lmessenger	 ok now i have to reboot right?
2008-06-16T09:43:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	ctrl + alt + backspace will do just fine.... it may or may not detect the right driver... so u may have to choose one
2008-06-16T09:44:00.000Z	user__	lmessenger	 it didn't work - any other ideeas?
2008-06-16T09:45:00.000Z	lmessenger	user__	i'm out srry... u should go ask someone else... :)
