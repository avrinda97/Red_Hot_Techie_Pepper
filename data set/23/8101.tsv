2005-01-20T11:14:00.000Z	new-ubuntu		Hi all I have a quick question about trying to install Ubuntu for the first time, WinXP machine won't boot from CD even after setting BIOS and recording CD twice from two different sources... any ideas please? Thanks
2005-01-20T11:15:00.000Z	new-ubuntu		...liveCD worked fine though
2005-01-20T11:17:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	how are you burning the iso? and have you tried the cds on another comp just to make sure they are ok?
2005-01-20T11:19:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	try using nero proper, not startsmart, and going selecting the "burn image" option, rather than using startsmart
2005-01-20T11:20:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	to have startsmart, you must have the real nero ;)
2005-01-20T11:20:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	so it's another program probably on the computer, I use mac and helping a friend to de-xp
2005-01-20T11:20:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	its just called "nero burning rom" in the menu iirc
2005-01-20T11:21:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	thanks I'll look. brb
2005-01-20T11:23:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	hi again, we have nero burning rom, please which settings do you recommend? we have boot-cd, and also iso image which looked same as what we did in start smart.
2005-01-20T11:29:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	if you get a second do you mind recommending burn settings for the iso, and if it's not that do you know any reason why it'd go right into xp are there settings we should change in xp like setting partitions before using the ubuntu iso or anything you can think of please thanks?
2005-01-20T11:31:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	defaults should be ok
2005-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	we'll try one more time thanks
2005-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	ok man
2005-01-20T11:32:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	If we do it right should it just bring up the ubuntu screens right away after booting from the CD?
2005-01-20T11:33:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	yep, but before that, get another known bootable cd, a windows one perhaps, and see if that will boot, then youll know if its the cd or the computer
2005-01-20T11:34:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	does the ubuntu livecd count, that works every time
2005-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	thanks we're trying the new recorded CD
2005-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	shit sorry, i forgot you mentioned that
2005-01-20T11:40:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	the live cd that is
2005-01-20T11:40:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	no prob, if it works we'l try linux and if not maybe we'll be back. seems like win is overriding the cd booting, though it could have just been poorly recorded both times...?
2005-01-20T11:42:00.000Z	new-ubuntu	linux_mafia	thanks, bye
2005-01-20T13:36:00.000Z	linux_mafia	new-ubuntu	i told you to use "burn disk image"
