2007-07-06T05:02:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	why cant you install?
2007-07-06T06:01:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	in xchat hit Server / Join channel / enter Mepis and press ok
2007-07-06T06:51:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	you get sorted?
2007-07-06T06:52:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	you still worried about data loss?
2007-07-06T06:54:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	what happens when you run gparted?
2007-07-06T07:01:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	theres no safe about it
2007-07-06T07:01:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	bullet proof vests work
2007-07-06T07:02:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	the only problem you have is in partitioning your drive... that takes an element of commitment by yourself
2007-07-06T07:02:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	you will not loose data if you do not make a sily mistake
2007-07-06T07:03:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	you have 4 drives?
2007-07-06T07:06:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	it seems that if data preservation is so important, buy another drive and keep the other safe, install ubuntu then mount the new drives and everything will still be intact
2007-07-06T07:18:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	dude expect some copies of dapper and fiesty in the post for you and your friends, might take a few weeks, i live in the uk, a long way away
2007-07-06T07:18:00.000Z	rich__	ubuntu_	alright?
