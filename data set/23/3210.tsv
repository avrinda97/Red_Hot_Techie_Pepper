2008-12-02T20:12:00.000Z	shubbar		i installed module-assistant and tried it for nvidia but nvidia-kernel-source build fails
2008-12-02T20:13:00.000Z	shubbar		i think something is missing from my system
2008-12-02T20:15:00.000Z	shubbar		does ubuntu version refer to year.month?
2008-12-02T20:15:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	yes
2008-12-02T20:17:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	yes
2008-12-02T20:17:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	at least I think so.. why not check the ubuntu site.. all this info is there
2009-01-28T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	run this in a terminal, "tail -f /var/log/syslog".. disconnect the drive, reconnect it... wait a couple of seconds.. pastebin whatever showed up in the terminal window (ctrl+c to close that command when you're done)
2009-01-28T00:30:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu.com/110420/
2009-01-28T00:31:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	it doesn't stop
2009-01-28T00:32:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	could be a usb power overload
2009-01-28T00:41:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	sorry.. I've been preparing to go out.. don't have time to help you.. but ask the channel again.. I'm sure someone has some idea
2009-02-05T14:22:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	you mean rename? try "mv"
2009-02-05T14:24:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	can you give me an example using mv
2009-02-05T14:25:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	mv awesomefile.txt awesomefile.data will change the name from awesomefile.txt to awesomefile.data ... it will still be the same text file though
2009-02-05T14:28:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	i tried batch converting and it gave me file finemane.ext is not a directory
2009-02-05T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	I never said you could use that straight away on several files at once
2009-02-05T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	what are you trying to do?
2009-02-05T14:30:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	batch convert some files with ext1 to ext2
2009-02-05T14:30:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	my example was only for one file
2009-02-05T14:31:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	how about using wildcards mv *.ext1 *.ext2
2009-02-05T14:32:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	I don't think it's that easy.. have you searched in synaptic for "rename files" ? I think there are a couple of utilities
2009-02-05T14:35:00.000Z	shubbar	Slart	did it,  using this command:   for f in *ext1 ; do mv $f `basename $f ext1`ext2; done
2009-02-05T14:36:00.000Z	Slart	shubbar	but still kind of elegant =) I would probably have made it uglier =)
