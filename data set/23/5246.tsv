2007-03-24T15:03:00.000Z	Virtual		Hello, I have downloaded yesterday the ubuntu cd from the website and when booting from it I notest that it does not detect my hdd and my wlan card, actually the wlan card does but thats another story, the main problem is the hdd because I cannot install the operating system from the bootcd, I am running on a brand new Dell Inspiron 1501 with a 80 GB SATA HDD
2007-03-24T15:04:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	what do you mean by it doesn't detect your hdd?
2007-03-24T15:05:00.000Z	Virtual	olimpico	exactly what I am saying, it is a SATA disk and I do have /dev/hda but when looking at the /var/log/messages log I saw that he tried to mount the drive about 5 times then gave up
2007-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	I'm using SATA HD with no problems on Gentoo, so I assume that your installation CD doesn't have the drivers. Maybe you should try with the installation DVD.
2007-03-24T15:08:00.000Z	Virtual	olimpico	I do not want to sound ignorant but I am not of a ubuntu user, myself I am more than a debian user but I did not see on the ubuntu website the option to download a dvd, as far as I can see there is only a cd version
2007-03-24T15:08:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	There are definitely drivers for SATA under linux, but it may be possible that the installation CD you are using doesn't have them, maybe because it's to old, or too small, or whatever. For example with the Ubuntu installation CD you cannot install reiserfs, but with the Installation DVD you can.
2007-03-24T15:09:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	Give me a minut and I'll give you a link.
2007-03-24T15:10:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	I'm also not a real Ubuntu expert my self, I have been more into Gentoo for the last years.
2007-03-24T15:11:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	Do you want it for Desktop or for server?
2007-03-24T15:12:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	http://kubuntu.org/download.php
2007-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	There you can download the DVD, it's Kubuntu, are you a GNOME user?
2007-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	Virtual	olimpico	ah yes I have found kubuntu dvd but I wanted to try to "real" thing, thank you
2007-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	hahahaha, what do you mean, with the real thing?
2007-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	You mean Gnome is more real than KDE?
2007-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	hahahahaha!
2007-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	Ubuntu & Kubuntu have the same system, they just differ from one having KDE and the other Gnome
2007-03-24T15:16:00.000Z	Virtual	olimpico	i know that, what I meant was that ubuntu was actually the first and even if kubuntu is a project of ubuntu they have different forums and other stuff, it sounds silly i know...
2007-03-24T15:16:00.000Z	Virtual	olimpico	but I just want to test this distro more carefully because I saw there is much fuss about it
2007-03-24T15:16:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	I have tried Ubuntu and Kubuntu, I much more satisfied with Kubuntu, but maybe is just a matter of taste.
2007-03-24T15:17:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	But starting with the installation disks, I think Kubuntu did a better job, but it's just my humble opinion.
2007-03-24T15:17:00.000Z	Virtual	olimpico	yeah, I prefer kde, but anyway, thank you for all the help
2007-03-24T15:18:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	here you can find the Ubuntu DVD: http://nginyang.uvt.nl/edgy/
2007-03-24T15:19:00.000Z	olimpico	Virtual	or just type Ubuntu DVD in google and you will get enough links
