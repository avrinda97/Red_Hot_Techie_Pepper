2007-03-30T10:55:00.000Z	superdummy		took long enough
2007-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	superdummy		that's cool
2007-03-30T10:57:00.000Z	superdummy		like to have the ram from that pc
2007-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	superdummy		xk..   have you set your bios to boot from cd/dvd first?
2007-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	superdummy		if not, it's not going to work
2007-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	xk	superdummy	yes I can boot into livecd but it hangs after "starting bluetooth services"
2007-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	xk		it doesn't actually hang, its still functional but sits there. its been 15minutes and its still there
2007-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	superdummy		haven't had that one yet..  I dunno
2007-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	xk		thats it?
2007-03-30T10:59:00.000Z	superdummy		try disabling the bluetooth devices
2007-03-30T10:59:00.000Z	xk		so nobody knows how to disable bluetooth from starting in livecd?
2007-03-30T10:59:00.000Z	xk		I don't have bluetooth devices, its a laptop
2007-03-30T10:59:00.000Z	superdummy		yeah but it has a blue tooth finder I'm sure
2007-03-30T10:59:00.000Z	superdummy		like mine does
2007-03-30T10:59:00.000Z	superdummy		just turn it off
2007-03-30T11:00:00.000Z	xk		bluetooth finder? you're talking about hardware bluetooth? how do I do this ? its a desktop
2007-03-30T11:00:00.000Z	superdummy		even more strange
2007-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	xk		isn't there a boot command for disabling bluetooth services?
2007-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	superdummy		if you don't have any bluetooth devices...  and your not using a laptop that auto detects blue tooth devices.. how is it that your pc is trying to run blootooth devices?
2007-03-30T11:02:00.000Z	superdummy	ricky	I know for a fact that you can find someone in ubuntu effects that will
2007-03-30T11:02:00.000Z	xk	superdummy	i dont know man its ubuntu thats doing it
