2008-07-03T12:29:00.000Z	ng0L_		can you help me?
2008-07-03T12:29:00.000Z	ng0L_		i am a newbie to ubuntu
2008-07-03T12:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	ask a question
2008-07-03T12:30:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	open up synaptic and search for wine and install it
2008-07-03T12:30:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	yes
2008-07-03T13:06:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	yes
2008-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	use the restricted drivers manager
2008-07-03T13:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	if you have an nvidia card it should be prompting you in system tray to enable it
2008-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	no idea, should be in system menu somewher
2008-07-03T13:10:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	so check it
2008-07-03T13:11:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	should be pretty self explanatory from this point (and requires a computer restart)
2008-07-03T13:11:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	we don't need a play by play :)
2008-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	there's probably a menu for it under the applications menu
2008-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	yes
2008-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	if you installed it correctly, i believe ubuntu let's you just double click on .exe files and it'll open them in wine automatically for you
2008-07-03T13:15:00.000Z	ng0L_	Fryguy--	okay let's me download a small exe file to test.
2008-07-03T13:17:00.000Z	ng0L_	Fryguy--	Is there anyway to push my connection speed a bit faster in Ubuntu? Whenever i update software, i meant ubuntu itself downloads the file from the server, so I cant even able to open another webpage. I don't know if it is happen to everyone else, but i can say it slower than in Windows about the connection speed.
2008-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	there's not really any easy way to do network load balancing of QoS, no
2008-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	ng0L_	Fryguy--	 so I have no choice beside waiting
2008-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ng0L_	i guess.  I find it hard to believe that you can't open webpages while downloading packages, maybe you have a very poor internet connection. I don't know
2008-07-03T13:20:00.000Z	ng0L_	Fryguy--	Maybe, but when i was on windows i download such a big file, thus i still able to open other page. I have no idea.
2008-07-03T13:22:00.000Z	ng0L_	Fryguy--	I have install my nvidia card successfully, it requires to restart to make thing changed. brb
