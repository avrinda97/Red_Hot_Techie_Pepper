2005-05-27T07:30:00.000Z	occy		ugh ugh ugh
2005-05-27T07:31:00.000Z	occy		is there not a card better suited for Linux that will just fscking work besides nvidia?
2005-05-27T07:31:00.000Z	occy		0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV17 [GeForce4 MX 440]  (rev a3)
2005-05-27T07:31:00.000Z	occy		that's what I have now
2005-05-27T07:32:00.000Z	occy		it's beyond old.
2005-05-27T07:34:00.000Z	occy		I was simply dragging a pasted area in gimp around and LOCk
2005-05-27T07:34:00.000Z	occy		heh
2005-05-27T07:34:00.000Z	kestas	occy	maybe its something wrong with gnome
2005-05-27T07:31:00.000Z	kestas	occy	nope nvidia works fine though
2005-05-27T07:32:00.000Z	kestas	occy	thats what my sister has and it works fine
2005-05-27T07:32:00.000Z	occy	kestas	I ran winxp on this same hardware for 3 months without 1 single problem.   I can't get Ubuntu to stay up on it for any longer than 3 days
2005-05-27T07:32:00.000Z	kestas	occy	how are you sure its the card tahts crashing?
2005-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	occy	kestas	I've ran memtest86 and that seems fine.
2005-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	kestas	occy	theres still lots of things it could be
2005-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	kestas	occy	you need an error message, or something specific
2005-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	occy	kestas	true... But I've heard others have had issues.
2005-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	occy	kestas	none in the logs at all.
2005-05-27T07:34:00.000Z	kestas	occy	could you try xfce or kde?
2005-05-27T07:34:00.000Z	kestas	occy	if you did that it would narrow it down a lot
2005-05-27T07:35:00.000Z	kestas	occy	well if you want to get another video card to try and solve this go for it
