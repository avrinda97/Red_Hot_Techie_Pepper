2005-11-26T17:54:00.000Z	calamari		hi
2005-11-26T17:54:00.000Z	calamari		I need help with ubuntu... I think I may have a virus
2005-11-26T06:03:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	Win98 is fast because it does VERY little :-)
2005-11-26T06:03:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	did you solve your issue with lockups?
2005-11-26T06:03:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	nope..
2005-11-26T06:04:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	I need a tool that tells me which programs are causing the reads or writes to my drive
2005-11-26T06:04:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	then when it happens I can see what the culprit is
2005-11-26T06:05:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	people always say top.. but that is wrong because it doesn't track disk i/o.. and the problem doesn't appear in top.. top thinks everything is dandy .. with solid hd activity
2005-11-26T06:05:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	there are a few tools that you can use
2005-11-26T06:05:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	vmstat will tell you which kind of disk usage you have  - if it is swapping or regular disk usage
2005-11-26T06:06:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	I think I need a program that logs disk i/o and which program did it.. so I can file an appropriate bug report
2005-11-26T06:06:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	otherwise people will say that my lockups are hardware related
2005-11-26T06:06:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	if you are experiencing thrashing (yes, written this way) then it not a particular program. it just that you are swapping to much. it a VM fault.
2005-11-26T06:07:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	type vmstat 5 and check its output
2005-11-26T06:07:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	well the thing is that it normal;ly doesn't thrash.. and when it does I am not doing anything out of the ordinary.. fore example it just did it while I was chatting on irc
2005-11-26T06:08:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	if you have something big running in the background... then you may experience heavy swapping. How much memory you have?
2005-11-26T06:09:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	384mb .. and most is free.. I show no swap being used... and also when it freezies I've checked and no swap
2005-11-26T06:10:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	I wonder sometimes if it is a cron job that is causing it.. but I don't know how to find out besides disabling cron and I'd rather not
2005-11-26T06:10:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	leave the vmstat in some terminal... and check it when the problem surfaces. it will tell you something about the nature of your disk IO.
2005-11-26T06:11:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	I had some issues with cron a long time ago. Don't remember now, really.
2005-11-26T06:11:00.000Z	calamari	cribeiro	okay I will leave that running.. hopefully it will capture the problem.. thanks :)
2005-11-26T06:12:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	well, at least you'll know if the IO is process or application driven... or VM driven.
2005-11-26T06:13:00.000Z	cribeiro	calamari	you may try also lsof or something like that
