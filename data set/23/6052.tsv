2006-06-22T12:35:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	enable multiverse
2006-06-22T12:38:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	i've enabled everything in synaptic
2006-06-22T12:40:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	any other idea's these are just the multimedia plugins
2006-06-22T12:41:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	yeah, liblame0 is in multiverse
2006-06-22T12:41:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	have you run apt-get update?
2006-06-22T12:42:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	 you need to run that after making changes to sources.list
2006-06-22T12:42:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	so everytime i install i package i have to run apt-get update?
2006-06-22T12:43:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	how do i do this
2006-06-22T12:44:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	, if you want to get changes, you need to run apt-get update, that updates the local database of available packages, apt-get upgrade committs any upgrades that are available
2006-06-22T12:45:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	so this is done in the terminal right, not in synaptic
2006-06-22T12:45:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	well apt-get update is the same as the reload button in synaptic
2006-06-22T12:47:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	oh ok. then what is the equivelent button for apt-get upgrade?
2006-06-22T12:47:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	mark all upgrades and then apply
2006-06-22T12:50:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	i understand that. but it wont let me mark that package
2006-06-22T12:50:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	can i PM you
2006-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	jasonm	NoUse	im not sure what you ment in that last message
2006-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	NoUse	jasonm	pastebin your sources.list file first
