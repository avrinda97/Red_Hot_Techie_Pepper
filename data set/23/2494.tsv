2009-02-20T21:18:00.000Z	patrickas		let me check ... I assume you'll give me a warning before I runa  command that my mess up the machine ?
2009-02-20T21:18:00.000Z	patrickas		I mean it'll give me
2009-02-20T21:19:00.000Z	patrickas		ok :-)
2009-02-20T21:21:00.000Z	patrickas		ok so i should try /dev/sda or /dev/sdb ? I think windows was on /dev/sdb if that matters ...
2009-02-20T21:22:00.000Z	patrickas		ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo grub-install /dev/sdb
2009-02-20T21:22:00.000Z	patrickas		Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.
2009-02-20T21:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	sudo fdisk -l
2009-02-20T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	make sure you are talking to the right device
2009-02-20T21:23:00.000Z	patrickas	ActionParsnip1	How  should I post the output as not flood the channel ?

2009-02-20T21:27:00.000Z	patrickas	ActionParsnip1	I did not lose GRUB after insatlling windows
2009-02-20T21:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	read the guide and it will help you install grub to the drive
2009-02-20T21:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	its not THAT specific, jeez :)
2009-02-20T21:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	its if the grub gets lost due to ANY OS writing to the boot sector
2009-02-20T21:29:00.000Z	patrickas	ActionParsnip1	 Yes I know ... I will read and follow it, I just objected because I assumed that the guide will help me reinstall grub in the same location it was originally installed in, which never worked in the first place.
2009-02-20T21:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	assume makes an ASS out of U and ME ;)
2009-02-20T21:32:00.000Z	patrickas	ActionParsnip1	in the guide it says : grub> root (hdX,Y)  which is  (hd1,5) in my case
2009-02-20T21:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	disk numbers start at 0
2009-02-20T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	not 1
2009-02-20T21:33:00.000Z	patrickas	ActionParsnip1	THis time I did not assume anything :-) I ran find /boot/grub/stage1 and it gave me  (hd1,5)
2009-02-20T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	fair enough
2009-02-20T21:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	no if thats what the guide says i'd agree
2009-02-20T21:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	patrickas	try http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/
