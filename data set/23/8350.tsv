2004-10-14T14:11:00.000Z	guptan		how can I get basic devel tools for ubuntu (like gcc and all)
2004-10-14T14:11:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	apt-get install build-essential
2004-12-21T17:06:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	umm... thats the debian name for 'linux-image'... which is in 'main'
2004-12-21T17:07:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	I have linux-image installed, still smartlink packages ask for kernel-image
2004-12-21T17:09:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	just check this link: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto/view?searchterm=smartlink . I've all packages mentioned there already installed, but kernel-image
2004-12-21T17:10:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	everything that says 'kernel-image' should read 'linux-image' there... its the same thing.
2004-12-21T17:11:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	i've them all, but smartlink package asks for kernel-image
2004-12-21T17:13:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	read section 3 under "Compiling the driver"... thanks
2004-12-21T17:15:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	for that I need to install smartlink package first, its stuck in dependency problem of some kernel-image
2004-12-21T17:15:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	no, you just need to expand the tar.gz, and change the file;.
2004-12-21T17:16:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	I got a .deb from here http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/s/sl-modem/
2004-12-21T17:17:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	file a bug on that package about this... but in the mean time, get the tar.gz.
2004-12-21T17:17:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	Ubuntu's kernel package is called 'linux-image', so it _shouldn't_ depend kernel-image
2004-12-21T17:18:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	I understand.
2004-12-21T17:18:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	is there anyway to get .tar.gz from .deb
2004-12-21T17:19:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	umm, well technically... but it would be easier to just download tar.gz on its own  :/
2004-12-21T17:19:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	u mean from smartlink itself?
2004-12-21T17:19:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	yes... that would probably be as good a place as any to get it  :/
2004-12-21T17:20:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	okies, let me try that way
2004-12-21T17:20:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	_make_sure_ you file the bug though!
2004-12-21T17:21:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	well I need to learn first how to file a bug :)
2004-12-21T17:22:00.000Z	|trey|	guptan	bugzilla.ubuntu.com ... sign up, and click "new bug"
2004-12-21T17:22:00.000Z	guptan	|trey|	thanks!
