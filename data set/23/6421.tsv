2006-04-30T12:24:00.000Z	jdmpike		Does anyone one know why a USB hub wouldn't work and what you could do to fix it?
2006-04-30T12:25:00.000Z	blindx	jdmpike	is it externally powered or powered through the usb port? and what have you tried plugging into it?
2006-04-30T12:26:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	I have tried plugging it into one of the two USB ports on my laptop
2006-04-30T12:26:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	I am trying to plug a mouse into it
2006-04-30T12:26:00.000Z	blindx	jdmpike	is it externally powered? or powered through usb?
2006-04-30T12:27:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	dmesg sees "new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address ...:
2006-04-30T12:27:00.000Z	blindx	jdmpike	can you please answer my question?
2006-04-30T12:27:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	it is externally powered
2006-04-30T12:28:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	I guess - I don't think the usb hub is externally powered, just the fans that are in it
2006-04-30T12:28:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	it works fine under windows
2006-04-30T12:29:00.000Z	blindx	jdmpike	have you tried plugging anything else into it?
2006-04-30T12:29:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	dmesg sees it "USB hub found; 4 ports detected"
2006-04-30T12:29:00.000Z	blindx	jdmpike	have you tried plugging anything else into it?
2006-04-30T12:29:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	the mouse works when I plug it directly into the other USB port on the laptop
2006-04-30T12:30:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	but not when I plug it into usb
2006-04-30T12:30:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	yes I have tried to plug a hd into it also, and another wireless mouse
2006-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	yeah - anything I plug into the usb hub doesn't seem to work
2006-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	dmesg can't see anything when I plug devices into the hub
2006-04-30T12:32:00.000Z	blindx	jdmpike	I'm not sure then. sounds funky. my usb hub works..so i don't know.
2006-04-30T12:32:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	this usb hub used to work well
2006-04-30T12:32:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	quit working like two days ago
2006-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	jdmpike	blindx	I will post to forum, just wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something stupid
2006-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	blindx	jdmpike	you said it was working fine and now it's not? sounds like a faulty device then
