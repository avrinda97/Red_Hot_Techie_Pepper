2010-07-29T06:51:00.000Z	sander__		Anyone know how I can make sure I'm using an apt repository right?
2010-07-29T06:51:00.000Z	KE1HA	sander__	comment out all but the PPA repo that you want in your source list.
2010-07-29T06:53:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	Found http://ppa.launchpad.net lucid/main Packages
2010-07-29T06:53:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	Found http://ppa.launchpad.net lucid Packages
2010-07-29T06:53:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	I also got: Ign http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/ lucid/main Translation-nb
2010-07-29T06:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	sander__	ad the one you want, comment out those your dont, add the Auth Key's as stated earlier.
2010-07-29T06:55:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	I've done that.. And the add-apt-repository already added the auto key's
2010-07-29T06:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	sander__	Here's a simple How-To for repos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine
2010-07-29T07:06:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	I know that stuff about repos.. Here i've done the exact same thing on both my ubuntu desktop 64bit systems: http://pastebin.com/7zkRLKCG
2010-07-29T07:11:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	kinda strange that it says: #
2010-07-29T07:06:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	still diffrent result.
2010-07-29T07:07:00.000Z	KE1HA	sander__	what do you mean, diffrent results, what is tha ACTUALLY FAULT OR PROBLEM UR TRYING TO SOLVE THEN ?
2010-07-29T07:07:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	I'm trying to reinstall the xbmc packages.. since I had an svn apt mirror.. I want to install the packages from the stable mirror
2010-07-29T07:08:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	means.. "downgrading" a package version.
2010-07-29T07:08:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	from 1:10.08~svn32246-lucid1 to 1:9.11-lucid2
2010-07-29T07:08:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	if thats possible..
2010-07-29T07:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	sander__	I must say, Im not the best expert on downgrading, but will have a nose around and see what I can find.
2010-07-29T07:14:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	This did it :-): apt-get --reinstall install xbmc=1:9.11-lucid2 xbmc-bin=1:9.11-lucid2 xbmc-data=1:9.11-lucid2 xbmc-skin-confluence=1:9.11-lucid2
2010-07-29T07:15:00.000Z	KE1HA	sander__	what was the result ?
2010-07-29T07:17:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	obs.. seems like an install error.. I'll try to --purge the package and install it.
2010-07-29T07:20:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	worked.. after I did apt-get remove --purge
2010-07-29T07:21:00.000Z	sander__	KE1HA	thansk for the help tho.. to clearify the problem.
2010-07-29T07:21:00.000Z	KE1HA	sander__	you should write upa "How-Too" for others wanting to do the same things.
