2009-11-22T13:12:00.000Z	Il__Matteo		hi everybody! 2 simple questions for you: 1) how do i set the "windows" key to open Applications menu? 2) how do i set the key combo "windows" + m to show desktop? thanks!!! :)
2009-11-22T13:14:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	if you have compiz setup, then you can use that to set up the combo 'windows' (aka SUPER) + m to show desktop. As for the SUPER key opening up applications, not sure. You can install gnome-do or use the <alt>-F2
2009-11-22T13:15:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	glad I could help.
2009-11-22T13:22:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	knoppies	I found the "keyboard shortcuts" option in system >> preferences. The applications menu command is currently alt+f1, but i don't manage to turn it just to the SUPER key. the SUPER + m combo doesn't work, even if i associated it to the proper command (focus on desktop). other combos work (but they're not so easy to remember!), while SUPER + m just graphically inverts screen colors (black becomes white, white becomes b
2009-11-22T13:23:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	do you know what compiz is?
2009-11-22T13:24:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	compiz is (in short) a window decorator, that makes your windows look AWSOME and adds animations to your windows. But it has some other good features as well, such as multiple desktops (not monitors) and many <alt><tab> features
2009-11-22T13:25:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	go System -> administration -> synaptic package manager. Then search for compiz settings, then install the package that sounds like compiz-advanced-settings manager
2009-11-22T13:26:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	once compiz settings manager is installed, you can find it under system -> preferences -> compiz settings
2009-11-22T13:31:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	knoppies	yeah, the SUPER + m combo now works!!! compiz was already installed but had a "negative colours" function already linked to SUPER + m combo, so that it had higher priority over user-set shortcuts
2009-11-22T13:32:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	yea, I thought that was the case.
2009-11-22T13:32:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	play around with compiz, it is truly amazing. For some inspiration search up compiz on youtube.
2009-11-22T13:33:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	you look at gnome-do? its another awesome (and very sophisticated) application starter.
2009-11-22T13:34:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	knoppies	let me have a try! :)
2009-11-22T13:34:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	the gnome-do shotcut is <SUPER><SPACE> you can install it using the synaptic package manager. Search in the preferences for plugins.
2009-11-22T13:37:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	knoppies	I installed the packages but <SUPER><Space> combo seams to be dead :°
2009-11-22T13:38:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	knoppies	found it! :D
2009-11-22T13:38:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	you have to start gnome-do first I think. <alt>-F2 then type in gnome do, then select the gnome do in the list.
2009-11-22T13:38:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	ok. good.
2009-11-22T13:39:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	no problem.
2009-11-22T13:44:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	knoppies	and what about opening a certain application onto a certain desktop space? i lurked through italian ubuntu forum, but i found no solutions :°
2009-11-22T13:45:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	not sure. Normally they just open on the current workspace. You can move them by either right clicking on their title bar, or holding <shift><ctrl><alt><arrowKEY> where arrowKEY is the direction you want to go.
2009-11-22T13:48:00.000Z	Il__Matteo	knoppies	i already do it, but it's lame! :) i want my ubuntu to do it automatically on start.
2009-11-22T13:48:00.000Z	knoppies	Il__Matteo	ok, Im not sure how. I hope you work that one out.
