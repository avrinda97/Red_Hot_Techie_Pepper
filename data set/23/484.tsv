2012-05-15T18:57:00.000Z	auronandace	toughengineer	intel graphics are usually installed by default
2012-05-15T18:57:00.000Z	toughengineer	auronandace	i used to that .. but this time they didn't
2012-05-15T18:57:00.000Z	auronandace	toughengineer	its difficult to help you if we don't know the exact model of the intel card
2012-05-15T18:58:00.000Z	auronandace	toughengineer	the newer the card the less likely it is in the kernel
2012-05-15T19:00:00.000Z	toughengineer	auronandace	i will do my best and i will be here in a few minutes
