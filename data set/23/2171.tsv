2011-08-20T04:21:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	You'll need to edit grub but that should be it
2011-08-20T04:24:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	grub is a program that sits in the very beginning of the hdd.  It tells the motherboard where the OS's are
2011-08-20T04:26:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	Fedora should install grub so that you can boot both Ubuntu and Fedora (a menu when your computer boots).  I'm not sure fedora will do that.  It should.  If it does not come back and I can help you fix it
2011-08-20T04:28:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	you are completely kindness :) thanks for support Sr. actually I'm gonna install backtrack not fedora) for some reason i did't want to say that :D
2011-08-20T04:28:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	ha-sure
2011-08-20T04:28:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	don't mention that again :)
2011-08-20T04:28:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	:D
2011-08-20T04:29:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	Sr, can ext4 file system contain date files? like music pics videos etc... ?)
2011-08-20T04:30:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	yes
2011-08-20T04:31:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	well, while i will be installing backtrack i will delete all partitions, and divide them again for 4 pieces, my question is, should i create all of them in ext4 file system ?:) sorry for long and boring questions.
2011-08-20T04:32:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	If you delete all partitions you will delete all your personal data and ubuntu
2011-08-20T04:33:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	im aware of that, but afterwards i done removal, should i re-create all partitions as ext4 file system ?
2011-08-20T04:33:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	You can.  Or you can do it with the ubuntu installer (assuming you're going to reinstall ubuntu
2011-08-20T04:34:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	because it offers some other file system types such as fat 16 32 ext4 3 and some other kinds, im not sure which one i need therefore im asking )
2011-08-20T04:34:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	ext4
2011-08-20T04:34:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	thanks :)
2011-08-20T04:37:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	may i ask one other question ? pls
2011-08-20T04:37:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	yes
2011-08-20T04:38:00.000Z	Kamikaze	edbian	is deletion of partition and re-create it equal to formating it ? is it the same thing ?
2011-08-20T04:38:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	yes
2011-08-20T04:38:00.000Z	edbian	Kamikaze	effectively
