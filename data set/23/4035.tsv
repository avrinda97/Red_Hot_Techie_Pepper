2007-12-05T05:30:00.000Z	alzamabar		I can't connect to MySQL. I installed it, set a new password when asked but now I can't connect
2007-12-05T05:31:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	use ip and not localhost
2010-03-05T02:28:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	The samba default is WORKGROUP   (all uppercase) but in some cases it may go to MSHOME (all uppercase) . Also make sure you are using a username which exists on the machine you are trying to access, not a username which is on the local machine
2010-03-05T02:29:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	Thanks. I'll try MSHOME
2010-03-05T02:33:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	It does not work...Actually from one desktop I can see the server (although I cannot connect to it) but from the server I cannot see the client...Any clue as why?
2010-03-05T02:34:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	The smb client is installed by default, but the smb server is not usually. There used to also be a glitch where the smbfs package was needed before shares were browseable
2010-03-05T02:35:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	Also if boxes are not seeing each other, sometimes this has to do with no broadcast IP being known
2010-03-05T02:35:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	I've installed samba, smbclient, samba-tools, smbfs
2010-03-05T02:36:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	Have you run: testparm        to see if your smb.conf is viable?
2010-03-05T02:36:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	on the client or on the server, or on both?
2010-03-05T02:36:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	The server
2010-03-05T02:36:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	sec
2010-03-05T02:37:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	It gives some output. It shows my samba shares, plus Server role: ROLE_STANDALONE
2010-03-05T02:38:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	I can see the share on the client, but when I try to access it it doesn't go through
2010-03-05T02:38:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	You mean you from the client you can see the server but can't access it, or the other way around?
2010-03-05T02:39:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	from the client I can see the server but I can't access it. From the server I can't see the client
2010-03-05T02:39:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	correction...From the server I can see the client, under samba workgroup
2010-03-05T02:41:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	But from both the server and the client I cannot access each other
2010-03-05T02:41:00.000Z	genii	alzamabar	OK. If you used for instance a share which is in "fred" home directory or where "fred" username on the server is allowed, then on the server do: sudo smbpasswd -a fred              and give him a samba password. Then do: sudo smbpasswd -e fred   (to enable the username under samba) Then restart the samba server with either: sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart     or on later upstart: sudo restart samba
2010-03-05T02:43:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	in my samba I declared that only one user (e.g. myself on both machines) can access that share. The fact is that I've got two different passwords on the two boxes. Is there a file I can check to see if it has already got what you are suggesting?
2010-03-05T02:45:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	I'm looking at /etc/samba/samba.conf and I can see the shares, the WORKGROUP=WORKGROUP
2010-03-05T02:46:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	On the client though, I can't see much
2010-03-05T02:51:00.000Z	alzamabar	genii	I'll go with ssh
