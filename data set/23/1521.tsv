2010-03-20T04:09:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	do you know what it takes to get someone's attention in #pulseaudio or #alsa ?
2010-03-20T04:09:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	Unfortunately, no.  Have you offered beer?
2010-03-20T04:16:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	are you any good with sound? i have an odd problem but i have found a thread on it, though it doesn't resolve the problem i have remaining it does mention the problem
2010-03-20T04:19:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	sorry, my sound-fu is pretty bad.  I had things working in 8.10, then I upgraded to 9.04 and things broke.  I'v stumbled through getting it more or less working, but some less importand programs are still having issues.
2010-03-20T04:21:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	you know anyone who is good with sound?  maybe you could take a look at the thread?  i'm kinda lost because it mentions the issue but they didn't find a fix on that thread
2010-03-20T04:22:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	My show's about to start.  mplayer /var/tv/BreakingBad_S01E04.avi
2010-03-20T04:23:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	I've had bad luck with totem.  It may even be one of those apps that the sound doesn't work on.
2010-03-20T04:25:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	 I have an 800MHz clunker with 300Mb of RAM.  The less clutter I have the better.
2010-03-20T04:26:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	Sweet!  I've been looking to upgrade.  What motherboard do you have?
2010-03-20T04:27:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	actually it's a laptop.  vpcf115fm.  i'm not sure what board is in it actually
2010-03-20T04:28:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	Oh, laptop.  Right.  When I see i7 I picture a CPU heat sink/fan about the size of my fist.
2010-03-20T04:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	Really?  I'll have to actually look at one instead of looking at the tricked out, light up, heat pipe, liquid cooled demonstrator.  Anyways, what problem are you having with the sound?
2010-03-20T04:32:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	it use to only work via headphones/plugin mic
2010-03-20T04:35:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	sorry, nothing is coming to mind.  You do have them unmuted, right?
2010-03-20T04:35:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	yes, let me show you a link that explains, maybe you'll have an idea for me.  http://code.google.com/p/vaio-f11-linux/issues/detail?id=9#c1
2010-03-20T04:41:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	I followed a few links off of the link you sent me.  If I'm reading it right, it looks like you have to patch the kernel to get the mic/line in working.
2010-03-20T04:42:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	what kernel patch do i need?  i never found that
2010-03-20T04:44:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	See comment #5 on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/525149
2010-03-20T04:45:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	this is going to sound stupid.  how do you run a patch?
2010-03-20T04:46:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	I think a .patch file is actually a script that patches things.
2010-03-20T04:46:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	should i just chmod and sh it?
2010-03-20T04:48:00.000Z	dsnyders	mrwizeguy1983	I know less about patching kernels than I do about sound.  I think so, but hey!  Huge grain of salt here.  You could seriously damage things.
2010-03-20T04:53:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	dsnyders	i found http://code.google.com/p/vaio-f11-linux/wiki/EnableMicrophone that says to patch the kernel and explains why it's necessary....but it doesn't say how to patch.... and it says something about rebuilding....
