2006-12-04T09:09:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	no, it's the newer _better_ fork of compiz
2006-12-04T09:09:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	then you didn't do it correctly :)
2006-12-04T09:09:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	glad to hear it

2006-12-04T09:10:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	also, the only driver that supports the x1400 is FGLRX
2006-12-04T09:10:00.000Z	Moosejaw	strabes	thanks for all your help
2006-12-04T09:10:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	np that's what i'm here for
2006-12-04T09:12:00.000Z	Moosejaw	strabes	so i should keep the current driver i am using?
2006-12-04T09:13:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	if that driver is fglrx, yes. if not then you should install fglrx, it's really easy to do. see this link for how to do it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2006-12-04T09:16:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	you have to use XGL
2006-12-16T15:20:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	mplayer firefox plugin
2006-12-16T16:23:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	yes. !ask
2006-12-16T16:23:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	what do you want to know about xgl/beryl
2006-12-16T16:24:00.000Z	strabes	Moosejaw	if you install it correctly, it is very stable. i hear aiglx is even more stable if your card supports it
