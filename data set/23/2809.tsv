2008-11-06T16:52:00.000Z	mrmikejg	ActionParsnip	is there a way of obtaining that info just from them being connected?
2008-11-06T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrmikejg	you could look in your routers dhcp table
2008-11-06T16:53:00.000Z	mrmikejg	ActionParsnip	so i need to someone access my router info?  hmm...lol
2008-11-06T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrmikejg	yeah, web browse to its ip and login, there will be a list there
2008-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	mrmikejg	ActionParsnip	do you know where i could obtain info on how to log into the router
2008-11-06T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrmikejg	ifconfig, its your default gateway ip

2008-11-06T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mrmikejg	nslookup and ping conert names to ips and ips to names
