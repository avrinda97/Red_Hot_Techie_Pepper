2007-12-09T06:32:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Hello all
2007-12-09T06:32:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I have a DiVX encoded avi file -- that doesn't playback in VLC
2007-12-09T06:32:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I hear the sound - but dont see the picture...
2007-12-09T06:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 thats odd..  Where did it come from?
2007-12-09T06:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 right click on it - select properties. check the tabs for detailed info
2007-12-09T06:34:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	It says ehh Mpeg-4 divx
2008-01-30T07:41:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	bzip2, boo
2008-08-30T10:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	I think he literally means a blank line in the menu
2009-01-19T09:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	should use -i
2009-01-19T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 depends. :)  at least dont use sudo su :)
2009-01-19T09:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	I guess it does depened yeah
2009-01-19T09:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	but right - anything but sudo su! Anything but that!
2009-01-19T09:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 i got my root user with their own customiuzed .bashrc and stuff.. so i often dont want them to be usign the users settings.. but   it depends. :)
2009-01-26T07:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 not under gnome at this time.
2009-01-26T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 use what you want. :) we dont care. ;p
2009-01-26T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 set up a random wallpaper changer.. and dont worry about it
2009-01-26T07:58:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	but I want the same beautiful babe on desktop 2 all the time!
2009-01-26T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 there may be a way to do it with using compiz to manage the background.. but that then causes other issues...
2009-01-26T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 the gnome powers at be.. decided thats too 'comfusing' an option :)
2009-01-27T07:55:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	im not sure that was the real reason
2009-01-27T07:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Dr_willis	I think they had more manpower/resources as one unit
2009-01-27T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Cpudan80	 :) thats always the case.. but it never stops forks  it seems
