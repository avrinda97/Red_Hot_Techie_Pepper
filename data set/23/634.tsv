2011-05-05T16:05:00.000Z	Glycan		Sorry, I missed my answer: Can I make a live usb out of grub?
2011-05-05T16:06:00.000Z	Glycan		(The firmware on the box I'm trying to fix points to a broken bootstraper, e.g. the half-deleted windwos one)
2011-05-05T16:06:00.000Z	Glycan		Well?
2011-05-05T16:08:00.000Z	Glycan		Guys!
2011-05-05T16:09:00.000Z	Glycan		Hepl me out here!
2011-05-05T16:09:00.000Z	Glycan		I/my friend had Windows vista on a toshiba laptop. The screen broke, I took it from him, hooked it up to another screen, put U on it (11.04), the computer was very cluttered so I only put the gb partition, then when space became very tight I tryed cleaning the windows, deleted windows (didn't get my space back- How do you change partition borders?), then a while later when I rebooted, it tryed
2011-05-05T16:09:00.000Z	Glycan		to poitn to windows (normally boot points to windows, and windows asks you what you want, and you go to ubuntu from there.), but most of windows wosn't there, so I can't get to U. A live CD I made only shows test console, and doesn't even let past the cd, I think. "BusyBox v1.17.1, build in shell (ash). How do I get to U?
2011-05-05T16:09:00.000Z	Glycan		Correction: How do I get to GRUB? Can I make a live USB?
2011-05-05T16:10:00.000Z	Glycan		(For th e 3rd time today, and the 3rd day I'm asking too, and I still havn't recived much help/
2011-05-05T16:11:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	you can try using GParted.  download the iso, burn it and boot from it.  It will resize partitions for you.  http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
2011-05-05T16:20:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	so you did a dual install (side-by-side Windows and Ubuntu) and then decided to delete the Windows directory files?
2011-05-05T16:22:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	let's step back one step.  What is the ultimate goal you are trying to reach?
2011-05-05T16:23:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	So right now the Windows bootloader isn't working?
2011-05-05T16:23:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	hold on a sec.
2011-05-05T16:25:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	I knew I saw this page somewhere before.  Here is an Ubuntu wiki page that shows you how to recover Grub.  You do need an Ubuntu Live CD.  ..............    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2011-05-05T16:25:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	I think that will help.
2011-05-05T16:25:00.000Z	Glycan	mrkrrtft	botcity, ThinkT510, et all, I have to go in five minuets. Please email me about what I Should do at mkggame@gmail.com
2011-05-05T16:25:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	save that URL and it should help you out.
2011-05-05T16:26:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	Unfortunately that is a requirement for what you need done.  You *will* need an Ubuntu Live CD.
2011-05-05T16:27:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	maybe download a new ISO, do an MD5 check on it, before you burn it, to make sure it downloaded correctly.
2011-05-05T16:27:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	what version of Windows do you have?
2011-05-05T16:30:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	for free software I have had good luck with ISO Recorder.  ...................             http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm
2011-05-05T16:31:00.000Z	mrkrrtft	Glycan	good luck.  Make sure to back up your data before you try anything though.
