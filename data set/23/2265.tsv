2009-05-11T01:19:00.000Z	hhp2k1		Hey everyone, quick question.  I'm trying to set up dual-monitor in Ubuntu 9.04 on an older PC; an Nvidia Geforce3 AGP graphics card on primary, and an 8MB ATI graphics card on PCI.  Can these two coexist in ubuntu and work together, or no?
2009-05-11T01:20:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	without knowing better.. my first guess would be No.  It would mean installing two X servers, and two generally don't coexist well.
2009-05-11T01:21:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Thank you. Installing two X Servers, is it possible though?
2009-05-11T01:22:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	as far as I know, you can install as many as you want.. using more than one at a time though, I doubt it.
2009-05-11T01:23:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Understood.  Thank you. :)
2009-05-11T01:24:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	if you want a simple way out.. invest $100 on a low end nvidia or ati card with dual video ports.
2009-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Unfortunately, the only hardware I have is ALL old, so I would need to invest about $500 in a fully new PC. :P  That's my issue right now.
2009-05-11T01:26:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	PCI cards are still available.. as are AGP, if you know where to look.
2009-05-11T01:27:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Thankfully I'm in a pretty nice tech hub area in Toronto, so I'm going scavenger hunting next weekend =D
2009-05-11T01:27:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	suggest doing a little research on newegg before you do, should give you an idea of what's available :)
2009-05-11T01:28:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Forgot about newegg.  *bookmarks*  You're awesome!
2009-05-11T01:29:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	curious, what qualifies as "old"? and what are you using this box for anyway?
2009-05-11T01:30:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Primary PC, unfortunately. :(  HP Compaq PGA370, 1.2GHz Celeron, 512MB SDRAM, USB1.1 and an nVidia Geforce3 64MB AGP video card.
2009-05-11T01:30:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Makes me cringe every time I think about it.
2009-05-11T01:30:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Thankfully, ubuntu runs rather well on it.

2009-05-11T01:31:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Oh, nice.  That would do it nicely.
2009-05-11T01:31:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	ballpark, anyway.. I bet you can find something nicer if you dig.
2009-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Well thank you for pointing me in the right direction :D
2009-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	look for something from a prominent hardware vendor..  couple more I'd recommend looking at..  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150107 and http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121260
2009-05-11T01:37:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	The first one is nice - I've got converters for DVI ports from other PC builds.
2009-05-11T01:38:00.000Z	Yondering	hhp2k1	personally, I'd probably flip a coin.  I've had excellent luck with XFX' nvidia products, but Asus know thier game too.
2009-05-11T01:39:00.000Z	hhp2k1	Yondering	Oh yeah, both are definitely solid
