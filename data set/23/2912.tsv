2008-10-02T09:07:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	looks like it worked, though I had to restart since I was getting symbol errors when I attempted to modprobe
2008-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	modinfo iwl4945, i think the one in ubuntu is 1.2.25
2008-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	also if u havent already done so install linux-backports
2008-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	1.2.23k
2008-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	it has updated wifi stack
2008-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	backports is pretty stable for me on 2.6.24-19 kernel
2008-10-02T09:09:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	im on 2.6.25.10, is backports a package in apt?
2008-10-02T09:10:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	2.6.25? are u on intrepid?
2008-10-02T09:10:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	no I manually upgraded (tinkering with iwlwifi required it)
2008-10-02T09:10:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	so im hardy
2008-10-02T09:11:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	hm forget about backports then its for stock kernel only
2008-10-02T09:11:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	but this is fine now, for some reason I kept getting kernel panics with that other module I compiled, and they increased in frequency over time
2008-10-02T09:12:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	yep same problem for me here panics with the newer kernel
2008-10-02T09:12:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	also heavy cpu usage when connecting to networks to the point where computer becomes unusable
2008-10-02T09:13:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	many ppl report that
2008-10-02T09:13:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	Im not sure if its the newer kernel or that specific wifi module, because if I used the machine with networking disabled it never paniced
2008-10-02T09:13:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	i suggest go back to hardy stock kernel 2.6.24-19 and install backports module
2008-10-02T09:14:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	backports is 1.2.25 and as i said its been stable for me
2008-10-02T09:14:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	I still have that kernel, I'd just have to go back and reconfigure my xorg.conf
2008-10-02T09:14:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	but i'll see if this gives me anymore trouble first
2008-10-02T09:16:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	the whole thing has been nothing but trouble to me, iwl driver is half baked with stuff like dynamic wep missing so i cant connect to my college's wifi
2008-10-02T09:17:00.000Z	Shak--	usser	your college uses encryption on the wifi network? :/
2008-10-02T09:17:00.000Z	usser	Shak--	yea
