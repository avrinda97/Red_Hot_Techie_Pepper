2006-01-08T09:55:00.000Z	veklita		I have a powerbook with a mostly dead hard drive, and i currently have it booted on an Ubunto Live CD
2006-01-08T09:56:00.000Z	veklita		And I'm wondering how I might try to mount the hard drive to get access to it and try and recover some dayta
2006-01-08T09:56:00.000Z	veklita		data^
2006-01-08T09:57:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	what was the machine running?
2006-01-08T09:59:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	...What generation of Powerbook are we talking here? you're running Ubuntu, so I assume you have a G3?
2006-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	Do you have another mac?
2006-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	one with a firewire port?
2006-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	ah, that was going to be my suggestion.
2006-01-08T10:02:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	through the magic of 'mac-fdisk -l', lol
2006-01-08T10:02:00.000Z	veklita	silverpower	doesn't list it
2006-01-08T10:03:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	my bad! mac-fdisk -l /dev/hda
2006-01-08T10:04:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	no /dev/hda? that's a problem.
2006-01-08T10:04:00.000Z	veklita	silverpower	 that command gives me a "can't open file" error
2006-01-08T10:04:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	Oh, boy. That's not good.
2006-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	hmm. /dev/hdc is showing your CD drive.
2006-01-08T10:10:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	In Linux, yes. In Darwin, it should work.
2006-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	Maybe. Does it show up as a valid Firewire device normally?
2006-01-08T10:19:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	are you in Darwin or Ubuntu atm?
2006-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	Oh, FUN.
2006-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	Try connecting your other machine via Firewire.
2006-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	veklita	silverpower	i'd have to restart
2006-01-08T10:22:00.000Z	silverpower	veklita	well, it's worth a shot. mount the remote machine read/write and pray. :)
