2007-01-14T13:54:00.000Z	gendor		can anyone help?
2007-01-14T13:54:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	what's your problem?
2007-01-14T13:55:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	also, are you running as root?
2007-01-14T13:56:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	yes. Are you using Gnome?
2007-01-14T13:56:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	open Terminal and type "sudo nautilus /mydirectory" (no quotes and replace the dir with yours)
2007-01-14T13:57:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	which directory, the one I want to change?
2007-01-14T13:57:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	yes
2007-01-14T13:57:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	or you could browse to it if you just type "sudo nautilus"
2007-01-14T14:00:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	then just set the permissions like you normally would. If you typed sudo, you're running as root.
2007-01-14T14:04:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	what partition is it? Could you be trying to edit the permissions of a read-only one, like your NTFS partition?
2007-01-14T14:08:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	sorry then, I'm not sure what your problem is, unless you lost your permissions to your own home directory.
2007-01-14T14:09:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	ok thanks :)
2007-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	sorry I couldn't help
2007-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	You know I can change permissions on everything except the shared folder.
2007-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	what happens if you stop sharing it? Can you change it then?
2007-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	I can't stop sharing it.  The change won't stick.
2007-01-14T14:11:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	ah, I see.
2007-01-14T14:11:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	you should try the chmod command
2007-01-14T14:11:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	Can I stop sharing through the terminal?
2007-01-14T14:18:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	Ok I actually fixed it on my own. :)
2007-01-14T14:18:00.000Z	yurimxpxman	gendor	awesome! What was the problem?
2007-01-14T14:19:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	I deleted a line in the nfs configuration file that had the directory listed.  Restarted the nfs server.  Now it works.
2007-01-14T14:19:00.000Z	gendor	yurimxpxman	Thanks for the help anyhow.  I learned a lot.
