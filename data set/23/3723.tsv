2008-02-10T12:27:00.000Z	iDivine		Say I unzipped something, How would I install it?
2008-02-10T12:27:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	depends whats inside
2008-02-10T12:28:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	but what kind of file was in the zip when you unzipped it
2008-02-10T12:29:00.000Z	iDivine	macogw	Yes
2008-02-10T12:29:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	that was a question
2008-02-10T12:30:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	and what's in it?
2008-02-10T12:30:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	a .run? .sh? .deb?
2008-02-10T12:31:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	yes
2008-02-10T12:31:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	are there a bunch of files in the directory or just one?
2008-02-10T12:31:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	is one named "configure"?
2008-02-10T12:32:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	is there one that's *just* "configure"?
2008-02-10T12:32:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	or maybe one called "autogen"?
2008-02-10T12:32:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	oh ok use that
2008-02-10T12:32:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	sudo ./INSTALL.sh
2008-02-10T12:33:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	or whatever...it's case sensitive, put ./ at the front of it
2008-02-10T12:35:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	are you in the same directory as the installer file?
2008-02-10T12:37:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	cd to wherever it is
2008-02-10T12:37:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	if you type "ls" you can get a listing of what's where you are
2008-02-10T12:38:00.000Z	iDivine	macogw	I seem to see desktop, But the cd /desktop doesn't seem not to work?
2008-02-10T12:39:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	case sensitive
2008-02-10T12:39:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	oh yeah and your home drive is in /home/you/ so putting /desktop would be way different than /home/you/Desktop/
2008-02-10T12:45:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	by the way, you can type the first couple letters of file or directory names and hit tab, and itll fill in the rest, so you can avoid tedious copying
2008-02-10T14:03:00.000Z	macogw	iDivine	which one do you want to get rid of?  you just uncheck "kde" and "kde4" from synaptic and hit apply, as far as i know, but #kubuntu's a better place to ask as they actually know about kde
