2009-07-08T11:05:00.000Z	syroth		can anyone help me with grub? im so close yet so far
2009-07-08T11:06:00.000Z	syroth		i already did ask a few times... does that mean i should repeat?
2009-07-08T11:08:00.000Z	syroth		two drives. sata and regular ide, ide= hda, hda1 was xp, not now, hda2 is ubuntu, sda1 is now xp, sata was added recently, I cant figure out what to tell grub to install to
2009-07-08T11:09:00.000Z	syroth		i figure if i guess wrong then the first 512 of the xp install is gone, not a huge deal but i want to try to save me the trouble of reinstalling. again
2009-07-08T11:10:00.000Z	syroth		to confuse things more for me, on my original  devices.map hd0 is labled as /dev/sda
2009-07-08T11:11:00.000Z	syroth		which is a drive that WAS NOT there last time i booted kubuntu
2009-07-08T11:11:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	what OS does "sda" carry?
2009-07-08T11:13:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	yes. did you install or copy XP to SATA?
2009-07-08T11:14:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	you can install grub on any of the drives, and i'd recommend putting it on hda since that's where linux is.
2009-07-08T11:16:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	oldude67: no, XP will be fine as long as you point to it - it'd be chained in a way
2009-07-08T11:18:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	even if it's not (hd0,0), you can tinker around with grub's shell to find out the exact one
2009-07-08T11:19:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	grub supports autocomplete (the tab key) like bash does, so that should help you figure out what it is if not hd0,0
2009-07-08T11:20:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	yes, there's an option to jump to the shell in grub. it's probably called command line or something
2009-07-08T11:47:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	there is a chainload command. let me look up the syntax

2009-07-08T11:49:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	i think i did
2009-07-08T11:51:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	yes, these are all grub commands.
2009-07-08T11:53:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	if grub is gone, you might want to restore it - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2009-07-08T11:57:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	does /dev/hda exist?
2009-07-08T11:59:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	Ubuntu might be calling that /dev/hda something else. Names are not tied to the drives..
2009-07-08T11:59:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	blkid
2009-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	yes, run that in Ubuntu to see a list of partitions. If /dev/hda isn't present, it's being called something else.
2009-07-08T12:02:00.000Z	dragon_	syroth	you're welcome, and good luck.
