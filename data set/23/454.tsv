2011-08-16T12:10:00.000Z	m_rite		hey guys. any idea how to get a second keyboard running on my machine? i'm working with a friend who sits beside me. it would be cool if he could just use the second keyboard and type away
2011-08-16T12:11:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	well I could only offer advice that would have both working in the same field so I think this is not what you want
2011-08-16T12:12:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	what do you mean, field?
2011-08-16T12:13:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	it would be recieving input from both keyboards as if they were one
2011-08-16T12:13:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	yes, that's the plan
2011-08-16T12:13:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	have you tried pluggin them both in at the same time?
2011-08-16T12:14:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	ok, one moment, This may take me a moment as i am currently compiling a new kernel
2011-08-16T12:14:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	ok
2011-08-16T12:15:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	can you give me a teaser to what your idea is?
2011-08-16T12:17:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	I am going to plug a spar into my machine and see if I can remember how I did this before
2011-08-16T12:17:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	ok, awesome, thanks
2011-08-16T12:18:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	are both USB or is one PS/2?
2011-08-16T12:19:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	both identical USB
2011-08-16T12:19:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	are both plugged in right now?
2011-08-16T12:20:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	yes
2011-08-16T12:20:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	can you give me a paste bin of lsusb?
2011-08-16T12:22:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	they're working now
2011-08-16T12:22:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	well done
2011-08-16T12:22:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	i don't know why but they do. i replugged the second one and it works, awesome
2011-08-16T12:23:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	ls also has other uses
2011-08-16T12:23:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	I would look into it if I were you but enjoy your new found duplicity
2011-08-16T12:24:00.000Z	m_rite	JoeR1	i will, thanks. I'm gonna reboot and see if it still works then
2011-08-16T12:24:00.000Z	JoeR1	m_rite	ok good luck
