2009-08-23T11:44:00.000Z	DefTone		Does anyone how i can fix my audio??
2009-08-23T11:45:00.000Z	DefTone		no i just installed 9.04 and the moment it rebooted it started making this constant bleeping noise.....
2009-08-23T11:46:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	It sounds like you need to configure your sound driver. Is it an intel-hda chip?
2009-08-23T11:46:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Which computer do you have?
2009-08-23T11:48:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Yeah, I was just checking up on something
2009-08-23T11:48:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	gksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2009-08-23T11:48:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Add the following: snd_hda_intel model=hp-dv5
2009-08-23T11:49:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Save the file, and reboot it. I had the same issue with my current laptop, but that required a different setting - it might not work, as there are so. many. different. settings.
2009-08-23T11:49:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Report back to me to let me know if it worked afterwards :)
2009-08-23T11:49:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	You might need to try model=hp instead.
2009-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	DefTone	MenZa	It didn't work bud....sounds like a rave going on in my lappy.
2009-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	DefTone	MenZa	on that same file?
2009-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Yes.
2009-08-23T11:54:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1043568 <- Try having a look at this thread.
2009-08-23T11:54:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	I had to go through about 10 different 'models' before mine stopped with the high-pitched noice. I use 'stack', iirc.
2009-08-23T11:55:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	It's alsa-base.conf
2009-08-23T12:11:00.000Z	DefTone	MenZa	u there ?
2009-08-23T12:11:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Yep
2009-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Any news?
2009-08-23T12:14:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	And you changed it in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf, yes?
2009-08-23T12:15:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Keep trying some items in the list I sent you a minute ago. It could be any of them, really.
2009-08-23T12:16:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	Yes
2009-08-23T12:19:00.000Z	MenZa	DefTone	There really isn't much to do, other than try as many as you can.
