2006-07-15T16:47:00.000Z	sysdoc		Anyone have any problem with the update for xserver-xorg-core (1:1.0.2-0ubuntu10) to 1:1.0.2-0ubuntu10.1? I have been crashing X on the screensaver ever since the update yesterday.
2006-07-15T11:42:00.000Z	sysdoc		Has anyone had any trouble with xserver-xorg-core when upgrading from 10.0 to 10.1? X crashes and restarts when the screensaver kicks in. Can't even go into the screensaver settings to turn it off without X doing the face plant...
2006-07-15T11:43:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	weird.   try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-07-15T11:45:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	I have the nvidia driver installed, not liking the looks of dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg...
2006-07-15T11:45:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	that works fine, all you do is choose nvidia as your driver in the selection screen, I did it and worked fine for me
2006-07-15T11:56:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	anyother ideas? Screensaver still brings down X.
2006-07-15T11:57:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	dang weird.  I have no idea, I would either kill your screensaver (your graphics may not support it) or just revert to older x
2006-07-15T11:58:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	I would like to revert back to the older X, what would be the easiest way to accomplish that?
2006-07-15T11:58:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	Through synaptic,  Find the package you installed to upgrade and remove it, that should work.
2006-07-15T11:59:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	that's a shot in the dark though, so I would try looking on ubuntuforums.org first
2006-07-15T11:59:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	Yea thought of that already and if I want to remove xorg I'm left with it ripping out GDM and KDM. Not really wanting that option. Should be a way to just role back the update
2006-07-15T12:00:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	yea I'm not aware of one.  Sorry    : (
2006-07-15T12:00:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	For now I would just disable your screensave
2006-07-15T12:01:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	Can't, just going to the screensaver settings bring down the X server
2006-07-15T12:01:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	oh LOL
2006-07-15T12:01:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	: (
2006-07-15T12:02:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	yea, Ubuntu es borked!
2006-07-15T12:02:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	i guess... I've never heard of that issue.  nobody else is reporting that error so it oculd be specific to your setup
2006-07-15T12:04:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	ya know it might be a glx thang, cause the screensaver applet loads and then crashes just as the example screen wants to display the sample screen saver
2006-07-15T12:05:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	You could try reverting to the VESA driver  :-/
2006-07-15T12:05:00.000Z	sysdoc	FunnyLookinHat	lol, ummm I'm thinking NOT!
2006-07-15T12:05:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	just a suggestion  : P
2006-07-15T12:05:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	sysdoc	; )
