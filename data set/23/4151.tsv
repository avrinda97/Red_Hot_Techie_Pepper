2007-12-15T23:09:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	just linux server
2007-12-15T23:17:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	as long as you have enough ram
2007-12-15T23:18:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	when you start a live cd, it uses your ram to store stuff
2007-12-15T23:18:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	yes, that is the idea of a live system, to set up a virtual disk on your ram
2007-12-15T23:19:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	what were you planning to do?
2007-12-15T23:20:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	if you have xp first ubuntu should notice it and help you make a dualboot setup
2007-12-15T23:20:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	it should notice both ^^
2007-12-15T23:21:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	well if you want to have a dual boot, you have to install windows first because windows kinda destroy the ubuntu installation if you install ubuntu first
2007-12-15T23:22:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	can't you backup the wow install you have now?
2007-12-15T23:23:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	you can see your windows disk in linux
2007-12-15T23:23:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	do you have one hdd or many?
2007-12-15T23:25:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	you said you had two windows installations now? are they on different partitions?
2007-12-15T23:30:00.000Z	cleaton	FallenStrife	10-12gb for windows and 10-15 depending on how much you are planning to have on your installation. then you could have the rest as a store place for both installations
