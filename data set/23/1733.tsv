2009-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	ArRaY__		hey
2009-11-10T03:30:00.000Z	ArRaY__		my hard drive was part of a raid system some time ago
2009-11-10T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	that may affect stuff
2009-11-10T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	its where files get when they get a bit corrupted and recovered afaik
2009-11-10T03:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	you could format the partitions manually, see if that helps
2009-11-10T03:34:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	did it 3 times in the last 5 mins
2009-11-10T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	you could use a disk scrubber on the ultimate boot cd to wipe the disk completely (inc any raid stuff)
2009-11-10T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	yep, its a swiss army knife of tools
2009-11-10T03:36:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	where do I get it^^
2009-11-10T03:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	www.ultimatebootcd.com
2009-11-10T03:37:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	to time consuming to get it now
2009-11-10T03:37:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	tomorrow perhaps
2009-11-10T03:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	thats ll i can think of if the raid info is breaking stuff
2009-11-10T03:37:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	I am not sure if it is^^
2009-11-10T03:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	could find a bootable disk eraser tool
2009-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	otherwise i'm not sure
2009-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	could I just copy the contents of the installation disk to the disk and try to boot it?
2009-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	probably not?
2009-11-10T03:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	you could copy the iso to the disk and edit grub2 to boot the ISO file...
2009-11-10T03:39:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	I do not have grub installed currently^^
2009-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArRaY__	you can install it from live cd
2009-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	i will now try to install to my netbook...
2009-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	ArRaY__	ActionParsnip	oh I just restarted to vista
