2012-07-29T05:33:00.000Z	Allanon09		Hello, I have the exact same file permissions on files in two different folders under the same parent but the user is only able to see the contents of one of those folders. Any ideas?
2012-07-29T05:34:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	what are the permissions on the folders themselves?
2012-07-29T05:35:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	you can lsattr on the files
2012-07-29T05:41:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	so no special attributes are set on those files. unless you are reading ls -l wrong i'm not sure what it might be
2012-07-29T05:42:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	I wish... they are literally the same. I dont have selinux installed... i don't have acls enabled
2012-07-29T05:43:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	are they on the same partition? can you touch files in the folders?
2012-07-29T05:44:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	as my user yes, as the user "media" i can't even see them.
2012-07-29T05:45:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	but as this "media" user you can see one folder but not the other?
2012-07-29T05:46:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	I can see every folder. Today I uploaded some data to the server as "me". As media I can see those folders along with everything that was already there. I can't see any of the files in the newly uploaded folders as media.
2012-07-29T05:47:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	but the permissions and ownership of the files that cant be seen are the same as the previous files (ie you setgid on the folder)
2012-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	How do you pm someone?
2012-07-29T05:51:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	pm is discouraged in this channel
2012-07-29T05:54:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	ok. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1116684/
2012-07-29T05:56:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	the folder with the new files is cut off but the files inside seem to have the correct permissions
2012-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	cerebro@gHome:~$ ls -al /media/hardDrive1TB-2/gh/Movies/Children/New Movie/
2012-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	and the "New Movie" folder has permissions cerebro users drwxrwxr-x
2012-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	both have this: drwxrwxr-x 2 cerebro users
2012-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	and how are you accessing these files with the "media" user? direct access or some kind of samba/nfs thing?
2012-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	it is done with samba
2012-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	then its probably a misconfiguration of samba
2012-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	media user can access everything else....
2012-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	escott	Allanon09	maybe there is a weird character in the folder name that samba chokes on. but i would suspect something with the samba stack
2012-07-29T06:05:00.000Z	Allanon09	escott	ok.. i will poke around samba some more toight. Thanks for looking at taht stuff for me
