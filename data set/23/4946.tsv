2007-04-06T12:44:00.000Z	coolness9		Hey there, can someone tell me how to remove a file via the terminal
2007-04-06T12:44:00.000Z	coolness9		del, remove ?
2007-04-06T12:44:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	rm file
2007-04-06T12:47:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	force remove doesn't prompt you, directory remove removes a directory, rm -f is a force removal rm -r is a directory removal, or you combine them rm -rf to do a force directory removal
2007-04-06T12:54:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	none
2007-04-06T12:56:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	if you want to be really cool use "sudo apt-get install program" from the command line and "apt-cache search program" or "apt-cache show program" to search
2007-04-06T12:56:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	and no to your other question
2007-04-06T12:57:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	you said what was the difference between installing from them, there is no difference between how they install stuff
2007-04-06T12:57:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	yeah pretty much, synaptic is a graphical front end for apt-get
2007-04-06T12:58:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	don't run them at the same time though
2007-04-06T12:58:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	rpm maybe?
2007-04-06T12:59:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	rpm is red hat package manager, it is not used in ubuntu and other debian distros, it is used in distros like fedora or suse
2007-04-06T12:59:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	it has to do with a different way the program is packaged, ubuntu uses debs and fedora and suse and some of the others use rpms
2007-04-07T11:35:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	it reads from the $PATH if you don't specify otherwise
2007-04-07T11:35:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	do "echo $PATH" to see where those places are
2007-04-07T11:35:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	you specify when you do the ./
2007-04-07T11:48:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	yeah that was the line I was talking about
2007-04-07T11:49:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	gksudo gedit /etc/environment
2007-04-09T08:28:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	sbin is stuff that is essential for the system to run, the really important stuff, bin is less important stuff
2007-04-09T08:29:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	I think the official distinction is that sbin is system binaries, and bin is command binaries
2007-04-09T08:36:00.000Z	coolness9	bruenig	how does the /usr/bin different /bin ?
2007-04-09T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	/bin is stuff that is needed in single user mode, /usr/bin is stuff that isn't
2007-04-09T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	coolness9	same thing, user binaries, usually daemons
