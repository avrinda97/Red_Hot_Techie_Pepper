2005-07-15T15:50:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		hey guys, NeoGeo64 says he has mplayer, mozilla-mplayer, and w32codecs, but can't play realplayer stuff in mplayer.  Anyone know how that could be?
2005-07-15T15:51:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		ugh.  Today is not a good day for #ubuntu
2005-07-15T15:52:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		god damnit, stupid AOLers
2005-07-15T15:52:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		what is their problem?
2005-07-15T15:53:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		where's our admins...
2005-07-15T15:54:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		oops, that was for Maneiten
2005-07-15T15:54:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	won't that fuck up everything depening on libc6 (as in alot)?
2005-07-15T15:55:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	What if I get the .deb from ubuntu and install it using dpkg -i? :)
2005-07-15T15:56:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Maneiten	Well I know there's a way to get apt-get or synaptic to install the proper version of it, over whatever you put on, and if something breaks dependencies it uninstalls all the things that need it
2005-07-15T15:56:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	Do you know how? :)
2005-07-16T16:00:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	Did you catch the last question?
2005-07-16T16:00:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Maneiten	no, there's too many questions and I can't really keep up, sorry
2005-07-16T16:00:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	I see. Just wanted to know if you knew how to do what you mentioned
2005-07-16T16:01:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Maneiten	no, I don't, but an instance where someone did that is documented on the forums, let me find it
2005-07-16T16:01:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	thanks :)
2005-07-16T16:01:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Maneiten	we're talking about installing an older .deb, right?
2005-07-16T16:03:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	We're talking about installing the libc6-version from the ubuntu resp. over a manually installed .deb file from the debian resp.
2005-07-16T16:04:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	Using Debians libc6 version on a ubuntu system obviousley isn't a good idea
2005-07-16T16:04:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Maneiten	okay, I found the forum post.  In it, they fix kubuntu-desktop by saying sudo apt-get install konversation=0.16-1ubuntu1 .  Find the version that you want to install, and um, force it over using the = sign perhaps..   I don't really know a lot about this though
2005-07-16T16:05:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	thanks, i'll try
2005-07-16T16:06:00.000Z	Maneiten	tiglionabbit	Thanks! ;)
2005-07-16T16:06:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Maneiten	did it work?
2005-07-16T16:08:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Maneiten	you should be able to get java from hoary-extras
