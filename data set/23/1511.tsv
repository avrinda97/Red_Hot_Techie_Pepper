2010-03-05T05:45:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	yes promoe as an xmms2 client
2010-03-05T05:43:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 Does it not make a sound... or does it not react when you press play (like the seeker doesn't move)
2010-03-05T05:43:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	It doesnt do anything when i push play
2010-03-05T05:44:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 Since when has it been doing that? Did it work before?
2010-03-05T05:44:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	I just installed linux and promoe for the first time today
2010-03-05T05:45:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 promoe?
2010-03-05T05:46:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 Does it play MP3 files without the frontend? Like does it play in CLI?
2010-03-05T05:46:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	I am running kubuntu if that makes a difference
2010-03-05T05:46:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	it will play mp3's in amarok
2010-03-05T05:48:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 Does XMMS2 play MP3 _from CLI_... without using the Promoe frontend?
2010-03-05T05:48:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	hold on i will try
2010-03-05T05:50:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	no it doesnt play from the cli
2010-03-05T05:52:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 Did it play MP3 files before pomore was installed? Does it play any other formats apart from MP3?
2010-03-05T05:52:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	I didnt try it before. I installed them at the same time. I will try another type of file
2010-03-05T05:54:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	it doesnt play avi files
2010-03-05T05:55:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 I thought xmms2 was for audio playback only? how about ogg files? Those are supported by default, without extra codec packages.
2010-03-05T05:55:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	All I have is mp3 and a couple avi files
2010-03-05T05:56:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 I'm not sure :/ maybe you'll have to examine it's configuration file.
2010-03-05T05:58:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	thats probably over my head one day into linux. I will try to utfse about the config file real quick. u seem to be a busy man
2010-03-05T05:59:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 utsfe? I'm not too busy  haha
2010-03-05T05:59:00.000Z	ronnie	NewWorld	use the fucking search engine.
2010-03-05T05:59:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 I could tell you the same thing.
2010-03-05T06:00:00.000Z	NewWorld	ronnie	 I thought it was a typo.
