2011-05-03T09:19:00.000Z	Herbs	nabi	source always comers before mount point
2011-05-03T09:20:00.000Z	Herbs	nabi	easiest way to mount samba shares is using autofs then you can mount them by cd to the dir
2011-05-03T09:24:00.000Z	nabi	Herbs	when I try mount .. get me, wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on sbm:.......
2011-05-03T09:25:00.000Z	Herbs	nabi	I usually get around that by using autofs for samba
2011-05-03T09:25:00.000Z	Herbs	nabi	but make sure you have smbfs installed try dpkg -l | grep smbfs
2011-05-03T09:26:00.000Z	nabi	Herbs	yes, here in output
2011-05-03T09:28:00.000Z	Herbs	nabi	ok install automount apt-get install automount
2011-05-03T09:30:00.000Z	nabi	Herbs	unable to locate package automount
2011-05-03T09:31:00.000Z	Herbs	nabi	sorry autofs :)
