2005-05-09T16:05:00.000Z	nakata		mikelds: in your fstab options add "gid=<group gid>"
2005-05-09T16:05:00.000Z	nakata		for that disc
2005-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	nakata		that's how "viruses happen (tm)"

2005-05-09T16:09:00.000Z	nakata	Zerboxx	certain your cdrom is on hda?
2005-05-09T16:09:00.000Z	nakata		that's your primary master disc, isn't it?
2005-05-09T16:10:00.000Z	nakata		euh
2005-05-09T16:10:00.000Z	nakata		well, if you're sure it's not mounted then, i suggest a paperclip in the 'force eject' hole on the front
2005-05-09T16:11:00.000Z	nakata		but i doubt it's actually unmounted
2005-05-09T16:11:00.000Z	nakata		fwiw
