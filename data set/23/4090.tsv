2009-06-17T23:53:00.000Z	sfears	dajhorn	there was no cdrom group in there, I added, would that cause the problem?
2009-06-17T23:55:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	By default, on Ubuntu, regular users cannot write into a burner unless they are a member of the "cdrom" system group.
2009-06-17T23:56:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	The group file is /etc/group.  You need to see a line like "cdrom:x:24:sfears" before burning programs will work.
2009-06-17T23:56:00.000Z	sfears	dajhorn	i'll give it a try. i have successfully used it many times before.  all of a sudden i got this error
2009-06-17T23:56:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	You can kludge the permissions by running the burning software through sudo or gksudo.

2009-06-17T23:58:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	What do `ls -l /dev/cdrw` and `ls -l /dev/sr0` say?

2009-06-18T00:01:00.000Z	sfears	dajhorn	i will assume for now that this is an extremly complicated fix
2009-06-18T00:01:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	You can fix this with the `vigr` command, but you'll need to understand the /etc/group syntax.
2009-06-18T00:02:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	If you want more help, then pastebin the /etc/group and /etc/group- files.
2009-06-18T00:02:00.000Z	sfears	dajhorn	hold
2009-06-18T00:06:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	It looks like you installed some non-Ubuntu software that may have changed this file in an unwholesome way.
2009-06-18T00:07:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	All you should need to do is change "cdrom:x:1006:sfears" back to "cdrom:x:24:sfears
2009-06-18T00:07:00.000Z	sfears	dajhorn	sounds far too easy, i'll give it a try
2009-06-18T00:07:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	and reboot.
2009-06-18T00:07:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	You also need to change the shadow file, which is /etc/group-
2009-06-18T00:08:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	That is a dash on the end of group.
2009-06-18T00:10:00.000Z	sfears	dajhorn	when i added the group cdrom it added in as 1006.. will that change on reboot or should i make a change to that as well
2009-06-18T00:11:00.000Z	dajhorn	sfears	The cdrom group will still exist after reboot.  You're just changing the group number from 1006 to 24.  Everything under the hood uses the number, the name is just for convience.
