2009-03-17T23:57:00.000Z	jacksparrow		hey guys, where can I get the latest 9.04 pre-release to test it and help developing?
2009-03-17T23:58:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/jaunty/alpha6
2009-03-17T23:58:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	thx
2009-03-17T23:58:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	Alternately, if you're running 8.10, update-manager -d in terminal will do it for you.
2009-03-17T23:58:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	the ubuntu page is actually complicated
2009-03-17T23:59:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	will I be able to boot both then?
2009-03-17T23:59:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	Both?
2009-03-17T23:59:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	8.04 and 9.04, will I be able to choose which one to boot?
2009-03-17T23:59:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	If you update with update-manager, your current Ubuntu is upgraded to it.
2009-03-18T00:00:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	If you install with the CD, you can make a new partition for 9.04 to keep 8.04.
2009-03-18T00:00:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	I think it may be useful to keep the old version
2009-03-18T00:01:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	Then download the CD and use it =P
2009-03-18T00:01:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	jup, thx
2009-03-18T00:02:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	btw, what is the most intelligent way to install a new iso without burning a cd?
2009-03-18T00:02:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	It would be to burn the CD =P
2009-03-18T00:03:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	Helpful to keep a CD in case you need it.
2009-03-18T00:04:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	okay :D.. another question: could it be useful to use VMs to test 9.04 or would you suggest it on real hardware?
2009-03-18T00:04:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	If you can VM it, just do that for now. It's only an Alpha release.
2009-03-18T00:05:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	so you think that bugs in VMs will also be useful for real machines then
2009-03-18T00:06:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	The issue is that an alpha release might have damaging bugs (as people report data loss with ext4 and such)
2009-03-18T00:07:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	what about kvm?
2009-03-18T00:07:00.000Z	keepsake	jacksparrow	I don't know, I'm not very experienced with VM's, sorry.
2009-03-18T00:08:00.000Z	jacksparrow	keepsake	I'll try it out, thx
