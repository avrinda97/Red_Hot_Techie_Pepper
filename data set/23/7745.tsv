2005-05-13T08:14:00.000Z	josh42		Can anyone tell me how to do an OSX-style panel along the top? (EG: a panel that gets replaced by the file/edit/view menus of the current app) - I know gnome used to do it..
2005-05-13T08:15:00.000Z	josh42		warty - Thankfully, you chose the best version
2005-05-13T08:16:00.000Z	josh42		warty - it's easy to use, nice, and has an awesome community

2005-05-22T06:06:00.000Z	josh42	zenlunatic	It was my point that you can prove how bad big companies are, and I was using that movie as an example of proof
2005-05-22T06:06:00.000Z	zenlunatic	josh42	I see.
2005-05-22T06:06:00.000Z	zenlunatic	josh42	I like how chomsky says they're private tyrannies.
