2010-08-20T21:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	http://spamassassin.apache.org/  it's for the Mail Server, not a mail client.
2010-08-20T21:10:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	I was speaking of Mail server...
2010-08-20T21:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	see Docs, and FAQ
2010-08-20T21:10:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	Yeah
2010-08-20T21:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	but it's pretty good filter.
2010-08-20T21:11:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	you have to teach it :-)
2010-08-20T21:12:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	Oh..
2010-08-20T21:17:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	without a mail server, you have nothing to test against, so yes, you need PostFix or some level of mail Server.
2010-08-20T21:18:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	Well at my institute we have a mail server on OpenSuse
2010-08-20T21:18:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	magnetro: please wait.. i'll give more details
2010-08-20T21:19:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	each Distro is a bit different, but here's a how-too i've marked for reference: http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/
2010-08-20T21:22:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	magnetro: Firewall has to be configurable for controlling the network activity. Suse linux 10 is used as mail server and Squid Proxy for sharing internet among users. The FTP service should be enabled for accessing the network folder. Also the solution for the intranet system, mail management and backup is required.
2010-08-20T21:22:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	magnetro: Spam filter has to filter all the inboxes created on the mail server. The mail server is configured in the campus but mails get forwarded from the hosted site. It should be configurable for blocking or enabling the mails from the specific domain. The list of the spam mails should be displayed with option of temporary release of any mail from the spam list.
2010-08-20T21:22:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	magnetro: That's all
2010-08-20T21:23:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	That's about all I cna go ito in the general help section, you probably better off in the #ubuntu-server channel for specific server configureaitons.
2010-08-20T21:23:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	Oh
2010-08-20T21:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	and addiontally, your server is not Ubuntu, so they may not be able to help there either, you could try opensuse channel
2010-08-20T21:35:00.000Z	KE1HA	hsr	Create a VBOX, use the server ISO, and make a mail-server to test it with using the links we've provided. Either way yuo need a mail-server to test it on.
2010-08-20T21:35:00.000Z	hsr	KE1HA	Thats what i,m doing
