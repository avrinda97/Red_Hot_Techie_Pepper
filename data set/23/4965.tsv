2007-03-29T12:22:00.000Z	Haekke		Can somebody help me why gparted shows my disk has 24gb left, but when I look under places choosing my harddisk it says 1.1gb free??
2007-03-29T12:22:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	everything on one partition ?
2007-03-29T12:23:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	try df at terminal
2007-03-29T12:24:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	& Pelo: just a sec
2007-03-29T12:26:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	& Pelo: take a look at this.. isnt something wrong? : http://11dem.dk/ubuntu/Screenshot.png
2007-03-29T12:49:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	it's probably for ext3's purposes
2007-03-29T12:50:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	like its reserving 24gb for ext3 purposes?
2007-03-29T12:51:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	i'm thinking so
2007-03-29T12:51:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	can I reconfigure that somehow? 1gig for anything should be more than enough?
2007-03-29T12:53:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	do you know a way to fix this?
2007-03-29T12:53:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	maybe disable ext3's journaling option ?
2007-03-29T12:54:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	my root partition has 15 gb, currently 0.8 gb is "missing"
2007-03-29T13:05:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	I figured out its ext3 by default reserves about 5% for superuser purposes.
2007-03-29T13:05:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	:)
2007-03-29T13:06:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	but I kinda dont know how to remove that part :/
2007-03-29T13:06:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	if ext3 developers make it like that, there's got to be a reason, don't mess with it
2007-03-29T13:06:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	after all you have 475 gb left don't you ?
2007-03-29T13:07:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	hehe thats only for the next hour. moving about 2tb and adding drives. just need to figure this out as i need the space
2007-03-29T13:28:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	& Pelo: Rooy fixed my problem. Simple fix for future reference: tune2fs -m "percentage" (eg. 0) /dev/sdb1 . Thanks to you 2 guys aswell for trying
2007-03-29T13:28:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	cheers!
2007-03-29T13:30:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	anyway. was it you talking about symlinks?
2007-03-29T13:30:00.000Z	yell0w	Haekke	no, ext3 journaling
2007-03-29T13:31:00.000Z	Haekke	yell0w	ok maybe it was Pelo then. just need to know how they work
