2007-04-15T12:14:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	techically its most users who are fubar!
2007-04-15T12:18:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	lets stop talking to him alright? do whats right.
2007-04-15T12:18:00.000Z	Nubbie	wizard	mmkay. somebody should ban the troll though.
2007-04-15T12:19:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	they will get to him, the last thing you want is to be on a ban along with him for fueling his fire even higher.
2007-04-15T12:21:00.000Z	Nubbie	wizard	i don't think beryl is beta anymore... they've had a major release i believe.
2007-04-15T12:21:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	oh.. well then it just runs like butt for me  lol
2007-04-15T12:22:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	its still a 0.x.x relesae 0.o
2007-04-15T12:22:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	iunno if i'd call that a final version yet.
2007-04-15T12:23:00.000Z	Nubbie	wizard	is that so... but consider banshee.... 0.12.1 the major release is version 12.
2007-04-15T12:23:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	the way i see it with beryl is its still very infant.. perhaps this is the most stable releases of their betas?? but far from a good final choice...
2007-04-15T12:39:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	in beta 6 its just by right clicking
2007-04-15T12:41:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	not many things are very active on xfce :-P
2007-04-15T12:41:00.000Z	Nubbie	wizard	shhh! they might be offended.
2007-04-15T12:41:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	it tried to kill me once, so i don't get along with it well lol
2007-04-15T12:42:00.000Z	Nubbie	wizard	personally i prefer either a really rich environment, or a really basic environment, xfce being in the middle just doesn't make sense.
2007-04-15T12:52:00.000Z	Nubbie	wizard	the glass may be 2 feet thick, in which case GOOD LUCK buddy ;)
2007-04-15T12:52:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	ever read teh book?
2007-04-15T12:53:00.000Z	Nubbie	wizard	i'm not too concerened about wifi safety, as my computer is wired, and my wifi in the house is WPA2 secured.
2007-04-15T12:54:00.000Z	wizard	Nubbie	i live in the middle of nowhere so unless deer have laptops i simply don't care
