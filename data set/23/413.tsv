2011-09-27T05:17:00.000Z	aosur		How can I resume mirroring with wget?
2011-09-27T05:18:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	use wget -c ....
2011-09-27T05:18:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	I tried that, but the problem was, it wasn't downloading links from pages that had already been downloaded.
2011-09-27T05:19:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	So basically, for any file where it would give "The file is already fully retrieved", it would not add the links from that file to the queue for mirroring.
2011-09-27T05:20:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	yes, because that file is already download
2011-09-27T05:20:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	*downloaded
2011-09-27T05:21:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	The problem is, the files linked from that file aren't already downloaded. So I'm getting an incomplete mirror. However, I've already downloaded a few hundred MB (a few hours of waiting) and I don't want to remirror the whole site to get those links.
2011-09-27T05:21:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	is that an htm file?
2011-09-27T05:22:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	Which one? There are htms, pdfs, MS Word, images, maybe other stuff.
2011-09-27T05:22:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	and where does it link to? another domain?
2011-09-27T05:22:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	What I'm running is wget -mk -t 5 --no-parent -c http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/ .
2011-09-27T05:23:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	So I'm trying to get all of the files that are in http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2.
2011-09-27T05:23:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	wait a min, i'll check that link
2011-09-27T05:23:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	Ok, thanks.
2011-09-27T05:25:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	you need all the doc in that site, or you want to mirror that?
2011-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	Both.
2011-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	because some of the link links to another domain, and with --no-parrent, I doubt wget can download that kind of link
2011-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	Well, it was working fine, until it got interrupted and I needed to resume it afterwards.
2011-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	try without --no-parrent, hope it helps
2011-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	So apparently the type of website works fine, but the resuming doesn'tâ€¦
2011-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	Ok. Thanks.
2011-09-27T05:32:00.000Z	aosur	Stanley00	That worked, thanks!
2011-09-27T05:32:00.000Z	Stanley00	aosur	you are welcome :)
