2007-07-19T16:54:00.000Z	golam		anybody know what is the command to write data into a blank CD
2007-07-19T16:54:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	golam	cdrecord but you'll need to build an iso first IIRC
2007-07-19T16:54:00.000Z	golam		hmm thanks let me try
2007-07-19T16:55:00.000Z	golam		sorry I did not understand
2007-07-19T16:56:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	golam	you're better off using a grphical program such as k3b
2007-07-19T16:56:00.000Z	golam		I am usung gnome
2007-07-19T16:56:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	golam	you can run k3b on gnome.
2007-07-19T16:57:00.000Z	SlimeyPete		it works fine
2007-07-19T16:58:00.000Z	golam		I have just installed k3b ... let me try it
2007-07-19T05:08:00.000Z	golam		sorry ,,,, but the k3b is not working... at the last moment ..it gave me an error...
2007-07-19T05:08:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	golam	what error?
2007-07-19T05:09:00.000Z	golam		its : "Unable to fixate the disk"
2007-07-19T05:09:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	golam	ah. Try reading from the disc anyway. It might still work.
2007-07-19T05:10:00.000Z	golam		hold on,,,let me try
2007-07-19T05:16:00.000Z	golam	SlimeyPete	sorry,,but k3b is giving me same error
2007-07-19T05:16:00.000Z	golam		And its nearly hang my gnome
2007-07-19T05:18:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	golam	nearly hanging? sounds like a hardware issue, perhaps. You could try Nero, Bonfire, X-CD-Roast or Gnome Toast instead of k3b
2007-07-19T05:18:00.000Z	SlimeyPete		see if they work
2007-07-19T05:19:00.000Z	golam		I am using ubuntu 7.04 under vmware probably thats why but...
2007-07-19T05:20:00.000Z	golam		I tried gnome default one it was also giving me an error
2007-07-19T05:21:00.000Z	golam		and where I can get nero
2007-07-19T05:23:00.000Z	golam	SlimeyPete	thank for your help
