2010-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	obscurant1st	perlmonkey	i need to know whether my cpu supports 64 bit os.
2010-05-25T16:13:00.000Z	perlmonkey	obscurant1st	try cat /proc/cpuinfo to see if it's a 64-bit CPU
2010-05-25T16:13:00.000Z	obscurant1st	perlmonkey	that command gv me clflush size : 64
2010-05-25T16:14:00.000Z	perlmonkey	obscurant1st	uname -m will show you
2010-05-25T16:15:00.000Z	obscurant1st	perlmonkey	it says i686, but its for the kernel info right? my installation is 32 bit!
2010-05-25T16:18:00.000Z	perlmonkey	obscurant1st	it's a 64-bit CPU you got there, you could install 64-bit OS
