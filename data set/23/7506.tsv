2005-12-16T09:51:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	that doesn't really help
2005-12-16T09:51:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	how come?
2005-12-16T09:53:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	A few reasons:  The apt-get line calls for packages that don't exist for an AMD64 user and even then it won't work for totem-xine--which I have to use because gstreamer doesn't work on AMD64 yet
2005-12-16T09:53:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	what seems to be your problem?
2005-12-16T09:53:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	I've enabled every repo, so that isn't a problem
2005-12-16T09:53:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	makes sense, the codecs wont work with amd64
2005-12-16T09:53:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	have you tried installing vlc?
2005-12-16T09:54:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	Yes, but if I try to open a DVD it just sits there and doesn't do anything
2005-12-16T09:55:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	um, then youll have to install libdvdcss2 by hand
2005-12-16T09:55:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	where is it available
2005-12-16T09:56:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	look at the comment by goatboy
2005-12-16T09:57:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	where?
2005-12-16T10:03:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	Ok, I tried it but the .sh errors on me.  Says C compiler can't make executables.
2005-12-16T10:04:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	um, try installing build-essential using synaptic
2005-12-16T10:05:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	Ok, but I manually installed everything it said and I could think of:  gcc, g++, gawk, fakeroot, and debhelper
2005-12-16T10:05:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	can you paste the whole error to pastebin?
2005-12-16T10:07:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	After installing build-essential it built.  Now I'll see if it works
2005-12-16T10:09:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	No joy still, unfortunately
2005-12-16T10:12:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	try rebooting?
2005-12-16T10:12:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	won't hurt I suppose
2005-12-16T10:13:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	It has been a frustrating day.  Windows died, refused to reinstall after probably two dozen attempts, etc, etc, etc
2005-12-16T10:14:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	zen	dont worry... we will get it working. I bet we are more helpful than any windows forum!
2005-12-16T10:18:00.000Z	zen	La_PaRCa	Seems to work after the restart.  Thank you.
