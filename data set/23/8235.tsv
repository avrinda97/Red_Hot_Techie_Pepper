2005-03-31T09:56:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	well maybe they will jog your memory http://www.boreme.com/bm/MAY03/a/t_dh/info_pic1.jpg
2005-03-31T09:57:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	it certainly burned my eye out
2005-03-31T09:58:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	2001 it seems

2005-03-31T10:02:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	you sure make me feel old.. which is pretty strange for 21...
2005-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	I got my arm stuck in it a few times
2005-03-31T10:08:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	well you are probably already running the most used language for every day tasks.. the bash shell.
2005-03-31T10:12:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	bash programming can be very simple like: sleep 30 && rm file
2005-03-31T10:14:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	or another example: for each_file in *.mp3; do rename "new order" "New Order" "$each_file"; done
2005-03-31T10:14:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	it's very useful on a daily basis imho
2005-03-31T10:18:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	it's very hard to define
2005-03-31T10:19:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	a beginning programmer has no intrest in it for sure
2005-03-31T10:35:00.000Z	GammaRay	IcedKiwi	burn the disk and make sure your bios boots from the cd before the disk
