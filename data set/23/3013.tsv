2009-01-03T01:06:00.000Z	FlyingBishop		yes gnome is gtk
2009-01-03T01:06:00.000Z	FlyingBishop		So Ubuntu is basically entirely gtk
2009-01-03T01:08:00.000Z	FlyingBishop		|unjustics|: Are you trying to format root to fat32?
2009-01-03T01:08:00.000Z	|unjustice|	FlyingBishop	yes
2009-01-03T01:08:00.000Z	FlyingBishop		You shouldn't do that
2009-01-03T01:08:00.000Z	FlyingBishop		Use Ext2
2009-01-03T01:08:00.000Z	FlyingBishop		or Ext3
2009-01-03T01:09:00.000Z	FlyingBishop		If you need fat32, make /home fat32
2009-01-03T01:13:00.000Z	|unjustice|	FlyingBishop	should I just make all of them ext2/3? Because it only gives me the option to do /dos or /windows with fat32...but I thought NTFS was windows specific not fat32
2009-01-03T01:14:00.000Z	FlyingBishop	|unjustice|	fat32 doesn't understand Linux permissions, so most software will break if you try to run it off fat32
2009-01-03T01:14:00.000Z	FlyingBishop	|unjustice|	Making a /dos or /windows partition is probably the ideal thing to do.
2009-01-03T01:14:00.000Z	FlyingBishop	|unjustice|	Why do you need fat32?
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|	FlyingBishop	I thought that the linux kernel was compatible with it, but it was a false memory apparently
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|	FlyingBishop	just trying to run ubuntu
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|		yeah, yeah I remember now
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|		my bad
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	FlyingBishop	|unjustice|	Then use ext3
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|		thanks
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|		cool
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|		how big should a /swap file be
2009-01-03T01:15:00.000Z	|unjustice|		?
2009-01-03T01:16:00.000Z	FlyingBishop	|unjustice|	If you have less than 1 gig of memory, twice the amount of ram you have
2009-01-03T01:17:00.000Z	FlyingBishop	|unjustice|	otherwise, I'd go with about equal to the amount of ram you have, since you do want full so you can hibernate
