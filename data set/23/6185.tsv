2006-12-28T14:16:00.000Z	stefg	gili	its called bash, nano and /etc/fstab
2006-12-28T14:16:00.000Z	gili	stefg	i know the command line has it
2006-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	gili		i just want to be able to use nautilus and see all hard drives
2006-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	gili		listed
2006-12-28T14:18:00.000Z	stefg	gili	the GUI for disk-management is not in dapper, because no maintainer, and a different way of mounting drives (uuid-style)
2006-12-28T14:19:00.000Z	gili		what would be a bad idea?
2006-12-28T14:19:00.000Z	gili		i know how to use gparted for quite some time....
2006-12-28T14:19:00.000Z	stefg		!wifi | draegan
2006-12-28T14:20:00.000Z	gili		i know how to use all these partition editing software as well as command lines....
2006-12-28T14:20:00.000Z	gili		pl
2006-12-28T14:20:00.000Z	gili		ok
2006-12-28T14:21:00.000Z	gili		hah
2006-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	gili	stefg	so  you were saying that Edgy has ditched the GUI for disk management....can you elaborate
2006-12-28T14:23:00.000Z	stefg	gili	as i read  there was no maintainer for disk-admin, and since edgy uses a uuid-style fstab noone adapted it to edgy... so it was removed..
