2010-11-06T23:00:00.000Z	dasrot		Can someone please help me with a Remote Desktop/VNC connection to a Ubuntu server... I've followed a lot of guides and the best I can get is a black and white checkerboarded screen when I remote in
2010-11-06T23:01:00.000Z	dasrot		-> /list ?
2010-11-06T23:03:00.000Z	ohspite	dasrot	do you have gnome installed on the server?
2010-11-06T23:03:00.000Z	dasrot		yes
2010-11-06T23:04:00.000Z	dasrot		I dont know what you mean johna
2010-11-06T23:04:00.000Z	dasrot		oh nm
2010-11-06T23:05:00.000Z	ohspite	dasrot	and it's running, and preferences/remote desktop is configured to allow other people to see the desktop?
2010-11-06T23:08:00.000Z	dasrot	ohspite	I've used System - Preferences - Remote Desktop and enabled that, and also downloaded vnc4server, vinagre, vino and xinetd based on some guide, which I seem to connect to this route, but I cant see anything when I remote in on my win7 machine
2010-11-06T23:08:00.000Z	dasrot		using vncserver :1 command
2010-11-06T23:08:00.000Z	ohspite	dasrot	okay--no clue then
2010-11-06T23:09:00.000Z	dasrot		it should just work right?
2010-11-06T23:09:00.000Z	dasrot		with the System - Pref - Remote desktop route?
2010-11-06T23:09:00.000Z	dasrot		i've opened ports on my router and still nothing
2010-11-06T23:09:00.000Z	ohspite	dasrot	yeah, I haven't had those problems
2010-11-06T23:09:00.000Z	dasrot		does Ubuntu come with a built in firewall somewhere that could be blocking incoming connections?
2010-11-06T23:10:00.000Z	dasrot		2
2010-11-06T23:10:00.000Z	dasrot		ok
2010-11-06T23:10:00.000Z	dasrot		I just installed so I dont see how anything can be screwed up, but I guess i'll reinstall and try again
2010-11-06T23:11:00.000Z	dasrot		Ubuntu that is
2010-11-06T23:11:00.000Z	ohspite		!shout | root_
2010-11-06T23:11:00.000Z	dasrot		for as much as people love this stuff... its not that intuitive
2010-11-06T23:11:00.000Z	dasrot		is the work worth the rewards?
2010-11-06T23:12:00.000Z	ohspite	dasrot	you're right, it's not intuitive--until you learn about it and you see why it shouldn't be any other way.  sometimes.
