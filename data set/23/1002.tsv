2011-05-02T14:54:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	it is not that hard to install from alternate cd
2011-05-02T14:54:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	its not difficult, but some find it more intimidating.
2011-05-02T14:55:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	 just not eye  candy that is all
2011-05-02T14:55:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	i'm very familiar with it... and if you've been here any amount f time, there's moer than one user who did not want to use the live cd... so my point was valid.
2011-05-02T14:56:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	 I believe that you are familiar with using alternate cd no argue with you about that
2011-05-02T14:57:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	my point is, its not hard(i agree w/ you there)... however, a new user who knwos nothing about linux partitions, setting up their drive, etc.. it's going to be intimidating
2011-05-02T14:59:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	Ithink that new users ask for more eye candy stuff until now alternate was only able to do upgrade
2011-05-02T15:01:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	the alt cd has been an installer for a long time.
2011-05-17T03:38:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	if its a clean install, install, in theory... dist-upgrade shoudln't do anything
2011-05-17T03:41:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	dist-upgrade will upgrade packages  ;)
2011-05-17T03:41:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	so will sudo apt-get uprade.. your point?
2011-05-17T03:43:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	sometimes packages are hold back and you can get them with apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-05-17T03:43:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	uh, no
2011-05-17T03:44:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	i've asked him that like 40x, he keeps posting other irrelevant stuff
2011-05-17T03:45:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	I saw that and that is the reason why I ask him to do it too
2011-05-17T04:03:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	i wouldn't bother creating a separate /home.. but thats just my personal opinion... i never do.
2011-05-17T04:04:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	I always does and have good experience with that
2011-05-17T04:04:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	lol, i9'm not saying there's not good reason to, i jus tnever do... i keep such thorough backups (including a couple of specific folders in /home... so i can restore them)... it's kinda pointless for me to do it.
2011-05-17T04:05:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	you took different path that is all  :)
2011-05-17T04:05:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	pretty much..t hast what i'm saying, i don't have an issue w/ /home on a separate partition, i've just not found it necessary.. :)
2011-05-17T04:06:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	and if somebody partition for first time I believe it is not good in backup and restore process
2011-05-17T04:07:00.000Z	KM0201	zvacet	by the same token, w/ /home on a separate partition, if they've really whacked something up.. restoring stuff from the old home, could be just as problematic
2011-05-17T04:08:00.000Z	zvacet	KM0201	agree  8-)
