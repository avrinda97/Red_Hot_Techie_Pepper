2010-07-12T23:35:00.000Z	hybridvigour		i am getting ready to install ubuntu on a few IBM ThinkPads (600e, T20, T21, T22, T23, and 770e) i need to suit them up with educational software... any advice before i begin? i.e. which version of ubuntu et cetera
2010-07-12T23:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	You can also install most of the Edubuntu programs into a standard Ubuntu install
2010-07-12T23:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	most if not all of them
2010-07-12T23:39:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	thank you
2010-07-12T23:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	Your welcome
2010-07-12T23:42:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	would the latest version of ubuntu be recommendable for the laptops? or should i use some sort of slimmed down version?
2010-07-12T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	10.04 should be fine,  however propritary Nivida or ATI drivers can really mess up the boot up, only really need those for 3D games or the Compiz Desktp effects though
2010-07-12T23:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	and the educational apps aren't 3D anyway, the ones I have tried :)
2010-07-12T23:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	Gcompris,  Childsplay,  Tuxmath,  Tuxpaint,  loads of good ones :)
2010-07-12T23:44:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	cool, again, thank you
2010-07-12T23:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	and check your ISO before burning contents to CD and using.  to make sure you have a good install and CD
2010-07-12T23:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	so you were  going to install Edubuntu in a school?  you can quite easilly network the computers together from what I have read, but if you join   #edubuntu they can tell you much more about it
2010-07-12T23:49:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	yeah it's in a school and i'll definitely look into the networking aspect. this is great info. super cool.
2010-07-13T23:07:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	are you in here?
2010-07-13T23:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	yes
2010-07-13T23:08:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	hey how's it going? i'm back with a couple more ?? (if you have a moment)
2010-07-13T23:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	ok sure
2010-07-13T23:11:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	thanks. okay so i spent most of the night just looking around and want to install edubuntu. because i'm installing on laptops should i: a) install edubuntu from it's own install cd?; b) install ubuntu and then add edubuntu through repositories?
2010-07-13T23:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	anyway now I have a great suggestion for you,  make sure to give them a Live CD with the lap top, so if something really bad was to happen to it, they could re install :)  Turns out Ubuntu 10.04 can brake and refuse to let anyone log in, happended yesterday or whenever it actsually was to our other computer.   I haven't looked at OS log files to see what might have caused it yet.
2010-07-13T23:13:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	wow, that's crazy. i will for sure make a couple live cd's to send. so are you saying to stay away from 10.04?
2010-07-13T23:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	depends really on a computer, how well Ubuntu runs or doesn't run, and such.  However I also had boot up issues and shut down issues, with 10.04,  and I know what distro I want on there instead really, so going to put that on :)
2010-07-13T23:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	hybridvigour	anyway standard Ubuntu install, then install Edubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu,  games, and what not, in there, that should do it
2010-07-13T23:16:00.000Z	hybridvigour	sebsebseb	great, thanks. keep well. ttl
