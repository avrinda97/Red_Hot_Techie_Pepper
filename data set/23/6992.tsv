2005-11-06T08:45:00.000Z	Nihil85		thanks
2005-11-06T08:46:00.000Z	Nihil85		however, noone can help me?
2005-11-06T08:47:00.000Z	Nihil85		but my system crashed everytime
2005-11-06T08:47:00.000Z	Nihil85		defr, yes
2005-11-06T08:48:00.000Z	Nihil85		I dunno :)
2005-11-06T08:48:00.000Z	Nihil85		because i'm not the only one who "worked" at this pc
2005-11-06T08:49:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	look at the output of 'cat /proc/version'
2005-11-06T08:51:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	just do it. "cat /proc/version"
2005-11-06T08:52:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	so it's the ubuntu kernel
2005-11-06T08:52:00.000Z	Nihil85	topyli	what can i do?
2005-11-06T08:53:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	dunno, sounds like hardware trouble to me. btw, you might want to install a kernel compiled for your processor. you hardly have a 386 :)
2005-11-06T08:54:00.000Z	Nihil85	topyli	i didn't understand you
2005-11-06T08:55:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	the broken hardware part or the kernel part?
2005-11-06T08:55:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	might also be that the proprietary nvidia driver just doesn't like your hardware
2005-11-06T08:56:00.000Z	Nihil85	topyli	the hardware works... now i'm seeing the monitor correctly... i think that the kernel's broken.. also because a friend of mine tried to recompile the kernel because of these problems... but i don't know if he worked correclty
2005-11-06T08:56:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	you're running the ubuntu default kernel, not a custom one
2005-11-06T08:56:00.000Z	Nihil85	topyli	i checked the list of supported hardware... my graphic card is supported
2005-11-06T08:57:00.000Z	topyli	Nihil85	yes, the free nv driver probably supports it. the proprietary driver from nvidia is a black box and we never know :)
2005-11-06T09:04:00.000Z	Nihil85	topyli	i red the page in the forum, but that was what i did
