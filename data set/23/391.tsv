2011-11-07T01:58:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	it is possible. what problem are you having
2011-11-07T01:59:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	and if I clear CMOS (failed OC for instance) I cant boot at all
2011-11-07T01:59:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	sounds like you didnt install the bootloader correctly. what bootloader is installed and where
2011-11-07T02:00:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	grub2 and I did install it
2011-11-07T02:01:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1753717 for example
2011-11-07T02:03:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	so grub2 is probably the wrong choice, you need one of the efi bootloaders and you need to put it into the efi partition in some special way
2011-11-07T02:04:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	which one do I need and how do I put it there?
2011-11-07T02:05:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	there is a grub efi project as well as refit and a few others. some uefi systems can support bios fallback boots and you can use normal grub. i'm not familiar with all the different kinds as I don't have an efi machine
2011-11-07T02:06:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	have you looked at this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting
2011-11-27T03:20:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	/proc/partitions. fdisk cannot understand gpt
2011-11-27T03:21:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	why are you telling me that? :o
2011-11-27T03:22:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	because advising people to use fdisk is inappropriate for some systems
2011-11-27T03:23:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	I know gdisk gives gpt partitions too, but we were talking about a SD-card, do you think that has a GPT partition? no...
2011-11-27T03:24:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	in that case its fine. i wasn't following the chain. i just see a lot of fdisk -l thrown around and its usually people who aren't aware of /proc/partitions
2011-11-30T23:18:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	not all cards can do this. first you need to see if iwconfig will let you put the device into master mode, and then look at !ics
2011-11-30T23:18:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	I know my wifi card can do it
2011-12-01T00:04:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	I thought it should be possible to share an internet connection in Linux
2011-12-01T00:04:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	Ive read that
2011-12-01T00:06:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	it should work, but its more complicated by your desire to run wireless on top of it. i would first get it working with an unencrypted wireless and then look into setting up a wpa server. i have no idea what package that would be
2011-12-18T03:59:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	escott	I already defined that
2011-12-18T04:00:00.000Z	escott	MeQuerSat	you said you want "options" but thats not adequate. what options?
