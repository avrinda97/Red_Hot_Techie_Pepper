2011-11-29T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	_Neytiri_	From a quick look at the RESULTS.txt, try setting your BIOS to boot from sdb.
2011-11-29T08:50:00.000Z	_Neytiri_		sdb and sdc dobst exist inmy bios
2011-11-29T08:50:00.000Z	_Neytiri_		2 raided arrays show up
2011-11-29T08:51:00.000Z	_Neytiri_		the nvidia_afefchef and nvidia_bicabbcd are the only hard drives inmy bios
2011-11-29T08:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	_Neytiri_	Then those are the drives you need to install grub's boot sector to.
