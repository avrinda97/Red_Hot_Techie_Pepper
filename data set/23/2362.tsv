2009-05-23T04:34:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	but now, when I connect the cable, nothing happens. is there something I need to reset?
2009-05-23T04:35:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	nothing will happen you can browse the drive, can you?
2009-05-23T04:35:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	no, I plug the cable and nothing happens
2009-05-23T04:35:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	no /dev/sdc* or anything
2009-05-23T04:36:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	is drive connected to cable?
2009-05-23T04:37:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	if I do fdisk -l it doesn't list it. it did before I deleted /dev/sdc but now nothing
2009-05-23T04:37:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	you using ubuntu? if yes, go to places on your desktop and check for external HD folder
2009-05-23T04:37:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	k
2009-05-23T04:38:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	the mount folder was not there
2009-05-23T04:39:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	the file /dev/sdc suddenly reappeared, but the drive does not get mounted
2009-05-23T04:39:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	you have to manually mount the drive, OR you can logout and log back in and see if it mounts the drive
2009-05-23T04:40:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	you know how to manually add the drive?
2009-05-23T04:41:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdc1 /media/MEDIA but it does not work, because /dev/sdc1 does not exists
2009-05-23T04:41:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	/dev/sdc exists, but I cannot mount that one either
2009-05-23T04:42:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	it's like if it cannot find the partition, although fdisk -l lists it as /dev/sdc1
2009-05-23T04:42:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	but there is no /dev/sdc1
2009-05-23T04:42:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	the problem is probably your HD is not ext3 and it is not mounted
2009-05-23T04:43:00.000Z	Yanick_	harpreet_	no, the HD partition is ntfs for use with another computer which has windows on it
2009-05-23T04:43:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB
2009-05-23T04:44:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	you have to create mount point and manually mount
2009-05-23T04:44:00.000Z	harpreet_	Yanick_	i'll suggest you to start fresh with the process , restart computer without usbhd connected and then connect it and monitor the process if it doesnt mount then follow : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB
