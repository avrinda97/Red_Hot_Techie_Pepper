2006-06-02T16:01:00.000Z	pandamonium		nothing will install or upgrade for some reason
2006-06-02T16:01:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	so what is the error you get?
2006-06-02T16:02:00.000Z	pandamonium	mwe	http can't resolve is the most common
2006-06-02T16:02:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	uhm so you get other errors as well?
2006-06-02T16:03:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	can ping yahoo.com for example? is your sources.list sane?
2006-06-02T16:03:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	yes
2006-06-02T16:03:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	that's normal
2006-06-02T16:03:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	some things cannot coexist
2006-06-02T16:04:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	for example you cannot install several mail servers
2006-06-02T16:05:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	can you paste.ubuntu-nl.org your /etc/apt/sources.list if you still get http errors?
2006-06-02T16:05:00.000Z	pandamonium	mwe	i've uploaded it to some wepspace. paulproteus was looking at it but i don't know if he's had a chance yet
2006-06-02T16:06:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	oh
2006-06-02T16:09:00.000Z	pandamonium	mwe	this is the url http://pastebin.com/752302 notice that the 'Directory of...' is not part of sources.list but is output from the ls of that directory
2006-06-02T16:12:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	I'd remove the gb. part from the mirrors
2006-06-02T16:12:00.000Z	pandamonium	mwe	all of them?
2006-06-02T16:13:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	right. that will redirict you to a good mirror
2006-06-02T16:16:00.000Z	pandamonium	mwe	aren't there ftp mirrors i could use?
2006-06-02T16:17:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	I think they're all http. why would you need ftp mirrors?
2006-06-02T16:18:00.000Z	pandamonium	mwe	because my isp employs transparent http proxies and they're broken
2006-06-02T16:19:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	I don't know any ftp mirrors. maybe they exist though
2006-06-02T16:24:00.000Z	pandamonium	mwe	i just thought of something...
2006-06-02T16:25:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	yes
2006-06-02T16:26:00.000Z	mwe	pandamonium	maybe so
