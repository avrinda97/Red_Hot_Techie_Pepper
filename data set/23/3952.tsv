2007-12-31T07:31:00.000Z	mint		I am using nautilus
2007-12-31T07:32:00.000Z	mint		I just dragged the files over and they appeared instantly... but I have no way of seeing if it is done or not!!
2007-12-31T07:32:00.000Z	mint		there is no progress bar
2007-12-31T07:32:00.000Z	mint		and some of the files are still a size of zero
2007-12-31T07:32:00.000Z	mint		I'm not dumb
2007-12-31T07:33:00.000Z	mint		and NO, they are not symlinks

2007-12-31T07:33:00.000Z	corvvs	mint	dragged them in your file manager? nautilus, I presume?
2007-12-31T07:33:00.000Z	mint		sigh, I'll just do mv -i
2007-12-31T07:34:00.000Z	mint		I hate silly file managers that have important crap toggled off
2007-12-31T07:34:00.000Z	mint	corvvs	yes.
2007-12-31T07:34:00.000Z	mint		I am on the ubuntu live CD
2007-12-31T07:34:00.000Z	mint		backing up laptop data to a network drive so I can install over it
2007-12-31T07:34:00.000Z	corvvs	mint	nautilus does have a progress bar -- it should be in your window list, try finding it and clicking on it
2007-12-31T07:35:00.000Z	corvvs	mint	oh, on the live cd? well, I'm assuming it works the same way...
2007-12-31T07:36:00.000Z	mint		eh, I'm just doing mv -i
2007-12-31T07:36:00.000Z	mint		lol
2007-12-31T07:36:00.000Z	corvvs		!irc
2007-12-31T07:36:00.000Z	mint		I dont have time to deal with it
