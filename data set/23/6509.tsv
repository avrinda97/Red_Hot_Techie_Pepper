2006-03-25T17:31:00.000Z	Karmander	Wallakoala	so why it stops
2006-03-25T17:31:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	what kind of computer are yu installing it on?
2006-03-25T17:32:00.000Z	Karmander	Wallakoala	I have a AMD K6 500 mhz, 128+32 Ram and 2.1 Gb
2006-03-25T17:33:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	I installed ubuntu on a laptop that had a 2.2 gig hard drive. It *barely* fitted, so it might not be possible with your situation.
2006-03-25T17:35:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	you might want to consider installing ubuntu lite
2006-03-25T17:45:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	you can do sudo apt-get install irssi-text , which is an irc client that works in the terminal
2006-03-25T17:58:00.000Z	Karmander	Wallakoala	can we talk in private?
2006-03-25T17:58:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	what is the issue?
2006-03-25T06:01:00.000Z	Karmander	Wallakoala	I need to know what to do after installing the server configuration
2006-03-25T06:02:00.000Z	Karmander	Wallakoala	what should I do to get a nice and usefull desktop
2006-03-25T06:02:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	I am not totally sure, but you should probably install xserver-xorg
2006-03-25T06:03:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	there is a guide in ubuntu forums on how to do a server install and install openbox
2006-03-25T06:03:00.000Z	Karmander	Wallakoala	thanks a lot

2006-03-25T06:05:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	just follow that until it tells you to install openbox. Then install gnome
2006-03-25T06:07:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	once you have Xorg installed, install ubuntu-desktop
2006-03-25T06:09:00.000Z	Karmander	Wallakoala	what is openbox?
2006-03-25T06:09:00.000Z	Wallakoala	Karmander	it is a desktop enviroment, like gnome, but very minimalistic
