2010-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	ribot	mka	yes
2010-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	mka	ribot	then chmod 777 will not work
2010-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	mka	ribot	do this "sudo mount /media/DATA -o umask=0000"
2010-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	mka	ribot	sorry, do this "sudo mount /media/DATA -o remount,umask=0000"
2010-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	ribot	mka	doesn't work
2010-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	ribot	mka	i added user as option in fstab
2010-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	mka	ribot	is this a usb flash disk?
2010-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	ribot	mka	no it's the hard drive
2010-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	mka	ribot	/dev/sd what?
2010-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	mka	ribot	which user do you want to have permissions?
2010-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	mka	ribot	you can add this to the fstab file "/dev/sda2 /media/DATA vfat defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0007 0 0"
2010-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	mka	ribot	but I like persistent filesystem to have mount points in /mnt rather than /media
2010-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	mka	ribot	because if you I insert a USB flash disk and it's name is DATA it will be mounted to a mount point called /media/DATA
2010-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	ribot	mka	it's working now =)
2010-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	mka	ribot	you still around?
2010-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	ribot	mka	yes i rebooted, however don't know how you connected that to the user ribot
2010-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	mka	ribot	I assumed that your uid is 1000 and your gid is 1000 (type "id" to confirm this for yourself)
2010-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	ribot	mka	yes
2010-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	mka	ribot	the umask option makes sure that the permissions are rwxrwx---
2010-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	mka	ribot	if you want rwxr-x--- then you should have umask=0027
2010-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	mka	ribot	and lastly, fat32 filesystem doesn't have the feature for owners/groups and permissions so these are just to fool the kernel
2010-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	ribot	mka	i see, thanks
2010-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	mka	ribot	that's why trying to use chmod and chown on a fat32 drive does not work
