2008-10-17T16:17:00.000Z	chemjeff		i have an installation question, anybody up for a q?
2008-10-17T16:18:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	just ask
2008-10-17T16:20:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	check the alternative terminals to see what else is happening
2008-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	i did, i get things like I/O error
2008-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	is it possible it can't read the cd
2008-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	have you verified the CD's contents witht he cd checker tool
2008-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	no because it starts the installation just fine
2008-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	yes the CD is just fine
2008-10-17T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	just because it starts it doesn't mean it's fine
2008-10-17T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	how do you know it's fine ?
2008-10-17T16:22:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	i did use the CD checker
2008-10-17T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	which check did you run ?
2008-10-17T16:23:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	using the test from the main menu
2008-10-17T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	that normally happens because it can't read the cd
2008-10-17T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	is it possible the drive is faulty
2008-10-17T16:24:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	well i guess it is but i can hear the drive turn off during the installation and it's not at a point when it's trying to access the CD
2008-10-17T16:25:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	the livecd is squash fs in ram, so if it doesn't need to read the cdrom - it doesn't read it, hence why you hear the spin down
2008-10-17T16:26:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	but it does try to read the CD at various points during the installation right?
2008-10-17T16:26:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	depends on if it needs to swap (I suspect 300+ meg will need to swap a lot)
2008-10-17T16:27:00.000Z	chemjeff	ikonia	so is there an option i could give to the kernel or somewhere along the way that would force the CD-ROM to stay on?
2008-10-17T16:27:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	I don't think so as it's not "mounted" in the way your thinking, it's uncompressed into ram,
2008-10-17T16:32:00.000Z	ikonia	chemjeff	I'm interested to know if it works
