2006-10-12T12:35:00.000Z	XsesA		thank you very much everyone!
2006-10-12T12:36:00.000Z	XsesA		btw how the install looks like
2006-10-12T12:36:00.000Z	XsesA		blue screen like windows? :P
2006-10-12T12:37:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	it looks just like the desktop of the OS. Install happens in one window like when you install a game or something on windows.
2006-10-12T12:38:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	that's how you do the install.
2006-10-12T12:39:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	oh right. You have the alternate install CD.
2006-10-12T12:40:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	use the live-cd or desktop CD what ever it's called.
2006-10-12T12:40:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	download the cd, burn it. Boot from the CD.
2006-10-12T12:41:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	you can irc while you install the OS.
2006-10-12T12:41:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	like I said, it's more like when you have install some program to windows.
2006-10-12T12:42:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	the install goes in one window and you're on the desktop free to do what ever you want mean while.
2006-10-12T12:43:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	just install the damn thing and worry about other stuff later :)
2006-10-12T12:46:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	that's what you were using.
2006-10-12T12:46:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	err?
2006-10-12T12:48:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	you WERE using alternate install cd, that is, text-mode install. Now you have hopefully downloaded the desktop CD which is a live cd (boots you into the operating system run from the cd) with functionality to install system to the hard drive.
2006-10-12T12:49:00.000Z	Samuli^	XsesA	no problem, I was just as confused at the start.
