2007-04-24T05:27:00.000Z	delire	vega-	/etc/fstab
2007-04-24T05:28:00.000Z	delire	vega-	you can add a line in there that will enable you to mount it each boot.
2007-04-24T05:28:00.000Z	delire	vega-	it may seem a bit confusing now, but it'll make sense later.
2007-04-24T05:29:00.000Z	vega-	delire	hope that :)
2007-04-24T05:31:00.000Z	delire	vega-	fat32 takes the filesystem flag 'vfat' in /etc/fstab
2007-04-24T05:32:00.000Z	vega-	delire	mm ok
2007-04-24T05:33:00.000Z	delire	vega-	i don't have Windows so i can't show you a line as an example. here's a really good page: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html
2007-04-24T05:34:00.000Z	vega-	delire	ok got it working :)
2007-04-24T05:34:00.000Z	delire	vega-	cool!
2007-04-24T05:38:00.000Z	delire	vega-	you might want to change 'auto' to 'rw,noauto,user' in that line in /etc/fstab
2007-04-24T05:38:00.000Z	vega-	delire	ok
2007-04-24T05:39:00.000Z	delire	vega-	that will tell your system to mount the filesystem so it can be accessed by a user. see: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html
2007-04-24T05:39:00.000Z	delire	vega-	anyway, that should work just fine.
2007-04-24T05:39:00.000Z	delire	vega-	rw stands for "read write"
2007-04-24T05:40:00.000Z	vega-	delire	ok im changing it now
2007-04-24T05:42:00.000Z	vega-	delire	i cant find it in my fstab
2007-04-24T05:43:00.000Z	delire	vega-	what is the fstab line that you have for mounting your windows partition?
2007-04-24T05:44:00.000Z	vega-	delire	ican see /media/cdrom and floppy only
2007-04-24T05:45:00.000Z	delire	vega-	oh.. so the line you added was removed? can you access the windows partition now?
2007-04-24T05:46:00.000Z	vega-	delire	yes but its  read only
2007-04-24T05:47:00.000Z	delire	vega-	oh.. well ask around here. i don't know what the issue is. it's 2am here and i have to hit the hay. you'll get there, good luck.
2007-04-24T05:48:00.000Z	vega-	delire	ok thanks again
