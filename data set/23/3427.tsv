2008-05-14T02:25:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	i might have a solution for you... just let me google for a sec
2008-05-14T02:27:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	try export AWT_Toolkit=MToolkit before opening Zend
2008-05-14T02:28:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	just execute it in a terminal
2008-05-14T02:30:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	open up a terminal
2008-05-14T02:30:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	enter the text export AWT_Toolkit=MToolkit and press enter
2008-05-14T02:30:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	then launch Zend
2008-05-14T02:42:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	ok, then i don't really know what to do...
2008-05-14T02:43:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	what java version do you have installed?
2008-05-14T02:44:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	execute this in a terminal: sudo update-alternatives --config java
2008-05-14T02:53:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	ok, then it's not that problem either...
2008-05-14T02:57:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	ok, good luck
2008-05-14T03:02:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	no success?
2008-05-14T03:03:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	ok, well i've read some more about it, and afaik it has to do with the AWT_TOOLKIT variable that i mentioned eariler
2008-05-14T03:05:00.000Z	makkbe	deadsoul	try this then, in a terminal AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit /path/to/zend
