2009-11-04T18:04:00.000Z	ghafla		hi, i run vmware workstation on a win2K host, with Ubuntu Hardy Server as guest and can't configure the network, can someone help me ?
2009-11-04T18:04:00.000Z	Appiah	ghafla	NAT or Bridge?
2009-11-04T18:06:00.000Z	ghafla		appiah: bridge
2009-11-04T18:06:00.000Z	ghafla		i have a domain with several PC's with W2K workstations
2009-11-04T18:07:00.000Z	Appiah	ghafla	is this the only vm running on this machine?
2009-11-04T18:07:00.000Z	Appiah		with bridge that is?
2009-11-04T18:07:00.000Z	ghafla		i can ping from/ to  W2K -  Hardy guest
2009-11-04T18:07:00.000Z	ghafla		but i run apache2 on Hardy (guest side) but cant access it with web browser
2009-11-04T18:08:00.000Z	ghafla	Appiah	yes bridge
2009-11-04T18:08:00.000Z	ghafla		but i dont really understand how it works i only have a few routing practice
2009-11-04T18:08:00.000Z	Appiah	ghafla	my question was, Do you have other guests running with BRIDGE? that is working / not working
2009-11-04T18:09:00.000Z	ghafla		no i only have this guest
2009-11-04T18:09:00.000Z	Appiah		and ip/gw/netmask is set correct? or is it dhcp?
2009-11-04T18:09:00.000Z	ghafla		only W2K host, vmware workstation and the hardy server with apache installed
2009-11-04T18:10:00.000Z	ghafla		network adress of domain is 10.169.25.0 / 255.255.255.0 and i set a free ip adress on ubuntu server
2009-11-04T18:10:00.000Z	ghafla		eth0: is in same network yes
2009-11-04T18:10:00.000Z	Appiah		do you get a working network if you set it to NAT?
2009-11-04T18:11:00.000Z	ghafla		yes i ran apt updates and instaled package
2009-11-04T18:11:00.000Z	ghafla		problem is apache2 is running but i cant see it from any other IP
2009-11-04T18:12:00.000Z	ghafla		sorry i didnt asked clearly , it s rather a problem with apache conf. but i m not sure
2009-11-04T18:12:00.000Z	Appiah	ghafla	so the guest can reach the internet without problem?
2009-11-04T18:16:00.000Z	ghafla	Appiah	yes guest reach inet
2009-11-04T18:17:00.000Z	ghafla	Appiah	(thru a auth proxy ) but despite apache2 is running on guest i cant access the start page from the host
