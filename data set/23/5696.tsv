2006-11-04T14:39:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	Mine would get to the stage after the bouncing status bar after boot up and then just freeze.
2006-11-04T14:39:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	Yeh. I see that here too. I will try later on, perhaps on another box in a couple a' weeks.
2006-11-04T14:40:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	I had quite a number of difficulties.
2006-11-04T14:40:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	You could always gksu "update-manager -c"
2006-11-04T14:41:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	I am using two seperate server type machines 'ere and am thinking they have not caught up with them in the software.....
2006-11-04T14:41:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	Both of these machines have two cpu's each....
2006-11-04T14:41:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	Well then.
2006-11-04T14:42:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	I have many version's on CD and DVD, but I truly am very happy with 6.06 LTS, on any computer I load it to.
2006-11-04T14:43:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	Well, I wouldn't advice people to go to Edgy until things settle down a bit anyways.
2006-11-04T14:43:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	A text editor for Mac.
2006-11-04T14:44:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	Can I have one of those hd's? hahaha
2006-11-04T14:44:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	The video is my next project to fix, the card has dual video output.....
2006-11-04T14:45:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	Have you tried the forums?
2006-11-04T14:45:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	I can send you a 15 g no problem.
2006-11-04T14:45:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	Yeh, with my limited time, I have been in and out trying to learn more and more.
2006-11-04T14:46:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	IDE or SCSI please ?
2006-11-04T14:47:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	I have CD's, HD's and DVD's for you, tell me what you need and how to get one of them to you.
2006-11-04T14:47:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	I don't have the money otherwise I'd hit you up on that.
2006-11-04T14:48:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	Dude or dudette, whatever, these are for your taking as I get them for zip. I collect from every source and put them in stock to help others.
2006-11-04T14:50:00.000Z	n1gke	avagant	So, would a 15 or 20 gig help some ? These are IDE drives, but I also have SCSI in various forms.
2006-11-04T14:53:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	It's CRAZY out here, and sometimes in not good ways.
2006-11-04T14:56:00.000Z	avagant	n1gke	I had a friend John that lived in PA from Rhode Island. His accent drove me crazy. Haha
