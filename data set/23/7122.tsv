2005-12-05T09:19:00.000Z	babag		tried hardware database but had problem
2005-12-05T09:20:00.000Z	babag		when i tried the database i got to the mouse and wanted to cursor down to the 'no' box for 'no it's not working'
2005-12-05T09:21:00.000Z	babag		tabbing would only get me between the help, cancel and continue buttons, though.
2005-12-05T09:21:00.000Z	babag		yes in ubuntu now
2005-12-05T09:22:00.000Z	babag		never tried it. ok in mandriva.
2005-12-05T09:23:00.000Z	babag		this is fresh test install so i'm ok with wiping it and redoing if need be.
2005-12-05T09:23:00.000Z	babag		might as well mess with stuff.
2005-12-05T09:25:00.000Z	babag		ok.
2005-12-05T09:25:00.000Z	babag		navigating is pretty awkward for me without mouse.
2005-12-05T09:25:00.000Z	babag		how do i shift focus between windows?
2005-12-05T09:25:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	alt + tab ?
2005-12-05T09:18:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	what type of mouse?
2005-12-05T09:19:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	hmmm..sounds pretty standard
2005-12-05T09:19:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	you could try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-12-05T09:20:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	choose defaults for whatever you don't know the answer to
2005-12-05T09:33:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	well ctrl + shift + arrow keys works for selecting :)
2005-12-05T09:34:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	ctrl + c is copy
2005-12-05T09:34:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	ctrl + v is paste
2005-12-05T09:35:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	one second..I'll look around for another one
2005-12-05T09:36:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	alt + esc
2005-12-05T09:36:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	moves between windows immediately (so it says)
2005-12-05T09:37:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	alt + esc
2005-12-05T09:37:00.000Z	mustard5	babag	works on mine anyway
