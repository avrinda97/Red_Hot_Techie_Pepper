2009-08-30T12:39:00.000Z	buckee		i want to share my desktop so that the person connecting sees the same desktop that i'm using via commands; anybody know how to do this? i've looked for documentation and am having a difficult time finding it. just references to "i've done it before. but can't recall the site"
2009-08-30T12:39:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	x11vnc
2009-08-30T12:40:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	the program isn't the problem- it is sharing the same desktop rather than creating a virtual instance of a desktop that is my problem
2009-08-30T12:41:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	I understood your question, run x11vnc and it will create a VNC of your existing desktop (DISPLAY:0) to share
2009-08-30T12:42:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	hmm i tried that. maybe i had a problem getting it working. have to try again.
2009-08-30T12:43:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	I use that think all the time to get folks to see my machine, in existing X session I simply start an xterm then say:
2009-08-30T12:45:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	thanks- your making a contribution to support the masses on linux by the way :) writing a remote support application.
2009-08-30T12:46:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	Oh, that's exaxtly what I use it for - I support 100+ Ubuntu systems that way.  Simple icon on desktop for the users and bam! I'm in
2009-08-30T12:47:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	yea. i guessed you probably did. i'm setting up some scripts and creating a ubuntu package with reverse connection so firewalled users can still get support.
2009-08-30T12:47:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	read the man page (or x11vnc -h) for some details, there are a few 100 command line options there including cool things like stunnel and ssl based connetions too
2009-08-30T12:48:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	yea, i've definitely looked through the man pages a few times for the various vnc components.
2009-08-30T12:48:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	and play around with the colour and other vnc settings, I turn those down for usage on low-bandwidth connections
2009-08-30T12:49:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	 and if you want folks to watch you use -viewonly -shared - very cool for training
2009-08-30T12:51:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	at the moment i'm probably just interested in getting a package up and running, maybe compression, and maybe security. beyond that it'll be on the wish list. i've got enough work ahead of me creating different applications to streamline the support process and adding some other ease of use features.
2009-08-30T12:53:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	Ohh, I shouldn't have helped you then - that's what I do (but not a startup (anymore) )
2009-08-30T12:54:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	i'm pretty sure there is plenty of room unless you are supporting people who can barely use a computer.
2009-08-30T12:55:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	hey- what company do you work for? or own/operate.
2009-08-30T12:55:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	Yea - I'm just kidding with you... I work for edoceo; edoceo == edoceo.com
2009-08-30T12:56:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	lol, well, honestly it is an impossible feat. but that's ok. it's half a hobby. i started another business to sustain this one until it is financially stable anyway. :)
2009-08-30T12:57:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	we're actually probably announcing our line at linuxcon in a September. product development is pretty much complete
2009-08-30T12:58:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	Awesome!  I hope you get some marketing funds, it's hard out here for a shrimp!
2009-08-30T12:59:00.000Z	buckee	edoceo	we'll be ok. edoceo.com doesn't seem to really compete either. it's not the same type of operation. we're solely focused on typical ms windows users who don't have a clue about how to use their computer.
2009-08-30T13:00:00.000Z	edoceo	buckee	hit me up when you launch, sounds like could be some synergies here - and curse you for making me say synergy
