2009-11-18T17:18:00.000Z	Spixx	SuBsAm	this is a support channel if you have a question ask it: also Hi!
2009-11-18T17:20:00.000Z	Spixx	SuBsAm	you have installed ubuntu via the windows installer?
2009-11-18T17:21:00.000Z	Spixx	SuBsAm	Have you booted from the CD and are at the "harddrive" part?
2009-11-18T17:23:00.000Z	Spixx	SuBsAm	Im guessing you are about to install onto hdd and thus yes what root drive to use is important!
2009-11-18T17:30:00.000Z	Spixx	SuBsAm	ahh use the password you setup for your user?
2009-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	SuBsAm	Spixx	in flashcaht
