2005-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	mebaran151		and what should their UID be
2005-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	mebaran151		can't I just use nobody
2005-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	mebaran151		cafeugo, just trying to securely set up ftp service
2005-09-11T16:31:00.000Z	mebaran151		what is the main group that an underpriveledged user belongs to?
2005-09-11T16:31:00.000Z	mebaran151		nogroup
2005-09-11T16:32:00.000Z	mebaran151		what about home dir
2005-09-11T16:32:00.000Z	mebaran151		I dont think they should even have one
2005-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	mebaran151		for a completely underpriveledged user
2005-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	mebaran151		what should the home directory be
2005-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	mebaran151		nobody gets /
2005-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	funkyHat	mebaran151	unless you are going to chroot them, in which case it could be '/'
2005-09-11T16:35:00.000Z	funkyHat		but that would in reality be /home/username or something :P
2005-09-11T16:35:00.000Z	mebaran151	funkyHat	wait
2005-09-11T16:35:00.000Z	funkyHat		and that would be a silly way to set up a chrooted environment anyway
2005-09-11T16:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		but I am going to probably chroot them
2005-09-11T16:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		this is for my vsftpd server
2005-09-11T16:36:00.000Z	mebaran151		I may also be bind mounting too
2005-09-11T16:36:00.000Z	mebaran151		bind mounts always confuse me
2005-09-11T16:38:00.000Z	mebaran151		is chrooting worth the pain in the neck it might be?
2005-09-11T16:38:00.000Z	funkyHat	mebaran151	setting their home directory as fake / would be silly anyway. i would go for /chroot-root/home/*username* if you get what i mean
2005-09-11T16:39:00.000Z	funkyHat		setting up chroot with sshd isn't too challenging
2005-09-11T16:39:00.000Z	funkyHat		i will be setting it up soon on my server
2005-09-11T16:39:00.000Z	mebaran151	funkyHat	but why woudl I want to
