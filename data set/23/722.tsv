2011-03-15T03:22:00.000Z	An0ne		Im using UFW easy-to-use not complicated
2011-03-15T03:24:00.000Z	An0ne		whats the difference between the Cusom User in Ubuntu and the Administrator in terms of privileges?
2011-03-15T03:24:00.000Z	An0ne		whats the difference between the Custom User in Ubuntu and the Administrator in terms of privileges?
2011-03-15T03:25:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	One can do almost anything and one can do less
2011-03-15T03:25:00.000Z	An0ne	ohzie	but they both have toor access?
2011-03-15T03:25:00.000Z	An0ne	ohzie	but they both have root access?
2011-03-15T03:26:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	well the adminisrator is root
2011-03-15T03:26:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	so it would have root access
2011-03-15T03:26:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	the normal user has to gksu or sudo to root access
2011-03-15T03:26:00.000Z	An0ne		Well yes but the custom user can also use root, so whats the difference?
2011-03-15T03:27:00.000Z	An0ne		SO you should never set yourself as administrator? for security purposes?
2011-03-15T03:27:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	if you're using a normal user and you get hit by a browser exploit(example) then that exploit can run code at your level
2011-03-15T03:27:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	but not at the root level
2011-03-15T03:27:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	unless you're sudo/gksudoing your browser(which you wouldn't
2011-03-15T03:27:00.000Z	ohzie		)
2011-03-15T03:27:00.000Z	An0ne		That bwoser exploit for example wont take effect if i wouldve used the Custom User?
2011-03-15T03:28:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	no it would run but it wouldn't have access to your whole system
2011-03-15T03:28:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	what are you actually asking us
2011-03-15T03:28:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	Do you want to just not have to put in your password all the time?
2011-03-15T03:28:00.000Z	An0ne		Weither i should use the administrator or custom
2011-03-15T03:29:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	use the regular user and sudo things when you have to
2011-03-15T03:29:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	It's just the way to go
2011-03-15T03:29:00.000Z	ohzie	An0ne	As you learn more about linux, more of this will make sense to you
