2006-07-01T06:26:00.000Z	dmizer		need some help with embedded video using mplayer.
2006-07-01T06:27:00.000Z	JeevesBond	dmizer	You're not having problems with it not playing WMV's are you?
2006-07-01T06:27:00.000Z	JeevesBond		Or is it just not working in general?
2006-07-01T06:27:00.000Z	dmizer	JeevesBond	it works, but it locks firefox at the end.
2006-07-01T06:27:00.000Z	dmizer		i have to do killall firefox
2006-07-01T06:28:00.000Z	dmizer		i'm using xfce
2006-07-01T06:28:00.000Z	JeevesBond		Ooooh, thanks zcat[1] !!
2006-07-01T06:30:00.000Z	dmizer	JeevesBond	i have added alsa to the .mplayer/configure file ... without this switch, video playback is terrible.
2006-07-01T06:31:00.000Z	JeevesBond		Ahh, already have that. Thanks though zcat[1] 
2006-07-01T06:32:00.000Z	JeevesBond	dmizer	Hmmm, my problem is somewhat different. I installed mplayer but it can't find any of the wmv codecs
2006-07-01T06:32:00.000Z	JeevesBond		I checked and their all in completely the wrong folder
2006-07-01T06:32:00.000Z	JeevesBond		they're*
2006-07-01T06:33:00.000Z	dmizer		make symbolic links?
2006-07-01T06:33:00.000Z	JeevesBond		Yeah, I can't remember what I did or whether it worked. I should have another go
2006-07-01T06:34:00.000Z	dmizer	JeevesBond	did you use any kind of script to update firefox?
2006-07-01T06:34:00.000Z	JeevesBond		I don't use Firefox
2006-07-01T06:34:00.000Z	dmizer		ah ... what's your flavor?
2006-07-01T06:34:00.000Z	JeevesBond		Am one of those horrible Opera lovers ;)
2006-07-01T06:34:00.000Z	dmizer		mplayer doesn't work right in opera.
2006-07-01T06:34:00.000Z	JeevesBond		In fact am using the built-in IRC client to talk to you now
2006-07-01T06:34:00.000Z	dmizer		mplayer plug in site doesn't recommend it's use.
2006-07-01T06:36:00.000Z	JeevesBond		You're assuming I've been playing video in Opera. I haven't have been playing files in mplayer and it still doesn't work. Have been using VLC as a substitute but that doesn't always work either
2006-07-01T06:37:00.000Z	dmizer	JeevesBond	yeah, i tried vlc, and totem with both xine and gstreamer and nothing works right.
