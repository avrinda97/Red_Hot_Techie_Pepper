2010-05-20T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 just exiting to the console and doing a 'sudo service gdm restart' dosent help eh?
2010-05-20T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 what do you have to lose? that will restart the X server. and works for my 2 machines when they have the same issue...
2010-05-20T18:50:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	Guys "sudo service gdm restart" says "restart: unknown instance" and sudo "displayconfig-gtk" says "command not found"
2010-05-20T18:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 perhaps 'sudo service gdm start'
2010-05-20T18:55:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	"sudo service gdm start" says "gdm start/running process 1168"
2010-05-20T18:56:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	"sudo service gdm start" says "gdm start/running process 1168"
2010-05-20T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 so did X startup?  check alt-ctrl-f7 perhaps.
2010-05-20T18:57:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	No
2010-05-20T18:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 you could also just try a 'startx' command and look for errors.
2010-05-20T18:57:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	See the screenshot of the problem I posted
2010-05-20T18:58:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	I used startx yesterday and it started initializing kde, and then nothing came, blank screen
2010-05-20T18:58:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	Also I dont have any idea how did it started initializing KDE?? I don't have KDE installed
2010-05-20T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 try moving your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.BACKUP and reboot and se eif it helps.
2010-05-20T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 check to se eif its there.. and CASE IS IMPRONTANT
2010-05-20T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 its X11 not x11
2010-05-20T19:06:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	Ohh
2010-05-20T19:06:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	Thanks
2010-05-20T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 yep.. linux Basics...
2010-05-20T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 theproblem with just trying commands  is that that can sometimes break things worse.
2010-05-20T19:08:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	The suggestion posted by forum members after I posted the solution
2010-07-03T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Krishnandu	 just try one and see? not too hard. :)
2010-10-23T23:22:00.000Z	Krishnandu	Dr_Willis	Well..he said "Failed to mount windows shares" so I thought it might be a problem with firewall. But as I dunno what you suggested him I didn't answer
