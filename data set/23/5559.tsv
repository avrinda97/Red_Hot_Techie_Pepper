2007-04-21T07:48:00.000Z	Crema10		whats the easiest way to update 6.10 to 7.04?
2007-04-21T07:48:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	 sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-04-21T07:49:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	awsome, thanks... but will I encounter any problems doing this update?
2007-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	for example, will I encounter problems with Beryl which gave me so much problems to install in my laptop
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	you have beryl on 6.10 and now you want to use 7.04 and simply upgrade?
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	yes sir
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	I want upgrade, but I dont want to break anything, especially my beryl
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	7.04 has desktop effects like beryl with it..
2007-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	what i would do is disable the beryl lines you put in system > preferences > sessions
2007-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	7.04 has effects like beryl!!??! wow! So we dont need Beryl anymore?
2007-04-21T07:54:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	no, you don't need beryl :)
2007-04-21T07:54:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	oh wow! thats awsome... ok one more question, I installed A LOT Of things via Automatix, will I encounter problems with that?
2007-04-21T07:55:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	as long as you make sure your system is upto date, before you do the dist-upgrade - you should be fine.
2007-04-21T07:55:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	sudo apt-get update // sudo apt-get upgrade // then do a: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-04-21T07:56:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	ok thanks man, i appreciate it!
2007-04-21T07:56:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	no worriessss
2007-04-21T07:57:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	let me do that now, please cross your fingers for me, here goes nothing  :)
2007-04-21T07:59:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	actually one more question, will I see any performance decrease doing this upgrade, as opposed to doing it a clean 7.10 install?
2007-04-21T07:59:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	i did an upgrade rather than a fresh install and it seems to be fine.
2007-04-21T07:59:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	ok then, i'll give it a shot.. got nothint to lose, thanks man :)
2007-04-21T08:00:00.000Z	reazn	Crema10	have funnn
2007-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	i did what you said, apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and then apt-get dist-upgrade... but when i did the last part, it doesnt do anything...
2007-04-21T08:17:00.000Z	Crema10	reazn	it reads packages, building dependecies, reads state ifnormation then calculates upgrade, but after that it does nothing
