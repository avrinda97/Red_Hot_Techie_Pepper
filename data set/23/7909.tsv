2005-04-05T07:55:00.000Z	DakPowers		I recently installed Ubuntu on my old desktop and when everything's done and installed, I see a black screen... I can type in my name and pass and hear the OS start up, but it displays nothing... Is there a cure for this?
2005-04-05T07:57:00.000Z	DakPowers		Anyone?
2005-04-05T07:57:00.000Z	DakPowers		I didn't know if this was a common problem

2005-04-05T08:00:00.000Z	DakPowers		Any suggestions?
2005-04-05T08:01:00.000Z	DakPowers		But I only set it to accept 1024x768 during installation, it'll still do larger?
2005-04-05T08:02:00.000Z	DakPowers		Anyone else ever have resolution problems?
2005-04-05T08:02:00.000Z	DakPowers		Thanks, though, stang :)

2005-04-05T08:06:00.000Z	infidel	DakPowers	can you startx
2005-04-05T08:08:00.000Z	DakPowers		startx? If it has to do with the OS, it disappears as soon as it loads
2005-04-05T08:08:00.000Z	infidel	DakPowers	what errors?
2005-04-05T08:09:00.000Z	DakPowers	infidel	I install Ubuntu Warty. As soon as the installation is over and the OS starts up (where it should be the name: pass:) screen, the monitor doesn't display anything... It goes into "monitor is ok, check cables" mode
2005-04-05T08:10:00.000Z	infidel	DakPowers	wow
2005-04-05T08:11:00.000Z	DakPowers		As if it's trying to put up a resolution that my monitor doesn't support
2005-04-05T08:11:00.000Z	DakPowers		But I only choose 1024, 800 and 600, and I know my monitor can take all of those
2005-04-05T08:12:00.000Z	DakPowers		What do you mean, geneo93?
2005-04-05T08:12:00.000Z	DakPowers		And stang, I'm not sure
2005-04-05T08:12:00.000Z	infidel	DakPowers	sounds about right does it start to load the os?
2005-04-05T08:13:00.000Z	DakPowers		Yeah, it loads everything, you can hear the sounds... I blindly type in my name/pass and it starts up
2005-04-05T08:13:00.000Z	infidel	DakPowers	you running grub?
2005-04-05T08:16:00.000Z	DakPowers		Yes, infidel
2005-04-05T08:17:00.000Z	infidel	DakPowers	try booting into console mode
