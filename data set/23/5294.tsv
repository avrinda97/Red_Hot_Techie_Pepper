2007-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	rpc		does anyone know how serious a Bus Error is?
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	rpc		and what is that in general?
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	where does it occur
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	i saw that on my ssh session
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	and it all broke... now i can't ssh in...
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	host responds to pings though
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	doesnt sound good but i have no idea what the heck ti is
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	it**
2007-04-01T07:56:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	hm
2007-04-01T07:57:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	a bus is a way for a PC to transfer data.  that's all i know
2007-04-01T07:57:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	you probably already knew that so i suggest ##linux or google for that one
2007-04-01T07:57:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	isn't that related to hdd?
2007-04-01T07:57:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	bus could be anything.  it could very well be the HDD controller.  or it could be HyperTransport bus for example, the bus connecting the CPU to peripeherals.  it all depends
2007-04-01T07:57:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	not much in google...  but i suspect that some process just sucked up all resources
2007-04-01T07:58:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	might just be some stupid error sounding a lot more critical than it is.  like a network issue
2007-04-01T07:58:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	all i see about it is "page fault" or memory /paging error
2007-04-01T07:59:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	obscure crap there..
2007-04-01T07:59:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	hmm
2007-04-01T08:00:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	"Usually it means your machine has run out of RAM. See if you can set up some swap space or a swap file -- that should fix the problem."
2007-04-01T08:00:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	apparently a program sends SIGBUS (or it is sent by kernel?) and that adds "Bus error" to stdout or klog or whatever
2007-04-01T08:12:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	then you have non-SMP kernel
2007-04-01T08:13:00.000Z	xtknight	rpc	hrm very surprising.  i thought Feisty would have had SMP default by now
2007-04-01T08:13:00.000Z	rpc	xtknight	most likely yes
