2005-06-25T12:26:00.000Z	reka	kong0	you don't install zip files.  they're archives
2005-06-25T12:28:00.000Z	reka	kong0	depends on what it is.  what are you trying to install?
2005-06-25T12:29:00.000Z	reka	kong0	why not use the repos? sudo apt-get install bchunk
2005-06-25T12:30:00.000Z	kong0	reka	im completely new on this OS and now i wonder what repos is...
2005-06-25T12:31:00.000Z	reka	kong0	only install stuff manually (i.e. from "zip" files) when you can't find the program in the repos
2005-06-25T12:33:00.000Z	kong0	reka	actually i dont even know how to find it in repos

2005-06-25T12:33:00.000Z	reka	kong0	do that, and then use synaptic to install programs(sys->admin->synaptic)
