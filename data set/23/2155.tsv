2009-08-04T04:55:00.000Z	Harryy		Hello, I am having ttrouble making log files. It is probably a simple answer, but someone could help me here, I would appreciate it. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1230796
2009-08-04T04:56:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	auth.log.1 is logrotate rotating the logs
2009-08-04T04:56:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	okay. about the rest of my question though?
2009-08-04T04:56:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	auth.log will be the file with the latest entries in
2009-08-04T04:56:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	no, i believe fail2ban will only use auth.log (or the one file you specify)
2009-08-04T04:57:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	but why when i start sshd, it doesnt make nor try to access my auth.log file?
2009-08-04T04:57:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	try restarting syslog instead
2009-08-04T04:57:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	see what happens then
2009-08-04T04:57:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	and remove the auth.log-file you've created
2009-08-04T04:57:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	so, to summarize.. remove auth.log and restart syslog
2009-08-04T04:58:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	okay. so stop it and remove all auto.log* files?
2009-08-04T04:58:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	yup
2009-08-04T04:58:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	auth.log*
2009-08-04T04:59:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	* Reloading system log daemon...                                        [fail]
2009-08-04T05:00:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	do you know why it is failing to restart syslogd?
2009-08-04T05:01:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	check your logs ;)
2009-08-04T05:01:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	that was the phun :p
2009-08-04T05:01:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	but try stopping it and the starting it
2009-08-04T05:03:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	I re ran the syslogdaemon, and reran sshd, still did not make the .log file
2009-08-04T05:03:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	try logging in and see what happens?
2009-08-04T05:04:00.000Z	zamba	Harryy	and give it time to flush the log entries to disk
2009-08-04T05:04:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	relogged in. "sudo nano /etc/log/auth.log" gives me "New File", and if I tab on "auth", it doesnt give me any options
2009-08-04T05:07:00.000Z	Harryy	zamba	do you know anything else I should try to fix my log problem?
