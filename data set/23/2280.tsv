2009-06-03T04:13:00.000Z	ironfoot_495		Hello can someone help me figure out why I can't get ssh to work on desktop or Server???
2009-06-03T04:13:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	YEah lets do it
2009-06-03T04:14:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	Specifically what is the problem?
2009-06-03T04:14:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	ed_debian	OK let's do it thanx
2009-06-03T04:16:00.000Z	ironfoot_495		what to do first???
2009-06-03T04:16:00.000Z	ironfoot_495		;-)
2009-06-03T04:16:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	What specifically isn't working?  What are you trying to do?
2009-06-03T04:17:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	ed_debian	I've really tried very hard to them to work but I'm missing something when it comes to the publickey???
2009-06-03T04:17:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	Are you ssh ing over the internet?  Have you ssh'd without a private key (with just a username and password)?
2009-06-03T04:19:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	ed_debian	it's intranet and I have tried all the google methods but for sdome reason I can get it to work
2009-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	Do you have the open-ssh-server package installed on the server?
2009-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	ed_debian	it keeps saying Permission denied (publickey,password)
2009-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	so the command you're running is "ssh ironfoot_495@ipofserver" ??
2009-06-03T04:21:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	ed_debian	yes
2009-06-03T04:21:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	And you installed the openssh-server package on the server?
2009-06-03T04:22:00.000Z	ironfoot_495		ed_debian:yes
2009-06-03T04:22:00.000Z	ironfoot_495		well actually I use ssh -vv -p 2096 root@ipadd
2009-06-03T04:23:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	what does the -vv flag do? Why are you trying to log in as root?  Try to log in as yourself IDK if root is allowed to ssh.  Seems like it would be a security risk.
2009-06-03T04:24:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	Also try putting the ip address of your server (the local intranet ip address) instead of it's host name.  Unless you have the name in your host file or you have a DNS server on your intranet host names won't work
2009-06-03T04:25:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	ed_debian	are you there???
2009-06-03T04:25:00.000Z	ironfoot_495		I think I olost connection
2009-06-03T04:25:00.000Z	ed_debian	ironfoot_495	NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  we've lost him...
2009-06-03T04:29:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	ed_debian	are you still there got disconnected??
