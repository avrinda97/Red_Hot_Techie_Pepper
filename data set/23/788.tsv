2011-05-25T15:55:00.000Z	MichaelKohler		hi, I'm using an Australien 3G connection shared from my phone (tethering). Ubuntu can't connect to any website no matter which browser I am using. What could be wrong? (ping commands works though)
2011-05-25T15:56:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	does ping work on say 'google.com' -- that is does DNS work?
2011-05-25T15:57:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	it does, yes
2011-05-25T15:57:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	sometimes it even says "connected to google.com" in the browser but nothing happens after that
2011-05-25T15:57:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	weird indeed
2011-05-25T15:57:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	on windows it works perfectly and I can say that the network isn't that slow
2011-05-25T15:58:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	and since there is 'connected' message i guess its not matter of any 'working offline'
2011-05-25T15:58:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	no certainly not
2011-05-25T16:03:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	'telnet www.google.com 80' -- see http://www.apacheweek.com/features/http11
2011-05-25T16:03:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	it's just weird that under windows it works perfectly.. so I don't think this is a matter of authentication or similar
2011-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	true indeed
2011-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	thanks I'll try that.. but need to start ubuntu to do that since I have only one computer ATM
2011-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	but also the browser does not know anything about what connection you are using -- and its not like network is blocked for application X (it can be done though but it requires tricks)
2011-05-25T16:04:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	Check the web page i pasted
2011-05-25T16:05:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	I will thanks
2011-05-25T17:31:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	re my problem with connecting to sites using ubuntu.. I tried telnet but it doesn't return any status code
2011-05-25T17:56:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	it should print something like
2011-05-25T17:57:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	like this : http://pastebin.com/itEzZLsc
2011-05-25T17:58:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	if it does not the problem truly lies somewhere in connection settings -- check your firewall (iptables -L)
2011-05-25T17:58:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	then it looks like it's just extremly slow.. for me it stops at "Escape character.." and doesn't seem to do more until I hit Ctrl+C
2011-05-25T18:00:00.000Z	susundberg	MichaelKohler	So you get the connection up and running but data is not transferring properly .. which is quite weird indeed
2011-05-25T18:00:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	using WLAN works without any problem
2011-05-25T18:01:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	susundberg	no problem :) thanks anyway
