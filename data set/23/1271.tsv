2010-06-02T21:52:00.000Z	microbalrog		Hello
2010-06-02T21:52:00.000Z	microbalrog		I have a small problem with the unrar program
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		it claims that any .rar files it tries to open are empty
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		and when it is ordered to extract them just creates an empty folder
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		and names it after the file
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	microbalrog		what to do, what to do?
2010-06-02T21:55:00.000Z	microbalrog		<comag> microbalrog: maybe the unrar shipped with ubuntu is unable to read your rars <- it didn't ship with Ubuntu
2010-06-02T21:55:00.000Z	microbalrog		I installed it
2010-06-02T21:56:00.000Z	microbalrog		which is the right, then?
2010-06-02T21:57:00.000Z	microbalrog		is  sudo apt-get install unrar the right one?
2010-06-02T21:58:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	That will attempt install unrar
2010-06-02T21:59:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	Good for you, now you can extract rar archives
2010-06-02T21:59:00.000Z	microbalrog	soreau	and yet I can't actually install rar archives
2010-06-02T22:00:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	What do you mean 'install rar archives'? You should be able to extract or decompress them..
2010-06-02T22:02:00.000Z	microbalrog	soreau	which is untrue as I have several different archives tht several other people have used them successfully
2010-06-02T22:02:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	How are you trying to extract them exactly?
2010-06-02T22:02:00.000Z	microbalrog	soreau	by opening the directory the .rar files are in
2010-06-02T22:03:00.000Z	microbalrog	soreau	clicking extract
2010-06-02T22:03:00.000Z	microbalrog	soreau	or just clicking on the files
2010-06-02T22:04:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	Can you try opening one with file-roller?
2010-06-02T22:07:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	Please keep it in this room
2010-06-02T22:07:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	Try unrar --help
2010-06-02T22:09:00.000Z	soreau	microbalrog	It's a very short list and if you just read it you'd see unrar e /path/to/file.rar....
