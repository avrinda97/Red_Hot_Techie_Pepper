2006-12-10T08:23:00.000Z	skyrunner		guys how do i become owner
2006-12-10T08:23:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	sudo chown <username>:<group> -r (if you want it to be recursive) /<dir>
2006-12-10T08:24:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	the group you want to own the dir
2006-12-10T08:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	-R
2006-12-10T08:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	case sensitive
2006-12-10T08:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	_never_ execute commands you dont understand as root. you might have just broke something, real bad
2006-12-10T08:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	it means to apply the command to every file and dir in that dir
2006-12-10T08:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	it means your user isnt in the sudoers list
2006-12-10T08:38:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	as i said, _never_ _ever_ under _any_ circumstances execute anything as root without knowing what you are doing
2006-12-10T08:38:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	yes, you did
2006-12-10T08:39:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	no, you changed ownership
2006-12-10T08:39:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	thats diffrent
2006-12-10T08:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	the is no such thing as pride here <3
2006-12-10T08:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	we are a forgiving and loving kind <3
2006-12-10T08:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	the biggest lesson here is never do anything unless you are sure you should - always ask first, ask the whole question and dont guess half of it - _never_ use sudo unless you know exactly what you are doing. happy hacking :)
2006-12-10T08:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	i would :) its so much less hassle than windows... i hated having to reformat every other month after major win3/95 breakage when i was 8-12...
2006-12-10T08:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	amsn is trouble. i suggest using gaim instead.
2006-12-15T11:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	they are compressed archives, like zip:s
2006-12-15T11:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	do you want to unzip them?
2006-12-15T11:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	then just ask ;) use cabextract
2006-12-15T11:59:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	yes it is
2006-12-15T12:17:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	you dont install it. ;)
2006-12-15T12:28:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	skyrunner	it is
