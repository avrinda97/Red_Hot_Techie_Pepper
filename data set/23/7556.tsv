2005-11-08T11:35:00.000Z	nemik		so a quick shell scripting question, how can i echo out the current date and time?
2005-11-08T11:36:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	echo 'the date is `date`'
2005-11-08T11:37:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	backquotes, `` are used for command substitution
2005-11-21T11:07:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	did you read the info or man pages?
2005-11-21T11:08:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	i created a lock file that has xscreensaver-command -lock in it. it works fine when i do 'bash lock' in a terminal, but now when i crontab -e it. am i doing something wrong?
2005-11-21T11:22:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	I dont think your conclusion follows, more likely people currently on this channel never needed to do that.
2005-11-21T11:22:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	just asking if it is possible and how to do it. google has nothing on it
2005-11-21T12:06:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	in universe.
2005-11-21T12:06:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	or maybe not.
2005-11-21T12:06:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	i have it installed, just looking for the program itself....well maybe it is not necessary
2005-11-21T12:06:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	what file, a program has many files.
2005-11-21T12:07:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	i figured out how to do the screensaver from cron, but now need to load a window of xmms from cron too. and that is not working despite my best efforts
2005-11-21T12:08:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	I saw you figured that one out, good work. xmms can be started from anywhere, it is in /usr/bin
2005-11-21T12:09:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	i made a script called play. and put xmms %U in there. when i run it from terminal, it is perfect. but when i add it to a cron, nothing. i checked and permissions are set to execute and everything
2006-10-27T09:14:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	not all laptops are made the same
2006-10-27T09:15:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	I got a dead powerbook g4 last generation they made them, which makes it less than a year old
2006-10-27T09:17:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	is there anything else anywhere else?
2006-10-27T09:17:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	what do you need the /etc for and /var?
2006-10-27T09:18:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	/etc i know has my wpa_config and var has www
2006-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	you could sudo dpkg -l >installedPackages to know what to install so you don't have to come up with it every time you install anew...
2006-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	cool, thanks a lot
2006-10-27T09:22:00.000Z	dabaR	nemik	that's $20
2006-10-27T09:23:00.000Z	nemik	dabaR	ok :( what's your paypal. ;)
