2012-08-04T16:11:00.000Z	irreverant		then I get type password for >>>>>>>
2012-08-04T16:11:00.000Z	irreverant		I do and it says command not found
2012-08-04T16:12:00.000Z	irreverant		what is sudo bash?
2012-08-04T16:12:00.000Z	irreverant		wait why doesn't su - work in ubuntu?
2012-08-04T16:13:00.000Z	irreverant		if I want to get super user or root access to install thing?
2012-08-04T16:14:00.000Z	irreverant		so sudo sh or sudo bash emulates/ creates the ability to run things in root/admin mode?
2012-08-04T16:15:00.000Z	irreverant		Well, help me understand please why this was changed... cause if I recall su - then password was acceptable for the member / account I was using or even root
2012-08-04T16:17:00.000Z	irreverant		Really cause I used it before.
2012-08-04T16:17:00.000Z	irreverant		I had to enable the root user in user accounts though I think.
2012-08-04T16:19:00.000Z	irreverant		Ok so what's the difference between sudo sh sudo bash sudo vi? I thought VI was an editor? Also if running amok in root was an issue then why offer the ability to use sudo bash if it still gives me the same privileges?
2012-08-04T16:19:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	Sudo is sudo.
2012-08-04T16:20:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	Its like, you have a car, a bike and a jet. Then you add sudo. It becomes awesome car, awesome bike, awesome jet.
2012-08-04T16:22:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	sudo just makes whatever comes after sudo run on super user mode.
2012-08-04T16:23:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	Its like an adjective. Between just command and admin command.
2012-08-04T16:23:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	When you write sudo you want to run a command on super user mode. Thats all there is to it.
2012-08-04T16:23:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	First it prompts you for a password, then if the password is right it just executes whatever was in front of sudo as a super user.
2012-08-04T16:27:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	What command you want to execute?
2012-08-04T16:27:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	Here I'll divide it in parts.
2012-08-04T16:28:00.000Z	irreverant	Odra	thank you. I can understand parts
2012-08-04T16:29:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	SUDO MAKES YOU ADMIN. There. Said it.
2012-08-04T16:29:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	Can you program?
2012-08-04T16:33:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	I only know C++ and C# and I still know how sudo works.
2012-08-04T16:34:00.000Z	Odra	irreverant	Its like a callback method. You send the command to sudo and it makes sure the command runs on admin mode.
