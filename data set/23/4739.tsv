2007-05-18T08:54:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	that's correct.
2007-05-18T08:52:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	because you installed windows after Ubuntu, didn't you?
2007-05-18T08:53:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	nope.  Right after I installed Ubuntu, I restarted, but there was no option to boot into it.
2007-05-18T08:53:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	So you installed windows before ubuntu and now it boots into windows without question?
2007-05-18T08:54:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	You might have messed up the part about installing GRUB on the MBR... (which you _will_ want to do).
2007-05-18T08:55:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	I wasn't asked anything about that during the install process, so maybe I haven't done it at all.  How do I go about it?
2007-05-18T08:56:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	Maybe reinstall ubuntu and look more closely (it has to do with disk partitions and such)
2007-05-18T08:56:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	all right, I'll give it a shot.
2007-05-18T09:00:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	okay, I've gone through the install menus.  A couple questions about location and language.  Then it asked where I wanted to install, and I said 'guided install', using the drive I'm devoting to Ubuntu.  It didn't ask anything about the MBR or GRUB.
2007-05-18T09:02:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	there's an 'advanced' button that lets me choose a device for boot loader installation.  Should I touch that?
2007-05-18T09:05:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	okay, what should I choose?
2007-05-18T09:05:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	what are the options? :)
2007-05-18T09:06:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	anything about MBR? click that ^^
2007-05-18T09:07:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	it doesn't say anything about MBR.  It just has a 'Device for boot loader installation:' field.
2007-05-18T09:07:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	yeah so pick the 'main' device
2007-05-18T09:08:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	and if it's just an empty textbox then nevermind leave that blank and cancel..
2007-05-18T09:08:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	It says (hd0) in that field now.  Should it?
2007-05-18T09:09:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	You're sure when you're starting there's no GRUB screen for 3 seconds that says 'press esc' for a menu list?
2007-05-18T09:09:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	you mean when I start the computer without the LiveCD in?  I'm sure.  It goes straight to Windows.
2007-05-18T09:10:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	Did you actually install to a hard disk?
2007-05-18T09:10:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	yes.  Jordan_U_: yes.
2007-05-18T09:11:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Waddledee	Which version of windows? @.@
2007-05-18T09:12:00.000Z	Waddledee	RememberPOL	XP.
