2005-10-30T17:38:00.000Z	jsor		is there a good way to install mozilla-mailnews on breezy?  My only option seems to be downgrading libnspr4 (and most of gnome with it)
2005-10-30T17:38:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	thunderbird is your friend! :-)
2005-10-30T17:39:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	it's my friend for sure, but my parents are resistant to change
2005-10-30T17:39:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	Tell them it's smaller, faster, more secure.
2005-10-30T17:39:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	Surely they won't mind thunderbird loading in1  second as opposed to mozilla's 12.
2005-10-30T17:41:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	if I can't install mailnews, then there isn't much of an option
2005-10-30T17:41:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	Let me have a look...
2005-10-30T17:42:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	'sudo apt-get install mozilla-mailnews' isn't doing its thing?
2005-10-30T17:44:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	?
2005-10-30T17:45:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	yeah, any luck?
2005-10-30T17:45:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	'sudo apt-get install mozilla-mailnews' isn't doing its thing?
2005-10-30T17:45:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	(You need the universe repository)
2005-10-30T17:45:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	wait, I missed your earlier question
2005-10-30T17:47:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	yeah, I have universe installed.  apt-getting mozilla-mailnews returns "mozilla-mailnews: Depends: mozilla-browser (= 2:1.7.12-0ubuntu2) but 2:1.7.12-1ubuntu1 is to be installed"
2005-10-30T17:48:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	Run 'sudo apt-get update' first, then try...
2005-10-30T17:49:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	apt-get update didn't find anything new
2005-10-30T17:49:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	Hmm, do you have breezy-updates and breezy-security enabled?
2005-10-30T17:49:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	has it installed fine for you then?
2005-10-30T17:50:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	I'll check my sources.list
2005-10-30T17:51:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	There's a manual override: wget -c http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/m/mozilla/mozilla-browser_1.7.12-0ubuntu2_i386.deb; sudo dpkg -i mozilla-browser_1.7.12-0ubuntu2_i386.deb
2005-10-30T17:52:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	I have breezy-security for universe, but not breezy-updates for universe.  I'll see if I can take care of that
2005-10-30T17:53:00.000Z	cafuego	jsor	*nod* If it, just go the manual route. The package versions will probably sort themselves out later on when the mirrors update.
2005-10-30T17:54:00.000Z	jsor	cafuego	yeah, adding breezy-updates for universe took care of the problem.  thanks for your help
