2005-08-26T16:36:00.000Z	cyphase		hoary was pretty user fiendly, but not quite enough for a newbie

2005-08-26T15:31:00.000Z	topyli	cyphase	don't do that
2005-12-05T14:37:00.000Z	cyphase	topyli	me
2005-12-05T14:37:00.000Z	topyli	cyphase	no fiddlint?
2005-12-05T14:37:00.000Z	cyphase	topyli	all i did was reinstall totem and totem-xine
2005-12-05T14:40:00.000Z	topyli	cyphase	'scuse me while remove the vlc plugin
2005-12-05T14:40:00.000Z	topyli	cyphase	when dapper is out
2005-12-05T14:47:00.000Z	topyli	cyphase	nope. on apple's trailer site, the plugin appears and displays "no plugin to handle this movie"
2005-12-05T14:48:00.000Z	topyli	cyphase	naturally, i have the plugins
2005-12-05T14:49:00.000Z	cyphase	topyli	that's probably because apple marks the movies as quicktime
2005-12-05T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	cyphase	mplayer doesn't seem to mind
2005-12-05T14:50:00.000Z	cyphase	topyli	yea, because of the difference how mplayer and totem handle movies
