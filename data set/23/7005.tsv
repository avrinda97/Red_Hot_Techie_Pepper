2005-11-01T12:06:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	back
2005-11-01T12:08:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	the problem is that i've a ide one and a sata one...
2005-11-01T12:10:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	ok
2005-11-01T12:11:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	on the sata one i've both, linux and win, and is hd1
2005-11-01T12:14:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	you right :)
2005-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	so i just invert it
2005-11-01T12:19:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	ok i'm just modifying
2005-11-01T12:20:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	so the linux line is: root            (hd0,5)
2005-11-01T12:21:00.000Z	doubletwist	smiroldo_	Looks reasonable as long as in device.map hd0 points to the Hd linux is on, and your boot/root partition is on the first extended partition of that drive :)
2005-11-01T12:22:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	the boot/root partition is on the first extender partition of the ide drive
2005-11-01T12:26:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	i'm not good with grub, but yesterday evening my friend configure it for me, but i forgot to set the windows lines...
2005-11-01T12:27:00.000Z	doubletwist	smiroldo_	have you made any of those changes yet? [if not, don't] 
2005-11-01T12:27:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	not already saved
2005-11-01T12:27:00.000Z	doubletwist	smiroldo_	ok, undo the changes.
2005-11-01T12:28:00.000Z	doubletwist	smiroldo_	Which HD is the windows partition on?
2005-11-01T12:28:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	sata one
2005-11-01T12:28:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	and linux too...
2005-11-01T12:28:00.000Z	doubletwist	smiroldo_	ok, in the device map, which hd is sda listed as?
2005-11-01T12:29:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	hd1
2005-11-01T12:29:00.000Z	doubletwist	smiroldo_	ok, then your windows section should look like this:
2005-11-01T12:30:00.000Z	doubletwist	smiroldo_	make it look like that, save it and reboot and see if it works.
2005-11-01T12:30:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	ok i'll modify!
2005-11-01T12:30:00.000Z	smiroldo_	doubletwist	brb
