2010-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	Belserusk		Hi. I was looking at a friends laptop yesterday. I saw a button on the same row as the help, wireless and power buttons. It has a symbol on it that kind of looks like this: http://michaelgr.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/radioactive-001.png What is its function? I pressed it but nothing happened! The laptop model is a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo L1310G
2010-07-04T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	that is nothing to do with ubuntu
2012-02-27T16:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	what are the distros ?
2012-02-27T16:56:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	Ubuntu 10.04 ~ Xubuntu 11.10
2012-02-27T16:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	so they should both be compatible with each other, no concerns there
2012-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	I already do the sync but want to know the min amount of packages to sync Ubuntu 10.04 to a 3rd computer running LinuxMint 9 KDE
2012-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	cheers.
2012-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	I'd advise you not to sync mint
2012-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	are those the requisite packages? No more no less?
2012-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	Why not mint/
2012-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	its a different distro
2012-02-27T16:58:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	stephanb I must clarify this. I am only syncing personal files.
2012-02-27T17:00:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	are those the requisite packages? No more no less?                sudo apt-get install grsync openssh-client openssh-server rsync ssh
2012-02-27T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	well it depends how you are synging
2012-02-27T17:00:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	via Grsync
2012-02-27T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	for example grsync is a gui, that will require X11 and a desktop and GTKs, so it will pull in a lot of other packages
2012-02-27T17:01:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	I see. So if I install Grsync - it will automatically install all other required apps>?
2012-02-27T17:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	why are you asking, you said you are already doing this and it's working
2012-02-27T17:02:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	Because I want to sync a 3rd laptop and only want to install the min amount of software on it.
2012-02-27T17:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	yes and as I've said I adviswe you not to do that
2012-02-27T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Belserusk	look at what the 3rd laptop is running a.) mint a different distro with different packages b.) KDE, so it won't be running any of the gnome/gtk stuff that Grsync depends on
2012-02-27T17:04:00.000Z	Belserusk	ikonia	ok. Thanks. &_&
