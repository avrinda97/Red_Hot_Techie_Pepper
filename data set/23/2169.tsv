2009-06-15T21:23:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	what ati driver did you install the one from ati or ubuntu
2009-06-15T21:38:00.000Z	user___	ctmjr	   Sorry, I was away for a minute.  I initially tried the AMD/ATI driver, that's when I got into trouble.  Then I tried the fglrx, but I'm still having the same problem.
2009-06-15T21:39:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	so now you have 2 fglrx drivers installed 1 from the ati site and 1 from ubuntu?
2009-06-15T21:43:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	ok you need to make sure you cannot have both at the same time the best thing to do is remove everything and start over, what graphic card do you have and what ubuntu dist do you have ie. 9.04
2009-06-15T21:47:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	you do not need to open the box type lspci | grep VGA
2009-06-15T21:56:00.000Z	user___	ctmjr	 it is RV515 PRO Radeon x1300/x1550 series
2009-06-15T21:59:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	ok now type this it more than likely not installed but need to make sure  sudo apt-get remove --purge xorg-driver-fglrx
2009-06-15T22:02:00.000Z	user___	ctmjr	OK, I did that.  What next?
2009-06-15T22:03:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	type in terminal fglrxinfo
2009-06-15T22:07:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	do ls /usr/share/ati and it should have just one file
2009-06-15T22:10:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	do you have this file in there fglrx-uninstall.sh
2009-06-15T22:13:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	type this sh ./fglrx-uninstall.sh this will remove the ati proprietary driver which is not working any way
2009-06-15T22:14:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	you need to put sudo in front sorry
2009-06-15T22:17:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	try this way sudo sh ./fglrx-uninstall.sh
2009-06-15T22:18:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	sorry just realized we are not in the dir
2009-06-15T22:19:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	go into the dir cd /usr/share/ati then try it
2009-06-15T22:21:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	now run this to get back your gui sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg, then reboot
2009-06-15T22:27:00.000Z	user___	ctmjr	 thanks a lot, my desktop is back.  I got into this trouble trying to get a tv working from the s-video output alongside a monitor on vga.  Any idea what a simple method to achieve that goal might be?  Again, thanks for your help.
2009-06-15T22:50:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	sorry for leaving had a minor prob had to fix did it work?
2009-06-15T23:04:00.000Z	user___	ctmjr	yes, thanks a lot.  Should I try to reinstall the ATI drivers from the ATI site or do you think it will just screw up again?
2009-06-15T23:06:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	the new ati drivers do not support your card and a whole lot of other ones that is why it would not work you can either use an older ati driver or install open source drivers
2009-06-15T23:12:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	if i had a choice i would use nvidia with linux but do not know much about them the open source radeon driver  has 3d for you card i believe
2009-06-15T23:15:00.000Z	ctmjr	user___	your welcome
