2007-10-22T23:19:00.000Z	orduek		and how you get along?
2007-10-22T23:21:00.000Z	orduek		so, anyone has better rate than 60hz?
2007-10-22T23:23:00.000Z	orduek		does anyone knows how can i change my screen rate?
2007-10-22T23:23:00.000Z	orduek		yes?
2007-10-22T23:23:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	did you try the "system -> administration -> screens and graphics" application?
2007-10-22T23:24:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	did you try selecting another monitor model there?
2007-10-22T23:25:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	did you try "plug and play" as monitor model?
2007-10-22T23:27:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	do you have a windows driver file for the monitor (an .inf file)?
2007-10-22T23:27:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	that could be useful
2007-10-22T23:27:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	then ubuntu can get the supported screen modes etc. from that file
2007-10-22T23:27:00.000Z	orduek	oliver_g1	one sec
2007-10-22T23:34:00.000Z	orduek	oliver_g1	do i need the screen driver or the graphic card driver?
2007-10-22T23:35:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	the screen driver
2007-10-22T23:35:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	could be that the screen driver is a big package with mostly useless stuff :-) but you only need the .inf file(s) from the screen driver
2007-10-22T23:39:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	didn't you find a .inf file for your monitor?
2007-10-22T23:39:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	oh i see
2007-10-22T23:40:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	missed your two messages
2007-10-22T23:40:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	what model is your monitor exactly?
2007-10-22T23:42:00.000Z	oliver_g1	orduek	go to system -> administration -> screens & graphics (or whatever its calle din english :)
2007-10-22T23:42:00.000Z	orduek	oliver_g1	i think i got it
