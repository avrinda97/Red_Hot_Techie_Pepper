2007-12-22T22:03:00.000Z	Stavros		anyone know which package i can remove to have all graphics removed?
2007-12-22T22:03:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	xserver-xorg, xfonts-*dpi gdm
2007-12-22T22:04:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	tried that, none are installed :/
2007-12-22T22:04:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	and you still have graphical environment?
2007-12-22T22:05:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	i have the packages, not the environment
2007-12-22T22:06:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	i was left with the impression that you are asking which packages to remove in order not to have graphical environment any more. did i misunderstood you?
2007-12-22T22:07:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	hmm, i didn't say it correctly. i want all the graphical packages to be removed, not just the environment
2007-12-22T22:08:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	all the packages that depend on X, that is
2007-12-22T22:10:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	well if you have used aptitude to install the packages, it will deinstall all automaticlly installed dependencies. this is the only dpkg frontend which does this. if you haven't used aptitude your sole option will be to mark _all_ packages as installed automatically and then mark every one you want to keep as installed manually. but this is a lot of work and you can hose your system if you don't know what you are doing exactly
2007-12-22T22:10:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	i installed the standar ubuntu install and i wanted to remove desktop afterwards because it's headless, and i don't need the packages. i'm using aptitude for everything, though
2007-12-22T22:11:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	can i mark everything as automatically installed and remove a package the graphical ones depend on?
2007-12-22T22:11:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	so you should not have any more graphical packages on your system any more (this is if you have deinstalled the ones i mentioned)
2007-12-22T22:12:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	but i do :/
2007-12-22T22:12:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	in aptitude to to "installed packages" and press M
2007-12-22T22:12:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	this will mark all packages in the section "installed" as automatically installed
2007-12-22T22:13:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	be careful. some packges really _need_ to be there in order for your system to work at all
2007-12-22T22:14:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	yes, i'll be careful not to remove those
2007-12-22T22:14:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	i did what you said
2007-12-22T22:15:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	which you good luck. it's funny the first time you do this. i received messages like "please type 'i am aware that i know that i am doing something really stupid right now' in order to remove this package". have fun :-)
2007-12-22T22:16:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	pressing "m" (this is small caps m) marks a package as manually installed
2007-12-22T22:16:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	yes, i have to do it for each one though :/
2007-12-22T22:17:00.000Z	velko	Stavros	i think so. but you don't have to do it for every single one. get frist the "key" packges. they will pull all they dependencies
2007-12-22T22:18:00.000Z	Stavros	velko	figures, thanks a lot
