2005-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	TSWoodV		Anyone else seeing lockups in firefox in hoary?>
2005-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	yes and no.
2005-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	i think it is either the flash or java plugin getting thrown some bad code and killing X
2005-02-24T11:22:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	prolly thru the flash plugin
2005-02-24T11:22:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	but it only happens to me if i have a bunch of tabs open
2005-02-24T11:23:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	I've not loaded any plugins - no flash, no java.
2005-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	I've gotten it to fail once with just a single tab.
2005-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	sorry then, i don't know.  but I get your problem from time to time with many tabs and flash
2005-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	all tho, it used to be worse.
2005-02-24T11:25:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	it was real bad cuz my agp card and 1pci slot were sharing irq's
2005-02-24T11:25:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	I thought I'd mangled my profile, but that's not the case either.
2005-02-24T11:25:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	i fixed that and the crashing almost never happens now.
2005-02-24T11:25:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	don't know if that would be something for you to check
2005-02-24T11:30:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	this just started about 3 days ago.
2005-02-24T11:30:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	ah.  this has been going on for me during warty and hoary
2005-02-24T11:31:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	it only seems to happen on the hoary laptop.  I've got a strange, small form factor desktop that doesn't do this.
2005-02-24T11:32:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	x86 lappy ?
2005-02-24T11:32:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	P4
2005-02-24T11:32:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	x86.  dunno, sorry.  my story is different.
2005-02-24T11:33:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	anyway, if I kill the esd daemon, I don't have the problem any more.
2005-02-24T11:34:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	maybe it is an irq issue w/ your sound card ?
2005-02-24T11:35:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	maybe check your irq's, just to be certain
2005-02-24T11:36:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	all is good. ACPI is actually working as it should (hallelujah!).  It's just the age old problem of esd hogging /dev/dsp.  And that's even with alsa installed.  One of the days it just might get sorted out...
