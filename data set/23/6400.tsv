2006-07-10T10:01:00.000Z	jon_		Could someone tell me how to get Root again? I forgot :\
2006-07-10T10:01:00.000Z	jon_		Thank you! I kenw it was something like that :D
2006-07-10T10:02:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	"sudo -s -H", "sudo -i", "sudo su", "sudo bash", "sudo sh"
2006-07-10T10:15:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	linstdc++.so.5
2006-07-10T10:15:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	"ls /lib/libstdc*"
2006-07-10T10:17:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	That command shows you what libraries you have which have "libstdc" at the beginning. There may not be a .so.5, but there may be a .so.6 or something which you could make a link to
2006-07-10T10:18:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	Try /usr/lib
2006-07-10T10:19:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	Yeah, but you can't link a random library to replace an unrelated one
2006-07-10T10:20:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	libc is for C, linstdc++ is something to do with C++ (they are very different)
2006-07-10T10:21:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	In case you didn't notice, the ".so.X" are links to the ".so" files anyway
2006-07-10T10:22:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	Your program is just out of date and doesn't know the new one
2006-07-29T08:15:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	The bootsplash is, like, 16 colour 640x480. I am suprised the frequency is not also conservative
2006-07-29T08:17:00.000Z	jon_	Warbo	its 69Hz!
2006-08-05T11:32:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	You need linstdc++5
2006-08-05T11:32:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	sudo apt-get install libstdc++5
2006-08-05T11:33:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	Exactly
2006-08-05T11:41:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	Why not get it from Applications>Add/Remove?
2006-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	Really? It puts it in the Applications>Graphics menu for me
2006-08-05T11:45:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	That is what it does. The package doesn't actually contain realplayer, it contains a script which downloads realplayer from the site, extracts it, installs it then puts it in the menus
2006-08-05T11:46:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	OK
2006-08-05T11:46:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	I find that it runs with sudo ./filename.bin then tell it to go in /usr/lib/realplayer
2006-08-05T11:49:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	MLDonkey can use souldseek I think
2006-08-05T12:03:00.000Z	Warbo	jon_	KDE will not work without GNU
