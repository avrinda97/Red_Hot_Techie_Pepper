2006-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	xed2		ok, so uh that wiki didnt help me for starting SSH at all, just for creating a key ...
2006-08-06T08:06:00.000Z	xed2		and only the DSA key, not the RSA
2006-08-06T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	if you install openssh-server, it is set up and started automatically
2006-08-06T08:10:00.000Z	xed2	sethk	openssh-server is already the newest version.
2006-08-06T08:11:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	You lost me now.  You were asking about creating the keys and starting the server, and I said that doing apt-get install openssh-server creates the keys and starts the server automatically.
2006-08-06T08:11:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	so where are we now?
2006-08-06T08:12:00.000Z	xed2	sethk	sorry for the confusion really, but apparently i was trying to setup SSH for a friend to access my box, foo actually, well then apparently i got some weird errors, then  i came to you, did apt-get install and it said i have the latest versoin, but when i attempt to start the service i get an error with DSA and RSA keys not found
2006-08-06T08:13:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	ah, ok.  we can try a dpkg-reconfigure.  if that fails try to uninstall the package and then install it again.
2006-08-06T08:14:00.000Z	xed2	sethk	thanks
2006-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	try uninstall, then install.
2006-08-06T08:23:00.000Z	xed2	sethk	fool told me to pastebin my error, its quite weird, i unsintalled, reinstalled, it created keys during installation fine and all, but refuses to start, take a look please, it would be ever so appreciated =)
2006-08-06T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	looking
2006-08-06T08:24:00.000Z	xed2	sethk	thanks !
2006-08-06T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	do ls -l /etc/ssh       make sure all the files are owned by root, group root, and permissions -rw-r--r--  (for ssh_host_dsa_key and ssh_host_rsa_key  -rw-------)
2006-08-06T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	if that looks normal, I would erase all the files in that directory and do the uninstall and then install again (Or reconfigure, if that worked)
2006-08-06T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	erase all the files in /etc/ssh.   back them up first, though, to be safe.
2006-08-06T08:27:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	-rw------- is correct for ssh_host_dsa_key and ssh_host_rsa_key
2006-08-06T08:28:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	I'm thinking that /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key is corrupted or damaged.  I would erase the files in /etc/ssh and then uninstall and install.  (or dpkg-reconfigure, if that worked)
2006-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	xed2	sethk	alright thanks ill do that, however im pretty sure dpkg worked, there were no errors, should i try that again first ?
2006-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	yes, I would.  delete the files in /etc/ssh, do the reconfigure, then do an ls -l of /etc/ssh
2006-08-06T08:29:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	if reconfigure creates the files, then you should be ok.  by the way, do    ps aux | grep sshd    to make sure ssh isn't already running
2006-08-06T08:30:00.000Z	sethk	xed2	I don't think it is, with a corrupted file, but check it anyway, since it only takes a second.
2006-08-06T08:31:00.000Z	xed2	sethk	thanks a lot, ill try to let you know what happpens
