2012-04-26T11:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	try disabling n speed with modprobe options
2012-04-26T11:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	is it a centrino wifi chi
2012-04-26T11:03:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	It's a 4965AGN
2012-04-26T11:03:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	It's probably best I don't try to troubleshoot this now, given that I'm not actually on Ubuntu... if I were, I wouldn't be able to get to this chatroom :)
2012-04-26T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	try disabling n speed, may give a stable connection
2012-04-26T11:04:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	I'll try that, though I sure as heck won't be happy about connecting to my university's obscenely fast network with slow wireless :-/
2012-04-26T11:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	at 54mbps you'll be fine
2012-04-26T11:05:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	But how will I download the latest Ubuntu image in approximately a minute??! It will be a sad, sad existence.
2012-04-26T11:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	just grab the daily now, then upgrade into the stable.
2012-04-26T11:07:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	I was mostly joking :)
2012-04-26T11:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	if you run: sudo lshw -C network    you will see the driver module driving the device and you can then see how to disable n speed using websearches
2012-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	I'll try disabling N, sounds like a reasonable if regrettable workaround. But, curious, why do you think that might work?
2012-04-26T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	it's worked in the past. Some chips have issues with it.
2012-04-26T11:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	or use the lshw output to find guides which may allow you to keep n with other options
2012-05-06T11:15:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	that sure isn't an alternative to VNC...
2012-05-06T11:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	works here, i manage torrents, regular downloads, samba, updates and local media playback using those 2 methods
2012-05-06T11:17:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	I get that it certainly works, but it's an alternative to VNC the way Lynx is an alternative to Firefox. The command-line is powerful, but if you want a GUI, you use VNC.
2012-05-06T11:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	transmission and fatrat have nice web UIs which you can manage stuff with very well. There are also smartphone apps to manage via the same web ui
2012-05-06T11:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	depends what you need. I can add and remove samba shareeditting smb.conf, much sleeker than VNCing on and using nautilus
2012-05-06T11:18:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	that's true, I don't know fatrat but Transmission's webUI is great.
2012-05-06T11:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	fatrat can download non-torrent files for you :), it also manages torrents but there is no android app for fatrat yet, so I use transmission
2012-05-06T11:19:00.000Z	cdm10	ActionParsnip	again, not saying that SSH doesn't fulfill the "remotely access computer" requirement, but that it doesn't fulfill the "remotely access computer's GUI" requirement, which many people do want.
2012-05-06T11:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdm10	depends what you are accesing the gui to do, a lot of the time its not needed
