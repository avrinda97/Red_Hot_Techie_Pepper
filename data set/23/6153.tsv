2006-12-15T06:32:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		I dont' want to get rid of rhythmbox
2006-12-15T06:32:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		Bruenig, I'm signed in on 2 computers.  it's to differentiate where I am.
2006-12-15T06:33:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		Anyways, I don't want to worry about KDE stuff.
2006-12-15T06:34:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		Is there a way to get rhythmbox to play my files?
2006-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		Any of them!
2006-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		My MP3's, the Battlefield Modcast which I host
2006-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		I'm not that stupid...
2006-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		You wish.
2006-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	monkey050-Ubuntu		I installed them ALL
2006-12-15T06:36:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	you have been to the restricted formats page of the wiki?
2006-12-15T06:36:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	rhythmbox should work then. You didn't use anything else, automatix maybe...
2006-12-15T06:37:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	what all did you install then
2006-12-15T06:39:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	what about gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
2006-12-15T06:40:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	do sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
2006-12-15T06:41:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	well you certainly do know it all. Now tell me why exactly mp3's aren't playing
2006-12-15T06:42:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	was that the rhythmbox that came with it. I know some scripts will install a newer version...
2006-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	what is rhythmbox doing when you play mp3's
2006-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	have you tried right clicking on an mp3 and then opening with rhythmbox
2006-12-15T06:47:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	it skips it or gives an error or what
2006-12-15T06:47:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	does it launch?
2006-12-15T06:48:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	what was the problem then?
2006-12-15T06:48:00.000Z	bruenig	monkey050-Ubuntu	I am just that good of a helper
