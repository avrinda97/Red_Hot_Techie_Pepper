2005-10-01T11:52:00.000Z	bob2	coz	works fine for me
2005-10-01T11:52:00.000Z	bob2	coz	I don't see where you explained your exact issue, tho
2005-10-01T11:54:00.000Z	bob2	coz	don't use totem then
2005-10-01T11:54:00.000Z	bob2	coz	mplayer doesn't work?
2005-10-01T11:54:00.000Z	bob2	coz	er, reinstalling in the hope of fixing this is silly
2005-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	bob2	coz	mplayer didn't work?
2005-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	coz	"didn't work" is not a useful description of the error mplayer gave you
2005-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	coz	that sounds a lot more like you not running it correctly
2005-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	coz	what command line did you give to mplayer?
2005-10-01T11:57:00.000Z	bob2	coz	then don't say things like "mplayer didn't work", when in realiy you didn't try it
2005-10-01T11:57:00.000Z	bob2	coz	ok
2005-10-01T11:58:00.000Z	bob2	coz	then instead of saying "mplayer didn't work!", tell us what you tried
2005-10-01T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	coz	so, stop whinging
2005-10-01T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	coz	and install mplayer
2005-10-01T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	coz	then come back
2005-10-01T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	coz	pkill esd ; mplayer -vo xv -ao oss dvd://1
2005-10-01T12:00:00.000Z	bob2	coz	run that, then if it doesn't work, put the error on pastebin.ca
2005-10-01T12:01:00.000Z	bob2	coz	so, you don't have mplayer installed at all
2005-10-01T12:01:00.000Z	bob2	coz	go install it and come back
2005-11-16T17:39:00.000Z	bob2	coz	I wouldn't trust binary, closed-source stuff to touch my filesystem
