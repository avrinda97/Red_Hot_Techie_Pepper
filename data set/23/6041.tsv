2008-06-02T15:15:00.000Z	ariqs		argh, over half the stuff I try to compile that's for linux, won't compile in ubuntu
2008-06-02T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	what are you trying to build ?
2008-06-02T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	whats the problem with it ?
2008-07-02T13:38:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	you could remove it - but I'd advise you to just wait for ubuntu to fix it
2008-07-02T13:39:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	if you install your own version of pidgen you'll lose package manager awareness of pidgen and as pidgin is linked into the desktop packages, I don't think thats the best thing to do
2008-07-02T13:39:00.000Z	ariqs	ikonia	is there anyway I can keep my current configuration and just copy over the new version parts?
2008-07-02T13:40:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	how quick the response will be will most probably depend on how serious the fault is, I would expect pidgin to be a quick turn around
2008-07-02T13:42:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	as pidgin is a core part of ubuntu , and icq a core function, I think it's a reasonable assumption to say this is on the high list
2008-08-03T23:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	one that has drivers in built into the kernel, no 3rd party. Intel are normally a solid chipset
2008-08-03T23:55:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	the products change on a regular basis hence why anyone listed in the hcl list I posted you would be safe
2008-08-03T23:55:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	if you read the information given to you which is very speicifc, before asking for something more specific you'll get a better result
2008-08-03T23:56:00.000Z	ariqs	ikonia	Maybe I'm lazy ;)
2008-08-03T23:56:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	then you won't get very far
2008-08-03T23:57:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	what's the point of asking for help if your too lazy to absorb the advice
2008-08-03T23:57:00.000Z	ariqs	ikonia	I would like the brand/model of wifi card that's just common available at someplace like walmart ;P I had to compile drivers for my current modem, which annoyed me
2008-08-03T23:57:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	and I gave you a list
2008-08-03T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	hence why I find your lack of reading the list and subsiquent "I want something more specific" time wasting
2008-08-03T23:58:00.000Z	ariqs	ikonia	the list doesn't answer my full question. Or at least the intent of my question.
2008-08-03T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	you've not read it
2008-08-03T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	don't lie - you admited you've not read it
2008-08-03T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	the list of wirless adaptors is listed, has "works out of the box" tick box which wouldn't be more clear
2008-08-03T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	ok - so it lists cards supported out of the box - what part of that does not answer your question
2008-08-04T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ariqs	how are we meant to know walmarts stock - take the list and see which one walmart sells
