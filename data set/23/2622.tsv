2010-08-06T16:40:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	 good catch... I just woke up  :)
2010-08-12T08:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	coz_	all they have to do is ask
2010-08-12T08:47:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	  this is so true
2010-08-15T19:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	coz_	bad disk drive supperblock error?
2010-08-15T19:56:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	 not sure  apparenlty bootfail   has an issue   http://pastebin.com/w8cmdVKr
2010-08-15T19:57:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	 I have not often seen this occur  so it is puzzlingme
2010-08-15T19:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	coz_	that last tells me almost nothing.  does it get as far as mounting the root dir ?  if not grub problem?  otherwise do a fsck /dev/sda1 and other disks you use
2010-08-15T19:59:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	 not sure you may have to ask  bootfail   about it since he is the one experiencing it
2010-08-16T06:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	coz_	but does the default nvidea let you have transparant background?  maybe that's a compiz thing?
2010-08-16T06:17:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	 sure with compositing on  either compiz or matacity's compositing
2010-08-16T06:17:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	 i would suggest compiz for that however
2010-08-16T06:18:00.000Z	coz_	sacarlson	 and I would suggest also the nvidia_current  driver
