2010-10-25T23:16:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	you can try formatting the drive you want to store it on with another format that supports larger files than FAT32
2010-10-25T23:18:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	not an option i have more than 400gb of data on this hdd and its the only place that has that much data storage i would lose a ton of data
2010-10-25T23:19:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	you might have to invest in more storage then
2010-10-25T23:20:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	saving for a new computer this one is trash no extra cash
2010-10-25T23:22:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	can you maybe borrow another hard drive off a friend or something?
2010-10-25T23:23:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	lol Otaku = no friends/life
2010-10-25T23:25:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	I don't think that will work, because FAT32 doesn't support files that large :S
2010-10-25T23:26:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	also a good point but i have a 6gb movie on my fat32 hdd that got there from downloading it
2010-10-25T23:26:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	but linux stops it at 4.0gb
2010-10-25T23:27:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	that doesn't even make sense... but it sounds like it might work then :D
2010-10-25T23:30:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	llutz and I don't get it either... how you ever managed to get a 6 GB file onto a FAT32 drive is beyond us
2010-10-25T23:30:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	i wish i knew
2010-10-25T23:37:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	the 6 GB file is a video, right? are you able to watch the entire video OK?
2010-10-25T23:37:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	no comp sucks wont play it because its 720p :(
2010-10-25T23:37:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	can you play it on the PS3?
2010-10-25T23:38:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	no its mkv format
2010-10-25T23:38:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	so what exactly was the point of getting the file in the first place? :S
2010-10-25T23:39:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	I'd just stick to what my machine could handle lol
2010-10-25T23:42:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	so why not
2010-10-25T23:44:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	maybe you can help me with 1 other thing
2010-10-25T23:45:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	when i plug my headphones to the front port on the computer i lose all sound on my computer but when its pluged in the back i can still hear
2010-10-25T23:45:00.000Z	lancesrage	Mav_Merekat	and it wont restore audio untill i restart
2010-10-25T23:46:00.000Z	Mav_Merekat	lancesrage	I have no idea about that one. I have onboard AC`97 and a Creative Labs card, but all my jacks for it are at the rear of my machine
