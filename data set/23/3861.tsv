2010-06-15T06:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	once you get use the output we can help
2010-06-15T07:01:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	Sorry, I was following the instructions on the link from ubottu.
2010-06-15T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	sudo apt-get install pastebinit; dpkg -l | grep flash > ~/flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash >>~/flash; dpkg -l | grep swf >> ~/flash; pastebinit ~/flash; rm ~/flash
2010-06-15T07:03:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	Only one package installed: flashplugin64-installer
2010-06-15T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	ok then what's the problem? I use flashplugin64-installer :)
2010-06-15T07:04:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	Well, before I started tonight, video would play really fast and no sound. Now, flash doesn't work at all.
2010-06-15T07:04:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	In either Firefox or Chromium.
2010-06-15T07:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	i'd remove it, then reinstall it
2010-06-15T07:04:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	Been there, done that, 3 times.
2010-06-15T07:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	make sure you remove the config (or use --purge) to completely remove it
2010-06-15T07:05:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	Even used purge.
2010-06-15T07:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	ok when you go to use flash, do you get ANYTHING (even a white / black box)?
2010-06-15T07:06:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	In FF, I get nothing, In Chromium, I get a little black box with a sickly computer icon in it and a message which reads that the plugin crashed.
2010-06-15T07:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	hmm, have you tried removing the package and manually copying the .so file to /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins
2010-06-15T07:08:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	If I remove the package, how would I copy the so file?!?
2010-06-15T07:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	you head to the adobe site and grab the 64bit tar.gz
2010-06-15T07:09:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	OK, got the plugin showing up again, but it is back to playing at 4x speed and no sound.
2010-06-15T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	hmmm - http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10_64bit.html
2010-06-15T07:11:00.000Z	DSpair	ActionParsnip	That's not helpful at all.... :P
2010-06-15T07:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DSpair	looks like you'll need to use the PPA version or use flashplugin-installer whic will use nspluginwrapper
