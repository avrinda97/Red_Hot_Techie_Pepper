2006-09-12T05:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	yes, /msg ChanServ help
2006-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	could you clue me in as to whcih option i should look at
2006-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	there seems to be a plethora of them
2006-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	i don't recall, but if you need me to, i can go look myself
2006-09-12T05:34:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	ah, that's ok. I thought you knew of it offhand
2006-09-12T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	maybe i was thinking of another services?  i guess dancer doesn't do it, but you can set it in xchat configuration
2006-09-12T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	which irc client do you use?
2006-09-12T05:36:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	I'm guessing nickserv would be the only other option, as chanserv seems to be channel-specific (where I'd actually own the channel)
2006-09-12T05:36:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	gaim
2006-09-12T05:37:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	though I've been using irssi up until now
2006-09-12T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	i did help, and help set, for both ChanServ and NickServ, i don't think dancer-services supports that
2006-09-12T05:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	sudo apt-get install xchat, gaim is rather un-featureful for irc
2006-09-12T05:39:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	i'd like to avoid xchat. btw, i found http://wiki.freeculture.org/index.php/IRC_with_Gaim :D
2006-09-12T05:40:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	I'm quite fond of the 2.00beta release of gaim
2006-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	i was a bit of a console-junkie before using ubuntu
2006-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	said 'f*ck it' and went with gui alternatives instead :)
2006-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	i only have 1.5.1cvs, from dapper
2006-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	there's an unofficial build floating around somewhere
2006-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	came across it on the forums
2006-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	seems like it will be in edgy too
2006-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	if you'd like, i could find the apt entry
2006-09-12T05:43:00.000Z	ootput	eyequeue	i think so
2006-09-25T09:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	ootput	that's for non-login shells, you don't want a path there heh
