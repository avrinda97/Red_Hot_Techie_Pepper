2007-09-23T11:25:00.000Z	tr4sh80_	erUSUL	i just need an uncompiled kernel file to make a driver
2007-09-23T11:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	tr4sh80_	you mean that you need the kernel 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)' to compile a driver?
2007-09-23T11:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	tr4sh80_	or you need the source code of a specific driver?
