2009-12-17T12:26:00.000Z	funkiwan	mobi-sheep	sorry, can't connect via wifi with wep 128-bit encryption

2009-12-17T12:27:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	funkiwan	WEP is terrible and easy to crack. Go with WPA.

2009-12-17T12:29:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	funkiwan	Have you seen !wireless yet?
2009-12-17T12:30:00.000Z	funkiwan	mobi-sheep	accessing...
2009-12-17T12:30:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	funkiwan	Any chance you can go on without encryption?
2009-12-17T12:31:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	funkiwan	As a temporary solution or something. A new router costs about $20 today.
2009-12-17T12:31:00.000Z	funkiwan	mobi-sheep	it's my housemate's router, but it's a good point
2009-12-17T12:32:00.000Z	funkiwan	mobi-sheep	i've just been tentative b/c i don't want to go through the hassle of an install and then find out i can't do encrypted wireless
2009-12-17T13:22:00.000Z	funkiwan	mobi-sheep	any recs for a decent wireless router?
2009-12-17T13:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	funkiwan	Recs?
2009-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	funkiwan	mobi-sheep	recommendations?
2009-12-17T13:24:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	funkiwan	Err. To each his own. Myself, I'd find a router that is compatible for Tomato Firmware (http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato) and flash it to take full advantage. Most common routers have WPA support.
2009-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	funkiwan	That is crazy, right? Go to store and find a router for decent price is all I can say.
2009-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	funkiwan	mobi-sheep	thanks for the help and advice.
