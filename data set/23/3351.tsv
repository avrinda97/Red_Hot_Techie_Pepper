2008-05-08T04:01:00.000Z	trebel		anyone available to help me troubleshoot a nvidia video card/driver problem in hardy?
2008-05-08T04:02:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	I have Nivida too
2008-05-08T04:02:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	was up?
2008-05-08T04:02:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	i just updated to hardy, when i try to start up X, i keep getting errors and vesa loads
2008-05-08T04:03:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	yeah I had problems updating too. So I did a totally new fresh install and everything now works
2008-05-08T04:03:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	you had video problems in particular?
2008-05-08T04:04:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	hardy in general but a new install instead of upgrading, fixed it
2008-05-08T04:04:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	why cant you do a new fresh install, using ALTERNATIVE ISO?
2008-05-08T04:05:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	i'm not just using packages, i have a lot of source builds also that i'd like to keep intact
2008-05-08T04:05:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	but what else can you do if its not working? :P
2008-05-08T04:06:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	just sad that its come to this, rather than fix something in linux, i have to format and reinstall, if that's what i wanted i'd still use windows
2008-05-08T04:06:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	if you have time and patience, I am sure there a solution though
2008-05-08T04:06:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	have you asked a ubuntu developer?
2008-05-08T04:07:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	no, do you know one?
2008-05-08T04:07:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	Envy & Automatix2 don't have Hardy Heron versions yet do they?
2008-05-08T04:08:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	the only solution I found, but please realise I am a noob, was to do a fresh install instead of upgrading.  But thwere may be a solution for you upgrading
2008-05-08T04:08:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	i've seen envy, but haven't heard anything about automatix, i'm just pissed my kernel headers are all messed up
2008-05-08T04:10:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	have u tried to manusally edit the xorg.conf?
2008-05-08T04:10:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	oh yeah, lots
2008-05-08T04:11:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	danmn, ok, sorry I cannot be any help
2008-05-08T04:11:00.000Z	trebel	tommy	no worries, thanks for the try
2008-05-08T04:12:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	have u tried envyng?
2008-05-08T04:12:00.000Z	tommy	trebel	may be worth a shot
