2007-11-25T04:03:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	same for lightning ?
2007-11-25T04:03:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	yep
2007-11-25T04:04:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	though actually sunbird 0.7 doesnt work for me done that way.  could just be my computer, though.  i tried compiling it from source and that didnt work either, but compiling works for the mozilla folks which is why i think it's just my box
2007-11-25T04:04:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	thunderbird is available from getdeb.net
2007-11-25T04:04:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	as a deb
2007-11-25T04:05:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	sunbird or thunderbird ?
2007-11-25T04:05:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	thunderbird can come from getdeb.net.   32bit ones work fine on 64bit linux
2007-11-25T04:06:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	the reason there's different versions is that while mozilla releases the same versions for linux, what's in the ubuntu repositories might be different because those dont get upgraded for new verisons, just for security updates
2007-11-25T04:07:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	I know, I had a long discution with Amaranth about that ...
2007-11-25T04:10:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	I suggested that maybe Ubuntu should do a release once in a year of the base OS, and let client applications upgrades enter continually in the repositories
2007-11-25T04:10:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	there are rolling-release distros.  arch comes to mind
2007-11-25T04:11:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	I will check that, but well only ubuntu suits me on the philosphy of user friendlyness, package availability etcetera
2007-11-25T04:13:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	unfortunely I also need to install the thunderbird binary, because lightning is not compatible with my 64 bit version
2007-11-25T04:13:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	thunderbird binary is on getdeb.net
2007-11-25T04:13:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	I didn't knew this site
2007-11-25T04:15:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	what is the interest of this website in fact ?
2007-11-25T04:15:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	it provides packages for ubuntu for programs not found in ubuntu's repos or updated versions of low-priority programs
2007-11-25T04:16:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	ok that's what I am looking for then
2007-11-25T04:16:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	maybe someday it will be a ubuntu official unofficial repository ^^
2007-11-25T04:25:00.000Z	mirak	macogw	I couldn't find a thunderbird binary
2007-11-25T04:26:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	oh hey you're right.  hold on.  it must be in a repo then.  lemme find it
2007-11-25T04:26:00.000Z	macogw	mirak	i just pm'd you. did you get it?
