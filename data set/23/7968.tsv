2005-03-30T15:32:00.000Z	membreya	djp	just to be sure, in the terminal type sudo -s, to do a cd /var/lib/slocate and see if slocate.db is there
2005-03-30T15:41:00.000Z	djp	membreya	sorry, disappeared, due to responsibilities for a certain 2 year old! was going to ask you what the message i received referred too?

2005-03-30T15:52:00.000Z	djp	membreya	do i need to run the command that was reported as being run as a cron job? i.e., test -e /usr/sbin/anacron || run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily
