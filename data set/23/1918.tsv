2009-09-12T02:35:00.000Z	djbpython		so its normal that if I want to change the permissions of a file i need to drop in to a terminal?
2009-09-12T02:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	no unless you are not the owner of the file
2009-09-12T02:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	and if you are not the owner you have no bussines changing them; do you ?
2009-09-12T02:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	no; is not ridicoulus. system config files like http.conf have to be editoed as superuser,. Use "Cgksudo gedit /etc/path/to/file"
2009-09-12T02:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	"gksudo gedit /etc/path/to/file"
2009-09-12T02:40:00.000Z	djbpython	erUSUL	again, the need to drop to the terminal
2009-09-12T02:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	use the alt + f2 run dialog if you prefer it
2009-09-12T02:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	but you know linux people are fond of our terminals not ashamed of using them ;)
2009-09-26T01:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	you have to use sudo to writte there
2009-09-26T01:43:00.000Z	djbpython	erUSUL	but I am using gedit
2009-09-26T01:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	save the scriptt in your home then move or copy it to /usr/local/bin/
2009-09-26T01:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	you should have used « gksudo gedit » in thwe first place so the error is between the chair and the keyboard not in linux
2009-09-26T01:46:00.000Z	djbpython	erUSUL	possibly, but don't you see the backwardness of such a process?
2009-09-26T01:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	i see why it is needed. to prevent linux to become a virus loaded windows clone
2009-09-26T01:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	if you want to writte whatever you want just install windows. you and anyone else will be able to writte whatever they please virus trojans malware all wriitting all over your hard drive... but hey at least i can too yay!!!
2009-10-23T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	if you want to run it automatically add a line like this to the beginning of the file → #!/bin/sh
2009-10-23T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	then make it executable. chamod +x script
2009-10-23T00:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	what does « ./script.sh  » do ?
2009-10-23T00:17:00.000Z	djbpython	erUSUL	aha yes that works
2009-10-23T00:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	basic shell knowledge. things not in $PATH (the variable) nee to be explicity called with full path to run them
2009-10-23T00:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	./ is the current folder (and ../ its parent )
2009-10-23T00:19:00.000Z	djbpython	erUSUL	do some shells include . in the PATH?
2009-10-23T00:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	djbpython	very bath idea security wise ( DOS did that )
