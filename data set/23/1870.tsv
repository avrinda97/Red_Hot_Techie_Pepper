2009-09-25T12:12:00.000Z	Tvmbledown		Hi, guys. Back with another set of interesting questions.
2009-09-25T12:13:00.000Z	Tvmbledown		I need to install Ubuntu on an EXTREMELY low-end system - an old ThinkPad 600, with a Pentium II and about 128 megs of ram.
2009-09-25T12:13:00.000Z	Tvmbledown		And I need to do it WITHOUT access to the internet.
2009-09-25T12:14:00.000Z	Tvmbledown		Also, I really really want to be able to run some kind of desktop environment.
2009-09-25T12:14:00.000Z	Tvmbledown		It runs the Mepis variant, AntiX, without much trouble.
2009-09-25T12:15:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	you might be better off with a small footprint system like DSL or similar (DSL = Damn Small Linux)
2009-09-25T12:16:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	 I'm actually using AntiX on it, which is a Mepis-based system (still Debian), after trying out DSL.
2009-09-25T12:16:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	However, I have no way of getting internet access on this thing, and I want to add a few games.
2009-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	I haven't come up with any other way to do it than grabbing the packages on a net-capable machine and installing them... But the packages are ubuntu-specific.
2009-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	usb port?
2009-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	Got one, so a flash drive is possible, but I can't boot from it - BIOS doesn't support it.
2009-09-25T12:18:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	that's alright, just download on another computer and then put them on usb stick and transfer to laptop
2009-09-25T12:19:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	Yeah... That's what would be pretty awesome, but it hasn't worked like that so far. The packages are Ubuntu-specific, and I'm running into some problems there, mainly dependency-related.
2009-09-25T12:20:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	if you go to http://packages.ubuntu.com you can search for packages and it will tell you what packages depend on what
2009-09-25T12:22:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	Is there a way to do that for Debian systems other than Ubuntu? Specifically in this instance, AntiX (a Mepis variant).
2009-09-25T12:23:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	yep, try http://packages.debian.org
2009-09-25T12:23:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	I may be misunderstanding, but they all look ubuntu-specific.
2009-09-25T12:24:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	sorry... hang on for a sec
2009-09-25T12:26:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	you could download the big dvd image
2009-09-25T12:26:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	The alternative I'm totally open to is, Install Ubuntu to the laptop... Problem is, the laptop A) is very very very low-end in terms of speed and RAM, and B) has NO internet access of any kind. This means a standard install would make for a brutally slow machine, and...
2009-09-25T12:26:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	And the "LowMemorySystem" install on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems wouldn't work.
2009-09-25T12:27:00.000Z	Tvmbledown	mechdave	In what way would that help? :) No DVD drive, and slow slow slow machine.
2009-09-25T12:28:00.000Z	mechdave	Tvmbledown	I think we should take ourselves to #ubuntu-offtopic to continue our conversation :)
