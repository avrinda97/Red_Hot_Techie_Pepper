2009-01-02T23:33:00.000Z	gein		I'm suffering from iowait problems. Right now I'm partitioning a 500GB USB drive and iowait is up to 100%, system load is 5-6.. is this really normal?
2009-01-02T23:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	It isnt one of those passports is it
2009-01-02T23:34:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	?
2009-01-02T23:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	It isnt one of those passports is it       .as in what make and model of drive
2009-01-02T23:36:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	oh, the drive is a Western Digital MyBook and the system is running Ubuntu 8.04 server edition
2009-01-02T23:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	I seem to remember they had some "Feature" you had to use windows machine to turn off.. you might need to google it as not many will know
2009-01-02T23:37:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	im suffering from iowait problems even when cping files on the regular local sata drives
2009-01-02T23:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	ah.. different issue if internals are the same.. even with the external unplugged?
2009-01-02T23:38:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	haven't tried disconnecting the usb drive, will that make any sense?
2009-01-02T23:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	I know those drives have caused issues and it would be worth a quick look
2009-01-02T23:39:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	but the problem might have started when I first plugged in the drive actually
2009-01-02T23:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	tracker may be sucking up your cycles too.
2009-01-02T23:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	no
2009-01-02T23:47:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	will it harm the disk?
2009-01-02T23:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	it cant do it any good.. leave it for a bit and then kill it if you must
2009-01-02T23:48:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	it has been left for quite some time now iowait still at max and it doesn't seem to finish
2009-01-02T23:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	do what you have to do...  and also check google on a power saving feature etc on that drive
2009-01-02T23:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	Personally, I would try to shutdown the system and hope it did less damage
2009-01-02T23:51:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	okay, hmm
2009-01-02T23:52:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	kill -9 doesn't seem to have any effect, the process is still there
2009-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	reboot doesn't even seem to be enough to get the system down ;)
2009-01-02T23:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	gein	I wish I had an answer
2009-01-02T23:58:00.000Z	gein	Jack_Sparrow	I know, i'll go for the hard reset now, brb
