2010-09-03T03:00:00.000Z	DrGrov		So nobody knows how to help me on that issue?
2010-09-03T03:02:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	you should be able to select a different kernel from the grub menu?
2010-09-03T03:02:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	No I can not select. It will automatically reboot with the one it has. I have just followed Update Manager on the suggestions.
2010-09-03T03:04:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	there must be a way to select an older kernel in grub2.  i'm just not sure of the method.  if you give me a second, i can try in a vm.
2010-09-03T03:04:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	No problem, that is okay. It seems like it is just patches to the current kernel... I have not installed any kernel by myself, just followed every Update Manager suggestion what I should install..
2010-09-03T03:05:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	actually, it will take me awhile.  we should google, it will probably be more expedient.
2010-09-03T03:06:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	Sure thing. No hurries. I am really getting a bit frustrated with the issues I have.
2010-09-03T03:07:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	i feel you.  but i think the understanding is worth the headache.
2010-09-03T03:08:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	Yes, but it is so irritating when it just happened last night and it interrupts my working...
2010-09-03T03:09:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	i feel you there too.  but still, i think ubuntu is worth the effort
2010-09-03T03:10:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	It has worked out well thus far but now it is getting too much since it interferes very much with my work things.
2010-09-03T03:11:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	well, if we get this fixed for you, you might want to consider not upgrading unless absolutely necessary.  i'm still searching for an answer for you
2010-09-03T03:12:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	Thanks, I kind of will not upgrade anything with kernel if this issue gets fixed.
2010-09-03T03:14:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	well, the issue *will* get fixed as long as you want to fix it.  you can always install ubuntu again from live cd..
2010-09-03T03:14:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	Sure I could install it but that will take way much time for me at the moment... Argh
2010-09-03T03:15:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	i am currently trying to install 10.04 in a vm so i can see if grub has a kernel selection option for you
2010-09-03T03:15:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	That sounds great, thanks
2010-09-03T03:17:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	can you log into a terminal?  when does the system startup fail?
2010-09-03T03:17:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	Can I return with these things later on in 12 hours or so? I am sleeping every 2 minutes on the couch.
2010-09-03T03:18:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	in 12 hours it will be 3am.  someone else will have to help you then, i should be asleep.
2010-09-03T03:18:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	Okay, later on then perhaps. Finnish times are a bit different LOL
2010-09-03T03:19:00.000Z	seidos	DrGrov	good luck
2010-09-03T03:19:00.000Z	DrGrov	seidos	Thanks
