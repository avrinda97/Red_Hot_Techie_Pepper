2008-11-23T06:05:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	free space generally means space that is part of a file system, but doesn't have any files on it.  Unallocated means it's not a part of an existing file system
2008-11-23T06:06:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	so i have an ntfs partition that has unallocated space to the right of it.  i'm looking to make the ntfs partition larger.  i don't seem to have the option to make it larger.  do i need to resize the unallocated space to have free space preceeding it?
2008-11-23T06:07:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	if you can increase the size of the ntfs partition, it should use up as much unallocated space as you tell it, you can't change the size of unallocated space unless you make a new partition out of it
2008-11-23T06:09:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	and now you want to increase the size of ntfs1?
2008-11-23T06:09:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	the problem is that i can't seem to resize ntfs1...the up arrow is grayed out.
2008-11-23T06:09:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	yes.
2008-11-23T06:10:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	huh, I wonder if ntfs3g can increase partitions
2008-11-23T06:10:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	honestly, I've never tried to go that direction from Linux before
2008-11-23T06:11:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	supposedly, it can.  according to the "show features" option, it can.
2008-11-23T06:11:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	is it a compressed or encrypted partition?
2008-11-23T06:11:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	nor have i, this is a first for me.  nope, just standard winxp
2008-11-23T06:11:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	have you tried resizing them from Windows?
2008-11-23T06:12:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	the one i'm trying to make larger is the boot partition...can that be done from inside a mounted partition?
2008-11-23T06:12:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	is that partition mounted?
2008-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	well...it will be if i try it from inside windows
2008-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	is it currently mounted?
2008-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	no
2008-11-23T06:13:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	positive.
2008-11-23T06:14:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	dang, that would have made it easy
2008-11-23T06:14:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	I don't know then, sorry, try google again
2008-11-23T06:14:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	it would have been a nice mistake.  i did notice that gparted is listing the "extended" partition as huge, though it has no start or end.  is that just because i'm running the livecd?
2008-11-23T06:15:00.000Z	mhall119	mroc	shouldn't be
2008-11-23T06:18:00.000Z	mroc	mhall119	well, no ext-anything on the disk yet, just the ntfs partitions and unallocated space.  so, no idea what that's all about then.
