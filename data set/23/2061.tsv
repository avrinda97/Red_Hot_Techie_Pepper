2010-01-07T05:15:00.000Z	karmst		ok then you should have no problems. It's a lot easier to write the config file then mess around with all the MS windows IIS stuff trying to make everything work
2010-01-07T05:15:00.000Z	karmst		You may also want to check out Joomla
2010-01-07T05:16:00.000Z	karmst		the ubuntu server has the ability to install LAMP during the OS install
2010-01-07T05:17:00.000Z	karmst		locate httpd.conf
2010-01-07T05:17:00.000Z	karmst		opps.
2010-01-07T05:17:00.000Z	karmst		wrong window
2010-01-07T05:18:00.000Z	karmst		A hardware raid will just look like an LVM
2010-01-07T05:18:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	which I also have no idea how it looks like
2010-01-07T05:19:00.000Z	karmst	syockit	it should only show up as a single drive
2010-01-07T05:39:00.000Z	karmst	syockit	that's the module he needs. It's because the nforce raid isn't a true hardware raid.
2010-01-07T06:06:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	actually I'm looking to solve that too

2010-01-07T06:09:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	yup still no time reading it, busy here :(
2010-01-07T06:11:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	it's source? i thought adobe gives out only binaries
2010-01-07T06:28:00.000Z	karmst	syockit	It's going to be over an hour to download this 3.6mb flashplayer alpha
2010-01-07T06:29:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	oh dear. what side of the planet are you on?
2010-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/326555 has link to debian's repo
2010-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	which has native 64-bit plugin
2010-01-07T06:41:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	yay clicky works on new plugin!
2010-01-07T08:03:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	ah I cannot enter my birthdate!
2010-01-07T07:57:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	i think you're better off putting it in ~/.mozilla/plugins . create the directory if it doesn't exist
2010-01-07T08:01:00.000Z	karmst	syockit	that 64bit alpha flash plugin didn't fix the missing elements issue
2010-01-07T08:02:00.000Z	syockit	karmst	missing elements? what page is this?
