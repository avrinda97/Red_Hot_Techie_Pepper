2010-02-16T22:34:00.000Z	dieter__		Hello, can someone please help me install my ati driver? I have a dell inspiron 1525.
2010-02-16T22:34:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	have you tried the hardware manager?
2010-02-16T22:58:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	use gksudo synaptic
2010-02-16T22:59:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	"sudo" is for command line only, "gksudo" is for graphical applications
2010-02-16T23:07:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	are you sure Hardware Manager doesn't have an ati driver for you?
2010-02-16T23:08:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	ok, what are you looking for in synaptic?
2010-02-16T23:09:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	how is that going to help you if you don't have an ati card ?
2010-02-16T23:10:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	ah, I see
2010-02-16T23:12:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	you don't need to remove any -- the system will automatically offer to remove then when they aren't in use
2010-02-16T23:13:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	it won't tell you to remove it yet
2010-02-16T23:18:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	the one you're looking for should be easy to find, because it will be the only one installed
2010-02-16T23:18:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	for future reference, a green square in synaptic means the package is installed. Right click to remove it
2010-02-16T23:20:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	just unintsall any that are green
2010-02-16T23:20:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	probably not. Effects don't usually work with integrated graphics, I think
2010-02-16T23:21:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	but don't quote me on that
2010-02-16T23:24:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	it's a debugging/helping tool
2010-02-16T23:24:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	close synaptic first
2010-02-17T00:16:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	did you check ubuntu software center?
2010-02-17T00:20:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	you'd probably to best to stick with easy to install options
2010-02-17T00:21:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	I agree with Sa[i]nT , try transmission
2010-02-17T00:22:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	there should be a readme inside it. bz2 is a compressed file, similar to .zip or .rar
2010-02-17T00:23:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	in Ubuntu, it's often best to not install the latest version of software
2010-02-17T00:23:00.000Z	semitones	dieter__	the ones in the software repositories are tested to be stable, whereas the ones from vuze.com may not work
