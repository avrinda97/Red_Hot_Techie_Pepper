2007-09-02T10:28:00.000Z	sahs		is this where i can get help for ubuntu?
2007-09-02T10:28:00.000Z	sahs		heh thanks Xoris
2007-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	sahs		I'm having trouble connecting to my repositories in synaptic and apt... any pointers?
2007-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	sahs		they were working until about a week ago
2007-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	did you play in your sources.list file ?
2007-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	no not the sources file
2007-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	what then ?
2007-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	but i did play with some other file (whose name i cannot remember) I was trying to make synaptic work under a proxy
2007-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	and it started working under a proxy... but now it won't work via direct connection
2007-09-02T10:31:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	I suggest you look for the tutorial you used to get synaptic to work under proxy and review the files you messed with
2007-09-02T10:34:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	i think it might have been etc/apt/apt.conf but now I can't even find it... :(
2007-09-02T10:36:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	i think it might have been etc/apt/apt.conf but now I can't even find it... :(
2007-09-02T10:37:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	I can't realy do much for you on this,  I was just giving you avenues of investigation
2007-09-02T10:40:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	try checking in the forum  www.ubuntuforums.org ,  and in here try asking specific questions
2007-09-02T10:44:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	My problem is quite specific. Synaptic/apt are having trouble connecting to the repos ... what else can i say?
2007-09-02T10:44:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	  I meant , don't just ask  for someone to hlp with synaptic when repeating your query in the channel
2007-09-02T10:45:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	oh ok.
2007-09-02T10:47:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	couldn't i use something to "reconfigure" my proxy settings?
2007-09-02T10:48:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	not taht I know of ,  the only proxy thing I know of in ubuntu is the app in  system > admin
2007-09-02T10:48:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	ok cheers
2007-09-02T10:55:00.000Z	sahs	Pelo	thanks also
2007-09-02T10:55:00.000Z	Pelo	sahs	 no problem
