2004-11-15T15:09:00.000Z	phill		hmmm i got it, but tv still doesn't work :(
2004-11-15T15:09:00.000Z	phill		tuner: type set to 0 (Temic PAL (4002 FH5)) by bt848 #0 [sw] 
2004-11-15T06:11:00.000Z	phill		Does anyone want to ssh in and setup my ati binary drivers? :(
2004-11-15T06:11:00.000Z	Mithrandir	phill	have you tried following the instructions on the Wiki?
2004-11-15T06:11:00.000Z	phill		yes
2004-11-15T06:12:00.000Z	phill		and no, but you can download what you like at my full bandwidth of 5kbps heh
2004-11-15T06:12:00.000Z	phill		i've done the wiki
2004-11-15T06:12:00.000Z	phill		3 times
2004-11-15T06:12:00.000Z	phill		reinstalled after two of them
2004-11-15T06:12:00.000Z	phill		now i'm sitting here with fglrx 'working' but no 3d accelerating
2004-11-15T06:13:00.000Z	phill		sure whatever, another reinstall won't bother me at this stage
2004-11-15T06:13:00.000Z	phill		i think something is screwing up between mesa libgl.so and ati's version
2004-11-15T06:13:00.000Z	phill		or something
2004-11-15T06:14:00.000Z	phill		i don't know
2004-11-15T06:14:00.000Z	phill		i think i'll try and swap my 9700 for a geforce 5700 or something
2004-11-15T06:14:00.000Z	Mithrandir	phill	create a user tfheen for me, put http://raw.no/dotfiles/ssh/authorized_keys in ~tfheen/.ssh/authorized_keys and I can take a look.
2004-11-15T06:14:00.000Z	phill		ok
2004-11-15T06:14:00.000Z	phill		asif!
2004-11-15T06:18:00.000Z	phill		ok Mithrandir ssh to phill.ath.cx with tfheen
2004-11-15T06:19:00.000Z	phill		ati has been promising better linux support for years
2004-11-15T06:28:00.000Z	phill		its working!
2004-11-15T06:28:00.000Z	Mithrandir	phill	and I didn't even touch anything. :)
2004-11-15T06:29:00.000Z	phill	Mithrandir	sometimes it helps just to go through things with someone else :)
