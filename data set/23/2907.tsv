2009-01-31T17:58:00.000Z	paul68		hi which vnc viewer/server do I need to install to have an identical one like the one on this website?http://www.realvnc.com/products/download.html tightvnc, vnc4server
2009-01-31T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 most of them work the same. I tend to use vnc4server
2009-01-31T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 also it depends on exactly what you want  to do with vnc.
2009-01-31T18:00:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	well I need to get that installed at my uncle who lives about 2 hours driving from my location and take over his computer to help him out
2009-01-31T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 gnome has a vncserver feature built in.. You can use any vnc client to connect.. BUT ovber the wild internet.. Youmay want to check out ssh tunneling of vnc.
2009-01-31T18:00:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	if I am correct I need to install the server part at his side and the client one on my side he works with vista
2009-01-31T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 i think the default ubuntu-gnome has one htat will share his 'current' desktop' he can enable.
2009-01-31T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 or install vnc4server. and ssh to allow you to ssh in and start it if needed
2009-01-31T18:01:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	but he needs to vnc server to be installed right
2009-01-31T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 i think gnome has one installed by default
2009-01-31T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 system -> preferances -> remote desktop
2009-01-31T18:03:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	that part I understood however my uncle works with vista and I need to connect to his pc. does he need to install vnc server or client?
2009-01-31T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 you can install vnc4server in addation to that one thats built in.
2009-01-31T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 theres some default vnc viewer also in ubuntu.. or install one of the others.. and try them out.
2009-01-31T18:04:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	ok so he installs ultravnc server and I can connect with the viewer
2009-01-31T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 assuming hte routers are not blocking stuff...
2009-01-31T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 theres also some 'gotomypc' sutes that help do thit task also.
2009-01-31T18:05:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	ok thanks
2009-01-31T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 i was thinkng windows vista/xp ? had some built in remote-desktop tool also.. instead of vnc.. but ive never tried those
2009-01-31T18:06:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	you are right its the mstc
2009-01-31T18:38:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	Does ultravnc also allow outside connections from outside the network?
2009-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	paul68	Dr_willis	can you also connect with ultravnc over the internet?
2009-01-31T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	paul68	 vnc over the internet - is best done with a ssh tunnle. vnc can be insecure.
