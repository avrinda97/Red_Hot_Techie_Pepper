2009-08-09T20:21:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	have you read this info? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo
2009-08-09T20:22:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	no havent thank you :)
2009-08-09T20:22:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	or have you looked at getdeb.net to see if there is a prebuilt deb of what you want?
2009-08-09T20:41:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	that getdeb site is super useful
2009-08-09T20:41:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	I'm not finding a deb for a twitter plugin, leaves compiling from source or adding the info to the sources.list file
2009-08-09T20:42:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	thats becoming clear *sigh* it seems like everytime i cant find a way to do what i'm tryingt o do there is some other better way that everyone else is doing that i ddint know about heheh, do you happen to use twitter at all?
2009-08-09T20:43:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	no, I find sites like twitter and myspace to be a waste of my time
2009-08-09T20:44:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	twitter is extremely spammy, myspace is loathsome but both represent exclusive means of communication with some of my less than tech savvy friends :)
2009-08-09T20:45:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	if someone can't use msn or call me, I don't need to talk to them :)
2009-08-09T20:45:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	i'm strongly considering taking that attitude to heart :P
2009-08-09T20:46:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	having a repo to update the program for you would be more stable as you may not know about updates that could fix issues .... I also avoid youtube and other "junk" like that
2009-08-09T20:47:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	noted, i'll go that route... Blaphemer! I'm a youtube addict :)
2009-08-09T20:48:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	I may go to hell for it but I won't be alone, all my friends will be there ;)
2009-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	good company is very important..
2009-08-09T21:29:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	erUSUL, etc thanks for the help guys :)
2009-09-28T20:51:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	system - admin - default apps?
2009-09-28T20:52:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	i see no "default apps"
2009-09-28T20:52:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	might be as VCoolio says, system - prefs - preferred apps
2009-09-28T20:54:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	fccf, ok that worked, but FYI i have two in the list, thunderbird and mozailla thunderbird, thuinderbird worked, might i suggest someone please update the bot, the thread it links to on this subject is 4 years old
2009-10-30T22:44:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	motion is good
2009-10-30T22:45:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	will it capture audoo and video at the same time?
2009-10-30T22:45:00.000Z	innomen	Halitech	and is it gui
2009-10-30T22:45:00.000Z	Halitech	innomen	not sure on audio, I think its just for video and no, runs from the cli
