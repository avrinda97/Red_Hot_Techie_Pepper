2007-07-29T06:40:00.000Z	mikebot		I'm trying to extract a tar.gz, and it says I do not have the right permissions... Whast is the command for extracting?
2007-07-29T06:40:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	tar -xvf <file>.tar.gz
2007-07-29T06:41:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	Where do I put where I want it to extract?
2007-07-29T06:41:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	but you need to be in a folder that your user can write to or else you would have to use sudo
2007-07-29T06:41:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	Or is it earier to just move it to that folder first?
2007-07-29T06:41:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	-C <place to extract>
2007-09-05T16:59:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	yes that's how it works when you switch sides of the cube that is your other workspace you get 4
2007-09-05T05:00:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	But it isn't spinning like a cube.
2007-09-05T05:00:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	you sure what does ctrl+alt+up arrow do for you
2007-09-05T05:01:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	it shows you the top of the cube :)
2007-09-05T05:01:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	it makes everything fade except my browser
2008-09-29T05:28:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	ctrl+a TAB
2008-09-29T05:29:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	Thanks... when I switch to the other I can;t seem to do anything...
2008-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	yeah you eon't until you create a new shell in it
2008-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	How do I do that?
2008-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	ctrl+a C
2008-09-29T05:31:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	if you d ctrl+a N it makes a "clone" of your one window just incase you hit N sometime :)
2008-09-29T05:32:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	yikes, somehow I got htop in both of them./
2008-09-29T05:32:00.000Z	kitche	mikebot	then you most likely pressed the wrong key
2008-09-29T05:33:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	Haha, I think you're right.
2008-09-29T05:34:00.000Z	mikebot	kitche	(I'm concurrently trying to learn to type on a dvorak board, on my qwerty hardware... makes it difficult.)
