2009-01-28T18:17:00.000Z	mmm4m5m		help/question: one of my hdd partitions is acting strange (http://pastebin.com/m4688a6ff). /dev/sda2 is missing in /dev/disk/by-uuid. It is new ext3 partition created with gparted
2009-01-28T18:18:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	try "sudo udevadm trigger" then "sudo udevadm settle"
2009-01-28T18:19:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	(or reboot)
2009-01-28T18:20:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	are you sure, it is ok to use it? after reboot all will be ok?
2009-01-28T18:21:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	udevadm - command not found
2009-01-28T18:22:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	yes, udev doesn't know when you create new partitions, so it doesn't create the by-uuid etc... if you want to be sure, do the udevadm trigger and settle, that simulat3es a reboot (as far as new partitions go)
2009-01-28T18:22:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	it will force udev to reread all the disks and recreate the by-uuid and other symlinks
2009-01-28T18:23:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	I think I will reboot. Looks like bug in gparted. I did not "delete,create,format" - it works, yesterday I did that way. Today, I just click on another ntfs partition and select "format as ext3"
2009-01-28T18:25:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	why not run udevadm trigger and udevadm settle?
2009-01-28T18:25:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	udevadm - command not found
2009-01-28T18:25:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	that's really the only reason to reboot
2009-01-28T18:25:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	what version of ubuntu?
2009-01-28T18:26:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	then try udevtrigger
2009-01-28T18:26:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	and udevsettle
2009-01-28T18:29:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	can you please tell me how to run udevtrigger with subsystem (--subsystem-match=subsystem)
2009-01-28T18:36:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	I don't have access to a gutsy box, and udev has changed a lot since then, is there a udevrestart command?
2009-01-28T18:42:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	it ok now. Thank you! But I did not found can I run with specific subsystem. No, there is not udevrestart command.
2009-01-28T18:42:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	glad to hear it, you are welcome, how did you fix it?
2009-01-28T18:44:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	as you told me. But I am kind of afraid to run any commands. That is why checked man pages, then try to find can I do it with subsystem. Finally I run the commands you told. How I did broke anything else (...like to reset open handles to devices) :)
2009-01-28T18:45:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	sorry, I mean: "hope I did not broke anything"
2009-01-28T18:46:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	that command won't break anything, it just forces the system to re-read all the hardware and trigger any events. It leaves everything on the system alone.
2009-01-28T18:46:00.000Z	lostboy1	mmm4m5m	again, glad you got it working (without a reboot!) :-)
2009-01-28T18:46:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	lostboy1	 nice, thank you again. I learn something new :)
