2008-09-09T08:42:00.000Z	brmj		Everyone, I could use some help when you get a chance. I was resizing a linux partition to fill space from deleting a windows partition when there was a power interruption. Now the partition is messed up.

2008-09-09T08:43:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	how is the partition messed up?
2008-09-09T08:44:00.000Z	brmj		Well, gparted shows a smaller partition of unknown type in the space I wanted / to occupy.
2008-09-09T08:44:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	is anything on that partition?
2008-09-09T08:45:00.000Z	brmj		I don't know. unknown type of partition.
2008-09-09T08:45:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	I meant, if we completely eliminate that partition and start fresh, will you lose anything?
2008-09-09T08:46:00.000Z	brmj		﻿Aeron|mtf: that's a package, not a repository
2008-09-09T08:46:00.000Z	brmj		﻿angusthefuzz: yeah, that was the / partition
2008-09-09T08:47:00.000Z	brmj		﻿angusthefuzz: no recent backups either, if I remember correctly
2008-09-09T08:48:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	the only method i know of to recover anything requires a free partition that is larger than the one you are trying to recover
2008-09-09T08:48:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	do you have any other empty drives in the machine?
2008-09-09T08:48:00.000Z	brmj		﻿angusthefuzz: I have a 250gb external hd. That might work.
2008-09-09T08:48:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	what is the filesystem that was on the drive?
2008-09-09T08:49:00.000Z	brmj		﻿angusthefuzz: ext3
2008-09-09T08:49:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	well at least its not reiser
2008-09-09T08:50:00.000Z	brmj		﻿Aeron|mtf: google it. it is a package.
2008-09-09T08:50:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	I used this tutorial before in a similar situation, it worked as advertised
2008-09-09T08:50:00.000Z	brmj		﻿angusthefuzz: Ok, what do I do?

2008-09-09T08:50:00.000Z	brmj	angusthefuzz	thanks!
2008-09-09T08:51:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	theoretically you just messed up your partition table, at least i hope
2008-09-09T08:51:00.000Z	angusthefuzz	brmj	I will cross my fingers for you
