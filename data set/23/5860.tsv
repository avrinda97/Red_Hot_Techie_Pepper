2006-08-19T07:00:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: First things first. How did you install Ubuntu? Using the LiveCD or the alternate install CD?
2006-08-19T07:00:00.000Z	ChaosAFS	BlueEagle	i believe i downloaded the live CD and burned it to a CD
2006-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	ChaosAFS		pretty sure
2006-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	stopher	I really do not know or think so.
2006-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	ChaosAFS		the iso is named something like this
2006-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	ChaosAFS		ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386
2006-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	stopher	Have you got the name of the motherboard?
2006-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: and you're not able to get it to show you a graphical interface?
2006-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: Which graphics card/chipset have you got?
2006-08-19T07:02:00.000Z	ChaosAFS	BlueEagle	radeon 9250 PCI card
2006-08-19T07:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	stopher	:)
2006-08-19T07:04:00.000Z	ChaosAFS		so whats with the DOS?
2006-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	ChaosAFS		i typed startx and all i got was "no screens found"
2006-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: There seems to be an issue with that graphics card. Have you tried choosing VGA safe mode in the boot menu?
2006-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: I think it should be the F4 key to choose it.
2006-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: Hopefully that will give you the x screen.
2006-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: However that screen will be very low resolution (800x600 or something) and some windows in the installer are too big for that.
2006-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: to move them around simply hold your ALT key and click and drag the window to move it.
2006-08-19T07:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: When you've got ubuntu installed you will be able to install the fglrx drivers for your card and you should be able to use normal resolutions.
2006-08-19T07:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: also if you've got an integrated graphics card in your motherboard it might (but really should not) help to turn it off in the BIOS.
2006-08-19T07:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: any questions?
2006-08-19T07:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle		chaosafs: and what you've got is not DOS but a TTY terminal server.
2006-08-19T07:09:00.000Z	ChaosAFS	BlueEagle	so... what do i type in the black screen :P
