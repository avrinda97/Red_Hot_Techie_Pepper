2012-08-22T18:53:00.000Z	vaio		having some problems with laptop lid actions, vaio sz/ubuntu 12.04... any ideas, anyone?
2012-08-22T18:54:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	how much swap space do you have, and how much physical memory?
2012-08-22T18:54:00.000Z	vaio	mneptok	2GB
2012-08-22T18:55:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	2GB for both?
2012-08-22T18:57:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	suspending a machine will almost certainly require >1.1*RAM. you have to flush RAM when suspending. also, suspend and hibernate support varies widely depending on how an OEM implemented it.
2012-08-22T18:58:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	IOW, 2GB swap for 2GB RAM may not be enough. and it may not work at all.
2012-08-22T18:58:00.000Z	vaio	mneptok	my RAM is 2GB... while flushing the RAM rings no bells to me...
2012-08-22T19:00:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	it's the same on all OSes. when you suspend, power to the physical RAM is cut. the contents have to go somewhere or they get lost. it gets paged out to disk.
2012-08-22T19:01:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	do you *need* suspend? is hibernate enough?
2012-08-22T19:03:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	again ... suspend requires a minimum swap of >1.1*RAM.
2012-08-22T19:04:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	one-point-one multiplied by the amount of physical RAM
2012-08-22T19:05:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	yes. and even then it may not work at all, depending on Sony's implementation.
2012-08-22T19:06:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	it may require fiddling with pm-utils. it may only hibernate and not suspend.
2012-08-22T19:06:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	it worked in Linux with no swap?
2012-08-22T19:08:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	i have never heard of a true Linux install (not zombified Wubi stuff) not needing swap to suspend.
2012-08-22T19:09:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	might.
2012-08-27T19:36:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	weren't you asking about this last week?
2012-08-27T19:37:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	are you now a pm-utils expert?
2012-08-27T19:38:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	as suggested last week, you need to install the pm-utils package and begin to learn its machinations.
2012-08-27T19:39:00.000Z	vaio	mneptok	don't want to sound grumpy, but if i started to learn everything from scratch... i would build my own OS, and not blast my brain about bugs in ubuntu
2012-08-27T19:40:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	well, there it is. there's no infomred answer anyone in this channel without the exact same make and model laptop can give you. it would be all guessing.
2012-08-27T19:40:00.000Z	vaio	mneptok	they are installed already
2012-08-27T19:42:00.000Z	mneptok	vaio	there is no published standard for this stuff. OEMs implement it differently, and just enough so Windows can be made to work. without your exact laptop in front of me, it's all guesswork.
