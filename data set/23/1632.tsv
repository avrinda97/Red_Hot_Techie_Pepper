2009-12-25T04:50:00.000Z	LiteralKa		xorg isn't detecting my mouse or keyboard after `startx' but it does if it doesn't do that
2009-12-25T04:50:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	Then don't do that?  Problem solved
2009-12-25T04:51:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	Be more specific about your entire problem :)
2009-12-25T04:52:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	It shows gdm too early??
2009-12-25T04:54:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	Because the mouse and keyboard don't work.  I suggest purging and re-installing HAL.
2009-12-25T04:55:00.000Z	LiteralKa	edbian	using apt-get purge?
2009-12-25T04:56:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	Additionally.  Sometimes when I start Ubuntu it doesn't recognize my mouse or keyboard.  If I wait a few minutes (like 60 second) and it comes back
2009-12-25T04:56:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	yeah, then apt-get install it
2009-12-25T04:56:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	DO NOT RESTART while it is purged
2009-12-25T04:57:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	I'm not sure if it will work.  The issue is that Ubuntu isn't detecting your hardware correctly which is the biggest problem
2009-12-25T04:59:00.000Z	LiteralKa	edbian	and then reinstal xserver-xorg-core?
2009-12-25T04:59:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	I'm not sure about dependencies.  I think that HAL is all alone though.  Am I wrong?
2009-12-25T04:59:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	I feel squimish about it then..
2009-12-25T05:00:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	ha ha ok no big deal
2009-12-25T05:00:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	After you get everything installed again reboot and see if it makes a difference.
2009-12-25T05:01:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	No Problem.  Hardware detection is the  biggest problem for linux imho
2009-12-25T05:02:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	I bet you're getter pretty good at it! :P
2009-12-25T05:03:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	Unfortunately I think the best advice I can give is to simply use the last version of Ubuntu
2009-12-25T05:04:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	I use debian because I was annoyed by Ubuntu updates messing things up.  Although I do occasionally miss life on the edge
2009-12-25T05:12:00.000Z	LiteralKa	edbian	Error
2009-12-25T05:13:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	Mmm, that's a crazy error.  Can you find the config file it's whining about?
2009-12-25T05:14:00.000Z	edbian	LiteralKa	His mouse and keyboard did not work after switching to ubuntu 9.10 so I suggested hi purge and re-install HAL
