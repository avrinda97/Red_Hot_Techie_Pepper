2004-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	geppy		Are there any debian-based distros that aren't relatively out of date?
2004-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	geppy		I mean, even Red Hat has 2.8 out.
2004-11-04T08:58:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geppy	how much more up to date can you get than this ?
2004-11-04T08:58:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geppy	the Ubuntu pre-release had Gnome 2.8 the day IT was released
2004-11-04T09:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geppy	yes legal reasons
2004-11-04T09:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geppy	they are available if you want them
2004-11-04T09:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geppy	their codecs are patent encumbered tho
2004-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	geppy	no because they are not GPL compatible
