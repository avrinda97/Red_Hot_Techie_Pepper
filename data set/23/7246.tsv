2005-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	n00blar	Cicakman	I think it boils down to an issue with Xorg or a conf file in xorg...I can see the module loaded on my box
2005-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	Cicakman	n00blar	how to see if the module is loaded? lsmod?
2005-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	n00blar	Cicakman	or try dmesg|grep fglrx
2005-09-22T10:11:00.000Z	Cicakman	n00blar	oops.. forgot to download the kernel module for it
2005-09-22T10:12:00.000Z	n00blar	Cicakman	make sure you get the headers for your kernel
