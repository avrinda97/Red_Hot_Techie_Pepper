2010-09-02T00:15:00.000Z	pfifo		if / is my c:\ drive then what is my A:\ drive?
2010-09-02T00:15:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	/ isn't your c: drive
2010-09-02T00:16:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	forget about windows, / is the roof of your filesystem and partitions get mounted to directories...
2010-09-02T00:17:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	s/roof/root
2010-09-02T00:18:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	huh?
2010-09-02T00:19:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	s/foo/bar means: I made a typo, replace "foo" with "bar" in what I just said
2010-09-02T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	gnome-control-center?  Why do you want to?
2010-09-13T22:54:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	why?
2010-09-13T22:56:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	umm, isn't that happening *inside* the chroot?
2010-09-13T22:59:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	this stuff is supposed to be happening in your chroot...
2010-09-13T23:00:00.000Z	pfifo	jrib	thats right, but what do you do after your done with a chroot? thats right you reboot into it and then you dont have this critical file on your system
2010-09-13T23:00:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	well obviously, no?  Update the wiki with some more explanation I guess
2010-09-13T23:02:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	it seems to happen later further down on the page.  Probably someone added some info and didn't organize the page very well
2010-09-16T00:10:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	isn't there some issue if he's using the disc?
2010-09-16T00:11:00.000Z	pfifo	jrib	yes, youll need todo that from a livecd, restoring with both methods will require a livecd as well (>implying the system works in the first place when you need to restore)
2010-09-16T00:11:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	partimage is a better choice then imho
2010-09-16T00:12:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	partimage is similar but it will be smarter about unused space
2010-09-16T00:13:00.000Z	pfifo	jrib	my boot partition are always 4gb so gzip is plenty for my needs. if I ever make a 16gb partition ill look into it
2011-07-11T02:46:00.000Z	pfifo	jrib	dont you download it from the keyserver? (sorry i might not know what your after)
2011-07-11T02:47:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	never mind, asked in wrong channel :)
2011-12-16T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	yes
2011-12-16T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	pfifo	erm never mind...
2012-10-10T03:30:00.000Z	pfifo	jrib	hes backing it up
