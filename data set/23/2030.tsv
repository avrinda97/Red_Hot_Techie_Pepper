2009-07-28T20:28:00.000Z	ububegin_		Do you guys get a lag when u run youtube videos on firefox on fullscreen.. is it got something do with flash...
2009-07-28T20:30:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	you can use mplayer
2009-07-28T20:31:00.000Z	ububegin_	janisoza1r	you mean download and later play them with mplayer
2009-07-28T20:32:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	you can also stream
2009-07-28T20:32:00.000Z	ububegin_	janisoza1r	No, I mean is there a fix available for the browsers
2009-07-28T20:32:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	it's not a fix for the browsers
2009-07-28T20:32:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	it's flash that sucks
2009-07-28T20:33:00.000Z	ububegin_	janisoza1r	so its not possible to view the youtube videos on firefox or any other browser... whats the pple at Canonical doing anythig to solve this
2009-07-28T20:34:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	canonical are not developers of flash
2009-07-28T20:38:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	you can
2009-07-28T20:40:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	so can i
2009-07-28T20:43:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	actually i disagree with you
2009-07-28T20:44:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	and yet again it is *not* ubuntu fault, it's adobe
2009-07-28T20:45:00.000Z	ububegin_	janisoza1r	Is it only in Ubuntu or across other Linux distributions as well
2009-07-28T20:45:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	no idea, i use only ubuntu for gui, others are headless
2009-07-28T20:48:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	go and nag them, you have my support.
2009-07-28T20:49:00.000Z	ububegin_	janisoza1r	edbian : how bout using the older versions of Flash.. Shldnt that solve the issue... I am on Jaunty
2009-07-28T20:49:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	well, that'd be crazy IMO. i could only make things worse i think
2009-07-28T20:50:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	since the reason to release new version is to _fix_ bugs, to introduce new ones
2009-07-28T20:50:00.000Z	ububegin_	janisoza1r	i never encountered the problem in my Ubuntu fiesty... I just upgraded to jaunty and all this happened
2009-07-28T20:51:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	if you want solutions, then post your problem and someone might try to help you, if you keep whining, then go to #foobar&grill
2009-07-28T20:52:00.000Z	janisoza1r	ububegin_	or whatever other offtopic channel
2009-07-28T20:52:00.000Z	ububegin_	janisoza1r	didnt i already post my problem...
