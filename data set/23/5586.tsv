2007-04-22T06:49:00.000Z	debaser		NobleComm: I don't know what could be the problem, there should be a message there
2007-04-22T06:49:00.000Z	debaser		NobleComm: it should be preceded by a WW
2007-04-22T06:51:00.000Z	debaser		NobleComm: or you're using another configuration file, or another log file, or you didn't check with enough precission, that's all I can tell you, but could be perfectly something else.
2007-04-22T06:51:00.000Z	debaser		I don't know how you can do it, but I've had that problem and checking in monitorworld and setting up things correctly was the solution
2007-04-22T06:52:00.000Z	debaser		but I guess that's not your problem
2007-04-22T06:52:00.000Z	debaser		than I can't help you more, I just recommend you check very carefully the settings
2007-04-22T06:53:00.000Z	debaser		ifconfig
2007-04-22T06:53:00.000Z	debaser		VividHaZe: ifconfig
2007-04-22T06:53:00.000Z	debaser		you are welcome
2007-04-22T06:53:00.000Z	debaser		well, is there a way to do it at all?
2007-04-22T06:54:00.000Z	VividHazE	debaser	When I'm entering my IP address so I can share files do you use the inet address or the Broadcast address?
2007-04-22T06:54:00.000Z	debaser		VividHaZe: you want to access a computer?
2007-04-22T06:54:00.000Z	debaser		if that's the case you use IP
2007-04-22T06:55:00.000Z	debaser		broadcast is for sending packages to every machine in the network
2007-04-22T06:55:00.000Z	VividHazE	debaser	No I'm setting up NFS and I need to enter the location of the file...wait...gah i'm stupid brb
2007-04-22T06:55:00.000Z	debaser		well in that case you use IP
2007-04-22T06:55:00.000Z	debaser		or hostname if you have a correct /etc/hosts
2007-04-22T06:57:00.000Z	debaser	Yahooadam	explain more precisely please, the computer is booted from network or the iso is in a network?
2007-04-22T06:58:00.000Z	debaser	Yahooadam	then you must first mount the partition holding the iso file
2007-04-22T06:59:00.000Z	debaser	Yahooadam	ssh, telnet or rsh work but I think its not the correct solution, you should use smbmount (samba) or NFS
2007-04-22T06:59:00.000Z	debaser	Yahooadam	you must mount it
2007-04-22T06:59:00.000Z	debaser	Yahooadam	see the documentation of smbmount
2007-04-22T06:59:00.000Z	VividHazE	debaser	Impaque: OMG! It isn't working yet but its saying more than "can't recognise what your on about" message, its saying Permission denied. So...what do I do now? If you have a spare minute :S
