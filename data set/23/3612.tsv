2008-12-14T09:29:00.000Z	benben		Hello everyone. I tried to backup my file system using tar. But so far I can't redirect the output of tar command to a file. How should I do it
2008-12-14T09:30:00.000Z	dft	benben	tar -zcvf backup.tgz <path to dir>
2008-12-14T09:31:00.000Z	benben	dft	yes, but I want to direct the output and error output to a file, so I did   tar -cvpPWf backup.tar  /  > log
2008-12-14T09:31:00.000Z	benben	dft	but it keeps telling me   tar: >: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
2008-12-14T09:31:00.000Z	dft	benben	tar -cvpPWf backup.tar  /  > log 2>&1
2008-12-14T09:34:00.000Z	benben	dft	this is the output following your advice tar: >/logfile: Cannot stat: No such file or directorytar: 2>&1: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
2008-12-14T09:35:00.000Z	dft	benben	okay hold on
2008-12-14T09:37:00.000Z	dft	benben	what is your pwd
2008-12-14T09:37:00.000Z	benben	dft	pwd is root, /
2008-12-14T09:38:00.000Z	dft	benben	 you cannot save your backup to the directory your backing up
2008-12-14T09:39:00.000Z	benben	dft	but I told tar to --exclude=logfile etc
2008-12-14T09:39:00.000Z	dft	benben	doesn't matter, you're trying to save backup.tar to the directory you're trying to backup
2008-12-14T09:40:00.000Z	benben	dft	I changed the command to tar my home directory and redirect to logfile in root, so logfile is not in the same directory as the one im backing up...it still gives me the same error
2008-12-14T09:40:00.000Z	dft	benben	are you trying to run this command as root user or standard user?
2008-12-14T09:41:00.000Z	benben	dft	as root
2008-12-14T09:41:00.000Z	benben	dft	it looks like the redirection portion in the command line isn't being interpreted by bash, and so tar receives it and get very confused
2008-12-14T09:42:00.000Z	dft	benben	dft@gringox:~$ tar -cvpPWf backup.tar  Documents/  > log 2>&1\
2008-12-14T09:52:00.000Z	benben	dft	this is strange
2008-12-14T09:52:00.000Z	benben	dft	if I just copy and paste the line in bash prompt, it ran perfectly
2008-12-14T09:53:00.000Z	benben	dft	but when I place it in a script file and run that, it gives me the error I described earlier
2008-12-14T09:56:00.000Z	benben	dft	solved! Turned out that I can't put redirection in a string and then execute that string
2008-12-14T09:58:00.000Z	dft	benben	was this inside  a shell script?
