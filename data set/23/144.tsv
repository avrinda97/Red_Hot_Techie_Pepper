2012-05-27T08:39:00.000Z	reisio	xisor_	until its bugs make them stop using Linux altogether
2012-05-27T08:44:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	another option for daniele may be usb stick install, a 16 gig usb stick is only a few bucks, and then no harm at all can come to his pc
2012-05-27T08:47:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	only problem daniel is going to face is needing help doing the partitioning and grub setup manually, default will nuke both her windows and her recovery partitions
2012-05-27T08:47:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	if someone can help him do that, its no problem at all to dualboot
2012-05-27T08:47:00.000Z	reisio	xisor_	I doubt it'll nuke the recovery partition
2012-05-27T08:47:00.000Z	reisio	xisor_	the MBR possibly, but that's of no concern
2012-05-27T08:48:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	it installs grub to the recovery partition by default, so ubuntu wont load, and the recovery wont either
2012-05-27T08:48:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	so someone needs to help them put grub somewhere where it WILL load, such as the windows partition
2012-05-27T08:48:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	that is literally the only issue
2012-05-27T08:48:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	XD
2012-05-27T08:49:00.000Z	reisio	xisor_	no it should install to the space at the beginning reserved for the MBR
2012-05-27T08:49:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	should be a ~100mb partition labeled windows 7 loader
2012-05-27T08:49:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	well, the defualt left my windows working and my recovery nuked earlier
2012-05-27T08:49:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	so it cant go in its default
2012-05-27T08:49:00.000Z	reisio	xisor_	nuked?
2012-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	sorry, inaccesible, unable to load recovery, and ubuntu not loading either
2012-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	the default location for grub was somewhere where it doesnt attempt to boot from
2012-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	which is the recovery partition
2012-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	reisio	xisor_	probably just confused, not destroyed entirely, but who knows
2012-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	it needs to be elsewhere, and that has to be done in the advanced options where you do partitioning
2012-05-27T08:51:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	/dev/sda2 was where my windows bootloader was, and that is where grub should go
2012-05-27T08:51:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	devault is /dev/sda1, which is recovery
2012-05-27T08:51:00.000Z	xisor_	reisio	in my case that is
