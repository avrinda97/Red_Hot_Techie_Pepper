2012-02-04T03:58:00.000Z	tiox		Whenever I access the Gnome print settings manager, I get a segfault.
2012-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	tiox		I really don't want to reinstall 11.10, so is there a quick and easy fix for this? I already deleted my .cups file in ~.
2012-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	tiox		.cups folder*
2012-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	tiox		Not the folder from /etc, easily confuseable and would be cause for alarm...
2012-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	at what point does the print manager segfault?
2012-02-04T04:03:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	at what point does the print settings manager segfault?
2012-02-04T04:05:00.000Z	tiox	mellifera	On load.
2012-02-04T04:05:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	have you ever checked your memory?
2012-02-04T04:07:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	wouldn't hurt
2012-02-04T04:08:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	if trying to install an HP eprinter started this, there might be something horriblly wrong in the configuration file
2012-02-04T04:09:00.000Z	tiox	mellifera	I can delete that and have it respawn fresh right?
2012-02-04T04:09:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	maybe it will regerate. but to be safe, just rename the file
2012-02-04T04:11:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	I'm looking. the file name might take a while
2012-02-04T04:17:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	if you're using gnome, you should find the print settings in gnome-print-manager.schemas
2012-02-04T04:23:00.000Z	tiox	mellifera	Is it a setting I can modify in either gconf or dconf?
2012-02-04T04:24:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	probably in gconf. but it's also (supposed to be) a file you can edit
2012-02-04T06:04:00.000Z	tiox	mellifera	It doesn't seem to0 be a memory issue as I gave it a full battery of RAM testing.
2012-02-04T06:05:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	the config must have gotten horrbly misconfigured when you tried to install that printer
2012-02-04T06:07:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	are you still completely unable to launch the gnome printer settings?
2012-02-04T06:08:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	if you can start the config from hp-setup, it's probably worth the try
2012-02-04T06:11:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	you could always rebuild your custom x session settings from a blank slate, I guess
2012-02-04T06:16:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	so, problem solved itself?
2012-02-04T06:17:00.000Z	mellifera	tiox	that's not good, might indicate a subtle memory problem
