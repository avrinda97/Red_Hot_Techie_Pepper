2012-08-02T04:12:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	you can disable the gnome screensaver with gnome-screensaver-command -d
2012-08-02T04:12:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	I've uninstalled it... but thanks
2012-08-02T04:37:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	or set text option in grub2
2012-08-02T04:39:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	lenny__, DeltaHeavyz: I read your response but that's just too fast for me to respond to all of you.
2012-08-02T04:41:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	This is only a temporary measure. You would normally disable the dm so it does not run as a daemon.
2012-08-02T04:42:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	if set "text" option in /etc/default/grub it's a static measure
2012-08-02T04:42:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	and you have a text login
2012-08-02T04:44:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	:-) many ways may be but to disable the dm is the right one. GRUB serves to local machine while the dm can serve others as well.
2012-08-02T04:48:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	so the right question, then is, if don't need GUI why did you install it? :)
2012-08-02T04:49:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	and gdm it's only a login manager
2012-08-02T04:50:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	lenny__ : The question was how to kill a dm.
2012-08-02T04:50:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	well :)
2012-08-02T04:52:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	lenny__ : Seemingly he/she did not want a dm on startup/
2012-08-02T04:53:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	so disable it, like you said, I only said another way to do it
2012-08-02T05:00:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	It is unwise to have dm enabled for init and then disable dm in GRUB, a tool that's outside the OS.
2012-08-02T05:02:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	dm isn't enabled if you've disabled it from boot...pay attention "text" mode says to boot without any gui enabled
2012-08-02T05:02:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	grup options says directive to the kernel
2012-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	so in that case grub says "hey kernel boot in a text mode without any gui enabled"
2012-08-02T05:06:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	It still is bad advice for all the reasons I gave you plus many more. If you are still in doubt I suggest you read the manual.
2012-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	reason that you said early aren't good reasons IMHO ...which manual you're referring too?
2012-08-12T03:02:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	hey great I didn't knew that Xorg command :D
2012-08-12T03:04:00.000Z	W4sp	exutux	Your suggestion woul dhave worked to but it would also kill the xsession. That means no IRC anymore.
2012-08-12T03:05:00.000Z	exutux	W4sp	yeah right
