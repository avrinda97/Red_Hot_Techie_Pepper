2006-04-09T13:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	I'm not sure what you're asking about...
2006-04-09T13:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	you don't, usually
2006-04-09T13:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	and please stop using the ENTER key so much - thanks
2006-04-09T13:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	what exactly are you trying to do?
2006-04-09T13:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	you can launch Nautilus with gksudo, but that's not recomended
2006-04-09T13:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	have you read this: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2006-04-09T13:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	please do - Ubuntu only uses sudo, not a root user
2006-04-09T13:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	try "sudo -i" instead - or just use sudo in front of your commands, the regular way
2006-04-09T13:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	the bot should have sent you a message...
2006-04-09T13:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	you should have gotten a pm from ubotu...
2006-04-09T13:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	using the pastebin keeps you from flooding the channel like you just did
2006-04-09T13:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	and Sun Java isn't available thru apt-get - see the webpage I already told you about please
2006-04-09T13:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	vista_	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats <-- Java is more complex than just an apt-get
