2007-05-13T08:17:00.000Z	stefg	jlaw	see dpkg --force-help to force deinstallation of the dmraid-package
2007-05-13T08:18:00.000Z	jlaw	stefg	i already did dpkg --force-all -r dmraid gives the same error
2007-05-13T08:20:00.000Z	stefg	jlaw	what's the error you got while installing dmraid? might it help to download the package manually, install it with dpkg -i and remove it then?
2007-05-13T08:21:00.000Z	jlaw	stefg	almost same error when installing
2007-05-13T08:22:00.000Z	stefg	jlaw	so what error? complaints it cant start dmraid?

2007-05-13T08:29:00.000Z	stefg	jlaw	so try what error  sudo /etc/init.d/dmraid start  throws
2007-05-13T08:30:00.000Z	jlaw	stefg	no error; but ls -l /dev/mapper gives me 0
2007-05-13T08:31:00.000Z	jlaw	stefg	the weird is that it works in the system booted from cd. everything is partitioned etc. but i can not apt-get install dmraid in the chrooted system
