2004-12-08T17:09:00.000Z	Quest-Master		I mean
2004-12-08T17:09:00.000Z	Quest-Master		2.2?
2004-12-08T17:10:00.000Z	Quest-Master		It should be 2.3.4
2004-12-08T17:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master		...
2004-12-08T17:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master		I mounted my Windows drive
2004-12-08T17:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master		And it shows everything
2004-12-08T17:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master		Folders and files
2004-12-08T17:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master		As individual files
2004-12-08T17:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master		Actually
2004-12-08T17:12:00.000Z	Quest-Master		As folders with nothing in them.
2004-12-08T17:12:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	I think it's a permission problem
2004-12-08T17:12:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	Try to mount it giving access to your user.
2004-12-08T17:13:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	Use a uid='your uid' otion
2004-12-08T17:13:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	For example, if you are uid=1000
2004-12-08T17:21:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	What you can do is put the option 'users' in that fstab entry
2004-12-08T17:21:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	That way , you don't need to be root to mount it.
2004-12-08T17:22:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	No error?
2004-12-08T17:27:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	Fine.
2004-12-08T17:27:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	Do you want that partition to be automounted on the system startup?
2004-12-08T17:28:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	In that way, you won't be able to access the partition as non privileged user.
2004-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	Because it will be automounted at startup, as root user.
2004-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	You should use a uid=<your uid> as another option.
2004-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	sirfred	Quest-Master	Or you could use 'noauto', but that way it won't be automounted at startup.
