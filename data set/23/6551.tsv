2006-04-04T07:32:00.000Z	rishi		what's up ubuntites
2006-04-04T07:33:00.000Z	rishi		i think i have installed ubuntu in some form about 10 times in the last week.
2006-04-04T07:33:00.000Z	rishi		hey you guys think i should install ATI's driver or fglrx
2006-04-04T07:35:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	a good rule of thumb is to use the distro's packages wherever possible. If you don't *need* the latest driver from ati for your card, stick with fglrx
2006-04-04T08:05:00.000Z	rishi	nickrud	you are an ubuntite, just a fellow newbie like me maybe
2006-04-04T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	I never even signed the coc, that's a first step I think
2006-04-04T08:07:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	Code of Conduct
2006-04-04T08:08:00.000Z	rishi	nickrud	apparently i haven't either then, haha.
2006-04-04T08:09:00.000Z	rishi	nickrud	what's the difference between aptitude and apt-get, any idea?
2006-04-04T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	aptitude tracks the packages that were installed as dependencies of things that you explicitly installed; if a dependency is no longer needed (you removed the program you installed) aptitude will also uninstall the dependencies.
2006-04-04T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	it also has really nice sorting & searching functions built in
2006-04-04T08:10:00.000Z	rishi	nickrud	but doesn't apt-get do that?
2006-04-04T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	not the removal of unused dependencies, no
2006-04-04T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	and I absolutely love the interactive ncurses interface :)
2006-04-04T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	but if you did install kubuntu-desktop with aptitude, then removed it, all of the stuff that was pulled in would be uninstalled.
2006-04-04T08:12:00.000Z	rishi	nickrud	obviously you are a lil more apt at this than i am, i don't know what ncurses is either :(
2006-04-04T08:12:00.000Z	rishi	nickrud	oh for real?  that's awesome...i shall use that instead of apt-get now
2006-04-04T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	a text based screen writing & keyboard/mouse input library
2006-04-04T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	that was a lousy pun ;(
2006-04-04T08:13:00.000Z	rishi	nickrud	what do you need that for?
2006-04-04T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	type aptitude on a command line, you're looking at ncurses
2006-04-06T12:37:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	I do promote it, yes :)
2006-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	rishi	just run sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
