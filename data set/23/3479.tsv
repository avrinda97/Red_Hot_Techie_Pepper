2008-04-08T02:39:00.000Z	Vetsin		is it me, or does ubuntu make my laptop fans spin up way more than normal....
2008-04-08T02:40:00.000Z	Vetsin		more than any other OS or Distro...
2008-04-08T02:40:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	might be some kind of acpi problem.. or nvidia driver problem
2008-04-08T02:40:00.000Z	Vetsin	Slart	should i disable acpi?
2008-04-08T02:40:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	one of the nvidia driver version had a bug that made the fans spin at 100% all the time.. can't remember which one it was
2008-04-08T02:41:00.000Z	Vetsin		Its not 100% all the time...
2008-04-08T02:41:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	you could try.. I don't think it will improve things a lot though
2008-04-08T02:41:00.000Z	Vetsin		But if i do too much, or very little, it spins up to 100% and is bothersome in class
2008-04-08T02:41:00.000Z	Vetsin		Is there a way to modify fan speeds? Or when fans turn on
2008-04-08T02:42:00.000Z	Vetsin		I'm at like 30% CPU and it randomly spins up to 100%
2008-04-08T02:43:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	depends on the motherboard... some allow you to control the fans.. some don't
2008-04-08T02:43:00.000Z	Vetsin		I just ask because this seems to be ubuntu specific
2008-04-08T02:43:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	if I were you I'd wait until hardy... it might be fixed then
2008-04-08T02:43:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	if you can stand the noise for a couple of weeks
2008-04-08T02:43:00.000Z	Vetsin		oh well, i wwait then
2008-04-08T02:44:00.000Z	Vetsin		its not if i can stand the noise, if its the people around me can
2008-04-08T02:44:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	you can try a live cd of hardy now.. and see if that works better
2008-04-08T02:44:00.000Z	Vetsin		maybe, hows the beta run
2008-04-08T02:44:00.000Z	Vetsin		any problems that may turn me off?
2008-04-08T02:45:00.000Z	Vetsin		but the very fact that id be running off a cs may eliminate the sound point
2008-04-08T02:45:00.000Z	Vetsin		since the cd is loud
2008-04-08T02:45:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	I don't really know.. but trying a live cd is cheap... both in terms of money and time
2008-04-08T02:46:00.000Z	Slart	Vetsin	I just meant to try hardy and see if the fans stop messing around... not for every day use.. as you said.. the cd drive makes quite a lot of noise too
