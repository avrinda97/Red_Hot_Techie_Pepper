2008-02-19T02:52:00.000Z	olivier		the mixer isn't muted
2008-02-19T02:53:00.000Z	neverblue	olivier	then its your device that you are using to listen with, confirm its plugged in, the volume is turned up, etc...
2008-02-19T02:53:00.000Z	olivier	neverblue	i think so ...
2008-02-19T02:54:00.000Z	neverblue	olivier	its not for you to 'think' about it, its for you to get down and check :D
2008-02-19T02:55:00.000Z	olivier	neverblue	yes its plugged (it's a laptop)
2008-02-19T02:55:00.000Z	neverblue	olivier	is it a speaker, headphones, etc?
2008-02-19T02:56:00.000Z	olivier	neverblue	i've tried with speaker and headphone
2008-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	neverblue	olivier	ok, so did you toggle the hardware (a switch on your laptop) which will open/close the audio, have you tried to restart your system, was your audio working before?
2008-02-19T02:58:00.000Z	olivier		neverblu e: in fact, I'm not the only one on internet with this problem ... maybie a bug with 82801H chipset
