2009-03-30T01:12:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	I've tried everything it says there...
2009-03-30T01:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	and what is the problem you have?
2009-03-30T01:13:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	I can run Java applets from my HDD, but not from the web.
2009-03-30T01:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	installled the sun-java6-plugin ?
2009-03-30T01:13:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	Yup.
2009-03-30T01:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	and it is the plugin listed in "about:plugins" (type that on the address bar)
2009-03-30T01:14:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	Nope.
2009-03-30T01:15:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	I have no idea what to do.
2009-03-30T01:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	are you sure you installed the package i said? what does "apt-cache policy sun-java6-plugin" says ?
2009-03-30T01:16:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	I'm positive.
2009-03-30T01:17:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	It says it's installed.
2009-03-30T01:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	sudo aptitude purge sun-java6-plugin && sudo aptitude install sun-java6-plugin
2009-03-30T01:19:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	It's running now.
2009-03-30T01:20:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	Well, the command you told me to, that is.
2009-03-30T01:20:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	Not Java.
2009-03-30T01:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	are you using stock firefox ? the one that comes with ubuntu?
2009-03-30T01:20:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	I upgraded.
2009-03-30T01:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	how ?
2009-03-30T01:21:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	I don't remember it was a long time ago.
2009-03-30T01:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	CheesyWeasel	but you did it manually; not with the update manager...
2009-03-30T01:21:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	That didn't do it.
2009-03-30T01:21:00.000Z	CheesyWeasel	erUSUL	Yes... :/
