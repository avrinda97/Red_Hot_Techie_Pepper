2010-04-14T04:25:00.000Z	shawnboy		I'm having network connectivity issues with non-ubuntu linux distribution. Would anyone like to help, or suggest a more appropriate channel?
2010-04-14T04:25:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	what distro?
2010-04-14T04:26:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	i'm pretty sure they hare defunct
2010-04-14T04:27:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	you could just go with ubuntu-minimal and cups
2010-04-14T04:28:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	or lpr/lpd
2010-04-14T04:28:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	thanks but would any of those run from one floppy? no hdd?
2010-04-14T04:29:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	uhm.. no. you'd have to boot someone and load in to ram
2010-04-14T04:29:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	with no hdd
2010-04-14T04:29:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	ubuntu is too big but there are other distro's i'm sure that may floppy load

2010-04-14T04:30:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	thanks for the tip. Maybe I can find a suitable replacement.
2010-04-14T04:30:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Linux
2010-04-14T04:30:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	I would find something thats a little more supported
2010-04-14T04:31:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	problem being the newer kernels are so big. thats why you 're goign to be stuck with an older kernel.
2010-04-14T04:31:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	yes, more supported would be nice. I was hoping to get this working on my old slow pc though. I'll keep fiddling and look at the links you suggest.
2010-04-14T04:32:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	yeah it can be done.
2010-04-14T04:32:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	would be much easier with an old hdd
2010-04-14T04:33:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	I may have to go that route. I probably have an old hdd. I just thought it'd be cool to have a print server running from floppy. :)
2010-04-14T04:33:00.000Z	histo	shawnboy	would be neat and can be accomplished
2010-04-14T04:34:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	especially since the ONLY things it needs to do is print and be on network.
2010-04-14T07:17:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	FYI I got things working with the floppy Linux print server. I used Winimage according to instructions. Earlier I had tried dd.
2010-04-14T07:17:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	I still don't understand why dd if=/path/filename.imz of=/dev/fd0 didn't work.
2010-04-14T07:18:00.000Z	shawnboy	histo	but at least my print server is working now from floppy.  :D
