2005-09-02T07:29:00.000Z	vladuz976		how can i add a dir to my PATH variable?
2005-09-02T07:30:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	export PATH=newdir:$PATH in bash
2005-09-02T07:31:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	yeah but that will only be for that terminal right?
2005-09-02T07:31:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	yes, add it to your ~/.bashrc if you want it to be set everytime you login (there's even some example for the ~/bin directory in there)
2005-09-02T07:33:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	.bashrc has nothing about the path in it
2005-09-02T07:35:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	then just look at .bash_profile (the bash manpage although quite large is your friend here)
2005-09-02T07:39:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	hey i added it to /etc/profile but when i echo $PATH it still looks the same
2005-09-02T07:40:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	you have to either 'source /etc/profile' or open a new shell
2005-09-02T07:40:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	how do i source it?
2005-09-02T07:41:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	i gave you the command, hence the "'"
2005-09-02T09:02:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	look at your ~/.bash_profile there's an example how to add ~/bin to your path in a save way
2005-09-02T09:03:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	ok
2005-09-02T09:06:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	where inthe bashrc file should i do as in the example from .bash_profile
2005-09-02T09:07:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	just add it to .bash_profile the same way the bin path is added (the if makes your .bash_profile portable, since you won't get errors if the path doesn't exist)
2005-09-02T09:08:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	now i am getting this
2005-09-02T09:09:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	pls paste your .bash_profile somewhere (you probably uncommented a line that should have a comment)
2005-09-02T09:09:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	thoreauputic yeah just commented line 28 out and it works now
2005-09-02T09:12:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/1692
2005-09-02T09:13:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	looks ok
2005-09-02T09:13:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	need to log out huh?
2005-09-02T09:14:00.000Z	ekimus	vladuz976	probably relogin is the easiest way to add it to your env shell
2005-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	vladuz976	ekimus	that didn't work, path still doesn't include the new dir
