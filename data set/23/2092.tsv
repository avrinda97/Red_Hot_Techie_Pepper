2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	space_cadet	pierre123	hrm.. i asked if you were trying to boot to windows... or another linux... please differentiate
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	pierre123		I have booted into the xp disk and tried to execute fixmbr and fixboot but I still can't seem to remove the grub bootloader
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	space_cadet		lol
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	space_cadet		hrm
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	pierre123	space_cadet	sorry I'm trying to boot into windows
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	space_cadet	pierre123	that should have wiped it out for you
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	pierre123		I know its strange, maybe I will boot into the Ubuntu LIve cd and check it out with gparted, do you think I will see it in there?
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	space_cadet	pierre123	unless you installed grub on your windows partition
2009-07-05T09:45:00.000Z	space_cadet		lol
2009-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	space_cadet		that would explain a grub error.
2009-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	space_cadet		bah
2009-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	space_cadet		gotta buy it
2009-07-05T09:47:00.000Z	space_cadet		well i will look into it.  ty  blackest_knight
2009-07-05T09:51:00.000Z	pierre123		I am looking at my hardrive in gparted and there is a fat16 DellUtility ntfs and fat32, there is no trace of my Ubuntu partition I don't understand where the grub bootloader is hidden?
2009-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	pierre123		hmm how can I remove it and restore the windows default bootloader?
2009-07-05T09:55:00.000Z	space_cadet	pierre123	you *could* get a floppy disk, quick format it, and throw a valid boot.ini, ntldr and ntdetect on it and see if it'll boot
