2005-07-29T06:03:00.000Z	teferi		stick a comma somewhere in there
2005-07-29T06:03:00.000Z	catolh	teferi	mostly connect to my SE T610 and send pictures/ringtones etc..
2005-07-29T06:04:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	easy
2005-07-29T06:04:00.000Z	catolh	teferi	could you walk me through it? cause im kind of lost here. Tried everything
2005-07-29T06:06:00.000Z	catolh	teferi	ok, im done
2005-07-29T06:06:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	okay. edit /etc/bluetooth/pin and put a PIN in there
2005-07-29T06:07:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	after that, make your phone "discoverable" (I can't tell you the exact details for how to do that, because i don't have a t610), and run "hcitool scan" to find your phone's bluetooth address
2005-07-29T06:07:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	it may also be called "Find Me"
2005-07-29T06:08:00.000Z	catolh	teferi	ok it found it
2005-07-29T06:08:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	got the address?
2005-07-29T06:08:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	great. remember that for future reference - you won't need it now if all you want to do is send stuff to the phone
2005-07-29T06:09:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	now, run gnome-obex-send <file you want to send>
2005-07-29T06:09:00.000Z	catolh	teferi	ok.. nice and thanks :)
2005-07-29T06:10:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	any questions, just ask me, i've spent the last week wrangling bluetooth with my phone
2005-07-29T06:11:00.000Z	catolh	teferi	have you tried out the fma? :>
2005-07-29T06:11:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	i don't ahve a SE phone :(
2005-07-29T06:12:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	i'd give my eyeteeth to have one, though. i want that accessory menu support bad
2005-07-29T06:12:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	anyway, did that work?
2005-07-29T06:13:00.000Z	catolh	teferi	it works :D Awesome, thanks
2005-07-29T06:13:00.000Z	teferi	catolh	woo! glad to help
