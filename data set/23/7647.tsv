2005-06-01T16:41:00.000Z	SlicerDicer		I am looking for the package updater program I cant find it in synaptic can somebody tell me the name please?
2005-06-01T05:00:00.000Z	SlicerDicer		does kubuntu have issues running the update-manager?
2005-06-01T05:00:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	nope
2005-06-01T05:01:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	I for some reason cannot run it except from terminal....
2005-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	how else would you run it?
2005-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	umm via the icon that it installed perhaps?
2005-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	I don't think it installs one, I think it has some gnome way of launching that doesn't show up in kde
2005-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	its in the menu in gnome if you look
2005-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	same with kde
2005-06-01T05:05:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	under system it says update manager 'ubuntu update manager'
2005-06-01T05:07:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	that's update-manager, which runs for me, thought you wanted update-notifier which sits in the system tray
2005-06-01T05:07:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	I run eitehr they dont work right....
2005-06-01T05:07:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	its odd....
2005-06-01T05:08:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	I think it default uses command gksudo or soemthing so its not doing that and well...
2005-06-01T05:12:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	gksu was not installed that was the problem now to figure out how to get the icon of the updater to look good in kde :)
2005-06-01T05:13:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	you should file a report on bugzilla, it should have a dependency on gtsudo
2005-06-01T05:43:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	I'd guess that gnome doesn't do transparancy on it's panel, or if it doesn't they don't talk to each other about it.
2005-06-01T05:43:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	poke me and I'll write an update-notifier for KDE
2005-06-01T05:47:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	if you nano /etc/group and remove that user from admin no su should be allowed correct? I dont know I tried to find the most likely equivelent to wheel in gentoo and that only makes sense
2005-06-01T05:48:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	sudo won't be allowed, su will
2005-06-01T05:49:00.000Z	SlicerDicer	Riddell	hmm ok
2005-06-01T06:59:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	do you have /etc/kderc?
2005-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Riddell	SlicerDicer	you can join #kubuntu
