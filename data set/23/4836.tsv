2007-04-26T16:03:00.000Z	bbrock		does anyone know how to install limewire on ubuntu, its really the only reason i installed it
2007-04-26T16:04:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	try something better. Frostwire is on the Gnutella network and works very similarly, but better
2007-04-26T16:04:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	sudo aptitude install frostwire
2007-04-26T16:05:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	how do i install frostwire? do i download it or do i type that into terminal?
2007-04-26T16:06:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	most things you can install from the repositories using aptitude or apt-get (apt-get and aptitude are essentially the same, but aptitude installs all dependencies on its own)
2007-04-26T16:06:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	im sorry i just started using linux last night. is aptitude a program?
2007-04-26T16:06:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	try "sudo aptitude install frostwire", and if your not ready for the command line interface "CLI", use synaptic package manager in system-->administration
2007-04-26T16:07:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	i will try that, thanks so much!
2007-04-26T16:08:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	aptitude is a "package manager" (no worries mate, this is my first month and the learning curve is amazing0
2007-04-26T16:09:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	gotcha, i typed that into terminal but it said it was "unable to unlock administration directory"\
2007-04-26T16:09:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	aptitude, apt-get, and synaptic aka synaptic package manager are the main ways to install, you wont have to worry about compiling from source or installing from downloads for a while, though if you find a .tar or .gz file that you want to install, you simply locate it by terminal and use the command install
2007-04-26T16:09:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	so to do an installation from command line (terminal) you would type sudo aptitude install filename/program
2007-04-26T16:10:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	you typed sudo aptitude install frostwire?
2007-04-26T16:10:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	have you enabled all universe and multiverse repositories
2007-04-26T16:10:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	i'm honestly not sure if i've enabled all repositories
2007-04-26T16:11:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	go through the steps to do that first, its a big deal
2007-04-26T16:11:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	ok i will do that right now
2007-04-26T16:11:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	go to ubuntuguide.org and start trying the things it says, and youll start learning fast...though you will still not understand why they do it for a while....thats the fun of troubleshooting!
2007-04-26T16:26:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	what is a root password?
2007-04-26T16:27:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	it is your login password
2007-04-26T16:27:00.000Z	bbrock	deCon	i'm trying to install SunJava, and it won't work
2007-04-26T16:27:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	there are two users in ubuntu to protect you, one that is your "user" account for running regular things, and a "superuser" or administrative account to edit configurations and main components
2007-04-26T16:28:00.000Z	deCon	bbrock	linux terminal is very case sensitive, make sure the package is named what it is, and all the letters are in proper case
