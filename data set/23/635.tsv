2011-04-30T09:23:00.000Z	rahduke	trueman	i have, been trying to install them for a half hour, the installer says nouveau kernel driver running, need to disable it in some modprobe place and in x conf, did that. no go

2011-04-30T09:23:00.000Z	trueman	rahduke	oh i see! try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop

2011-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	rahduke		 _pg_ that is a pain in the ass
2011-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	rahduke		especially if you have an old controller that is worn out
2011-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	rahduke		its never going to set correctly
2011-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	trueman	rahduke	that's a problem... For example i've got black screen after installed newest drivers
2011-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	rahduke		u need brand new sticks, and even then its iffy
2011-04-30T09:26:00.000Z	rahduke	trueman	i cant even get thru my install
