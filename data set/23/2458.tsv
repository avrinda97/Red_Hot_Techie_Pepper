2009-03-04T16:03:00.000Z	vfrc		does anyone know of a good *batch* mkv to avi converter similar to windows alltoavi?
2009-03-04T16:04:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	linux users take a single commands and turn them into scripts
2009-03-04T16:05:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	Microsoft users need special programs for many things that linux users normally create a simple script for.
2009-03-04T16:08:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	Converting videos can be a challenge, it is true.
2009-03-04T16:09:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	Lemme have a look at the manpage real quick. I'm pretty familiar with mplayer
2009-03-04T16:12:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	What command did you use with mencoder?
2009-03-04T16:14:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	This looks about right: mencoder -of avi -o file.avi file.mkv
2009-03-04T16:15:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	thanks. im just looking for the script i have been using
2009-03-04T16:16:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	Scripting is the easy part, I can do that for you. Do you have the code to convert 1 video from mkv to avi?
2009-03-04T16:17:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	do u mean the code i have been using? im just looking for that now
2009-03-04T16:22:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	found the ffmpeg command. it converts the video and audio fine but doesnt grab subtitles
2009-03-04T16:22:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	-r 29.97 -vcodec libxvid -vtag XVID -s 320x240 -aspect 4:3 -maxrate 1800k -b 1500k -qmin 3 -qmax 5 -bufsize 4096 -mbd 2 -bf 2 -flags +4mv+trell -aic 2 -cmp 2 -subcmp 2 -g 300 -acodec libmp3lame -ar 48000 -ab 128k -ac 2
2009-03-04T16:24:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	those are the options i have been using in conjunction with the preceding ffmpeg infile.mkv outfile.avi
2009-03-04T16:24:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	I assume you tried the option "-scodec copy"?
2009-03-04T16:24:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	To copy the subtitles?
2009-03-04T16:25:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	yeah but from my understanding, scodec is asking for a subtitle file as opposed to grabbing a subtitle stream from the mkv
2009-03-04T16:26:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	If the mkv has the subtitles in it, then they should be copied with the option "-scodec copy".
2009-03-04T16:28:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	The -scodec argument takes a codec name, not a file.
2009-03-04T16:28:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	do you think a subtitle stream can be specified in the case where there are multiple streams or the default is 0?
2009-03-04T16:29:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	I would try your normal command, and just add "-scodec copy" into it.
2009-03-04T16:29:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	trial and error
2009-03-04T16:30:00.000Z	vfrc	Sepero	true true. ill give scodec copy a try and if it works post a working script in the ubuntu forums. thanks for the help
2009-03-04T16:31:00.000Z	Sepero	vfrc	ok
