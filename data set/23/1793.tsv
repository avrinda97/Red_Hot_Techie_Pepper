2009-12-28T01:52:00.000Z	evanescent		any idea why ubuntu 9.10 is hanging with a blank screen during the installer when I try to re-install it on my desktop?
2009-12-28T01:54:00.000Z	evanescent		most work fine
2009-12-28T01:54:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	have you checked the respective gnove versions? It seems the gdm has trobles handeling a update.
2009-12-28T01:54:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	what do you mean?
2009-12-28T01:54:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	I am installing fresh from the install CD
2009-12-28T01:55:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	I did a manual gnome update a while back and I got a blank screen at startup.
2009-12-28T01:55:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	what is odd is that I am running 9.10 now and it works fine, but when I try to install it from the cd I can't.
2009-12-28T01:56:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	is the CD the same ubuntu version?
2009-12-28T01:56:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	yes
2009-12-28T01:56:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	but I got 9.10 before by upgrading from 9.04
2009-12-28T01:58:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	and the disk version is updated from the CD??
2009-12-28T01:59:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	right.. Well the CD shoudn't see the disk version.
2009-12-28T01:59:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	it doesn't, that's not the issue
2009-12-28T01:59:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	it just hangs when I try to install
2009-12-28T02:00:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	that leaves a bad disk. Have you checked the CD for bad sectors?
2009-12-28T02:00:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	I did the consistency check and it's OK. but to be sure, I re-downloaded the ISO and burned the disk again. same issue
2009-12-28T02:02:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	ok, so basically 9.10 is the problem. And a update overts the problem. How about the graphics driver on the disk version?
2009-12-28T02:02:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	nvidia's proprietary one is what I use on the version I have installed
2009-12-28T02:04:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	well obviously the disk version doesn't use that. What happens when you trie to run GDM on disk with the standatd driver? (To log in if it fails use the text option in the grub loader
2009-12-28T02:05:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	I haven't tried that. I could try installing in the safe graphics mode and it might work
2009-12-28T02:07:00.000Z	Younder	evanescent	worth a try..
2009-12-28T02:07:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	how do I fix it once installed if it hangs every time at boot?
2009-12-28T02:07:00.000Z	evanescent	Younder	that is, get the proprietary driver installed
