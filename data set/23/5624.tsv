2007-07-29T09:22:00.000Z	noldon		if i have lost my partition table is there a way to get it back?
2007-07-29T09:23:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	Yes there is a way but it is a bit difficult.
2007-07-29T09:23:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	ok how
2007-07-29T09:25:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	what where the partition types? Rather the filesystem types?
2007-07-29T09:28:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	Before we get into the way that works but takes about an hour. Please use the LiveCD and boot from that. Then install GPART. It tries to guess which paritions are on the hard disk.
2007-07-29T09:29:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	the man page for gpart: http://linux.die.net/man/8/gpart
2007-07-29T09:29:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	do i have to use live cd
2007-07-29T09:29:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	well, you need a way to boot your computer so you have access to the disk.
2007-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	or grab the ultimatebootcd and jump in there chan for help. http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ultimatebootcd.com%2F&ei=3wmsRuflC5DQeuGKyfMF&usg=AFQjCNGXFsEb1DhrlxVrZRfWLJ8qogmOdg&sig2=2l8px1W5yFDlAL8zXlUohw

2007-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	but im in linux now and its a secondary disk thats broken
2007-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	o. that is good.
2007-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	install gpart
2007-07-29T09:37:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	so how is this working
2007-07-29T09:38:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	`sudo gpart /dev/hda` or which-ever device you would like.
2007-07-29T09:39:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	does this work with sata disk
2007-07-29T09:39:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	yes.
2007-07-29T09:40:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	but it only seems to support ext2
2007-07-29T09:41:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	you are right. It thinks that the ext3 is ext2 but the superblocks are the same.
2007-07-29T09:49:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	is gonna take some time right
2007-07-29T09:49:00.000Z	choudesh	noldon	yes.
2007-07-29T11:19:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	i got this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31766/ on the gpart scan
2007-07-29T12:25:00.000Z	noldon	choudesh	ive tried everything now and its gone
