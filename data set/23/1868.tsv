2010-03-23T17:34:00.000Z	bigcx2		hey all...i rebooted today and lost all of my gnome configurations
2010-03-23T17:34:00.000Z	bigcx2		wonderful way to start the day
2010-03-23T17:34:00.000Z	bigcx2		and i was trying to set up my keyboard shortcuts
2010-03-23T17:34:00.000Z	bigcx2		and for some reason the gnome-keybinding-properties dialog isn't recognizing my super_l key?
2010-03-23T17:35:00.000Z	bigcx2		any ideas? xev properly recognizes it
2010-03-23T17:36:00.000Z	bigcx2		xmodmap tells me i have two super_l keys
2010-03-23T17:37:00.000Z	bigcx2		is there any way to get rid of that????
2010-03-23T17:37:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	do you want to just use that key alone?   I can only use it as a modifier, like shift alt ctrl
2010-03-23T17:37:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	yea i just want to use Super_L to launch a terminal
2010-03-23T17:38:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	that's the way i had it before my gnome settings decided to crap out on me this morning
2010-03-23T17:38:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	I don't know.  I just use the Menu key myself
2010-03-23T17:39:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	gnome-keybinding-properties doesn't recognize that either
2010-03-23T17:42:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	well, if your system crashed, maybe some of your files got corrupted.  It may be easiest to reinstall
2010-03-23T17:42:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	easier said than done
2010-03-23T17:43:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	do you have a separate /home?
2010-03-23T17:43:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	the weird thing is, my system didn't crash
2010-03-23T17:44:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	well _something_ went wrong, maybe there is a way to go back to the defaults?
2010-03-23T17:44:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	yea, not sure what that would be though!
2010-03-23T17:46:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	well, I do have a command in mind, but it is quite risky.  You would have to be prepared to reinstall anyway, as the command might make things worse
2010-03-23T17:47:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	ok, listening
2010-03-23T17:47:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	so you have all your data backed up?
2010-03-23T17:49:00.000Z	bigcx2	ChogyDan	i'm not going to run the command blindly, just curious as to what you're thinking
2010-03-23T17:49:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bigcx2	instead of /apps/panel  run it on just /                 btw, this is only a command to run blindly
