2006-06-19T11:58:00.000Z	ElPenguin		i'm having a few issues trying to install django (python framework), looks like a missing python makefile. however there isn't even one there, let alone in the right place. any ideas ?
2006-06-19T12:00:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	django works fine for me from svn
2006-06-19T12:00:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	i've got the SVN copy, however i'm still on hoary.
2006-06-19T12:00:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	what's the actual error?
2006-06-19T12:01:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)
2006-06-19T12:01:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	you need the python-dev package for that
2006-06-19T12:02:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	thanks. installing
2006-06-19T12:02:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	there are .deb packages too for django
2006-06-19T12:03:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	i'll look for them, because i can't find python-devel :( maybe it's got the version number in
2006-06-19T12:03:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	python2.4-dev is the name of the package, and django packagec can be found via planet debian 
2006-06-19T12:04:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	thanks, you've been a great help
2006-06-19T12:04:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	anythong for spreading django, it's a rocking framework
2006-06-19T12:04:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	did you ever use turbogears?
2006-06-19T12:05:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	no
2006-06-19T12:05:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	i love the way some bits work, cleaner than django. However, you need to keep the python-based (!) server running and have apache proxy to it, which slows it down stupidly
2006-06-19T12:06:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	django is pretty clean, especially since magic-removal
2006-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	yeah. I do prefer turbogears in some areas, but the way it has to work sucks. I love the way turbogears integrates templates with actions
2006-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	you just return a hash, the key is the page variable, the value is the value to replace with. it fills them into the template
2006-06-19T12:07:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	django does that too 
2006-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	i haven't had time to properly explore it heh
2006-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	Seveas	ElPenguin	heh, just follow the tutorial, it's pretty decent
2006-06-19T12:08:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	i got a couple of pages done
2006-06-19T12:10:00.000Z	ElPenguin	Seveas	woohoo, it's installed
