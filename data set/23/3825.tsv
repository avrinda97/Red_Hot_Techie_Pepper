2008-08-05T00:45:00.000Z	arooni		top seems to give memory allocation percentages only.  is there a way to get how many actual MB a particular program or process is using?
2008-08-05T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	top
2008-08-05T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	i believe its in bytes
2008-08-05T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	95Mb
2008-09-18T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	you tried envyng-gtk?
2008-09-18T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2008-09-18T14:07:00.000Z	arooni	ActionParsnip	same error as before
2008-09-18T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	dell do it

2008-09-18T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	does envyng not help out?
2008-09-18T15:17:00.000Z	arooni	ActionParsnip	no;  niether does compiling drivers by unix utility, or envy, or restricted modules
2008-09-18T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	tried the driver from www.nvidia.com
2008-09-18T15:17:00.000Z	arooni	ActionParsnip	yeah i did
2009-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	all over the place, apps use lots of shared libs so there is no Program Files folder like in windows
2009-02-17T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	you can see where a single deb will install by extracting it but the app will have dependancies which will be in other places
2009-02-17T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	you could download its dependancies to see where they go too but its a fairly pointless exercise

2009-11-17T13:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager    then run ccsm, you can setup cube whatevers there
2010-05-26T11:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	also make sure you install ubuntu-restricted-extras for codec goodness which cannot be included for legal reasons
2011-06-14T09:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	uninstall old kernels
2011-06-14T10:00:00.000Z	arooni	ActionParsnip	i doubt that they are taking that much spacE? i fresh installed ubuntu on this box a few weeks ago?
2011-06-14T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	each kernel is about 120Mb
2011-06-14T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	arooni	also run:   sudo apt-get clean
