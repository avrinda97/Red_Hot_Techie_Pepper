2011-03-10T13:11:00.000Z	Wauraudon		I'm writing a script that prompts the user for many things on a CLI install of Ubuntu. I'm considering switching from dialog to zenity. Is it practical to start a basic xterm so zenity can function on a CLI machine?
2011-03-10T13:13:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	I read recently that it's generally frowned upon to run an xserver on a server

2011-03-10T13:15:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	It's a CLI install of Ubuntu for space reasons, but it's not a server machine. dialog's file select prompt is a little non-user-friendly
2011-03-10T13:16:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	then it sounds like a good idea to me :)
2011-03-10T13:16:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	What would I need to just get zenity working from the CLI? (xterm?)
2011-03-10T13:18:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	I've never done it but I'd assume not much more than the xserver & ssh
2011-03-10T13:18:00.000Z	Chipzzz		(or xterm if you're at the machine)
2011-03-10T13:20:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	xserver and xterm?
2011-03-10T13:21:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	& gtk
2011-03-10T13:27:00.000Z	Wauraudon		Cipzzz: I have xterm running but it's in the upper left corner of the screen, not fullscreen
2011-03-10T13:27:00.000Z	Wauraudon		Chipzzz*
2011-03-10T13:28:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	are you at the machine with the x-server or remote?
2011-03-10T13:28:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	at the machine. Running startx opens what I believe is xterm. Running xterm directly results in ""Can't open display" though
2011-03-10T13:31:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	what happens when the window is open & you type "xeyes"?
2011-03-10T13:31:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	it works, the eyes are in the upper left corner though
2011-03-10T13:32:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	you can't move the window (or is there no window)?
2011-03-10T13:32:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	No window, it's just a black screen with a prompt in the upper left corner, but the 'window' appears to only take up maybe 1/4 of the screen in the upper left corner
2011-03-10T13:35:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	try this... go back to the terminal & type "export DISPLAY=:0.0", then start your xsession
2011-03-10T13:36:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	Same thing, Though I suppose it's not a major issue since zenity appears normally above the terminal, with no window borders though
2011-03-10T13:38:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	you might look into Xnest... I think it only needs an xserver to run
2011-03-10T13:42:00.000Z	Wauraudon	Chipzzz	If I try to start zenity from CLI, I get 'cannot open display :0.0', I'm assuming because there is no xserver running?
2011-03-10T13:43:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Wauraudon	you would have to start the xserver first
