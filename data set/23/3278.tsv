2008-06-03T10:05:00.000Z	cecc		when it open firefox, the interface of Firefox stuck
2008-06-03T10:06:00.000Z	cecc		so what is the reason for this?
2008-06-03T10:06:00.000Z	meltingclock	cecc	stuck?
2008-06-03T10:07:00.000Z	cecc	meltingclock	yes
2008-06-03T10:08:00.000Z	meltingclock	cecc	what do you mean
2008-06-03T10:08:00.000Z	cecc		I think, it is sthing about the gnome
2008-06-03T10:08:00.000Z	cecc	meltingclock	the firefox's interface stuck
2008-06-03T10:09:00.000Z	cecc		and even the pidgin's face stuck
2008-06-03T10:09:00.000Z	cecc		yes
2008-06-03T10:09:00.000Z	cecc		it seems to be busy
2008-06-03T10:09:00.000Z	meltingclock		hmm
2008-06-03T10:09:00.000Z	cecc		but the cpu usage is not too much
2008-06-03T10:10:00.000Z	meltingclock	cecc	I have no idea. I was going to ask about your cpu usage but it's not much you say
2008-06-03T10:10:00.000Z	cecc	meltingclock	yesterday when I turn off my ubuntu, the power button can not be used
2008-06-03T10:11:00.000Z	cecc		I think, maybe there is sth wrong with the gnome
2008-06-03T10:11:00.000Z	cecc		I mean the desktop environment
2008-06-03T10:12:00.000Z	meltingclock	cecc	that is very strange...hmm..   i'm unsure how to trouble troubleshoot this one
2008-06-03T10:12:00.000Z	cecc	meltingclock	anyway, is there a method to reinstall the ubuntu?
2008-06-03T10:12:00.000Z	cecc		thank you meltingclock
2008-06-03T10:12:00.000Z	meltingclock	cecc	completely? you could always reformat and reinstall...
