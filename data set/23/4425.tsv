2007-08-17T08:12:00.000Z	gvsa123		how do you guys manage to type in the nicknames so quickly?
2007-08-17T08:12:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	That was to you.
2007-08-17T08:15:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	cool
2008-01-17T18:32:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	Theres no need to enable the root account to edit root's crontab.
2008-01-17T18:32:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	just run `sudo crontab -e`
2008-01-29T21:29:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	Why not just put something in /etc/cron.daily/ ?  see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#head-ac6f1801d153ace57eb035524ce05d1955b8c243
2008-01-29T21:34:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	the link you gave is pretty much similar to what i wanted to do? except that it's already a given that this will be run daily because it's located in /etc/cron.daily?
2008-01-29T21:35:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	yep.
2008-01-29T21:36:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	which means that everything put into the /etc/cron.daily will be run daily? so i could just make files containing the command, chmod 755 it and it will run?
2008-01-29T21:38:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	Yes.
2008-01-29T21:44:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	and that cronjob will be executed everyday for all users of the desktop?
2008-01-29T21:45:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	Any time changes will be global the the computer.
2008-01-29T21:46:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	i see... but anything placed inside /etc/cron.daily will be for all users given that the permissions are 755?
2008-01-29T21:46:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	I'm not sure what you're asking.
2008-01-29T21:48:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	i mean, text files with commands inside them, when put inside /etc/cron.daily, will be executed at boot regardless of the user who logs in? or will it only run for the user who created the file?
2008-01-29T21:48:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	Anything stuck in there will be run as root.
2008-01-29T21:49:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	oh so my ntpdate file will not run when limited users login?
2008-01-29T21:49:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	You're scheduling it to run once a day regardless of whether someone is actually logged in or not.
2008-01-29T21:50:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	hmmm....
2008-01-29T21:51:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	plus all users will be able to execute it because of the 755 permission right?
2008-01-29T21:52:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	suppose i shutdown the pc for one day, then a limited user logs in uses it... will /etc/cron.daily/ntpdate run?
2008-01-29T21:53:00.000Z	Pici	gvsa123	whomever is logged in has no effect on cron jobs.
2008-01-29T21:53:00.000Z	gvsa123	Pici	oh...
