2006-01-23T17:59:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X	navarone	http://tx.pastebin.com/510749
2006-01-23T06:01:00.000Z	navarone	ToRTuReD_X	I assume you are only using this drive to store files for windows install?
2006-01-23T06:01:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X	navarone	nah it's my storage drive in general
2006-01-23T06:02:00.000Z	navarone		okay ToRTuReD_X could you run sudo fdisk -l in terminala nd paste contents?
2006-01-23T06:04:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X	navarone	http://tx.pastebin.com/510756
2006-01-23T06:05:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		i know /dev/hdb1 is the drive
2006-01-23T06:05:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		it's just the mounting that confuses me
