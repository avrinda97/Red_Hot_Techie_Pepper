2009-03-04T01:38:00.000Z	hmw		I seem to have a selective problem with Skype; I can call my other PC and the Test Service work fine, too. But when I call a certain friend, he can hear me for about 2 seconds, until my sound completly dies system wide. Ideas?
2009-03-04T01:40:00.000Z	hmw		Too weird.
2009-03-04T01:41:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	Sound Devices -> Auto Adjust Mixer Levels
2009-03-04T01:42:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	I always turn the automatic adjustment OFF. It was turned ON today for an unknown reason.
2009-03-04T01:42:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	ok
2009-03-04T01:45:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	Reboot why?
2009-03-04T01:45:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	I thought your sound was fixed when you shut down skype?
2009-03-04T01:45:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	My Ubuntus (got 4) often stop doing misc. errors after a reboot. I know, rebooting Linux would usually not help, but my expirience tells another story.
2009-03-04T01:46:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	ok
2009-03-04T01:46:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	Skype wont let me call this one friend. I can call my other PC and the test service, though. So I suspect there is confusion somwhere in RAM.
2009-03-04T01:47:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	Try calling me- sepero111
2009-03-04T01:57:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	Does this tell you anything: http://pastebin.com/m386d7b3e
2009-03-04T01:58:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	does this tell you anything: http://pastebin.com/m386d7b3e ?
2009-03-04T01:59:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	I'm looking at it
2009-03-04T02:01:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	The only thing I can recommend is trying different settings for SoundIn & SoundOut under Options -> Sound Devices
2009-03-04T02:02:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	I already tried to switch over to ALSA. Skype wont work with anything except some certain out of 6 options. I will continue googleing. Thanks!
2009-03-04T02:02:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	You might want to try searching google for the error output you have. Like "skype ltdl-bind-now.c: Failed"
2009-03-04T02:03:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	It looks like it might be a limitation on your hardware.
2009-03-04T02:03:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	It just started today, in the middle of a longer conversation. Fedora does not have this problem.
2009-03-04T02:04:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	Ah, in that case, I would delete my skype settings folder under /home and put the settings back in.
2009-03-04T02:05:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	I mean, manually put the settings back in.
2009-03-04T02:06:00.000Z	Sepero	hmw	ok, i must go. good luck
2009-03-04T02:07:00.000Z	hmw	Sepero	thx
