2008-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	np glhf :)
2008-10-27T12:27:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	do you have the *.14 kernel installed?
2008-10-27T12:29:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	:)
2008-10-27T12:32:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic ?
2008-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	& jim_p: hehe thanks :)
2008-10-27T12:35:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	you could check you menu.lst first, to see if its been added
2008-10-27T12:35:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	ok, good idea :)
2008-10-27T12:36:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	it was... restarting now... brb!
2008-10-27T12:36:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	glhfdd!
2008-10-27T12:40:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	& Flannel: nothing happends when I hit ESC during boot... it still chooses the *.15 kernel... even though I hit it repeateadly
2008-10-27T12:40:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	you could change which it chooses be default in menu.lst
2008-10-27T12:41:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	or you could tell grub to not show the "press esc.." and display the actual menu
2008-10-27T12:42:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	that would be better I guess, cause Im not sure what to edit in the menu.list... how do I do that? having to chose which kernel every time? :)
2008-10-27T12:42:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-10-27T12:43:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	I can do it in vim?
2008-10-27T12:43:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	scoll down to line 12 (in mine at least) and edit hiddenmenu to #hiddenmenu
2008-10-27T12:43:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	sure
2008-10-27T12:44:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	ok :)
2008-10-27T12:46:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	worked :) thank you very much for your help... now I guess I can just continue with the upgrade as explained on the upgrade-help on the webpage
2008-10-27T12:47:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	do so, and once again glhfdd :)
2008-10-27T12:47:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	eh, but now it started in low graphics mode... dunno why..
2008-10-27T12:48:00.000Z	ay^	spazm	probably your graphis driver is for the other kernel
2008-10-27T12:48:00.000Z	spazm	ay^	ah ok.. then I will just go ahead with the upgrade anyway
