2012-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	question_		is here someone with experience with "screen"?
2012-06-06T05:48:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	screen the multiplexer?
2012-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	i always use 'screen -RR' for re-attachment
2012-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	and "    ctl-a ?  "  to list shortcuts
2012-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	the multiplexer-programm, I separated two screens, but theyre mirroring all also after initialising a new session and pressing ctrl-a ctrl-n
2012-06-06T05:50:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	ctl-a ?  "
2012-06-06T05:50:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	"  ctl-a ?  " gives descriptions of other things too..
2012-06-06T05:50:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	ctrl-a says "no other window"
2012-06-06T05:50:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	you type "ctl-a" then you type "?"  (dont type the quotes)
2012-06-06T05:51:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	ctrl-c for new session
2012-06-06T05:51:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	pm me..
2012-06-06T05:51:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	pm? I'm doing irc in chrome ...
2012-06-06T05:51:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	you let go of all the keys after you do "ctl-a"  --- once you let go of all those two keys then you hit a character key
2012-06-06T05:52:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	it's "ctl-a" (then let go of everything), then tap the "n" key, to go to next terminal.. -- personally it's easier to use "ctl-a <spacebar>" to cycle through terminals
2012-06-06T05:53:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	so for new session, it's "ctl-a" then let go of all keys, then tap the "c" key
2012-06-06T05:53:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	this works so I've a new session
2012-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	but if I'm typing something it'll be mirrored in the other separation
2012-06-06T05:55:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	no.. it means you've cycled to the same terminal
2012-06-06T05:55:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	you cycle using "ctl-a" "space"
2012-06-06T05:56:00.000Z	jagginess	question_	"?" is a literal..it's like this-> type "ctl-a" then type "?" (hold the shift key down to get to the ?-- get the literal)
2012-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	thanks
2012-06-06T06:06:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	its mirroring every char in the other screen
2012-06-06T06:13:00.000Z	question_	jagginess	Thank you :) I'm leaving
