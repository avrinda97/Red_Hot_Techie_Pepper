2009-09-10T05:17:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	What version of Ubuntu were you running before 9.04?
2009-09-10T05:18:00.000Z	godmodegrafix	Pici	it's irrelevant because i wiped out my whole harddrive before installing it
2009-09-10T05:19:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	Oh. Well you said you updated to 9.04.  Does Ubuntu crash while you are installing updates or is it on the next reboot that you boot to a tty?
2009-09-10T05:20:00.000Z	godmodegrafix	Pici	and then when i reboot my laptop, i try boot the linux kernel and it leaves my in tty
2009-09-10T05:22:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	Have you noticed that it crashed during a particular package? or is it random?
2009-09-10T05:24:00.000Z	godmodegrafix	Pici	never took notice, I only let it happen once.... cause from my previous experiences i had from 6.10.. i knew that the only way to fix this issue was to repartition my HD and remove linux altogether...then install again from live cd..
2009-09-10T05:26:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	Well, 6.10 was nearly 6 releases ago, we may have a completely different issue here.  Is your graphics card by chance made by intel?
2009-09-10T05:27:00.000Z	godmodegrafix	Pici	im not sure, how would i find out?
2009-09-10T05:28:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	open a terminal and type: lspci and look for something that looks like a graphics adapter
2009-09-10T05:29:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	Some people today were discussing intel graphics issues with the latest updates, I'm not sure which package it was though.
2009-09-10T05:30:00.000Z	godmodegrafix	Pici	actually nvm, my graphics card is RADEON
2009-09-10T05:33:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	hmm... I've really not seen a package install crash Ubuntu in.. well never.
2009-09-10T05:33:00.000Z	godmodegrafix	Pici	this is strange... :\
2009-09-10T05:34:00.000Z	Pici	godmodegrafix	You could try updating from the terminal if you have a network connection there.. otherwise just try again from the gui and maybe it was just coincidence.
2009-09-10T05:35:00.000Z	godmodegrafix	Pici	thanks, I'll figure it out eventually... i dont want to run the risk of having to reinstall ubuntu right now though..
