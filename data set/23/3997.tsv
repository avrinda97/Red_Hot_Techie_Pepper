2012-05-05T11:02:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	yea ;)
2012-05-09T03:49:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	the 12.04 upgrade won't show until the point release. To upgrade now you need to use 'sudo do-release-upgrade -d'
2012-05-09T03:50:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	and always make backups! :) Just sayin'
2012-05-09T03:50:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	What is a point release and what is the benefit to wait for it? (yes, backups were very first thing I did)
2012-05-09T03:51:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	I believe. it's simply an interim period to get any serious issues worked out before updating "production" machines.
2012-05-09T03:52:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	So if I upgrade now, naturally it will get to the 'point release' with progressive upgrades?
2012-05-09T03:52:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	yep, if you keep up with updates.
2012-05-09T03:53:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	Alright, thanks for the tips. I will try do-release-upgrade (which I thought would have been the same as upgrade-manager -d, but apparently not)
2012-05-09T03:53:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	possibly, I've only used do-release-upgrade -d *shrug*
2012-05-09T03:55:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	well I don't want to upgrade to the -d(evelopment) version.. want to keep it on 12.04 release
2012-05-09T03:57:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	afaik until point release that's the only way, there hasn't been anything released for Quantal yet anyway, has there? I suppose you could do what I did for one of my machines. I downloaded the actual install iso and upgraded from that :)
2012-05-09T03:58:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	yes, they won't let it flag as available until the point release
2012-05-09T03:58:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	I am prepared to do a clean install but I wanted to give this a chance as I've never tested the LTS->LTS upgrade path
2012-05-09T03:59:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	I "upgraded" of the disc :) It has that option now.
2012-05-09T03:59:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	10.04 to 12.04 from a CD made with the install iso.
2012-05-09T04:00:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	Well I downloaded xubuntu for now. This unity fiasco is simply horrid. I don't see how canonical can stamp their name on such garbage
2012-05-09T04:00:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	lol, I felt the same way, I firced myself to use unity, it has made a LOT of progress. It still does take some getting used to.
2012-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	Well it's upgrading now with do-release-upgrade -d. Hopefully it will JustWork
2012-05-09T04:04:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	only issue I ran into was reconfiguring a couple of packages on my "server" machine.
2012-05-09T04:06:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	Oh, I configure my machines until they're almost not recognizable ubuntu installations ;) I just wanted to test an LTS->LTS upgrade and see how it pans out. My default usage is usually to always install fresh, as upgrades are problematic
2012-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	wylde	soreau	I typically do fresh installs as well. I too decided to try it out this time. I only had a few minor issues, although I've heard some horror stories.
2012-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	soreau	wylde	I assume if you don't know what you're doing, things could get messy pretty quick ;)
