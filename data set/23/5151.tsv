2007-02-12T08:05:00.000Z	cables	norty	you didn't back up?
2007-02-12T08:05:00.000Z	cables	norty	if you changed the format of the partition, it's way too late...
2007-02-12T08:06:00.000Z	cables	norty	you formatted the drive from ntfs to linux-swap... the data's gone.
2007-02-12T08:07:00.000Z	cables	norty	if you already copied it, copy it to somewhere else...
2007-02-12T08:07:00.000Z	cables	norty	get a USB drive...
2007-02-12T08:07:00.000Z	cables	norty	how can you access the files now?
2007-02-12T08:07:00.000Z	cables	norty	plug USB drive in, drag files over.
2007-02-12T08:08:00.000Z	cables	norty	usb drives?
2007-02-12T08:09:00.000Z	cables	norty	if you can access them, just put them somewhere... if you can see them, you haven't lost them. Use a USB drive
2007-02-12T08:10:00.000Z	cables	norty	use gksudo...
2007-02-12T08:11:00.000Z	cables	norty	then type "gksudo nautilus"
2007-02-12T08:11:00.000Z	cables	norty	we were suggesting using the gui
2007-02-12T08:12:00.000Z	cables	norty	gksudo nautilus will let you access them.
2007-02-12T08:12:00.000Z	cables	norty	that opens Nautilus as root
2007-02-12T08:13:00.000Z	cables	norty	rm -r
2007-02-12T08:13:00.000Z	cables	norty	no... rm -r path
2007-02-12T08:42:00.000Z	cables	norty	alt-f2 then "gksudo nautilus", then navigate to the folder
2007-02-12T08:42:00.000Z	cables	norty	you can even set permissions from there
2007-02-12T08:42:00.000Z	cables	norty	you won't be able to write to it, but you can read from it...
2007-02-13T09:54:00.000Z	cables	norty	can't you just put the drive in a Windows machine?
