2005-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	sounds like DNS issues
2005-02-06T15:50:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	are you using DHCP?
2005-02-06T16:06:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	you need dns :)
2005-02-06T16:07:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	you machine needs an ip to find another machine, dns is the way your machine finds what ip www.google.com (or anybody else) is
2005-02-06T16:07:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	which windows is it
2005-02-06T16:08:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	I dont know how to get your DNS servers in XP... can you run "ipconfig" in a cmd prompt ?
2005-02-06T16:11:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	if you type ipconfig/all on the windows box the output should list your DNS servers.
2005-02-06T16:11:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	those ips should go into your resolv.conf
2005-02-06T16:14:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	well what does it say ? did you find the DNS ?
2005-02-06T16:14:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	ok good
2005-02-06T16:14:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	you need to "sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf"
2005-02-06T16:15:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	and put both the ip addresses in it, alone each on a line
2005-02-06T16:15:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	no
2005-02-06T16:15:00.000Z	Rotundo	timo_	yes sor
