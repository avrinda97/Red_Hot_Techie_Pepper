2007-06-18T11:29:00.000Z	berent		guys there is a easier way to know where your jdk is
2007-06-18T11:29:00.000Z	berent		go to administration and open that coffee cup of java
2007-06-18T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	if you're using the ubuntu packaged ones, update-alternatives --list java
2007-06-18T11:32:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	it's a pretty sophisticated system inherited from debian, but you're right, not real obvious
2007-06-18T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	it you're curious, ls /etc/alternatives
2007-10-25T06:45:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	"dpkg-owned" means it was installed with dpkg or one of the apt-front ends, and the file is managed by dpkg. libc (assuming that's what it meant) is a fundamental part of a linux distro, and shouldn't have a competitor
2007-10-25T06:46:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	: i am getting this . http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/42026/
2007-10-25T06:47:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	did you compile tls or something ?
2007-10-25T06:47:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	i am upgrading from feisty to gutsy
2007-10-25T06:48:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	by googling i found it to be error thrown by preinst script of the glibc-2.6.1
2007-10-25T06:48:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	did it have the solution?
2007-10-25T06:49:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	:http://people.debian.org/~terpstra/message/20070420.170208.696efa62.en.html
2007-10-25T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	and on my system, that file /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc-2.6.1.so is owned by libc6
2007-10-25T06:55:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	ok, this is not advice, unless you know exactly how to undo this from a live cd: mv libc-2.3.6.so to another name.
2007-10-25T06:58:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	: same error again
2007-10-25T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	try apt-get remove libc6-i686 first
2007-10-25T07:02:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	: unmet dependencies :libc6-dev: Depends: libc6 (= 2.6.1-1ubuntu9) but 2.5-0ubuntu14 is to be installed
2007-10-25T07:03:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	no, not good, what do your sources.list look like
2007-10-25T07:03:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	all gusty
2007-10-25T07:03:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	all gutsy
2007-10-25T07:04:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	you should call Jordan_U into this as well, he's pretty knowledgeable. I would go into aptitude and remove & purge down to the point it would install, but that's not an optimal solution
2007-10-25T07:05:00.000Z	berent	nickrud	: Jordan_U :  I tried this http://shearer.org/Debugging_Dpkg_Problems but nothing got printed when i did "dpkg -l | grep libpthread"
2007-10-25T07:08:00.000Z	nickrud	berent	I would look around your sources again, do apt-get -f install, make sure you have no third party sources or packages installed, didn't use automatix, before doing much else
