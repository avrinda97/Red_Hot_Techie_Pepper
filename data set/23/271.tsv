2012-02-18T08:50:00.000Z	DanDare		Hello. Whats the name of app for gnome or KDE (cant remember), that will show disposable wireless network in a icon?
2012-02-18T08:51:00.000Z	DanDare		It also informs network activity if its connected or disconnected in the taskbar
2012-02-18T08:51:00.000Z	cfhowlett	DanDare	  disposable wireless?  hmm.  In gnome that would be the indicator applet
2012-02-18T08:51:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	but its used to make connections also, by clicking in the icon
2012-02-18T08:51:00.000Z	cfhowlett	DanDare	  right click to connect, right
2012-02-18T08:52:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	yeah
2012-02-18T08:52:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	you click to connect and it prompts for WPA key in a window

2012-02-18T08:54:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	I see. I think its not this one, thanks anyway. Im looking for some automated program to connect to wireless
2012-02-18T08:54:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	the one i remember have animated icon while trying to connect
2012-02-18T08:55:00.000Z	cfhowlett	DanDare	  hmm.  Can't say as I'm familiar then.  What version of buntu are you on?
2012-02-18T08:57:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	I think its network-manager-gnome

2012-02-18T09:00:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	im installing network-manager-gnome. I think thats what i look for
2012-02-18T09:00:00.000Z	cfhowlett	DanDare	  I seem to recall that wifi radar was the default in 7.04/7.10.  FWIW that pic I showed you is from network-manager with the same/better functionality
2012-02-18T09:01:00.000Z	cfhowlett	DanDare	  invoke from cli with nm
2012-02-18T09:01:00.000Z	DanDare	cfhowlett	ok
2012-02-18T09:02:00.000Z	cfhowlett	DanDare	  wait 1 - misinformation...
