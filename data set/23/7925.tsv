2005-03-24T08:25:00.000Z	TQuid		Hi folks.
2005-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	TQuid		Just installed ubuntu, nice system.  Unfortunately it seems to think my slash character is this:  
2005-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	TQuid		Any clues on fixing that  (Oh, and theres my question mark.  :))
2005-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	TQuid		This is a Toshiba Portg 7200, fwiw.
2005-03-24T08:27:00.000Z	TQuid		Its as if I have a French kbd or something.
2005-03-24T08:27:00.000Z	TQuid		squall, ubuntu is rootless
2005-03-24T08:28:00.000Z	TQuid		It uses sudo for everything.
2005-03-24T08:28:00.000Z	daniels	TQuid	try running setxkbmap -layout us
2005-03-24T08:28:00.000Z	TQuid		So Im told, and when I did a rooty thing earlier, my own password worked.
2005-03-24T08:29:00.000Z	TQuid		Hm.
2005-03-24T08:29:00.000Z	TQuid		That did it.
2005-03-24T08:29:00.000Z	TQuid		squalls, haven't tried non-X.  Maybe it's 'cause I selected Canadian?  Does ubuntu assume I mean Quebecois or something?
2005-03-24T08:29:00.000Z	TQuid		sudo roxx0rs.
2005-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	TQuid		It is the true sysadmin's friend; much improves how root privs are handled, as they're trackable.
2005-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	TQuid		How do I make that kbd layout change stick over a reboot?
2005-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	TQuid		I've only ever seen knoppix as a live CD.  I went to ubuntu because someone described it as "Debian without the bullshit."
2005-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	daniels	TQuid	the default for canadian locales is a french-based keyboard, yeah
2005-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	daniels	TQuid	this will be fixed
2005-03-24T08:31:00.000Z	TQuid	daniels	 Aaah.  This Canuck thanks you.
2005-03-24T08:31:00.000Z	daniels	TQuid	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and change Option "XkbLayout" "fr" (or maybe it's us_intl instead of fr) to Option "XkbLayout" "us"
2005-03-24T08:31:00.000Z	daniels	TQuid	along with many others, it seems -- it's a popular bug
2005-03-24T08:31:00.000Z	TQuid		Danke daniels, that's what I need.
2005-03-24T08:32:00.000Z	daniels	TQuid	enjoy
