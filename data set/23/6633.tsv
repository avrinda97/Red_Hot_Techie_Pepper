2006-04-03T05:45:00.000Z	kijun		Ompaul:  I tried it many times
2006-04-03T05:46:00.000Z	ompaul	kijun	is it ethernet or something else?
2006-04-03T05:46:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	but it never worked.. so I have to do "pppoeconf" every time
2006-04-03T05:46:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	 ethernet
2006-04-03T05:46:00.000Z	ompaul	kijun	is the router running dhcp?
2006-04-03T05:47:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	yes I do
2006-04-03T05:47:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	 I use DSL service, and I only use DSL modem
2006-04-03T05:48:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	 it use DHCP in software manner
2006-04-03T05:49:00.000Z	ompaul	kijun	it is strange that it does not pickup the network straight off, in the only case I ever had of that it was a faulty network card, try this move the network card to a different slot it _may_ help
2006-04-03T05:49:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	Oh~ yes... it might be
2006-04-03T05:49:00.000Z	ompaul	kijun	if it does not then I would suggest replacing the ethernet card
2006-04-03T05:49:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	hmm....
2006-04-03T05:50:00.000Z	kijun	ompaul	 the problem is... I am using a laptop computer... so it is not that easy to replace the network card.
