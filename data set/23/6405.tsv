2006-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	have you tried using another web browser?
2006-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	gaim does not work either
2006-04-20T07:41:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	would you mind typing out what you get as a response?
2006-04-20T07:41:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	your connection is not set up properly. Is this a wired connection?
2006-04-20T07:42:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	if it's telling you that it time out's
2006-04-20T07:42:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	can you actually transmit data?
2006-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	ya..
2006-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	yes
2006-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	but i cant browse sites via firefox or connect to icq via gaim
2006-04-20T07:44:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	it makes no sense that you can't ping out, connect through firefox, or use gaim.
2006-04-20T07:45:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	what is your wireless interface's name?
2006-04-20T07:45:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	i am not using a wireless device
2006-04-20T07:46:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	its a 3com 390-TX card
2006-04-20T07:46:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	you told me it times out when you try to ping, therefore it's not actually pinging.
2006-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	i told you its get a timeout via firefox..
2006-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	Red-Bull	blindx	16ms ping reply
2006-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	do ifconfig from terminal and tell me what you get under eth0
2006-04-20T07:48:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	are you using static ip, or dhcp?
2006-04-20T07:49:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	If your internet connection works with you using DHCP, then we know it's not the system or the card, but your settings instead.
2006-04-20T07:51:00.000Z	blindx	Red-Bull	lol fine. I'm done. Good luck.
