2009-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	Ramonster		Kevdog: Understood
2009-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	You need only do the folder but if this is the first time and you have sub folders do a -r
2009-07-12T05:32:00.000Z	Ramonster	ubuser	like wat OttifantSir said? :)
2009-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	That is not what I was referring to
2009-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	Sudo chmod 777 folder -r
2009-07-12T05:38:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	Under samba from the viewpoint of a windows xp box even if you don't have permissions you will still see files and folders
2009-07-12T05:39:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	you are saying you Linux box doesn't see the files on a windows xp box?
2009-07-12T05:40:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	 the same computer?
2009-07-12T05:43:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	can you see other files in that folder that you put there with the file system?
2009-07-12T05:44:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	Think about it for a second and it will come to you
2009-07-12T05:45:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	Test and copy a file into that folder using the file system
2009-07-12T05:45:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	No do it on the Linux box
2009-07-12T05:47:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	 just copy some file into that folder. Turn off your windows box. Tell us if you get error messages
2009-07-12T05:49:00.000Z	Ramonster	ubuser	yes
2009-07-12T05:50:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	Your destination folder for windows is a different folder than that for Linux
2009-07-12T05:51:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	Your share name seen in windows is not the folder you just placed the files in via linux
2009-07-12T05:51:00.000Z	Ramonster	ubuser	You're right. Forgot I also made a shared folder in /home/ with the same name :|
2009-07-12T05:53:00.000Z	ubuser	Ramonster	You have to set up a share that points to the correct folder
2009-07-12T05:53:00.000Z	Ramonster	ubuser	What is the correct link to that folder?
2009-07-12T05:54:00.000Z	Ramonster	ubuser	since 192.168.1.2\downloads isnt the samba folder
