2007-12-24T00:29:00.000Z	dom		any ideas why GDM isn't showing any users in the chooser?
2007-12-24T00:30:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	did u set it up in gdmsetup
2007-12-24T00:31:00.000Z	dom	drgeb	ompaul: i'm looking under the Users tab, and include all users from passwd is checked
2007-12-24T00:34:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	no idea
2007-12-24T00:35:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	can u upload your gdm.conf on  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-12-24T00:37:00.000Z	dom	drgeb	in /etc there's gdm-cdd.conf, gdm.conf, gdm.conf-custom
2007-12-24T00:38:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	yep
2007-12-24T00:39:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	I believe it is using both gdm.conf and gdm.conf-custom
2007-12-24T00:40:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	I am currently having problems with my greeter where if I use themed it crashes in the tty type I have setup for Xgl use
2007-12-24T00:40:00.000Z	dom	drgeb	here's gdm.conf http:/paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49434/
2007-12-24T00:41:00.000Z	dom	drgeb	here's gdm.conf-custom http:/paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49435
2007-12-24T00:42:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	what you can also do is look inside /var/log/gdm to see what these files say
2007-12-24T00:43:00.000Z	dom	drgeb	the logs are pretty clean
2007-12-24T00:44:00.000Z	dom	drgeb	<20 lines

2007-12-24T00:52:00.000Z	dom	drgeb	it was a fresh install. i tried a couple of different themes too, thinking it might be that. but no use
2007-12-24T00:55:00.000Z	drgeb	dom	I am trying to learn this I am not an expert at it trying to learn how this works
