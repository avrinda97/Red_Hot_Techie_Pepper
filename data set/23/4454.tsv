2007-08-08T10:40:00.000Z	TheCheese		Well, I have a tiny problem.
2007-08-08T10:40:00.000Z	TheCheese		I have a 20 gig master drive
2007-08-08T10:40:00.000Z	TheCheese		and a 60 gig slave.
2007-08-08T10:40:00.000Z	TheCheese		can I install the / and /home to the slave?
2007-08-08T10:40:00.000Z	TheCheese		can I install the swap to the slave too?
2007-08-08T10:41:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	can you swap the drives so the bigger drive is primary?
2007-08-08T10:42:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	I could, but I don't know how.  I know there is a pin, I need to take from one and slip into the other.  Can I do it easily by opening just the side of the case?
2007-08-08T10:42:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	or do I have to take the drives physically out?
2007-08-08T10:43:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	Depends on how the drives are positioned in the case because the pins are on the back of the drives
2007-08-08T10:43:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	let me check, the case is a clear case
2007-08-08T10:44:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	are you dual booting, or is there a reason you want the / partition on the slave?
2007-08-08T10:45:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	they look like they're at the bottom of the case, pointing towards the front of the case.  I see wires coming out of one side, yellow, black, and red.
2007-08-08T10:45:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	I assume this is the back of the drives?  with the plug in it?
2007-08-08T10:46:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	yes
2007-08-08T10:46:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	could you help me locate the pins on an example picture so I don't screw this up?
2007-08-08T10:47:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	what should I use, in place of a anti-static bracelet?  I don't have one.  Should I touch a metal screwdriver first or a doornob?
2007-08-08T10:47:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	each manufacturer is different, they will usually have a diagram on the drive and if not you could google the manufacturer and model #
2007-08-08T10:48:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	just don't be standing on carpet, and preferably wearing shoes or barefoot and just touch the case first
2007-08-08T10:48:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	is it ok to reach in with my hands and touch the parts?
2007-08-08T10:49:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	yeah just try not to touch to much of the circuitry, the oils/grease on fingers can sometimes short stuff
2007-08-08T10:50:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	I'm going to go do it now.  I will let you know how it goes.
2007-08-08T10:50:00.000Z	TheCheese	palintheus	thanks for the help
2007-08-08T10:50:00.000Z	palintheus	TheCheese	good luck, np
