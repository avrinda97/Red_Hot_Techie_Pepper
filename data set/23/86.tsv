2012-07-30T18:40:00.000Z	eoo		any help?
2012-07-30T18:41:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	Chances are you forgot to select language in one of the menus.
2012-07-30T18:41:00.000Z	eoo		i did select language
2012-07-30T18:41:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	There's one particular step where it's not obvious that you should.
2012-07-30T18:41:00.000Z	eoo		after selecting lanuagues it quit
2012-07-30T18:42:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	You select language a few times, then it shows you what looks like a summary of what languages to include. Whats not immediately obvious is that you have to click and select a language on that summary.
2012-07-30T18:42:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	Failing to do this will cause it to exit.
2012-07-30T18:43:00.000Z	eoo		i had the option to select languages
2012-07-30T18:43:00.000Z	eoo		i picked 'en'
2012-07-30T18:44:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	Then did you pick en again afterwards?
2012-07-30T18:44:00.000Z	eoo		how can i select a language a few times?
2012-07-30T18:44:00.000Z	eoo		i only had one chance
2012-07-30T18:44:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	You have to first select it once, then you get a list of your selected languages. There you have to select it again.
2012-07-30T18:45:00.000Z	eoo		i never get past step 1
2012-07-30T18:45:00.000Z	eoo		before it automatically exits
2012-07-30T18:45:00.000Z	eoo		but i do click on en
2012-07-30T18:46:00.000Z	eoo		its fustrating
2012-07-30T18:49:00.000Z	eoo	DebolazW	cant u try it on you own system first
2012-07-30T18:49:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	I have tried it, that was what happened to me.
2012-07-30T18:50:00.000Z	eoo		did it work?
2012-07-30T18:51:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	Once I figured out the language problem, that part wasn't an issue anymore.
2012-07-30T18:52:00.000Z	eoo	DebolazW	how did u fix it
2012-07-30T18:52:00.000Z	DebolazW	eoo	The way I described.
