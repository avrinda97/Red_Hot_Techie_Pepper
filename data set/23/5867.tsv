2006-10-05T09:34:00.000Z	Lane		I have some questions that begin "What distro is best for ...". Is there a channel that caters to these questions
2006-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 most all the disrtos can do the same jobs.. some are just designed with a specific job in mind from the start. :)   so often the best is the one that you know best.
2006-10-05T09:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!apt-get
2006-10-05T09:36:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	I know mepis best but I don't think I want to use it as a web/dns server.
2006-10-05T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 you could...
2006-10-05T09:37:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	not saying I couldn't.
2006-10-05T09:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 and from what i gatehr Mepis is  basicially using all the ubuntu repos/packages now.. and some extras..
2006-10-05T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 of course the heart of the disrtos are the apt-get system I guess..and the debian  type core..   the rest is just frosting on the server-cake :)
2006-10-05T09:38:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	Great, debian it is.
2006-10-05T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 thats always good. :P   of course once ya learn the fundamentals.. the rest is easy
2006-10-05T09:40:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	My nokia runs debian, my laptop runs debian, and my future web/dns server runs debian... if only it could run IOS like my routers
2006-10-05T09:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 my NSLU2 runs a debian variant now. :P
2006-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	NSLU2?
2006-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 a little fileserver. has 2 usb ports for hard drives.. by Linksys. about $80
2006-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	cool deal I will have to check it out.
2006-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	reccomended mirror for debian? Or should I use torrent?
2006-10-05T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 your speeds may vary. :P my torrent speeds are always slow. :(
2006-10-05T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!vi
2006-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis		esc :wq
2006-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis		:help    -- is handy to rember in vi as well
2006-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis		NerdStar :)
2006-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	Lane	Dr_willis	my torrent speeds are also slow...should I suspect throttling?
2006-10-05T09:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Lane	 no idea there.. ive gotten good speeds on some torrents.. like ISO's when first released...  so it all depends on the torrents i guess
