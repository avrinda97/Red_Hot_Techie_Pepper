2012-01-12T00:50:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	1st: get debs from http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#HL-2280DW
2012-01-12T00:51:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	ok, then what?
2012-01-12T00:52:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	install them, "sudo dpkg -i *.deb" in the dir you downloaded them to
2012-01-12T00:57:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	ok, so download relevant debs, sudo dpkg -i them, and then look for it on the network?
2012-01-12T00:58:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	open "localhost:631" in your browser, add a printer, use "socket://192.168.x.y" or whatever your printers IP is as device
2012-01-12T00:59:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	thanks
2012-01-12T01:27:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	you have to use dpkg --force-architecture ....deb
2012-01-12T01:28:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	Brother doesn't ship 64bit-packages
2012-01-12T01:32:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	thanks
2012-01-12T01:55:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	little help?
2012-01-12T01:56:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	with?
2012-01-12T01:58:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	browser, localhost:631, add printer, if your printer isn't listed enter it manually using your 2280DW driver and "socket://ip.adr.of.printer" as device
2012-01-12T01:58:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	drvier - Brother - scroll the list, there should be a driver for the 2280dw listed now
2012-01-12T02:31:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	it's assigning ip by dhcp is that ok?
2012-01-12T02:20:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	another roadblock:  Queue not Enabled ... reason given is "Destination printer does not exist!"... and every time I "enable" it in the policies on the print manager, it immediately resets to off when I click "apply"
2012-01-12T02:21:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	did you enter the correct IP in the device-field? can you ping that ip?
2012-01-12T02:29:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	where do I find the ip in the device field? Is it a pure numeric ip?
2012-01-12T02:30:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	you should have been asked for a device/port when installing the printer. there you should have entered "socket://192.168.x.y"   or whatever your printers IP is
2012-01-12T02:30:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	i have to leave now, good luck
2012-01-12T02:31:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	thanks
2012-01-12T02:32:00.000Z	excelsior	llutz	and I see four brother models, and I've just been selecting the first one.
2012-04-03T20:31:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	"it was"
2012-04-03T20:36:00.000Z	llutz	excelsior	that wouldn't make sense, since a period of 2 yrs without kernelchanges (security fixes) would be stupid
