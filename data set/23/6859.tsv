2005-12-21T09:01:00.000Z	proxosi		hey guys
2005-12-21T09:01:00.000Z	proxosi		why wouldnt vlc read wmv?
2005-12-21T09:02:00.000Z	proxosi		actually my vlc player cant display the image of the video only sound... what is wrong?
2005-12-21T09:03:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	not all wmv's are equal; some play, some don't in my experience
2005-12-21T09:04:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	I've heard of a thing called crossover, or wine. which allows you to run windows media player
2005-12-21T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	I'd google windows media player wind
2005-12-21T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	a winintel box
2005-12-21T09:15:00.000Z	proxosi	nickrud	emmm me a beginner of linux.. i dont understand those terms :(
2005-12-21T09:16:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	there are microprocessor families; i386 came before pentium and athlon. It's a shorthand for computers that use those types of chips
2005-12-21T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	wintel (I typed it wrong before) means windows and intel.
2005-12-21T09:17:00.000Z	proxosi	nickrud	so im amd 64.. so im not using those .. am i m correct
2005-12-21T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	oh yes, that amd64 is a direct descendant of the i386
2005-12-21T09:18:00.000Z	proxosi	nickrud	........ so im i386?
2005-12-21T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	but, and here's a little catch, it's capable of 64 bit fetching, where the pentium is not. Some advice: use the i386 distro instead of the amd64 one, you won't be sorry. Multimedia, flash, etc don't work well on the amd
2005-12-21T09:20:00.000Z	proxosi	nickrud	ok... so i followed some steps of http://www.winehq.com/site/download-deb    but im stuck after the first picture
2005-12-21T09:21:00.000Z	proxosi	nickrud	it told me to search for 'wine'         but there are so many results i dotn know which one to choose
2005-12-21T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	I have have never used wine. I don't run windows but for one program.
2005-12-21T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	sudo apt-get install wine :)
2005-12-21T09:22:00.000Z	proxosi	nickrud	i got this " Package wine is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2005-12-21T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	did you get that pm?
2005-12-21T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	and one more piece of advice: please don't paste in the channel
2005-12-21T09:24:00.000Z	proxosi	nickrud	sorry.. thought it was very short... didnt know it adds up that much line
2005-12-21T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	proxosi	it used to be 4 lines was ok, then 3, now, 1 :)
