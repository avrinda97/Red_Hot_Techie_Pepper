2006-06-21T05:52:00.000Z	pekay		Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2006-06-21T05:53:00.000Z	pekay		:/
2006-06-21T05:53:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	You need a 3D driver. What model is your graphics card?
2006-06-21T05:55:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	nvidia, NV34 [GeForce FX 5200] 
2006-06-21T05:55:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	opengl worked fine till I installed nvidia stuff
2006-06-21T05:55:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	I doubt it, since the Free Software "nv" driver which Ubuntu ships with has no OpenGL support
2006-06-21T05:56:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	:S, yes but i tested glxgears when i installed Ubuntu ;p
2006-06-21T05:56:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	and the gears worked
2006-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	They will appear, but they have nothing to do with your graphics card. When you use the nv driver the whole OpenGL architecture is made out of software called Mesa which is executed by your CPU. The only thing your graphics card does is make a convienient place to plug your monitor into
2006-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	This is a very slow situation, and doesn;t work for a lot of situations (hence your problem)
2006-06-21T06:00:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	alrighty, following the wiki
2006-06-21T06:05:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	got some X Server error on the "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable"
2006-06-21T06:08:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	I never use that tool myself, so I would do it manually (replace: Driver                   "nv" with: Driver                      "nvidia")
2006-06-21T06:08:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	where? :S
2006-06-21T06:09:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	Look for it. It will be under the mouse and keyboard stuff
2006-06-21T06:10:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	oh this " Driver  "nvidia""
2006-06-21T06:10:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	It already says it?
2006-06-21T06:10:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	had "nv"
2006-06-21T06:10:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	Ah, OK (I was a little confused there, as this may have been a serious problem!)
2006-06-21T06:10:00.000Z	Warbo	pekay	Yes
2006-06-21T06:13:00.000Z	pekay	Warbo	thanks alot :] ] ]  works!
