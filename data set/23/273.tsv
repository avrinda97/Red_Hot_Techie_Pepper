2012-03-05T07:51:00.000Z	sun_devil		I heard you can use ftp and send a file in your public dir.  My vsftpd is on.  Have been researching how to use ftp
2012-03-05T07:52:00.000Z	iToast	sun_devil	are you running a ssh server?
2012-03-05T07:52:00.000Z	sun_devil		no
2012-03-05T07:52:00.000Z	sun_devil	iToast	no
2012-03-05T07:52:00.000Z	iToast	sun_devil	i would have said just sFTP into it if you were :|
2012-03-05T07:53:00.000Z	iToast	sun_devil	does the ftp acc have access to your website document directory
2012-03-05T07:53:00.000Z	iToast	sun_devil	and does it have RWX rights to it?
2012-03-05T07:53:00.000Z	sun_devil		not a website, i set the permissions to chomod 777
2012-03-05T07:54:00.000Z	iToast	sun_devil	best way is to try it and see if it throws a error.
2012-03-05T07:54:00.000Z	sun_devil	iToast	have you ever used it?
2012-03-05T07:55:00.000Z	iToast	sun_devil	the dameon, no. i perfer to use sFTP even though its inside a locked up network >:3
