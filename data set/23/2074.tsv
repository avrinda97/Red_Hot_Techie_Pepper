2010-11-06T17:59:00.000Z	lexington		anyone here uses pianobar?
2010-11-06T18:01:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	yes i do
2010-11-06T18:03:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	when you do sudo apt-get upgrade are there packages held back?
2010-11-06T18:05:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	huh, that is weird.  after a fresh install of pianobar on 10.10 i am getting the same error
2010-11-06T18:07:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	one sec.  I have reproduced the issue on my system.  I will figure it out.
2010-11-06T18:11:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	here is the fix http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=480433&postcount=11
2010-11-06T18:11:00.000Z	lexington	switch10_	 thanks, I'll test this out.
2010-11-06T18:12:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	dont bother the link is dead sorry.
2010-11-06T18:15:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	and it looks like the guy developing it is giving up :(
2010-11-06T18:16:00.000Z	lexington	switch10_	Lameness.  Are there any other non-flash ways to access pandora
2010-11-06T18:16:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	he is promoting this alternative.  although it doesnt say anything about pandora.  http://www.coderholic.com/pyradio/
2010-11-06T18:17:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	pithos, but I think it uses pianobar as a backend as it is a GUI
2010-11-06T18:18:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	but try it out.  http://blog.kevinmehall.net/2010/pithos
2010-11-06T18:18:00.000Z	lexington	switch10_	are you having any problems using pianobar yourself?  Just cursious if this is something that pandora updated that broke pianobar
2010-11-06T18:19:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	yes I am experiencing the same problem as you
2010-11-06T18:34:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	no prob.  good luck.
2010-11-06T18:20:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	try pithos if you dont mind a GUI
2010-11-06T18:21:00.000Z	lexington	switch10_	going to test it out here in a second.  I'll keep you posted
2010-11-06T18:25:00.000Z	lexington	switch10_	 Pithos isn't working for me either.  Error: Pandora does not support your client version.
2010-11-06T18:28:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	that is exactly what happened.  they dont want people doing what we are doing. :)  skipping adds and such.  have you tried last.fm?  I use it in rhythmbox, and it is great.
2010-11-06T18:30:00.000Z	lexington	switch10_	yeah pianobar was awesome! no adds and it didn't take away from my limited 40 hours of listen time.  I'll tried last.fm a long time ago and didn't really care for it.  I'll give it another go
2010-11-06T18:30:00.000Z	lexington	switch10_	 anything out there for slackerradio?
2010-11-06T18:32:00.000Z	switch10_	lexington	not that I know of.
