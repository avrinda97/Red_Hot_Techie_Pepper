2010-05-17T00:41:00.000Z	Scott_1		Hi, the fan on my computer goes at full speed in Ubuntu and is very noisy. How can I get it to slow down?
2010-05-17T00:42:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	that could be an ACPI problem. And if it's that, it can't be easily solved because of Microsoft vendors lock-ins
2010-05-17T00:43:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	what manufacturer is your PC?
2010-05-17T00:44:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	did it come with Windows Vista?
2010-05-17T00:45:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	Yes.
2010-05-17T00:45:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	it's Asus M2N-SLI AM2
2010-05-17T00:45:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	are you sure it's the mainboard/cpu fan and not the GPU(Graphic card) fan? btw, is it a desktop?
2010-05-17T00:46:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	I'm not sure where the noise comes from exactly to be honest. It is a desktop.
2010-05-17T00:47:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	could you try to put the mouse behind the graphics card in windows and linux to find out if its a GPU problem?
2010-05-17T00:47:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	nVidia recently had problems with fans on their GPUs, so...
2010-05-17T00:48:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	did i say mouse? god.. i meant hand
2010-05-17T00:49:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	i have lost my mind somewhere... Australia i guess
2010-05-17T00:50:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	I just opened the hardware options and a message popped up to say the nvidia graphics driver isn't installed.
2010-05-17T00:50:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	maybe that's the problem, try to install it and let me know the results :)
2010-05-17T00:51:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	downloading now
2010-05-17T00:51:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	do you have Ubuntu 10.04?
2010-05-17T00:51:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	9.10
2010-05-17T00:52:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	i encourage you to update (but do a clean install)
2010-05-17T00:53:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	what's better about 10.04?
2010-05-17T00:53:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	nouveau, for example, it's a new open source driver for nVidia :)
2010-05-17T00:54:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	apart from faster startup times, and improved speed
2010-05-17T00:54:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Scott_1	but it's all up to you, obviously :)
2010-05-17T00:55:00.000Z	Scott_1	Beyecixramd	I'm happy with the startup times / speed I currently have.  I was quite pleased with the new features last time I upgraded Ubuntu so I might give it a whirl in the future.
