2008-10-21T00:13:00.000Z	xfm		hello I need help to configure my wifi on ubuntu 8.04, where can I find help?
2008-10-21T00:13:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 what hardaware you got?
2008-10-21T00:15:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	don't know exactly. I have ubuntu 8.04, and wicd manager. iwconfig find the wifi card, and I can see the wifi in the network manager, but I can't connect (have and ip)
2008-10-21T00:15:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 list the output of lscip at paste.ubuntu.com
2008-10-21T00:18:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	I have posted the results of this command and some else : http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=261070
2008-10-21T00:19:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	the fact is, it worked until last week so I know it's possible to make it work with my hardware
2008-10-21T00:20:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 your card is installed and working according to that log you posted, if youc ant connect ot a specific netowrk then I'm not sure it's an ubuntu issue?
2008-10-21T00:21:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	yes, 'cause a microsoft windows os is currently connected on this wifi
2008-10-21T00:22:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 wep or wpa?  try connecting with neither and see what happens
2008-10-21T00:23:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	I have tried both, no one works
2008-10-21T00:23:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 have you tried without encryption?
2008-10-21T00:25:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	and I am currently connected to a network with no key that I find, strange that it works in that case and not with my network
2008-10-21T00:26:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 try turning wep/wpa off and connecting to your network, if this works then obviously you have problems with encrypted networks and we can move from there
2008-10-21T00:58:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	I'm back. With my IAP, it's impossible to desactivate the WEP/WAP key.
2008-10-21T00:59:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	thats pretty strange
2008-10-21T00:59:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 well, I'm not really sure what your problem is
2008-10-21T01:00:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	but true. Quite a good IAP mm?
2008-10-21T01:01:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	When I try to connect to my network, Wicd manager says: "Connecting" then "waiting for authentication" then ... finished
2008-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	xfm	csilk	perhap's if I remove the drivers and reinstall them?
2008-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	csilk	xfm	 that would be the first port of call
