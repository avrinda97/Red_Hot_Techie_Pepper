2010-09-19T17:45:00.000Z	allu2	misc--	so X is running
2010-09-19T17:44:00.000Z	allu2	misc--	if i press powerbutton it promps out the shutdown options but well i can't press them :P
2010-09-19T17:38:00.000Z	misc--	allu2	maybe X just froze... have you tried restarting gdm from ssh? sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2010-09-19T17:39:00.000Z	allu2	misc--	i'll try, but question is why it froze? and as this is not the first time it get's annoying
2010-09-19T17:40:00.000Z	misc--	allu2	may be it's the screensaver or something along those lines that's causing it... I've seen a few cases recently where that's happened
2010-09-19T17:40:00.000Z	allu2	misc--	it freezez randomly by any random act i do, sometime it runs for days and sometimes just few minutes
2010-09-19T17:41:00.000Z	misc--	allu2	can you push ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a console, when it freezes? I guess it's not a complete freeze because you can still ssh in to it
2010-09-19T17:42:00.000Z	allu2	misc--	doesn't work, no input from keyboard or mouse(touchpad) nor external (usb mouse) is accpeted
2010-09-19T17:42:00.000Z	allu2	misc--	nothing happens, clock ticks on the panel and i can ssh on it
2010-09-19T17:42:00.000Z	allu2	misc--	just input it frozen
2010-09-19T17:43:00.000Z	misc--	allu2	Ah right I see. Hmmmm I'm not sure about that one then :/
2010-09-19T17:44:00.000Z	misc--	allu2	to verify that it really is just the input, you could maybe enable remote desktop (system -> preferences -> remote desktop) and then see if you can vnc to it when it freezes again
2010-09-19T17:46:00.000Z	misc--	allu2	I'm thiking... but I can't think of anything to try...
2010-09-19T17:51:00.000Z	misc--	allu2	maybe this might help: http://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1478787 but... 105 pages of stuff to read
