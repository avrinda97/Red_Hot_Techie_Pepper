2012-02-02T22:50:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	you don't disable su... you enable pam protections
2012-02-02T22:50:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	he wants to disable su
2012-02-02T22:50:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	the libraries define how that authorization is checked
2012-02-02T22:51:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	it would be simple enough to get a list of suid binaries on the system
2012-02-02T22:51:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	really i think he needs to just set strong passwords and if he doesn't trust the user.. the user shouldn't have access
2012-02-02T22:52:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	as we are all saying
2012-02-02T22:52:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	yup.. as soon as they have any access level there's potential
2012-02-02T23:00:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	i disagree if only because i believe shell scripts should be portable
2012-02-02T23:01:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	anyways... i think when he's checking >1000 being off by one file that had a carriage return in the name might not be a big deal
2012-02-02T23:01:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	an if every file has it?
2012-02-02T23:02:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	or maybe touch $'a\nb\nc\nd\ne'
2012-02-02T23:02:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	on my system (ubuntu 11.04) your touch command doesn't do what you think it does
2012-02-02T23:05:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	you are correct.. piping the ls into a file shows the line break
2012-02-02T23:10:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	so what's a portable way to do it? i doubt inotify is available on hpux and aix for example
2012-02-02T23:11:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	on every linux
2012-02-02T23:11:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	on every linux with 2.6.x if i am correct, 2.4 does not have inotify
2012-02-02T23:12:00.000Z	imbezol	iceroot	not sure i catch your meaning. what's a portable way, 2.4, 2.6, commercial unix, etc..
2012-02-02T23:13:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	find
2012-02-02T23:14:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	find foobar | wc -l
2012-02-02T23:14:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	not if using this print0 thing with xargs
2012-02-02T23:14:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	manpage  cant remeber it
2012-02-02T23:22:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	you are right, find is failing on that
2012-02-02T23:22:00.000Z	iceroot	imbezol	or i am failing to read the manpage :)
