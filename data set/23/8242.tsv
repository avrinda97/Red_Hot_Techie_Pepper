2004-11-15T11:14:00.000Z	rublind		How do you mount a windows drive (XP) so that it's not owned by root?
2004-11-15T11:15:00.000Z	rublind		mount -t ntfs -o rublind /dev/hdb1 /home/rublind/Desktop/HDD2 ?
2004-11-15T11:15:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	-o uid=1001,gid=101 or similar
2004-11-17T14:12:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	what's the problem ?
2004-11-17T14:20:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	do you want to tell us your sound problem ?
2004-11-17T14:21:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	sorry I didn't respond earlier, but I wasn't aware that anyone had spoken (no sound..)
2004-11-17T14:21:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	any errors or silently silent ?
2004-11-17T14:22:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	I don't think so.
2004-11-17T14:22:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	I can tell you that when I right-click the speaker in the top corner, and click "Open Volume Control" my sound card is last.
2004-11-17T14:23:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	what do you mean by "last" ?
2004-11-17T14:25:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	ok, what's the output of sudo lsmod ?
2004-11-17T14:25:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	one second.
2004-11-17T14:27:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	you got that link, right?
2004-11-17T14:27:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	ok, are all the "Master" volumes and all the "PCM" volumes unmuted ?
2004-11-17T14:27:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	yes, I just did that.
2004-11-17T14:28:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	I do hear a beeping coming from my computer, but this is due to a change I made in xChat (it beeps on highlighted messages)
2004-11-17T14:28:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	and what happens when you try and play a .ogg file ?
2004-11-17T14:28:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	I don't have any.
2004-11-17T14:28:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	I have music on my windows hard drive, but I am having problems mounting it.
2004-11-17T14:29:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	so what have you tried to play ?
2004-11-17T14:29:00.000Z	mercurus	rublind	music CD will probably work ...
2004-11-17T14:29:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	I hope so.
2004-11-17T14:32:00.000Z	rublind	mercurus	any ideas?
