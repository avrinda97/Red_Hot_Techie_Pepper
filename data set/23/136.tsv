2012-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	shrapnel		after installing updates on 12.04 and rebooting, my laptop has lost network connectivity. looks like the network manager is broken.
2012-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	shrapnel		going into system settings, networking, gives me the message, "the system network services are not compatible with this version"
2012-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	shrapnel		ifconfig + dhclient can get me a wired connection to my router. haven't investigated wifi. the networkmanager applet has gone missing.
2012-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	Open a terminal and type "pstree -p | grep nm"
2012-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	Did it return with anything?
2012-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	yep, it shows up in the process list.
2012-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	nm-applet shows up?
2012-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	yes.
2012-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	With what PID?
2012-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	3081.
2012-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	what can you tell from a PID?
2012-06-06T07:34:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	The PID tells me the PID :P So your issue is that the nm-applet won't show up to be used?
2012-06-06T07:36:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	?
2012-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	sorry, connection dropped.
2012-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	So your issue is that nm-applet is not showing up?
2012-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	I suppose, though I can't bring up the networking control panel, either (not sure if that's implemented as a call to the applet).
2012-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	Are you using 12.04?
2012-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	and, of course, the applet doesn't seem to be doing its job. it doesn't automatically establish wired or wireless connections the way it usually does.
2012-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	yes.
2012-06-06T07:42:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	Try killing the process and restarting it?
2012-06-06T07:44:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	connection should be stable now. yes, using 12.04.
2012-06-06T07:45:00.000Z	Saeryn	shrapnel	Ok, I'd inquire to someone a little more experienced with 12.04 I have yet to take that endevour. Sounds like it could be an issue relating to that :)
2012-06-06T07:45:00.000Z	shrapnel	Saeryn	thanks anyway.
