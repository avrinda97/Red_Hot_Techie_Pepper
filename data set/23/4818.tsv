2012-07-12T20:28:00.000Z	Gnea		looks like I was able to reboot just fine...

2012-07-12T20:28:00.000Z	Gnea		Release:        11.04
2012-07-12T20:28:00.000Z	Gnea		:D
2012-07-12T20:29:00.000Z	Gnea		*facepalm*
2012-07-12T20:30:00.000Z	magpie	Gnea	i tried top and i have 1 zombie app, what the hell is zombie state?
2012-07-12T20:31:00.000Z	Gnea	magpie	first of all, please don't swear
2012-07-12T20:31:00.000Z	magpie		second of all ?
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		it's an app that's stopped responding
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		you can try to kill -9 or kill -15 it's PID
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		sometimes you can't
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	magpie		you're losing me mate
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		but you might be able to get away with killing it's PPID
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		okay, the PID is the Process ID
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	magpie		how do i  find it?
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		every process has one.
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		well, you used top, so you have it already
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		ps also can get it
2012-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Gnea		ps axf <- like that
2012-07-12T20:33:00.000Z	magpie		so if i type in terminal ps axf   <---- it will kill the zombie app?
2012-07-12T20:33:00.000Z	Gnea		no
2012-07-12T20:33:00.000Z	magpie		ok
2012-07-12T20:33:00.000Z	Gnea	magpie	start with the basics: man ps
