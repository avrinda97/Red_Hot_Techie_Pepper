2008-11-14T03:11:00.000Z	sliwowitz		Masterkiller> It finished at around 50% telling me that the installation is complete, but some packages didn't install
2008-11-14T03:11:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	you can try to boot from live cd, mount the system, chroot into it, and then try to install the missing things. if you need instructions regarding chroot, look perhaps at the gentoo handbook, here: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=6#doc_chap1
2008-11-14T03:12:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	That was my first idea, but I'm not sure if I can run anything inside the chroot, because every command runs into the libc issue
2008-11-14T03:13:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	it goes like: chown: /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.8' not found (required by /lib/libselinux.so.1)
2008-11-14T03:13:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	is the libc missing, or is it only missing in the initrd/because of an empty initrd?
2008-11-14T03:14:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	you can also download the libc-package and install it from the live cd with some of these dpkg-* command
2008-11-14T03:15:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	those would be different issues. but libc is here
2008-11-14T03:16:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	I'd like to solve the initrd issue first.
2008-11-14T03:41:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	after getting my encrypted partitions to mount from the livecd, chroot doesn't work. every command just throws /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.8' not found (required by /lib/libselinux.so.1)
2008-11-14T03:42:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	I guess I may try to just copy all files belonging to libc package from the livecd to the harddrive
2008-11-14T03:42:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	you should do something similar to that:
2008-11-14T03:43:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	one moment....
2008-11-14T03:45:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	load the libc-ubuntu-package file (.deb), and then install it with: dpkg --root=/mnt/myharddisc -i libcxxxx.deb
2008-11-14T03:45:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	maybe that's it. but maybe more is broken. then it could get much work, where a clean installation might be better
2008-11-14T03:46:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	yes. I keep my home partition separate, so if it wouldn't work by 1:30 AM I'm opting to just press the Install button
2008-11-14T03:47:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	ok, good luck ;-)
2008-11-14T03:47:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	even if the update failed horribly, I doubt any other OS would let me do the reinstall that easily
2008-11-14T03:51:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	Great! I can now chroot into the new environment
2008-11-14T03:52:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	that's fine :-)
2008-11-14T03:53:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	but 'update-initramfs -c -k all' updated only the old kernel from 8.04.. that's weird
2008-11-14T03:55:00.000Z	oskar-	sliwowitz	hm, try to install the kernel package of 8.10, apt-get install linux-image   (?)  sorry, i must leave. nearly midnight for me here ;) gn8
2008-11-14T03:56:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	it's near midnight here as well
2008-11-14T03:56:00.000Z	sliwowitz	oskar-	Thanks for your help. I guess I'll make it from here
