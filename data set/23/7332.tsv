2005-09-01T06:03:00.000Z	Shefa		Hello everybody
2005-09-01T06:04:00.000Z	Shefa		I have a huge problem. My Ubuntu was loading up, and the power went out. After it came up again, i started Ubuntu again, but after it loaded everything, the screen went black(it is write before the login screen). What should I do
2005-09-01T06:05:00.000Z	Shefa		I wuold appreciate any help. Is there anything like Mandrake, to check the file system, or something like scandisk
2005-09-01T06:06:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	can you hit <ctrl-alt-f3> and log in?
2005-09-01T06:07:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	so hitting ctrl-alt-f3 does nothing?
2005-09-01T06:08:00.000Z	Shefa	nalioth	Nothing, absolutly nothing
2005-09-01T06:09:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	do as cafuego and LasseL have advised
2005-09-01T06:28:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	did you choose the rescue option at the boot prompt?
2005-09-01T06:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	the rescue option
2005-09-01T06:30:00.000Z	Shefa	nalioth	I don't have that option. I only have 1. The boot, 2. Rescu, 3.My other OS
2005-09-01T06:31:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	choose rescue and run fsck
2005-09-01T06:33:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	File System ChecK
2005-09-01T06:34:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	ncp meant an nfs server, not your box
2005-09-01T06:34:00.000Z	Shefa	nalioth	when Ubuntu is loading, it is checking the file system and it gives me no errors
2005-09-01T06:36:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	do you have a liveCD?
2005-09-01T06:37:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	if you type the first letters of some1s nickname, and hit <tab> it will autocomplete
2005-09-01T06:38:00.000Z	Shefa	nalioth	thanks-good trick
2005-09-01T08:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	you installed "ubuntu-desktop"?
2005-09-01T08:05:00.000Z	Shefa	nalioth	yap I did-it said that everything went fine. It's just that it takes a while(extremly slow) just to load up the outlines of the desktop itself(about an hour)
2005-09-01T08:06:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	try installing "kubuntu-desktop" and see if you can log into that quicker
2005-09-01T08:07:00.000Z	Shefa	nalioth	I already did that-befor i did it, i didn't even get the log in screen. After i installed it, it started to do, what i explained earlier
2005-09-01T08:07:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	and as dabar says, deleting everything in your /tmp won't hurt anything
2005-09-01T08:08:00.000Z	nalioth	Shefa	i'm pretty lost at this point
