2011-09-06T23:02:00.000Z	pr0ton		why doesnt this work? find . -name "*.info"
2011-09-06T23:02:00.000Z	pr0ton		i want to search for files with a .info extension?
2011-09-06T23:03:00.000Z	pr0ton		doesnt work
2011-09-06T23:04:00.000Z	pr0ton		the files are actually just .info
2011-09-06T23:04:00.000Z	pr0ton		they're not like, a.info or anything
2011-09-06T23:04:00.000Z	pr0ton		maybe ubuntu hides files with a . as first character?
2011-09-06T23:06:00.000Z	pr0ton		no, u said, "* will include hidden files"
2011-09-06T23:06:00.000Z	pr0ton		touch creates a file
2011-09-06T23:07:00.000Z	pr0ton		?
2011-09-06T23:07:00.000Z	mkanyicy	pr0ton	your find syntax was OK
2011-09-06T23:08:00.000Z	pr0ton	mkanyicy	it doesnt show .info files though
2011-09-06T23:08:00.000Z	pr0ton		yes
2011-09-06T23:08:00.000Z	pr0ton		they're in a symlinked folder though
2011-09-06T23:08:00.000Z	pr0ton		however when i checked for json
2011-09-06T23:08:00.000Z	pr0ton		it showed my json files under the symlinked directory
2011-09-06T23:09:00.000Z	pr0ton		so i cd'd and ran it
2011-09-06T23:09:00.000Z	pr0ton		it worked
2011-09-06T23:09:00.000Z	pr0ton		just read man pages
2011-09-06T23:09:00.000Z	pr0ton		i need to add a -H or something
2011-09-06T23:09:00.000Z	mkanyicy	pr0ton	try this: 'find . -type f | grep .info'
2011-09-06T23:11:00.000Z	mkanyicy	pr0ton	that should definitely work if you have .info files in your 'pwd'
2011-09-06T23:11:00.000Z	pr0ton	mkanyicy	ok, i fixed it... thanks a lot
2011-09-06T23:11:00.000Z	mkanyicy	pr0ton	ok
