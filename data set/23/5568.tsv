2006-11-19T11:25:00.000Z	kkrusty		is there a console email client preinstalled with kubuntu edgy?
2006-11-19T11:25:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	probably 'mail' though 'mutt' would be what I would recommend
2006-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	just do  'sudo apt-get install mutt'
2006-11-19T11:30:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	does mutt work with http proxies?
2006-11-19T11:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	not sure, I use it for local spools and imaps
2006-11-19T11:53:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	do you have any idea regarding beryl on kubuntu?
2006-11-19T11:53:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	if your title bars disappear, it means the window manager has crashed
2006-11-19T11:54:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	so what can i do to help that?
2006-11-19T11:54:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	try restarting beryl again by clicking on the ruby and selecting beryl as the window manager or the reload window manager option
2006-11-19T11:54:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	beryl is quite unstable, it works well on some of my systems and not so well on others
2006-11-19T11:54:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	ultimately, you may need to just not run it until it develops further
2006-11-19T11:55:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	tried that didnt work
2006-11-19T11:55:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	what video card are you running?
2006-11-19T11:55:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	it really only works well with ATi or Nvidia from what I've read
2006-11-19T11:55:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	geforce4 4400 Go
2006-11-19T11:56:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	k, not sure, it's just fairly buggy
2006-11-19T11:56:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	running Edgy or Dapper?
2006-11-19T11:56:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	yeah i was guessing that its not in great shape yet. I tried xgl earlier and it looked pretty cool on my old computer.
2006-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	seems to be a bit better on my Edgy systems
2006-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	but it's not exactly rock solid
2006-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	im running kubuntu edgy
2006-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	kkrusty	yeah, dunno what to tell you other than keep playing with it or give it up , I've done a bit of both on varying systems
2006-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	kkrusty	Kingsqueak	but im considering switching back to ubuntu 6,06
