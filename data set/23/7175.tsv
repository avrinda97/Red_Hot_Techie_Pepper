2005-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	LasseL		I manually built the ati module and installed the driver ati driver from the web. Now I want to get rid of it, but when I try to apt-get remove xorg-driver-fglrx I get an error saying something about a diversion from one lib file to another
2005-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	if you installed manually, you must remove manually, too.
2005-11-27T09:08:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	regarding file diversion errors, have a look at man dpkg-divert
2005-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	I think the trouble is that what I manually intalled overwrote the xorg-driver-fglrx package
2005-11-27T09:11:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	have you tried 'apt-get --reinstall install xorg-driver-fglrx' ?
2005-11-27T09:12:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	I want to get rid of everything fglrx, I upgraded to a nvidia card
2005-11-27T09:13:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	reinstalling may fix it so you can cleanly uninstall afterwards.
2005-11-27T09:13:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	I can see that dpkg-divert has a number of diverted files listed on the fglrx package, could you hint me how to remove the diversions?
2005-11-27T09:14:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	dpkg-divert [options]  --remove <file> ?
2005-11-27T09:15:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	aye, I am just lazy, there is 20 files
2005-11-27T09:16:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	do it with a bash script: for i in $( <list> ) ; do dpkg-divert --remove $i ; done
2005-11-27T09:16:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	<list> is whatever you did to list the 20 files.
2005-11-27T09:17:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	disclaimer: if that screws up your system, you cannot sue me :)
2005-11-27T09:22:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	I manually removed all but one diversion, which it refuses to remove
2005-11-27T09:24:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	can you reinstall or remove the package now?
2005-11-27T09:25:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	no, it still complains that it can't remove the xorg-driver-fglrx driver b/c of the diversion it can't remove
2005-11-27T09:26:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	does it say why it cannot remove the diversion?
2005-11-27T09:27:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	because it would require it to overwrite a file
2005-11-27T09:27:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	and can you rm that file?
2005-11-27T09:30:00.000Z	LasseL	soundray	renaming the file, removing the diversion, copied it back, installed the package, thanks a bunch for the help
2005-11-27T09:30:00.000Z	soundray	LasseL	glad it worked.
