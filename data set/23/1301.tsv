2010-10-22T03:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	FYI i have also experienced issues with sound and multiple virtual consoles/X sessions.  in fact the problem has gotten a lot worse in the last few versions of ?X/Pulse/audio/GDM/Gnome (not really sure where the problem comes from?).  good luck man.
2010-10-22T03:10:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	it even was not a problem before. i think somewhere i did something wrong. i changed so mayn things. i don't think i can recover all steps i did.
2010-10-22T03:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	lol - BEEN THERE!
2010-10-22T03:11:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	?
2010-10-22T03:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	so many times I can't "undo" all the steps I have done to something and broken it.
2010-10-22T03:13:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	hm, i could your line a lyrics for a song ;P
2010-10-22T03:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	if you're using fluxbox only - then pulse is not a factor.  consider this however, alsa doesn't share audio as well as pulse.
2010-10-22T03:14:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	i am sure i didnt mess with sound stuff.
2010-10-22T03:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	try running "pasuspender firefox" to disable pulse for firefox and test if that works.
2010-10-22T03:22:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	it is not only FF it is the whole thing
2010-10-22T03:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	try running "pasuspender firefox" to disable pulse for firefox and test if that works.
2010-10-22T03:39:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	i had it on the system while i had all these troubles
2010-10-22T03:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	lol - thank you Pulse
2010-10-22T03:38:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	pulse was not installed.
2010-10-22T03:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	with ubuntu-desktop it was
2010-10-22T03:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	pulse is part of the "default" ubuntu-desktop package, i don't know why installing it would solve the problem (doesn't make a lot of sense, you might want to keep testing to verify)
2010-10-22T03:44:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	the packages i stalled were 3 packages that have screensaver in their name. nothing about sond. anyway. it works :D thank you & bye
2010-10-22T03:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	enjoy ubuntu.
2011-06-25T04:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	there is little to NO way to run Mac software on GNU/Linux - you'll have MUCH more luck running MS software

2011-06-26T06:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Benkinooby	you could research ppa-purge (I've never used it, so can't really comment on its function) to remove the PPA stuff.
2011-06-26T06:45:00.000Z	Benkinooby	ZykoticK9	ok, thak you for the hint! appreciate it
