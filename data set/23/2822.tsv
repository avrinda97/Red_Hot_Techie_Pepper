2008-11-28T22:36:00.000Z	salmon		hey is there a way to make a file to only have access by password??
2008-11-28T22:37:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	its possible using cryptography
2008-11-28T22:40:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	you need generate a gnupg key with the commando ssh-keygen, then you use the gpg command with the option -e to encrypt the archive
2008-11-28T22:41:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	ok that sounds a bit above my current skill with this OS lol but thank you anyway
2008-11-28T22:43:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	other way is click with the right botton of mouse in the archive and choose encrytp :)
2008-11-28T22:44:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	lol that is too easy lol, thank you
2008-11-28T22:44:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	first the complicated way... :)
2008-11-28T22:45:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	so after i have the "chose recipents" menu up whats the next step... noob at this i know
2008-11-28T22:47:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	in the recipients, has you ?
2008-11-28T22:48:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	well i only have one user on here, the menu is blank... a lot of people use my p.c. and i just want to lock a file
2008-11-28T22:49:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	so, first you need to Application -> Accessories -> Passwords and encryption keys, click on file -> create new
2008-11-28T22:51:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	done, now it gives me the option for two file types,,, which one do i want??
2008-11-28T22:51:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	anyone, doesnt matter :)
2008-11-28T22:52:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	sorry
2008-11-28T22:52:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	chose pgp
2008-11-28T22:53:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	ok but it wants e-mail info will that matter in the long run?
2008-11-28T22:53:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	yes, is very important provide the email
2008-11-28T22:54:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	after you do this, you be able to send encrypt email :)
2008-11-28T22:56:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	ok so now im a little confused... all i really want to do is make a folder only able to be accesed via password
2008-11-28T22:56:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	forget the email, the objective is put a password into your file / directory
2008-11-28T22:58:00.000Z	salmon	astor-brazil	uhhh.... to be honest im really new at this.. where do i go to do this
2008-11-28T22:58:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	when you finish this step, just click with the right botton and chose encrypt
2008-11-28T22:58:00.000Z	astor-brazil	salmon	thats all
