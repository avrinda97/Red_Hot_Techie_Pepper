2012-01-15T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	there are browser addons and extensions for downloading youtube
2012-01-20T04:27:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	How can I remote connect to my server without using ssh ?
2012-01-20T04:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	depends what you want to do..
2012-01-20T04:29:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	See the desktop of my dedicated server etc. I know how to setup ssh connection.
2012-01-20T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	but what do you do on the server, what tasks?
2012-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	Hosting, Broadcasting TV etc
2012-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	if the tv hosting only has a GUI interface then you could use vnc through an ssh tunnel
2012-01-20T04:33:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	Interesting. And if it has not GUI interface install it and connect the way you said.
2012-04-01T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	not very secure....
2012-04-01T19:11:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	Folders 755 and files 644 is not secure?
2012-04-01T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	the 4s and 5s are fine, 7s can be dodgey especially how weak ftp is with security
2012-05-14T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	ps -ef | grep -i cron
2012-05-14T00:27:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	Okay it seems that is running. But still I cannot see the Traffic usage of my server. The server is running plesk.
2012-05-14T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	could use ntop
2012-05-14T00:29:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	But if i install ntop i will only able to see the traffic through putty? i need to show the traffic in the server interface.
2012-05-14T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	ntop watches the interface itself
2012-05-14T00:30:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	So if i install ntop. The traffic ussage will start working in the userface are well?
2012-05-14T00:35:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	ntop by default use 3000 port to display network usage via webbrowser. I used this command netstat -tulpn | grep :3000 and nothing happened. any ideas?
2012-05-14T00:40:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	ntop by default use 3000 port to display network usage via webbrowser. I used this command netstat -tulpn | grep :3000 and nothing happened. any ideas?
2012-05-14T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pambos	is your interface called eth0?
2012-05-14T00:50:00.000Z	pambos	ActionParsnip	I have no idea. it is a vps server.
