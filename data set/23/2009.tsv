2010-06-28T08:36:00.000Z	edbian	trism	There has got to be a lower level tool but I will check that out :)
2010-06-28T08:38:00.000Z	edbian	trism	There has got to be a lower level tool but I will check that out :)
2010-06-28T08:39:00.000Z	trism	edbian	I'm not sure how you would get lower level, unless you were looking to write your own code for it (which is actually pretty straightforward too)
2010-06-28T08:40:00.000Z	edbian	trism	The man page for xodtools even says "written using xtest and xlib libraries.
2010-06-28T08:40:00.000Z	trism	edbian	yes, you can write you own code using those libraries, but that isn't really what you asked
2010-06-28T08:41:00.000Z	edbian	trism	true :)  I think I will write my own program though :)
2010-08-20T23:35:00.000Z	edbian	trism	Do you think something in robots.txt is blocking wget from retrieving the entire thing?
2010-08-20T23:36:00.000Z	trism	edbian	and yes, the Disallow: /~ is what was blocking it, since all the files were in a user directory
2011-02-02T02:21:00.000Z	edbian	trism	lahwran I did not know that!
2011-03-19T00:47:00.000Z	trism	edbian	me too, do you have a more specific command?
2011-03-19T00:52:00.000Z	edbian	trism	Am I going crazy?!
2011-03-19T00:53:00.000Z	trism	edbian	you have an X on your bubble, are you using a modified notify-osd? (or a different notification daemon)
2011-03-19T00:53:00.000Z	edbian	trism	It's actually Debian.  But the same thing happens on my local machine
2011-03-19T00:58:00.000Z	trism	edbian	I was only asking because notify-osd doesn't have an option for a close button that I am aware of, so maybe it is a bug specific to the notification daemon you're running (modified notify-osd or notification-daemon or something else)
2011-03-19T00:59:00.000Z	edbian	trism	figured it out.  it's html  &amp;  works
2011-03-19T01:02:00.000Z	trism	edbian	I see, probably using a label with formatted text, still seems like a bug though, it should escape & that aren't part of entities
2011-03-19T01:02:00.000Z	edbian	trism	you'd think
2011-06-07T00:01:00.000Z	trism	edbian	bash needs to read the script file to execute it
2011-06-07T00:01:00.000Z	edbian	trism	Never knew that!
2011-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	trism	edbian	gnome-terminal -x bash -c 'echo "
2011-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	trism	edbian	gnome-terminal -x bash -c 'echo "hello"; read -p "Press enter to continue"'
2011-06-14T06:44:00.000Z	edbian	trism	qin Got it.  Thank you!
