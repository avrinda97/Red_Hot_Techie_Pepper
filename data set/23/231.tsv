2012-03-07T03:33:00.000Z	cweagans		if I was going to install Ubuntu on my macbook pro, should I use x86 or amd64?
2012-03-07T03:34:00.000Z	newtony2	cweagans	 depends on what processor you have
2012-03-07T03:34:00.000Z	newtony2		click the apple in the top left hand corner and goto about this mac
2012-03-07T03:34:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	i have intel core i7
2012-03-07T03:35:00.000Z	newtony2		then use the x86
2012-03-07T03:35:00.000Z	newtony2		unless you have a 64bit i7
2012-03-07T03:35:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	it's 64bit - I'm running Lion right now, which is 64 bit only
2012-03-07T03:35:00.000Z	cweagans		iirc
2012-03-07T03:36:00.000Z	newtony2	cweagans	 i would test the amd64 ver but it may be buggy. if it is then use the x86
2012-03-07T03:37:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	will I get any extra benefit if I use the 64bit version?
2012-03-07T03:39:00.000Z	newtony2		the benefits of using using your processor to its full potential
2012-03-07T03:40:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	well yeah, but I'm just going to be using it for SSH, vim, and a handful of browsers
2012-03-07T03:41:00.000Z	newtony2		ok sorry
2012-03-07T03:41:00.000Z	newtony2	cweagans	what was the last msg you sent
2012-03-07T03:42:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	well yeah, but I'm just going to be using it for SSH, vim, and a handful of browsers
2012-03-07T03:43:00.000Z	newtony2		well then really its up to you.
2012-03-07T03:43:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	why would the 64bit version be buggy?
2012-03-07T03:46:00.000Z	newtony2		well sometimes like on the acre 5135 the device bus is actually reported wrong to macosx86. you are trying to use ubuntu on a machine that is only supposed to use macos. eventhough it is an intel mac somethings just MAY not work without some work on your part
2012-03-07T03:47:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	ah, i see. okay
2012-03-07T03:47:00.000Z	cweagans		I think i'll give the 64bit version a try
2012-03-07T03:47:00.000Z	cweagans		thanks!
2012-03-07T03:48:00.000Z	newtony2		np enjoy and please tell me about your exp
2012-03-07T03:49:00.000Z	cweagans	newtony2	will do. thanks again!
