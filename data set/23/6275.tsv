2006-06-25T09:26:00.000Z	gdb		You do not want to use the -d flag.
2006-06-25T09:26:00.000Z	gdb		No, read what it says.
2006-06-25T09:26:00.000Z	gdb		You do not want the -d flag.
2006-06-25T09:26:00.000Z	gdb		You're not interested in the "latest development version" like it just said.
2006-06-25T09:26:00.000Z	gdb		You want the latest stable version. :-)
2006-06-25T09:26:00.000Z	gdb		update-manager will provide the option to upgrade to the next stable version if you run it.
2006-06-25T09:27:00.000Z	gdb		System -> Administration -> Update  Manager
2006-06-25T09:27:00.000Z	gdb		$ mv directory1 directory2 will leave you with directory1/directory2

2006-06-27T06:15:00.000Z	__mikem	gdb	OSX uses freebsd as its core, it has a layer ontop of it that hides all the "unix ugliness"
2006-06-30T08:31:00.000Z	gdb	__mikem	debian based distros are more numerous, rpm based distros are more widely installed
2006-06-30T08:31:00.000Z	__mikem	gdb	thats weird
2006-06-30T08:32:00.000Z	gdb	__mikem	Well, it's mostly due to the success of Red Hat.  Personally, I fled Fedora (which i still consider good software) for Ubuntu.
2006-06-30T08:32:00.000Z	gdb	__mikem	I've been using Linux since 1994, first with Slackware, then Red Hat, a couple years of NetBSD, back to Red Hat, then Fedora, and now Ubuntu.
2006-06-30T08:34:00.000Z	__mikem	gdb	the definition of ubuntu very closely corolates with the principles of open source, thats why they chose it.
2006-06-30T08:34:00.000Z	gdb	__mikem	Yes, I realize that.
2006-06-30T08:44:00.000Z	__mikem	gdb	lol
2006-06-30T08:47:00.000Z	__mikem	gdb	why do people continue to leave and enter like they are getting paid for every reentry into this room
2006-06-30T08:47:00.000Z	gdb	__mikem	If you're asking me, I swapped from irssi (what I use at work) to xchat (what I prefer at home).
2006-06-30T08:58:00.000Z	__mikem	gdb	he said he has no internet access
2006-06-30T08:58:00.000Z	gdb	__mikem	He said he couldn't launch the CD which is not something that requires Internet access.
