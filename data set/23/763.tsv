2011-02-20T04:19:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	I have used Evolution for many years. I like it alot.
2011-02-20T04:20:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	It seems a fairly comprehensive and powerful organiser. Does it have any interesting functionalities?
2011-02-20T04:21:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	Scheduling, ad integration, alerts and whatnot. Try it.
2011-02-20T04:22:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	Will do. What about push email?
2011-02-20T04:22:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	Or is that just a standard function of IMAP?
2011-02-20T04:23:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	No, i dont think so. And really, thats as bad as web-search-as-you-type :)
2011-02-20T04:23:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	IE. System overload
2011-02-20T04:24:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	Yeah, I hate it for work emails... but personal ones (which are much less in volume) are nice to get immediately. Guess one could just overcome that by changing the mail check frequency.
2011-02-20T04:25:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	I just set it to poll every 10 minutes or so. Works nicely. It can handle all kinds of encryptions so ive not seen an isp that it has any issues with.
2011-02-20T04:28:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	Heres hot to AD: http://mange.dynalias.org/linux/misc/Novell_Evolution
2011-02-20T04:28:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	HowTo :)
2011-02-20T04:28:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	Ah, thanks for that
2011-02-20T04:28:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	Np!
2011-02-20T04:31:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	I have used it alot on a few dists, upgraded dists about 15 times and its pretty solid. Sometimes itll say that this and that will change or something but all my datas are intact since about year 2000 or so.
2011-02-20T04:32:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	Wow, that's pretty impressive.
2011-02-20T04:32:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	I don't mind accessing Gmail via the net, but sometimes it's nice to just have stuff on the PC
2011-02-20T04:34:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	I thnk that program also has gmail integration. Edit->Plugins and see if its in there.
2011-02-20T04:34:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	It could also be an addon module
2011-02-20T04:35:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	It's not in the list; I'll look for it online.
2011-02-20T04:35:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	Do that.
2011-02-20T04:36:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	Nice talking to you btw. Have a great time!
2011-02-20T04:37:00.000Z	AegisX	pebblix	Same to you! Thanks :)
2011-02-20T04:37:00.000Z	pebblix	AegisX	Np!
