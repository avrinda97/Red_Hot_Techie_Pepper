2006-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	lovloss		is ubuntu's "wine" package the most up to date, or do i need to build it from source?
2006-12-18T07:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	lovloss	winehq provides its own repos with the latest build
2006-12-18T07:19:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	lovloss	are you sure it isnt integrated already?
2006-12-18T07:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	lovloss	have you enabled third party repos?
2006-12-18T07:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	lovloss	then they might not authenticate themselves. just disregard that error message
2006-12-18T07:27:00.000Z	lovloss	nolimitsoya	But its not updating
2006-12-18T07:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	lovloss	you are updated. run 'sudo apt-get update' and youll see
2006-12-18T07:31:00.000Z	lovloss	nolimitsoya	Every time i do that it runs through a TON of wine files, then stops and says it cant proceed because no public key is available
2006-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	lovloss	yes, and i told you to dissregard that message and just run apt-get install win
