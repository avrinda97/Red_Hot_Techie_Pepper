2006-08-16T12:33:00.000Z	LJHarb		nick, there was nothing about a screen password in man passwd
2006-08-16T12:33:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 Are you specifically referring to screen?  If so, there is an option for establishing password protected screen sessions using, 'acladd.'  "man screen" has tons of info... perhaps too much :-)
2006-08-16T12:34:00.000Z	LJHarb		yes
2006-08-16T12:34:00.000Z	LJHarb		lol k
2006-08-16T12:34:00.000Z	LJHarb		can it be summarized?
2006-08-16T12:34:00.000Z	LJHarb		ok to rephrase, i want a way to share a screen with another user so that they can watch me perform tasks, without knowing their unix password
2006-08-16T12:35:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 I use screen on my headless server but I never bother with password protecting the detached screens simply because I'm the only one that logs into the server.
2006-08-16T12:35:00.000Z	LJHarb		hm
2006-08-16T12:35:00.000Z	LJHarb		rob: how can i connect to a detached screen of a diff user tho?
2006-08-16T12:35:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 One sec...
2006-08-16T12:35:00.000Z	LJHarb		thanks
2006-08-16T12:36:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 screen -r sessionowner/[[pid.] tty[.host] ] 
2006-08-16T12:36:00.000Z	LJHarb		nick, thanks
2006-08-16T12:36:00.000Z	LJHarb	rob_p	lemme try that
2006-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 So is suppose that, 'screen -r <username>' should re-attach to the default screen initiated by that user.
2006-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	LJHarb		hm k
2006-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 I meant, "So I suppose..." but you get the picture  :-)
2006-08-16T12:38:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 Very late... very tired!
2006-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 If the user has more than one screen detached, then I believe it will re-attach to the first one.  If you want a specific one, you'd need to specify the tty, I think.
2006-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	LJHarb	rob_p	i think its working... but the other user had to explicitly give me privs to do it, turning on multiuser mode or something
2006-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 Hmm, well, like I said,  I haven't done much in the way of multi-user screen sessions, etc.
2006-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	LJHarb		thanks :-)
2006-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	rob_p	LJHarb	 welcome
