2005-09-19T07:58:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem		What's a good minimal IRC client that will let me have transparent backgrounds?
2005-09-19T07:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	irssi
2005-10-02T07:09:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	HrdwrBoB	doesn't that only show ports that are in use?
2005-10-02T07:09:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	er
2005-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	outgoing ports are only open if they are in use
2005-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	there is no 'firewall'
2005-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	you can connect to anything
2005-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	HrdwrBoB	There is on these machines :-P
2005-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	well them you have added it
2005-10-02T07:11:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	HrdwrBoB	I didn't, someone else did. :-P
2005-10-02T07:11:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	then talk to them
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	no, it can't
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	HrdwrBoB	Is there an program that can?
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	you really don't understand what you are playing with
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	HrdwrBoB	I don't?
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	you need to do more research on how connections work
2005-10-02T07:13:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	in order to make a connection on a port externally there has to be something listening
2005-10-02T07:13:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	HrdwrBoB	Right.
2005-10-02T07:14:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	that's *not* the way to do it
2005-10-02T07:14:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	you really need to understand what you're doing
2005-10-02T07:22:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	ping is icmp and doesn't use ports
2005-10-02T07:22:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	and if you are testing a specific range, then yes
2005-10-02T07:23:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Carpe_Libertatem	outgoing port filtering is mostly annoying and pointless
