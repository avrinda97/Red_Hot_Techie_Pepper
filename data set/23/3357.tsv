2008-05-07T07:56:00.000Z	kuahara		now parted magic sees the same partition and says that 124GB is free
2008-05-07T07:56:00.000Z	kuahara		there was more than 80GB used before this started
2008-05-07T07:56:00.000Z	kuahara		thats the story from beginning to end.  It was originally a NTFS formatted partition
2008-05-07T07:57:00.000Z	kuahara		I tried to mount this partition on media/sda5, it says it can't mount it
2008-05-07T07:58:00.000Z	kuahara		karc, that site is in a language I can not read
2008-05-07T08:00:00.000Z	kuahara		Simpler Question:   Is there a way to restore a partition back to the way it was -yesterday-???
2008-05-07T08:01:00.000Z	kuahara		god, who do I have to order a pizza for to get some help with this
2008-05-07T08:02:00.000Z	kuahara		someone recommended parted magic under the pretense that it can 'restore' partitions back to the way they were.  So far as I can tell, this is not true
2008-05-07T08:03:00.000Z	kuahara		I'll paypal someone $10 right now if someone can explain to me how to fix this in a PM or something
2008-05-07T08:04:00.000Z	kuahara		it probably won't buy you a gallon of gas by tomorrow morning, but oh well
2008-05-07T08:04:00.000Z	thechris	kuahara	what did you break?
2008-05-07T08:05:00.000Z	kuahara	thechris	I deleted a partition and it somehow changed in size.  From 127GB to 8MB.
2008-05-07T08:05:00.000Z	kuahara	thechris	I also loaded ubuntu livecd and force mounted the 2nd 127GB partition
2008-05-07T08:05:00.000Z	thechris	kuahara	if you've not done any writes you can get the data back
2008-05-07T08:06:00.000Z	kuahara	thechris	so I'm told.  But no one can say how.  Someone recommended parted magic and said it could do the job.  But it appears it can not
2008-05-07T08:06:00.000Z	thechris	kuahara	you might want to make an exact image of the better part of the drive though.
2008-05-07T08:06:00.000Z	thechris	kuahara	you just have to put the partition table back to the correct size, or possibly something larger
2008-05-07T08:07:00.000Z	kuahara	thechris	do I just select the ntfs partition and resize?
2008-05-07T08:07:00.000Z	kuahara	thechris	can I PM you
2008-05-07T08:08:00.000Z	thechris	kuahara	i think so
2008-05-07T08:16:00.000Z	thechris	kuahara	do you have enough space to backup the raw data on the disk?
2008-05-07T08:18:00.000Z	kuahara	thechris	there is 80GB of data I am trying to recover.  The hdd has plenty of space.  cd's do not
2008-05-07T08:21:00.000Z	thechris	kuahara	well you might use dd or another imaging software to make a backup.  from there you can try to get the data back.  I'm not sure on how NTFS works.  either way you don't want to accidently corrupt things.
