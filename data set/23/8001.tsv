2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	vixus		I need an ID3 tag editor for linux.
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	vixus		Cause rhythmbox is stupidly case-sensitive.
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	try madman
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	madman has a great tag editing feature, but its also great as a search/jukebox and works great with xmms
2005-02-24T09:13:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	well, it does alot more than just tag editing
2005-02-24T09:13:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	you looked at the site?
2005-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	yes, you can edit the id3 tags in xmms
2005-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	its not the easiest way to do it, but you can
2005-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	its kind of clunky
2005-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	yea, you might. I just looked at it and the interface looks a whole lot better than doing it through xmms
2005-02-24T09:21:00.000Z	vixus	Drizzt321	I thought I could batch them! :|
2005-02-24T09:22:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	ah...you can do that retag change thing in madman. not sure what else might have it, I haven't investigated that
2005-02-24T09:26:00.000Z	vixus	Drizzt321	use the Scanner in easytag.
2005-02-24T09:26:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	ok :) glad to hear it
2005-02-24T09:26:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	um...I wish I had some bluetooth. if you send me it I'll figure it out for you ;)
2005-02-24T09:27:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	go to google and search
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	vixus	Drizzt321	I need glibc-2.0 for libbonobo.
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	?
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	vixus	Drizzt321	any idea what I need to apt-get?
2005-02-24T10:13:00.000Z	vixus	Drizzt321	trying to compile Blue Remote :D
2005-02-24T10:13:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	not sure, I think 2.0 is probably in experimental...there might be a backport of it though, not really sure where you'd get a .deb of it though, sorry
2005-02-24T10:17:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	ahh...yea, thats a bit different then glibc
2005-02-24T10:17:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	ignore him, he's trolling
