2006-08-21T08:51:00.000Z	qid		anyone know how to install a theme for gnome? one comment said to put the folder in ~/.themes/ but that doesn't seem to have worked
2006-08-21T08:51:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	drag the tar into the theme list
2006-08-21T08:51:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	it will install itself
2006-08-21T08:52:00.000Z	qid		it just says the file format is invalid
2006-08-21T08:52:00.000Z	qid		http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/32162210/ <-- this is the theme
2006-08-21T08:52:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	are you extracting the file before you drag stuff in there?
2006-08-21T08:53:00.000Z	qid		I tried both methods
2006-08-21T08:54:00.000Z	qid		the theme zip contains a folder that looks like the gnome theme and another folder that looks like a winamp theme
2006-08-21T08:54:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	DON'T unzip the theme you download.
2006-08-21T08:55:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	just drag the archive you downloaded into the list
2006-08-21T08:55:00.000Z	qid	shawnrgr_	22:52 < qid> it just says the file format is invalid
2006-08-21T08:55:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	what site
2006-08-21T08:55:00.000Z	qid	shawnrgr_	22:52 < qid> http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/32162210/ <-- this is the theme
2006-08-21T08:57:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	unzip the file, and re-archive it with .tar.gz
2006-08-21T08:58:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	thats a .zip extension... don't think that will work... just rezip it
2006-08-21T09:00:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	no i just tried it... didn't work. but there is another zip in there, you might have to re archive that as well
2006-08-21T09:00:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	if not... i would just goto gnome-look.org to get your themes... or install compiz ;p
2006-08-21T09:02:00.000Z	qid	shawnrgr_	actually, it worked for me, it showed up under the Theme Details button
2006-08-21T09:02:00.000Z	qid		thanks
2006-08-21T09:03:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	good
2006-08-21T09:03:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	np
2006-08-21T09:03:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	but i highly suggest using gnome-look.org instead. you know they will work... although there are some awsome stuff on deviant-art
2006-08-21T09:05:00.000Z	shawnrgr_	qid	wow deviantart changed there site layout and stuff... very nice.. much better
