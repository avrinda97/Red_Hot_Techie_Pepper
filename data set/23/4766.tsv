2008-05-12T12:31:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk		heya, since i upgraded to heron my dialog boxes (e.g. password dialog for thunderbird) always open up maximised - any ideas why?
2008-05-12T12:31:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	do all windows do that? are you using compiz?
2008-05-12T12:32:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	yes, using compiz. no, my terminal windows don't open like that (gnome-terminal)
2008-05-12T12:32:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	check ccsm > Window Placement > Placement Mode
2008-05-12T12:32:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	make sure it's not on "Maximized"
2008-05-12T12:46:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	on Maximised where? sorry, closed xchat since each time i switch windows it seems to refuse keyboard focus :P
2008-05-12T12:50:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	oh, are you sure you have a window manager running at all?
2008-05-12T12:51:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	lol, yeah, compiz is running, and I can see its settings
2008-05-12T12:52:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	you see fade effects when you click on menus?
2008-05-12T12:52:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	nope
2008-05-12T12:52:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	does windows key + E do anything?
2008-05-12T12:53:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	no, but that might be because i've remapped the windows key with xmodmap
2008-05-12T12:53:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	you have titlebars on your windows?
2008-05-12T12:53:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	yes. seriously, i'm running compiz. ps ax |grep compiz shows that
2008-05-12T12:54:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	lol just making sure; windows not getting keyboard focus almost always means there's no WM running :)
2008-05-12T12:54:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	the setting I wanted you to check was Place Windows > Placement Mode
2008-05-12T12:55:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	actually its worse than that. from time to time when i switch desktops the windows are actually frozen in some way - then when i minimize and maximise again suddenly everything works (and i see all the chat on #ubuntu)
2008-05-12T12:55:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	placement mode: smart ?
2008-05-12T12:56:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	ahh, are you using any unofficial plugins? that's usually caused by buggy plugins that don't damage windows enough
2008-05-12T12:57:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	just the normal plugins and the compiz-fusion-plugins
2008-05-12T12:58:00.000Z	crdlb	pvh_sa|wrk	hmm, it might be one of them then, but it's unlikely
2008-05-12T12:59:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	thanks though - i'll try and pin down exactly when this happens
2008-05-12T13:00:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	crdlb	i wonder if its something grabbing focus. like k3b - which has been acting odd for me
