2007-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	neverblue		so my question was, do I need to make a new <vh>, or just use the current one, to point to my users /home/public_html
2007-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	neverblue		so add a new <directory>
2007-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	neverblue		does apache2 on ubuntu need to use both apache.conf and httpd.conf?
2007-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	i dont think it uses httpd.conf
2007-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	actually i may be wrong ... i do have one
2007-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	there is a note in my httpd.conf that says it is there for backwards compatabilyt blah blah
2007-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	bakert		What would you do first if your sound stopped working?
2007-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	neverblue		then i wonder why my new install doesnt create a "skeleton" httpd.conf?
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	did for me
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	neverblue		this is very odd
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	but that was dapper
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	neverblue		can I get it from your bakert ?
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	let me check my feisty machine
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	neverblue		thanks
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	neverblue		make sure its apache2 as well
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	yep same thing there.  download it from http://bluebones.net/httpd.conf but wait ten secs while i put it there!
2007-05-03T12:52:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	ok it's there
2007-05-03T12:52:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	i can't imagine what it would do, though
2007-05-03T12:53:00.000Z	bakert		If you haven't got any sound, but it worked a few days ago, what would you try?
2007-05-03T12:54:00.000Z	neverblue	bakert	is it just me, or is it only 4-5 lines?
2007-05-03T12:55:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	that's right - just comments!
2007-05-03T12:55:00.000Z	bakert	neverblue	i don't see how it can be crucial to anything.  what's the problem you are having?
2007-05-03T12:55:00.000Z	neverblue	bakert	well, i had to remove/reinstall apache, just ironing out the issues
