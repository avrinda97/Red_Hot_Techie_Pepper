2008-06-29T01:43:00.000Z	cbones		what path do i need to use
2008-06-29T01:44:00.000Z	unop	cbones	it really depends on the module -- most times the path is hard-coded into the module -- doesn't the documentation for whatever you are installing say anything about the firmware path?
2008-06-29T01:46:00.000Z	unop	cbones	i would say, use /lib/firmware
2008-06-29T01:48:00.000Z	unop	cbones	ok, what am i looking for here?
2008-06-29T01:49:00.000Z	unop	cbones	well, the script looks ok -- is something going wrong?
2008-06-29T01:51:00.000Z	unop	cbones	after you install the firmware and reload bcm43xx module -- does your wireless interface come up?
2008-06-29T01:53:00.000Z	unop	cbones	have you verified using ifconfig and iwconfig?
2008-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	unop	cbones	ok, well, do verify
2008-06-29T01:55:00.000Z	unop	cbones	just type  iwconfig  # you should see information about your wireless card if the module and firmware were loaded properly
2008-06-29T01:58:00.000Z	cbones	unop	 heres what it says  http://dpaste.com/59696/
2008-06-29T01:59:00.000Z	unop	cbones	and you only have one wireless card plugged in at the moment?
2008-06-29T02:03:00.000Z	unop	cbones	well, it appears to me that your wireless interface is up -- doesn't it show up in the network manager / applet ?
2008-06-29T02:05:00.000Z	cbones	unop	where is the net work manager at
2008-06-29T02:06:00.000Z	unop	cbones	it's in the notification area / system tray -- the little icon with two-computers connected together
2008-06-29T02:11:00.000Z	cbones	unop	 your talking about up top ion the right side
2008-06-29T02:12:00.000Z	unop	cbones	right, yes -- sorry, i don't use gnome and when i do, i usually put the notification area down on the right hand side .. but yea, top right, little icon resembling a network of two computers -- double click on it, etc
2008-06-29T02:14:00.000Z	unop	cbones	ok, well, does your wireless card show up there tho? that's what i want to know
2008-06-29T02:15:00.000Z	cbones	unop	:  no
2008-06-29T02:16:00.000Z	unop	cbones	ahh, not sure how i can help you more, i don't use gnome, so i wouldnt know what to do -- maybe you should ask someone who uses gnome
2008-06-29T02:22:00.000Z	cbones	unop	 what should I do
2008-06-29T02:23:00.000Z	unop	cbones	i'm not really sure - like i said, i don't use gnome, so i can't really help much
2008-06-29T02:25:00.000Z	cbones	unop	: i now have a wirless icon but it will not connect
