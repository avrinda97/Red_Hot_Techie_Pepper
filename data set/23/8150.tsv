2004-12-26T08:14:00.000Z	vjwarty	sid77	i tried to install gdm but shows the error gdm depends libgnomevfs2-0 (>=2.9.1) but 2.8.2-0ubundu1 is to be installed; broken package; what do i do now?
2004-12-26T08:14:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	that's why I was worried before
2004-12-26T08:14:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	why not completely dist-upgrading to hoary?
2004-12-26T08:15:00.000Z	vjwarty	sid77	it is not possible with my sloooow dialup connection
2004-12-26T08:15:00.000Z	sid77		urgh, same problem @home
2004-12-26T08:16:00.000Z	vjwarty	sid77	is there any workaround of this prob?
2004-12-26T08:17:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	don't know
2004-12-26T08:17:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	maybe you should try to downgrade hoary packages to warty one
2004-12-26T08:18:00.000Z	vjwarty	sid77	how do i do that?
2004-12-26T08:18:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	or trying to understand what is needed and install that
2004-12-26T08:18:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	IIRC I saw a faq once, link is in the channel topic
2004-12-26T08:19:00.000Z	vjwarty	sid77	it shows gnomevfs2.9.1 is needed; but i cant understand why apt couldn't find that???
2004-12-26T08:21:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	if you have mixed repositories, are they both active in /etc/apt/sources.list?
2004-12-26T08:21:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	probably hoary gdm needs hoary gnome stuff
2004-12-26T08:22:00.000Z	vjwarty	sid77	i have hoary and warty in source.list is it the reason?
2004-12-26T08:23:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	I think that both of them should be uncommented to be avalaible to mix packages (which isn't a good thing)
2004-12-26T08:27:00.000Z	vjwarty	sid77	now i am in a tough situation; i'll try to downgrade the packages to warty!!;
2004-12-26T08:31:00.000Z	sid77	vjwarty	yeah! but I don't know how to do that!!! 8|
