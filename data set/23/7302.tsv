2005-10-03T15:05:00.000Z	jc-denton		i always  get the following error msg when using gtk apps
2005-10-03T15:05:00.000Z	jc-denton		(gedit:20524): Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by Xlib
2005-10-03T15:06:00.000Z	jc-denton		$LANG is en_US
2005-10-03T15:06:00.000Z	jc-denton		i think it's becacue it was first set to unicode then i set it back to this
2005-10-03T15:07:00.000Z	Oetzi	jc-denton	the problem is that my fluxbox, aterm and several other progs do not work because of this error
2005-10-03T15:08:00.000Z	jc-denton	Oetzi	wtf
2005-10-03T15:09:00.000Z	Oetzi	jc-denton	it starts but there are no fonts shown and in aterm  an so on do not work
2005-10-03T15:10:00.000Z	jc-denton	Oetzi	yes
2005-10-03T15:10:00.000Z	jc-denton	Oetzi	so u mean i should simply switch back the locales to unicode?
