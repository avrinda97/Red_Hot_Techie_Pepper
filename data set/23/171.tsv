2012-10-29T02:20:00.000Z	adam_		I need help booting my flash drive. I'm trying to boot Pear Linux and everytime I select my flash drive to boot it takes me to GRUB
2012-10-29T02:20:00.000Z	adam_		Yeah I just used MATE as well and switched
2012-10-29T02:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	adam_	You know how to get to the outside of the boot menu?
2012-10-29T02:21:00.000Z	adam_	wilee-nilee	BIOS?
2012-10-29T02:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	adam_	YOU can set the usb boot from the bios and there is a key press to get you to a menu outside of the bios.
2012-10-29T02:22:00.000Z	adam_	wilee-nilee	how do I do that?
2012-10-29T02:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	adam_	Mine is f12 like you would going to the bios, yours may be different.
2012-10-29T02:23:00.000Z	adam_		I've tried going to BIOS and making the flash drive boot first and it doesn't work. I was able to boot from my flash drive earlier today with no problems.
2012-10-29T02:23:00.000Z	adam_		And on the computer it says flash drive is part of the HDD group
2012-10-29T02:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	adam_	Some computers use f12 some other keys you can look on the web for the boot from menu for your setup, or post it here if you don't find it and we can try.
2012-10-29T02:24:00.000Z	adam_	wilee-nilee	I've tried before. It's an HP pavilion a6109n
2012-10-29T02:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	adam_	I think the HP is esc
2012-10-29T02:25:00.000Z	adam_		yeah that's the boot menu
2012-10-29T02:25:00.000Z	adam_		Then I select my flash drive from the boot menu and it takes me to GRUB
2012-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	adam_	How did you load the usb, and did you do a md5sum on the ISO?
2012-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	adam_		no. I used unetbootin to but the iso onto it
2012-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	adam_		put*
2012-10-29T02:27:00.000Z	adam_		what do you mean by redo the liveUSB
2012-10-29T02:28:00.000Z	adam_		I used the mac version of unetbootin to do it
2012-10-29T02:28:00.000Z	adam_		and I already tried doing it again
2012-10-29T02:29:00.000Z	adam_		k
2012-10-29T02:29:00.000Z	adam_		brb
2012-10-29T02:29:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	adam_	The only thing I would say here as well is that that OS does not have as wide and large amount of support as ubuntu, this channel would not help you for one.
