2006-06-15T14:49:00.000Z	titan_		Crap, when I try to install the NVidia drivers, even after ctrl-alt-f1 ing it still says I am running xserver... how do I shut it down
2006-06-15T14:51:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	ctrl-alt-f1 and then type xdm killall
2006-06-15T14:52:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	do what i said earlier
2006-06-15T14:52:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	ctrl-alt-f1 and then type xdm killall
2006-06-15T14:53:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	does that make sense
2006-06-15T14:54:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	did that work?
2006-06-15T14:54:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	no, it gave me an error, like it was a bad command
2006-06-15T14:54:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	xdm killall right?
2006-06-15T14:54:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	are you in gnome?
2006-06-15T14:54:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	yes
2006-06-15T14:55:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	gdm killall
2006-06-15T14:55:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	sudo gdm killall
2006-06-15T14:56:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	ok I wil ltry that
2006-06-15T14:56:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	yeah
2006-06-15T15:04:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	That worked, I just had to use killall gdm instead of gdm killall
2006-06-15T15:05:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	yw
2006-06-15T15:05:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	i couldn't remember the order, sorry about that
2006-06-15T15:06:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	thanks again =P All i have to do now is install my kernel source code cause it has to compile my kernel and crap to install it... what a pain.
2006-06-15T15:06:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	hope I don't mess it up... guess you'll know if I don't show back up, ROFL.
2006-06-15T15:06:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	you can always take it back to the last thing that was there but changing the xorg.conf file
2006-06-15T15:07:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	the thing is I have no clue how to do that, lol
2006-06-15T15:08:00.000Z	Sivik	titan_	the file is under /etc/X11 and all you would have to do is edit where it said either "nvidia" or "nv" to "vesa" and then you could get back into your gui, you can also get into irc via command line by installing irssi
2006-06-15T15:10:00.000Z	titan_	Sivik	thanks, writing all that down, don't like doing a whole system reinstall when I have no clue how to get back in =P
