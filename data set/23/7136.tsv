2006-01-28T14:57:00.000Z	shingouz		lets see: ubuntu 5.04, 2.6.10-5-386 kernel and a frigging Conexant HSFi winmodem. i can dial but the pppd dies before getting the dns with "code 16, a modem hung up the phone". hints appreciated
2006-01-28T14:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	You have the driver from Linuxant?
2006-01-28T14:58:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	yup
2006-01-28T14:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	Probably a stupid question, but you have the one that matches your kernel version?
2006-01-28T14:59:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	the very one :)
2006-01-28T14:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	What are you using to dial?
2006-01-28T14:59:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	wvdial
2006-01-28T15:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	d***.  So far you've pretty much echoed the setup I've used successfully on two different computers.  I was hoping you'd answer something differently.
2006-01-28T15:01:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	i am very very tempted to run outside and get a hardware modem for this one but that would mean i would have to go outside which is always scary
2006-01-28T15:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	Phone a friend, and have them order one for you online!
2006-01-28T15:03:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	or i could always get on a bike and scoot off to zeer rangsit real quick, it is around the corner for me a couple of more days
2006-01-28T15:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	Whatever floats your boat I guess.
2006-01-28T15:04:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	heh... actually i would like to make this one work without having to get another modem. works nicely on "the other operating system" and dials nicely on the real os but the pppd pains me
2006-01-28T15:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	Tried reinstalling the driver?
2006-01-28T15:06:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	augh. dpkg --remove && dpkg --install? or just a dpkg-reconfigure?
2006-01-28T15:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	Try reconf first, and go from there.
2006-01-28T15:07:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	lets give it a whack. /me gets a bigger hammer
2006-01-28T15:17:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	hmm.. could it be that the snd-intel8x0m and snd-atiixp-modem getting overridden by hsfmc97ich and hsfmc97sis have something to do with the code 16? enter the snd modules in the banlist, perhaps?
2006-01-28T15:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	Worth a shot.
2006-01-28T15:20:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	does ubuntu have the banlist in some strange place? ;)
2006-01-28T15:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	I wouldn't know, sorry.
2009-02-19T21:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shingouz	/etc/timezone, but rather thhan editing it directly I believe the proper way is to use 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata'.
2009-02-19T21:37:00.000Z	shingouz	tonyyarusso	thanks. and true but i am not going to edit it, just to get some information from it :)
