2006-10-03T07:07:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	Ok, thanks for the info. I might have to send the laptop back to IBM cause the rescue CD's they sent didn't work. I have to at least dual boot XP because tv-out can be kinda important sometimes
2006-10-03T07:08:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	The CSs did not work?
2006-10-03T07:08:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	Nope
2006-10-03T07:09:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	strange, i have a R40 and also ordered the cds - 5! but they work and you can make a normal Win-CD out of the i386-folder then with nlite
2006-10-03T07:10:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	They sent me 10 CD's so I've got two copies of each CD =)
2006-10-03T07:11:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	What happtens if you insert the first and boot from CD?
2006-10-03T07:11:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	Starts restoring but spits out a lot of error messages
2006-10-03T07:12:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	Did you change some hardware?
2006-10-03T07:14:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	Have you removed all partitions on the hdd
2006-10-03T07:14:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	I got the worst spyware there is (according to Wikipedia) and it could not be removed so I did a restore from the restore partition
2006-10-03T07:15:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	I've done that once before and it worked. I've never touched the restore partition
2006-10-03T07:16:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	I think i removed my restore partition...
2006-10-03T07:16:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	The rescue CD's are supposed to wipe the drive so I didn't care about what was on there
2006-10-03T07:17:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	One i did the rescue from CD but only the C: partition was formatted, the D: was left over...
2006-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	So maybe I should remove all partitions and give it a try... Ubuntu works out of the box so I can always install it again even if the rescue fails
2006-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	I would try this before sending back. And if it installs, save / burn the i386 folder
2006-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	then use this i386-folder together with nlite and make a normal windows CD
2006-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	this is legal sice you have a license
2006-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	Then you can use this CD and do a normal install with partitioning, and install ubuntu afterwards...
2006-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	klingsor	MarkAngels	This also keeps out all this shit from IBM, and you can get the latest drivers and service packs
2006-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	Ok, thanks for the advice. I'll give it a try in a few days. What has always bothered be was all the software (crap) they install
2006-10-03T07:24:00.000Z	MarkAngels	klingsor	I almost got it working with a friends XP CD. But to get the drivers I had to burn the ethernet driver on a CD since the USB wasn't recognized. When I got online I downloaded the automatic update cliend and it gave me a shitload of errormessages and messed things up
