2006-06-07T08:06:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	have you done a search on the forums or wiki?  i'd start there if there are errors
2006-06-07T08:07:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	are you sure stuff isn't muted?
2006-06-07T08:08:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	at the command line, do `lsmod |grep ac97`
2006-06-07T08:09:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	don't paste the results, but does it show snd_ac97_codec?
2006-06-07T08:09:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	ok, so for some reason, the modules aren't being loaded.  you say it's a realtek ac97 card?
2006-06-07T08:10:00.000Z	Some_Person	krazykit	Windows says it is
2006-06-07T08:12:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	well... do `lspci | grep AC\'97` and see what it says
2006-06-07T08:13:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	ok, try `lspci |egrep audio`
2006-06-07T08:14:00.000Z	Some_Person	krazykit	0000:00:10.2 Multimedia audio controller: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 026b (rev a2)
2006-06-07T08:15:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	ok... so either you have onboard sound that isn't recognized and your pci card isn't recognized... either way, i'd go pester the forums now.  do a search for `unknown nvidia audio` or make a new thread.
2006-06-07T15:22:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	no.  the drivers would be in the kernel
2006-06-12T08:11:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	it means you need to get the kernel headers and build-essential
2006-06-12T08:12:00.000Z	Some_Person	krazykit	so what does it mean?
2006-06-12T08:13:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	because you don't have the kernel headers or build-essential
2006-06-12T08:20:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	there's the problem.  install gcc 3.4
2006-06-12T08:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	krazykit	in synaptic, both are installed
2006-06-12T08:23:00.000Z	Some_Person	krazykit	then i get an error unable to load nvnet.ko
2006-06-12T08:24:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	i'd recommend asking someone that's installed the nvidia drivers :-P.  i've not done it in ubuntu
2006-06-13T08:36:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	w32codecs
2006-06-13T08:36:00.000Z	krazykit	Some_Person	it's in Seveas' repos, too, if you want something easy.
