2006-07-08T12:58:00.000Z	dbmata		nvidia, help, anyone?
2006-07-08T12:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	ask a question?
2006-07-08T12:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	what kind of card is it?
2006-07-08T13:00:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	what driver line do you have?
2006-07-08T13:01:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	I'm sorry, driver line? How can I find that? (I just installed it like 10 minutes ago using apt-get
2006-07-08T13:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	type grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf from a terminal.
2006-07-08T13:04:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	I'm assuming you just want the video driver, it's listed as "nvidia"
2006-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	glxinfo doesn't show direct rendering?
2006-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	would I run grep nvidia-glx-glxinfo ?
2006-07-08T13:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	glxinfo | grep direct
2006-07-08T13:08:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	output of direct rendering: Yes
2006-07-08T13:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	then everything is okay
2006-07-08T13:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	you have no problems with your drivers, they are running fine and you are using them.
2006-07-08T13:11:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	ok, then my question changes a bit... I have a two monitor setup, how can I define which monitor should be the default? I read through the tseliot tutorial and it didn't work.
2006-07-08T13:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	hrmm, you want dual screen, or extended desktop, or just to turn one off?
2006-07-08T13:12:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	well, if I can't have an extended desktop, I'd like to just use my left monitor, and the only monitor that seems to want to work is my right monitor. (Before I installed the driver, my left monitor worked, an lcd. After installing, the right monitor works, a CRT.)
2006-07-08T13:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	lol, okay. You need to setup xinerama. There are a few tutorials around for that. I haven't set it up personally, but its easy. What you do is, you define two monitors in your xorg.conf file, then you define how they are setup, ie, which one is where relative to the other. 'lcd left-of crt' etc. That should be it.
2006-07-08T13:15:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	hells bells. Ok, since I need to learn how to do this, can you point me at a tutorial or something that does this? I hate taking in channel bandwidth.
2006-07-08T13:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	there are a few floating around, I think one of the best ones is at gentoo-wiki.com -- you can just google it because this part is not ubuntu-specific (ie, the same xorg configuration applies to any linux distro).
2006-07-08T13:21:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	Thanks for your help. I'm going to see what I can break... er... setup.
2006-07-08T13:34:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dbmata	Identifier is a freeform string. You can call it whatever you want, but remember to change it also in the Device " " line of the Screen section, otherwise X won't start.
2006-07-08T13:35:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	thanks again. I'm going to trying to get these monitors working.
2006-07-08T13:53:00.000Z	dbmata	fyrestrtr	thanks for your help tonight. (This morning.)
