2004-12-18T08:20:00.000Z	Netsnipe		hey everyone
2004-12-18T08:21:00.000Z	Netsnipe		I just loaded up the live CD just to see how my gnome packages were modified for warty
2004-12-18T08:21:00.000Z	Netsnipe		= )
2004-12-18T08:22:00.000Z	Netsnipe		could someone please explain "- use tracepath instead of (tcp)traceroute (Warty: #2058)." to me?
2004-12-18T08:22:00.000Z	Netsnipe		gnome-nettool
2004-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	Netsnipe		I'm just wondering if I should be applying this change back in unstable
2004-12-18T08:25:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	we don't have traceroute in main
2004-12-18T08:25:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	so I've changed it to use tracepath
2004-12-18T08:27:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	the output is identical?
2004-12-18T08:29:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	you have the source packages, the patches are in debian/patches for GNOME stuff
2004-12-18T08:29:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	I'm on the Live CD atm.
2004-12-18T08:30:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	don't have partition space to install warty yet.
2004-12-18T08:30:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	ubuntu doesn't have a viewcvs service handy?
2004-12-18T08:35:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	no, there is no cvs
2004-12-18T08:39:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	I don't have added this !
2004-12-18T08:40:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	I think there is already some sscanf in the code and I've already added one extra one
2004-12-18T08:40:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	read the upstream code first
2004-12-18T08:40:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	I'm looking for it right now
2004-12-18T08:41:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	better to look before asking
2004-12-18T08:41:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	I ain't blaming you for anything.
2004-12-18T08:42:00.000Z	seb128	Netsnipe	no you're just starting to ask people if I've added a security problem by using some functions in my patch
2004-12-18T08:42:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	you're right. upstream is using sscanf
2004-12-18T08:43:00.000Z	Netsnipe	seb128	sorry if I caused offense.
