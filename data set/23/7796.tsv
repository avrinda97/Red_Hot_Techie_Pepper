2005-05-07T05:16:00.000Z	nekohayo		anyone knowledgeable with veeeeeery old hardware? I just want to know, if those things (such as serial ports) plugged directly in motherboards are considererd as "PCI" or not.. ?
2005-05-07T05:16:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	no, they're older than pci :)
2005-05-07T05:17:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	they'll be /dev/ttyS0 on up
2005-05-07T05:18:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	?
2005-05-07T05:20:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	I've never used a serial mouse, so ....
2005-05-07T05:21:00.000Z	nekohayo	nickrud	me neither ;) this thing is OLD
2005-05-07T05:24:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	yeah, the sarge business card iso
2005-05-07T05:25:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	so you've been using linux for a few weeks then :)
2005-05-07T05:27:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	voodoo2 is the bomb!
2005-05-07T05:31:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	this isn't an old IBM, is it?
2005-05-28T07:07:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	i'm curious, do the gnome resolutions work?
2005-05-28T07:08:00.000Z	nekohayo	nickrud	they work
2005-05-28T07:08:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	interesting :) I'm no X guru, but I find it interesting. You only have one res available in xorg.conf?
2005-05-28T07:11:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	no, a lot more nice than weird. I've struggled with configs too much.
2005-05-28T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	so make a new user, log in and change the res, and let me know what happens :)
2005-05-28T07:13:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	to be honest, so I can learn :)
2005-05-28T07:14:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	I've got a lot of screens defined, so I'm not a good control
2005-05-28T07:15:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	no, I never realized that gnome could have different res's available, so i've never looked at ti
2005-05-28T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	I've only seen that happen when I had to boot in Safe Mode (every 2 or three times at the end) :)
2005-05-28T07:20:00.000Z	nekohayo	nickrud	multiple users with different resolutions work fine.
2005-05-28T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	this was very timely, cuz I just helped a guy in our shelter get his own domain name. I'm delegating this machine for their use, and that's one less thing I need to worry about.
2005-05-28T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	I lurk here for strange questions, I've been doing that for years here and there
2005-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	nekohayo	if your sound card cannot handle multiple sound sources, you could try the following link
