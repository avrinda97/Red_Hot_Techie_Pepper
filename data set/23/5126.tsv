2007-02-24T10:47:00.000Z	Krunk		Hi. I've tried to figure out how one can get a non-X console in order to install Nvidia proprietary driver in Ubuntu 6,10. The best I've come up with is to ESC before X starts up and use the 'safe' mode kernel. However, after I've installed the thing, it indicates that GLX is not installed or corrupted (installation instructions tell me to remove 'glx' from xorg.conf). I can'tr seem to get accelerated #D to work. Anyone know what I can do?
2007-02-24T10:48:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	why not install nvidia-glx from repos?
2007-02-24T10:48:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	those are proprietary drivers, just nicely packaged so you can easily remove them
2007-02-24T10:49:00.000Z	Krunk	holycow	I did that and it doesn'tr work. Now even if I install games they don't actually install. Is this common? (Btw, I'm on my fifth or sixth complete install)
2007-02-24T10:49:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	it does work, you might need to double check that your xorg.conf file is configure properly
2007-02-24T10:49:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	or reinstall
2007-02-24T10:50:00.000Z	Krunk	holycow	again?? sigh .. Mandrake does the whole thing w/o a hitch. How I hate Gnome . . .
2007-02-24T10:50:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	what are you talking about? nvidia has nothing to do with gnome
2007-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	it has everything to do with ubuntu
2007-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	ubuntu tries to stick with free software, it doesn't 'yet' let you install proprietary stuff on install
2007-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	Krunk	holycow	well, gnome isn't as intuitive as kde . . . config stuff is well hidden.
2007-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	wtf are you talking about?
2007-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	everything is in system/admin
2007-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	start up synaptic or install from terminal
2007-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	also if you like, install kde
2007-02-24T10:53:00.000Z	Krunk	holycow	everything: try to get at a non-X console - lotsa fun.
2007-02-24T10:53:00.000Z	Krunk	holycow	did that and it really borked
2007-02-24T10:53:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	people complaining usually rub everyone the wrong way as usually they didn't really look
2007-02-24T10:54:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	well it sounds like you decided already athat mandrake is better so use that
2007-02-24T10:54:00.000Z	Krunk	holycow	I really like Ubuntu, but I really did 'look' - try changing ther video card, or monitor in Gnome - good luck!
2007-02-24T10:54:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	what are you talking about again?
2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	Krunk	holycow	sorry I ruffled feathers here. I'll keep opinions to myself.
2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	holycow	Krunk	well if you have opinions that are unfounded, biased and wrong, never mind that they don't make sense ...
