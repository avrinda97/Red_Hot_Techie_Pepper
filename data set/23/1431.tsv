2010-04-02T05:07:00.000Z	KRStwo		Chid:  Right click on the desktop, choose appearance
2010-04-02T05:07:00.000Z	KRStwo		Chid:  in the rightmost tab, you can disable desktop effects
2010-04-02T05:08:00.000Z	KRStwo		Chid:  Odd.  Do you have emerald or something installed?
2010-04-02T05:09:00.000Z	KRStwo		Chid:  Oh, so you want to get rid of all the netbook stuff and have a normal desktop?
2010-04-02T05:10:00.000Z	KRStwo		Chid:  Right. Go to the system menu and see if you can enable any restricted drivers (as costre mentioned)
2010-04-02T05:11:00.000Z	chid	KRStwo	yeah there's the broadcom
2010-04-02T05:11:00.000Z	chid		one that I need
2010-04-02T05:11:00.000Z	KRStwo	chid	enable that sucker and your wireless should come up at least
2010-04-02T05:11:00.000Z	chid	KRStwo	I can't
2010-04-02T05:11:00.000Z	chid		because it needs to connect to the internet to download it
2010-04-02T05:12:00.000Z	chid		I'm gonna have to search for the deb :p
2010-04-02T05:12:00.000Z	KRStwo	chid	 crap.  and no ethernet access?
2010-04-02T05:12:00.000Z	chid	KRStwo	nope
2010-04-02T05:12:00.000Z	KRStwo		:(
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	KRStwo	chid	 I have to run, but just to let you know, I've had really bad luck with the graphics performance of ubuntu netbook remix on my eeepc - standard ubuntu works much better for me.  Good luck!
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	chid	KRStwo	dammit
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	chid	KRStwo	damn
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	chid		I wonder if I can just plug into my school network with ethernet
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	chid		doubt it though
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	chid		my uni has a pretty tragic mirror
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	chid		doesn't have anything at all
2010-04-02T05:15:00.000Z	chid		how do I install the deb
2010-04-02T05:15:00.000Z	KRStwo	chid	 yeah, i would try to get to a wired connection to install all the proper drivers before spending much more time on it.
