2009-03-03T23:56:00.000Z	IdentifyTarget		who do I talk to about getting the ubuntu rep updated? lirc is a version old
2009-03-03T23:58:00.000Z	IdentifyTarget		can cvs be used to update an already installed package?
2009-03-03T23:58:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	not without risking to break stuff
2009-03-04T00:00:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	0.8.4a appears to be in backports, according to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+source/lirc/0.8.4a-0ubuntu2~intrepid1
2009-03-04T00:00:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	or at least slated for backports
2009-03-04T00:03:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	it actually is in backports, http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=lirc&searchon=names&suite=intrepid-backports&section=all confirms it, although it doesn't show up in my own Intrepid install. i don't know why.
2009-03-04T00:04:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	you're out of luck then, unless you request a hardy backports and get it done
2009-03-04T00:05:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	though honestly, you can't really complain that packages are not the latest version if you're not using the latest version of ubuntu ;)
2009-03-04T00:05:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	no. adding an intrepid repository to hardy may, and generally will, have ill consequences.
2009-03-04T00:06:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	you *may* try to install the *single* package from intrepid-backports, *without* adding the whole repository. that's still not guaranteed to work, and you may end up with broken packages.
2009-03-04T00:06:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	if you still want to do it, download the file at http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid-backports/i386/lirc/download and run gdebi on it.
2009-03-19T20:44:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	have you installed any new peripherals since that started happening?
2009-03-19T20:46:00.000Z	IdentifyTarget	LjL	any more ideas?
2009-03-19T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	try 1) adding "acpi=force" to your kernel options 2) unloading all sound-related modules before shutting down (lsmod | grep snd should show them)
2009-03-19T20:47:00.000Z	IdentifyTarget	LjL	would that help with hibernate/resume which doesn't work either
2009-03-19T20:48:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	you can try it one-off by hitting "e" in your GRUB menu, then "e" again, then adding it to the longest line you see, then hitting "b" to boot -- or you may change that permanently by adding it to /boot/grub/menu.lst (but don't do that right away)
2009-03-19T20:48:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	it might
2009-03-19T21:06:00.000Z	IdentifyTarget	LjL	fixed my problem. acpi=force wasn't needed. For some reason shutdown -P isn't the default option. -P powers off the system. sudo shutdown -P now works fine
2009-03-19T21:07:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	oh. weird.
2009-03-19T21:07:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	i admit i use "sudo halt" usually anyway
2009-03-19T21:07:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	try it... i don't know how to make -P the default
2009-03-19T21:08:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	oh wait, yes i do know
2009-03-19T21:09:00.000Z	LjL	IdentifyTarget	/etc/default/halt
