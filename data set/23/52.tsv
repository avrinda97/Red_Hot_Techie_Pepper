2012-09-23T03:44:00.000Z	Cosman246		oh
2012-09-23T03:44:00.000Z	Cosman246		Yeah, I'll put that up

2012-09-23T03:49:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	jrib The held package is likely a result of a PPA or other non-standard archive. It might be worth checking for PPAs and/or doing "apt-get dist-upgrade"
2012-09-23T03:49:00.000Z	Cosman246	TJ-	I removed all PPAs from my sources.list
2012-09-23T03:50:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	But that may be the problem - if you've previously installed packages that are later versions than those in the main archives, the main archive packages may not be able to install since their dependenices specify older versions
2012-09-23T03:51:00.000Z	Cosman246	TJ-	shit, I'll have to give up emacs24 and racket
2012-09-23T03:51:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	As jrib is taking you through it, he's likely to help you pin-down and manually correct each broken/held package
2012-09-23T03:55:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	As far as I can see, those Elementary* PPAs introduced packages for the ElementaryOS, a different distro to Ubuntu
2012-09-23T03:57:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	can you pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-09-23T03:58:00.000Z	Cosman246	TJ-	: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1221574/
2012-09-23T04:24:00.000Z	Cosman246	TJ-	OK
2012-09-23T04:25:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	PPAs can be very dangerous once you start adding them ad-hoc... you depart from the controlled packaging that the Ubuntu archives maintain
2012-09-23T04:16:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	jrib The 'Packages' file for elementarydesktop Natty PPA: http://ppa.launchpad.net/elementaryart/elementarydesktop/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-amd64/Packages
2012-09-23T04:21:00.000Z	Cosman246	TJ-	what's your advice?
2012-09-23T04:24:00.000Z	TJ-	Cosman246	Save your data and important configuration files, delete OS and install clean and fresh.
