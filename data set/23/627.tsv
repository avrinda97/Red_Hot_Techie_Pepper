2011-05-05T04:55:00.000Z	chille		i just rebootet my new ubuntu box for the first time and now it can't find the root partition :(
2011-05-05T04:55:00.000Z	chille		i bootet up the ubuntu live cd and ran fdisk /dev/sda and it says:
2011-05-05T04:55:00.000Z	chille		/dev/sda1               1      243202  1953514583+  ee  GPT
2011-05-05T04:56:00.000Z	chille		but how do i know what partitions are inside the GPT?
2011-05-05T04:56:00.000Z	escott	chille	gdisk
2011-05-05T04:56:00.000Z	escott	chille	you could also try gparted
2011-05-05T05:00:00.000Z	escott	chille	you may want to read this http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/hybrid.html
2011-05-05T05:12:00.000Z	escott	chille	you have something called gpt with a mbr protective partition
2011-05-05T06:18:00.000Z	escott	chille	what was your gpt question?
2011-05-05T06:19:00.000Z	chille	escott	i have trouble with booting my system. the kernel starts but can't find the root filesystem
2011-05-05T06:20:00.000Z	chille	escott	however GParted find it and i can mount it without any trouble
2011-05-05T06:20:00.000Z	escott	chille	it may be that the initrd doesn't understand gpt
2011-05-05T06:20:00.000Z	chille	escott	the kernel can't even mount the root file system and start initrd
2011-05-05T06:21:00.000Z	chille	escott	i just get a kernel panic
2011-05-05T06:21:00.000Z	escott	chille	i don't know a better way to find out for sure than to unpack the initrd, but thats probably why
2011-05-05T06:21:00.000Z	chille	escott	oh.. wait.. initrd.. of course.. i'm mixing it up with something else
2011-05-05T06:21:00.000Z	chille	escott	well, i can try unpacking initrd and see whats inside
2011-05-05T06:22:00.000Z	escott	chille	what kind of system is this? bios + gpt disk, or pure efi?
2011-05-05T06:22:00.000Z	chille	escott	BIOS + GPT
2011-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	escott	chille	you could try using gdisk to establish a hybrid mbr, its a bit of a pain to maintain (you have to always use gdisk to manage it)
2011-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	escott	chille	that way you could create a small /boot at the front of the disk, and give it a traditional msdos filesystem
2011-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	chille	escott	yeah. or i could just reinstall ubuntu and everything would probably work :(
2011-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	chille	escott	it worked the 2-3 first times i booted the computer
