2005-06-05T11:50:00.000Z	imaek		How can I connect my iPod if there isn't a /dev/sdc2
2005-06-05T11:50:00.000Z	imaek		?
2005-06-05T11:52:00.000Z	imaek		How can I get my iPod to work with gtkpod when there isn't a /dev/sdc2 ?
2005-06-05T11:54:00.000Z	imaek		How can I get my iPod to work with gtkpod when it isn't sensing the iPod? The tutorial says use dmesg, but I don't know what to do with the output ?
2005-06-05T11:55:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	try typing tail -f /var/log/messages and then connect your ipod
2005-06-05T11:57:00.000Z	imaek		Does anybody know what it means when your iPod has a little cd with a magnifying glass going over it and a small very slow-moving progress bar?
2005-06-05T11:57:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	where are you 'seeing' your ipod?
2005-06-05T11:57:00.000Z	terasurfer		or is this on the ipod display?
2005-06-05T11:57:00.000Z	imaek		I mean, on the screen of the physical iPod.
2005-06-05T11:58:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	i am not sure, but it might be reading the disk contents...due to lack of an iTunes database
2005-06-05T11:58:00.000Z	imaek	terasurfer	O...kay.  It's been doing it for like 5 minutes now and it looks to be only 25-30% done. :(
2005-06-05T11:59:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	is there a lot of data on the ipod?
2005-06-05T11:59:00.000Z	imaek	terasurfer	it's a 20gb, and I think I only have like 5-6gb filled.
2005-06-05T11:59:00.000Z	imaek		Oh, wait. terasurfer: http://www.ipodlounge.com/index.php/faqs/answers/what-do-i-do-when-i-turn-on-my-ipod-and-i-see-a-disc-icon-looks-like-a-cd-w/
2005-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	imaek		It would be nice if they had it say "NOW SCANNING FOR DISK ERRORS" or something.
2005-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	what other OS have you connected the ipod to?
2005-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	imaek		I had it connected to my father's Mac (os 10.4).
2005-06-05T12:01:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	have you tried transferring data to the ipod in linux?
2005-06-05T12:01:00.000Z	imaek		No, not yet terasurfer.
2005-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	just a word of caution...when i tried to transfer to my ipod (hfs file system) using gtkpod, it trashed the file system
2005-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	imaek	terasurfer	I don't really worry about the files on the iPod... as long as it doesn't perminately ruin the actual iPod.
2005-06-05T12:03:00.000Z	terasurfer	imaek	nah the hardware was fine, but i had to do a complete reset and transfer all files over again
2005-06-05T12:03:00.000Z	imaek	terasurfer	That doesn't bother me.  9/10 of it is stuff my dad wanted to give me; the only stuff I want is on this computer and not on the iPod yet.
