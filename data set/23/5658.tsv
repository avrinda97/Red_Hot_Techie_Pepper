2008-04-14T01:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	I am aware of what it is
2008-06-07T05:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	yes, boot windows cd and fixmbr
2008-06-07T05:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	grub writes the first 512 bytes of the drive/partition
2008-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	Ok, but writing those 512 bytes NTFS partition will overwrite some windows files because thats where i installed GRUB, stupid me.
2008-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	no.. 512 is the mbr for windows or linux
2008-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	oh nice then
2008-06-07T05:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	Note: 512 includes the partition info 446 first partition is 16 bytes and gets to 462 Would just be the boot info... use hda if needed on your system             copy mbr.backup to a USB Drive or other media
2008-06-07T05:14:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	is there a tool like fixmbr from linux to repair widows mbr
2008-06-07T05:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	then if you want you can repair grub..  but use livecd to backup the mbr with the dd command
2008-06-07T05:17:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	Does fixmbr repair the mbr on the OS partition or just start of HD?
2008-06-07T05:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	It should restore it so that you have windows back
2008-06-07T05:20:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	I did that and but win does not boot and mounting win from linux: mount /dev/sda1 win -tntfs gives error about "unexpected clusters per mft record (-1), the device does not have a valid NTFS"
2008-06-07T05:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	Boot a livecd and sudo fdisk -l   the drive
2008-06-07T05:23:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	I am in linux now, fdisk -l display properly
2008-06-07T05:23:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	the NTFS partition that is
2008-06-07T05:34:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	FYI windwoz has a back boot sector, I ran testdisk application and it detected that first and back up(at the end of partition) did not match, testdisk simple restored it, not it works.
2008-06-07T05:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	great
2009-01-05T00:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dtolj	Not needed for linux to linux..
2009-01-05T00:29:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	what can i use then?
2009-01-05T00:30:00.000Z	dtolj	Jack_Sparrow	is NFS easy to setup?
