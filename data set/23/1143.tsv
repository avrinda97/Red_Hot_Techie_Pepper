2011-01-05T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	I know you can do it in /etc/network/interfaces

2011-01-17T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	I think it's pretty pathetic personally
2011-01-17T13:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	workaroud...use dropbox ;)
2011-01-17T13:26:00.000Z	hidnshadows	ActionParsnip	dropbox?
2011-01-17T13:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	web storage which autosyncs (like rsync) when new files are added / editted in the dropbox folder
2011-01-17T13:28:00.000Z	hidnshadows	ActionParsnip	and that's responding to what? No offense but my attention span is- ooh shiny
2011-01-17T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	no ext4 access in windows, use the web to store data
2011-01-17T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	its like ubuntuone but works on more devices
2011-01-17T13:30:00.000Z	hidnshadows	ActionParsnip	aaaah very clever! The only problem would be security integrity, but if it works
2011-01-17T13:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	its as secure as your webmail as you use your email address and dropbox pass to authenticate when you install the client
2011-01-17T13:31:00.000Z	hidnshadows	ActionParsnip	I'll have to look that up. I personally use my iTouch as a LAN server
2011-01-17T14:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	s/he's one
2011-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	hidnshadows	ActionParsnip	what do you mean USB functionality? ability to boot from USB? or ability to use USB devices?
2011-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	access usb devices
2011-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	the OSE doesn't have raw USB connectivity
2011-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/Installation
2011-01-17T14:36:00.000Z	hidnshadows	ActionParsnip	weird, it always works for me, does whoever perhaps need to add a device slot under settings?
2011-01-17T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	not sure man
2011-01-17T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	there should be, you need to set thresholds and timeouts etc
2011-01-17T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	you'll need to at least tell the device what OS it is attached to, so it can issue the right shutdown command
2011-01-17T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hidnshadows	in essence yes, but good UPS systems will save enough juice for the system to be automatically shutdown by the device so the power doesn't just die and may corrupt data
