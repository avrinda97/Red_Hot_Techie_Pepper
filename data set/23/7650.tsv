2005-11-17T13:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	caonex	i used to use an app called 'gpm' to use the mouse in the console; i see a gpm package in the repositories
2005-11-17T13:29:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	i know about that i used to use that in debian, however, it says is obsolete, so what is used instead?
2005-11-17T13:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	caonex	where do you see that it's obsolete?
2005-11-17T13:30:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	when i installed it last time
2005-11-17T13:31:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	when i ran gpmconfig i think .
2005-11-17T13:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	caonex	sorry, i don't know what the alternatives are. There's no conflict dependency or anything about it being obsolete in the package description
2005-11-17T13:31:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	how about the keyboard, keymap settings or locale? what is the package?
2005-11-17T13:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	caonex	as far as I know one sets environment variables to specify locale, like LANG (i think), and others
2005-11-17T13:33:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	i understand now, gpmconfig is what is deprecated, one should use dpkg-reconfigure gpm instead ;)
2005-11-17T13:33:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	i had misunderstood....
2005-11-17T13:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	caonex	for the keyboard maybe 'loadkeys' is what you want?
2005-11-17T13:34:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	not sure let me see....
2005-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	i am glad you mention gpm again, because i love that tool.....and your make me find out i had misunderstood thanks...
2005-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	caonex	cool ;). I manage to live without the mouse on the console
2005-11-17T13:36:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	i cant, debian instilled that in me ;)
2005-11-17T13:37:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	^
2005-11-17T13:37:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	i am not sure is loadkeys because that is not keymaps is just for key configurations right?
2005-11-17T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	caonex	i don't understand that question ;). Read 'man loadkeys' for info
2005-11-17T13:38:00.000Z	caonex	HappyFool	i am reading it
