2011-03-07T18:37:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	Why you be using windows shares?
2011-03-07T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 i use windows shares to let the wifes media players find her 'Little House On the Prarrie' videos...
2011-03-07T18:38:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	wifes?
2011-04-08T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 for starters - give more details.
2011-04-08T21:52:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	Well my torrents are slow so I maxed out the peers to 300 per torrent and 3000 overall, but when I torrent and a while after I stop my network gets like under 1KB/s
2011-04-08T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 try a differnt client perhaps.
2011-04-08T22:00:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	would more peers cause connection problems?
2011-04-09T00:00:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	yes it will if you do sudo apt-get --purge remove firefox
2011-04-09T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 Hmm.. I dont think so..   Never noticed any options to scan every home dir and  remove files.
2011-04-09T00:01:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	--purge removes all settings and configuration
2011-04-09T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 not USER settings.. but system settings
2011-04-09T00:03:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	let's see
2011-04-09T00:13:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	I have all the others
2011-04-09T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 twm was supposed to get 'compositing' support a few months back :)
2011-04-09T00:15:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	lxdm loads in under a second
2011-05-19T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 run vlc from a terminal. try to play video. look for error messages.
2011-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	other players play the HD videos but they lag very very bad and get like 2fps
2011-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	dragon player gets around 57fps
2011-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	2fps is basically not playing
2011-05-19T16:40:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	number of reference frames exceeds max (probably corrupt input), discarding one
2011-05-19T16:40:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Dr_Willis	I get that ALOT
2011-05-19T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rcmaehl	 could be some flakey encodeing or a bad file. No idea why dragon wouldent have the same issue
