2008-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	puff		One of these days, RSN, I'm going to start a ubuntu-for-java-developers site/forum/whatever.
2008-02-06T11:16:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	ubuntuforums receives funding from canonical
2008-02-06T11:16:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	Ah, cool.
2008-02-12T12:10:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	maybe?
2008-02-12T12:17:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	I'm working on uninstalling the ATI drivers and going back to the ubuntu restricted ATI drivers
2008-02-12T12:17:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	good luck
2008-02-12T12:17:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	Thanks :-)
2008-02-12T12:17:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	sorry, I've tried to do that and failed.. :(
2008-02-12T12:18:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	Really?  What'd you end up doing?
2008-02-12T12:18:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	going back to the latest drivers - they're the only ones I could get to work
2008-02-12T12:18:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	Latest as in the latest in ubuntu's apt servers or the latest from ati's site?
2008-02-12T12:19:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	latest as in from ati's site
2008-02-12T12:19:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	the ubuntu ones didn't want to play
2008-02-12T12:19:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	Ah, I'm trying the drivers from ATI's site right now, but the performance sucks and is glitchy to boot.
2008-02-12T12:19:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	tell me about it. what card do you hae?
2008-02-12T12:19:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	I'm on a thinkpad t43p with ATI firegl v3200.
2008-02-12T12:20:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	I've got a compaq v2000 with a 200m
2008-02-12T12:20:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	although I have to say, the drivers work much better on faster computers, I find
2008-02-12T12:21:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	The ubuntu gutsy restricve worked great, but suspend didn't work.  Somebody suggested trying the ATI from-the-ati-site drivers but those are turning to be worse... unless I'm missing some kind of config change or something.
2008-02-12T12:22:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	that's about what I found -- I never knew why the latest were so much slower
2008-02-12T12:22:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	I'm about ready to give up on them (unless you have suggestions).  I'm trying to figure out just how to revert... thinking maybe "apt-get remove" on each of the custom ATI driver packages.
2008-02-12T12:22:00.000Z	puff	compwiz18	As a start.
2008-02-12T12:23:00.000Z	compwiz18	puff	that's what I'd suggest... again, good luck :)
