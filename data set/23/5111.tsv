2007-02-16T13:03:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	first thing to check is the physical connection. Powered hub lost power?

2007-02-16T13:05:00.000Z	ralinki	soundray	any idea ?
2007-02-16T13:05:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	have you tried in another USB socket?
2007-02-16T13:06:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	is it just the one device? Or do you have several that  don't work?
2007-02-16T13:08:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	is it just the one device? Or do you have several that  don't work?
2007-02-16T13:08:00.000Z	ralinki	soundray	several
2007-02-16T13:09:00.000Z	ralinki	soundray	so ?
2007-02-16T13:10:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	I think your USB root hub is hung. I suggest you do a cold reboot. And be a little more patient, please.
2007-02-16T13:10:00.000Z	ralinki	soundray	no problems
2007-02-16T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	cold?
2007-02-16T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	turn it off all the way, then turn it on again
2007-02-16T13:12:00.000Z	ralinki	soundray	yeah already done
2007-02-16T13:13:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	did you say that it works in Windows? Or just your devices work in Windows?
2007-02-16T13:13:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	so the USB hardware on your ubuntu machine may be faulty
2007-02-16T13:14:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	it could have broken 55 minutes ago.
2007-02-16T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	if you suspect a driver problem, boot from the live CD and try that
2007-02-16T13:17:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	check lsusb again as well. Does it show there now?
2007-02-16T13:19:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and note the messages as you unplug and insert the device. Any errors?
2007-02-16T13:20:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	you've got faulty USB hardware in your computer.
2007-02-16T13:21:00.000Z	soundray	ralinki	don't paste!
