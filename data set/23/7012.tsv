2006-10-25T14:17:00.000Z	tsoler		ok
2006-10-25T14:17:00.000Z	tsoler		yes
2006-10-25T14:18:00.000Z	tsoler		error:
2006-10-25T14:19:00.000Z	tsoler		only one error
2006-10-25T14:19:00.000Z	tsoler		cant find flex
2006-10-25T14:20:00.000Z	tsoler		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28308/
2006-10-25T14:20:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	sudo apt-get install flex
2006-10-25T14:22:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	that's not an error
2006-10-25T14:24:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	but, nothing. it simply means you have selected the KDE frontend for debconf dialogs, but that isn't working, so it's falling back to the text-mode frontend. which is fine.
2006-10-25T14:26:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	type "make"
2006-10-25T14:29:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	no, run "sudo checkinstall" in the source directory. DO NOT interrupt, it, ever.
2006-10-25T14:41:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	yeah, as i said, i gave you the wrong packagename, try byacc
2006-10-25T14:39:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	sudo apt-get install yacc
2006-10-25T14:40:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	no such package actually, try byacc perhaps
2006-11-16T11:24:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	look at your private messages....
2007-01-31T14:40:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	that's a weird question, i don't think you can do that (or it would make sense to). at most you can possibly install the server kernel on your desktop Ubuntu, but that's probably much less than adviced
2007-01-31T14:40:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	now that's a different question
2007-01-31T14:40:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	just install apache2
2007-01-31T14:41:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	apache2 is an HTTP daemon, also known as a web server.
2007-01-31T14:41:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	apt-get install apache2, unless you want version 1
2007-01-31T14:44:00.000Z	LjL	tsoler	having no idea what that is, i have a hard time answering that. if it's a web application, though, you most certainly need a web server to serve it -- whether it's apache or something else will not much matter, but apache is the most widely used web server in the world
