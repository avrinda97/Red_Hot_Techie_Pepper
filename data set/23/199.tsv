2012-08-29T03:08:00.000Z	JessicaW		is there any way to disable the notification of a new release? "New release 'precise' available."
2012-08-29T03:08:00.000Z	JessicaW		yup. that's your proble3m
2012-08-29T03:08:00.000Z	JessicaW		*problem
2012-08-29T03:09:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	you can turn them of in Synaptic Settings :)
2012-08-29T03:10:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	did that already. still shows up
2012-08-29T03:10:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	sudo apt-get update
2012-08-29T03:14:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	I'm a tard. That did it. Thanks.
2012-08-29T03:16:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	np :)
2012-08-29T03:18:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	chroot changes your root... so it wont mess with your current installation :)
2012-08-29T03:19:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	even if it installs a daemon and starts it?
2012-08-29T03:19:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	yes
2012-08-29T03:19:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	well awesome! Answers that question. thanks!
2012-08-29T03:19:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	np, ArchLinux is installed that way nowadays :)
2012-08-29T03:20:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	I'm setting up 10.04 in a HPC cluster and I need a resource management daemon to run on both the server/head-node and the compute nodes which are loaded via nfs
2012-08-29T03:28:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	hmmm. If I chroot into the image, there's no path for the compilers and it errors out.
2012-08-29T03:29:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	you need to debootstrap build-essentials, as it isn't part of the base installation anymore :)
2012-08-29T03:29:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	bah. I'll just install it and purge it when done
2012-08-29T03:30:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	It doesn't take that much space... so why not leave it :)
2012-08-29T03:31:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	I guess I could. I just want to keep the image very very small. All these servers are doing is processing. no writing to hdd or use of memory other than to support CPUs.
2012-08-29T03:32:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	well... they all use the same image on nfs, so there's not that much overhead really (done it already, on Arch thou)
2012-08-29T03:33:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	good point. It's only a few MB it looks like.
2012-08-29T03:35:00.000Z	bkc_	JessicaW	a compiler is always good to have on a compute-cluster ;)
2012-08-29T03:38:00.000Z	JessicaW	bkc_	I'm noticing that. I think I'll leave it. :D
