2005-09-28T08:31:00.000Z	nomed		hi all
2005-09-28T08:31:00.000Z	nomed		from what i'm reading ubuntu will and doesn't use xdebconfigurator ... is there any other script that can generate an xorg.conf file for a livecd?
2005-09-28T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	it generates it by default...
2005-09-28T08:33:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	should i write something in any runlevel scripts?
2005-09-28T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	on the livecd? no
2005-09-28T08:34:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	i'm not using tha ubuntu livecd ... as base.
2005-09-28T08:35:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	what?
2005-09-28T08:37:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	if your question is "I'm making some random derivative of the livecd and I don't know what I'm doing", you're asking in the wrong place
2005-09-28T08:39:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	i'm switching from xfree to xorg ... i was using morphix mkxf86config script .. then i've tryed out dexconf + xdebconfigurator ..
2005-09-28T08:39:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	then #morphix
2005-09-28T08:40:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	if you just want to make a working live cd, base it on ubuntu and strip whatever you don't want
2005-10-08T08:49:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	that probably means you're trying to load modules built for the actual ubuntu kernel
2005-10-08T08:49:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	also, the ubuntu kernel includes usplash
2005-10-08T08:50:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	i'm waiting for breezy release to use usplash
2005-10-08T08:51:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	waiting 9 days seems like a lot less hassle
2005-10-08T08:55:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	CONFIG_IEEE1394_SBP2=m .. and with modprobe sbp2 i have the Symbol Unknow error .. do you know what can it be?
2005-10-08T08:56:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	this sounds like you're just not building the kernel properly
2005-10-08T08:59:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	make sure you're setting a suffix with make-kpkg
2005-10-08T09:01:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	make-kpkg kernel_image (/usr/bin/gcc -> gcc-3.4 )
2005-10-08T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	what?
2005-10-08T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	nomed	--append-to-version
2005-10-08T09:01:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	the cmd i use to generate the kernel deb pkge
2005-10-08T09:04:00.000Z	nomed	bob2	what can it change if i use nomed: --append-to-version ? :/
