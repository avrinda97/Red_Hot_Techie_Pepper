2011-07-18T10:58:00.000Z	lollab		hello, I mounted an external harddrive through smbmount, but arabic characters are showed with ???? marks, anybody can help?
2011-07-18T10:59:00.000Z	wildbat	lollab	smbmoun to mount external HDD?~ you mean windows share right?
2011-07-18T10:59:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	yes the harddrive exports data via windows share
2011-07-18T11:00:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	Autodidactite file names with arabic names seen as ????.doc
2011-07-18T11:01:00.000Z	wildbat	lollab	you didn't set the character set
2011-07-18T11:03:00.000Z	wildbat	lollab	mount with mount option "iocharset=utf8"
2011-07-18T11:04:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	oh thank you, I seen this in the man page, but didn't know what iocharset
2011-07-18T11:04:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	let me try , few mins
2011-07-18T11:07:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	unfortunately, didn't work out
2011-07-18T11:07:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	the command accepted however
2011-07-18T11:08:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	this is the command: smbmount //192.168.1.253/users /media/HD_users/ -o username=xyz,password=abc,iocharset=utf8
2011-07-18T11:08:00.000Z	wildbat	lollab	what version of windows you use ~? you may have to try other codepages.
2011-07-18T11:10:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	the harddrive doens't run windows, its an external disk with network interface and people just get into share and find files. I'm trying to mount in order to copy the files to my system
2011-07-18T11:11:00.000Z	wildbat	lollab	can't gnome nautilus automount it ?
2011-07-18T11:12:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	actually no gnome installed , I have ubuntu server
2011-07-18T11:12:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	do you suggest to install one?
2011-07-18T11:13:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	I will try to use mount -t cifs
2011-07-18T11:16:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	ops!  I figured that I'm on the directory mounted, I was umount while I'm in the directory itselt :)
2011-07-18T11:16:00.000Z	wildbat	lollab	so it worked?
2011-07-18T11:16:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	iocharset worked correctly, thank you!
2011-07-18T11:17:00.000Z	wildbat	lollab	lol~ good for you , i think they should have make utf8 as default by now ~ but oh well ~
2011-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	yes it worked, yes it should be by default
2011-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	lollab	wildbat	thanks
