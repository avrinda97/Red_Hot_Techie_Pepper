2010-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	boot to livecd and reinstall grub
2010-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	but i cant access my internal harddrives with livecd?
2010-04-30T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	you can boot to cd though which you need to do (or usb)
2010-04-30T23:35:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	Ok, but is it possible to mount from harddrive then, so I can reinstall grub?
2010-04-30T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	you don't needs to mount the partition dude ;)
2010-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	ah ok. so just use livecd and "apt-get install --reinstall grub" then?
2010-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	thanks for help
2010-05-01T00:22:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	can i PM you about the grub boot problem?
2012-01-25T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	does it happen for all users?
2012-01-25T01:29:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	Only have one user.
2012-01-25T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	make a fresh user, your OS can hold literally billions of local users
2012-01-25T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	I don't type that fast.I just pretyped it as it is a common reply..
2012-01-25T01:29:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	;)
2012-01-25T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	did you really think a modern OS would only support one user..
2012-01-25T01:30:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	Ofcourse not, but I don't see why it would do any differance
2012-01-25T01:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	the new user would get default settings, if it works there then your settings are at fault, if not then it is the application itself
2012-01-25T01:32:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	I see. Is there any way to just set the settings to default on the current user?
2012-01-25T01:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Promille	not sure there
2012-01-25T01:33:00.000Z	Promille	ActionParsnip	Thanks though
