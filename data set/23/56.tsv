2012-11-20T02:07:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		Hi!
2012-11-20T02:07:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		Is there a way to check when a new update was available.
2012-11-20T02:07:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		All I can see from synaptic is the version name, I want the date as well.
2012-11-20T02:09:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	i guess looking with a browser on the repo and the timestamp when the package was created is one way, another is "apt-get changelog packagename" but when it was installed on the system is not that easy to find out, only with parsing logfiles
2012-11-20T02:09:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		No I don't mean when it is installed, I can see it from apt/synaptic.
2012-11-20T02:10:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		I want to see when a package was released, preferably without going to package maintainers' website
2012-11-20T02:10:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	apt-get changelog packagename
2012-11-20T02:11:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		It displays the same text from synaptic.
2012-11-20T02:12:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	and what is wrong with that information?
2012-11-20T02:12:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		It does say the package version, yes, but not when it was released/made available.

2012-11-20T02:13:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	that is the changelog from vim, is 27.04.2012 10:17:02 not enough?
2012-11-20T02:14:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		Actually, let me try that with another package.
2012-11-20T02:14:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	the changelog-syntax is always the same for every package
2012-11-20T02:15:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		Hmm, it is easy to see when I try it firefox.
2012-11-20T02:15:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		But not for chromium.

2012-11-20T02:18:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	i dont see the problem, as i said, its always the same syntax, always the last line under the changed
2012-11-20T02:19:00.000Z	ElixirVitae	iceroot	that was way in the bottom of the changelog, I thought it should be near the top.
2012-11-20T02:19:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		Many thanks~
2012-11-20T02:19:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		Found it as well.
2012-11-20T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	its always the last line for a changelisting
2012-11-20T02:19:00.000Z	iceroot	ElixirVitae	syntax is version \n changelisting \n autor + date
