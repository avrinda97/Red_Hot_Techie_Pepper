2012-02-26T14:53:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	That is interesting
2012-02-26T14:54:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	more of the "that's too complex, let's baby the users" syndrome I guess
2012-02-26T14:54:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	Yea their talk of getting rid of ccsm as an effort to ignore bugs instead of fix them is laughable as well
2012-02-26T15:03:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	where are you seeing evidence of that?
2012-02-26T15:03:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	I thought google-chrome wast in standard repos
2012-02-26T15:04:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	no, he DOES have an unsupported ppa setup...that's not what's causing the issue though (as far as I can see).  The issue is because debconf won't run because it thinks it's locked
2012-02-26T15:05:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	My suggestion is to remove the ppa since its unsupported to begin with.. then install the deb manually
2012-02-26T15:06:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	if the ppa was what was causing the issue, I might agree...I'm not seeing how this is going to help though
2012-02-26T15:06:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	Basically I dont want to advocate wildly using ppas for any package a new user might want
2012-02-26T15:06:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	that's not the same thing as proactively telling users to remove any ppa you disapprove of
2012-02-26T15:07:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	IIRC it asks you if you want to so that you can get updates
2012-02-26T15:08:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	Fair enough, I will leave it to those more experienced in this area
2012-02-26T15:08:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	ie. No one else was helping so I decided to try but since you are here now, go for it
2012-02-26T15:09:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	nothing wrong with helping.  Just be caregful that the help you give is accurate :)
2012-02-26T15:09:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	How is suggesting that an unsupported ppa is by definition.. unsupported and should be removed, not accurate?
2012-02-26T15:10:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	there is NOTHING to say that unsupported repos have to be removed
2012-02-26T15:10:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	and the unsupported repo was not the cause of his problem
2012-02-26T15:10:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	Well to get support from me, you have to remove unsupported repos fistly
2012-02-26T15:11:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	why?
2012-02-26T15:11:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	Dude I dont understand why you are attacking me. Make yourself useful and go help someone instead of nitpicking my methods
2012-02-26T15:12:00.000Z	ssta	soreau	if you feel attacked, I apologise.
2012-02-26T15:12:00.000Z	soreau	ssta	I do now please drop it
