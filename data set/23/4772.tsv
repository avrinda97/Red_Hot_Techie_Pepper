2009-02-09T03:13:00.000Z	cjae		is anyone running the newest version of google earth successfully, I believe it is 4.3?
2009-02-09T03:13:00.000Z	cjae		well newest from medibuntu
2009-02-09T03:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	newest version of Earth is 5.0. It is a lot faster than 4.3
2009-02-09T03:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	But, I've run all versions without problems
2009-02-09T03:15:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	ok but it keeps crashing for me and says I don't have ttf-bitstream-vera installed and I do, I works if you switch it to sky but not earth
2009-02-09T03:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	What Ubuntu release is that on? Intrepid or Hardy or... ?
2009-02-09T03:16:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	intrepid and I can't find any info about on google either,
2009-02-09T03:18:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	I assume maybe that there is something missing from my auto generated xorg.conf but I have everything else working, and no onboard graphics (nvidia card)
2009-02-09T03:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	As an experiment, create a new *clean* user account, log-in as that user, and try Earth. If that works at least you'll know it is a user-profile issue. On the other hand, it might prove it is a system issue
2009-02-09T03:20:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	it in kde 4.2 which is buggy to say the least but I have read ppl with similar issue but no kde and no followup
2009-02-10T04:50:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	you around, I see I assume that you are the one that made the ms vx6000 .deb file?
2009-02-10T04:50:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	can I get that for ibex?
2009-02-10T04:52:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	I have a person that will completely drop windows if that web cam will work under ibex
2009-02-10T04:54:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	I'm not sure about the vx6000 - I did some packages months ago for someone to test but don't have access to the cam myself
2009-02-10T05:00:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	you had a hardy package but I can't seem to install it under ibex?
2009-02-10T05:01:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	I think the kernel interface may have changed
2009-02-10T05:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	see what genii said
2009-02-10T05:07:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	so there is no way to get it to work? this where I found it http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5826879&postcount=4
2009-02-10T05:19:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	not trying to nag, I have other possible solutions but I was just wondering if there was a way to install that pkg for ibex, but you said that there see what genni said and I didn't catch till just now whos genni
2009-02-10T05:20:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	"<genii> IntuitiveNipple: The vx6000 worked on my 8.10 box using the Microdia driver"
2009-02-10T05:21:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	so how do I install the driver?
2009-02-10T05:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	cjae	I don't know, I only packaged it once to help someone test it. It will depend on which source-code you use. I made it simple by using DKMS but most others expect you to use manual build tools
2009-02-10T05:23:00.000Z	cjae	IntuitiveNipple	ok thanks
