2010-09-24T18:30:00.000Z	Typh		alright, I've asked this like 1000 times, but maybe today's my lucky day: since upgrading to lucid, clicking on title bars is totally buggy. My clicks often go through and select the window beneath, or some other completely random window. I'll double click to maximize/minizine, and a different app will do that instead. What is going on? This has been across over 5 systems, clean installs.
2010-09-24T18:31:00.000Z	Typh		hehe
2010-09-24T18:31:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	5 different computers? Did you use the same CD/DVD to install?
2010-09-24T18:34:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	Weird
2010-09-24T18:34:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	indeed. It makes me go crazy, and no one seems to know what I'm talking about :(
2010-09-24T18:35:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	Did you use same ISO file to install on all systems?
2010-09-24T18:36:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	no. Likely fresh download each time, hash checked
2010-09-24T18:37:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	More weird. Fresh downloaded install across different type of hardware and still same problem
2010-09-24T18:37:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	Did you try upgrading one of them to maverick and check if the problem exists?
2010-09-24T18:37:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	not yet. I can certainly give it a shot.
2010-09-24T18:38:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	Try that. One more thing, are you testing using the same mouse by any chance?
2010-09-24T18:38:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	Lol
2010-09-24T18:39:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	But no other person has got the same problem on Lucid.. Try maverick.
2010-09-24T18:40:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	When you boot using Live option, does it have the same problem?
2010-09-24T18:43:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	:), sorry
2010-09-24T18:43:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	That moves window on mine. Do you install anything after fresh install? Some kind if script?
2010-09-24T18:44:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	no. and it's inconsistent. I can't narrow down any behaviour that makes it happen.
2010-09-24T18:46:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	Can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2010-09-24T18:49:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	http://pastebin.com/jV9Q8Gqz
2010-09-24T18:53:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	and my laptop http://pastebin.com/DiXJyJPv
2010-09-24T18:58:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	That doesn't show anything :(
2010-09-24T18:59:00.000Z	Typh	dpac_	tell me about it, heh.
2010-09-24T19:02:00.000Z	dpac_	Typh	There's no input section. It must be in /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-*
