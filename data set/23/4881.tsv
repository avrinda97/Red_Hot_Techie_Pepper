2008-01-18T09:12:00.000Z	corinth		Is there a way to set different wallpapers for dual monitors in Ubuntu Gutsy?
2008-01-18T09:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	if you figure out a way to do that, let me know... seems... I ended up just doing some gimp work on my wallpapers, and merged two wallpapers, into 1 file, and it looks pretty good.
2008-01-18T09:15:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	I don't mind doing that, but is there a way to move a pasted image to a specific spot? Like, +1440 pixels?
2008-01-18T09:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	now that i don't know.
2008-11-08T11:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	have you tried madwifi?
2008-11-08T11:46:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	No, how do I enable that?
2008-11-08T11:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	can you not hook it up via ethernet cable for 10min?
2008-11-08T11:47:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	Nope. I don't have access to the router. One sec, ziroday.
2008-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	there's a lot of threads on ubuntuforums to get that device working, i have it and it works fine...
2008-11-08T11:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	are you still here?
2008-11-08T11:55:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	Yup. Did I miss a suggustion?
2008-11-08T11:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	no, i'm trying to find something.
2008-11-08T11:55:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	Ah, thanks for all the help. :-)
2008-11-08T11:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	i know how to nstall the device(its actually quite easy), problem is doing it w/o internet access
2008-11-08T11:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	that won't work unfortunately(well it might, but it would be a serious pain in the..)
2008-11-08T11:57:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	Alright, tell me how to do it, then. I'll see if I can get to an ethernet cable sometime soon.
2008-11-08T12:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	are you using 64bit?
2008-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	then you should learn to read instructions clearly, i doubt thats gonna work w/ 64bit...
2008-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	did you disable the driver that it told you to?
2008-11-08T12:03:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	Yup.
2008-11-08T12:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	well, i've done that on 3 different PCs(2 are mine), w/o issue at all and 32bit.
2008-11-08T12:36:00.000Z	corinth	IndyGunFreak	ziroday, works great. Thanks. :)
2008-11-08T12:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corinth	good to hear... i figured it would work fine w/ 32bit.
