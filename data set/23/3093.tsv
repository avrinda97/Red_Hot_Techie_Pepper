2008-07-31T15:52:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	rm
2008-07-31T15:53:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	uhh... rm -r
2008-07-31T18:21:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	what are you trying to install?
2008-07-31T18:21:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	 drivers for canon ip1500
2008-07-31T18:22:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	tried plugging it in?
2008-07-31T18:22:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	sure?
2008-07-31T18:22:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	Most digital cameras are supported by default... nothing pops up?
2008-07-31T18:22:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	 it's printer
2008-07-31T18:22:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	ahhhh
2008-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	It's in the Gutenprint package according to http://www.openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Canon-iP1500
2008-07-31T18:26:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	Which is installed by default... so just try to set it up.
2008-07-31T18:27:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	actually, it's part of the openprinting.org package now... but it's there I'd bet
2008-07-31T18:28:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	This isn't Windows, you don't have to spend a week installing drivers
2008-07-31T18:28:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	doesn't work
2008-07-31T18:29:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	What have you tried?
2008-07-31T18:29:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	 like manually selecting to use drivers for canon ip1500
2008-07-31T18:30:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	Do you have any other printers? I recommend an HP printer, they actually put money behind such things
2008-07-31T18:31:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	 what's wrong with getting an i386 lib when I dont have one in the directory?
2008-07-31T18:32:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	you aren't using i386
2008-07-31T18:32:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	 yes, but aint packages in lib32 designed for i386?
2008-07-31T18:34:00.000Z	fde	RainyLithuanian	sure... if you're compiling, you can define the /lib32 dir ... good luck tracking down everything though... just reinstall with the x86 version if I was you... this isn't the first headache you'll have.
2008-07-31T18:38:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	fde	this isn't my first headache I got
