2007-09-14T10:38:00.000Z	Oswy		Hey, I'm having a problem with Synaptic, can someone help me please?
2007-09-14T10:38:00.000Z	Oswy		None of the packages are showing up at all.
2007-09-14T10:39:00.000Z	Oswy		I can paste the error message if needed.
2007-09-14T10:40:00.000Z	Oswy		Anyone? It should be a pretty quick fix, just adding something in a file somewhere, but I have no idea how.
2007-09-14T10:42:00.000Z	Oswy		Still have the same error message.
2007-09-14T10:42:00.000Z	Oswy		"E: The package virtualbox needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
2007-09-14T10:42:00.000Z	Oswy		E: Internal error opening cache (1). Please report."
2007-09-14T10:42:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	Looks like you'll have to download the virtualbox deb again and reinstall it.
2007-09-14T10:43:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	How did you install it the first time?
2007-09-14T10:44:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	Do you use it?
2007-09-14T10:44:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	What I'm asking is, do you want to keep it or get rid of it? :P
2007-09-14T10:47:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	I'd recommend "aptitude remove virtualbox" then "aptitude update" and "aptitude upgrade"
2007-09-14T10:49:00.000Z	Oswy	Viaken	"E: I wasn't able to locate a file for the virtualbox package. This might mean you need to manually fix this package. (due to missing arch)
2007-09-14T10:51:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	You'll have to sudo all those, sorry, but that doesn't look like it's going to work... How about "dpkg -r virtualbox"?
2007-09-14T10:56:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	Have you changed your repos recently?
2007-09-14T10:59:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	Let me poke around a bit here.
2007-09-14T11:06:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	Don't suppose you know what version it was?
2007-09-14T11:06:00.000Z	Oswy	Viaken	Nope, sorry.
2007-09-14T11:07:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	The site says 1.5.0 is current. 1.4.0 seems to be in the repos? Try going to http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and downloading the "Fiesty Fawn" deb and reinstalling it.
2007-09-14T11:17:00.000Z	Oswy	Viaken	Hmm, how do I open a program as root?
2007-09-14T11:18:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	"gksudo VBox" I think
2007-09-14T11:20:00.000Z	Viaken	Oswy	Oh, if you haven't installed the deb, you'll need to "sudo dpkg -i debname.deb"
2007-09-14T11:21:00.000Z	Oswy	Viaken	k, it's installed.
