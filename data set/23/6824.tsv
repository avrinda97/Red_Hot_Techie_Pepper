2007-03-04T06:20:00.000Z	kane77		i have a problem with disapearing dns... I'm on dapper.
2007-03-04T06:22:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	you know about /etc/resolv.conf ?
2007-03-04T06:23:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	yes I know of it, but mine said that it is generated and shouldn't be manualy edited...
2007-03-04T06:23:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	Do you have two network devices going (wifi & eth) bye any chance?
2007-03-04T06:24:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	yes I have and I use both (i use wifi for internet connection and eth0 for sharing internet connection)
2007-03-04T06:25:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	I know I can edit it but when I setup the dns they work, only after reset/poweroff they disapear...
2007-03-04T06:28:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	st0n3cutt3r_ sorry got to sleep soon. If you can take the machine to a LAN then things would be easier.
2007-03-04T06:28:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	ok, good night then
2007-03-04T06:28:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	resolv.conf is overwriten by dhclient so if you change your network settings to static rather than dhcp you could keep them.
2007-03-04T06:29:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	that was exactly it, I dont use dhcp... (neither my isp)
2007-03-04T06:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	are both your network cards set statically?
2007-03-04T06:30:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	yes
2007-03-04T06:31:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	but you say your resolv.conf is being overwritten?
2007-03-04T06:31:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	yes
2007-03-04T06:31:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	that's why I think its strange....
2007-03-04T06:31:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	I agree.
2007-03-04T06:32:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	could it be the vmware that causes that? (it added some network devices..)
2007-03-04T06:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	Here's mine: http://rafb.net/p/R8yDRR61.html
2007-03-04T06:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	no to vmware (i think)
2007-03-04T06:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	Sorry I won't be much use atm. I really must sleep.
2007-03-04T06:33:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	ok, bye
2007-03-04T06:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	kane77	Short term solution would be to run a script that changed it on boot. Maybe a line in /etc/rc.local
2007-03-04T06:35:00.000Z	kane77	gyaresu	okay, Ill try that anyways I plan to reinstall after feisty is released...
