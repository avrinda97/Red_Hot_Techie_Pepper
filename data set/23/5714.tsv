2006-09-27T07:52:00.000Z	starleaf		What package should I choose when downloading perl? AS, DEB or RPM?
2006-09-27T07:53:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	clearly its deb ... why bother downloading ? perl is in repo ... and unless i am mistaken its in ubuntu by default
2006-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	Apparently not in the version I downloaded yesterday... trying to install the "cube" desktop, but first it said that I didn't have C and now it wants perl...
2006-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	what version of perl is it asking for ?
2006-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	Sorry, it just says this and exits: "XML::Parser perl module is required for intltool"
2006-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	thats a perl module .. not perl
2006-09-27T07:56:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	pls look for that module in synaptic and then install it
2006-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	Let me guess... browsing thrugh Howtos again?
2006-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	synaptic .. not hot-to
2006-09-27T07:58:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	:)
2006-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	sudo
2006-09-27T08:03:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	when you use synaptic it asks for the password isnt it ?
2006-09-27T08:14:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	what error message says you don't have gtk2.0 ?
2006-09-27T08:15:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	the ./conf I run to setup for the "cube" says No package 'gtk+-2.0' found
2006-09-27T08:16:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	the "cube" ... it isn't in the repo ?
2006-09-27T08:16:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	along with a whole bunch of other things it needs...
2006-09-27T08:17:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	pls check if there is a ubuntu or debian package for that ... before compiling ...
2006-09-27T08:17:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	If it went into repo half an hour ago, from whereI got it a post two days ago said mem leak was fixed and it was stable
2006-09-27T08:17:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	I have tried, but I dont know what to search for other than "aiglx"
2006-09-27T08:20:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	It's a graphical verion of the four desktops you usualy have in a linux WM but instead of clicking on the icons to switch desktop you just rotate it
2006-09-27T08:20:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	starleaf	you talking about xgl ?
2006-09-27T08:21:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	You tell me, I just saw a picture of it and wanted to try it...
2006-09-27T08:22:00.000Z	starleaf	wickedpuppy	Thanks! :D
