2010-01-11T15:58:00.000Z	bjlen		is it normal for ubuntu 9.10 to run at 40-80% CPU all the time (i currently have Xchat, firefox and system monitor open on a 1ghz laptop with intell 855GM and 1GB ram)?
2010-01-11T16:00:00.000Z	bjlen		myrtti - thanks. i think i removed some old kernels with just 'remove' - does that matter? i'm wondering whether there are some config files i now need to manually delete?
2010-01-11T16:01:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	it might be a good thing.. ie if the cpu is downclocked so that firefox and xchat uses about 50% of the available cpu
2010-01-11T16:01:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	it might also be that firefox is eating lots of cpu cycles while the cpu is running full speed.. that would be a bad thing
2010-01-11T16:03:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	say you have a cpu that is marked for 2.5 GHz.. if your laptop goes into powersaving mode it might be downclocked to 400MHz instead.. then firefox will use 20% of the lower speed which seems much but in reality it isn't that much since the cpu is going much slower than normal
2010-01-11T16:04:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	there are some apps that might show you the current power saving state.. I haven't used those since I upgraded to 9.10 though so I can't help you with specifics
2010-01-29T20:42:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	disable the firewall? how do you do that?
2010-01-29T20:43:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	you can clear the firewall rules but I'm not sure on how to disable it
2010-01-29T20:43:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	that probably doesn't disable the firewall
2010-01-29T20:45:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	if you open a terminal and run "sudo iptables -L" it will write out the rules that you have configured
2010-01-29T20:46:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	I'm not sure what that enabled/disabled setting actually does.. but I'm pretty sure it doesn't disable the firewall.. it might remove any rules you've set by using the gufw tool.. or it might clear out all the rules.. but it doesn't disable the firewall
2010-01-29T20:48:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	ok.. by default you don't have to do anything to "open" ports.. the firewall doesn't block anything by default
2010-01-29T20:49:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	you can change the default behaviour if you want.. that's the POLICY setting.. it can be set to ALLOW, DENY or REJECT ... that's what happens if you don't have any rules specifying anything else
2010-01-29T20:50:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	ubuntu doesn't block any ports by default.. you might have a router between your computer and the internet though.. that might act as a firewall
2010-01-29T20:51:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	that means.. if you have an ubuntu computer connected DIRECTLY to the internet (that directly part is important) you don't have to do anything for transmission to work
2010-01-29T20:52:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	most people don't have their computer connected directly to the internet though.. you use some kind of router, usually so you can get internet connections to more than one computer.. that device has a firewall/router
2010-01-29T20:52:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	you're welcome
2010-01-29T20:53:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	there is a site for doing port-forwarding..  http://portforward.com  it has instructions for several different routers
2010-01-29T20:54:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	correct
2010-01-29T20:58:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	if you use sudo you'll change the settings for root.. to change the settings for your user you just run gconf-editor without gksudo
2010-01-29T21:00:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	correct
2010-01-29T21:02:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	hmm.. I have a laptop with ubuntu 8.10 .. but I've never tried those settings
2010-01-29T21:02:00.000Z	Slart	bjlen	not really sure what to look for
