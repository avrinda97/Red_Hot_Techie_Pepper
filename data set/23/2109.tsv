2009-12-28T16:32:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	what do you get from:  for dir in /media/Dane/Music/*/; do echo $dir ; done
2009-12-28T16:33:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	I mean, if it says file not found there could be just a proper location of where the action is performed
2009-12-28T16:35:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	I did copy and paste and did listed all the directory's where there is wav files in them
2009-12-28T16:36:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	yes, but does it give the full pathname or just the final part ?
2009-12-28T16:36:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	because, if I'm correct, later on you "cd" to the needed directory
2009-12-28T16:37:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	this is the listing I get: /media/Dane/Music/Pete Philly And Perquisite/
2009-12-28T16:37:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	and many more directory's
2009-12-28T16:38:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	you get them as:   /media/Dane/Music/Pete     /media/Dane/Music/Philly     and so on ?
2009-12-28T16:38:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	yes sorry
2009-12-28T16:39:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	and Pete is a directory where there is wav and .cue file
2009-12-28T16:39:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	I see
2009-12-28T16:40:00.000Z	Night_Elf		and you have the split2flac.sh  in  /media/Dane/Music      ?
2009-12-28T16:40:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	yes
2009-12-28T16:41:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	by the way it lists all the directory's and not only the ones containing flac
2009-12-28T16:42:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	and in each dir, how many files are there ending with .cue ?
2009-12-28T16:42:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	in each of those dirs you get listed ?
2009-12-28T16:45:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	the directory's where there is a big .wav file there is also one .cue file. but I also have few directory's where the big .wav file is already splitted to wav and there is no .cue file
2009-12-28T16:47:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	was I clear enough or shall I explain more?
2009-12-28T16:49:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	I think I understand, but now then, how is that shell script supposed to be called and what does it do ?
2009-12-28T16:50:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	and also, under the  /media/Dane/Music/Pete  there's one or more .cue files ?
2009-12-28T16:53:00.000Z	xukun	Night_Elf	I first go to the directory containing the wav file, copy script to the same directory then I do ./split2flac.sh pete.cue pete.wav. it then splits the wav and ten converts it to flac and removes the wav files. there is only one .cue file in /media/Dane/Music/Pete
2009-12-28T16:55:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	I see. So the shell takes one wav, and converts it to flac. What do you get when  you run:    for dir in /media/Dane/Music/*/*wav ; do echo $dir ; done
2009-12-28T16:55:00.000Z	Night_Elf	xukun	you should get a list with file names ending in wav
