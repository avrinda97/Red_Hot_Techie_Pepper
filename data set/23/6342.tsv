2007-02-11T17:27:00.000Z	Gator		Can someone actually TELL me how to fix this instead of linking me to a non-noob-friendly link?
2007-02-11T17:28:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	fix what?
2007-02-11T17:29:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	apparently I have no fstab file, and I need to create it
2007-02-11T17:29:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	how do you know you have no fstab?
2007-02-11T17:30:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	I got the job control error, so someone told me to cat /etc/fstab and it said no file/directory exists
2007-02-11T17:30:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	try "locate fstab"
2007-02-11T17:31:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	the locate said it wasn't found
2007-02-11T17:33:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	"cd /etc" then "ls" are there files there?
2007-02-11T17:34:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	modprobe.d, evms.conf, udev
2007-02-11T17:35:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	only those?
2007-02-11T17:35:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	ok, how did you boot into ubuntu?
2007-02-11T17:37:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	so, are you stumped?
2007-02-11T17:37:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	as cafuego_ says, you are in busybox probably
2007-02-11T17:38:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	well, I have no idea what that is... I am a complete newb
2007-02-11T17:45:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	Should I just reinstall Ubuntu?
2007-02-11T17:46:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	I didn't have any personal files on it what-so-ever
2007-02-11T17:46:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	did it work when you first intalled it?
2007-02-11T17:46:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	yes, but about a month ago I started getting this error and I just got around to fixing it
2007-02-11T17:47:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	might as well reinstall then
2007-02-11T17:47:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	Can I do that with a live CD without booting from the liveCD?
2007-02-11T17:47:00.000Z	mc44	Gator	nope
2007-02-11T17:47:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	dang, I'll go try again
2007-02-11T17:53:00.000Z	Gator	mc44	my liveCD seems to be stuck on "Uncompressing Linux... OK, boothing the Kernal."
