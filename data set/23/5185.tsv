2007-01-27T12:40:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	you might need to fiddle in the preferences for VLC, sound prefs or codec prefs.
2007-01-28T09:26:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	there might be a "gaim --minimized" option or something, go poking around in gaim documentation
2007-01-28T09:36:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	its called "traceroute" and it isnt installed by default, "sudo apt-get install traceroute"
2007-01-28T09:47:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	absolutely, mount it as vfat in yoru fstab and you're golden
2007-01-28T09:53:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	you mean filesystem?
2007-01-28T09:56:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	there is one, its just not very safe.
2007-01-28T09:56:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	and considering that NTFS is undocumented and bloated and...bad.  People arent tryingi all that hard to write a driver for it.  Only dual-booters care.

2007-01-29T10:42:00.000Z	shifty	shatrat	: is it hard to install ?
2007-01-29T10:42:00.000Z	shatrat	shifty	depends on your hardware, ask in #ubuntu-xgl, its not really a beginner question that would belong here
