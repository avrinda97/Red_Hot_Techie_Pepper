2006-05-12T14:38:00.000Z	iNiku		you see the line for your fat32 partition?
2006-05-12T14:38:00.000Z	iNiku		paste it here
2006-05-12T14:40:00.000Z	iNiku		how are you doing that?
2006-05-12T14:41:00.000Z	iNiku		the disks admin thing probably edits /etc/fstab
2006-05-12T14:42:00.000Z	iNiku		because if you didn't, it should be in /etc/fstab
2006-05-12T14:42:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	I would suspect it just temporarily mounts them...(disk-admin)
2006-05-12T14:43:00.000Z	iNiku	mustard5	possible, I have no idea about disk admin
2006-05-12T14:43:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	yeah..I'm pretty sure its just the GUI equivalent of a mount command
2006-05-12T14:44:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	you will still need to edit fstab or permanent mount
2006-05-12T14:44:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	the output of the moutn command should show the fat partition mounted
2006-05-12T14:44:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	no such feature in gnome unfortutely :)
2006-05-12T14:46:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	no :)
2006-05-12T14:47:00.000Z	iNiku	mustard5	you wanna help him out? I've never even seen the gnome disk admin tool :)
2006-05-12T14:47:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	its not that useful :)
2006-05-12T14:47:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	you were doing well with editing fstab :)
2006-05-12T14:48:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	I just thought I would save you the disappointment of finding the sad features in disk-admin tool :D
2006-05-12T14:48:00.000Z	iNiku	mustard5	hehe, thanks anyway :)
2006-05-12T14:53:00.000Z	iNiku	mustard5	yeah, as long as that's the only line he modifies
2006-05-12T14:53:00.000Z	iNiku	mustard5	screw up /usr or something and things are going to get more complicated
2006-05-12T14:53:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	yeah
2006-05-12T14:54:00.000Z	iNiku	mustard5	unless you want to talk him through fixing his fstab using a statically linked vi :D
2006-05-12T14:54:00.000Z	mustard5	iNiku	heheh..I can't use vi yet either :)
2006-05-12T14:56:00.000Z	iNiku	mustard5	actually I wonder if ubuntu even has a static vi. probably not.
