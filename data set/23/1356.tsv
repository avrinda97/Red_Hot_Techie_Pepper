2010-05-02T18:57:00.000Z	jamieaa64		Also would this work on 10.04 or have the commands changed?
2010-05-02T18:57:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	whats the graphics card? ATI?
2010-05-02T18:57:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	I think it is Intel GMA 500
2010-05-02T18:58:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	Its running pretty slowly though and I've read lots of things (like that URL) that say its not that great until you install this particular driver
2010-05-02T18:58:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	whats the spec of the laptop?
2010-05-02T18:59:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	Its a 1.6ghz intel atom 2gb RAM Sony Vaio P
2010-05-02T18:59:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	Its running slow, (When scrolling in firefox) in a similar way to if you installed windows and didn't install thelatest drivers
2010-05-02T19:00:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	Thanks, I think I'm stuck at the gpg commands. But I don't know if that repository is good for 10.04 (Because it says jaunty)
2010-05-02T19:00:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	 you'll need to change the repo to say lucid instead of jaunty
2010-05-02T19:00:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	Thanks I'll try that
2010-05-02T19:01:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	np mate, let me know if it doesn't work
2010-05-02T19:05:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	that;s the error you get when you paste the command in?
2010-05-02T19:08:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	step 4 and 5 are importing the appropriate gpg keys to authenticate with the respositories, it may be that since Lucid is only JUST released, those repos may not exist yet
2010-05-02T19:08:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	have you tried searching a little harder for a how-to for Lucid instead? You may find it by searching for the chipset rather than the laptop model
2010-05-02T19:09:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	I have and haven't found much, I'll take a look now (but cause lucid is so new there isn't much)
2010-05-02T19:09:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	 here you go http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1330751
2010-05-02T19:10:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	 hmmmmmmmmm doesn't actually fix the problem though
2010-05-02T19:14:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	ok going to go for that thanks for your help! First time use of linux has been a fun experience :D!
2010-05-02T19:14:00.000Z	jamieaa64	HollowPoint	Shame though, I really like the 10.04 purple
2010-05-02T19:15:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	I did it the other week at work because I liked it so much when I installed a 10.04 Beta VM
2010-05-02T19:27:00.000Z	HollowPoint	jamieaa64	your best bet is boot up with a gparted live cd, delete your linux partitions and then boot up with a Karmic live cd and choose the option to install side by side, not positive what that will do with grub though
