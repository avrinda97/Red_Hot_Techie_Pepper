2008-07-29T15:15:00.000Z	assi		ï»¿hello i have a big problem with sudo. Ive installed the hardy heron 8.04 64bit version and this version doesn't had a live CD installation only a text installation. So i installed it with the text and it asked me for a password i gave it ones and then after all it was installed and everytime i will update or change something it asked please passwort and then i write the passwort but then it tells me that : sudo deosnt allow me to use this prg
2008-07-29T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	please do the following "sudo apt-get update" in a terminal, when you type in your password, what is the EXACT error you get please.
2008-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	assi	ikonia	p is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2008-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	ok - so p is not the default user you setup
2008-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	I assume "p" is your username
2008-07-29T15:18:00.000Z	assi	ikonia	yes
2008-07-29T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	p is not the user you setup at install time

2008-07-29T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	that is not the username you setup at install time. What is the username you setup at install time
2008-07-29T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	if you don't know your own user name and password at install time I suggest your re-install and pay close attention to what's being said on screen
2008-07-29T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	that is not the username and password you setup at install time
2008-07-29T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	assi	it's not the right one, you've either a.) got the wrong user from when you installed b.) removed that user from the sudoers file
