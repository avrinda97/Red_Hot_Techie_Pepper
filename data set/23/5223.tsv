2011-03-24T00:32:00.000Z	wild		how do I move a folder from downloads to the opt folder?
2011-03-24T00:33:00.000Z	unop	wild	 sudo mv ~/downloads/your_dir/  /opt/
2011-03-24T00:40:00.000Z	wild	unop	I am getting an error "no such file or directory."
2011-03-24T00:41:00.000Z	unop	wild	where is your downloads directory?
2011-03-24T00:41:00.000Z	unop	wild	under your homedir?
2011-03-24T00:42:00.000Z	wild	unop	yes, I think so, I call it ken
2011-03-24T00:43:00.000Z	wild	unop	/home/ken/downloads/
2011-03-24T00:43:00.000Z	unop	wild	then ...  sudo mv /home/ken/downloads/"your_dir" /opt
2011-03-24T00:44:00.000Z	wild	unop	do I need the quotes?
2011-03-24T00:44:00.000Z	unop	wild	only if you have spaces in the dir name ... also, make sure you have the right case
2011-03-24T00:47:00.000Z	wild	unop	no luck. the exact error is mv: cannot start ~/home/ken/downloads/aptana' : No such file or directory
2011-03-24T00:48:00.000Z	unop	wild	 just do ..  mv  /home/ken/downloads/aptana  /opt/
2011-03-24T00:48:00.000Z	unop	wild	~/ is a shorthand for /home/ken  .. your homedir
2011-03-24T00:49:00.000Z	unop	wild	so basically, you had /home/ken/home/ken/aptana  :)  which i don't think exists
2011-03-24T00:49:00.000Z	wild	unop	I saw how the ~/ that is nice. without sudo it did not work either
2011-03-24T00:49:00.000Z	unop	wild	either do this ...  sudo mv ~/downloads/aptana  /opt/
2011-03-24T00:49:00.000Z	unop	wild	or this ... sudo mv /home/ken/downloads/aptana  /opt/
2011-03-24T00:50:00.000Z	wild	unop	I tried both of those but I will try again, there was never the double home/ken showing up in the error
2011-03-24T00:52:00.000Z	unop	wild	 sudo mv ~/downloads/aptana  /opt/   # should do it,  if it doesn't ... make sure you have it spelt right,  i.e.  it may be ~/Downloads instead of ~/downloads .... case matters.  same with the aptana/ directory .. case matters
2011-03-24T00:52:00.000Z	wild	unop	you were right when you wrote, check the case, it is Downloads not downloads
2011-03-24T00:52:00.000Z	unop	wild	:)
2011-03-24T00:52:00.000Z	unop	wild	you're welcome
2011-03-24T00:53:00.000Z	unop	wild	 a command that does what newbie01 wants :)
