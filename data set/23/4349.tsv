2007-11-25T23:06:00.000Z	Drule		So hey
2007-11-25T23:06:00.000Z	Drule		what do I need to do in order to set up a wired network between my Vista comp and Ubuntu?
2007-11-25T23:06:00.000Z	Drule		Do I need an application for Vista?
2007-11-25T23:06:00.000Z	Drule		Ubuntu is currently searching for a network connection or something
2007-11-25T23:07:00.000Z	Cyberai	Drule	how does your Vista system connect to your wireless?
2007-11-25T23:07:00.000Z	Drule		I'm not trying to set up a wireless LAN
2007-11-25T23:08:00.000Z	Cyberai	Drule	are you trying to get your ubuntu system connected to your AP or doa peer-to-peer between the ubuntu and vista systems?
2007-11-25T23:08:00.000Z	Drule	Cyberai	what does AP and doa mean
2007-11-25T23:08:00.000Z	Drule		I am pretty new to Ubuntu and its terminology.
2007-11-25T23:09:00.000Z	Drule		I see.
2007-11-25T23:09:00.000Z	Cyberai	Drule	AP = wireless access point, doa = "do a" typod
2007-11-25T23:09:00.000Z	Drule		p2p
2007-11-25T23:09:00.000Z	Drule		I'm just trying to connect the two via a network cable.
2007-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	Cyberai	Drule	wireless or cabled? You're not being particularly clear?
2007-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	Drule		Well that's what I meant by wired
2007-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	Drule		cabled yes
2007-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	Drule		I am wondering if I will need any additional applications for any of the systems
2007-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	Drule		for starters!
2007-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	Cyberai	Drule	no
2007-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	Drule		Swell.
2007-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	Drule		Okay well it found an unidentified network I think.
2007-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	Drule		So I don't know, flow
2007-11-25T23:12:00.000Z	Cyberai	Drule	set your vista system to a static IP of something like 192.168.1.3, and the ubuntu to 192.168.1.4. Then share a folder on the vista system. With any luck it should pop up after a couple minutes in the network folder of the ubuntu system
