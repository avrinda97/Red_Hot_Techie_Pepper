2011-11-16T11:08:00.000Z	shaxs		But I will say I am impressed. I am building a software raid 1 right now
2011-11-16T11:08:00.000Z	shaxs		doing my resync right now
2011-11-16T11:10:00.000Z	shaxs		Or will I need to start the raid from scratch?
2011-11-16T11:10:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	rsync for building a raid?
2011-11-16T11:11:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	I installed 11.10 on a 40 GB ide drive and have 2x2 TB drives for software raid 1. Right now I am building the array for the first time or doign the first resync. If I wipe and install 10.4 instead, can I keep my raid intact or do I need to redo the whole raid thing again?
2011-11-16T11:12:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	easiest would e to use the alternate-disc from 10.04 and recreate the raid there
2011-11-16T11:14:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	dont use the raid-controller from your motherboard
2011-11-16T11:15:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	its fake-raid, use software-raid instead
2011-11-16T11:15:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	yes I know, i am doing mdadm raid because the crap/fake raid in the mobo
2011-11-16T11:18:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	of course software-raid, a hardware-raid-controller (a good one) is starting at 200â‚¬
2011-11-16T11:18:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	yeah that I will do then
2011-11-16T11:18:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	is there a special reason you need raid1? (please dont say backup)
2011-11-16T11:19:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	I am building a media server to serve tv shows to my xbmc htpcs. So I figured raid 1 would be a good fail safe in case of one hd failure
2011-11-16T11:20:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	a backup is a good fail safe
2011-11-16T11:21:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	normally you only need raid on important servers which needs to be available 24/7
2011-11-16T11:22:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	e.g. if you do stupid things and delete a file, the file is missing on both drives, so raid is not a backup
2011-11-16T11:23:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	so if I jsut want a copy of my media files if one drive fails, dont use raid, but just use a sync program to backup data to the other hardrive?
2011-11-16T11:24:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	correct
2011-11-16T11:24:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	into recommendations for syncing software?
2011-11-16T11:24:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	raid is not a backup-solution, its just a high available solution
2011-11-16T11:24:00.000Z	iceroot	shaxs	rsync
2011-11-16T11:25:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	okay. I think you have me convinced. Im going to stop building this raid, donwgrade to 10.4 and setup rysnc
2011-11-16T11:26:00.000Z	shaxs	iceroot	thanks for the sage wisdom
