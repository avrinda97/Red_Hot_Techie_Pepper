2012-02-27T00:48:00.000Z	LimerickLarry		Question: what part of the ubuntu kernel handles keyboard input?
2012-02-27T00:49:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	what's the actual problem you are having
2012-02-27T00:50:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	what's the actual problem / issue you are having
2012-02-27T00:51:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	There appears to be a caps lock delay under Ubuntu.
2012-02-27T00:51:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	and by delay, I mean it looks like caps lock toggles on keyUp rather than keyDown.
2012-02-27T00:51:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	ok - I don't have that issue
2012-02-27T00:51:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	are you using X11 ?
2012-02-27T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	as in a desktop gui ?
2012-02-27T00:52:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	i'm not sure
2012-02-27T00:52:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	yes.
2012-02-27T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	do you have a gui on your screen ?
2012-02-27T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	ok, so, it's more likley your X11 session is not quite setup/working well at the moment rather than the kernel
2012-02-27T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	in future, if you explain your problem, rather than asking what you think is the problem area, people will be able to help y ou better, eg: you won't waste yours and other peoples time talking about the wrong thing
2012-02-27T00:53:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	I've reproduced this on two different machines, so it's not isolated to me.
2012-02-27T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	well, 3 people are not having the problem, so it's not everyone either
2012-02-27T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	what do those machines have in common ?
2012-02-27T00:54:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	they both run ubuntu, i'm not sure which version the second one uses.
2012-02-27T00:54:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	entirely different hardware, one's a laptop and one is not.
2012-02-27T00:54:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	ok, break the components down a bit, video drivers, chipset, etc
2012-02-27T00:56:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	the one i currently have access to is a thinkpad x200 tablet: http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/thinkpad/x-series-tablet/x200tablet
2012-02-27T00:56:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	still looking for information on it
2012-02-27T00:56:00.000Z	LimerickLarry	ikonia	the other is a lab machine, i have no idea what's inside it
2012-02-27T00:56:00.000Z	ikonia	LimerickLarry	ok, so that's something worth doing, check the components and softwaare product versions they are using
