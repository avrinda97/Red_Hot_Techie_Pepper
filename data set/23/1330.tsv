2010-05-12T06:34:00.000Z	cockatrice		Hey, I have sshd running on my desktop with the wireless router, and when I type "ssh braxton@desktop" on my laptop connected to the wireless router, is says connection refused!
2010-05-12T06:35:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 Try using the IP address instead of host name.  Also, do you have UFW enabled?
2010-05-12T06:35:00.000Z	cockatrice		UFW? Sorry, I'm a newb to ssh, just trying it out.
2010-05-12T06:35:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 If you don't know what ufw is you don't need to worry about it then :)
2010-05-12T06:36:00.000Z	cockatrice		alright.
2010-05-12T06:36:00.000Z	cockatrice		so just go to whatismyip.com?
2010-05-12T06:36:00.000Z	cockatrice		I'll just do that, yeah.
2010-05-12T06:36:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 First up, are you trying to connect remotely or from the same LAN as the target box
2010-05-12T06:37:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 If you're connecting remotely and are behind a router/firewall you'll most likely need to set it up to forward port 22 to the right box
2010-05-12T06:38:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	But I don't think I can do that with a dynamic IP T>T
2010-05-12T06:39:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	My ISP doesn't support static IP's, there all douchebags. >,<
2010-05-12T06:39:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 You can use a service like dyndns.org to provide access to a dynamic IP.  There are also instructions on their site for installing a daemon on your computer that will update the dyndns.org entry
2010-05-12T06:39:00.000Z	cockatrice		*they're
2010-05-12T06:39:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 I use the service myself
2010-05-12T06:39:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	:O
2010-05-12T06:40:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	can I use this for other things too, like a webserver!?
2010-05-12T06:40:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 Well, you COULD but a residential connection wouldn't likely have much bandwidth for hosting, and your ISP might complain
2010-05-12T06:40:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	I love you.
2010-05-12T06:41:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	Mind if I query?
2010-05-12T06:41:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam		Hm?
2010-05-12T06:42:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	cockatrice	 If you use dyndns for something like SSH, you'll probably want to change the port to something high instead of the default of 22, in case some script-kiddy out there tries to brute force it
2010-05-12T06:42:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	Lawl, script-kiddy.
2010-05-12T06:43:00.000Z	cockatrice	CogitoErgoSam	Alright.
