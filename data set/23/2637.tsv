2009-01-10T09:14:00.000Z	coj		hi, i'm on 8.10 and was wondering how to check if my ports were being forwarded correctly (using ktorrent)
2009-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	rww	coj	One easy way is to visit http://www.utorrent.com/testport.php?port=INSERTPORTNUMBERHERE
2009-01-10T09:15:00.000Z	coj	rww	yeah, that site reports that it's closed
2009-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	rww	coj	Hrm. What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-01-10T09:17:00.000Z	rww	coj	Open a terminal and issue "sudo ufw status". Does it say "Status: loaded" or "Status: not loaded"?
2009-01-10T09:19:00.000Z	rww	coj	Hmm, so you don't have a firewall set up. Are you sure that your computer's getting the same internal IP address in both Windows and Linux? 'cause it's possible that it's not, and that's throwing off the forwarding.
2009-01-10T09:20:00.000Z	coj	rww	when i checked my router page, it listed my machine as having the same internal IP that i assigned it - 192.168.0.19
2009-01-10T09:20:00.000Z	rww	coj	You could double-check with the "ifconfig" terminal command.
2009-01-10T09:21:00.000Z	coj	rww	eth0: inet addr: 192.168.0.19 <-- yup
2009-01-10T09:23:00.000Z	rww	coj	Okay, so you're definitely forwarding it properly on the router, you don't have a firewall set up... KTorrent is definitely using the right port? I haven't used "netstat" much, but I hear that's the way to check that.
2009-01-10T09:25:00.000Z	coj	rww	yeah, the port is set correctly in ktorrent, but the thing is that the port itself is reported as closed in that utorrent port checker
2009-01-10T09:25:00.000Z	coj	rww	one thing though - different sites detect my IP differently, because of my shitty ISP's proxy
2009-01-10T09:26:00.000Z	rww	coj	Heh. Well /that/ might explain it.
2009-01-10T09:26:00.000Z	coj	rww	GRC shieldsup detects my IP wrongly but shows the port as open
2009-01-10T09:26:00.000Z	rww	coj	Sounds like it, because as far as I can tell, everything's set up correctly on your local network.
2009-01-10T09:27:00.000Z	rww	coj	most routers have that information in their status page
2009-01-10T09:30:00.000Z	rww	coj	According to Freenode, your IP address is 218.186.199.205. Not sure if that helps.
2009-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	rww	coj	No problem :). One last point: some bittorrent clients have an icon on the status bar that says whether your port is blocked. I don't know if KTorrent does, but it might be worth looking in to.
2009-01-10T09:35:00.000Z	coj	rww	ktorrent doesn't, but transmission does, and it shows the port as closed. might be wrong though since it might not be using the correct IP
2009-01-10T09:36:00.000Z	rww	coj	Does transmission have a yellow or red icon? If it's red, it's detecting it as closed. If it's yellow, it's not sure yet (and will change to red or green eventually).
2009-01-10T09:43:00.000Z	coj	rww	there's no icon that i can see within the transmission window itself. are you perhaps thinking about utorrent?
2009-01-10T09:44:00.000Z	rww	coj	Heh. It appears that I'm thinking of deluge-torrent, actually. Sorry about that.
2009-01-10T09:44:00.000Z	coj	rww	oh ok
