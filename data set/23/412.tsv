2011-10-04T07:20:00.000Z	ZeloZelos		i need help fixing grub. i used ubuntu tweak to remove what i thought was all the old grubs ;(
2011-10-04T07:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	oh boy. What did you do and what do you now have?
2011-10-04T07:21:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	i only have vista, the drive has win 8 and ubuntu 11
2011-10-04T07:22:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	i tried the grub stuff from the links but i guess i messed up
2011-10-04T07:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	no, what kernels do you have now?
2011-10-04T07:22:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	oh, its 2.6.32-34 i think
2011-10-04T07:23:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	i already baqckuped the stuff on the drive i needed
2011-10-04T07:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	so, where is the issue?
2011-10-04T07:25:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	the ubuntu lines arent there when grub starts, just memtest's and vista
2011-10-04T07:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	boot to liveCD and chroot to the installed ubuntu OS and run:  sudo update-grub
2011-10-04T07:26:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	perhaps if i hit e and change the vista line to load ubuntu, then use update grub n stuf that way?
2011-10-04T07:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	if you are able to, why not :)
2011-10-04T07:26:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	i did something similar a while ago and enede up reinstalling my entire hd im afaraid to do it agin
2011-10-04T07:27:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	thats the exact page i used
2011-10-04T07:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	if you are conversant with grub then go for it :). I don't advise 3rd party apps to remove something as fundamental as kernels

2011-10-04T07:28:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	i need a demo setup, i think i can figure out what the hd partition name is n all
2011-10-04T07:29:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	the chroot method was also one of the ways i was unsuccessfull
2011-10-04T07:29:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	i kinda need a plug n fix method, cept if i can get the os to boot i think i may be able to fix that way
2011-10-04T07:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	all I can recommend is boot to liveCD and chroot
2011-10-04T07:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	i'm not conversant with grub as I single boot
2011-10-04T07:31:00.000Z	ZeloZelos	ActionParsnip	your prob right, it may go better this time, last time i messed it all up because i installed ubuntu to a micro sd on a flash adaptor, and when it installed grub it started an entire chaine of crap
2012-03-16T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ZeloZelos	try hydrairc
