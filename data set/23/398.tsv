2011-10-09T15:46:00.000Z	lanthaler		hello.. just installed ubuntu 11.04 but I can't connect to my WLAN network (uses WPA).. can someone help me?
2011-10-09T15:46:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	in terminal "iwlist scan"
2011-10-09T15:49:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	it lists a number of WLANs there.. also mine.. I've set it up in the network manager but it doesn't connect
2011-10-09T15:50:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	Do you use WPA or WPA2
2011-10-09T15:51:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	WPA-PSK 256 bit
2011-10-09T15:57:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	any idea what could be wrong?
2011-10-09T15:57:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	ABout the wireless
2011-10-09T15:58:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	Maybe try a static ip and manual DNS
2011-10-09T16:00:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	the problem is it doesn't even connect.. keyphrase is 100% right
2011-10-09T16:01:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	Which wireless card and ubuntu version + do other computers connect?
2011-10-09T16:02:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	Ubuntu 11.04 according to lspci it's a Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG [Calexico2]
2011-10-09T16:03:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	Is this a recent issue or was it always not working
2011-10-09T16:03:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	just installed Ubuntu.. wasn't working before
2011-10-09T16:31:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	No idea on that
2011-10-09T16:08:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	I know someone who had the same problem for the same card on Ubuntu they solved it by changing TKIP/AES to just TKIP in the router config
2011-10-09T16:10:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	will try if it works with WEP.. can't change it to just TKIP
2011-10-09T16:11:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	That should work ... also maybe an alternative network manager ... for that person the issue was only with Gnome's network manager but on Kde it worked
2011-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	I'm using the Unity UI.. is that Gnome or KDE?
2011-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	do you know how to do it on the cmd line?
2011-10-09T16:16:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	Gnome
2011-10-09T16:16:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	Yes but its quite complex
2011-10-09T16:17:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	lanthaler	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WPAHowTo
2011-10-09T16:27:00.000Z	lanthaler	GirlyGirl	I've created that /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file and tried to connect.. now I get a CTR-EVENT-DISCONNECTED when doing sudo wpa_supplicant -ieth1 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
