2010-03-25T02:03:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	That's the thing I don't know
2010-03-25T02:03:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	sorry that was a typo
2010-03-25T02:03:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	 .... sooo check in your processes :)
2010-03-25T02:04:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	 you can try installing 'qps', is in the repos, which is a visual processes manager
2010-03-25T02:05:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	Done. and 'ps -ea' doean't show that it's running
2010-03-25T02:07:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	 the configuration file is either in a folder in ~ or an 'rc' file there too.... if you can run it, do so, and then run a lsof -C APPNAME; to shows what files it has open/inuse
2010-03-25T02:09:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	can't find qps in the menu anywhere
2010-03-25T02:09:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	 you need to install it :)     sudo apt-get install qps
2010-03-25T02:10:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	I just used synaptic to install it
2010-03-25T02:13:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	 Nope it's not running. Anyidea how to start it?
2010-03-25T02:13:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	 ...    no.... ahemm   you mean you installed it and you dunno how to launch it?
2010-03-25T02:15:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	NEw to linux and I tried going via the /etc/init.d/tightvncserver start route
2010-03-25T02:16:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	 what about the man pages?    checked ->   man tight<TAB>
2010-03-25T03:47:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	  so you installed it and dunno how to run it?
2010-03-25T03:48:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	Yes.. I'm new to this whole linux suite of programs
2010-03-25T03:49:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	   go to the console and use autocomplete :)  ->   php<tab>
2010-03-25T03:49:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	   it will show the available commands starting with THAT
2010-03-25T03:49:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	nothing listed
2010-03-25T03:50:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	   have you looked in your apps menus yet?
2010-03-25T03:51:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Typos_King	well it's installed according to synaptic
2010-03-25T03:52:00.000Z	Typos_King	DarkStar1	   then it'd show in the menus usually, with the rest of the apps under some category, for php I'd think under web development or such
