2005-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	KurtKraut		Where can I find some plugins to be added to gnome, such as CPU graphic ?
2005-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	Right click the panel and choose "Add to panel...'
2005-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	There's a system monitor applet, try that.
2005-10-30T17:30:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	if that fails, try gdesktlets, which contain far more status monitor shit than you'l;ll ever need or want.
2005-11-28T16:36:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	I had a very bad RAM management in Breezy. My SWAP was getting full, so I've downgraded to Hoary and here I have no problem. So this kernel changes might solve my problem ? Should I try to upgrade to Breezy again ?
2005-11-28T16:36:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	How much ram/swap do you have?
2005-11-28T16:37:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	I have 256mb DDR.
2005-11-28T16:37:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	Do you use gnome?
2005-11-28T16:37:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	yes, I do.
2005-11-28T16:39:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	Gnome, when just running, would be using pretty much all of your ram. Any apps you start will make the machine start to swap. Do you use Evolution?
2005-11-28T16:40:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	no, I don't use Evolution. And using Hoary I hardly ever have SWAP in use and with sarge I've NEVER ever had SWAP beeing used, only after some days of uptime.
2005-11-28T16:40:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	in all systems (breezy, hoary, sarge) I use the same applications. So for me there is clearly a bad performace on Breezy comparing to Hoary and mainly to sarge.
2005-11-28T16:41:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	*nod* Do you have xorg transparency enabled?
2005-11-28T16:41:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	... or using beagle?
2005-11-28T16:41:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	no, none of these features.
2005-11-28T16:41:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	How about when using a different kernel under breezy?
2005-11-28T16:42:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	I don't have enough experience in linux to do it by myself.
2005-11-28T16:42:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	do you suggest any tutorial ?
2005-11-28T16:43:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	Try the hoary kernel under breezy, just install & boot.
2005-11-28T16:44:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	is there any documentation that I would learn how to do such changes with kernel ?
2005-11-28T16:44:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	Just the package, no changing of anything else.
2005-11-28T16:44:00.000Z	KurtKraut	cafuego	so it is easier than I thought ;D
2007-11-04T08:27:00.000Z	cafuego	KurtKraut	There is a java 1.4 applet, which doesn't work on most sites.
