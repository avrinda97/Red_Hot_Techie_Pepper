2006-05-27T11:26:00.000Z	mjcs	tuxtheslacker	 hah actually theres barely anything on that page
2006-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	mjcs	there's nothing on that page.
2006-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		I'm on fedora right now, and it's kinda bloated. I've been on slack for a year, and before that I was on gentoo.
2006-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		do you think ubuntu would be a good choice?
2006-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	mjcs	tuxtheslacker	i saw loads somewhere about getting it working. i just can't remember where.
2006-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	mjcs	tuxtheslacker	 sorry!
2006-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	mjcs	there's lots on getting it working, it's just a thing of if it's easy to make work on ubuntu :-P
2006-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	mjcs	tuxtheslacker	my wireless card worked out of the box on both my computer and my laptop on Dapper. it should be easy..
2006-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	mjcs	normally it needs the firmware at least updated.
2006-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		or at least did in fedora.
2006-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		in slack it was a huge pain in the testicles.
2006-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	mjcs	tuxtheslacker	i done a quick search of the forums, it appears the ipw2200 should work out of the box on Dapper. should be painless.
2006-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		linuxboy, that's what I had planned on doing, but bassically, I need wireless support.
2006-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	mjcs	doens't need any firmware updates?
2006-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		ipw2200
