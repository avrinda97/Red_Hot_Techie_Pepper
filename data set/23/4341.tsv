2009-04-27T00:25:00.000Z	sixblades		Does anyone have any ideas on how to troubleshoot a segfaulting firefox?
2009-04-27T00:25:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	first question where did you get firefox ?
2009-04-27T00:25:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	just from the repos. It came with a fresh jaunty install
2009-04-27T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	disable all plugins/themes etc etc and see what it does
2009-04-27T00:27:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	I ran it in "safe-mode" from a terminal and disabled all custom settings / plugins / themes etc. No change in behaviour.
2009-04-27T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	you'll have to log a bug then and post the coredump
2009-04-27T00:28:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	How do I get the core dump and where should I post the bug?
2009-04-27T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	launchpad.net - the core dump should probably be in either your home dir or /usr/bin
2009-04-27T00:30:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	what would the core dump file be called?
2009-04-27T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	core normally
2009-04-27T00:31:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	I did a ls /usr/bin | grep core and didn't get anything relevant
2009-04-27T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	anything in /home/$username ?
2009-04-27T00:31:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	Nope, not that I can tell. I ran the same ls | grep core on home and didn't get any output.
2009-04-27T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	is it a segfault, or a core dump
2009-04-27T00:32:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	When firefox crashes it prints "Segmentation fault" to the standard output.
2009-04-27T00:36:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	Any ideas?
2009-04-27T00:37:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	I would open a terminal and launch "firefox" and look for warnings while running
2009-04-27T00:37:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	sorry - I mean launch firefox from the terminal
2009-04-27T00:37:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	I start firefox from a terminal, and then it just prints Segmentation fault.
2009-04-27T00:38:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	you're not overclocking or anything like that are you ?
2009-04-27T00:38:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	It's perfectly fine as long as I don't move the mouse.
2009-04-27T00:38:00.000Z	sixblades	ikonia	No, I'm not.
2009-04-27T00:38:00.000Z	ikonia	sixblades	very interesting
