2009-03-17T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wanna_learn_more	yes, why are you trying to build a kernel
2009-03-17T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wanna_learn_more	you don't need to recompile I kernel for that
2009-03-17T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wanna_learn_more	I believe thats just a module
2009-03-17T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	wanna_learn_more	ok - so it's just a kernel module isn't it ?
2009-03-17T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	wanna_learn_more	yes, thats right they do, but you don't need to recompile a kernel to change / use a module
