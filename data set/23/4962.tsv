2007-06-04T09:53:00.000Z	hwilde		hey on old ubuntu there is option System->LockScreen.  Can I install that in 7.04 ?
2007-06-04T09:54:00.000Z	hwilde		0.99820GB
2007-06-04T09:54:00.000Z	hwilde		MiB = Million Bytes, which is the same as MegaBytes
2007-06-04T09:55:00.000Z	hwilde		technically not the same but close enough unless you are counting cylinder heads
2007-06-04T09:55:00.000Z	hwilde		swap space is for losers anyways just get more ram
2007-06-04T09:55:00.000Z	hwilde		lol
2007-06-04T09:56:00.000Z	hwilde		hibernation doesn't work so good
2007-06-04T09:57:00.000Z	hwilde		this page has the mathematics as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte
2007-06-04T09:58:00.000Z	hwilde		megabyte MB = mebibyte (MiB),  they are just SI versus Binary prefixes.

2007-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	hwilde	thanks will look at that
2007-06-04T10:01:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	hwilde	what i understand from it is that it only supports xfree86.. but i use xorg..
2007-06-04T10:01:00.000Z	hwilde	fuzzy_logic	xinerama ?
2007-06-04T10:01:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	hwilde	no.. that dualhead
2007-06-04T10:02:00.000Z	hwilde	fuzzy_logic	try xinerama then
2007-06-04T10:02:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	hwilde	xinerama does exactly what i don't want.. i don't want 1 large.. i want 2 seperate but with the possibility to drag windows from one to another..
2007-06-04T10:03:00.000Z	hwilde	fuzzy_logic	I guess you would have to get dual output video card then
2007-06-04T10:04:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	hwilde	i will see if mine supports it.. but maybe it doesn't, that's a good suggestion.. much thanks
2007-06-04T10:04:00.000Z	hwilde	fuzzy_logic	I have an ati radeon with dual output and it works like you want.  2 separate desktops with drag between
2007-06-04T10:04:00.000Z	hwilde	fuzzy_logic	I use the vga cable for one and dvi out for the other
2007-06-04T10:05:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	hwilde	i have a laptop and a monitor, but i would like to have the monitor and the laptop screen.. maybe that's the problem, that it isn't a regular screen?
2007-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	hwilde	fuzzy_logic	I think the best you can get with that setup is one desktop spanning both with xinerama.
2007-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	hwilde	ok thanks
