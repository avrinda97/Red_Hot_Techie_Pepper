2008-06-09T02:40:00.000Z	jpw27_		when i do 'make xconfig' in a kernel directory i get "/usr/include/wchar.h:345: error: ‘__extern_inline’ does not name a type".  anybody know what that means
2008-06-09T02:42:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	its to do with pointers and types
2008-06-09T02:42:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	know how to fix it, by chance?
2008-06-09T02:42:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	not without seeing the source code
2008-06-09T02:44:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	'make xconfig' has worked on my system before, so I don't know why it stopped now
2008-06-09T02:45:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	well the code is probably broken due to an upgrade or something, getting me line 345 of your wchar.h would be a start :)
2008-06-09T02:46:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	__extern_inline size_t
2008-06-09T02:47:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	ok ill check it out
2008-06-09T02:49:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	upgraded stuff recently? :)
2008-06-09T02:49:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	what stuff precisely
2008-06-09T02:50:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	just in general? yes
2008-06-09T02:50:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	anything that would touch /usr/include, such as kernel headers, -dev packages, any development headers, just headers really :P
2008-06-09T02:51:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	yea, i think a few days ago there was an update for the generic kernel headers
2008-06-09T02:51:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	sounds like your problem mate
2008-06-09T02:52:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	yea, I'm not sure if (or why) kernel headers touch stdlib.h
2008-06-09T02:53:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	i really have no clue though
2008-06-09T02:53:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	im working on it ;)
2008-06-09T02:53:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	haha, thanks much
2008-06-09T02:54:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	if it would help, i can pastebin the whole nasty feedback, I just gave you lines I deemed pertinent
2008-06-09T02:54:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	it would help alot
2008-06-09T02:56:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	thanks for the help, here's the whole thing http://rafb.net/p/NeKZQw34.html
2008-06-09T02:56:00.000Z	buntu0	jpw27_	no problem, looking no
2008-06-09T03:04:00.000Z	jpw27_	buntu0	anything obvious, or is something just messed up on my end?
