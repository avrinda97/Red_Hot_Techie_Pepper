2005-12-10T13:31:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	apt-get install lmms
2005-12-10T13:35:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	lmms is in breezy-backports. no need to mess with the source
2005-12-10T13:36:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	i have looked at it, but haven't done anything yet
2005-12-10T13:37:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	with apt-get
2005-12-10T13:38:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	backports are not there by default, you have to add it
2005-12-10T13:39:00.000Z	allison_1984	topyli	> ok
2005-12-10T13:50:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	sudo apt-get install lmms. synaptic should find it as well
2005-12-10T13:52:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	did you do apt-get update?
2005-12-10T13:57:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	please don't paste those messages here. we know how apt works :)
2005-12-10T13:57:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	well, the repositories are still not right

2005-12-10T14:02:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	paste your sources.list to the pastebin
2005-12-10T14:15:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	sorry, missed you there. join #flood. pastebin is a web site where you can paste stuff, #flood is the channel where you can do the same
2005-12-10T14:26:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	no breezy-backports there
2005-12-10T14:41:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	still no backports
2005-12-10T14:42:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	add this to your souces.list: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ breezy-backports main restricted universe multiverse
2005-12-10T14:43:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	then run apt-get update and apt-get install lmms -> done
2005-12-10T14:43:00.000Z	allison_1984	topyli	ok
2005-12-10T14:44:00.000Z	topyli	allison_1984	do NOT run apt-get upgrade with backports enabled. you may not want to upgrade everything to backports
2005-12-10T14:45:00.000Z	allison_1984	topyli	oh... no way.... :)
