2006-04-06T10:42:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	 two issues for you...here comes the first
2006-04-06T10:42:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	do you know why dmesg keeps repeating the following 2 lines?  [4296949.195000]  atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0xaa on isa0060/serio0).
2006-04-06T10:44:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	hmm.. i've seen that before but i forget how i fixed it. i remember it was completely harmless. google.com/linux may have answers..
2006-04-06T10:45:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	I'll keep googling...here's the second coming your way...I'll use paste bin though
2006-04-06T10:45:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	hmm ok .. ;)
2006-04-06T10:46:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	it's a thumbdrive issue
2006-04-06T10:46:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	(arrick you too :) see here:  http://pastebin.com/634386
2006-04-06T10:48:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	is the disk new?
2006-04-06T10:49:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	define new...I bought it a couple of months ago and have been using it to go b/t Windows and Linux
2006-04-06T10:49:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	if blank i'd run an fsck on this, perhaps even look at a cfdisk and load on a fresh fs. possibly have a bad block.
2006-04-06T10:49:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	will do now and let you know
2006-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	;)
2006-04-06T10:53:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	and arrick:  superblock can not be read ... what can I do?
2006-04-06T10:54:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	that with fsck?
2006-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	i would move all your data off and use cfdisk to delete the partition. then format and use mk2fs to load on ext2 fs.
2006-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	no cfdisk:  fsck gives me dosfsck 2.11, 12 Mar 2005, FAT32, LFN
2006-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	want to use it with Windows as well
2006-04-06T10:56:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	right, then i would get all your data off, use cfdisk to delete the partition then load on the fat32 fs under windows.
2006-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	okay thx...BTW do you and arrick, gnomefreak, and crimsun ever sleep?
2006-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	every second century i take a break..
2006-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	thought so
2006-04-06T10:58:00.000Z	duelboot	delire_	cfdisk is now working...sweet
2006-04-06T10:58:00.000Z	delire_	duelboot	cool..
