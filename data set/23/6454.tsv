2006-04-07T05:54:00.000Z	tanuki_	thingfish	is it possible to write to the linux partition with this program?
2006-04-07T05:54:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	not sure.  Didn't used to be able to.
2006-04-07T05:55:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	look for /etc/hostname
2006-04-07T05:56:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	that's where it is in Debian. :)
2006-04-07T05:57:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	what does /etc/hostname have in it?
2006-04-07T05:58:00.000Z	tanuki_	thingfish	the hostname i set using the command
2006-04-07T05:58:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	it might be /etc/network.../hostname
2006-04-07T05:58:00.000Z	tanuki_	thingfish	however when i login it does not give me this hostname, it gives me the one set during setup
2006-04-07T05:59:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	odd.  what makes you think your lack of internet access has to do with your hostname?
2006-04-07T05:59:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	what network card?
2006-04-07T05:59:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	you need to give as much detail as possible.
2006-04-07T06:00:00.000Z	tanuki_	thingfish	because it looked unusual at setup, it did not look like it has in the past, everytiome i have installed ubuntu it gave me a differentr hostname, this time it gave me a static ip address
2006-04-07T06:00:00.000Z	tanuki_	thingfish	for example, the hostname usually looks something like: yourname_8927364987 < and an alphanumeric sequence
2006-04-07T06:00:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	sorry, I've never heard of such behavior before.
2006-04-07T06:00:00.000Z	tanuki_	thingfish	this time it gave me an ip address: adsl-something.something.something.something
2006-04-07T06:00:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	again, what does /etc/hostname say?
2006-04-07T06:01:00.000Z	tanuki_	thingfish	it gives the hostname i set with the hostname command
2006-04-07T06:02:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	keep asking.  maybe someone can help you figure out what's going on.  I'd help further, but I'm actually not running ubunut.
2006-04-07T06:04:00.000Z	thingfish	tanuki_	to get help, you need to give TONS of detail.  State what you've tried, what hardware you have (nic, I mean), etc.
