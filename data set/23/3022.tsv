2008-08-22T08:46:00.000Z	Whiz_2		ok obviously no one here can give me the help I really need...
2008-08-22T08:47:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	what is your Q again
2008-08-22T08:48:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	During install of ubuntu server (alternate CD) when booting from the CD it says it can't detect any common CD-ROM drives. I do not have any floppy disks I can use for a netboot, and I have no USB stick. this installation *must* be done from a CD
2008-08-22T08:49:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	did you try mounting the CD from the command line?
2008-08-22T08:50:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	i would if it was listed in /dev but /dev/cdrom doesn't exist
2008-08-22T08:51:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	is it IDE ?
2008-08-22T08:51:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	it's atapi according to my bios, but it is connected to a standard IDE interface
2008-08-22T08:52:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	try /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc, etc..
2008-08-22T08:52:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	those are hard drives
2008-08-22T08:55:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	nothing starting with hd shows in /dev either.
2008-08-22T08:56:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	I'm looking at the /dev list. if you give me about 10-15 mins or so I can provide a paste of the entire /dev list as detected by the installer to get idea
2008-08-22T08:57:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	ls /etc/ > ~/list.etc
2008-08-22T08:58:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	what am I supposed to do with that once it's output? I can't get it anywhere you can see it that way, cuz the computer has no network access
2008-08-22T08:59:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	dcc send to me
2008-08-22T08:59:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	I can't paste it!
2008-08-22T08:59:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	i have to write it out manually
2008-08-22T09:00:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	you should learn to cut and paste before using linux
2008-08-22T09:00:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	i can not open a terminal window. i'm running straight ona command line
2008-08-22T09:00:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	pay attention please
2008-08-22T09:01:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	it is 30$/hr for me to pay attention
2008-08-22T09:01:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	copy on CD or floppy or get creative to save some time
2008-08-22T09:02:00.000Z	Whiz_2	test34	no network access of any kind, running without LiveCD (command line installation only), no working floppy disks, nor can it mount the floppy for some reason, no way to get it to you except typing it out manually
2008-08-22T09:03:00.000Z	test34	Whiz_2	do whatever you have to do.. and paste it somewhere when you are done
