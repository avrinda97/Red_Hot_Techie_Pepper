2006-08-10T07:14:00.000Z	EriK_	visik7	 ISOINFO(8)
2006-08-10T07:15:00.000Z	EriK_	visik7	 it's /usr/bin/isoinfo on my system, I don't remember the command to find out what package provided it, but if somebody refreshes my memory I'll find out for ya

2006-08-10T08:02:00.000Z	visik7	EriK_	is a tool to create a custom ubuntu live cd
2006-08-10T08:02:00.000Z	visik7	EriK_	you can add and remove repos software and other things
2006-08-10T08:02:00.000Z	visik7	EriK_	I'm testing it right now
2006-08-10T08:02:00.000Z	visik7	EriK_	unfortunatly it supports only gnome right now but is a great tool
2006-08-10T08:09:00.000Z	EriK_	visik7	 I had been planning to play with 'bootcd' that proclaims to "Build an image of your running Debian System with the command bootcdwrite. You can also build a bootcd ISO image via NFS on a remote System. When you run your system from CD you do not need any disks. All changes will be done in ram"
2006-08-10T08:09:00.000Z	EriK_	visik7	 have you played with that at all?

2006-08-10T08:11:00.000Z	visik7	EriK_	anyway is written in python
2006-08-10T08:11:00.000Z	visik7	EriK_	maybe I can read the source and write some docs
