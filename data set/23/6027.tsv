2006-06-28T15:17:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm		hi everyone,
2006-06-28T15:18:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm		I have a problem with a brother dcp-110c, getting it to install. I have downloaded and installed the .deb cups wrapper and lpr drivers from the brother site but the printer is still not available (although it is detected) any ideas?
2006-06-28T15:20:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	leave those Brother drivers alone.  They gave me nothing but problems.
2006-06-28T15:20:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	I used them only a few days ago with kubuntu and they worked fine, but not with ubuntu
2006-06-28T15:21:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	yeah i got them to work on one of my ubuntu machines, but it really screwed up CUPS on the other.
2006-06-28T15:23:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	dpkg -are [package-name]  should remove it.
2006-06-28T15:24:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	-are should be "-r"
2006-06-28T15:24:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	thanks will try now
2006-06-28T15:26:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	just keep in mind that those drivers have not been maintained for a couple of years now.
2006-06-28T15:30:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	yes, that seems to have removed them, I will try a re-install in the right order;)
2006-06-28T15:31:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	should I reboot first?
2006-06-28T15:31:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	good for you.  which version of ubuntu?
2006-06-28T15:31:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	glad it worked.  there should be no need to reboot.
2006-06-28T15:41:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	are you using a usb connection with that printer?
2006-06-28T15:42:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	yes, and it is detected in the "add printers" dialog, but no reference to the correct driver. When I installed it in kubuntu it just showed up, already configured
2006-06-28T15:43:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	from what i remember (three months ago) I had to disconnect, the reconnect the usb cable.
2006-06-28T15:44:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	then when i re-opened the "printers" dialog, it was there.
2006-06-28T15:45:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	hmm, not working, very strange!
2006-06-28T15:46:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	that's why i ultimately removed the drivers from both machines.  i think they're too old for Dapper.
2006-06-28T15:48:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	yes, but kubuntu version was also dapper and worked flawlessly
2006-06-28T15:49:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	IMHO, if it works sometimes and not others, it's just not reliable enough.
2006-06-28T15:50:00.000Z	jmpmjmpm	tovella	true, but I have to keep at it, the ink is very cheap;)
2006-06-29T16:01:00.000Z	tovella	jmpmjmpm	another part of why i got rid of the drivers.
