2006-08-22T11:16:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	rhyddin	you can type 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core=1:1.0.2-0ubuntu10.4' to upgrade to the correct version (provided the mirror is upto date, else wait), or 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core=1:1.0.2-0ubuntu10' to downgrade
2006-08-22T11:21:00.000Z	rhyddin	Ash-Fox	So whats the deal with this? Is it going to be fixed, or do I have to just ignore that it wants to update?
2006-08-22T11:21:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	rhyddin	it's already been fixed, it's just a question of when yourm irror gets 10.4
2006-08-22T11:21:00.000Z	rhyddin	Ash-Fox	I'm not complaining, this is the first glitch I've had with Ubuntu, but I'm curious what happened.
2006-08-22T11:22:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	rhyddin	well, a security update messed up things in xorg, and as such they rolled back to the older version, under a new version number, 10.4
2006-08-22T11:30:00.000Z	rhyddin	Ash-Fox	And how do u do that?
2006-08-22T11:31:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	rhyddin	well, I test a update on one computer, if it works fine, I stick it on the lan's repository, and get the updates shiped out to the other computers.
2006-08-22T11:31:00.000Z	rhyddin	Ash-Fox	In this case wasnt the bug isolated to a particular subset of systems? How would u know for sure?
2006-08-22T11:32:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	rhyddin	most of the hardware getting the updates is very similar to the test computer.
2006-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	rhyddin	I use the same update practices with windows :)
2006-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	rhyddin	Ash-Fox	Ah. I c. Well, I'm glad there are people around who are in the know and willing to help the community at large.
2006-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	rhyddin	Ash-Fox	Like yourself.
2006-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	rhyddin	the issue was found before I even discovered it, so I didn't really help much other than on the channel :P
2006-08-22T11:34:00.000Z	rhyddin	Ash-Fox	Well, every little bit helps, you know? Most of these guys have switched from Windows and wouldn't know a cl from a hole in the wall.
