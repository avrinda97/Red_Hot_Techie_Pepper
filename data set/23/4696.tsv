2007-09-02T06:43:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		Umm... Please please please help me speed up ubuntu? I can provide more details than "it's slow".
2007-09-02T06:43:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	go ahead
2007-09-02T06:45:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	MasterOfDisaster	Ok, so this laptop handled Vista home Premium fine for the week I used it, and the dual boot ubuntu installation I had too. Then I accidentally wiped the HDD, and installed ubuntu again. Now it's kinda sluggish with even the most basic tasks such as right clicking, changing windows, hell even moving the cursor to another line in netbeans.
2007-09-02T06:48:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	verify that DMA is enabled (hdparm -I /dev/hdX as root)
2007-09-02T06:49:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	are you using a custom kernel?
2007-09-02T06:49:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	MasterOfDisaster	If I have no idea that means no, right?
2007-09-02T06:50:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	join me in a query?
2007-09-02T06:51:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	MasterOfDisaster	How do I find out if I am?
2007-09-02T06:53:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	open a terminal, and type 'sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep DMA'<ENTER>, then enter your password.
2007-09-02T06:53:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	or hda, whatever your HDD is.
2007-09-02T06:54:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	if you get a line like this: "DMA: sdma0 sdma1 sdma2 mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 *udma5", DMA is enabled.
2007-09-02T06:54:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	MasterOfDisaster	 Here's the output: DMA: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 *udma5
2007-09-02T06:54:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	excellent. Is the computer in question a laptop?
2007-09-02T06:56:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	perhaps you enabled some kind of powersaving behaviour in your BIOS/with a HP provided application in Vista per accident?
2007-09-02T06:58:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	might have, some applications from the vendors are able to modify bios settings.
2007-09-02T07:00:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	sorry, that's the only thing I can think of if you have not been tampering with your Ubuntu installation, since you terminated vista.
2007-09-02T07:00:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	Is your power supply plugged in?
2007-09-02T07:01:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	guess not.
2007-09-02T07:02:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	verify that your power supply is plugged in and working, and check your power savings BIOS settings. Apart from that, I'm clueless, sorry.
2007-09-02T07:03:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	you do not use a custom compiled kernel, right?
2007-09-02T07:04:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	perhaps it reset something to default setting which killed performance...
2007-09-02T07:05:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	definitly check your bios settings.
2007-09-02T07:05:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	Ar-Pharazon	nothing I can think of, no
