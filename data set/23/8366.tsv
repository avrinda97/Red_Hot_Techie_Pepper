2004-11-25T09:30:00.000Z	nanotech		also, i was wondering why during my apt-get upgrade that a few packages were held back
2004-11-25T09:32:00.000Z	nanotech		i'm not following; when i installed totem, and xine (weren't these part of the package mamager) i removed the ubuntu desktop? what does this mean? the ubunutu desktop? link me to a doc plz
2004-11-25T09:34:00.000Z	nanotech		the ubuntu desktop?
2004-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	nanotech		i thought ubuntu installed the gnome desktop 2.8
2004-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	nanotech		are you telling me that ubuntu has it's own?
2004-11-25T09:35:00.000Z	nanotech		fully independant of gnome 2.8?
2004-11-25T09:37:00.000Z	nanotech		ok, it's a package, and installing other software that may conflict with this removed it?
2004-11-25T09:37:00.000Z	nanotech		ok.
2004-11-25T09:37:00.000Z	nanotech		so when i install xine, and totem...i can't get mplayer in my apt-get calls?
2004-11-25T09:39:00.000Z	nanotech		if you remove these functions from the distro, pwople can't learn how to use package management
2004-11-25T09:39:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	remove what?
2004-11-25T09:39:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2004-11-25T09:39:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	never said remove anywhere in there.
2004-11-25T09:44:00.000Z	nanotech	wasabi	i felt that a major part of growing with your Linux box was breaking various dependencies and figuring out how to remedy the problems.
2004-11-25T09:46:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	same as with any other distro. Specific question?
2004-11-25T09:46:00.000Z	nanotech	wasabi	one sec
2004-11-25T09:48:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	you need the development headers.
2004-11-25T09:48:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	in packages postfixed with -dev
2004-11-25T10:08:00.000Z	nanotech	wasabi	youre charecter seems to be very counterproductive, and detremental to ubuntu development
2004-11-25T10:12:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	nothing ever will limit that flexibility. After all it's open source.
2004-11-25T10:13:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	that's a gnome 1 program.
2004-11-25T10:19:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	you are compiling gtk1 code. Gnome 2 uses Gtk2.
2004-11-25T10:19:00.000Z	wasabi	nanotech	gtk1 is on it's way to being dead.
