2007-11-20T02:44:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	Shouldn't be....  Should be no difference.
2007-11-20T02:45:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	but the difference is increible...
2007-11-20T02:45:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	All the applications run slow?
2007-11-20T02:45:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	yes
2007-11-20T02:45:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	Or just some of them?
2007-11-20T02:45:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	That's interesting.
2007-11-20T02:46:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	Try:  /etc/init.d/networking stop
2007-11-20T02:46:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	i try
2007-11-20T02:46:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	See if that makes a difference...
2007-11-20T02:47:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop
2007-11-20T02:47:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	okeys
2007-11-20T02:49:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	yes, when i put network off, is all fast
2007-11-20T02:50:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	Hummm... that's interesting. What processor?
2007-11-20T02:50:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	in my two pcs is the same
2007-11-20T02:53:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	now?
2007-11-20T02:53:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	What?
2007-11-20T02:53:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	what i do to have networking in my pc?
2007-11-20T02:54:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	sudo /etc/init.d/networking start
2007-11-20T02:54:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	but i do is, i have my pc slow!
2007-11-20T02:55:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	What kind of PC is it?  (What CPU speed and how much memory, etc.)
2007-11-20T02:55:00.000Z	next`MiLLeN	jc	this is a dual core e6300 with 1 gb RAM
2007-11-20T02:56:00.000Z	jc	next`MiLLeN	I have no idea why it would run slow with network on and fast when off.  Doesn't make any sense to me.
