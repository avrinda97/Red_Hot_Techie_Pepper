2006-08-12T05:37:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	I tried to manually install something that overwrote it
2006-08-12T05:38:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	I haven't actually tried, I broke it through ssh
2006-08-12T05:40:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	That works.
2006-08-12T05:41:00.000Z	asabil	DarthLappy	then libc ain't broken :D
2006-08-12T05:42:00.000Z	asabil	DarthLappy	if you break libc everything will collapse
2006-08-12T05:42:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	apt-get keeps telling me to fix it though
2006-08-12T05:42:00.000Z	asabil	DarthLappy	apt-get update ?
2006-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	Will that fix it? Just reinstall a whole bunch of stuff?
2006-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	asabil	DarthLappy	that won't update, it will reload the list
2006-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	Oops, I read upgrade
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	Wait, what was updating meant to achieve?
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	asabil	DarthLappy	reload package lists
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	And that would gelp how?
2006-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	asabil	DarthLappy	reloading lists and signatures of packages
2006-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	It doesn't seem to have.
2006-08-12T06:01:00.000Z	DarthLappy	asabil	How would I remove the libc package I tried to install?
