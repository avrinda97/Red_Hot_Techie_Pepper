2009-11-21T00:22:00.000Z	hedkandi		hello
2009-11-21T00:22:00.000Z	hedkandi		golly I'm so unhappy can anyone help me?
2009-11-21T00:23:00.000Z	hedkandi		if I enter sudo chown bob file it refuses because I have no user called bob!
2009-11-21T00:23:00.000Z	hedkandi		how do I over-ride this idiot behaviour?
2009-11-21T00:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	hedkandi	how can it make bob owner if bob doesnt exist?
2009-11-21T00:24:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	easily, the owner is maintained independent of the users database
2009-11-21T00:25:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	I can have a string in a database called "bob" because it is three characters how hard it it to maintain three characters?
2009-11-21T00:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	hedkandi	how does bob access file if he isn't a user?
2009-11-21T00:25:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	he doesn't.
2009-11-21T00:25:00.000Z	IdleOne		!register c1h23r456i78910
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	IdleOne		!register | c1h23r456i78910
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	not yet anyway
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	so what if he's not listed in the users database?
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	hedkandi	then he is does not exist
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	I'm not an idiot nube who can't tell the difference between a user and a box of sardines
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	hedkandi	I didn't say you were
2009-11-21T00:27:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	my point is that if I am root, then I can assign ownership as I please
2009-11-21T00:27:00.000Z	hedkandi		My system is not going to break just because I have a file assigned to a non-existant user
2009-11-21T00:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	hedkandi	trying to understand the logic, if there is no user to access file then how can he own file? he does not exist
2009-11-21T00:27:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	as I said, I'm not an idiot nube I know the logic
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	The more powerful logic is to ask whether it is feasible for the system to try to maintain
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	an existant user for every file
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	hedkandi	well then if you know it, you don't seem to understand it. btw just because someone is a nube as you put it does not make them an idiot.
