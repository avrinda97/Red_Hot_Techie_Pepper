2011-08-16T23:33:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Can anybody help with Natty video trouble on HD6000 series? I'm at my wits' end...
2011-08-16T23:35:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	what card specifically are you using?
2011-08-16T23:35:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		I think it's a 6850... let me check
2011-08-16T23:35:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	and do you know what driver you're running?
2011-08-16T23:36:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	it's a 6870, and at the moment i'm on the open source driver
2011-08-16T23:36:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		but I can't install the proprietary drivers, because I literally can't get to my desktop.
2011-08-16T23:36:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	I don't think the open source driver supports the high-end AMD cards just yet...You may need to use the proprietary driver
2011-08-16T23:37:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	I figured as much, and I'm fine with the proprietary driver, but right now I can't even get into my system.
2011-08-16T23:38:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	I've had tons of headaches with my own 4870 and drivers...I feel your pain...In the end it was easiest for me to just reinstall the system
2011-08-16T23:38:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	I'm guessing you hit a black screen when you try to boot
2011-08-16T23:38:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	yeah, that's the trouble -- I'm on my... third clean reinstall, I think?
2011-08-16T23:39:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	do you get any video from a clean install? You may need to boot into recovery mode and install fglrx from the command line
2011-08-16T23:39:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	Not quite. Grub is fine, I see the ubuntu splash, then when my desktop should pop up I get either a quick flashing screen or a weird color.
2011-08-16T23:39:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	how do I do that from GRUB?
2011-08-16T23:40:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	you should see an option just below the regular boot mode that has (recovery mode) next to it
2011-08-16T23:40:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	thanks!
2011-08-16T23:40:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	good luck, hope it works out
2011-08-16T23:40:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	also, how do I upgrade an installed driver
2011-08-16T23:41:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	you can try the regular sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-08-16T23:41:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	I did have a working setup for a time, but tried to install the newest version from AMD and everything was ruined when I uninstalled the old driver
2011-08-16T23:42:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	thanks again
2011-08-16T23:42:00.000Z	rakathan	ForSpareParts	I've had similar experiences...what ended up working for me was this: Install Ubuntu, do all the updates you possibly can without touching the video drivers, install the AMD drivers from their site WITHOUT catalyst control center
2011-08-16T23:43:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	rakathan	thank you! I'll give that a shot.
