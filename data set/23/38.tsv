2012-10-13T14:46:00.000Z	w4|k3r		using lspci?
2012-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	w4|k3r		00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 0126 (rev 09)
2012-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	w4|k3r		01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 0de9 (rev ff)
2012-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	w4|k3r		Yes, and hence compiz is not working fine
2012-10-13T14:49:00.000Z	w4|k3r		plus my display is in 1024x768 mode
2012-10-13T14:49:00.000Z	w4|k3r		which should be higher
2012-10-13T14:49:00.000Z	wols	w4|k3r	which one do you want to use?
2012-10-13T14:49:00.000Z	w4|k3r		the first one, Intel Corp Device
2012-10-13T14:50:00.000Z	wols	w4|k3r	can you disable the nvidia one in BIOS?
2012-10-13T14:50:00.000Z	w4|k3r		In case I do that, will I be able to play games in Win, mine is a dualboot
2012-10-13T14:51:00.000Z	w4|k3r	wols	I read about the same to get this display working
2012-10-13T14:51:00.000Z	wols	w4|k3r	I asked you something
2012-10-13T14:52:00.000Z	w4|k3r	wols	mine is a dualboot, I think I can disable the same in BIOS
2012-10-13T14:52:00.000Z	wols		so you don't want to disable it?
2012-10-13T14:52:00.000Z	wols	w4|k3r	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics
2012-10-13T14:52:00.000Z	w4|k3r	wols	but after that will I be able to play games in win? reason for not disabling
2012-10-13T14:53:00.000Z	w4|k3r	wols	checking that page
2012-10-13T14:54:00.000Z	w4|k3r	wols	if you check that page, it mentions bumblebee, which I have already installed
2012-10-13T14:55:00.000Z	w4|k3r		my gfxCard can be switched now, but the display resolution is still 1024x 768
2012-10-13T14:56:00.000Z	wols	w4|k3r	you don't want to use bumblebee (imho). and if you do, you need to do a lot of manual configuring. but that doesn't make bumblebee any better that the awful crap it is right now
2012-10-13T14:58:00.000Z	w4|k3r	wols	hmm, that means I am stuck with the 1024x768 reso until something comes
2012-10-13T14:58:00.000Z	wols		no. you should simply stop using bumblebee. and check if vgaswitcheroo works
2012-10-13T14:59:00.000Z	w4|k3r	wols	Nope, I checked that -- it is not working
