2009-12-12T20:21:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	what problem you are facing with your USB mouse ?
2009-12-12T20:22:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	the light comes on, but it doesn't work
2009-12-12T20:22:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	also, some of my memory sticks don't work
2009-12-12T20:22:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	the red light of the optical mouse ?
2009-12-12T20:22:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	and also my phone, when I plug it into the USB port, doesn't mount the mass storage devices
2009-12-12T20:22:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	what do you see in /var/log/messages when you plug things ?
2009-12-12T20:23:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	open a terminal and tail -f /var/log/messages then plug the memory stick or ur phone and see what do u get
2009-12-12T20:23:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	I see 2 lines:
2009-12-12T20:23:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	that's for the mouse
2009-12-12T20:24:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	i'm almost facing the same issue with my blackberry, i see the folders but i get "usb 8-2: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 14"
2009-12-12T20:24:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	did you try it from the live CD or USB?
2009-12-12T20:25:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	im on PC and plugged the blackerry to copy photos and got this "usb 8-2: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 14"
2009-12-12T20:25:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	I find that the USB port is only messed up if I boot from the hard drive;  if I boot from a live CD it's fine
2009-12-12T20:25:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	which OS version?
2009-12-12T20:26:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	I'm thinking that reinstalling the appropriate packages may fix it, but don't know which they might be.  it's ubuntu 9.10
2009-12-12T20:27:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	i read onlin ethat the kernel needs usb-storage to be compiled with it
2009-12-12T20:27:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	that's not a package if it's something that has to be built in to the kernel
2009-12-12T20:27:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	and one of my memory sticks still works just fine
2009-12-12T20:30:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	memory sticks might be only only one, i noticed many devices thats not formatted for linux works only on windows
2009-12-12T20:31:00.000Z	dooglus	Bashar	but everything works from the live CD...
2009-12-12T20:32:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	the same exact livecd was installed without any update from ubuntu update for any lib or something ?
2009-12-12T20:33:00.000Z	Bashar	dooglus	i'm going to test my blackberry mass storage on my other windows PC and see if it works or not
