2008-02-25T08:50:00.000Z	biabia		i installed ubuntu, then the xfce and kde desktops, and a bunch of other stuff. is there a way for me to reinstall, wiping everything except whats in my own home folder?
2008-02-25T08:51:00.000Z	biabia		back it up to where
2008-02-25T08:51:00.000Z	biabia		too much stuff to burn onto dvds
2008-02-25T08:52:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	i see
2008-02-25T08:51:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	backup your home folder first :)
2008-02-25T08:51:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	your choice :)
2008-02-25T08:52:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	tricky problem
2008-02-25T08:53:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	so use xubuntu?
2008-02-25T08:53:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	you can uninstall the others. with difficulty
2008-02-25T08:54:00.000Z	biabia	ka2	ya. i want it cleaner than that. im having troubles now because ive played with it so much. too much
2008-02-25T08:55:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	i guess a good reason to have a home partition but a little to late for that
2008-02-25T08:55:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	it might be a good idea
2008-02-25T08:56:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	in the ubuntu installer
2008-02-25T08:56:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	but then you may end up getting rid of your data eek
2008-02-25T08:57:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	maybe all of it
2008-02-25T08:57:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	even likely to happen
2008-02-25T08:59:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	could take a while. thats the problem with big hdds these days
2008-02-25T09:01:00.000Z	biabia	ka2	luckily for me this is an older pc. only an 80 gig drive and only about 60gb full
2008-02-26T08:50:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	which video card?
2008-02-26T08:51:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	really old - nvidia drivers dont support that
2008-02-26T08:52:00.000Z	biabia	ka2	ya. i downloaded a legacy driver and installed it. editing xorg,conf with no backup and it wouldnt boot into gui. lucky i remembered which changes i made
2008-02-26T08:56:00.000Z	biabia	ka2	so i have given up on it. i was hoping to run stepmania but i think its a lost
2008-02-26T08:57:00.000Z	ka2	biabia	that card is **old** it probably wouldnt handle that
