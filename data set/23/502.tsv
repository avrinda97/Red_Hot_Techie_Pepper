2011-07-16T00:59:00.000Z	aidan_follestad		Can someone help me with a networking issue for Ubuntu 11.04? http://paste.ubuntu.com/645010/
2011-07-16T01:00:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	reading...
2011-07-16T01:01:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	I have never done this before but I think it's pretty straight forward what those rules should be.  Why not just change the eth1 to a wlan1 ?
2011-07-16T01:01:00.000Z	aidan_follestad	edbian	I tried doing that, but it didn't work correctly... the file is just reset by Ubuntu after rebooting.
2011-07-16T01:02:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	Let me look more into it.  Give me a few minutes
2011-07-16T01:22:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	I was...
2011-07-16T01:24:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	Look in /etc/modules.conf
2011-07-16T01:25:00.000Z	aidan_follestad	edbian	The file contains 2 lines, the first with "lp", the second with "rtc'.
2011-07-16T01:26:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	I didn't even have it were on Debian.  Still researching
2011-07-16T01:28:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	eth2 is wifi I think
2011-07-16T01:29:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	Back up whats in that file.
2011-07-16T01:29:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	sure
2011-07-16T01:33:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	What did you do to the file? What does it look like right now?
2011-07-16T01:34:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	Can you pastebin it ?
2011-07-16T01:35:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	I think what it did was look in the file for the interfaces.  If it finds them it follows the file.  If not it creates new entries
2011-07-16T01:38:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	What are app are you trying to use that needs it to be wlan0 ?
2011-07-16T01:39:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	Can you do sudo wireshark eth1  ?
2011-07-16T01:41:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	Can you explain that more?
2011-07-16T01:41:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	I just ran wireshark myself and it does not care what the name of the interface is.
2011-07-16T01:42:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	eth1 is the wifi right?
2011-07-16T01:43:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	You can get online, wireshark works.  What do you mean by 'the system' and why does it matter that 'the system' thinks it's ethernet?
2011-07-16T01:43:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	Is the wifi connection online?
2011-07-16T01:46:00.000Z	edbian	aidan_follestad	sure
