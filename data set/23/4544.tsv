2008-05-27T13:39:00.000Z	marco_		i wonder if someone could help me
2008-05-27T13:40:00.000Z	marco_		I have a nightmare trying to install wine......
2008-05-27T13:42:00.000Z	marco_		can someon help me installing wine?
2008-05-27T13:43:00.000Z	marco_		i have tried that
2008-05-27T13:43:00.000Z	marco_		It gave me a strange message
2008-05-27T13:44:00.000Z	marco_		i tried by terminal and throug the synaptic
2008-05-27T13:44:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	if you don't paste the message, we can't help
2008-05-27T14:04:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	have you pasted your sources.list? I missed
2008-05-27T14:07:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	please paste your /etc/apt/sources.list file. there is something really wrong with your package db
2008-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	do you really need the upstream version?
2008-05-27T14:12:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	if you use the wine that's packaged into ubuntu, you won't have this problem
2008-05-27T14:13:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	also, as jbroome noted, you are trying to install the wrong version
2008-05-27T14:14:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	you should in the very least use the package that is meant to run in your version of ubuntu (gutsy, not hardy)
2008-05-27T14:15:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	you also have to remove the one you have, otherwise it will get precedence
2008-05-27T14:22:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	that
2008-05-27T14:23:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	that's because you didn't remove the hardy repository as I told you
2008-05-27T14:23:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	I think the easiest way to remove it is in the GUI
2008-05-27T14:24:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	System>Admin>Soft.Sources, and remove the winebudgetsomething repo you have there
2008-05-27T14:42:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	did you manage to install wine?
2008-05-27T14:50:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	it's big, alright
2008-05-27T14:50:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	are you installing the ubuntu version, or the version from the winehq site?
2008-05-27T14:53:00.000Z	philsf	marco_	then it's the ubuntu version - you're downloading from ubuntu's server
