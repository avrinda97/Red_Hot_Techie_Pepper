2009-11-25T17:58:00.000Z	lcb		on my Ubuntu server 9.10 I just deleted one partition (/dev/sdb1) with 'ALT F2 - gksudo gparted' and moved sdb2 to whole 80 GB hard disk. after rebooting i see the whole (new and only) partition on the drive as /dev/sdb2. Isn't supposed to be sdb1? if the answer is yes how can i solve this?
2009-11-25T18:00:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	open a terminal and type 'sudo fdisk /dev/sdb' then x, f, w, q, and enter after each (you can press m and enter to see what those means)
2009-11-25T18:01:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	thanks, i will :)
2009-11-25T18:01:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	don't forget to update your fstab if needed (ie: if not using uuid)
2009-11-25T18:02:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	ok. thanks a lot
2009-11-25T18:03:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	have a rescue cd at hand, cos it might let your grub wondering
2009-11-25T18:10:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	in this case i should use 'f' option in order to fix partition order, isn't? sorry, i'm just afraid of deleting existing data on sdb.
2009-11-25T18:12:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	yes f to fix, and dont worry, it won't happen anything  untill you enter w
2009-11-25T18:13:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	thanks friend, i appreciate your time to answer these newbies matters :)
2009-11-25T18:14:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	hey... and if i enter w afterwards... do i loose data?
2009-11-25T18:15:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	no, if you didn't touch anything else, you're good to go
2009-11-25T18:16:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	use p to see if the order changed
2009-11-25T18:17:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	after 'f' it says "nothing to do. ordering is correct already". so i guess it stays as is (sdb2)
2009-11-25T18:19:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	you do actually use the unassigned space, right?
2009-11-25T18:19:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	the whole disk
2009-11-25T18:19:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	nothing left on the disk
2009-11-25T18:20:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	that's whi i am admired in being sdb2 instead of sdb1
2009-11-25T18:20:00.000Z	lcb		whi / why
2009-11-25T18:21:00.000Z	fbianconi	lcb	weird
2009-11-25T18:21:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	i'll keep trying to check what's going on. thanks a lot for your help, it gaves me more ways of exploring this
2009-11-25T18:26:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	the only matter that's might be workable is when i enter sudo fdisk /dev/sdb it says: "the number of cylinders for this disk is set to 9733. There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024, and could in certain setups cause problems with: 1. software that runs at boot time (e.g. old lolo) 2 - booting and partitioning software from othet OSs
2009-11-25T18:30:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	if this helps and is relevant (and i forgot to point) the disk is in ext3
2009-11-25T18:34:00.000Z	lcb	fbianconi	i'm going to physically detach the hard drive, reboot, reboot again, connect it and see what the order might be.
