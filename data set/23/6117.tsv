2012-09-21T03:50:00.000Z	malte		Hi...Can someone tell me how the $PATH variable is set BEFORE the local .bashrc file is called?
2012-09-21T03:51:00.000Z	jrib	malte	why?
2012-09-21T03:52:00.000Z	malte	jrib	because some weird paths are in there everytime a open a new shell. However, these paths do not appear in my .bashrc file, so they have to come from somewhere else.
2012-09-21T03:53:00.000Z	jrib	malte	what kind of weird paths?  Check /etc/environment (I don't think this is used for path though), /etc/bash*, and /etc/profile*
2012-09-21T03:57:00.000Z	jrib	malte	you should say what these "weird paths" you refer to actually are
2012-09-21T03:57:00.000Z	jrib	malte	I don't see any paths in what you said
2012-09-21T03:59:00.000Z	jrib	malte	yes, we understand your problem.  If you give us information we ask about, we can try to help you.
2012-09-21T04:00:00.000Z	jrib	malte	sure, paste the output of « echo $PATH »
2012-09-21T04:08:00.000Z	jrib	malte	pastebin result of « ls ~/.bash* ~/.profile »
2012-09-21T04:11:00.000Z	jrib	malte	pastebin the contents of your ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile
2012-09-21T04:13:00.000Z	jrib	malte	while you do that, when you need to add something to your PATH, what do *you* do?
2012-09-21T04:15:00.000Z	jrib	malte	yes, you have a few additions like that in your .bashrc.  Which part of your PATH exactly are you not sure where it comes from?
2012-09-21T04:17:00.000Z	malte	jrib	most of the things that are in the past before the past gets "filled" by the .bashrc. Especially the path to my "old" eclipse installation
2012-09-21T04:19:00.000Z	jrib	malte	get rid of all these PATH manipulations you have in your .bashrc, and put them in your .profile instead
2012-09-21T04:22:00.000Z	malte	jrib	did this. Now ONLY the old paths are there, the new ones weren't added at all.
2012-09-21T04:22:00.000Z	jrib	malte	what new ones?
2012-09-21T04:22:00.000Z	malte	jrib	the ones i  put in the .profile
2012-09-21T04:22:00.000Z	jrib	malte	pastebin the relevant configuration files, and what your PATH looks like, and what you want it to look like
2012-09-21T04:24:00.000Z	jrib	malte	by the way, you need to log out and back in for .profile to be read.  If you want to just source it for your current shell, you can do « source ~/.profile »
2012-09-21T04:28:00.000Z	malte	jrib	IT WORKS! Ok, I really had to log out from my account! I thought opening another shell or just sourcing the new altered.bashrc file was enough.
2012-09-21T04:28:00.000Z	malte	jrib	Thanks a lot for your time and your help!
2012-09-21T04:31:00.000Z	jrib	malte	no problem.  Basically, that ~/.profile gets executed one time at login, but your .bashrc gets executed at login (because .profile sources it) and also when you open a new shell
2012-09-21T04:32:00.000Z	malte	jrib	didn't know that. Again, thanks again and good night!
