2012-10-23T17:02:00.000Z	[twisti]		hello, i have a question: when i did apt-get install logwatch, i got this message:
2012-10-23T17:02:00.000Z	[twisti]		Suggested packages:
2012-10-23T17:02:00.000Z	[twisti]		  fortune-mod
2012-10-23T17:02:00.000Z	[twisti]		this isnt the first time i saw that 'suggested' thing too
2012-10-23T17:02:00.000Z	[twisti]		but how do i find out more ?
2012-10-23T17:03:00.000Z	[twisti]		trying to put the name on google just gives things like file lists or package size
2012-10-23T17:03:00.000Z	[twisti]		but how do i learn what that ACTUALLY IS and why it was suggested ?
2012-10-23T17:03:00.000Z	nydel	[twisti]	why not browse the source code of the application you're installing?
2012-10-23T17:04:00.000Z	[twisti]	nydel	is that a joke ?
2012-10-23T17:04:00.000Z	[twisti]		you think im going to learn a new programming language and randomly read through source to find out what a piece of software does ?
2012-10-23T17:04:00.000Z	nydel	[twisti]	no, sorry. it sounds like you want to learn & you're not quite sure /what/ you want to learn, right?
2012-10-23T17:04:00.000Z	[twisti]		no, im very sure: i want to learn what that package is
2012-10-23T17:04:00.000Z	nydel	[twisti]	oh i'm sorry i thought you were asking about how to just keep learning
2012-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	[twisti]		theres no way there arent descriptions somewhere
2012-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	nydel	[twisti]	usually the search string "ubuntu package "name"" will bring you a page with descriptions
2012-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	nydel	[twisti]	let me see about that particular package
2012-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	[twisti]		yeah, i got this
2012-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	[twisti]		http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/fortune-mod
2012-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	[twisti]		but thats not really helpful to people who dont know what it is
2012-10-23T17:05:00.000Z	[twisti]		thanks
2012-10-23T17:06:00.000Z	nydel		yes [twisti] see here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fortune-mod
2012-10-23T17:06:00.000Z	[twisti]		and thank llutz too
2012-10-23T17:06:00.000Z	nydel	[twisti]	most of the ubuntu packages that will be suggested will have a page on launchpad. from there you can view the readme or source etc & find what a package does / is for etc.
