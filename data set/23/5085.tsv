2007-02-24T11:42:00.000Z	bula		no wonder u guys didnt respond to me lol
2007-02-24T11:42:00.000Z	bula		i dont wanna look too silly =/
2007-02-24T11:43:00.000Z	bula		ok. my first question may sound super silly.  but i was wondering if there is a good reason to switch to ubuntu.  i have windows and it seems boring compared to videos i have seen of what people have done with ubuntu and other things like xgl
2007-02-24T11:44:00.000Z	bula		is it super hard to set up ubuntu and stuff?   like lots of the drivers and programs that i use everyday are mainly for windows right?  example ventrilo, world of warcraft and some other things.
2007-02-24T11:45:00.000Z	bula		well all i did on the cd was get on like aim and firefox.  i have a junky geforce 6800 non ultra and integrated sound and ethernet on my lanparty ut 250 thingy

2007-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	GaiaX11	bula	Why do you want to hear?
2007-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	bula	GaiaX11	usually when my computer is working i can hear my hard drive clicking
2007-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	GaiaX11	bula	http://osmirrors.cerias.purdue.edu/pub/ubuntu-releases/edgy/   I would suggest you the alternate PC (Intel x86) alternate install CD
2007-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	bula	GaiaX11	so use that intel install even though i have amd64 correct?
2007-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	GaiaX11	bula	Have a look in the page and read the 3 alternates infos
2007-02-24T12:59:00.000Z	bula	GaiaX11	what exactly is this alternate install going to do?  it has a few bullets of extra options that i dont think fit my situation.
