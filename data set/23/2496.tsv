2009-03-23T22:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	thewrath	what does this return??
2009-03-23T22:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	thewrath	btw why these drivers the one in repo dont work?

2009-03-23T22:54:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	thewrath	use sudo when you get permission denied, are the makes working fine?
2009-03-23T22:58:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	thewrath	do rmmods and then do the insmod
2009-03-23T23:00:00.000Z	thewrath	arvind_khadri	i get the same error: insmod: error inserting 'wl.ko': -1 File exists
2009-03-23T23:03:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	thewrath	are you sure you have the correct tar ball?
2009-03-23T23:05:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	thewrath	ok , after modprobe, do the insmod with the correct path, sudo insmod <path>/<filename>
