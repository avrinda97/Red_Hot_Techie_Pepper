2011-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	oddtod		hello, I am trying to use Ubuntu to connect to my home VPN. I have the pem file ip and password correctly set. I have tried creating a tap device by adding in a br0 device in /etc/network/interfaces restarted networking. I get connection timed out when i try to connect. I know the VPN is operational because I can connect on windows side.
2011-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	what kind of vpn?
2011-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	openvpn running on endian**
2011-01-15T23:53:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	Do you get any errors on the server side or the client side?
2011-01-15T23:54:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	its the client. i get 'connection to the server timed out' The server is functional because if i were to sign in now with M$ it would work properly
2011-01-15T23:54:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	did you set the port correctly on the client?
2011-01-15T23:56:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	yeah it is default 1194 but I set I manually configured it to 1194 in the connection manager
2011-01-15T23:57:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	are you using network manager to set this up?
2011-01-15T23:58:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	I set up the VPN connection with the connection manager yes
2011-01-15T23:58:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	I was never able to get that working, I installed the openvpn client from apt and configured it that way.
2011-01-15T23:58:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	Ok I will set that up and report back. Thanks for your assistance
2011-01-16T00:00:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	just the 'openvpn' package?
2011-01-16T00:00:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	yeah
2011-01-16T00:01:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	I have /etc/openvpn/client.conf, and I start and stop it using "sudo service openvpn start client" and "sudo service openvpn stop"
2011-01-16T00:02:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	thanks very useful information. I hate when things are easier to do in windows then in linux :(. this is so plug and play in windows.
2011-01-16T00:03:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	yeah, I banged up against the network manager a few times... for wifi or just dhcp it's awesome... but... that seems to be about it's limit.
2011-01-16T00:04:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	yeah this isn't the first time I have had issues with it before. I'll report back about how it goes.
2011-01-16T00:36:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	no dice it says 'ok' but never connects :( I am going to try and do it through CLI. I changed 'dev tap' to 'dev br0' is this correct or should it be tap
2011-01-16T00:38:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	tap
2011-01-16T00:41:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	http://paste.lopsa.org/74
2011-01-16T00:42:00.000Z	greppy	oddtod	that's a slightly sanitized copy of my client.conf on my laptop
2011-01-16T00:45:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	thank you I am going to try it again now.
2011-01-20T05:53:00.000Z	oddtod	greppy	Heyo greppy
