2010-09-07T09:17:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	no problems there, you may have run grub-install incorrctly
2010-09-07T09:17:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	what was the command you issued?
2010-09-07T09:18:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	what was the mount command?
2010-09-07T09:18:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	did you create agrub.cfg file?
2010-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	yes, thats the problem
2010-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	nope, it assumes nothing
2010-09-07T09:20:00.000Z	white_magic	pfifo	well, how do i install grub.cfg then?
2010-09-07T09:20:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	google for an example grub.cfg and copypasta it then edit for your system
2010-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	to fix the mbr and install all the modules
2010-09-07T09:40:00.000Z	white_magic	pfifo	so i went through dpac_'s linked tutorial, and I most definitely have a grub.cfg.. yet i still get grub commandline when i boot
2010-09-07T10:15:00.000Z	pfifo	white_magic	google changes their homepage more often than i change my underwear, this is nothing special
