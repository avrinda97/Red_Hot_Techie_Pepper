2010-10-30T19:30:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	my session ubuntu deconnect only
2010-10-30T19:30:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	Sorry, I didn't get that one?
2010-10-30T19:33:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	Are you connected through VNC/RDP, Or are you talking about X-server?
2010-10-30T19:34:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	I'm morocan
2010-10-30T19:35:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	That happens sometimes in Karmic. If you are on that, I will suggest you to upgrade to Lucid.
2010-10-30T19:35:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	I'm using now the last virsion
2010-10-30T19:35:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	This is a known bug, and I don't think there has been a fix for it yet, at least for karmic.
2010-10-30T19:36:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	10.10? Hmm. Does it happen after you have stayed idle for some time? Or while you are doing something?
2010-10-30T19:37:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	English is not my first language either, so don't feel weird :), I will try to understand you to the best of my effort.
2010-10-30T19:37:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	I don't know  it's happen usuly
2010-10-30T19:38:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	you speak arabic
2010-10-30T19:38:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	Nope. I can read Arabic only.
2010-10-30T19:39:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	DO you get a dialogue box saying .... is running in low graphics mode?
2010-10-30T19:41:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	the room is empty :D
2010-10-30T19:41:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	Do you get a window telling you that Ubuntu is running in low-graphics mode, and X-server needs to restart. Or something of this sort? What sort of disconnection you meant other than this?
2010-10-30T19:42:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	no think just deconnect
2010-10-30T19:44:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	Disconnect from what? I am guessing you lose your desktop and stuff, so after that what sort of a message or warning or window do you get? Or just a log in screen?
2010-10-30T19:45:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	I  see nothink just the log screen to log on
2010-10-30T19:47:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	That usually happens in Karmic, but maybe it also happens in Lucid+ when the x-server crashes all together. If it happens when your computer has been idle for a while, try to disable screensaver [System > Preferences > Screensaver] and any Power manageement options.
2010-10-30T19:47:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	Which graphics card do you have?
2010-10-30T19:52:00.000Z	m3asmi	asad-ahmad	how can I know it
2010-10-30T19:54:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	m3asmi	type "lspci" in terminal, and then tell the line which starts with "VGA compatible controller:"
