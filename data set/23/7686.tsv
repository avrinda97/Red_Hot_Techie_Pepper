2005-06-28T05:24:00.000Z	sproingie		r00t but not root?
2005-06-28T05:24:00.000Z	sproingie		"i  accidentally untarred a gentoo uclibc stage1 into / instead of /chroot, help!"
2005-06-28T05:25:00.000Z	sproingie		of course i would have had to untar it as root anyway
2005-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	thats what 3 500gb HDs are for
2005-06-29T08:05:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	and it'll start up on every xterm you launch
2005-06-29T08:06:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	really? so where would it go then?
2005-06-29T08:22:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	i hope the Cell lives up to its hype
2005-07-27T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	#flood
2005-07-27T09:02:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	yeah but that's a nasty hack
2005-07-27T09:03:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	i guess a pasteserv wouldn't have all that nice hilighting and commenting either
2005-09-21T07:53:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	x is in active developement, i think (i get x updates each time i update)
2005-09-21T07:54:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	i surmise I'm using a debugging build then?
2005-09-21T07:54:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	breezy is in debugging stage, yes
2005-09-21T07:55:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	ok.  just curious whether it was just me or not
2005-09-25T07:19:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	i've found a win32 port of an actual 'ssh' client
2005-09-25T07:20:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	there's plenty.  i use putty for its nice terminal window
2005-10-11T08:43:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	dont even go there (german is hard to learn)
2005-10-11T08:46:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	cyrillic is easy
2005-10-18T08:59:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	huh, i never figured that version convention before.  tho with debian and ubuntu, i hardly ever speak of version numbers, just names
2005-10-20T13:36:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	removing ubuntu-desktop doesnt not remove anythig but a metapkg
2005-10-20T13:36:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	if the others were installed as a dependency, it should try to remove them too.  or maybe that's just an aptitude thing
2005-10-20T13:37:00.000Z	nalioth	sproingie	ubuntu-desktop depensd on many programs (instaling it)  but no programs depend on it, so when you remove ubuntu-desktop, nothing else leaves
2005-10-20T13:39:00.000Z	sproingie	nalioth	right .. i'm too used to aptitude, but gnome wasn't installed that way
