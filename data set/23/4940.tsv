2007-04-04T06:49:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	well.. surely you know more than me :o)
2007-04-04T06:49:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	well, I will do what I can...what's up?
2007-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	I just need help troubleshooting why I don't see any channels in MythTV or xawtv (scantv)
2007-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	what capture card do you have?
2007-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	hauppauge pvr-500
2007-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	sweet...same as me
2007-04-04T06:50:00.000Z	Cdeszaq		hmm
2007-04-04T06:51:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	do you have mplayer installed?
2007-04-04T06:51:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	nice :o) xawtv shows a black screen, but mplayer shows me the static I expected if I play /dev/video0
2007-04-04T06:51:00.000Z	Arnar_		yup..
2007-04-04T06:51:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	can I change the channels in mplayer?
2007-04-04T06:51:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	I am not sure...I think so, but I do not know how
2007-04-04T06:52:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	What sort of signal do you have going into the card? Cable, antena?
2007-04-04T06:52:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	antenna.. pal
2007-04-04T06:52:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	hmm...I do not know much about antena signals, nor pal...
2007-04-04T06:53:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	did you try the #mythtv channel?
2007-04-04T06:53:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	yeah.. I came here for that but there's no such channel.. isn't it supposed to be on freenode?
2007-04-04T06:54:00.000Z	Cdeszaq	Arnar_	yes...#mythtv-users will get you there
2007-04-04T06:55:00.000Z	Arnar_	Cdeszaq	ahh.. I didn't have the # in there - used to mirc adding it for me :)
