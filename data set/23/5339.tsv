2006-12-27T09:04:00.000Z	ChaosR		someone here that can explain me how to let multiple programs use the sound at the same time, or is this impossible????
2006-12-27T09:05:00.000Z	ChaosR		!sound
2006-12-27T09:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	I found a quick and easy solution that might work for you is to run programs with "aoss"... try installing the package "alsa-oss" and the running commands like "aoss firefox". But check with ubotu's solution first.
2006-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	actually which 'file' in /dev is for alsamixer
2006-12-27T09:28:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	not what i ment
2006-12-27T09:29:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	i mean, like i have amarok (using ALSA) and GNOME, also using also, when i listen to music using amarok, GNOME won't be able to play sounds
2006-12-27T09:30:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	or anyone else: do you know a way to fix this
2006-12-27T09:30:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	Mmm... Soooounds like you're using OSS instead of alsa. Try working with Alsa.... Ubuntu said something to you when you typed !sound
2006-12-27T09:30:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	no OSS here, everything is using ALSA
2006-12-27T09:31:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	That second link Ubotu sent might be of more help than I am.
2006-12-27T09:33:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	I remember having problems like that a while back... are you on < 6.06?
2006-12-27T09:34:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	installed this one 12 days go, newest iso, installed all updates, so, no
2006-12-27T09:35:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	Ouch. I'm sorry man, I'm not real good on sound problems.
2006-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	which file is for ALSA, i'll try to manually set it to ALSA, to make absolutly sure it is using ALSA
2006-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	I've had problems with some programs not using ALSA... You said its amarok and gnome right? Try installing "alsa-oss" (apt-get install alsa-oss) and running amarok with "aoss amarok"
2006-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	nevermind, altough it was set to ALSA it was still using OSS
2006-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	Alternatively, make sure that Amarok's using Alsa.
2006-12-27T09:38:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	Haha :P Worst case if you ever get programs that won't use anything BUT OSS, you can use aoss.
2006-12-27T09:39:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	now i've found the real problem
2006-12-27T09:39:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	Mmm?
2006-12-27T09:39:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	in the sound setting it's set to ALSA but using OSS, i've set it to OSS, and back to ALSA, and everything works :D
2006-12-27T09:40:00.000Z	rukuartic	ChaosR	Horay!
2006-12-27T09:41:00.000Z	ChaosR	rukuartic	anyway, thanks
