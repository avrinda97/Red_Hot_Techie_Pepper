2007-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	Avt		hi
2007-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	Avt		who see me?
2007-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	Avt		can you guys see me??
2007-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	Avt		how to update firefox? sudo su apt-get update firefox? in dapper
2007-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	sure we do
2007-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude upgrade
2007-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	no, wait, no.
2007-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	how long have you been without updating your system with security updates and such?
2007-12-28T13:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	well, basically update and upgrade should be enough unless you want to upgrade them to a version dapper repos don't have
2007-12-28T13:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	what have you done basically
2007-12-28T13:07:00.000Z	Avt	Myrtti	can you see my tut and tell me what im missing?
2007-12-28T13:12:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	first of all, forget all the "sudo su"-stuff
2007-12-28T13:14:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	well yes. doing it with all the command still having sudo in front of them equals into nothing at all
2007-12-28T13:14:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	and doing "sudo su" can be replaced by other commands, safer than it.
2007-12-28T13:29:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	so what was your original problem again, the backup or firefox updates
2007-12-28T13:30:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	the normal upgrade procedure should be enough unless you really really want to update them to a version not in dapper repos
2007-12-28T13:32:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	dapper currently has 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.14~prepatch071125a-0ubuntu1
2007-12-28T13:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	sudo aptitude update, sudo aptitude upgrade
2007-12-28T13:37:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	nope
2007-12-28T13:38:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	those commands actually upgrade your *whole* system to up to date
2007-12-28T13:39:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	hrmmm
2007-12-29T04:19:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	you don't have root
2007-12-29T04:19:00.000Z	Myrtti	Avt	you shouldn't have root
