2010-08-13T03:05:00.000Z	headkase314	ZykoticK9	the system I did have it happen on was using nvidia.com drivers.  All the more reason to stick with the official repo in that case! ;)
2010-08-13T03:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	headkase314	agreed!

2010-08-15T07:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	headkase314	you really should consider using Chromium over Chrome - just for the open source, reporting bugs in ubuntu fact.  Only an opion - please don't take offence :)
2010-08-15T07:32:00.000Z	headkase314	ZykoticK9	you are correct Chromium should be used over Chrome - I have no excuse ;)
