2005-07-30T05:08:00.000Z	skel_		they got there own packages syetm
2005-07-30T05:08:00.000Z	skel_		it sucks
2005-07-30T05:08:00.000Z	skel_		:P
2005-07-30T05:09:00.000Z	skel_		hard to use i heard
2005-07-30T05:11:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	it's pretty cool you should stick with it
2005-07-30T05:11:00.000Z	skel_	postmodern	 i suck using grub
2005-07-30T05:11:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	na grub is so easy
2005-07-30T05:13:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	im thinking of open sourcing it
2005-07-30T05:13:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	but its still very not so user friendly
2005-07-30T05:13:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	alot of it requires you to make a directory of all the files that will be copied into / of your new system
2005-07-30T05:16:00.000Z	skel_	postmodern	 i didn tknow what they were so i skipped useflags and CFlags during install
2005-07-30T05:16:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	USEflags are a blessing and a curse
2005-07-30T05:16:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	oneside you can control alot of stuff, the other stupid useflags keep getting enabled by default
2005-07-30T05:16:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	like they disalbed the "network" useflag by default
2005-07-30T05:17:00.000Z	skel_	postmodern	 whats the diff between penitum 4 install and a univerisal install
2005-07-30T05:20:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	universal i beleive is just a default unoptimized stage file
2005-07-30T05:20:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	so its x86 generic
2005-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	amd64 is pure heaven (assuming you get the right hardware)
2005-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	xorg took like 40 minutes to compile
2005-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	stage1 with -O3 took an 1ish
2005-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	one hour-ish
2005-07-30T05:22:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	its great if you do alot of development work
2005-07-30T05:23:00.000Z	postmodern	skel_	after a couple stage3 installs by hand you get into "the zone"
