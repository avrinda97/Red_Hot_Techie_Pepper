2009-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	code	xt28	hi, have a prob with xserver not loading
2009-11-10T03:30:00.000Z	xt28	code	shoot!
2009-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	code	xt28	 Did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. Then xorg.conf was moved as old. The backup was moved as xorg.conf.
2009-11-10T03:32:00.000Z	code	xt28	gdm restarted
2009-11-10T03:33:00.000Z	code	xt28	No response. So then did startx. This displayed some a message
2009-11-10T03:34:00.000Z	code	xt28	It said, Xkbcomp - Reports: Type (one_level) has 1 level, but RALT has 2 symbols
2009-11-10T03:37:00.000Z	xt28	code	do you even need an xorg.conf? nowadays, X usually works without one.
2009-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	code	xt28	RALT  was an option i selected during reconfig of xserver. So which option would work apart from RALT?
2009-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	code	xt28	this is a new install and i dont know much about gui.
2009-11-10T03:39:00.000Z	code	xt28	 so im just trying to make sense of how to get gui back as it was
2009-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	code	xt28	did you see pastebin. What do you suggest?
2009-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	xt28	code	this is just a wild guess, but try renaming xorg.conf to something else (mv -i /etc/xorg.conf /etc/xorg.conf.bak) and restarting gdm (invoke-rc.d gdm restart).
2009-11-10T03:41:00.000Z	code	xt28	if xorg.conf is not needed how should it be on jaunty?
2009-11-10T03:42:00.000Z	xt28	code	how should what be on jaunty?
2009-11-10T03:45:00.000Z	code	xt28	you said if xorg.conf is needed. x works without nowadays?
2009-11-10T03:47:00.000Z	xt28	code	yes. X usually works fine without an xorg.conf file.
2009-11-10T03:49:00.000Z	code	xt28	so whats the way to go forward. I used startx last time and (xkbcomp) showed messages about RALT not be the correct option. It has 2 symbols, but type (one_level) has 1 level?
2009-11-10T03:51:00.000Z	xt28	code	have you tried what i suggested above?
2009-11-10T03:54:00.000Z	code	xt28	was waiting to get reply, but instead of using invoke-rc.d can i use /etc/init.d/gdm restart?
2009-11-10T03:54:00.000Z	xt28	code	sure.
2009-11-10T03:55:00.000Z	xt28	code	invoke-rc.d just does that anyway.
2009-11-10T03:55:00.000Z	xt28	code	it's just more debian-ish...
2009-11-10T03:55:00.000Z	code	xt28	thanks, doing it. will boot out of vista & into jaunty
