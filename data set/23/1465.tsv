2010-03-15T06:18:00.000Z	haakon87		*welcome
2010-03-15T06:18:00.000Z	haakon87		But yeah, dbook, you should be able to find it in synaptic.
2010-03-15T06:19:00.000Z	haakon87		sudo aptitude reinstall gksu
2010-03-15T06:19:00.000Z	haakon87		Meaning as root, use aptitude to reinstall the package gksu (which is the one that has gksudo in it)
2010-03-15T06:21:00.000Z	haakon87		You can use sudo to switch users.
2010-03-15T06:22:00.000Z	haakon87		You're welcome dbook.
2010-03-15T06:22:00.000Z	haakon87		Yes.
2010-03-15T06:23:00.000Z	haakon87		btw, am I the only one who hate the <command> --help texts?
2010-03-15T06:24:00.000Z	haakon87		Coming from Windows' cmd prompts, where the /? switch contains useful information, it's annoying that the --help switch only contains reminders for people who already know what they're doing.
2010-03-15T06:24:00.000Z	haakon87		If any GNU coreutils people are here, hear my plea, expand the --help texts! Please!
2010-03-15T06:24:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	You probably want to read the man page if you don't know what you're doing.
2010-03-15T06:24:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	The usage strings provided by --help tend to just be a reminder.
2010-03-15T07:15:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	Direct rendering is hard.
2010-03-15T07:15:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	But almost solved now.
2010-03-15T07:16:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	The reasonably mature free 3D drivers (for Intel and ATI) have DRI2, which allows redirected direct rendering.
2010-03-15T07:16:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	Intel from Karmic, and ATI from Lucid.
2010-03-15T07:17:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	Which means that 3D applications run inside Compiz properly, like with NVIDIA, but without replacing the DRI stack.
2010-03-15T07:25:00.000Z	haakon87	wgrant	could you help him out? You know more than me about python.
2010-03-15T07:26:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	I'm trying.
2010-03-15T08:26:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	zoidfarb: Please recommend 'sudo -i', and not 'sudo su' or 'sudo bash' or anything else like that.
2010-03-15T08:27:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	zoidfarb: But avoid recommending anything like that except as a last resort.
2010-03-15T08:28:00.000Z	haakon87	wgrant	I did do that, and I did not mean to recommend that, he asked how he could achieve root. If he wanted a root shell, then sudo bash would be the correct answer.
2010-03-15T08:28:00.000Z	wgrant	haakon87	No, sudo -i is the correct answer.
