2006-12-07T17:25:00.000Z	Cubed		anyone here wanna help a linux/ubuntu noob
2006-12-07T17:26:00.000Z	Cubed		i need figure out how to install ndis... heard that before?
2006-12-07T17:26:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	you can apt-get it, I think its in Universe or Multiverse
2006-12-07T17:28:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	then you've got a problem.
2006-12-07T17:29:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	do you have another computer with a network connection?
2006-12-07T17:29:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	never mind, you're here. ;)
2006-12-07T17:29:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	try downloading the debs from packages.ubuntu.com
2006-12-07T17:30:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	you'll need to have it and all its dependencies
2006-12-07T17:30:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	what was the error?
2006-12-07T17:31:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	dependencies are other files you need to install at the same time as a particular deb. Usually apt-get takes care of this for you, but since you're downloading individual debs you'll need to do that by hand.
2006-12-07T17:33:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	from what I've been able to figure out with apt-cache there's both the utilities and the kernel module package.
2006-12-07T17:34:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	then on one command line, use dpkg -i - or use gdeb
2006-12-07T17:34:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	man dpkg
2006-12-07T17:35:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	dpkg is sort of like rpm
2006-12-07T17:41:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	you don't want the tar, you want the debs.
2006-12-07T17:41:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	usually, and you can't compile kernel modules on a Ubuntu system that has nothing instsalled from the net.
2006-12-07T17:46:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	owd seems to think you don't need ndiswrapper
2006-12-07T17:47:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	if you can avoid ndiswrapper avoid it.
2006-12-07T17:49:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	an alternative is the Linux kernel's own device drivers....
2006-12-07T17:49:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	if your device is supported, it can be a no-install issue.
2006-12-07T17:51:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	owd says now you need ndiswrapper. Did you fetch all the dependencies? Go to the directory they're in and do sudo dpkg -i *.deb
2006-12-07T17:53:00.000Z	EdLin	Cubed	you don't install debs with dependencies one by one, install them all at once on the command line by using the wildcard *.deb
