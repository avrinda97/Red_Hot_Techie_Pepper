2004-10-19T10:25:00.000Z	phlaegel		install build-essential ?
2004-10-19T10:27:00.000Z	phlaegel		try libgtk-cil
2004-10-19T10:28:00.000Z	phlaegel		interestingly, I have no gdk packages installed at all, but older tomboy cvs *did* build.
2004-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	phlaegel		not really, the majority of ubuntu's target audience does not need dev tools
2004-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	phlaegel		average people do not compile source. they've never even heard of it.
2004-10-19T10:30:00.000Z	phlaegel		average is the wrong word. I think 'most' is the right word.
2004-10-19T10:32:00.000Z	phlaegel		no you don't. and you don't progress by doing things the way you've always done them.
2004-10-19T10:32:00.000Z	phlaegel		I think the only thing I've compiled on ubuntu so far is tomboy, just because I want to see if I can contribute. not an average user kind of thing.
2004-10-19T10:33:00.000Z	phlaegel		<average user> encryption? I just want to talk to my friends!!!!1
2004-10-19T10:33:00.000Z	phlaegel		s/to/2/g ;-)
2004-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	phlaegel	just show them ethereal output from when they're chatting
2004-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	phlaegel		no, it shouldn't. people want to *use* computers, not *manage* them.
2004-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	phlaegel	"I can read what you're saying"
2004-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	phlaegel		<average user> so? I don't have anything to hide
2004-10-19T10:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	phlaegel	Ah, so you don't lock the door when you go to the toilet?
2004-10-19T10:35:00.000Z	phlaegel		heh... I didn't say it was my arguement...
2004-10-19T10:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	phlaegel	I know, it's just that for every 'common user' statement there's a counterargument
2004-10-19T10:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	phlaegel	"Would you write this on a postcard?" is a nice one ;)
2004-10-19T10:36:00.000Z	phlaegel		true, and the average users don't care. I've tried.
2004-10-19T10:36:00.000Z	phlaegel		ok, most average users. some get it with good explanations.
2004-10-19T10:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	phlaegel	but I agree, it should be as automatic as possible
2004-10-19T10:37:00.000Z	phlaegel	Treenaks	which is why I like ubuntu so much so far. they seem to be on the same wavelength as me. :-)
2004-10-19T10:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	phlaegel	same here :)
