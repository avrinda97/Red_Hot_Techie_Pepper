2005-04-03T10:10:00.000Z	codyman		is there anyway to speedup konquerer's web page browsing speed.. its god awfully slow
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 prelink
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	codyman	Roey	how
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 run prelink on all the binaries
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 apt-get install prelink
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	codyman	Roey	thanks
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 then prelink the libraries and binaries
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 ask in #kde though first
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 because I don't know why it's not already prelinked... there must be some reason...
2005-04-03T10:12:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 ah, ok
2005-04-03T10:12:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 note, I don't knowhow safe this is
2005-04-03T11:03:00.000Z	codyman	Roey	I am very pleased about KDE 3.4
2005-04-03T11:03:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 aye
2005-04-03T11:04:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 what do you like about it?
2005-04-03T11:04:00.000Z	codyman	Roey	Well first of all very fast.. also the new interface reminds me of an os x like feeling but with still keeping the linux roots intact
2005-04-03T11:05:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 do you think there was anything unclear about the interface? for example, sometimes I think Konqueror's sidebar is too cluttered.. I barely useit
2005-04-03T11:06:00.000Z	codyman	Roey	yes the sidebar likes to try to grab your attention a little too much sometimes.. its not too bad but I did notice that
2005-04-03T11:06:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 sometimes toobars appear to be stuffed with buttons -- I almost never use any of them
2005-04-03T11:07:00.000Z	codyman	Roey	Yes but gnomes toolbar I find with that "spacial" stuff they use is too minimalistic
2005-04-03T11:07:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 also, I think this translucency thing in KDE was rushed;  why enable support for it when the underlying infrastructure isn't stable??
2005-04-03T11:09:00.000Z	codyman	Roey	I am having no problems with translcuentsy.. on my notebook.. i installed kubuntu and it started right up with nvidia drivers already configured and ready to go.. I get barely any cpu use and it has been a very clean install with very little loose ends to catch up on... cleanest linux installation yet
2005-04-03T11:10:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 also, foci would have also worked (foci and focuss are synonyms)
2005-04-03T11:10:00.000Z	Roey	codyman	 hmm, I have an nvidia ti4200 and it gets very laggy with kcompmgr runnimng.
