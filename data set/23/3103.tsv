2008-07-26T01:43:00.000Z	RYknow		How can I get all the data from his old one, to the knew one
2008-07-26T01:43:00.000Z	RYknow		new*
2008-07-26T01:43:00.000Z	RYknow		He already shipped his 360 out, and got it back. It works like a charm.
2008-07-26T01:43:00.000Z	RYknow		But...
2008-07-26T01:43:00.000Z	RYknow		All his saved data is on the 20 gig drive of his old one.
2008-07-26T01:44:00.000Z	RYknow		So there's no simple way to network a 360?
2008-07-26T01:44:00.000Z	RYknow		I was going to try putting it on my network here, but thats useless?
2008-07-26T01:44:00.000Z	RYknow		Ok..
2008-07-26T01:45:00.000Z	RYknow		Is there a way to do it with Windows MCE?
2008-07-26T01:45:00.000Z	RYknow		I assume not?
2008-07-26T01:45:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	of course there is
2008-07-26T01:45:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	are you talking about streaming?
2008-07-26T01:47:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	yeah uh the 360 isnt hacked... the only hacked the fw
2008-07-26T01:48:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	thats possible
2008-07-26T01:49:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	im on irssi so i cant pm you, but yes you can clone the hdd, I have a 360 my self with a cloned hdd
2008-07-26T01:50:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	but I removed the casing and mounted the hdd with my SATA
2008-07-26T01:51:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	thats what i did, it will void your warranty
2008-07-26T01:51:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	the 360 hdd is just a tiny 2.5" hdd with SATA
2008-07-26T01:53:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	is it just the saves you want?
2008-07-26T01:55:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	xploder360 <--
2008-07-26T01:56:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	its a tool to transfer just the saves, my solution = the entire hdd
2008-07-26T01:56:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	that tool will only transfer the saves, my way (sata) clones the entire hdd
2008-07-26T01:57:00.000Z	rwk424x	RYknow	i have to go now, good luck dude, xploder360 is probably the easiest way in your case
