2010-01-25T01:27:00.000Z	dean		hi, I have a problem with dual monitor. The logon screen doesn't show on the screen that I wanted. Can anyone help me?
2010-01-25T01:28:00.000Z	dean		I have Nvidia graphics card
2010-01-25T01:30:00.000Z	dean		no, the primary display is on the correct one
2010-01-25T01:30:00.000Z	dean		everything is fine after logon
2010-01-25T01:31:00.000Z	dean		only on the login screen it's switched
2010-01-25T01:31:00.000Z	dean		i didn't have this problem with 9.04
2010-01-25T01:33:00.000Z	dean		Option         "metamodes" "DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select +0+0, DFP-1: nvidia-auto-select +1440+0"
2010-01-25T01:33:00.000Z	dean		what does it mean?
2010-01-25T01:34:00.000Z	dean		can i use this line to make DFP-0 be primary?
2010-01-25T01:34:00.000Z	dean		or it already is?
2010-01-25T01:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	that's the available resolutions for two different monitors, and the location for 2nd screen
2010-01-25T01:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	aren't you using nvidia?  the gui has a checkbox for primary monitor
2010-01-25T01:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	this is kinda old but seems to apply https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-180/+bug/396894
2011-06-30T21:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	have you partitioned you system or are you using one big partition?  How much space do you have "df -h"?
2011-06-30T21:56:00.000Z	dean	ZykoticK9	No I have about 43gb spare
2011-06-30T21:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	and only one partition?
2011-06-30T21:56:00.000Z	dean	ZykoticK9	Yeah
2011-06-30T21:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	sorry - i have no idea then.
2011-06-30T21:57:00.000Z	dean	ZykoticK9	Could it be a codec issue?
2011-06-30T21:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	?  i doubt it, but don't know for sure.
2011-06-30T21:57:00.000Z	dean	ZykoticK9	Could it be where it is being saved to?
2011-06-30T21:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dean	possibly?
2011-06-30T21:58:00.000Z	dean	ZykoticK9	Not sure what I am doing wrong then
