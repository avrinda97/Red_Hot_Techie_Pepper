2007-01-12T15:01:00.000Z	JoshJ		              also intelligently handles changing dependencies with  new  ver
2007-01-12T15:01:00.000Z	JoshJ		              sions  of  packages;
2007-01-12T15:01:00.000Z	JoshJ		dist-upgrade isn't JUST for going dapper -> edgy :P
2007-01-12T15:01:00.000Z	JoshJ		you do dist-upgrade also when foo (depends on bar) also now depends on baz
2007-01-12T15:03:00.000Z	JoshJ		because (A) i don't use nvidia
2007-01-12T15:03:00.000Z	JoshJ		and (B) i've never had dist-upgrade ask me that
2007-01-12T15:03:00.000Z	JoshJ		i recommend seeing what depends on nvidia-glx
2007-01-12T15:04:00.000Z	JoshJ		try apt-cache madison nvidia-glx and see what it says
2007-01-12T15:04:00.000Z	JoshJ		if you get a ton of stuff showing up you definitely do not want to let it do that
2007-01-12T15:05:00.000Z	JoshJ		kane: i'm betting the same reason synaptic will want you to fix it
2007-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	kane77	JoshJ	but apt-get is fine...
2007-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	JoshJ	kane77	: i'm not sure apt-get searches for broken dependencies
2007-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	JoshJ		i don't know though, but that seems a logical explanation
2007-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	kane77	JoshJ	well it can fix it ( -f parameter)
2007-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	JoshJ		hm
2007-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	JoshJ		yeah good point
2007-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	JoshJ		probably isn't that
2007-01-12T15:07:00.000Z	JoshJ		i'll agree with stefg on this one
2007-01-12T15:07:00.000Z	kane77	JoshJ	synaptic is fine...
2007-01-12T15:07:00.000Z	JoshJ	kane77	dunno then, i suggest just not using aptitude then
2007-01-12T15:08:00.000Z	kane77	JoshJ	but I particularly like its auto removing of unused dependencies...
2007-01-12T15:08:00.000Z	JoshJ		writing works, but you probably want to back up before doing it
2007-01-12T15:08:00.000Z	JoshJ	kane77	: apt-get autoremove does that
