2008-10-28T16:01:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	what kind of computer have you got?
2008-10-28T16:01:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: hp pavilion dv6000
2008-10-28T16:05:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	to get to BIOS you need to press F10 as the HP logo displays
2008-10-28T16:05:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: and from bios?
2008-10-28T16:06:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	when you are there see if you can change the boot priority, I don't have the details yet... still googling
2008-10-28T16:06:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: i'm sorry i know that's horribly green of me, i just messed with it for a couple hours though and got absolutely stumped. shouldn't i be able to shrink my vista partition through gparted in ubuntu without booting from cd? it just shows one big mounted partition
2008-10-28T16:08:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	you dont need to apologise for being new at this, we all were there once :)
2008-10-28T16:09:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	could you please re state your problem for me?
2008-10-28T16:09:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: i have gparted installed in ubuntu but when i open it it shows one big partition labeled '/host' and of course i can't mess with it because it's mounted. i'm not even sure my OS's are on different partitions now...
2008-10-28T16:10:00.000Z	economyx	r0nda	yes yes yes
2008-10-28T16:10:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	just a minute I am doing some reading on gparted
2008-10-28T16:13:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	hgow did you manage to install gparted on to the hard drive?
2008-10-28T16:13:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: synaptic manager
2008-10-28T16:14:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	Oh I see, you have Ubuntu installed and you used synaptic to install gparted on to Ubuntu
2008-10-28T16:15:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: yes. i installed ubuntu through vista to dual-boot. i assigned it 25GB partition space, and installed gparted later. now i can't see the separate partitions, it all shows up as /dev/sda1 and it's labeled '/boot /host' and i can't mess with it because it's mounted
2008-10-28T16:16:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	can you see the size of this partition?
2008-10-28T16:16:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: yes, i'm using 65.11 GB of 140 max. but it's all on one partition
2008-10-28T16:17:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	have you lost vista?
2008-10-28T16:17:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: nope. i can boot either perfectly
2008-10-28T16:18:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	right, ok now sounds like you are seeing the Ubuntu partitions /boot and the root directory /
2008-10-28T16:19:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	and not the vista partition
2008-10-28T16:20:00.000Z	economyx		mechdave: sorry, i'm not sure what you mean. i can only see /dev/sda1 and it's ntfs, i'm thinking somehow they're both there. because i can't be using 65GB of space on my ubuntu partition
2008-10-28T16:24:00.000Z	Mechdave	economyx	ok now I have installed gparted too...  top right hand side make sure the drop down list has /dev/sda visible
