2009-01-03T15:33:00.000Z	Tony22		umm, so network manager won't keep static IPs. someone said Wicd is a good alternative. I added them as a source repository for intrepid, and nothing...
2009-01-03T15:33:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	personally i prefer network manager to wicd
2009-01-03T15:36:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	if you have wicd installed you should probably uninstall network manager s they dont conflict, and you can launch wicd from the commandline by: wicd (from memory)
2009-01-03T15:38:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	if you have any alternatives to fixing the problem I'd be more than happy to listen. basically network manager won't keep manual IP settings after a reboot.
2009-01-03T15:43:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	do you set the static ip as root or super user?
2009-01-03T15:46:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	i've been doing it from the network manager gui, so super user
2009-01-03T15:47:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	have you been asked for a password?
2009-01-03T15:50:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	try running: sudo nm-connection-editor and setting it up like that and see if that helps...
2009-01-03T15:50:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	when doing other things in the desktop, yes. but I don't click remember for this session (unless I did by mistake. I don't remember doing it.) if you'd like I can do things via command line with a little instruction.
2009-01-03T15:51:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	just launch the editor from the command line using sudo as i described above
2009-01-03T15:52:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	(again) try running: sudo nm-connection-editor and setting it up like that and see if that helps...
2009-01-03T15:52:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	in addition to getting the network configuration window to open, i also got an error in the terminal: http://paste.ubuntu.com/98917
2009-01-03T15:53:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	(thanks for your help btw)
2009-01-03T15:54:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	that doesn't look bad - it just looks like you haven't install the vpn modules and its trying to load them and failing, but that shouldn't be a problem
2009-01-03T15:56:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	okay. when I go into network connection editor, then select auto eth0, and then go to IPv4 Settings, it shows all the stuff I manually entered. but I'm pretty sure that when I reboot, it'll be gone (it's done it 3 or 4 times before, and it's never kept those settings after a reboot.)
2009-01-03T15:57:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	let me see if i can find the configurations files and then we can see if the info has been put in there...
2009-01-03T16:01:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	thanks, would it be /etc/network/interfaces by any chance?
2009-01-03T16:09:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	yes /etc/network/interfaces is the main network configuration file.  have a look at this and it should help you set it up to get your static ip address: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-networking-configuration-using-command-line.html
2009-01-03T16:09:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Tony22	I'm off to get some sleep now, but if you have any more problems feel free to pm them to me and i'll look at them in the morning :)
2009-01-03T16:10:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	looking
2009-01-03T16:18:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	well, I edited the /etc/network/interfaces file. I'm rebooting now to see if it stuck
2009-01-03T16:22:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	uh oh... now auto eth0 isn't showing up at all in network configuration
2009-01-03T16:28:00.000Z	Tony22	miranda_psi	uh oh... now auto eth0 isn't showing up at all in network configuration (again)
