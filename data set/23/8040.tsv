2005-02-14T08:27:00.000Z	aw		does this have anything to do w/ xorg not working on ppc w/ radeon? (sorry, came in a bit too late)
2005-02-14T08:28:00.000Z	daniels	aw	nope.  what's your problem there?
2005-02-14T08:28:00.000Z	aw	daniels	it uses fbdev by default at an unacceptable resolution, if I remove the option for fbdev, it won't sync the monitor and claims it can't read the option rom
2005-02-14T08:29:00.000Z	aw	daniels	xfree86 on debian and an older xorg on gentoo work fine using the radeon driver w/o fbdev
2005-02-14T08:30:00.000Z	daniels	aw	hm.  could you please file a bug with your Xorg.0.log and xorg.conf attached (from the pristine configuration)?
2005-02-14T08:30:00.000Z	daniels	aw	(i assume you're on a laptop)
2005-02-14T08:30:00.000Z	aw	daniels	mac mini
2005-02-14T08:35:00.000Z	aw	daniels	I don't have the pristine config, is there a utility I can run to remake one (X -configure doesn't work)
2005-02-14T09:00:00.000Z	daniels	aw	XORG_FORCE_PROBE=yes sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2005-02-14T09:08:00.000Z	aw	daniels	that didn't write a new xorg.conf, but I did a dpkg --purge of it and apt-get reinstalled, it's only white space difference from the xorg.conf I already uploaded to #6117
2005-02-14T09:11:00.000Z	daniels	aw	ok.  does sudo ddcprobe give you output ending in edidfail, or a whole bunch of spew about dtiming, ctiming, tec?
2005-02-14T09:11:00.000Z	daniels		s/tec/etc/
2005-02-14T09:12:00.000Z	daniels	aw	(what sort of monitor is it hooked up to?)
2005-02-14T09:12:00.000Z	aw	daniels	the latter, much spewage
2005-02-14T09:12:00.000Z	daniels		argh
2005-02-14T09:12:00.000Z	aw	daniels	lcd
2005-02-14T09:12:00.000Z	daniels		well, 6.8.1-11ubuntu13 might well solve your problem
2005-02-14T09:12:00.000Z	daniels		er, 6.8.1-1ubuntu13
2005-02-14T09:13:00.000Z	aw	daniels	happy to try, anywhere I can pull it from?
2005-02-14T09:14:00.000Z	daniels	aw	not yet, it's not finished
2005-02-14T09:15:00.000Z	aw	daniels	ok, I'll keep my fingers crossed and try to pull it tomorrow
2005-02-14T09:15:00.000Z	aw	daniels	thanks
2005-02-14T09:16:00.000Z	daniels	aw	no worries
