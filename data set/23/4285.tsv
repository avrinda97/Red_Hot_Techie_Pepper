2009-10-23T10:36:00.000Z	greg		Could someone perhaps help me with a wireless problem in Ubuntu?
2009-10-23T10:36:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	which chipset on the card
2009-10-23T10:37:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	does ifconfig see the card
2009-10-23T10:37:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	open a terminal and type ifconfig, do you see it there
2009-10-23T10:38:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	is there a wireless shutoff switch on the machine
2009-10-23T10:44:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	it is seen as wlan0 in ifconfig? do you have an AP to test it on?
2009-10-23T10:44:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	okay great; do you have a wifi hotspot to test it on
2009-10-23T10:45:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	normally sudo dhclient wlan0 if it is not encrypted, I will get you a link on how to set it manually if it is encrypted
2009-10-23T10:48:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	well, with wep you should check the link I gave you
2009-10-23T10:48:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	Your link is very interesting, but it scrolled by a long time ago.  Could you repeat please?
2009-10-23T10:49:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	Thanks!
2009-10-23T10:51:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	the instructions at your link have an <interface>.  What do I use for that?  wlan0 or eth0?
2009-10-23T10:51:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	wlan0
2009-10-23T10:51:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	thanks.
2009-10-23T10:54:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	 I copied all of the commands.  It all seemed to work, but dhcpdiscover does not work.  And the light is still orange.
2009-10-23T10:54:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	sure, with wep it will not work unless you set the password (wep) per the link
2009-10-23T10:55:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	Yes I did the key line too.
2009-10-23T10:55:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	Can't know if I did the key line correctlly.
2009-10-23T10:55:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	if you paste.ubuntu.com with them we can check
2009-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	unf. I have to first find a cable for what I am doing.
2009-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	well I am just going to have to give up for tonight.  Although you did give me some useful pointers.
2009-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	greg	bazhang	thanks anyway.
2009-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	bazhang	greg	this is 8.04 and broadcom; later version of Ubuntu (such as Jaunty have much better broadcom support)
