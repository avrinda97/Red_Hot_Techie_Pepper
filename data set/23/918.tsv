2011-01-30T08:30:00.000Z	induz		I want to copy Fonts to /usr/share/fonts folder but It says i dont have permission, i am the root of this comp??
2011-01-30T08:31:00.000Z	edbian	induz	your user is not root.  You can use sudo to do things as root
2011-01-30T21:00:00.000Z	edbian	induz	are you typing sudo apt-get install /ipodslave/    ?  with a slashes?  That tells the system ipodslave is a directory
2011-01-30T21:02:00.000Z	edbian	induz	mmm, well in any event that's not in the repos.  I suggest you use something that is.  Look in the Ubuntu software Center
