2009-07-01T17:16:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	well, the driver works well in 2.6.27-14, but DKMS or whatever comes up empty when booting 2.6.30, ...
2009-07-01T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	is 2.6.30 from the repositories?
2009-07-01T17:16:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	ppa
2009-07-01T17:16:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	2.6.28 is defective for my laptop.
2009-07-01T17:17:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	2.6.30 seems not to kill my laptop, but without graphics and wlan, it's a low fun proposition.
2009-07-01T17:19:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	beside the wiki page you directed me is slightly out of date, Intrepid and Jaunty seem to default to nvidia (OTOH, I've been fed up with the nvidia driver often enough that I more than once switched to nv).
2009-07-01T17:19:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	what do you mean "default to nvidia"?
2009-07-01T17:20:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	I don't remember to have needed to manually enable nvidia on Jaunty, ..
2009-07-01T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	it let's you do that automatically but it isn't the default
2009-07-01T17:20:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	but as I said, perhaps my memories are imperfect ;)
2009-07-01T17:20:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	well, it does not for the new kernel, ...
2009-07-01T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	i'd read about custom kernels.  I have no idea what kernel you are using
2009-07-01T17:21:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	the Ubuntu one, and I want to upgrade to the Ubuntu PPA provided one.
2009-07-01T17:21:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	as the current Jaunty kernel (2.6.28) is incapable of running much longer than 60 seconds on my laptop ;)
2009-07-01T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	I thought you said you were already using one from a ppa?  What ppa is this?
2009-07-01T17:22:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	I'm using 2.6.27-14-generic, and wlan + nvidia work.
2009-07-01T17:22:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	I'd like to install the 2.6.30 from the ppa, skipping 2.6.28 (which is bad for my hardware), but while 2.6.30 seems to be stable thermically, it is missing nvidia/wlan.
2009-07-01T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	what ppa
2009-07-01T17:23:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.30/
2009-07-01T17:24:00.000Z	yacc	jrib	no "custom" kernel at all.
2009-07-01T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	but I imagine you want to build linux-restricted-modules for that kernel...
2009-07-01T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	yacc	if I were in your shoes I would just build the kernel myself including -restricted using the information ubottu provided.  But if you wish you can just build -restricted and use that ppa for the kernel
