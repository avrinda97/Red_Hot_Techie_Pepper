2008-04-15T13:29:00.000Z	arvind_khadri		how do i run a file without having to type "./"
2008-04-15T13:29:00.000Z	arvind_khadri		Ollie you would need to re-install grub
2008-04-15T13:30:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	you mean an executable file?
2008-04-15T13:30:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	yeah
2008-04-15T13:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	to be precise a shell-script
2008-04-15T13:31:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	if you are trying to run an executable file it has to be in your path, otherwise you have to specify the path... hence the "./"
2008-04-15T13:33:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	how to edit path
2008-04-15T13:34:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	if you want to do it permanently you can do it by adding a line in your ~/.bashrc file
2008-04-15T13:34:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	lets assume put all your scripts in ~/scripts
2008-04-15T13:34:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	the file is in my home directory
2008-04-15T13:35:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	ok, then add "export PATH=$PATH:/home/USERNAME"  (sans quotes) to your .bashrc file
2008-04-15T13:36:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	do i need to add it to a particular section or just anywhere in the file
2008-04-15T13:36:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	though I recommend you make a ~/scripts folder instead... so your whole home directory won't run executables
2008-04-15T13:37:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	anywhere is fine
2008-04-15T13:37:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	having your whole home directory in your path isn't particularly secure
2008-04-15T13:38:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	it didnt work
2008-04-15T13:38:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	you have to open a new terminal    .bashrc gets read then
2008-04-15T13:39:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	yeah done
2008-04-15T13:39:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	now about making things more secure
2008-04-15T13:41:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	I agree with prince_jammys
2008-04-15T13:43:00.000Z	mjbrooks	arvind_khadri	nope
2008-04-15T13:43:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	so now no need to edit PATH or basrc???
2008-04-15T13:44:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	mjbrooks	now it isnt workin
