2007-01-16T16:10:00.000Z	stefg	zoidberg	that's serious... did you mess with your libc ?
2007-01-16T16:11:00.000Z	zoidberg	stefg	is there anyways to fix the problem
2007-01-16T16:11:00.000Z	stefg	zoidberg	check dmesg for file system panics
2007-01-16T16:11:00.000Z	zoidberg	stefg	what is dmesg?
2007-01-16T16:12:00.000Z	stefg	zoidberg	type 'dmesg | grep panic' to a terminal and see if there are any results
2007-01-16T16:13:00.000Z	zoidberg	stefg	i typed that and i get nothing it just returns me to the terminal line again
2007-01-16T16:14:00.000Z	zoidberg	stefg	ok...now what?
2007-01-16T16:15:00.000Z	stefg	zoidberg	segfaulting apt is a pita... spend 3 hours on dignosis or 20 minutes on reinstall...
2007-01-16T16:19:00.000Z	zoidberg	stefg	you're suggesting that i should reinstall reformat everything all over again?
2007-01-16T16:20:00.000Z	stefg	zoidberg	radical, maybe unnecessary.... but quicker than diagnosing a segfaulting apt
2007-01-16T16:26:00.000Z	zoidberg	stefg	can i just i replace my aptitiude file and sources list with an older viersion or something?
2007-01-16T16:27:00.000Z	stefg	zoidberg	your apt is segfaulting.... if you manage to do that, fine!. But i think you're paralyzed
