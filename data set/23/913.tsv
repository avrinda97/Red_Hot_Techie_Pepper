2011-07-25T13:12:00.000Z	woutervddn		hey guys, I'm on a laptop with an ATI card, but Xorg isn't loading, after the bootscreen it just flickers a couple of times and then stays blank..
2011-07-25T13:14:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	during boot can you access the grub menu and try safe mode
2011-07-25T13:15:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	then try
2011-07-25T13:15:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	I can access it but only with 2.6.35-28-generic
2011-07-25T13:18:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	strange though.. my mouse doesn't work in safe mode..
2011-07-25T13:21:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	it gives me perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
2011-07-25T13:22:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	yes, but it probably did a reconfigure of the X server anyways
2011-07-25T13:22:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	try to reboot
2011-07-25T13:23:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	still the same :s
2011-07-25T13:25:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	radeon or nvidia or something completely different
2011-07-25T13:26:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	I use nvidia, but it seems a lot of ppl have had problems with fglrx and radeon lately
2011-07-25T13:27:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	not only with radeon.. nvidia as well.. it's something in the kernel..
2011-07-25T13:29:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	how can you retain the old kernel versions if you have done a reinstall ?
2011-07-25T13:30:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	in any case you should use the kernel version tested with your current distro release - if not all kinds of things might stop working
2011-07-25T13:30:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	yes.. but it has to work then :p
2011-07-25T13:31:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	ok its an upgrade you ran :-)
2011-07-25T13:32:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	no.. euhm.. I had 10.10 but updated in april to 11.04. yesterday my theme went haywire and nautilus kept crashing, after reboot I still had the ugly theme in the login window but I couldn't log in..
2011-07-25T13:33:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	from 11.04 to 11.04 is that even possible?
2011-07-25T13:34:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	try to update all your packages then
2011-07-25T13:34:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	yeah, I didn't know it either, but it listed it :p
2011-07-25T13:35:00.000Z	woutervddn	Barnabas	tried the update.. will  try full-upgrade
2011-07-25T13:35:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	note that was using aptitude
2011-07-25T13:37:00.000Z	Barnabas	woutervddn	I am pretty sure the oss version works, the closed source - that is another matter
