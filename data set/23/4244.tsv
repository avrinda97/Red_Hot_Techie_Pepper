2012-09-15T18:04:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	you don't use it ;-)
2012-09-16T17:19:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	how did you install it?
2012-09-16T17:19:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	okay - but how?  ./configure/make/make install? some setup script? etc.
2012-09-16T17:20:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	then there's not a way anyone can advise you without more details
2012-09-16T17:21:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	so you downloaded a deb and did 'sudo dpkg -i <package'?
2012-09-16T17:22:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	in that case, 'sudo dpkg -r <package>'
2012-09-16T17:23:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	and - general unsolicited advice - you probably need to read up on software installation on ubuntu
2012-09-16T17:23:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	I would try the short name
2012-09-16T17:36:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	in a terminal do 'dpkg -l | grep <packagename>'
2012-09-16T17:37:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	so what do you mean by 'its no where to bee seen'?
2012-09-16T17:38:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	what is the name of the program? (more details are better)
2012-09-16T17:39:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	is it supposed to have a GUI?
2012-09-16T17:39:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	development frameworks typically don't as far as I know
2012-09-16T17:40:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	okay - then I wouldn't expect it to be available via Unity/the GUI
2012-09-16T17:41:00.000Z	yeats	iwert	I'm sorry - I don't understand
