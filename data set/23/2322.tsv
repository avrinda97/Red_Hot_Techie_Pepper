2009-07-10T19:35:00.000Z	jrib	indus	bring down gdm.  Then login as your user in a tty and type "startx"
2009-07-17T16:03:00.000Z	jrib	indus	because one prefers ubuntu to OS X?  It's all personal preference.  I do the same

2009-09-22T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	indus	because libflashplayer.so is not 64bit?

2009-11-13T16:24:00.000Z	indus	jrib	yeah ,but i do wonder why people feel more comfortable speaking with their countrymen for tech stuff also

2010-05-07T16:10:00.000Z	indus	jrib	lot of the new branding stuff is done with photoshop
