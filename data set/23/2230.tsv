2010-02-18T06:46:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	hm.. going to look that up in the wiki
2010-02-18T06:50:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	well, its not in the wiki, what is it?
2010-02-18T06:51:00.000Z	klappi	wolter	basicly you can press e in grup and add profile to your kernel line and reboot again
2010-02-18T06:53:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	hm, it doesn't need to be in the grub conf, i just need to do it once?
2010-02-18T06:54:00.000Z	klappi	wolter	yes only once
2010-02-18T06:54:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	ok nice, brb

2010-02-18T06:59:00.000Z	klappi	wolter	it bootet slower but it should boot faster next time
2010-02-18T06:59:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	oh you didn't appear in the autocomplete options... god knows why. hey, i wrote it but it still boots slow
2010-02-18T06:59:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	oh ok. Just in case, was it in the linux (...) line or in the initrd (...) line ?
2010-02-18T07:00:00.000Z	klappi	wolter	linux line
2010-02-18T07:00:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	and what does profile do to make my booting faster?
2010-02-18T07:00:00.000Z	klappi	wolter	updates ureadahead
2010-02-18T07:01:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	ok, ill boot now to see how speed goes
2010-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	no success
2010-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	still boots at same speed, and my hardware could totally boot faster i think
2010-02-18T07:04:00.000Z	klappi	wolter	bad for you google around it worked for me
2010-02-18T07:07:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	will i notice if the system reprofiles or not? maybe im reading i should see 'preparing to profile boot sequence'
2010-02-18T10:47:00.000Z	wolter	klappi	hey, good to be able to contact you again. I really need help with this preloading thing. Should I ask you here or go to the classroom
