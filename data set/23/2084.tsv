2009-07-09T14:07:00.000Z	richardcavell		Hey I'm using Chatzilla. Is there a short way to reply to people by including their name and a colon, or do I just type it?
2009-07-09T14:08:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	can you tab-autocomplete?
2009-07-09T14:10:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	can you tab to autocomplete in chatzilla?
2009-07-09T14:11:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	yes, I can tab - complete
2009-07-09T14:12:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	and what do you mean they haven't improved? .. used to not be able to send files!
2009-07-09T15:05:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	tried smuxi yet?
2009-07-09T15:05:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	 no
2009-07-09T15:06:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	truthfully, i just picked up IRC today... so i'm new to all this, but i found smuxi to have a very developed UI.. sadly, it lacked some of the features i'm after. Now i'm using weechat
2009-07-09T15:06:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	I'm downloading xchat, so we'll see how we go
2009-07-09T15:08:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	xchat's pretty good at letting you distinguish messages from other activity.. but that's about all it's good for... smuxi lacks that, but everything else about it is good
2009-07-09T15:24:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	the messages with your nick are considered "highlighted text" .. there's probably a setting somewhere in the preferences that lets you bold it or something
2009-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	I can only change the color
2009-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	but I can get it to beep
2009-07-09T15:28:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	pm me just to test it
2009-07-09T15:28:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	you can give weechat a shot.. it runs in the terminal though, so it takes a little getting used to, but here, you can press ALT+P or ALT+N to scroll through messages to your nick
2009-07-09T15:44:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	there's a little checkbox in the preferences "strip colors" i assume that does what you want
2009-07-17T10:25:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	no, they cannot do so
2009-07-17T10:25:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	that is to say, OS X does not and cannot do so. Ubuntu can if it's installed on a mac
2009-07-17T10:45:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	okay, noted, thanks
2009-07-31T13:33:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	you beat me to it
2009-07-31T13:33:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	haven't lost it ;D
2009-07-31T13:33:00.000Z	moymoy	richardcavell	haven't been on here in a while
2009-07-31T13:34:00.000Z	richardcavell	moymoy	because I'm on GRUB 2 now I had to think for a second before remembering the path
