2009-11-13T22:51:00.000Z	navatwo		lspci is not identifying my network card, anyone have an idea how I can find it?
2009-11-13T22:52:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	is it PCI? or USB?  lsusb
2009-11-13T22:52:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	its pci
2009-11-13T22:53:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	lsmod?
2009-11-13T22:53:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	what am I looking for in this?
2009-11-13T22:55:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	there does not appear to be anything there relative to the network card.
2009-11-13T22:55:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	lsmod gives less descriptive names.  You can use process of elimination to find your card.  Yes if a module were loaded, the card would be present.
2009-11-13T22:56:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	what interfaces shown in 'ip addr'?
2009-11-13T22:57:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	there isnt one
2009-11-13T22:57:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	does it not at least show 'lo'?
2009-11-13T22:58:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	'lo' is the loopback network interface.  it should always be present & seen as a result of 'ip link'
2009-11-13T22:58:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	there are ip_table* shown
2009-11-13T23:00:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	not in lsmod.  run the program 'ip' with parameter 'link'
2009-11-13T23:00:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	what am I lookig for?
2009-11-13T23:01:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	are you chatting from your  Ubuntu box that has the trouble?
2009-11-13T23:01:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	wmaster0, wlan0, pan0
2009-11-13T23:01:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	no, I don't have wireless here
2009-11-13T23:03:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	it shows your wireless card.
2009-11-13T23:06:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	the driver I need is only on one website, which happens to be down
2009-11-13T23:12:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	do you know what brand the ethernet is?
2009-11-13T23:12:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	was the ethernet working under a previous linux?
2009-11-13T23:12:00.000Z	juhm	navatwo	in the worst case, you install the old linux where it was working; extract the information about the card; use information in KK to set it up
2009-11-13T23:14:00.000Z	navatwo	juhm	it was found under 9.04, and it was found under my old installation of 9.10. The card is Atheros AR1831, but the driver site is down..
