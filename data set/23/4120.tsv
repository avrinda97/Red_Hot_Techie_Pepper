2008-09-13T20:38:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	I wasn't here 3 hours ago. If you can't be bothered to provide information, don't ask for help.
2008-09-13T20:39:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	, I am trying to reget it for you
2008-09-13T20:41:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	here it is 00:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C51 [GeForce 6150 LE] (rev a2)
2008-09-13T20:41:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	how did you install the drivers?
2008-09-13T20:41:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	EnvyNG
2008-09-13T20:43:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	what is your present system state?
2008-09-13T20:43:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	healthy?
2008-09-13T20:44:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	my system is currently near sighted
2008-09-13T20:45:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	please clearify what you mean?
2008-09-13T20:45:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	look, I'm trying to help you here. Can you try and provide an intelligible problem description?
2008-09-13T20:46:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	every time I update Linux & Linux headers my system loses it's resolution & it ability to have higher resolutions.
2008-09-13T20:47:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	that's a known problem with envyng. Just go through the graphics setup again when you've updated the kernel.
2008-09-13T20:48:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	I have done that 8 times this morning, it did not help.
2008-09-13T20:51:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	no
2008-09-13T20:51:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	then what is it?
2008-09-13T20:53:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	the standard way to configure resolutions in Ubuntu is 'gksudo displayconfig-gtk'. I don't know if this will work under an NVidia driver installed by envyng, but it's the first thing I would try.
2008-09-13T20:54:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	that will not work in my case as it doesn't give me any options other then 800x600 which is not correct.
2008-09-13T20:54:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	if it doesn't, there is an nvidia-specific xorg.conf tool, but I don't know what it's called -- nvidia-???
2008-09-13T20:54:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	maybe enter nvidia- and hit Tab twice to see the possible completions
2008-09-13T20:55:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	 , I do know what the tool is called but it is malfuntioning on my system.
2008-09-13T20:55:00.000Z	soundray	holyguyver	okay, back to displayconfig-gtk. Does it let you choose a display?
2008-09-13T20:56:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	no it does nnot let me choose anything
2008-09-13T20:56:00.000Z	holyguyver	soundray	I must restart x now though
