2012-06-29T18:12:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		+2 (yes TWO) internets if someone can PLEASE tell me HOW DO I CHANGE AN ICON ON THE DASH BAR (Unity)?
2012-06-29T18:13:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		It's for Eclipse
2012-06-29T18:14:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		well that would be fine, vibhav, if that's what it takes...right now on unity it shows a generic icon with a questionmark
2012-06-29T18:14:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		eclipse has no installer, you just run the exe
2012-06-29T18:15:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		I don't mean exe as in windows exe, it's an executible
2012-06-29T18:15:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		and Dr_willis is right it is a java program
2012-06-29T18:15:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		i put it in /usr/opt/eclipse
2012-06-29T18:16:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		so I downloaded from the site
2012-06-29T18:17:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs		I have it working 100% just the icon is bugging my OCD :P
2012-06-29T18:17:00.000Z	AlanBell	GeeksOnHugs	yeah, the repo version of eclipse is fine if you just want what it does, but if you need to add plugins then the upstream version tends to work better
2012-06-29T18:17:00.000Z	AlanBell	GeeksOnHugs	as it is a java application BAMF doesn't get it entirely right and messes up the unity icons for it, I think I saw something a few weeks ago about this being improved
2012-06-29T18:18:00.000Z	GeeksOnHugs	AlanBell	once I fixed a swt library issue it was fine...it's a bit old but I didn't mind that, the main thing was I couldn't get my plugin working, yep
