2010-12-21T01:48:00.000Z	tehbaut2		the latest install cd has no option "Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer" ...what boot options should I use to get the same effect?
2010-12-21T01:49:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	? the "Try Ubuntu" thing is just a livecd
2010-12-21T01:49:00.000Z	tehbaut2	bencahill	so they aren't all rolled into one disc any more?
2010-12-21T01:50:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	what aren't rolled into one disc?
2010-12-21T02:02:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	sry, was reading something :)
2010-12-21T02:03:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	that's what I said, the "Try Ubuntu" is the livecd "option", if you will
2010-12-21T02:04:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	NO! before that, when it first comes up, click "Try Ubuntu without installing"
2010-12-21T02:04:00.000Z	tehbaut2	bencahill	but I see no such option, that's what I'm saying
2010-12-21T02:04:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	what other options?
2010-12-21T02:05:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	what is the second?
2010-12-21T02:09:00.000Z	tehbaut2	bencahill	the second option is "check disk for defects" ...which is useless compared to the try option
2010-12-21T02:09:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	ok, I'm going to boot a disc up not, just a min...
2010-12-21T02:10:00.000Z	tehbaut2	bencahill	this disk is the latest ISO downloaded VIA torrent this morning
2010-12-21T02:20:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	you have the alternate cd
2010-12-21T02:22:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	it's designed for computers that can't support the full installer and for cli installs, and therefore toned down
2010-12-21T02:22:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	if you want a GUI, download the regular cd, not alternate
2010-12-21T02:23:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	same install, just without the gui
2010-12-21T02:24:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	was this the download? http://releases.ubuntu.com/maverick/ubuntu-10.10-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
2010-12-21T02:26:00.000Z	tehbaut2	bencahill	I don't remember actually I just clicked on whatever the first link was on the site
2010-12-21T02:26:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	well, it's the first set on this page - http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download
2010-12-21T02:28:00.000Z	tehbaut2	bencahill	I thats sms is interpreted alternate download as torrent download
2010-12-21T02:28:00.000Z	tehbaut2	bencahill	* ah that's it, I must have interpreted alternate download ass torrent download
2010-12-21T02:28:00.000Z	bencahill	tehbaut2	right, that's what I was thinking also :)
