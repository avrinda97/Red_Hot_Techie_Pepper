2005-11-09T07:57:00.000Z	chuck87		i have a problem with skype
2005-11-09T07:58:00.000Z	chuck87		it appears when i wanna talk : /dev/dsp-1: Device or resource busy
2005-11-09T07:58:00.000Z	chuck87		somebody know what is?
2005-11-09T07:58:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	use alsa, it looks as though you may be using oss instead...
2005-11-09T07:59:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	how can i install alsa?
2005-11-09T08:00:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	search for alsa in the synaptic pac man, install alsa-base, alsa-oss, alsa-utils
2005-11-09T08:01:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	oks!
2005-11-09T08:02:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	i install it both
2005-11-09T08:02:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	let me prove
2005-11-09T08:03:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	no need to - did you have the alsa-oss installed?
2005-11-09T08:04:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	yes i already install it
2005-11-09T08:05:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	well basically what is going on is that another program (prolly the window manager) is already using the /dev/dsp which I think is oss, alsa handles multiple apps using the sounds card while oss doesnt... Thats where I was heading whith all of that... is there a way to see if skype is using oss or alsa, and if so change it?
2005-11-09T08:07:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	no, theres no option to change it, but on my sound setting i have "Autodetect", do i need to change it?
2005-11-09T08:08:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	if you can change it, and it can handle alsa natively yeah... you may just try changing autodetect to alsa and see if it works =)
2005-11-09T08:09:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	it has a option that says: " Full duplex" on sound settings do i need to enable?
2005-11-09T08:10:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	I'm pretty sure alsa is full duplex whether or not the card is (could be wrong), I would go ahead and set it to see what happens...
2005-11-09T08:10:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	thanx! :D
2005-11-09T08:18:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	do you already check it? :$
2005-11-09T08:20:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	do you already check it? :$
2005-11-09T08:21:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	sry, check the sound card?
2005-11-09T08:22:00.000Z	chuck87	penguinbrat	i don't understand! jaja, what in need to do?
2005-11-09T08:23:00.000Z	penguinbrat	chuck87	ive' nvr used skype before, but the easiest way since it seems to be using the oss method, is to diable any apps that are using the sound system, that should free it up... apps like esd or arts - the sound deamons for gnome and kde respectively...
