2005-12-16T14:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	there's lots of CD burning options in Ubuntu - what do you want to burn?
2006-02-22T10:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	ask at a modding forum for that sort of thing - try http://forums.bit-tech.net/
2006-03-12T12:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	ewww
2006-03-12T12:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	to get kde, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2006-05-21T08:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	the art manager is called "gnome-art" - install the package thru Synaptic
2006-05-21T08:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	applications->add applications, search for gnome-art
2006-05-21T08:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	sorry, search for art manager
2006-05-21T08:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	after you install it, look in System->Preferences->Art Manager to start it
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	apparently older versions of PS (PS 7, I think) run in Wine... but have a go with the gimp, it's better than you might htink
2006-05-27T16:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	instead of dw, try Nvu - it's in Ubuntu's repositories.
2006-05-27T16:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	Applications->Add Applications, just search for nvu
2006-05-27T16:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	by 'mozilla', do you mean the browser (Firefox is already installed) or what?
2006-05-27T16:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	Macromedia hasn't bothered with Flash 8 for linux yet... we're still stuck w/ 7
2006-05-27T16:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	wine is in repos - switch to Synaptic and get it from there
2006-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	System->Prefs->Theme
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	ext3 is the default
2006-05-27T16:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubuntu_	if you do a Breezy install, you'll be able to update/upgrade that to Dapper when you want to
