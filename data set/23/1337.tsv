2010-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	Azh		does anyone know the command to connect to a wireless network?
2010-05-11T10:05:00.000Z	Azh		can someone give the command to connect or reconnect to a wireless network
2010-05-11T10:05:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	It depends.  man iwconfig will connect you to an access point, and you can give it your key if it's WEP.  If you use WPA, you need wpa_supplicant.  To handle dhcp, you need dhclient.
2010-06-04T03:48:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	How long did you wait?  And what are the specs for your computer?
2010-06-04T03:35:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	What is the problem?
2010-06-04T03:35:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	Last I saw, someone asked you to verify the md5 hash.  Did you?
2010-06-04T03:37:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	That sounds bad.  Can you pastebin the command you typed and the output you got?
2010-06-04T03:37:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	I just put md5sum /dev/cdrom and then got md5sum: /dev/cdrom" Imput/output error
2010-06-04T03:39:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	Ah.  You have to do md5sum on the file you downloaded.  You have to go to the computer you used to download the ISO file (that you used to burn the CD), and then do the md5sum there.  It should be something like: "md5sum xubuntu.iso".
2010-06-04T03:40:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	I did it and this is what I got: xubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso) = 7f064bc012025a5307ef6d81b0bc4c87
2010-06-04T03:42:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	also i burned the iso at about 6x speed, could that be the problem?
2010-06-04T03:42:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	Compare that to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
2010-06-04T03:43:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	I found it in that page but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do
2010-06-04T03:44:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	If the 7f064bc... (called the md5 hash or md5 sum) matches, then it means the file you downloaded is correct (doesn't have any errors).
2010-06-04T03:44:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	It's a way to make sure that the problems you're having aren't because your downloaded ISO has errors.
2010-06-04T03:45:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	okay so the iso looks good, could the problem be that I burned at 6x speed?
2010-06-04T03:46:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	last time i had no problem installing from xubuntu 9.4 and I burned that at 10x speed
2010-06-04T03:46:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	I don't think so.  I would guess that it's hardware issues that are causing your install to hang.  But I really don't know.
2010-06-04T03:46:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	Sorry I can't help.
2010-06-04T03:47:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	so you think my hardware just cant handle 10.4 and one more question, could the installation just be taking a long time to start, does that ever happened?
2010-06-04T03:49:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	I waited about 5 to 8 minutes, and my specs are Pentium 4 1.6  and 256 Ram
2010-06-04T03:52:00.000Z	Appl6	Azh	It shouldn't take that long.  What I meant by hardware issues was a bug in detecting your hardware, or a bug in a driver being used.  Not that your computer is too slow to run Xubuntu.
2010-06-04T03:53:00.000Z	Azh	Appl6	well thanks for your help, i guess I'm stuck with 9.04 :(
