2009-12-14T22:28:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		?
2009-12-14T22:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	are you trying to share files between windows and linux?
2009-12-14T22:30:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	yes, I can see all pcs on network and their files but they cant see my ubuntu machine
2009-12-14T22:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	have you tried setting up an NFS server on ubuntu?
2009-12-20T00:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	drivers under wine? what?
2009-12-20T00:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	i think you are a bit confused
2009-12-20T00:47:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	why are you trying to install windows drivers in ubuntu under wine?
2009-12-20T00:48:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	I probally am very confused. Can I not use wine to install drivers for my tv card using wine?
2009-12-20T00:49:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	if your tv tuner card only has windows drivers, it isn't going to work in ubuntu
2009-12-20T00:49:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	ignoring the wine thing why do I get a message saying no "host usb 2.0 port on this computer"
2009-12-20T00:49:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	trying to install the drivers in wine is totally wrong though
2009-12-20T00:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	google the name of your tv tuner + "ubuntu" to see if it is supported
2009-12-20T01:32:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+supported+tv+tuners (that took me about three seconds to do)
2009-12-20T01:33:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	good for you m8. . .good for you.
2009-12-20T01:35:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	before you get idiotic and moronic you might want to realise you didn't even supply me with a link, you just typed my question in to google. which produced nothing helpfull and waisted more time. so unless you are going to be helpful please do not pose to me.
2009-12-20T01:35:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	if the device is not supported under linux, no amount of crying and rudeness in here is going to make it work.
2009-12-20T01:36:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	the links on google provide a list of supported devices
2009-12-20T01:37:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	shhhh now.
2010-01-10T23:54:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	?
2010-02-17T23:33:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	yes
2010-02-17T23:33:00.000Z	blakkheim	LewisDre4m	it is just ubuntu with xfce instead of gnome
2010-02-17T23:33:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	blakkheim	thanks man
