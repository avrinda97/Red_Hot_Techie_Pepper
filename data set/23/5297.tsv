2007-01-01T17:33:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		Do "man mount" in a terminal to know... :-)
2007-01-01T17:34:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	 please explain this to me "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows/ -t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000", i want a explanation for "-t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000" ONLY, and the man page is too cryptic :)
2007-01-01T17:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	 jame1: will this work? "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows vfat"?
2007-01-01T17:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1:  So "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows -t vfat"
2007-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1 cybercod could you please help me with the above question?
2007-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	any special reason for your inclination towards KDE?
2007-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	i used KDE and found it to be too cluttered, and favouring the ZEN mentality i shifted to GNOME
2007-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	yes, I just like KDE better, but that's only a matter of taste, isn't it...
2007-01-01T17:48:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	and there is some reason for everyone's taste, so my question is what in KDE suits your taste?:)
2007-01-01T17:59:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	there doesn't seem to be any package availeble that's providing disks-admin in ubuntu ?
2007-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	yes
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	the command seems to be gone, it was there before edgy...
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	doesn't work in 6.10
2007-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	like I said, it used to work in Dapper !
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	I've found it: install with "sudo apt-get install pysdm"
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	thank you for informing, help is much appreciated can you tell me how did you find it out
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	I searched the ubuntu forums on http://www.ubuntuforums.org
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	:)
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	now that the package is installed what command do i enter at the CLI to get that disks thing?
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	let me do that
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	worked like a charm! Thank you, and one more thing this "psydm" thingy is not the same as "System>admin>Disks" But it shall work well too
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	sorry for the misinformation its the same thing :)
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	"Cheers" ! :-)
