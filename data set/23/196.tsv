2012-10-08T00:41:00.000Z	yekoms		you did it backwards, thats why its like this
2012-10-08T00:42:00.000Z	yekoms		windows first, linux second, windows wipes out EVERY boot manager.
2012-10-08T00:42:00.000Z	yekoms		so, you might need to issue grub-install first, then update-grub
2012-10-08T00:42:00.000Z	yekoms		thats what we are doing at this point Simplew
2012-10-08T00:43:00.000Z	yekoms		dont put a drive to it

2012-10-08T00:43:00.000Z	yekoms		excuse me: grub-install
