2006-12-26T06:44:00.000Z	xbrc		if they wanted people to use this crap they should have made it like windows... :( im soo frustrated
2006-12-26T06:46:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	windows is (finally) moving in the same direction in regards to privilege separation
2006-12-26T06:49:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	you just want to mount your ntfs drive right? and your ntfs drive is on sda5?
2006-12-26T06:55:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	did that work?
2006-12-26T06:57:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	yea this will only let you copy the files from the drive to another drive, not much else
2006-12-26T06:57:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	i havnt really messed around with the 3g drivers so cant help much there
2006-12-26T06:58:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	yeah i followed these instructions to create a drive to access the main drive and it is not working :(
2006-12-26T06:59:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	did you edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file to add in the new repos?
2006-12-26T07:00:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	yeah i went through the whole thing here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ntfs-3g
2006-12-26T07:01:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	the only part I couldn't figure out was that it said to change the drive from whatever to this /dev/<your partition> /media/<mount point> ntfs-3g defaults,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0 but my drive wasnt listed on there.. so I added the line with the new mounting point.
2006-12-26T07:02:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	can you open up fstab and paste the entry here?
2006-12-26T07:04:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	yeah
2006-12-26T07:05:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	so you rebooted, and when you type ls /media/win32 it doenst list anything?
2006-12-26T07:08:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	restarting i guess to see if that helped?
2006-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	did you try the command?
2006-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	sudo mount /dev/sda5 /media/win32/ -t ntfs-3g
2006-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	yeah.. was it suppose to do something?
2006-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	 yea heh, what output did you get?
2006-12-26T07:09:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	nothing.. when i typed in terminal it didn't say anything
2006-12-26T07:10:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	just went to next line like I could type something else
2006-12-26T07:10:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	ok, now try sudo ls /media/win32
2006-12-26T07:12:00.000Z	vladi	xbrc	im out of ideas heh. try posting on the ubuntu forums maybe
2006-12-26T07:12:00.000Z	xbrc	vladi	thanks for trying :)
