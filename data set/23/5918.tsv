2006-11-02T15:24:00.000Z	noxxle		my ubuntu takes about 55s to reach my desktop after power on, is that normal? seems a bit slow
2006-11-02T15:25:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	to reach your desktop, or to reach the display manager (GUI login manager) ?
2006-11-02T15:26:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	to reach my desktop, after i log in.
2006-11-02T15:26:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	from display manager to KDE/Gnome ?
2006-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	KDE can be a bit slow to log in, Gnome is faster, and anything else is lightning quick
2006-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	50 seconds for Gnome seems abnormally slow to me
2006-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	its 55s from power on until gnome is completely loaded
2006-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	what could be slowing me down??
2006-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	well how long until the DM comes up ?
2006-11-02T15:28:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	also, how much RAM do you have and what type of CPU ?
2006-11-02T15:28:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	dualcore pentium M 1.8. 1gig rame
2006-11-02T15:30:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	dualcore pentium M 1.8. 1gig rame
2006-11-02T15:32:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	dualcore pentium M 1.8. 1gig rame
2006-11-02T15:34:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	dualcore pentium M 1.8. 1gig rame
2006-11-02T15:35:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	any idea?
2006-11-02T15:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	well, 50 seconds to the desktop from power on with a full BIOS RAM check and so on is about normal, but if it is taking more than 10 seconds from the time you press Enter on your password until you're able to use the Gnome desktop, that is not right
2006-11-02T15:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	just type in "runlevel" and it will tell you which you're in, as well as the one you were previously in, if you switched
2006-11-02T15:42:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	that looks like a problem with your "TERM" setting
2006-11-02T15:43:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	what do you mean? what could the problem be
2006-11-02T15:43:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	you pasted a bunch of gibberish, I figured you meant that is what showed up on your screen
2006-11-02T15:43:00.000Z	noxxle	Samus_Aran	now N 2 showed up, what does that mean?
2006-11-02T15:44:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	your default runlevel is in the top of /etc/inittab
2006-11-02T15:45:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	noxxle	that was for you, forgot to use your nickname
