2008-06-07T19:57:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	can you print test page from System>Admin>Printing?
2008-06-07T19:58:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 yes
2008-06-07T19:58:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 only the "gnome" applications are affected.
2008-06-07T20:03:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	if you open a pdf file and open File>Print setup    is your printer  chosen as default?  and does File>print preview work in gedit?
2008-06-07T20:04:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 when I do as you say in evince "print to a file" is defaulted.  Print Preview does work though.
2008-06-07T20:04:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	in evince choose your printer not prin to file
2008-06-07T20:05:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 i do, of course.  The "Print" button becomes greyed out.
2008-06-07T20:06:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	in evince is print setup also grayed out?
2008-06-07T20:06:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 no.
2008-06-07T20:08:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	so if you choose your printer in Print Setup and hit Apply  Print is still grayed out?
2008-06-07T20:08:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 correct.  and it still defaults to print to a file.
2008-06-07T20:16:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	i may have an idea whats wrong. can you paste your /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname file in pastebin?
2008-06-07T20:37:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 sorry!  I was away for a minute.  http://pastebin.com/m41f1b97a
2008-06-07T20:38:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	ok 1 second
2008-06-07T20:40:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	can i PM? is your nick registered?
2008-06-07T20:40:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 yes
2008-06-10T03:38:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 does the Trash applet know that the location has changed?  Because mine is showing up as full.
2008-06-10T03:38:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	can't empty it?
2008-06-10T03:39:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 correct, can not.  i used the terminal and cleared out the folder.  no change.
2008-06-10T03:40:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	thats seems to be happening a lot.  not sure why
2008-06-10T03:40:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 because it's hardcoded in, i'm sure.
2008-06-10T03:40:00.000Z	matt444	legend2440	 is then an upstream change or just ubuntu?  Seems insane to change directory structure that has existed for a long long time.
2008-06-10T03:41:00.000Z	legend2440	matt444	yes it does. not sure if its just ubuntu or not
