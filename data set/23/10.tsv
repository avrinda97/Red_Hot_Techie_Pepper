2004-12-14T09:02:00.000Z	lev	jdub	in the ubuntu forum some guy said his worked when he set it up as eth0.. how do you do that to a wireless card??
2004-12-14T09:03:00.000Z	jdub	lev	you don't really do that directly, and it's unrelated to the driver not connecting to an interface
2004-12-14T09:04:00.000Z	jdub	lev	it's unrelated to the problem
2004-12-14T09:05:00.000Z	jdub	lev	provide useful information to help people solve the problem, like the answers you've given me
2004-12-14T09:10:00.000Z	jdub	lev	if i knew the precise problem, you'd have working wifi by now
