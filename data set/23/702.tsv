2011-03-24T20:44:00.000Z	andaiii	remoteCTRL2	I mean ubuntu keeps crashing and i dunno what's wrong but it seems to be a I/O error on my root partition
2011-03-24T20:45:00.000Z	andaiii	remoteCTRL2	might also be the fact my mother dropped this laptop several times

2011-03-24T20:46:00.000Z	andaiii	remoteCTRL2	maybe..?

2011-03-24T20:48:00.000Z	remoteCTRL2	andaiii	sudo apt-get install smartmontools
2011-03-24T20:48:00.000Z	andaiii	remoteCTRL2	is there a way to do that without quitting IRSSI
2011-03-24T20:48:00.000Z	remoteCTRL2	andaiii	i am afraid i wouldnt know what that is?

2011-03-24T20:58:00.000Z	remoteCTRL2	andaiii	smartmontools, have a look at the manpages
2011-03-24T21:00:00.000Z	remoteCTRL2	andaiii	man smartctl it is
2011-03-24T21:03:00.000Z	andaiii	remoteCTRL2	I passed the health test. What next
2011-03-24T21:04:00.000Z	remoteCTRL2	andaiii	well if you passed the healthtest and fsck did not report any errors my guess is that your data should be safe
