2006-11-29T17:56:00.000Z	crimsun	NET||abuse	you might want to hang a few days before installing proftpd.
2006-11-29T17:57:00.000Z	NET||abuse	crimsun	why would i want to hold a few days on proftpd?
2006-11-29T17:58:00.000Z	crimsun	NET||abuse	https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/security-review/2006-November/000433.html
2006-11-29T17:58:00.000Z	crimsun	NET||abuse	see the CVE and bug references there.
2006-11-29T17:59:00.000Z	NET||abuse	crimsun	thanks for the linnk ;)
2006-11-29T06:00:00.000Z	NET||abuse	crimsun	i'm on dapper, not edgy
2006-11-29T06:01:00.000Z	crimsun	NET||abuse	yes, I know. Note how the debdiff is for Edgy, hence why I mentioned you will want to wait since you want Dapper.
