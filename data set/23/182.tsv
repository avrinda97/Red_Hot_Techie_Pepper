2012-11-26T17:53:00.000Z	biopyte		i dont have a router, its just a mobile broadband usbstick ... i check out tc, thx
2012-11-26T17:55:00.000Z	biopyte		tc looks like it can do what i want, but syntax is rather difficult ... i'll see
2012-11-26T17:57:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	you can't control download reliably
2012-11-26T17:58:00.000Z	biopyte	krababbel	i thought there must be something like "nice" for bandwith (instead cpu)
2012-11-26T17:59:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	you can control upload, and prioritise packets created by your preferred application, but that only works up to a point, but better than nothing I think
2012-11-26T17:59:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	IP doesn't work like that. You'd have to have control over the entire network path to effectively allocate bandwith, like in a LAN
2012-11-26T18:02:00.000Z	biopyte	krababbel	i understand
2012-11-26T18:02:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	the same I already suggested, upload QoS could reduce jitter, so latency would vary less. Of course you cannot lower your real latency to a server by yourself
2012-11-26T18:03:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	I have such a setup, and unless I open more than 10 tabs at once, it works ok, lowers the jitter a bit
2012-11-26T18:04:00.000Z	biopyte	krababbel	but QoS is for routers not for mobile?!
2012-11-26T18:05:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	true, I believe wireless is different. I guess LTE would be the only way to have packets over wireless networks or something I read. I don't use mobile internet here.
2012-11-26T18:06:00.000Z	biopyte	krababbel	i thik this is getting too difficult, thx anyway
2012-11-26T18:06:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	but still, if a user is using a lot of bandwidth, a local router could maybe reduce the effect
2012-11-26T18:07:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	it is a bit involved, and the router has to support it
2012-11-26T18:08:00.000Z	biopyte	krababbel	dont want to get too involved ... was thinking of something like "bandwith-nice firefox 0"   ;)
2012-11-26T18:09:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	there is a program you could try I guess
2012-11-26T18:10:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	wondershaper or maybe trickle do automatic tc setup
2012-11-26T18:13:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	no, should be in the repos, I used it some time ago
2012-11-26T18:15:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	then recently I setup an old PC to be the router, and setup tc and iptables myself. But there are not many programs which do it. http://lartc.org/wondershaper/
2012-11-26T18:18:00.000Z	biopyte	krababbel	trickle looks promising, thanks for that one ... i check it out later
2012-11-26T18:20:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	no problem, just remember it is all an IP hack basically, you are trying to limit incoming packets, so the buffer of the ISP doesn't get full, causing dropouts. On wireless it might be even different still.
2012-11-26T18:22:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	and the only way to somehow limit incoming packets, because it isn't directly possible and out of control for you, is to make the other side, the server, think you cannot cope with more packets, so the sender slows down. This only works with one server, that's why it is unreliable when you open many tabs at once.
2012-11-26T18:23:00.000Z	krababbel	biopyte	unless you limit you download speed to 10% or somethin per connection ;)
