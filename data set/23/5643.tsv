2006-10-30T08:25:00.000Z	sipher		I'm afraid. :( less than 5 minutes left on the edgy download.
2006-10-30T08:25:00.000Z	sipher		I will be REALLY mad if it breaks my setup.
2006-10-30T08:25:00.000Z	sipher		I'll stop recmomending ubuntu
2006-10-30T08:26:00.000Z	sipher		wastrel
2006-10-30T08:26:00.000Z	sipher		=/
2006-10-30T08:26:00.000Z	sipher		comforting.
2006-10-30T08:26:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	what is your setup? if you install from CD there shouldn't be much trouble, i had some issues with ndiswrapper on here, but hey, i am online wirelessly, aren't i? ;)
2006-10-30T08:26:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	I'm uprading a dapper install.
2006-10-30T08:27:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	mind you i have run other linuxes before and am new to (k)ubuntu, but from looks of lurking in this channel, upgraders don't seem to have as much joy as i do with edgy
2006-10-30T08:28:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	Ya I've heard many users are having problems.
2006-10-30T08:29:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	XAA is old acceleration architecture, EXA is the new one, font rendering is so much better/faster
2006-10-30T08:30:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	my ati has no aiglx support so i can't speak for how aiglx/beryl is
2006-10-30T08:31:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	ahh yes...I already have composition enabled.
2006-10-30T08:31:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	I have Xgl + beryl right now..
2006-10-30T08:31:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	EXA does help composite too, yeah
2006-10-30T08:32:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	here is where a seperate /home partition wins, you can install from scratch w/o losing data for the win
2006-10-30T08:33:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	I do have alot of data mounted on a seperate partition...
2006-10-30T08:33:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	hah
2006-10-30T08:34:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	i usually pay dearly for my single / setups
2006-10-30T08:34:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	data is almost always reconverable...unless the filesystem is punked.
2006-10-30T08:34:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	what got to me is edgy would not install onto a logical partition, which is where i have my /, so i needed to junk the cd and burn me the alternate which installed fine, and it even installed/used a for months unused gentoo grub splash
2006-10-30T08:35:00.000Z	sipher	morfic	Heh it seems t be going okay...the packages are going in fine.
2006-10-30T08:36:00.000Z	morfic	sipher	yoru gfx is?
