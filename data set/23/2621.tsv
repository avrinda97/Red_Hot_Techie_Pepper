2011-01-08T16:34:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	to make the backup over the network to another machine
2011-01-08T16:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	I see it availabel in packages apt-get install partimage
2011-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	i found a partimage-server but now i have a versions mismatch......
2011-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	do you know how to update partimage on the sysresccd live system using any app-installler?
2011-01-08T16:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	well fix it one one side or the other if ubuntu is the only choice ppa or go back a version with pin
2011-01-08T16:40:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	what is pin?
2011-01-08T16:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	wow two people in just 10 min ask that https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
2011-01-08T17:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	what version is on the side you can't change?
2011-01-08T17:18:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	i changed both but WHY is there NO compatibility between any version
2011-01-08T17:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	maybe just use the dd command to create a image of the partition and rsync that file
2011-01-08T17:20:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	to difficult for a thing that should be so simple...
2011-01-08T17:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	what two lines instead of one?
2011-01-08T17:22:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	only one hdd inside the machine, dd dumpts also the empty parts, so everything and time is the reason
2011-01-08T17:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	well the rsync might compress it before it sends it
2011-01-08T17:25:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	how to install partimaged 0.6.9 on ubuntu 10.4?
2011-01-08T17:28:00.000Z	raven	sacarlson	i have 0.6.9 on the newest release of sysresccd
2011-01-08T17:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	you can look deeper in ppa but I think it will require compile
2011-01-08T17:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	I'm sure you know where the source is http://www.partimage.org/Download
2011-01-08T17:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	I also note that there is a partimage-ng  not sure if it's better or worse but seems to be a branch https://launchpad.net/partimage-ng
2011-01-22T20:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	I know they can turn midi into note sheets never seen any software that did the reverse but not that is doesn't exist
2011-02-24T00:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	raven	maybe it's time to use that disk for music or video files and boot from some other disk you have laying around
