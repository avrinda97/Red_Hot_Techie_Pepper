2005-10-03T10:12:00.000Z	khermans	Amaranth	why not use it?
2005-10-03T10:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	khermans	I think you wanted to talk to Travis|H

2006-01-03T16:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	khermans	We don't help you break into a website.
2006-01-03T16:10:00.000Z	khermans	Amaranth	why not?
2006-01-03T16:10:00.000Z	khermans	Amaranth	thats not breaking -- its just convenience
2006-01-03T16:11:00.000Z	khermans	Amaranth	it has nothing to do with getting unauthorized access

2006-03-26T09:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	khermans	the install cd will always be available, but might not be mailed through shipit
2006-03-26T09:34:00.000Z	khermans	Amaranth	oh i see -- but the LiveCd will allow install too
2006-03-26T09:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	khermans	I think the plan is to have shipit ship Ubuntu Live + Kubuntu Live instead of Ubuntu Install + Ubuntu Live
2006-03-26T09:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	khermans	yeah
2006-03-26T09:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	khermans	haha

2006-03-26T09:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	khermans	Anything more than 5 has to be manually approved.
2006-03-26T09:36:00.000Z	khermans	Amaranth	oh maybe that is why -- UMass Amherst has distributed over 300 Breezy discs so far
2006-03-26T09:37:00.000Z	khermans	Amaranth	Linux is huge on campus now -- at least compared to other Unis I've been to
