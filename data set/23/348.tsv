2012-05-23T18:07:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		what is different between version 18 and 19

2012-05-23T18:07:00.000Z	dontknow		Lunar_Lamp, there are changes of course but for me security is important
2012-05-23T18:07:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		ah I see
2012-05-23T18:07:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		I got firefox with adblock plus and Noscript
2012-05-23T18:07:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		I think that is OK for me

2012-05-23T18:09:00.000Z	dontknow	Lunar_Lander	i installed chrome stable 19 but it is laggy in my computer, chromium builds for ubuntu gives me better performance

2012-05-23T18:10:00.000Z	dontknow	Lunar_Lander	yes. and i am angry now, it is still 19 lol
2012-05-23T18:10:00.000Z	dontknow	Lunar_Lander	*it is still 18
2012-05-23T18:10:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		the last days when I switched to 12.04, the PC froze several times when running YouTube, I thought that there was an issue with Flash, now yesterday there was an update coming in called "linux-headers-3.2.0-24-generic-pae" and "linux-image-3.2.0-24-generic-pae", since then the hanging didn't happen again
2012-05-23T18:10:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		are those two updates like the "core" of ubuntu?
2012-05-23T18:10:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	dontknow	Oh ok
