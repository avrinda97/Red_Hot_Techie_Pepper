2007-09-13T16:26:00.000Z	stefg	d90	read above, ppc is no longer officially supported.... and having only 192 MB ram i'd go for xubuntu
2007-09-13T16:28:00.000Z	stefg	d90	make sure not pay more than, say, 100 bucks if it's a notebook
2007-09-13T16:28:00.000Z	d90	stefg	ok thx
2007-09-13T16:29:00.000Z	d90	stefg	yes I`m going to pay it 50euros
2007-09-13T16:29:00.000Z	stefg	d90	fair deal.... run xubuntu 6.06 and you'll be fine
2007-09-13T16:29:00.000Z	d90	stefg	thx a lot
