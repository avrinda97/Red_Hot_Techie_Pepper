2012-09-28T00:38:00.000Z	unsobill		i get lots of this guys "hub 2-1:1.0: over-current condition on port 5
2012-09-28T00:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	often caused by buggy usb2 drivers... best of luck.
2012-09-28T00:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	does a module get loaded that makes them work?  perhaps you need to tell the system to manually load that module on boot?  just guessing.
2012-09-28T00:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	i doubt that's the module name!
2012-09-28T00:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	does "lsusb" from terminal show you?
2012-09-28T00:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	have you searched with that PL2303?
2012-09-28T00:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	no, like online.
2012-09-28T00:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	"hardy" isn't exactly current information!
2012-09-28T00:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	stop
2012-09-28T01:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	you can more-or-less ignore the "hub 2-1:1.0: over-current condition" if you want!  i've had to rebuild kernels on people's computer to get rid of it - it involved removing the usb2 driver, even though i'd "guess" usb2 worked beforehand.
2012-09-28T01:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	c++ chat is OT here.

2012-09-28T01:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	it "might" be.  BUT - i HIGHLY recommend against trying to custom compile your kernel!
2012-09-28T01:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	i'm guessing that's for a 2.6 kernel anyways!  outdated for sure.
2012-09-28T01:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	i'd save lsmod's output when it's NOT working, then save lsmod's output when it IS working - is there any difference?  if so, tell ubuntu to lead that additional module on boot.
2012-09-28T01:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	s/lead/load/
2012-09-28T01:09:00.000Z	unsobill	zykotick9	whats this ?s/lead/load/
2012-09-28T01:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	correction using regular expression in previous statement SUBSTITUTE/THIS/THAT/
2012-09-28T01:10:00.000Z	unsobill	zykotick9	thats working lsmod http://pastebin.com/1XR3JZ6z
2012-09-28T01:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	FYI i don't go to pastebin.com (if you want me to read your pastes, please switch to a non-advertising/non-tracking site, like paste.ubuntu.com or not... up to you)
2012-09-28T01:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	but just look yourself - is there any difference?
2012-09-28T01:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	unsobill	so you need to add that to boot (don't ask me - someone else should know)
2012-09-28T01:16:00.000Z	unsobill	zykotick9	letme check
