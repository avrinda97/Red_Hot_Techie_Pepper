2009-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	what's the problem ? reinstall seems a little drastic...
2009-11-02T19:58:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	on Karmic ?
2009-11-02T19:59:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	can you pastebin your Xorg.0.log
2009-11-02T20:03:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	any recent changes to h/w  ? I presume you graphics is ok during POST/boot sequence ?
2009-11-02T20:07:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	I don't see inherent problems with your xorg.conf, problem is you don't know what the problem is yet
2009-11-02T20:08:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	can you get to grub screen and edit the boot line ?
2009-11-02T20:09:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	boot in to single user mode
2009-11-02T20:10:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	or recovery mode
2009-11-02T20:13:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	do you have choices on your grub menu to select recovery/single ?
2009-11-02T20:14:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	that I don't know ...
2009-11-02T20:16:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	yes
2009-11-02T20:17:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	yes that will do
2009-11-02T20:18:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	cd to /etc/X11 and rename the xorg.conf file to something like xorg.conf.broken
2009-11-02T20:19:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	make sure there's no xorg.conf file, then move your xorg.0.log file somewhere else too
2009-11-02T20:22:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	no xorg.conf is not strictly true
2009-11-02T20:23:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	if xorg.conf is present xserver will process it, otherwise defaults will be used. Replace with your backup ...
2009-11-02T20:27:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	any luck ?
2009-11-03T20:22:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	joeyeye	Hello, I am still trying to fix my graphics. Thanks for your help yesterday
2009-11-03T20:50:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	are you still having the display driver issue ?
2009-11-03T20:53:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	joeyeye	Yes I am getting nowhere fast with google. Lots of people have solved their problem by removing compiz but that hasnt worked for me. The annoying thing is that worked until I copied in xorg.conf. Then when I deleted xorg.conf to try to get back to how it was before I had all the problems we talked about yesterday.
2009-11-03T20:56:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	so what state are you in now  ?
2009-11-03T20:59:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	joeyeye	Apart from frustrated and reaching for my Hardy CD? :-) Desktop machine still has torn and blurred graphics whether I use the onboard intel graphics adapter or my matrox G200. Laptop has some weird shadow left from the notification area which obsures part of firefox. Yesterday we copied xorg.conf back to /etc/X11 and commented all the xinerama stuff out so I have a bog standard xorg.conf but still have problems.
2009-11-03T21:10:00.000Z	joeyeye	JonathanEllis	I was asking what state is your computer now  ?
