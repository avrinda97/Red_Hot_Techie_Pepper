2006-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	cg		no it work well under window 2k
2006-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	salmiak_	cg	start alsamixer
2006-05-16T06:14:00.000Z	cg		i just use pcm.
2006-05-16T06:15:00.000Z	salmiak_	cg	i had unpleasant sounds before, and i played around with the settings in the mixer. It turned out that one of the amps didn't like it when they were maxed out. I found that around 70% of max amplification made the unpleasant sounds disappear, and i still could get a high volume out of my speakers
2006-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	salmiak_	cg	i'd recommend you to turn down pcm to around 70% and use Master to control your volume
2006-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	cg		adjust the level seems useless,:(
2006-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	cg		i'll try
2006-05-16T06:19:00.000Z	cg		adjust the level is useless.
2006-05-16T06:21:00.000Z	salmiak_	cg	then it can't be the same problem i had. :/
2006-05-16T06:21:00.000Z	cg		is there a list to show supported sound card in ubuntu?
2006-05-16T06:21:00.000Z	cg		i think so?
2006-05-16T06:22:00.000Z	cg		i mean good support, not this quality
2006-05-16T06:22:00.000Z	salmiak_	cg	what player do you use to play your music files?
2006-05-16T06:22:00.000Z	salmiak_		xmms?
2006-05-16T06:22:00.000Z	cg		xmms
2006-05-16T06:23:00.000Z	salmiak_	cg	have you checked if you use alsa as your output?
