2006-10-15T07:51:00.000Z	Zambezi		Is there any easy CD/DVD-recorder application for the console?
2006-10-15T07:12:00.000Z	Zambezi		I can't ping, SSH or access my system local. I need help now. Please.
2006-10-15T07:14:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	what happens when you try to login locally?
2006-10-15T07:14:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	By this I assume you mean physically sitting at the computer.
2006-10-15T07:15:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	Nothing. The screen is just black.
2006-10-15T07:15:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	black from poweron?  No grub message?  no bios message?
2006-10-15T07:15:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	But it's also black with IPCop, but not with a Windows computer I tried with.
2006-10-15T07:16:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	I'm not following you.
2006-10-15T07:17:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	It's so less stressful in PM. Can we take it there?
2006-10-15T07:17:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	prefer to keep it here, I'm in a few channels and it's easier not to have to switch windows every 3 seconds to follow them
2006-10-15T07:17:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	plus it allows someone else to jump in with info if they have any
2006-10-15T07:18:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	Okay, but then I make a summary and give it here. Hold on. It takes a couple of minutes.
2006-10-15T07:18:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	k
2006-10-15T07:29:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	About 120 days ago I turned on the computer and yesterday a heard a strange sound like a cable got disconnected, but I was okay. // Today I tried to access the computer with SSH (remote) and I got disconnected with the messages "No route to host". I can't reconnect, can't ping. // I go to the computer, touch the keyboard to get a picture, but nothing happens. // But I get a picture with a Windowscomputer a tried with. And I can access my IPCop
2006-10-15T07:30:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	check your cables and reboot?
2006-10-15T07:30:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	I can't reboot since I need to do a recovery.
2006-10-15T07:31:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	I accidently deleted files and need to see what I erased. I'm going to do the recovery with tct and I don't know what happens if I turn off the computer.
2006-10-15T07:34:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	I don't know what tct is.  Also, it sounds like for one reason or another your computer has been rendered inaccessible without reboot.  I don't know what to tell you, sorry.
2006-10-15T07:38:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	I haven't used tct yet. I haven't touch the computer so much. I changed the right on a folder, transfered files there. That's all.
2006-10-15T07:38:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	Is it possible I got hacked? :s
2006-10-15T07:39:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	I changed the right on one folder on hdd2 to the user instead of root.
2006-10-15T07:39:00.000Z	kaot	Zambezi	is it possible you got hacked?  It's possible but it doesn't sound very likely.
2006-10-15T07:40:00.000Z	Zambezi	kaot	Cause a hacker wouldn't break the system?
