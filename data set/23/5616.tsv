2007-05-17T10:38:00.000Z	badkitty		Which applications are best used for Remote Desktop between ubuntu and Windows?
2007-05-17T10:40:00.000Z	badkitty		Can VNC do it?
2007-05-17T10:41:00.000Z	badkitty		Cool, I figured vnc could probably do it, just wanted to see if anyone knew of some other options
2007-05-17T10:41:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	what OS is the remote pc running that you want to connect to?
2007-05-17T10:42:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	I would like to be able to connect to winxp and linux
2007-05-17T10:42:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	then like levander said, vnc is a good way to go.
2007-05-17T10:44:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	great I will have to check out the docs for vnc then... I was at their website a few days ago... it coul use a little beautification...
2007-05-17T10:45:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	np, to connect from linux to a remote machine running vnc server just use Internet > Terminal Service Client and set Protocol to VNC.
2007-05-17T10:48:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	If my buddies accross the internet and through a router, how could I dial into his machine? Would I have to configure his router to forward traffic or can I do it another way?
2007-05-17T10:50:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	em i don't know anything about dialing in.. as in dial-up
2007-05-17T10:50:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	not dialup... accross the internet- get to his pc even though hes behind a router
2007-05-17T10:51:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	if there is no firewall in the way and he's not using NAT then you can go right in.. assuming the ISP hasn't blocked the port
2007-05-17T10:51:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	if there are say three computers behind the router, what do I do to specify a certain one?
2007-05-17T10:52:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	that probably means he is using NAT which means someone will have to configure the router
2007-05-17T10:53:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	usually by connecting to a web interface on the router's IP and setting up Port Forwarding, or something
2007-05-17T10:54:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	yah thats what i figured... i was hoping there could be an extension of some sort I would add to the address field in tsclient or something
2007-05-17T10:55:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	basically just toss the routers ip in a web browser (on the network with the router) and click Advanced > Port Forwarding.. then set incoming connections on port 5900 to IP X
2007-05-17T10:55:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	IP X being the static IP of the machine you want to connect to
2007-05-17T10:55:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	assuming the machines behind the router are setup with static IP's
2007-05-17T10:56:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	yah I know how to do that much thanks....
2007-05-17T10:56:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	gl
2007-05-17T10:56:00.000Z	badkitty	bluecat9	thanks
2007-05-17T10:57:00.000Z	bluecat9	badkitty	for added security it is best to not use port 5900 when you configure the router... dead give away it's vnc
