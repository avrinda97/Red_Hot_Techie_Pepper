2006-10-06T09:44:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	dont remember 6.06 install but if swap already exists cant you just leave it as is
2006-10-06T09:45:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	I set up the swap partition using the ubuntu partition manager during install. It seems ok until I click next and it displays 0kb for the partition
2006-10-06T09:46:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	is this a second install on another partition
2006-10-06T09:47:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	Second install? I have windows already installed if that's what you mean.
2006-10-06T09:48:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	you r trying to install ubuntu and dual boot Win and Ubuntu correct
2006-10-06T09:48:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	correct
2006-10-06T09:49:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	when you said you set up swap did you use parted to create swap and space for ubuntu
2006-10-06T09:50:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	I partitioned the drive into three: windows, empty partition, and ubuntu partition. I then tried to create a swap partition from the ubuntu partition.
2006-10-06T09:51:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	what size is the empty partition
2006-10-06T09:52:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	approximate size
2006-10-06T09:52:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	14.65gb, ubuntu: 8.74GB
2006-10-06T09:53:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	is your name registered so we can go to a private channel?
2006-10-06T09:53:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	no
2006-10-06T09:53:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	how do I register it?
2006-10-06T09:54:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	first go to node you logged into  then  these two commands   /nick  thejoe   then  /msg nickserv register  <passwd>
2006-10-06T09:54:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	 <passwd> is a password of your choosing remember it
2006-10-06T09:55:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	be aware that   thejoe  may be registered and you will have to alter or take on a new identity
2006-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	registered
2006-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	ok stand by
2006-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	we now have a pvt channel go there
2006-10-06T09:57:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	sorry one more step     /msg  nickserv identify  <passwd>
2006-10-06T09:57:00.000Z	kbee	thejoe	let me change names to my registered name be right back
2006-10-06T09:58:00.000Z	thejoe	kbee	ok
