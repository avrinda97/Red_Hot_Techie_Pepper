2005-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	Thorrn4		....the Ubuntu Guide does not talk about mounting another Harddrive
2005-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	Thorrn4		how can I do it? it is a NTFS drive
2005-05-27T13:53:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	look beyond the ubuntuguide
2005-05-27T13:53:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	mounting hard drives of any flavors is a common linux operation
2005-05-27T13:55:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	ask uncle google, he will help you (or go to www.tldp.org and wallow in the knowledge there)
2005-05-27T13:57:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	it is possible, to mount ntfs. go 2 www.tldp.org
2005-05-27T14:00:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	my advice would be to mount the NTFS read-only, back up your stuff, and then reformat it to a linux filesystem
2005-05-27T14:00:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	and put all your stuff back
2005-05-27T14:01:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	The Linux Documentation Project (www.tldp.org) has tons of info on mounting every possible device that can be stuck into a machine
2005-05-27T14:01:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	it doesnt have to come from ubuntuguide
2005-06-19T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	mornin
2005-06-19T09:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	<mutter>join the club</mutter>
2005-06-19T09:05:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	our a/c went out, so no sleep til monday
2005-06-19T09:06:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	point to point protocol daemon
2005-06-19T09:09:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	your 'buntu box is positively SWARMING with daemons right at this very instant!
2005-06-19T09:11:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	dunno what you've got installed, might be a cupsd, a sshd, dunno
2005-06-19T09:11:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	if you have CUPS installed, you have a cups(D)aemon running
2005-06-19T09:12:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	the cupsd 'listens' for you to hit <ctrl-p> or whatver it is to print something
2005-06-19T09:13:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	if you have dialup, the ppp(d)aemon listens for "pon" (dial up) and "poff" (hang up) and it dials the phone or hangs up
2005-06-19T09:13:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	just giving you examples
2005-06-19T09:46:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	did i explain your daemons adequately?
2005-06-19T09:48:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	the daemons 'listen' for their cue to go to work, yes
2005-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	nalioth	Thorrn4	yes breezy is the next level
