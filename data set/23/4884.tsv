2007-06-08T11:02:00.000Z	ticky		so. can't anybody really help? how do i update $PATH permanently
2007-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	ticky		it looks like it's simple. but i think ubuntu/debian work differently
2007-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	google turns up nothin?
2007-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	i have already searched.. it said to update /etc/environment but i don't see the changes reflected
2007-06-08T11:05:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	hmmm

2007-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	i have read that debian works in a differnet way, i have already used export, PATH=$PATH:blahblah, and have edited /etc/environment but i cannot get it to work
2007-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	thanks. but is there a way to do it natively?
2007-06-08T11:08:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	i think there might be, since i think a program added /home/limecat/bin
2007-06-08T11:09:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	may i ask why you need to?
2007-06-08T11:10:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	sure, i want to add ~/bin as you just mentioned, but also i want to create a new env. variable to use in one of my crontab scripts
2007-06-08T11:10:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	so ~/bin is NOT default
2007-06-08T11:16:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	you have full access to your bin directory without needing to sudo....
2007-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	sorry, but i cannot see the problem
2007-06-08T11:18:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	it is accessing ~/bin
2007-06-08T11:25:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	waitaaaaaaaaminute.. so crontab is executed as root.? i still don't get this
2007-06-08T11:26:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	im not sure and i dont claim to be an expert
2007-06-08T11:28:00.000Z	ticky	LordLimecat	may i msg you in private?
2007-06-08T11:29:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	sure
2007-06-08T11:33:00.000Z	LordLimecat	ticky	msg away :)
