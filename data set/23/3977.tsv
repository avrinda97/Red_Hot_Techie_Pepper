2008-06-12T22:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	try installing the ubuntu-desktop metapackage
2008-06-12T22:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	or kubuntu-desktop, if you use kubuntu
2008-06-12T22:38:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	kind  of shy to try that now that I'm getting things back the way they were ;)
2008-06-12T22:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that depends on all the standard ubuntu packages
2008-06-12T22:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	it's a good way to get them all installed if you somehow uninstalled everything
2008-06-12T22:39:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	does that include apache2, etc.?
2008-06-12T22:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	no
2008-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	apache2 is not part of the default install
2008-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	and that's where I'm having the problem
2008-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	so your apache2 got deinstalled?
2008-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	just reinstall it? :)
2008-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	it's almost like during the upgrade it removed everything that _wasn't_ in the desktop metapackage
2008-06-12T22:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	well that shouldn't happen
2008-06-12T22:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	using any non-ubuntu repos?
2008-06-12T22:41:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	yes I reinstalled it and dozens of other files that I needed for my config. that included many customized files I'm having to diff, etc. serious pain.
2008-06-12T22:41:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	I don't believe so. medibuntu and maybe ugly repos
2008-06-12T22:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	anyway, that really shouldn't happen. But since I don't know what exactly you did, all I can say is good luck fixing it :/
2008-06-12T22:42:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	no only basic sources. canonical and multiverse, etc.
2008-06-12T22:42:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	should I file a bug? something went very wrong for sure
2008-06-12T22:42:00.000Z	tripps	Chousuke	shouldn't there be a log of the upgrade?
2008-06-12T22:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	I don't know.
2008-06-12T22:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	you might file a bug, though
2008-06-12T22:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	tripps	doesn't hurt
