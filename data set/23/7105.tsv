2006-04-14T15:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	nothing you might have to add the key
2006-04-14T15:34:00.000Z	Nameeater_	gnomefreak	I still get the error after importing it
2006-04-14T15:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	can you pastebin the output of sudo apt-get update please
2006-04-14T15:36:00.000Z	Nameeater_	gnomefreak	 http://name.pastebin.com/649154
2006-04-14T15:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	you did both commands for the key import including where it says "key" you added the key number?
2006-04-14T15:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	let me see output of that whne your done too
2006-04-14T15:40:00.000Z	Nameeater_	gnomefreak	http://name.pastebin.com/649157
2006-04-14T15:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	you can still grab updates and stuff right?
2006-04-14T15:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	i have a feeling its something on thier side. i would say email the guy and see what he says there may be a new key for it and hasnt been updated yet
2006-04-14T15:46:00.000Z	Nameeater_	gnomefreak	do you have the backports repo? and I dont think the updates work
2006-04-14T15:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	 i dont use backports
2006-04-14T15:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	i may still have my breezy list hold on a sec
2006-04-14T15:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	getting key now
2006-04-14T15:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	here is the key listed 437D05B5
2006-04-14T15:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	email the guy at teh email address and explain what is going on
2006-04-14T15:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	for you to get stuff froma repo you dont need a key
2006-04-14T15:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	only thing a key does is verify  some 3rd party repos dont have a key (atleast not released)
2006-04-14T15:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	make sure the repo itself is correct no stray marks stuff like that
2006-04-14T15:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to pastebin please
2006-04-14T15:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	also ompaul has a good point since ubuntu doesnt support the backports iirc its a team of users
2006-04-14T16:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Nameeater_	it all looks right messy but right email the guy and let him know its not something on your end
