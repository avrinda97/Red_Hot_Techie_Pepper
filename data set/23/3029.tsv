2009-03-30T07:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bonez46	why  not proper Ubuntu?
2009-03-30T08:00:00.000Z	bonez46	sebsebseb	well, this one looks interesting and it says it includes several games... I am trying to 'convert' my three sons, ages 13, 11 and 9 over to linux .. so that they won't want any windows...
2009-03-30T08:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bonez46	what looks interesting?
2009-03-30T08:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bonez46	well get them a games console in that case as well.   a  Nintendo WII :)  then it should be ok
2009-03-30T08:01:00.000Z	bonez46	sebsebseb	so maybe the question is where I can direct them to go, to fulfill their need to blast and create and do whatever with roblox and other games.. but on linux instead of windows
2009-03-30T08:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bonez46	well anything, but Xbox :)

2009-03-30T08:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bonez46	it can be done, but xorg is  not that easy to  configure, for things like that
