2011-07-01T03:49:00.000Z	hopeandpray		it's erincribbs23
2011-07-01T03:51:00.000Z	hopeandpray		i'm trying to do some forensic digging in the terminal. is there anyone that can help me?
2011-07-01T03:52:00.000Z	hopeandpray		there you are. that's what they called it.
2011-07-01T03:54:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	how can anyone help if u dont even ask a proper question?
2011-07-01T03:55:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	well what, you accidentally deleted them?
2011-07-01T03:57:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	you should have backed them up first if theyre that important, on dvd or something. recovering files is random even if you do manage to recover them 99% chanc they will be corrupted
2011-07-01T03:58:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	just out of interest is it a hard drive or an ssd?
2011-07-01T03:58:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	no just ssds is almost impossible to recover from. how long ago was it you "lost" the files?
2011-07-01T03:59:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	have u tried searching for them by any chance?
2011-07-01T03:59:00.000Z	hopeandpray	sudokill	yes. katmagic, i'll try it.
2011-07-01T04:04:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	yes backup because the more u use the drive the more chance of them being overwritten
2011-07-01T04:08:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	no idea how good this is but found this random prog http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/
2011-07-01T04:09:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	hes not trying to offend you. he is saying the more you use the drive, the data might become unrecoverable (if it isnt already)
2011-07-01T04:10:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	i got a good idea
2011-07-01T04:10:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	download partedmagic and burn to disk, it has a program called photorec thats supposedly "data recovery"
2011-07-01T04:12:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	 http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec
2011-07-01T04:12:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	try photorec and read up on it
2011-07-01T04:13:00.000Z	hopeandpray	sudokill	i tried that site earlier and couldn't get it to work.
2011-07-01T04:13:00.000Z	hopeandpray	sudokill	ok.
2011-07-01T04:14:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	like i said, download partedmagic, burn it to disk (all with ur desktop) and photorec is already on there... working
2011-07-01T04:15:00.000Z	hopeandpray	sudokill	that's what i'm starting to think.
2011-07-01T04:16:00.000Z	sudokill	hopeandpray	try partedmagic with photorec then. idk how desperate u r. if i could tell u a sure way to get it all back i would, but afaik there isnt such a way
