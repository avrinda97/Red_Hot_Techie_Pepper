2011-01-14T22:23:00.000Z	neurochrome		can you use tasksel to remove lamp?
2011-01-14T22:23:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	should do, yes
2011-01-14T22:24:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	tasksel: aptitude failed (100)
2011-01-14T22:24:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	how about giving the complete command issued?
2011-01-14T22:24:00.000Z	neurochrome		sudo tasksel
2011-01-14T22:24:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	it brings up a wizard
2011-01-14T22:25:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	how about "sudo tasksel remove lamp-server"?
2011-01-14T22:26:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	same again, just tried
2011-01-14T22:26:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	and that is the complete error?
2011-01-14T22:26:00.000Z	neurochrome		yep
2011-01-14T22:29:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	have you done an "apt-get update" recently?
2011-01-14T22:30:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	just a sec ago
2011-01-14T22:30:00.000Z	neurochrome		nothing changed
2011-01-14T22:30:00.000Z	neurochrome		just ran sudo tasksel -t
2011-01-14T22:33:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	what happens if you try to install apache using aptitude?
2011-01-14T22:34:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	looks like there is an 'impossible situation' where packages rely on other packages
2011-01-14T22:34:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	apache is already installed
2011-01-14T22:34:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	well, there's your problem
2011-01-14T22:35:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	not by my doing... i used tasksel
2011-01-14T22:35:00.000Z	neurochrome		now it wont remove
2011-01-14T22:35:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	that may well be, but it makes no difference in getting it up and running. might be best simply to install the desired packages manually.
2011-01-14T22:36:00.000Z	neurochrome	sipior	I'm removing everything manually and starting again
2011-01-14T22:36:00.000Z	sipior	neurochrome	that'll also work :-)
