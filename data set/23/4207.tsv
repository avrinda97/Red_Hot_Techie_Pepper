2008-12-04T22:17:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	shiMMer	you might want to go to view --> show hidden file (ctrl+h)
2008-12-04T22:17:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	shiMMer	add "conky &" to your ~/.fluxbox/startup file
2008-12-04T22:19:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	shiMMer	there should be an example section to guide you...
2008-12-04T22:20:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	shiMMer	you probably know that a line that starts with # is a comment, and not executed...

2008-12-04T22:40:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	shiMMer	no, it should be conky
2008-12-04T22:41:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	shiMMer	also put a # infront of /usr/bin/fbsetroot -solid black
2008-12-04T22:41:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	shiMMer	like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/80428/
