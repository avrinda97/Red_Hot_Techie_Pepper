2004-11-12T15:18:00.000Z	p0windah		so I just copy the font into that area jdub ?
2004-11-12T15:20:00.000Z	p0windah		anyone know how fonts:/// works ?
2004-11-12T15:21:00.000Z	p0windah		I tried to copy my firefly.tff file into that folder and it doesnt appear to do anything or show the firefly font :(
2004-11-12T15:21:00.000Z	p0windah		is there meant to be some dialog or progress bar or something ?
2004-11-12T15:23:00.000Z	p0windah		no, doesnt appear
2004-11-12T15:23:00.000Z	p0windah		maybe reboot computer will help ?
2004-11-12T15:24:00.000Z	p0windah		I can see the firefly font in that folder
2004-11-12T15:26:00.000Z	p0windah		I just had a look in the "font" program under computer, and it isnt in the list
2004-11-12T15:26:00.000Z	p0windah		but I can see it got copied into ~/.fonts/
2004-11-12T15:26:00.000Z	p0windah		should I log out ?
2004-11-12T15:28:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	are you sure it is recognised as a font?
2004-11-12T15:29:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	enable thumbnailing and it should give you a preview of the font
2004-11-12T15:31:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	right, that's good :)
2004-11-12T15:32:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	yeah got that here as well
2004-11-12T15:32:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	but  copying the font to ~/.fonts/ worked for me
2004-11-12T15:33:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	copy the font to ~/.fonts/
2004-11-12T15:40:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	click ok several times, I had it once and it disapeared after a while, I saved the session and all was fine again
2004-11-12T15:42:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	does it appear in computer>>desktop preferences>>font ?
2004-11-12T15:43:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	it is possible, but it shouldn't be
2004-11-12T15:43:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	can you send me the font?
2004-11-12T16:04:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	I found it, it's not called firefly but AR PL New Sung
2004-11-12T16:05:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	yep, dropping the font gives that as a new one
2004-11-12T16:07:00.000Z	stvn	p0windah	it's supposed to be an azian font, right?
