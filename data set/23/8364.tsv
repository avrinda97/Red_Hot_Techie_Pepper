2005-07-12T11:16:00.000Z	twb_		is there a command to see the names of your partitions?
2005-07-12T11:16:00.000Z	twb_		thx
2005-07-12T11:17:00.000Z	twb_		ha, i mean, i need to duplicate one but i cant remember if its hda1 or hda 2
2005-07-12T11:17:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	cfdisk
2005-07-12T11:18:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	as root, but be careful not to change anything.
2005-07-12T11:20:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	not partitions with filesystems that you want to keep using
2005-07-12T11:22:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	ide masters and slaves are just about distinguishing two drives.
2005-07-12T13:02:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	you want to move a file system to another partition?
2005-07-12T13:04:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	what type of partition?
2005-07-12T13:04:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	I mean what type of file system?
2005-07-12T13:04:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	have you tried partimage?
2005-07-12T13:06:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	what Windows?  fat32?
2005-07-12T13:06:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	It's the file system type that matters.
2005-07-12T13:07:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	I use partimage to move windows partitions.  It works.  I haven't tried it with ntfs.
2005-07-12T13:07:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	if it's fat32, partimage certainly can do it.
2005-07-12T13:08:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	I'm trying to tell you.  yes
2005-07-12T13:10:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	yes, partimage is in universe.
2005-07-12T13:15:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	so try it out.  It's a good way to fix Windows.  Use it to move your Windows installation to a file for backup.  You can then move it to another disk.
2005-07-12T13:15:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	when Windows goes wrong, restore it from the file.
2005-07-12T13:15:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	again, cfdisk
2005-07-12T13:17:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	you have to tell it which drive to look at.
2005-07-12T13:18:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	for example,  cfdisk /dev/hdb
2005-07-12T13:19:00.000Z	merriam	twb_	this stuff is in the manual.  man cfdisk
