2011-07-23T16:17:00.000Z	freddy__		I have an ubuntu server that runs raid1. One of the disks have failed and now I want to change it. But when I change it I cannot boot! So I suspects that my something is wrong with my grub. If I go into grup and fires off 'find /boot/grub/stage1 ' I get (hd0.0)(hd1,0). Does this mean that I have grub installed on both drives ?
2011-07-23T16:18:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	raid1 means images
2011-07-23T16:19:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	ok - not sure what you mean by that ?
2011-07-23T16:19:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	you can boot from either one
2011-07-23T16:20:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	ok - but this is what I cannot do in practice ... so I need to somewhat find out why... you tell me that the the reason cannot be grub ?
2011-07-23T16:22:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	just seems that if I change the bad disk, grub does not start up, if I change the good disk, grub starts up but cannot find anything to boot ..
2011-07-23T16:23:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	get a livecd, recreate the the raid1
2011-07-23T16:23:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	sry ... it is the other way around... if i start up with the bad disc.. grub starts up but cannot find anything to boot, if I startup with the good disc grub does not start ...
2011-07-23T16:23:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	your /boot or /, which one on raid1?
2011-07-23T16:24:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	dont remember ... how can I see that ?
2011-07-23T16:26:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	what do you have? livecd or grub cli?
2011-07-23T16:27:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	I have a grub cli (connected from putty at the moment )
2011-07-23T16:27:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	what do you mean grub cli and putty?
2011-07-23T16:28:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	I run a ssh connection to my server via putty (terminal program) and when logged into the server via that, I can start grub from cli.
2011-07-23T16:29:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	so, you can boot up, right?
2011-07-23T16:29:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	yes if I have the faulty drive and the nonfaulty drive into the machine, I can boot..
2011-07-23T16:30:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	cat /proc/mdstat
2011-07-23T16:31:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	and cat /proc/mounts
2011-07-23T16:31:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	md0 : active raid1 sda1[0] 234372160 blocks [2/1] [U_]
2011-07-23T16:32:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	I have disabled the sdb1
2011-07-23T16:32:00.000Z	dli	freddy__	can you attache a new disk without removing anything
2011-07-23T16:35:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	I'm afraid I cannot, there are no more slots in the machine (dell) and dell wants the old faulty drive back..
2011-07-23T16:36:00.000Z	freddy__	dli	its a dell  poweredge t100
