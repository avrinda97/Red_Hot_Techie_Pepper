2009-10-02T13:51:00.000Z	snuxoll	cchen	please
2009-10-02T13:51:00.000Z	snuxoll		we have repositories for a reason
2009-10-02T13:53:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	:-) true!  but my work requires developments by using the latest java sdk with eclipse.  so I kind of out of choices.  I've installed ubuntu-restricted before, but the it won't compile until they instructed me to use the latest sdk from sun.  As for the flash, I use the 64 bit instead of using the 32 bit wrapper to run a 32-bit flash to avoid overhead of my box.
2009-10-02T13:54:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	i kind of worry by install ubuntu-restricted will break what I have here.
2009-10-02T13:55:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	that's why i was wondering if I can install the individual package alone.
2009-10-02T13:55:00.000Z	cchen		yazid: i'm here.  :-)
2009-10-02T13:55:00.000Z	snuxoll	cchen	cchen gstreamer0.10-plugins-good/bad/ugly iirc
2009-10-02T13:55:00.000Z	snuxoll		you don't need w32codecs anymore
2009-10-02T13:56:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	does gstreamer have codec already in w64codec?  Are they different set of codecs or the same?
2009-10-02T13:56:00.000Z	snuxoll	cchen	you don't need wcodecs
2009-10-02T13:57:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	kk, so gstreamer covers what wcodec covers, right?
2009-10-02T13:57:00.000Z	snuxoll	cchen	it should, yes
2009-10-02T13:57:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	i know totem uses gstreamer, but can totem use w64codec?
2009-10-02T13:57:00.000Z	snuxoll	cchen	no, it can't
2009-10-02T13:57:00.000Z	snuxoll		and you don't need w64codecs, so stop asking about it
2009-10-02T13:58:00.000Z	snuxoll		we have open source support for every media codec imaginable already, save for rmvb
2009-10-02T13:58:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	cool, that answers my question.  thanks
2009-10-02T13:58:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	by the way, what's in a multiverse package?
2009-10-02T13:59:00.000Z	snuxoll	cchen	restricted software, meaning there may be copyright or patent issues
2009-10-02T13:59:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad or gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse
2009-10-02T13:59:00.000Z	snuxoll	cchen	just go with bad, I've never installed multiverse
2009-10-02T14:00:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	they both bad.  :-)  one has multiverse in the package name and the description says the same thing for both packages.
2009-10-02T14:01:00.000Z	cchen	snuxoll	got it, either one works.  thanks~
