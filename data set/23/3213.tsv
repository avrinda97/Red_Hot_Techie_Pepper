2009-01-03T18:28:00.000Z	homy		How come "free -m" and System Monitor show about 200 mb difference in the currently used ram?
2009-01-03T18:30:00.000Z	Slart	homy	the used column in the +/- buffers row is the same as the number in the system monitor for me
2009-01-03T18:30:00.000Z	homy	Slart	oh, yeah, I was looking at the Mem: line.
2009-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	Slart	homy	ah.. that's without all the buffers used for caching files and stuff
2009-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	Slart	homy	or rather.. the mem line includes those
2009-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	homy	Slart	so actually, only the memory indicated by the Mem: line is available, but if different buffers are cleared (which isn't bad), as much as given in the +/- ... line is available?
2009-01-03T18:32:00.000Z	Slart	homy	right.. and the buffers are cleared automatically if a process needs more memory
2009-01-03T18:32:00.000Z	homy	Slart	thanks.
2009-01-03T18:32:00.000Z	Slart	homy	you're welcome
2009-03-28T12:54:00.000Z	Slart	homy	cygnus something?
2009-03-28T12:54:00.000Z	Slart	homy	cygwin.. that was it
2009-03-28T12:55:00.000Z	homy	Slart	and clearscreen: but on www.cygwin.com it says " Cygwin is not a way to run native linux apps on Windows.  You have to rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows. ".
2009-03-28T12:56:00.000Z	Slart	homy	oh.. my bad then.. never really used cygwin myself
2009-05-16T16:14:00.000Z	Slart	homy	isn't there a switch you need to use for it to actually fix things? have you checked "man fsck" ?
2009-05-16T16:15:00.000Z	homy	Slart	I think to simulate I would have to use the -N option?
2009-05-16T16:17:00.000Z	homy	Slart	I think I found it: "-r"!
2009-05-16T16:17:00.000Z	Slart	homy	-r might work.. there's more info in "man fsck.vfat"
2009-05-16T16:18:00.000Z	homy	Slart	right, thanks I only looked at "man fsck". Well anyway, -r worked! Thanks!
2009-05-16T16:19:00.000Z	Slart	homy	you're welcome
2009-08-06T15:01:00.000Z	Slart	homy	just ask your question.
2009-08-06T15:02:00.000Z	Slart	homy	try asking in #kubuntu, they may know more about kde
2009-08-06T15:02:00.000Z	homy	Slart	#kubuntu is empty
2009-08-06T15:03:00.000Z	Slart	homy	nope.. it's full of people.. try again
