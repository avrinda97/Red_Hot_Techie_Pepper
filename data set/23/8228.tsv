2008-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	are you in windows now?
2008-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	just reboot to ubuntu and try what I said, it sounds like compiz is messing up
2008-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	Also, make sure you wait at least 2 minutes before giving up, you may be hitting a bug where login stalls for 2 minutes
2008-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	On the login screen click on Options, then Sessions, then Failsafe GNOME. Then login.
2008-05-26T18:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	Do you get a screen where you can type in your username and password?
2008-05-26T18:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	That's the screen I'm talking about
2008-05-26T18:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	On the login screen click on Options, then Sessions, then Failsafe GNOME. Then login.
2008-05-26T18:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	I thought you were on the same computer, how could you have done that so fast
2008-05-26T18:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	Oh crap
2008-05-26T18:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	One of the things that looks like evolution is evolution-data-server, which your entire desktop depends on as its a generic data storage thing.
2008-05-26T18:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	So you just uninstalled your whole desktop
2008-05-26T18:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	blumm	It'll let you do whatever you want.
