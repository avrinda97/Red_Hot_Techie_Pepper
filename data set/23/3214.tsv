2008-12-30T15:40:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	try looking at files in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/
2008-12-30T15:41:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	ok and what should I found there ?
2008-12-30T15:42:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	the best way usually is to use the ondemand governor by writing 'ondemand' to scaling_governor there
2008-12-30T15:44:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	this is the case but my CPU speed never change even when my CPU is at 100% of use
2008-12-30T15:45:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	then what is most likely is that you do not have the correct driver loaded for the scaling to work, you can see the driver currently in use in the scaling_driver file
2008-12-30T15:46:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	It's "acpi-cpufreq"
2008-12-30T15:49:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	you can try telling the driver to switch frequencies directly by using the "userspace" scaling governor and writing a freqency to the scaling_setspeed file
2008-12-30T15:50:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	but there is one more thing - I once had a broken AC adapter on my Dell laptop and the CPU on that laptop refused to go to full frequency when that adapter was plugged in because it could not detect how many watts it could provide
2008-12-30T15:51:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	actually I'm on the battery
2008-12-30T15:52:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	I can't change the scaling_setspeed manualy. Vi says : Fsync error
2008-12-30T15:54:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	so you need to try loadig different scaling drivers and then try to change the frequency manually, I don't know the list of possible drivers, however
2008-12-30T15:55:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	he scaling_max_freq has 600000 value and I can't change to 1100000
2008-12-30T15:56:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	and what does cpuinfo_max_freq say?
2008-12-30T15:57:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	cpuinfo_max_freq is 1100000
2008-12-30T15:57:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	this is the point where I can't understand what's happend
2008-12-30T15:58:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	let me put it this way - the inux kernel hears that that the CPU is capable of 1.1Ghz, but is unable to find a knob that would allow it to reach that
2008-12-30T15:59:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	exactly
2008-12-30T16:02:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	look into /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq for possible drivers
2008-12-30T16:03:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	actually I'm using acpu-cpufreq but I don't know which other I can try
2008-12-30T16:05:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	could it be that your CPU is to new to have proper support in the kernel?
2008-12-30T16:05:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	I don't think so, my laptop is 3 years old
2008-12-30T16:37:00.000Z	sybux	aigarius	still here ? I've found an issue on internet. It seems that my laptop is becoming to hot and the thermal sense disable cpu scaling as my laptop is fan less. It seems to be reported as a bug. You can find more details here (for personal culture) : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/88899
2008-12-30T16:38:00.000Z	aigarius	sybux	that makes sense
