2011-02-19T03:46:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth: that sounds like something you should tweak in BIOS...do you have mobo manual?
2011-02-19T03:46:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth: otherwise, are the hard drives clean or is this multi-boot situation?
2011-02-19T03:47:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth: can you reformat them or not?
2011-02-19T03:48:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth:  i'm not an expert at this...internal drives formatted as RAID, correct?  is this done via mobo function or via some other os that's installed?
2011-02-19T03:50:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth:  hm...i'm kind of out of ideas.  Unless I'm mistaken, the mobo should present the RAID drives as a single device entity to software os -- or at least i think so
2011-02-19T03:51:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth: but my knowledge gets really thin at this point...
2011-02-19T03:52:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth:  if drivers required, i think you are SOL.  another drive would probably do it -- and i'd be willing to be you won't be able to access the RAID that's in there unless by miracle you find the right drivers
2011-02-19T03:52:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth:  drives are very cheap now -- especially if you just need 200GB SATA...they're like $40
2011-02-19T03:54:00.000Z	sneakyimp		can anyone tell me if there are source files or other stuff left over from my original "apt-get install php5" ?? if so, where would i find them?
2011-02-19T03:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sneakyimp	sources are in separate packages.
2011-02-19T03:54:00.000Z	sneakyimp	tonyyarusso	i'm just trying to find out what ./configure options they used to build php5
2011-02-19T03:55:00.000Z	sneakyimp	tonyyarusso	any ideas?  it's usually visible in phpinfo output but not in Ubuntu's build
2011-02-19T03:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sneakyimp	Download the source package and read the scripts in the debian directory then.
2011-02-19T03:56:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth: hard t say there...i think Ubuntu installer will try to move the boot.ini or create one if it can't find the windows 7 boot.ini.  If Ubuntu doesn't understand the fakeRAID format, then it will probably assume the drives are not formatted
2011-02-19T03:57:00.000Z	sneakyimp	tonyyarusso	 any idea where i might download those?  I'm quite unfamiliar with the structure of debian packages.  also, you think the configure command might be all in one place?  or would i need to parse out an entire long file?
2011-02-19T03:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sneakyimp	apt-get source php5.  Look in debian/rules in particular.
2011-02-19T03:58:00.000Z	sneakyimp		skutarth:  the only way you are likely to learn the truth here is the hard way...are you prepared to reinstall win 7 if it ruins everything?  if not, i wouldn't try it.
2011-02-19T03:58:00.000Z	sneakyimp		tonyyaruso:  you are the dude... thanks.  where does this put the package on my file system?
2011-02-19T03:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sneakyimp	current working directory
2011-02-19T03:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sneakyimp	(and don't use sudo)
2011-02-19T03:59:00.000Z	sneakyimp	tonyyarusso	less you friendly soul.  thanks
2011-02-19T03:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		np
2011-02-19T04:03:00.000Z	sneakyimp	tonyyarusso	 yikes!  that rules file is beastly
