2005-11-23T08:35:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	should be there
2005-11-23T08:32:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	xlibs-dev
2005-11-23T08:33:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	ha, np :)
2005-11-23T08:34:00.000Z	databe	bimberi	 it only shows pxlib-dev which doesn't seem to be it
2005-11-23T08:36:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	unless you only have CD sources available perhaps?
2005-11-23T08:38:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	no, that was me talking to ubotu (in this channel)
2005-11-23T08:38:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	it is xlibs-dev (note the s)
2005-11-23T08:39:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	put the contents of sources.list on a pastebin ...
2005-11-23T08:43:00.000Z	databe	bimberi	it is up there
2005-11-23T08:45:00.000Z	databe	bimberi	http://pastebin.com/433858
2005-11-23T08:46:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	hm, looks fine
2005-11-23T08:49:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	pastebin the output from "apt-cache policy xlibs-dev"
2005-11-23T09:22:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	what's the program?
2005-11-23T09:23:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	ok, so that's better than the one in ubuntu (xfce4)?
2005-11-23T09:24:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	yes, the package is xfce4, there's also ...
2005-11-23T09:25:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	yes
2005-11-23T09:26:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	but you have learnt a few things :)
2005-11-23T09:27:00.000Z	bimberi	databe	not completely sure sorry, might be configurable via the update-alternatives command
