2005-05-02T06:13:00.000Z	Nostromo^		how do i upgrade from hoary preview to the official hoary? or is it done automatically? (i simply keep my system updated for now with the taskbar tool)
2005-05-02T06:13:00.000Z	Nostromo^		alrighty, thanks.
2005-05-02T06:14:00.000Z	Nostromo^		also, where is the 'proper' place to get mplayer from? when im using marillat's amd64 packages for some odd reason it fails to work with -ao alsa.. only -ao oss..
2005-05-02T06:15:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	use -ao sdl :p
2005-05-02T06:15:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	what's wrong with using alsa directly?
2005-05-02T06:16:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	Using it is discouraged in the mplayer manual
2005-05-02T06:16:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	really? i wonder what's the reason for that discouragement. seems perfectly logical to me to use alsa..
2005-05-02T06:17:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	They say in the manual that it's buggy.
2005-05-02T06:19:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	From my limited knowledge of the linux sound system, im pretty sure that using SDL generally means using alsa anyways.
2005-05-02T06:19:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	yeah.
2005-05-02T06:19:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	so what you're saying makes little sense. it just means that mplayer may be alsa-buggy, not alsa itself.
2005-05-02T06:19:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	That's what I'm telling you. :p
2005-05-02T06:20:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	sorry, i assumed you were saying that the mplayer guys are saying that alsa itself is buggy :)
2005-05-02T06:22:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	what I said.
2005-05-02T06:24:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	i know, but if i installed an sdl version that uses alsa, it shouldn't matter that some legacy app is using /dev/dsp
2005-05-02T06:25:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	it does matter.
2005-05-02T06:25:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	afaik, alsa will simply mix /dev/dsp along with every other channel.
2005-05-02T06:26:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	i know what is it, i just assumed that a process using /dev/dsp doesn't mean that you can't use alsa directly at the same time.
2005-05-02T06:28:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	yes.
2005-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	weeird. ok. thanks for the correction.
2005-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	we've been through that, i know :) i just assumed it emulated it and simply treated it as just one sound channel it needs to mix with the rest.
2005-05-02T06:30:00.000Z	Choubaka	Nostromo^	a proper sound card will do hardware mixing
2005-05-02T06:30:00.000Z	Nostromo^	Choubaka	yes i know that, but that's driver-level. alsa can do software mixing as well.
