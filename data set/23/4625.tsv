2007-06-22T09:26:00.000Z	GeekMaster1		Wa wondering which was my IP address... inet addr orbcast?
2007-06-22T09:27:00.000Z	GeekMaster1		Anyone?
2007-06-22T09:28:00.000Z	GeekMaster1		Does anyone know which one my IP address is? INET ADDR or BCAST?

2007-06-22T09:30:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	not enough info.
2007-06-22T09:31:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	ubuntu doesn't seem to ship with "man sockets", so do a google search for that
2007-06-22T09:31:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	I'm trying to figure out my IP address so I type "ifconfig eth0 | grep inet" and i get "inet addr" and "bcast"
2007-06-22T09:32:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	hold on a sec...
2007-06-22T09:33:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	ok
2007-06-22T09:34:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	OK, are you on some uni or work network?
2007-06-22T09:34:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	i'm on a college campus, yes
2007-06-22T09:36:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	you there?
2007-06-22T09:36:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	Thank you. Do you know how to figure out my subnet? eg: 192.168.(something).(something)?
2007-06-22T09:38:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	which one? My inet addr and bcast are two different values. Which one is my subnet mask?
2007-06-22T09:39:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	I'm here
2007-06-22T09:40:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	I'm using a tutorial to get my LAN working on VirtualBox. Does'nt the luink you give me show me my EXTERNAL IP address? Shouldn't I be using my internal IP address for the tutorial? The tutorial tells me to"Next, you need to replace <vbox_ip> with an IP that is within your subnet." Use the BCAST for that?
2007-06-22T09:42:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	I don't know this VirtualBox, but your comp's address *within* your subnet is almost certainly the "inet addr"
2007-06-22T09:43:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	so if the tutorial says "Next, you need to replace <vbox_ip> with an IP that is within your subnet. It doesn't matter what it is, I use 192.168.1.161" and my BCAST says 10.100.678.987, use 10.100.168.(anything)?
2007-06-22T09:44:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	yea that link was for the external network address. the WAN side.
2007-06-22T09:47:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	did that help? I hope you get it figured out. You should check out:   insecure.org   to learn more about IP address..
2007-06-22T09:52:00.000Z	GeekMaster1	mongolai	you sure "BCAST" is my subnet mask?
2007-06-22T09:53:00.000Z	mongolai	GeekMaster1	no. that's your gateway. "Mask:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" is your subnet mask.
