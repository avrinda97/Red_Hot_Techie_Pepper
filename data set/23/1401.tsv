2011-03-26T14:27:00.000Z	creat0r		I have a Static Ip address and Ubuntu server, how can i give my static ip a name?
2011-03-26T14:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	a name to other systems or just to yourself?
2011-03-26T14:28:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	i have 3 systems, mail server and web server and download and upload server
2011-03-26T14:29:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	i need to create domin and sub domain for each
2011-03-26T14:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	that can be setup with a domain server from wan like http://www.everydns.com
2011-03-26T14:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	I guess from inside you need to setup you router to manage your port forwarding,  you can also use bind9 to handle access for your internal lan network resolveing
2011-03-26T15:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	is your wan address static also?
2011-03-26T15:58:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	yes i have static ip
2011-03-26T15:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	you don't use a adsl box or you have a contract with your ISP for this?
2011-03-26T16:02:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	we have a contract with vodafone they give us about 19 static ip address
2011-03-26T16:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	ok then the only problem I see is you need two different dns one for the wan side and the other for inside,  I use bind9 for my internal network and everydns.com for outside.
2011-03-26T16:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	but since you have a static ip I guess you could be your own dns server for both sides but the problem I see is the the ip are still different
2011-03-26T16:05:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	what ip u mean are different ?
2011-03-26T16:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	oh I assumed you still went through a nat on your internal network from what I saw in the link but maybe you don't?
2011-03-26T16:08:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	No i don't
2011-03-26T16:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	ok cool then we can setup your bind9 as your internal and external dns
2011-03-26T16:08:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	how i tried couple how to but no way
2011-03-26T16:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	that link looked good I'm not sure what your problem might be, did you assign your registry to the dns?
2011-03-26T16:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	was the problem you have on the internal network or external?
2011-03-26T16:15:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	my ip address already has a host name
2011-03-26T16:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	if each of your ip already have a hostname then it seems your almost done.  as my system I just setup so that *.mydomain.com is always the same ip won't that work?
2011-03-26T16:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	creat0r	oh I think I remember you want this.domaon.com got to ip1  and that.domain.com goto ip2 ...
2011-03-26T16:37:00.000Z	creat0r	sacarlson	 I want to browse mydomain.com instead of http://ipaddress. which mean when you browse mydomain.com redirect you to my server's ip address
