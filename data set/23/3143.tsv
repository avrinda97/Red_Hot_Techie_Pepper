2009-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	banisterfiend		hey guys, im going away for a while and i want to setup this box so i cant ssh to it and use it. How do i do that?
2009-10-29T14:30:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	remove sshd :)
2009-10-29T14:30:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	im a bit of a noob when it comes to this kind of thing...how do i go about configuring my system so i can do that?
2009-10-29T14:31:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	sudo aptitude install openssh-server
2009-10-29T14:31:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	if your box is behind a router, make sure portforwarding to port22 (default) is set up
2009-10-29T14:32:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	ok thanks, it's installing now...can i get you to ssh to it to check if it's working? (or tell me how i check itmyself)
2009-10-29T14:33:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	better check yourself, ssh -l user host
2009-10-29T14:33:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	never give anyone you don't know ssh-access to your boxes
2009-10-29T14:33:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	but will that let me check whether or not that router thingy is blocking something?
2009-10-29T14:34:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	do i have to do anything else once ive installed open-ssh  or will everything just 'work' ? :)
2009-10-29T14:34:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	user external IP for testing, needs nat-loopback enabled in router
2009-10-29T14:34:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	default sshd-config  should be fine for 1st tests
2009-10-29T14:35:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	ok the aptitutde install is complete. what's next? :)
2009-10-29T14:35:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2009-10-29T14:36:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	better check yourself, ssh -l user your-external-host-ip
2009-10-29T14:38:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	ok, cool it seems to work. :) But my system at the other system is windows, what's the best way to connect to it from windows?
2009-10-29T14:38:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	use putty, windows ssh-client
2009-10-29T14:39:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	cool. So so long as i dont restart my computer now, i will be able to connect to it from my other windows system?
2009-10-29T14:39:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	even after reboot you should be able to. sshd should be startet at boottime
2009-10-29T14:40:00.000Z	banisterfiend	llutz	that's cool. Is it safe to have the server running all the time though? can't someone hack it
2009-10-29T14:41:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	ssh is pretty safe, but make sure to use keys for authentication or at least good paswords
2009-10-29T14:41:00.000Z	llutz		pass
2009-10-29T14:41:00.000Z	llutz	banisterfiend	"ilovemon" isn't a good one :)
