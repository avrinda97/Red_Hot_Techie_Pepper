2005-07-29T07:24:00.000Z	Crembo		hey all! I've just downloaded and burned the Ubuntu combo installer+live+large fries DVD. after booting with it, how do I select which route to take? (currently, I'm a windows user with zero linux knowledge).
2005-07-29T07:25:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	which route?
2005-07-29T07:25:00.000Z	Crembo		Live CD.
2005-07-29T07:26:00.000Z	Crembo		I've been searching around the forums and documentation to figure out the exact series of steps I need to take in order to dual-boot with my XP. unfortunately, all I've come across so far was jumbled, not quite clear and/or conflicting.
2005-07-29T07:26:00.000Z	Crembo		at least they were all reassuringly titled "I tried this and it works perfectly!"
2005-07-29T07:26:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	Do you mean how you can boot the livecd?
2005-07-29T07:27:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	Sorry, never mind.
2005-07-29T07:27:00.000Z	Crembo	pcharky	yes. bob2: are you quite certain? I have a fairly unique setup in that there are already two partitions standing ready on my primary slave. I'm not even sure if they're primary or logical ones.
2005-07-29T07:28:00.000Z	Crembo		the thing that made me uneasy was reading - repeatedly - that installing a linux bootloader where it belongs (the MBR) will royally bad_word my windows install.
2005-07-29T07:29:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	You can boot windows from grub.
2005-07-29T07:29:00.000Z	Crembo		hoary does all that automatically during install?
2005-07-29T07:29:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	Yup.
2005-07-29T07:29:00.000Z	Crembo		I got the impression from the forums and wiki you had to do a complex series of steps to get it to work.
2005-07-29T07:30:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	SO you want to install ubuntu.. right?
2005-07-29T07:30:00.000Z	Crembo		as a matter of fact, this is the page that got me started on my journey: https://wiki.ubuntu.com//WindowsDualBootHowTo
2005-07-29T07:31:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	Because you started out asking a question about the livecd.
2005-07-29T07:31:00.000Z	Crembo	pcharky	trying to learn linux, as part of the "onoes Longhorn DRM MS sucks better bail" bandwagon. not noble, but hey, it's something to tinker with in my free time.
2005-07-29T07:31:00.000Z	Crembo		I was going to mess around with the live CD version first, to get a hang for it. then once I feel comfortable I could put it on my drive and test UT2k4 on it.
2005-07-29T07:31:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	It doesn't get much nobler than linux...
2005-07-29T07:32:00.000Z	Crembo	pcharky	the nobility inferred is that of the reason for switching. I actually like microsoft. their commitment to hebrew can't be beat.
2005-07-29T07:33:00.000Z	Crembo		that is exactly what I wanted to hear. time to dive in head first.
2005-07-29T07:33:00.000Z	pcharky	Crembo	you could sign up as a translator ;-)
2005-07-29T07:34:00.000Z	Crembo	pcharky	I'm not sure I'd have the time. being in the army, I don't see home very often :/
