2012-08-14T13:19:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	Is 'libglib2.0-dev' installed?
2012-08-14T13:21:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	That's the package that contains, for example, the declaration of g_hash_table_new_full() ... so I'd be looking at the results on ./configure to check which libraries it found. Look especially at the config.log
2012-08-14T13:22:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	I'll try here; what's the git repo?
2012-08-14T13:25:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	Are you building on 64-bit?
2012-08-14T13:28:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	I've added the x86_64 bit include path, and just installed libpcap0.8-dev .. getting closer ;)
2012-08-14T13:28:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	OK, I am now reproducing your exact errors
2012-08-14T13:39:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	Strange!
2012-08-14T13:39:00.000Z	sfjgk	TJ-	just out of interest, did you have to change the location of glib in the makefile? I had issues last night where the glib location on the makefile wasn't what it was on the filesystem
2012-08-14T13:39:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	No ... so far all I've done is add the 64-bit include path to CFLAGS: -I/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include
2012-08-14T13:40:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	We've got a linker error but the symbols we know should be in libglib-2.0.so
2012-08-14T13:42:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	Yes, that's a result of Debian/Ubuntu switching to Multi-arch
2012-08-14T13:42:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	I've checked that symbol: objdump -T /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0 | grep g_hash_table_size
2012-08-14T13:43:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	This is problem with 'ld' not knowing the libraries - has to be
2012-08-14T13:49:00.000Z	sfjgk	TJ-	Would ld be looking at $LD_LIBRARY_PATH at compile time?
2012-08-14T13:49:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	no, that's for executables to find additional libraries
2012-08-14T14:01:00.000Z	sfjgk	TJ-	if the issue is with ld, could I theoretically put -L/where/libs/are and it would see them?
2012-08-14T14:01:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	I think it's more fundamental than that from what I'm seeing here. I tried that just in case but it didn't work
2012-08-14T14:03:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	I think I have it
2012-08-14T14:04:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	need to check and test... it appears its not finding the correct sonames
2012-08-15T02:02:00.000Z	sfjgk	TJ-	earliers gcc fun, what was the way you described the problem? (/me is writing up a page on getting the tools working for the other users at the uni)
2012-08-15T02:07:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	I had a link for you
2012-08-15T02:08:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricOcelot/ReleaseNotes#GCC_4.6_Toolchain  and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ToolchainTransition
2012-08-15T02:15:00.000Z	TJ-	sfjgk	That looks great; keep at it!
