2009-02-09T02:08:00.000Z	benjamin_		I'm having major issues installing Ubuntu Server x64 on my pc
2009-02-09T02:09:00.000Z	benjamin_		i keep going through a Debootstrap warning
2009-02-09T02:09:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	 Are you trying to install actual 64bit version of Ubuntu or just the normal version on a 64bit processor?
2009-02-09T02:10:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	If at all possible I would recommend the 32bit version.
2009-02-09T02:11:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	Are you planning on giving the virtual machine more than 4GB of memory?
2009-02-09T02:11:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	 Even if you do are you planning on running a single process that needs more than 2GB of memory?
2009-02-09T02:12:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	 Ill download it now, but what do I do about this version that won't work
2009-02-09T02:13:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	 Sorry I got kicked off.  Did you respond?
2009-02-09T02:13:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	 Didn't VirtualBox just add 64bit support?  Are you running that version?
2009-02-09T02:15:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	I'd double check that.  If so I have not idea.  I just know the 32bit will work MUCH better in a lot of respects.  Linux is better than Windows with 64bit but the world is just not ready.
2009-02-09T02:16:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	It will use less memory too since 32bit code is smaller than 64bit
2009-02-09T02:16:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	I always do.  Makes it easier to try everything out.
2009-02-09T02:19:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	So far so good.   Thanks for your help!
2009-02-09T02:22:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	That didn't work
2009-02-09T02:22:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	Where did it stop this time?
2009-02-09T02:23:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	I'd try it myself but I'm running on a tin can and a few light bulbs for memory right now so I can't.
2009-02-09T02:24:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	Thats fine.  I could have made a copy of x64 again
2009-02-09T02:24:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	Are you running virtualbox?
2009-02-09T02:25:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	 I run it normally but right now I've had a driver failure and I'm running off a hacked live USB on an old machine.
2009-02-09T02:25:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	Drive failure rather.
2009-02-09T02:26:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	Do you remember what your "General Settings" were?
2009-02-09T02:26:00.000Z	Grok4242	benjamin_	 Sorry...been a while since I looked
2009-02-09T02:27:00.000Z	benjamin_	Grok4242	Thats fine... Thanks for your help
