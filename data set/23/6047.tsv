2006-07-14T09:47:00.000Z	azureal		hi, what's the command to list all your /dev devices?
2006-07-14T09:48:00.000Z	azureal		it's not lsusb... but i think it's something similar
2006-07-14T09:49:00.000Z	azureal		hmm... lsdev doesnt work
2006-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	azureal		yes, no such command
2006-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	lspci ;)
2006-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	eh, that's not the pretty output
2006-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	"pretty" output?
2006-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	lspci -vv ;)
2006-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	eyequeue: so you guys have an idea for what I'm looking for?
2006-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	I sure don't.
2006-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	mainly because I don't know what you asked.
2006-07-14T09:59:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	i want the output to show all the /dev/sd* devices
2006-07-14T09:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	what are you trying to do?
2006-07-14T10:00:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	for now, see where this usb device is connected to...but i also want to remember that command =/
2006-07-14T10:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	try usbview if its a usb device.
2006-07-14T10:05:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	so how do i know where it's connected to
2006-07-14T10:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	one way is to tail -f /var/log/messages, unplug the device, plug it in, and watch the kernel messages.
2006-07-18T14:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	log out and login
2006-07-18T14:14:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	it's weird because the debian change is instant
2006-07-18T14:15:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	after editing sudoers you yourself don't have to log out/in, do you?
2006-08-10T13:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	you need an alias. links are for files and directories only
2006-08-10T13:37:00.000Z	azureal	fyrestrtr	i can't make a link to a prog w/ a switch?
2006-08-10T13:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azureal	you make an alias for commands, not links. Links are for files and directories only.
