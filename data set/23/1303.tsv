2010-10-25T02:07:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	oly562 ok guys, will try synaptic then
2010-10-25T02:29:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	oly562 i already installed ruby1.9.1 using Synaptic, same thing: The program 'ruby' is currently not installed.
2010-10-25T02:49:00.000Z	ikonia	balr0g	type "ruby in a shell and hit tab a few times, no space eg: ruby<tab>
2010-10-25T02:50:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	i see, i think is installed with another name, this version
2010-10-25T02:50:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	it seems working with a new name
2010-10-25T02:51:00.000Z	ikonia	balr0g	what name
2010-10-25T02:51:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	thanks jeje
2010-10-25T02:51:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	it is working with ruby1.9.1 not ruby as before
2010-10-25T02:51:00.000Z	ikonia	balr0g	ok, so your missing a symlink, it's normally ln -s ruby1.9.1 /usr/bin/ruby
2010-10-25T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	balr0g	that symlink should have been setup at package install
2010-10-25T02:52:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	i dont understand what happened on installation...
2010-10-25T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	balr0g	I can't explain that as I didn't follow your install, but put a symlink from ruby1.9.1 to ruby and it will be fine
2010-10-25T02:54:00.000Z	balr0g	ikonia	tks, i already did the symlink, working now
2010-10-25T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	balr0g	nice job, well done
