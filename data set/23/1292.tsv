2010-05-27T10:29:00.000Z	bblum		ok, hey guys, having a bit of trouble here
2010-05-27T10:31:00.000Z	bblum		i'm trying to reverse a manual update of libxcb, since now many apps are failing to find a certain symbol in libxcb-xlib.so, but i've made the library so that it has the symbol i need (and verified by comparing with somebody else's library), but various programs are still failing with the undefined symbol error
2010-05-27T10:31:00.000Z	bblum		and i can't think of where else the problem could be
2010-05-27T10:31:00.000Z	bblum		anybody have any ideas?
2010-05-27T10:33:00.000Z	Loshki	bblum	if you run ldd on one of the applications, does it show that it's using the correct library?
2010-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	i'm not sure what i'm looking for in the output there...?
2010-05-27T10:35:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	http://pastebin.com/UfYnDzRy
2010-05-27T10:36:00.000Z	Loshki	bblum	see line 17? That says this app is using this library at run time: /usr/lib/libxcb-xlib.so.0. Is this the one you built?
2010-05-27T10:38:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	Yes, but I tried reinstalling it with 'aptitude reinstall' - and I also copied a friend's libxcb-xlib and compared it to mine to make sure i had restored it properly
2010-05-27T10:38:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	furthermore, using grep on the undefined symbol on that archive shows that it's present in there
2010-05-27T10:38:00.000Z	Loshki	bblum	and you've rebooted since doing so? To clear any caches...
2010-05-27T10:39:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	I'm afraid to reboot, because if I do and the problem isn't really solved, then i won't be able to use X... is there a way to check for such caches before rebooting?
2010-05-27T10:42:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	a quick google suggests ldconfig, but i see no way suggested tjhere to actually clear this cache. what i do?
2010-05-27T10:42:00.000Z	Loshki	bblum	sorry, I'm not sure. You're right at the edge of my knowledge on this subject...
2010-05-27T10:43:00.000Z	Loshki	bblum	the man page for ldconfig says: /sbin/ldconfig -v will set up the correct links for the shared binaries and  rebuild  the cache...
2010-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	tried that and I also tried the other recommended command; neither worked
2010-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	Do you have any other ideas?
2010-05-27T10:54:00.000Z	Loshki	bblum	can you paste the output of a command when it fails?
2010-05-27T10:54:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	sure
2010-05-27T10:55:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	urxvt: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxcb-xlib.so.0: undefined symbol: _xcb_lock_io
2010-05-27T10:55:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	I've reinstalled both urxvt and libxcb
2010-05-27T10:57:00.000Z	Loshki	bblum	sorry, I'm out of ideas...
2010-05-27T11:01:00.000Z	bblum	Loshki	thanks for the help
