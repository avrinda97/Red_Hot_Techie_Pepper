2011-12-27T13:16:00.000Z	Raliegh		Hello, I'm having some more compilation errors. I've Googled around and it said to install the dev version of gstreamer, and I did... But I'm still getting this error: checking whether pkg-config knows about gstreamer-app-0.10... configure: error: gstreamer-app-0.10.pc not found.. Do you need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH?" This is when trying "./configure" as a user.
2011-12-27T13:16:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	I think you should install some gstreamer's header
2011-12-27T13:17:00.000Z	Raliegh	Stanley00	I've no idea what that is, heh.
2011-12-27T13:18:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	not sure, but I think you should run "sudo apt-get install libgstreamer0.10-dev -" first
2011-12-27T13:19:00.000Z	Raliegh	Stanley00	I've already done that.
2011-12-27T13:20:00.000Z	Raliegh	Stanley00	is there anything I'm supposed to do AFTER that?
2011-12-27T13:20:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	then, you should search the web for that error, I cant do a web search here, sorry
2011-12-27T13:23:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	what prog are you trying to install?
2011-12-27T13:23:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	why dont you use the one in Ubuntu Software Center?
2011-12-27T13:24:00.000Z	Raliegh	Stanley00	because that gives the dependency errors even though I've manually installed all of them.
2011-12-27T13:25:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	hmm, just tesst install that app, work fine,
2011-12-27T13:26:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	maybe you should change your repo to main server
2011-12-27T13:26:00.000Z	Raliegh	Stanley00	I do believe it is. Think you could possibly just upload your sources.list for me?
2011-12-27T13:27:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	just a min, let me see
2011-12-27T13:28:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	here it is
2011-12-27T13:28:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	http://pastebin.com/HeL2hKmN
2011-12-27T13:29:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	I use the repos of vietnam group, not an official repo...
2011-12-27T13:33:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	haha, it work fine for me, since I'm living in Vietnam... ;)
2011-12-27T13:37:00.000Z	Raliegh	Stanley00	okay, I can't use this. If it's taking this long just to load the list who knows how long it will take to actually download a file. :/
2011-12-27T13:37:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	liquidsoap takes less than 10Mb, so if you dont want, you can use the main repos :D
2011-12-27T13:39:00.000Z	Raliegh	Stanley00	I must have had a conflicting repo, because I made a blank sources.list, added that one repository, and all is well now. :D
2011-12-27T13:39:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	:D
2011-12-27T13:50:00.000Z	Stanley00	Raliegh	haha, all just because of the sources.list? :))
