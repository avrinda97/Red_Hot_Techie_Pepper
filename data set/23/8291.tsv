2005-03-27T07:04:00.000Z	gilles		is it possible to enable CONFIG_FB_RADEON and CONFIG_FB_RADEON_I2C in the kernel (or is it already unabled by default with hoary?) ?
2005-03-27T07:05:00.000Z	mjr	gilles	at least on my Hoary/amd64 kernel CONFIG_FB_RADEON is compiled as a module
2005-03-27T07:05:00.000Z	mjr	gilles	you can get kernel package configs from /boot
2005-03-27T07:06:00.000Z	gilles	mjr	from /boot ? in synaptics ?
2005-03-27T07:06:00.000Z	mjr	gilles	from the file system
2005-03-27T07:06:00.000Z	gilles	mjr	can i compile it with assistant-module ?
2005-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	mjr		I have no idea what you're talking abou tnow
2005-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	mjr		ah, module-assistant
2005-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	gilles		sorry, with the command module-assistant
2005-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	gilles		yes
2005-03-27T07:07:00.000Z	mjr		no no, it comes standard, as a module, in the linux-image package
2005-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	gilles	mjr	so what should i do ?
2005-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	gilles	mjr	i have the new hoary
2005-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	mjr	gilles	I don't know what you're trying to accomplish
2005-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	mjr		you just asked if the FB_RADEON thing was enabled, I said that it is, as a module
2005-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	gilles	mjr	i'm trying to have the boot screen in 1280x800
2005-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	mjr		and told you that the info can be found in /boot (spesifically, /boot/config-[version] 
2005-03-27T07:10:00.000Z	mjr		Ah. Well, for that, you might have to roll it in the kernel. I don't know spesifics about that.
2005-03-27T07:10:00.000Z	mjr		(having fancy boot screen resolutions; of course, compiling it into the kernel is relatively straightforward)
2005-03-27T07:12:00.000Z	gilles	mjr	so a novice like me can't do that with assisant-module for example ?
2005-03-27T07:12:00.000Z	gilles		module-assistant
2005-03-27T07:12:00.000Z	mjr	gilles	that's not the right tool for the job; kernel-package is
2005-03-27T07:12:00.000Z	mjr	gilles	but I wouldn't recommend it for a self-described novice
