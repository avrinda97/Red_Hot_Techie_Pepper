2006-04-03T15:14:00.000Z	heroin		is there a way to upgrade openoffice1.x to 2.x or should i remove and install it?
2006-04-03T15:16:00.000Z	heroin		so just apt-get 2 and hope its overrides 1?
2006-04-03T15:18:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	OOo 1 and 2 coexist peacefully in breezy.
2006-04-03T15:19:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	i just want 2 :)
2006-04-03T15:20:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	I second doubletwist
2006-04-03T15:20:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	and doubletwist thank you for your wisdom :)
2007-05-08T10:08:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	i dont know how to see msg iam using irssi
2007-05-22T13:30:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	one partition at a time, with 'sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt' with /dev/hda1 being the partition device name
2007-06-19T10:11:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	do you want to see what filesystem is on a partition, or whether it is corrupted?
2007-06-19T10:12:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	what type it is
2007-06-19T10:13:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	because i have a harddrive but i dont think its ntfs or vfat or ext*
2007-06-19T10:14:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda
2007-06-19T10:15:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	SFS file system...
2007-06-19T10:15:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	 u know if linux can write to sfs?
2007-06-19T10:16:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	I don't think it can
2007-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	can you try mounting it with -t ntfs pls
2007-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	i have it mounted w. ntfs but that disables me from writing to it.. so i want to use ntfs-3f
2007-06-19T10:25:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	that pretty much clarifies that you don't have a SFS filesystem. It's just labelled as such.
2007-06-19T10:25:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	have you used ntfs-3g before?
2007-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	yesterday at a friends house
2007-06-19T10:27:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	i mounted a NTFS harddisk for him using ntfs-3g
2007-06-19T10:27:00.000Z	soundray	heroin	so do the same to your pseudo-SFS now.
2007-06-19T10:27:00.000Z	heroin	soundray	yah that is what iam going to do now, i was just confused about the SFS
