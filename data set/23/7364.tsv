2005-10-11T08:46:00.000Z	ProN00b		does anyone know how to do transparent (non-clickable) output of text (logs and stuff) on the desktop ?
2005-10-11T08:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	tricky in gnome because nautilus draws the desktop
2005-10-11T08:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	depends - quick and dirty way is with checkinstall
2005-10-11T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	warning - roottail won't show on a standard gnome desktop
2005-10-11T09:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	it draws on the root window, which gnome hides - it works in window managers like fluxbox
2005-10-11T09:05:00.000Z	ProN00b	thoreauputic	so i can't just change some gnome setting ?
2005-10-11T09:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	there's probably a way to do it in gnome, but how I don't personally know
2005-10-11T09:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	I would read "man root-tail " first - there are a lot of options. I don't use it any more because I cn get the same effect in fluxbox by toggling window borders off
2005-11-04T15:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	graveman
2005-11-04T15:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	yes, known bug
2005-11-04T15:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	try setting synaptic to not do daily updates automatically
2005-11-04T15:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	no, you misundestood me - I mean if you diable automatic updates in synaptic it cures the problem with apt-cache
2005-11-04T15:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	I also use apt-get  /apt-cache - but it appears synaptic runs a daily cron and if you aren't connected it failsd
2005-11-04T15:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	from memory you go into the repository settings and find the options
2005-11-04T15:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	yup
2005-11-04T15:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	I just unchecked it
2005-11-04T15:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	no guarantees - but seemed to fix it here
2005-11-04T15:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	*cough8
2005-11-04T15:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	we don't encourage running as root here ;)
2005-11-04T16:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	sure - install streamtuner and you'll have access to shoutcast
2005-11-04T16:48:00.000Z	ProN00b	thoreauputic	only its audio streams, not the video ones...
2005-11-04T16:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	ah, video I don't know...
2006-10-29T09:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ProN00b	ubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage
