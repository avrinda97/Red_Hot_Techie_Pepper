2010-08-29T07:43:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	my laptop has internet, desktop doesn't
2010-08-29T07:44:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	ic
2010-08-29T07:48:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	pastebinit not installed, but: http://paste.ubuntu.com/485242/
2010-08-29T07:51:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	169.254.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.0.0 U 1000 0 0 eth0  is  a sign for a failed dhcp, is where the route interrupts
2010-08-29T07:53:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	i see... i had changed that file to make my computer static ip, but it's been working for ages, then mysteriously stopped. i was using vpnc yesterday, but that couldn't hurt could it?
2010-08-29T07:54:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	the address of eth0 seems right, connection to the router also, so it might be an mac/arp issue with the router then, restart router if it works on another line
2010-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	i have restarted the router, but problem is still there :(
2010-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	trying again now, stand by
2010-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	and another pc on the same is working ?
2010-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	yep, on my laptop with same router now
2010-08-29T07:56:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	actually i won't restart the router unless you think it's worth trying it again (save disconnecting from irc)
2010-08-29T07:57:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	if you tried already, next would be firewall / hosts.deny (external isp router ??)
2010-08-29T07:57:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	sorry, i don't really understand what you mean. my other computers are accessing the internet fine, and this one was until today. what should i try in regards to that?
2010-08-29T07:58:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	pastebinit /etc/hosts.deny  , is there a firewall installed ?
2010-08-29T07:59:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	pastebinit /etc/resolv.conf
2010-08-29T08:01:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/485245/
2010-08-29T08:01:00.000Z	nesbitt	DasEi	cat /etc/resolve.conf: "Generated by NetworkManager" and that's it
2010-08-29T08:06:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	nameserver 192.168.1.1       << put this in /etc/resolv.conf, this is no server nedding a domain ?
2010-08-29T08:12:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	:)
2010-08-29T08:16:00.000Z	DasEi	nesbitt	we never help each other out, hehe, nvm
