2004-12-14T09:32:00.000Z	vigilanty		what's significant about there being no nvidia in 2.6.9 yet?
2004-12-14T09:33:00.000Z	vigilanty		still hangs...

2004-12-14T09:35:00.000Z	vigilanty		found it.
2004-12-14T09:35:00.000Z	vigilanty		no
2004-12-14T09:35:00.000Z	vigilanty		i found somethin else...
2004-12-14T09:35:00.000Z	vigilanty		it may work...
2004-12-14T09:35:00.000Z	vigilanty		special boot parameters - installation system page
2004-12-14T09:36:00.000Z	vigilanty		didn't try it yet.
2004-12-14T09:36:00.000Z	vigilanty		stumbled upon this.
2004-12-14T09:36:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	okay, give it a shot, it will probably work with acpi=off
2004-12-14T09:23:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	acpi is the standard used for things like sleep mode (aka ACPI S3), suspend to disk (hibernate or ACPI S4), and events from your computer, such as hitting the power button, temperature readout, closing the lid of your laptop, etc.
2004-12-14T09:24:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	sorry, what's the problem
2004-12-14T09:26:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	well, you can disable ACPI as a kernel parameter... not sure if you can do that with the boot cd
2004-12-14T09:28:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	see how you can pass kernel parameters, and then pci=noacpi will disable acpi
2004-12-14T09:28:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	is your PC a laptop?
2004-12-14T09:30:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	okay, I'll find you the line you need to type at boot:... there is a boot: prompt right?
2004-12-14T09:30:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	okay, let me be a google ninja for a second
2004-12-14T09:32:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	boot back off the CD, when boot: comes up type "linux pci=noacpi"
2004-12-14T09:35:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	works?
2004-12-14T09:36:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	so acpi=off didn't work?
2004-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	don't delete it if you have important files there :)
2004-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	vigilanty	plus, you may be a little frustrated with linux support if your ACPI is broken...
