2010-09-06T20:15:00.000Z	rblst		anybody here who can help me using my logitech cam with skype in 10.04?
2010-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	have you cheese installed?
2010-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	yes
2010-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	does your webcam work with cheese?
2010-09-06T20:17:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	it captures the input, yes, but CPU is up to 100%, so it is practically useless
2010-09-06T20:18:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	did you try to run cheese on terminal to see if you get any strange output?
2010-09-06T20:19:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	i get some warnings and an error
2010-09-06T20:21:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	and if you run skype on terminal, do you get similar error?
2010-09-06T20:21:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	no
2010-09-06T20:21:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	this is what i get with cheese: http://paste.ubuntu.com/489302/
2010-09-06T20:23:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	do you know what is that file cheese tries to open?
2010-09-06T20:28:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	it seems an ogg video, i don't know why it wants to open that, the Reason translates as: the data stream does not contain any data
2010-09-06T20:31:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	i've deleted all items, now cheese does not give any output in terminal
2010-09-06T20:31:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	and does it consume too much cpu?
2010-09-06T20:31:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	yes
2010-09-06T20:32:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	around 90%
2010-09-06T20:32:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	so no error nor warning but still consuming too much cpu?
2010-09-06T20:32:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	exaclty
2010-09-06T20:32:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	mmmhh
2010-09-06T20:32:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	and what about skype output?
2010-09-06T20:33:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	skype produces no text output
2010-09-06T20:34:00.000Z	cedriczg	rblst	do you have any propietary driver for your video installed?
2010-09-06T20:36:00.000Z	rblst	cedriczg	i have absolutely no proprietary drivers
