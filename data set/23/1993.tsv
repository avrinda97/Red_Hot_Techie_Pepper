2012-03-23T00:30:00.000Z	TheSimkin	ikonia	kinda hard to do when you can't boot.
2012-03-23T00:29:00.000Z	TheSimkin	ikonia	not from my experiences.. drive fails.. reboot some days later.. grub failures.
2012-03-23T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	when you replace the drive and rebuild the array, you need to update grub,
2012-03-23T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	it's not a good config, but it is the reality.
2012-03-23T00:27:00.000Z	TheSimkin	ikonia	but why
2012-03-23T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	caters for a lot of options
2012-03-23T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	what type of raid ?
2012-03-23T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	it does cater for a lot of setups
2012-03-23T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	hardware/software/fakeraid
2012-03-23T00:29:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	works fine with mdadm created raid 1
2012-03-23T00:30:00.000Z	TheSimkin	ikonia	i had to do all kinds of stuff to get it working, it was a real pain.
2012-03-23T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	you can boot on a raid1 failure, it's a mirror, your drive can fail and you should have no problems
2012-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	then you didn't mark the drive as failed properly.
2012-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	(from experience that is a common reason to have that problem)
2012-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	did you mark it as failed in mdadm ?
2012-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	you still have to mark it as failed
2012-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	/proc/mdstat shows it as failed, you use mdadm to mark it as failed.
2012-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	that way it changes the status of the array for the next boot
2012-03-23T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	well, I suspect that's why you're having problems
2012-03-23T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	then you may/may not have problems, it depends
2012-03-23T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	that's because you are not managing the software raid arrays correctly.
2012-03-23T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	if you manage it cleanly, you'll have a very smooth ride
2012-03-23T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	TheSimkin	worth keeping in the back of your mind for future use
