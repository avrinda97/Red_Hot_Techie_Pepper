2006-07-19T11:25:00.000Z	RawSewage		Is anyone typing an answer to my question, or am I wasting my time as usual
2006-07-19T11:25:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	RawSewage	I just sat down, but I suggest patience.
2006-07-19T11:26:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	I dont think anyone knows the answer. its an obscure question
2006-07-19T11:26:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	RawSewage	Rebooted the comp yet?
2006-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	I restarted X
2006-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	RawSewage		I'll reboot
2006-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	RawSewage		Thanks
2006-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		just to be sure, I would too.
2006-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	RawSewage		ok
2006-07-19T11:31:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	I rebooted.  no luck
2006-07-19T11:32:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		Are you trying to add in files you programmed or the package?
2006-07-19T11:32:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	hmm...  could be a permissions thing
2006-07-19T11:32:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	I'll try that
2006-07-19T11:33:00.000Z	RawSewage		I have a folder of ny files I downloaded
2006-07-19T11:33:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		2.29-6 is a package already. just sudo apt-get nyquit if you're trying to get the package
2006-07-19T11:33:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		err nyquist
2006-07-19T11:33:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	I dont think thats the same
2006-07-19T11:33:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	Audacity has a built-in thing
2006-07-19T11:34:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		Nyquist is a sound synthesis and composition language based on a Lisp syntax. Nyquist is an elegant and powerful system based on functional programming.
2006-07-19T11:35:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	Audacity has a built in  Nyquist thing.  It already comes with 6
2006-07-19T11:35:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	but I'll install that nyquist anyway, and try it
2006-07-19T11:35:00.000Z	RawSewage		I know this wont work though
2006-07-19T11:39:00.000Z	RawSewage	Corporal_Dirge	oh well, thanks for trying.  I'll have to do some more Google research I guess
