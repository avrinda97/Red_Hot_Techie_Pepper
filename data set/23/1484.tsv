2010-04-16T22:51:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	just for info, which way would you choose?
2010-04-16T22:53:00.000Z	Losha	zaxonspox	well, there's nothing significant between them in terms of performance, so it depends if the existing partition is easily expandable or not, or if there's room to add a new one. If not, then a swapfile is the way to go...
2010-04-17T00:17:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	is it an toaster oven image? :P
2010-04-17T01:21:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	yes, why?
2010-04-17T01:25:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	yes, i am staing on 9.04 because Canonical took away some features
2010-04-17T01:26:00.000Z	Losha	zaxonspox	ah, I wondered why you were still on 9.04...
2010-04-20T03:47:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	why 6GB for SWAP?
2010-04-20T03:47:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	"who" will need such a big SWAP? if you want to suspend SWAP should be in size of RAM
2010-04-20T03:48:00.000Z	Losha	zaxonspox	I forget. The old guideline was twice the ram for swap, until RAM got so big that that equation didn't really hold any longer. Now the best thing to do is be conservative and monitor swap usage till you know your machine better...
2010-04-20T03:49:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	now your make sens again
2010-04-20T03:57:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	is ubuntu.paste for registered paste/view?
2010-04-20T03:57:00.000Z	Losha	zaxonspox	I'm not sure. But it's a nuisance having to register just to paste things...

2010-04-20T03:59:00.000Z	Losha	zaxonspox	another reason to avoid it. Though it's good to register a nick anyway...

2010-04-20T04:02:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Losha	yes, i gave this link some guy, he paste some code, gave me a link and i was not able to view it - sayed "Register!"
2010-04-20T04:03:00.000Z	Losha	zaxonspox	very annoying. It's because that site changed its policy...
