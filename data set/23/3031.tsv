2008-09-06T18:39:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	adante	: quick n dirty idea would be to take the section from xorg.conf, but will look up nvidia, now
2008-09-06T18:40:00.000Z	adante	ScheissDrogen	seems to me i should be more concerned about the fact i can't modprobe nvidia module before trying to configure x
2008-09-06T18:49:00.000Z	ScheissDrogen	adante	: 32 0r 64 bit ?
