2010-06-22T20:58:00.000Z	hotfloppy		!chown
2010-06-22T20:58:00.000Z	hotfloppy		!chmod
2010-06-22T21:00:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	chmod doesn't work in a chat room :P
2010-06-22T21:04:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	need help regarding chown .. can u help ?
2010-06-22T21:04:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	what is the question?
2010-06-22T21:05:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	do you have remote or usb key plugged in?
2010-06-22T21:06:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	nope..
2010-06-22T21:07:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	.gvfs is the gnome virtual file system, it's for things like remote Shares and Removable drives...
2010-06-22T21:07:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	is the usb modem count ?
2010-06-22T21:07:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	so It would be normal for you to not have permission on a remote machine
2010-06-22T21:08:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	USB modem? unless this is a firmware interface or something.... highly unlikely
2010-06-22T21:09:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	i connect to the internet using this Huawei e176 usb modem..
2010-06-22T21:09:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	it's probalby not that...
2010-06-22T21:11:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	What is in that directory? <- is that for me ? $home.. err.. my home folder (surpised !! :P )
2010-06-22T21:11:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	can you do a "df -h" in a terminal?
2010-06-22T21:14:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	my df -h -> http://paste.ubuntu.com/453453/
2010-06-22T21:15:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	everything seems ok...
2010-06-22T21:16:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	yeap, i thought so.. actually, i just want to know what that .gvfs (is it? forgot already) thing is..
2010-06-22T21:18:00.000Z	ve2dmn	hotfloppy	you could try "chown -R hotfloppy:hotfloppy !(.gvfs)"
2010-06-22T21:21:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	that command solved it.. those folder already mine..
2010-06-22T21:22:00.000Z	hotfloppy	ve2dmn	drizzt_ : but i still dont understand.. what thing is it ?
