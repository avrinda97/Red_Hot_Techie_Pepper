2008-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Which graphics card is this?
2008-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	 Intel Corporation Mobile PM965/GM965/GL960
2008-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	And what does 'glxinfo|grep direct' say?
2008-10-11T08:41:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	says yes
2008-10-11T08:41:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	So the problem is this game crashes?
2008-10-11T08:43:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	yes, or when i click on the SAFE options (reduce 3d and heavy rendering stuff), it is too slow IMO
2008-10-11T08:44:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	sounds like a problem with what the game is demanding and your system (graphics card and driver)
2008-10-11T08:45:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	actually the whole system crashes, not just the game
2008-10-11T08:45:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Yea, that sucks. It may be a problem with the game, your graphics driver version, or both
2008-10-11T08:46:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Ah, running compiz?
2008-10-11T08:46:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Sys>Prefs>Appearance>Visual Effects < None
2008-10-11T08:47:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	yes, i should try without
2008-10-11T08:47:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Yes, first thing
2008-10-11T08:50:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Try something like 'grep -i gart /var/log/Xorg.0.log'
2008-10-11T08:51:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Use metacity, then test the game again
2008-10-11T08:52:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	usser: yeah, i asked just to be sure, as if it crashes again you know....
2008-10-11T09:26:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Which video card works?
2008-10-11T09:26:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Which video in the working laptop
2008-10-11T09:27:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	So ati works and that intel card you have might not work so well
2008-10-11T09:28:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	well yeah it shows it is doable, not a freaking impossible rendering i was asking for.
2008-10-11T09:28:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	heh
2008-10-11T09:31:00.000Z	soreau	mickybadia	Does compiz run ok with that card?
2008-10-11T09:32:00.000Z	mickybadia	soreau	oh yeah, the cube goes well and everything, just some sort of layer bug with the rain thing
