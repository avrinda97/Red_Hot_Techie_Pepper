2009-06-27T02:21:00.000Z	Raptorial		i normally check with Cheese... dassouki
2009-06-27T02:22:00.000Z	Raptorial		i'm formatting my laptop and installing Debian since Jaunty Jackalope sucks donkey balls
2009-06-27T02:22:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	is there some reason you are telling us then?
2009-06-27T02:23:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	yes, don't run a new laptop with 9.04
2009-06-27T02:24:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	then you suggest I reformat mine?
2009-06-27T02:24:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	it's always an option, maybe your graphics card is better supported
2009-06-27T02:25:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	I dont buy hardware unless I look up the linux driver before hand and know for a fact its supported
2009-06-27T02:31:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	what laptop do you have?
2009-06-27T02:32:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	MSI GT627
2009-06-27T02:32:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	I have a gateway p7895U with a 9800M, plays HDTV, run 3d games, and runs quite well
2009-06-27T02:33:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	i almost bought that hoss, it was too heavy :|
2009-06-27T02:33:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	you're running 64 bit Jaunty?
2009-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	yes, and virtual box, and please note I never called it a laptop, its too hot and too heavy
2009-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	my problems started with firefox randomly closing and losing websites
2009-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	altho I run 32 bit, not 64
2009-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	oh maybe 32 bit is the reason
2009-06-27T02:35:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	when i was running 32 bit i didn't have problems, but i was annoyed with my memory going to waste and when using virtual box i wanted to dedicate more... so i tried 64 bit and shit was hitting the fan
2009-06-27T02:38:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	I run 64 bit on 3 servers and 2 desktops, including 2 mythtv frontends to play hdtv, there is nothing wrong with it.  The reason I dont run 64 bit on that laptop is that it is not an amd
2009-06-27T02:39:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	well, my chips are intel and 64 bit
2009-06-27T02:39:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	so maybe there's a communication issue in jaunty 64 bit in regards to the chipset
2009-06-27T02:42:00.000Z	mdm	Raptorial	the servers dont have video cards, of the two desktops one runs sli 260's and the other nvideo 7900s, the two front ends are from server with my own adding X in it and they have a 9800 and a 7900 resectivly
2009-06-27T02:42:00.000Z	Raptorial	mdm	maybe it was something i was doing... now and again when updating i'd have freeze problems as well and i'd have to rescue the broken system
