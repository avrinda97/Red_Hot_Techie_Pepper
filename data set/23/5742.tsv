2006-10-09T12:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Geoffrey2	You might be referring to CodeWeavers' Crossover Office, which lets you use windows plugins seamlessly in your Linux firefox. But this product costs money.
2006-10-09T12:16:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ArrenLex	codeweavers will make Windows Flash 9 work with the LINUX version of Firefox?
2006-10-09T12:17:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ArrenLex	interesting....well, if they're gonna charge for it, they'd better offer a lot more than plain wine does
2006-10-09T12:17:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	ArrenLex	yep
2006-10-15T12:40:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Geoffrey2	I sure can't. o_O
