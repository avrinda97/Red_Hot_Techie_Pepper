2010-01-25T19:25:00.000Z	chilli0		Can I do it with out losing 500 gigs of data ?
2010-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	grawity	chilli0	NO.
2010-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	grawity	chilli0	I think you are looking for "e2label" instead...
2010-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	chilli0	grawity	 Whats that ?
2010-01-25T19:27:00.000Z	grawity	chilli0	It's a program to change the filesystem label of an ext2 partition.
2010-01-25T19:27:00.000Z	chilli0	grawity	 Its not ext2 o=
2010-01-25T19:28:00.000Z	grawity	chilli0	ext[234] are the same in this case.
2010-01-25T19:28:00.000Z	chilli0	grawity	 Its nfs or some windows crap
2010-01-25T19:28:00.000Z	chilli0	grawity	 Anyway to change the mount point name ?
2010-01-25T19:28:00.000Z	grawity	chilli0	NTFS? It's not crap... in any case, 'ntfslabel'
2010-01-25T19:29:00.000Z	chilli0	grawity	 I said some windows crap o/
2010-01-25T19:29:00.000Z	grawity	chilli0	Dude, NTFS is awesome.
2010-01-25T19:29:00.000Z	grawity	chilli0	(Yes, I know it's a Windows thing.)
