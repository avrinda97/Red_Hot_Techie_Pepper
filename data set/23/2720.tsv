2008-12-15T21:41:00.000Z	shirish	tiyowan	 The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
2008-12-15T21:41:00.000Z	shirish	tiyowan	robb_m: please look above.

2008-12-15T21:52:00.000Z	shirish	tiyowan	this was a partition which I am using all the time
2008-12-15T21:53:00.000Z	tiyowan	shirish	I can't find anything other than the link I gave you. Personally, I have no clue about fixing your problem.
2008-12-15T21:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	shirish	Try running fsck -y /dev/X where X is your partition. If that doesn't help. I'm all out of ideas.
2008-12-15T21:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	shirish	And please do this from a liveCD.
2008-12-15T21:57:00.000Z	shirish	tiyowan	I'm on the live CD
2008-12-15T21:58:00.000Z	tiyowan	shirish	Right. Now do you know the name of your partition?
2008-12-15T21:59:00.000Z	shirish	tiyowan	see http://pastebin.com/ma98bc53
2008-12-15T22:01:00.000Z	tiyowan	shirish	Ah I think I know. Do this please: "fsck -y /dev/sdb7" and pastebin the results.
2008-12-15T22:04:00.000Z	shirish	tiyowan	I guessed it worked http://pastebin.com/m282f0d35

2008-12-15T22:06:00.000Z	shirish	tiyowan	hindi, indian?
2008-12-15T22:06:00.000Z	tiyowan	shirish	Remove the LiveCD and boot into Ubuntu. Let us know whether it worked.
