2012-02-13T20:30:00.000Z	asterisk-Tester		hello, does nvidia GT555M (lenovo Y570) have drivers for Ubuntu or yet ?
2012-02-13T20:31:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	I would believe so. I can check for ya
2012-02-13T20:32:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-270.41.06-driver.html
2012-02-13T20:33:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	that's the one you need or a newer version. But that there supports the 555m
2012-02-13T20:34:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	so 270.41.06 will do the trick
2012-02-13T20:36:00.000Z	asterisk-Tester	shadowe989	thanks a lot but do u think it might work if ubuntu is installed as guest in virtual box, or it depende on virtual box  ?
2012-02-13T20:36:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	you need the nvidia driver installed on the host
2012-02-13T20:37:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	then you need to install the "guest additions" on the virtual machine. That will give you 3d acceleration. I have the same setup but different nvidia card
2012-02-13T20:38:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	basically virtual machines have their own drivers which they call "Guest additions" that allow the VM to use your real hardware more efficiently. So if your using ubuntu in a VM you don't need the nvidia driver.
2012-02-13T20:38:00.000Z	asterisk-Tester	shadowe989	exactly i had it installed, but unity 3D was so sluggish, so i had to switch to unity 2D
2012-02-13T20:38:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	ohh
2012-02-13T20:38:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	okay have you tried increasing vram of the guest and making sure 3d acceleration is on?
2012-02-13T20:39:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	yeah guest addition updates and virtual box updates do help 3d acceleration.
2012-02-13T20:40:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	yeah thats all virtual box supports, same with vmware
2012-02-13T20:40:00.000Z	asterisk-Tester	shadowe989	:-) ok i though vmware was more powerfull in that domain
2012-02-13T20:40:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	but vmware player has superior 3d performance. Where I can get modern games to run without lag.
2012-02-13T20:40:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	your correct
2012-02-13T20:41:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	I keep vmware player (free version) just for when I need good 3d acceleration. but I use virtual box for most of my development.
2012-02-13T20:42:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	I don't understand why that is but 128MB can do quite a bit. I'd give it a shot. Vmware player is 100% free unlike other versions, so it might be worth using until virtualbox catches up some.
2012-02-13T20:42:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	you are correct.
2012-02-13T20:43:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	I've had issues with 3d acceleration on virtualbox then loaded it on vmware and it works fine. so thats my advise to work around that for now.
2012-02-13T20:44:00.000Z	asterisk-Tester	shadowe989	ok thx for sharing ur experiance and advice :-)
2012-02-13T20:44:00.000Z	shadowe989	asterisk-Tester	anytime and good luck :)
