2008-10-14T10:17:00.000Z	carrebeanpirates	amenado	true it was only the dhcp server and the network interfaces the dhcp.conf didn't adapt this since I was not sure how to modify the config file like the howto is indicating

2008-10-14T11:11:00.000Z	carrebeanpirates	amenado	question concerning the network since the IP adress from my ISP is changing from time to time don't I get into trouble when putting a fixed IP there?
2008-10-14T11:13:00.000Z	carrebeanpirates	amenado	the modem from my ISP is changing IP's on regular bases so the server should be able to pick this up to right?
2008-10-14T11:15:00.000Z	carrebeanpirates	amenado	ok sorry for the confusion so the eth0 should change in iface eth0 dynamic and skip everything that's comming below or am I wrong here
