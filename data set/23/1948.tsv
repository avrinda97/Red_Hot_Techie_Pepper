2012-02-18T11:22:00.000Z	poyntz		hi all
2012-02-18T11:23:00.000Z	poyntz		when I try to run sudo mount -t hfsplus -o I get http://paste.kde.org/424388/
2012-02-18T11:23:00.000Z	poyntz		- please help me fix it
2012-02-18T11:24:00.000Z	poyntz		or get the hfsplus
2012-02-18T11:25:00.000Z	poyntz		actually
2012-02-18T11:25:00.000Z	poyntz		I think it's now hpumount
2012-02-18T11:27:00.000Z	poyntz		to .iso
2012-02-18T11:27:00.000Z	WoC	poyntz	-o loop
2012-02-18T11:27:00.000Z	WoC	poyntz	are you mounting a image file ?
2012-02-18T11:27:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	yep
2012-02-18T11:27:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	only half the files show up if i do that
2012-02-18T11:28:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	I'm guessing that the other files are not mounted
2012-02-18T11:28:00.000Z	WoC	poyntz	the image has more than one partition ?
2012-02-18T11:28:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	because the fs type is not supported
2012-02-18T11:28:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	possibly
2012-02-18T11:29:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	I wouldn't be surprised if it has 6/7 partitions
2012-02-18T11:29:00.000Z	WoC	poyntz	that could explain why you dont see all files
2012-02-18T11:29:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	I think it's a hfs filesystem as well
2012-02-18T11:30:00.000Z	WoC	poyntz	if u have a mac emulator to use it in, try that... assuming the image is from a mac
2012-02-18T11:31:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	I don't have a mac emulator :(. Basically I'm trying to covert a .dmg file to an .iso
2012-02-18T11:32:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	I want to put all the files on the .iso onto a pendrive and install Mac OS X on another partition
2012-02-18T11:33:00.000Z	WoC	poyntz	that sounds more like a osx question than ubuntu question
2012-02-18T11:42:00.000Z	poyntz	WoC	Blue1 ~ thanks i'll give the windows program a shot
