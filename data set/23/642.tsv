2012-03-29T08:50:00.000Z	kevdog		I'm wondering what the best way to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 -- gosh darn I hate upgrading
2012-03-29T08:50:00.000Z	cc11rocks	kevdog	: reninstall is recommended - from scratch
2012-03-29T08:51:00.000Z	cc11rocks		That way you can't have any issues...I've built scripts to
2012-03-29T08:51:00.000Z	cc11rocks		reconfigure once I do a reinstall
2012-03-29T08:51:00.000Z	kevdog		I hate clean upgrades -- I got a separate home partition -- but all the customization within /etc and the udev scripts --- SUCKS
2012-03-29T08:51:00.000Z	cc11rocks		Cinnamon here for me...
2012-03-29T08:52:00.000Z	cc11rocks		10.10 << Good release. 11.04 << Bad release. 12.04 << Should be good release :)
2012-03-29T08:53:00.000Z	kevdog		where is 11.10 in that schema?
2012-03-29T08:53:00.000Z	cc11rocks		I left it out because I didn't do much testing for 11.10...
2012-03-29T08:53:00.000Z	cc11rocks		So I'm not gonna comment...
2012-03-29T08:53:00.000Z	kevdog		I wanted to use unity, but I couldn't see my desktop because the unity bar was taking up the entire screen
2012-03-29T08:54:00.000Z	cc11rocks		I'm going to try to go to my first "installfest" to try to help newbies and talk and such this weekend...
2012-03-29T08:54:00.000Z	kevdog	cc11rocks	good for you, exciting
2012-03-29T08:54:00.000Z	cc11rocks		My loco team is meeting 10 miles from my house :) ...So I'ma check it out
2012-03-29T08:55:00.000Z	kevdog	cc11rocks	the loco team near me is dead

2012-03-29T08:57:00.000Z	cc11rocks		I see...The IRC loco is dead...but they said that it usually is with the sign up email
2012-03-29T08:57:00.000Z	cc11rocks		Certain times of the day for sceduling, depending on the loco team
