2008-03-20T01:42:00.000Z	patrick_		rinaldi, thats the thing if i have the custom effects settings, when i click preferences nothing pops up. if i have it on extra, nothing happens, no wobbly windows ngor anythi
2008-03-20T01:43:00.000Z	patrick_		svenstaro how? i did alt+f2 and typed in compiz

2008-03-20T01:46:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	so can you tell me exactly which packages did you install then
2008-03-20T01:40:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	you didnt autostart compiz
2008-03-20T01:42:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	try to manually start compiz first
2008-03-20T01:44:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	which command did you use before? which guide did you follow to install it?
2008-03-20T01:44:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	yes, so you didnt do anything actually?
2008-03-20T01:47:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	uhm I didnt advise you to install anything, I think youre confusing me. Anyway, I'll get the command
2008-03-20T01:50:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	as a normal user, please run compiz --replace
2008-03-20T01:50:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	in X of course, in a normal terminal
2008-03-20T01:52:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	without quotes: "compiz --replace"
2008-03-20T01:52:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	well, did compiz activate?
2008-03-20T01:53:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	that is strange indeed, hang on
2008-03-20T01:54:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	try "sudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager "
2008-03-20T01:56:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	type "metacity --replace"
2008-03-20T01:59:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	Yes definately, tho you never should have to reinstall gutsy, a clean uninstallation of compiz should do the trick, type "sudo apt-get remove compiz --purge"
2008-03-20T01:59:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	after that, install compiz again and hope
2008-03-20T02:00:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	also check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/CompizFusion
2008-03-20T02:01:00.000Z	Svenstaro	patrick_	okay patrick sorry I couldnt help, good luck
