2010-08-28T01:43:00.000Z	family	ilovefairuz	hmm i see , i get it , does the terminal recognize after saving this command : in terminal : mount /media/Movies /home/family/Desktop
2010-08-28T01:46:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	family	you won't need to do this, it will be automatically mounted next reboot, make sure that /media/Movies exists after you umount: sudo mkdir /media/Movies
2010-08-28T01:46:00.000Z	family	ilovefairuz	does the terminal execute after what i have saved in fstat; this command  in terminal : mount /media/Movies /home/family/Desktop
2010-08-28T01:46:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	family	you don't need to run any terminal commands, reboot your computer and you'll find it mounted
2010-08-28T01:47:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	family	assume it's already mounted, no need to add it to the launcher
2010-08-28T01:49:00.000Z	family	ilovefairuz	: yes it is indead, thanks alot for your help, you r a prince :)
