2007-10-09T16:34:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	your question is a bit unclear :/
2007-10-09T16:37:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	or just add the backports repository if it's already there :)
2007-10-09T16:38:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	hmm.. i already added in the backports directory - does apt-get install the latest package available from there automatically?
2007-10-09T16:38:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	the latest available ON the repository. not the latest avaialble from source.
2007-10-09T16:40:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	if you make a .deb you can install it with dpkg no need for apt-get.
2007-10-09T16:40:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	ok, thanks, I understand, what if the backports is still to old?
2007-10-09T16:40:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	ok....
2007-10-09T16:41:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	well if the version available on the repository is too old for your taste, then you'd have to play around with tarballs.
2007-10-09T16:43:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	so download the tarball source from postfix, compile and make into .deb, use dpkg to install into usr/local or /opt  - or can i let dpkg handle the install location?
2007-10-09T16:44:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	what is the reason you're so fond of the latest version of postfix?
2007-10-09T16:46:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	if there is no real reason for having the very last one just use the one available from the ubuntu repositories.
2007-10-09T16:47:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	apt-get installs version 2.2.10 which means you have to use postfix smtp auth. version 2.3 or greater of postfix allows you to use dovecot sasl which gives you more setup options...
2007-10-09T16:48:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	and i have just finished a new setup which now does not smtp auth as i used version 2.2.10 without realising the full ramifications....
2007-10-09T16:49:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	so i am trying to consider my best options to get if fixed.... I am also using postfixadmin to manage the user accounts so switching to postfix auth will be worse...
2007-10-09T16:50:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	any suggestions? :-)
2007-10-09T16:52:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	am googling a bit
2007-10-09T16:52:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	many thanks...
2007-10-09T16:57:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	Hmmm tbh I think just build it from source.
2007-10-09T05:02:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	ok, so download source and build?
2007-10-09T05:07:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	should I remove the existing package first ?
2007-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	should i remove the existing package first then start to compile the source? thanks...
2007-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	Moosky	thesaint4444	that would be best.
2007-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	thesaint4444	Moosky	thanks... lol
