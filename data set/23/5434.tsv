2007-11-23T19:05:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36		anyone have a clue why my ubuntu machine would stop accepting all incoming TCP connections when I upgraded to new hardware?
2007-11-23T19:06:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36		(the network interface changed name from eth0 to eth1, I tried editing the udev rules to rename it back, but that did not help=
2007-11-23T19:06:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	Yes, the MAC address of the network adapter for instance would be different
2007-11-23T19:06:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	I don't see why that would matter, I have a static IP.
2007-11-23T19:07:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	Because the system attaches for instance eth0 to mac address <whatever>
2007-11-23T19:07:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36		"# This file is no longer used and has been automatically replaced.
2007-11-23T19:07:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36		like I said, I already edited the udev rules and got it renamed back to eth0.
2007-11-23T19:08:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36		it's still not accepting incoming connections.
2007-11-23T19:08:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	udev rules has nothing to do with the mac address, only the device driver/type/name
2007-11-23T19:09:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	/etc/iftab says that it is obsolete and replaced with udev rules.
2007-11-23T19:09:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	edit /etc/iftab to put correct mac address of whatever nic needs to be eth0 eth1 etc etc
2007-11-23T19:09:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	and I already got it changed back to eth0 by editing udev rules.
2007-11-23T19:10:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	OK. Did you change a bunch of hardware or just nic, etc
2007-11-23T19:10:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	entire machine.
2007-11-23T19:11:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	outwards connections work just fine, I'm using that machine right now. incoming connections don't.
2007-11-23T19:11:00.000Z	genii		Hmm
2007-11-23T19:11:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	Looks like a router issue then
2007-11-23T19:11:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	this is a university network, not a home setup.
2007-11-23T19:12:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	Is the university switch/hub/router that machine is connected to previously assign a static IP or did you have to manually set up ip, gateway etc etc p
2007-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	static IP all the way.
2007-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	WAIT.
2007-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	genii	WAHa_06x36	I would suspect the next machine in the hop still remembers your old MAC address
2007-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	WAHa_06x36	genii	apparently my IP *has* changed! this makes no sense, but it explains the problem.
