2007-07-03T09:28:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 nano
2007-07-03T09:34:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	when nothing worked at all for me I checked the CD, the CD drive, the IDE cable ... I had a bad CD drive, as it turned out
2007-07-03T12:02:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 first thing you'll need is the monitor's specs for vertical and horizontal ... what'sitcalled. refresh rate?
2007-07-03T12:03:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 that's not the spec you're looking for
2007-07-03T12:05:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	yes, most likely
2007-07-03T12:06:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	look up your monitor's specs; you will find specs for vert and horiz sync
2007-07-03T12:06:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	these will be in the form of ranges, for example, vertical sync 60-110 kHz (I made this up, check your actual specs)
2007-07-03T12:09:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 yes
2007-07-03T12:26:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	check that the backup exists: 'ls /etc/X11/xorg.*
2007-07-03T12:20:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	thought you found them, 56-76Hz vertical, 30-83kHz horizontal?
2007-07-03T12:22:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	the ranges are what you want (e.g., 56-76Hz if that was correct)
2007-07-03T12:23:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 next you back up your xorg.conf file: In a terminal window, 'sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup' (no quotes marks, and the X in X11 is capitalized)
2007-07-03T12:27:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	check that the backup exists: 'ls /etc/X11/xorg.*'
2007-07-03T12:28:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	are you needing to work working from a command line? or can you use a GUI editor like gedit for a bit?
2007-07-03T12:30:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	you  can use nano instead of gedit and avoid the whole gui issue if need be
2007-07-03T12:33:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	find Section "Monitor" and look for "Horizsync" and "VertRefresh" (they may not be there yet though)  -- find: Section "Monitor"
2007-07-03T12:35:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	n/p - add them: HorizSync  (and the range of horizontal sync you looked up) and then VertRefresh (and the vert ref. you looked up)
2007-07-03T12:36:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 HorizSync and VertRefresh - the capitalization doesn't matter but the spelling does
2007-07-03T12:37:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 ctl-alt-f1 will take you to a console
2007-07-03T12:40:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	mytoaster	 I think it's ctl-o to write out your changed file ... should be prompts at bottom of screen
