2010-04-16T19:25:00.000Z	carlosleon		how could install and then start a vnc service from the ubuntu console?
2010-04-16T19:25:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 try vino-server
2010-04-16T19:25:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 are you using a WM err?
2010-04-16T19:26:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	what a WM err is?
2010-04-16T19:26:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	actually I'm connected to a desktop machine using ssh
2010-04-16T19:27:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 ok hang on
2010-04-16T19:27:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	ok
2010-04-16T19:27:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 check it http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-266981.html
2010-04-16T19:32:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	I see that this program uses lot of gnome thing in its commands. I've installed Kubuntu. Does it matters?
2010-04-16T19:33:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 hmm should work the same with the program
2010-04-16T19:33:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	ok
2010-04-16T19:35:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	the instructions say to make this, but I can not find that route gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true
2010-04-16T19:36:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 why are you saying route gconftool
2010-04-16T19:37:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	that's what the instructions say buddy
2010-04-16T19:38:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 just leave out the route before gconftool
2010-04-16T19:40:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	how could I know in which port the vnc server is listening to?
2010-04-16T19:40:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 I think it's like 3192 err
2010-04-16T19:41:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 vnc is 5900
2010-04-16T19:41:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 make sure you have an exception in your firewall or iptables
2010-04-16T19:42:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	that's the deal :-/ know I have to connect to the router through telnet and do all that stuff :S
2010-04-16T19:43:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 you may have to enable port forwarding if you're behind a router
2010-04-16T19:44:00.000Z	carlosleon	hexdump_	actually, that's the reason I wanted to start the VNC Server, because of the annoying work of configuring the router through telnet :S
2010-04-16T19:44:00.000Z	hexdump_	carlosleon	 have you tried vino-server & in ssh
