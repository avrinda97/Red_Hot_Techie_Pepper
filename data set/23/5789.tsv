2006-09-04T06:19:00.000Z	myUserName		does anyone know any ways to make laptop battery life last longer with ubuntu as my laptop battery runs twice as long using windows
2006-09-04T06:20:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	sure, what cpu and gfx card do you have?
2006-09-04T06:21:00.000Z	myUserName	gfxstyler_	intel, everything is intel 14" monitor intel dx8 vid card  1.7ghz
2006-09-04T06:21:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	you need to load the appropiate modules for your cpu (i mean, for powersaving that is)
2006-09-04T06:21:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	like cpufreq_userspace, cpufreq_ondemand, p4-clockmod
2006-09-04T06:22:00.000Z	myUserName		how do i find out that? just search synaptic for intel?
2006-09-04T06:22:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	you have to know what type of intel cpu you have ... a mobile one, a desktop one, a centrino, a core duo
2006-09-04T06:22:00.000Z	myUserName	gfxstyler_	its a centrino
2006-09-04T06:23:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	and then you have to load the module for that, like p4-clockmod is for normal desktop cpus
2006-09-04T06:23:00.000Z	myUserName		explaining where to go to get info to do that would be a start because i have no idea how to load the module u refer to
2006-09-04T06:23:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	i dont know how the speedstepping module is called, does "locate *speedstep.ko" or "locate *speedstepping.ko" return something?
2006-09-04T06:24:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	centrinos use speedstepping to scale down their cpu speed, which saves power (and they lower voltage)
2006-09-04T06:24:00.000Z	myUserName		locate has no results
2006-09-04T06:24:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	damn
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	you load modules like: sudo modprobe modulename
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	and you unload them like: sudo rmmod modulename
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	and you can automate that process on every startup at /etc/modules
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	myUserName	gfxstyler_	 oh so sudo modprobe *centrinocraphere*
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	yes
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	myUserName	gfxstyler_	and the centrino module should already be on the hdd?
2006-09-04T06:26:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	so you can already do: sudo modprobe cpufreq_userspace   and: sudo modprobe cpufreq_ondemand
2006-09-04T06:26:00.000Z	gfxstyler_	myUserName	yes, i think ubuntu comes with many modules, you just need to load them
2006-09-04T06:27:00.000Z	myUserName	gfxstyler_	yeah ill look into it later now i know where to look. I need to reboot x to get aiglx working
