2010-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	dj_segfault		What command will take me out of X and drop me back to the command line?
2010-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	/etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	thanks
2010-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	with sudo
2010-05-11T19:19:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	if you haven't created an xorg.conf, you won't have any
2010-05-11T19:20:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	deactivate the nvidia driver from teh jockey menu "hardwa drivers"
2010-05-11T19:20:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	if it works with nouvaeu, write a bug report ;)
2010-05-11T19:20:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	If I could get to the GUI menu to do that I wouldn't have any problems ;)
2010-05-11T19:21:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	I thought you had a running GNOME and want a terminal???
2010-05-11T19:22:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	No, X wouldn't get past the Mythbuntu herringbone pattern and Ctl Alt F1 showed a blank screen
2010-05-11T19:22:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	ah, I see. Then boot into maintenance mode and do sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current
2010-05-11T19:26:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	E: Couldn't find package nvidia-current   Should I uninstall all of them or just the latest?  thanks
2010-05-11T19:27:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	dpkg -l | grep nvidia
2010-05-11T19:31:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	Do I want to remove nvidia-modaliases
2010-05-11T19:51:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	have you solved your problem?
2010-05-11T19:52:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	No.  I was able to completely remove the nvidia drivers and start x with nv driver.  When I put the nvidia drivers back on I'm once again frozen at the Mythbuntu herringbone screen.
2010-05-11T19:52:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	Thanks for getting back to me
2010-05-11T19:53:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	seems you've found a bug...
2010-05-11T19:54:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	I'm trying to remove my xorg.conf and restart now
2010-05-11T19:55:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	OK
2010-05-11T19:56:00.000Z	dj_segfault	remrot	I got X started, but dialog boxes have no window bar on top with close/max/min buttons etc.  What can cause that?
2010-05-11T19:57:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	so, evereything works with env drivers, but not with NDvidia?
2010-05-11T20:04:00.000Z	remrot	dj_segfault	does an xorg.conf exist?
