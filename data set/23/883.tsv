2010-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	Frenk		Hey I have an issue with mysql =(  ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
2010-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	gsfai	Frenk	i had this error too... not sure how i solved it... try checking the .conf file
2010-12-29T05:02:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	there is no conf >D? wtf
2010-12-29T05:04:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	root@mail ~ # locate my.conf root@mail ~ # locate my.cnf
2010-12-29T05:04:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	both nothing
2010-12-29T05:06:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	if i vi it vi wants to create a new file
2010-12-29T05:08:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	this file also dont exist - what the heck is going on oO
2010-12-29T05:09:00.000Z	gsfai	Frenk	my.cnf is probably playing hide&seek :P
2010-12-29T05:09:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	i think locate is fine and if locate didnt find anything ... the file just dont exist -.-
2010-12-29T05:10:00.000Z	gsfai	Frenk	i would say you try to reinstall the mysql-server package
2010-12-29T05:11:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	apt-get install -reinstall mysql-server?
2010-12-29T05:11:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	does it delete my databases oO???
2010-12-29T05:15:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	Just /etc/mysql/conf.d/mysqld_safe_syslog.cnf  and /usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.1/examples/my-small.cnf
2010-12-29T05:17:00.000Z	gsfai	Frenk	try reading /etc/mysql/conf.d/mysqld_safe_syslog.cnf,   /usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.1/examples/my-small.cnf is just a documentation
2010-12-29T05:18:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	content of the file> [mysqld_safe] syslog
2010-12-29T05:18:00.000Z	gsfai	Frenk	im honestly out of ideas,
2010-12-29T05:20:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	thanks
2010-12-29T05:21:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	mh maybe I need to create the my.conf file?
2010-12-29T05:21:00.000Z	gsfai	Frenk	x-actly :P
2010-12-29T05:25:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	no i created both files - mysql still doesnt work
2010-12-29T05:30:00.000Z	Frenk	gsfai	mysqld_safe works =)
