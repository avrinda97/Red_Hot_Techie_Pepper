2009-08-26T06:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	what were you trying to install?
2009-08-26T06:41:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	libglu1-mesa-dev
2009-08-26T06:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	what were you trying to install, that depended on it.
2009-08-26T06:41:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	I was trying to install libglu1-mesa-dev, it depended on libglu1-mesa
2009-08-26T06:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	ok, why were you trying to libglu1-mesa-dev
2009-08-26T06:42:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	To compile a game on linux
2009-08-26T06:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	and the truth shall set you free.
2009-08-26T06:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	what game, and are you sure its not in the repos?
2009-08-26T06:44:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	Trying to compile Egoboo, but the repo version is outdated so I have to compile the latest one.
2009-08-26T06:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	how did you install the dependencies?
2009-08-26T06:45:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	My guess was that the dependencies were installed when I installed my IDE, code::blocks
2009-08-26T06:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	link me to where you downloaded the source
2009-08-26T06:47:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	http://sourceforge.net/projects/egoboo/files/Linux%20Source%20Distro/2.7.4%20%28Stable%2032-bit%29/egoboo-2.7.4.tar.gz/download
2009-08-26T06:47:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	Basically, it says I have 7.4-0ubuntu3.2 installed, but libglu1-mesa-dev needs 7.4-0ubuntu3.1
2009-08-26T06:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	ok, hang on a sec, its downloading
2009-08-26T06:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	haven't forgotten you, these dependencies are taking a while to install
2009-08-26T06:55:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	Lol thanks :P I'm currently downgrading my libglu1-mesa to see if that would fix the problem.
2009-08-26T06:58:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	Hey! I think I solved my problem. I just downgraded the package and everything worked out fine! Whats funny is that I had a version installed that wasn't on the ubuntu repos. Odd...
2009-08-26T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	ok.. did you try running apt-get build-dep?
2009-08-26T06:59:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	Nope, whats that do?
2009-08-26T06:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	AvonGenesis	when you're downloading the source for a program, and there's an older version in the repositories
2009-08-26T07:00:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	IndyGunFreak	Ah I see. Thanks!
