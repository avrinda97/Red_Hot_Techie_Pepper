2006-06-10T14:11:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		looks like su is the only way this app is going to install....sudo itself won't work, and when I try sudo -i I get a message from /bin/sh that it "cannot execute binary file"
2006-06-10T14:13:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	That's not because of sudo.  That's because you're asking /bin/sh (in whatever manner) to execute a non-excutable file.
2006-06-10T14:13:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	To see this for yourself, try to run, say, a tar file.
2006-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	hmm, the file has an sh extension...supposedly a self installing shell script
2006-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	Can you run the 'file' command on it and see what it says?
2006-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	$ file foo.sh
2006-06-10T14:16:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	should tell you what kind of file it is -- might not be something you can execute -- then again, you say it's a script and /bin/sh is giving the error.  It's likely the script is trying to execute something that's not a program.
2006-06-10T14:18:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	file responded that it was a "Bourne shell script text executable"
2006-06-10T14:19:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	Can you pastebin it somewhere?
2006-06-10T14:21:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	Well, that error simply means that the system is trying to "run" a file that has execute permissions but is not a program file.  For example, a tar file, a sound file, or anything else that is not executable code, but may have execute permissions set.
2006-06-10T14:23:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	when the program terminates I get the message "The setup program seems to have failed on x86/glibc-2.3"
2006-06-10T14:25:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	Hrm, I'm not sure why it would be telling you that other than it's probably related to the previous error.  The libc installed with the system is glibc 2.3.6.
2006-06-10T14:29:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	and of course, the instructions on their website say all you should need to do is run the script....just open a file browser and double click it
2006-06-10T14:31:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	I open the File Browser, double click the file, and gedit tries to open it
2006-06-10T14:33:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	This script that you have, does it have the execute bit set?
2006-06-10T14:33:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	I'm guessing it's mode 644 and not 755 (or other appropriate permission set).  Can you paste an ls -l output of it here?
2006-06-10T14:36:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	ah, that would be the problem...it's set to 644
2006-06-10T14:37:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	Ah, yes, then /bin/sh is complaining about not being able to execute the script itself. ;-)  Once you chmod that, you should meet with more success.
2006-06-10T14:37:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	-rw-r--r--
2006-06-10T14:43:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	apparently this is not meant to be....I set the x flag, and it still comes back with a message that $HOME must exist and belong to me, and that I may need to log in as root or use su instead of sudo
2006-06-10T14:44:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	Well, there is always sudu -i :-)  Run that without arguments to get a root shell.
2006-06-10T14:50:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	gdb	The DISPLAY variable is not set.  You should either login to as root or use the command "su" with no flags, to make sure setup has an X display to use.
2006-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	gdb	Geoffrey2	In that case, then you might just stick with "sudo -s" rather than "sudo -i"
