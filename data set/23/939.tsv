2011-09-24T12:10:00.000Z	s0126h		is it true that if you forget root password in ubuntu, it makes no difference
2011-09-24T12:10:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	there is no root password
2011-09-24T12:10:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	so you can't forget it
2011-09-24T12:11:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	you can but it's unwise and un-needed
2011-09-24T12:12:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	if you don't know, you shouldn't do it
2011-09-24T12:12:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	why do you want to do that ?
2011-09-24T12:13:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	then use "sudo -i" and be root
2011-09-24T12:13:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	sudo -i sets the environment correctly
2011-09-24T12:14:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	in what respect
2011-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	because you know your own sudo password
2011-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	and your user is authorized
2011-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	s0126h	ikonia	i don't like that system:  i like system where i have to know root password to get super priviledegt
2011-09-24T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	you don't like typing sudo -i, but you so like typing su - to be root
2011-09-24T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	is that really what you're saying
2011-09-24T12:16:00.000Z	s0126h	ikonia	 yes sort of ;  because to do  "su root" you have to know root password
2011-09-24T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	what does it matter if you know the root password ?
2011-09-24T12:17:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	then use it, good luck.
2011-09-24T12:17:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	one sets the environment, the other sets the id
2011-09-24T12:17:00.000Z	s0126h	ikonia	i dont' get it
2011-09-24T12:18:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	possibly why you should be using sudo then
2011-09-24T12:18:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	you know what you're doing - so either do it or don't
2011-09-24T12:21:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	don't use it then,
2011-09-24T12:21:00.000Z	ikonia	s0126h	read the documentation ubottu has provided
