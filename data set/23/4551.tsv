2010-09-16T21:00:00.000Z	Emanon		ok Paddy_NI it said my mode was deprecated and suggested a new one there is no way im going to remember during boot
2010-09-16T21:00:00.000Z	Emanon		and didnt work
2010-09-16T21:01:00.000Z	Emanon		said that vga=0x0369 is deprecated and suggested a lower res (but proper aspect ratio i think) in a different format
2010-09-16T21:02:00.000Z	Emanon		no but i tried praying to cthulhu and sacrificing some small children
2010-09-16T21:02:00.000Z	Emanon		nvidia 8800
2010-09-16T21:02:00.000Z	Emanon		gt i think
2010-09-16T21:02:00.000Z	Emanon		thank you
2010-09-16T21:03:00.000Z	Emanon		like on my encryption passphrase screen
2010-09-16T21:03:00.000Z	Emanon		and such
2010-09-16T21:04:00.000Z	Emanon		no i can't and if i could it does kind of matter i can enter passphrase fine as it is now but it looks crappy
2010-09-16T21:05:00.000Z	mbeierl	Emanon	sorry - just jumping in late here: you've got an extremely low resolution during plymouth and that's when it's asking for the passphrase?
2010-09-16T21:05:00.000Z	Emanon		yes mbeierl
2010-09-16T21:05:00.000Z	Emanon		and no Artemis3 not at login at hard disk decrypt
2010-09-16T21:05:00.000Z	Emanon		ill give it a try Paddy_NI
2010-09-16T21:06:00.000Z	mbeierl	Emanon	and that started when you went nvidia proprietary.  Same here and I read / saw / ? somewhere about the resolution during boot being way off after nvidia proprietary and for the life of me cannot find where
2010-09-16T21:06:00.000Z	mbeierl		I just keep ignoring it as I don't boot often
2010-09-16T21:06:00.000Z	Emanon		well ive found some fixes that involve editing grub configs but they dont work for me
2010-09-16T21:07:00.000Z	Emanon		i can see the prompt just fine and i dont need to i can type my passphrase fine it just looks like it came out of my butt
2010-09-16T21:08:00.000Z	mbeierl	Emanon	it might be this puppy: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/03/how-to-get-plymouth-working-with-nvidia.html
2010-09-16T21:08:00.000Z	Emanon	Paddy_NI	you know if i can do that in the grub configs instead of at boot?
2010-09-16T21:08:00.000Z	Emanon		tried that one mbeierl
2010-09-16T21:08:00.000Z	Emanon		and the comment it links to at the bottom too
2010-09-16T21:08:00.000Z	mbeierl	Emanon	and this? http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/
