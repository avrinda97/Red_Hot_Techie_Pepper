2005-04-05T07:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde		Why isn't firefox in the upgraded packages list of warty?
2005-04-05T07:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	it should be, but Warty apps aren't upgraded. Hoary has the new apps.
2005-04-05T07:43:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	You are right. But Firefox has been updated for security reasons. So it must be in the security.ubuntu.com list.
2005-04-05T07:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	then dist-upgrading warty will, I am quite sure, pull it in.
2005-04-05T07:44:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	No it doesn't show up in th elist.
2005-04-05T07:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox. Does that say you have the latest version?
2005-04-05T07:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	doing apt-get update first, of course.
2005-04-05T07:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	and..well? Does it?
2005-04-05T07:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	well, anyway, if that command doesn't update it then you have your answer -- it's not that ubuntu-base doesn't pull it in, it's that you have the latest available version for Warty.
2005-04-05T07:55:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	I am running latest warty. Still there are no live bookmarks in FF, it shows version 0.93.
2005-04-05T07:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	well, your answer then is that they haven't updated the app in Warty.
2005-09-11T07:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	because it hasn't been packaged?
2005-09-11T07:35:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	then what does this link http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/v/vlc/vlc_0.8.2-1ubuntu3_i386.deb correspond to?
2005-09-11T07:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	breezy
2005-09-11T07:36:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	Ok Thanks.
2005-10-05T07:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	no, mouse is an X issue
2005-10-05T07:49:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	Yes, you are right. But it might be related to X in KUbuntu
2005-10-05T07:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	considering X in Kubuntu is exactly the same as it is in Ubuntu ;-)
2005-10-05T07:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	he did say that, yes :)
2005-10-05T07:52:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	Then this is not at all related to X i suppose. Some serial mouse are known to cause problems.
2005-10-05T07:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	onkarshinde	hence, it's an X issue.
2005-10-05T07:52:00.000Z	onkarshinde	apokryphos	Ok. I take my word back.
