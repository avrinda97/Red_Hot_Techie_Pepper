2005-04-23T05:41:00.000Z	imperfect-		man this is really pissing me off
2005-04-23T05:43:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	actually, rocket science is easy
2005-04-23T05:43:00.000Z	imperfect-	pvh	apparently.
2005-04-23T05:48:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	have you been a computer user long?
2005-04-23T05:48:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	because it wasn't very long ago that windows was the same way
2005-04-23T05:48:00.000Z	imperfect-	pvh	I've been using linux for 10 years ;)
2005-04-23T05:48:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	that would explain it
2005-04-23T05:48:00.000Z	imperfect-	pvh	and im ready to throw this motherfucker out the window
2005-04-23T05:49:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	i know how you feel
2005-04-23T05:49:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	the worst thing is that you have no big company to direct abuse at
2005-04-23T05:49:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	unless you count nvidia?
2005-04-23T05:49:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	don't they provide linux support? i was amazed that when i called netgear the other day they gave me lnux support
2005-04-23T05:50:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	i'd say give nvidia a call
2005-04-23T05:50:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	either that or one of those 24hr help hotlines
2005-04-23T06:57:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	you seem to be having a lousy day
2005-04-23T06:57:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	wish i could help
2005-04-23T06:57:00.000Z	imperfect-	pvh	yeah no joke ;)
2005-04-23T06:57:00.000Z	imperfect-	pvh	hey! I'm in 1600x1200 once someone told me the nv was broked!
2005-04-23T06:58:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	oh, great. did you have to switch to "nvidia"?
2005-04-23T06:58:00.000Z	imperfect-	pvh	yep and all is well
2005-04-23T06:58:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	i seem to remember doing something like that, but i couldn't remember if it was a switch from nv to nvidia or vice versa
2005-04-23T06:58:00.000Z	imperfect-	pvh	the closed driver works wonders ;)
2005-04-23T06:59:00.000Z	pvh	imperfect-	they done good, yeah
