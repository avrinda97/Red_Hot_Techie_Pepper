2008-08-31T18:15:00.000Z	aualin		Why do you want do that downgrade maxkelley?
2008-08-31T18:16:00.000Z	maxkelley	aualin	downgrade?
2008-08-31T18:16:00.000Z	aualin		Whoops
2008-08-31T18:16:00.000Z	aualin		I read it wrong :)
2008-08-31T18:16:00.000Z	maxkelley		hehe
2008-08-31T18:16:00.000Z	maxkelley		oh, shoot.
2008-08-31T18:16:00.000Z	aualin		I mean why do you want to upgrade to feisty instead of hardy?
2008-08-31T18:16:00.000Z	maxkelley	aualin	you can't upgrade straight and skip a version, can you?
2008-08-31T18:17:00.000Z	aualin		I am pretty sure you can :)
2008-08-31T18:17:00.000Z	maxkelley		oh, ok.
2008-08-31T18:17:00.000Z	maxkelley		thanks aualin
2008-08-31T18:17:00.000Z	aualin		maxkellet: Try it first and see if it works.
2008-08-31T18:18:00.000Z	maxkelley	aualin	well, not only that, but I found a link to repository for old releases, which is what I need, so I can upgrade everything on edgy, then install the latest stuff.
2008-08-31T18:19:00.000Z	aualin	maxkelley	Why not upgrade directly to hardy?
2008-08-31T18:20:00.000Z	aualin	maxkelley	Less to download and install
2008-08-31T18:20:00.000Z	aualin	maxkelley	just run update-manager -c in console
2008-08-31T18:20:00.000Z	maxkelley		because I run into dependency hell
2008-08-31T18:20:00.000Z	aualin	maxkelley	Damn that's pretty serious.
2008-08-31T18:20:00.000Z	maxkelley		ja
2008-08-31T18:21:00.000Z	aualin		maxkellet: Easiest would be too backup all your documents settings etc. and install hardy from scratch
2008-08-31T18:21:00.000Z	maxkelley	aualin	nah, it's a server, I'm too lazy
2008-08-31T18:21:00.000Z	maxkelley		It wouldn't be too bad to take it down, but I want to try this first.
2008-08-31T18:22:00.000Z	aualin	maxkelley	Do that. But backup everything before you try that.
