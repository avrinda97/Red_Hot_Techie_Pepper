2012-09-12T20:21:00.000Z	theadmin	iNTEl	Why is it funny? Some people are unable to understand English and other languages on the CD editions.
2012-09-12T20:20:00.000Z	theadmin	iNTEl	Yes, just that.
2012-09-12T20:22:00.000Z	theadmin	iNTEl	But for ALL the languages that are around? Yes, it will be big
2012-09-12T20:22:00.000Z	theadmin	iNTEl	To download your language pack you have to understand the language the CD is in.
2012-09-12T20:23:00.000Z	theadmin	iNTEl	You don't need the DVD, you don't download the DVD, it's simple as that.
2012-09-12T20:23:00.000Z	theadmin	iNTEl	Also, I think the DVD is not 4.7 GB but just around 1.5
