2007-03-21T08:07:00.000Z	jrandolph		oops....
2007-03-21T08:08:00.000Z	jrandolph		i'm having trouble installing my graphics card (ATI) recognized by ubuntu. i feel like i've been to the forums and a lot of websites, only to always end up at the same place. what other sources of support are there for me?
2007-03-21T08:08:00.000Z	jrandolph		radeon x800
2007-03-21T08:09:00.000Z	jrandolph		flgrxinfo?
2007-03-21T08:09:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	fglrxinfo
2007-03-21T08:14:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	glxinfo |grep direct .. what does it say? yes or no
2007-03-21T08:15:00.000Z	jrandolph	IcemanV9	two lines, direct rendering is no
2007-03-21T08:16:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	yea. mesa don't usually give 3d accle support
2007-03-21T08:17:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	does radeon or ati work for you before fglrx? does direct rendering: yes for radeon OR ati ??
2007-03-21T08:17:00.000Z	jrandolph	IcemanV9	so i'd like to use ATI drivers for my ATI graphics card, but i've been having problems getting it recognized
2007-03-21T08:18:00.000Z	jrandolph	IcemanV9	i don't really understand your question. are you asking if i have 3d support before trying to install fglrx?
2007-03-21T08:18:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	yes
2007-03-21T08:19:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	my other box have ati card - fglrx doesn't work, but radeon works and it gives 3d support (direct rendering: yes)
2007-03-21T08:19:00.000Z	jrandolph	IcemanV9	i don't think so. how would i test that? i think the wrong answer is to run glxgears
2007-03-21T08:19:00.000Z	jrandolph	IcemanV9	so on a fresh install direct rendering should work?
2007-03-21T08:20:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	you can switch back to radeon or ati and see if it does work or not.
2007-03-21T08:21:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	is your card x800? or ??
2007-03-21T08:21:00.000Z	jrandolph	IcemanV9	to switch back i need to uninstall fglrx right?
2007-03-21T08:21:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	no
2007-03-21T08:21:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	this box has x600 and fglrx works
2007-03-21T08:22:00.000Z	jrandolph	IcemanV9	do you think the x800 and x600 are similar enough that fglrx should work for me?
2007-03-21T08:23:00.000Z	IcemanV9	jrandolph	not always ... i know that x900 is different from x600 .. dunno much about x800 though
