2009-12-11T05:42:00.000Z	slackpipe		i'm having a problem with my wireless connection.  it connects, and i get an ip address, but when i try to ping the router i get destination host unreachable.  anybody have any ideas?
2009-12-11T05:43:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	can you liste the two IPs and show us the output of route -n ?
2009-12-11T05:45:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	which two ips?
2009-12-11T05:45:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	the IP you gotfrom your AP as well as the one you are trying to ping
2009-12-11T05:46:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	i got 192.168.1.103 from the ap, and i'm trying to ping 192.168.1.1
2009-12-11T05:46:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	ok, what's the output of route -n look like?
2009-12-11T05:48:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	what's the only line?
2009-12-11T05:50:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	what about tracepath 192.168.1.1?
2009-12-11T05:50:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	i thought it did.  i compared it to the connectino on this computer
2009-12-11T05:51:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	and the computer you're on now pings 192.168.1.1 with no problem?
2009-12-11T05:52:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	it gives childsplay.local (192.168.1.103) .06ms pmtu 1500
2009-12-11T05:53:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	wait.. it listed itself twice??
2009-12-11T05:53:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	yep
2009-12-11T05:54:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	doesn't report any error?
2009-12-11T05:54:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	no errors
2009-12-11T05:58:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	i've seen a similar probllem.  a friend of mine i talked into ubuntu had trouble when he went from dial up to dsl.  it would connect, but not use the connection.  he eventually just reinstalled and the installer picked it right up.
2009-12-11T05:58:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	have you checked dmesg for error messages? it's weird if your route is right and the other box can ping it that you can't
2009-12-11T05:59:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	pinging it seems to be timing out
2009-12-11T06:00:00.000Z	cn28h	slackpipe	hm, strange
2009-12-11T06:00:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	very
2009-12-11T06:01:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	i dont see any errors in the dmesg
2009-12-11T06:16:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	any ideas?
2009-12-11T06:21:00.000Z	slackpipe	cn28h	in /etc/network/interfaces should the wireless be the first device, orr the loopback? and does it matter
