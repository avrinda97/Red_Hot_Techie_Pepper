2011-03-17T03:36:00.000Z	exutux	mrbrdo	not from bootable usb, but if copy iso into usb stick you can set grub for boot from it
2011-03-17T03:37:00.000Z	mrbrdo	exutux	where could i take a look about that more in depth? i can do that no problem
2011-03-17T03:37:00.000Z	mrbrdo	exutux	i mean which commands i need to use and how i find the usb drive label
2011-03-17T03:38:00.000Z	mrbrdo	exutux	how do i find which (hd...) is the usb?
2011-03-17T03:40:00.000Z	exutux	mrbrdo	probabily it's (hd1,1)
2011-03-17T03:41:00.000Z	mrbrdo	exutux	thx.. do i need to modify that second line in the link you gave me though? i have the ubuntu livecd iso

2011-03-17T03:41:00.000Z	mrbrdo	exutux	its on the usb key on /ubuntu.iso
2011-03-17T03:42:00.000Z	mrbrdo	exutux	yes i know but "linux    (loop)/boot/grmlsmall/linux26 isofrom=/dev/sda1/grml/grml-small_2008.11.iso" this probably wont work for me?
2011-03-17T03:43:00.000Z	exutux	mrbrdo	indeed doesn't work that entry
2011-03-17T03:44:00.000Z	exutux	mrbrdo	it is another iso
