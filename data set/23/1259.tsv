2010-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	rtronk1		hello, i used /usr/sbin/useradd -m username to create 4 accounts, i have created a main user (which i am logged in with now and has Sudo access) and then i created 3 users by the name of the domain i am hosting under that acount (example.com)
2010-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	rtronk1		when i login to any of these "domain" user accts on my ssh
2010-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	rtronk1		i get $
2010-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	rtronk1		no user@server folder:
2010-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	rtronk1		just $
2010-06-12T03:43:00.000Z	rtronk1		i edited .bashrc and added the same line i have for my username acct that gets username@home dir:
2010-06-12T03:43:00.000Z	rtronk1		is it because the usernames for the domains have . in them?
2010-06-12T03:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	ssh as one of those users, and 'echo $PS1'
2010-06-12T03:45:00.000Z	rtronk1		line 1$ echo $PS1 line 2  $ line
2010-06-12T03:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	type:  PS1='\u@\h:\w:\$ '
2010-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	rtronk1		\u@\h:\w:$
2010-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	that's what you see?
2010-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	rtronk1		ya
2010-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	echo $SHELL
2010-06-12T03:48:00.000Z	rtronk1		/bin/sh
2010-06-12T03:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	make the user's shell /bin/bash
2010-06-12T03:48:00.000Z	rtronk1		how do i do that?
2010-06-12T03:48:00.000Z	rtronk1		lemme google first
2010-06-12T03:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	one way is to (carefully) edit it in /etc/passwd
2010-06-12T03:49:00.000Z	rtronk1	prince_jammys	i am a complete newb to this, i was lucky enuff to get this going as it is now, (mysql/php/apache2/phpmyadmin and configured /working:()
2010-06-12T03:50:00.000Z	rtronk1		any chance you could tell me a easy way to do it with no risk of fking somehting up
2010-06-12T03:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	you may configure the user's shell in /etc/default/useradd  (and re-create the users), or edit the current ones by (carefully) editing the user's lines in /etc/passwd
2010-06-12T03:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rtronk1	in the future, use the 'adduser' command, which is easier than 'useradd'.
