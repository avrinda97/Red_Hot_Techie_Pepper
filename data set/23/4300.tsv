2007-09-26T07:01:00.000Z	langone_		my father has just mounted a new hd here. i want to move a folder to this new hd, but i have no permission to do it! i have tried to move using the sudo command, but it didn't work. can someone help me?
2007-09-26T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	what filesystem is on the new hd?
2007-09-26T07:02:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	ntfs, but i have installed ntfs-3g
2007-09-26T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	have you done what the wiki page ubotu just gave you says?
2007-09-26T07:03:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	uhn, i'll try here, and i'll let you know
2007-09-26T07:05:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	i just can't find it on the wiki!
2007-09-26T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	did ubotu send you a message?
2007-09-26T07:05:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	yes, but i already have the ntsc-3g installed
2007-09-26T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	yes, but I asked if you followed all of the instructions on that page, including installing and running ntfs-config
2007-09-26T07:06:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	yes, i did
2007-09-26T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	pastebin your /etc/fstab
2007-09-26T07:06:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	on pvt?
2007-09-26T07:08:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38605/
2007-09-26T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	there are no lines for ntfs-3g on there, can you try running ntfs-config again and telling it to enable your ntfs partition again?
2007-09-26T07:10:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	strange, i have done it. may i should reboot?
2007-09-26T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	no, try running again, but make sure you check the partitions you want to access and hit apply
2007-09-26T07:13:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	i've done, but it just remains the same. uhn, maybe it isn't ntfs?
2007-09-26T07:13:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	maybe... is there any data on it?  Why not just format it as ext3?
2007-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	but i'll use it on an windows machine later, would it have any problem?
2007-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	windows can read ext3 if you install a driver.  If it's just for data and such, it will work fine
2007-09-26T07:16:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	oh, great. and how can i format it this way?
2007-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	langone_	jrib	oh, great. and how can i format it this way?
2007-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	jrib	langone_	install gparted and then use system -> administration -> GNOME Partition editor
