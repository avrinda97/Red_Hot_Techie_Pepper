2008-10-21T03:22:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	I'm surprised at that, did you have to compile from source?
2008-10-21T03:23:00.000Z	the_lost_one	csilk	yeah
2008-10-21T03:23:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	 was it the ng (new generation) code base you had to use?
2008-10-21T03:23:00.000Z	the_lost_one	csilk	that one, madwifi_ng
2008-10-21T03:24:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	sorry to hassle you.. after the installation did you have to modprobe ath_pci ?
2008-10-21T03:25:00.000Z	the_lost_one	csilk	its ok dude :), i just load it with the drivers app menu, same as doing with modprobe
2008-10-21T03:25:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	 ok cool

2008-10-24T00:36:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	before i read, was there a fix or workaround discussed?
2008-10-24T00:37:00.000Z	the_lost_one	csilk	yeah i get it working building mandwifi, looking fot the url, one sec
2008-10-24T00:37:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	yeah we just did that, built madwif then did modpribe ath_pci etc
2008-10-24T00:40:00.000Z	the_lost_one	csilk	you grabed this one? -> madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3861-20080903.tar.gz
2008-10-24T00:40:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	 yup
2008-10-24T00:42:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	did you have to modprobe anything after install?
2008-10-24T00:42:00.000Z	the_lost_one	csilk	so you unloaded (rmmod) old drivers, deleted the old atheros modules (rm -rf) and compiled the new ones and loaded again (modprobe) and still dont work?
2008-10-24T00:43:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	we didnt use the driver you just linked us to , we used an older one, thats probs where the issue was
2008-10-24T00:43:00.000Z	csilk	the_lost_one	 this isnt for me, this is just me helping someone out, I didnt realise this was a known bug to begin with
2008-10-24T00:44:00.000Z	the_lost_one	csilk	ah ok, now i understand :)
