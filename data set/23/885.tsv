2011-03-25T05:59:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	hi
2011-03-25T06:26:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	You can just install to a usb from a live cd
2011-03-25T06:27:00.000Z	tbruff13	soreau	 i dont want to use the slow defult client
2011-03-25T06:27:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	What do you mean?
2011-03-25T06:28:00.000Z	tbruff13	soreau	the startup disk creator is too slow at booting so i want to try another program
2011-03-25T06:29:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	Just boot a live cd, insert the usb and partition it as you would any other drive
2011-03-25T06:30:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	When you go to install from cd, just choose manual partitioning and select the usb device node, /dev/sdc or whatever in the partitioner
2011-03-25T06:31:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	a portable, mobile drive
2011-03-25T06:31:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	It would work on as low as 2GB and even much less for some distros
2011-03-25T06:39:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	your package manager, with universe repo enabled
2011-03-29T03:20:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	Try stopping network manager and connecting manually
2011-03-29T03:20:00.000Z	tbruff13	soreau	how
2011-03-29T03:21:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	If it's WPA, you have to use wpa_supplicant
2011-03-29T03:22:00.000Z	tbruff13	soreau	im lost what does that mean
2011-03-29T03:22:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	Are you sure that your wifi card can connect to the ap with the encryption type set? Some wifi cards cant connect to certain WPA configurations
2011-03-29T03:22:00.000Z	tbruff13	soreau	it is wpa
2011-03-29T03:22:00.000Z	soreau	tbruff13	And if all else fails, consult the network administrator for your school
2011-03-29T03:23:00.000Z	tbruff13	soreau	ok
2011-03-29T03:25:00.000Z	tbruff13	soreau	ive tried he told me the internet is open to students who can connect to it, and he told me he was unfimilar with how linux connects to the internet. He asked me if i could use windows or install something to make it look like a windows computer was trying to connect
