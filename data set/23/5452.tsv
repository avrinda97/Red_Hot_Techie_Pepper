2006-11-27T09:34:00.000Z	dogfood2006		W00T!  I just flashed my wrt54GL firmware with ddwrt
2006-11-27T09:34:00.000Z	dogfood2006		I'm running the ddwrt firmware, I'd officially like to say that it's great. Everyone should switch if they haven't already
2006-11-27T09:34:00.000Z	dogfood2006		Now I just need to make sure it's going to play nice with Comcast, those bastards might have me register the router's mac address or something
2006-11-27T09:35:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	you can clone the mac is needbe.
2006-11-27T09:37:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	how'd you get 16mb in it
2006-11-27T09:38:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	ah, I only have a wrt54gs.  gotta upgrade
2006-11-27T09:41:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	Anyway, I now need to pair that guy with my actual cable modem. I might have to clone the mac address, but hopefully not
2006-11-27T09:43:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	or unplug it for a few minutes to let the cable co's arp cache timeout.
2006-11-27T09:43:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	do you have any experience with getting 128bit WEP working with Edgy
2006-11-27T09:44:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	unplug the cable modem you mean? can you explain to me why that's necessary?
2006-11-27T09:44:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	between the cable modem and your router.  The ARP cache is the mac address/IP accress table.
2006-11-27T09:45:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	address table   **correction
2006-11-27T09:46:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	I do not, but why are you using wep?
2006-11-27T09:46:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	network device only talk to either by MAC addrss, not IP. ARPing = "Who answers to the IP address 1.2.3.4?"
2006-11-27T09:46:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	Your router should support wpa or wpa2 shared key authentication
2006-11-27T09:47:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	it does WPA but not all laptops do.
2006-11-27T09:48:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	I presume you just have to install the right package and get a wpa client for ubuntu, are you saying your NIC does not support WPA?
2006-11-27T09:49:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	w2k does not have WPA
2006-11-27T09:50:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	you're using w2k? you can probably get a third party wpa client that does though
2006-11-27T09:50:00.000Z	w3ccv	dogfood2006	besides that, my question is how to get WEP 128 to work!
2006-11-27T09:53:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	I understand. I'm looking it up in my ubuntu unleashed book right now
2006-11-27T09:54:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	Have you tried using iwconfig ?
2006-11-27T09:55:00.000Z	dogfood2006	w3ccv	man iwconfig while I look it up in my ubuntu cookbook
