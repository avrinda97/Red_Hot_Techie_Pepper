2009-03-21T03:45:00.000Z	jlink		I'm having problems loading Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop 64bit from the cd. Right now, it's sitting on the Ubuntu loading screen frozen after telling it to boot from the CD.
2009-03-21T03:47:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	have you used "check the cd for defects"?
2009-03-21T03:47:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	Nope. I'll try that now
2009-03-21T03:50:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	Ok, I told it to check the CD for defects. The screen is frozen on the ubuntu load screen again, and I think I can hear the CD spinning at full speed, but the CD light isn't flshing. Great, lol.
2009-03-21T03:50:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	sounds like either a cdrom issue, or a very bad cd, did you burn it yourself?
2009-03-21T03:52:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	I burned the CD myself using the exact same linux command I used to burn my 32bit version, other than changing the filenames. This computer's Ubuntu was setup using the 32 bit cd
2009-03-21T03:52:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	did you order that cd through shipit, or did you burn the iso yourself?
2009-03-21T03:52:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	And both CDs look in excellent condition, no scratches on either side, all shiny and such, etc
2009-03-21T03:53:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	ok, try burning another one at slower speeds, if it fails, try installing a cd to a flashdrive and boot from that
2009-03-21T03:53:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	I might just try the flash drive option. Do you have a link for doing that?
2009-03-21T03:54:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	try burning a new cd first, as the flashdrive option takes forever
2009-03-21T03:54:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	greeaat. I hate burning all these CDs, but at least I have enough cup holders now
2009-03-21T03:55:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	i went through 55 cds the first time, cause the xp burner sucked, and i forgot to extract the iso the first 10 times
2009-03-21T03:56:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	if you really would rather skip the next cd, go into System>Administration>Create a USB Startup Disk
2009-03-21T03:56:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	I think I'm going to try one other thing. The computer I'm installing it on was freshly built earlier today, and this is the first thing I've tried doing. I'm gonna install Ubuntu 32bit on the computer and see if everything goes through fine, just to double check that it's not a hardware issue
2009-03-21T03:57:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	k, I'll try that
2009-03-21T03:57:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	are you trying to use a raid?
2009-03-21T03:57:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	Nope. One single HD
2009-03-21T03:58:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	Thanks for the ideas. I've got a few more things to try now. I might be back
2009-03-21T03:58:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	good luck, im leaving the room
2009-03-21T04:08:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	try a flashdrive yet?
2009-03-21T10:20:00.000Z	gartral	jlink	more threads per proc is the main one, but the bi advantage comes if you want *more* than 4 gigs of ram
2009-03-21T10:28:00.000Z	jlink	gartral	Are you sure it isn't just soaking up idle time? There's something like that in Windows too
