2006-09-26T07:44:00.000Z	britt_		how well does mythtv work?
2006-09-26T07:45:00.000Z	britt_		and do you all think a Athlon x2 4200+ is enough for mythtv
2006-09-26T07:45:00.000Z	wols_	britt_	it's overkill
2006-09-26T07:45:00.000Z	britt_		;)
2006-09-26T07:46:00.000Z	britt_	wols_	i think i might have to dual boot linux and windows, so I can play some games.
2006-09-26T07:46:00.000Z	wols_	britt_	a hauppauge PVR or similar or best tho
2006-09-26T07:46:00.000Z	britt_		I would guess then that a P4 1.6Ghz doesnt have enough to run it
2006-09-26T07:46:00.000Z	britt_	wols_	i was planning on using the PVR-250
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	wols_	britt_	you'd guess wrong. a P3 1GHz could run it
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	britt_		wow
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	wols_		and if you use a PVR250, the CPU doesn't matter at all
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	britt_		i plan on using two of them
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	wols_		a PVR encrypts on its own
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	britt_		one for recording and one for viewing
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	wols_		erm, compresses
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	britt_	wols_	thats what i thought, hardware MPEG2 encoder
2006-09-26T07:47:00.000Z	wols_		people with PVRs often use a Via C3
2006-09-26T07:48:00.000Z	wols_		quieter, less power
2006-09-26T07:48:00.000Z	britt_		nice and quiet eh?
2006-09-26T07:48:00.000Z	britt_		intresting
2006-09-26T07:49:00.000Z	britt_		I have a p4 1.6 just doing nothing, maybe I will put that to use. ANything I should know? Does it just simply install as a module in apt-get
2006-09-26T07:50:00.000Z	wols_	britt_	it's not. you will need ivtv for your pvr which is a kernel module
2006-09-26T07:51:00.000Z	britt_	wols_	seems like the most expensive part now is the PVR0250s
