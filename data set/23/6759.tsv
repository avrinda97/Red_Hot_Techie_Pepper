2006-01-10T14:48:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3		Well, I think I'm coming back to Ubuntu. What's the best way to get a newer/testing/snapshot of ubuntu?
2006-01-10T14:48:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	you could get dapper. but its under heavy development
2006-01-10T14:49:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	The current ubuntu breezy badger is too old. The alsa drivers are too old for my soundcard. VLC has... issues. Etc.
2006-01-10T14:50:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	go ahead. use dapper. just dont expect much help from here if it goes wrong
2006-01-10T14:51:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	why dont you stick with something and just learn how to compile from source?
2006-01-10T14:54:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	I was trying the theory that I could keep everything in a nice tidy package management system.
2006-01-10T14:55:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	you can. if you instead use checkinstall instead of make install, it'll add the fake package to your apt list
2006-01-10T14:55:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	so, like ./configure; make; checkinstall ?
2006-01-10T14:55:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	thats it
2006-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	Are there any additional repositories I could add to my sources.list to give me a newer or wider software selection?
2006-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	not really.
2006-01-10T15:05:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	can you put it up on a pastebin? :D
2006-01-10T15:09:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	oh, crap, when my client crashed a few minutes ago, there went the log with the command to make a faux-package
2006-01-10T15:10:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	can you re-poost it?
2006-01-10T15:11:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	No, the command so I can make a package out of my install. You know, ./configure, make, <thatspecialsecretcommand>
2006-01-10T15:12:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	thanks!!
2006-01-10T15:13:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	its saying the directory to look at is ./ meaning to stay in the cwd
2006-01-10T15:46:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	I am feeling really stupid tonight, as I can't recall the command for making my compilation be entered into apt-get, in place of make install...
2006-01-10T15:47:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	theres probably a way you can use bash to swap "make install" into checkinstall
2006-01-10T15:47:00.000Z	blueandwhiteg3	Toma-	and that's not a normal command?
2006-01-10T15:47:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	normal?
2006-01-10T15:47:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	you'll need to use apt-get to grab checkinstall
2006-01-10T15:48:00.000Z	Toma-	blueandwhiteg3	build-essential is the package you want, and checkinstall
