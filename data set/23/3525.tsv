2008-03-30T16:08:00.000Z	kelvin911		how to open it without burning it to CD?
2008-03-30T16:09:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	is it a CD image or a program?
2008-03-30T16:12:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	It isn't, sorry. I remember I found it on Google. You gave to compile it yourself though.
2008-03-30T16:13:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	no, it's just one command for simple programs
2008-03-30T16:13:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	gcc -o name-of-executable name-of-source-code
2008-03-30T16:15:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Such complex programs usually come with a Makefile and then you can just run "make".
2008-03-30T16:17:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Well with the add/remove method you can uninstall and upgrade it easily. If you install a program manually you have to update, compile and uninstall manually because the system doesn't know of the installed program.
2008-03-30T16:18:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	The Linux kernel is the core of any Linux distribution, including Ubuntu. Some peole like to tweak it a bit and to make it runnable they have to recompile it after tweaking.
2008-03-30T16:18:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Yes, for fun! That's what open source allows people to do!
2008-04-16T13:46:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	try changing the port your bittorrent client uses
2008-04-16T13:46:00.000Z	kelvin911	bartmon	to which port?
2008-04-16T13:46:00.000Z	kelvin911	bartmon	how do i know which port is open?
2008-04-16T13:48:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Just use something random between 10000 and 64000
2008-04-16T13:50:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	port 80 is reserved for HTTP servers
2008-04-16T13:51:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	ports below 1024 are reserved for standard services
2008-04-16T13:51:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Yeah, not all of those first 10234 ports are taken :)
2008-04-16T13:52:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Also seen that, yeah.
2008-04-16T13:53:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Well if traffic hammering is forbidden  in some terms of internet service then you could've told him directly :)
2008-04-16T13:55:00.000Z	kelvin911	bartmon	its a home network
2008-04-16T14:15:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Your ISP is probably throttling the default torrent ports (6881-6889) so it has to pay for less traffic.
2008-04-16T14:07:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	10Mbps is 1.25MB/s max
2008-04-16T14:08:00.000Z	bartmon	kelvin911	Most probably
