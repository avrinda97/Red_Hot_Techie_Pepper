2009-06-01T22:56:00.000Z	Bilge		Is it possible to see if a packages is installed by default with my distribution?
2009-06-01T22:57:00.000Z	Bilge		!clone
2009-06-01T22:57:00.000Z	Bilge		I'm not sure how that addresses my question
2009-06-01T22:58:00.000Z	Bilge		But does that show which ones I installed and which are default packages
2009-06-01T22:59:00.000Z	Bilge		I got the package name with dpkg -S like you said
2009-06-01T23:00:00.000Z	Bilge		If I installed it or if it was already installed with my distribution
2009-06-01T23:00:00.000Z	Bilge		i.e. if it would be available on a parallel distribution without any additional configuration
2009-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	Bilge		I'm interested to know whether it's a process that's generally available to Ubuntu users with their distributions or not
2009-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	Bilge		I would also be interested to see a list of packages I have installed over the year
2009-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	Bilge		Which would ultimately show me the same thing
2009-06-01T23:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Bilge	dpkg -l
2009-06-01T23:03:00.000Z	Bilge		That also includes things I did not install
2009-06-01T23:03:00.000Z	Bilge		I guess there's no way to tell the difference between a package that admin(s) installed and those which were included already?
2009-06-01T23:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Bilge	But, the easiest way to know for sure what's installed by default is to look in the .manifest file of the liveCD: http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.04/ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.manifest
2009-06-01T23:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Bilge	There's no difference between those packages.
2009-06-01T23:04:00.000Z	Bilge		That is a shame
2009-06-01T23:05:00.000Z	Bilge	mdm	It's 0 bytes
2009-06-01T23:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Bilge	"preinstalled" isn't any different than "I installed it".  That's how some of the installers operate (just taking packages and installing them).
2009-06-01T23:06:00.000Z	Bilge		dpkg.log is 0 bytes
2009-06-01T23:07:00.000Z	Bilge		Yeah they are
2009-06-01T23:08:00.000Z	Bilge		That does look a lot like the things I installed although it includes a lot of dependancies that I don't recognise
2009-06-01T23:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Bilge	http://releases.ubuntu.com/9.04/ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.manifest lists everything a default install has.
2009-06-01T23:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Bilge	(well, for 9.04 Ubuntu on i386)
