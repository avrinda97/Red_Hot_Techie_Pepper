2011-06-21T17:25:00.000Z	jvargas		where can I find the firewall rules that are set at system startup?
2011-06-21T17:26:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	There are lots of firewall scripts on the internet that you could use/customize
2011-06-21T17:26:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	You really need rules that meet your specific needs.
2011-06-21T17:28:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	I need to delete annoyinh rules defined by ubuntu that make my network card very slow
2011-06-21T17:28:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	"defined by ubuntu"?
2011-06-21T17:29:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	yeah, somewhere it is setting some CONNMARK target tules
2011-06-21T17:29:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	iptables -F   will delete them
2011-06-21T17:29:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	Are you sure?
2011-06-21T17:30:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	Something tells me you are barking up the wrong tree.
2011-06-21T17:30:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	yeah I know how to delete, but I want to remove them permanently
2011-06-21T17:31:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	Unless you have created one, or have installed a firewall application that created one, there should not be a firewall script, by default.
2011-06-21T17:32:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	(...that is why I think you may be barking up the wrong tree.)  How do you know, or what makes you think there is a firewall script on your system?
2011-06-21T17:34:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	because those rules are set
2011-06-21T17:34:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	I installed this system just yesterday
2011-06-21T17:37:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	iptables -L
2011-06-21T17:37:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	What do you see....?
2011-06-21T17:37:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	iptables -L |pastebinit
2011-06-21T17:38:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	man I already delete them. They are on mangle table. I am still performing a "grep" to find them.
2011-06-21T17:41:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	yea, well, that is the only way I would know how to find them... unless I had a clue as to what application created them.
2011-06-21T17:41:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	Did you use the ufw command previously?
2011-06-21T17:42:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	nope, I disabled it before, already looked at it. it's somewhere else.
2011-06-21T17:43:00.000Z	jvargas	usr13	ok found them, it was a previous installation of zentyal.
2011-06-21T17:46:00.000Z	usr13	jvargas	"previous install of zentyal"?  You said you "installed this system just yesterday".
