2010-09-18T10:07:00.000Z	LinuxFetus		Okay, so if you're running live, what happens when you go System > Administration > Gparted?
2010-09-18T10:07:00.000Z	LinuxFetus		Does anything show up?
2010-09-18T10:09:00.000Z	LinuxFetus		Okay.
2010-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	LinuxFetus		Hmm I'll ask one more time --- to #ubuntu: Can anyone tell me 1) if there'd be any reason why my 64-bit processor with 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 run live (i.e. I haven't configured preloading or anything) is only recognizing 3397 MB of ram instead of 4096 when my bios sees 4096?
2010-09-18T10:11:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	maybe because youre using an onboard vga
2010-09-18T10:12:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	What is that and can I fix that?  I have a PAE-capable processor.
2010-09-18T10:13:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	im talking about the gpu interface. maybe if you dont have a vga at all, the memory may be dedicated to that hardware
2010-09-18T10:14:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	I have an ATI FireGL V5200 256 MB.  I don't know if it's onboard or not.
2010-09-18T10:14:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	I think it's dedicated, though.
2010-09-18T10:15:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	well... take a look at your bios
2010-09-18T10:15:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	notebook check says it's not shared http://www.notebookcheck.net/ATI-Mobility-FireGL-V5200.2164.0.html
2010-09-18T10:15:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	What should I look for in my BIOS?  It says 4096 MB of memory under system information.
2010-09-18T10:18:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	some firegl permits on bios the user to reserve more memory than its dedicated on the gpu
2010-09-18T10:19:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	I don't think my BIOS has that... Is it like a number you'd be able to specify?  If so, I'm pretty sure I can't do that.
2010-09-18T10:19:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	But is there a way to see how much ram your GPU is using, then, like free-graphics or something?
2010-09-18T10:20:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	go to synaptic and install hardinfo
2010-09-18T10:22:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	What am I looking for?  PCI Devices?
2010-09-18T10:26:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	most likely all stuff. you said youre not familiar with the hardware you got there
2010-09-18T10:26:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	When I go to Devices > Resources, I can see the memory addresses for things.
2010-09-18T10:28:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	Here's the output: http://pastebin.com/8t5JwnaV
2010-09-18T10:31:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	very nice. but I have to go now. try this paste in #hardware, most people there would know by memory if your processor is 32 or 64, memory, vga and stuff
2010-09-18T10:31:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	datacrusher	I think #hardware is invite-only
2010-09-18T10:31:00.000Z	datacrusher	LinuxFetus	##hardware
