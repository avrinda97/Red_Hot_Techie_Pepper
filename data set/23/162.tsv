2012-05-08T20:21:00.000Z	aJynks		hi guys.. I have a fresh install of the latest version of ubuntu, with the updates patched and the nvidia "post-release" drivers installed.. but I can not seam to get duel monitors working
2012-05-08T20:21:00.000Z	aJynks		I am trying to get it set up so they are runnign in diffrent x-servers so I can have a compiz cube on eahc monitor separately
2012-05-08T20:21:00.000Z	aJynks		but the 2nd screen is just white
2012-05-08T20:22:00.000Z	aJynks		any ideas?
2012-05-08T20:22:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	did you set up twinview with the nvidia-settings applet?
2012-05-08T20:22:00.000Z	aJynks	stefg	I chose "Seperate X-Screen"
2012-05-08T20:24:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	that might relate to xinerama, which is deprecated... separate x-screen is actually only useful on multiseat systems, and i think it's broken in newer versions anyway
2012-05-08T20:24:00.000Z	aJynks	stefg	oh.. right... well ok... dose twinview still allow me to have a seperate cube on each display?
2012-05-08T20:25:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	you're not going to use the cube with unity, are you?
2012-05-08T20:25:00.000Z	aJynks	stefg	why not?
2012-05-08T20:25:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	however you get an octagon, not a cube...
2012-05-08T20:26:00.000Z	aJynks	stefg	sorry I do not know what you mean.. on my other system with ubuntu i activated a thing caleld cube in compiz it seamed to work great
2012-05-08T20:27:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	unity is a compiz plugin, as is the cube... i think one breaks the other.
2012-05-08T20:27:00.000Z	aJynks		works fine on my other computer
2012-05-08T20:27:00.000Z	aJynks		no problems at all
2012-05-08T20:28:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	then o.k. , if it works for you. i've seen reports that enabling the cube kills unity
2012-05-08T20:28:00.000Z	aJynks		well had no problems
2012-05-08T20:28:00.000Z	aJynks		it there an alternitive to unity?
2012-05-08T20:29:00.000Z	stefg		!nounity | aJynks
2012-05-08T20:30:00.000Z	aJynks	stefg	is this somthing worth doing?
2012-05-08T20:31:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	depends on wether you like unity or not. I find the implementation in 12.04 quite good and find myself use it more often than the gnome-classic session (which resembles my gnome2-setup from lucid)
2012-05-08T20:32:00.000Z	aJynks		i like it fine as well.. with out being able to run the cube seprartly on eahc monitor I think I will need to change
2012-05-08T20:32:00.000Z	stefg	aJynks	just test it... if you encounter problems you know the reason. If it just works... fine!
