2007-07-04T07:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	that is nto the boot screen, it a theme that changes the toolbars and login screen and it is white
2007-07-04T07:27:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	thats from what i cna see from the website and im guessing it didnt come with instructions?
2007-07-04T07:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	how nice of devian art no wonder I ahevnt used it in time, well going to search around and see if i cna find it/ are you sure it has data for the boot screen?
2007-07-04T07:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	its impressive but it is all over the place and you're assuming which is frankly not a wise thing to do also this is soemthing for me to work on cause without instructions its pretty hard to do anything
2007-07-04T07:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	do you trully need it tonight?
2007-07-04T07:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	i know that but looking at the file type and how he has made it specially since it is for Gnome Beryl which i dont use kde or any of the other GUI implementations its hard to work this out. I'm just wndering if for now you couldnt do with art gnome or...
2007-07-04T07:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	Those theme sites which are more suer friendly
2007-07-04T07:36:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	quinton_	its an alternative as those are meant for ubuntu and other linux gnome also its better than saying i cnat help you tonight
