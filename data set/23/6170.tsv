2006-09-22T09:59:00.000Z	redblades		hi all, I just (as root) deleted some inportant info.
2006-09-22T09:59:00.000Z	redblades		Is there any way to retrieve it?
2006-09-22T10:00:00.000Z	redblades		Is it possible to recover data from ext2 ?
2006-09-22T10:02:00.000Z	redblades		Gah
2006-09-22T10:03:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	there is a way but it's easier to use a live cd to do it
2006-09-22T10:04:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	I have many Live CDs...
2006-09-22T10:05:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	I know backtrack can do it
2006-09-22T10:05:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	can you walk me through it?
2006-09-22T10:05:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	think there is a readme about it on backtrack's webpage
2006-09-22T10:07:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	??
2006-09-22T10:07:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	hang on getting it

2006-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	http://www.remote-exploit.org/index.php/Auditor_tools#Forensics
2006-09-22T10:11:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	that's just a list...
2006-09-22T10:11:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	it shows programs that you can use though
2006-09-22T10:12:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	Hrm... :|
2006-09-22T10:13:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	recover is used to recover files from a ext2 partition
2006-09-22T10:18:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	uhh.../ most of those links are either dead or... well one, http://recover.sourceforge.net/linux/recover/download.php3 had the source... but I don't know how t compile it!!!
2006-09-22T10:19:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	ubuntu has a package for it
2006-09-22T10:23:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	Gah!!! I just realised! I'm not even on ext2! I'm on ext3! I haven't restarted the computer or turned it off since the incident though...
2006-09-22T10:32:00.000Z	redblades	kitche	would you say that there is very little hope of recovering it?
2006-09-22T10:33:00.000Z	kitche	redblades	yeah
