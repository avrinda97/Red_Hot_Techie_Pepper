2011-10-05T19:13:00.000Z	cantonic		hey guys. anyone here experienced in using virtual machines on ubuntu server?
2011-10-05T19:13:00.000Z	cantonic		i cannot get a virtual machine to run in vnc mode
2011-10-05T19:13:00.000Z	cantonic		i think i do something wrong in the network settings
2011-10-05T19:15:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	what software are you using to virtualize?
2011-10-05T19:18:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	I have no experience with kvm, so I'm not your guy. sry mate
2011-10-05T19:18:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	no problem. thank you very much anyways :)
2011-10-05T19:26:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	I'm almost certain kvm will give you direct access to the VM screen without remotely connecting directly to the client
2011-10-05T19:27:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	yeah, but i don't want to install a gui on the ubuntu server
2011-10-05T19:29:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	you're not stuck , and you don't need a gui
2011-10-05T19:29:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	no?
2011-10-05T19:29:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	gimme a second, why would you ruin a great server setup with a resource hog
2011-10-05T19:30:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	ok :) i am excited to see an alternative way.
2011-10-05T19:35:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	give me half an hour, the internet connection on this train is horrid. I'll get back to you as soon as I get home
2011-10-05T19:36:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	wow, thank you for your time man :)
2011-10-05T19:36:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	this is what I'll try when home: http://www.linux-kvm.com/content/tip-how-run-headless-guest-machine-using-vnc-kvm
2011-10-05T19:37:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	ok, i will read through this. thank you
2011-10-05T19:38:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	that is what i already tried but compdoc said that i cannot use vnc to connect to windows because vnc is not active by default
2011-10-05T19:40:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	this is outside of the vm. so it will work. it is not client dependant
2011-10-05T19:41:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	but look what melvincv said
2011-10-05T19:42:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	you guys dont realize it is transferring the screen of the vm. just be patient. itll work
2011-10-05T19:46:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	just wait 10 more minutes. may i pm you once i return?
2011-10-05T19:46:00.000Z	cantonic	fmauro	yeah of course. i am really thankful for your help
2011-10-05T19:59:00.000Z	fmauro	cantonic	alright, re. I'll pm you then
