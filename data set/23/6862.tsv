2007-02-23T13:58:00.000Z	mau		hey guys.  any ideas on how to get an optical sound port to work?
2007-02-23T13:58:00.000Z	mau		analog works
2007-02-23T13:58:00.000Z	mau		no luck with digital:(
2007-02-23T13:59:00.000Z	macd	mau	you should be able to use alsaconf and select the spdif output.
2007-02-23T14:00:00.000Z	mau	macd	i'm looking at a fiber channel... not spidif
2007-02-23T14:01:00.000Z	macd	mau	your trying to use the optical output?
2007-02-23T14:01:00.000Z	macd	mau	that is spdif ;)
2007-02-23T14:02:00.000Z	macd	mau	and yes, alsaconf is console.
2007-02-23T14:02:00.000Z	mau	macd	ha... thanks.. I used to seeing units with both a spdif (looks like rca) and optical (fiber channel)
2007-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	macd	mau	yeah the RCa looking one is called coaxial digital, optical is spdif
2007-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	mau	macd	so how do I use the command?  I'm pretty new to console
2007-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	macd	mau	in console type "alsaconf"
2007-02-23T14:04:00.000Z	macd	mau	sudo apt-get install alsaconf
2007-02-23T14:05:00.000Z	macd	mau	disregard that, let me find the package that includes that
2007-02-23T14:05:00.000Z	macd	mau	sudo apt-get install alsa-utils-gui (then you should have the guified version)
2007-02-23T14:05:00.000Z	mau	macd	that you so much for the helping hand
2007-02-23T14:23:00.000Z	macd	mau	sudo nano /etc/apt/source.list
2007-02-23T14:24:00.000Z	mau	macd	what is nano?
2007-02-23T14:25:00.000Z	macd	mau	a texteditor.
2007-02-23T14:25:00.000Z	macd	mau	when in doubt type "man <commandhere> to find out what it is
2007-02-23T14:26:00.000Z	mau	macd	oooh... thanks
2007-02-23T14:30:00.000Z	mau	macd	got my spdif to work... you rock
2007-02-23T14:31:00.000Z	macd	mau	cool, glad to hear it.
