2009-03-12T09:48:00.000Z	tech0007	|Kamen|	'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dosbox'
2009-03-12T09:50:00.000Z	|Kamen|	tech0007	ok that worked. so its in the repos just not showing up in synaptic?
2009-03-12T09:50:00.000Z	tech0007	|Kamen|	you have to update first before you grab packages from the repo
2009-03-12T09:51:00.000Z	tech0007	|Kamen|	that''s why I like CLI better that gui
