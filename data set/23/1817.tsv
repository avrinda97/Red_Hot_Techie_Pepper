2009-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	datz_		can someone help me fix my my ssh config, PrintLastLog is on, yet last logon is not printed
2009-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	restarted ssh ?
2009-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	yep, it's been this way for awhile
2009-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	try choosing remove from panel, then add it manually?
2009-11-16T09:38:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	I didn't see it there, let me check again
2009-11-16T09:39:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	I can't find it, in the add to panel selection
2009-11-16T09:39:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	maybe you need to add it from the package manager
2009-11-16T09:40:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	I'll check, I've already added gnome applets
2009-11-16T09:55:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	it worked right after install, but I installed a bunch of software and it stopped working
2009-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	I can't find it.
2009-11-16T09:45:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	i think its called fast-user-switch-applet
2009-11-16T09:46:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	thanks, I'm not sure how to get it.
2009-11-16T09:47:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	you have that package installed in the package manager?
2009-11-16T09:47:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	I did a search in the package manager, that string didn't turn anything up
2009-11-16T09:47:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	i think it doesnt like minuses
2009-11-16T09:50:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	http://pastebin.com/m1a4c6f55
2009-11-16T09:51:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	try installing ubuntu-desktop package
2009-11-16T09:54:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	should the applet be added after installing ubuntu-desktop?
2009-11-16T09:54:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	I still don't see it
2009-11-16T09:55:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	i would think it should, but not sure, some people say its a very recent bug that its not in the repos correctly
2009-11-16T09:55:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	ok
2009-11-16T09:56:00.000Z	Billiard	datz_	idk, maybe it will be fixed after some updates
2009-11-16T09:57:00.000Z	datz_	Billiard	ok, I guess I'll look for it after some updates, maybe I shouldn't have deleted it
