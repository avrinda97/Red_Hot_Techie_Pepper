2006-11-02T13:42:00.000Z	amir		question, what does sudo mean?
2006-11-02T13:42:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	It's a command to run things as root
2006-11-02T13:42:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	"man sudo" for more
2006-11-02T13:44:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	Specifically, telling it to do something as root.
2006-11-02T13:44:00.000Z	amir	fgxn	another newb question.... root means?
2006-11-02T13:44:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	If you type "foo" at the command line, it runs the program foo. If you type "sudo foo", it runs the command foo as if root were the one running it.
2006-11-02T13:44:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	The root account is the all-powerful, administrative account.
2006-11-02T13:45:00.000Z	amir	fgxn	what about apt-get?
2006-11-02T13:46:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	...
2006-11-02T13:46:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	Type "man apt-get" into your console and read
2006-11-02T13:46:00.000Z	amir	fgxn	sorry about this, I am curious by nature
2006-11-02T13:46:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	It's ok to be curious, but it's good to do some of the work on your own as well.
2006-11-02T13:47:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	It doesn't make sense for me to transcribe manpages into #ubuntu
2006-11-02T13:47:00.000Z	fgxn	amir	You can use "man <any command at all>" to get info on it
