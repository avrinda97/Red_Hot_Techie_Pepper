2009-03-01T22:42:00.000Z	storbeck	hunt577	what is your router called?
2009-03-01T22:45:00.000Z	hunt577	storbeck	its asking me for a password but it won't let me type anything
2009-03-01T22:45:00.000Z	storbeck	hunt577	It lets you type : ) it's just invisible
2009-03-01T22:48:00.000Z	hunt577	storbeck	it comes up says "No DHCPOFFERS received.:  :No working leases in persistent database - sleeping"
2009-03-01T22:48:00.000Z	storbeck	hunt577	Do you have encryption turned on?
2009-03-01T22:48:00.000Z	hunt577	storbeck	where do I turn that on at?
2009-03-01T22:49:00.000Z	storbeck	hunt577	How close are you to the router?
2009-03-01T22:50:00.000Z	storbeck	hunt577	Does your laptop have a wireless switch? I know I've spent hours troubleshooting before my wifi switch was turned off :P
2009-03-01T22:50:00.000Z	hunt577	storbeck	it has a button on the top of the laptop for wireless but when I click on it nothing happens
2009-03-01T22:51:00.000Z	storbeck	hunt577	What driver are you using?
2009-03-01T22:51:00.000Z	hunt577	storbeck	how do I determine that?
