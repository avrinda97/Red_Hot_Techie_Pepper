2010-11-13T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	if you don't answer questions, it's pretty hard to help you
2010-11-13T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	is this sharing between guest and host?
2010-11-13T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	so just right click on a folder in nautilus, share
2010-11-13T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	the default file manager in ubuntu
2010-11-13T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	that does it with samba
2010-11-13T16:38:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	I just told you how to do it by clicking on things.  Did that not work?
2010-11-13T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	yeah, you should see the sharing in windows too
2010-11-13T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	I have no clue, ask ##windows
2010-11-13T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	or maybe even #samba
2010-11-13T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	this isn't what you said you wanted to do... :/
2010-11-13T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	everyrainyday	#vmware can help you share between guest and host
