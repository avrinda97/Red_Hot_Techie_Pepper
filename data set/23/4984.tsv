2007-03-22T10:36:00.000Z	Moreau		anyone know how to access another partition, i just started with fedora and i cant figure out how to get to the other partition
2007-03-22T10:36:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- u have to mount the partition to be able to access it
2007-03-22T10:37:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- try this.. dc to you /mnt folder, sudo mkdir otherdrive
2007-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- then sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hd? (other drive letter there/part there)  /mnt/otherdrive
2007-03-22T10:39:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- search for mount drives or something similar in the ubuntu forums
2007-03-22T10:41:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- basically what u have to do is create a mount pt for the other drive/partition u want to access
2007-03-22T10:41:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- then mount the drive, then its accessible
2007-03-22T10:41:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- i was just giving u the commands for it, to try it out...
2007-03-22T10:44:00.000Z	Moreau	mkquist	how do i make myself the root in the terminal
2007-03-22T10:44:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- use sudo before the command
2007-03-22T10:44:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- or use what Chap just said..lol
2007-03-22T10:46:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- when u try to sudo?
2007-03-22T10:48:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- what did u type? --curious
2007-03-22T10:49:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- space between hda1 and /mnt i think would help ur saying mount type this here...
2007-03-22T10:53:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- any luck?
2007-03-22T10:58:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- whut happened?
2007-03-22T10:58:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- how do u know its destroyed?
2007-03-22T11:00:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- sry did u fdisk -l and make sure u have right part?
2007-03-22T11:01:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- and the error can come up for a few reasons, that dont mean part is dead
2007-03-22T11:01:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- not necessarily
2007-03-22T11:05:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- you still might wanna check make sure ur mount is good and everythings set right b4 giving up on the partition
2007-03-22T11:06:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- if you have or can d/l a copy of Knoppix, itll auto mount anything it can from live cd
2007-03-22T11:06:00.000Z	mkquist	Moreau	- and let you see whats good w/no console or terminal commands
