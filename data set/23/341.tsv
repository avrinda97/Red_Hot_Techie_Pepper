2011-12-13T03:06:00.000Z	Pessimism		If I install a program with apt-get, where is it supposed to be available in the newest version of Ubuntu?
2011-12-13T03:08:00.000Z	Pessimism		I am trying to find the executable for cree.py: http://ilektrojohn.github.com/creepy/.
2011-12-13T03:08:00.000Z	Pessimism		source at https://github.com/ilektrojohn/creepy
2011-12-13T03:08:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Try "whereis $program_name".
2011-12-13T03:08:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	That's a python file, which is not a binary.
2011-12-13T03:11:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	You have to be in the same directory as cree.py.
2011-12-13T03:14:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	cree.py is, as I recall, a graphical program. I remember checking it out to teach my grade school kids about internet stalkers.  Anyway, do you notice a graphical window popping up **underneath** your console window?
2011-12-13T03:16:00.000Z	Pessimism	kkerwin	It is a graphical program, yes. But nothing happens.
2011-12-13T03:16:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Got an idea.
2011-12-13T03:17:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	You're running this with sudo, right?
2011-12-13T03:17:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Try this: DISPLAY=:0 python ./cree.py
2011-12-13T03:17:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Pardon: DISPLAY=:0 sudo python ./cree.py
2011-12-13T03:18:00.000Z	Pessimism	kkerwin	Nothing happens. By the look of it.
2011-12-13T03:18:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Try switching the order of display and sudo, ie: sudo DISPLAY=:0 python ./cree.py
2011-12-13T03:19:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Ok. I have another idea. Give me a second to make sure I get the command right ...
2011-12-13T03:19:00.000Z	Pessimism	kkerwin	Thanks. Appreciate it.
2011-12-13T03:20:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Ok. Hit Alt-F2. Type "gksudo". A window should pop up. Type "python /path/to/dir/cree.py".
2011-12-13T03:21:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Ooops. It's Alt-F2. Type "gksudo python /path/to/dir/cree.py". Then type your passwd in the next window.
2011-12-13T03:22:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	not sure what you mean there.
2011-12-13T03:22:00.000Z	Pessimism	kkerwin	I am suddenly in a DOS-like interface
2011-12-13T03:23:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Oh. You must have hit Ctrl-Alt-F2 instead of just Alt-F2.
2011-12-13T03:23:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Hit Alt-F7 to get back.
2011-12-13T03:24:00.000Z	kkerwin	Pessimism	Ok. Well, I'm spent on ideas, then. Sorry.
