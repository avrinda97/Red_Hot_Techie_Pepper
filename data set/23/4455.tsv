2007-08-08T10:32:00.000Z	ZAKhan		i have installed ubuntu for the first time and using a samsung TV/Monitor .. i get 1024x786 where as the native resolution of my monitor is 1366 x 768, can someone please help me fix it?
2007-08-08T10:33:00.000Z	rimose	ZAKhan	you have to create a modeline for your television.
2007-08-08T10:33:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	: how to do that?
2007-08-08T10:33:00.000Z	rimose	ZAKhan	if you still have the manual for your television, it should have the modeline in it somewhere.
2007-08-08T10:33:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	yes its HDTV
2007-08-08T10:34:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	OH hum lemme go thru my manuals
2007-08-08T10:34:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	is it possible to get it from the net somewhere?

2007-08-08T10:36:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	thanks
2007-08-08T10:41:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	I found the manual .. looking thru I see only resolution, horz (khz), vert(khz), pixel cloack freq (mhz) .. thats all
2007-08-08T10:43:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	hehe sorry but there are more variables required on that page
2007-08-08T10:43:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	wats Horizontal Sync Rate?
2007-08-08T10:45:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	 is Horz Freq = Horz Sync?
2007-08-08T10:47:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	i only have one Horz ans Vert sync .. so i put them in MIN right?
2007-08-08T10:49:00.000Z	ZAKhan	rimose	ok thanks i will try it and thencome back once done ..
