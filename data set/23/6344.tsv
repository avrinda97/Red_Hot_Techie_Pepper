2006-12-07T17:41:00.000Z	Cubed		tar is for... compiling?
2006-12-07T17:41:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	tar is an archive, it generally contains source code. You should normally prefer to do everything via apt-get, aptitude or synaptic.
2006-12-07T17:42:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	The whole point of using packages is that you can remove the whole thing without creating dependency issues.
2006-12-07T17:43:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	Where are you getting your stuff from?
2006-12-07T17:44:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	So, lemmie get this straight, you have a Ubuntu install and you're trying to do what?
2006-12-07T17:44:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	Ah.
2006-12-07T17:44:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	So, your only connectivity is wireless?
2006-12-07T17:44:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	On what wireless device?
2006-12-07T17:45:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	Then the ndiswappers from memory are not for you. Lemmie check.
2006-12-07T17:46:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	dpkg -i {deb}
2006-12-07T17:47:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	Which version of Ubuntu are you running?
2006-12-07T17:48:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	Read this: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/32275
2006-12-07T17:49:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	Also: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2781.html
2006-12-07T17:50:00.000Z	owh	Cubed	It appears as if ndiswrapper is the way after all. I hadn't seen an external device that needed it, only internal. I was wrong.
