2010-05-08T20:56:00.000Z	icedwater	zipper	Ah, I see.

2010-05-08T20:57:00.000Z	icedwater	zipper	Where did you download it to?
2010-05-08T21:00:00.000Z	icedwater	zipper	How did you 'install' it?
2010-05-08T21:00:00.000Z	zipper	icedwater	i used wget
2010-05-08T21:03:00.000Z	icedwater	zipper	Then you've just downloaded it. Where did you run the wget command?
2010-05-08T21:04:00.000Z	zipper	icedwater	ON TERMINAL I AM NOT WANTING TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FOR CHRIST SAKE I HAV ALREADY INSTALLED IT MOVE ON WITH HOW DO I DOWNLOAD IT NOW MY QUESTION IS HOW TO I LOCATE IT BECAUSE I CAN'T
2010-05-08T21:04:00.000Z	icedwater	zipper	relax. I meant which directory.
2010-05-08T21:05:00.000Z	icedwater	zipper	Also, you should be able to tell the difference between installing and downloading. wget only does the downloading and not the installing.
