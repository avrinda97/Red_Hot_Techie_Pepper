2006-06-04T06:02:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	please use a PM when playing with ubotu like that.
2006-06-04T06:02:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	what do you mean?
2006-06-04T06:04:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	install the lynx package!
2006-06-04T06:31:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	how'd it fail?
2006-06-04T06:32:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	it says  error encountered while processing flashplugin-nonfree, dapper: Fatal IO error 9 (bad file descriptor) on X server: 0.0.
2006-06-04T06:32:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	last time this happened X wouldn't start after reboot
2006-06-04T06:33:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	because the upgrade didn't complete...
2006-06-04T06:33:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	ok how can I fix the problem and carry on with the upgrade?
2006-06-04T06:33:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	sudo aptitude remove flashplugin-nonfree.
2006-06-04T06:33:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	then retry the upgrade.
2006-06-04T06:42:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	I removed the flashplugin-nonfree, but when I try to upgrade, it says system is uptodate, I'm almost sure if I restart, X will fail, is there a way to test that and fix it without restarting x and failing?
2006-06-04T06:43:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	you can restart X...
2006-06-04T06:44:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	yeah but if X fails! I'll be stuck in console without help!
2006-06-04T06:44:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	true.
2006-06-04T06:44:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	it might be advisable to have a Live CD around.
2006-06-04T06:44:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	do as Jowi says.
2006-06-04T06:51:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	would I be able to fix X problem on a Dapper install from within Breezy live CD?
2006-06-04T06:51:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	probably.
2006-06-04T06:52:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	ok ... I try restarting and if X fails, I'll use the live CD
2006-06-04T07:02:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	it worked :P !!!!
2006-06-04T07:02:00.000Z	abo	Fujitsu	thanks :)  now back to installing all my apps
2006-06-04T07:13:00.000Z	Fujitsu	abo	generally.
