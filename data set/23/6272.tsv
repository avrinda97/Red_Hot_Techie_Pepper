2006-05-22T10:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	Karim just said that
2006-05-22T10:30:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	any suggestions? *hate not knowing what to do*
2006-05-22T10:42:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	 what was the command u told me before
2006-05-22T10:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	what are you trying to do?
2006-05-22T10:44:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	still working on the mouse
2006-05-22T10:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   but kind of depends on what is wrong with mouse
2006-05-22T10:59:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	did u get my msg?
2006-05-22T11:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	you have to be registered and identified before you can pm anyone and its a good idea to ask first
2006-05-22T11:00:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	the problem i have is that i dont want to use the mousepad. i  want to install my usb optical but he cant identify it.
2006-05-22T11:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	does it work?
2006-05-22T11:18:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	ok. now back to the problem. as i wanted to use my usb mouse instead of the mouse pad. he identify it as unknown device/unknown usb device.
2006-05-22T11:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	no matter what it is identified as does it work?
2006-05-22T11:18:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	nopes
2006-05-22T11:19:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	but then.. i had similar problem in windows. i had to disable the mousepad first.
2006-05-22T11:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	is this on a laptop?
2006-05-22T11:19:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	yes
2006-05-22T11:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	almenfors	i dont know i dont use laptops
2006-05-22T11:20:00.000Z	almenfors	gnomefreak	np ty for trying =)
