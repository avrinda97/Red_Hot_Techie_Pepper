2012-05-20T23:13:00.000Z	remlabm2	jagginess	what did you need from the X -configure?
2012-05-20T23:14:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	that command makes the sample xorg file in /root
2012-05-20T23:15:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	run that command as the superuser
2012-05-20T23:15:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	superuser's home is "/root"
2012-05-20T23:15:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	so pastebin the sample file
2012-05-20T23:16:00.000Z	remlabm2	jagginess	didnt work, ways , Configuration Failed
2012-05-20T23:21:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	that's fine.. it still made a full xorg sample file
2012-05-20T23:21:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	did you pastebin it
2012-05-20T23:23:00.000Z	remlabm2	jagginess	i cant find it to pastebin it... there is nothing in /root that says xorg
2012-05-20T23:24:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	did you type "find /root"  ?
2012-05-20T23:24:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	did you stop lightdm first?
2012-05-20T23:25:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	did you run as user root? (not sudo)
2012-05-20T23:27:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	still waiting..
2012-05-20T23:29:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	back up /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf_bak00
2012-05-20T23:29:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	then cp /root/<sample> to /etc/X11/xorg.conf .. now edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change "nouveau" to "nvidia", stop lightdm, start lightdm.. see what happens..
2012-05-20T23:34:00.000Z	remlabm2	jagginess	started lightdm, get the resolutio error, only 1 monitor
2012-05-20T23:35:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	do you have "nvidia" for Card0 and Card1 ?
2012-05-20T23:37:00.000Z	remlabm2	jagginess	i did, there has to be something else going on here, its showing 2 gfx cards and 4 monitors in this config
2012-05-20T23:54:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	this is the first attempt to get it to work.. you can scratch the previous attempts because your ServerLayout section previously was wrong.. you only had 1 monitor mentioned in it
2012-05-20T23:55:00.000Z	remlabm2	jagginess	what do you recommend next then?
2012-05-20T23:59:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	what xorg.conf config are you using? did you try both Card0 and Card1 with "nvidia" ?
2012-05-21T00:03:00.000Z	remlabm2	jagginess	it is only showing one card and yes its nvidia
2012-05-21T00:03:00.000Z	jagginess	remlabm2	i think you should stick with 1 of the drivers and work on it.. if you can't get nvidia to work, lemme know, and then we can try nouveau.. i haven't been on more than 1 minute about this because i never got any feedback if you edited both Card0 and Card1 to nvidia
