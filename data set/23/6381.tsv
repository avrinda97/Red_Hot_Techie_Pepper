2009-04-30T16:45:00.000Z	coz_		or cs4
2009-04-30T16:45:00.000Z	ali4ever		J- , i would like to but thats not for me for a photoshop designer
2009-04-30T16:46:00.000Z	ali4ever		coz , well the guy is used to use photoshop 7 (very old) but meight be i will make him move to other version
2009-04-30T16:46:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	 then there should be no issue installing it   I think cs3  even installs with wine now let me google hold on
2009-04-30T16:46:00.000Z	ali4ever		J- ,  it currently on windows photoshop 7 is used by him, but i meight convice him of changing the version
2009-04-30T16:47:00.000Z	ali4ever		coz, that would be very nice
2009-04-30T16:47:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	here is a link for cs2  let me look for cs1 and cs3  http://luiscosio.com/how-to-adobe-photoshop-cs2-on-ubuntu-10-steps
2009-04-30T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	 here is a general  photoshop install  http://lifehacker.com/software/photoshop/how-to-install-photoshop-on-ubuntu-206827.php
2009-04-30T16:48:00.000Z	ali4ever		coz, thanks very much
2009-04-30T16:48:00.000Z	ali4ever		j-, thanks alot
2009-04-30T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	 you will find however .  since gimp now has cmyk support that it is worth working with
2009-04-30T16:49:00.000Z	ali4ever	hil	thank you , all of you been very helpful
2009-04-30T16:49:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	  although no photoshop plugins can really be used with gimp  it is still worth the effort  along with inkscape for vector images
2009-04-30T16:49:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	  i woujld go as far as to say that inkscape  surpasses adobe  illustrator in many ways
2009-04-30T16:49:00.000Z	ali4ever		coz, i will show him gimp but i don't think he is kind of guy who will change photoshop (he is still using photoshop 7 cause he didnt like changes)
2009-04-30T16:50:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	 I understand   and gimp will impose a learning curve even if he wants to try it
2009-04-30T16:50:00.000Z	ali4ever		coz, i see
2009-04-30T16:50:00.000Z	ali4ever		coz, thanks for the advices
2009-04-30T16:51:00.000Z	coz_	ali4ever	 no problem    however again if you or he is interested in vector illustration I would move over to inkscape  for windows or linux
