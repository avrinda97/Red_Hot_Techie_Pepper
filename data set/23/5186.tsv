2007-03-03T15:24:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	you mean Game support? A person who plays games is a Gamer. But yes, there is.
2007-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	_`XeOn_	AlexC_	so where i get support for making Call of Duty run?
2007-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	look into Cedega or Wine

2007-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	there are loads.
2007-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	_`XeOn_	AlexC_	for my expecific issue
2007-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	you never said about an issue/problem
2007-03-03T15:26:00.000Z	_`XeOn_	AlexC_	should be simple but i cant find the way
2007-03-03T15:27:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	well if you wont tell me the problem, I cant help...
2007-03-03T15:28:00.000Z	_`XeOn_	AlexC_	game is installed as in loki installation guide said but when i run game it says wine(x)/cedega not in PATH
2007-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	what folder?
2007-03-17T12:21:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	why say folder then :P
2007-03-17T12:21:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	but like eck said - do not chmod /usr/bin
2007-03-17T12:22:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	actually ... why is a document in /usr/bin?? would a document normally be in you're home folder
2007-03-17T12:23:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	then to edit it, in terminal do gksudo gedit /usr/bin/eggdrop.cof ... doh PirateHead beat me!
2007-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	keep the config file where it is for now - but just edit it
2007-03-17T12:27:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	you're best of not moving the config file. But just edit it with "gksudo gedit /usr/bin/eggdrop.conf"
2007-03-17T12:33:00.000Z	AlexC_	_`XeOn_	you could install Blootbot - another IRC bot,
