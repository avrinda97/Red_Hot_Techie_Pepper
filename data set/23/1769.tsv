2010-07-27T01:23:00.000Z	hylian		alt grabs the entire window. and just drag and drop makes a copy, not a link
2010-07-27T01:25:00.000Z	hylian		i'm trying to make a link to some documents without it always adding "link to xyz.doc"
2010-07-27T01:25:00.000Z	hylian		in other words i just want it to say "xyz.doc" not 'link to'
2010-07-27T01:26:00.000Z	hylian		i mean by default, because i might be making a mass amount of links here.
2010-07-27T01:27:00.000Z	hylian		why would ubuntu add what msft realized 10 years ago was a bad idea?
2010-07-27T01:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	certainly using ln from command line doesn't add the "link to..." part
2010-07-27T01:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	rename them after
2010-07-27T01:30:00.000Z	hylian	ZykoticK9	renaming 1003 documents afterwards is a pain.
2010-07-27T01:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	1000+ links, really?  why?
2010-07-27T01:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	sure from command line ;)
2010-07-27T01:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	GUI is the hard way in most cases ;)
2010-07-27T02:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	Crossover (commercial wine)
2010-07-27T02:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	why are you suggesting that?  ennui can see the drive in OSX obviously if they can turn journalling on/off
2010-07-27T02:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	your testdisk/photorec suggestion is a good one
2010-07-27T03:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	oh it's available!
2011-06-24T21:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	is this a read vs write issue?
2011-06-24T21:03:00.000Z	hylian	ZykoticK9	well, it was just writing. no i know read speeds are faster.
2011-06-24T21:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	ok, just checking
2011-06-24T21:03:00.000Z	hylian	ZykoticK9	thanks for helping!
2011-06-28T06:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	FYI openbox is a windows manager.  Why do you want only a terminal?
2011-06-28T06:40:00.000Z	hylian	ZykoticK9	actually the option to boot to xterm already exists. I just find it lacking in easy access to controls. That's why I like gnome-terminal
2011-06-28T06:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hylian	buy WHY do you want only a terminal?
2011-06-28T06:42:00.000Z	hylian	ZykoticK9	well, i do a  lot of stuff cli, but now and again i use an x app, like xlinks.
