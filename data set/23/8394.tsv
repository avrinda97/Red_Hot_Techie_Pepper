2004-10-31T16:51:00.000Z	sanitario		this is what I get when I try to boot with linux-image-2.6.8.1-3-686: Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)
2004-10-31T16:52:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	sounds like the initrd wasn't set up
2004-10-31T16:52:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	yeah, it does
2004-10-31T16:52:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	I just did apt-get install
2004-10-31T16:54:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	yes
2004-10-31T16:54:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	if you're using grub, I think you need to make sure that all the requisite options are in the commented # kopt line in menu.lst, otherwise update-grub doesn't know what options to put in
2004-10-31T16:54:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	for now try booting with root=/dev/hda1 or wherever it actually is
2004-10-31T16:55:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	I'll try to install itagain, it might have been fixed since yesterday I guess...
2004-10-31T16:55:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	and in other case try the root-option
2004-10-31T16:56:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	the kopt looks fine
2004-10-31T16:56:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	and the root too
2004-11-23T10:36:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	do you know anything about when ubuntu-calender-november will appear?
2004-11-23T10:36:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	I thought it already had
2004-11-23T10:37:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	hm... weirdness...
2004-11-23T10:37:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	note that addressing individual developers about stuff you don't know to be in their sphere of interest is generally a bad idea, though :)
2004-11-23T10:37:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	I think it's in warty-updates, which may not be in your sources.list by default
2004-11-23T10:37:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	yeah, I know, sorry
2004-11-23T10:38:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	oh, thanks for the tip
2005-04-19T13:13:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	doh
2005-04-19T13:13:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	it's not the default
2005-04-19T13:14:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	it's not even the one called Human circle of friends? How can I install it?
2005-04-19T13:17:00.000Z	Kamion	sanitario	that's the right one, the thumbnail's just wrong (last-minute glitch)
2005-04-19T13:18:00.000Z	sanitario	Kamion	oh, that's why, thanks a lot
