2009-07-23T18:57:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	it has pushed some programs out to swap to make room for file system cache.  In other words it sees that there are files that you are accessing more frequently than the programs, so it puts some programs into swap and keeps the files in memory instead to speed things up
2009-07-23T18:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	the boot time is getting slower?
2009-07-23T18:59:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	yes, also.
2009-07-23T18:59:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	that is not normal.  Have you installed extra services since the initial install?
2009-07-23T19:00:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	oh yeah. for example, i was playing around with sendmail. i got the sendmail package, then got rid of it again, yet every time i boot the graphical boot progress bar stops for a second, goes into text mode (showing whats going on right now), says that the mail transfer agent (MTA) is starting up. this takes like an extra 15+ seconds.
2009-07-23T19:02:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	it still trying to start sendmail after the removal.  Odd. Let's make sure it's completely gone: dpkg -l | grep mail
2009-07-23T19:02:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	does it show anything when you run that in a terminal?
2009-07-23T19:02:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	oh yes
2009-07-23T19:02:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	like 20 lines
2009-07-23T19:04:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	do they all start with "ii" or do some say "rc" ?
2009-07-23T19:06:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	some have rc
2009-07-23T19:07:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	mostly ii though
2009-07-23T19:09:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	does sendmail show as "ii"?
2009-07-23T19:09:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	i got sendmail-base -bin and -cf, all are ii
2009-07-23T19:10:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	"sudo aptitude purge" them to completely uninstall them
2009-07-23T19:12:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	it said nothing got uninstalled
2009-07-23T19:14:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	"sudo aptitude purge  sendmail-base sendmail-bin sendmail-cf" said nothing removed?
2009-07-23T19:17:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	ok now theyre gone
2009-07-23T19:18:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	but the system is still kinda running slow. what else could i do?
2009-07-23T19:18:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	ok, so that might help speed boot time, but that won't make the netbook that much faster overall.
2009-07-23T19:19:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	yeah exactly
2009-07-23T19:20:00.000Z	Cube	mbeierl	sash_: also, the battery life is significantly slower than the promised 9.5h. even without bluetooth, wifi, cpu underclocked, low brightness no sound i never even get 6h
2009-07-23T19:21:00.000Z	mbeierl	Cube	I don't have a netbook, so I can't say for sure what to do there...
