2012-08-07T22:49:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	Did the shutdown occur in the middle of the upgrade?
2012-08-07T22:50:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	yes , one of my friend just shut down , he was not aware that upgrade is going on :(
2012-08-07T22:50:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	now the system   freezes at seemingly random points and leaves me with only a cursor
2012-08-07T22:51:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	it would be wise to backup, format the Ubuntu partition and reinstall from scratch, the system might have been left in an unstable state with mixed packages from the old and the new version
2012-08-07T22:52:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	its the worst case scenario ! its not possible to recover it !?
2012-08-07T22:54:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	It would be difficult as you would need to examine the installation logs (I think they should be in /var/log/installer, don't remember the exact directory), then see which packages were upgraded and which ones were not, install the missing packages (paying attention to the dependencies)... There is a thing you could try though:
2012-08-07T22:55:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	but how to do ? dint know the procedure !
2012-08-07T22:56:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	edit /etc/apt/sources.list, edit all lines so that the distribution is "precise" and run "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" - it's extremely risky though and it's only a temporary solution.
2012-08-07T22:56:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	Better to backup and reinstall from scratch.
2012-08-07T22:57:00.000Z	ajnr		how to backup ? elgaton
2012-08-07T23:00:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	is it possible to get the terminal
2012-08-07T23:00:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	otherwise its not possible to get backup my data !
2012-08-07T23:00:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	Start the system from a live CD, then connect an external drive/USB key. Open a terminal and type "cd <path to old home dir on disk> && tar -pczf <path to external drive>/backup.tar.gz ."
2012-08-07T23:01:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	That will backup ALL the contents in your home directory to a file named backup.tar.gz on your external drive.
2012-08-07T23:01:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	You could try to type Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get the terminal, don't know if it will work though
2012-08-07T23:01:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	its not coming ! i tried it
2012-08-07T23:02:00.000Z	elgaton	ajnr	Then the system is definitely not working, the only solution is booting from a live CD and use the terminal from there.
2012-08-07T23:02:00.000Z	ajnr	elgaton	okk !
