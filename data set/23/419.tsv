2011-09-18T01:40:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	of course.
2011-09-18T01:41:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	but i follow according to the xmbc installation wiki i'm unable to dl it
2011-09-18T01:41:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	Can you show me the instructions you are using?
2011-09-18T01:41:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Installing_XBMC_for_Linux
2011-09-18T01:42:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	I'm running it successfully, and was using it about 10 minutes ago.  Let me take a look at how they want you to do it.
2011-09-18T01:42:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-xbmc > ...
2011-09-18T01:43:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	What do you mean? What happens when you run that?
2011-09-18T01:44:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	it successful added into the repo, but when i sudo apt-get update
2011-09-18T01:44:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	i get "w: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found"
2011-09-18T01:45:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	Ah.. I see.
2011-09-18T01:47:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	Okay. It looks like they've not built packages for natty in that ppa.  I'm using their unstable PPA with success on my htpc.
2011-09-18T01:47:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	how would I get the unstable PPA ?
2011-09-18T01:47:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	macer1: The unstable PPA sometimes gives me a package that doesn't work, installing a ppa meant for a different release might give you more serious problems.
2011-09-18T01:48:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	remove file that the command you ran created, it should be as simple as: sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/team-xbmc-*.list
2011-09-18T01:49:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	Once you've done that, just run: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-xbmc/unstable
2011-09-18T01:50:00.000Z	Pici	djbox	after that, you can do apt-get update and follow the rest of the instructions.
2011-09-18T01:52:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	thanks ~ i wish i can buy you a coffee right now.
2011-09-18T01:59:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	 one more thing  ' this operation, 98.0 MB of additional disk space will be used.Do you want to continue [Y/n]' I hit y and nothing happen
2011-09-18T02:00:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	never mind. It's working now. thats strange
2011-09-18T02:16:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	it ran slow the XBMC
2011-09-18T02:16:00.000Z	djbox	Pici	is there any way make it run smoothly?
