2008-07-30T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	sudo apt-get install mythtv
2008-08-16T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	see the walkthroughs from ubottu
2008-08-16T19:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	sudo apt-get install libc
2008-08-16T19:23:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	the terminal says can't find package libc!
2008-08-16T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	can we get a pastebin of the output about libc missing?
2008-10-26T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	is there a hidden file in ~/ named .vlc
2009-03-05T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	the router you buy doesnt matter as they all adhere to the ISO standards, its only the device in your system you have to worry about
2009-03-05T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	as long as your OS can interact with your wireless in your systems then they will interfcae with ANY router you buy
2009-03-05T18:07:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	This is my first time for me with ADSL I haven't installed the ADSL sevice so i don't know who to set it up. As i understood from you, that i only have to put the telephone line inside the LinkSys wireless mode (router) and then my desktop that has a D-Link wireless card will take internet from the router, right?
2009-03-05T18:07:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	I still use Dial-u
2009-03-05T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	you may have to configure an account with may require a windows system, if the account is premade you can apply your settings to the router and it will connect
2009-03-05T18:08:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	so I don't have to connect the router with the PC?
2009-03-05T18:09:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	What account?
2009-03-05T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	it varies with providers, if you have to setup an account then they will assume windows and you may have to use a windows system to setup the initial account. But as the connection between linux and the router you can use anything at all
2009-03-05T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	when you get adsl yu buy an acount and an IP address, this will need aplying to your router of choice
2009-03-05T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	ive told you before, yuo MAY have to. It depends on the provider
2009-03-05T18:10:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	that's right, in my country when we buy ADSL they give us username and password and phone number to connect. So where to put these, in Windows?
2009-03-05T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	no, you put those in your router
2009-03-05T18:11:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	aha, and to put these configurations in my router i might need windows. Right?
2009-03-05T18:12:00.000Z	rockyrock	ActionParsnip	cuz the router software might only support windows?
2009-03-05T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	no, the account setup software may be windows only
2009-03-05T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rockyrock	the router itself and configuring it will be done via a web browser so will be doable from ANY system
