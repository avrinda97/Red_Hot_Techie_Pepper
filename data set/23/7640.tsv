2005-06-03T12:52:00.000Z	psychonate		yeah, if you run mplayer from the CL, it will give you some output
2005-06-03T12:54:00.000Z	psychonate		mplayer CL > * ;)
2005-06-03T12:54:00.000Z	psychonate		although I have problems with the mplayer packaged with ubuntu
2005-06-03T12:55:00.000Z	toshiba_	psychonate	mplayer CL?
2005-06-03T12:55:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	CL=Command Line
2005-06-03T12:55:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	ran from terminal; no GUI
2005-06-03T12:55:00.000Z	toshiba_		we're talking about the blue-skinned mplayer w/ the unremovable 'Mplayer - Video' window, right?
2005-06-03T12:56:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	no
2005-06-03T12:58:00.000Z	psychonate		tcprobe is a neato tool
2005-06-03T12:58:00.000Z	toshiba_		So um.. any ideas why VLC shows video w/o sound?
2005-06-03T12:58:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	what is the audio?
2005-06-03T12:58:00.000Z	toshiba_	psychonate	you mean, what codec was used w/ the audio? no idea....
2005-06-03T13:01:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	I would try to install all the gstreamer packages. Those might help some players.
2005-06-03T13:01:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	at least this one: gstreamer0.8-ffmpeg
2005-06-03T13:02:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	from the everyday usage guide: "Not all mpgs are created equal. If you are getting sound but no video with some mpgs, you probably need the ffmpeg libraries."
2005-06-03T13:03:00.000Z	psychonate		we believe you
2005-06-03T13:04:00.000Z	toshiba_	psychonate	thanks alot.
2005-06-03T13:05:00.000Z	toshiba_		Anyone knows how to be 'the owner' (ie: so you can change certain folders/files properties)
2005-06-03T13:06:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	tell me if it works alright
2005-06-03T13:06:00.000Z	psychonate		personally, I like mplayer with the additional codecs from their site
2005-06-03T13:08:00.000Z	toshiba_		Here's the thing.. I want to install a custom build of Firefox. The only way I can think of, is to extract the archive (after closing the program) over the existing ones. However, it appears I am not allowed to do that (modify the files in there). Any ideas?
2005-06-03T13:10:00.000Z	psychonate	toshiba_	why don't you just uninstall your existing version, and then install the new one safely?
2005-06-03T13:11:00.000Z	toshiba_	psychonate	can I pm you?
