2010-09-29T01:13:00.000Z	xbonesx	bobstro	wow, thanks a lot
2010-09-29T01:13:00.000Z	bobstro	xbonesx	 was playing with it last night.
2010-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	xbonesx	bobstro	see anything about the mouse that is set by firefox, if there even is one?
2010-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	bobstro	xbonesx	 i'm not aware of anything, but i haven't really looked.
2010-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	bobstro	xbonesx	 though... i did have strangeness with cursor changing a while back. is that your issue?
2010-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	xbonesx	bobstro	yesir
2010-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	bobstro	xbonesx	 ah. i can only tell you that i found the answer via google. i honestly don't remember what the issue was, but it was a quick fix.
2010-09-29T01:17:00.000Z	xbonesx	bobstro	well i figured out that if you put the folder with the images in the /usr/share/icons/ folder and then change your current mouse "cursor.theme" file too inherit=<the one you want> that it solves the mouse issue acrooss the board in gnome, but when above firefox it goes back to default
2010-09-29T01:17:00.000Z	bobstro	xbonesx	 i wasn't even doing that much. just basic interface stuff.
2010-09-29T01:19:00.000Z	xbonesx	bobstro	oh, you should see the mouse cursor im using, one sec ill get a link

2010-09-29T01:23:00.000Z	bobstro	xbonesx	 i'd lose that on my screen! you've seen these? http://howto.blbosti.com/2010/08/change-mouse-cursor-theme-in-ubuntu-with-compiz-enabled-10-04-and-higher/
2010-09-29T01:36:00.000Z	xbonesx	bobstro	so i undid the changes that i had made for the cursor then tried step one and then did step two in that link you gave me and now the cursor works across the board thanks a lot
2010-09-29T01:37:00.000Z	bobstro	xbonesx	 glad to hear it. but now they're the old cursors, right?
2010-09-29T01:38:00.000Z	xbonesx	bobstro	no i edited the commands in the link to point towards my custom one that i placed in /usr/share/icons/ folder
