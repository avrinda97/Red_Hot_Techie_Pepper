2009-07-24T06:15:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		For some reason, the ms-sys package doesn't exist in Universe anymore.
2009-07-24T06:15:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		Is there a similar tool used to restore the Windows boot record?
2009-07-24T06:15:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		And on that note, is there a history of Wubi corrupting the MBR?
2009-07-24T06:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	things like that can happen with Wubi yep
2009-07-24T06:16:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]	sebsebseb	This is arbitrary corruption. I've been running Wubi fine for months
2009-07-24T06:16:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		Suddenly, Windows gets a hal.dll corruption issue
2009-07-24T06:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	Wubi sucks, do a real proper partitioend install instead :)
2009-07-24T06:16:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]	sebsebseb	Unfortunately, that's not possible.
2009-07-24T06:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	why not?
2009-07-24T06:17:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]	sebsebseb	Because my boss' husband now thinks that Ubuntu corrupts Windows.
2009-07-24T06:17:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		And he's fervently pro-Windows. He's unable to accept that Windows could possibly fail on its own.
2009-07-24T06:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	hmm at  certain computer ignorance
2009-07-24T06:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	well if Windows goes bad enough,   your Wubi install will as well
2009-07-24T06:18:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]	sebsebseb	Unfortunately, that won't be an issue. I've been told to wipe Wubi away.
2009-07-24T06:19:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		So I'll be stuck using a poorly patched XP system now.
2009-07-24T06:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	buy him a Mac,  at least  then he can blame Apple a well known company, if things go wrong,  :D   oh and you can put Ubuntu on it as well
2009-07-24T06:19:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]	sebsebseb	I'm not the "tech guy," he is.
2009-07-24T06:19:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		Though, my knowledge on the subject is far superior to his.
2009-07-24T06:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	well some people can't be converted, ever, or any time soon, and that's sadly the way  things are
2009-07-24T06:20:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		I'm not expecting a conversion. I just wish I could use a working system for the development they expect.
2009-07-24T06:20:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]		I'm now expected to use Notepad for development.
2009-07-24T06:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FrozenFire[work]	I know Windows as host, is not that great,  but  maybe do an Ubuntu virtual machine?
2009-07-24T06:21:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]	sebsebseb	I'll see about it. _Hopefully_ he'll allow it.
