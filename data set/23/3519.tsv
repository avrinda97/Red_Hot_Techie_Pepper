2008-03-30T00:48:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	which driver you installed?
2008-03-30T00:49:00.000Z	dummy77	dimas__	i installed gspca
2008-03-30T00:49:00.000Z	dummy77	dimas__	spca5xx fits for my cam
2008-03-30T00:52:00.000Z	dummy77	dimas__	nope i did im sure because everytime i open my pc i have to type sudo rmmod gspca sudo rmmod zc0301 then modprobe gspca
2008-03-30T00:53:00.000Z	dummy77	dimas__	after all its working till i reboot then i have to type those again
2008-03-30T00:54:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	you installed in a wrong place...make sure user have access where you put it
2008-03-30T00:54:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	sorry but i am just guessing
2008-03-30T00:54:00.000Z	dummy77	dimas__	u mean i have to install it in the root directory?
2008-03-30T00:55:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	sudo is ok i think
2008-03-30T00:56:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	i just came here for a question really dont remember much how i did now but i know how it feel been there
2008-03-30T00:57:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	is ok my brother
2008-03-30T00:57:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	i could say i pretty sure you have the file in a wrong place though
2008-03-30T01:00:00.000Z	dimas__	dummy77	when you download make sure to put it in ./
