2007-06-28T09:46:00.000Z	eboyjr		What is something really cool that Ubuntu can do? ( That you like the best )
2007-06-28T09:47:00.000Z	eboyjr		mneptok; ya, but you have to buy the computer. I heard that Dell is/going_to sell comps. with Ubuntu right on it.
2007-06-28T09:48:00.000Z	eboyjr		mneptok; oh ok
2007-06-28T09:49:00.000Z	eboyjr		Who can tell me what makes Ubuntu BETTER than Windows... that you like most
2007-06-28T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	#ubuntu-offtopic would be the perfect place to ask that.
2007-06-28T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	You have a home folder.  That's where all your stuff goes.  You'll probably want to break it down further, with whatever directory structure you'd like.
2007-06-28T11:47:00.000Z	eboyjr	Flannel	So I can put something like "docs" in /home/docs? ( is a good idea )
2007-06-28T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	well, your home folder is /home/username/  (or ~/ for short), but yes.  docs, or whatever.
2007-06-28T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	~/docs/ or ~/work or whatever youd like.

2007-07-11T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	remove, and you probably want --purge too (removes config files as well) apt-get remove --purge moo
2007-07-26T09:02:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	alright, I'll bite.  Yes, I do.
2007-07-26T09:02:00.000Z	eboyjr	Flannel	http://forum.compiz.org/viewtopic.php?t=1559 I posted it.
2007-07-26T09:02:00.000Z	eboyjr	Flannel	Its a sweet idea I think.
2007-07-26T09:03:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	actually, I was thinking about looking into creating this sort of thing too.  Glad someone else already did.
2007-07-26T09:03:00.000Z	eboyjr	Flannel	Did that picture below pop out?
2007-07-26T09:03:00.000Z	eboyjr	Flannel	'Casue I made it with The GIMP.
2007-07-26T09:05:00.000Z	Flannel	eboyjr	It did.  Oh, someone hasn't made it a plugin yet?  pity
