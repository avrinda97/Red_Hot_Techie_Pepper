2011-12-31T14:26:00.000Z	Hordeking		Hey, is there a known issue with the Wifi Broadcom drivers for the 4312 LP-PHY? I'm having major issues, with fresh installations.
2011-12-31T14:27:00.000Z	Hordeking		I'm getting ready to roll back to the 10.10 LTS version.
2011-12-31T14:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	from where?
2011-12-31T14:28:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	From where? From the official ubuntu website,
2011-12-31T14:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	no, I mean from what version are you downgrading?
2011-12-31T14:29:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	11.10
2011-12-31T14:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	may I suggest not, try plasma-desktop, its 10.04 with the 3.0 kernel
2011-12-31T14:30:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	What does plasma-desktop do?
2011-12-31T14:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	gives you all that config you had with 10.04
2011-12-31T14:32:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	I don't need a special config. I just want working wifi. Right now, I have to do constant ifconfig <interface> down; ifconfig <interface> up
2011-12-31T14:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	during an install ubuntu calls back to mama, well it would unless you got wifi and its secured
2011-12-31T14:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	are you using wifi(n)?
2011-12-31T14:38:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	Not that I know of.
2011-12-31T14:38:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	My router is a WRT54GL
2011-12-31T14:39:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	It was certainly working before I took the OS up to 11.10
2011-12-31T14:40:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	There do seem to be major wifi issues with Ubuntu 11+
2011-12-31T14:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	I don't use wifi at home, wife does though, so I use her as a test-bed (she don't know it) , and the router has a lot to do with the quality of the wifi
2011-12-31T14:41:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	Even if it seemed to be flawless before? I don't seem to get a poor connection. I get a downright intermittent one, and it's only solved by resetting the interface with ifconfig.
2011-12-31T14:45:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	Even if it seemed to be flawless before? I don't seem to get a poor connection. I get a downright intermittent one, and it's only solved by resetting the interface with ifconfig. It's terrible.
2011-12-31T14:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	I gave up on wifi in the house, tried the ethernet via electrical line? the voip phone runs flawless on it, just a bit lower than regular ethernet
2011-12-31T14:49:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	My main box has an ethernet, which works fine, after the D-Link from 4 years ago in it still isn't supported. The wifi issue is with a laptop computer, where ethernet isn't a very viable option.
2011-12-31T14:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	Hordeking	join #kubuntu for a sec
2011-12-31T14:53:00.000Z	Hordeking	almoxarife	#kubuntu
