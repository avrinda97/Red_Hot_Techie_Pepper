2005-04-28T09:56:00.000Z	delltony		i have a question. i have a pc that only has a dialup modem on it that i'm trying to get to work. if i need say linux-headers i know if i had a connection i could do apt-get install linux-headers or whatever. how can i save this information to a file (tar) so i can transfer it to another computer (the one that is not working with internet) ?
2005-04-28T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	look at apt-zip
2005-05-11T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	you're using synaptic, right?
2005-05-11T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	it looks like, from the error, that you've added a new repository
2005-05-11T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	and haven't apt-get update , so it's saying it should have that file (from the repository) but it doesn't
2005-05-11T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	that's where I would look
2005-05-11T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	np
2005-05-11T09:30:00.000Z	delltony	nickrud	you gotta chance to post your sources.list yet?
2005-05-11T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	just repeat the deb line and head it with deb-src
2005-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	delltony	nickrud	this is working thanks question though you happen to know where i can find the libmp3lame source or whatever?
2005-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	compile, right?
2005-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	did you notice I have no sources in my sources.list (pun intended)
2005-05-11T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	but with those repositories, do an apt-cache search lame | grep lame
2005-05-11T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	no offence, but there are two things I never do: networking and compiling, because nearly everyone knows more than i do ;)
2006-01-02T15:15:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	normally /boot is on the / partition in ubuntu.
2006-01-02T15:17:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	you wouldn't mount /boot, you'd mount /
2006-01-02T15:17:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	then boot is at /boot on your mounted partition
2006-01-02T15:18:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	if that's the partition that has /
2006-01-02T15:19:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	well, I'd use sudo fdisk -l, and try mounting partitions until I found the right one
2006-01-02T15:26:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	are you running a livecd?
2006-01-02T15:27:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	which wiki?
2006-01-02T15:29:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	that page makes it harder than it is :)
2006-01-02T15:29:00.000Z	nickrud	delltony	ok, where are you mounting your hda2?
