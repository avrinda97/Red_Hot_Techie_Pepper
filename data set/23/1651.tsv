2011-03-21T19:06:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu		In my /etc/network/interfaces file I've defined several static IP configs for my interfaces.  The one for eth1 contains this line "post-up ip addr add 10.10.20.5/24 dev eth1" but afterward if I "ip -4 addr list dev eth1" the address is not listed (only the first address, specified using "address" is). If I run the command manually, it works. Any ideas?
2011-03-21T19:07:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	What exactly are you trying to do?
2011-03-21T19:07:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	configure a 2nd IP address on eth1
2011-03-21T19:08:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	Using an alias ?
2011-03-21T19:08:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	an alias?
2011-03-21T19:09:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	Yea, and alias. That sounds like what you really want. i.e. eth1.0
2011-03-21T19:09:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	i.e. create a vlan interface with vlan id 0?
2011-03-21T19:10:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	What exactly are you trying to do?
2011-03-21T19:11:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	just configure a secondary IP address on the interfaces, so that I can bind to whichever I need
2011-03-21T19:11:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	the config works, just can't figure out why I can't make it get configured inside of /etc/network/interfaces
2011-03-21T19:12:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	It would be something like this: sudo ifconfig eth0:0 10.10.20.1 up
2011-03-21T19:12:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	.. I want to add it to the config *file*. I can configure it on the command line just fine
2011-03-21T19:13:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	Maybe if you show us your config file. i.e. pastebinit /etc/network/interfaces
2011-03-21T19:14:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	h/o installing pastebinit

2011-03-21T19:17:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	s3r3n1t7 it was my goofed up config before that line... duh. Should have caught that. Thanks guys
2011-03-21T19:21:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	Looks liked the gateway address is wrong too. (Not within the subset)
2011-03-21T19:21:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	yep. copy+paste fail :< haha
2011-03-21T19:24:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	"post-up ip addr add 10.10.20.5/24 dev eth1" confuses me. What is that supposed to do?
2011-03-21T19:25:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	it just adds another IP to the interface. Basically what's happening here is that this box holds multiple IPs on the subnet, which are used for different (sets) of services.  I can determine which address is used for outbound connections using bind()
2011-03-21T19:25:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	it's a rather eccentric and unusual setup I'm aware ;) It's a testbed for some networking software
2011-03-21T19:26:00.000Z	te	LordXe-gnu	I've just never seen something like that  b4
2011-03-21T19:27:00.000Z	LordXe-gnu	te	you will probably see it a lot more used with ipv6 (assuming ISPs actually give us decent blocks of IPs.. I think they're *supposed* to give out /48 and /64's). You could do something like have an address for your outbound connections and run services like sshd on a different IP so that just connecting to someone doesn't give out enough info about you to expose your services
