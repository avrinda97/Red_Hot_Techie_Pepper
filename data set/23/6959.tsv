2006-04-10T08:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	Siph0n	where are you making the file ?
2006-04-10T09:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	Siph0n	there should be no reason you get a permission denied for a make in your home folder

2006-04-10T09:09:00.000Z	tristanmike	Siph0n	you could try "make clean"
2006-04-10T09:10:00.000Z	Siph0n	tristanmike	does make defconfig do like the same thing as configure?
