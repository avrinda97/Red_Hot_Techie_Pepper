2008-01-07T07:21:00.000Z	newguys1		hi, is it safe to make www-data the owner of all files and folders in one site?
2008-01-07T07:21:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	no, only the files under /var/www should be owned by www-data
2008-01-07T07:22:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	yes, iam talking about files on one site which is located at /var/www/somesite, because my script need to be able to create files and folders, so www-data should be the owner (I think), is that safe?
2008-01-07T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	the reason the files are owned by www-data is so the apache server can write there, like a cms allowing file uploads.
2008-01-07T07:24:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	in other words, its safe or lets say best option that www-date owns files and folders in www-data
2008-01-07T07:24:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	yes, to both :)
2008-01-07T07:25:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	thanks alot:)
2008-01-07T07:27:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	you have to use sudo to write there, then change the files to www-data
2008-01-07T07:27:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	is there any other way to allow me to change the files? because they are on my local machine, and needs alot of work to develop them?
2008-01-07T07:28:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	I would work on my stuff in ~/public_html , then move them to /var/www later
2008-01-07T07:29:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	sudo a2enmod userdir will make that dir available as localhost/~me
2008-01-07T07:31:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	thanks, but I got this error when trying This module does not exist!
2008-01-07T07:31:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	think that I need to add it in apache.conf?
2008-01-07T07:32:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	ls /etc/apache2/mods-available , userdir should be there in a standard install
2008-01-07T07:34:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	what should I be looking for in /etc/apache2/mods-available
2008-01-07T07:34:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	usrdir.conf and userdir.load
2008-01-07T07:34:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	erm, userdir.*
2008-01-07T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	sudo a2enmod userdir  should do it; it creates a link from /etc/apache2/mods-available to /mods-enabled. You'll have to restart apache
2008-01-07T07:41:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	still getting the same error
2008-01-07T07:41:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	that is so weird. did you see the userdir* in the mods-available ?
2008-01-07T07:42:00.000Z	newguys1	nickrud	yes
2008-01-07T07:42:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	I just did it here:   sudo a2enmod userdir
2008-01-07T07:43:00.000Z	nickrud	newguys1	oh. lol.  Type exactly:   sudo a2enmod userdir   :)
