2006-12-18T15:59:00.000Z	TheVault		Well, the problem is that, in Firefox, all the links are different sizes
2006-12-18T15:59:00.000Z	TheVault		And they are kinda annoying
2006-12-18T15:59:00.000Z	TheVault		If you like, I can show you a screenshot of what im talking about
2006-12-18T16:01:00.000Z	TheVault		Is it me, or in Firefox under the tools, there is no option menu?
2006-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	TheVault		Whoa thanks a million!
2006-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	TheVault		Iv been searching for that
2006-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	TheVault		In windows, its under tools
2006-12-18T16:03:00.000Z	TheVault		Thanks, I found it
2006-12-18T16:03:00.000Z	TheVault		Another question, is it me or does firefox show different sized fonts?
2006-12-18T16:03:00.000Z	TheVault		Here, I will show you what I mean
2006-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	rcrook	TheVault	it does and it irks me no end
2006-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	TheVault		is there a cure for that or I mean a option to fix that?
2006-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	TheVault	rcrook	show me what you see on Google.com
2006-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	rcrook		not that I have found so far
2006-12-18T16:05:00.000Z	rcrook		the fonts for the actual content are in the preferences but for the menus and dialog boxes I can not find
2006-12-18T16:06:00.000Z	TheVault		Alright, this is what Google & some of my screen looks like
2006-12-18T16:06:00.000Z	TheVault		http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y28/kylewitt/VeryWeird.png
2006-12-18T16:07:00.000Z	TheVault		if you look on it, you will see the font and things are kinda hard to read and on the right of google where it says "Advanced Search" and things, its kinda smaller
2006-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	TheVault		Then when I go to Photobucket.com, the fonts are all outta wack
2006-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	rcrook	TheVault	you can change that in the preferences
2006-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	TheVault		What should I set the font & font size to then?
2006-12-18T16:09:00.000Z	TheVault		Alright, lemme check
2006-12-18T16:09:00.000Z	rcrook	TheVault	just increase the size by a couple of points
