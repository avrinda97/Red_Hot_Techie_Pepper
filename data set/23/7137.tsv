2005-12-28T12:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		The ntfs resize function in the installer is totally safe, right?
2005-12-28T12:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	Nothing is _totally_ safe with you're messing with your HD but I've never heard of anyone having problems with NTFS resize.
2005-12-28T12:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	Right.  That's comforting enough I guess.
2005-12-29T10:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	that's a tricky one
2005-12-29T10:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	why can't you load it when you're at school? it shouldn't break anything
2005-12-29T10:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	I don't mind doing a manual edit when I go between locations if that helps.
2005-12-29T10:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	in that case just modprobe it when you're at home and don't when you're at school
2005-12-29T10:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	No, it shouldn't, but it slows down boot (a minor inconvenience) and confuses suspend (which I may or may not succeed at fixing, so I'm investigating options).
2005-12-29T10:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	meaning never have it load on boot, and use modprobe to bring it up as necessary.
2005-12-29T11:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	no
2005-12-29T11:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	How come?
2005-12-29T11:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	They de-fragment on-the-fly.
2005-12-29T11:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	Slick.
2006-01-09T14:15:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	du -h, iirc
2006-01-09T14:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	Close.  That's what I had tried actually.
2006-01-27T06:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	Mine works.
2006-01-27T06:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	tonyyarusso	it's buggy, slow, and usually fails to sync audio and video
2006-01-27T06:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	That much I've seen occasionally.
2006-01-27T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	That's RobinL's goal.
2006-03-14T13:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	kyleD: Correct, I've done exactly that twice.
2006-03-14T13:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	kyleD: Except for the automatically part.  It involves some input.
2006-04-19T11:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	HedgeMage: Third time.
2006-05-29T12:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Amaranth	(You aware you still have that @ ?)
