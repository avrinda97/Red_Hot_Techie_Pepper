2012-09-11T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	did you edit to .hosts file for it?
2012-09-11T21:15:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	what? edit the hosts file, what for? its locally receiving commands to add/remove items from the playlist, etc.
2012-09-11T21:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	.hosts   not hosts
2012-09-11T21:16:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	again I ask, why do I need that? That's the help resolve domain names. That's not being used in this case at all.
2012-09-11T21:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	it dictates who can access the vlc service remotely
2012-09-11T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	its nothing to do with DNS names at all
2012-09-11T21:17:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	well its interfacing with int remotely locally to a socket and therefore doesn't require resolving domains.
2012-09-11T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	I'll put it in quotes to make it clearer as you aren't getting it
2012-09-11T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	did you edit the ".hosts" file
2012-09-11T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	noth the period, that's not an accident
2012-09-11T21:18:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	no I have not, I'm not aware of the requirement to do this as there was no mention of this. Please explain to what do I need to edit this file?
2012-09-11T21:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	if you don't allow your netmask, the only system allowed access is localhost
2012-09-11T21:19:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	okay, but that's what I have been saying I just want localhost to have access.
2012-09-11T21:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	edit the /etc/vlc/lua/http/.hosts    to allow your netmask
2012-09-11T21:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	ahh, thats cool then , no need
2012-09-11T21:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	do you want the vlc to run on the remote screen only?
2012-09-11T21:23:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	no it runs on the system itself. I want VLC to run in full screen mode playing an infinite loop of videos. I'm locally via a script send commands using RC via the Unix socket to start VLC and add items to the play list. Perodicially it checks a remote server for new content if new content is found it downloads it and updates the play list.
2012-09-11T21:24:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	at this stage I'm just enabling the RC and setting the socket and I'm getting these errors. It keeps crappying out.
2012-09-11T21:25:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	see https://gist.github.com/7d553adc6a268baa1b20
2012-09-11T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	if you have the app running at startup, you can control it with the web ui. Is that what you need?
2012-09-11T21:35:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	no I stated what I required, I need to use the RC interface module so that I can send commands to control the player, add files to the play list, etc. without human interaction directly. All this is done via scripts.
2012-09-11T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TheWarden	oh, thats pretty fancy
2012-09-11T21:36:00.000Z	TheWarden	ActionParsnip	well yes and no but the idea works just getting all these errors and then having it crap out once daily. which the errors is what I'm trying to resolve.
