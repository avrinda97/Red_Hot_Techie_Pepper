2005-02-02T12:54:00.000Z	pvh		Hey, that might help with my question too.
2005-02-02T12:54:00.000Z	pvh		What about this? "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2005-02-02T12:54:00.000Z	pvh		That was the official advice I found.
2005-02-02T12:55:00.000Z	pvh		Does Ubuntu install the non-free Nvidia drivers by default, or am I going to have to go add repositories and such?
2005-02-02T12:55:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) nvidia-glx
2005-02-02T12:55:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	not installed by default, but available
2005-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	thanks.
2005-02-02T12:56:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	could you explain the strange apt-get install command there?
2005-02-02T12:57:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	you're installing linux-restricted-modules-X, where X is your currently-running kernel version, and nvidia-glx
2005-02-02T12:57:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	Ah, thank you. What are in the restricted modules?
2005-02-02T12:58:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	Actually, I can probably find that out myself.
2005-02-02T12:58:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	nvidia, fglrx, atheros, fritz-acm
2005-02-02T13:00:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	Thanks. That's great. Restricted is not a particularly clear name for that.
2005-02-02T13:00:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	it's various non-free modules, and there's nothing else that sums that grouping up
2005-02-02T13:00:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	"nonfree-modules"?

2005-02-02T13:01:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	ubuntu/restricted : ubuntu/main :: debian/non-free : debian/main
2005-03-11T08:14:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	XScreenSaver suddenly became Xinerama-aware
2005-03-11T08:14:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	so it knows to treat the two monitors as one big display, instead of two separate ones
2005-03-11T08:14:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	matter of personal preference
2005-03-11T08:15:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	Is there any way to disable that feature?
2005-03-11T08:15:00.000Z	pvh	daniels	Everything happens at the seam. :)
2005-03-11T08:16:00.000Z	daniels	pvh	not really, unfortunately
