2009-12-19T01:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	qed	 qwith a sudo in there..   and the changes normally DONT take affect till after a reboot. (or the system some how remounts the filesystem)
2009-12-19T01:01:00.000Z	qed	Dr_Willis	can i run this while the FS is mounted?
2009-12-19T01:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	qed	 yes you can. but the changes dont take affect untill after its remounted.
2009-12-19T01:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	qed	 I normally set the label, and the reserved space to be like  a few blocks or 1% on some drives
2009-12-19T01:01:00.000Z	qed	Dr_Willis	could you give me an example?
2009-12-19T01:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	qed	 check the docs/manpages  theres several ways to set the reserve
2009-12-19T01:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	qed	 i think -m 0   = 0%
2009-12-19T01:02:00.000Z	qed	Dr_Willis	what does this do?
2009-12-19T01:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	qed	 or ya can do it by block.
2009-12-19T01:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	qed	 no idea.
