2007-11-04T13:33:00.000Z	aeshyamae		hi all i am from a emacs in gobuntu...the gobuntu installation didnt give me the regular gui..now how can i install the gui myself, how can i know what prevented gobuntu from regular gui installation?
2007-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	aeshyamae		sudo apt-get install gdm will install gui?
2007-11-04T13:36:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	Umm, there's probably supposed to be a gobuntu-desktop package that's the meta package for all the GUI stuff in Gobuntu.
2007-11-04T13:36:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	That's how all the other Ubuntu distributions work.
2007-11-04T13:37:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	"dpkg -l gobuntu-desktop"
2007-11-04T13:37:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	That will tell you if that package is installed.
2007-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	aeshyamae	levander	oo thanks...no packages found..so i should install that no?
2007-11-04T13:40:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	My guess is yes, that's how all the other distros work.  But, I've never used Gobuntu.  I'm surprised that any install of it did not install a GUI.  So, I'm a little confused.
2007-11-04T13:41:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	If the machine is not mission critical, and you don't mind losing your work on it, and having to do another install, you could try it.
2007-11-04T13:41:00.000Z	aeshyamae	levander	i have tried installing twice and the same result
2007-11-04T13:42:00.000Z	aeshyamae	levander	i am now downloading the heavy gobuntu-desktop package
2007-11-04T13:42:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	Is it going to bother you if "sudo apt-get install gobuntu-desktop" messes up your machine, and you have to do a 3rd reinstall?
2007-11-04T13:43:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	What country are you from?  Its weird, I can read like an indian accent even in how you type.
2007-11-04T13:43:00.000Z	aeshyamae	levander	hehe oo so that will not do the thing?
2007-11-04T13:43:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	I think it will, but I'm not sure.
2007-11-04T13:43:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	Yeah, it's gonna take a long time to download gobuntu-desktop.  Go get a smoke or something.
2007-11-04T13:44:00.000Z	aeshyamae	levander	oo have to spend time no?will try installing indic scripts in emacs:)
2007-11-04T13:44:00.000Z	levander	aeshyamae	What country are you from?
2007-11-04T14:07:00.000Z	aeshyamae	levander	where can i look incase there is any problem installing the gui for gobunutu?
2007-11-04T14:26:00.000Z	aeshyamae	levander	should i do any configuration as i installed gobuntu-desktop or can ijust go for a restart after that?
