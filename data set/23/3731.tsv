2008-05-29T02:14:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	i have the lieutenant kernel
2008-06-08T19:24:00.000Z	amenado	DIL	what services would you like to serve?
2008-06-08T19:25:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	there is a gui package for autopsy but i seems that it will only work with the server kernel??
2008-06-08T19:26:00.000Z	amenado	DIL	have you tried to download and install it yet? i believe both server and desktop is pretty much the same lest you tweak the kernel system parameters
2008-06-08T19:28:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	i had it working b4 but video crashed after an update - had to get new card that was compatible with 8.04 - now having probs with ptk and virtualbox.
2008-06-08T19:30:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	i should get a UI when i enter localhost/ptk in firefox but get you have chosen to open ,,,, but it is a phtml file
2008-06-08T19:30:00.000Z	amenado	DIL	what kind of problems are you having with ptk and virtual box? maybe if you can clarify, some folks here may be able to assist
2008-06-08T19:31:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	i should get a UI when i enter localhost/ptk in firefox but get you have chosen to open ,,,, but it is a phtml file
2008-06-08T19:32:00.000Z	amenado	DIL	sorry what is a ptk?  am weak with acronyms
2008-06-08T19:34:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	ptk is a gui for the forensic application autopsy
2008-06-08T19:35:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	i tried configuring a LAMP and i get the same error 'you have chosen to open .... but is a phtml file"
2008-06-08T19:36:00.000Z	amenado	DIL	your firefox may not be using the correct app to open the phtml file..so you look into the mime type and correct the corresponding error?
2008-06-08T19:37:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	ptk worked before i had to reinstall everthing after video crashed
2008-06-08T19:38:00.000Z	amenado	DIL	its a very specific to your autopsy app or in general you dont get access?
2008-06-08T19:39:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	specific
2008-06-08T19:40:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	the only difference when i booted i saw server kernel listed - iwanted to install that
2008-06-08T19:40:00.000Z	amenado	DIL	then you have to look into how firefox have to handle that  pthml  type ..look around the mime types
2008-06-08T19:40:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	ty
2008-06-08T19:40:00.000Z	DIL	amenado	i will kepp trying
