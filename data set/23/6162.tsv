2008-01-06T04:25:00.000Z	djcabz		Can someone point me in the direction of tracking down this memory leak in compiz?
2008-01-06T04:26:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	valgrind
2008-01-06T04:27:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 valgrind, you think so.  I'm not so good with performance monitors in nix...
2008-01-06T04:27:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	yes
2008-01-06T04:29:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 thanks.
2008-01-06T04:30:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	np dude
2008-01-06T04:32:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 before I go too deep here, is there a method to hook valgrind up to an already running daemon?
2008-01-06T04:32:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	man valgrind
2008-01-06T04:43:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 valgrind is actually a fairly extensive application.  I doubt it will be as helpful if I have to spend two hours figuring out what tools in valgrind I need for my situation, then another hour collecting metrics.  can you point me to a nice how to do X guickly FAQ... :)
2008-01-06T04:46:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/valgrind.html
2008-01-06T04:49:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	np dude
2008-01-06T05:45:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 valgrind seemingly cannot be connected to an already running process...
2008-01-06T05:45:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	you could attach gdb if you like
2008-01-06T05:46:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 gdb huh,  keep in mind I'm a noob at debugging under linux.  :)  strace any easier than gdb ?>
2008-01-06T05:47:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	strace is for syscalls
2008-01-06T05:47:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	i recommend ##c
2008-01-06T05:48:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 I was really hoping this was a known issue.  compiz.real has a memory leak, and it is connected to some screen saver.  but I understand this is a first???
2008-01-06T05:49:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	did you check launchpad ?
2008-01-06T05:49:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 no. :)  brb
2008-01-06T05:52:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=579739    close enough to what I am seeing :)  thanks.  that settles this.
2008-01-06T05:53:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	np
2008-01-06T05:54:00.000Z	khermans	djcabz	many eyes reap many bugs
2008-01-06T05:54:00.000Z	djcabz	khermans	 so true... but I have to reboot now cause the system is slowing down way too much to be "fun"...   again thanks
