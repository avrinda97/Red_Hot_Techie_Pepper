2007-11-30T14:02:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	Matlab is proprietary software you should have to buy it to use it, or you might want to try octave which is an open source implementation of various matlab functions
2007-11-30T14:02:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
2007-11-30T14:07:00.000Z	Parsi	balachmar	is Octave linux version of matlab?
2007-11-30T14:07:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	no, but in some things it is compatible
2007-11-30T14:09:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	soemtimes it does, so what you could to is try it it will execute the m-files you have
2007-11-30T14:09:00.000Z	Parsi	balachmar	thanks
2007-11-30T14:11:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	you're welcome, but are you a student, or not, and if you work at a university, they just maight already have a matlab linux version for you
2007-11-30T14:12:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	Well then still your university might have student versions available, our university has
2007-11-30T14:13:00.000Z	Parsi	balachmar	no, all the computers run MS Windows
2007-11-30T14:14:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	Well if they supply students with licenses, it doesn't matter, because you can use the same license in the linux version
2007-11-30T14:15:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	this is a howto from your institution? then you know how to get it.
2007-11-30T14:17:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/FAQ.html#MATLAB-compatibility
2007-11-30T14:17:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	just some extra info in case you can't get your hands on matlab for linux
2007-11-30T14:18:00.000Z	Parsi	balachmar	i think there is linux version
2007-11-30T14:22:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	no
2007-11-30T14:22:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	your university normally pays for it
2007-11-30T14:22:00.000Z	Parsi	balachmar	i wanna use it at home
2007-11-30T14:24:00.000Z	balachmar	Parsi	then you are still allowed to use a student license from your university if you use it for your education
