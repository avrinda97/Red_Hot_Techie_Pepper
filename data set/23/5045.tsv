2007-03-06T06:32:00.000Z	Allen3373		I can't get ndiswapper to install. it tells me the file or directory doesn't exist, even though it's sitting there on my desktop.
2007-03-06T06:34:00.000Z	Allen3373		So any ideas on why I can't install ndiswrapper?
2007-03-06T06:34:00.000Z	lufis	Allen3373	move the folder to your /home and try it then
2007-03-06T06:35:00.000Z	Allen3373	lufis	how do I do that? lol I'm a noob
2007-03-06T06:35:00.000Z	lufis	Allen3373	just drag and drop
2007-03-06T06:35:00.000Z	lufis	Allen3373	go to places > home folder, drag it from the desktop there
2007-03-06T06:35:00.000Z	Allen3373	lufis	where is my home?

2007-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	Allen3373	lufis	to what?
2007-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	lufis	Allen3373	to the directory. i presume you're compiling from source or something?
2007-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	Allen3373	lufis	correct. I was in the directory that the files are in. but no mater where I go, it's an invlid command
2007-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	lufis	Allen3373	have you compiled it yet? binaries aren't made until source is compiled
