2010-09-09T20:51:00.000Z	ffdsf		ive just installed ubuntu but it's slow as hell, what can I do with it?
2010-09-09T20:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	wwhat spec pc?
2010-09-09T20:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	what cpu? pentium 3?
2010-09-09T20:53:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	how much linux experience do you have?
2010-09-09T20:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	ok this can happen 2 ways, remove junk from stock ubuntu, or start again from minimal ubuntu, its your choice
2010-09-09T20:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	everytrh
2010-09-09T20:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	everything you don't need
2010-09-09T20:58:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	not directly, but uninstalling daemons and services that occupy cpu and ram
2010-09-09T20:59:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	also replacing to reduce load, eg replace gnome with openbox and tint2 as a panel
2010-09-09T21:03:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	are you willing to learn about linux?
2010-09-09T21:05:00.000Z	ffdsf	aeon-ltd	are you getting at I should build linux system from scratch
2010-09-09T21:05:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	no, but use a ground up distro
2010-09-09T21:11:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	you still here?
2010-09-09T21:12:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	some maybe, depends on your hardware, but its all part of the learning process
2010-09-09T21:13:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	but the gains are that you have the lightest system (with a package manager and community) possible
2010-09-09T21:14:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	yeah, if you have the time try Emanon's idea then try a ground up distro if its too slow still
2010-09-09T21:14:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	imo, openbox
2010-09-09T22:22:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	ok you followed through with my advice :), you need to install a panel, any one you like
2010-09-11T02:14:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	hi, how did openbox work out for you?
2010-09-11T02:16:00.000Z	ffdsf	aeon-ltd	it was kinda useless and I had to install lxde which nearly as slow as gnome
2010-09-11T02:18:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	ok, you are kinda pushing it though with your specs, but if you'd like to learn about linux please feel free to try http://www.archlinux.org/download/ and use this for reference http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_Guide , archlinux unlike ubuntu is much more raw and that gives it the advantage in performance
2010-09-11T02:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	its basically packages neeeded to get online, a kernel, a package manager
2010-09-11T02:20:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ffdsf	oh and cli by default
