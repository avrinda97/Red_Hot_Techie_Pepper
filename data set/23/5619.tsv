2007-07-04T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 :) ask an answerable question.. and lets see! :)
2007-07-04T11:41:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	how to access the hard disk partitions i have made in Ubuntu on the guest OS (Win 2K)? i am able to access only the virtual disk space created for windows
2007-07-04T11:42:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	i mean i am not able to c my actual hard disk partitions anywhere on windows 2K
2007-07-04T11:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 i always 'share' the drives with samba, and let the  vmware os. access them as if thery were on a network.
2007-07-04T11:43:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	ok can u guide me on that? is it shared folders or something?
2007-07-04T11:44:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	how do i connect Ubuntu with the guest os?
2007-07-04T11:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 install samba, install samba-doc, give the linux user samba passwords with 'sudo smbpasswd -a LINUXUSERNAME' , edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf as needed.. :)
2007-07-04T11:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 when all else fails read the books included in 'samba-doc' package. :0
2007-07-04T11:45:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	Thanks a lot
2007-07-04T11:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 not sure of any other way to let vmware see local hard drives. I think it can be done. but not confogurable with the gui.
2007-07-04T11:46:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	that's ok, i can manage without a gui. but how to do it?
2007-07-04T11:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 Not sure. I saw   an artical  on getting vmware to run a physical drive. and they had to manually make the vmware config foles.
2007-07-04T11:47:00.000Z	r_rehashed		hmm..
2007-07-04T11:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 there were a few web sites that could let ya construct the vmware files  with a questionare. but ive never done that.
2007-07-04T11:48:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	not sure i want to do that...  does using samba reduce the speed in accessing the local drives?
2007-07-04T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 a little of course.
2007-07-04T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r_rehashed	 but on a local machine.. it would be very fast.  virtual network.
2007-07-04T11:51:00.000Z	r_rehashed	Dr_willis	there is this option of using a virtual network with ubuntu, in the settings. should i use that? right now i am using NAT
