2005-03-18T11:45:00.000Z	mdke		i've trawled the website for a while. Who can tell me how to enable hdparm for my cdrom on a permanent basis? thanks in advance
2005-03-18T11:45:00.000Z	mdke		i mean dma
2005-03-18T11:46:00.000Z	mdke		binary
2005-03-18T11:46:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	you probably need to look in /etc/hdparm.conf
2005-03-18T11:47:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	membreya, can you tell me what should be in there?
2005-03-18T11:48:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	yeah, everything's explained in config file
2005-03-18T11:48:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	not whether ubuntu uses devfs or not tho
2005-03-18T11:48:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	it doesn't
2005-03-18T11:49:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	anyway, that's quite independent of hdparm/dma
2005-03-18T11:49:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	it is relevant to what syntax to use in the conf. are you sure it doesn't?
2005-03-18T11:49:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	is it? i didn't know that
2005-03-18T11:50:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	you're the one who told me to read the conf ;)
2005-03-18T11:50:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	alright, use the one for no devfs systems then
2005-03-18T11:51:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	yep ok have done
2005-03-18T11:52:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	ok it has worked thanks for your help
2005-03-18T11:54:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	does /etc/init.d/hdparm exist?
2005-03-18T11:54:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	sure
2005-03-18T11:59:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	mine goes to /etc/X11/cursors/core.theme
2005-03-18T11:59:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	thanks
2005-03-18T12:01:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	what about /etc/alternatives/mozilla-javaplugin.so?
2005-03-18T12:01:00.000Z	mdke	theine_	no idea i'm afraid
2005-03-18T12:01:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	don't have java installed?
2005-03-18T12:01:00.000Z	theine_	mdke	ok, thanks anyway
