2008-07-12T20:28:00.000Z	Fri13		Why ubuntu does not support open WLAN connections anymore but demands WPA/WPA2 etc?
2008-07-12T20:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	it does
2008-07-12T20:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	is the essid hidden?
2008-07-12T20:29:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	No it does not give "open" as option. SSID is shown and all other machines can connect with Windows or other Linux distribution used.
2008-07-12T20:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	where is this? in the cli or gui
2008-07-12T20:30:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	GUI of course... I'm not yet planned to do it by CLI... it should work by GUI.
2008-07-12T20:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	it does work; what is the nic on that and what have you tried, errors, etc.
2008-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	nic? No erroes, it just does not give option to choose "open", only a WPA/WPA2 etc as security, so it cant connect
2008-07-12T20:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	which gui is this you speak of
2008-07-12T20:33:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	The default one, system > administration > network or the icon in systray
2008-07-12T20:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	network manager?
2008-07-12T20:34:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	"Networking" so it might be that then.
2008-07-12T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	this is a bug you believe then?
2008-07-12T20:39:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	can you open a terminal and connect to that router?
2008-07-12T20:40:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	Nope, ubuntu does not allow anykind connections
2008-07-12T20:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	what command did you enter in the terminal?
2008-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	I am assuming this is your own network you are connecting to?
2008-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	I'm writing a article about Ubuntu's development. THis just is very wierd thing because GUI does not offer than WEP and WPA secured networks
2008-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	Yes, one of few. All others finds out but not unsecure
2008-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	that is simply not correct.
2008-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	I believe something is very terrible wrong if not even GUI offer a "Open" as security option.
2008-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Fri13	please cease. that is simply not true.
2008-07-12T20:45:00.000Z	Fri13	bazhang	Actually I try ubuntu to this one laptop (what I used to sniff it networking packgets) if it works with Intel WLAN chip.... thanks for your help.
