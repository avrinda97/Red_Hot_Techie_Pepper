2005-02-27T09:28:00.000Z	plagerism		Anyone know how to setup cups in gnome, or any special steps I need to do??
2005-02-27T09:30:00.000Z	plagerism		I didnt mean gnome, I meant Ubuntu, by default the cups web interface is deactivated, and I dont know how to activate it
2005-02-27T09:31:00.000Z	plagerism		farruin:  the cups web interface doesnt seem to be responding
2005-02-27T09:32:00.000Z	plagerism		What port is the cups web interface on? 631 right??
2005-02-27T09:32:00.000Z	Pluk	plagerism	adduser cupsys shadow
2005-02-27T09:32:00.000Z	Pluk		that way you can login on the cups website
2005-02-27T09:33:00.000Z	plagerism	Pluk	its not that I can login, its not responding
2005-02-27T09:33:00.000Z	Pluk		you get the login screen back?
2005-02-27T09:33:00.000Z	Pluk		or you dont get any website at all?
2005-02-27T09:33:00.000Z	plagerism	Pluk	no, no login screen at all
2005-02-27T09:34:00.000Z	Pluk		you sure cupsys is installed?
2005-02-27T09:34:00.000Z	Pluk		and running?
2005-02-27T09:34:00.000Z	plagerism		cupsys    6408     1  0 20:22 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/cupsd -F
2005-02-27T09:36:00.000Z	plagerism		yes a firewall could interfere with that, however I have no firewall rules up
2005-02-27T09:37:00.000Z	plagerism		you know what it was, I have never seen this before, but my loopback device wasnt setup properly
2005-02-27T09:37:00.000Z	Pluk		it is listening on 127.0.0.1
2005-02-27T09:37:00.000Z	plagerism	Pluk	I fixed it
2005-02-27T09:37:00.000Z	Pluk		yup
2005-02-27T09:37:00.000Z	Pluk		good
2005-02-27T09:38:00.000Z	plagerism		Now its just a matter of straightening out my networking issues
2005-02-27T09:39:00.000Z	plagerism		I should just define my network interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces right??
2005-02-27T09:39:00.000Z	plagerism		and then those should be brought up wint /etc/init.d/networking right??
2005-02-27T09:39:00.000Z	Pluk	plagerism	indeed
