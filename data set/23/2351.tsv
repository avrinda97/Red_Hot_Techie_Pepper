2009-04-11T21:46:00.000Z	kirb		how do i fix my dns? i can ping 8.15.228.161   but not google.com
2009-04-11T21:47:00.000Z	histo	kirb	edit your /etc/resolv.conf
2009-04-11T21:47:00.000Z	histo	kirb	thats there your nameservers are set
2009-04-11T21:47:00.000Z	kirb	histo	i though it was generated for me on the fly
2009-04-11T21:47:00.000Z	histo	kirb	it shoudl be bu perhaps its wrong or your DNS went down
2009-04-11T21:47:00.000Z	histo	kirb	you can try using 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2  should work for now.
2009-04-11T21:50:00.000Z	kirb	histo	after editing the file do i have to restart anything?
2009-04-11T21:50:00.000Z	histo	kirb	nope as long as the new ones are on the top they should be working
2009-04-11T21:51:00.000Z	histo	kirb	by on the top I mean above the bad ones
2009-04-11T21:51:00.000Z	kirb	histo	that worked. possibility these were added when i created a vpn connection?
2009-04-11T21:51:00.000Z	histo	kirb	the bad ones? that could be.
2009-04-11T21:51:00.000Z	kirb	histo	also how did you know 4.2.2.1?
2009-04-11T21:52:00.000Z	kirb	histo	i connected to my vpn and the resolv.conf just was overwritten
2009-04-11T21:52:00.000Z	histo	kirb	its a level 3 dns server. They are free to use and easy to remember. basically anything 4.2.2.1  through 4.2.2.6  They aren't the fastest but they are reliable.  They're actually faster than my isp's so i use them with my own Bind 9 cacing server.
2009-04-11T21:52:00.000Z	kirb	histo	good to know
2009-04-11T21:53:00.000Z	histo	kirb	so the resolv.conf doens't change back when you disconnect fromt he vpn?
2009-04-11T21:54:00.000Z	kirb	histo	nope the names servers stick
2009-04-11T21:54:00.000Z	histo	kirb	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/+bug/90681
2009-04-11T21:54:00.000Z	histo	kirb	it looks like they may change back when the dhcp is renewed
2009-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	kirb	histo	so for now i have to change this file manually?
2009-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	histo	kirb	well there are some fixes listed on the bug
2009-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	kirb	histo	oh oops k
2009-04-11T22:08:00.000Z	kirb	histo	thanks for everything .. for now ill just write a quick perl script to add that line at the top whenever im done vpn-ing...  you rock sir
