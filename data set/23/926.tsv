2011-02-09T02:38:00.000Z	accel		why can't i do "apt-get install gentoo; apt-get purge ubuntu" ?
2011-02-09T02:38:00.000Z	jrib	accel	it's "ubuntu-desktop", not "ubuntu"
2011-02-09T02:39:00.000Z	jrib	accel	choose "recovery mode" at the grub menu
2011-02-09T02:40:00.000Z	accel	jrib	still tries to start X
2011-02-09T02:40:00.000Z	jrib	accel	should not, it should offer you a menu of choices (one of them involving X, but one of them being just a root prompt)
2011-02-09T02:40:00.000Z	accel	jrib	no ... it just tries to start in recovery mode
2011-02-09T02:40:00.000Z	accel	jrib	a bunch of text flies by in a terminal
2011-02-09T02:40:00.000Z	accel	jrib	then it appears to try to start X
2011-02-09T02:41:00.000Z	accel	jrib	do I need to edit the grub line?
2011-02-09T02:42:00.000Z	jrib	accel	did you run "check the cd for defects" (or whatever the checksum option is called nowadays) on your install before installing?  No, you should not need to edit your grub line, recovery mode should just be single user mode anyway
2011-02-09T02:44:00.000Z	accel	jrib	no, didn't check CD for defects
2011-02-09T02:45:00.000Z	jrib	accel	do that
2011-02-09T03:37:00.000Z	jrib	accel	please keep it family friendly here.  What was the result of the cd check?
2011-02-09T03:37:00.000Z	accel	jrib	couldn't cd check
2011-02-09T03:37:00.000Z	accel	jrib	screen goes blank too
2011-02-09T03:37:00.000Z	jrib	accel	why?
2011-02-09T03:37:00.000Z	jrib	accel	how did you install?
2011-02-09T03:38:00.000Z	accel	jrib	tried -desktop -alternatte, now going to try -server
2011-02-09T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	accel	use the disk you installed from
2011-02-09T03:38:00.000Z	accel	jrib	what's truly frustrating
2011-02-09T03:38:00.000Z	accel	jrib	is that until today; ubuntu always worked out of the box for me
