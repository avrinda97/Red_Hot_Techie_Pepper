2007-07-07T09:14:00.000Z	duelboot		I"m going to update fstab and try it again using mount -a eternalswd
2007-07-07T07:06:00.000Z	duelboot		I recently upgraded to fiesty and now my DVD and CDROM drives are not mounting...k3b can't burn to them, but freevo will play a movie if I put it in...but still no mounting...can anyone assist?
2007-07-07T07:07:00.000Z	duelboot		hello netyire I'm back again
2007-07-07T07:07:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	I have a similar issue such as what you describe, try doing lshw and see what it reports of any cdrom like drives
2007-07-07T07:07:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	I think the problem is they are on the same port or something and udev set it up wrong.
2007-07-07T07:08:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	does it automount anything onto your desktop when you place media into it?
2007-07-07T07:08:00.000Z	duelboot	gerro	anyway to auto reconfigure for fstab?
2007-07-07T07:08:00.000Z	duelboot	gerro	yes, but it still tells me it's not mounted!!!
2007-07-07T07:08:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	I have a wusb54gsc wireless usb adapter and lexmark x83 printer I had to set custom rules for in udev, I'm guessing something similar to that
2007-07-07T07:08:00.000Z	duelboot	gerro	I can play music cds and watch movies though...oddd
2007-07-07T07:09:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	that is very odd.. perhaps do mess with fstab some
2007-07-07T07:10:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	though I have this ati radeon video card in this computer working fine but it says in lshw its "unclaimed" I have no clue what that means but there are other devices like that, does it say that about your drive?
2007-07-07T07:10:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	I think its only using half the dedicated video ram in this comp :/
2007-07-07T07:11:00.000Z	duelboot	gerro	no it gives me the description and other info is all filled in
2007-07-07T07:12:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	are these devices external or connected through a firewire?
2007-07-07T07:12:00.000Z	duelboot	gerro	nope
2007-07-07T07:13:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	reminds me of a funny problem I had with a laptop before, it had a floppy drive that could be switched out with a dvd drive. I couldn't boot off of it and it thought both drives were same one
2007-07-07T07:13:00.000Z	duelboot	gerro	^^^
2007-07-07T07:14:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	by switching a real cdrom drive in and turning off floppy I could install but didn't have that drive so I did a network based install of xubuntu :)
2007-07-07T07:14:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	would you mind posting a forum about your problem? perhaps I can comment about mine too because it sounds very similar
2007-07-07T07:15:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	I mean I haven't tried mine yet but it says it won't burn
2007-07-07T07:15:00.000Z	duelboot	gerro	maybe, but right now I want a solution...oh, did I mention I want it now?   :)
2007-07-07T07:16:00.000Z	gerro	duelboot	/join #gerro a sec :)
