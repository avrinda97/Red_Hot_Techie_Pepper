2005-05-23T05:40:00.000Z	bigbill52a		tried it...gnome is still the most stable
2005-05-23T05:41:00.000Z	bigbill52a		and multimedia works like real player
2005-05-23T05:42:00.000Z	bigbill52a		stuff works
2005-05-23T05:42:00.000Z	bigbill52a		yes
2005-05-23T05:43:00.000Z	bigbill52a		it is included in the sources.list that the unofficial guide recommends
2005-05-23T05:44:00.000Z	bigbill52a		yes
2005-05-23T05:44:00.000Z	bigbill52a		to what they recommended...
2005-05-23T05:45:00.000Z	bigbill52a		and all my multimedia and ati drivers work for the first time in any linux distro
2005-05-23T05:45:00.000Z	bigbill52a		same here
2005-05-23T05:47:00.000Z	bigbill52a		i love pan newsreader...i wish that they had a windows version
2005-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	there is a windows version of pan
2005-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	you get it at the same place you get the linux ver
2005-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	the link to the win32 pan, also leads you to gtk for windows
2005-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	so its really not that different in appearance from the linux ver
2005-05-28T14:44:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	what? sata ide?
2005-05-28T15:34:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	i like the fact that amd runs on less power and produces more
2005-05-28T15:34:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	but i fear that continuing this line of chat will start the "vi vs emacs" debate
2005-05-28T15:36:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	a client consulted me t'other day, so we went to a local chinese puter slop, er shop and got a duron 1.8 box+monitor for a reasonable $
2005-05-28T15:36:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	i set him up with ubuntu, and was frankly amazed at the speed
2005-05-28T15:42:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	i've got my (if i win a lotto) eye on a dual-proc, dual-core amd64 box, but will probably settle on a single plain ol' amd64 box
2005-05-28T15:44:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	yes with hypertransport and a sh**pot of ram, i'm sure it will be
2005-05-28T15:46:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	now why'd ya have to start with the foul language? i at least use ** to cover the dirt
2005-05-28T15:48:00.000Z	nalioth	bigbill52a	yes it does, but please spare my sensitive stomach and don't mention that vile winduhs thang again
