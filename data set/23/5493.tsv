2007-09-01T05:56:00.000Z	daynah		Have any of you used nvidia settings to do dual monitors? everything is opening in the "middle" aka the part between my two screens ><
2007-09-01T05:56:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	That's what i'm doing right now
2007-09-01T05:57:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	fixing the weird middle thing or just getting it set up
2007-09-01T05:57:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	both
2007-09-01T05:57:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	If you can get it working, a compositing window manager like beryl or compiz sorts the problem out. Windows maximize only to one screen, open in the middle of the "active" screen, and so on
2007-09-01T05:58:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	I followed tons of guides and then I just typed gksudo nvidia-settings
2007-09-01T05:58:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	I wasted my time editing xorg
2007-09-01T05:58:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	thanks, Ill search around beryl. Havent upgraded sls
2007-09-01T05:58:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	For dualview, editing xorg is really quite difficult
2007-09-01T05:59:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	Feisty had the right drivers for me... I think my friend (a nvidia fanboy) got we that package ages ago. Bet it's seriousy great. Try it :) Can't hurt
2007-09-01T05:59:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	it's just a gui manager
2007-09-01T06:00:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	Yes. nvidia-settings is just a GUI for editing xorg.conf, but doing it manually can be difficult, especially with the lack of difinitive documentation.
2007-09-01T06:01:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	oh sorry I thought you needed help and I had JUST done it. Like 5 minutes ago
2007-09-01T06:02:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	heh. no need to be sorry, it's easy for me to lose track of what i'm saying when it's 1AM in such a busy channel
2007-09-01T06:05:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	alse do you know how to get the menu bar buttons only on one screen?
2007-09-01T06:06:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	Once again, compiz-fusion has sorted that out for me, and beryl in the past. Once one or the other is installed, i just dragged the bar onto the side of the monitor i wanted it
2007-09-01T06:07:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	one day I'm going to find the setting and it's going to be something pain fully obvious and I'm going to hit myself
2007-09-01T06:09:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	Yeah, i'm sure there's a way to do it outside of a compositing window manager, but i was wanting one anyway, and it happened to fix the issue of dualscreen behaving like one mega-screen at the same time
2007-09-01T06:10:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	yeah and I already have beryl so it'd be a nice fix. If I were not so blonde.
2007-09-01T06:10:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	you did use twinview right?
2007-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	Yep, twinview, with compiz fusion (allthough beryl has worked for me in the past).
2007-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	daynah	Esteth	eh time for a nap. Thanks!! :)
2007-09-01T06:12:00.000Z	Esteth	daynah	np, have a nice nap :)
