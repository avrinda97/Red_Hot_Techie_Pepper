2006-05-19T07:16:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	It has nothing to do with gstreamer though, it's your alsa driver that isn't loaded, and that's why gstreamer isnt working.
2006-05-19T07:18:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	Type 'lspci' and find what sound card you have first.
2006-05-19T07:19:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	in a terminal window Click Applications/Terminal
2006-05-19T07:19:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	Sorry, Applications/Accessories/Terminal
2006-05-19T07:20:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	Type lspci
2006-05-19T07:21:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	Intel what?
2006-05-19T07:22:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	It should say "Multimedia audio controller:", then some model number.
2006-05-19T07:23:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	One of those is the sound card.
2006-05-19T07:27:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	s|k asked you to copy the output of lspci and paste it on http://rafb.net/paste/ then give us the address.  Did you do that?
2006-05-19T07:28:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	Whatever lspci says.
2006-05-19T07:30:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	You might want to try this in the terminal: sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel
2006-05-19T07:34:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	Don't paste that much text in here again please.
2006-05-19T07:36:00.000Z	Curtman	ubuntu	Did you try this?   sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel
