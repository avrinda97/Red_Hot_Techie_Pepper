2009-06-20T20:18:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	when you test the ports are you doing it from inside the lan or outside?
2009-06-24T09:51:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	using a PPA on launchpad?
2009-06-24T09:49:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	did you say something?
2009-06-24T09:50:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	you have to ask the question..
2009-06-24T09:51:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	is it the version that came with xubuntu or did you install from someplace else?
2009-06-24T09:52:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	you didn't add one?
2009-06-24T09:53:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	I've forgotten.. does xubuntu come with a version of OOo?
2009-06-24T09:54:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	you added.. hummm.. what did you add?
2009-06-24T09:56:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	that shouldn't be enough to cause any issues.
2009-06-24T09:57:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	you might try uninstalling the same packages and see if that fixes it.. if it does then you should file a bug report.
2009-06-24T09:58:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	you also might ask in #xubuntu
2009-06-24T09:58:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	just uninstall first and test..
2009-06-24T09:58:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	sure
2009-06-24T09:59:00.000Z	scunizi	gumbotron	go back to synaptic and search for open office.. click the little box again and choose purge
