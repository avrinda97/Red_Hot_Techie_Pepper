2007-03-17T09:42:00.000Z	tombow		actually, mono supports asp.net
2007-03-17T09:42:00.000Z	BigLebowski		Heh, I love linux, but, .NET is a fantastic dev platform
2007-03-17T09:43:00.000Z	tombow		.net sucks ass
2007-03-17T09:43:00.000Z	BigLebowski		And mono is getting better.
2007-03-17T09:43:00.000Z	tombow		.net is for corporate drones
2007-03-17T09:43:00.000Z	BigLebowski	tombow	any technical reasons for such a statement? or just pure eletism?
2007-03-17T09:44:00.000Z	tombow	BigLebowski	not much specific to .net (most apply to C++ and java as well)
2007-03-17T09:45:00.000Z	BigLebowski	tombow	fair enough, and you're prefered dev language/framework?
2007-03-17T09:45:00.000Z	BigLebowski		And i agree on C++, half arsed OO Implementation
2007-03-17T09:49:00.000Z	tombow		keysym Escape = grave asciitilde

2007-03-17T09:52:00.000Z	BigLebowski		The biggest pain in the ass on linux is X, period.
2007-03-17T09:53:00.000Z	tombow		"setting up sendmail" is right below "cure cancer" and "sleep with japanese twins" in my list of things to do before i die
2007-03-17T09:53:00.000Z	BigLebowski		Almost any problem i've ever spent more than 20 mins fixing is normally X.
2007-03-17T09:54:00.000Z	tombow		tombow
2007-03-17T09:54:00.000Z	tombow		wait..
