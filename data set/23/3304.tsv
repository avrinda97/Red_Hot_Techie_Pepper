2008-05-19T02:33:00.000Z	ZoRaC		Hi! I'm trying to install Ubuntu 8.04 on a laptop it gets to "Loading, please wait..." then it ends up on commandline ("ubuntu@ubuntu") - any ideas?
2008-05-19T02:34:00.000Z	minion35	ZoRaC	: did you install the boot loader?
2008-05-19T02:35:00.000Z	minion35		blacking : try making your own themes and backgrounds. always an easy place to start
2008-05-19T02:35:00.000Z	ZoRaC	minion35	This is before the installation i started. I select the option to install Ubuntu and then after some loading it just stops and shows the commandline :(
2008-05-19T02:35:00.000Z	minion35	ZoRaC	: select the option run live cd
2008-05-19T02:36:00.000Z	ZoRaC	minion35	I tried that too, it freeze after "runing local bootscript [OK]" or something like that...
2008-05-19T02:36:00.000Z	minion35	ZoRaC	: what specs are your machine?
