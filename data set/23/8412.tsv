2011-09-06T05:48:00.000Z	freshone0		and if one does not want a partition will it work
2011-09-06T05:50:00.000Z	freshone0		what should ber the mount location or point for the 400 gb partition?
2011-09-06T05:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 mount it whever you want. dependign on your needs
2011-09-06T05:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 a home 'file' ?
2011-09-06T06:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 why are you not wanting parittions?
2011-09-06T06:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 if its mounted to /   then you are using it...
2012-05-20T00:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 use gparted and arange it how you like.
2012-05-20T00:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 or use 'fdisk' or 'cfdisk'
2012-05-20T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 you dont repartion filesystems that are in use normally
2012-05-20T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 is there data on that drive you want to keep?
2012-05-20T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 so you are installing ubuntu to it?
2012-05-20T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 unmount the fileystems in use.. use gparted to delete the filesystems, apply changes, done. then remake them how you want.
2012-05-20T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 so you have 1 or 2 hard drives?
2012-05-20T00:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 so... you need to clarify what it is you want to do exactly.   you just asked how to format the hard disk.. when aparently you mean you want to 'resize the filesystems'
2012-05-20T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 now thats somthign differnt you just asked how to do. ;) So.. HOW is the disk partioned now?
2012-05-20T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 so.. you want it how exactly? and how is it now?
2012-05-20T00:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 a pastebin of 'sudo fdisk -l' output may help clarify things also.
2012-05-20T00:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 just find the files and delete them...
2012-05-20T00:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	freshone0	 delete all of what files exactly? the users home dirs?
