2012-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		I need to tag with EasyTag only, but when I try Rhthmbox's built-in tagging, it works.
2012-11-25T17:05:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		but in this situation, I can only use EasyTag

2012-11-25T17:12:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	kutu_	there might be a PDF to HTML converter in existence, but I couldn't imagine it working very well, considering the big transition in format capabilities.
