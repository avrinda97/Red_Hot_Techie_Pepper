2011-08-07T00:28:00.000Z	CoJaBo		How do I get GIMP to do... anything at all but segfault? Running Kubuntu 11.04.
2011-08-07T00:28:00.000Z	CoJaBo		installing from apt-get install gimp
2011-08-07T00:29:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	fix your memory
2011-08-07T00:30:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	 crashes immediately in startup, if it was that bad a mammary error, it'd effect other apps...
2011-08-07T00:30:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	one would think
2011-08-07T00:31:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	mv ~/.gimp-2.6 ~/.gimp-2.6-backup && sudo apt-get install --reinstall gimp
2011-08-07T00:31:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	 i.e., before gui even.. total exec time is 840 ms start to crash -_-'
2011-08-07T00:34:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	It doesn't get far enough to create the .gimp dir. Waiting on the reinstall now
2011-08-07T00:35:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	Yeh, still segfaults after the reinstall :/
2011-08-07T00:36:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	install the gimp-dbg package and run it with gdb. See where it crashes
2011-08-07T00:36:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	also, pastebin the output of 'apt-cache policy gimp'
2011-08-07T00:40:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	http://paste.ubuntu.com/660072/ , also, how do I run it in gdb?
2011-08-07T00:41:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	gdb gimp
2011-08-07T00:43:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	http://paste.ubuntu.com/660073/ , but appearently missing symbols for..something
2011-08-07T00:44:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	you need the libgtk2.0-0-dbgsym package
2011-08-07T00:48:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	http://paste.ubuntu.com/660075/
2011-08-07T00:50:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	do you have a .gtkrc with crap in it?
2011-08-07T00:50:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	can you run 'strace -f gimp', maybe it's trying to parse a broken configfile and hitting a bug
2011-08-07T00:53:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	http://paste.ubuntu.com/660080/
2011-08-07T00:58:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	it looks related to your theme, it crashes when initializing parts of it
2011-08-07T00:59:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	Yeh, indeed I just found that. It was set to Oxygen, I changed it to the only other, Raleigh- Someone should probably put a workaround bug or somethng for that..
2011-08-07T01:02:00.000Z	CoJaBo	Seveas	Thanks for the help tracking it down
2011-08-07T01:02:00.000Z	Seveas	CoJaBo	np
