2009-07-10T02:07:00.000Z	Wolter		hi
2009-07-10T02:07:00.000Z	Wolter		how do i copy a cd's boot sector?
2009-07-10T02:08:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	try checking for a boot looking file, like boot.img or something
2009-07-10T02:08:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	it might be 1.44MB or 2.88MB
2009-07-10T02:08:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	are you talking about a floppy?
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	Some CDs use floppy images for booting
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	are you trying to make your own bootable CD?
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	i see
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	no, i am rather trying to copy windows xp's bootsector into my usb
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	Wolter		but i didn't want to make it offtopic
2009-07-10T02:09:00.000Z	Wolter		people start whining
2009-07-10T02:10:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	Oh, cool.  Sorta like a bartpe CD, only on a USB drive?
2009-07-10T02:10:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	if i do an exact copy of the cd, will it contain the boot sector?
2009-07-10T02:10:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	i guess
2009-07-10T02:10:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	I think so
2009-07-10T02:10:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	Are you trying to do an installation on a computer that doesn't have a CD drive on it (like a netbook, for example)?
2009-07-10T02:10:00.000Z	Wolter		like acer aspire 1? yes
2009-07-10T02:11:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	so, should Bootable_NoEmulation.img do it?
2009-07-10T02:12:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	I'm not sure, that sounds right though
2009-07-10T02:13:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	Keep in mind that USB to IDE adapters tend to be around $20, you could hook a CD drive up to your netbook just to start the install
2009-07-10T02:13:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	yeah, i'm just trying to make a bootable usb
2009-07-10T02:14:00.000Z	Igg-man	Wolter	But you want to boot to windows?
2009-07-10T02:14:00.000Z	Wolter	Igg-man	going to eat, now, please tell me everything through pm now, i don't want to scroll back meters and meters of text :)
