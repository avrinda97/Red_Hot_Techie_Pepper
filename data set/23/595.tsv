2012-09-05T07:56:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	the first time it booted it went into low graphic mode and then i restarted it and it type nomodeset again and it worked
2012-09-05T07:56:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	OK so you've got the GUI with windows and mouse again now?
2012-09-05T07:56:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	 yes
2012-09-05T07:57:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	right, start that terminal again, then do "gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub"
2012-09-05T07:58:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	 okay
2012-09-05T07:58:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	OK... find that line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="" and insert in the quotemarks nomodeset so you have ...="nomodeset"
2012-09-05T07:59:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	 got it
2012-09-05T07:59:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	want me to save now?
2012-09-05T07:59:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	great. Now File > Save and quit the editor, back to the command line
2012-09-05T07:59:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	 okay back
2012-09-05T07:59:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	then you can do "sudo update-grub" and let it fix that change for all future boots
2012-09-05T08:00:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	I guess you'd best reboot and prove that has fixed it before I go off to bed! :p
2012-09-05T08:00:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	back? from where? you mean the terminal prompt?
2012-09-05T08:01:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	 yeah haha! and no i mean like theres usually ruben@ruben inspiron then like dash and the moneys ign and what not but right now there isnt
2012-09-05T08:01:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	have you done "sudo update-grub" yet?
2012-09-05T08:02:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	 how do i like reset the terminal
2012-09-05T08:02:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	If you're in that terminal window... and you don't see the prompt... try just pressing enter a few times to give it a reminder
2012-09-05T08:03:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	 usually before i give a prompt it says :ruben@ruben-Inspiron-1100:~$
2012-09-05T08:03:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	 did you quit out of the text-editor? if you didn't that might keep the prompt from re-appearing
2012-09-05T08:03:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	If all else fails, close the terminal window and start a new one :D
2012-09-05T08:04:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	do we know what it's doing? :)
2012-09-05T08:04:00.000Z	rubenjr	TJ-	updating grub haha
2012-09-05T08:04:00.000Z	TJ-	rubenjr	ha! phew
