2008-12-07T02:15:00.000Z	_x86_		hello
2008-12-07T02:16:00.000Z	_x86_		does anyone know how to upgrade form breezy to 8.04 release of ubuntu  ?
2008-12-07T02:16:00.000Z	_x86_		im truing but i cant must have bad repos or smthing
2008-12-07T02:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	prolly not bad repos, probably closed repos.
2008-12-07T02:17:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	yes but should i but the dapper ones ?
2008-12-07T02:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	highly unlikely that is gonna work either... there's another version between 5.04 and 6.06, that is well past its end of life
2008-12-07T02:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	i think your best bet, would probably be to do a clean install of 8.10
2008-12-07T02:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	well, then have at it..
2008-12-07T02:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	very unlikely, you can try, but be prepared for a system that wont' boot.
2008-12-07T02:21:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	do you know about doing bootable usbs ?
2008-12-07T02:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	i've done it before, and generally found it a poor way to run a distro
2008-12-07T02:21:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	not live heh
2008-12-07T02:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	are you wanting to run a live USB disk, or install to a USB disk.
2008-12-07T02:21:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	install form an usb see
2008-12-07T02:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	oh, that generally works just fine.. google "Unetbootin"
2008-12-07T02:22:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	yes i tried it from windows but went wrong :(
2008-12-07T02:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	well, that doesn't make sense, i've used unetbootin numerous times w/o issue.
2008-12-07T02:24:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	were zould yo d/l the boot.iso that i should burn then ?
2008-12-07T02:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	you don't need a boot iso w/ unetbootin
2008-12-07T02:25:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	unetbootin doesnt update instantly the distribs so it doesnt have fedora core 10 last time i saw it...
2008-12-07T02:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	then download the fedora 10 iso, and use it manually...
2008-12-07T02:33:00.000Z	_x86_	IndyGunFreak	http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora-all the install dvd will work with unetbootin u think ?
2008-12-07T02:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_x86_	all youc an do is try, download the ISO, and use unetbootin to put it on a USB, and boot it and see what happens
