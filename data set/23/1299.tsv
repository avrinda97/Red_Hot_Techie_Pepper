2010-05-23T18:37:00.000Z	bbdude		can anyone help me here?
2010-05-23T18:37:00.000Z	bbdude		Okay
2010-05-23T18:37:00.000Z	bbdude		I just installed ubuntu via wubi on a pent 4 1.7 with 512 mb of ram
2010-05-23T18:37:00.000Z	bbdude		and
2010-05-23T18:38:00.000Z	bbdude		everything's real slow
2010-05-23T18:38:00.000Z	bbdude		it took 20 minutes to install the flash plugin in firefox
2010-05-23T18:38:00.000Z	bbdude		I don't understand though
2010-05-23T18:39:00.000Z	bbdude		how is XP faster than ubuntu on this computer
2010-05-23T18:40:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	XP was released back in 2001.
2010-05-23T18:40:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	and comes with almost no usable function. You have to download and install everything
2010-05-23T18:40:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	It runs faster than Vista/7 for me :P
2010-05-23T18:47:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	9800 PRO isn't supported by the lastest ATI drivers
2010-05-23T18:48:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	they're compatible only up to 9.04 release, tho
2010-05-23T18:49:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	I'd honestly give the r300g driver a shot
2010-05-23T18:50:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	a very bleeding edge driver that uses a new mesa architecture
2010-05-23T18:51:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	google for xorg-edgers PPA
2010-05-23T19:04:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	the page has a key for you to add.
2010-05-23T19:08:00.000Z	bbdude	Daekdroom	there's no key on the site
2010-05-23T19:08:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	are you on the launchpad page?
2010-05-23T19:08:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	there should be
2010-05-23T19:09:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
2010-05-23T19:09:00.000Z	Daekdroom	bbdude	under technical details
