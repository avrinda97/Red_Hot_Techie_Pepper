2007-05-22T16:19:00.000Z	perl_contract		hi folks. I'm a long time linux user, but first time playing with ubuntu. when you boot into the live environment, do you pick packages first then do install to install them? or how does picking packages work?
2007-05-22T16:20:00.000Z	perl_contract		weird.
2007-05-22T16:20:00.000Z	perl_contract		then you install more/deinstall packages after install?
2007-05-22T16:22:00.000Z	perl_contract		one more question about installation. I already have Windows XP on the first partition and am installing ubuntu after that. but grub just shows "boot stage 1.5" then hangs on boot. any ideas?
2007-05-22T16:24:00.000Z	perl_contract		hmmm
2007-05-22T16:24:00.000Z	perl_contract		on mine they're hdb
2007-05-22T16:24:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	you using a pre-Feisty ubuntu?
2007-05-22T16:25:00.000Z	perl_contract	SlimeyPete	dunno. grabbed it from the website
2007-05-22T16:26:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	oh. Odd. That should be Feisty then. It's evidently decided you're special and you deserve /dev/hd* ;)
2007-05-22T16:26:00.000Z	perl_contract	SlimeyPete	ubuntu-7.04-desktop
2007-05-22T16:26:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	it's Feisty, the latest one (with the new kernel which should put everything in /dev/sd*)
2007-05-22T16:27:00.000Z	perl_contract	SlimeyPete	so I'm special then? or is it a PATA thing?
2007-05-22T16:28:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	you're special.
2007-05-22T16:28:00.000Z	perl_contract	SlimeyPete	any tips on making grub behave with windows xp?
2007-05-22T16:28:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	what's the problem, exactly?
2007-05-22T16:28:00.000Z	perl_contract	SlimeyPete	grub hangs with "stage 1.5", then hard disk light stays on forever
2007-05-22T16:30:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	hmm, not sure. My usual advice in these situations is "check c:\boot.ini" - it can conflict with grub (particularly wrt partition numbers)
2007-05-22T16:30:00.000Z	perl_contract	SlimeyPete	what should boot.ini say for /boot on /dev/hdb6 ?
2007-05-22T16:31:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	boot.ini should mention linux stuff... it's a windows thing (it configures the windows bootloader). It only needs to know about windows partitions.
2007-05-22T16:32:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	*shouldn't mention
2007-05-22T16:32:00.000Z	perl_contract	SlimeyPete	is grub installed on /boot, or just in the mbr?
2007-05-22T16:33:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	in the mbr, usually. That's the default.
2007-05-22T16:33:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	perl_contract	but its config files are often in /boot/grub
