2008-07-16T17:05:00.000Z	unop	sebrock	have you verified that you are using the right syntax in the sudoers file?  if you are not sure, see the sudoers manpage
2008-07-16T18:09:00.000Z	sebrock	unop	I know thats why thought changing sudoers file would work
2008-07-16T18:10:00.000Z	unop	sebrock	it ought to -- let's see your sudoers file.   use this command and give us the url it returns.   which pastebinit || sudo apt-get install pastebinit; pastebinit</etc/sudoers

2008-07-16T18:18:00.000Z	sebrock	unop	makes no changes
2008-07-16T18:18:00.000Z	unop	sebrock	out of curiosity, how are you trying to execute these commands?
2008-07-16T18:19:00.000Z	sebrock	unop	will do many times on my frontend in the future
2008-07-16T18:19:00.000Z	unop	sebrock	yes, i understand that -- but just how exactly are reboot, poweroff, etc called?
2008-07-16T18:20:00.000Z	unop	sebrock	are they called from within a script? or at a command line?
2008-07-16T18:21:00.000Z	sebrock	unop	via irexec and script
2008-07-16T18:21:00.000Z	unop	sebrock	right, is the script calling poweroff via sudo ?
2008-07-16T18:22:00.000Z	sebrock	unop	damn.. Im stupid
2008-07-16T18:22:00.000Z	unop	sebrock	heh, no sudo?
2008-07-16T18:23:00.000Z	sebrock	unop	thanks for the help anyways
