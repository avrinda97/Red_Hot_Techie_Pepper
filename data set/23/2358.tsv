2009-05-06T12:51:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	try mplayer or VLC
2009-05-06T12:51:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	they will play just about anything you want.
2009-05-06T12:51:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	I recommend VLC ( www.videolan.org ), however to each their own. Its also available in synaptic.
2009-05-06T12:52:00.000Z	vegombrei	roadmap	even vlc fails to play the dvd now ... thing is i recently upgraded to the latest ubuntu version ... it just stopped playing .. first i looked up medibuntu but thats all sorted .. just dont understand why it wont play dvds anymore
2009-05-06T12:52:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	are you playing the DVD with dvdsimple:// ?
2009-05-06T12:53:00.000Z	vegombrei	roadmap	vlc
2009-05-06T12:53:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	VLC has different options for playing DVDs. One of them is dvdsimple://. I think the option is "Skip DVD Menus" or something when loading a DVD. I'd have to check.
2009-05-06T12:53:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	The latest VLC (0.9.9?) breaks that feature.
2009-05-06T12:54:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	The option is "No DVD Menus". If you're playing a DVD in VLC using that option, VLC (as of the latest version) will crash, or refuse to play.
2009-05-06T12:55:00.000Z	vegombrei	roadmap	it says Playback failure:
2009-05-06T12:56:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	try apt-get install libdvdcss2 libdvdnav4
2009-05-06T12:56:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	see if they are already installed.
2009-05-06T12:57:00.000Z	vegombrei	roadmap	installing ..
2009-05-06T12:57:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	we just found your problem :) assuming both install.
2009-05-06T12:58:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	after they're installed then try playing the DVD with VLC (you may want to restart VLC first)
2009-05-06T13:01:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	success... ?
2009-05-06T13:01:00.000Z	vegombrei	roadmap	no success ... i think i should restart
2009-05-06T13:02:00.000Z	vegombrei	roadmap	something weird happened at the medibuntu page
2009-05-06T13:02:00.000Z	roadmap	vegombrei	hm.. Give it a shot. If it works, let me know!
2009-05-06T13:04:00.000Z	vegombrei	roadmap	sure thing ... brb
