2008-08-17T22:33:00.000Z	wols_	Sir^Quicken	I just told you. and this is no Ubuntu support question either even
2008-08-17T22:36:00.000Z	wols_	Sir^Quicken	it's a colinux question and I already answered it long ago. please stop being offtopic
2008-08-17T22:37:00.000Z	wols_	Sir^Quicken	that makes it still offtopic. ask colinux people, not us
2008-08-17T22:39:00.000Z	wols_	Sir^Quicken	you cannot do it. end of story. not with colinux at least
2008-08-17T22:39:00.000Z	wols_	Sir^Quicken	for the third time since you don't read much: NO
2008-08-17T22:40:00.000Z	wols_	Sir^Quicken	your colinux kernel is NOT ubuntu, no matter how loud you scream
