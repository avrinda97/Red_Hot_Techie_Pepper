2006-11-22T09:14:00.000Z	deusjevoo		that's its max speed?
2006-11-22T09:14:00.000Z	deusjevoo		ok, and the media, 48 or 52 ?
2006-11-22T09:14:00.000Z	deusjevoo		brand?
2006-11-22T09:15:00.000Z	deusjevoo		I mean the disk you're gonna burn, what speed is that?
2006-11-22T09:15:00.000Z	Qshadowp	deusjevoo	no clue either lol
2006-11-22T09:15:00.000Z	Qshadowp		just some blank ritecs i picked up at the shop
2006-11-22T09:15:00.000Z	deusjevoo		maybe your burner doesn't know the right strategy for it and needs a firmware update
2006-11-22T09:16:00.000Z	deusjevoo		don't go slower then 4x
2006-11-22T09:16:00.000Z	deusjevoo		as its probably a high speed media
2006-11-22T09:16:00.000Z	Qshadowp		ok
2006-11-22T09:16:00.000Z	deusjevoo		normally, 8x should be a better value, if your system is fast enough
2006-11-22T09:17:00.000Z	Qshadowp		yea 8x was the slowest nero would allow me to go
2006-11-22T09:17:00.000Z	deusjevoo		you could try an RW
2006-11-22T09:17:00.000Z	Qshadowp	deusjevoo	don't have any lol
2006-11-22T09:18:00.000Z	Qshadowp		i don't burn discs that often
2006-11-22T09:18:00.000Z	Qshadowp		i use a virtual drive in windows for any isos i get ;)
