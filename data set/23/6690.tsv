2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	LiNova		I cannot use any of the programs in the admin menu and i'm the only user. Does anyone know what's wrong?
2006-01-27T10:19:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	have you enabled root for some reason?
2006-01-27T10:20:00.000Z	LiNova	_jason	what?
2006-01-27T10:20:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	I was asking if you ever enabled the root password for some reason (ie set a password for root (which you are not supposed to do))
2006-01-27T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	you probably didn't if you can't remember.  So let's assume that's not the problem.  What does the command 'groups' output?
2006-01-27T10:24:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	does 'sudo echo hi' output hi?
2006-01-27T10:25:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	umm ok hold on, if you can view /etc/sudoers on the other partition, just pastebin that
2006-01-27T10:28:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	are you on windows now?
2006-01-27T10:28:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	how do you cat /etc/sudoers on windows? (curious)
2006-01-27T10:29:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	google 'explore2fs' so you can view the files on your ubuntu partition while you are on windows
2006-01-27T10:31:00.000Z	LiNova	_jason	ok i got the prog
2006-01-27T10:34:00.000Z	LiNova	_jason	i got the prog
2006-01-27T10:34:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	okay, run it and paste the contents of /etc/sudoers on pastebin please
2006-01-27T10:36:00.000Z	LiNova	_jason	there doesn't seem to be a dudoers in /etc
2006-01-27T10:37:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	are you sure?
2006-01-27T10:39:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	right click, there should be an option to read it or copy somewhere
2006-01-27T10:41:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	don't paste here!
2006-01-27T10:42:00.000Z	_jason	LiNova	okay, that's not the problem... what exactly happens when you click on the icon for one of the admin tools.  Does it prompt you for a password?  Do you enter your user password?
