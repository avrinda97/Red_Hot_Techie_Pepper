2012-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	iNTEl	cfhowlett	: ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo grub-install /dev/sda3 /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for /boot/grub (is /dev mounted?).
2012-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	why did you put select /sda/dev3?  usually, grub goes to /sda/dev
2012-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	iNTEl	cfhowlett	: am installing ubuntu on dev/sda6 and i choosed dev/sda3  as a boot loader
2012-09-11T15:45:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	how many partitions have you got now?
2012-09-11T15:46:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	grub will not wipe drives
2012-09-11T15:46:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	worst case, you have to configure the bootloader...
2012-09-11T15:47:00.000Z	iNTEl	cfhowlett	: k
2012-09-11T15:47:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	understood.  breath.
2012-09-11T15:47:00.000Z	iNTEl	cfhowlett	: k am breathing all i wanna is restore my ubuntu
2012-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	try grub-install /dev/sda
2012-09-11T15:49:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	try sudo grub-install /dev/sda
2012-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	just to confirm, ONE hdd, right?
2012-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	iNTEl	cfhowlett	, its 1 hard disk
2012-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	ok.  next thought: did you allow ubuntu to automatically partition or did you manually do it?
2012-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	iNTEl	cfhowlett	: 6 partitions , 1 hard disk , ubuntu installed on dev/sda6 15 GB , boot loader on dev/sda3
2012-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	final question: you DID remember that windows and ubuntu both like MBR partition schemes?  And that means no more than 4 primary partitions?
2012-09-11T15:56:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	follow the link Action Parsnip sent
2012-09-11T16:00:00.000Z	iNTEl	cfhowlett	: there is a lot of commands
2012-09-11T16:01:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	slow down.  take your time.  this can be fixed.
2012-09-11T16:05:00.000Z	cfhowlett	iNTEl	that's one way to fix it...
