2012-07-03T12:51:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	why use wubi? and why use 10.04?
2012-07-03T12:53:00.000Z	gagan662	goddard	1:I tried from live media but problem persists. 2: i dont like unity :)
2012-07-03T12:54:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	you can run classic gnome in 12.04
2012-07-03T12:54:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	it is super simple
2012-07-03T12:57:00.000Z	gagan662	goddard	yeah it's an alternative.But don't you know how to fix issue
2012-07-03T12:59:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	could be a few issues honestly
2012-07-03T12:59:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	how is the health of the drive?
2012-07-03T13:01:00.000Z	gagan662	goddard	i have another issue(independent of version) when i run ubuntu from live system hangs nd i have to force shutdown the system
2012-07-03T13:03:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	what machine are you running?

2012-07-03T13:05:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	usually if the live media doesn't work then Ubuntu won't work on the system or the CD is bad
2012-07-03T13:06:00.000Z	gagan662	goddard	i compared th hashes . media is ok
2012-07-03T13:06:00.000Z	gagan662	goddard	the*
2012-07-03T13:08:00.000Z	goddard	gagan662	without digging into it to deeply then I would just give 12.04 a go.  If your heart is set on 10.04 I would do some hardware error checking and if you confident it is ok then you can dig into the forums and internet for related hardware issues
2012-07-03T13:11:00.000Z	gagan662	goddard	i will give 12.04 a try. thanks
2012-07-03T15:28:00.000Z	gagan662	goddard	there?
