2005-09-27T11:02:00.000Z	bananaman_		ok then... i boot up ubuntu and after seeing the graphical login my screen goes blank, no signal is recieved by my monitor... then i press ctrl+alt+backspace and it seems to refresh and i can see it again, and THIS time it doesnt disappear and works fine from then on... whats the problem? its annoying to keep having to press that everytime i boot up...
2005-09-27T11:04:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	also check .xsession-errors
2005-09-27T11:04:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	~/.xsession-errors
2005-09-27T11:06:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	is that a command i type at the root?
2005-09-27T11:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	nope, it's a file in your home directory. open it up in a text editor
2005-09-27T11:12:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	i foudn the file, its called Xorg.0.log... but i dont see any errors in it...
2005-09-27T11:12:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	what about ~/.xsession-errors ?
2005-09-27T11:13:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	i cant find that file
2005-09-27T11:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	oh okay, do u use gnome?
2005-09-27T11:13:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	yes

2005-09-27T11:16:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	i found the xsession-errors...sorry im new... let me check if i can find something
2005-09-27T11:17:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	this is what appears over and over again "failed request with status 1030"
2005-09-27T11:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	i dunno what that means, but please do file a bug on bugzilla.ubuntu.com, with all this information
2005-09-27T11:18:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	alright, thank you
2005-09-27T11:19:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	should i delete what you said?
2005-09-27T11:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	try that, it works for me when such a problem arises :)
2005-09-27T11:19:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	alright, so i delete then reboot?
2005-09-27T11:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	you get that problem only on reboot?
2005-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	bananaman_	robotgeek	yes, at the log on screen, it goes blank, and after pressing ctrl+alt+backspace it refreshes or something and it works fine from then on...but its every reboot
2005-09-27T11:22:00.000Z	robotgeek	bananaman_	i dunno if deleting that will help. i have the same problem on breezy whenever x is updated/ something related. but deleting that directory, it works fine
