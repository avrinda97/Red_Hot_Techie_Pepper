2010-08-27T10:34:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		Hi, I am facing a weird problem in my ubuntu 10.04, on startup the windows borders are missing and windows come up at the left side corner only, I can't move, close, minimise or maximise them. The only fix I have found is every startup I go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual Effects I select Extra and then it comes back to normalcy
2010-08-27T10:35:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		anyone ?
2010-08-27T10:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dhruvasagar	For some reason your window manager isn't starting, or is crashing, at login.
2010-08-27T10:35:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	which is the window manager, how do I check it ?
2010-08-27T10:36:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	at startup btw the Visual Effects go to 'None' automatically
2010-08-27T10:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dhruvasagar	When you have desktop effects selected the window manager is "compiz", when you have it set to none the window manager is "metacity".
2010-08-27T10:37:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	I have compiz installed
2010-08-27T10:37:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	how do I check what's wrong with compiz ?
2010-08-27T10:39:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	any tips ?
2010-08-27T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dhruvasagar	What happens if you go back to none? Do your window borders go away again?
2010-08-27T10:41:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	nope
2010-08-27T10:41:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	I think compiz is crashing or something in the startup as you said...should I reinstall it ?
2010-08-27T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dhruvasagar	Could you file a bug report with "ubuntu-bug compiz"?
2010-08-27T10:46:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	ok i'll check that
2010-08-27T10:47:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	wow! I didn't know filing bugs was that easy
2010-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	so I have now filed a bug...
2010-08-27T11:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dhruvasagar	What's the link to the bug? It should contain usefull logs.
2010-08-27T11:21:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/625112
2010-08-27T11:46:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	any clue ?
2010-08-27T11:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dhruvasagar	No, sorry.
2010-08-27T11:47:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	np
2010-08-27T11:47:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Jordan_U	in your opinion, will reinstalling compiz make any difference ?
2010-08-27T11:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dhruvasagar	I wouldn't expect it to, but it can't hurt to try.
