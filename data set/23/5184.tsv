2007-01-26T07:05:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	not as reliable as good old ethernet cable
2007-01-26T07:06:00.000Z	eternaljoy	shatrat	whats ethernet cable?
2007-01-26T07:06:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	the stuff you connect computers with wired, as opposed to wireless.
2007-01-26T07:08:00.000Z	eternaljoy	shatrat	so if I get an ethernet modem, it connectes using wires and cables?
2007-01-26T07:08:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	Yes, thats faster and reliable.  Wireless is best used for laptops or stuff that moves around, or in a house where you can't easily run cables
2007-01-26T07:09:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	but modems dont come in wireless, at least not usually
2007-01-26T07:10:00.000Z	eternaljoy	shatrat	whats a router
2007-01-26T07:10:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	a router connects multiple computers to your modem. a router can be ethernet only, or ethernet and wireless
2007-01-26T07:11:00.000Z	eternaljoy	shatrat	shoild I get the ethernet modem for adsl2?
2007-01-26T07:11:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	Is your computer near the modem?
2007-01-26T07:11:00.000Z	eternaljoy	shatrat	so the ethernet modem is also known as a router?
2007-01-26T07:11:00.000Z	eternaljoy	shatrat	what modem?
2007-01-26T07:12:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	a modem is the thing you hook up to the cable line, or the telephone line, that recieves the signal and translates it to ethernet.  You can plug a router into the modem and it acts as a firewall and can connect to multiple computers
2007-01-26T07:12:00.000Z	shatrat	eternaljoy	you can also connect a computer directly to the modem
2007-01-26T07:12:00.000Z	eternaljoy	shatrat	ok
