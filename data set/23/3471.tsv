2011-03-13T07:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	router	What OS are you running?
2011-03-13T07:33:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	ubuntu
2011-03-13T07:33:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	10.10 and the mic doesnt work
2011-03-13T07:33:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	i kinda need it to skype
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	router	What happens when you try to use the mic?
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	nothing it doesnt record
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	router	"nothing" is rarely a proper explanation for "What happens". Does it record silence? Do you get an error message?
2011-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	router	Is your mic even listed as an available input device?
2011-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	yeah like when i record on sound recorder it says no data recorded
2011-03-13T07:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	router	What is the exact error message from sound recorder?
2011-03-13T07:36:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	hold on
2011-03-13T07:37:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	Stream contains no data
2011-03-13T07:41:00.000Z	router	Jordan_U	Stream contains no data
