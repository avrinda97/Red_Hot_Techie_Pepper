2008-01-15T03:21:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV		lokii: i have a 500GB HDD and a 320GB HDD
2008-01-15T03:22:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV		lokii: i don't know a lot about partitioning, how can u format a drive without partitioning everything?
2008-01-15T03:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	You dont format without a partition
2008-01-15T03:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	Yes, you can partition a drive before installing an os...
2008-01-15T03:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	You can also look into gparted livecd....
2008-01-15T03:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	Tons of partitioning info online
2008-01-29T08:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	DOnt know why anyone would name their program that
2008-01-29T08:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	No one can get anything about the program with a google.., you know what will show up
2008-01-29T08:01:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	Jack_Sparrow	do tell, on another note, do you know how to uninstall a program thats installed from a .py script?
2008-01-29T08:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	You would need to read the script.. just one more reason to use the repos, or make good backups
2008-01-29T08:02:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	Jack_Sparrow	not everything is in the repos
2008-01-29T08:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	Agreed, so use your backup...  :)
2008-01-29T08:03:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	Jack_Sparrow	uhh, how do you backup?
2008-01-29T08:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	One line tar statement in cli
2008-02-01T03:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	bugger of a card
2008-02-01T03:20:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	Jack_Sparrow	how so?
2008-02-01T03:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	If you look at the nvidia binary drivers page.. specifically excluded
2008-02-01T03:21:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	Jack_Sparrow	link?
2008-02-01T03:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	If your card does not appear in this [WWW] list of cards known by Ubuntu 7.04 NVIDIA binary drivers (e.g. the 8600GT) then there is no Ubuntu 7.04 supported binary driver.
2008-02-01T03:23:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	Jack_Sparrow	wow who would know to check that before building a system?
2008-02-01T03:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VvWolverinevV	I expect a good solution soon...
2008-02-01T03:24:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	Jack_Sparrow	that would be nice, thanks for the link
