2007-12-10T19:36:00.000Z	dinesh86		can i ?
2007-12-10T19:36:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	yes. what exactly do you want to do?
2007-12-10T19:37:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	not a grub problem
2007-12-10T19:37:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	partitions that aren't mounted is no grub problem
2007-12-10T19:40:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	that's NOT grub
2007-12-10T19:41:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	it should be already mounted. run simply "mount"
2007-12-10T19:42:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	fdisk -l
2007-12-10T19:44:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	what did fdisk -l say?
2007-12-10T19:46:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	dmesg output. paste it to a pastebin. all of it
2007-12-10T19:48:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	no. when there is nothing shown in fdisk -l, ubuntu doesn't recognize anything to mount
2007-12-10T19:49:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	then why would sudo fdisk -l ?
2007-12-10T19:49:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	but as dinesh86 said. mkdir /media/hda5
2007-12-10T20:12:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	man mount, what filesystem is on that partition?
2007-12-10T20:13:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	and what is the problem mounting it?
2007-12-10T20:13:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	pastebin your commandline
2007-12-10T20:15:00.000Z	wols_	dinesh86	duh. why would you mount swap?
