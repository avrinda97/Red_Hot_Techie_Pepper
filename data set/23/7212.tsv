2006-01-20T08:47:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	if you don't understand something on those pages just ask here and someone will help you out
2006-01-20T08:49:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	with what specifically
2006-01-20T08:50:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	ask here, more people can help you that way.  If you are talking to someone in particular just precede what you say with their name like I am doing
2006-01-20T08:51:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	in ubuntu you rarely need to install .tar's, use synaptic instead.  It is much easier.  ubuotu will send you a link
2006-01-20T08:55:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	in the future you have to use pastebin
2006-01-20T08:57:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	open a terminal (accessories -> terminal), type 'sudo apt-get update', enter your user password when it asks
2006-01-20T09:03:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	close synaptic and try again
2006-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	now open synaptic again
2006-01-20T09:05:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	there is not, but ubuntu prefers you use sudo
2006-01-20T09:06:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	you can read why
2006-01-20T09:09:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	click on the search button, enter 'xmms', search, right click on 'xmms' and click install, then apply up top
2006-01-20T09:12:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	if you left-click, you can read the description.  The one you want is just called 'xmms'
2006-01-20T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	once it finishes it will show up in your menu under 'sounds and video'
2006-01-20T09:15:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	you installed xmms with synaptic
2006-01-20T09:16:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	yes, from ubuntu's official repositories
2006-01-20T09:18:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	do you mean a partition that you mounted or a file somewhere on '/'?
2006-01-20T09:31:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	what is diskmounter?
2006-01-20T09:33:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	oh I see, the script.  I'm not sure about that.  Read the 'manual' method below.  It will inform you of options you have to pass to the 'mount' command in order to have all your users access it (umask=0222)
2006-01-20T09:34:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	yes
2006-01-20T09:36:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	filesystem
2006-01-20T09:38:00.000Z	_jason	sekhar	yes, do not do it.  It could mess up your files
