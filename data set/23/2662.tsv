2008-12-23T03:41:00.000Z	chipt4		situation: i have a directory with about 15 gzip files, with tar files inside.. is there a quick way to decompress them all without typing gzip -d [filename] then tar -xf [filename] for each file?
2008-12-23T03:42:00.000Z	benedek	chipt4	maybe tar xzf *.tar.gz ?
2008-12-23T03:44:00.000Z	benedek	chipt4	does that work?
2008-12-23T03:45:00.000Z	chipt4	benedek	no, it's saying Not found in archive
2008-12-23T03:45:00.000Z	chipt4	benedek	'tar: cck-5.x-1.x-dev.tar.gz: Not found in archive'
2008-12-23T03:45:00.000Z	benedek	chipt4	Ah, do  for i in *.tar.gz ; do tar xzf $i; done
2008-12-23T03:47:00.000Z	benedek	chipt4	What about now?
2008-12-23T03:47:00.000Z	chipt4	benedek	that worked!

2008-12-23T03:47:00.000Z	chipt4	benedek	what is that called? the use of for loops in the command line?
2008-12-23T03:48:00.000Z	chipt4		are those regular expressions?
2008-12-23T03:48:00.000Z	benedek	chipt4	Usage of the shell or 'bash'

2008-12-23T03:48:00.000Z	benedek	chipt4	Look for a guide on bash or Linux/Unix shell in the internet
2008-12-23T03:48:00.000Z	benedek		no problem
2008-12-23T03:48:00.000Z	benedek		man bash
