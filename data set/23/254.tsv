2012-07-08T11:49:00.000Z	L3top		do you remember what you set the ssid as? You should look at that link I gave you for step by step instructions.
2012-07-08T11:50:00.000Z	L3top		can you, in the phone, set that ssid rather than scan?
2012-07-08T11:51:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	nope
2012-07-08T11:31:00.000Z	L3top	sx_usr__	it depends on whether or not your wifi nic will allow you to do ad hoc ics really. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing/
2012-07-08T11:32:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	yeah, my ubuntu 12.04 has the ICS...
2012-07-08T11:32:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	but i tried setting it up, but my Samsung Galaxy S2 running CyanogenMod 9 latest nightly build does not see it....
2012-07-08T11:32:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	what am I missing here?
2012-07-08T11:33:00.000Z	L3top	sx_usr__	I have no idea. Either your ssid is not being broadcast, your nic does not allow adhoc due to limitations... or you didn't set it up right. What is your wifi nic?
2012-07-08T11:34:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	how to check?
2012-07-08T11:36:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	returns nothing
2012-07-08T11:36:00.000Z	L3top	sx_usr__	is this a usb wireless?
2012-07-08T11:36:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	nope, it's built-in to my laptop (HP EliteBook 8540w)
2012-07-08T11:38:00.000Z	L3top	sx_usr__	can you please pastebin the output of: lspci
2012-07-08T11:38:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	how do I pastebin?
2012-07-08T11:38:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	i have pastebin installed in my ubuntu 12.04...but how do I use it on the command line?
2012-07-08T11:42:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	did u see my pastebin i just sent to u?
2012-07-08T11:42:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1080801/
2012-07-08T11:45:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	okie dokie
2012-07-08T11:47:00.000Z	L3top	sx_usr__	I don't think you should have a problem with that nic... I wouldn't expect it anyway.
2012-07-08T11:47:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	that's weird....but my phone just can't discover the wifi
2012-07-08T11:48:00.000Z	L3top	sx_usr__	it means either your ssid is not broadcasting, or something went wrong during setup.
2012-07-08T11:48:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	ssid not broadcasting? how do I make it broadcast?
2012-07-08T11:49:00.000Z	sx_usr__	L3top	i set it to "Private-AP"
