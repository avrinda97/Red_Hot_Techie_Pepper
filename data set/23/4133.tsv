2007-10-31T14:55:00.000Z	effeietsanders		hello guys. I was having problems with getting the boot-disk to work, and someone pointed me to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto . That page tells me "Then use rawrite command: rawrite -f sbm.bin (rawwritewin.exe sbm.bin)" but to me it's a little unclear where exactly to enter that command -- > using Windows ME and trying to get a bootdisk of Ubuntu6.06LTS to work
2007-10-31T14:56:00.000Z	effeietsanders		(btw, cmd did not work here in the run, but command did, maybe usefull to add that to the guide)
2007-10-31T14:56:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	type the command in the command prompt
2007-10-31T14:58:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	s: the command is returned as invalid
2007-10-31T15:00:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	cd [directory where rawwritewin.exe is located] replace that
2007-10-31T15:01:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	then rerun that command
2007-10-31T15:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	did yoou type what i said literally or did you replace it by what i told you to replace it with
2007-10-31T15:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	dir
2007-10-31T15:05:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	although as rawwri~1.exe
2007-10-31T15:05:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	type that exactly then
2007-10-31T15:06:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	btw u should scrap ME its too old
2007-10-31T15:06:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	still doesn't work :S
2007-10-31T15:08:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	what i typed now in the correct folder is: rawrite -f sbm.bin (rawwri~1.exe sbm.bin)
2007-10-31T15:08:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	nope
2007-10-31T15:08:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	is there anything that might be wrong?
2007-10-31T15:08:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	remove the other linux command
2007-10-31T15:09:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	just say rawwri~1.exe sbm.bin
2007-10-31T15:10:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	that is doing something :)
2007-10-31T15:11:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	looks like the guide needs a clarification
2007-10-31T15:11:00.000Z	kbrooks	effeietsanders	btw u should scrap ME its too old
2007-10-31T15:11:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	it certainly does :)
2007-10-31T15:12:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	note that the cmd in >run> did not even work here, i had to use command
2007-10-31T16:06:00.000Z	effeietsanders	kbrooks	wtf, it just works!
