2009-07-05T21:50:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	Moult is on Jaunty with no support in the kernel for his attansic nic.. we're trying to figure out how to get it and install it.. but having problems locating it.
2009-07-05T21:51:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	the support might be in the updates but alas .. you can't update without an internet connection.. and aptoncd would be useless in this case.
2009-07-05T21:52:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	it is in the karmac kernel but he shouldn't go there.
2009-07-05T21:52:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	actually modprobe would work if the driver was avaible.. at least according to what I've read so far.
2009-07-05T21:52:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	but he certainly cant try to patch jaunty kernel tree with module from karmic
2009-07-05T21:53:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	can't or can ?
2009-07-05T21:53:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	that's beyond my abilities.. I'm not sure if he wants to go there ..but if you know how and he's willing.. go for it.
2009-07-05T21:58:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	it's been around for some time.. launchpad is riddled with bug reports
2009-07-05T21:58:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	probably since 6.10
2009-07-05T22:06:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	not taken off but bug against it since then
2009-07-05T22:39:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	unless his system is still using hdaX type references.
2009-07-29T22:18:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	192.168.0.x is the subnet
2009-07-29T22:19:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	you can NOT have two machines on same LAN with identical adresses.
2009-07-29T22:19:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	I should say subnet mask
2009-07-29T22:20:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	though its ok when person A has it in his home and person B has same in her home
2009-07-29T22:20:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	lstarnes I guess I'm asking why you'd want some machines on a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and others on 255.255.0.0
2009-07-29T22:21:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	255.255.255.0 is _within_ 255.255.0.0 scope
2009-07-29T22:22:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	so no, you cannot have two machines adressed 192.168.0.100 on same LAN
2009-07-29T22:24:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	yes. But you should better stay with 255.255.255.0 as most examples of networking setup uses network C (/24 in CDIR notation)
2009-07-29T22:25:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	if you want to "separate" networks on same LAN you use 192.168.0/24 192.168.1/24
2009-07-29T22:27:00.000Z	ohir	scunizi	you also need to set up broadcast address if you change the mask. If you can not figure voip appliance setup, you may resort to change mask within your home network accordingly.
2009-07-29T22:30:00.000Z	scunizi	ohir	the device has it's own gateway address that defaults at 192.168.1.*
