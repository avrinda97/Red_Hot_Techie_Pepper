2006-02-22T08:55:00.000Z	bassinboy		anyone know webmin? can't login, I have edited the users file and everything
2006-02-22T08:56:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	do you use the sudo in your ubuntu?
2006-02-22T08:56:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	yes
2006-02-22T08:56:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	it needs the root password, i think
2006-02-22T08:58:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	man, I can't get it to login at all
2006-02-22T08:59:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	does it ask the password
2006-02-22T09:00:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	on webmin? yes
2006-02-22T09:05:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	Arg, stupid ubuntu, :P
2006-02-22T09:20:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	did the root password help?
2006-02-22T09:20:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	hm? I got it now, Doh, I can't install modules, the webmin version is to old
2006-02-22T09:21:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	you can update the webmin with webmin
2006-02-22T09:21:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	and get all modules from webmin too
2006-02-22T09:22:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	is there anyway to apt-get install webmin-*
2006-02-22T09:22:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	yes it should be... try apt-cache search webmin
2006-02-22T09:24:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	in what format is the webin module name?
2006-02-22T09:24:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	im in gentoo so cant use the apt to look
2006-02-22T09:25:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	Lucky, I use gentoo too, but this guy wants me to setup his server, and he has ubuntu lol
2006-02-22T09:25:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	you could try apt-get install webmin*
2006-02-22T09:25:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	when I try to update it, it says it needs module proc ( the one that kills processes) and when I try to install proc, webmin is to old for it lol
2006-02-22T09:26:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	try apt-get update && upgrade
2006-02-22T09:28:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	Ok, got It, I needed webmin-core
2006-02-22T09:30:00.000Z	bassinboy	ufo	this guy actually asked me if something was on gentoo, and I told him gentoo has the largest collection of software known by man availible to it in a single command :P
2006-02-22T09:32:00.000Z	ufo	bassinboy	this is my first time in gentoo and so far it looks nice but its slow to update things and install new software... the debian is good in server, if you dont need the desktop and things like that
