2004-09-11T15:39:00.000Z	hypatia		spiv said "they're awesome, you realise the magic for the X config is insane?"
2004-09-11T15:39:00.000Z	hypatia		but he thinks I'm OK because it has a normal aspect ratio
2004-09-11T15:40:00.000Z	hypatia		The nuttiness with finding a US vendor has caused me to lower my standards.
2004-09-11T15:40:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	i was going to recommend the dell x300 to you
2004-09-11T15:40:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	thanks for the thought anyway.
2004-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	Next time I will be around for wider soundings :)
2004-09-11T15:46:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	where was that place that james got his?
2004-09-11T15:47:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	Red's Notebook World on wattle street.
2004-09-11T15:47:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	They don't have an onli9ne catalogue.
2004-09-17T16:29:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	It would make for excellent pre-release artwork.
2004-09-17T16:29:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	Someone would do an icon theme, no worries.
2004-09-17T05:13:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	i use screen in g-t
2004-09-17T05:14:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	there is known weirdness between screen and vte, but i haven't seen that
2004-09-17T05:14:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	I've been getting it consistently for about a year.
2004-09-17T05:15:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	Within 15 minutes of spiv letting me use his laptop  it started happening to him too...
2004-09-17T05:23:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	irssi also has this talented bug that makes the whole screen go blue
2004-09-17T05:26:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	You can look it up on swift's site can't you?
2004-09-27T15:29:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	no
2004-09-29T16:20:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	ideally, no
2004-09-29T16:20:00.000Z	hypatia	jdub	bug worthy?
2004-09-29T16:21:00.000Z	jdub	hypatia	yeah, i'd say so
