2007-06-08T06:33:00.000Z	TaJMoX	wepeel	: is your desktop an ubuntu machine ?
2007-06-08T06:33:00.000Z	wepeel	TaJMoX	both machines are
2007-06-08T06:36:00.000Z	TaJMoX	wepeel	this looked good : http://occy.net/printing
2007-06-08T06:36:00.000Z	wepeel	TaJMoX	my printer is not a networking printer. But shouldn't I be able to acces it somehow? My desktop is always running btw, it's configured as a web server
2007-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	wepeel	TaJMoX	Ah, I think one issue I might have is that I don't have a LAN set up :(
2007-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	wepeel	TaJMoX	That should be pretty staightforward in Linux, yes?
2007-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	TaJMoX	wepeel	if your computers are connected to a router - that is a LAN
2007-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	TaJMoX	wepeel	- computer one could be 192.168.1.100 computer two 192.168.1.101   etc etc
2007-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	wepeel	TaJMoX	Ok, forgive me. last time I networked computers was in wondows , where one had to set up the windows networking stuff, etc
2007-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	TaJMoX	wepeel	i haven't done printer sharing in linux - but i assume there are good guides out there
