2009-07-19T16:05:00.000Z	Webu		Is there stronger command than "kill -9" available?
2009-07-19T16:06:00.000Z	Webu		I've got a process running at 100% CPU and it won't die :-(
2009-07-19T16:07:00.000Z	nyaa	Webu	what kind of process is it?  is in it a terminal?
2009-07-19T16:07:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	it's a "sudo rmmod bttv" but it got stuck :-(
2009-07-19T16:07:00.000Z	nyaa		webu tried ctrl + c, or ctrl + z?
2009-07-19T16:07:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	"root      4968  100  0.0   1788   464 ?        R<   14:00   6:49 rmmod bttv"
2009-07-19T16:08:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	at least Ctrl + C didn't work, didn't try that Z before closing the window :-S
2009-07-19T16:09:00.000Z	Webu		Ah, I think I've got to reboot to get that process killed..
2009-07-19T16:11:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	lol it won't reboot :-D I'm feeling like Windows now :-P
2009-07-19T16:11:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	*goes to the power switch*
2009-07-19T16:11:00.000Z	nyaa		webu won't reboot?
2009-07-19T16:12:00.000Z	nyaa		webu I should look up what that process does heh
2009-07-19T16:12:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	yeah, looks like it was quite bad at 100% CPU usage - somehow it didn't want to work when trying to rmmod that "bttv" module.
2009-07-19T16:13:00.000Z	nyaa		any idea what bttv is?  is that for a tv card?
2009-07-19T16:13:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	yes it is, trying to get my Hercules Smart TV working.
2009-07-19T16:13:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	was about to unload the module to reload it with different settings.
2009-07-19T16:14:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	now after a reboot the unload works, at least the first time :-O
2009-07-19T16:14:00.000Z	nyaa	Webu	I've got no solid advice for tv cards, I failed in that area =)  The only time I've seen a cpu go to 100% was when it had a hard time trying to poll for a keypress or something similar
2009-07-19T16:15:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	hehe I see, maybe it's just a bit buggy and gets quite bad when stuck :-S
2009-07-19T16:16:00.000Z	nyaa		webu could be, I know a few people that use linux, but I don't know anyone thats gotten a tv card to work well =(
2009-07-19T16:18:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	ahh hehe, it got stuck again trying the second time :-D I see.. :-P
2009-07-19T16:19:00.000Z	nyaa	Webu	I'd probably see what exactly it does when it freezes up, but that ones over my head =
2009-07-19T16:19:00.000Z	Webu	nyaa	oh yeah - thank you for your time though :-) <3
