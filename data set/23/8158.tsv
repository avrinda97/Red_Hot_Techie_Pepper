2005-01-07T08:21:00.000Z	BlacKnight|		or ide-scsi emulation?
2005-01-07T08:22:00.000Z	BlacKnight|		and if so, how do i enable it in grub?
2005-01-07T08:23:00.000Z	BlacKnight|		because k3b isn't recognising my burner as a burner...
2005-01-07T08:23:00.000Z	BlacKnight|		it thinks it's just a reader

2005-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	BlacKnight|	bob2	so how the hell do i set it up?
2005-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	? your cd burner is /dev/hdc, right?
2005-01-07T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	k3b doesn't let you specify the device/
2005-01-07T08:27:00.000Z	BlacKnight|	bob2	i know, it's giving me the shits..
2005-01-07T08:55:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	how would compiling it from source help?
2005-01-07T08:56:00.000Z	BlacKnight|	bob2	what i DID want to do was build an uninstallable .deb package
2005-01-07T12:43:00.000Z	BlacKnight|	bob2	when's hoary coming out?
2005-01-07T12:43:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	april 15th or so
2005-01-07T12:48:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	no
2005-01-07T13:15:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	you keep your own stuff in /usr/local/, and then ubuntu ignores it completely
2005-01-14T08:11:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	it is really really really unlikely that grub has had any effect on windows at all
2005-01-14T16:37:00.000Z	bob2	BlacKnight|	why are you installin lilo?
