2011-01-12T09:27:00.000Z	leenux		hi, can i ask for opinions of ubuntu and kubuntu here?
2011-01-12T09:29:00.000Z	leenux		i'm more used to running kde but i am okay to install gnome .... just wondered if anyone compared the two
2011-01-12T09:31:00.000Z	leenux		i think there's some good alternatives but i like k3b
2011-01-12T09:31:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	you can use those apps in GNOME, but they won't be as pretty ;-)
2011-01-12T09:32:00.000Z	leenux	yeats	 oh :)
2011-01-12T09:33:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	it's easy to run both side-by-side (though you might need to clean up your app menus)
2011-01-12T09:35:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	if you install kubuntu-desktop, it will bring in all the KDE apps and put them in your GNOME menus - it's a matter of preference, but I like to keep the KDE apps out of my GNOME menus - that's all I meant ;-)
2011-01-12T09:35:00.000Z	leenux	yeats	oh... yes, that makes sense
2011-01-12T09:37:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	it would not be a good test of your GPU, no
2011-01-12T09:37:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	*but* it would let you see KDE up close ;-)
2011-01-12T09:39:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	have you used virtualbox before?
2011-01-12T09:39:00.000Z	leenux	yeats	no, i haven't.....why?
2011-01-12T09:40:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	just wondering from your question...  virtualbox will allow you to install any OS you want - it just gives you a "fake" computer to run on - you're not tied to a version
2011-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	leenux	yeats	last time i looked at their homepage... you can select an os for your host
2011-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	virtualbox will run on any OS
2011-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	oh - I understand now
2011-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	yes - use Ubuntu
2011-01-12T09:42:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	sorry :-)
2011-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	right
2011-01-12T09:48:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	with 4 GB, you could push that up to 1GB for your guest without issues - probably even 2GB
2011-01-12T09:49:00.000Z	leenux	yeats	right... but, i think i read it's hard to change the amount or at least, hard to raise it
2011-01-12T09:49:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	nah - not hard, you can slide it up without a problem
2011-01-12T09:49:00.000Z	yeats	leenux	I'd start with 1GB
