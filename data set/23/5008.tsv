2007-04-01T09:44:00.000Z	thinman1189		hello. I'm using ubuntu dapper drake. I'm having some trouble with gaim. I accidentally messed up all of the icons while trying to install a theme. I tried re-installing, not sure if I did it right, and it didn't fix the problem. I either need to get my gaim icons back or to upgrade to the newest version.

I tried re-installing, not sure if I did it right, and it didn't fix the problem. I either need to get my gaim icons back or to upgrade to the newest version. how would I reinstall the icons for gaim or where is the installer for 2.0.0beta6?
2007-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	I can only find gaim beta 6 in edgy repositories
2007-04-01T09:52:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	how can I re-install gaim 2.0.0beta3?
2007-04-01T09:53:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	what is the problem with it?
2007-04-01T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	was this theme installed as root or not
2007-04-01T09:56:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	I'm not sure, I'm new to linux. I have the link to the theme, am I allowed to post links in here?
2007-04-01T09:57:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	yeah you are, just try sudo apt-get remove --purge gaim and then sudo apt-get install gaim
2007-04-01T09:58:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	will that destroy account data like chat logs and my accounts?
2007-04-01T09:59:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	could, you can back them up with mv ~/.gaim ~/.gaim.backup
2007-04-01T10:00:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	am I allowed to post code in here? Perhaps if I show you what I did it would prevent having to re-install.
2007-04-01T10:01:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	you can post it so long as it isn't really long
2007-04-01T10:01:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	  sudo mv /usr/share/pixmaps/gaim /usr/share/pixmaps/gaim_backup
2007-04-01T10:02:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	you did that?
2007-04-01T10:02:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	ok sudo mv -f /usr/share/pixmaps/gaim_backup /usr/share/pixmaps/gaim
2007-04-01T10:02:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	that should fix it
2007-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	thanks again for the help. another question if you don't mind. I'm having trouble with java. for some reason it takes up a massive amount of my cpu but not when I'm on my windows hard drive.
2007-04-01T10:13:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	massive amount of resources is what java is all about
2007-04-01T10:13:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	on windows, the java applet in question, only takes up 40% of my cpu. On ubuntu it takes up 100% and still barely functions.
2007-04-01T10:14:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	don't know
2007-04-01T10:15:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	could it be that I have the wrong java? I have sun java 5.0 runtime with firefox plugin.
2007-04-01T10:15:00.000Z	bruenig	thinman1189	java 6 is out but I doubt it is going to have too much of a boost
2007-04-01T10:16:00.000Z	thinman1189	bruenig	thanks anyway.
