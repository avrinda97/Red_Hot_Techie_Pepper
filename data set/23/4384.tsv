2009-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	Vovk	Angie	you MAY need to recompile alsa drivers... last time i had to do that on my laptop was a year ago tho. lemme look up the wiki

2009-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	Vovk	Angie	aah... it was working before?
2009-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	Angie	Vovk	uh, yeah ...
2009-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	Vovk	Angie	are your speakers plugged in? :) does it work with headphones? etc
2009-09-04T07:12:00.000Z	Vovk	Angie	did the sound suddenly fade to nothing within a few (10-15) seconds?
2009-09-04T07:13:00.000Z	Angie	Vovk	what do you think
2009-09-04T07:14:00.000Z	Vovk	Angie	"i think" that i had a problem with that a few months ago where the sound would randomly fade out if you plugged in headphones
2009-09-04T07:15:00.000Z	Vovk	Angie	i know that. I'm saying that my issue was that when you plugged headphones in, everything faded to nothingness, and no sound came out of anything at all
2009-09-04T07:16:00.000Z	Angie	Vovk	what do I do?
2009-09-04T07:16:00.000Z	Vovk	Angie	I just want to know. if there are no headphones in the computer, and it reboots, is the sound still broken?
2009-09-04T07:16:00.000Z	Angie	Vovk	yes
