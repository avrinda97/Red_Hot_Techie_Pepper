2008-04-03T16:26:00.000Z	adrock358		hello all.  ahve a question for you.  just rendered my os (vista) unusable.  I enlarged the partition, then could't boot from it.  i've tried everything.  and my question is, if i install vista on another partition (install it again), will I be able to browse my primary partition from there, transfer my data to my new vista os, and save the day?
2008-04-03T16:27:00.000Z	adrock358		the reason why i am in this forum is because I am also an ubuntu user.  I use a dual boot, but had to erase the ubuntu partition too, because i've messed up my system.  so now i want to recover data, and reinstall.

2008-04-03T16:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	that link I provided should do that
2008-04-03T16:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	a live cd is what it is
2008-04-03T16:40:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	Using  sudo fdisk -l  , find the NTFS device name, then mount it (e.g.    mkdir /mnt/vista && mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/vista  )
2008-04-03T16:40:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	try that if you haven't first^
2008-04-03T16:41:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	I wouldn't try repartitioning until you have a backup
2008-04-03T16:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	possibly
2008-04-03T16:44:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	if you want to pastebin the  sudo fdisk -l  results, it may help
2008-04-03T16:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	pastebin the output of  sudo fdisk -l  please?
2008-04-03T16:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	fair enough
2008-04-03T16:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	np
2008-04-03T16:48:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	I gave those instructions :)
2008-04-03T16:49:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	np
2008-04-03T16:53:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	ohh, I get the same, sorry
2008-04-03T17:07:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	yup
2008-04-03T17:08:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	try    sudo mkdir /mnt/vistamnt    then    sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/vistamnt    (change /dev/sda1 to your vista/ntfs device name, you can use something else in place of vistamnt too if you like)
2008-04-03T17:12:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	getting there. the last command you tried will need a sudo infront also, but as the error states, it may be dangerous
2008-04-03T17:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	was about to say it's probably your only option :)
2008-04-03T17:25:00.000Z	DistroJockey	adrock358	you happily backing up now?
