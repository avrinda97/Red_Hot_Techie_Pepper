2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		this is a misconception
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		new stuff != faster
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		at all
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		it never was and never will
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		if it is faster you are lucky
2004-12-05T15:00:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	Thats right because newer algos, and better optimization don't exist
2004-12-05T15:01:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	eh?
2004-12-06T11:46:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	chill down
2004-12-06T11:47:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	there is a package that needs an update and daniel is working on it
2004-12-06T11:47:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	So are we talking within the hour update, or should i roll back? =D
2004-12-11T13:52:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	no that is wrong
2004-12-11T13:55:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	daniles
2004-12-17T15:57:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	They are talking about the image not tree.
2004-12-17T16:00:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	How come linux-image and not kernel-image
2004-12-17T16:05:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	sladen
2004-12-17T16:05:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	sladen: no
2004-12-17T16:06:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	I know that...
2004-12-17T16:07:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	Right that applies to the fact that the same images are under both linux-image and kernel-image, and i assumed that was intended, and was wondering if they where making that a convention
2004-12-17T16:08:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	I could see a case being made to rename kernel-image to linux-image
2004-12-17T16:09:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	i didn't know that, im seeing both right now -- so i take it linux-image will remain the naming convention for ubuntu?
2004-12-17T16:10:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	How come im seeing the debian packages then when there is already a ubuntu counterpart?
2004-12-17T16:10:00.000Z	fabbione	melazyboy	because we don't kill debian...
2004-12-17T16:11:00.000Z	melazyboy	fabbione	hrm, is the universe a mirror of debian woody?
