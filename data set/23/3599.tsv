2010-04-01T04:47:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	it's under python-xlwt
2010-04-01T04:48:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	thanks
2010-04-01T04:50:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	I'm on version 9.04, what release are you on. python-xlwt is not on my system.

2010-04-01T04:53:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	thanks for the pointer.
2010-04-01T04:58:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	you can open excel stuff with openoffice calc and export to a more sane format like csv
2010-04-01T05:02:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	I thought about doing it that way, but it would add another step to the process and I don't want to add more procedure to the process.
2010-04-01T05:05:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	does that forum thread let you do what you want to?
2010-04-01T05:08:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	no, I like to know why xlrd is in synaptic, but xlwt is not.
2010-04-01T05:09:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	it was in older versions of ubuntu. you could try grabbing that debsrc and building it, or if you really want to know you could open a bug requesting packaging of it or try contacting the previous maintainer
2010-04-01T05:09:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python-xlwt
2010-04-01T05:10:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	looks like it's in karmic and lucid to me
2010-04-01T05:10:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	 do you thing I could use the one in karmic or licid?
2010-04-01T05:12:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	i would actually recommend installing from the tar.gz on its homepage: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt
2010-04-01T05:13:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	 ok, thanks
2010-04-01T05:13:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	will what you're making only be used on your system?
2010-04-01T05:13:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	 No
2010-04-01T05:15:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	 I plan on make web page from the data in the spread sheet.
2010-04-01T05:15:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	will the python script you are making now only be run on your 9.04 jaunty ubuntu system?
2010-04-01T05:17:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	 I plan on testing it on my system, but the page will be on a Microsoft machine.
2010-04-01T05:19:00.000Z	chelz	tiredbones	i just mean the actual python, not the stuff/pages it generates. but alright
2010-04-01T05:22:00.000Z	tiredbones	chelz	 thanks for your help. I'm going to think about it some more.
