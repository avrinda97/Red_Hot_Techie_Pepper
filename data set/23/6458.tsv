2006-05-02T10:24:00.000Z	orbin	mustard5	there's actually an alternative method to the numbering: savedefault
2006-05-02T10:25:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	yeah, sometimes people have savedefault on multiple menu entries though..(not in this case though)
2006-05-02T10:25:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	he only had savedefault on the windows line
2006-05-02T10:26:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	if he had it on the first breezy entry as well then it would savedefault on breezy next time he used breezy
2006-05-02T10:26:00.000Z	orbin	mustard5	yeah, i'm not sure how it works actually, i just thought i knew that there was an alternative
2006-05-02T10:26:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	he doesnt though, so yeah, your method would have worked :)
2006-05-02T10:27:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	the problem I think with his menu.lst is he has an entry which acts as a title before the windows option, so I think I may have needed to add one to my final count :)
2006-05-02T10:59:00.000Z	orbin	mustard5	heard of that drum loop thing.  it's in the forum somewhere
2006-05-02T11:00:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	k..I'll have a look around. :)
2006-05-02T11:07:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	well I found my thread on the same issue. :)  Hehehe..haven't found any others yet..still looking
2006-05-02T11:09:00.000Z	orbin	mustard5	let me try.  i'm sure i've heard the prob before
2006-05-02T11:10:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	thanks I'm posting my workaround in a few threads that I have found, and still searching for more.
2006-05-02T11:18:00.000Z	orbin	mustard5	gee, i can't really find anything (i saw your post)
2006-05-02T11:19:00.000Z	orbin	mustard5	have you tried "disabling the sound sever on startup" method?
2006-05-02T11:19:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	thanks for looking..I'm making progress (a bit)...I wanted to avoid that, as I only just recently got it all to work (the sound server and stuff)
2006-05-02T11:20:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	I'm pretty certain its a sound card driver issue in combination with an IRQ allocation problem
2006-05-02T11:20:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	I can fix it with irqpoll as a kernel option from grub, but that is creating other problems atm
2006-05-02T11:21:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	so I'm looking for a definitive solution that fixes all atm :)
2006-05-02T11:22:00.000Z	orbin	mustard5	get a hold of crimsun when he becomes active.  he's fixed a lot of sound issues for people in here
2006-05-02T11:22:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	I can't say for sure what combinations of settings I have used which give me the greatest success.  It's been a case of moving the sound card around in PCI slots and finding out which ones seem to work together
2006-05-02T11:23:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	yeah...I think I need to get a better handle on all the details of the problem first beforehand though.  I started getting lockups on my nvidia splashscreen at some stage
2006-05-02T11:29:00.000Z	mustard5	orbin	yeah..nothing in ubotu atm...I'm doing google and forum searches atm :)
