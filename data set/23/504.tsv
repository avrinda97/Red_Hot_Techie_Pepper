2011-07-15T21:01:00.000Z	linuxnoob5		how do i gauge my acctual memory usage in linux? top says i only have 20MB free but it does not feel like it at all
2011-07-15T21:02:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	it is a difference between allocated RAM and used RAM
2011-07-15T21:02:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	so top/free is reporting allocated?

2011-07-15T21:09:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	your mem is just cached into disk sectors. try using -m too see the values in Megabytes. Check with the gui system monitor, which doesn't display the cache as used
2011-07-15T21:10:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	Actualy memory is not used by application, but it is used for disk caching
2011-07-15T21:11:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	sorry i dont understand.
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	theres FTP running so is it caching the loaded files? or?
2011-07-15T21:14:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	well, that is possible. No worries about the ram. Your post shows  2035152 free
2011-07-15T21:14:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	and 2097080 swapped
2011-07-15T21:15:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	used by applications: 39916
2011-07-15T21:16:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	it's just the way the kernel works with memory, so it's not lying there inefficient
2011-07-15T21:18:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	2097xxx.. swapped? says im not using any swap..sorry just confused
2011-07-15T21:19:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	that is the ammount of RAM cached into disk sectors, but the number you need to look at is 39916 it is the ammount used by your applications!
2011-07-15T21:21:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	so it uses unused ram to cache files for faster loading? or?
2011-07-15T21:21:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	yes
2011-07-15T21:21:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	ah :P
2011-07-15T21:22:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	so -/+ buffers/cache is my line to watch :) thanks :)
2011-07-15T21:22:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	absolutely
2011-07-15T21:23:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	/me feels stupid
2011-07-15T21:23:00.000Z	Baltazaar	linuxnoob5	no problem :)
2011-07-15T21:23:00.000Z	linuxnoob5	Baltazaar	thanks :)
