2010-08-06T05:53:00.000Z	basix-		hmm also is there a good graphical ftp server client for ubuntu in the software center?
2010-08-06T05:54:00.000Z	basix-		i don't get any search results for fireftp..
2010-08-06T05:55:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	its a firefox addon, a ftp client in the browser. you where looking for a ftp server or client?
2010-08-06T05:55:00.000Z	basix-		server*
2010-08-06T05:56:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	gadmin-proftpd
2010-08-06T05:56:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	its a graphical frontend to the ftp server proftpd
2010-08-06T05:56:00.000Z	basix-		thanks c3l
2010-08-06T05:57:00.000Z	basix-	c3l	i will need to install proftpd as well to work with it?
2010-08-06T05:58:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	I checked that, proftpd is a dependency for the frontend, so it will get installed automatically,everything needed for it to work will get installed when you install gadmin-proftpd =)
2010-08-06T06:00:00.000Z	basix-	c3l	ok..but now when i install it if it doesn't show up in my 'Applications' where else would I look for it?
2010-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	hm thats strange. can  you run gadmin-proftpd or similar cfrom the terminal?
2010-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	basix-		i'm sorry
2010-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	basix-	c3l	i found it in the menu
2010-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	basix-		under System Tools
2010-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	good =)
2010-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	basix-	c3l	thank you for your help :)
2010-08-06T06:02:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	im just glad to help, and remember ftp is never safe. if you want to share files securely use sftp (ssh)
2010-08-06T06:03:00.000Z	basix-	c3l	ok, it's just to learn how to set up a server on linux i don't plan on doing much sharing just experimenting
2010-08-06T06:06:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	ah thats nice, but look in to ssh too, its the standar for connecting to other linux (and unix) machines and also sending files
2010-08-06T06:07:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	that is, if you already dont know about it, I dont know how new you are =)
2010-08-06T06:09:00.000Z	c3l		I have a bunch of directories where I want a set of users to be able to read, and another set of users that are able to read and write. so I basically need two groups for one directory, is that possible?
2010-08-06T06:11:00.000Z	basix-	c3l	i know ssh but never heard of sftp ;)
2010-08-06T06:11:00.000Z	c3l	basix-	basically the same thing, sftp is ssh file transfer protocol. the cli tool is called scp =)
