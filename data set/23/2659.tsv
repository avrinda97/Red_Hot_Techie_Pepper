2008-12-27T16:30:00.000Z	hashbrowns		gateway just reports as "*"
2008-12-27T16:30:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	paste the result of that command in pastebin
2008-12-27T16:30:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	how can I do that?
2008-12-27T16:29:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	type "route" in a console to see if your gateway is correctly setup
2008-12-27T16:30:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	except for one destination entry: default   gateway:  192.168.0.1
2008-12-27T16:31:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	i will suppose that 192.168.0.1 is your modem router...
2008-12-27T16:31:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	yes
2008-12-27T16:32:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	try "tail /etc/resolv.conf" to see if your router is also set as your nameserver
2008-12-27T16:33:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	does your machine get an ip address from the router?
2008-12-27T16:34:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	no, there are three nameserver entries: 68.87.68.162, 68.87.74.162, 68.87.64.196
2008-12-27T16:34:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	yes it does acquire an IP address
2008-12-27T16:35:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	maybe doing a "echo nameserver 192.168.0.1 >> /etc/resolv.conf " will fix your issue there
2008-12-27T16:36:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	i did that and I got permission denied.  do i need to do that as root?
2008-12-27T16:36:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	yes
2008-12-27T16:37:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	no that didnt work
2008-12-27T16:39:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	can you ping the router from that machine
2008-12-27T16:39:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	yes
2008-12-27T16:40:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	stands to reason that your issue is dns based. try restarting your network on that machine to activate the changes
2008-12-27T16:41:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	do you mean restart the computer or reset my router and stuff?
2008-12-27T16:41:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	not the router, just the unresponsive machine
2008-12-27T16:45:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	restart didnt work
2008-12-27T16:48:00.000Z	hashbrowns	bidossessi	well at the top of my resolv.conf file # generate by NetworkManager
2008-12-27T16:55:00.000Z	bidossessi	hashbrowns	you might want to reconfigure the network connection, using the tool provided by ubuntu then. i think setting everything to roaming is a pretty safe allrounder, unless you have specific setups that require something else
