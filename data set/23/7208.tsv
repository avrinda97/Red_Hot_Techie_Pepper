2010-02-20T07:42:00.000Z	todd_		i installed a theme package that came with 6 tar.gz files, i exracted them. each file i am guessing contains a different component of the theme. so from there i went to system>preferences>appearance>themes>install. 1 of the 6 tar.gz files installed. the other files which contain emblems and what will not install. is there another route that i can take to add the themes to my system? am i doing something wrong?
2010-02-20T07:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	when you use the theme manager to install themes, they are usually placed in ~/.themes (for themes) or ~/.icons (for icons)
2010-02-20T07:45:00.000Z	todd_	ardchoille	oh i see, so what do i need to do differently?
2010-02-20T07:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	try unpacking the theme components and placing them in the proper folder: ~/.themes or ~/.icons
2010-02-20T07:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	which theme was it? if you can get me a link to download it I can look at it and tell you more

2010-02-20T07:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	hold on.. waiting for the download link
2010-02-20T07:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	17mb? sounds like it has an icon theme too
2010-02-20T07:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	I'll unpack it and see what I can find, will be back with you shortly
2010-02-20T07:50:00.000Z	todd_	ardchoille	thank you!
2010-02-20T07:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	which version of ubuntu are you running?
2010-02-20T07:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	ok, you'll need to unpack the initial package, go into the resulting folder and drag each of the packages there into the theme manager. Try that
2010-02-20T07:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	right click the initial package and choose "extract here"
2010-02-20T07:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	being that you're on 9.10, you won't be able to use the gdm theme as the gdm in 9.10 is not yet feature complete
2010-02-20T07:56:00.000Z	todd_	ardchoille	ok i have unpacked all 6 of the files. now the theme manager? is that the theme window under appearances?
2010-02-20T07:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	no, just unpack the initial downloaded package, which it sounds like you already did, then go into the Windows7 folder and drag each of the desired packages into the theme manager. Don't bother with the win7.emerald and gdm packages
2010-02-20T08:01:00.000Z	todd_	ardchoille	how do i get to theme manager?
2010-02-20T08:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	System > Preferences > Appearance
2010-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	you should be able to yes
2010-02-20T08:04:00.000Z	todd_	ardchoille	only 1 out of the 6 files will actually drag and drop. the other files say "does not appear to be a valid theme"
2010-02-20T08:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	which one worked?
2010-02-20T08:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	we should continue this in PM. May I pm you?
2010-02-20T08:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	todd_	see my PM
