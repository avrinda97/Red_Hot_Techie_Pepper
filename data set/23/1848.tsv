2011-05-07T09:42:00.000Z	DIFTOW		hi there
2011-05-07T09:43:00.000Z	DIFTOW		Just installed Nvidia drivers the manual way. Terminal #3, booted from grub with 'text' command. My performance in 3D games is still terrible, infact worse.
2011-05-07T09:44:00.000Z	DIFTOW		Software rendering works fine. OpenGL is a disaster. Please help.
2011-05-07T09:44:00.000Z	DIFTOW		Correct
2011-05-07T09:45:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	that means you not using nvidia drivers
2011-05-07T09:46:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	what board are you using?
2011-05-07T09:46:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	it might be too new
2011-05-07T09:47:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	did you install both the kernel module and the xorg driver?
2011-05-07T09:52:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	did you install both the kernel module and the xorg driver?
2011-05-07T09:53:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-05-07T09:55:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	put the log in a pastebin
2011-05-07T09:56:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	did you make an xorg.conf... well of course you did you installed by hand so paste bin it too
2011-05-07T10:01:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	it looks like your trying to enable a d monitor but your monitor doesnt support it
2011-05-07T10:01:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	it looks like your trying to enable a 3D monitor but your monitor doesnt support it
2011-05-07T10:02:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	you xorg.con is
2011-05-07T10:03:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	the lag is easilly explained be having no hardware acceleration because your trying to do somthing thats not supported and the error is causing it to fall back to defaults
2011-05-07T10:04:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	write your own xorg.conf, make it fine tuned to what your doing
2011-05-07T10:05:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	didnt the tell you that xorg is going to be using the nvidia module on the nvidia site?
2011-05-07T10:06:00.000Z	DIFTOW	pfifo	idk what you just said.
2011-05-07T10:08:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	/etc/X11/xorg.conf (this file dosent exist, you have to create it)
2011-05-07T10:10:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	what was the las package you updated?
2011-05-07T10:12:00.000Z	pfifo	DIFTOW	you chip is too new
