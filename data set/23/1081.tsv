2010-09-12T02:41:00.000Z	bjaanes		I start a "$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb" As i have understood, dd copies bit for bit (or something?). Does that mean that it copies all bits (indexed or not) to the other drive. Mind, these are two disks with 1TB each and its taking forever (many hours thus far). The reason I am asking is because used disk space is more like 86GB, and I wouldn't understand the need for so long copy-time, but if it copies 1TB (with indexed and un-indexed
2010-09-12T02:41:00.000Z	bjaanes		 shit) it could take some time.
2010-09-12T02:41:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	that's really not the best solution, that
2010-09-12T02:41:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	it's even a poor solution if you ask me
2010-09-12T02:42:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	Why? Its not for backup or copy, its because of some LVM thingy. Following some tut.
2010-09-12T02:43:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	you have LVM on the thing? So why not create partitions on the new disk and tar c|tar x?
2010-09-12T02:44:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	I don't have LVM - yet. But its the plan :P My backuppc need some more space ^ ^
2010-09-12T02:44:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	well, create a PV on your new disk - and what do you plan to do exactly?
2010-09-12T02:45:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	I have not come that far into the guide yet. I am basicly just asking if it copies 1TB over, or the 86GB of used space (indexed)
2010-09-12T02:46:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	it doesn't tell me what you want to do exactly
2010-09-12T02:47:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	Does it matter? I just want to know how dd works (parts, because I'm doing it right now, and parts because I wanna know for some other time).
2010-09-12T02:49:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	dd dumps data from an input to an output on bloc boundaries
2010-09-12T02:50:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	the thing is, with newer disk about to come, using dd to copy data over is a very, very bad idea
2010-09-12T02:51:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	Are you talking about SSD? I could understand how dd wouldnt be good for them if dd work the way I think.
2010-09-12T02:51:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	no, not only SSDs
2010-09-12T02:52:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	please explain? :)
2010-09-12T02:52:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	the basic block size for disks nowadays is 512 bytes - but in a few years from now, all new disks/chipsets will have a 4k block size
2010-09-12T02:53:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	OK, but I dont assume I have that now?
2010-09-12T02:53:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	if you try and dd an entire disk, you will end with partitions _not_ aligned to sector boundaries and performance will suffer a great deal
2010-09-12T03:54:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	well, it stops
2010-09-12T03:55:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	orly? :P I just wondered if there were any risk of corrupting the disk (ofc the of= could be, but how about if=)
2010-09-12T03:56:00.000Z	idletask	bjaanes	dd will never botch its source file
2010-09-12T03:56:00.000Z	bjaanes	idletask	thanks, all i wanted to know :D
