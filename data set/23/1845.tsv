2010-01-30T04:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Mysterious	i doubt i can really help much with that. but, do you know if the device is recognized by the linux kernel?
2010-01-30T04:30:00.000Z	Mysterious	onetinsoldier	the drive manager shows details like name etc. of the drive
2010-01-30T04:30:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Mysterious	roger. you mean the device manager?
2010-01-30T04:31:00.000Z	Mysterious	onetinsoldier	palimpsest
2010-01-30T04:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Mysterious	how are you trying to get it mounted?
2010-01-30T04:32:00.000Z	Mysterious	onetinsoldier	i created a new entry in fstab, used the mount command
2010-01-30T04:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Mysterious	roger. i've never used palimpsest before. i'll have to check it out

2010-01-30T04:33:00.000Z	Mysterious	onetinsoldier	adding | pastebinit right?
2010-01-30T04:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Mysterious	perhaps post a pastebin of your /etc/fstab file

2010-01-30T04:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Mysterious	like i said, i probably can't help much with this. but, you should post the problem you are having and include the pastebin url that has you fstab file and the errors you are getting when you post the problem into the channel
