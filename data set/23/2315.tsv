2010-02-02T11:39:00.000Z	toastedmilk	indus	Hrm.  I suppose I could make a partition and just do a fresh install of 8.04...do I have to get fglrx to use it?

2010-02-02T11:39:00.000Z	indus	toastedmilk	thats why 8.04 is called long term support
2010-02-02T11:40:00.000Z	toastedmilk	indus	put didn't ATI stop supporting the Catalyst driver?
2010-02-02T11:40:00.000Z	indus	toastedmilk	ubuntu 8.04 comes with the older driver
2010-02-02T11:40:00.000Z	indus	toastedmilk	its not supported on newer kernels thats all
