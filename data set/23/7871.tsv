2005-04-07T07:19:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		is there anyway of automatically running an sh script in ubuntu from a windows machine?
2005-04-07T07:20:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		does anyone know if thats possible?
2005-04-07T07:20:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		what i really want to do is shutdown the ubuntu machine from my windows desktop automatically
2005-04-07T07:22:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		i could do, but i want it to be automated
2005-04-07T07:22:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		as it needs shutting down once a backup has completed
2005-04-07T07:23:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		or where would be a good place to look re. remote execution of sh?
2005-04-07T07:24:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		hahaha already tried
2005-04-07T07:24:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		pizbit: the backup script is run from windows - rsync daemon runs on ubuntu
2005-04-07T07:24:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke		pizbit: would there be anyway of appending a shut down command within the rsync daemon??
2005-04-07T07:25:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	write a batch script that logs onto the ubuntu machine via ssh and issues the shutdown command
2005-04-07T07:25:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke	theine	how would i go about doing that?
2005-04-07T07:26:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	go to http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
2005-04-07T07:26:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	you can do that with Plink I think
2005-04-07T07:27:00.000Z	jw_ma_ke	theine	what is Plink?
2005-04-07T07:27:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	ever heard of putty?
2005-04-07T07:27:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	ever used ssh?
2005-04-07T07:28:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	well, i think you should do some reading about ssh
2005-04-07T07:28:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	But in the end you will be able to do it with Plink...
2005-04-07T07:29:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	I'm fairly sure
2005-04-07T07:30:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	sudo apt-get install ssh
2005-04-07T07:33:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	that's windows only
2005-04-07T07:33:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	there might even be a linux version but you won't need that
2005-04-07T07:34:00.000Z	theine	jw_ma_ke	sudo apt-get install ssh OR sudo apt-get install openssh-server
