2007-01-28T07:07:00.000Z	esaym		In ubuntu lamp what controls the log rotations of apache?
2007-01-28T07:07:00.000Z	esaym		there is nothing is cron but the logs are being rotated
2007-01-28T07:08:00.000Z	esaym		hmm
2007-01-28T07:09:00.000Z	esaym		I thought because the apache logs where in their own dirctory that it would have to be configured
2007-01-28T07:09:00.000Z	esaym		but there is nothing in logrotate or cron for apache
2007-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	esaym		pretty sure
2007-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	check /etc/logrotate.d
2007-01-28T07:09:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	are you sure?
2007-01-28T07:10:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	if you installed the apache package... it will install the log roller
2007-01-28T07:11:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	what mods do you have running
2007-01-28T07:12:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	yes it does...
2007-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	because it needs to close the filehandle on the log and open a new one..
2007-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	 server opens the Inode for the log file
2007-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	writes to that inode
2007-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	log roller renames the log file
2007-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	filename changes but the inode is till the same and the file handle still remains open
2007-01-28T07:13:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	you need to kill the server to close the filehandle and reopen...
2007-01-28T07:14:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	i think there IS a way to do it without killing bit i can't remember
2007-01-28T07:14:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	that won't help with rolling the logs... do you need to roll them every day?
2007-01-28T07:15:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	so... change the restart command
2007-01-28T07:15:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	it lets the server finish up things
2007-01-28T07:16:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	apache2ctl graceful
2007-01-28T07:18:00.000Z	Alpha232	esaym	but just change the file to say do it monthly
