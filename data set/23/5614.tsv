2007-05-04T13:58:00.000Z	xjkx		I am frankly sorry if i am being off-topic but, my xubuntu doesnt run, it freezes on the very very beginning on "starting up", then i ran safe mode and it also frozen on: "cannot alocate resource for eisa slot 1, `same message` slot 4, freeing unnused kernel memory, input: At translated set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input1"
2007-05-04T13:58:00.000Z	xjkx		and then freezes
2007-05-04T13:58:00.000Z	xjkx		tried vga=normal as someone else recommended
2007-05-04T13:58:00.000Z	xjkx		but did not work
2007-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	xjkx		i dont even know if the problem is video card
2007-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	xjkx		it doesnt even pass the first screen after grub
2007-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	so are there Eisa slots in your machine?
2007-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	unsure
2007-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	hmmm, then it will be very difficult to help you ...
2007-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	i am almost sure it doesnt
2007-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	wait, i think it really doesnt
2007-05-04T14:01:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	wht type of computer is it? age, processor, ram, desktop or laptop?
2007-05-04T14:02:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	desktop
2007-05-04T14:02:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	i have a semprom 2600+
2007-05-04T14:03:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	ah, ok , so it's halfway recent
2007-05-04T14:03:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	try passing acpi=off on the boot line and see if it boots then (for a test)
2007-05-04T14:04:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	i wouldnt think the problem is the eisa message but the last one, because its where it freezes, but i will try what you say, any other recommendations? its a pain in the ass to boot by livecd each time (funny is that it runs fine in livecd)
2007-05-04T14:06:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	kernel problems aren't offtopic... be it xubuntu or ubuntu, they use the same kernel
2007-05-04T14:07:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	good to know
2007-05-04T15:44:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	do you think if i download a kernel on kernel.org and compile would make it work?
2007-05-04T15:47:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	yes, if you configure it right
2007-05-04T15:48:00.000Z	xjkx	stefg	just make oldconfig woudltn work?
2007-05-04T15:49:00.000Z	stefg	xjkx	no... ubuntu kernels are heavily patched (as you experience) . and you have to avoid compiling the unneeded/unwanted stuff.
