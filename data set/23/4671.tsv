2007-06-06T07:49:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	have you verified your routing table?
2007-06-06T07:50:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	route -n
2007-06-06T07:50:00.000Z	johnny	CafeQuente	even if the wired works fine?
2007-06-06T07:52:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	i got a similar problem with my Dell D620. The wireless was fine, but the the routing table was screwd.
2007-06-06T07:53:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	i deleted all the routing rules by hand (the init script was useless for that), rerouted everything "in the right way" and bum: everything went fine.
2007-06-06T07:53:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	the wired interface is working ok?
2007-06-06T07:53:00.000Z	johnny	CafeQuente	yes
2007-06-06T07:54:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	exactly the same problem.

2007-06-06T07:54:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	route del everything.
2007-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	CafeQuente	johnny	route everything again, by hand.
