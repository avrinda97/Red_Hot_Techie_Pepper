2006-04-25T12:01:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	the module for my network card is only present in 2.6.16
2006-04-25T12:01:00.000Z	CNAP	romulo	no apt-get upgrade or anything like that huh?
2006-04-25T12:01:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	well not using dapper yet.
2006-04-25T12:02:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	im on debian-amd64 and using 2.6.16 so its here, on 2.6.15 it wasnt working.
2006-04-25T12:09:00.000Z	CNAP	romulo	how are you recompiling it? i've never actually have successfully recompiled a kernel
2006-04-25T12:10:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	ive recompiled it many times, doing make-kpkg --revision=something.0.1 kernel-image or linux-image
2006-04-25T12:13:00.000Z	CNAP	romulo	there's a .deb file for the kernel?
2006-04-25T12:13:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	for the one im using on amd64 now, there is
2006-04-25T12:41:00.000Z	CNAP	romulo	just tried installing that linux-image 2.16 and ran into some problems. aparently dependencies didn't match. any idea what else i need to download along with the linux-image ?
2006-04-25T12:41:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	will check
2006-04-25T12:57:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	uname -r

2006-04-25T12:58:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	like, you isntalled a new one?
2006-04-25T12:59:00.000Z	CNAP	romulo	yes i believe i did.  did an "apt-get install linux-image-2.6.15-20-686"
2006-04-25T13:00:00.000Z	romulo	CNAP	ok so AFAIK you should reboot
