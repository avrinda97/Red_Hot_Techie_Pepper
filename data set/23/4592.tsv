2007-07-03T07:51:00.000Z	Hizzeh	Pelo	when do I type that in terminal? Is that when I have the ndiswrapper-1.47.tar.gz on my desktop?
2007-07-03T07:52:00.000Z	Pelo	Hizzeh	you have a tar gz ?  sorry different proceedure ,   first unpack the tar.gz ,  then look for a readme or an install file , read the install file first if you ahve it it often contains instrucitons
2007-07-03T07:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Hizzeh	forget the apt-get line I gave you , if you have the ndiswrapper souce code  you will just have to compile it
2007-07-03T07:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Hizzeh	 you have the tar gz file ?   pastebin the intall file for me so I can have a look and tell you how to install it
