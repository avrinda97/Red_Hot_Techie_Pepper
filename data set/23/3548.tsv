2008-11-29T08:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	shipit.ubuntu.com
2008-11-29T08:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	if you can wait 4 weeks or so ;)
2008-11-29T08:19:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	seen this?  http://nsnam.isi.edu/nsnam/index.php/Main_Page
2008-11-29T09:23:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	maybe with  growisofs ? (not sure on that one)
2008-11-29T09:24:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	nope, that doesn't look right.  cdrecord ?
2008-11-29T09:31:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	what file did you download?
2008-11-29T09:32:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	full link please
2008-11-29T09:34:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	your system may not have the requirements for that package
2008-11-29T09:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	if you are running Ubuntu 5.10, it's probably better to use some terminal based program
2008-11-29T09:37:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	it's possible (just may not be easy)
2008-11-29T09:44:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	scunizi : I think  cdrecord (aka wodim) may be the one
2008-11-29T09:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	you have  gnomebaker ?
2008-11-29T09:54:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	yep, as 5.10 is no longer supported
2008-11-29T09:54:00.000Z	DistroJockey	glusce	you will have to get it from elsewhere
