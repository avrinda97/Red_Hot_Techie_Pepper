2011-04-25T07:46:00.000Z	Teeko		does anyone know if theres a way to connect remotely to a linux computer from a windows computer? like RDP would from windows to windows
2011-04-25T07:47:00.000Z	Teeko		need something pretty basic, just gotta be able to control it without it being super laggy
2011-04-25T07:48:00.000Z	jhjessup	Teeko	Look at VNC.
2011-04-25T07:49:00.000Z	Teeko		think VNC would be the best option?
2011-04-25T07:49:00.000Z	jhjessup	Teeko	Probably. http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ubuntu-remote-desktop-builtin-vnc-compatible-dead-easy/
2011-04-25T07:50:00.000Z	Teeko		heh thats awesome, thanks alot.
2011-04-25T07:51:00.000Z	Teeko		ok that made no sense
2011-04-25T07:51:00.000Z	Teeko		sorry. lol
2011-04-25T07:51:00.000Z	Teeko		whats an SSH tunnel?
2011-04-25T07:54:00.000Z	jhjessup	Teeko	VNC connections aren't protected with strong enctryption, so it's possible for a third party to intercept VNC communications. Consequently, if you're using VNC on a network with untrusted users (i.e., the internet instead of your home network) you should run it through an encrypted tunnel, like SSH.
2011-04-25T07:55:00.000Z	Teeko	jhjessup	i get that actually :P but i still have absolutely no idea what an SSH tunnel is or how to set one up
2011-04-25T07:56:00.000Z	jhjessup	Teeko	Got it. A good overview article is at http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/21/how-to-ssh-tunnels-for-secure-network-access/
2011-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	Teeko		oh um
2011-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	Teeko		i just need to be able to control that computer from anywhere
2011-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	Teeko		when im away from my house, i need to be able to access it
2011-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	Teeko		use it as i was sitting right in front of it
2011-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	Teeko		not just use the files
2011-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	Teeko		take over the desktop
2011-04-25T07:59:00.000Z	Teeko		i use remote desktop on windows now, but im trying to find things out before i set that computer up with linux, so i know what im doing atleast halfheartedly
2011-04-25T07:59:00.000Z	Teeko		which would be faster?
2011-04-25T07:59:00.000Z	Teeko		i dont need many features, but speed is important
2011-04-25T08:00:00.000Z	Teeko		ok well what does ssh do?
2011-04-25T08:00:00.000Z	jhjessup	Teeko	I haven't used it, but a couple of my friends really like teamviewer. http://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/index.aspx
