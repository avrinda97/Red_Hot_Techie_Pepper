2009-10-28T10:34:00.000Z	tanxxx		My VPN server,the client just can access to the local resoures.
2009-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	tanxxx		What's the promblem?
2009-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	tanxxx		i try everything and didn't work.
2009-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	can you use more sentences to describe what's wrong?
2009-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	because i have no idea what you're asking
2009-10-28T10:36:00.000Z	tanxxx	maco	Thank for your attention. I mean
2009-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	tanxxx	maco	I make a VPN server.But when client connect to it,the client just can access to the local resoures
2009-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	tanxxx	maco	Can't access to the Internet.
2009-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	sounds like the route being sent by your vpn's dhcp isn't configured for split tunneling
2009-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	your route is definitely the problem. is it that you can only reach your local LAN, only your VPN's network, both of those two but not the net...or what?
2009-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	tanxxx	maco	Just the VPN's network.
2009-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	ok, so you need split tunneling. youre going to have to figure out what IP range should be going through the VPN and what should not
2009-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	tanxxx	maco	Sorry,my English is poor.I trying my best to describle my problem.
2009-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	split tunneling means you have certain data go to the VPN and certain data go elsewhere
2009-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	htats not the problem
2009-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	its the output of "route -n" that needs to change
2009-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	are you using network manager vpn plugins or the command line?
2009-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	tanxxx	maco	command line
2009-10-28T10:44:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	awww now you're going to make me have to remember commands i haven't used in years :P
2009-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	can we take this to PM?
2009-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	maco	tanxxx	this channel is too busy
2009-10-28T10:50:00.000Z	tanxxx	maco	Certainly
