2007-10-21T15:10:00.000Z	Dumptruck		Hello - Why would I not be able to have write support for internal drives with NTFS-3g? I am trying to save a boot.ini file to the windows drive
2007-10-21T15:10:00.000Z	Dumptruck		I get the following error:
2007-10-21T15:10:00.000Z	Dumptruck		cp: cannot create regular file `/media/disk/boot.ini': Read-only file system
2007-10-21T15:11:00.000Z	Dumptruck		no feisty
2007-10-21T15:12:00.000Z	Dumptruck		if I upgrade to feisty fawn will I need to reinstall everything?
2007-10-21T15:12:00.000Z	Dumptruck		I am not that familiar with the upgrade process
2007-10-21T15:12:00.000Z	Dumptruck		how do I do it?
2007-10-21T15:13:00.000Z	Dumptruck		and will all of my files be saved in the same place?
2007-10-21T15:13:00.000Z	Dumptruck		excellant
2007-10-21T15:13:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	why upgrade to feisty when gutsy is already released
2007-10-21T15:16:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	the best method would be to download alternate cd and then popup the cd in the cd  tray
2007-10-21T15:18:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	http://releases.ubuntu.com/gutsy/ubuntu-7.10-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
2007-10-21T15:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	just pop the cd in the cd tray and relax
2007-10-21T15:20:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	to config install ntfs-config use sudo apt-get install ntfs-config and u can access this at applications>system tools
2007-10-21T15:21:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	to config install ntfs-config use sudo apt-get install ntfs-config and u can access this at applications>system tools
2007-10-21T15:22:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	also if u don't have ntfs-3g just sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
2007-10-21T15:22:00.000Z	Dumptruck	murlidhar	yes I have all of that
2007-10-21T15:23:00.000Z	Dumptruck	murlidhar	  "but it won't allow me to write to internal drives: it doesn't allow for the check boxes"
2007-10-21T15:23:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	then probly u have to use fstab
2007-10-21T15:23:00.000Z	Dumptruck	murlidhar	what is fstab and how do I use it?
2007-10-21T15:24:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	err i am not sure i can help u in fstab cuz i don't want to break ur filesystem so it is better if u ask a geek
2007-10-21T15:26:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	my advice would be to just upgrade to gutsy because it gives all this as default (ntfs)
2007-10-21T15:41:00.000Z	murlidhar	Dumptruck	just to be on safe side cuz the third party sources may only support feisty not gutsy
