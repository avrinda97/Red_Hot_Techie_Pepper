2008-02-09T10:21:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	or, ftp://x.org/pub/X11R7.0/doc/html/nv.4.html
2008-02-09T10:22:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	i'll look but they dropped support for my card years ago
2008-02-09T10:25:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	not listed there.    but thanks for the try.
2008-02-09T10:25:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	not listed on which
2008-02-09T10:26:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	exactly which card
2008-02-09T10:26:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	the first URL  the second lists nv as supporting the familey
2008-02-09T10:27:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	if nv supports it, the nvidia driver supports it also
2008-02-09T10:27:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	RIVA128 agp
2008-02-09T10:28:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	and no one has been able to provide any indication that my card has been supported sense X11R6
2008-02-09T10:30:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	but like i said, thanks for the attempt.  you would have nailed it if it was supported  ;/
2008-02-09T10:30:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	looks like you get to use nv and that's it
2008-02-09T10:30:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	see above ^  :)
2008-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	no. i'm not.  i'm saying it supports it almost as well as vesa does.
2008-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	you might get better performance running 16 bit instead of 32 (that thing does 32 eh?)  yeah no 3d
2008-02-09T10:37:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	what pci id does lspci | grep -i nvidia  return?
2008-02-09T10:38:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	i mean gpu model, not pciid
2008-02-09T10:40:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	(rev 22)
2008-02-09T10:40:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	or you mean the   NVidia / SGS Thomson   ?

2008-02-09T10:44:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	or, it's just one line...
2008-02-09T10:45:00.000Z	nuffin	jetscreamer	it's just one line and that's all of it really   NVidia / SGS Thomson Riva128 (rev 22)
2008-02-09T10:58:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nuffin	have you 'tried' ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/71.86.04/ ? according to the driver selector thing on nvidia.com, that supports riva128 . that's why i was trying to find out your pci id, to see if it's listed, but...   ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/71.86.04/README/README  (app-a) APPENDIX A
