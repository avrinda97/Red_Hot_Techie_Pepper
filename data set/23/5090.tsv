2007-02-23T11:48:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	ghort	ive had to re-install often because of these damn drivers, im kinda sick of it
2007-02-23T11:48:00.000Z	ghort	RkyRaccoon55	did you try to boot in safe mode (don't remember how it is called)
2007-02-23T11:49:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	ghort	yea "recover mode" or something?
2007-02-23T11:49:00.000Z	ghort	RkyRaccoon55	yup
2007-02-23T11:49:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	ghort	that works fine but i still cant do a standard boot
2007-02-23T11:49:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	ghort	when i try to re-load the xorg.conf file it says no file can be found
2007-02-23T11:49:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	ghort	i thought i backed it up ok
2007-02-23T11:50:00.000Z	ghort	RkyRaccoon55	what do you mean reload the xorg.conf file ?
2007-02-23T11:50:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	ghort	i made a backup of it incase this happened, i tried to replace the original with the backup and it said the original couldnt be found
