2011-04-01T17:08:00.000Z	lolmaus		I've created a user on ubuntu server and added it to the "admin" group. But when i try to login via SSH it says access denied. Why?
2011-04-01T17:09:00.000Z	lolmaus		I changed password to 123 so there's no typo
2011-04-01T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	can you « ssh localhost » on the server locally and login as the user?
2011-04-01T17:13:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	the server is remote. And i can login to it with my own user.
2011-04-01T17:14:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	fine do « ssh localhost » after you login with your own user
2011-04-01T17:15:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	yup, it did let me in
2011-04-01T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	you did « ssh non-working-user@localhost »?
2011-04-01T17:18:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	yes sir
2011-04-01T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	pastebin /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2011-04-01T17:18:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	btw, i'm trying SFTP over SSH, not just SSH
2011-04-01T17:20:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	but it won't let me in via Putty either... sshd_config should be default: http://pastie.org/1743452
2011-04-01T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	what do you mean "either"?  You said that « ssh non-working-user@localhost » DOES work, correct?
2011-04-01T17:27:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	it does work locally (after logging in remotely via my working user). But it does not work directly
2011-04-01T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	did you see what Pici said about how you created the user?
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	i've created my user with the interactive command
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	what interactive command?
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	adduser?
2011-04-01T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	why a question mark at the end of that?
2011-04-01T17:30:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	i don't remember which one of two is interactive :) It created the home folder and stuff. And it lets me in locally.
2011-04-01T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	can you pastebin your attempt at sshing remotely and all of the output?
2011-04-01T17:31:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	FCUK!!!! I'm an idiot
2011-04-01T17:31:00.000Z	lolmaus	jrib	the SSH port is NOT 22
2011-04-01T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	lolmaus	it is according to what you pasted :/
