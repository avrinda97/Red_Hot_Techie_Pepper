2009-09-27T05:50:00.000Z	MindSpark		hi, can someone tell me why the packages   linux-backports-modules-karmic linux-backports-modules-karmic-generic are kept back when upgrading ?
2009-09-27T05:50:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	are you upgrading to karmic?
2009-09-27T05:50:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	I've upgraded some time ago already, but I need to upgrade these packages
2009-09-27T05:51:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	well, the backports aren't installed (or used) unless you need them, so my guess is just that your computer doesn't need the kernel backports
2009-09-27T05:51:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	most don't.
2009-09-27T05:52:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	I am running an eee which needs the wlan module. I did this on jaunty, and now I need this on karmic to get wifi
2009-09-27T05:54:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	try sudo apt-get -f upgrade <package>
2009-09-27T05:54:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	ok, thanks
2009-09-27T05:57:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	linux-backports-modules-karmic: Depends: linux-backports-modules-karmic-generic (= 2.6.31.11.22) but 2.6.31.10.21 is to be installed
2009-09-27T05:58:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	how long ago did you do an apt-get update?
2009-09-27T05:59:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	a couple of hours ago
2009-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	it looks like the older version is pending to be installed...
2009-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	what does that mean ?
2009-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	what do I need to do
2009-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	well, from the message, it looks like the older version is pending an install...
2009-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	what happens if you do 'sudo aptitude safe-upgrade'?
2009-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	does it show packages to be upgraded?
2009-09-27T06:02:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	The following packages have been kept back:
2009-09-27T06:03:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	don't actually say "yes", but what happens if you do 'sudo aptitude dist-upgrade'?
2009-09-27T06:04:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	it looks like the packages are somehow broken
2009-09-27T06:04:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	ideally, you want to use aptitude as much as possible instead of apt-get
2009-09-27T06:05:00.000Z	squircle	MindSpark	may i PM you to prevent the channel from being flooded?
2009-09-27T06:05:00.000Z	MindSpark	squircle	sure, no need to ask
