2007-06-23T07:26:00.000Z	lorx		Hey. Im having a problem with my Audigy and Live soundcard, I cant get no digital output out of em. I have an extern DAC and it recieves the signal (48khz) when I turn on the "Audigy Analog/Digital" Switch on, so its not the cable/signal. But i get no sound out of it, what am I doing wrong? (PS. I'm newbie, so :>)
2007-06-23T07:26:00.000Z	lorx		I get the same problem with both cards.
2007-06-23T07:27:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	you need to use the alsamixer to unmute and use the digital outs
2007-06-23T07:27:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	open a terminal and type: alsamixer
2007-06-23T07:29:00.000Z	lorx	Gnea	how do i unmute it there? its just writing "00" and i cant turn it up or anything.
2007-06-23T07:29:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	OO means it's unmuted
2007-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	should say for the item: "SB Live Analog/Digital Output Jack"
2007-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	lorx	Gnea	yeah, it does. when i press "," it writes "mm", and the DAC losses the signal. But still no sound when i switch it on again :(
2007-06-23T07:32:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	hrm..
2007-06-23T07:36:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	ok, you may need to change the output device in your program from hw:0,0 to hw:0,2
2007-06-23T07:37:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	some more detailed info here: http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php/DigitalOut
2007-06-23T07:41:00.000Z	lorx	Gnea	that didnt work either, XMMS just complains that the device is blocked by an another application =(
2007-06-23T07:42:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	what about hw:0,3?
2007-06-23T07:43:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	you may need to stop the song, open the preferences, set the output channel, apply/ok, then play the song again
2007-06-23T07:44:00.000Z	lorx	Gnea	i did, same problem, with 0,3/0,4/0,5 its the same problem, it cant play the song because of hardware in use, but with the 0,1 there is no problem with playing, but no sound is coming out of the speaker.
2007-06-23T07:44:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	what other audio programs do you have running? any sound servers?
2007-06-23T07:45:00.000Z	lorx	Gnea	nothing, xmms is the only application, besides x-chat
2007-06-23T07:46:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	and nothing on that website makes a difference?
2007-06-23T07:53:00.000Z	lorx	Gnea	Nope, it can play with spdif and iec958, but still no sound is coming out of the speakers :(
2007-06-23T07:53:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	man.. wish i had a digital connection to test with :/
2007-06-23T07:53:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	i have the out, just not the equipment
2007-06-23T08:09:00.000Z	lorx	Gnea	hehe, its allright, but thanks for help anyway :>
2007-06-23T08:09:00.000Z	Gnea	lorx	good luck with that
