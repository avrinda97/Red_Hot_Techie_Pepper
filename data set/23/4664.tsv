2010-07-04T03:04:00.000Z	linuxnoob		Can anyone help?
2010-07-04T03:04:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I just finished "restoring GRUB" and no its screwing up yet again...
2010-07-04T03:06:00.000Z	linuxnoob		...
2010-07-04T03:06:00.000Z	linuxnoob		Where did the people who were helping me earlier go?
2010-07-04T03:07:00.000Z	linuxnoob		Nevermind.
2010-07-04T03:07:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I'm going to wipe again and reinstall
2010-07-04T03:09:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I know Linux is typically for the more tech inclined which I thought I was but shouldn't an OS like this just WORK and not give the end user hours of frustration just to boot to the login screen?
2010-07-04T03:09:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I'm serioius
2010-07-04T03:10:00.000Z	linuxnoob		I'm not trolling I've been working on this for the entire day and it keeps hanging right after the BIOS splash screen
2010-07-04T03:10:00.000Z	linuxnoob		Black and with a flashing udnerscore
2010-07-04T03:11:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	if you explain your problem than maybe you'll get help and please nothing vague do explain so other can understand
2010-07-04T03:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	how did you restore grub and what is this unknown error, can you go into recovery?
2010-07-04T03:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	that the problem you're not reading what your machine outputs if it tells you you need a firmware maybe you should try to find out what is the firmware, what type of machine you got (motherboard)
2010-07-04T03:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	 when it goes black can you change to any of the tty screens using ctrl+alt+f(1-6)?
2010-07-04T03:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	 how did you lose grub is this a clean install, have you got your graphics drivers loaded
2010-07-04T03:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	hmmm... was it working before or is this a clean install
2010-07-04T03:20:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	did you try the tty screens?
2010-07-04T03:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	 so its a clean install and your trying to fix it im not syaing the full day you've used up has gone to waste but wouldn't it have been much easier if you redo your installation and use the livecd to find out what type of hardware you have
2010-07-04T03:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	just checked you lappy online and apparently the only issue it had or still has with ubuntu is the sound and ethernet not working other than that it should work so I assume something went wrong on install
2010-07-04T03:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks look for your laptop and read what it says
2010-07-04T03:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	eeeerh sounds more like over heating and did you read that link?
2010-07-04T03:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	if it tells you to do that for your machine its because they know why and it tells you what to install as well
2010-07-04T03:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	linuxnoob	well at least its working even knowing I would feel better if the cause of the problem was known, still its better working than broken and you didn't have to reinstall which recently im more than happy suggesting people to do :'s
