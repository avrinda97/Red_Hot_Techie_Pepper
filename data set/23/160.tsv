2012-05-11T02:11:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ		hi. I have this problem installing xubuntu 11.10 (same with newest). Installing via usb flash, but when I choose any option, it does nothing and gives me a blinking cursor only. Would anyone help pls?
2012-05-11T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	what video chip do you use?
2012-05-11T02:13:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	seems like the problematic GMA somthing
2012-05-11T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	try the boot option:  nomodeset
2012-05-11T02:15:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	no difference
2012-05-11T02:16:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	i used .... quiet persistent nomodeset
2012-05-11T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	or the safemodevga option
2012-05-11T02:17:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	no difference :). I would just like to enter the rescue mode, that would help me alot.
2012-05-11T02:18:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	but when i select Help, i see dots being written, lots of them, fast.
2012-05-11T02:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	add the boot option:  vga=771
2012-05-11T02:19:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	no difference
2012-05-11T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	could try the alternate ISO, it installs in text mode
2012-05-11T02:20:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	i AM running from alternate CD. But when i select ANY option, i end up with blinking cursor..
2012-11-25T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh --upload
2012-11-25T01:06:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	sorry it took so long: http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=e019ff198ac38e216016f281f94c30f1b3356c72
2012-11-25T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	there are no sound cards detected in your system....
2012-11-25T01:08:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	I know. But why? The soundcard IS on the mobo. It has jacks and is enabled in bios..
2012-11-25T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	is it enabled in BIOS?
2012-11-25T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	i'd run:   dmesg | less     after a reboot and see if its deteted at boot
2012-11-25T01:21:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	dmesg: sharetext.org/YPfM
2012-11-25T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AndreeeCZ	you need to read that, see where and if the sound device gets seen
2012-11-25T01:25:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	i think its not there. But neither is my GPU which works
2012-11-25T01:31:00.000Z	AndreeeCZ	ActionParsnip	im sorry. The GPU is there, its just not stated the vendor or model.
