2009-08-30T13:30:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	i asked twice already
2009-08-30T13:31:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	ahh, is your burner drive sata?
2009-08-30T13:31:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	yes it is
2009-08-30T13:32:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	well you're not alone there, for some reason I have the exact same issue with mine whilst using brasero.. luckily I had an IDE type burner which will recognise the disc as a blank disc and therefore write to it
2009-08-30T13:32:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	never had this problem before
2009-08-30T13:33:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	meaning that you never had issues writing to sata burner and specifically under ubuntu?
2009-08-30T13:33:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	never had problems burning anything even data with my dvd drive under ubuntu
2009-08-30T13:34:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	well I dunno how to decrypt that but I suppose its yes to my question.. I'd suppose its probably some update that you may have done which may caused the issue
2009-08-30T13:34:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	do you know what i would have to update??
2009-08-30T13:35:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	cause when i go n burn it says sometihng bout plugins
2009-08-30T13:35:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	I'm afraid not, especially when if it was exactly the same setup you had before but have set to autoupdate or something.. maybe some package had an issue somewhere along the line
2009-08-30T13:36:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	so basically you saying you never gotten your problem fixed??
2009-08-30T13:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	ahh that would be handy, I'd search in the repo for any plugins in regards to that burning software
2009-08-30T13:36:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	im using brasero
2009-08-30T13:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	no because I have IDE burner also in the same computer as the SATA burner :) right now the SATA burner is unhooked because I'm already using all the SATA ports for hard drives
2009-08-30T13:37:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	hmm lemme check if theres plugins in the repo
2009-08-30T13:37:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	i need someone who can actually help me who knows what my problems is sorry
2009-08-30T13:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	I know what your problem is and I posted a solution but it seems you don't have an IDE burner hooked up so that is where my solution wouldn't help in your case
2009-08-30T13:39:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	no cause this comp only has one ide cable which is connected to my hdd
2009-08-30T13:39:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	i don't need anything to do with an ide connection.. its not my sata dvd drive if thats what you're getting at..
2009-08-30T13:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	GhostWolfy	you were saying it was sata burner no?
2009-08-30T13:40:00.000Z	GhostWolfy	psycho_oreos	yes but its not my burner thats having the issue
