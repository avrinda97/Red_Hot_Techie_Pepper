2006-04-09T08:38:00.000Z	spazzz		Evening everyone.  I was wondering if someone could help me with a problum.
2006-04-09T08:38:00.000Z	spazzz		I got all my files locked up on my Ubuntu drive and I can't get to them
2006-04-09T08:39:00.000Z	spazzz		http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=154792 has the info on the issue
2006-04-09T08:39:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	locked up means what exactly ?
2006-04-09T08:40:00.000Z	spazzz	mauper	The URL i gave you has pretty much the problum.  I can't access the partition that Ubuntu stored my /home directory n in a nutshell
2006-04-09T08:40:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	didn't saw the url ... I'm looking
2006-04-09T08:40:00.000Z	spazzz	mauper	Thanks
2006-04-09T08:41:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	so you want to recover the bootloader because windows killed it, right ?
2006-04-09T08:42:00.000Z	spazzz	mauper	Well that would work as well.  I plan on reinstalling Ubuntu anyway so all i need is to gain access to the partition.
2006-04-09T08:43:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	did you try knoppix oder any other livecd ?
2006-04-09T08:43:00.000Z	spazzz	mauper	Yes, That was in the post.  I already tried using knoppix and recovering grub
2006-04-09T08:43:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	what exactly did mount tell you ?
2006-04-09T08:44:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	if you just want to backup your data, that should be no problem using a live cd
2006-04-09T08:45:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	are you sure you got the right partition ? Did you try any other partion ? like /dev/hda1 ... /dev/hda5 or whatever
2006-04-09T08:46:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	mounting ext2|3 should work out of the box in knoppix
2006-04-09T08:48:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	or you could simply try to mount all ;) - shouldn't hurt
2006-04-09T08:49:00.000Z	spazzz	mauper	I can try that but if it's not mouting it when I try to specify it i doubt how doing a global mount will make it work\
2006-04-09T08:50:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	not global: just try to mount all the different partitions and see if the working ones contain your data
2006-04-09T08:50:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	otherwise I would assume your partition got corrupted ...
2006-04-09T08:51:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	just try mount /dev/hdb2 /to/what/ever
2006-04-09T08:53:00.000Z	spazzz	mauper	I doubt they got corrupted.  I remember going through all this before trying to get a windows EXT driver to read the disk with simmiler results
2006-04-09T08:53:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	did you try to mount /dev/hdb2 ?
2006-04-09T08:55:00.000Z	mauper	spazzz	mkay, now my insights: if you know you got the right partition and it doesn't mount, then I assume you got a problem ;)
