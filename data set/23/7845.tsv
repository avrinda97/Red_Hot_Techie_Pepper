2007-07-10T08:41:00.000Z	labradors		SITUATION: A private school in a remote area of a third-world country; no Internet connection on-site (only in the city, where I am now); 60 Windows XP machines to use as clients; want to set up ubuntu as samba server.  QUESTION: For the given situation, is 7.04 better, or is 6.06LTS better?
2007-07-10T08:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	tough call
2007-07-10T08:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	yeah, I'd tend to agree with Rienzilla
2007-07-10T08:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	there's not a lot in it
2007-07-10T08:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	how far from your school to the nearest internet connection?
2007-07-10T08:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	OpenSolaris!
2007-07-10T08:43:00.000Z	labradors		Nearest Internet connection is about nine miles.
2007-07-10T08:43:00.000Z	labradors		Due to terrain and road conditions, that's about a 45-minute drive.
2007-07-10T08:44:00.000Z	labradors		Otherwise, satellite Internet is just to expensive.
2007-07-10T08:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	hm, nine miles is a bit long for cheap off-the-shelf gear
2007-07-10T08:45:00.000Z	labradors		If you also have the $$$, Frog.
2007-07-10T08:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	if you've got clearish line-of-site you can get high-end P2P links that will do it no problem
2007-07-10T08:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	aha, yes
2007-07-10T08:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp		therein lies the rub
2007-07-10T08:45:00.000Z	labradors		In addition, the Internet connections in the city are, for example $90/mo for 128k of bandwidth.
2007-07-10T08:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	Orthogon Gemini Lite, 10Mbps bidirectional, about 6000 GBP
2007-07-10T08:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp		probably cheaper now
2007-07-10T08:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	would 9600 baud be any use?
2007-07-10T08:47:00.000Z	labradors	gordo	to compare to the local economy, my monthly rent is only $150.  6000 GBP is astronomical!
2007-07-10T08:47:00.000Z	labradors		Not sure about 9600, gordon.
2007-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	labradors		Will have to get the opinion of the guy who will have to use it.  I live in the city, but am helping out at the school.
2007-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	I don't know how much $150 is
2007-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	labradors	we don't have dollars here, we have the metric system
