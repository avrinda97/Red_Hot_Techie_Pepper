2008-09-28T15:18:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	i dont understand the link which you gave
2008-09-28T15:19:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	k, I can help you with that.  What's the first thing you don't understand in the link?
2008-09-28T15:19:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	there are many which i never used etc i dont know them
2008-09-28T15:20:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	huh?
2008-09-28T15:20:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	i dont understand what they are telling
2008-09-28T15:20:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	yeah, tell me the first sentence you don't understand?  There's a section called "Newer versions of Wine" discussing what you are interested in
2008-09-28T15:20:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	ok
2008-09-28T15:22:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	i got this http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb
2008-09-28T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	First, open a terminal window (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).  Then add the repository's key to your system's list of trusted APT keys by copy and pasting the following: wget -q http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/387EE263.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -      .  Have you done that?
2008-09-28T15:25:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	yup i did that
2008-09-28T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	no errors or output?
2008-09-28T15:27:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	it asked my password then output OK
2008-09-28T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	then move on to the next step.  Run: sudo wget http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/sources.list.d/hardy.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list
2008-09-28T15:28:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	15:28:32 (8.91 MB/s) - `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list' saved [180/180]   > OUT put
2008-09-28T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	then the last step (I'm just copying and paste the site verbatim here): sudo apt-get update
2008-09-28T15:30:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	 output >> Reading package lists... Done
2008-09-28T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	you're done.  You should have an update for wine in your update-manager
2008-09-28T15:30:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	oh u mean now i should update my ubuntu? coz there are updates available
2008-09-28T15:31:00.000Z	jrib	Aaqil	yeah
2008-09-28T15:31:00.000Z	Aaqil	jrib	thanks :D
