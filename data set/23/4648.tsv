2007-06-26T10:31:00.000Z	james296		sorry to be off topic but this is VERY important for me and someone at my class, is it possible to boot from an external Western Digital HD on a HP Omnibook 500?
2007-06-26T10:32:00.000Z	james296		I already know he does have that option
2007-06-26T10:32:00.000Z	james296		but...
2007-06-26T10:32:00.000Z	james296		I tried to boot from a flash memory card, it detected it but couldnt boot from it
2007-06-26T10:32:00.000Z	james296		no his computer doesnt run linux at all
2007-06-26T10:32:00.000Z	james296		it runs Windows 2000 Pro
2007-06-26T10:33:00.000Z	james296		but I accidently deleted his boot partition...
2007-06-26T10:34:00.000Z	james296		no it was a seperate partition in his HD that had Windows 98 that came preinstalled on the comp, but it wasnt labeled or anything so I figured it was wasting space
2007-06-26T10:34:00.000Z	james296		he doesnt have a CD rom drive though
2007-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	james296		whats that gonna do if the boot partiton isnt on the comp and it doesnt have a CD rom drive?
2007-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	did  you see the flash stick in the BIOS?
2007-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	like could you select it in the boot order?
2007-06-26T10:36:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	hrm... i'm guessing there's no usb floppy or cd rom drives sittin around?
2007-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	you can boot a floppy?
2007-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	what do you mean...
2007-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	no get a win98 boot disk
2007-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	doubt it
2007-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	what was wrong with the boot disk?  did you setup the disk correctly?
2007-06-26T10:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	you should be able to fix the mbr with that...
2007-06-26T10:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	he's got a good point, move the hdd to your external enclosure & get the data off of it
2007-06-26T10:42:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	since i guess you're not willing to use the win98 boot disk properly
2007-06-26T10:44:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	if you have an external enclosure for a hdd and an internal cdrom drive that should work
2007-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	james296	an internal cdrom drive at all
