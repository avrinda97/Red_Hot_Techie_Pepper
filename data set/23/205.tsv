2012-04-01T20:40:00.000Z	TorbenBeta		Is there a way to copy and paste a line of text (a command in a txt, viewed on via less) in full screen terminal mode?
2012-04-01T20:41:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	its just a tip
2012-04-01T20:41:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	you should use screen to view the command and write down in another window :)
2012-04-01T20:41:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	there is no direct method? Is "screen" a command?
2012-04-01T20:42:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	thanks then. Screen has no man page therefore I guess you mean the physical sreen?
2012-04-01T20:43:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	screen might not be installed by default
2012-04-01T20:44:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	Well, its main goal: 'Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells'
2012-04-01T20:45:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	so is it a window manager Ã  la Nautilus?
2012-04-01T20:45:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	nope
2012-04-01T20:45:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	its like having multiple terminal logins at the same time, but you only need to do that once
2012-04-01T20:46:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	like multiple shells in one session?
2012-04-01T20:46:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	exactly
2012-04-01T20:46:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	but they can interact with each other?
2012-04-01T20:46:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	Please rephrase that last question of yours
2012-04-01T20:48:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	with pleasure. My question was: I have several shells in one session, and those shells can interact with each other? So I can e.g. pipe informations from child-shell 1 to child-shell 2?
2012-04-01T20:49:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	not exactly
2012-04-01T20:49:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	so they can't interact with each other? As I want to copy a string of text and paste it in my prompt.
2012-04-01T20:50:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	no, but you can always switch back and manually write the command
2012-04-01T20:51:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	like you would have two monitors and you can switch to the right one any time you want :)
2012-04-01T20:51:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	I could just open a new local workplace instead? (doable in 11.10 per ctl + alt + Fx)
2012-04-01T20:52:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	yepp pretty much. im stuck with debian :)
2012-04-01T20:55:00.000Z	v3nc3	TorbenBeta	you are welcome
2012-04-01T21:18:00.000Z	TorbenBeta	v3nc3	well screen froze my terminal.
