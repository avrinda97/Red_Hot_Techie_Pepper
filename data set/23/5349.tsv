2006-12-22T06:21:00.000Z	noona		how can i enable a network connection between windows xp and knoppix live cd?
2006-12-22T06:23:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	what kind of a question is that?? :)  windows is windows and knoppix, knoppix ; they're two completely different OSes
2006-12-22T06:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	ohh, sorry, my bad -- are both of them able to get on the network/internet?
2006-12-22T06:25:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	you'll need somethign connecting up the knoppix and XP computers -- like ethernet or wifi? do you have that up atleast?
2006-12-22T06:26:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	how are you going to hook them up -- throught a hub/switch or directly?
2006-12-22T06:29:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	ok, as long as that's right -- you need to assign ip addresses to each comp in the same network -- i'm assuming you know how to do that on windows -- on knoppix, under the start menu > knoppix > Network/Interent Network card config
2006-12-22T06:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	for the XP comp use 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0  for knoppix use 192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0
2006-12-22T06:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	DHCP wouldnt be of any use here as XP doesnt have a DHCP server built into it
2006-12-22T06:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	set it manually dude -- dont use DHCP
2006-12-22T06:38:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	one up from the last number
2006-12-22T06:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	did you give XP an IP address? and what IP address did you give Knoppix?
2006-12-22T06:49:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	that depends on what IP address you gave XP
2006-12-22T06:50:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	well, we told you twice alread -- set both computers to have a manual IP address
2006-12-22T06:50:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	are you asking how you determine XP's ip address?
2006-12-22T06:51:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	didnt you say you had both these computers hooked up via a cross-over cable?
2006-12-22T06:52:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	then the IP address on the XP interface connecting to knoppix has to be given an IP address by you
2006-12-22T06:52:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	that interface's ip address has nothing to do with your ISP
2006-12-22T06:52:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	please, just do it, ok :)
2006-12-22T06:53:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	well, if you havent manually set one as of yet -- then you should do that now -- otherwise the ipconfig information will be of no use to you
2006-12-22T06:54:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	control panel -- network connections -- <connection name> -- right click -- properties -- select tcp/ip -- properties ---
2006-12-22T06:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	aye, yes -- use 192.168.1.1 as ip address and 255.255.255.0 as subnet mask here
2006-12-22T06:56:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	yes
2006-12-22T06:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	noona	1.1
