2007-05-02T12:38:00.000Z	midgewa		piNNoy; try beryl, its more fun anyway
2007-05-02T12:39:00.000Z	midgewa		theJokercard; one thing, when u finish downloading it doesnt add to menus, so u have to run it with terminal
2007-05-02T12:41:00.000Z	midgewa		any opera users here?
2007-05-02T12:41:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	I used to be...
2007-05-02T12:44:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	no...Opera is fast. Much faster than Firefox (even with Fasterfox enabled). The fastest browser in the world is indeed Dillo. It's up in less than 5 seconds. But...(there's always a catch!) it's very simple (no frames, no crypto, and so on).
2007-05-02T12:47:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	the only thing I usually run out of patience with with Opera is Flash presentations: they go really slow (on Ubuntu).
2007-05-02T12:48:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	I wonder why. It's always been the opossite...
2007-05-02T12:48:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	what version of Opera do yo use?
2007-05-02T12:49:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	you're state of the art now. Hmmm...
2007-05-02T12:49:00.000Z	midgewa	lgc	yeah which is why i dont get it... on windows opera was by far the best id tried
2007-05-02T12:50:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	you have another choice: Mozilla. It's on the repo's too. You might want to give it a try...
2007-05-02T12:52:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	no. Firefox is the "light" version of Mozilla. I don't know much about the innards, but they look different and they are on different installs.
2007-05-02T12:54:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	no, because mozilla is on the repositories and Opera isn't. Type 'aptitude search mozilla' if you want to have a look at the packages.
2007-05-02T12:55:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	I haven't upgraded to Opera 9.20 yet, but I remember I had to do some sort of (easy) manual installation with the STATIC package. Did you use the static version too?
2007-05-02T12:56:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	perhaps you might have to import your bookmarks and so. But it's not a Firefox clone (or the other way around). It behaves differently. It's the good-old Netscape!
2007-05-02T12:57:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	'ldd /usr/bin/opera' should tell you.
2007-05-02T13:00:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	then it's the static version.
2007-05-02T13:03:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	it more or less means it doesn't go look for system libraries to run, but it has its own. This mean it is marginally faster, but bulkier than the dynamic version (if I'm saying something wrong here please someone correct me). No you didn't do it wrong. I was trying to find out if perhaps the dynamic version was the culprit of the slowness.
2007-05-02T13:05:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	and you are on a new Ubuntu release?
2007-05-02T13:05:00.000Z	midgewa	lgc	feisty
2007-05-02T13:07:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	then I don't know. You might want to try luck at #opera, but it's a virtually dead channel. Or at the Opera forums.
2007-05-02T13:07:00.000Z	lgc	midgewa	for nothing...
