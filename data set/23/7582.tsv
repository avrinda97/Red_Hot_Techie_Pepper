2012-08-06T08:46:00.000Z	bfig		so it's everything built in
2012-08-06T08:48:00.000Z	bfig		sure, one second
2012-08-06T08:49:00.000Z	bfig		http://hpaste.org/72674 L3top
2012-08-06T08:51:00.000Z	bfig		my mic is not working
2012-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	bfig		i am running debian 64 bit, i installed the 32 bit alsa lib and it worked for a while, then stopped working again
2012-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	bfig		now, about that debian thing... it should be the same :p
2012-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	bfig		doubt it, he answered too slow :p
2012-08-06T08:53:00.000Z	bfig		mic volume is not muted
2012-08-06T08:53:00.000Z	bfig		i spent a good five or so hours touching alsabase.conf and playing with the mixer
2012-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	bfig		with help from somebody at #debian
2012-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	Tm_T	bfig	hi, this is not debian support channel (:
2012-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	bfig		but this problem should be the same in both
2012-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	bfig		the problem is already omre or less isolated: alsamixer configuration
2012-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	bfig		and debian is like 90% ubuntu anyway
2012-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	Tm_T	bfig	hi, this is not debian support channel (: (I don't like repeating though)
2012-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	bfig		would you say how sound works is really different theadmin ?
2012-08-06T08:56:00.000Z	bfig		just forget that i said debian, think about ubuntu 64 bits
2012-08-06T08:56:00.000Z	Tm_T	bfig	also let's continue this discussion some other channel than this, thanks
2012-08-06T08:56:00.000Z	bfig		which channel do you suggest?
2012-08-06T08:57:00.000Z	bfig	theadmin	i don't see you there
2012-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	bfig		ahh.. whatever >_>
2012-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	bfig		thanks for the ideas anyway
2012-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	Tm_T	bfig	#ubuntu is busy channel already enough, so let's not have any offtopic chatter here please, you can try discussing the difference about ubuntu and debian on #ubuntu-offtopic for example
