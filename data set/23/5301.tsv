2007-10-04T10:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	try http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm.  much easier shorter steps that have worked for me many times.
2007-10-04T10:20:00.000Z	Innomen	Scunizi	havent read that one
2007-10-04T10:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	I keep a printed reference "just in case" I hose something.. One piece of advice it give is how to setup grub on all boot partiitons incase of a drive failure or other calamity.  It's expecially usefull if you have multiple Linux's installed.
2007-10-04T10:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	those giving advice are now confused... what are you after?  a gui tool?
2007-10-04T10:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	you have to use the command line to install grub to the MBR....
2007-10-04T10:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	shot in the dark here. but I had a prob w/ SATA too.  I found out that my primary boot drive in BIOS was not plugged into SATA connector 0 (or 1 depending on how you look at it). Once I changed it and reconfigured the bios, went through setting up grub again it worked flawlessly for dual boot., CC: ikonia
2007-10-04T10:38:00.000Z	Innomen	Scunizi	the bios on the dell gx260 ios garbage i have almot no options, its like a super nintendo
2007-10-04T10:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	after changing the plug on the drive to the appropriate connector on the MB, all I did was re-setup the boot order of the drives..
2007-10-04T10:39:00.000Z	Innomen	Scunizi	right on
2007-10-04T10:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	did you switch the cables to make it work or was it something else that ikonia fixed? I'm multitasking so I missed something.
2007-10-04T10:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	great.. glad to hear it's now working.
2007-10-04T10:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	everyone here is a user and offering free help.. nobody get's paid
2007-10-04T10:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	Innomen	as you learn the system and how to do things, "tag.. you're it!"  It'll be your turn to return the favor to someone else.  :)
