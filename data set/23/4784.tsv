2009-08-24T04:14:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	if you can cut & paste last command I'll try again.
2009-08-24T04:15:00.000Z	stefg	graham__	you need to be root ... sudo -i
2009-08-24T04:16:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	The program 'mdadm' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2009-08-24T04:17:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	apt-get install mdadm?
2009-08-24T04:17:00.000Z	stefg	graham__	right ...
2009-08-24T04:19:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	now says - mdadm: array /dev/md0 started.
2009-08-24T04:19:00.000Z	stefg	graham__	good ...
2009-08-24T04:20:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	mdadm: array /dev/md1 started.
2009-08-24T04:21:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	mdadm: array /dev/md2 started.
2009-08-24T04:22:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	mdadm: array /dev/md3 started.
2009-08-24T04:23:00.000Z	stefg	graham__	alright. so now the raptors are set up as a raid array. md0 will be /boot (raid1),  md1 will be / (raid0), md2 will be swap (raid0) , md3 will be /home (raid0)
2009-08-24T04:25:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	ok. so now should just be case of running install, telling  current partitions what they are and letting it roll?
2009-08-24T04:25:00.000Z	stefg	graham__	take not of that.. now you're going to start the real install with the alternate cd. once you get to the partitioning part you can instantly choose 'activate raid' and tell the installer what we had in mind. Don't use the installer from the CD you're running now
2009-08-24T04:27:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	not it wrote down. only thing I'm now unsure of is exactly what to install into the tiny /boot partition and what to put into the /root partition?  I'm assuming I flag the /boot as the partition to boot from.
2009-08-24T04:27:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	sorry meant *got it wrote down.
2009-08-24T04:28:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	and ubuntu will know what to do with the /root partition.?
2009-08-24T04:28:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	and finally, bacause the boot partitions are mirrored, it should only need to write grub to one of them as it will automatically be mirrored to other?
2009-08-24T04:29:00.000Z	stefg	graham__	when running the alternate install now you are on your own unless you have a second computer to connect to this cahnnel. the idea is  that you skip the actual partitioning (we did this) and just tell the installer to use md0 for /boot, md1 for / , md2 for swao, and md3 for /home
2009-08-24T04:29:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	sorry for all questions. just feel that this time, with your help, I may finally be close to having this setup and nearly working - so don't want to screwup on final steps.
2009-08-24T04:31:00.000Z	stefg	graham__	so you are aware that you have to reboot now and install from the other (alternate) CD ?
2009-08-24T04:31:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	ok. I'm ready to roll. thanks very much for you time its greatly appreciated. This irc channel and the people that populate it to help and advise is fantastic. you offer a great service. I just I could buy you a gallon of beer.
2009-08-24T04:32:00.000Z	graham__	stefg	yes. doing it now. just wanted to say thanks.  if it fails, I'll have to ask missus nicely if she'll move off of facebook for 10 minutes and I'll try connect there. thanks again.
