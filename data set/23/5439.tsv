2006-12-21T17:55:00.000Z	sushi_		Does anyone run ATI + Beryl ?
2006-12-21T15:46:00.000Z	sushi_		Hi what are some other 3D drivers for my ATI video card ?  I heard of fglrx but I heard there was other ones
2006-12-21T15:47:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	Which card?
2006-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	I don't think you will get direct rendering on that without FGLRX
2006-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	Mesa is an implementation of OpenGL
2006-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	And for example the r300 driver enables direct rendering for ATI cards using the r300 chipset through the mesa libraries
2006-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	sushi_	racarr	dont I need OpenGL in order to do some 3D stuff?   See my problem is that I failed the 3D part of Cedega... but fglrx seems to be working
2006-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	For your card flgrx is the only option to get direct rendering / 3D acceleration
2006-12-21T15:53:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	No, you don't need XGL
2006-12-21T15:54:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	But if glxinfo says you have direct rendering AIGLX isn't on either
2006-12-21T15:55:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	But you don't need aiglx or composite to use what you are trying to do
2006-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	You s aid you were trying to play GAMES though right?
2006-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	You do NOT need AIGLX or Composite for games and your ATI fglrx driver will be fine
2006-12-21T15:59:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	If you want 3D acceleration AND AIGLX you can use the 'radeon' driver, but it will be slower
2006-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	sushi_	racarr	without direct rendering    my movies play at a slow framerate =\
2006-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	But you said you had direct rendering
2006-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	sushi_	racarr	yeah and the only way i can get beryl to do anything is when i turn on compositing ...
2006-12-21T16:03:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	Try the 'radeon' driver
2006-12-21T16:03:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	Performance will not be as good, but you can get direct rendering AND compositing
2006-12-21T16:03:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	And beryl shohuld run acceptably
2006-12-21T16:05:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	You will fail the 3d test you wanted to pass every time with XGL
2006-12-21T16:05:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	Just a second, this channel is busy, going to send you a PM
2006-12-21T16:11:00.000Z	racarr	sushi_	Did you dissapear?
