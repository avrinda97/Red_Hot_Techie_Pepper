2004-11-25T14:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79		What runlevel do I have to set so that Ubuntu will boot into command-line rather than GNOME?
2004-11-25T14:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79		You won't be dissappointed, {Fah-Q}
2004-11-25T14:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79		=)
2004-11-25T14:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	Can you just uninstall gdm?
2004-11-25T14:25:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Xenguy	I don't want to uninstall GDM, I just want to boot straight into command line once or twice
2004-11-25T14:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	there are different ways, but you could just uninstall, then re-install when yer done
2004-11-25T14:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	or, I'm not sure if just temporarily doing cd /etc/init.d ; mv gdm gdm.OFF    would work or not ?
2004-11-25T14:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	what {Fah-Q} said, and there's a little tool I think you can apt-get called 'rcconf' that will help with managing services.
2004-12-10T09:15:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Xenguy	whatcha waiting for?
2004-12-10T09:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	CDs...

2004-12-10T09:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	command line interface
2004-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	re: FTPD's: the big 3 (not counting wu, which regularly shows security holes like a mac truck) appear to be proftpd, vsftpd, and pure-ftpd -- FWIW
2004-12-10T10:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	permission to scan your IP?
2004-12-10T10:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	OK I won't scan your IP

2004-12-10T10:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	do you mind if I /msg you?
2004-12-10T10:26:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Xenguy	of course not :)
2004-12-10T10:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	very well
2004-12-10T10:27:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Xenguy	I meant I don't mind... you can /msg me, of course1
2004-12-10T10:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	Hikaru79	I thought so, but it is considered good form to ask first ;-)
