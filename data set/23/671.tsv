2011-04-16T08:07:00.000Z	itilious		am i really putting my ubuntu computer at risk if i'm adding repositories from forums to get thunderbird update 3.1?

2011-04-16T08:08:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/thunderbird-stable
2011-04-16T08:08:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	official launchpad page
2011-04-16T08:09:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	thats legit but do you want to be running unstable software? I would add the stable repository
2011-04-16T08:10:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	it generally says in the repository what type it is
2011-04-16T08:11:00.000Z	itilious	Caboose885	if i remove that ppa i added and then change it to the one you suggest, would that change the installed version?
2011-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	I believe so. You already upgraded to the daily version?
2011-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	itilious	Caboose885	yes i just did and now trying to figure out how to go back lol
2011-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	you could purge the entire program...
2011-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	but any settings and emails will go away
2011-04-16T08:13:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	make backups
2011-04-16T08:15:00.000Z	itilious	Caboose885	which directory is thunderbird located in? i'm a n00b looking for the 'prog files' folder lol
2011-04-16T08:16:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	try home/.mozilla-thunderbird
2011-04-16T08:16:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	to uninstall it?
2011-04-16T08:17:00.000Z	itilious	Caboose885	purge/uninstall yes
2011-04-16T08:17:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	use Synaptic Package Manager (System-->Admin-->Synaptic)
2011-04-16T08:18:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	in the quick search box type "thunderbird" then mark the packages for complete removal
2011-04-16T08:18:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	just make sure it doesn't try and remove ubuntu-desktop or a extremely important package
2011-04-16T08:22:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	get it working?
2011-04-16T08:24:00.000Z	itilious	Caboose885	yep worked flawlessly
2011-04-16T08:25:00.000Z	Caboose885	itilious	np. You can always check Ubuntu Forums for help
