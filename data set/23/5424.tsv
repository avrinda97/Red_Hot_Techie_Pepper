2006-12-02T06:54:00.000Z	ivx		hey if i have folders in side folders in side folders that all need to have there permissions  changed, how can i change all the sub folders at the same time
2006-12-02T06:55:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	You need to use 'chmod' with the 'find' command so that it only changes the directories, not the files
2006-12-02T06:55:00.000Z	ivx		well i have to change all the files also
2006-12-02T06:55:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	Something like: find /top_folder -type d | xargs chmod 744
2006-12-02T06:56:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	But you don't want the files having the same perms as the directories, do you?
2006-12-02T06:56:00.000Z	ivx	_garry	yes
2006-12-02T06:56:00.000Z	ivx	_garry	so what will the 744 make it
2006-12-02T06:56:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	OK, then chmod -R 544 (or whatever) will do the job
2006-12-02T06:57:00.000Z	ivx	_garry	what would the number be for every to read/write/excute
2006-12-02T06:57:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	744 is rwxr--r--, which is read perms for everyone, write for owner, execute (or enter directory) for owner
2006-12-02T06:57:00.000Z	_garry		777 is rwx for everyone
2006-12-02T06:58:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	but that's very bad, security-wise
2006-12-02T06:58:00.000Z	ivx		so sudo find /dir/ -type d | xargs 777 will do it
2006-12-02T06:58:00.000Z	ivx	_garry	it is my www folder, they all have root only so ftp isn't working
2006-12-02T06:58:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	No, you left off the chmod command
2006-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	_garry		It would be something like: sudo find /dir -type d | xargs chmod 777
2006-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	ivx	_garry	so just throw chmod at the end
2006-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	_garry		But something like "chmod -R 777 www" should also work
2006-12-02T07:00:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	Just make sure you specify the full path to the directory. Or change to the one above it first
2006-12-02T07:01:00.000Z	ivx	_garry	yes got it thank you sir
2006-12-02T07:01:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	Best to check the manpages for 'find' and 'chmod' in case I got something wrong
2006-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	ivx	_garry	it worked, i just did it
2006-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	_garry	ivx	Great!
