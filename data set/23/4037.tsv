2008-01-14T14:17:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	I tried to install and run x11vnc, but it did not work.
2008-01-14T14:18:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	what do you mean by it did not work?
2008-01-14T14:19:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	did it give any error messages?
2008-01-14T14:22:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	x11vnc is a vnc server for a running X display, you need Xvnc
2008-01-14T14:22:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	I'll try Xvnc.
2008-01-14T14:24:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	there is no Xvnc package.
2008-01-14T14:30:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	try sudo apt-get install vncserver
2008-01-14T14:31:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	how about vnc4server?
2008-01-14T14:33:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	that should be fine
2008-01-14T14:34:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	I cannot connect still (I ran vncserver then went into Applications>>Internet>>Terminal Server Client)
2008-01-14T14:35:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	are you making sure to set the type to VNC in Terminal Server Client?
2008-01-14T14:36:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	yes.
2008-01-14T14:36:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	when you run vncserver do you get any error messages?
2008-01-14T14:39:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	(on host) It asked me for my password, gave me the location of the startup script, ran the programs in the startup folder and gave me the location of my log file(s).
2008-01-14T14:40:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	im not sure what the problem is then sorry
2008-01-14T14:45:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	the error is "Connections refused(111)" - on client.
2008-01-14T14:48:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	you need to figure out what port it is listening on probably
2008-01-14T14:50:00.000Z	portablejim	HashBox	it connected, but I cannot enter anything into the input field.
2008-01-14T15:27:00.000Z	HashBox	portablejim	is gnome installed on the machine?
