2005-10-29T09:34:00.000Z	thunderguy		What's weird is, I have no sound as normal user, I'm in the group 'audio' and root has sound, but I don't have sound hrm.
2005-10-29T09:35:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Turned up the volume?
2005-10-29T09:35:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	Yeah, its up, my testing is that I played an audio cd as root, and played the same cd as user, and it works as root and as user it is entirely muted.
2005-10-29T09:36:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Well, users have their own mixers... Try logging in as the user with no sound and check the mixer settings.
2005-10-29T09:36:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	I am that user, mixer settings are all on full
2005-10-29T09:37:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Odd... Try playing some wav/ogg/mp3 from cmd-line with play/mpg321/ogg321...
2005-10-29T09:37:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	I don't know any files unfortunetly.
2005-10-29T09:38:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	I only have CDA
2005-10-29T09:38:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Just find some wav with google... There are plenty small ones around. :)
2005-10-29T09:39:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Or go to http://krecs.com/html/artists/media.php?interest=12 and grab a track. ;)
2005-10-29T09:39:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Right, /usr/share/sounds :)
2005-10-29T09:41:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	well, apt-get install ogg321 then. :)
2005-10-29T09:41:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	apt-get is locked, but it shouldn't be locked o.O
2005-10-29T09:41:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	'sudo apt-get install vorbis-tools' actually. :)
2005-10-29T09:41:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Got synaptic open somewhere?
2005-10-29T09:42:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	nah, it cleared up though.
2005-10-29T09:42:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	wtf?!? What happened to ogg123?
2005-10-29T09:42:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	no clue
2005-10-29T09:43:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Try 'apt-cache show vorbis-tools'... It _should_ contain ogg123 (?)
2005-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Oh, btw, did you notice '123', not '321' as I said first.
2005-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	thunderguy	madsen	ah, yeah you said 321 earlier, but it has 123
2005-10-29T09:45:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	Ok, what happens when you try to play an ogg with it? ('ogg123 file.ogg')
2005-10-29T09:45:00.000Z	madsen	thunderguy	That's fscked up!
