2009-08-02T16:06:00.000Z	pozic	iceroot	I don't know, but I would search first, and if I realy had to do it, I would do it by hand probably. If I would have to solve it multiple times, I would write a script.

2011-12-19T14:08:00.000Z	iceroot	pozic	also it seems your system is on 10.10 and your sourceslist and a broken update is showing 11.04
2011-12-19T14:09:00.000Z	pozic	iceroot	I am sure it is 11.04.
2011-12-19T14:09:00.000Z	pozic	iceroot	because I ran Unity on it.
2011-12-19T14:09:00.000Z	iceroot	pozic	you want to update from 11.04 to 11.10?
2011-12-19T14:09:00.000Z	pozic	iceroot	yes
2011-12-19T14:12:00.000Z	iceroot	pozic	i would suggest to run "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" and then do the release-update
