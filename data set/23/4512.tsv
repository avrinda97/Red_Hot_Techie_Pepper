2008-01-11T14:10:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	nope it uses what you choose :P
2008-01-11T14:11:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	:P Well so does Ubuntu, but that doesn't really say anything besides "Options exist"
2008-01-11T14:11:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	openSuSe uses KDE or Gnome or Xfce (depends on your install choosing) and has upgrades to style these environments in suse way :)
2008-01-11T14:12:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	 but by default (at install screen) KDE is marked
2008-01-11T14:13:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	ah I see. You seem like a OpenSuse missionary, sent to pull away users. :P
2008-01-11T14:13:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	 rofl hell no xD i dont hate any linux distro all have good and bad things on their own :> after all i just used alot of hehe
2008-01-11T14:14:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	:P Well as a non-hater, would you agree that OpenSuse does 64 bit better? And if so how? Just greater number of 64 bit packages?
2008-01-11T14:14:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	but for me suse is a bit to slow at install of software (yast rpm system with caching of repos every time so slooow) :)
2008-01-11T14:15:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	OOOH yeah, the friend who has it told me Suse creates everything from source so it takes a while to install new things.......I hate waiting but does that mean you can just throw source files at it and watch them install? :D
2008-01-11T14:15:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	no it doesnt do anything better it works simultaneous 32 + 64bit at once same time thats the funny thing hehe :) but 64bit kernel (with 32bit cappability) for more ram support
2008-01-11T14:16:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	well that's what got me. Supposedly (never used it) but Windows 64 bit can run 32 bit things without issue. So the fact that Ubuntu won't (without a massive amount of tweaking/installing) was kind of a let-down.
2008-01-11T14:16:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	nope suse doesnt create everything from source suse has its own package format named .rpm and these cabs have all pre-configured mostly hehe
2008-01-11T14:17:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	 yes thats cause ubuntu is based on debian and debian can only 32 or 64bit at same time as one said to me from the debian team some time back suse can both things but is slower then a bit
2008-01-11T14:18:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	hah slow and steady huh?
2008-01-11T14:18:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	this article explains why I went with 64 bit http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,111508-page,1/article.html
2008-01-11T14:18:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	i dont know what fits to you just try all things and find your best
2008-01-11T14:19:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	64bit is better yes but not standard everywhere today just wait some time soon ubuntu will be 64bit only too when 64bit comes standard :)
2008-01-11T14:20:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	haha that'll be the day. And I'll come back to #ubuntu to giggle at you :P
2008-01-11T14:21:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	why so? i do like 32bit still fine enough for me and my newest notebook supports it and all codecs too so i will stay some time with 32bit
2008-01-11T14:21:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	oh, I didn't have a good point, I just wanted to giggle for the sake of giggling xD
2008-01-11T14:22:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	lol @ randomness xD
2008-01-11T14:22:00.000Z	AdemoS	sven_	I think that's a good sign that I should get some sleep 4:22 AM here
2008-01-11T14:22:00.000Z	sven_	AdemoS	it's 10:22am here :P
