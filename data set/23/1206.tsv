2011-12-18T17:58:00.000Z	theadmin	Giggaflop	From 10.10 to 11.10? No wonder it broke, updates on Ubuntu break *everything*, I wonder how on earth you survived updating from 10.10 to even 11.04
2011-12-18T17:58:00.000Z	Giggaflop		it wasn't me that did it
2011-12-18T17:58:00.000Z	Giggaflop		also, i tried a linux mint lave USB
2011-12-18T17:58:00.000Z	Giggaflop		and that couldn't connect either D:
2011-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	Giggaflop		i figured it was just an update issue
2011-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	theadmin	Giggaflop	Oh, okay then, not the problem with this... Hm.
2011-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	Giggaflop		tbh the systems held up really well dispite the upgrade :P
2011-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	Giggaflop		its really confusing me this one, and i'm not really a noob, i run archlinux myself
2011-12-18T18:00:00.000Z	Giggaflop		if you want more info just ask :3
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop		lol
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop		no
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	theadmin	Giggaflop	Archlinux? Stay with that. Best distro ever.
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop		thats just bad advertising
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop	theadmin	++
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop		but its not for me
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop		it'd for my stepdad :(
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop		and he only just took the linux dive
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	theadmin	Giggaflop	Arch + XFCE + yaourt-gui :P
2011-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	Giggaflop		so arch is a bit too advanced
2011-12-18T18:02:00.000Z	Giggaflop		arch + g3 + yaourt-gui
2011-12-18T18:02:00.000Z	theadmin	Giggaflop	gnome3 is confusing for windows users
