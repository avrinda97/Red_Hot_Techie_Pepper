2009-08-04T17:25:00.000Z	Gothfunc		when i get to the jaunty login screen, i get a kernel panic.  i can go to alt-f1 beforehand and see a load of output ending in "end trace", but i can't find it anywhere in the logs.  where should i be looking?
2009-08-04T17:25:00.000Z	Gothfunc		i can't see the entirety of the output because it's gone off the screen and the machine freezes immediately after outputting
2009-08-04T17:25:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	kernel panic is not always logged, depending on the problem I think
2009-08-04T17:26:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	thanks.  gah.  what the hell am i supposed to do now :/
2009-08-04T17:29:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	do you only get the panic if you start X?
2009-08-04T17:30:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	i can single user fine.  the kernel panic happens up to 2 minutes after the x login screen appears
2009-08-04T17:30:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	does it hang the machine completely?
2009-08-04T17:30:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	pasting this from earlier: i have a hp compaq dx2200, installed jaunty, it was fine until i installed restricted graphics drivers, but now it kernel panics with flashing keyboard lights within 2 minutes of the login screen.  the actual time appears to be random.
2009-08-04T17:31:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	yes
2009-08-04T17:32:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	out of interest, have you tried booting to normal login screen then going ctrl-alt-F1 and doing "sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop"
2009-08-04T17:32:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	by the way, it was still panicking after i replaced the card - i had to install jaunty afresh.  then when i installed the restricted drivers it happened again
2009-08-04T17:32:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	i'll try that now
2009-08-04T17:33:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	would be interesting to see if it crashes then, because a difference between that and single user mode is that although both have no X, you'll still get all the other background services running which you don't in single mode
2009-08-04T17:33:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	perhaps you could also change your video mode in grub to get more text on the console :)
2009-08-04T17:39:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	isn't it enabled by default?
2009-08-04T17:39:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	I forget :)
2009-08-04T17:39:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	i did try sysrq but got nothing
2009-08-04T17:45:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	i can't see any modem ports on the back
2009-08-04T17:47:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	worth seeing if it's enabled first
2009-08-04T17:48:00.000Z	VSpike	Gothfunc	IIRC cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
2009-08-04T17:50:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	found this http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/how-to-diagnose-kernel-panic-cause-538024/ :o
2009-08-04T17:51:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	ah, looks like i can't get the logs to work after all then...
2009-08-04T17:51:00.000Z	Gothfunc	VSpike	i've tried noacpi, and disabling some things in the bios, neither helped
