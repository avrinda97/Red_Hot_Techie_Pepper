2005-12-20T13:30:00.000Z	ejofee		don't i lose anything if i erase those files? what are they for, anyway? ("brenner wants you to know: [...]  gpgerr is a GPG-related error that sometimes occur when accessing the Ubuntu archives; it can usually be solved by typing "sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/*Release*" (without the quotes!) in a terminal")
2005-12-20T13:32:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	iirc, it's apt's cache
2005-12-20T13:39:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	meaning it's not vital?
2005-12-20T13:40:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	*nod* it will probably be regenrated next time you update
2005-12-21T09:04:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	you still getting that error hey?
2005-12-21T09:05:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	yes :(
2005-12-21T09:05:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	and i get warnings in synaptic
2005-12-21T09:06:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	post both the errors and your sources.list file to a pastebin
2005-12-21T09:07:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	any idea what this is ?: "could not download all repository indexes: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz: Sub-process bzip2 returned an error code (2)"
2005-12-21T09:07:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	ohh, i did it here
2005-12-21T09:07:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	M_Cheevy: i mean, isn't that link necessary?
2005-12-21T09:08:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	yes, they're equivalent afaik
2005-12-21T09:17:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5808
2005-12-21T09:18:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	sounds like your sources.list file has something wrong.
2005-12-21T09:18:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	do you have a pastebin link for that?
2005-12-21T09:19:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	this is the content of my sources list: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5809
2005-12-21T09:20:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	i just added everything from ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
2005-12-21T09:21:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	looks like you appended the output to the old one though, instead of *replacing* it.
2005-12-21T09:21:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	you've got multiple entries
2005-12-21T09:22:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	yes... i thought this was not a problem. i thought it was actually good, like having more than one mirror (just in case)...
2005-12-21T09:23:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	apparently not, because that's one of the errors you're getting
2005-12-21T09:24:00.000Z	ejofee	brenner	actually, if i erase content of the default sources file and replace it with the one from source-o-matic (adding everything!) do ai lose *anything*?
2005-12-21T09:30:00.000Z	brenner	ejofee	np.  i think M_Cheevy and nickrud finished it off though :)
