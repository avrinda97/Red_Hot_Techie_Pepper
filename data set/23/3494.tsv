2010-03-13T08:02:00.000Z	stevecam	Emanon	they can be seen by the kernel, but they havn't been assigned
2010-03-13T08:03:00.000Z	Emanon		as long as they can be seen you can assign them in keyboard shortcuts i think
2010-03-13T08:03:00.000Z	stevecam		keyboard shortcuts is nice, but it only does half of the job of setting up my shortcuts, its more of a hotkey manager
2010-03-13T08:04:00.000Z	Emanon		oh they can be seen but havnt been designated (XF86Home etc)
2010-03-13T08:04:00.000Z	Emanon		i got you
2010-03-13T08:04:00.000Z	stevecam		yeah
2010-03-13T08:05:00.000Z	Emanon		so they cant be turned into shortcuts until they have been given a label got ya
2010-03-13T08:05:00.000Z	Emanon		sec i read about this a while back ill find the manual for ya
2010-03-13T08:05:00.000Z	stevecam	Emanon	is there a GUI to do this?
