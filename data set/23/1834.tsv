2010-08-05T21:57:00.000Z	azm		Hi, I have loaded iwl wifi module but cant run master mode with intel wireless
2010-08-05T21:58:00.000Z	azm		I thought this issue is solved for 10.04
2010-08-05T22:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	azm	tried configuring it in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2010-08-05T22:01:00.000Z	azm	ActionParsnip	nope, I did not found wiki page about it. This file now just contains: auto lo and iface lo
2010-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	azm	thats normal, you havent added any config
