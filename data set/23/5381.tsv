2007-04-02T12:30:00.000Z	duffyd		hi, I've followed the brief howto here: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese/Computing_in_Japanese#Ubuntu to enable Japanese support in ubuntu but it hasn't worked :-(
2007-04-02T12:30:00.000Z	duffyd		anyone got any clues on how to get it to work?
2007-04-02T12:31:00.000Z	duffyd		basically, if I hit 'ctrl+space' nothing happens
2007-04-02T12:31:00.000Z	duffyd		I've manually started scim and it's running in the systray

2007-04-02T12:32:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	thanks :-)
2007-04-02T12:32:00.000Z	tombow	duffyd	basically, you just install uim-anthy and they other stuff they mention in that page, and load the uim-anthy applet
2007-04-02T12:32:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	ahh, cool
2007-04-02T12:33:00.000Z	tombow		and perhaps restart gnome if necessary
2007-04-02T12:33:00.000Z	tombow	duffyd	nihonjin desuka

2007-04-02T12:33:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	ima nihon ni iru yo!
2007-04-02T12:34:00.000Z	tombow		lucky bastard :-P
2007-04-02T12:34:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	I'm running kde (i.e. kubuntu) so hopefully there'll be no problems?
2007-04-02T12:34:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	jealousy isn't a nice quality ;-)
2007-04-02T12:35:00.000Z	tombow	duffyd	hmmm.... doesn't KDE have it's own internationalization system? try installing language-pack-kde-ja or something
2007-04-02T12:36:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	I've selected the language support option, which is what's recommended on the website I posted earlier
2007-04-02T12:36:00.000Z	duffyd		it went away and installed a whole lot of stuff, which included kde stuff too iirc
2007-04-02T12:37:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	where are you?
2007-04-02T12:37:00.000Z	tombow		california
2007-04-02T12:37:00.000Z	tombow	duffyd	hmmm, sorry, not sure how it works in kde
2007-04-02T12:38:00.000Z	duffyd	tombow	cool. np, thanks
