2005-03-18T17:44:00.000Z	hyphen		well i just installed wine

2005-03-18T17:45:00.000Z	hyphen		er the wine ~/filename
2005-03-18T17:45:00.000Z	hyphen		it runs alright, then i get a windows blank error msg
2005-03-18T17:45:00.000Z	hyphen		and the installer opens up, but it says "invalid package"
2005-03-18T17:45:00.000Z	hyphen		any clue as to what i'm doing wrong?
2005-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	hyphen		its for maya 6.0
2005-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	hyphen		alias wavefront
2005-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	lunitik	hyphen	have you checked to see whether Maya is supported in Wine? I'd bet money it isn't.
2005-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	hyphen		$ sudo wine /media/cdrom0/maya/setup.exe
2005-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	hyphen	lunitik	the wine website said it was
2005-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	lunitik	hyphen	you realize there is a Linux version of Maya
2005-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	hyphen		it was listed under the apps database
2005-03-18T17:47:00.000Z	hyphen		yeah, but that runs in redhat and i can't find it anywhere :(
2005-03-18T17:47:00.000Z	lunitik	hyphen	what was its level of support?
2005-03-18T17:47:00.000Z	hyphen		not sure
2005-03-18T17:47:00.000Z	hyphen		1 i think
2005-03-18T17:47:00.000Z	hyphen		yeah as much as i love this ubuntu setup, i'm thinking that i'll have to go back to windows
2005-03-18T17:48:00.000Z	hyphen		whats not exclusive?
2005-03-18T17:48:00.000Z	lunitik	hyphen	it doesn't say its supported at all... just is listed.
2005-03-18T17:48:00.000Z	hyphen	lunitik	why would they list if it isn't supported?
2005-03-18T17:48:00.000Z	lunitik	hyphen	because someone wanted feedback usually.
