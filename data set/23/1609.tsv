2010-02-01T03:11:00.000Z	Monotoko		_dreamy...you checked the backports?
2010-02-01T03:11:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	i dont know.. i just want to run a game .. "unknown horizons"
2010-02-01T03:12:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
2010-02-01T03:12:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	ive tryed the older version of that game.. that version wont ask for python 2.6.. but it will ask for  a newer version of libboost
2010-02-01T03:13:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	my system.. whould still be ok.. after ?
2010-02-01T03:13:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	should be...as long as you dont remove 2.5
2010-02-01T03:13:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	ok.. i wonder why it isnt on synaptics
2010-02-01T03:14:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	the hardy repo's are quite old now
2010-02-01T03:14:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	ok..
2010-02-01T03:14:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	the backports are the updated files, so thats the first place to check
2010-02-01T03:15:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	i should be able to only install whats desired.. python 2.6 .. :S =
2010-02-01T03:17:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	ill ad back port to the softwares source.. however.. im afraid it will do alot of new updates.. what do u think ?
2010-02-01T03:18:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	shouldnt do unless you tell it too
2010-02-01T03:18:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	do you think that new software may make my sistem run better ? (faster) ?
2010-02-01T03:19:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	it depends, it can break things....iv googld and found that Python 2.6 isnt in the backports, but i have found this for you: http://www.lysium.de/blog/index.php?/archives/229-Installing-Python-2.6-on-Ubuntu-8.04.html
2010-02-01T03:20:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	i wonder... that new software.. may somehow be related.... with 3d.. may it bring me some better 3d accelaration ?
2010-02-01T03:21:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	you would probably need to upgrade your graphics driver for that rather than software
2010-02-01T03:22:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	dont those updates come too automaticly .. with the Update manager ? .. or whould i do fine..by manualy search .. for an ocasional new driver .. ?
2010-02-01T03:23:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	it depends on what graphics card you have, usually you must find it yourself though
2010-02-01T03:24:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	an m6 ly radeon 7000 32megs..   .. weak mermory .. however it got hyperZ ( more or less like 8 years old card)  hyperZ will compensate on the lack of mermory
2010-02-01T03:25:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	if its that old there are probably no drivers for it, you are p[robably running the VESA driver
2010-02-01T03:26:00.000Z	_dreamy	Monotoko	ithougth the open source driver .. had been automaticly installed with my ubuntu ? u think so ?
2010-02-01T03:26:00.000Z	Monotoko	_dreamy	can i PM you, theres a file im gonna need you to check
