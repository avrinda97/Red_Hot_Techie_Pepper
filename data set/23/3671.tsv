2008-10-30T11:40:00.000Z	locke	jim_p	i had it working fine on the previous system, buti spilt ramen into the motherboard so i'm on a different machine now and i just put the sblive 5.1 card from it into this system
2008-10-30T11:40:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	isnt it loaded with modrobe
2008-10-30T11:40:00.000Z	locke	jim_p	it isnt currently apparently
2008-10-30T11:40:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	can you       sudo modprobe emu10k1
2008-10-30T11:41:00.000Z	locke	jim_p	module not found
2008-10-30T11:42:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	try emu10k1-gp
2008-10-30T11:45:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	lol            sudo modprobe emu10k1-gp                 thet command starting with echo just placed emu10k1 in your /etc/modules
2008-10-30T11:48:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	then it loads the module perfectly
2008-10-30T11:48:00.000Z	locke	jim_p	why would it not be showing up in pref-sound?
2008-10-30T11:51:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	can you reboot or find me another way to make ubuntu see the card? alsaconf wihch is the tool for the job is removed from ubuntu !@#$% while all other distros have it!

2008-10-30T11:54:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	is it inside /etc/modules?
2008-10-30T11:55:00.000Z	jim_p	locke	how did you use alsaconf? it does not even exist in ubuntu!
