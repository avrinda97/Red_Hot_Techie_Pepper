2009-12-24T04:20:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	no
2009-12-24T04:20:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	how is your NIC configured?
2009-12-24T04:21:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	do you use network manager or ifupdown?
2009-12-24T04:21:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	that's network manager. So, it's a dynamic IP address?
2009-12-24T04:22:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	cheap router might be overloaded.
2009-12-24T04:22:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	what does `time host google.com` show? how slow is it really?
2009-12-24T04:23:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	how's its speed compare to just pinging your router?
2009-12-24T04:24:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	is your DNS server the same box as your gateway?
2009-12-24T04:24:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	can you pastebin your /etc/resolv.conf?
2009-12-24T04:24:00.000Z	Zeelot	cellofellow	yea I suppose
2009-12-24T04:25:00.000Z	Zeelot	cellofellow	sync3times the nameserver is wrong I think
2009-12-24T04:25:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	that's odd
2009-12-24T04:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	this resolv.conf file is generated by network-manager according to data it receives from the DHCP server (most likely the router).
2009-12-24T04:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	the router seems to be misconfigured to give 192.168.0.1 instead of 192.168.1.1.
2009-12-24T04:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	Zeelot	so what happens is your system waits for 192.168.0.1 to time out before going to the backup internet server.
