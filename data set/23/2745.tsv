2011-05-07T06:12:00.000Z	FisherP		or fresh install
2011-05-07T06:12:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	did upgrade from 10.04, to 10.10 then 11.04
2011-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	lol, yeah motsly the unity was an issue. on limited screen you don't want something that wouldn't just go away.
2011-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	they said it would autohide in 11.04 but it NEVER loaded.
2011-05-07T06:15:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	nah. I don't really setup auto login.
2011-05-07T06:16:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	10.04 wokrs. so no need to really keep upgrading.
2011-05-07T06:17:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	lol had to reinstall.
2011-05-07T06:17:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	'coz officially downgrading is not supported.
2011-05-07T06:18:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	it has a netbook interface and classes. the netbook interface is like old look. but it works great.
2011-05-07T06:18:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	it has the on desktop application browser thing....
2011-05-07T06:21:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	nah, is it really nice? is that why you ask?
2011-05-07T06:22:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	I just figured 10.04 was working nice, why bother.
2011-05-07T06:25:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	I like the 10.04 way of doing it.
2011-05-07T06:26:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	it's nice to see the app have it's own icon instead of unity trying to do windows 7 things.
2011-05-07T06:30:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	the win 7 I really really like. the kde I like too. I like eyecandy
2011-05-07T06:31:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	lol, that's where you create a system image, and teach them how to restore.
2011-05-07T06:31:00.000Z	B0BBY	FisherP	but if they like kubuntu,that's solving the windows thing.
