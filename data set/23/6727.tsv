2006-01-15T16:43:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	 does it give you that error when you boot, or when the OS is up and stable?
2006-01-15T16:44:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	 just a sec.  I'll go look @ my error logs.
2006-01-15T16:45:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	I think its because your BIOS dosen't like the size of your disk.
2006-01-15T16:45:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	its because grub can't mount the selected partition.  Go run LVM when you partition your diskes
2006-01-15T16:46:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	i have a 250gb hard drive with windows ME on hda1 (130gb) and ybuntu on hda2 (113 gb)
2006-01-15T16:46:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	 so M$ is @ the start of your drive?
2006-01-15T16:47:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	yes
2006-01-15T16:48:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	 Every time I tried to do that, it caused my problems.  If I rember corectly, I had to install M$, resize the partition with partition magic, then toss in the Ubuntu CD.  Once it started to chew on things, I had to make sure that it ignored the M$ partition, installed Grub, and made sure th BIOS could read a disk that large.
2006-01-15T16:49:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	now you have me scared because i dont have a clue how todo that
2006-01-15T16:50:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	 just figure out if your BIOS can handle the large drive (read past the 8Gb mark), then have fun resizing your partition.  Once thats done, then its a peice of cake.
2006-01-15T16:51:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	so how can i find out if my bois can do that?
2006-01-15T16:51:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	i cant get into windows now
2006-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	so do i have to put it n the spot ms is?
2006-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	<rolls eyes>   I don't supose you read how to set up Grub for a M$ partition?
2006-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	ok if i reinstall ubuntu in the first partition will that fix it?
2006-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	 here ya go.  first search artical.  http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=grub+%22dual+boot%22&meta=

2006-01-16T17:01:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	sharn	 open a seprate chat and I'll tell you how to.
2006-01-16T17:07:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	 do you think if i reinstalled ubuntu in front of ms it would work?
2006-01-16T17:07:00.000Z	sharn	Jeeves_Moss	none of the stuff in the terminal works right
