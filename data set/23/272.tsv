2012-08-29T16:39:00.000Z	BebopSteve		Hey guys
2012-08-29T16:39:00.000Z	cfhowlett	BebopSteve	greetings
2012-08-29T16:40:00.000Z	BebopSteve		I'm trying to find a simple way to manipulate the clock in the panel
2012-08-29T16:41:00.000Z	BebopSteve		Move it to the center and make it display the day name, number, month and time
2012-08-29T16:42:00.000Z	BebopSteve		Actually some way to manipulate the panel at all would be nice
2012-08-29T16:44:00.000Z	BebopSteve		Gonna grab a smoke, if anyone knows, please send me a PM?  I don't know how to filter the connects/disconnects with pidgin
2012-08-29T16:51:00.000Z	BebopSteve		google is being so evasive on the subject man
2012-08-29T16:55:00.000Z	BebopSteve		everyone used to love google
2012-08-29T16:55:00.000Z	BebopSteve		now there's this distaste for it it seems
2012-08-29T16:56:00.000Z	BebopSteve		shame chrome is so awesome
2012-08-29T16:56:00.000Z	BebopSteve		I switched back to Fx though
2012-08-29T16:57:00.000Z	BebopSteve	ActionParsnip	I was using duckduckgo while giving mint 13 cinnamon a test drive, in all honesty I was turned off by how loud it was
2012-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	BebopSteve		Too much noise
2012-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	BebopSteve		trying to think of how to explain
2012-08-29T16:59:00.000Z	BebopSteve		yeah, too much on the page
2012-08-29T17:00:00.000Z	BebopSteve		also the logo is ...  call me shallow but it hurts my eyes
2012-08-29T17:01:00.000Z	cfhowlett	BebopSteve	you're shallow - now, do you have any actual ubuntu issues?  Or perhaps it's best to move this convo to #ubuntu-offtopic?  :)
2012-08-29T17:01:00.000Z	BebopSteve		actually I do cfhowlett
2012-08-29T17:01:00.000Z	cfhowlett	BebopSteve	plz ask
2012-08-29T17:01:00.000Z	BebopSteve		I asked a while ago
2012-08-29T17:02:00.000Z	BebopSteve		and the topic kinda shifted because I said I was having a hard time finding the solution through google
2012-08-29T17:02:00.000Z	BebopSteve		then suddenly interesting tangent
2012-08-29T17:03:00.000Z	cfhowlett	BebopSteve	no worries.  Maybe repeat the questions every 15 minutes or so for those of us who didn't see the original post?
