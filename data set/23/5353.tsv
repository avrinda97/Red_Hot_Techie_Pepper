2007-01-03T11:16:00.000Z	fotoflo_		hey does anyone know how to setup vnc so it logs into its own session, rather then hijacking the current desktop session?
2007-01-03T11:17:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	install a vnc server (vncserver, vnc4server or tightvncserver)
2007-01-03T11:17:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	is that different from vino?
2007-01-03T11:18:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	yes, vino only works for the existing desktop session
2007-01-03T11:20:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	no, they use different ports.  vino uses 5900, *vnc*server uses 5901, 5902 ...
2007-01-03T11:25:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	after i install a package (aka tightvncserver) how do i find out where it is?
2007-01-03T11:26:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	yep, dpkg -L, or there is a file list in the package properties in synaptic
2007-01-03T11:30:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	cool i got it working
2007-01-03T11:30:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	great :)
2007-01-03T11:31:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	err but its a blank x terminal without a regular terminal or an ubuntu desktop
2007-01-03T11:32:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	ugh indeed.  That means that it isn't starting things up when the vnc session starts.
2007-01-03T11:33:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	any suggestions?
2007-01-03T11:33:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	maybe ill just stick to vino
2007-01-03T11:33:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	I'm not sure although I can say that the vncserver package seemed to work straight away for me (in Dapper)
2007-01-03T11:34:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	otherwise it's digging into the tightvncserver config, which I don't know much about sorry
2007-01-03T11:35:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	could it because i've already got a vino session open?
2007-01-03T11:35:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	i wouldn't think so, but give that a try (disable via Sys -> Prefs -> Remote Desktop)
2007-01-03T11:36:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	but it appears to be defaulting to desktop 1 instead of 0
2007-01-03T11:37:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	what is? vino?
2007-01-03T11:38:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	no tightvncserver
2007-01-03T11:38:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	yes, that's normal
2007-01-03T11:43:00.000Z	fotoflo_	bimberi	well how do i get a terminal or a menu or something?
2007-01-03T11:43:00.000Z	bimberi	fotoflo_	does right-click work
