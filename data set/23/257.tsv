2012-02-20T13:48:00.000Z	Hubbbe		:(
2012-02-20T13:49:00.000Z	gordon1234	Hubbbe	you have 2 graphics adapters. One on boards and one card. Is that correct? Have you set the BIOS for the new card? Might be a dumb question.
2012-02-20T13:51:00.000Z	Hubbbe		i dont know but i read some where that it might have 2 graphic cards, can i turn one of in bios? and do that help
2012-02-20T13:51:00.000Z	Hubbbe		its a x53s laptop its not like i have built it myself ;)
2012-02-20T13:51:00.000Z	Hubbbe		ok thx will do
2012-02-20T13:52:00.000Z	gordon1234	Hubbbe	I think you have to set the defaul graphics card in the BIOS to use the AGP card, or whatever. Not sure though
2012-02-20T13:52:00.000Z	Hubbbe		laters and thx again
2012-02-20T13:52:00.000Z	Hubbbe		will try t now
2012-02-20T13:53:00.000Z	Hubbbe		ah wait have 2 of the same laptop here can try on the other one :D
2012-02-20T14:00:00.000Z	Hubbbe		Terminhell: i don't have mush to pick in the BIOS this it is "Intel Virtualization Technology" that i should turn to disable?
2012-02-20T14:00:00.000Z	Hubbbe		is it* :P
2012-02-20T14:03:00.000Z	Hubbbe		i only have 5 tabs, main, advanced, boot, security, save & exit... on advanced there is only 9 options.
2012-02-20T14:03:00.000Z	Hubbbe		post logo type, start easy flash, play post sound, internal pointing device, wake on lid open, intel virtualization technology, legacy usb support, SATA configuration
2012-02-20T14:04:00.000Z	Hubbbe		dont look like anyting to turn off one of the graphic cards
2012-02-20T14:04:00.000Z	gordon1234		Hubbe, under Main is there an option for integrated devices or on-board devices?
2012-02-20T14:05:00.000Z	Hubbbe		all i can config under main is date and time
2012-02-20T14:06:00.000Z	gordon1234		Hubbe, how old is the PC?
2012-02-20T14:07:00.000Z	Hubbbe		so my best bet is to return the 2 x53s's & buy somting that have suport?
2012-02-20T14:07:00.000Z	Hubbbe		1day
