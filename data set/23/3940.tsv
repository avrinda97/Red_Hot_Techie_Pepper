2008-01-03T11:37:00.000Z	tjmac		can I make a shortcut for xchat?
2008-01-03T11:37:00.000Z	tjmac		I used add/remove but cant find the app.
2008-01-03T11:38:00.000Z	tjmac		its not under internet
2008-01-03T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	xchat doesn't come by default with ubuntu, you need to install it under add/remove
2008-01-03T11:41:00.000Z	tjmac	nickrud	I have installed it but canot find the program
2008-01-03T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	are you sure you installed it?  which xchat would have said something if it was
2008-01-03T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	ok, applications->accessories->terminal , type    xchat    in there
2008-01-03T11:42:00.000Z	tjmac	nickrud	I have installed it
2008-01-03T11:43:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	don't paste here, just give us an idea about the error
2008-01-03T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	then you didn't install it :)
2008-01-03T11:45:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	type this in a terminal:   apt-cache policy xchat  , and paste that on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-01-03T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	ah!   system->admin->software sources , check the first four items, uncheck the cdrom. Then do the add/remove again
2008-01-03T11:50:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	you said it installed the first time, so  in that terminal type     apt-cache policy xchat    and paste the output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org .
2008-01-03T11:51:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	then you didn't do the     system->admin->software sources   , check the first four items and uncheck the cdrom
2008-01-03T11:52:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	  in the terminal, type:   sudo apt-get update   ,  then try the install again
2008-01-03T11:53:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	you can do the add/remove, or  type:   sudo apt-get install xchat
2008-01-03T11:56:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	click the menu button a couple of times, if it doesn't show up, type:  killall gnome-panel   , then check again after the panel restarts
2008-01-03T11:59:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	click the menu button a couple of times, if it doesn't show up, type:  killall gnome-panel   , then check again after the panel restarts
2008-01-03T12:04:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	if you're running xchat after you installed ubuntu, you have ubuntu installed
2008-01-05T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	tjmac	what does  lspci say about your wireless card? Gotta start there
