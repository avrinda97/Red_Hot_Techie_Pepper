2009-04-02T07:42:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	I just loaded up the 180.44 drivers and they are working excellent.. one of the issues installing them is you have to use synaptic and uninstall all nvidia references listed.. then install the new drivers from a tty with the gui stopped..
2009-04-02T07:43:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	scunizi	hmm, i didn't attempt that
2009-04-02T07:43:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	that is unless you're getting the 180 drivers from midibuntu. In which case you are installing older drivers that might have issues.
2009-04-02T07:44:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	I guess if you're running intrepid you have access to the 180 driver directly from apt-get or synaptic.. no need to install from the terminal.. however if you get the latest drivers direct from nvidia you do.
2009-04-02T07:45:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	scunizi	i do have the medibuntu repo in my sources
2009-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	the 180 drivers in the repos are version 180.11.. those weren't very good.. the latest version is 180.44 and is only available from nvidia.
2009-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	scunizi	is there still the issue that you have to reconfigure the drivers after every kernel update?
2009-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	what kind of card do you have.. nvidia obviously but which one.  Yes you have to reinstall the drivers after every kernel update
2009-04-02T07:47:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	yea.. I'd go directly to nvidia for that card.. you'll notice a big difference..
2009-04-02T07:47:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	scunizi	thanks for the suggestion
2009-04-02T07:48:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_180.44.html
2009-04-02T07:49:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	amd or intel?
2009-04-02T07:50:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html you'll see them on this page with the link
2009-04-02T07:51:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	although they say they are for redhat.. go figure.. maybe it's just a 64 bit thing
2009-04-02T07:51:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	scunizi	i'm not seeing it here: http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_amd64_180.44.html
2009-04-02T07:51:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	actually the amd version is ok.. it's the intel one that mentions only redhat
2009-04-02T07:52:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	look at step 2.. right mouse click the link and save to the desktoop
2009-04-02T07:52:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	it's towards the bottom of the page
2009-04-02T07:57:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	did you get it?
2009-04-02T07:58:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	I've written instructions to install the driver if you want them
2009-04-02T07:58:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	check out http://pastebin.com/m65ddab29
2009-04-02T07:58:00.000Z	scunizi	musikgoat|main	the link will be good for 30 days.. copy them to your machine..
