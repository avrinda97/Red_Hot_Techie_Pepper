2006-06-09T05:00:00.000Z	soundray	rash	error 21 is "selected disk does not exist".
2006-06-09T05:01:00.000Z	soundray	rash	perhaps you used a wrong partition number?
2006-06-09T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	rash	I would first follow the wiki advice on reinstalling grub from the install CD.
2006-06-09T05:06:00.000Z	rash	soundray	is this what i should be look at?
2006-06-09T05:07:00.000Z	soundray	rash	yes
2006-06-09T05:10:00.000Z	rash	soundray	im not sure which section i should look at
2006-06-09T05:10:00.000Z	soundray	rash	do you have an install CD?
2006-06-09T05:11:00.000Z	soundray	rash	breezy or dapper?
2006-06-09T05:12:00.000Z	soundray	rash	yeah, that's dapper. Is it the Desktop or Alternative CD?
2006-06-09T05:13:00.000Z	soundray	rash	try the instructions under "Using the LiveCD and Overwriting the Windows bootloader"
2006-06-09T05:20:00.000Z	rash	soundray	i get up to step 4 then i get error 18
2006-06-09T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	rash	have you changed anything in the BIOS setup recently? LBA options perhaps?
2006-06-09T05:25:00.000Z	rash	soundray	could you please check your PM?
2006-06-09T05:26:00.000Z	soundray	rash	I didn't get a pm. You should ask before you send one, anyway. Are you registered? ::
2006-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	rash	what's the error? Put it on the pastebin if there's a lot of info.
2006-06-09T05:31:00.000Z	rash	soundray	i get error 21, disk not found?
2006-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	soundray	rash	did you see my question about BIOS options?
2006-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	rash	soundray	i havent changed it around. this came up randomly
2006-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	soundray	rash	I bet this is a hardware issue.
2006-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	soundray	rash	if it's a failing disk, reformatting won't help.
