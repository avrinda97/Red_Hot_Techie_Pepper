2009-09-30T16:32:00.000Z	chris8		GG: yuppers all medibunti
2009-09-30T16:33:00.000Z	chris8		GG: reinstall the whole operating system?
2009-09-30T16:33:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	does this happen when you create a new user?
2009-09-30T16:34:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	(as in create a new test user, play sounds. Distortion?)
2009-09-30T16:36:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	nope, sorry! But I can make the reinstall easier ::)
2009-09-30T16:38:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	I can imagine. What you need to do is backup your /home/<username> folder to an external drive. Upon reinstall create a new user with the same name and copy that folder back across (including hidden folders) and you're documents and settings should be preserved
2009-09-30T16:38:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	that and head over to synaptic and get a package list, so you can load that in next install. Or you may want to start fresh
2009-09-30T16:41:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	no, no. You copy across your /home/username folder and a package *list* to your external drive. Then you install jaunty and copy your /home/username folder back into your new install and load up the package list. That way your settings and documents and installed programs will all be saved
2009-09-30T16:42:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	OS reinstalls and OS upgrades are very different
2009-09-30T16:42:00.000Z	chris8	ziroday	so to reinstall i hafta format the harddrive etc...
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	not format, but overwrite. You can format if you want to
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	chris8	ziroday	 can't i just somehow completely reinstall all the audio from jaunty? :(
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	nope
2009-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	chris8	ziroday	what about some hidden setting that i may be overlooking?
2009-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	you'll have to go find that :)
2009-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	chris8	ziroday	is there a special audio help channel?
2009-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	ziroday	chris8	#ubuntu-audio or #ubuntu-sound perhaps
2009-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	chris8	ziroday	 thank you for the hellp :P
