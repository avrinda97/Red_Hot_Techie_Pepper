2011-07-10T20:43:00.000Z	Reighnakj		I need help with the GNOMER Power Manager.  Could anyone help?
2011-07-10T20:44:00.000Z	Reighnakj		At the login screen to log into my desktop I am getting an error that says GNOME Power Manager is not installed right.  I just did sudo get-apt remove gnome-power-manager.
2011-07-10T20:45:00.000Z	Reighnakj		I then did sudo get-apt install gnome-power-manager and it hit a point where it said "/usr/bin/mandb: can't write to /var/cache/man/2394: No space left on device.
2011-07-10T20:45:00.000Z	Reighnakj		Then, it spit out a bunch of stuff and ended with "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1).
2011-07-10T20:45:00.000Z	Reighnakj		"
2011-07-10T20:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	clean up some space on /
2011-07-10T20:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	but you can login into a console
2011-07-10T20:47:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	or not? if not you can just chroot from the livecd
2011-07-10T20:47:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	and then login on the console
2011-07-10T20:47:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	yes.
2011-07-10T20:48:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	it is saying something about a package not being configured.
2011-07-10T20:49:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	yeah it failed to install because of insufficient disk space
2011-07-10T20:49:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	The only thing I installed so far is Wine, Firestarter, and World of Warcraft (10gb)
2011-07-10T20:50:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	thats probably it then
2011-07-10T20:50:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	from the console?
2011-07-10T20:51:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	yeah
2011-07-10T20:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	you do not have a seperate /home partition right? so its probably that wow install in your /home/username thats taking up all the space
2011-07-10T20:54:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	can I move my WoW fold to it's own partition in console?
2011-07-10T20:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	Reighnakj	do you have another partition?
2011-07-10T20:55:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	I used dells recovery partition to reformat my XP then I installed ubuntu using wugi.
2011-07-10T20:56:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	I know I have an icon for WoW on my desktop.  Does that mean, that is where it is located?
2011-07-10T20:56:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	OR is that just a shortcut, like windows.
2011-07-10T20:59:00.000Z	Reighnakj	mgolisch	Nobgul-bnc: Should I rm /home/sfadmin/Desktop/World of Warcraft?
