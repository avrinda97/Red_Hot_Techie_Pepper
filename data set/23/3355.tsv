2009-02-19T20:14:00.000Z	vegombrei		how do i check if my ftp is running ?
2009-02-19T20:15:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	Are you behind a NAT:ed router? Firewall?
2009-02-19T20:22:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	yes a wifi router but my pc is wired in
2009-02-19T20:23:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	Look into port forwarding.
2009-02-19T20:23:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	port forwarding ??
2009-02-19T20:23:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	Yes.
2009-02-19T20:24:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	what are good ftp software for ubuntu ?
2009-02-19T20:24:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	Off the top off my head I'd recommend proftpd.
2009-02-19T20:24:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	could you name some more .. i installed one a few days ago but forgot what it was called
2009-02-19T20:25:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	thing is i donno if its running and how to check .. it worked when i first installed it
2009-02-19T20:25:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	None of them are going to work unless you set up port forwarding... Did you look into it or are you just ignoring that advice? ;)
2009-02-19T20:25:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	googled it but really confused as im a noob
2009-02-19T20:26:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	Basically, access your router and forward an external port to an internal one.
2009-02-19T20:27:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	can i do that by connecting to the router thru my browser ?
2009-02-19T20:27:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	Yes.
2009-02-19T20:28:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	would you like to walk me thru it ?
2009-02-19T20:29:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	No I would not. :P But check out http://portforward.com/
2009-02-19T20:31:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	my netgear router isnt on that list
2009-02-19T20:31:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	I doubt it. What router is it?
2009-02-19T20:32:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	NETGEAR WNR854T
2009-02-19T20:33:00.000Z	burkmat	vegombrei	Alright, well, take a look at some of the other Netgear guides (another WNR perhaps?), and see if they help you out? Quite easy to draw parallels.
2009-02-19T20:34:00.000Z	vegombrei	burkmat	already on it
