2008-05-14T05:57:00.000Z	carlosqueso		Pmantis: try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-05-14T05:57:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	I'm already at 8.04, what will that do?
2008-05-14T05:58:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	it upgrades even if it has to remove packages or install new ones...it's not really a distribution upgrade
2008-05-14T05:59:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	apt-get upgrade only upgrades, it won't install new packages or remove conflicting ones
2008-05-14T06:00:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	you shouldn't have to....just try the apt-get dist-upgrade, and it should work
2008-05-14T06:04:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	Hmmm, I thought it was a dist(ribution)-upgrade
2008-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	it may have once been intended as such...but no...it's much more now
2008-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	did you upgrade from Gutsy?
2008-05-14T06:06:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	No, this was a fresh install a week or so ago.
2008-05-14T06:06:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	k, then that SHOULD solve it, unless you added all kinds of strange repos
2008-05-14T06:08:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	LOL, I'm also confused... I was SSH'd to another box. It's not 8.04 yet. Apparently, openssh-blacklist needed to be installed.
2008-05-14T06:09:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	don't you hate when that happens?  Did the dist-upgrade take care of it?
2008-05-14T06:10:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	So, the dist-upgrade fixed it, thank you. Sorry for being hard headed ... :dist-upgrade" just meant something different to me, and didn't seem like the "right" way to do it, but rather a hack to get around the right way.
2008-05-14T06:11:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	apt is a bit strange until you get used to it....we've all had to learn, glad I could help
2008-05-14T06:12:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	I hate doing things other than the "right way", so when I upgraded my laptop, I did a fresh install - since my dm-crypt was not done the "Ubuntu" way... I did it by hand before the installer supported it.
2008-05-14T06:12:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	good call....doing things in a hacky manner can totally hose your system...take it from someone who learned the hard way
2008-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	It was for that reason that I avoided an upgrade for a year... but had to keep my laptop safe since it has some client data on it. Now that it's installed the "Ubuntu" way, 8.10 should be an easy upgrade.
2008-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	yup...also, another good idea is to have a seperate partition for you /home
2008-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	that way you can upgrade without nuking your data
2008-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	Yeah, true. I just used a 750GB firewire drive to back things up on, wiped it (don't forget dm-crypt) and re-did it all.
2008-05-14T06:18:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	There's a cure for that wish! :)
2008-05-14T06:18:00.000Z	carlosqueso	PMantis	yup...more money than a poor grad student like me has
2008-05-14T06:48:00.000Z	PMantis	carlosqueso	Maybe compiz-fusion-something ?
