2005-09-16T08:29:00.000Z	NiLz		what fonts do I need to install to get proper cyrillic support in ubuntu?
2005-09-16T08:30:00.000Z	NiLz		+ I want the font "Fixed"
2005-09-16T08:30:00.000Z	NiLz		what packages do I need?
2005-09-16T08:30:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	you have the font "fixed"
2005-09-16T08:32:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	do I? how come it's not listed in the settings of gnome-terminal?
2005-09-16T08:33:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	because gnome-terminal doesn't know or care.  edit /etc/fonts/local.conf if you think it should
2005-09-16T08:35:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	I already have the autohinter module enabled
2005-09-16T08:36:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	where did I say anyting about that?
2005-09-16T08:36:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	you configure font paths there
2005-09-16T08:37:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	should I search for the paths myself? :)
2005-09-16T08:37:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	yes
2005-09-16T08:38:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	is there a sample of a font config file somewhere
2005-09-16T08:38:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	working one
2005-09-16T08:38:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	yes, yo ualready have it
2005-09-16T08:39:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	your question isn't "How do I make X know about any fonts at all?", your question is "How do I make fontconfig apps know about random bitmap fonts?"
2005-09-16T08:39:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	read the file, the section you need is commented out
2005-09-16T08:39:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	ok, thanks
2005-09-16T08:41:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	thanks for your help
2005-09-23T09:49:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	is xscreensaver running?
2005-09-23T09:49:00.000Z	NiLz	bob2	nope
2005-09-23T09:50:00.000Z	bob2	NiLz	then run it...
