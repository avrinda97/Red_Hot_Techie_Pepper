2005-05-06T11:57:00.000Z	kev0r		Why is this command skipping all the files in the Archives?
2005-05-06T11:57:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	you dont do *
2005-05-06T11:57:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	you pass it the first .rar file
2005-05-06T11:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	by doing that, what happens is it expands out to multiple file names and tries to find Archive_nr_101.rar in Archive_nr_100.rar
2005-05-06T11:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	Yes, I know
2005-05-06T11:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	still, pass it the first .rar
2005-05-06T11:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	it gets the stuff out of the rest automatically
2005-05-06T11:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	are you *sure*? if so, then you have to do them indivudally, a hack to do this for be for i in Archive_nr_*.rar; do unrar x $i; done
2005-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	kev0r	Lathiat	hmm ok i'll try htanks
2005-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	kev0r	Lathiat	still skipping the files
2005-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	kev0r	Lathiat	what did you meant with that hack, what do i have to type?
2005-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	exactly what i gave you
2005-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	basically, unrar doesnt accept multiple files to urnar
2005-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	you have to do the spearatelly
2005-05-06T12:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	The command i gave you will do that magically
2005-05-06T12:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	'for i in Archive_nr_*.rar; do unrar x $i; done' <-- type that into a terminal
2005-05-06T12:46:00.000Z	kev0r	Lathiat	The problem was unrar doesn't make directories...
2005-05-06T12:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	really? interesting
2005-05-06T12:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	kev0r	i'll remember that :)
