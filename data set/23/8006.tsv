2006-08-25T06:08:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	to quote a few famous people: "I came for the quality, and I stayed for the freedom"
2006-08-25T06:10:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	let me turn the question around: does windows have *any* advantage over linux?
2006-08-25T06:10:00.000Z	tjb	Seveas	i don't know much about linux
2006-08-25T06:11:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	then I suggest that you download the Ubuntu desktop CD -- it lets you play with Ubuntu withous installing
2006-08-25T06:12:00.000Z	tjb	Seveas	does it write to the hard disk?
2006-08-25T06:12:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	no
2006-08-25T06:12:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	you *can* install with it, but you don't have to
2006-08-25T06:14:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	contrary to windows, linux has improved a lot in the past few years
2006-08-25T06:17:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	that thing works under linux too
2006-08-25T06:19:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	there's a catch-22 there: gaming support will improve if linux becomes more popular and vice versa
2006-08-25T06:20:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	it means more work, but not much if they write their code properly
2006-08-25T06:21:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	no
2006-08-25T06:25:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	Ubuntu is by default more secure than windows -- you can still make your system insecure as hell though 
2006-08-25T06:25:00.000Z	tjb	Seveas	yeah
2006-08-25T06:25:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	no
2006-08-25T06:25:00.000Z	tjb	Seveas	i have no CD burner =(
2006-08-25T06:25:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	http://shipit.ubuntu.com -- they'll send it to you for free
2006-08-25T06:26:00.000Z	tjb	Seveas	wow
2006-08-25T06:26:00.000Z	tjb	Seveas	doesn't it cost them?
2006-08-25T06:26:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	it costs them a lot, but there's a billionaire space tourist backing us ;)
2006-08-25T06:27:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	http://markshuttleworth.com
2006-08-25T06:29:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	ubuntu has it's own logo 
2006-08-25T06:33:00.000Z	Seveas	tjb	probably more than one
