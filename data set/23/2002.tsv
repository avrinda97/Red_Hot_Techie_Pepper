2009-08-04T02:57:00.000Z	krisives		How can I get the source to a package that's in the repository?
2009-08-04T02:58:00.000Z	krisives		Thank you so much Flannel
2009-08-04T02:58:00.000Z	krisives		In the current directory it looks like ;)
2009-08-04T02:59:00.000Z	krisives		I can do this as non-root too?
2009-08-04T03:01:00.000Z	krisives		Are packages supposed to have the -dev requirements in their dependencies? I just did apt-get source nautilus-open-terminal and ./configure but it's missing some -dev libraries
2009-08-04T03:02:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	so install the libs it tells you that are missing
2009-08-04T03:02:00.000Z	krisives	mrwes	I will, but is it not possible to have these installed for me with apt-get source?
2009-08-04T03:03:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	apt-get source does not grab all the dependencies like apt-get install
2009-08-04T03:04:00.000Z	krisives	mrwes	Thanks, I guess I can manually install the deps
2009-08-04T03:04:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	you might also look into checkinstall if you are installing from the source
2009-08-04T03:04:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall
2009-08-04T03:05:00.000Z	krisives	mrwes	Yeah, I know about CheckInstall, but it fails a lot on me. Do most packages have a make deb?
2009-08-04T03:06:00.000Z	krisives	mrwes	How long does it take for a patch I make to hit a repo? A lot of people complain about bugs, and I would like to fix them more often and not send out .debs to them.
2009-08-04T03:08:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	subscribe to the bug at launchpad and you can keep yourself informed on the status and potential workarounds for bugs
2009-08-04T03:08:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	of course it all depends on the severity of the bug :)
2009-08-04T03:08:00.000Z	krisives	mrwes	I am an experienced developer, just not familar with Ubuntu
2009-08-04T03:09:00.000Z	krisives	mrwes	I am more interested in fixing the bugs than reporting them
2009-08-04T03:09:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	you could run the beta version of the next version due out in October -- code named Karmic Koala, join #ubuntu+1
2009-08-04T03:10:00.000Z	krisives	mrwes	How do most makefiles do creating debs? Or do they rely on checkinstall mostly
2009-08-04T03:11:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	I never used a makefile to create a .deb; however I have used subversion to compile the latest and greatest of a few apps I choose
2009-08-04T03:12:00.000Z	mrwes	krisives	#ubuntu+1
