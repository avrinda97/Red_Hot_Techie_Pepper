2006-04-11T09:06:00.000Z	Khaaaaan		hey guys.... I can't read anything on my CD drive in Xubuntu...
2006-04-11T09:06:00.000Z	Khaaaaan		What could be up??
2006-04-11T09:06:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	id it mounted ?
2006-04-11T09:08:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	in xubuntu for stuff to be mounted automatically you must install ivman
2006-04-11T09:09:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	how do I do that
2006-04-11T09:09:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	use synaptic
2006-04-11T09:09:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	or just apt-get install ivman
2006-04-11T09:11:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	I am going to reboot now, I will let you know how it goes :)
2006-04-11T09:30:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	didn't ivman work ?
2006-04-11T09:30:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	naw ... dunno what the hay is going on :(
2006-04-11T09:31:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	what problem you have now ?
2006-04-11T09:31:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	still no CD ROM, but that is okay, I am will go back to Ubuntu... that detects it fine :)
2006-04-11T09:32:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	did you launch ivman
2006-04-11T09:32:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	launch it?
2006-04-11T09:32:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	type ivman in a terminal and put a cd
2006-04-11T09:32:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	then goto /media/cdrom
2006-04-11T09:33:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	it appears to be creating "default files" for me
2006-04-11T09:33:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	ivman ?
2006-04-11T09:34:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	yes
2006-04-11T09:34:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	i think it will stay launched
2006-04-11T09:34:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	i mean just let it working in its terminal and put a cd in the drive
2006-04-11T09:34:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	reda_ea	it is just the terminal stilll
2006-04-11T09:35:00.000Z	reda_ea	Khaaaaan	then open /media/cdrom with your file manager
