2007-05-27T08:05:00.000Z	Hadron		anyone know if there is a utility to install the nvidia settings utility into the menus correctly?
2007-05-27T08:06:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	I believe you need to use the driver from NVIDIA
2007-05-27T08:06:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	from nvidia.com
2007-05-27T08:06:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	I do. On Feisty and there is no utility on the system menu.
2007-05-27T08:07:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	You installed the one from nvidia.com then
2007-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	aha I see. No I used the new "restricted driver" settings which supposedly are the nvidia ones.
2007-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	I am loath to fiddle with them now they are working.
2007-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	That is correct, but only the drivers from nvidia.com install the configuration utility in the menu
2007-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	that sucks. Half a job done :(
2007-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	It's a really, really simple procedure
2007-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	I'll guide you through it if you want me to
2007-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	I know I can run nvidia-settings from the command line so all is not lost.
2007-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	well
2007-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	you can create a menu item for it
2007-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	ok. lets do that.
2007-05-27T08:11:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	for the icon, choose /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/nvidia-settings.png if it exists
2007-05-27T08:11:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	see above
2007-05-27T08:12:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	Are you following so far?
2007-05-27T08:14:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	not sticking?
2007-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	dont apepar for some reason in the menu editor after I confirm closure of the new menu-item dialog. This might be linked to a bug in gnome wher eI cant change the date and time either from the clock applet.
2007-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	huh O.o
2007-05-27T08:15:00.000Z	Hadron	MenZa	thanks for your time, but its ok. Maybe I just try to install the nvidia drivers anyway.
2007-05-27T08:16:00.000Z	MenZa	Hadron	hmm, it sounds odd if you can't create a launcher
