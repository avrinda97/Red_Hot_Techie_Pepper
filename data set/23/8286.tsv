2004-12-19T12:54:00.000Z	nuOpus		its just a changelog and a readme
2004-12-19T12:54:00.000Z	nuOpus		but ... have you EVER read the changelog?

2004-12-19T12:56:00.000Z	nuOpus		but once they are already there ... you dont need them
2004-12-19T12:56:00.000Z	nuOpus		single bin
2004-12-19T12:56:00.000Z	nuOpus		the-bummibear: You WILL have to resolve build-time dependencies
2004-12-19T12:57:00.000Z	nuOpus		I can build you a deb if you want
2004-12-19T12:57:00.000Z	nuOpus		I was thinking of compiling the latest rhytm
2004-12-19T12:57:00.000Z	Kamion	nuOpus	deb-make is so obsolete it's not funny. please don't use it
2004-12-19T12:57:00.000Z	Kamion	nuOpus	the current debmake package deletes it entirely to discourage its use
2004-12-19T12:57:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	I have been using paco lately
2004-12-19T12:58:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	What do you think of paco to keep track of built software?
2004-12-19T13:01:00.000Z	Kamion	nuOpus	never used it
2004-12-19T13:02:00.000Z	Kamion	nuOpus	sounds like a not-invented-here reimplementation of GNU stow
2004-12-19T13:02:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	Its great software! yes ... but it has a GTK frontend! lol
2004-12-19T13:03:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	example paco usage ... ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && paco -lp gaim-1.1.0 "make install"
2004-12-19T13:04:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	Ya ... used to do that until I got lazy with the copying the .desktop files to the proper place
2004-12-19T13:05:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	To each his own I guess
2004-12-19T13:06:00.000Z	Kamion	nuOpus	uh ... if I package it, I don't need to copy them; debian/rules does that for me. :)
2004-12-19T13:06:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	point taken. I guess I need to learn more about packaging software in debian
2004-12-19T13:06:00.000Z	nuOpus	Kamion	I came from Gentoo world
