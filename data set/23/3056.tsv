2010-05-11T00:49:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	sure, all my efforts? I mean, I can pastebin the build errors right now .. or I can go back to square one and log all the output -- your choice (choose option#1!!)
2010-05-11T00:50:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	lets start with the build errors please :-)
2010-05-11T00:51:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	thank you :) http://pastebin.org/218764
2010-05-11T00:53:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	I believe that ./configure was maybe not completely pleased with your setup
2010-05-11T00:53:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	I'll rerun it
2010-05-11T00:57:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	the package from the instructions I was following on the ubuntu server doesnt come with configure :D
2010-05-11T00:58:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	did it come with a file README and/or INSTALL ?  they might help
2010-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	yes .. I'm on the first stepin the INSTALL -- "make"
2010-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	what tutorial are you following?
2010-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	let me find it, just a minute
2010-05-11T01:01:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	this is the thread .. I'll piece things together for you if you want http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=606487
2010-05-11T01:02:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	one problem I see immediately: the thread is about 2 years old - so some structure might have changed
2010-05-11T01:02:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9161699&postcount=87 -- this post is the key
2010-05-11T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	did you install the "kernel header package" ?
2010-05-11T01:03:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	that's the version of the build I'm following -- report of success, 2 weeks old
2010-05-11T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	you will still need the kernel headers
2010-05-11T01:04:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	"linux-headers-2.6.32.21 and the uname version of the same, yes
2010-05-11T01:05:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	let me look it over again
2010-05-11T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	roberto_	sorry - I don't get it either -- if it weren't for the success report I'd say the author made some error - you did read the "how to patch" link?
2010-05-11T01:16:00.000Z	roberto_	guntbert	like it was an ancient mayan tablet ;)
