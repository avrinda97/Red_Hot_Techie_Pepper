2005-02-25T15:41:00.000Z	Jelte		does ubuntu allow for a network install?
2005-02-25T15:41:00.000Z	Jelte		rather than from cd?
2005-02-25T15:41:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	yes
2005-02-25T15:41:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	how do i do that?
2005-02-25T15:41:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	get the netinstall kernel and boot it
2005-02-25T15:42:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	thanks... should i be able to find a netinstall kernel image on ubuntu's site?
2005-02-25T15:43:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	trying to find where I got it from
2005-02-25T15:45:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	I think I might gave got it off the cd
2005-02-25T15:45:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	how d'you do that? ;-)
2005-02-25T15:48:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	I cant even find my cd now....
2005-02-25T15:48:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	hehe... but did you end up with a debian system, or ubuntu?
2005-02-25T15:48:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	Ubuntu
2005-02-25T15:48:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	hmm interesting
2005-02-25T15:49:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	I have no cd rom in my laptop so I ended up booting the net install kernel from my existing Fedora grub and it installed a full warty system
2005-02-25T15:52:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	I got the net install kernel (still trying to find where), booted my existing fedora install on the laptop. manualy edited /boot/grub/menu.lst to have an entry for the ubuntu net install kernel I had downloaded, rebooted and away whent the net install
2005-02-25T15:54:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	ah, the netinstall kernel will continue to install once its booted?
2005-02-25T15:54:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	?
2005-02-25T15:56:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	never mind; i'm babbling ;-)   if you find out where that netinstall was that would be good... in the mean time it looks like a problem others have as well:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=10423&page=2&pp=10
2005-02-25T15:59:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	so you have an existing linux install?
2005-02-25T16:00:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	here you go found it ftp://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/
2005-02-25T16:02:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	excellent, thanks... no i dont have an existing linux install at the moment ;-(   i only have winxp on the first partition, and trying to get ubuntu on the second
2005-02-25T16:14:00.000Z	Jelte	pybe	looks like i might have fixed the install problem....  using just one partition and making sure the ubuntu installer formats that partition prior to install seems to work (fingers crossed, just at 60% now)
2005-02-25T16:15:00.000Z	pybe	Jelte	great
