2010-09-30T07:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	do you have a secound computer?  maybe you can pxe boot and fix your problem http://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/05/how-to-install-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx-without-cd-usb-via-the-internet/
2010-09-30T07:13:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	no :s
2010-09-30T07:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	pxe boot is boot from lan,  but if you don't have a secound computer to setup as a boot server then it's mute point.
2010-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	maybe you will just have to buy another hard disk.  you can buy secound hand disks cheap here.  like $20 for 40 gb
2010-09-30T07:18:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	why ?! It's not a problem of hard disk !
2010-09-30T07:20:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	it's USB drive that's is not supported not hard drive
2010-09-30T07:22:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	because I need a fresh Live image
2010-09-30T07:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	is that a yes you need to boot from usb drive?
2010-09-30T07:23:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	is that a yes ?! What do you mean ?
2010-09-30T07:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	you can boot from your internal disk then?  but after boot you can't read the external usb drive?
2010-09-30T07:25:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	I can't because I got a bug on my Ubuntu since someone on this channel tried to help it finally erase my .Private folder then ecryptfs can decrypt my session
2010-09-30T07:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	well that's were the $20 used disk would be usefull then.  so you could have install a working copy of ubuntu there so you have a cd that you could burn a new copy.  or use a spare partition on your present 1T disk and install a new clean 2nd working copy of ubuntu?
2010-09-30T07:30:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	if I install on one of my other CD I'll got to grub
2010-09-30T07:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	well if your afraid to work with the disks that have your valued data best to us a $20 disk to try without fear.
2010-09-30T07:32:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	I don't need too !
2010-09-30T07:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	then what do you need to do?
2010-09-30T07:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	well how are you going to burn a cd if it is the only way you can boot?
2010-09-30T07:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	what's so hard about grub?
2010-09-30T07:35:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	when I've 2 grubs it can overloads which one other
2010-09-30T07:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	the encrypt thing you will have to fix after you have a working ubuntu running on something other that your livecd
2010-09-30T07:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	at this point I guess that's what I would do.  stick an old hard disk in pull out or don't mount your present disks.  install ubuntu you have on the old disk, burn a new cd with what you want on it.  move on
2010-09-30T07:38:00.000Z	DarkRedman	sacarlson	I gonna try, see you soon I hope ;)
2010-09-30T07:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	DarkRedman	good luck
