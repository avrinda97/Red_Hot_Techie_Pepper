2009-06-27T01:54:00.000Z	nexsja		how much space should i give Ubuntu on a partition?
2009-06-27T01:54:00.000Z	nexsja		Will, say, 60Gb be enough?
2009-06-27T01:55:00.000Z	nexsja		oh, and what does 'Mount point' mean?
2009-06-27T01:56:00.000Z	nexsja		just install it and it's okay
2009-06-27T01:56:00.000Z	nexsja		so, anyone? What does 'Mount point' mean?
2009-06-27T01:57:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	you're currently installing and on the partition manager?
2009-06-27T01:58:00.000Z	nexsja	arkanabar	yup
2009-06-27T01:58:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	you will have to have a partition with the mount point /
2009-06-27T01:58:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	all other mount points are optional, but I think a separate partition for mountpoint /home is a good idea
2009-06-27T01:59:00.000Z	nexsja	arkanabar	so the one with the OS on it has to be have mount point "/", right?
2009-06-27T01:59:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	yes
2009-06-27T01:59:00.000Z	nexsja	arkanabar	okay, and what will a mount point "/home" will do for me?
2009-06-27T02:00:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	a "/home" partition is a good idea though
2009-06-27T02:00:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	it means you can have all your files on a second partiton that you do not have to format when you install a new distro
2009-06-27T02:00:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	you should expect to install a new one every 6/12/18 months
2009-06-27T02:01:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	yes, it will
2009-06-27T02:02:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	10GB will probably be enough.
2009-06-27T02:02:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	are you planning on developing software?
2009-06-27T02:02:00.000Z	nexsja	arkanabar	i'm planing on playing/working/building websites
2009-06-27T02:03:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	the minimum is 5gb for root+home on one partition
2009-06-27T02:04:00.000Z	nexsja	arkanabar	okay, i've splitted it into 3 partitions: 20Gb for "/", 10Gb for "/var/www" - since that'll be my workspace, and everything else for /home/
2009-06-27T02:05:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	set it up however you like.  you probably know your needs better than I.
2009-06-27T02:10:00.000Z	arkanabar	nexsja	logical partitions always reside within an extended-type primary partition.
