2009-04-10T02:39:00.000Z	otm		does anyone know how I could set up my home computer as a proxy so I can connect through it at uni?
2009-04-10T02:40:00.000Z	usr13	otm	squid
2009-04-10T02:41:00.000Z	otm	usr13	is it graphical or through terminal?
2009-04-10T02:41:00.000Z	usr13	otm	terminal
2009-04-10T02:42:00.000Z	usr13	otm	You might consider a stand alone firewall, like IPcop.  See ipcop.org
2009-04-10T02:43:00.000Z	otm	usr13	okay thanks
2009-04-10T02:43:00.000Z	usr13	otm	I use IPcop
2009-04-10T02:46:00.000Z	usr13	otm	YOu might look into  tinyproxy
2009-04-10T02:46:00.000Z	usr13	otm	and firestarter
2009-04-10T02:46:00.000Z	usr13	otm	Or just squid and firestarter.  I've not done it, but maybe you can (without getting your hands dirty).
2009-04-10T02:47:00.000Z	otm	usr13	I have firestarter, it's impressive
2009-04-10T02:47:00.000Z	usr13	otm	In other words, I don't know.
2009-04-10T02:48:00.000Z	usr13	otm	I'm supposing your network is mixed, right?  If so, what are you accessing with this machine?  An internet connection?
2009-04-10T02:50:00.000Z	otm	usr13	I'd like to be able to use irc and http i suppose
2009-04-10T02:53:00.000Z	usr13	otm	You don't need a proxy to use irc and http. Am I missing something?
2009-04-10T02:55:00.000Z	otm	usr13	well my school network restricts http and probably blocks the irc ports
2009-04-10T03:04:00.000Z	otm	usr13	i have some config files lurking around in /etc that keep messing up my installation of squid, is it safe to delete them
2009-04-10T03:05:00.000Z	usr13	otm	Not sure.  What files?
2009-04-10T03:05:00.000Z	otm	usr13	actually it's just 'a' config file and it's in /etc/squid
2009-04-10T03:05:00.000Z	usr13	otm	Has squid been installed before?
2009-04-10T03:06:00.000Z	otm	usr13	yep and i think i screwed it up
2009-04-10T03:06:00.000Z	usr13	otm	Well, might be just as easy to fix what you have.
2009-04-10T03:07:00.000Z	usr13	otm	But you could uninstall squid and see what is left. If anything is still there, remove it and start over, install fresh.  e.g. rm -rf /etc/squid
