2006-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	cobelloy		wether I want to use it or not it should work
2006-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	pastebin the script so we can see what it does please
2006-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	I mean the source, so we can read it
2006-05-05T12:05:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	should be in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/
2006-05-05T12:07:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	yes
2006-05-05T12:07:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-05-05T12:07:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	does synaptic work?
2006-05-05T12:08:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	well you need to either paste the command that the root terminal shortcut uses or pastebin the source of the nautilus script.  otheriwse, it is pretty hard to help
2006-05-05T12:09:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	do you have the menu editor?
2006-05-05T12:18:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	smeg should be in hoary-backports.  But the easiest method is dragging the shortcut to your desktop and right clicking > properties
2006-05-05T12:21:00.000Z	cobelloy	_jason	the launcher says this: gksudo /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator
2006-05-05T12:21:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	now type that in a terminal and see what output you get
2006-05-05T12:22:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	you should be happy, not argh'ing
2006-05-05T12:23:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	are you positive you were typing the password ok?
2006-05-05T12:24:00.000Z	_jason	cobelloy	strange, don't know what would cause that.  If it happens again, remember to do that command in a regular terminal and look at the output
