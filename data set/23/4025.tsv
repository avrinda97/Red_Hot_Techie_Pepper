2007-12-02T19:48:00.000Z	kljb		Hey, since my Update to Gutsy my Skype isnt working anymore, hopefully someone can help me. Here are some Infos about my System: http://ubuntuusers.de/paste/17909/
2007-12-02T19:49:00.000Z	bofh80	kljb	what version of skype are you running? and have you tried installing the latest?
2007-12-02T19:51:00.000Z	kljb	bofh80	i am running Skype 1.4, which worked under Feisty. I tested Skype 2.0 Beta, same Error. Soundcard seems to be blockaded, on the other hand, http://ubuntuusers.de/paste/17909/ doesnt say so
2007-12-02T19:51:00.000Z	kljb		Btw, Ekiga doesnt run on that souncard, too
2007-12-02T19:52:00.000Z	bofh80	kljb	cool. i take it you checked the sound device options in sype itself?
