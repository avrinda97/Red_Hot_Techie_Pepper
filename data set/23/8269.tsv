2004-11-23T10:52:00.000Z	bratsche		We keep getting all these non-1.0 updates for Firefox.
2004-11-23T10:53:00.000Z	bratsche		All these 0.99+PR1.0 versions are really broken on amd64.  That's why I want the 1.0 release.
2004-11-23T10:54:00.000Z	bratsche		I've been told that 1.0 doesn't have all these amd64 crashers.
2004-11-23T10:54:00.000Z	bratsche		I guess I could just install from tarball and find out.
2004-11-23T10:56:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	we support three architectures, not just two ... :)
2004-11-29T10:25:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	probably the xlibs-static-dev split-out
2004-11-29T10:23:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	known, being fixed
2004-11-29T10:24:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	Okay, thanks.
2004-11-29T10:25:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	Does your Xorg have xf86vmode.h installed?  I think that should still be included, but it's not on my system.
2004-11-29T10:27:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	did you turn off the non-UTF-8 locales?
2004-11-29T10:28:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	I don't know.  When I first installed Ubuntu, my locale stuff was broken.  When I run Synaptic or whatever then I get lots of complaining.
2004-11-29T10:28:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	Right now when I installed the libxxf86vm-dev I got complaining again and something about en.ISO-8859-1 but I have no idea where that's configured.
2004-11-29T10:29:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	your $LANG must be something listed in /etc/locale.gen (written by 'dpkg-reconfigure locales')
2004-11-29T10:30:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	type 'locale | head -n 1' for me?
2004-11-29T10:30:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	LANG=C
2004-11-29T10:30:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	I set that manually because I didn't know what else to do.  I Just looked through locale.gen and found en_US.UTF-8 listed so I'll try that.
2004-11-29T10:31:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	um, OK, look for anything in the output of 'locale' that isn't C
2004-11-29T10:31:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	Everything says "C" except LC_ALL has no value.
2004-11-29T10:38:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	en.UTF-8 is invalid
2004-11-29T10:38:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	en_US.UTF-8; the _US is important
2005-01-09T16:55:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	--install not install
2005-01-10T17:02:00.000Z	bratsche	Kamion	You don't use nvidia-glx do you?
2005-01-10T17:04:00.000Z	Kamion	bratsche	no, sorry
