2010-04-15T21:44:00.000Z	mgj		find all .tex files in the folder (and sub-folders). Use them as input to aspell in order to spell check them
2010-04-15T21:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	find . -name '*.tex' -exec aspell -t '{}' \;
2010-04-15T21:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	man find
2010-04-15T21:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	http://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind is as good as it can get
2010-04-15T21:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	\; is for contructing the command line. just like in a copmmand promt you will do « aspell file1 ; aspell file2 ; .... » you put the \ to scape the ; to the shell
2010-04-15T21:52:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	ok. Thanks for explaining
2010-04-15T21:58:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	or pixil, hmm "find" finds all my tex files correctly, however something is wrong with the aspell part. I get an error for each tex file, "unknown action" ?
2010-04-15T21:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	check aspell man page maybe it does not accept the -t option ?
2010-04-15T21:59:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	it should, simply "aspell -t texfile.tex" works. The -t modifier is to tell aspell that it is dealing with tex/latex
2010-04-15T22:00:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	actually im an idiot, hang on
2010-04-15T22:02:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	nevermind, it works.
2010-08-02T15:58:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	from what i can tell, pstools is for windows clients only
2010-08-02T15:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	use ssh
2010-08-02T15:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	and the normal tools on the remote machine
2010-08-02T16:01:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	Hmm. Is it possible to automaticly execute commands after logging in with ssh? I know you can add user/pass to the commandline, but there is noone physicly present at the client. Need to be able to do everything from the "server" automaticly
2010-08-02T16:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	then why not set up something in the server itself ? a cron job ? anywhy when you login shell init scripts are executed ~/.profile for example
2010-08-02T16:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	but still do not know exactly what you want to do or exactly when ....
2010-08-02T16:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	mgj	maybe if you explain exactly how you used that psexec command we can advise better
2010-08-02T16:05:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	set up something on the server? I'm not following you. Basicly what i need is this: Im physically at the server. I need to be able make an application, which can launch applications on the clients. I dont think init scripts are a good solution, as i only want the applications to be spawned when the server says so. Also, i need to be able to, from the server, to select what commands are being run on the client.
2010-08-02T16:05:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	hope that is a bit more clear, dont hesitate to ask if its not
2010-08-02T16:07:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	will take a look, thanks!
2010-08-02T16:17:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	sorry to bother you again. clusterssh looks pretty cool, but it suffers from the same problem as normal ssh: It requires manual input for actually running the commands. I need something i can program against. Something like: User clicks on Button1: Start command1 on client1. Not sure if this question is more suited for a programming channel, but its fairly linux specific (ubuntu server and clients) so i figured i'd give it a try i
2010-08-27T15:37:00.000Z	mgj	erUSUL	thanks
