2008-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	aexis		anybody know about some driver for a SD card reader?
2008-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 you are refering to a sd card reader built into a laptop?
2008-01-15T07:38:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	nope, it's a weird mp3 but it's only a card reader
2008-01-15T07:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 hmm it should show up as a scsi drive then.. but who knows what some of these comanies are doing these days
2008-01-15T07:39:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	it's from HAma, but it's not shown at all
2008-01-15T07:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 check dmesg output. it may be just too weird, or it might have some mode it needs to be in.
2008-01-15T07:39:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	how the heck am i supposed to do that?
2008-01-15T07:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 the 'dmesg' command, when befor and after yopu plug it in
2008-01-15T07:41:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	i never used any command to plug it in or out, i jst did it...as it never shoiwn as any "loaded disk", i never used any command at all
2008-01-15T07:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 the DMESG command shows all sorts of system messages.. run dmesg, plug it in.. run dmesg again.. LOOK at the messages at the end.
2008-01-15T07:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 its a basic trouble shooting command. :)
2008-01-15T07:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 if its seen but linux dont know what to do with it.. dmesg should have some sort of info messages
2008-01-15T07:43:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	as before, i tried to cxlick on dmesg, and the decibel music player was opened
2008-01-15T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 its a SHELL command.
2008-01-15T07:44:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	so it's not the dmseg that's located in the usr/bin?
2008-01-15T07:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 open up a terminal, remove the gizmo, type 'dmesg' hit enter...  plug it in.. type in dmesg again.... (hit enter again) look at the end of the output befor and after for differetn messages
2008-01-15T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 one normally does not just 'click to run'   most commands in /bin and /usr/bin :)
2008-01-15T07:46:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	i see.....why not? (i know you'll curse for this one, sorry)
2008-01-15T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 bvecause most of them are shell commands with no gui.
2008-01-15T07:51:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	done it, i got a long list of absolute giberish
2008-01-15T07:57:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	???
2008-01-15T08:01:00.000Z	aexis	Dr_willis	what do i do  nwo that iran dmesg and i got different messages in the giberish?
2008-01-15T08:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aexis	 now at least you have some actual Information about the device. Good luck with getting it working.  I gotta run to work.
