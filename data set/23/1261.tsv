2010-06-10T03:01:00.000Z	abstrakt		the built in dell wifi uses the restricted drivers and they're not compatible with RT
2010-06-10T03:02:00.000Z	abstrakt		i know orinoco supposedly makes good cards
2010-06-10T03:02:00.000Z	abstrakt		just want to be able to waltz down to BB and pick one up
2010-06-10T03:02:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	we don't know the sortiment of bestbuy
2010-06-10T03:03:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	why don't you order one on the internet ? :)
2010-06-10T03:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	cuz that takes time, i want to be able to just walk into best buy in like 10 minutes when i leave work and just get one
2010-06-10T03:05:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	yeah i know, that takes time :)
2010-06-10T03:06:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	everyone needs time to buy things and if you want to make sure it works, you have to invest that time
2010-06-10T03:06:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	yeah or i could ask to see if anyone else has invested that time and reap the benefits of their time
2010-06-10T03:06:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	and i you do it long enough you'll have wasted more time than you would have just seeing for yourself
2010-06-10T03:07:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	no, the issue is transportation time, so this could potentially save me hours of time
2010-06-10T03:07:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	so you live a few hundred miles away from bestbuy?
2010-06-10T03:26:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	may wanna check this out, seems to be supported, and it's best buy, but no guarantee they have it in their showcase :) http://www.bestbuy.com/site/D-Link+-+Extreme-N+ExpressCard+for+Most+PC+Laptops/9809841.p?id=1218177168066&skuId=9809841&st=wireless%20card&cp=1&lp=15
2010-06-10T03:26:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	it'S a d-link dwa 643
2010-06-10T03:27:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	how do you know it's supported? where did you find the data on that?
2010-06-10T03:27:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	google it
2010-06-10T03:27:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	it√Ñs listed as compatible on madwifi site
2010-06-10T03:33:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	yeah i guess so... it's not that expensive, so i guess it's worth a shot
2010-06-10T03:29:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	so madwifi comes with ubuntu?
2010-06-10T03:30:00.000Z	abstrakt	ubutom_	as in, after the install process i won't have to anything to get wifi up?
2010-06-10T03:33:00.000Z	ubutom_	abstrakt	don't know, but you could buy it and try it, if it doesn't work out of the box you can always bring it back and settle for another card
