2009-08-19T03:10:00.000Z	^Alita		hi to all
2009-08-19T03:11:00.000Z	^Alita		i'm in trouble with xawtv: it shows images, but i can't hear anything
2009-08-19T03:13:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	There may be several reasons for this. Elder cards need a physical connection to the sound card, or the gain of the tv card (not the main volume) may be muted
2009-08-19T03:14:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	where i can tune the3 card volume? i've got a pinnacle pctv
2009-08-19T03:15:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	if you open the volume control, you may see several tabs
2009-08-19T03:15:00.000Z	^Alita		i see, but it don't appear
2009-08-19T03:15:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	one for the sound card and another one for the tv card
2009-08-19T03:15:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	Hm ok, one second, I need to check
2009-08-19T03:16:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	which pinnacle tuner card is this?
2009-08-19T03:17:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	pctv 100
2009-08-19T03:18:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	the USB thingie?
2009-08-19T03:19:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	pci card
2009-08-19T03:19:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	ok
2009-08-19T03:22:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	are you using the saa7133 module?
2009-08-19T03:24:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	just a moment, i verify
2009-08-19T03:25:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	with lsmod appera several saa7134
2009-08-19T03:26:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	I would check dmesg output. You can for example run "dmesg|grep saa7134" and paste that to pastebin
2009-08-19T03:27:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	I don't know this specific card, some really do have to get attached to the sound card using an audio cable. If you would need that but don't have it, it's not gonna work, no matter what we try
2009-08-19T03:28:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	can i paste it to pvt, isn't long
2009-08-19T03:29:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	yeah but only if it's just a couple of lines
2009-08-19T03:29:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	i think it isn't necessary to use a cable, when i was using windows it works well
2009-08-19T03:29:00.000Z	papo	^Alita	ok then it's fine
2009-08-19T03:30:00.000Z	^Alita	papo	that is
