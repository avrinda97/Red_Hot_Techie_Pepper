2006-02-21T11:23:00.000Z	Mosi		someone help! i  blew up yaboot! >_<
2006-02-21T11:24:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	heh
2006-02-21T11:26:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	you know anything about yaboot?
2006-02-21T11:26:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	I installed debian on an ibook once, that's about it
2006-05-26T07:21:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	avi is just a container, it depends what's in it
2006-05-26T07:23:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	'file foo.avi' should give some clue as to what it is
2006-05-26T07:25:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	eg. "RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 672 x 368, 25.00 fps, video: XviD, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)"
2006-05-26T07:38:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	sorry, i got pulled afk. "file -i foo.avi" reports foo.avi: application/octet stream
2006-05-26T07:38:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	how informative ;)
2006-05-26T07:39:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	try without -i
2006-05-26T07:39:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	no better. foo.avi: data
2006-05-26T07:39:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	heheh
2006-05-26T07:40:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	the problem could just be that it's an incomplete file ^_^
2006-05-26T07:41:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	dunno - it should say more than that, I'd have thought, even if file didn't recognise the codecs; perhaps it's corrupt; what does mplayer say about it?
2006-05-26T07:42:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	it pops up a bank error window and freezes ^+^
2006-05-26T07:42:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	running it from a term?
2006-05-26T07:42:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	how do you run mplayer from terminal? just mplayer <file> ?
2006-05-26T07:43:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	yes
2006-05-26T07:44:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	"missing video stream?!"
2006-05-26T07:45:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	the file is corrupt, looks like
2006-05-26T07:45:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	bummer, thanks
2006-05-26T07:45:00.000Z	amphi	Mosi	it would detect a video stream even if it didn't have the codec to play it, AFAIK
2006-05-26T07:46:00.000Z	Mosi	amphi	thanks
