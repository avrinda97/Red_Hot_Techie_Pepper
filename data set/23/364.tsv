2011-11-17T12:55:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		How can I find a file that has specific text in it?
2011-11-17T12:56:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		ahhh cheers ActionParsnip
2011-11-17T12:56:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	 find . | xargs -n1 grep -li textstring (where the . is the path you want to search)
2011-11-17T12:57:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		Also in bash is it possible to change relative directories to absolute ones?
2011-11-17T12:57:00.000Z	jasonmsp		hey all...  I use nano for editing and there is a way to colorize the text within it.  when I edit some .conf files they are colored, others are not.
2011-11-17T12:58:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		anyone?
2011-11-17T12:58:00.000Z	jasonmsp		for example fail2ban.conf is not colorized but all the nano color configuration files are?!?
2011-11-17T12:58:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	patience....
2011-11-17T12:59:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		lol sorry jasonmsp :P
2011-11-17T12:59:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	absolute would be /home/me/Desktop  is that what you mean?
2011-11-17T12:59:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		yes jasonmsp
2011-11-17T12:59:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		so ~/ would change to /home/<user>
2011-11-17T12:59:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	  the top level is /
2011-11-17T12:59:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		i know
2011-11-17T13:00:00.000Z	jasonmsp		SomeoneWeirdTAFE:
2011-11-17T13:00:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	 open up a terminal.  type cd / and then ls to list the contents of that directory
2011-11-17T13:00:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	everything is found below that
2011-11-17T13:00:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	jasonmsp	can you reread my question? :P
2011-11-17T13:01:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	try using pwd to list the directory once you arrive there as it will give it to you in absolute
2011-11-17T13:02:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		no jasonmsp >.<
2011-11-17T13:02:00.000Z	SomeoneWeirdTAFE		dw.
2011-11-17T13:02:00.000Z	jasonmsp		dw = doesn't work?
2011-11-17T13:03:00.000Z	jasonmsp	SomeoneWeirdTAFE	can you pastebin what you are trying to do in sh?  I'm not an expert but it seems what you are trying to do should be pretty simple
