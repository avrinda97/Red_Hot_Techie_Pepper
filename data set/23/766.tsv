2011-03-10T17:47:00.000Z	teb_		Hi, I'm trying to activate a connection on the wlan0-interface using cnetworkmanager. But it complains that the device is not managed by networkmanager. Can anyone help me figure out where I can fix it so that it's managed?   No X available just a terminal.
2011-03-10T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	does nmcli behave the same way?
2011-03-10T17:49:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	I'll check
2011-03-10T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	one way I guess that might happen is if you've setup the interface in /etc/network/interfaces (you don't want to do that)
2011-03-10T17:52:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	there is a network config for eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces.  Would that also ruin the possiblity to control wlan0 by networkmanager?
2011-03-10T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	I don't believe so
2011-03-10T17:58:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	nmcli gives the same error about the device not being managed by networkmanager
2011-03-10T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	searching for that message in google has a lot of people changing "managed=false" to "managed=true" in /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf and restarting network manager.  I don't know what that does though
2011-03-10T18:16:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	thanks for trying :)
2011-03-10T18:07:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	already tried to change that one back and forth, but not working.  Guess I'll just have to google some more :) Thanks for the help
2011-03-10T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	try commenting the eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces and reboot (just to troubleshoot)
2011-03-10T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	you have physical access, right?
2011-03-10T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	what's the exact command you execute by the way?
2011-03-10T18:10:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	I'll try that as soon as I'm next to the box and can go into it physically
2011-03-10T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	not familiar with cnetworkmanager.  Does "nmcli con" display the interface?
2011-03-10T18:12:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	and "nmcli con up id 'connectionname'"
2011-03-10T18:13:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	nmcli con displays the connection yes
2011-03-10T18:13:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	but no interface
2011-03-10T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	try with uuid instead of id
2011-03-10T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	nmcli con up uuid long-string-blah-blah
2011-03-10T18:14:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	same problem, device not managed
2011-03-10T18:15:00.000Z	jrib	teb_	ok don't know then.  You probably have to dig into network manager docs (do they exist? :P) or wait for someone else
2011-03-10T18:15:00.000Z	teb_	jrib	i'll try to restart the network settings completely and see if i can get it working from the start....must have done something strange at some time
