2009-07-19T03:01:00.000Z	Threetimes		Hi, I have a dual-monitor setup. Once I'm logged in, everything works fine. When usplash shows the loading bar, my smaller monitor says "Out of range".
2009-07-19T03:03:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	set the resolution lower for the smaller monitor
2009-07-19T03:03:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	how do i do that?
2009-07-19T03:04:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	it's only a problem in usplash
2009-07-19T03:07:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	it's only a problem in usplash
2009-07-20T11:35:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	why are you trying to build that when tilp and tilp2 are in the repos?
2009-07-20T11:36:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	I installed tilp2 using APT, but when I run it I get the error
2009-07-20T11:37:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	dpkg -l libticables2-1  is it installed?
2009-07-20T11:37:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	yes
2009-07-20T11:41:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	that's weird.. hey is your calculator arm based?
2009-07-20T11:41:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	z80, it's the TI84+SE
2009-07-20T11:43:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	i think you might have to be a member of plugdev
2009-07-20T11:43:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	type groups and see if you are
2009-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	i am
2009-07-20T11:46:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	does this require a kernel module to be loaded ... like modprobe tilp2 or something  apt-cache show tilp2
2009-07-20T11:47:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	there's a tiglusb module, i'll load it now
2009-07-20T11:48:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	I do not have a tiglusb module
2009-07-20T11:48:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb/linux_install.html
2009-07-20T11:54:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	Since I do not have a tiglusb module, how do I install it?
2009-07-20T11:54:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	i'm not sure that's the missing element...
2009-07-20T11:56:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	look at this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=912717
2009-07-20T12:00:00.000Z	Threetimes	bucky	that's definately not my problem. He doesn't get any error like mine: "tilp: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libticables2.so.1: undefined symbol: usb_debug"
2009-07-20T12:02:00.000Z	bucky	Threetimes	you should /join #ModernCalcs there's only 5 people in there right now but they'd prolly know the answer right off if they are awake
