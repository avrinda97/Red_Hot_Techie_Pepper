2009-03-12T23:56:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, nalf: i can't seem to determine what I need i guess
2009-03-12T23:57:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, nalf: audacity 1.3.7 says it needs wxwidgets, which from what i can determine is = wxGTK
2009-03-12T23:58:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, nalf: and when i do "./configure && make" on wxGTK 2.8.9 i get http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/130316/
2009-03-12T23:59:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici: yeah, thank you. the version from Applications --> add/remove is a beta and has bugs etc
2009-03-13T00:01:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici: so the build-dep command wants to get a lot of packages. this will install the latest version? or just all the dependencies of the latest? thank you again
2009-03-13T00:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	martin_henry	the dependencies of the version shipped with ubuntu
2009-03-13T00:03:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: i see. so is it reinstalling anything? because it's unpacking a lot of packages... and i've already had audacity running
2009-03-13T00:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	martin_henry	well you only install build-dep packages if you are trying to compile the program from source...
2009-03-13T00:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	martin_henry	if you just use the prepackaged version you do not need the build dependencies
2009-03-13T00:05:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: ah alright. i'm understanding now :) it looks like wxGTK is MAKEing now, so audacity might be next! thank you
2009-03-13T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	martin_henry	i thought (and Pici too i'm sure) you were trying to build audacity from source possibily a newer version than the repo's
2009-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: yes, i am
2009-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: but i need to build the dependency wxGTK first
2009-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	martin_henry	then you should uninstall the prepackaged version.... ok
2009-03-13T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL		!checkinstall | martin_henry
2009-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: i believe that it's something the repo version did not depend on. but not 100% certain.
2009-03-13T00:08:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: hmmm i've already run "./configure && make" for wxGTK 2.8.9 :(
2009-03-13T00:10:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: it's been spitting stuff out in terminal for a few min now....is that normal?
2009-03-13T00:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	martin_henry	while compiling? yes it is
2009-03-13T00:11:00.000Z	martin_henry		pici, erUSUL: ok cool. i'm used to school assignments that compile in under a minute :P so there's no way to uninstall what i have just told to 'make'?
2009-03-13T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL		see the checkinstall factoid i gave you earlier
2009-03-13T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL		!checkinstall > martin_henry
2009-03-13T00:13:00.000Z	martin_henry	erUSUL	i didn't use checkinstall, it was too late
