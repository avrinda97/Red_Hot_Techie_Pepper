2012-10-06T22:46:00.000Z	ArcaneWater		Hmm ok now md5sum was correct then i burned it on dvd and now it gives me error failed to read sector 0x5xxxx (some numbers) on cd0
2012-10-06T22:46:00.000Z	ArcaneWater		Is that problem with dvd now?
2012-10-06T22:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	Did you burn as an image?
2012-10-06T22:47:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	yes i used Img-burn and after thath when i press enter is display same error as before
2012-10-06T22:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	Make sure it is burned at the slowest speed, I assume you have checked the md5 on this download.
2012-10-06T22:48:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	yes it was burned at slowest speed and md5 was checked and it was matching
2012-10-06T22:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	What is the computer model again, some need a f6 prompt of choice to get a boot?
2012-10-06T22:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	I can't find any references to linux or ubuntu with this computer, it seems to be a model that is specific for distribution outside of english speaking countries IE europe or the west, as I find most refrences in other languages, but this has to be a standard release by lenove I would think.
2012-10-06T22:57:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	i will try to burn one more dvd to see if it works or no :D
2012-10-06T22:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	Good idea if you have a usb flash I would try that as well.
2012-10-06T22:58:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	Just the loaders there are a handful to choose from unetbootin is commonly suggested.
2012-10-09T20:51:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	i found what is wrong :D
2012-10-09T20:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	I forget the issue.
2012-10-09T20:51:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	yesterday problems with grub because its not showing me Windows 7
2012-10-09T20:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	cool what was it, besides the GPT?
2012-10-09T20:52:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	i messed it with install, i should do it difrren since i have one thing called UEFI, and i need to preform diffrent installation.
2012-10-09T20:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	I new it had to be a specific type install, but not having experience here I was hesitant to advise, I don't want to brick anothers setup.
2012-10-09T20:54:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	can you recommend me how should i now partiton my 1 tb disc? For both windows and ubuntu? I am going to do fresh install now.
2012-10-09T20:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	Personally since I only use my W7 setup for just a few things I put it in a small partition, big enough though, and ubuntu the same, and have a shared NTFS for both the read and write to to exchange media....etc.
2012-10-09T20:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	I keep my OS in small partition, but big enough so I can clone them for any future problems.
2012-10-09T20:59:00.000Z	ArcaneWater	wilee-nilee	and what about others for swap etc?
2012-10-09T20:59:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	for example on a 160 gig HD I have 4 OS the W7 in a 40 gig and the others since they are linux a bit smaller and a NTFS to share with the W& and linux install 4 partitions, the ntfs for windows and share are primary partitions the other 3 are logicals in a extended.
2012-10-09T21:02:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArcaneWater	 I use a swap in the OS that adjust with needs, I don't hibernate so this works for me a normal swap would be equal to the ram at the least.
