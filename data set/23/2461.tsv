2009-03-17T14:26:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	What's wrong with Ubuntu?
2009-03-17T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	add some dns servers to /etc/resolv.conf
2009-03-17T14:19:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	I did it, setup static ip, and add "192.168.1.1" to dns in /etc/resolv.conf just can connect when i setup, it will failed when i restart system.
2009-03-17T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	did you add it in the correct synatax
2009-03-17T14:19:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	I don't know why Ubuntu 8.10 can't work like Debian, i have two machine, one is Debian, one is Ubuntu 8.10
2009-03-17T14:20:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	Yep, after i add it, it can work, but failed when i reboot.
2009-03-17T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	you need to add the word 'nameserver' to the beginning of it
2009-03-17T14:20:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	Yep, i did
2009-03-17T14:21:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	First is setup static IP in /etc/network/interfaces, and remove "inet dhcp", and add "namesever 192.168.1.1" in /etc/resolv.conf
2009-03-17T14:21:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	But now it can't work again.
2009-03-17T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	you need to have inet <interface name here> static
2009-03-17T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	can you pastebin your interfaces file please
2009-03-17T14:22:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	Ok
2009-03-17T14:24:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	See above at http://paste2.org/get/166165
2009-03-17T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	looks great
2009-03-17T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	can i see your /etc/resol.conf file
2009-03-17T14:26:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	I found Ubuntu will with "inet dhcp", so i setup static ip
2009-03-17T14:26:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	One sec
2009-03-17T14:27:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	See above
2009-03-17T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	add a few of these too: http://theos.in/windows-xp/free-fast-public-dns-server-list/
2009-03-17T14:31:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	Original have two IPs in /etc/resolv.conf, i just leave gateway in /etc/resolv.conf
2009-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	ManateeLazyCat	ActionParsnip1	Ubuntu is so great, but can't connect is so bad. It make me crazy.
2009-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ManateeLazyCat	if you add a few of those IPs as nameservers in resolv.conf, you will be able to browse the web
