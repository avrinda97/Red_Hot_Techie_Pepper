2006-09-11T16:55:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	nvidia kernel is the drivers for nvidia glx
2006-09-11T16:55:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	Well... I have ATI.
2006-09-11T16:56:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	I gave up on XGL anyway.
2006-09-11T05:04:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	/etc/init.d is like windows services
2006-09-11T05:10:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	then remove the festival package
2006-09-11T05:30:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	main.cf is like a windows ini file
2006-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	this might be related to dhcp or something similar
2006-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	It's not that; "configuring network services" takes about 5 seconds.  At least, I don't think it's that.
2006-09-11T05:27:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	have you configured postfix?
2006-09-11T05:27:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	Incorrectly.
2006-09-11T05:28:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	it seems you have deleted main.cf
2006-09-11T05:29:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	I... don't know what main.cf is.  I never messed with it directly.  What is a .cf file?
2006-09-11T05:30:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	Do you think maybe, if I uninstalled postfix, but something else was looking for it, I'd get this error?
2006-09-11T05:30:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	garanteed
2006-09-11T05:31:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	OKay... well, I don't want to reinstall Postfix, so, how do I figure out what is looking for it, and have it stop looking for it?
2006-09-11T05:31:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	you have your first broken dep it seems
2006-09-11T05:31:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	Or should I just bite the bullet and reinstall postfix?
2006-09-11T05:31:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	This isn't a function of removing stuff using update-rc.d, btw.  This was happening for a while before
2006-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	if postfix is installed just disable it from starting
2006-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	I used sudo update-rc.d postfix remove
2006-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	But it's still giving me this error.
2006-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	sklav	Tonren	ok that removes the start service
2006-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	Tonren	sklav	How do I disable the whole service...?  If that's what you're saying I should do?
