2007-05-27T15:00:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008		oh man this frustrating!!!  I can't do any administrative tasks from from Xfce/Xubuntu, because it keeps saying "Enter your password for administrative tasks"  I give it my root password, which WORKS GREAT by the way inside a terminal using SU or SUDO, but it won't accept it in the GUI
2007-05-27T15:00:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008		please help anyone?
2007-05-27T15:01:00.000Z	geoaxis	Clarrisa_2008	 you need to give your user password
2007-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	geoaxis	Clarrisa_2008	 is this the first user you added
2007-05-27T15:05:00.000Z	geoaxis	Clarrisa_2008	 which groups does your user currently belong to
2007-05-27T15:05:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	geoaxis	I have been using ubuntu without the the XFCE Desktop for over a year.  I had it set up only as a LAMP server, then I loaded xubuntu desktop today.  As far as the users are concerned, I have Root, and Myself added, so I guess yes, I'm the first user that I loaded
2007-05-27T15:06:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	geoaxis	how can I check that from a terminal?
2007-05-27T15:08:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008	geoaxis	how do I check what groups I'm a member of.  I can open a terminal an SU, or sudo.  but can't remeber the command for group membership
