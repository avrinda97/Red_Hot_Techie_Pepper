2010-07-13T20:12:00.000Z	NET||abuse		hey guys, just switched on my laptop, it's getting not wifi connections
2010-07-13T20:13:00.000Z	NET||abuse		was working an hour ago when i left the house
2010-07-13T20:13:00.000Z	NET||abuse		i rebooted and i'm not getting any networks visible, the Enable Wireless checkbox on nm-applet is greyed out.
2010-07-13T20:14:00.000Z	NET||abuse		the hardware wifi light is on... iwconfig show wifi bindings on the eth1 device.... what do i do here?
2010-07-13T20:15:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	what kind of laptop?
2010-07-13T20:16:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	dell d630,
2010-07-13T20:17:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	look around the sides of the case for a switch to turn on/off wireless. I had a Dell that had a little switch like that which I bumped to 'off' and I was stymied for 4+ hours
2010-07-13T20:17:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	nooooo, the switch is on, absolutely, the wiif hardware light goes off if the switch is flippedd,,,,
2010-07-13T20:17:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	so  that's absolutely not it...
2010-07-13T20:18:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	bummer. I was hoping it would be that simple. I don't know what to tell you then
2010-07-13T20:18:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	wait, i remember something about the security policy not allowing the d630 to work after some minor change
2010-07-13T20:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	just saw what's happeneing,, the switch logic is backward, when the hardware is switched on, ubuntu suddenly thinks it's switched off... and vice versa, when the ardware is switched off,, it thinks it's now on
2010-07-13T20:21:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	that is totally bizarre.

2010-07-13T20:22:00.000Z	NET||abuse		some other guy had the exact same problem,, only i can't get online without wifi, don't have ethernet port access..
2010-07-13T20:23:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	yeh, i had the switch on, it thought it was offf,, so I shutdown, turn off wifi while it's off, boot up again, then it worked......
2010-07-13T20:24:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	prolly drivers that dell helped to create for the model of laptop for linux are borked..
2010-07-13T20:24:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	I wonder if you'll have the same problem where you have to shut down and start it 'off' then switch it on each time
2010-07-13T20:25:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	I'm having a bit of an issue myself with a Dell and its touchpad drivers. I've searched repeatedly and haven't found a fix
2010-07-13T20:25:00.000Z	NET||abuse	ottermaton	what's the bug?
2010-07-13T20:26:00.000Z	ottermaton		That being said, it's not as if the touchpad isn't working at all, it's just that scroling and such won't activate. It only sees it as a generic ps/2 mouse
2010-07-13T20:27:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	this is on a Vostro v13, btw, which otherwise is TOTALLY sweet
2010-07-13T20:28:00.000Z	ottermaton	NET||abuse	I only paid $450 for it NEW w/ warranty. It's got plenty of power for what I need and I'm continually having strangers say, "oooh, that's a nice laptop."
