2006-11-01T06:24:00.000Z	kevu		how do i tell a program to start on start up?
2006-11-01T06:26:00.000Z	kevu		Llj: but it's a c program aka terminal app, not gui one.
2006-11-01T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	what sort of thing, exactly?
2006-11-01T06:27:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	a c program that i want to execute at each bootup, but not depending on gnome to do it. how would i do this from the console?
2006-11-01T06:29:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	adding to /etc/rc.local should do.
2006-11-01T06:37:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	ok rc.local was what i was looking for, thanks. but what is the syntax? can i just add /home/kevu/script.out there?
2006-11-01T06:39:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	yes, though i would *not* add a script that's in your /home directory as a startup script. move that script somewhere else (/usr/local/bin would be the logical choice), and set the permissions so that only root can write to it
2006-11-01T06:40:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	(chown root:root /usr/local/bin/scriptname ; chmod o-rwx /usr/local/bin/scriptname)
2006-11-01T06:40:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	what could go wrong if i had it in /home/?
2006-11-01T06:41:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	that anybody who gets access to your own account could gain root as easily as eating a piece of cake.
2006-11-01T06:43:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	but will there be any problem? because ubuntu does not have root by default. will the chown command work?
2006-11-01T06:44:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	you'll need to run it with sudo, but yeah
2006-11-01T06:44:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	do i insert that line as it is in rc.local, or should i execute the commands on that file and then just add /usr/local/bin/script ?
2006-11-01T06:44:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	and ubuntu has root (as in having a superuser). it's just that you can't directly access the "root" account, and you use sudo instead
2006-11-01T06:45:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	i'm not getting you
2006-11-01T06:45:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	you should move the script, and run the chown and chmod commands, now. in /etc/rc.local you simply run the script
2006-11-01T06:46:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	so in rc.local there should be only /usr/local/bin/script. right?
2006-11-01T06:46:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	right
2006-11-01T06:47:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	ok thank you!
2006-11-01T06:55:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	but if i chown it to root, then if i log in as kevu, will it get executed?
2006-11-01T06:57:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	yes, since it'll get executed by root, at boot time, before you even log in
2006-11-01T06:57:00.000Z	kevu	LjL	oh ok makes sense now
2006-11-01T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	kevu	make sure the script isn't buggy, since it's going to have root privileges.
