2009-07-28T00:19:00.000Z	poseidon_		I need some help with lspci
2009-07-28T00:20:00.000Z	poseidon_		lspci doesn't seem to return correct information.
2009-07-28T00:20:00.000Z	poseidon_		Are there any errors associated with lspci or the kernel not detecting installed pci hardware?
2009-07-28T00:21:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	why do you think lspci gives wrong information?
2009-07-28T00:22:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	The hardware is disparate from what's detected in a windows installation (since removed) as well as this location: http://www.linuxquestions.org/hcl/showproduct.php/product/4075/cat/all
2009-07-28T00:23:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	can you paste the lspci output to pastebin to let us see it?
2009-07-28T00:24:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	Specifically devices 02:06.3,02:06.4, and 00:1e.3
2009-07-28T00:24:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	how do I do that in IRC?
2009-07-28T00:26:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	Did you get it?
2009-07-28T00:27:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	uh? did you paste the url in the channel?
2009-07-28T00:27:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	I was trying to send it to you over irc.  pastebin is a website?
2009-07-28T00:27:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	Google, here I come
2009-07-28T00:27:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	yes :)
2009-07-28T00:29:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	http://pastebin.com/m53653e15
2009-07-28T00:29:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	well done ;)
2009-07-28T00:30:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	I also know that the SD card was working prior to my installation.
2009-07-28T00:31:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	which is the computer part number that states in the sticker at the bottom
2009-07-28T00:32:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	agency series HSTNN-C02C
2009-07-28T00:40:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	I think that it's just that there are really different versions of the same model you have. If you take a look here, you'll see it's almost exactly your hardware combination: http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/hp-compaq-nc4200/4507-3121_7-31343460.html
2009-07-28T00:40:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	I don't really think lspci is cheating you :)
2009-07-28T00:41:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	So you're saying that my SD card isn't installed?
2009-07-28T00:43:00.000Z	poseidon_	papapep	Thanks for the help.  :)
2009-07-28T00:44:00.000Z	papapep	poseidon_	you're welcome
