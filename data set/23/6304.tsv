2008-07-08T00:43:00.000Z	chris_		how do i install the wolfenstein enemy territory .run
2008-07-08T00:43:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	make it executable and run it
2009-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	make sure the windows users have write access to the share and directory
2009-01-09T12:05:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	mask it's the key - permissons on the file system AND share are
2009-01-09T12:06:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	what do i need to do to fix it?
2009-01-09T12:08:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	how do i check to see if windows users have delete access in samba?
2009-01-09T12:09:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	if the users have write access to the share, and write access to the file system, you should be fine
2009-01-09T12:09:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	thats the problem, they can read and write, but they can't delete
2009-01-09T12:10:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	thats most odd, what does the samba server logs say when you try to delete it
2009-01-09T12:11:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	it says access denied from windows. where is the log for samba located? i cant find it.
2009-01-09T12:12:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	/var/log/samba
2009-01-09T12:16:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	getpeername failed. Error was Transport endpoint is not connected
2009-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	let me read up see what that error message means
2009-01-09T12:24:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	any luck?
2009-01-09T12:25:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	that initially looks like your not actually connected, although that doesn't make sense
2009-01-09T12:26:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	yea its connecting, the files xfer to the samba from windows and then can be moved back, but the files on the samba share cannot be deleted and it says denied access from windows
2009-01-09T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	out of interest what user name are you connecting to the samba share as (windows username)
2009-01-09T12:27:00.000Z	chris_	ikonia	i am using a user name set up in ubuntu from useradd
2009-01-09T12:28:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	so your connecting to the share using a username that is setup in ubuntu, can you show me your smb.conf file in a pastebin please ?
2009-01-09T12:29:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	no problem
2012-11-12T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	no better, no worse, it's personal choice which you like best
2012-11-12T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	chris_	asking the same question in 60 seconds isn't really appreciated
