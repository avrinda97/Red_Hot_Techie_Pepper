2007-05-28T09:55:00.000Z	PurpZeY		What is the ls command to show all devices?
2007-05-28T09:55:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	'lshw'
2007-05-28T10:25:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	Would it possible to transfer a deb or package from a windows machine, via flash drive and install to an ubuntu machine?
2007-05-28T10:26:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	should be fine ...if you use vfat for the flash drive you can mount it easily...if you use ntfs, use ntfs-3g to mount the voume
2007-05-28T10:26:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	What is the terminal command for that?
2007-05-28T10:27:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	find out what filesystem your flashdrive uses first.
2007-05-28T10:27:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	NTFS.
2007-05-28T10:27:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	then use ntfs-3g to mount the volume
2007-05-28T10:27:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	find out what device it is...create a mount point for the device... mount it with ntfs-3g... and copy away
2007-05-28T10:28:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	make sure to umount the device cleanly also or you'll have headaches later
2007-05-28T10:28:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	How do I find where it's mounted?
2007-05-28T10:29:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	you have to mount it
2007-05-28T10:29:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	But when I put in the flashdrive ubuntu just recognizes usually
2007-05-28T10:31:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	'fdisk -l' you'll find where it is mounted
2007-05-28T10:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	Then unmount and remount using the command you suggested?
2007-05-28T10:32:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	yes
2007-05-31T08:13:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	Not positive, but, I got scripts off the forums for powersh and the other related config file, edited them in, and now my power management is much easier...although I think the gui is basically just an ornament now.
2007-05-31T08:13:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	ugh.
2007-05-31T08:14:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	I'll look into that. Thank you.
2007-05-31T08:14:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	The fix itself was rather easy. . .
2007-06-29T10:04:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	hey you're still working with Ubuntu, great! :D
2007-06-29T10:05:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Lilacor	I am indeed...And loving it...=)...Thanks!
2007-06-29T10:05:00.000Z	Lilacor	PurpZeY	good stuff :)
