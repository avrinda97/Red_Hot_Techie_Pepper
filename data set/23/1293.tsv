2010-10-25T02:05:00.000Z	bfinch		btw... i find between the synaptic tool and the ubuntu software gui tool... i am not often (if ever) using the command line.... on the other hand, I am having problems doing some simple java "builds" fromt he command line that aren;t a problem in distros other than ubuntu
