2005-08-25T16:00:00.000Z	abyss		everytime ill try to modprobe the rt2500.ko it says :
2005-08-25T16:00:00.000Z	abyss		FATAL: Module rt2500.ko not found.
2005-08-25T16:00:00.000Z	abyss		y?
2005-08-25T16:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	leave the .ko off
2005-08-25T16:00:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	it wont work too
2005-08-25T05:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	well, yes - it's called the linux kernel I believe...
2005-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	sorry that was for you not abydos
2005-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	cause if i start the system and all was started it use 200mb of memory and 100mb free
2005-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	linux handles all that
2005-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	it uses as much memory as possible -RAM is orders of magnitude more efficient than disc
2005-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	 it cannot be that my systems eat with no use 305MB memory
2005-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	most of what you see is cache and buffers
2005-08-25T05:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	type " free -m " in a terminal and read the cache and buffers - subtract to get a better idea of your memory use
2005-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	Mem:           313        284         28          0         14        150
2005-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	I assure you the linux kernel is handling your memory just fine
2005-08-25T05:31:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	exists a way to disable any effects on system cause i have only a ppc 400mhz
2005-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	I don't understand your question - if you are still worrying about your RAM, you misunderstood what I was saying
2005-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	 no i understand but cpu usage like 20 - 30 %
2005-08-25T05:35:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	if i only move the mouse for a while
2005-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	is your mchine very slow? Or just reasonably OK for a 400mhz machine?
2005-08-25T05:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	if you want to reduce the load, you can use a different desktop - for example install xfce4
2005-08-25T05:45:00.000Z	abyss	thoreauputic	how about java runtime for ubuntu?
2005-08-25T05:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abyss	^^^^
