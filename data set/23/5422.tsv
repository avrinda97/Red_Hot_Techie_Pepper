2006-12-02T13:43:00.000Z	Flannel	mlinton	is sdc1 (where the grub comment mentions windows to be) really 0,0? in your bios? or have you since moved/tweaked/etc your hardware
2006-12-02T13:43:00.000Z	mlinton		let me see...
2006-12-02T13:43:00.000Z	mlinton		how can I tell?
2006-12-02T13:44:00.000Z	Flannel	mlinton	check your BIOS
2006-12-02T13:44:00.000Z	mlinton		ok, I know what the bios states.  The disk I'm trying to boot from is the first sata disk on the nvidia array
2006-12-02T13:44:00.000Z	mlinton		so it's probably been changed since it was sdc
2006-12-02T13:45:00.000Z	mlinton		probably sda now
2006-12-02T13:45:00.000Z	mlinton		but how could the other grub options work and xp not.  If it was really borked wouldn't all of the boot options be broken?
2006-12-02T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	mlinton	it'd be a windows specific issue, not a grub issue. try changing root to rootnoverify
2006-12-02T13:47:00.000Z	Flannel	mlinton	well, it could be a grub issue as in not finding the windows drive, or whatnot.  But, it's not a global grub issue

2006-12-02T13:48:00.000Z	mlinton		sdc1
2006-12-02T13:48:00.000Z	mlinton		is the XP install disk
2006-12-02T13:48:00.000Z	Flannel	mlinton	Windows is NOT the first partition.  You need 2,0 and then you'll need to use a pair of maps
2006-12-02T13:48:00.000Z	mlinton		explain... please
2006-12-02T13:49:00.000Z	Flannel		map (hd0) (hd2) \n map (hd2) (hd0)
2006-12-02T13:49:00.000Z	mlinton		in the menu.lst right?
2006-12-02T13:50:00.000Z	Flannel		on your windows thing
2006-12-02T13:50:00.000Z	mlinton		before or after the root command?
2006-12-02T13:51:00.000Z	mlinton	Flannel	thanks btw - saving my bacon
2006-12-02T13:52:00.000Z	Flannel	mlinton	before the root, and I suppose that means you don't need to change the root line
2006-12-02T13:52:00.000Z	mlinton		cool let me try it...
2006-12-02T13:55:00.000Z	mlinton	Flannel	no dice error 11, unrecognized device
