2010-06-03T22:55:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	have you tried just figuring out what is wrong?
2010-06-03T22:55:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	I know what's wrong.  Someone removed the files manually from the file system.
2010-06-03T22:56:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	so?  dpkg doesn't care about that.
2010-06-03T22:56:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	This .deb isn't in the repositories; it's made by the OpenQRM guys.
2010-06-03T22:56:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	are the prerm/postrm scripts failing or something?
2010-06-03T22:56:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	They don't exist -- the installation/removal dpkg fail.
2010-06-03T22:56:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	oh the prerm/postrm scripts were deleted?
2010-06-03T22:57:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	Yes.
2010-06-03T22:57:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	Before I got to this box someone else trid to install from both the .deb package and from sources, same product.
2010-06-03T22:58:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	Somehow, in the middle of that, the scripts were deleted.
2010-06-03T22:58:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	your editor suggests the scripts are there though, doesn't it?
2010-06-03T22:58:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	I'm trying to unravel this so that the package installs well from either .deb or sources.
2010-06-03T22:58:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	you don't have any /var/lib/dpkg/info/openqrm* files?
2010-06-03T22:59:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	The scripts aren't there.  The whole file structure below /usr/share/openqrm is gone.
2010-06-03T22:59:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	the path I just gave you is not under /usr/share/openqrm.  I'm talking about where dpkg stores the prerm, etc scripts for a package
2010-06-03T23:00:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	Sorry, scrolling back.
2010-06-03T23:00:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	Checking.
2010-06-03T23:05:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	judging by your silence I assume you know what to do now?
2010-06-03T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	that's not the "nice" way :/
2010-06-03T23:43:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	I have a 1600 deadline, it's already 1142.  I don't care about 'nice' much at the moment.  If this were a production server I'd be more conscientious.  I appreciate the pointers, though, and promise to build the server well if this ever makes it to production.
2010-06-03T23:44:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	ideally, you would check what the prerm and postrm scripts were actually attempting to do and go from there, I understand "getting things done" though
2010-06-03T23:45:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	jrib	Normally I'd troubleshoot or even discard the package from use.  We have a demo for something in 4 hours, scripted, so just getting through that is enough for today.  I hope you didn't feel like I dismissed the good advise -- I didn't out of being rude, but out of necessity.
2010-06-03T23:47:00.000Z	jrib	pr3d4t0r	no problem, just wanted to make sure you were aware of it.  Good luck with the rest of the stuff that you have to do in the next 4 hours :)
