2011-12-22T00:48:00.000Z	tuga		ok i google and i found nothing, but here is my problem: i think the my keyboard is interfering with the linux ( the sound icon blinks, and i can't write almost nothing) if anyone cold help i appreciate ;), if not thank u anyway
2011-12-22T00:49:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	Okay... let me break it down more. When you type on the keyboard, the sound icon blinks?
2011-12-22T00:50:00.000Z	tuga	cypher-neo	yes
2011-12-22T00:51:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	I wonder if there is a window that requires input that is hidden. Try hitting Alt-Tab a couple times to cycle between windows.
2011-12-22T00:52:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	Sometimes dialog boxes get lost and you end up with unresponsive keyboard, and it's just a box you need to close.
2011-12-22T00:53:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	You might also try using Unity shortcut Ctrl-Alt-Up Arrow to expose all windows and select one to give focus to.
2011-12-22T00:55:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	Did that work?
2011-12-22T00:56:00.000Z	tuga	cypher-neo	no didn't work. it still's blinks
2011-12-22T00:58:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	You're using a USB keyboard?
2011-12-22T00:58:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	Is it a USB wireless keyboard?
2011-12-22T00:59:00.000Z	tuga	cypher-neo	yes is a wireless (Microsoft Keyboard)
2011-12-22T01:00:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	Check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallUSBKeyboard
2011-12-22T01:00:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	It might be a BIOS setting you need to change.
2011-12-22T01:02:00.000Z	tuga	cypher-neo	what is need to change in BIOS? and how i go to the BIOS in linux?
2011-12-22T01:03:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	Umm, does this sound like your problem? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-evdev/+bug/636311
2011-12-22T01:04:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	This is an old bug, it shouldn't be around anymore...
2011-12-22T01:08:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	What Ubuntu version are you using?
2011-12-22T01:08:00.000Z	tuga	cypher-neo	yeah is that bug
2011-12-22T01:11:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	Wow. Okay, file a bug report. That bug hadn't been confirmed in 11.04.
2011-12-22T01:12:00.000Z	tuga	cypher-neo	ok, how do I file a bug report?
2011-12-22T01:14:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	On this page https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-evdev/+bug/636311 you'll need to click the + sign for "Also affects distribution" and add 11.04 as an affected distribution.
2011-12-22T01:14:00.000Z	cypher-neo	tuga	You will likely need to log in or create an account on Launchpad when you do that.
2011-12-22T01:17:00.000Z	tuga	cypher-neo	ok and thanks,  u been helpful. peace ;)
