2007-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	todkon		I need help with getting full resolution with my nVidia 6800 GT
2007-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	todkon		I tried everything on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
2007-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	todkon		can someone please help me?
2007-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	what driver are you using? binary or free?
2007-08-13T16:28:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	I think the binary
2007-08-13T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	try with the nvidia-settings program
2007-08-13T16:28:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	it says nVidia everytime before GDM starts
2007-08-13T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	nice GUI and all ;)
2007-08-13T16:28:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	tried it already, I couldn't find anything
2007-08-13T16:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	you didint' find the program? or what?
2007-08-13T16:29:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	no, I found it, it just doesn't let me do anything of use
2007-08-13T16:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	strange... allways worked for me... maybe you need to launch it with gksu??
2007-08-13T16:31:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	hmm, tried gksu, gives me the same functionality as it gave me just running sudo
2007-08-13T16:31:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	what should I be looking for?
2007-08-13T16:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	in the section "X Server Display Configuration" ypou can set the desired resolution color deph etc
2007-08-13T16:34:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	it has X Server Information, X Server Display Configuration, X SCreen 0 > X Server Color Correction, X Server XVideo Settings, Cursor SHadow, OpenGL Settings, OpenGL/GLX Information, Antialiasing Settings; GPU 0  - (GeForce 6800 GT) >> Thermal Monitor, CRT-0 - (@@@), and nvidia-settings configuration :P
2007-08-13T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	 X Server Display Configuration <<< Here
2007-08-13T16:34:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	the resolution only gives me the "Auto" option
2007-08-13T16:35:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	and the menu next to it is greyed out
2007-08-13T16:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	mine is not greyed and there's where you choose the res (the auto is for refresh rate)
2007-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	perhaps I ran the wrong command to initiate the nvidia drivers?
2007-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	todkon	dunno
2007-08-13T16:39:00.000Z	todkon	erUSUL	thanks for the help, but I think I'll have to keep digging around forums or something
