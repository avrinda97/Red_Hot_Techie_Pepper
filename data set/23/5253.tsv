2007-08-08T06:37:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	not "nameserver 10.0.0.2"
2007-08-08T06:37:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	Sorry, I need more info. What is in the file now, and what you think should be in the file (and why)
2007-08-08T06:38:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	i just dont want it changing to "nameserver 10.0.0.2" everytime i boot, so i have to change it to a working nameserver
2007-08-08T06:38:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	"nameserver 10.0.0.2" might be what the DHCP server is sending you, if it is acting as a forwarding nameserver. This is quite common.
2007-08-08T06:39:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	yeah, but im not supposed to use dhcp at all. ...
2007-08-08T06:39:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	However, look in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf for DHCP config
2007-08-08T06:40:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	cant i just tell it *not* to use dhcp? at all?
2007-08-08T06:40:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	am i supposed to comment everything
2007-08-08T06:40:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	Of course! System->Administration->Network
2007-08-08T06:41:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	no, don't comment everything :-)
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	Does System->Administration->Network make sense to you?
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	yeah.. i just dont have gnome running atm.. ill swap :3
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	thanks
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	Don't swap - I'm sure there is a KDE equoivalent. Ask here!
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	im using openbox
2007-08-08T06:43:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	so... :/
2007-08-08T06:46:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	what?
2007-08-08T06:47:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	Do you have an interfces file, is openbox X, can you just run the gnome network manager?
2007-08-08T06:47:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	uhh.. openbox is a window manager.
2007-08-08T06:48:00.000Z	medfly	kauer	i can just swap, yes
2007-08-08T06:48:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	Don't swap, just run the program. It's just an X program, it doesn't need Gnome (I think).
2007-08-08T06:51:00.000Z	kauer	medfly	"sudo network-admin", regardless of window manager.
