2008-10-05T02:53:00.000Z	martintux		anyone know how to start MySQL using XAMPP ?
2008-10-05T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	xampp is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-10-05T02:54:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	in what way ?
2008-10-05T02:54:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	lamp is good but xampp suit comes with complete tools..
2008-10-05T02:54:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	so as I said xampp is nothing to do with ubuntu
2008-10-05T02:55:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	can u elaborate this?
2008-10-05T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	xammp is not an ubuntu packaged producct, so it must have been installed outside of ubuntu's package manager and therefore support should be with the xammp community
2008-10-05T02:56:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	oh i get it. so the package from outside cant' get support from here?
2008-10-05T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	not quite, but your just asking for generic help
2008-10-05T02:56:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	although it's for ubuntu?
2008-10-05T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	your problem is nothing to do with ubuntu -it' application/generic linux specific
2008-10-05T02:58:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	so it seems like i messed up:
2008-10-05T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	ln -sf replaces links, or remove the link
2008-10-05T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	thats right
2008-10-05T02:59:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	i don't know how to use in command
2008-10-05T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	man ln will give you more detail, put use ln -sf rather than ln -sf
2008-10-05T02:59:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	how could i list all the links i have?
2008-10-05T03:01:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	and one more proble... how could i install webcam properly? is there any package which could at reconize webcam?
2008-10-05T03:04:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	how to list all the links i have?
2008-10-05T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	find -type should work
2008-10-05T03:11:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	is there anyway i could create link using gui?
2008-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	ikonia	martintux	I'm sure nautluis does
2008-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	martintux	ikonia	i can't find it
