2011-09-22T05:21:00.000Z	fendur		I am not having luck changing my window manager in 10.04. I've tried a couple settings in gconf-editor and I've tried using the option at the bottom of the gdm login screen. I'm trying to use "dwm" -- a simple window manager. Any tips?
2011-09-22T05:22:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 its likely you have to log off and after putting in your password before hitting enter,, change the session to dwm
2011-09-22T05:22:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 you could also try in terminal  dwm --replac & disown
2011-09-22T05:23:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 rather    dwm --replace & disown
2011-09-22T05:23:00.000Z	fendur		coz: odd. dwm doesn't have a --replace. I'
2011-09-22T05:23:00.000Z	fendur		ll try the login method you propose.
2011-09-22T05:23:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 then log off and try changing the session to dwm
2011-09-22T05:24:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	I had no luck with that. I chose my user, typed password, changed the wm option to dwm, and pressed enter.
2011-09-22T05:25:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 then you may have to check online about this,, I have not used dwm  so I may have it all wrong
2011-09-22T05:25:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	thank you.
2011-09-22T05:25:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 let me search ,, hold on
2011-09-22T05:27:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	i'd love to hear what you find. I certainly have looked. A lot of the advise doesn't seem possible due to various differences between instructions and what I see here on my desktop.
2011-09-22T05:29:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 did you see this?    http://aclindsay.com/blog/2011/04/installing-dwm-and-killing-gdm-on-ubuntu/
2011-09-22T05:30:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 you might also want to   sudo apt-get install dwm-tools
2011-09-22T05:32:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	no. but the way he describes it, it just worked. Other discussion involves not booting to gdm at all (i.e. startup with a basic console login)
2011-09-22T05:33:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 understood...as I said I know little about this,, have you looked into xmonad?
2011-09-22T05:34:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	i just looked it up. Looks like an interesting alternative.
2011-09-22T05:34:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	thanks for your help.
2011-09-22T05:35:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 no problem,, I do know of several people  w ho prefer xmonad
2011-09-22T06:07:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	for the record, I got it to work by switching to xdm and using it's simple mechanism for WM choice of modifying ~/.Xsession
2011-09-22T06:07:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 excellent ! :)  glad to hear that
2011-09-22T06:11:00.000Z	fendur	coz_	thanks again.
2011-09-22T06:11:00.000Z	coz_	fendur	 no problem
