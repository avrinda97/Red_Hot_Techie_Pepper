2006-10-02T09:39:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	gksudo gedit /path/to/file ?
2006-10-02T09:42:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	chown - the partition - talk about a trial by fire. - sorrry.
2006-10-02T09:45:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	Yuo can boot the system or the system is unbootable?
2006-10-02T09:47:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	Ah! - Okay - to me it sounds like a proiblem with the display adapter. - no desk. - does sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg sound like a good idea if it will give you icons on a desktop?
2006-10-02T09:48:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	I had the worst feeling you might say something like that.
2006-10-02T09:50:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	Okay, we are back to writing to a disk with chown -options /path/to/disk/directory then sudo vim or gksudo gedit
2006-10-02T09:51:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	Do yourself a favor and avoid using vim for as long as humanly possible. - get a live cd ANY live cd

2006-10-02T09:55:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	first you need to be root so-o you can use gksudo and then your gui app. - if you are using kde i don't recall the graphical sudo app command.... - help
2006-10-02T09:56:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	sudo su might work.
2006-10-02T09:59:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	Do you have the magic square? "#"
2006-10-02T10:02:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	Gah. The command line is challenging. - i don't know where ot go from here.
2006-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	THX-1138	midgetg0at	no need for the live cd or gksudo now. - whew
