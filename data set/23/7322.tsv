2005-09-03T11:46:00.000Z	m1th		im trying to dual boot windows/ubuntu on my laptop but ive had a pretty nasty experience trying to get mandrake 10.1 and windowsxp to dual boot on my other machince... the boot loader borkation occured then. im wondering whether there's an easy option to get linux install on an ntfs with windowsxp
2005-09-03T11:47:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	this isn't mandrake is it?
2005-09-03T11:47:00.000Z	m1th	konra`	yeah, but the same stuff might happen
2005-09-03T11:48:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	ubuntu uses grub and mandrake lilo, so slightly different
2005-09-03T11:48:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	I'm dualing ubuntu and windows
2005-09-03T11:48:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	and ubuntu can't access the ntfs, and windows can't acces the ext3
2005-09-03T11:49:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	so I have a shared fat32 partition
2005-09-03T11:49:00.000Z	m1th	konra`	did you have your HD ntfs initially? beofre installing ubuntu
2005-09-03T11:50:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	I partitioned to : 40 GB ext3, 40 GB fat32, 80 GB ntfs
2005-09-03T11:50:00.000Z	m1th	konra`	 using partition magic?
2005-09-03T11:51:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	no, fdisk :p
2005-09-03T11:51:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	easy once you know how to use it
2005-09-03T11:51:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	and plenty powerful
2005-09-03T11:51:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	I installed windows, then ubuntu, after setting up that partitioning
2005-09-03T11:53:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	use fdisk to set up your linux area, shared area, and leave some blank space which you can use for your windows install
2005-09-03T11:54:00.000Z	m1th	konra`	aha but i dont wanna lose my data on this HD
2005-09-03T11:54:00.000Z	m1th	konra`	so i might have to go with partition magic
2005-09-03T11:55:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	ah
2005-09-03T11:55:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	I backedup everything beforehand
2005-09-03T11:55:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	on a netowkr share
2005-09-03T11:56:00.000Z	m1th	konra`	yeah i do have to baackup first though
2005-09-03T11:56:00.000Z	konra`	m1th	easy for me because I can just use my families network shares :p
2005-09-03T11:57:00.000Z	m1th	konra`	lucky :p
