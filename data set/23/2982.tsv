2012-04-24T00:55:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	are you still around?  removing all those kernels broke the wireless on my wife's dell mini, that is why I'm not allowed to touch her computer
2012-04-24T00:56:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	I noticed while removing kernels it kept saying stuff like wl.ko was active in this kernel, something about dkms to install module or something like that.  I'm assuming this is a known issue with the broadcom drivers for the wireless of this thing??
2012-04-24T00:58:00.000Z	shane2peru		anyone know about the dell inspiron 10 that had ubuntu pre-installed 10.04?  removing old kernels seems to have broken the wireless connection
2012-04-24T01:00:00.000Z	bekks	shane2peru	Thats not a bug, because the module names are the same between kernels.
2012-04-24T01:01:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	ok, but for some reason the wireless is not loaded, or working
2012-04-24T01:01:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	I ran 'ifconfig -a' and it only showed eth0 and lo, nothing for wireless
2012-04-24T01:02:00.000Z	bekks		Still, the names are the same, and the messages just told you, that there were modules built using dkms.
2012-04-24T01:03:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	ok, what should be my next step, google pulls up a lot of stuff that is irrelevant
2012-04-24T01:03:00.000Z	bekks	shane2peru	Uninstall the old kernels you want to be uninstalled.
2012-04-24T01:04:00.000Z	shane2peru		beaks, ok, I did that, I left all but the last 3 or 4
2012-04-24T01:04:00.000Z	bekks	shane2peru	Now you should have much more space avail, dont you?
2012-04-24T01:04:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	yes, space is great, I think it was something like 64% free for the inodes.
2012-04-24T01:04:00.000Z	shane2peru		.
2012-04-24T01:05:00.000Z	bekks	shane2peru	Then everything is ok :)
2012-04-24T01:05:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	however, it doesn't connect to the web now, I'm on my laptop
2012-04-24T01:05:00.000Z	bekks	shane2peru	Then you removed more than you should.
2012-04-24T01:06:00.000Z	shane2peru		bekks; I don't think I did, I left the latest few kernels I think .37 .38 .39 and .40  however I'm not sure how to see what kernel it is booting off
2012-04-24T01:07:00.000Z	bekks		uname -a tells you which kernel is currently active
2012-04-24T01:07:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	ok, but how do I select what kernel to boot?
2012-04-24T01:08:00.000Z	bekks	shane2peru	in the grub menu
2012-04-24T01:09:00.000Z	shane2peru		beaks grub menu doesn't show on this, ubuntu was pre-installed, and I haven't messed with it hardly at all.
2012-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	ˆˆˆ
2012-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	shane2peru	bekks	it booted off 2.6.32-41  so I'm thinking I'm going to boot off the old kernel to see if that works, once I figure out how.
