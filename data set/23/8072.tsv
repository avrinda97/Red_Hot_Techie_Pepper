2005-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	randabis		indeed
2005-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	randabis		and it rocks my socks
2005-04-11T08:41:00.000Z	randabis		it doesn't change it over lewwy...it adds it to your install..so you'll still have gnome
2005-04-11T08:41:00.000Z	randabis		but you'll be able to use kde as well
2005-04-11T08:42:00.000Z	randabis		definitely
2005-04-11T08:42:00.000Z	randabis		and it's FAST
2005-04-11T08:42:00.000Z	randabis		faster than gnome imho
2005-04-11T08:44:00.000Z	randabis		because debian offers the majority of their repositories on cds
2005-04-11T08:44:00.000Z	randabis		for people with slow internet connections
2005-04-11T08:45:00.000Z	randabis		the non-free repository is about the only thing not included
2005-04-11T08:46:00.000Z	prego	randabis	and about speed, (I am a Gnome fan, I know), KDE startups are quite longer than gnome's... at least in my case
2005-04-11T08:46:00.000Z	randabis	prego	just the opposite for me, especially with kde 3.4
2005-04-11T08:46:00.000Z	prego	randabis	I'm comparing ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop in the same computer...
2005-04-11T08:47:00.000Z	randabis	prego	as am I
2005-04-11T08:47:00.000Z	prego	randabis	funny, then.... it's a good thing to be able to choose ;-)
2005-04-11T10:25:00.000Z	randabis	prego	it is not a fork
2005-04-11T10:26:00.000Z	prego	randabis	it is a joke
2005-04-11T10:26:00.000Z	randabis	prego	ah, I misunderstood
2005-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	randabis	prego	no
2005-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	prego	randabis	so to remove it I have to do it manually?
2005-04-12T10:58:00.000Z	randabis	prego	yes
2005-04-12T10:59:00.000Z	randabis	prego	you could use something like debfoster to find all the dependencies and remove them to make it a bit faster
2005-04-12T11:00:00.000Z	prego	randabis	OK....
