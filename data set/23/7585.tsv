2005-06-20T12:21:00.000Z	infralite		hello, is it possible to upgrade from 4.10 to the current stable version?
2005-06-20T12:21:00.000Z	infralite		ah, online update?
2005-06-20T12:21:00.000Z	infralite		no need to download cd?
2005-06-20T12:22:00.000Z	infralite		hmm
2005-06-20T12:22:00.000Z	infralite		hehe
2005-06-20T12:22:00.000Z	infralite		ah, i thought that old versions would become unsupported
2005-06-20T12:23:00.000Z	djm62	infralite	they do eventually....but I think hoary has until 2006 at the earliest
2005-06-20T12:23:00.000Z	infralite		would i upgrade through synaptic or apt?
2005-06-20T12:23:00.000Z	infralite		or is there another means?
2005-06-20T12:24:00.000Z	djm62	infralite	you would need to change your sources.list, then apt-get dist-upgrade, and that's that
2005-06-20T12:24:00.000Z	infralite		ah
2005-06-20T12:25:00.000Z	djm62	infralite	when breezy is released, there will be clear instructions on how to update on the web, telling you what to change
2005-06-20T12:25:00.000Z	infralite	djm62	then onto hoary for now
2005-06-20T12:25:00.000Z	djm62	infralite	I'm using it...it's good :)
2005-06-20T12:25:00.000Z	infralite	djm62	lol
2005-06-20T12:26:00.000Z	infralite		i'm happy with ubuntu too, no need to convince me :)
2005-06-20T12:26:00.000Z	infralite	djm62	so dist-upgrade doesn't exist for now?
2005-06-20T12:27:00.000Z	djm62	infralite	dist-upgrade exists, and you are free to use breezy, but it isn't recommended
2005-06-20T12:27:00.000Z	infralite	djm62	hmm, but can't i get a dst-upgrade for hoary? i'm using an earlier version
2005-06-20T12:28:00.000Z	infralite		*dist
2005-06-20T12:28:00.000Z	djm62	infralite	oh, yeah...look on the wiki for warty->hoary instructions, and be prepared for some downloading
2005-06-20T12:28:00.000Z	infralite	djm62	ah, ok. thanks :D that was all i wanted
