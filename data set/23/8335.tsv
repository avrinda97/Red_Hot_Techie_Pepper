2004-12-23T09:52:00.000Z	njs12345		if I install KDE will it break my ubuntu?
2004-12-23T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	not at all.
2004-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	njs12345	crimsun	it's just that if I install it through synaptic is says it'll remove libfam0c102
2004-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	are you running warty or hoary?
2004-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	that's fine. gam_server and libgam* replace fam and libfam*
2004-12-23T09:58:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	it is no longer provided by any pool
2004-12-23T09:58:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	you can try looking in snapshot.debian.net
2005-02-03T17:21:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	xcompmgr is worth mentioning.
2005-03-23T15:41:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	do any other sound applications function normally?
2005-03-23T15:42:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	instead of specifying a decoder on the gst-launch pipeline, just use spider
2005-03-23T15:42:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	see gst-launch0.8
2005-03-23T15:43:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	yep
2005-03-23T15:45:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	does mpg321 work?
2005-03-23T15:47:00.000Z	njs12345	crimsun	I don't think I have it installed
2005-03-23T15:47:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	sudo apt-get install mpg321
2005-03-23T15:48:00.000Z	njs12345	crimsun	yup, works..
2005-03-23T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	so yours is a gstreamer issue
2005-03-23T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	sudo apt-get --reinstall install gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-03-23T15:51:00.000Z	njs12345	crimsun	gst-register-0.8 seems to let spider work with mp3s :)
2005-03-23T15:51:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	good.
2005-04-21T11:12:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	no need for that. mozilla-firefox already uses a wrapper as necessary.
2005-04-21T11:12:00.000Z	njs12345	crimsun	is that right?
2005-04-21T11:13:00.000Z	crimsun	njs12345	it's even documented in the README.Debian.gz
