2006-03-20T07:40:00.000Z	Xen		thanks.
2006-03-20T07:40:00.000Z	Xen		now i need some other advice. My isp won't allow operating personal; servers. anyway i can get around this so that they would not find out? I followed the same logic as Bittoreent and picked a random port (9999)
2006-03-20T07:40:00.000Z	silvaran		We should all have an fstab party, smellican can bring his pork.
2006-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	Xen		ok. im going to mess around with my server. thanks for all your help guys!
2006-03-20T07:43:00.000Z	silvaran		xen: what isp?  I've had good luck with 1720 as a bittorrent port.
2006-03-20T07:43:00.000Z	silvaran		http://www.n3t.net/Infos/subnets.html
2006-03-20T07:43:00.000Z	Xen		my isp is rogers.com
2006-03-20T07:43:00.000Z	Xen		my BT port works fine\
2006-03-20T07:43:00.000Z	silvaran	Xen	Yeah they filter bittorrent, especially the standard ports, and do other funky stuff to various connections.
