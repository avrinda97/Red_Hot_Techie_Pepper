2009-09-18T06:50:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	wait checking ur screenshot
2009-09-18T06:51:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	is it your boot partition?
2009-09-18T06:53:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	sorry I forgot... if u resize your root partition it will be unbootable
2009-09-18T06:54:00.000Z	Ulises54	alokito	I know
2009-09-18T06:54:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	then simply delete the partition and make a new one?
2009-09-18T06:56:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	copy the data of the old partition somewhere else then delete it
2009-09-18T06:57:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	that's why its not resizing
2009-09-18T06:58:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	you can fsck it to see if it can be fixed
2009-09-18T06:58:00.000Z	Ulises54	alokito	I've already done that... without succeding
2009-09-18T07:08:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	can you mount the partition?
2009-09-18T07:09:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	don't u have free space on some other partition in the hard disk?
2009-09-18T07:10:00.000Z	Ulises54	alokito	I've free space at the same disk
2009-09-18T07:11:00.000Z	alokito	Ulises54	search synaptic for a data recovery tool
2009-09-18T07:15:00.000Z	Ulises54	alokito	you mean this http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/Download?
