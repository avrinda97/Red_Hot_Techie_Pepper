2008-12-13T00:03:00.000Z	nonix4		hmm... to pause apt-mirror, just kill it & start it again? or will that waste ridiculous amounts of bandwidth?
2008-12-13T00:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	no. onthe command line press  Ctrl-S
2008-12-13T00:04:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	it was started from cron...
2008-12-13T00:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	oh
2008-12-13T00:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	i'm prety sure there is a way to pause it.. but i forget.. look at the man page for 'kill'. look and see if you can send it a pause signal with the kill command
2008-12-13T00:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	looks like   kill -s STOP <process_number>     would do it
2008-12-13T00:08:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	hmm, it is a perl script and I don't see any signal handlers in the source... at least w/ grep
2008-12-13T00:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	uggh
2008-12-13T00:08:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	perl script that runs 20 wgets
2008-12-13T00:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	roger... i dunno man
2008-12-13T00:09:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	so maybe sending the stop to those wgets instead would work better... or just the program group.
2008-12-13T00:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	perhaps.. if it were me, i'd probably be trying it
2008-12-16T23:12:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	data loss as in possibly killing the running session
2008-12-16T23:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	oh? hmmm. it might take me out of x right there and then eh?
2008-12-16T23:14:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	yes, that may happen... so be prepared :)
2008-12-16T23:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	allright, roger that. thank you. i was just thinking ofmaking it so i have the option of what window manager i use when i start up. for instance using 'startx', or using invoke-rc.d gdm start if i want when i boot up. cheers
2008-12-16T23:19:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	yeah that does make sense... since gdm isn't perfect. And console is nice anyway :-)
2008-12-16T23:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	:-)
2008-12-16T23:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	ok, i don't know if you can help me or not, but i'd like to reactive the gdm service. at the console, invoke-rc.d gdm start doesn't work now. that wasn't what i was expecting, hehe
2008-12-16T23:29:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	well I have indeed broken it in the past and fixed as well, now how was it... are you doing the sudo part somewhere?
2008-12-16T23:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	doh! hang on... perhaps i goofed not using sudo
2008-12-16T23:33:00.000Z	nonix4	onetinsoldier	just tested, if you do forget the sudo, you get an error message about it in /var/log/daemon.log - may want to check that out ;)
2008-12-16T23:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nonix4	yeah.. since i just woke up, i had forgotten to use sudo to start up gdm. that's my excuse anyway, lol
