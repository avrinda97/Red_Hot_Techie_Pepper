2007-07-17T13:47:00.000Z	Senken12		Can I get some help with my file browser?
2007-07-17T13:47:00.000Z	Senken12		Whenever I try to access my user area (Home Folder and Documents) it freeze
2007-07-17T13:47:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	yes but I won't use my talent to get the info out of you
2007-07-17T13:48:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	is that home on a diff partition?
2007-07-17T13:48:00.000Z	Senken12	elpargo	I'm not sure, I wasn't around when my dad installed on my laptop
2007-07-17T13:51:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	umm so that may be it. you are probably missing some permission access, could you check with your "admin" user what is the permission of /home/<yourUser>
2007-07-17T14:07:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	umm that seems ok, that's with the "senken" user right?
2007-07-17T14:02:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	could you create another user and check if you still have the problem
2007-07-17T14:04:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	ok can you open a shell and give me the permissions you get with ls -al /home/senken (I think that's ur troublesome user)
2007-07-17T14:09:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	ok but it's the same user senken right? not the "admin" user
2007-07-17T14:09:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	all I could think of is that something inside gnome got mess up, you could try deleting .gnome* that will kill your desktop setting but will probably let you see the files again.
2007-07-17T14:11:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	I vote for nautilus being messup you can read the files form the console so your disk doesn't seems to have problems.
2007-07-17T14:13:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	run this on your home mv -r .gnome2 .gnome2-back , then log out and back in if it's fix it was gnome if it's not then your config is stored on the -back dir.
2007-07-17T14:19:00.000Z	Senken12	elpargo	what was it that you said?
2007-07-17T14:20:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	run this on your home mv -r .gnome2 .gnome2-back , then log out and back in if it's fix it was gnome if it's not then your config is stored on the -back dir.
2007-07-17T14:23:00.000Z	Senken12	elpargo	what am I putting in exactly then?
2007-07-17T14:23:00.000Z	elpargo	Senken12	mv .gnome2 .gnome2-back
2007-07-17T14:25:00.000Z	Senken12	elpargo	didn't work
2007-07-17T14:26:00.000Z	Senken12	elpargo	it didn't work
