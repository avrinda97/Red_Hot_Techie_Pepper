2010-06-23T12:56:00.000Z	JoMs	pepee	when you use sudo su you often will be sitting a little while to chown fils/folders and so on. for instance, you can't start munin with sudo. that will make the whole thing go bananas
2010-06-23T12:57:00.000Z	pepee	JoMs	what's munin?
2010-06-23T12:58:00.000Z	JoMs	pepee	a program that makes graphs from your e.g. server. it shows CPU usage, disc-usage, network and a lot more
2010-06-23T12:58:00.000Z	pepee	JoMs	like top?
