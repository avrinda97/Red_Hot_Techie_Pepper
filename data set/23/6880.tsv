2006-03-12T14:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	have you messed with your /etc/apt/sources.list  ?
2006-03-12T14:28:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	yes, i think so. i just put the breezy cd into my hoary system...
2006-03-12T14:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	that won't work - you need to upgrade everything or nothing
2006-03-12T14:28:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	 and then i saw it wanted to download 400mb and i chose not to install. however, it looks like the cd updated the repositories
2006-03-12T14:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	do you want to upgrade to breezy?
2006-03-12T14:29:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	and when i reinstalled samba it upgraded it to the next version but not smbfs
2006-03-12T14:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	you now have a mixed system then - not easy to fix
2006-03-12T14:29:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	yes, but i'll have to go to an internet cafe to upgrade
2006-03-12T14:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	you can try removing al breezy lines and running  sudo apt-get -f install
2006-03-12T14:30:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	ok, will this be resolved if i upgrade to breezy?
2006-03-12T14:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	well yes, it should be - you'll need to do it the right way of course
2006-03-12T14:30:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	can i just put the cd in and let it download everything?
2006-03-12T14:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	 did you add the Cd to your sources?
2006-03-12T14:31:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	i didn't but its there. ubuntu must have done that itself
2006-03-12T14:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	if so, you also need to change the other lines in the sources to say breezy
2006-03-12T14:32:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	ok, i can do that
2006-03-12T14:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	then you reload/ update and dist-upgrade
2006-03-12T14:32:00.000Z	syndicate	thoreauputic	ok, i'll try that. thanks for your help :)
2006-03-12T14:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	see ubotu above
2006-03-12T14:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	syndicate	ubotu is a bot ;)
