2007-12-13T11:16:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	I take it you tried sudo, which is the obvious thing to do
2007-12-13T11:16:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	Yeah
2007-12-13T11:16:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	can you paste your exact message?
2007-12-13T11:16:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	I can't even get firefox to start, it segfaults now
2007-12-13T11:16:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	$ sudo dpkg --configure -a dpkg: failed to write status record about `dash' to `/var/lib/dpkg/status': No space left on device
2007-12-13T11:17:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	$ sudo apt-get remove openoffice E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2007-12-13T11:17:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	is your disk full?
2007-12-13T11:17:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	my hdd no, but I'm running from the livecd
2007-12-13T11:18:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	OK, then it's trying to write things locally to the hard drive, but can't because the 'hard drive' is the boot drive, the CD
2007-12-13T11:19:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	What would the solution be, then? Obviously I can't free up space, because I can't use apt-get
2007-12-13T11:19:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	just so I understand your config - you have a local windows drive, and you livebooted to ubuntu?
2007-12-13T11:19:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	correct
2007-12-13T11:20:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	OK.  What are you interested in apt-getting?
2007-12-13T11:20:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	as I understand it, when you live-boot, the computer makes a virtual hard drive inside the RAM
2007-12-13T11:20:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	nothing anymore, I just want to apologize, back away slowly and have a stable livebooted system to use
2007-12-13T11:21:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	is rebooting an option?
2007-12-13T11:21:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	how much RAM do you have?
2007-12-13T11:22:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	what does the command "top" show you is running?
2007-12-13T11:22:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	nothing unusual, what am I looking for?
2007-12-13T11:23:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	just whatever might be eating up RAM
2007-12-13T11:23:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	you might also want to try rebooting X, if you don't want to reboot ubuntu entirely
2007-12-13T11:23:00.000Z	logankoester	robotic	nothing is eating up ram, the problem is that the "disk" is full... but the disk only exists in ram, because it's a livecd
2007-12-13T11:24:00.000Z	robotic	logankoester	sure, good luck!
