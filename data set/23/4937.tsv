2007-07-16T10:45:00.000Z	summer_s4		I have a wireless adapter and network,
2007-07-16T10:46:00.000Z	summer_s4		and ubuntu won't connect to the wireless network.
2007-07-16T10:46:00.000Z	summer_s4		When windows xp was my OS, it could connect easily and yes it does
2007-07-16T10:47:00.000Z	summer_s4		it just fails to connect
2007-07-16T10:47:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	but it is detected, and detects access points?
2007-07-16T11:00:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	you just need to forget bad habits, and start from scratch.
2007-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	but keep in mind, you can have the best of both worlds.
2007-07-16T11:03:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	since you legally own a license to use windows you could always download an xp iso or something.
2007-07-16T11:21:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	linux was made to do anything. ubuntu uses a desktop called gnome, which is mildly inspired/based on mac operating systems.
2007-07-16T11:36:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	applications > accessories > terminal
2007-07-16T12:25:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	http://google.com
2007-07-16T12:34:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	it's because you're a good little clone ;)
2007-07-16T12:44:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	PS: hit ctrl + T
2007-07-16T13:14:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	sudo tasksel
2007-07-16T13:14:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	choose kubuntu desktop, okay.
2007-07-16T13:15:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	so accept it.... have you ever used computers before? i don't mean to take offence, but i'm just wondering.
2007-07-16T13:16:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	yes i understand, but did you have much experience using windows?
2007-07-16T13:18:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	maybe because you're already running synaptic or another package management program
2007-07-16T13:18:00.000Z	Nubbie	summer_s4	you can only run one.
