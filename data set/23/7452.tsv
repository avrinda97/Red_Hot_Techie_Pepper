2005-07-26T13:54:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	the only way I would know how is to create another user and remove your current user
2005-07-26T13:54:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	make sure you give your root a password first
2005-07-26T13:54:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	sudo passwd root
2005-07-26T13:55:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	I know... but i dont know of another way
2005-07-26T13:55:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	sure but then your gonna need to remove its dependencies aswell
2005-07-26T13:56:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	isnt it possible to ignoere dependencies?
2005-07-26T13:57:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	dont know
2005-07-26T13:57:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	im sure theres a better way to fix this, or example removing the configuration file in your home directory but i dont know what files they are
2005-07-26T13:57:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	maybe someone else here knows...
2005-07-26T13:58:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	so it's not just my home dir... ;)
2005-07-26T14:00:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	your sound is messed up right, by that you mean the audio setting are wrong
2005-07-26T14:00:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	those are stored in your home folder
2005-07-26T14:00:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	I just dont know what files it is
2005-07-26T14:00:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	no, its sound overall, for everyone in the system...
2005-07-26T14:01:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	oh...I see
2005-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=32063 <- i follow this, and i cant seem to reverse the effects now.
2005-07-26T14:07:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	that tutorial messed up the sound in your computer ?
2005-07-26T14:09:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	nope, it was that tutuorial...
2005-07-26T14:09:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	almost positive.
2005-07-26T14:10:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	talking to me?
2005-07-26T14:10:00.000Z	jesus-franco	qt2	it seems easy to fix it. Remove the file /etc/asound.conf
2005-07-26T14:10:00.000Z	qt2	jesus-franco	tried that... didnt work.
