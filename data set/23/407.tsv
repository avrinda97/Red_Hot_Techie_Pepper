2011-10-09T17:43:00.000Z	FreeWilly		hi, im trying to get ubuntu server to automatically mount my cd/dvdrom at startup with an entry in fstab, just below the entry of my additional hd's that do mount correctly automatically at startup
2011-10-09T17:43:00.000Z	FreeWilly		the entry looks like this: /dev/cdrom1  /mnt/cdrom  udf,iso9660  user,noauto,exec,utf8  0  0
2011-10-09T17:43:00.000Z	fritsch	FreeWilly	you see the noauto?
2011-10-09T17:43:00.000Z	FreeWilly		however its not atu mounting the cd/dvd drive  at startup
2011-10-09T17:44:00.000Z	fritsch	FreeWilly	could mean that does will do "no auto" mount
2011-10-09T17:44:00.000Z	FreeWilly		i can manually mount the drive fine with sudo mount /dev/cdrom1 /mnt/cdrom
2011-10-09T17:44:00.000Z	fritsch	FreeWilly	from the manpage: noauto do not mount when "maount -a" is given (e.g., at boot time)
2011-10-09T17:44:00.000Z	fritsch	FreeWilly	just replace the noauto with auto
2011-10-09T17:44:00.000Z	FreeWilly		i see what u saying lets try, thanks fritsch
2011-10-09T17:45:00.000Z	FreeWilly		just remove it?
