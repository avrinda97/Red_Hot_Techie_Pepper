2009-07-26T06:41:00.000Z	gobucks09		will 96 run a TNT2 MODEL 65?
2009-07-26T06:42:00.000Z	gobucks09		... um... TNT2 MODEL 64
2009-07-26T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	71 seems to be the one
2009-07-26T06:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	no need for it, simply run: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-71     then reboot
2009-07-26T06:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	ok, can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-07-26T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	it is by default but some folks (like me) need to populate it
2009-07-26T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	can you give a pastebin of yours please
2009-07-26T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	theres nothing there. it only says: minus the comments...
2009-07-26T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	better, ok add a line under configured video device that says      Driver "nvidia"
2009-07-26T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	if you use an old-ish crt you may need to specify refresh rates and colour depths etc
2009-07-26T06:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-07-26T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	once you save the new file, reboot
2009-07-26T07:35:00.000Z	gobucks09	ActionParsnip	 that didn't work, nvidia drivers did not load.  x wouldn't start without reconfig.  back to default.  All I'm trying to do is center the screen & switch to 1280x1024 in 60hz mode.  Usually, I would edit the xorg.conf to do this, but this one barren & there are no comments for a guide.  Plus xsync start/end aren't right.  Is there an app I can install that adjusts this?
2009-07-26T07:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	you can edit xorg.conf as you normally world. it works the same
2009-07-26T07:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	xorg.conf will superced anything that hal finds
2009-07-26T08:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	i can send you mine if you want

2009-07-26T08:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	kubuntu is a release of ubuntu that uses kde instead of gnome by defaulty
2009-07-26T08:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	i prefer lxde personally

2009-07-26T08:32:00.000Z	gobucks09	ActionParsnip	I've booted lxde before.  I remember the screen but can't remember the distro.  Who uses it?
2009-07-26T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	me for one
2009-07-26T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gobucks09	im also on a team to make Lubuntu :)
