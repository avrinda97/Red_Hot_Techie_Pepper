2010-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	electrofreak		I currently have an ubuntu server install from 2008 sometime... I originally installed it onto a single IDE drive using LVM for my volumes. I want to actually move it to two new hard drives running in RAID1. Will there be any problems copying everything from LVM "volumes" onto just plain partitions? I don't have interest in using LVM any more.
2010-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	I don't see why you would have an issue, are you going to maintain the same filesystem
2010-06-19T05:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	I mean structure, from / on up
2010-06-19T05:47:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	well... I'm taking the files, etc... probably going to format the new one ext4. I believe I know all the other details of the operation, just wondering if forgoing the LVM stuff will cause any problems
2010-06-19T05:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	that's low level as far as the files are concerned. You should be able to move that pretty easily.
2010-06-19T05:49:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	as I thought, so. cool. I should just use cp -a /old /new, right?
2010-06-19T05:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	you may hav issues with some config files that are coded to look at a particular drive location, and you will have grub to deal with.
2010-06-19T05:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	pretty much. yeah.
2010-06-19T05:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	you should print out a filesystem map of some sort, as a reference
2010-06-19T05:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	like your old fstab, grub config, etc.
2010-06-19T05:52:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	yep. of course.
2010-06-19T05:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	and, if it doesn't work the first time you still have your old drive.
2010-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	yea, I'm excited to get rid of the IDE drive... I believe it is my last IDE still in use.
2010-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	that's all I run, man :)
2010-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	IDE??
2010-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	I don't have one of them fancy new computers.
2010-06-19T06:11:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	ah, ok. Mine isn't too fancy either... just an Athlon64... like 5+ years old now
2010-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	have you ever run ecryptfs on your system?
2010-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	sorry, no.... no encryption
2010-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	not even to "play" with it?
2010-06-19T10:27:00.000Z	electrofreak	greezmunkey	no, sorry. never used it, heh
2010-06-19T10:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	still trying to solve the wierd character issue? If so I would guess that the "special" character was created with a differant keyboard encoding scheme, other than UTF-8, what I don't know, and you can't wild card it since it's only one character...
2010-06-19T11:09:00.000Z	greezmunkey	electrofreak	you had 'em pullin' their hair out :)
