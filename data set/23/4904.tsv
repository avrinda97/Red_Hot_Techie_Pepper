2008-06-06T21:34:00.000Z	HorizonXP		!fax
2008-06-06T21:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	true hardware modems all work.. it is the soft/win modems that are a problem.  I got a plugin xircom pcmcia to get mine going
2008-06-06T21:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	Find the modem by going to a terminal and typing dmesg | grep ttyS
2008-06-06T21:42:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Jack_Sparrow	What output should I expect?
2008-06-06T21:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	the port of your modem
2008-06-06T21:43:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Jack_Sparrow	serial8250: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
2008-06-06T21:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	That does not look like your modem, that looks more like a regular serial port on the back of the box
2008-06-06T21:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	cool..   we can try something if you want to find out
2008-06-06T21:44:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Jack_Sparrow	ok, what to try?
2008-06-06T21:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	sudo screen /dev/ttyS1
2008-06-06T21:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	then try ATZ in there and see if you get OK in response
2008-06-06T21:46:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Jack_Sparrow	all I get is a blank terminal window, can't seem to type anything
2008-06-06T21:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	if it doesnt let you type and returns nothing then it isnt your modem....   Use ctrl-A then K to kill the modem terminal
2008-06-06T21:48:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Jack_Sparrow	ok, that sucks
2008-06-06T21:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	The solution I used only cost me $20 and I should have done it sooner as I wasted days on it
2008-06-06T21:49:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Jack_Sparrow	I only need to send one fax
2008-06-06T21:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HorizonXP	I thought there were online fax services..
