2006-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		and yes osx has neat api's though
2006-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		i mean, take .net
2006-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		man, vb coders can use c++ libs
2006-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		and the framework is fairly easy to use
2006-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		and the framework is huge
2006-01-27T16:40:00.000Z	Morrowyn		now, you have java on the other side, nice huge framework
2006-01-27T16:40:00.000Z	Morrowyn		but, thats just 1 lang
2006-01-27T16:40:00.000Z	Morrowyn		there is no nice "linux api"  around that makes life easy for new linux developers, in comparison to win32 api / .net  or java
2006-01-27T16:41:00.000Z	Morrowyn		i run maya on ubuntu and photoshop via crossover office / wine , works fast and peachy
2006-01-27T16:42:00.000Z	Morrowyn		and i have shake for video compositing
2006-01-27T16:42:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	> WHAT?
2006-01-27T16:43:00.000Z	Morrowyn	dwerf	maya is native for linux, as well as xsi, im still waiting for native photoshop etc., but photoshop runs just a s fast and smoothly via cxoffice on ubuntu
2006-01-27T16:45:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	mwe > maybe cxoffice is something to try for mwe...
2006-01-27T16:46:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	mwe > aren't there more commercial wine-based apps that offer better support than wine itself?
2006-01-27T16:47:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	mwe > the wait isn't over i guess
2006-01-27T16:48:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	mwe > i'm running win commander on wine, what about that? ;-)
2006-01-27T17:01:00.000Z	Morrowyn	dwerf	 eeeuw c4d ;) j/k
2006-01-27T17:03:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	I hace 3D as an extension to my work, not as a core, therefore after using Maya for three years, i swithched to Cinema 4D - it's just a lot less technical and improving constantly
2006-01-27T17:03:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	but Maya is great
2006-01-27T17:05:00.000Z	Morrowyn	dwerf	i run maya natively on ubuntu, it runs very nice, i had to do create 1 file, since it comes with rpms, which you need to alien to debs and i forgot to execute the scripts
2006-01-27T17:06:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	so what happened?
2006-01-27T17:09:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	I've heard of Modo and tried it. I use Wings 3D a lot too.
2006-01-27T17:09:00.000Z	dwerf	Morrowyn	Wings 3D runs very smooth on Ubuntu
