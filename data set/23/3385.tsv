2008-05-04T22:56:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	Install package php5-mysql if you install with packages, or install/activate the mysql module in php configuration if you are manually installing it (compiling)
2008-05-04T22:57:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	I already installed it
2008-05-04T22:58:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	php5-mysql, php5 and mysql?
2008-05-04T23:02:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	php5-mysql, mysql-server, mysql-common, mysql-server-5.0, php 5 are the packages installed...
2008-05-04T23:04:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	Check the php.ini (/etc/php5/apache/php.ini) file, there should be a line that says "extesnion=mysql.so" (sans quotes) or something similar
2008-05-04T23:05:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	ok, i have it open
2008-05-04T23:08:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	ok, i have it open and i see extesioon=msql.so and its commented out
2008-05-04T23:08:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	Not msql, mysql
2008-05-04T23:08:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	ok, i found mysql.so and thats commented out too
2008-05-04T23:09:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	Uncomment it, then restart apache
2008-05-04T23:09:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	ok
2008-05-04T23:11:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	is there a quick command to restart apache? or do i need to do it through services?
2008-05-04T23:12:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	sudo /usr/sbin/apache2ctl restart
2008-05-04T23:12:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	thx
2008-05-04T23:15:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	ahh, same error
2008-05-04T23:16:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	Then i dont know
2008-05-04T23:16:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	ok, now when it restarted apache it said: Could Not Determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 as ServerName .. could that effect it?
2008-05-04T23:17:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	No, that is just that the ServerName directive isn't set (which isn't affecting anything unless you run multiple apache servers)
2008-05-04T23:18:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	what should be the extension_dir in php.ini?
2008-05-04T23:18:00.000Z	Dvyjones	monkeypaw201	Mine isn't set, still, it works
2008-05-04T23:19:00.000Z	monkeypaw201	Dvyjones	ok, cause it works on the Ubuntu 8 (my desktop) its just the laptop thats ubuntu 6 and doesn't want to work..
