2005-02-23T06:04:00.000Z	Killian	scoon	some glitches in ubuntu-PPC, but nothing tooo terrible.
2005-02-23T06:04:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	such as ?
2005-02-23T06:04:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	i am thinking about getting an ibook and am just curious
2005-02-23T06:06:00.000Z	Killian	scoon	synaptic glitches when you open up "universal" packages : my bus speed isnt being read right, and from what ive noted, : any HFS+ hdd <apple native> reads a bit slow if mounted w. Music/media
2005-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	that hfs could be problematic
2005-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	do you dual boot ?
2005-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	Killian	scoon	a buddy of mine told me Gentoo runs real good on his Powerbook : he was dualbooted w. OSX :
2005-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	thnks.
2005-02-23T06:08:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	yeah i don't think that i would dual boot. not a big osx fan really.
2005-02-23T06:09:00.000Z	Killian	scoon	i find i like osx on a >1ghz cpu. anything less is questionable
2005-02-23T06:10:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	my girl has a powerbook and i'd love to put linux on it but she uses it for her work and i don't want to make that harder for her.
2005-02-23T06:10:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	but osx i don't like so much.
2005-02-23T06:28:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	that sounds like a nice combo
2005-02-23T06:29:00.000Z	Killian	scoon	it was.  had to hand compile everything, but isnt that what bsd is for?
2005-02-23T06:29:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	even now i do a fair amount of hand rolling
2005-02-23T06:30:00.000Z	Killian	scoon	im basically just setup cuz OSX went Kabooom on me : waitin to buy it again :
2005-02-23T06:30:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	purchase an os ?
2005-02-23T06:31:00.000Z	scoon	Killian	so did i.
