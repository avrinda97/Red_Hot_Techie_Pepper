2006-09-28T09:30:00.000Z	Firestar		Hi Everyone
2006-09-28T09:30:00.000Z	Firestar		Sorry to bother, but I've got a question
2006-09-28T09:31:00.000Z	Firestar		I'm running a server with 4GB ram, but my top stats and cat /proc/meminfo is only showing 2.8 GB
2006-09-28T09:31:00.000Z	Firestar		does anyone know why? and more importantly, how to fix it?
2006-09-28T09:32:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	cat /proc/mtrr
2006-09-28T09:34:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	are you booting off one of the desktop kernels?  if so, try installing linux-server
2006-09-28T09:35:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	uname -a
2006-09-28T09:37:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	my server is on this version - Linux prophecy 2.6.15-26-amd64-server #1 SMP Fri Sep 8 20:33:15 UTC 2006 x86_64 GNU/Linux - must I still do that aptitude install command?
2006-09-28T09:39:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	I tried installing that, and it's not doing anything, so I think I'm already on that version. Any other ideas?
2006-09-28T09:41:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	can you point in to a document where I can learn how to do this? (force RAM detection, that is)
2006-09-28T09:42:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	indeed, mem=4096
2006-09-28T09:43:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	to test it, when you reboot the machine Press Escape at grub, then hit 'e'
2006-09-28T09:43:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	add it to the end of the top line by pressing 'e' again - if it works, come back here and we'll add it permanently to GRUB
2006-09-28T09:44:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	I'm not in front of the machine. It's at a hosting company. I'm SSH'ing into it
2006-09-28T09:47:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	I'm looking at the menu.lst file now, but I don't know to which line to add the mem=4096 statement too. Any idea?
2006-09-28T09:47:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	aye, the commented line starting with kopt=
2006-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	I'm not getting a kopt line that isn't commented out. This is all there is (with kopt in it)
2006-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	that last line, with the single '#', add mem=4096 to it
2006-09-28T09:51:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	then save it, and run 'sudo update-grub' :)
2006-09-28T09:52:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	I assume I have to restart the server now, right?
2006-09-28T09:53:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	nah, not for the kernel, make sure you did the update-grub then just reboot it
2006-09-28T09:53:00.000Z	JosefK	Firestar	aye
2006-09-28T10:00:00.000Z	Firestar	JosefK	sorry, it doesn't work :(
