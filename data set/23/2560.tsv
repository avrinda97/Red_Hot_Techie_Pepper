2009-01-27T14:28:00.000Z	RazlogNET		Hey, guys! My laptop battery got depleted and my PC shutdown instantly... and now my ubuntu 8.10 doesn't find any boot records... I got some error msg and "grub >" command line
2009-01-27T14:30:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	sounds like grub got fried, you can remap it from a live cd, see this thread: http://maketecheasier.com/how-to-restore-grub-in-ubuntu/2008/04/11
2009-01-27T14:41:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	did you see my post above?
2009-01-27T14:44:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	I don't have grub problems, grub is all that starts
2009-01-27T14:44:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	and I don't have usb flashdrive
2009-01-27T14:45:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	does it give an error? and do you have a cd drive and live cd?
2009-01-27T14:45:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	error is smthn like "Couldn't find boot blah-blah..." don't have rescue disk
2009-01-27T14:46:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	the blah blah blah part would help :)
2009-01-27T14:47:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	I have to reboot, write it down on a piece of paper, reboot and type it down in order to get the blah-blah to your screen...
2009-01-27T14:47:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	I'll do it, so wait up! :)
2009-01-27T14:58:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	http://fpaste.org/paste/2317 - the blah blah part
2009-01-27T15:00:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	- the more accurate ver: http://fpaste.org/paste/2318
2009-01-27T15:03:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	from what i can tell the kernal is not initializing
2009-01-27T15:03:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	considering my ubuntu is installed "Inside Windows" is a throuh-windows repair possible, or editing what must be eddited or... ?
2009-01-27T15:04:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	oh u used wubi eh, unfortunately ive never used it, so someone else should prob help
2009-01-27T15:05:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	i think it can prob be repaired form withen windows, does the wubi installer offer any repair options?
2009-01-27T15:06:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	nope, just new installation... I wonder what will happen if I install it again, replacing the old installation...
2009-01-27T15:06:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	that will work, just dlete it and install to the same space
2009-01-27T15:07:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	I will loose everything installed within, right? :D
2009-01-27T15:08:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	anything important there?  may have a solution
2009-01-27T15:08:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	couldn't say so... I installed it like... 10 days ago, but the updates take forever...
2009-01-27T15:11:00.000Z	RazlogNET	cbilljones	maybe I will... I'll try using help at my country's servers... hope theres s.o. whos got the problem
2009-01-27T15:11:00.000Z	cbilljones	RazlogNET	ok goodluck, im going to try to sleep again :)
